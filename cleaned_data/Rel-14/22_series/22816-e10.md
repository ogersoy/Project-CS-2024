# 4 Use Cases
## 4.1 Use Case 1: UHD content delivery
### 4.1.1 Description
Ultra-High Definition (UHD) content (3840 x 2160 resolutions) has been widely
supported by OTT providers and TV makers. The highest display resolution
supported by smart phone in the market is Quad HD (QHD, 2560 x 1440
resolutions). It is expected that display resolution of smart phone will keep
evolving and support UHD resolution in the future. It is also expected that 4K
TV can consume the UHD content from OTT providers via a UE.
UHD content delivery requires 8Mbps-20Mbps bandwidth in current deployed fixed
network(e.g. using H.265 @ 60fps).
UHD content delivery is expected to be supported by 3GPP network. The
recommended data rate for UHD content delivery is [8Mbps-20Mbps].
### 4.1.2 Pre-conditions
OTT provider X releases a new live UHD program; Tom's UE supports UHD
resolution. Alice's UE doesn't support UHD resolution; however, Alice's TV is
UHD capable.
### 4.1.3 Service Flows
A live UHD program is streaming by OTT provider X. Tom accesses the live UHD
program using UHD capable of UE. Alice accesses this live UHD program via her
UE, the live UHD program is presented on her TV. Many other users access this
live UHD program too. Per agreement between MNO (Mobile Network Operator) and
OTT provider X, 3GPP network delivers the content of live UHD program using
broadcast (BC) mode.
### 4.1.4 Post-conditions
Tom's UE receives the content of live UHD program, the UHD program is
presented on the UE.
Alice's UE receives the content of live UHD program , the UHD program is
presented on the TV.
### 4.1.5 Potential Requirements
The 3GPP network shall support UHD content delivery.
The 3GPP system shall support [8Mbps-20Mbps] over one broadcast channel.
The 3GPP system shall support [8Mbps-20Mbps] over unicast delivery to a UE.
## 4.2 Use Case 2: Concurrent UHD content delivery
### 4.2.1 Description
Considering each OTT provider provides several live UHD 4K TV programs
concurrently, there are many OTT providers offering live UHD 4K TV programs at
the same time. User accesses to each live UHD 4K TV program per user's
preference/interest. Within a geographic region, several concurrent live UHD
4K TV programs are consumed by different user groups in parallel. To improve
user experience and use network capacity efficiently, it is expected to
deliver concurrent live UHD 4K TV programs using broadcast delivery method as
much as possible by 3GPP network.
In the broadcast industry, the number of concurrent broadcast channel in the
air is around 10 to 24 with HD (High Definition,720p) or SD (Standard
Definition,480i or 576i) resolution. The higher number of concurrent channel
is also foreseen. The exact concurrent channel number is subject to content
resolution, network capacity and user's watching behaviour.
### 4.2.2 Pre-conditions
OTT provider X offers 8 live UHD programs; OTT provider Y offers 15 live UHD
programs.
Each UHD program is encoded at 12Mbps.
### 4.2.3 Service Flows
In a residence community at the night time, 5 live UHD programs of OTT
provider X and 7 live UHD programs of OTT provider Y are viewed by many user
at the same time. Per agreement between MNO and OTT provider, also taking into
available network broadcast capacity consideration, 3GPP network decides to
deliver 10 live UHD program using broadcast mode simultaneously. The rest of 2
live UHD programs are delivered with unicast mode.
### 4.2.4 Post-conditions
The broadcasted live UHD program are received by the UE and presented to the
user.
The non-broadcasted live UHD program are received by the UE and presented to
the user.
### 4.2.5 Potential Requirements
The 3GPP network shall be able to support at least [10] high quality video
channels of 12Mbps each simultaneously via broadcast.
## 4.3 Use Case 3: Broadcast Capacity on-demand update per traffic demand
### 4.3.1 Description
In a residential community at Saturday night time, many users access OTT live
streaming programs delivered over broadcast channel. Both unicast traffic and
broadcast traffic share the same carrier. The broadcast capacity allocated by
the MNO A is almost fully consumed. A breaking event happens, and live video
content of breaking news from OTT provider X's server is accessed by many
users via unicast. The surging unicast traffic causes network congestion. Thus
the MNO decides to put the FHD(1080p) breaking news onto broadcast rather than
unicast. There are two cases of handling that.
Case 1: Considering the currently available broadcast capacity can't
accommodate this new capacity demand, and the MNO decides to avoid adding a
new carrier or does not have a spare carrier, he decides to convert part of
existing unicast capacity into broadcast capacity.
Case 2: To satisfy the capacity demand the MNO decides to dedicate a new
carrier for LTE based TV traffic. After the new carrier is in operation, the
live video content is broadcasted over the new carrier. The existing broadcast
traffic can also be moved to this newly added carrier. The broadcast capacity
of the existing carrier can be converted back to unicast capacity.
### 4.3.2 Pre-conditions
Both MNO A use one carrier (C1) for LTE based TV service i.e. for both,
unicast and broadcast traffic and, 10 TV channels are transmitted by MNO A on
that carrier.
In case 1 MNO A doesn't have spare carrier, in case 2 MNO A has a spare
carrier.
An event happens and the breaking news is provided by the OTT provider. It is
accessed by many users of MNO A via unicast and the carrier capacity is about
to fully occupied.
### 4.3.3 Service Flows
Due to the breaking news event the currently available capacity on carrier C1
cannot accommodate the demand anymore.
In case 1, as there is no spare carrier available, MNO A decides to convert
part of existing unicast capacity into broadcast capacity.
In case 2the MNO A decides to use its spare carrier C2 dedicate it to LTE
based TV service, after the new carrier is in operation, the live video
content causing the surge is broadcast on carrier C2. Subsequently, existing
broadcast traffic on carrier C1 may be moved to carrier C2, to form a
broadcast only carrier. The broadcast capacity of existing carrier C1 may be
converted back to unicast capacity.
When the breaking event ends, in case 1 MNO A may change the broadcast
capacity back to unicast if need arises. In case 2 MNO A may decide to free up
carrier C2 again by moving traffic to carrier C1, provided capacity on carrier
C1 is sufficient again.
### 4.3.4 Post-conditions
The breaking news event is delivered in a resource efficient way in broadcast
mode.
The existing 10 channels of MNO A and the new breaking news channel are
broadcast over new carrier without the users noticing interruption.
### 4.3.5 Potential Requirements
The 3GPP network shall be able to support using one carrier for both unicast
and broadcast distribution of TV programmes.
The 3GPP network shall support flexible change between broadcast and unicast
per traffic demand over the same carrier.
The 3GPP network shall be able to support using a full carrier for broadcast.
If allowed by the operator and a spare carrier is available, the 3GPP network
shall be able to make use of spare carriers or free up carriers if not
required anymore.
## 4.4 Use Case 4: Capacity on-demand for BC mode delivery of TV content
### 4.4.1 Description
MNO can support both own managed TV service and OTT provider's TV service over
same 3GPP network, both MNO/OTT provider and end user expects the TV content
are delivered with high resolution quality, minimum jitter, low latency and
etc. The real-time interaction between TV service provider (MNO or OTT
provider) and end-user using companion device is very popular in current TV
industry. This interaction procedure is used to collect user's viewing and
interaction with Ads presented in the TV content and allow end-user sharing
view with social media tools, etc.
Figure 4.4-1: Capacity On Demand for TV content delivery
To better support TV service for both MNO and OTT provider, MNO can provide
dedicated network capacity for contracted OTT provider. MNO can also provide
dedicated network capacity for own managed TV service. As shown in Figure
4.4-1, MNO provides dedicated broadcast network capacity BC-1 for OTT provider
X. Dedicated broadcast capacity BC-2 is assigned to MNO's own managed TV
service. The rest of broadcast (BC-3) capacity is shared by other
applications. All unicast mode traffic associated with TV programs is carried
over UC-1 which serving other non-TV traffic too.
### 4.4.2 Pre-conditions
MNO provides OTT provider X with dedicated broadcast capacity BC-1 per OTT
provider X's request.
Dedicated broadcast capacity BC-2 is assigned to MNO's own managed TV service.
Unicast traffic associated with both OTT provider X's and MNO's own TV
programs is carried over UC-1.
### 4.4.3 Service Flows
OTT provider X TV programs are very popular and more end users are attracted.
The contracted dedicated broadcast capacity BC-1 is going to run out. OTT
provider X plans to release a new live TV program with FHD resolution. OTT
provider X requests MNO to increase BC-1 capacity. The MNO grants OTT provider
X's request, considering the UC-1 and additional bandwidth required by new
live TV program, MNO decides to convert part of UC-1 capacity into broadcast
capacity to increase BC-1 capacity. BC-1 capacity is increased along with UC-1
capacity decrease.
MNO's own TV programs are very popular and attract more end users. The
contracted dedicated broadcast capacity BC-2 is going to run out. MNO plans to
add 2 new live TV programs with HD resolution. BC-2 capacity is increased per
MON's decision.
OTT provider X keeps monitoring the viewer's behaviour, TV program consumption
information and advertisement consumption information, etc. OTT provider X
found that top 3 TV programs are major contributors of the business. Current
dedicated broadcast capacity BC-1 is not fully cost-efficiently used. OTT
provider X requests MNO to decrease BC-1 capacity. The MNO grants OTT provider
X's request. MNO decrease BC-1 capacity.
### 4.4.4 Post-conditions
BC-1 capacity is increased and new live TV program is delivered to the
audiences.
MNO increases BC-2 capacity, MNO's 2 new added live TV programs are delivered
with broadcast mode to the end-users.
The BC-1 is decreased to accommodate only 3 TV programs of OTT from provider
X. The rest of TV programs are consumed by the user via unicast.
All users' experience is not obvious impacted during network UC/BC capacity
adjustment.
### 4.4.5 Potential Requirements
The 3GPP system shall be able to support an MNO offering on-demand broadcast
availability to MNO/OTT provider's TV service.
The 3GPP network shall be able to support on-demand network broadcast capacity
assignment for MNO/OTT provider's TV service.
The 3GPP network shall be able to convert network unicast capacity to network
broadcast capacity and vice versa.
The 3GPP network shall be able to support network broadcast capacity
assignment considering following criteria:
\- OTT provider request (including TV program information)
\- available network unicast/broadcast capacity of 3GPP network
## 4.5 Use Case 5: eMBMS Sharing

The MNOs provide an eMBMS service across all provisioned RAN infrastructure.
Users are provided eMBMS metadata to tune into the service once subscribed.
The MNOs and content provider have sufficient back-end O&M facilities to
ensure fair and consistent charging (e.g. monitoring, revenue sharing,
resource allocation, charging reconciliation, etc.)
### 4.5.4 Post-conditions
Subscribers of MNO A & B are provided a wide & deep TV distribution network
carrying premium content.
### 4.5.5 Potential Requirements
A participating eMBMS-enabled RAN shall be capable of distributing free-to-air

MNO
## 4.6 Use Case 6: Flexible capacity allocation
### 4.6.1 Description
An MNO operates an LTE based TV service.
To support this, the MNO dedicates a certain percentage of his user plane
radio resources to the LTE based TV service, ranging from 0 to 100%.
The TV programs can be distributed by unicast, i.e. a 1-to-1 connection to
each individual UE or by broadcast i.e. a 1-to-many connection to a group of
UEs.
Based on certain criteria(s), for example an MNO defined number of viewers the
3GPP network distributes the TV program per unicast when criteria(s) are met
while distributing the TV program on broadcast while not met.
The MNO can set limits how much of this dedicated resource to LTE based TV
service is to be used for broadcast and how much is to be used for unicast.
The MNO can reserve a certain capacity that is retained for broadcast and
cannot be used for unicast and vice versa. The MNO may pre-define these limits
on a daily basis at a resolution of one minute, e.g. to allocate broadcast
resources for the daily prime-time news show.
Within the limits given above, the MNO can task the 3GPP network to flexibly
adapt the amount of resources allocated to unicast and broadcast whenever it
is required. For example, when running out of broadcast capacity the 3GPP can
convert unicast resources to broadcast resources and vice versa.
### 4.6.2 Pre-conditions
An MNO dedicates radio resources to LTE delivered TV service.
### 4.6.3 Service Flows
The MNO dedicates a certain percentage of his user plane radio resources to
the LTE based TV service, ranging from 0 to 100%.
Based on certain criteria(s), for example an MNO defined threshold of number
of viewers of a TV program the 3GPP network automatically distributes the TV
program per unicast when the number of viewers are below the threshold while
distributing the TV program on broadcast when above.
This automatic mechanism is governed by the following limits.
Within the resource allocated to LTE based TV the MNO can limit how much is to
be used for broadcast and how much is to be used for unicast. By specifying a
maximum percentage for broadcast the MNO implicitly reserves a certain
capacity that is always allocated for broadcast and cannot be used for
unicast. Similarly the MNO can set a certain capacity that always will be
allocated for unicast.\ For example the MNO can set the maximum percentage to
be used for unicast to 80% always leaving at least 20% for broadcast. At the
same time he can set the maximum percentage to be used for broadcast to 90%
always leaving 10% capacity for unicast. The MNO can pre-define the maximum
limits on a 24 hours basis at a one minute resolution.
Within the limits given above, the 3GPP network will automatically and
flexibly adapt the amount of resources allocated to unicast and broadcast
whenever it is required. For example, when running out of broadcast capacity
the 3GPP network can convert unicast resources to broadcast resources and vice
versa. .
### 4.6.4 Post-conditions
LTE based TV service is always provided in the most resource efficient way as
desired by the MNO.
### 4.6.5 Potential Requirements
The 3GPP network shall allow the MNO to specify the amount of user plane radio
resources dedicated to LTE based TV service in a certain area.
Within the radio resources dedicated to LTE based TV service in a certain area
the 3GPP network shall allow the MNO to pre-define the maximum percentage to
be used for unicast.
The 3GPP network shall allow the MNO to pre-define this maximum percentage at
a time-resolution of [one] minute over a period of [24] hours. The 3GPP
network shall allow the MNO to change this pre-defined percentage at any time.
Within the radio resources dedicated to LTE based TV service in a certain area
the 3GPP network shall allow the MNO to pre-define the maximum percentage to
be used for broadcast.
The 3GPP network shall allow the MNO to pre-define this maximum percentage at
a time-resolution of [one] minute over a period of [24] hours. The 3GPP
network shall allow the MNO to change this pre-defined percentage at any time.
The 3GPP network shall allow the MNO to specify certain criteria, based on
which the 3GPP network will automatically convert network unicast capacity to
network broadcast capacity and vice versa in a certain area within the limits
given.
## 4.7 Use Case 7: Standalone eMBMS Network
### 4.7.1 Description
A MNO operates a linear TV service over an LTE network using either shared or
dedicated network infrastructure and spectrum resources in eMBMS mode. The LTE
network is operated as a standalone eMBMS network, i.e. without unicast. This
network implements only a subset of LTE functionalities and entities which are
required to offer such a service.
The TV service provided across such a network consists of a set of linear TV
programmes and associated programme information. The TV service can contain
free-to-air programmes and subscription based programmes. The free-to-air
programmes are receivable by all receivers irrespective of whether the users
are subscribers of the MNO, roaming subscribers of other MNOs or whether the
receivers are operating in receive-only mode without any subscription with any
MNO. Access to subscription based linear TV programmes is subject to
corresponding roaming agreements.
### 4.7.2 Pre-conditions
A MNO operates a standalone eMBMS network and provides a TV service. SIM-less
free-to-air provision of TV services needs to be enabled as well as a receive-
only mode for mobile terminals. Access to the TV service for subscribers from
other MNO networks needs to be enabled.
### 4.7.3 Service Flows
The MNO provides TV services such as a set of linear TV programmes and
associated programme information across the coverage area of the standalone
eMBMS network. Mobile terminals which are enabled to receive a TV service from
an eMBMS network can access the content.
### 4.7.4 Post-conditions
Viewers could enjoy unrestricted access to linear TV programmes on mobile
terminals from a standalone eMBMS network in addition to TV services that
might be provided via other LTE networks.
### 4.7.5 Potential Requirements
The 3GPP system shall allow to implement a standalone eMBMS network(i.e. a
network which offers eMBMS service but no unicast service) based on a set of
EPS functionalities and entities which are required to offer a linear TV
service.

possible.
## 4.14 Use Case 14: Openness for streaming content delivery
### 4.14.1 Description
This use case describes the optimization for streaming content delivery. This
case proposes that the network allow OTT TV application to schedule their
background traffic transfers via providing one or more time windows of
expected content delivery.
### 4.14.2 Pre-conditions
The 3^rd^ OTT party and the MNO have an agreement according to which the MNO
will provide the 3^rd^ OTT party the network policy information for streaming
content delivery in the geographical area specified by the 3^rd^ party
application provider and the 3^rd^ OTT party will take this information into
account to schedule information transfer in a way that is beneficial to the
MNO.
### 4.14.3 Service Flows
The 3^rd^ OTT party expects to initiate a broadcasting service to its mobile
users in a geographical area, e.g. like a popular linear streaming TV content
in a geographic area.
The 3^rd^ OTT party indicates to MNO that there is streaming content to be
sent within a given time window in a geographical area to the UEs that are
served by the 3^rd^ party and requests information to help it to decide when
it can be transferred. The 3^rd^ party application provider also indicates
information needed to enable the MNO to evaluate the impact of this transfer
on the network: e.g. the expected broadcast data rate of the streaming content
in this geographic area, media content format information to be used for
streaming content delivery, indication whether the streaming content can be
accessed when the mobile users moves out/in of broadcast coverage, indication
whether the streaming content can be cached in the MNO network to improve QoE.
As many 3^rd^ OTT parties may request a broadcast streaming content delivery,
MNO arbitrates these requests and schedules these transfers considering
available broadcast capacity. The **MNO is using its network information and
media content format information** to provide the 3^rd^ OTT parties the
guaranteed broadcast data rate for its set of UEs for streaming content
delivery in the geographical area specified by the 3^rd^ OTT party and the
possible time of the transfer.
If 3^rd^ OTT party indicates the cached streaming content can be accessed when
the mobile users moves out/in of broadcast coverage, the MNO network selects
the appreciate procedures (broadcast only, broadcast/unicast fall-back
support, or MBMS operation on Demand (MooD)) to deliver the streaming content
when the UE moves in/out of broadcast coverage with service continuity
support.
If 3^rd^ OTT party indicates the streaming content can be cached in the MNO
network, the MNO network doesn't need to retrieve the content from the 3^rd^
party if the linear streaming content is provided as a Video on Demand (VoD)
service when the live time is over.
Figure 4.14-1:MNO's streaming content delivery capability open to 3^rd^ party
### 4.14.4 Post-conditions
The 3^rd^ OTT party uses application information to select the appreciate
delivery approach for streaming content.
The MNO delivers the streaming content with high resolution to improve QoE, a
lower charging rate may be offered for streaming content broadcast delivery.
If the streaming content is cached in the MNO network, the QoE is improved and
load of OTT provider is mitigated.
### 4.14.5 Potential Requirements
Subject to MNO and 3^rd^ OTT party agreement, to enable the MNO to evaluate
the impact on distribution of data transfer in the network, the 3^rd^ OTT
party shall be able to indicate to the MNO the desired media format
information: the volume of the data traffic expected to be broadcast in this
geographic area, indication whether the streaming content can be accessed when
the mobile users moves out/in of broadcast coverage area, and indication
whether the streaming content can be cached in the MNO network.
The MNO shall be able to inform the result (e.g., selected media format
information, mode of content delivery (broadcast only, broadcast/unicast fall-
back support, MooD), QoE of content delivery, cached content indication) of
delivery to 3^rd^ party.
## 4.15 Use Case 15: Efficient delivery of OTT content by MNO network
### 4.15.1 Description
This use case describes the MNO network deliver the OTT content in an
efficient manner per OTT content provider request.
### 4.15.2 Pre-conditions
The OTT Smart TV program includes video/audio content, web content, social
media content and personalized advertisement content. Many users access the
same TV program at the same time using smart phone and/or tablet.
The timing relationship of video/audio content, personalized advertisements,
web content and social media are maintained by the OTT provider. For example,
personalized advertisement is available to be accessed after certain scene
presentation starts. Social media is only available during the live
video/audio content delivery phase. Web content are accessible anytime.
User-A has 2 devices, tablet (UE-0) is used for video/audio content
representation. Companion device (UE-1) is used for social media interaction,
personalized advertisement viewing, and/or web content access.

User-E accesses web content using UE-5.
User-A, B, C, D and E locates in the same region.
The OTT content is by default accessed over unicast bearer.
The interaction between OTT smart TV content provider and UEs is depicted in
figure 4.15-1.
Figure 4.15-1: Interaction between UEs and OTT TV program
### 4.15.3 Service Flows
OTT Smart TV content provider requests MNO to provide content delivery service
for the TV program including audio/video, personalized advertisements, Web and
social media content.
The OTT content providers indicates the end user's information, media content
information, timing relationship information among video/audio content,
personalized advertisements, web content and social media, and association
information among end-user, device information and media content information
to the MNO network.
One example of the association information is provided below:
\- User-A, UE-0: audio/video MPD, UE1: personalized advertisement URL, Web URL
and social group ID.
\- User-B, UE-2: audio/video MPD, social group ID.
\- User-C, UE-3: audio/video MPD.
\- User-D, UE-4: social group ID.
\- User-E, UE-5: social group ID, Web content URL.
Based on association information, MNO decides to form 2 broadcast groups
qualifying broadcast delivery condition (e.g., number of UE accessing the same
content, location information, content information, etc.). Group-A is formed
for audio/video content delivery. UE-0, UE-2 and UE-3 receive the audio/video
content from Group-A. Group-B is formed for social media content delivery.
UE-1, UE-2 and UE-5 receive the social media content from Group-B.
Web content and personalized advertisement content is still carried over
unicast bearer.
User-A sends a comment of current scene of program to the chat room. The
comment is delivered via UE-1 to the chat room server of OTT provider. The
comment is forwarded by the server to the MNO network. The MNO network
delivers the comment to all chat room recipients.
### 4.15.4 Post-conditions
User-A views the audio/video content over broadcast bearer via UE-0, interacts
with the personalized advertisement, access Web content and sends IM message
over unicast bearer via UE-1, receive social chat room content over broadcast
bearer via UE-1.
User-B views the audio/video content and social media content over broadcast
bearer via UE-2. The comment of certain scene sent by user-A is presented to
the user-B. The timing difference between the timing of scene corresponding to
comment is sent by UE-1 and the timing of scene corresponding to comment is
presented by UE-2 is expected in a small range, thus the experience of all
participants involved in the chat room is not impacted regardless the
transportation method.
User-C views the audio/video content over broadcast bearer via UE-3.
User-D views the timed social media content over broadcast bearer via UE-4.
User-E views the timed social media content over broadcast bearer via UE-5,
access web content over unicast bearer.
The timing relationship of video/audio content, personalized advertisement,
web content and social media presented to user-A/B/C/D are maintained
regardless the transportation method.
### 4.15.5 Potential Requirements
Subject to MNO and 3^rd^ party agreement, the OTT TV provider shall be able to
indicate to the MNO association information among users i.e. user information,
expected media content information, device information and group information
of TV program.
The 3GPP network shall be able to deliver media content to a dynamically
formed broadcast group in an efficient manner.
Subject to MNO and 3^rd^ party agreement, the OTT TV provider shall be able to

media content received by different UEs belonging to the same user, via
different transport path, aligning with the timing sequence of TV program of
the OTT provider.
## 4.16 Use Case 16: Decoupled eMBMS content, service, and transport
### 4.16.1 Description
A content provider partners with a MNO to distribute as subset of its video/TV
services offered by the content provider.
Rather than re-encode all existing encoded content for 3GPP-based distribution
as per the profiles set out in the MBMS service layer, and transpose the
service initialization metadata to the format provided by the MBMS service
layer, the content provider requests to be able to access only the MBMS
transport.
As a result, the MNO provides the facility for the content provider to feed
metadata and streamed content into the MNO core network for transport to a
population maintained by the content provider.
### 4.16.2 Pre-conditions
Subscribers of MNO B have eMBMS enabled UEs.
### 4.16.3 Service Flows
A TV Content Provider establishes a business agreement with an MNO to use the
MNOs eMBMS transport network to carry content traffic with certain parameters
(time of day, bandwidth, geographic locations, etc.).
Within those parameters, the TV Content Provider is able to insert metadata
and content into the MNOs eMBMS distribution network directly. This content
and metadata is not formatted according to the eMBMS service layer format, and
is not encoded accorded to the formats enforced by the eMBMS service layer.
Subscribers to the TV Content Providers service are notified by some mechanism
(e.g. over-the-air electronic service guide) that content is being made
available and sufficient metadata is made available by the TV Content Provider
to enable the receiving UEs to tune into the service.
Subscribers to the content service have sufficient UE capabilities to support
the service (e.g. codecs, subtitle support, DRM, error correction, reporting
mechanisms, etc.)
### 4.16.4 Post-conditions
Subscribers to the service of TV Content Provider obtain their service
provided by the eMBMS transport network of the MNO.
### 4.16.5 Potential Requirements
An MNO should be able to make available the transport aspects of an eMBMS
network to a third party content provider.
An eMBMS transport layer should be able to transport TV service streams
formatted not compliant to 3GPP standards.
A UE should be able to access an eMBMS transport session with the support of
only transport metadata.
Note: service layer metadata describing TV service is outside the scope of
3GPP for non 3GPP transports.
An eMBMS system should be able to be initiated by a UE with sufficient
metadata provided by a mechanism other than User Service Description for non
3GPP transport services.
## 4.17 Use Case 17: Simultaneous use of any LTE services from one cell and TV
service from another cell
### 4.17.1 Description
An MNO might find that eMBMS support in only a subset of the cells within a
geographical area get sufficient coverage for its TV service. If the remaining
cells, e.g. small cells, operate on the same carrier frequency as the ones
used for the TV service, they could be muted on the MBSFN sub-frames of the TV
service to save power. Otherwise if the small cells operate on a different
carrier frequency the MNO is not required to add equipment for the carrier
frequency on which the TV service is transmitted in the other cells, thereby
saving costs.
If the UE is involved in multiple services, including the TV service, at the
same time it might need to be able to utilize services from other cells
supporting different frequency bands or two cells at the same time where the
cells could even be unsynchronized. A UEs should therefore also be able to
receive eMBMS from one site while receiving other services from a site
selected according to the normal cell reselection procedure. Support for
multiple cells at the same time in UEs would enable sufficient eMBMS coverage
with power and/or equipment saving.
### 4.17.2 Pre-conditions
User A wants to watch the news using eMBMS while use the UE for other data
services at the same time.
The eMBMS service is broadcasted from a larger macro cell in the area,
covering the same area as multiple smaller cells.
The cell reselection procedure has select a different (smaller) cell as the
most favorable for the data traffic, while the UE is using the eMBMS service
from a large cell in the same area.
### 4.17.3 Service Flows
User A is watching the news using eMBMS while using the UE for other data
services at the same time.
### 4.17.4 Post-conditions
The user liked the service experience and is satisfied.
### 4.17.5 Potential Requirements
A UE shall be able to receive eMBMS from one cell while receiving other
services from the same cell or another cell.
## 4.18 Use Case 18: Simultaneous use of any LTE services from one network and
TV service from another network
### 4.18.1 Description
A content provider has an agreement with MNO A to broadcast a TV service to
all users in a certain geographical area. The users do not need to have a
subscription with MNO A in order to be able to receive the service so MNOs
have agreed that UEs subscribed to one network shall be able to receive
certain eMBMS services from another network.
One use case is eMBMS in a stadium where the stadium-related service should be
received by UEs regardless to which network they are subscribed.
### 4.18.2 Pre-conditions
MNO A's network with eMBMS is integrated into a stadium's infrastructure in
order for the stadium-related TV service to be received by UEs regardless to
which network they are subscribed.
### 4.18.3 Service Flows
Two teams are playing a soccer game. One team's forward is making the final
score.
All users in the stadium view the replay of the goal on their UEs regardless
of the network they are subscribed to.
### 4.18.4 Post-conditions
Everybody inside the arena can see the final goal in replay using eMBMS
regardless of the subscribed MNO.
### 4.18.5 Potential Requirements
An MNO shall be able to service all UEs in an area with eMBMS independent of
which MNO network(s) they have subscription to.
## 4.19 Use Case 19: Fixed Reception for TV program
### 4.19.1 Description
An MNO provides a TV service over an LTE network. A TV service consists of one
or more TV programmes and associated programme information. The TV service may
be a linear TV service, an on-demand TV service or a complementary offer of
both types. The MNO wants to make available these TV services by means of
stationary roof-top antennas in order to exploit the higher received signal
level achievable by such an antenna. For linear TV services, at least until
today fixed roof-top reception constitutes the bulk of service consumption in
many countries.
### 4.19.2 Pre-conditions
An MNO runs a TV service over an LTE eMBMS enabled network. Users have eMBMS
enabled devices, e.g. in the form of set-top boxes connected to roof-top
antennas. The TV service contains linear TV programmes or on-demand TV content
or both.
### 4.19.3 Service Flows
The MNO decides to offer both linear and on-demand TV programmes as part of
his TV service offer. The transmissions are received via fixed roof-top
antenna and passed to eMBMS-enabled devices e.g. set-top boxes or integrated
TV receivers. Users can then watch TV services e.g. on the stationary TV sets.
### 4.19.4 Post-conditions
TV programmes selected by the MNO are offered in a given area. Users are able
to receive the TV programmes, both linear and on-demand programmes, via roof-
top antennas.
### 4.19.5 Potential Requirements
The 3GPP network shall allow a UE to receive a broadcast TV content using
existing TV antenna equipment.
## 4.20 Use case 20: Hybrid TV delivery
### 4.20.1 Description
A TV content provider provides hybrid TV delivery over a digital terrestrial
TV (DTT) network and a 3GPP network run by an MNO. The most popular TV content
is delivered over the DTT network using the technology available (e.g. DVB-T).
This DTT delivery is primarily targeting fixed installations but can also be
made available to mobile devices through for instance WiFi access points. The
on demand and long tail of less popular scheduled or live content is delivered
using unicast in the 3GPP network targeting all kind of devices, while the
most popular content reaching mobile phones will be delivered in a separate
broadcast in the MNO network.
The purpose with Hybrid delivery is to optimize for cost and spectral
efficiency, by configuring the networks so that broadcast is used only when
viewing volumes motivates it. The target is to ensure highly specialised
streams for each situation that are more efficient than a combined,
compromised stream.
### 4.20.2 Pre-conditions
User A has a terminal, which is a UE with additional support for the DTT
technology. The terminal will display the TV content to the user in an
integrated way so that it is not relevant for the user to see if it is
delivered through the 3GPP system or over the DTT network.
### 4.20.3 Service Flows
User A is watching a very popular TV show and then switches to a replay of an
old show. The terminal will first receive content that are broadcasted with
the DTT technology, and then content that are transmitted over unicast to the
UE.
### 4.20.4 Post-conditions
User A will be able to receive both TV shows and will not notice the change of
delivery method.
### 4.20.5 [Potential] Requirements
The 3GPP network shall be able to deliver TV content to fixed installed TV
using unicast as part of a hybrid solution.
NOTE: It is foreseen that the TV unit integrates the different streams in
order to give the user experience as DTT reception only, but this is outside
of 3GPP scope. The decision to broadcast content over DTT or the 3GPP system
is out of 3GPP scope.
