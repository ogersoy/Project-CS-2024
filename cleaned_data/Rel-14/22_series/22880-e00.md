# Introduction
The present document studies use cases and identifies potential requirements
for a Mission Critical Data Communications (MCData service). The MCData
Service can be used for public safety and security applications and also for
general commercial applications requiring critical availability or service
level (e.g., utility companies and railways.
As far as possible, the present document will reuse principles and definitions
defined for the MCPTT service.
# 1 Scope
The present document studies use cases and identifies potential requirements
for operation of the MCData service. MCData makes use of capabilities included
in Group Communications System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE), Proximity based
Services (ProSe), and Isolated E-UTRAN Operation for Public Safety (IOPS) with
additional requirements specific to the MCData Service. The MCData Service can
be used for public safety applications and also for general commercial
applications (e.g., utility companies and railways).
As far as possible, the MCData service will reuse applicable elements from the
MCPTT service.

# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Background
The general importance of mobile data communication to mission critical
organisations has been growing over the years and, as a result, mission
critical operations have become more and more depended on mobile data
communications. In addition, thanks to the development of messaging and data
transfer in commercial mobile networks, mission critical communication users
see more and more potential in data communications. As a consequence, there is
a need to extend group communications to support different media types.
So far mission critical organisations have been using a combination of
dedicated private networks and commercial services to cover their needs. With
their increasing demands for data they now look forward to one system
providing all the required services.
## 4.2 Mission Critical Data Communication
Mission Critical Data Communication provides a set of services and mechanisms
to mission critical users to allow reliable, predictable, secure and flexible
data communications during periods of normal- and of high network load.
The services provided by Mission Critical Data Communication include secure
individual and group based text and multi-media messaging.
The mechanisms provided by Mission Critical Data Communication allow
management and monitoring of data flows and provide application dependent,
user dependent and situation dependent data priority.

## 9 Mobility
## 9.1 A complex network context
This section describes the potential interactions between private and public
networks.
### 9.1.1 Different networks
Countries are beginning to allocate frequencies for PPDR LTE networks. Indeed,
in order to achieve a coverage as wide as possible with an optimum cost
effectiveness, several strategies can be used and combined: RAN sharing using
private spectrum on a public access network, priority management with no use
of private spectrum, private networks, reuse of utilities networks etc...
As a consequence, we need to consider different kinds of networks :
\- wide area networks over a country
\- city networks
\- very local networks (an airport, a power plant...)
\- special networks (metro, trains)
Considering availability of network deployments, critical communications
organizations will need interoperability and seamless mobility between private
networks owned by different organizations and mobile public networks.
## 9.1.2 Mobility management needs
Basic needs are:
\- Seamless mobility between private and public networks.
\- Deployment of tactical and other private networks - Public safety
organizations will need to be able to use their spectrum as they want to
deploy tactical networks or larger private networks in addition to an existing
network using the same frequencies (including RAN sharing).
In addition mobility will have to be managed coherently with operational
priority management made at the application (MCXXX) level.
As far as possible, already existing mobility mechanisms should be reused.
But, there is a need for the mission critical services applications to
exchange priority information (coming from operational level) that could
influence the authorization of mobility. As a consequence roaming and mobility
should be subject to operational constraints taken into account at the mission
critical application level.
### 9.1.3 Priority management between networks, load balancing between
networks
The priority management mechanisms in MCPTT, MCData and MCVideo will allow
critical communications users to manage priority in overload situations so
that critical data is instantaneously identified according to the field
situation and transported correctly on the network through efficient priority
management mechanisms.
Overload mitigation can be achieved for example by not transmitting non-
mission critical data or by using public LTE networks as "offload" .
Overload will be managed by a policy established between the MCXXX operator of
the private mobile network and the network operator of the public mobile
network.
The need is summarized is the following figure :
Figure 9.1-1: Priority management between networks, load balancing between
networks
# 10 Considerations
## 10.1 Considerations on security
Void
## 10.2 Considerations on MCData service
MCData service shall reuse already existing data service wherever possible.
## 10.3 Considerations on MCVideo requirements in IOPS mode
The IOPS specification defines a minimum set of service. It is proposed not to
define additional IOPS services in MCVideo normative work. It is reminded that
IOPS was designed with few functionalities since the objective was to not to
leave public safety officers alone on the field in case of a technical
incident on the network. If relevant a set of service corresponding to this
objective will be defined for MCVideo and introduced in the IOPS
specification.
# 11 Potential Requirements
## 11.1 General
The MCData feasibility study has shown a real need for data group
communications. Affiliation, administration processes, definition of call
types (emergency, imminent peril, private etc..) will be very similar in
MCData and MCPTT. MCData service shall apply the common core requirements
defined in XXX
Editor's note: this paragraph will be completed as soon as the common core
requirements specification will be completed
As a consequence, in this work, we focus on the new requirements introduced in
MCData. In the normative work if requirements are specific to MCData they will
be put in MCData specification, if they are common for all mission critical
services they will be put in the common core requirements specification.
## 11.2 Consolidated requirements for new MCData services
In this section, we consider only MCData specific requirements.
### 11.2.1 Generic capabilities
MCData makes frequent use of a set of capabilities and enablers that allows
for many end user services to be built on a common foundation. Several generic
capabilities are defined for use in the MCData service. These capabilities can
be used on their own to transfer files, messages and other content or combined
with other services, through an Application, to provide complete end users
services as determined by the authorities implementing the service.
It is not intended to invent new protocols for the MCData service. Where
existing protocols exist, are efficient and are sufficient, the service should
make use of these protocols.
#### 11.2.1.1 Simple messaging capability
The simple messaging capability of the MCData service could be considered as
the base protocol carrying a limited size content payload message. This
message could be text or could be marked for extensible purposes including
short binary messages for application communication. Messaging could be one-
to-one messaging or could be group messaging.

include a content payload of at least [1000] characters of 8 bit text or [500]
characters of 16 bit text or [250] characters of 32 bit text and the necessary
character encoding information (for example to identify alphabet used).
The MCData service simple messaging capability shall provide the option to
include a content payload of at least [1000] characters of hyperlink or
interleaved text and hyper link(s) to allow subsequent access to linked
content (which may be a large file).
The MCData service simple messaging capability shall provide the option to
include a content payload of at least [1000] bytes of binary data to be used
by a local running application and the necessary addressing detail to
indentify the intended application.
Content received in a UE, addressed to a known local application that is not
yet running shall cause the UE to start the local application and pass the
content to the application. This could be used to start an application and
pass to it the initial data.
The MCData service shall provide the capability to remotely start a local
application (e.g. situational awareness). This may be through specific use of
binary payload on the simple messaging capability.
The MCData service simple messaging capability shall provide a message thread
indication so that multiple message flows can be managed independently.
[Requirement derived from use case in 5.10 and 5.11]

to provide the required quality of service in [50ms].
The MCData service shall be able to simultaneously manage multiple drones per
cell.
MCData UE in a drone may have a UE to network relay capability.
MCData service shall support management of drones at an altitude of up to 150m
above the floor.
The MCData system shall minimize the interruption to the MCData service when
an MCData UE transitions between different network modes (off network and on
network, relay and on network, relay and off network).
Editor's note: transitions between UE to network relay and on network are to
be prioritized according to use cases presented in MCVideo study item [4].
Robots identification:
The MCData service shall provide a mechanism for an authorized user to get
MCData UE (e.g. drones) identity, location in an identified area.
The MCData service shall also be able to provide characteristics (free
41ormatted information outside 3GPP scope) of an MCData UE to the authorized
user.
### 11.2.3 MCData services requirements specific to on network use
#### 11.2.3.1 Database enquiries and secured internet access
The MCData service shall support appropriate confidentiality and integrity
protection for signalling and user data.
The MCData service shall provide a mean to give different priorities to data
flow (according to the event, the group etc..).
The MCData service shall provide a mechanism to control MCData user access to
external non MCData related services (e.g. databases, websites).
### 11.2.4 MCData services requirements specific to IOPS mode
MCData service should be available in IOPS mode when possible.
## 11.3 Consolidated requirements on open interface for MCData
A standardized open interface shall be provided for access to and control of
the MCData service.
## 11.4 MC Service interworking requirements
In this document the term MCService(s) is used as a naming convention for any
and every mission critical service (e.g. MCPTT, MCVideo, MCData).
Editor's note: This document is far from complete or exhaustive in terms of
requirements but is presented now as a place to capture the input requirements
from TR 22.880 (MCData) which relate to inter MC service interworking. This
interworking will have implications for all MC services.
### 11.4.1 Groups
The MCService shall provide MCService Groups which can be defined for
independent MCService use or for common use among any combination of
MCServices (Common MCService Group). [Requirement derived from use case in
5.1]
NOTE: This is an implementation level requirement. Groups among MCServices may
be completely independent in operation but managed together to appear to the
user as a common group.
Editor's note: There is also an application level aspect to groups. It may be
best for a Group to be capable of being identified for a/any Service and for
a/any application (MCData).
### 11.4.2 Affiliation
The MCService shall provide a mechanism by which a UE can affiliate to any
Common MCService Group(s) for which the current user is authorized; both
together as a single group affiliation for all relevant MCServices and
independently by MCService. [Requirement derived from use case in 5.1]
The MCService shall provide a mechanism by which a UE can only affiliate to a
Common MCService Group(s) for MCServices which the UE is capable of
supporting.
### 11.4.3 Simultaneous non coordinated use
Except where expressly stated each MCService shall operate independently of
each other MCService. [Requirement derived from use case in 5.4]
A user shall be able to transmit on one MCService and receive on another
without service interaction limitations. [Requirement derived from use case in
5.4]
A user shall be able to transmit on different MCServices at essentially the
same time without service interaction limitations. [Requirement derived from
use case in 5.4]
A user shall be able to receive on different MCServices at essentially the
same time without service interaction limitations except where services are
competing for the same unsharable resource which may include the display,
audio transducers... [Requirement derived from use case in 5.4]
In normal use, the most recently selected MCService shall take priority over
use of contended resources. [Requirement derived from use case in 5.4]
Communication marked as Emergency shall take priority over non emergency use
of contended resources. [Requirement derived from use case in 5.4]
Any floor control facility remains completely independent for each of
simultaneous MCServices except where expressly stated. [Requirement derived
from use case in 5.4]
### 11.4.4 Simultaneous coordinated use
Any simultaneous correlated use service may be implemented as independent
services from the operational point of view but with user interface controls
making an apparently correlated service. For example a map/location service
with the capability to show the position of users might interact with a video
service so that any user might select a specific user due to their location
and send video to them. The MCVideo service does not need to be integrated
with the MCData service but the two should work together through the user
interface to operate as if they were integrated.
Editor's Note: As an alternative, the coordinated service could actually be
implemented as a combined service with different media type communication but
independent floor control where appropriate.
To support combined services where the operation is intended to be
coordinated, it shall be possible for one MCService to access and communicate
using user identifying information in use for a coordinated MCService.
[Requirement derived from use case in 5.5 and 5.6]
Editor's Note: This may be the AliasID but in any case it should be a user
identification sent in one MC service that can be accessed locally by another
MCService for the purposes of addressing that user for linked services.
To support combined services where the operation is intended to be
coordinated, it shall be possible for one MCService to access and communicate
using group definitions in use for a coordinated MCService. [Requirement
derived from use case in 5.5 and 5.6]
To support combined services where the operation is intended to be
coordinated, it shall be possible for one MCService to access and communicate
using geographic restrictions in use for a coordinated MCService. [Requirement
derived from use case in 5.5 and 5.6]
### 11.4.5 Inter MCService priority and pre-emption
Inter MCService priority is not applied at the transport layer. The transport
layer should not need to know the MCService type being utilised, furthermore
inter MCService priorities can be set on a case by case basis. This mean that
any priority treatment will be invoked within the MCService architecture and
may be implemented within the MCServices and/or by QCI/ARP actions at the
point of connection to the EPS.
[Derived from use case in 5.6]
## 11.5 Consolidated requirements on mobility, priority management, service
continuity and load balancing
### 11.5.1 Priority management
Mission critical services will jointly provide a priority management
mechanism. That is to say, the priority management shall manage all data flows
from the different mission critical services together. No mission critical
service is considered as always having priority over another.
Mission critical services shall provide each data flow with a priority based
on operational situation.
Mission critical services shall be able to support adjustments in quality of
service and delay of communications, according to operational priorities,
subject to control of an authorized user.
Mission critical services shall notify users of actions taken by the
dispatcher that result in a change in priority for a data flow.
### 11.5.2 Mobility management
The MCData system shall minimize the interruption to the MCData service when
the UE moves from one network to another taking into account that priority
management is done in the visited MCData.
Mobility shall be subject to authorization from home and visited networks
consistently with operational priority management mechanisms. The
authorization may be pre negotiated or on the fly.
### 11.5.3 Load balancing
Mission critical services shall be able to manage load balancing between
dedicated LTE networks and public LTE networks.
Note: It can be assumed that private LTE is used when possible while public
LTE may be used when no private LTE coverage is available or for lower
priority data flows while under private LTE coverage.
# 12 Conclusion and Recommendations
The Feasibility Study for Mission Critical Data Communications has analyzed
several use cases. In addition to requirements that already exist in the MCPTT
specification, potential requirements have been identified for additional
services such as remote control of unmanned vehicles, delivery notification,
IP connectivity, etc.
Taking into consideration the use cases presented in this TR and the analysis
of potential requirements in clause 11, it is recommended to proceed with
normative work.
