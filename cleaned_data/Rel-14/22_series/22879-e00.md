The present document studies use cases and identifies potential requirements
for Mission Critical Video Services over LTE (MCVideo Service). The MCVideo
Service can be used for public safety and security applications and also for
general commercial applications requiring critical availability or service
level (e.g., utility companies and railways).
As far as possible, the present documents will reuse principles and
definitions defined for the MCPTT service.
# 1 Scope
The present document studies use cases and identifies potential requirements
for operation of the MCVideo Service. MCVideo makes use of capabilities
included in Group Communications System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE), Proximity

A group of public safety workers coordinated by a dispatcher use MCPTT to
communicate when performing a rescue task. In a MCPTT group call, a safety
worker tells others what's happening around him. In addition, he wants to show
others the scene around him for more detail information, so he requests to
broadcast the live video captured by his UE to the group. After granted by the
dispatcher, the live video is broadcasted to the group until terminated by the
requestor or dispatcher. Everyone in the group receives the live video, and
participates in the group call at the same time.
The media of the live video may composes of video only or video plus audio. If
it composes of video plus audio, the audio should not have negative impact on
the MCPTT user experience, e.g. the audio of the live video broadcast should

## 5\. 26 MCVideo Video processing
### 5.26.1 Description
An incident commander Johnson is controlling the deployment of police officers
at a large football match. There is the potential for fights occurring between
supporters of the different football teams. Police officers are deployed in
riot gear. There are also a few high-resolution cameras deployed to oversee
the crowd.
### 5.26.2 Pre-conditions
Each police officer in the riot squat has a body cam with a MCVideo UE to
upload realtime video via a wireless link.
The high resolution cameras are equipped with a MCVideo UE to upload realtime
video via a wireless link.
Incident commander Johnson is equipped with a MCVideo UE with a large viewing
area (e.g. tablet).
The MCVideo system is providing video services for the MCVideo users.
The MCVideo system is equipped with server-based video processing facilities,
to e.g. combine, or enlarge, adapt size and resolution, record, and make
stills of different video streams.
### 5.26.3 Service Flows
  1. Incident commander Johnson is monitoring the scene using the high-resolution cameras. To get an overview of the different cameras, incident commander Johnson has selected a mosaic overview with a small screen for each of the high-resolution cameras. The network video server combines the different video feeds into one video stream that matches the size and resolution of his tablet. This implies a significant reduction in bandwidth for each of these video feeds.
  2. Officer McClark, one of the members of the riot squat, notifies the incident commander that he sees somebody, who is preparing to throw a large piece of illegal fireworks. Incident Commander Johnson uses his tablet to select the video feed from the body camera of Officer McClark as one of the small screens in the mosaic on his screen.
  3. Using the video provided by the body camera of Officer McClark, Incident Commander Johnson identifies the particular supporter. He now switches a suitable high-resolution camera to full screen (with Officer McClarks video feed as a picture in picture). Because the resolution of the camera is much higher than needed for the tablet, Incident Commander Johnson can use a digital zoom (e.g. using tiled streaming) to zoom in on the supporter's face. He instructs the video server to take a picture of the supporter's face.
  4. The supporter throws his piece of illegal firework. It was not worth risking the safety of police officers to apprehend the supporter on the spot. However, he is identified via the picture Incident Commander Johnson has taken using the high resolution video camera and is arrested next morning.
### 5.26.4 Post-conditions
At the end of the match, Incident Commander Johnson suspends the video stream
to his MCVideo UE.
The riot squat members and the high-resolution video cameras stop transmitting
live video images.
### 5.26.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
There is only one-to-one video stream from the video server to the MCVideo UE.
This video stream is optimized for the size and resolution of the MCVideo UE.
There is no difference in the size and resolution of the video streams
depending on what is displayed (e.g. mosaic, picture in picture, zoom in).
In addition to the one-to-one video stream there needs to be a control link
between the MCVideo UE and the video server.
### 5.26.6 Potential Requirements
The MCVideo system shall have video processing capabilities (e.g. combining
different video streams through the network, provide digital zoom within a
video stream through the network, adapt the size and resolution of a video
stream to the size and resolution of the screen, record video, and make stills
of different video streams through the network).
The MCVideo system shall provide a mechanism for MCVideo user to control a
camera connected MCVideo UE subjected to relevant authorizations.
## 5.27 MCVideo Camera Discovery Use Case
### 5.27.1 Description
This use case describes a scenario where a police officer discovers the
location of video cameras, to which he does not normally have access, and is
able to change video parameters and take limited control of the cameras, in
order to redirect video to his monitoring device.
### 5.27.2 Pre-Conditions
Officer A uses a public safety UE with video reception and display
capabilities, as well as MCData transmission and reception capabilities.
Officer B uses a public safety UE with video capture and transmission
capabilities, as well as MCData transmission and reception capabilities.
Both officers A and B, are capable to access and use MCVideo and MCData
services and to establish multimedia communication with each other. Support of
location services by the two officer's UEs may also be necessary.
An initial common way of establishing communication, as well as performing
service and technological capabilities negotiation, if necessary, between
unrelated networks and devices, has to be available.
There is prior agreement between the warehouse and the police organization for
LTE access to the security system during emergencies.
### 5.27.3 Service Flows
A large warehouse exists within the area patroled by Officer A and Officer B.
Security cameras are installed within the warehouse, but they transmit their
data to a private security center, unrelated to the Public Safety agency of
Officers A and B. Therefore, the two officers do not normally have access to
the video produced by these security cameras nor do they know exactly how many
such cameras are installed and where.
An alarm goes off at the warehouse and the officers enter the warehouse to
investigate a potential burglary in progress.
The two officers separate as they mae their way through the warehouse.
Officer A wants to uses his UE to discover the location of the warehouse's
security cameras. Those cameras can be fixed or can be attached to a mobile
teethered or unteethered patrol robot. Officer A uses a "privileged guest"
persona to acces the private security system installed in the warehouse. The
access could be direct device-to-device or indirect through the private
network or through both public and private networks. A privileged guest
profile stored on the private network allows Officer A to temporarily take
(and release) partial control of the cameras in his immediate vicinty.
Location services can be employed to determine immediate vicinity.
Meanwhile, Officer B gets into a violent confrontation with the burglars and
as a result loses possession of his video capture and transmission capable UE.
Officer A is able to discover Officer B's UE and to redirect the video stream
to Officer A's UE. The communication could be direct device-to-device or
indirect through the public safety network. Location services can be employed
to determine the exact location of Officer B's UE. A special profile controls
Officer A's access and privileges, in case the human dispatcher in the public
network is bypassed.
The incident ends with several private security guards and some police backup
arriving at the scene. By then, the burglars escaped, while Officer A was
providing assitance to Officer B.
### 5.27.4 Post-conditions
Successive videos are received by Officer A from various security cameras in
his vicinity and from Officer's B UE.
Specialized video analytics software running on officer A's UE were used to
compare "earlier" and "later" images from the same fixed security camera to
determine if any objects have been added/removed to/from the scene or changed
position, as a sign of burglars' presence in that particular area.
### 5.27.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
[Location Services]{.underline}

## 5.42 MCVideo Digital Evidence Handling Use Case
### 5.42.1 Description
This use case describes a scenario where two policemen respond to a robbery
attempt at a convenience store, arriving shortly after the perpetrator has
disabled the store video camera. As the policemen attempt to disarm the
perpetrator, a scuffle ensues within close quarters during which the store
clerk receives a punch, falls to the ground hitting his head and eventually is
pronounced dead. One of the policemen's MCVideo capable UE, which he was using
as a body-worn camera, is also partly damaged during the fight.
After arresting the suspect, the authorities charge him with murder for the
death of the store clerk and decide to use as evidence the videos produced by
the two policemen's body-worn video cameras / MCVideo UEs during the incident.
The suspect claims that he has nothing to do with the death of the store
clerk, as he was only trying to flee and it was one of the policemen who
actually punched the store clerk during the melee, resulting into his fall and
eventual death. The suspect's lawyer claims further that the video produced by
the policeman whose MCVideo UE got damaged during the fight became unusable
and was replaced _post factum_ by a video made the following day in a similar
store at a different location and showing a re-enactment of the events
favourable to the policemen's version of the events. As a result it could not
be correlated with the video produced by the other body-worn camera and should
be excluded.
### 5.42.2 Pre-Conditions
An operator offers a service, which makes use of MCVideo features.
Both police officers obtain the MCVideo service from that operator.
Both police officers are in possession of MCVideo capable UEs.
The MCVideo Server can provide or facilitate the provision of security keys
and initial cryptographic nonces to the MCVideo Capable UEs via secure
channels.
The MCVideo UEs can communicate bidirectionally with each other via secure
channels directly or indirectly (i.e. via the MCVideo server).
The incident occurs within an E-UTRAN coverage area.
The police officers have configured their MCVideo capable UEs to function as
body-worn video camera.
### 5.42.3 Service Flows
The police officers activate the video recorder at their MCVideo capable UEs
prior to engaging the suspect.
The two cameras independently record the events, each from a different angle.
Internally, each video is divided in blocks of roughly same length that are
integrity protected via MAC codes generated with different keys chain
generated based on security tokens received from the other UE.
The two cameras exchange security tokens over a secure link after integrity
protecting each block, with each token that is used by one UE being (derived
from) an integrity protecting MAC built over the previously generated video
block of bits from the other UE's video.
> NOTE: This security technique is sometimes referred to as "linked time-
> stamping" and is a form of co-recursive hash cross-chaining.
As part of being a UE, each device (acting as video camera) receives system
broadcast information from the LTE systems. The unique ECGI of the serving or
of the "camped on" cell is used by each UE in lieu of cryptographic "salt" to
generate the security tokens.
The recording application embeds the integrity protecting MACs at the end of
each block as data within the video.
The police officers de-activate their respective video recorders at the end of
the incident.
### 5.42.4 Post-conditions
The court-appointed video security third-party expert states that the
procedures for handling and storing evidentiary material are compliant with
FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) requirements for securing
data and there is no indication that those procedures were not followed.
The court-appointed video security third-party expert states that the security
mechanisms used by the police department are appropriate, including the
security algorithms used, the generation, storage and distribution of keys,
and the communication channels between the parties.
The court-appointed video security third-party expert states that she has not
seen any signs of tampering, any mismatch between the videos or any indication
that the challenged video has been made at a different location.
The court-appointed video security third-party expert explains that each block
of bits in the videos is integrity protected via a securely generated MAC,
which matches the result that can be obtained by re-computing the MAC using
the expected parameters, therefore no block has been modified after the
corresponding MAC was generated.
The court-appointed video security third-party expert explains that the
timestamp linking algorithm used to generate the MACs and the exchanged tokens
prove that no blocks of data are missing from either video, or out of order,
and that the two videos were produced at the same time. This finding refutes
the possibility of a later re-enactment of events in order to re-create the
impeached video.
The court-appointed video security third-party expert further states that the
MAC codes and the tokens used were generated for both video using as
cryptographic salt the same ECGI of the closest LTE cell that provides
coverage to the crime scene, timestamps within the time interval of the
incident and proper identifiers of each respective device and subscription.
All this data is consistent with the two videos being produced at the same
location, by the proper subscribers, at the claimed time and using the claimed
devices.
Based on the analysis and statements of the court-appointed video security
third-party expert, the challenge to the impeached video is rejected, and the
video is declared admissible evidence.
### 5.42.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features

information generated based on securely communicated data from the MCVideo
server can be embedded in created videos and subsequently integrity protected,
at the time of the video creation by the MCVideo capable UE.
The MCVideo service shall provide the ability for MCVideo server and MCVideo
capable UEs to exchange MCData among themselves via secure links during the
creation of videos.
The MCVideo capable UEs shall be able to use location, time, subscription
identity, device identity and information provided from outside the UE to
generate and use security data for videos created by the UE.

## 9 Mobility
## 9.1 A complex network context
This section describes the potential interactions between private and public
networks.
### 9.1.1 Different networks
Countries are beginning to allocate frequencies for PPDR LTE networks. Indeed,
in order to achieve a coverage as wide as possible with an optimum cost
effectiveness, several strategies can be used and combined: RAN sharing using
private spectrum on a public access network, priority management with no use
of private spectrum, private networks, reuse of utilities networks etc...
As a consequence, we need to consider different kinds of networks :
  * wide area networks over a country
  * city networks
  * very local networks (an airport, a powerplant...)
  * special networks (metro, trains)
Considering availability of network deployments, critical communications
organizations will need interoperability and seamless mobility between private
networks owned by different organizations and mobile public networks.
## 9.1.2 Mobility management needs
Basic needs are:
  * Seamless mobility between private and public networks.
  * Deployment of tactical and other private networks - Public safety > organizations will need to be able to use their spectrum as they > want to deploy tactical networks or larger private networks in > addition to an existing network using the same frequencies > (including RAN sharing).
In addition mobility will have to be managed coherently with operational
priority management made at the application (MCXXX) level.
As far as possible, already existing mobility mechanisms should be reused.
But, there is a need for the mission critical services applications to
exchange priority information (coming from operational level) that could
influence the authorization of mobility. As a consequence roaming and mobility
should be subject to operational constraints taken into account at the mission
critical application level.
### 9.1.3 Priority management between networks, load balancing between
networks
The priority management mechanisms in MCPTT, MCDATA and MCVideo will allow
critical communications users to manage priority in overload situations so
that critical data is instantaneously identified according to the field
situation and transported correctly on the network through efficient priority
management mechanisms.
Overload mitigation can be achieved for example by not transmitting non-
mission critical data or by using public LTE networks as "offload" .
Overload will be managed by a policy established between the MCXXX operator of
the private mobile network and the network operator of the public mobile
network.
The need is summarized is the following figure :
Figure 9.1-1: Load balancing between networks
## 9.2 Mobility use case
### 9.2.1 Description
This use case aims at describing mobility use cases between different
networks.
### 9.2.2 Pre-conditions
A public safety dedicated network is deployed in Paris.
A dedicated network is deployed to cover train lines by SNCF.
A dedicated network is deployed by RATP in metro.
MNO's have deployed nationwide LTE transport network.
### 9.2.3 Service Flows
Officer Paul has seen a suspect and follows him. He is quite far from the city
and Paul is accessing his public safety service through operator's network.
The suspect drives in Paris. Since the dispatcher wants to follow the case in
priority, Paul is allocated resources for audio and video on the dedicated
network.
The suspect enters French metro. Paul is allocated resources on RATP (metro
company) network but still connected to its MCPTT/MCVIdeo/MCDATA services.
According to priority negociated at operational/application level, resources
are allocated to Paul by RATP priority manager. While the handover full
service continuity is provided in particular for real time services as far as
resources are available (access to voice, video and data group
communications).
The suspect, still followed by Paul leaves metro to take the train. SNCF
(train company) allocates resources to officer Paul still connected to its
MCPTT, MCVideo and MCDATA service, according to priorities configured at
operational/application level.
The suspect is arrested before taking the plane at the airport. Video is
transmitted through hub one (Aeroport de Paris) dedicated network.
Figure 9.2-1: Mobility use case
### 9.2.4 Post-conditions
Resources are released as soon as not useful.
### 9.2.5 Potential Impacts or Interactions with Existing Services/Features
Interactions are possible with current MCPTT mobility management.
MCPTT mobility mechanisms may have to be enhanced
### 9.2.6 Potential Requirements
The MCVideo system shall minimize the interruption to MCVideo service when the
UE moves from one network to another.
Mobility shall be subject to authorization from home and visited networks
consistently with operational priority management mechanisms. The
authorization may be pre negociated or granted on the fly.
# 10 Considerations
## 10.1 Considerations on security
Void
## 10.2 Considerations on MCvideo service
The MCVideo service shall take into account applicable regulatory
requirements, operator policies, and agency policies. The MCVideo service
shall reuse, when relevant, existing network video capabilities.
## 10.3 Considerations on MCVideo requirements in IOPS mode
The IOPS specification defines a minimum set of service. It is proposed not to
define additional IOPS services in MCVideo normative work. It is reminded that
IOPS was designed with few functionalities since the objective was to not to
leave public safety officers alone on the field in case of a technical
incident on the network. If relevant a set of service corresponding to this
objective will be defined for MCVideo and introduced in the IOPS
specification.
# 11 Potential requirements
## 11.1 General
The MCVideo feasibility study has shown a real need for video group
communications. Affiliation, administration processes, definition of call
types (emergency, imminent peril, private etc..) will be very similar in
MCVideo and MCPTT. Considering the use cases provided in this technical
report, we can propose some general principles in order to extend relevant
requirements from MCPTT to MCVideo. The detailed work for each requirement
will have to be done in the normative work.
  * Affiliation process: there is a need to define affiliation process on a per service basis to ensure a maximum granularity
  * Reuse of user profile: there is a need for user identification as for MCPTT. MCPTT user profile can be extended with relevant items for MCVideo.
  * Floor control: The normative work will have to determine if floor control is the best way to meet user requirements.
## 11.2 Consolidated requirements
In this section, we consolidate requirements that can not be taken from MCPTT.
The reuse of MCPTT requirements is part of the normative work.
NOTE: Requirements are taken from the use case, they may not cover all the
needs. Further work will be done in TS phase.
