# Introduction
The present document defines the IM Services Identity Module (ISIM)
application. This application resides on the UICC, an IC card specified in TS
31.101 [3]. In particular, TS 31.101 [3] specifies the application independent
properties of the UICC/terminal interface such as the physical characteristics
and the logical structure.
TS 31.101 [3] is one of the core documents for this specification and is
therefore referenced in many places in the present document.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the ISIM application for access to IMS services.
The present document specifies:
\- specific command parameters;
\- file structures;
\- contents of EFs (Elementary Files);
\- security functions;
\- application protocol to be used on the interface between UICC (ISIM) and
Terminal.
This is to ensure interoperability between an ISIM and Terminal independently
of the respective manufacturer, card issuer or operator.
The present document does not define any aspects related to the administrative
management phase of the ISIM. Any internal technical realisation of either the
ISIM or the Terminal is only specified where these are reflected over the
interface. The present document does not specify any of the security
algorithms that may be used.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions that, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication and/or
edition number or version number) or non‑specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

The EF shall contain at least one byte. Further bytes may be included, but if
the EF includes an optional byte, then it is mandatory for the EF to also
contain all bytes before that byte. Other services are possible in the future
and will be coded on further bytes in the EF. The coding falls under the
responsibility of the 3GPP.
Coding:
1 bit is used to code each service:\ bit = 1: service available;\ bit = 0:
service not available.
\- Service available means that the ISIM has the capability to support the
service and that the service is available for the user of the ISIM.\ Service
not available means that the service shall not be used by the ISIM user, even
if the ISIM has the capability to support the service.

# 5 Application protocol
The requirements stated in the corresponding section of TS 31.101 [3] apply to
the ISIM application.
The procedures listed in subclause \"ISIM management procedures\" are required
for execution of the procedures in the subsequent subclause \"ISIM security
related procedures\". The procedures authentication procedure, IMPI request,
IMPU request and SIPdomain request, which are listed in subclause \"ISIM
security related procedures\" are mandatory. If an ISIM Service table is
available, the additional procedures are only executable if these services are
indicated as \"service available\" in the ISIM Service table. However, if the
procedures are implemented, it shall be in accordance with subclause \" ISIM
security related procedures\".
## 5.1 ISIM management procedures
### 5.1.1 Initialisation
#### 5.1.1.1 ISIM application selection
If the Terminal wants to engage in IMS operation, then after UICC activation
(see TS 31.101 [3]), the Terminal shall select an ISIM application, if an ISIM
application is listed in the EF~DIR~ file, using the SELECT by DF name as
defined in TS 31.101 [3].
After a successful ISIM application selection, the selected ISIM (AID) is
stored on the UICC. This application is referred to as the last selected ISIM
application. The last selected ISIM application shall be available on the UICC
after a deactivation followed by an activation of the UICC.
If a ISIM application is selected using partial DF name, the partial DF name
supplied in the command shall uniquely identify a ISIM application.
Furthermore if a ISIM application is selected using a partial DF name as
specified in TS 31.101 [3] indicating in the SELECT command the last
occurrence the UICC shall select the ISIM application stored as the last ISIM
application. If, in the SELECT command, the options first, next/previous are
indicated, they have no meaning if an application has not been previously
selected in the same session and shall return an appropriate error code.
#### 5.1.1.2 ISIM initialisation
The ISIM shall not indicate any language preference. It shall use the language
indicated by any other application currently active on the UICC or by default,
choose a language from EF~PL~ at the MF level according the procedure defined
in TS 31.101 [3].
If the terminal does not support the languages of EF~PL~, then the terminal
shall use its own internal default selection.
The Terminal then runs the user verification procedure. If the procedure is
not performed successfully, the ISIM initialisation stops.
Then the Terminal performs the administrative information request.
If all these procedures have been performed successfully then the ISIM session
shall start. In all other cases the ISIM session shall not start.
After the previous procedures have been completed successfully, the Terminal
runs the following procedures:
\- IMPI request.
\- IMPU request.
\- SIP Domain request.
\- ISIM Service Table request. If the ISIM Service Table is not present, the
terminal shall assume that no optional services are available.
\- P-CSCF address request
After the ISIM initialisation has been completed successfully, the Terminal is
ready for an ISIM session and shall indicate this to the ISIM by sending a
particular STATUS command.
### 5.1.2 ISIM Session termination
NOTE 1: This procedure is not to be confused with the deactivation procedure
in TS 31.101 [3].
The ISIM session is terminated by the Terminal as follows.
The Terminal shall indicate to the ISIM by sending a particular STATUS command
that the termination procedure is starting.
Finally, the ME deletes all these subscriber related information elements from
its memory.
NOTE 2: If the Terminal has already updated any of the subscriber related
information during the ISIM session, and the value has not changed until ISIM
session termination, the Terminal may omit the respective update procedure.
To actually terminate the session, the Terminal shall then use one of the
mechanisms described in TS 31.101 [3].
### 5.1.3 ISIM application closure
After termination of the ISIM session as defined in subclause 5.1.2, the ISIM
application may be closed by closing the logical channels that are used to
communicate with this particular ISIM application.
### 5.1.4 UICC presence detection
The Terminal checks for the presence of the UICC according to TS 31.101 [3]
within all 30 s periods of inactivity on the UICC-Terminal interface during a
IMS session. If the presence detection according to TS 31.101 [3] fails the
session shall be terminated as soon as possible but at least within 5s after
the presence detection has failed.
### 5.1.5 Administrative information request
The Terminal performs the reading procedure with EF~AD~.
## 5.2 ISIM security related procedures
### 5.2.1 Authentication procedure
The Terminal selects an ISIM application and uses the AUTHENTICATE command
(see subclause 7.1). The response is sent to the Terminal (in case of the T=0
protocol when requested by a subsequent GET RESPONSE command).
### 5.2.2 IMPI request
The Terminal performs the reading procedure with EF~IMPI.~
### 5.2.3 IMPU request
The Terminal performs the reading procedure with EF~IMPU.~
### 5.2.4 SIP Domain request
The Terminal performs the reading procedure with EF~DOMAIN~.
### 5.2.5 Void
### 5.2.6 ISIM Service Table request
Requirement: ISIM Service Table available in the ISIM
Request: The ME performs the reading procedure with EF~IST~.
### 5.2.7 P-CSCF address request
Requirement: ISIM Service n°1 and/or ISIM Service n°5 \"available\".
Request: The ME performs the reading procedure with EF~P-CSCF~.
### 5.2.8 Generic Bootstrapping architecture (Bootstrap)
Requirement: ISIM Service n°2 \"available\".
The Terminal uses the AUTHENTICATE command in GBA security context
(Bootstrapping Mode) (see 7.1.1). The response is sent to the Terminal.
After a successful GBA_U Procedure, the Terminal shall update the B-TID field
and the Key Life Time field in EF~GBABP.~
### 5.2.9 Generic Bootstrapping architecture (NAF Derivation)
Requirement: ISIM Service n°2 \"available\".
The Terminal shall first read EF~GBABP~. The Terminal then uses the
AUTHENTICATE command in GBA security context (NAF Derivation Mode) (see
7.1.1). The response is sent to the Terminal.
### 5.2.10 HTTP-Digest security request
Requirement: ISIM Service n°3 \"available\".
This HTTP-Digest security request does not apply for 3GPP and shall not be
used by a terminal using a 3GPP access network or a 3GPP Interworking WLAN.
### 5.2.11 NAF Key Centre Address request
Requirement: Service n°2 and service n°4 \"available\".
Request: The ME performs the reading procedure with EF~NAFKCA~.

same as Communication Control for IMS by USIM defined in TS 31.111 [31]. It is
mandatory for the ME to perform the procedures if it has indicated that it
supports Communication Control for IMS by USIM in the TERMINAL PROFILE
command.
### 5.3.3 UICC access to IMS
Requirement: Service n°10 \"available.
Request: The terminal performs the reading procedure with EF~UICCIARI~.
The procedures and command for \"UICC access to IMS\" are defined in TS 31.111
[12]. An ME supporting UICC access to IMS shall perform the reading procedure
with EF~UICCIARI~ prior to sending a registration to the IMS.
### 5.3.4 From Preferred related procedures
Requirement: service n°17 is \"available\" in the ISIM Service Table.
Request: The ME performs the reading procedure with EF~FromPreferred~. The UE
then shall use the From Preferred value in the EF~FromPreferred~ as described
in 3GPP TS 24.607 [34] subclause 4.5.2.12.
### 5.3.5 IMS Configuration Data related procedures
Requirement: service n°18 is \"available\" in the ISIM Service Table.
Request: The ME may perform the reading procedure with EF~IMSConfigData~. If
the ME performs the reading procedure with EF~IMSConfigData~, the UE shall use
the IMS Configuration Data in the EF~IMSConfigData~ as described in 3GPP TS
24.229 [32] subclause L.2.2.5.1D and 3GPP TS 24.229 [32] subclause 6.1.1.
### 5.3.6 XCAP Configuration Data related procedures

and TS 24.623 [40] subclause B.2.
## 5.4 MCPTT related procedures
Requirement: ISIM Service n°15 \"available\".
The MCPTT related procedures by ISIM are the same as MCPTT related procedures
by USIM defined in 3GPP TS 31.102 [2].
# 6 Security features
The security aspects of IMS are specified in TS 33.203 [14]. This clause gives
information related to security features supported by the ISIM with respect to
user verification and file access conditions.
## 6.1 User verification and file access conditions
The security architecture as defined in TS 31.101 [3] applies to the ISIM and
UICC with the following definitions and additions:
\- The ISIM application shall use a global key reference as PIN1 as specified
in TS 31.101 [3].
\- For access to DF~TELECOM~ the PIN shall be verified.
\- The only valid usage qualifier is \'08\' which means user authentication
knowledge based (PIN) as defined in ISO/IEC 7816‑4 [6].
# 7 ISIM Commands
The commands specified in TS 31.101 [3] are supported by ISIM, with the
restrictions identified in this clause.
## 7.1 AUTHENTICATE
### 7.1.1 Command description
The function can be used in several different contexts:
\- an IMS AKA security context during the procedure for authenticating the
ISIM to its HN and vice versa when IMS AKA authentication data are available.
The function shall be used whenever an IMS context shall be established, i.e.
when the terminal receives a challenge from the IMS. A cipher key and an
integrity key are calculated. For the execution of the command the ISIM uses
the subscriber authentication key K, which is stored in the ISIM.
\- a HTTP Digest security context, when HTTP Digest authentication data are
available. Digest authentication operations are described in IETF RFC 2617
[26].
\- a GBA_U security context, when a GBA bootstrapping procedure is requested.
In this context the function is used in two different modes:
a) Bootstrapping Mode: during the procedure for mutual authenticating of the
ISIM and the Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) and for deriving Bootstrapped
key material from the AKA run.
b) NAF Derivation Mode: during the procedure for deriving Network Application
Function (NAF) specific keys from previous bootstrapped key material.
\- a Local Key Establishment security context, when a Local Key Establishment
procedure is requested.
The function is related to a particular ISIM and shall not be executable
unless the ISIM application has been selected and activated, and the current
directory is the ISIM ADF or any subdirectory under this ADF and a successful
PIN verification procedure has been performed (see clause 5).
#### 7.1.1.1 IMS AKA security context
The ISIM first computes the anonymity key AK = f5~K~ (RAND) and retrieves the
sequence number\ SQN = (SQN ⊕ AK) ⊕ AK.
Then the ISIM computes XMAC = f1~K~ (SQN \|\| RAND \|\| AMF) and compares this
with the MAC which is included in AUTN. If they are different, the ISIM
abandons the function.
Next the ISIM verifies that the received sequence number SQN is previously
unused. If it is unused and its value is lower than SQN~MS~, it shall still be
accepted if it is among the last 32 sequence numbers generated. A possible
verification method is described in TS 33.102 [4].
NOTE: This implies that the ISIM has to keep a list of the last used sequence
numbers and the length of the list is at least 32 entries.
If the ISIM detects the sequence numbers to be invalid, this is considered as
a synchronisation failure and the ISIM abandons the function. In this case the
command response is AUTS, where:
\- _AUTS = Conc(SQN~MS~ ) \|\| MACS_ ;
\- _Conc(SQN~MS~) = SQN~MS~ ⊕ f5*~K~(RAND)_ is the concealed value of the
counter _SQN~MS~_ in the ISIM; and
\- _MACS = f1*~K~(SQN~MS~ \|\| RAND \|\| AMF)_ where:
\- _RAND_ is the random value received in the current user authentication
request;
the AMF assumes a dummy value of all zeroes so that it does not need to be
transmitted in clear in the resynchronisation message.
If the sequence number is considered in the correct range, the ISIM computes
RES = f2~K~ (RAND), the cipher key CK = f3~K~ (RAND) and the integrity key IK
= f4~K~ (RAND) and includes these in the command response. Note that if this
is more efficient, RES, CK and IK could also be computed earlier at any time
after receiving RAND.
The use of AMF is HN specific and while processing the command, the content of
the AMF has to be interpreted in the appropriate manner. The AMF may e.g. be
used for support of multiple algorithms or keys or for changing the size of
lists, see TS 33.102 [4].
#### 7.1.1.2 GBA security context (Bootstrapping Mode)
ISIM operations in GBA security context are supported if service n°2 is
\"available\".
The ISIM receives the RAND and AUTN*. The ISIM first computes the anonymity
key AK = f5~K~ (RAND) and retrieves the sequence number SQN = (SQN ⊕ AK) ⊕ AK.
The ISIM calculates IK = f4~K~ (RAND) and MAC (by performing the MAC
modification function described in TS 33.220 [25]). Then the ISIM computes
XMAC = f1~K~ (SQN \|\| RAND \|\| AMF) and compares this with the MAC
previously produced. If they are different, the ISIM abandons the function.
Then the ISIM performs the remaining checking of AUTN* as in IMS security
context. If the ISIM detects the sequence numbers to be invalid, this is
considered as a synchronisation failure and the ISIM abandons the function. In
this case the command response is AUTS, which is computed as in ISIM security
context.
If the sequence number is considered in the correct range, the ISIM computes
RES = f2~K~ (RAND) and the cipher key CK = f3~K~ (RAND).
The ISIM then derives and stores GBA_U bootstrapped key material from CK, IK
values. The ISIM also stores RAND in the RAND field of EF~GBABP~
The ISIM stores GBA_U bootstrapped key material from only one bootstrapping
procedure. The previous bootstrapped key material, if present, shall be
replaced by the new one. This key material is linked with the data contained
in EF~GBABP~ : RAND, which is updated by the ISIM and B-TID, which shall be
further updated by the ME.
NOTE: According to TS 33.220 [25], NAF-specific keys that may be stored on the
ISIM are not affected by this bootstrapping operation.
RES is included in the command response after flipping the least significant
bit.
Input:
‑ RAND, AUTN*
Output:
\- RES
> or
\- AUTS
#### 7.1.1.3 GBA security context (NAF Derivation Mode)
ISIM operations in GBA security context are supported if service n°2 is
\"available\".
The ISIM receives the NAF_ID.
The ISIM performs Ks_ext_NAF and Ks_int_NAF derivation as defined in TS 33.220
[25] using the key material from the previous GBA_U bootstrapping procedure
and the IMPI value from EF~IMPI~
If no key material is available this is considered as a GBA Bootstrapping
failure and the ISIM abandons the function. The status word \'6985\'
(Conditions of use not satisfied) is returned.
Otherwise, the ISIM stores Ks_int_NAF and associated B-TID together with
NAF_ID in its memory. The Ks_int_NAF keys related to other NAF_IDs, which are
already stored in the ISIM, shall not be affected. The ISIM updates EF~GBANL~
as follows:
\- If a record with the given NAF_ID already exists, the ISIM updates the
B-TID field of this record with the B-TID value associated to the GBA_U
bootstrapped key involved in this GBA_U NAF derivation procedure.
\- If a record with the given NAF_ID does not exist, the ISIM uses an empty
record to store the NAF_ID and the B-TID value associated to the GBA_U
bootstrapped key involved in this GBA_U NAF Derivation procedure.
NOTE: According to TS 33.220 [25], the ISIM can contain several Ks_int_NAF
together with the associated B-TID and NAF_ID, but there is at most one pair
of Ks_int_NAF and associated B-TID stored per NAF_ID.
\- In case no empty record is available the ISIM shall overwrite an existing
record to store the NAF_ID and the B-TID value associated to the GBA_U
bootstrapped key involved in this GBA_U NAF Derivation procedure. To determine
the record to overwrite, the ISIM shall construct a list of record numbers by
storing in the list first position the record number of the last used (i.e.
involved in an Authentication command) or derived Ks_int_NAF and by shifting
down the remaining list elements. The last record number in this list
corresponds to the record to overwrite when the ISIM runs out of free records.
If an existing record corresponding to a Ks_int_NAF key in use is overwritten,
the application Ks_int_NAF shall not be affected.
Then, the ISIM returns Ks_ext_NAF.
Input:
‑ NAF_ID
Output:

#### 7.1.1.4 HTTP-Digest security context
ISIM operations in HTTP-Digest security context are supported if service n°3
is \"available\".
#### 7.1.1.5 Local Key Establishment security context (Key Derivation mode)
ISIM operations in this security context are supported if service n°2 and
service n°4 are \"available\".
The ISIM receives the NAF_ID corresponding to the NAF Key Centre, the
Terminal_ID, the Terminal_appli_ID, the UICC_appli_ID, RANDx, the Counter
Limit value and the MAC as described in TS 33.110 [28].
The ISIM uses the NAF_ID to identify the Ks_int_NAF associated to the NAF Key
Centre. If no valid Ks_int_NAF is available, this is considered as a Key
Establishment failure and the ISIM abandons the function. The status word
\'6A88\' (Referenced data not found) is returned.
If the Ks_local key derivation is not authorized by the local UICC policy
(e.g. Terminal_appli_ID/UICC_appli_ID association not authorized or
Terminal_ID value not authorized), the ISIM abandons the function. The status
word \'6985\' (Conditions of use not satisfied) is returned.
Otherwise, the ISIM retrieves the appropriate Ks_int_NAF, derives Ks_local as
described in TS 33.110 [28]. The ISIM verifies the MAC value received from the
Terminal as described in TS 33.110 [28]:
\- If the verification is unsuccessful, the ISIM abandons the function and
returns the status word \'9862\' (Authentication error, incorrect MAC).
\- If the verification is successful, the ISIM stores Ks_local and associated
parameters Terminal_ID, Terminal_appli_ID, UICC_appli_ID, RANDx and the
Ks_local Counter Limit. The ISIM returns the Local Key Establishment Operation
Response TLV (indicating a successful Key Derivation operation) and a response
MAC, which is derived as described in TS 33.110 [28].
The minimum number of Local keys that can be stored by the ISIM shall be
defined by the service provider at the pre-issuance of the card.
In case the maximum number of Local Key was already reached or there is not
enough available memory in the ISIM, the ISIM shall overwrite a Local Key and
its associated data in order to store the new one. To determine the Ks_local
to overwrite, the ISIM shall construct a list of Ks_local identifiers by
storing in the list first position the Ks_local identifier of the last used or
derived Ks_local and by shifting down the remaining list elements. The last
Ks_local identifier in this list corresponds to the Ks_local to overwrite when
the ISIM runs out of free memory or when the maximum number of Ks_local keys
is reached. If an existing Ks_local in use is overwritten, the application
using Ks_local shall not be affected.
Input:
Local Key Establishment Mode (Key Derivation mode), Counter Limit, request
MAC, Key Identifier (i.e. NAF_ID, Terminal_ID, Terminal_appli_ID,
UICC_appli_ID, RANDx)
Output:
\- Key Derivation operation status, response MAC.
#### 7.1.1.6 Local Key Establishment security context (Key Availability Check
mode)
ISIM operations in this security context are supported if service n°2 and
service n°4 are \"available\".
The ISIM receives a Ks_local identifier. The ISIM checks if a corresponding
valid Ks_local is available. If a valid Ks_local key is available the Local
Key Establishment Operation Response TLV (indicating a successful Key
Availability Check operation) is returned. In case no valid Ks_local key is
available the command fails and the status word \'6A88\' (Referenced data not
found) is returned.
Input:
Local Key Establishment Mode (Key Availability Check mode), Key identifier
(i.e. NAF_ID, Terminal_ID, Terminal_appli_ID, UICC_appli_ID, RANDx).
Output:
\- Key Availability Check Operation Status.
### 7.1.2 Command parameters and data
This command can be used with an EVEN or an ODD instruction (INS) code. The
EVEN instruction code can be used when the challenge data provided by the
terminal is not TLV encapsulated data and the length of the challenge data
provided by the terminal is less than 256 bytes.
The ODD instruction code shall be used with the security context specified in
table 1, when challenge and response data is TLV encapsulated regardless of
their length. Terminals and UICCs that do not support security context
requiring TLV format (e.g. for Local Key Establishment), do not have to
support AUTHENTICATE command with ODD instruction code.
