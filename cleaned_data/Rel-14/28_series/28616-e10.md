# 1 Scope
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named
Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access Interworking System Network
Resource Model (NRM) IRP, through which an IRPAgent can communicate
configuration management information to one or several IRPManagers concerning
EPC and non-3GPP access interworking system resources. The EPC and non-3GPP
access Interworking System NRM IRP comprises a set of specifications defining
requirements, a protocol neutral information service and one or more solution
sets.
The present document specifies the solution sets for the EPC and non-3GPP
access interworking system NRM IRP.
This solution set specification is related to 3GPP TS 28.612 V14.0.X [4].

###### ## Annex B (normative): XML definitions
# B.0 General
This annex contains the XML definitions for the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and
non-3GPP access interworking system NRM IRP as it applies to Itf-N, in
accordance with Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access interworking
system NRM IRP IS definitions in 3GPP TS 28.612 [4].
The XML file formats are based on XML [9], XML Schema [10] [11] and XML
Namespace [12] standards.
# B.1 Architectural features
## B.1.0 Introduction
The overall architectural feature of Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP
access interworking system Network Resources IRP is specified in 3GPP TS
28.612 [4].
This clause specifies features that are specific to the schema definitions.
The XML definitions in the present document specify the schema for a
configuration content.
When using the XML definitions for a configuration file transfer with the Bulk
CM IRP, using either CORBA solution set of 3GPP TS 32.616 [7] or SOAP Solution
Set of 3GPP TS 32.616 [7], the basic part of the XML file format definition is
provided by 3GPP TS 32.616 [7]. The XML definitions in the present document
provide the schema for the configuration content to be included in such a
configuration file.
When using the XML definitions with a SOAP solution set of any interface IRP
that perform operations on managed objects, for example the Basic CM IRP SOAP
SS of 3GPP TS 32.606 [6], the XML definitions in the present document provide
the schema for the configuration content operated on by the interface IRP.\
Such configuration content can be name of managed object and, if applicable,
IOC attributes.
## B.1.1 Syntax for Distinguished Names
The syntax of a Distinguished Name is defined in 3GPP TS 32.300 [5].
# B.2 Mapping
## B.2.1 General mapping
An IOC maps to an XML element of the same name as the IOC\'s name in the IS.
An IOC attribute maps to a sub-element of the corresponding IOC\'s XML
element, and the name of this sub-element is the same as the attribute\'s name
in the IS.
## B.2.2 Information Object Class (IOC) mapping
The mapping is not present in the current version of this specification.
# B.3 Solution set definitions
## B.3.1 XML definition structure
The overall description of the file format of configuration data XML files is
provided by 3GPP TS 32.616 [7].
Annex B.3.3 of the present document defines the NRM-specific XML schema
EPCn3aINrm.xsd for the \"**Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access
interworking system** NRM IRP IS\" defined in 3GPP TS 28.612 [4].
XML schema EPCn3aINrm.xsd explicitly declares NRM-specific XML element types
for the related NRM.
The definition of those NRM-specific XML element types complies with the
generic mapping rules defined in 3GPP TS 32.616 [7].
## B.3.2 Graphical representation
The graphical representation is not present in the current version of this
specification.
