# 1 Scope
The document describes the requirements for Home NodeB Subsystem (HNS), which
includes Home NodeB (HNB) and Home NodeB gateway (HNB GW). The HNS NRM IRP
requirements are targeted on both HNB and HNB GW NRM.

# 4 Concepts and background
HNB Subsystem is defined in TS 23.060 [6]. According to the definition, a HNB
subsystem consists of a HNB and a HNB GW. The HNB Subsystem appears as an RNS
to the core network and is connected by means of the Iu-CS interface to the
MSC and by means of the Iu-PS interface to the SGSN.
Detailed functions of HNB and HNB GW are described in TS 25.467 [7]. To be
more specific, HNB is a Customer Premise Equipment that offers the Uu
Interface to the UE. It provides RAN connectivity and supports RNC like
functions as well as UE registration over Iuh. HNB Gateway (HNB-GW) terminates
Iuh from HNB and appears as an RNC to the existing Core network using existing
Iu interface. It supports HNB registration and UE registration over Iuh.
Based on the above characteristics, this specification defines respective HNS
NRM IRP requirements.
# 5 Requirements
The following general and high-level requirements apply for the present IRP:
a) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.101 [2].
b) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.102 [3].
c) IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.600 [4].
The NRM defined by this IRP:
d) Shall support communications for telecommunication network management
purposes, including management of converged networks.
e) Is a member of the Federated Network Information Model (FNIM) [8] and its
information is derived from FNIM Umbrella Information Model (UIM) [9]
In addition to the above, the following more specific requirements apply:
**REQ-HNS_GW-CON-001** The Network Resource Model defined by this IRP shall
contain HNB GW specific IOCs and related definitions.
**REQ-HNS_GW-CON-002** The Network Resource Model defined by this IRP shall
provide support for enabling consistency between HNB GW, HNB and related core
network nodes.
**REQ-HNS_GW-CON-003** The NRM specified by this IRP shall be able to view
configuration information of the HNB GW entity. More detailed information is
as follows:
Shall allow for the viewing of basic configuration information including
version, equipment type, equipment provider and unique identification, etc.
Shall allow for the viewing of network configuration information including IP
address, sub-network mask, default gateway and port configuration information,
etc.
Shall allow for the viewing of service related configuration information, for
example the maximum number of HNB to be registered, the maximum number of
packets to be forwarded, etc.
**REQ-HNS_GW-CON-004** The NRM specified by this IRP shall capture Iuh
interface information of HNB GW. More detailed information is as follows:
Shall allow for the viewing of basic configuration information including Iuh
identification etc.
Shall allow for the viewing of network configuration information including
SCTP management information, etc.
**REQ-HNS_GW-CON-005** The NRM specified by this IRP shall capture the
identity of registered HNB.
