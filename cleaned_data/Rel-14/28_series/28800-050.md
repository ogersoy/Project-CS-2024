# Introduction
The Study on management and orchestration architecture of next generation
networks and services is to align the next generation management architecture
with consideration of support the next generation management functions.
Studying the management and orchestration architecture will evaluate whether
the existing management mechanisms can be applicable or need to be enhanced to
support the next generation management and orchestration features.
# 1 Scope
The study investigates and makes recommendations on management and
orchestration architecture of next generation networks and services which
includes:
  * **The terminology associated with management and orchestration of** next generation **networks and services.**
  * The use cases on the management and orchestration architecture from the output of other next generation management functional studies (e.g. management and orchestration of network slicing, management of next generation features, service management and orchestration, etc.).
  * The use cases that may impact the management and orchestration architecture which are not addressed by functional studies.
  * The management and orchestration architecture to support network operational features such as real-time, on demand, automation etc. as evolution from LTE management.
  * The management and orchestration architecture to support vertical applications (e.g. management architecture support to the V2X, critical communications etc.) in the next generation network based on the other management functional studies.
  * The management and orchestration architecture to support the scenario in which the applications are hosted close to the access network based on the other management functional studies.
  * The management and orchestration architecture to support management and orchestration aspect of E2E user services in the next generation network based on the other management functional studies.
  * Investigate whether the existing 3GPP management architecture can be reused, or needs to be enhanced.
  * Take into consideration the outcome on next generation network architecture and study the potential management and orchestration architecture aspects of the end to end architecture.

# 4 Management architecture introduction
The management system of next generation network will include the management
features of the network, the network slicing instances and slice subnet
instances etc.
The next generation network may be composed of virtualized network elements
and non-virtualized network elements, the management of next generation
network may make use of the management of the virtualized network functions.
The management of the network element may include the network function
management and resource management.
For the management of the virtualized network elements, the virtualized
resource of the network element is managed as specified by ETSI NFV. The
network functions are managed by network management function as specified by
3GPP. The management of virtualized core network nodes in LTE is supported in
Rel-14.
For the management of the non-virtualized network elements, both network
function and network resource is managed by network management function as
specified by 3GPP.
The next generation network may also include LTE nodes, ref. [6].
If an evolution of the LTE management system is chosen, the following needs to
be done to get basic management standards for NR and LTE. Management of new
functions will need enhancement of the LTE management systems.
  1. New NRMs (object models) are needed for the radio access network and core network for the next generation network.
  2. New measurement specifications are needed for NR features and nodes.
  3. The existing 3GPP management specifications needs to be checked for which functions will be supported in the first release of the next generation network (e.g. with respect to features like trace and MDT).
New features like Network Slicing and virtualised functions which are part of
RAN may need new management features/support.
# 5 Use cases related to management and orchestration architecture
## 5.1 Management and orchestration of networks containing non-5G NE and 5G NE
### 5.1.1 Introduction
This use case highlights potential management options/scenarios for possible
network deployments, specifically at the early stages of introducing 5G
network elements along with existing non-5G generation 3GPP network(s).
Operator wants to manage a network containing both non-5G NE(s) and 5G NE(s).
### 5.1.2 Pre-conditions
The network contains non-5G NE(s) and 5G NE(s).
The non-5G NE(s) are managed by existing management functions.
### 5.1.3 Description
There are following scenarios for operator to manage the 5G NE functions.
1\. Operator enhances the existing management and orchestration function to
manage both 5G NE(s) and non-5G NE(s). For example, operator may enhance the
fault management function to retrieve the faults information from both non-5G
NE and 5G NE, or
2\. Operator creates new management functions to manage both 5G NE and non-5G
NE. For example, operator may create new management function to manage the
next generation network feature massive Internet of Things.
### 5.1.4 Post-conditions
The non-5G network elements and 5G network elements are both managed.
## 5.2 Use case of management and orchestration architecture for network
slicing
### 5.2.1 Introduction
The operator wants to manage the next generation network slice instances; thus
the management architecture needs to provide the corresponding support.
### 5.2.2 Pre-conditions
The requirements on the network slicing management are available.
### 5.2.3 Description
Refer to the network slicing management use cases specified in TR 28.801[x].
### 5.2.4 Post-conditions
The management architecture can support the network slicing management
requirements.
