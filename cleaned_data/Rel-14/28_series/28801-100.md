# Introduction
The network slicing is a key feature for the next generation network. It is
about transforming the network/system from a static "one size fits all"
paradigm, to a new paradigm where logical networks/partitions are created,
with appropriate isolation, resources and optimized topology to serve a
particular purpose or service category (e.g. use case/traffic category, or for
internal reasons) or even individual customers (logical system created "on
demand"). It can be enriched by use of NFV and SDN.
The network slicing concept consists of 3 layers: 1) Service Instance Layer,
2) Network Slice Instance Layer, and 3) Resource layer where each layer
requires management functions, see reference 3GPP TR 23.799 [2]. This document
specifies use cases for management of network slicing, potential requirements,
potential solutions and recommendations.
# 1 Scope
**The study investigates and makes recommendations on management and
orchestration for network slicing on the** Network Slice Instance Layer [2]
and for non virtualised NE's also the Resource layer**:**
1) Use cases and requirements for management and orchestration of network
slicing
2) Management and orchestration terminology and concepts for slices. The
relationship between network slice management and orchestration concepts
developed in this study and the management and orchestration concepts defined
by ETSI NFV.
3) Management of network function sharing in the context of network slicing
(e.g. network function sharing support, and lifecycle management functions of
the of mobile network resources for network slices).
4) Impacts to management when a slice instance is shared between multiple
parties (e.g. multiple partners and multiple domains etc.) based on the slice
sharing, see reference 3GPP TR 23.799 [2].
5) Isolation of management data between different parties within a slice
instance if needed.
6) Impacts derived from Management of 3GPP Network Slices on the ETSI MANO
architecture and procedures will be coordinated with ETSI.
7) Automation of management and orchestration of network slice instances and
the related policy configurations.
8) Management and orchestration mechanisms to support the isolation/separation
of mobile network resources used by different network slice instances and the
corresponding configuration of isolation/separation.
9) Solution for management and orchestration of network slicing and how it
affects the specifications (e.g. Interface IRPs, Network Resource models and
trace specifications).
Furthermore the 3GPP role for Service Instance Layer has been investigated.
The Resource layer for VNFs is excluded from this study.

# 4 Concepts and Background
## 4.1 Network Slice Instance (NSI) lifecycle
A Network Slice Instance (NSI) is a managed entity in the operator's network
with a lifecycle independent of the lifecycle of the service instance(s). In
particular, the service instances are not necessarily active through the whole
duration of the run-time phase. The NSI lifecycle typically includes an
instantiation, configuration and activation phase, a run-time phase and a
decommissioning phase. During the NSI lifecycle the operator needs to manage
the NSI.
The lifecycle of a network slice is described by the following phases:
  * Preparation phase
  * Instantiation, Configuration and Activation phase
  * Run-time phase
  * Decommissioning phase
Figure 4.1-1: Lifecycle phases of a NSI
Each phase defines high level tasks and should include appropriate
verification of the output of each task in the phase.
Preparation phase
In the preparation phase the NSI does not exist. The preparation phase
includes the creation and verification of network slice blueprint(s) [5], the
onboarding of these, preparing the necessary network environment which are
used to support the lifecycle of NSIs and any other preparations that are
needed in the network.
Instantiation, Configuration and Activation phase
During instantiation/configuration all resources shared/dedicated to the NSI
have been created and are configured, i.e. to a state where the NSI is ready
for operation. The activation step includes any actions that makes the NSI
active, e.g. diverting traffic to it, provisioning databases (if dedicated to
the network slice, otherwise this takes place in the preparation phase) etc.
Network slice instantiation, configuration and activation can include
instantiation, configuration and activation of other common and/or specific
network function(s).
Run-time phase
In the run-time phase the NSI is capable of traffic handling to support
communication services of certain type(s). The run-time phase includes
supervision/reporting (e.g. for KPI monitoring), as well as activities related
to upgrade and reconfiguration. Reconfiguration could map to several workflows
related to runtime tasks, e.g. scaling up capacity and moving network
functions.
Decommissioning phase
The decommissioning phase includes deactivation (taking the NSI out of active
duty) as well as the termination of dedicated resources and removal of
configuration of shared/dependent resources. After decommissioning the NSI
does not exist anymore.
## 4.2 Network slice concepts
Some of the concepts of a network slice are:
  * A NSI may be fully or partly, logically and/or physically, isolated > from another NSI.
  * The NSI contains NFs (e.g. belonging to AN and CN) as well as all > information relevant to the interconnections between these NFs > like topology of connections, individual link requirements (e.g. > QOS attributes), etc. The management of TN is out of scope of 3GPP > and takes into account topology of required connections and > individual requirements specified in 3GPP NSI.
  * The resources comprises of physical and logical resources.
  * The NSI is defined by a Network Slice Template.
  * Editor's note: the relation between NST and NSI is FFS.
  * Instance-specific policies and configurations are required when > creating a NSI.
  * Network characteristics examples are ultra-low-latency, > ultra-reliability etc.
  * NSI contains Core Network part and Access Network part.
Information model attached to network slices:
Assumption No. 1: a NSI may support zero or more communication services
Assumption No. 2: a communication service may be served by one or more (e.g.
in case of service bundle) NSIs, possibly of different network slice types.
Assumption No. 3: A NSI may be composed of subnets of Physical Network
Functions and/or Virtualized Network Functions.
Assumption No. 4: Physical Network Functions and Virtualized Network Functions
may belong to one or more network slice subnet(s).
Assumption No. 5: Virtualized Network Functions are deployed on top of
virtualized resources.

**Figure 4.2-1: Network Slice related information model.**
> NOTE 1: Figure 4.2-1 is not a Network Resource Model IRP IS class diagram.
Editor's note 1: Mapping the concepts of Figure 4.2-1 on ETSI ISG NFV concepts
is FFS.
Editor's note 2: it is FFS both: a/ whether a Network Function can have a
direct participation in a Network Slice, and/or b/ whether a Network Function
can have a participation in a Network Slice as part of a Network Slice Subnet
(refer to: Description of Network Slicing Concept by NGMN Alliance - Figure
1).
Editor's note 3: It is FFS whether there is an inheritance relationship
between Network Slice and Network Slice Subnet.
## 4.3 Network slice subnet concepts
Some of the concepts of a network slice subnet are:
  * A network slice subnet instance (NSSI) may be shared by one or more > network slices instances.
  * Examples of a NSSI may be a NSSI containing Core Network functions, > a NSSI containing Access Network functions, or a NSSI containing > both Core Network functions and Access Network functions.
  * The resources comprise physical and logical resources.
  * A NSSI may contain other NSSIs.
  * According to Annex B.1 in [2], a NSI may be composed of none, one > or more NSSIs, which may be shared with another NSI.
Editor's note 1: the relevance of how a NSSI is created is for FFS
Editor's note 2: the question if logical resources are also virtual resources
is for FFS
Editor's note 3: whether a network slice subnet is required to form a complete
logical network is FFS
Editor's note 4: relation between life cycle management of the NSI and NSSI is
FFS.
A NSSI constituent can include NF(s) and NSSI(s).
## 4.4 SON concepts in network slicing
**To improve the operational sustainability in 5G, SON concepts, as key
enabler which were introduced in 4G, may be reused for 5G. Evolution to 5G may
bring increased network dimension and complexity, especially considering the
multiple services/devices/tenants in 5G networks. In this context, operators
may want to use concepts of SON as key feature to leverage 5G network slicing
management.**
The lifecycle phases of NSI typically include preparation phase,
instantiation, configuration and activation phase, run-time phase and
decommissioning phase. During the lifecycle phases of NSI, applying certain
SON concepts would be helpful to achieve the automation for management and
orchestration of NSIs.
The main aspects of SON concepts that can potentially be leveraged for network
slicing management include:
  * NSI Self-Optimization. The NSIs can be modified automatically and > continually adapted to the service/network/network function > situations like traffic, topology, etc. The status of the target > NSIs is monitored, including the status of network functions and > services. Examples of parameters to be monitored at the network > functions and also for the services are throughput, latency, the > number of connections, etc. The management system may configure > some slice-specific parameters for the NSIs to get a better > performance of network slicing. For example, based on SON outputs, > the management system may re-configure the links between some > network functions to modify the topology of the NSI for > improvement in resource utilization.
  * NSI Self-Healing. For the running NSIs, SON algorithms could > identify the failures of NSIs and apply some corrective actions. > The network functions which compose the NSI support fast failure > recovery and healing mechanisms, thus enabling automatic > convergence of the affected network functions to a stable desired > state. The results of the Self-Healing needs to be notified to the > operator.
> _Editor's note: other major aspects of SON, in addition to NSI Self-
> Optimization and Self-Healing, are FFS._
## 4.5 Key issues for network slicing management
The potential key issues for network slicing management to be addressed in the
TR are as following:
**Issue 1. Align slice instance related terms**
Define the network slice related terms.
**Issue 2. Design of the network slice to support services provided by the
operator**
How the services are requested from the 3GPP management system and how they
are facilitated using a NSI.
**Issue 3. NSI FCAPS management**
How to use FCAPS management for network slicing management.
**Issue 4. SON evolution for network slice management**
How to apply SON concept for network slicing management.
**Issue 5. Orchestration of network slice**
What the different compositions of a network slice and how it is orchestrated.
**Issue 6. Shared slice instance management**
How a network slice is shared across multiple services.
**Issue 7. Multi-domain Slice orchestration**
Different ways of creating a slice across multiple administrative domains.
## 4.6 High-level functional model of business roles
In the context of next generation networks, responsibilities with regard to
operations have to be clearly defined and assigned to roles. High-level
business roles include:
  * Communication Service Customer (CSC): Uses communication services.
  * Communication Service Provider (CSP): Provides communication > services (see 4.7). Designs, builds and operates its communication > services.
  * Network Operator (NOP): Provides network services. Designs, builds > and operates its networks to offer such services.
  * Virtualization Infrastructure Service Provider (VISP): Provides > virtualized infrastructure services. Designs, builds and operates > its virtualization infrastructure(s). Virtualization > Infrastructure Service Providers may also offer their virtualized > infrastructure services to other types of customers including to > Communication Service Providers directly, i.e. without going > through the Network Operator.
  * Data Centre Service Provider (DCSP): Provides data centre services. > Designs, builds and operates its data centres.
  * Network Equipment Provider (NEP): Supplies network equipment. For > sake of simplicity, VNF Supplier is considered here as a type of > Network Equipment Provider.
  * NFVI Supplier: Supplies network function virtualization > infrastructure to its customers.
  * Hardware Supplier: Supplies hardware.
Depending on actual deployments, the roles defined here above can be played by
one single organization or by several ones. Hence, an organization can play
one or several roles defined above.
NOTE 1: the list of roles above is not exhaustive, for sake of simplicity.
{width="6.531944444444444in" height="3.8229166666666665in"}
**Figure 4.6-1. High-level model of roles**
NOTE 1: the above diagram does not carry notion of hierarchy or layering, in
particular it does not preclude from relations between non-neighbouring role
nodes.
NOTE 2: in case the Network Operator offers network services partly or wholly
based on Physical Network Functions, the responsibility for designing,
building and operating such parts of the network services is under the
responsibility of the Network Operator. It does not involve the Virtualization
Infrastructure Service Provider.
## 4.7 Types of communication services
Communication services offered by Communication Service Providers are of
various categories, among which:
\- B2C services, e.g. mobile web browsing, VoLTE, Rich Communication Services,
etc.
\- B2B services, e.g. Internet access, LAN interconnexion, etc.
\- B2B2X services: e.g. services offered to other Communication Service
Providers (e.g. international roaming, RAN sharing, etc.) or to Verticals
(e.g. eMBB, etc.) offering themselves communication services to their own
customers. B2B2X service type includes B2B2 applied recursively, i.e. B2B2B,
B2B2B2B, etc.
## 4.8 Services using the Network Slice concept
### 4.8.1 Network Slices as NOP internals
Types of services listed in 4.7 are offered by CSPs to their customers,
relying on Network Operator(s) network services. Depending on CSP requirements
and/or Network Operator own policies, the Network Operator can decide to
provide required network services using network slices. In such a case, only
the Network Operator has knowledge of the existence of network slices; the CSP
and its customers haven't.
### 4.8.2 Network Slice as a Service
Network slice as a Service can be offered by CSPs to their customers, leaving
the latter ones the possibility to offer their own services on top on network
slice services (B2B2X). Such network slice services could be characterized by
e.g.
  * radio access technology,
  * bandwidth,
  * end-to-end latency,
  * guaranteed / non-guaranteed QoS,
  * security level, etc.
Depending on service offering, CSP imposes limits on the network slice
characteristics that will be exposed to the CSC, and CSP imposes limits on the
network slice management capabilities that will be exposed to the CSC.
A CSP offering Network Slices as a Service relies on network services offered
by one or more network Operators.
## 4.9 Network slice related management functions
The following management functions are needed to manage the NSIs to support
communication services:
> \- Service Management Function (SMF)
>
> \- Responsible for translating the service related requirement to network
> slice related requirements.
>
> \- Communicate with Network Slice Management Function (NSMF).
>
> \- Network Slice Management Function (NSMF)
>
> \- Responsible for management and orchestration of NSI.
>
> \- Derive network slice subnet related requirements from network slice
> related requirements.
>
> \- Communicate with the Network Slice Subnet Management Function (NSSMF) and
> service management function.
>
> \- Network Slice Subnet Management Function (NSSMF)
>
> \- Responsible for management and orchestration of NSSI.
>
> \- Communicate with the NSMF.

# 5 Use Cases
## 5.1 Use case for creating two new NSIs for different end user services with
shared AN and no common CN NFs
### 5.1.1 Pre-conditions
Operator wants to deploy MBB and mIoT services in the network.
The shared AN of multiple slices is available.
### 5.1.2 Description
Several inputs are relevant for differentiating among services.
In this use case, the operator decides to create two NSIs without using common
CN NFs: one for MBB services and another for mIoT services.
The operator configures the NSIs. Both the NSI for MBB and the NSI for mIoT
contain dedicated CN NF respectively.
The operator then activates the two NSIs A and B.
### 5.1.3 Post-conditions
Two NSIs with different characteristics have been created and are operational
to carry the MBB services and mIoT services.
## 5.2 Management support to the network slicing
### 5.2.1 Pre-conditions
**Operator wants to create and manage NSIs based on customers\' needs.**
### 5.2.2 Description
Network slicing is a key enabler for new business models. By exploiting the
network slice specific customization, the mobile network customers and
industry customers could share the same network infrastructure, where each
customer could have the corresponding NSI to fulfill each own different
requirements, such as policy control, security, mobility, charging, latency,
reliability, etc.
The main aspects of management support to the network slicing include:
  * The operator creates NSIs based on different service requirements. > For example, the operator may create two NSIs for two different > requirements: one NSI with medium throughput and low latency for > V2X communication and the other NSI with high throughput and high > latency toleration for HD video streaming.
  * The operator monitors the status of the target NSIs, such as network > functions, services, throughput, latency, the number of > connections, etc., and may configure some slice-specific > parameters.
  * When the service is no longer needed, the operator may delete the > corresponding NSI if that NSI does not support any services.
### 5.2.3 Post-conditions
**Different NSIs fulfil different requirements of customers using the same
network infrastructure**.
## 5.3 Creating a NSI with common and slice specific CN network functions and
shared AN
### 5.3.1 Pre-conditions
The operator wants to create multiple NSIs. The NSIs may contain some
functions that are common to multiple NSIs and some that are specific to a
NSI.
The shared AN supporting multiple slices is available.
### 5.3.2 Description
In some cases, common CN network functions can be shared among multiple NSIs.
The common CN network functions can be virtualized network functions or non-
virtualized network functions.
The operator selects some common CN network functions and slice specific
network functions to compose a NSI. The operator specifies the associated
parameters to create a NSI (e.g. loading and geographic constraints).
When creating a new NSI, the operator determines if existing common CN network
functions are available.
  * In the case that common CN network functions are available, only the > slice specific CN network functions may need to be created. The > existing common CN network functions may need to be reconfigured, > and the resources supporting the common CN network functions may > need to be added in order to ensure that the common CN network > functions can serve the NSI being created.
  * In the case that no common CN network functions are available, the > common CN network functions need to be created and the specific CN > network functions may need to be created respectively. The new > common CN network functions that are created only belong to the > new single NSI at this point until being shared by other NSIs.
### 5.3.3 Post-conditions
A NSI is created where some of the CN network functions are common to multiple
NSIs and some are specific to the NSI.
## 5.4 Modifying a NSI with common and slice specific CN network functions and
shared AN
### 5.4.1 Pre-conditions
The operator wants to modify an existing NSI that is composed of network
functions that are common to multiple NSIs and specific to the NSI.
The shared AN supporting multiple slices is available.
### 5.4.2 Description
Operator determines whether the common CN network functions or specific CN
network functions of the NSI need to be modified.
  * The operator may decide that for modification of the NSI it is > enough to modify the identified slice specific CN network > functions. Otherwise the operator may decide to create new slice > specific CN network functions in order to satisfy the network > slice modification needs and then delete the obsolete slice > specific CN network functions which are replaced by the newly > created slice specific CN network functions.
  * If the operator wants to modify the common CN network functions, the > operator checks whether the modification of common CN network > functions may impact other NSIs and takes appropriate actions as > below,
    * If there is no impact then the operator updates the common CN > network function where needed. If the modification of the > common CN network functions is not applicable then the > operator may decide to create new common CN network functions > in order to satisfy the modification needs.
    * If there is impact, the operator may not perform the > modification of common CN network functions or may decide to > create new CN network functions only for the NSI being > modified in order to satisfy the modification needs and avoid > the impact on other NSIs. The newly created CN network > functions only belong to the NSI being modified until being > shared with other NSIs by configuration.
### 5.4.3 Post-conditions
A NSI that is composed of common CN network functions and slice specific CN
network functions are modified by the operator without negatively impacting
the other NSIs.
## 5.5 Terminating a NSI with common and slice specific CN network functions
and shared AN
### 5.5.1 Pre-conditions
No service is provided any more by the NSI to be terminated.
The shared AN supporting multiple slices is available.
### 5.5.2 Description
Operator terminates an existing NSI. If the NSI to be terminated depends on
common CN network functions which are used by multiple NSIs, the common CN
network functions may need to be configured, the network slice specific
network functions may be terminated. The relation between the common CN
network functions and the NSI needs to be released. The shared AN of the NSI
needs to be re-configured.
### 5.5.3 Post-conditions
A NSI is terminated by the operator.
## 5.6 Use case for Management support to provide a customer's service request
using a NSI
### 5.6.1 Pre-conditions
The network operator has a catalogue of the types of business services it can
offer to the customers with their own end user/device population distributed
in a geographical area.
Editor's note: Customer can be a 3^rd^ party service provider or network
operator's own service department.
The customer has obtained the type of business services that can be provided
by the network operator.
### 5.6.2 Description
> The customer requests the network operator to support a specific business
> service. This request includes the service requirements such as isolation,
> security and performance requirements (e.g. traffic demand requirements for
> the coverage areas, QoS for services, etc.).
>
> The management system determines whether the service can be provided
> checking the available network resources and remaining network capacity in
> the specified geographical areas for the specified durations.
>
> If service can be provided, the management system will negotiate for an
> appropriate agreement with the customer.
>
> The NSMF creates a NSI to provide the agreed service requirements including
> the required isolation and security.
>
> The NSMF monitors the fault and performance of the NSI and ensure meeting
> the agreed service requirements including providing necessary monitoring
> information to the customer.
### 5.6.3 Post-conditions
A NSI is created to provide the service to the satisfaction of the SLA and
network KPIs required by the customer.
## 5.7 Network slice creation
### 5.7.1 Pre-conditions
The operator wants a NSI which includes CN (Core Network) part and RAN part.
> NOTE: The use case do not make any assumption on any potential RAN internal
> slicing.
### 5.7.2 Description
In some case, a network slice which includes CN part and RAN part is needed.
Both CN part and RAN part of network slice can be shared by different NSIs.
Operator wants a NSI to support customer service.
The main aspects of management to support network slice creation includes:
  * The NSMF determines to reuse an existing NSI or create a new NSI. If > an existing NSI can be reused, the operator may reconfigure the > existing NSI. If no existing NSI is available, the NSMF will > determine to create a new NSI and the following steps is included.
> NOTE: two scenarios for reusing an existing NSI:
  * An existing NSI which is used to support other customer services > currently may be shared for the requested customer service.
  * An existing NSI which is not used to support any customer service > currently (e.g. retained previously) may be used for the requested > customer service.
```{=html}
``` \- The NSMF determines the CN part-related requirements and RAN > part-
related requirements based on customer requirements.
  * For the CN part-related requirements, the NSMF determines the NSI > without common CN NF as described in Section 5.1 or the NSI with > common and slice specific CN NF as described in Section 5.3.
```{=html}
``` \- For the RAN part-related requirements, the NSMF determines to > utilize
existing RAN NEs or new RAN NEs.
### 5.7.3 Post-conditions
A NSI which includes CN part and RAN part is created.
## 5.8 Use cases for management data isolation when NSI is shared by multiple
customers
### 5.8.1 Pre-conditions
The operator wants to use one slice instance to serve multiple customers (i.e.
other network operator or enterprises etc.) simultaneously and customers want
to get the management data of the slice instance, such as performance
measurements. It's assumed the NSMF has the ability to generate the management
data separately for different customers.
Editor's note: having access to management data by customers, and the level of
visibility of a network slice by a customer is FFS.
### 5.8.2 Description
When the service requirements of multiple customers can be fulfilled by the
same NSI, the operator may decide to create a single NSI. The created NSI is
shared to serve multiple customers.
In the case of there is fault or the performance degradation in the slice
instance, the customer service may be influenced. The customer may want to
know the fault information or the performance information of the slice
instance which cause the service problem.
The management data (e.g. fault management data, performance data etc.) for
different customers may be separated.
It's up to the operator to decide whether a customer service is to be served
by the same NSI or by different NSIs.
If the service requirements of one of the customers sharing the slice instance
changes, the operator may decide to modify the slice instance without
negatively impacting the service to other parties, if possible. For example,
the operator may check if the modification or reconfiguration is against the
resource usage policies of other services provided by the same NSI. If there
is no conflict, the operator then modifies or reconfigures the NSI.
### 5.8.3 Post-conditions
Multiple customers are served by the same NSI with access to their network
management data.
## 5.9 Supervise a NSI
### 5.9.1 Pre-conditions
The operator wants to supervise an instantiated network slice to be aware of
and resolve problems or potential problems with a NSI based on the received
alarm notifications.
The NSI is composed of NSSIs consisting of network functions and resources. A
NSSI can be associated with only one NSI or with multiple NSIs.
The NSMF knows which NSSIs are associated with each NSI.
### 5.9.2 Description
The NSI is configured so that appropriate alarm notifications are generated

### 5.9.3 Post-conditions
The NSMF provides alarm supervision of a NSI to the operator.
Editor's note: Which function block the NSMF belongs to is FFS.
## 5.10 Monitor the performance of a NSI
### 5.10.1 Pre-conditions
The operator wants to understand the performance of the network slice to
ensure SLA compliance. The network slice is instantiated and configured by the
NSMF so that the appropriate performance data is generated.
The NSMF knows which NSSIs are associated with each NSI A NSSI can be
associated with multiple NSIs.
### 5.10.2 Description
Network slice performance management is carried out at both NSI level and NSSI
level. An example is shown in the following figure 5.10.2-1. NSI 1 is composed
by network slice subnet instance 1 and network slice subnet instance 2.
Firstly, performance data of network slice subnet instances is collected. Then
performance data of a NSI can be generated based on all the performance data
related to network slice subnet instances.
Figure 5.10.2-1 Example of network slice performance management
  * Performance data generation at NSI level
> In order to understand the performance of a NSI, some performance data at
> NSI level need to be obtained. For example, performance data at the NSI
> level may include traffic load data of the whole NSI, service performance
> data provided by the NSI. Traffic load data of a NSI indicates the level of
> both the total user traffic and the signalling traffic within a NSI. The
> service performance data includes the total user traffic, the signalling
> traffic and QoS data corresponding to a particular service instance. QoS
> data of services can indicate whether the NSI delivers services at expected
> QoS level.
>
> In order to obtain NSI level performance data, the NSMF firstly collects
> performance data related to NSSIs associated with the NSI. The NSMF then
> generates NSI level performance data based on performance data related to
> NSSIs.
  * Performance data collection at NSSI level
> The NSMF decides to create measurement jobs on network functions in NSSIs.
> Measurement jobs includes measurement parameters, scheduling information and
> an indication for pointing out the NSI for which performance data needs to
> be collected. The data is collected and provided to the NSMF by the NSSIs.
A NSSI can be dedicated to a NSI or can be shared by multiple NSIs.
a) In case of a dedicated NSSI all performance data from the network > slice
subnet is identified per NSI that is using that NSSI. The > data may be
collected for different QoS levels or for different > service instances
included in the NSI as per the request from the > network management function.
b) In case of a shared NSSI the performance data is segregated per NSI > that
is using that shared NSSI. The data may be collected for > different QoS
levels, for different service instances or for > different slice instance
level as per the request from the network > management function.
### 5.10.3 Post-conditions
The NSMF has the performance data of all NSSIs that are associated with the

### 5.11.1 Pre-conditions
A NSI is in service.
Operator wants to monitor performance parameters in a NSI by setting
thresholds and receiving alarms notifications.
### 5.11.2 Description
In order to monitor performance of a NSI, the NSMF determines thresholds for
performance parameters that need to be monitored by several NFs of the NSI.
The NSMF can set thresholds on both common and specific NFs for monitoring
performance parameters of the NSI. The performance parameters of the NSI are
monitored by NFs. Once the thresholds are met, NFs will generate threshold

### 5.12.2 Description
The NSMF activates the NSI for providing the intended telecommunication
service through activating all necessary CN network functions of the NSI, RAN
NEs of the NSI, and possibly other part of the NSI. Activation is performed by
using management interfaces to request managed entities to move to a state
which relates to activation of the telecommunication service supported by the
NSI. The activation of the CN network functions, RAN NEs and other parts of a
NSI may follow a sequential order.
The NSMF changes the NSI status to activated.
### 5.12.3 Post-conditions
The NSI is providing telecommunication service.
## 5.13 Use case for deactivation of a NSI
### 5.13.1 Pre-conditions

current NSI through deactivating all CN network functions of the NSI, RAN NEs
of the NSI, and possibly other part of the NSI. The ongoing telecommunication
service supported by the NSI is terminated if it is not supported by any other
NSI. Deactivation is performed by using management interfaces to request
managed entities to move to a state which relates to deactivation of the
telecommunication service supported by the NSI. The deactivation of the CN
network functions, RAN NEs and other parts of a NSI may follow a sequential
order.
The NSMF changes the NSI status to deactivated.
### 5.13.3 Post-conditions
The NSI is not providing telecommunication service.
## 5.14 Management support for policy configuration

### 5.16.1 Pre-conditions
The operator wants to change the capacity of a NSI by enlarging the NSI or
shrinking the existing NSI with specified CN network function. The specified
CN network function can be common to multiple NSIs or specific to the NSI.
The shared AN supporting multiple slices is available.
### 5.16.2 Description
The operator determines whether the NSI needs to be enlarged or shrunk.
  * If the operator wants to enlarge the NSI, the operator may decide > that for enlarging the NSI, it is enough to change the capacity of > identified specified CN network functions. If it is not > applicable, then the operator may decide to create new specified > CN network functions for the NSI.
  * If the operator wants to shrink the NSI, the operator determines > whether the capacity of common CN network functions or specific CN > network functions of the NSI need to be changed.
a. The operator may decide that for shrinking the NSI, it is enough > to
change the capacity of identified slice specific CN network > functions. If it
is not applicable, then the operator may > decide to take out one or some of
the identical slice specific > CN network functions.
b. If the operator wants to change the capacity of the common CN > network
functions, the operator checks if the capacity > changing may negatively
impact other NSIs and takes > appropriate actions as below.
        -   If there is no negative impact, then the operator changes
        > the capacity of identified common CN network functions. If
        > the changing capacity of the common CN network function is
        > not applicable, then the operator may decide to take out
        > one or some of the common CN network functions.
    -   If there is negative impact on other NSI, the operator may
        > not perform changing capacity of the common CN network
        > functions.
```{=html}
``` \- In both cases as a part of the modification the operator may need to >
perform appropriate reconfiguration of the existing CN network > functions to
reflect these modifications.
### 5.16.3 Post-conditions
The capacity of NSI that is composed of common CN network functions and slice
specific CN network functions is changed by the operator.
Editor's note: the relation of this use case and the use case of modifying a
NSI with common and slice specific CN network functions and shared AN is FFS.
## 5.17 Use case for management support to facilitate UE roaming between NSIs
in different administrative domains
### 5.17.1 Pre-conditions
The UE may move across multiple administrative domains.
Multiple operators have roaming agreements.
### 5.17.2 Description
The operator knows the information of other NSIs which belongs to other
operators. An example of the information is the network slice selection
assistant information (NSSAI).
The operators configure the network to support the UEs roaming from the
coverage area of one NSI to the coverage area of another NSI. For example,
when NSSAI is not standardized, operator A may configure some network
functions (e.g., network slice selection function) of the NSI to be aware of
the NSSAI of NSIs from operator B to facilitate the mapping between NSSAIs
since the UE may provide the NSSAI of the NSI from operator B when it moves
from the administrative domain of operator B to the administrative domain of
operator A.
### 5.17.3 Post-conditions
NSIs from different administrative domains can provide desired service to the
customer.
## 5.18 Limited level of management exposure for multiple NSIs
### 5.18.1 Pre-conditions
Customers want specific NSIs created by the operator.
### 5.18.2 Description
Multiple network slices required by different customers may have the same type
of service but with different KPI and/or QoS/QoE.
According to NSI creation described in Section 5.3, the operator may create
multiple network slice served by the same NFs and management system to provide
the agreed service requirements including the required management exposure.
Currently, operators provide service management exposures to the customers,
that the network management (i.e. NMs and EMs) and the infrastructure
management are not typically exposed to customers. Operators will need to
extend the current service management offers into limited level of management
exposures in network and infrastructure, which the management exposure is
agreed by both operator and the customer. These limited level of exposure
should be part of the operator extended offer to NSI customer. Typical example
for this use case is from the Enterprise communication market where each
company is represented as a tenant.
### 5.18.3 Post-conditions
The limited level of management exposure agreed by customer and operator of
the created specific NSIs are provided to the customers.
## 5.19 Creating an end-to-end NSI across multiple operators

management pre-requisites, such as trust relationships between operators,
legal and business related, to create such a slice are assumed to exist. The
operators in this use case have agreed upon to the limits of exposure of the
management interface.
> NOTE: The use case does not make any assumption on any potential operator
> internal slicing.
### 5.19.2 Description
An operator A wants to create an end-to-end NSI to support a telecommunication
service across multiple operators, Operator A and Operator B. The end-to-end
NSMF for this network slice resides with Operator A. This end-to-end NSI
across multiple operators will be composed of NSSIs from operator A and NSSIs
from Operator B.
Operator A performs the following actions for the creation of an end-to-end
NSI across multiple operators:
  * Operator A determines to use its own and Operator B's network to > create the end-to-end NSI, decomposes the service request of the > end-to-end network slice for Operator A's and Operator B's > network, and requests the creation of NSSIs to each operator.
  * Both operators may either create a new NSSIs or use an existing one > as a part of the end-to-end NSI.
  * When requested, Operator B provides management data (e.g., > performance data) to Operator A for the NSSI hosted by operator B > and belonging to operator A's end-to-end NSI
> NOTE: Operator A may determine to use more than two operators to support the
> end-to-end NSI. Operator A remains responsible for the management of the
> end-to-end NSI.

requirements (such as network type, network capacity, QoS requirements, etc.)
and provides them to NSMF
NOTE 5: The NSMF manages the NSIs based on the network slice requirements
received from SMF.
NOTE 6: The NSSMF manages the NSSIs based on the network slice subnet
requirements received from the NSMF.
Editor note: How network slice management functions are mapping to OSS/BSS is
FFS.
## 7.2 Solution options for NSI creation across multiple operators
## 7.2.1 General
The potential options for creating a NSI extending multiple operators are
summarized in the following sub-clauses.
### 7.2.2 Option 1: A customer service across multiple operators' NSI
In this option the customer contacts multiple operators to create NSIs for
supporting a service hosted across multiple operators. Figure shows the
Customer who, in this option, owns the service management functionality which
has an interface to each operator for the life cycle management of NSI.
The customer's service management function (SMF) requests the creation of a
NSI to the multiple operator management systems (OMS). Each OMS internally
requests the creation of the NSI to its NSMF. The NSMF creates the NSI and
returns a success to the OMS which returns the success request to the
customer's SMF together with an agreed upon management exposure to the NSI
provided to the customer's SMF.
This option requires the customer's SMF to manage to multiple instances of NSI
to make them support a single service instance.
> NOTE: This option is actually the combination of multiple NSI or NSSI to
> host a customer service and is not per se an extension of a single NSI to
> multiple operators.
Figure 7.2.2-1 Option 1: Customer to operator interface for hosting a service
over NSIs across multiple operators
### 7.2.3 Option 2: Multi-operator slice creation by operator management
system to management system interfaces
In this option the customer requests the NSI to a single operator's management
system (OMS), operator A in Figure . The operator A's service management
function can decide to request an NSSI to another operator's management
system, operator B.
The steps for creating and requesting an NSI begin with the customer
contacting a single operator's management system and that operator's
management system requests the other operator's management system for the life
cycle management of the NSSI (to be) hosted therein.
In this option the service management functionality is hosted in Operator A
and it exposes an agreed upon management interface to the customer. Operator A
is responsible for the management of the NSI.
Figure 7.2.3-1 Option 2: Operator management system (OMS) to OMS interface for
multi-operator NSI creation
### 7.2.4 Option 3: Multi-operator NSI creation by operator NSMF to NSMF
interface
This option is similar to Option 2 in item 7.2.3. The operator A forwards the
request to its NSMF. The NSMF of operator A then decides to use another
operator NSMF to realize the NSI.
The procedures for creating and requesting a NSI are similar to option 2
except that in this case the interface between the OMS of option 2 is replaced
by the interface between NSMFs for life cycle management of the NSSI hosted in
the other operator domain.
NOTE: This option may require the establishment of mutual trust relationships
between the operator A and B, which is currently considered out of scope of
3GPP SA5.

creation
## 7.3 Making a service request with commonly agreed service types and
attributes for service provision automation
This section addresses the use case, where a mobile network operator provides
the types of services to the customers with their own end user/device
population distributed in a geographical area and how the customer should
specify the services it needs with the related requirements. The operator uses
the service management functionality in the 3GPP management system for this
purpose.
Editor's note: The placement of the functions in the service management
functionality is FFS.
The customer can identify the available types of business services and the
attribute values that need to be specified in order to uniquely identify the
customer service request. The service requirements may be finalized in several
steps of negotiation which may involve iterative changes of these attribute
values.
The network management system should have the capability to assess the types
of services it can offer knowing the network infra-structure capabilities and
made it available to the service management functionality.
An operator may decide to slice the network using different criterion, such as
application types (e.g. MTC, v2V, URLLC), QoS types, mobility, security etc.
An operator may have multiple categorization criterion or have a hybrid
categorization. The global customer service categorization should allow for
any such categorization and a standard service request format may be designed
so that there is a mutual understanding for customer-operator negotiation or
for the negotiations between different administrative domains.
The network management system also needs to see the feasibility of
facilitating those service types considering the issues such as resource
availability and capacity limits, and identify all the attributes related to
each service classification and prepare the attributes according to the global
categorization format.
There can be several levels of service type categorizations each higher level
service category having multiple sub-categories in order to cover numerous
possible customer service types that can be provided by a network operator.
The main classifications may be based on the following two aspects (1) Based
on the business service type; (2) based on high level service characteristics.
These are further described below.
1) **First level of categorization based on type of business service:**
There can be 3 types of telecommunication services that may be offered by an
MNO.
> **a) End to end (E2E) connectivity as a service:** providing E2E
> telecommunication service (e.g. user to a server) with multiple end
> users/devices (single user is a subset of this case).
>
> **b) Network as a service (NaaS):** providing a 'connected' network that can
> be used by another MNO or service provider.
>
> **c) Asset as a service - also termed infra-structure as a service (IaaS):**
> providing resources that can be used for connectivity.
Editor's note**:** This is not an exhaustive list and further additions such
as the data analytics and location information services and platform as a
service, are FFS.
This first level service category may need to be identified in any type of
negotiation, i.e. customer to operator or negotiation between different
administrative domains.
2) **Second level of categorization based on high level service
characteristics facilitated by the slices:**
In this level the key service characteristics that impacts the composition of
the network slice are used for categorization. Several examples of such key
characteristics are service function chain, security, mobility, QoS, traffic
types, and geographical locations. Different operators may choose different
chracteristics when forming different slice or service types to offer to the
customers.
An operator, for example, may map all its services into one of the three
network slice types such as eMBB, URLLC, mMTC, when serving a customer.
On the other hand, another operator may categorize the services according to
the QoS ranges and prepare slices to map a combination of different ranges of
QoS and different service function chains. For example, the MEC (mobile edge
computing) applications requiring low delay may be classified as a one service
category and best effort traffic may be categorized as another.
**Further classification and specific attributes corresponding to each
classification**
Certain service types with much more variation in service requirements may be
further classified into sub-categories to allow for an operator to offer more
granularity to its customers. For example, eMBB type may be further classified
into QoS ranges or QoS based categorization may be further classified into
user to server and user to user service (service function chain based).
Finally, there needs to have a set of attributes to specify different options
and other service requirements, which can be different for different service
types discussed above. Some of these options include:
  * end user authentication method,
  * physical or logical isolation requirements,
  * congestion control mechanisms,
  * resource specification,
  * charging method
  * dynamic policy change possibilities
  * network exposure possibilities,
  * traffic monitoring and controlling possibilities for customer,
  * Penalising methods for not meeting the SLA, etc.
Other service requirements may include performance requirements such as
capacity, delay, number of users, geographical coverage, traffic profiles etc.
The Table 7.3-1 illustrates the multiple levels of service categorization
described above.
**Table 7.3-** 1
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Level 1 | Level 2 | Optional | Attributes, | | | categorization | additional | and their | | Categorization | based on | levels (3, 4, | ranges | | based on | service | 5), e.g. | | | Business | ch | exposure | e.g.: | | Service Type | aracterization | levels | Capacity, | | | | | throughput, | | (A, B, C) | (A: A1, A2, | (TBD) | delay, number | | | A3) | | of users, | | | | | geographical | | | (B: B1, B2) | | id | | | | | entifications, | | | (C1, C2, C3, | | authentication | | | C4) | | level etc. | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
## 7.4 NSI performance alarms monitoring
**Figure 7.4-1 NSI performance alarms monitoring**
Figure 7.4-1 shows a high-level solution of NSI performance alarms monitoring.
More details are depicted as follows:
  1. The NSMF determines to monitor the performance alarms for PM > parameters of a NSI.
  2. The NSMF determines to create threshold monitoring jobs for > monitoring PM parameters on slice specific NFs, common NFs of the > NSI.
  3. In case of slice specific NFs, threshold monitoring job information > contains PM parameters and threshold values.
> Editor\'s note: In case of common NFs shared by multiple NSIs, it is FFS.
  1. The NSMF receives performance alarm notifications specific to a NSI.
## 7.5 Creating a NSI to support communication service
The potential solution for creating a NSI to support a communication service
is described below:
> 1\. The CSP sends service request to the Service Management Function with
> overall service related requirements.
>
> 2\. The Service Management Function translates the service related
> requirements into network slice related requirements, the information
> indicating whether the requested NSI can be shared with other communication
> service may be included in the network slice related requirements.
>
> NOTE: the information indicating whether the requested NSI can be shared
> with other communication services may be determined by Service Management
> Function or CSP.
>
> 3\. The Service Management Function sends a request to the NSMF to allocate
> a NSI with network slice related requirements.
>
> 4\. If there is information indicating the requested NSI can be shared with
> other communication services and if an existing available NSI can be used,
> the NSMF may use the existing NSI. Otherwise, the NSMF may create a new NSI
> to satisfy the network slice related requirements.
>
> 5\. The NSMF derives the network slice subnet related requirements from the
> network slice related requirements.
>
> 6a. If a new NSI needs to be created, the NSMF identifies the NSSIs to be
> reused and the NSSIs to be created.
>
> 6b. If an existing NSI needs to be reused, the NSMF identifies the NSSIs to
> be reused.
>
> 7a. For the NSSI to be created, the NSMF request corresponding NSSMF to
> create a new NSSI with the network slice subnet requirements.
>
> 7b. For the NSSI to be reused, the NSMF request corresponding NSSMF to
> reconfigure or modify it with the network slice subnet requirements if
> needed.
>
> 8\. The NSMF associates NSSIs with the corresponding NSI.
## 7.6 Modifying a NSI
The potential solution for modifying a NSI is described as follows.
> 1\. The NSMF receives a NSI modification request or the NSMF decides to
> modify a NSI based on a pre-defined policy. For example, the modification of
> NSI may include changing the capacity of the NSI.
>
> 2\. If the NSMF determines to modify the NSI through modifying NSSI, it
> sends request to the NSSMF with related requirements. The NSSMF modifies the
> NSSI according to the requirements from the NSMF.
Editor's note: How to protect other existing services from undesirable impacts
is FFS.
## 7.7 Terminating a NSI
The following is a high-level solution for terminating a NSI.
> 1\. The NSMF determines to terminate the NSI which is not necessary any
> longer.
>
> 2\. The NSMF de-activates the NSI. Then the NSI to be terminated is in de-
> activated state.
>
> NOTE: The solution for NSI de-activation is studied in other clauses.
>
> 3\. The NSMF identifies corresponding NSSIs to be terminated and NSSIs to be
> retained.
>
> 4\. If the NSSI needs to be terminated, the NSMF sends NSSI termination
> request to corresponding NSSMF. Then the NSSMF terminates the NSSI.
>
> 5\. The NSMF deletes the NSI information.
## 7.8 Management support to facilitate UE roaming between NSIs in different
administrative domains
The solution assumes the Operators have roaming agreement, and roaming is
supported through network slicing.
> 1\. The Operator B notifies the Operator A about the slice selection related
> information for the NSI.
>
> Editor's note 1: The detailed slice selection related information may depend
> on SA2 discussion.
>
> 2\. The NSMF of Operator A provides the slice selection related information
> to the related network functions of NSI to support the roaming users from
> the NSI of Operator B.
>
> Editor's note 2: Which network functions need to be configured may depend on
> SA2 discussion.

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | **Related content in NGMN |** Potential management related | | \"Description of Network Slicing | aspect**| | Concept\"** | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | As depicted in Figure B.1-1, the | **SA5 management related** | | network slicing concept consists | | | of 3 layers: 1) Service Instance | | | Layer, 2) Network Slice Instance | | | Layer, and 3) Resource layer. | | | | | | The Service Instance Layer | | | represents the services | | | (end-user service or business | | | services) which are to be | | | supported. Each service is | | | represented by a Service | | | Instance. Typically services can | | | be provided by the network | | | operator or by 3rd parties. In | | | line with this, a Service | | | Instance can either represent an | | | operator service or a 3rd party | | | provided service. | | | | | | A network operator uses a | | | Network Slice Blueprint to | | | create a Network Slice Instance. | | | A Network Slice Instance | | | provides the network | | | characteristics which are | | | required by a Service Instance. | | | A Network Slice Instance may | | | also be shared across multiple | | | Service Instances provided by | | | the network operator. | | | | | | NOTE: Whether there is a need to | | | support sharing of Network Slice | | | Instances across Service | | | Instances provided by different | | | 3rd parties is up for discussion | | | in SDOs. | | | | | | The Network Slice Instance may | | | be composed by none, one or more | | | Sub-network Instances, which may | | | be shared by another Network | | | Slice Instance. Similarly, the | | | Sub-network Blueprint is used to | | | create a Sub-network Instance to | | | form a set of Network Functions, | | | which run on the | | | physical/logical resources. | | | | | | Figure B.1-1: Network slicing | | | conceptual outline | | | | | | **Service Instance:** An | | | instance of an end-user service | | | or a business service that is | | | realized within or by a Network | | | Slice. | | | | | | **Network Slice Instance:** a | | | set of network functions, and | | | resources to run these network | | | functions, forming a complete | | | instantiated logical network to | | | meet certain network | | | characteristics required by the | | | Service Instance(s): | | | | | | - A network slice instance may | | | be fully or partly, logically | | | and/or physically, isolated from | | | another network slice instance. | | | | | | - The resources comprises of | | | physical and logical resources. | | | | | | - A Network Slice Instance may | | | be composed of Sub-network | | | Instances, which as a special | | | case may be shared by multiple | | | network slice instances. The | | | Network Slice Instance is | | | defined by a Network Slice | | | Blueprint. | | | | | | - Instance-specific policies | | | and configurations are required | | | when creating a Network Slice | | | Instance. | | | | | | - Network characteristics | | | examples are ultra-low-latency, | | | ultra-reliability etc. | | | | | | **Network Slice Blueprint:** A | | | complete description of the | | | structure, configuration and the | | | plans/work flows for how to | | | instantiate and control the | | | Network Slice Instance during | | | its life cycle. A Network Slice | | | Blueprint enables the | | | instantiation of a Network | | | Slice, which provides certain | | | network characteristics (e.g. | | | ultra-low latency, | | | ultra-reliability, value-added | | | services for enterprises, etc.). | | | A Network Slice Blueprint refers | | | to required physical and logical | | | resources and/or to Sub-network | | | Blueprint(s). | | | | | | **Sub-network Instance:** A | | | Sub-network Instance comprises | | | of a set of Network Functions | | | and the resources for these | | | Network Functions: | | | | | | - The Sub-network Instance is | | | defined by a Sub-network | | | Blueprint. | | | | | | - A Sub-network Instance is not | | | required to form a complete | | | logical network. | | | | | | - A Sub-network Instance may be | | | shared by two or more Network | | | Slices. | | | | | | - The resources comprises of | | | physical and logical resources. | | | | | | **Sub-network Blueprint:** A | | | description of the structure | | | (and contained components) and | | | configuration of the Sub-network | | | Instances and the plans/work | | | flows for how to instantiate it. | | | A Sub-network Blueprint refers | | | to Physical and logical | | | resources and may refer to other | | | Sub-network Blueprints. | | | | | | **Physical resource:** A | | | physical asset for computation, | | | storage or transport including | | | radio access: | | | | | | - Network Functions are not | | | regarded as Resources. | | | | | | **Logical Resource:** Partition | | | of a physical resource, or | | | grouping of multiple physical | | | resources dedicated to a Network | | | Function or shared between a set | | | of Network Functions. | | | | | | **Network Function (NF):** | | | Network Function refers to | | | processing functions in a | | | network: | | | | | | - This includes but is not | | | limited to telecom nodes | | | functionality, as well as | | | switching functions e.g. | | | Ethernet switching function, IP | | | routing functions. | | | | | | - VNF is a virtualized version | | | of a NF (refer to ETSI NFV for | | | further details on VNF). | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
