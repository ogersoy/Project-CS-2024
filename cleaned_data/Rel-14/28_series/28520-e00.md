# 4 Concepts and background
## 4.1 Overview
The evaluation of PLMN-system behaviour will require performance data
collected and recorded by VNF(s) according to a schedule established by the EM
[2]. However, not all of these measurements will be required all the time, or
from every VNF. Therefore, it is necessary to administer the measurements so
as to determine which measurement types, on which measured resources, at which
times, are to be executed (see TS 32.401 [2]).
The essence of NFV is to migrate the execution of network functions from
vertically integrated hardware to the industry standard COTS (commercial of-
the-shelf) servers in the data centre. Performance measurements that are
independent of the migration (e.g. handover, tracking area update ... related
measurements [7]) are not impacted. Therefore, these performance measurements
can be reused.
Other performance measurement that are to measure the hardware usages (e.g.
MME Processor usage [7]) are impacted by the Virtualized Resource (VR)
performance measurements.
## 4.2 Performance measurement data collection methods
Figure 4.2-1 shows the PM data collection methods for virtualized networks.
When it is necessary to collect the PM data (i.e. PM data related to 3GPP
Network Function and 3GPP NF PM data related to VR), NM needs to create a PM
collection task at EM. So EM knows the measurement types, the measured
resources, the recording periods and collection times wanted (see TS 32.401
[2]).
For PM data related to 3GPP Network Function collection, EM will request
VNF(s) to collect the PM data related to 3GPP Network Function as specified by
NM.
For VNF PM data related to VR collection, EM will create a PM collection task
at VNFM to collect VNF/VNFC PM data related to VR, based on the information
provided by NM, so VNFM knows the measurement types, the measured resources,
the recording periods, and collection times wanted. Then, VNFM will create a
PM collection task at VIM, based on the information provided by EM (see clause
7.7.2 [8]). VIM will request NFVI to collect the VR PM data as specified by
VNFM.
The various PM data collected are stored in data repositories. Data stored in
data repositories may be fetched by NM (or any authorized user).

method/algorithm for mapping/processing/conversion of the performance metric
types produced by VNFM/VIM to "3GPP NF performance measurements related to
VR".
