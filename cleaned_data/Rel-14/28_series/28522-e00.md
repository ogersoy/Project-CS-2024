# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

# 4 General descriptions
For the stage 2 solution of Performance Management for mobile networks that
include virtualized network functions over Itf-N, the PM IRP IS (TS 32.412
[2]) is applicable. For the purpose of notification, Notification IRP [6] is
needed.
# 5 Information Model Definition
## 5.1 Itf-N
For Performance Management for 3GPP Network Function over Itf-N, the IOCs
defined by PM IRP specified in clause 6 of 3GPP TS 32.412 [2] are reused.
## 5.2 Os-Ma-nfvo
None.
## 5.3 Ve-Vnfm-em
For Ve-Vnfm-em Performance Management, the information elements and
notifications which are specified in subclause 9.7 of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 008 [4]
for VNF Performance Management shall be used.
## 5.4 Ve-Vnfm-vnf
None
# 6 Interface Definition
## 6.1 Itf-N
For the stage 2 solution of Performance Management for mobile networks that
include virtualized network functions over Itf-N, the operations and
notifications defined by PM IRP specified in 3GPP TS 32.412 [2] are reused.
## 6.2 Os-Ma-nfvo
None.
## 6.3 Ve-Vnfm-em
