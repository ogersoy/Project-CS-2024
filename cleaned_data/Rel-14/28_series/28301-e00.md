# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
**28.301 LSA Controller (LC) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Requirements**

# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the requirements of the Licensed Shared Access
(LSA) Controller (LC) Integration Reference Point (IRP). This IRP allows the
NM to interact with the LC. This interaction with the LC enables the NM to
configure NEs utilizing LSA spectrum resources.
The following two deployment scenarios are supported:
\- one scenario in which the LC communicates LSA spectrum resource
availability information to the NM, and
\- one scenario in which the LC determines and communicates to the NM
constraints on parameters of cells liable to use LSA spectrum resources.

# 4 Concepts and background
## 4.1 General
ETSI TS 103 235 [3], ETSI TS 103 379 [4], ETSI TS 103 154 [5] and ETSI TR 103
113 [6] describe a system architecture for operation of mobile broadband
services in the 2 300 MHz - 2 400 MHz band under Licensed Shared Access (LSA),
aimed at enabling access for mobile/fixed communication networks (MFCNs) in
those CEPT countries where access to the band is foreseen but cannot be
provided without restrictions due to incumbent usage.
This specification series describes the interface between the NM and LC.
## 4.2 Architecture
The LC is a kind of NMLS (see TS 32.101 [2]). The interface between the NM and
LC is a Type 7 interface.
## 4.3 Functionality
Two deployment scenarios are considered and different functionality is
specified for the interface between the LC and NM.
**Deployment scenario 1:** In this scenario the LC is a relay for the LSRAI
received from the LR. The LC forwards it to the NM.
**Deployment scenario 2:** In this scenario the LSRAI is not forwarded to the
NM. The LC computes radio configuration constraints based on the LSRAI
received from the LR and radio planning parameters received from the NM. These
radio configuration constraints are sent to the NM.
