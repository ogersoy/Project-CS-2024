# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project: Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
**28.734: Signalling Transport Network (STN) interface Network Resource Model
(NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Requirements.**
28.735: Signalling Transport Network (STN) interface Network Resource Model
(NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Information Service (IS).
28.736: Signalling Transport Network (STN) interface Network Resource Model
(NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions.
Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimisation programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines , in addition to the requirements defined in [1],
[2] and [3], the requirements for the Signalling Transport Network (STN)
interface NRM IRP.

# 4 Requirements
The following general and high-level requirements apply for the present IRP:
A. IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.101 [1].
B. IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
C. IRP-related requirements in 3GPP TS 32.600 [3].
The NRM defined by this IRP:
D. Shall support communications for telecommunication network management
purposes, including management of converged networks.
E. Is a member of the Federated Network Information Model (FNIM) [13] and its
information is derived from FNIM Umbrella Information Model (UIM) [9].
In addition to the above, the following more specific requirements apply.
## 4.1 MTP3 Configuration Management
a) It shall be possible for IRPManager to retrieve configuration information
related to MTP3 signalling managed entity.
b) When the configuration information of MTP3 signalling managed entities
changes, corresponding notifications shall be generated to IRPManager.
c) When the status of MTP3 signalling managed entities changes, corresponding
notifications shall be generated to IRPManager.
d) It shall be possible for IRPManager to identify which technology that the
STN is based on (e. g. MTP3, MTP3B [4]);
e) The interface shall allow for the viewing of parameters of the MTP3
signalling point, MTP3 signalling link set termination point, MTP3 signalling
link termination point, MTP3 signalling route and MTP3 signalling route set
[4], [5], [7], [8].
## 4.2 M3UA Configuration Management
a) It shall possible for IRPManager to retrieve configuration information
related to M3UA signalling managed entities.
b) When the configuration information of M3UA signalling managed entities
changes, corresponding notifications shall be generated to IRPManager.
c) When the status of M3UA signalling managed entities changes, corresponding
notifications shall be generated to IRPManager.
d) The interface shall allow for the viewing of parameters of the M3UA
signalling point, M3UA signalling link set termination point, M3UA signalling
link termination point, M3UA signalling route and M3UA signalling route set
([4], [11]).
## 4.3 Fault Management
Any fault detected by the signalling managed entity (including signalling
point, signalling link set termination point, signalling link termination
point, signalling route and signalling route set [4], [5], [7], [8]) shall be
passed up to the IRPManager.
## 4.4 Performance Management
It shall be possible for IRPManager to collect and monitor performance data.
The detailed mesurement data to be defined in 3GPP TS 32.405 [10].
# 5 Issues
The NRM shall allow to be extended to support other technologies based
Signalling Transport Network in the future (e.g. IP-based; see 3GPP TS 29.202
[4]).
