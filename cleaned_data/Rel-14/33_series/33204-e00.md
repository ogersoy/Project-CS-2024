# Introduction
The absence of security in Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) networks is an
identified security weakness in 2G systems. This was formerly perceived not to
be a problem, since the SS7 networks were the provinces of a small number of
large institutions. This is no longer the case, and so there is now a need for
security precautions.
For 3G systems it is a clear goal to be able to protect the core network
signalling protocols, and by implication this means that security solutions
shall be found for both SS7 and IP based protocols.
Various protocols and interfaces are used for control plane signalling within
and between core networks. The security services that have been identified as
necessary are confidentiality, integrity, authentication and anti-replay
protection. These will be ensured by standard procedures, based on
cryptographic techniques.
# 1 Scope
This technical specification covers the security mechanisms and procedures
necessary to protect all TCAP user messages which are sent between different
security domains. The complete set of enhancements and extensions to
facilitate security protection for the TCAP protocol is termed TCAPsec and it
covers transport security in the TCAP protocol itself and the security
management procedures.
This technical specification contains the stage 2 specification for security
protection of the TCAP protocol. The actual implementation (stage 3)
specification can be found in TS 29.204 [9].

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
In addition to the definitions included in TR 21.905 [1], for the purposes of
the present document, the following definitions apply:
**Anti-replay protection:** Anti-replay protection is a special case of
integrity protection. Its main service is to protect against replay of self-
contained packets that already have a cryptographic integrity mechanism in
place.
**Confidentiality:** The property that information is not made available or
disclosed to unauthorised individuals, entities or processes.
**Data integrity:** The property that data has not been altered in an
unauthorised manner.
**Data origin authentication:** The corroboration that the source of data
received is as claimed.
**Entity authentication:** The provision of assurance of the claimed identity
of an entity.
**Key freshness:** A key is fresh if it can be guaranteed to be new, as
opposed to an old key being reused through actions of either an adversary or
authorised party.
**Security Association:** A logical connection created for security purposes.
All traffic traversing a security association is provided the same security
protection. The security association specifies protection levels, algorithms
to be used, lifetimes of the connection etc.
**SS7 Carrier:** An SS7 network that is not a PLMN.
**SS7 Security Gateway:** A Network Node that terminates and initiates
TCAPsec. Similar to a SEG (see TS 33.210 [6]), the SS7 security Gateway is
used for communication between two SS7 security domains.
**TCAPsec:** The complete collection of protocols and procedures needed to
protect TCAP user messages.

significant substring on the left hand side and the least significant
substring on the right hand side. A substring may be a bit, byte or other
arbitrary length bitstring. Where a variable is broken down into a number of
substrings, the leftmost (most significant) substring is numbered 0, the next
most significant is numbered 1, and so on through to the least significant.
# 4 Principles of TCAP user security
## 4.1 Overview
This technical specification defines mechanisms for protecting all TCAP user
messages called TCAPsec. Another approach which could partially achieve the
same goal as TCAPsec is the use of NDS/IP [6] at the network layer when IP is
used as the transport protocol. However, whenever inter-working with networks
using SS7-based transport is necessary, protection with TCAPsec shall be used.
The benefit for an operator applying TCAPsec will gradually increase when more
interconnected operators also apply TCAPsec. TCAPsec can be used together with
TCAP handshake solutions, however when using TCAPsec for MAP SMS transfers
between two PLMNs, running TCAP handshake in addition does not add more
security.
NOTE 1: A limited level of MAP message authenticity can be achieved without
the use of SS7-SEGs by using a TCAP handshake prior to the MAP payload
exchange. Annex D describes the use of the TCAP handshake for MAP SMS
transfers.
NOTE 2: TCAPsec does not validate the TCAP user payload content (e.g. SMS
payload address correlation as described for TCAP handshake in Annex D).
Message screening functions for particular message types may be needed on top
of TCAPsec.
NOTE 3: In order to prevent all active attacks all interconnected operators
shall route all SS7 traffic via SS7-SEGs.
Before protection can be applied, Security Associations (SA) need to be
established between the respective SS7-SEG. Security associations define,
among other things, which keys and algorithms to use at the SS7-SEG. The
necessary SAs between networks are negotiated between the respective network
operators. The negotiated SA will be effective PLMN-wide and distributed to
all SS7-SEGs. Each SS7-SEG contains policy information containing the
protection mode that shall be applied. Protected TCAP user signalling traffic
will, for routing purposes, be indistinguishable from unprotected traffic to
all parties except for the sending and receiving entities.
Annex B includes detailed procedures on how secure TCAP user signalling is
performed between two SS7-SEGs.
## 4.2 Network architecture
### 4.2.1 General
TCAPsec can be applied between different types of SS7 networks:
a) between two PLMN's.
b) between a PLMN and an SS7-carrier.
c) between two SS7-carriers.
The first case is considered in the end-to-end architecture (cf. clause
4.2.2). This architecture is applied in case the communicating PLMNs do not
wish to trust intermediate SS7-networks.
In a hub-and-spoke architecture, a concatenation of multiple second and third
cases may happen (cf. clause 4.2.3). Using this architecture is required if
certain payload related services are performed by an SS7-carrier for whom the
SS7-carrier is trusted by the PLMN.
### 4.2.2 End-to-end architecture
In a PLMN that employs SS7-SEGs all TCAP user signalling messages entering or
leaving the PLMN have to transit an SS7-SEG which belongs to the PLMN and
which performs the protection of outgoing messages and the protection checking
and de-protection or blocking of incoming messages. SS7-SEG shall do Global
Title Translation. For all unprotected messages from network elements inside
one PLMN that are destined for another PLMN, the destination point is a
SS7-SEG of the originating PLMN. After the messages are protected by a SS7-SEG
of the originating PLMN, this SS7-SEG shall direct the message towards the
destination NE (cf. figure 4.2-1).
One or several SS7-SEGs may be employed within a PLMN.
An SS7-SEG may be co-located with any TCAP user NE or it may stand alone.
However, for the purpose of this specification and without imposing any
restrictions, it is assumed that the SS7-SEG is stand alone.
It is further assumed that the SS7-SEGs are located at the border of the PLMN
i.e. incoming messages transit an SS7-SEG before they reach any other node
within the PLMN, and outgoing messages transit an SS7-SEG immediately before
reaching a node outside the PLMN.
Figure 4.2-1: End-to-end SS7-Security Gateway Architecture
### 4.2.3 Hub-and-Spoke architecture
Using a hub-and-spoke architecture for SS7SEGs is required in following cases
a) The intermediate SS7-carrier has to perform TCAP user payload modification
> An example of such a service is steering of roaming. Another example is an
> SMS hubbing architecture where the HUB (i.e. the SS7 carrier) has to insert
> a virtual SMSC-address in the MAP message.
b) The intermediate SS7-carrier needs to perfom protocol interworking.
> Examples are inter-standard SMS for roaming into CDMA, and a CAMEL Gateway.
Using a hub-and-spoke architecture for SS7SEGs may be used for following cases
but can also be performed in the end-to-end architecture.
a) The intermediate SS7-carrier performs message screening (e.g. SPAM control)
and may have to drop messages.
> If the communicating PLMNs have agreed to use protection mode 1 then using
> the end-to-end architecture is preferred from a security point of view.
>
> If the communicating PLMNs have agreed to use protection mode 2 and both
> PLMNs find it acceptable to share the confidentiality key with the SS7
> carrier then the end-to-end architecture can be used and is preferred from a
> security point of view. If confidentiality key sharing is not acceptable
> then the hub-and-spoke architecture is the only possible solution.
b) The intermediate SS7-carrier performs advanced reporting.
> The same considerations as for case c apply.
Figure 4.2-2 is one example of such a hub-and-spoke architecture.
NOTE: From a security point of view the number of intermediate hubs should be
limited.

# 5 TCAP user security (TCAPsec)
## 5.1 Security services provided by TCAPsec
The security services provided by TCAPsec are:
\- data integrity;
\- data origin authentication;
\- anti-replay protection;
\- confidentiality (optional).
## 5.2 Properties and tasks of an SS7-SEG
An SS7-SEG shall maintain the following databases:
\- SPD-SEG: A database containing TCAPsec policy information (see clause 5.3);
\- SAD-SEG: A database containing TCAPsec SA information. SS7-SEG shall
monitor the SA hard expiry time and expired SAs shall be deleted from the
database (see clause 5.4).
SS7-SEG shall be able to perform the following operations:
\- Secure TCAP user signalling (i.e. send/receive protected or unprotected
messages) according to information in SPD-SEG and SAD-SEG. The structure of
protected messages is defined in clause 5.5 and the protection algorithms are
defined in clause 5.6.
## 5.3 Policy requirements for the TCAPsec Security Policy Database (SPD)
The security policies for TCAPsec key management are specified in the
SS7-SEG's SPD. SPD entries define per peer network whether protection shall be
applied, and if protection shall be applied then which protection mode shall
be used. SPD entries of different SS7-SEGs within the same network shall be
consistent.
**Fallback to unprotected mode:**
\- The \"fallback to unprotected mode\" (enabled/disabled) is a parameter for
the receiving direction per network, if enabled it allows the receiving
network to accept unprotected traffic as well as protected traffic. If
disabled, only protected traffic is to be accepted
\- The use of the fallback indicator is specified in Annex B;
\- The security measures specified in this TS are only fully useful for a
particular network if it disallows fallback to unprotected mode for TCAP user
messages received from any other network.
NOTE: The benefit gained for a sending operator A that applies TCAPsec for all
or a subset of messages towards a peer network B is that spoofing of the SCCP
calling party address for all or a subset of messages can be detected. The
receiving network B is now able to reject unprotected messages for all or a
subset of messages that need protection, with SCCP calling party addresses
from network A.
**Explicit policy configuration:**
\- The SPD shall contain an entry for each network the SS7-SEG is allowed to
communicate with.
**Protection granularity:**
\- SPD administration shall be allowed on TCAP user application part level for
each network the SS7-SEG is allowed to communicate with.
**Migration support between protection modes:**
\- An SPD entry may contain two protection modes for the same network. If this
is the case then both protection modes shall be acceptable for incoming
messages, but only one (preferred) protection mode shall be used for outgoing
messages.
## 5.4 TCAPsec security association attribute definition
The TCAPsec security association shall contain the following data elements
which can be classified in two groups
A) SA Identification attributes i.e. Network Ids and SPI:
> In sending direction the SA identification is based on Destination Network
> Id. Per Destination Network Id more than one SA may exist. In the case where
> more than one valid SA is available at the SAD, the sending SS7-SEG shall
> choose the SA with the earliest soft expiry time.
>
> In receiving direction the used SPI from within the TCAPsec security header
> can be used to retrieve the Origin Network Id.
B) Assigned cryptographic parameters per SPI:
Key and algorithm identifiers and SA lifetime.
SA Identification attributes:
**\- [Destination Network Id]{.underline}:**
The Destination Network Id is a concatenation of the Country Code (CC) and
National Destination Code (NDC) of the receiving network. The Destination
Network-Id is used to identify which SAD-entry shall be used when traffic
protection is needed.
**\- [Security Parameters Index (SPI)]{.underline}:**
> SPI is a 32-bit value that is used in combination with Destination Network
> Id to uniquely identify a TCAPsec SA. The SPI is used to identify which SAD
> entry shall be used when de-protecting traffic. Therefore the SPI needs to
> be assigned by the destination network.
**\- [Origin Network Id]{.underline}:**
The Origin Network Id is a concatenation of the Country Code (CC) and National
Destination Code (NDC) of the sending network.
Cryptographic parameters per SPI:
**\- [SS7 Security Gateway Encryption Algorithm identifier
(SEA)]{.underline}:**
Identifies the encryption algorithm. Mode of operation of algorithm is
implicitly defined by the algorithm identifier. Mapping of algorithm
identifiers is defined in clause 5.6.
**\- [SS7 Security Gateway Encryption Key (SEK)]{.underline}:**
Contains the encryption key. The length of SEK is defined according to the
algorithm identifier.
**\- [SS7 Security Gateway Integrity Algorithm identifier
(SIA)]{.underline}:**
Identifies the integrity algorithm. Mode of operation of algorithm is
implicitly defined by the algorithm identifier. Mapping of algorithm
identifiers is defined in clause 5.6.
**\- [SS7 Security Gateway Integrity Key (SIK)]{.underline}:**
Contains the integrity key. The length of SIK is defined according to the
algorithm identifier.
**\- [SA Hard Expiry Time]{.underline}:**
Defines the actual expiry time of the SA. The Hard Expiry Time shall be given
in UTC time with format YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssTZD as described by W3C DTF [7].
**\- [SA Soft Expiry Time]{.underline}:**
Defines Soft Expiry Time of the SA for outbound traffic. The format of the
Soft Expiry Time is the same as the Hard Expiry Time. The SA Soft Expiry Time
is determined by the Originating Network and shall expire before the SA Hard
Expiry Time.
After the Hard Expiry Time has been reached, the SA shall no longer be used
for inbound or outbound traffic. When the Soft Expiry Time is reached, the SA
shall not be used any longer for the outbound traffic unless no other valid SA
exists.
## 5.5 TCAPsec structure of protected messages
TCAPsec provides following protection modes and these are defined as follows:
Protection Mode 1: Integrity, Authenticity
Protection Mode 2: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Authenticity
In case a TCAP message does not require protection (as indicated by the SPD)
then the message shall be routed unchanged by the SS7-SEG.
TCAP messages protected by means of TCAPsec include a Security Header and a
Protected Payload.
Secured TCAP user messages have the following structure:
* * *
Security Header Protected Payload
* * *
For detailed message structure see TS 29.204 [9]In all protection modes, the
security header is transmitted in cleartext.
The intermediate unprotected TCAP message representation is the cleartext
concatenation of DialoguePortion and ComponentPortion of the original TCAP
message (after message reassembly if this applies).
For protection mode 1, the protected payload is the concatenation of the
intermediate unprotected TCAP message representation and the message
authentication code.
For protection mode 2, the protected payload is the concatenation of the
result of applying the encryption function to the intermediate unprotected
TCAP message representation, and the message authentication code.
For integrity and authenticity in protection mode 1, the message
authentication code is calculated on the concatenation of the security header
and the intermediate unprotected TCAP message representation. The message
authentication code in protection mode 2 is calculated on concatenation of the
security header and the result of applying the encryption function to the
intermediate unprotected TCAP message representation.
### 5.5.1 TCAPsec security header
For Protection Mode 1, the security header is a sequence of the following
elements:
_Security header = SPI \|\| TVP_
For Protection Mode 2, the security header is a sequence of the following
elements:
_Security header = SPI \|\| TVP \|\| SS7-SEG Id \|\| Prop_
where
\- **[Security Parameters Index (SPI):]{.underline}**
See Clause 5.4
**\- [TVP:]{.underline}**
The TVP, used for replay protection of secured TCAP user message, is a 32 bit
time-stamp. The receiving network entity will accept an operation only if the
time-stamp is within a certain time-window. The resolution of the clock from
which the time-stamp is derived is 0.1 seconds. The size of the time-window at
the receiving network entity is not standardised.
**\- [SS7-SEG Id:]{.underline}**
1 octet used to create different IV values for different SS7-SEGs within the
same TVP period. It is necessary and sufficient that _SS7-SEG Id_ is unique
per network. (This is sufficient because sending keys are unique per network)
The SS7-SEG Id shall be a unique number within the network.
**\- [Proprietary field (PROP):]{.underline}**
1 octet used to create different IV values for different protected TCAP user
messages within the same TVP period for one network entity. The usage of the
proprietary field is not standardised.
### 5.5.2 Protected payload
#### 5.5.2.1 Protection Mode 1
The protected payload of secured TCAP user messages in protection mode 1 takes
the following form:
* * *
Cleartext\|\| f7(Security Header\|\|Cleartext)
* * *
where \"Cleartext\" is the concatenation of DialoguePortion and
ComponentPortion of the original TCAP message (after message reassembly if
this applies). Therefore, in Protection Mode 1 the protected payload is a
concatenation of the following information elements:
\- Cleartext
\- Message authentication code (MAC-M) calculated by the function f7
Authentication of origin and message integrity are achieved by applying the
message authentication code (MAC-M) function f7 with the integrity key defined
by the security association to the concatenation of Security Header and
Cleartext. The MAC-M length shall be 32 bits.
#### 5.5.2.2 Protection Mode 2
The protected payload of secured TCAP user Messages in protection mode 2 takes
the following form:
* * *
f6( Cleartext) \|\| f7(Security Header\|\| f6( Cleartext))
* * *
where \"Cleartext\" is the concatenation of DialoguePortion and
ComponentPortion of the original TCAP message (after message reassembly if
this applies). Confidentiality is achieved by encrypting Cleartext using the
encryption function f6 with the confidentiality key defined by the security
association and the initialisation vector (IV). Authentication of origin and
integrity are achieved by applying the message authentication code (MAC-M)
function f7 with the integrity key defined by the security association to the
concatenation of Security Header and ciphertext. The MAC-M length shall be 32
bits. The length of the ciphertext is the same as the length of the cleartext.
## 5.6 TCAPsec algorithms
### 5.6.1 Mapping of TCAPsec SA encryption algorithm identifiers
The SEA algorithm indication fields in the TCAPsec SA are used to identify the
encryption algorithm and algorithm mode to be used. The mapping of algorithm
identifiers is defined below.
Table 1: SS7 Security Gateway encryption algorithm identifiers
* * *
Encryption Algorithm identifier Description 0 AES in counter mode with 128â€‘bit
key length (MANDATORY) 1 -not yet assigned- : -not yet assigned- 15 -not yet
assigned-
* * *
#### 5.6.1.1 Description of SEA-0
The SEA-0 algorithm is AES [5] used in counter mode with a 128-bit key and
128-bit counter blocks as described in clause 6.5 of FIPS 800-38A
Recommendation for Block Cipher Modes of Operation [3]. The initial counter
block T~1~ is initialized with IV. Successive counter blocks T~j~ (J>1) are
derived by applying an incrementing function over the entire block T~j-1~
(J>=2) (see Appendix B.1: The standard incrementing function of [3]).
### 5.6.2 Mapping of TCAPsec SA integrity algorithm identifiers
The SIA algorithm indication fields in the TCAPsec SA are used to identify the
integrity algorithm and algorithm mode to be used. The mapping of algorithm
identifiers is defined below.
Table 2: SS7 Security Gateway integrity algorithm identifiers
* * *
Integrity Algorithm identifier Description 0 AES in a CBC MAC mode with a
128â€‘bit key (MANDATORY) 1 -not yet assigned- : -not yet assigned- 15 -not yet
assigned-
* * *
#### 5.6.2.1 Description of SIA-0
The SIA-0 algorithm is the ISO/IEC 9797 Part 1: padding method 2, MAC
algorithm 1 (initial transformation=1, output transformation=1). No IV used.
The MAC-length m is 32-bits (see clause 5.6.1). See ISO/IEC 9797 [4] for more
information.
### 5.6.3 Construction of IV
The IV used in the encryption shall be constructed as follows:
_IV = TVP \|\| SS7-SEG Id \|\| Prop \|\| Pad_
The padding field is used to expand _TVP \|\| SS7-SEG Id \|\| Prop_ to the
_IV_ length required by the cryptographic scheme in use.
The IV length shall be 16 octets. The padding (Pad) shall be 10 octets with
all bits set to zero.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Guidelines for manual key management
# A.1 Inter-domain Security Association and Key Management Procedures
Manual Inter-domain Security Association and Key Management procedures is
subject to roaming agreements.
Some important parts of an inter-domain Security Association and Key
Management agreement are:
\- to define how to carry out the initial exchange of TCAPsec SAs;
\- to define how to renew the TCAPsec SAs;
\- to define how to withdraw TCAPsec SAs (including requirements on how fast
to execute the withdrawal);
\- to decide if fallback to unprotected mode is to be allowed;
\- to decide on key lengths, algorithms, protection mode, and SA expiry times,
etc (TCAPsec SAs are expected to be fairly long lived).
An SA being used by an SS7-SEG for incoming traffic expires when it reaches
its hard expiry time. When this occurs, the SS7-SEG can no longer use that SA
to process incoming TCAPsec traffic. If a new additional valid SA is installed
into the SS7-SEG, the \"old\" one shall still be kept until it reaches its
hard expiry time, so as to be able to accept incoming traffic still received
under the \"old\" SA.
An SA being used by an SS7-SEG for outgoing traffic expires when it reaches
its soft expiry time. When this occurs, the SS7-SEG shall start using another
valid SA. If no such valid SA exists, the SS7-SEG continues to use the \"old\"
SA until it reaches its hard expiry time or another valid SA effectively
becomes available.
In case the current SA gets compromised, a new valid SA should be made
immediately available to all SS7-SEG, which should then stop using the
compromised SA and delete it.
To ease SA renewal, both networks may decide to set up several TCAPsec SAs in
advance so that SS7-SEGs can automatically switch from one SA to another SA.
In such a situation, the TCAPsec SAs would have different soft and hard expiry
times.
When more than one valid SA is available, the SS7-SEG chooses the one with the
earliest soft expiry time.
# A.2 Local Security Association Distribution
Manual Local Security Association Distribution is executed entirely within one
network and is consequently at the discretion of the administrative authority.
The requirement on the manual distribution procedures can be summarized as
follows:
\- Procedures for transporting the relevant TCAPsec SA to the SS7-SEG shall be
defined. In order to ensure that the TCAPsec SA are present when needed, all
valid TCAPsec SA should be distributed to all SS7-SEG as soon as they are
available.
\- Procedures for revocation of TCAPsec SAs shall be defined.
###### ## Annex B (normative): TCAPsec message flows
Imagine a network scenario with two SS7-SEG at different PLMNs (SS7-SEGa in
the sending PLMN A and a SS7-SEGb in the receiving PLMN B) willing to
communicate using TCAPsec. Figure 1 presents the message flow.
Figure B-1. TCAPsec Message Flow
NOTE: The same migrations can be applied within the Hub-and-spoke Architecture
where one or both of the PLMNs take the role of an SS7 carrier.
According to Figure 1, when SS7-SEGa from PLMN A on behalf of NEa needs to
send a message towards NEb within PLMN B using TCAPsec, the process is the
following:
The Sending Entity SS7-SEGa performs the following actions during the outbound
processing of every TCAP user message:
1\. SS7-SEGa checks its Security Policy Database (SPD) to check if TCAPsec
mechanisms shall be applied towards PLMN B:
a) If the SPD does not mandate the use of TCAPsec for the TCAP user
application part towards PLMN B, then normal TCAP communication procedures
will be used and the process continues in step 4.
b) If the SPD mandates the use of TCAPsec for the TCAP user application part
towards PLMN B, then the process continues at step 2.
c) If no valid entry in the SPD is found for PLMN B, then the communication is
aborted and the message is discarded.
2\. SS7-SEGa checks its Security Association Database (SAD) for a valid
Security Association (SA) to be used towards PLMN B. In the case where more
than one valid SA is available at the SAD, SS7-SEGa shall choose the one, the
soft expiry time of which will be reached next.
a) In case protection of TCAPsec messages towards PLMN B is not possible (e.g.
no SA available, invalid SA...), then the message is discarded.
b) If a valid SA exists then the process continues at step 3.
3\. SS7-SEGa constructs the TCAPsec message towards NEb using the parameters
(keys, algorithms) found in the SA and the protection mode from the SPD.
4\. SS7-SEGa either:
a) sends a TCAPsec message towards PLMN B (from step 3).
b) forwards an unprotected TCAP message in the event that the SPD towards PLMN
B allowed it (step 1.a).
At the Receiving PLMN, an SS7-SEG (e.g. SS7-SEGb) performs the following
actions during the inbound processing of every TCAP user message it received:
5\. If a TCAP message is received for which no valid SPD entry exists (i.e.
SCCP calling party address is unknown) then the message is discarded (Process
goes to END).
6\. If an unprotected TCAP message is received, the process continues with
step 7.
Otherwise, SS7-SEGb decomposes the received TCAPsec message and retrieves SPI
from the security header.
7\. The SS7-SEGb checks the SPD:
An unprotected TCAP message is received:
a) If an unprotected TCAP message is received and fallback to unprotected mode
is allowed for the specified SCCP calling party address and TCAP user
application part, then the unprotected TCAP message is simply processed
(Process goes to END)
b) If an unprotected TCAP message is received, but the SPD mandates the use of
TCAPsec and fallback to unprotected mode is NOT allowed for the specified SCCP
calling party address and TCAP user application part, then the message is
discarded.
A TCAPsec message is received:
c) If a TCAPsec message is received, but the SPD indicates that TCAPsec is NOT
to be used, then the message is discarded.
d) If a TCAPsec message is received and the SPD indicates that TCAPsec is
required, then the process continues at step 8.
8\. The receiving SS7-SEG checks its SAD to retrieve the relevant SA
information for processing of the TCAPsec message:
a) If the received SPI does not point to a valid SA, then the message is
discarded.
b) If the received SPI points to a valid SA, and if the Source and Destination
Network Id, which are retrieved via the SPI, align with those from SCCP layer,
then the SS7-SEG retrieves the protection mode from the SPD and the
cryptographic information (keys, algorithms) from the SAD and the process
continues at step 9, otherwise the message is discarded.
9\. Freshness of the protected message is checked by ensuring the Time Variant
Parameter (TVP) is in an acceptable window. Integrity and encryption
mechanisms are applied to the message according to the identified protection
level, by using the information in the SA (keys, algorithms).
a) If the result after applying such mechanisms is NOT successful then the
message is discarded.
b) If the result after applying such procedures is successful, then SS7-SEG
has the cleartext TCAP message NEa originally wanted to send to NEb. The
cleartext TCAP message can now be forwarded by the receiving SS7-SEG to NEb
(Process goes to END)
END: A cleartext TCAP user message is available at the receiving SS7-SEG.
In the event the received message at NEb requires an answer to NEa (Return
Result/Error), an SS7 SEG in PLMN B will, on behalf of NEb perform the process
in steps 1 to 4 acting as the Sender and an SS7 SEG in PLMN A will perform the
process in steps 5 to 8 acting as the Receiver and forward a successfully
received message to NEa.
###### ## Annex C (informative): High level migration strategy
This Annex describes three types of protection mode changes, which each may be
performed per TCAP user application part between a pair of networks.
NOTE: The same migrations can be applied within the Hub-and-spoke Architecture
where one or both of the PLMNs take the role of an SS7 carrier.
# C.1 Transition phase from unprotected to protected message transfer
**By applying a migration strategy which is coordinated between the two PLMN
operators (A and B) it can be assured that protected messages are not sent
from PLMN A to PLMN B (and vice versa) before operator B confirms completion
of SS7-SEG introduction in his network.**
In order to avoid traffic interruption during the transition phase from
unprotected to protected message transfer between tw' operators\' PLMNs the
following course of action is recommended:
Precondition: It is assumed that neither operator A, nor operator B have
activated TCAPsec for the TCAP user application part(s) that needs protection
and now are going to set up use of TCAP user security for traffic to and from
each other.
1\. Operator A negotiates Security Associations with operator B and stores the
SAs in the SAD. Both operators also agree on the policy that shall be applied
for the different TCAP user application parts of the messages that needs to be
exchanges between the PLMNs.
2\. Operator A modifies the Security Policy in his gateways as follows:
Messages received from operator B's PLMN should be protected according to the
indicated protection mode by the SPD; however fallback to unprotected mode is
allowed, i.e. unprotected messages received from'operator B\'s PLMN are not
blocked. This means that incoming messages with an SCCP calling party address
pointing to operator B are accepted by PLMN A. Operator A does not send
protected messages yet.
NOTE 1: When fallback to unprotected mode is allowed then other security
measures may be used that assist in identifying the origin of the message to a
certain trust level, e.g. TCAP handshake for MTforwardSM (see Annex D).
NOTE 2: As the fallback indicator can be specified per TCAP user application
part between a pair of PLMN, this allows a gradual security upgrade.
3\. When Operator A has completed step 2 in all his SS7-SEGs, he informs
Operator B.
4\. When Operator A receives confirmation that operator B also has performed
step 2, Operator A modifies the Security Policy in his gateways as follows:
Outgoing messages sent to operator B's PLMN shall be protected as indicated by
the SPD.
5\. When Operator A has completed step 4 in all his SS7-SEGs, he informs
Operator B which can then perform step 4 and 6 towards Operator A.
6\. When Operator A receives confirmation from Operator B that he has
performed step 4, Operator A modifies the Security Policy in his gateways as
follows: Fallback to unprotected mode is not allowed, i.e. unprotected
messages received from'operator B\'s PLMN will be blocked.
NOTE 3: After disabling fallback to unprotected mode then other security
measures that are in use and that assist in identifying the origin of the
message to a certain trust level, e.g. TCAP handshake for MTforwardSM (see
Annex D), can be disabled.
# C.2 Transition phase from protected message transfer to unprotected message
transfer.
In order to avoid traffic interruption during the transition phase from
protected to unprotected message transfer between two operators\' PLMNs, the
following course of action is recommended:
Precondition: It is assumed that operator A has already successfully set up
the use of TCAP user security for traffic to and from operator B and is now
going to remove use of TCAP user security for traffic to and from operator B.
1) Operator A modifies the Security Policy in his gateways as follows:
Messages received from operator B\'s PLMN may still be protected according to
the stored SA, however fallback to unprotected mode is allowed.
NOTE: Before setting fallback to unprotected mode to allowed, other security
measures may be activated that assist in identifying the origin of the message
to a certain trust level, e.g. TCAP handshake for MTforwardSM (see Annex D).
2) When Operator A has completed step 1 in all his SS7-SEGs, he informs
Operator B.
3) When Operator A receives confirmation from Operator B that all SS7-SEGs in
Operator B\'s PLMN have been set up to allow fallback to unprotected mode,
Operator A changes the SPD entries to send unprotected outgoing messages via
his SS7-SEGs, but allow the reception of protected messages from network B.
4) When Operator A has completed step 3 in all his SS7-SEGs, he informs
Operator B.
5) When Operator A receives confirmation from Operator B that the SPD entries
were changed to unprotected in all SS7-SEGs of Operator B\'s network, Operator
A performs the similar change in his SS7-SEGs.
# C.3 Transition phase from protected mode to another protected mode
In order to avoid traffic interruption during the phase where the used
protection mode is modified in the SS7-SEGs\' SPDs, the following course of
action is recommended:
Precondition: It is assumed that operator A\'s policy is to protect all
messages exchanged with operator B\'s PLMN with protection mode
\"integrity+authenticity\"; now both Operators are going to modify the policy
to protect messages sent to the other PLMN with protection mode
\"integrity+authenticity+confidentiality\".
NOTE: The transition from protection mode
\"integrity+authenticity+confidentiality\" to protected mode
\"integrity+authenticity\" is similar as described below but with the
protection modes reversed.
1) Operator A and B both modify the SPD by adding
\"integrity+authenticity+confidentiality\" to the acceptable protection modes,
i.e. they will now allow both \"integrity+authenticity+confidentiality\" and
\"integrity+authenticity\" as acceptable protection modes, but outgoing
messages are still sent with \"integrity+authenticity\".
2) When step 1 is completed in all SS7-SEGs of Operator B\'s PLMN, Operator A
is informed. Similarly Operator A will inform Operator B after performing the
actions of Step 1.
3) When Operator A (or Operator B) receives confirmation from Operator B (or
Operator A) that the SPDs in all SS7-SEGs have been updated to accept the new
protection mode in addition to the old one, Operator A (or operator B)
modifies the SPD such that outgoing messages in his SS7-SEGs towards Operator
B (or operator A) are send with only with protection mode
\"integrity+authenticity+confidentiality\".
4) When step 3 is completed in all SS7-SEGs of Operator A\'s (or Operator B's)
PLMN, he informs Operator B (or Operator A).
5) When receiving confirmation that the SPDs have been updated in all SS7-SEGs
of Operator A (or Operators B\'s) PLMN, Operator B (or Operator A) modifies
the SPD by removing \"integrity+authenticity\" from the acceptable protection
modes.
###### ## Annex D (normative): Using TCAP handshake for SMS transfer
The SMS Gateway/Interworking MSC operator and the serving node (MSC or SGSN)
operator may agree to use the TCAP handshake as a countermeasure against SMS
fraud for messages exchanged between their networks (for detailed message
flows see TS 29.002 [2]). A limited level of authenticity is provided by the
following mechanisms.
# D.1 Mobile Terminated SMS
Figure D.1: MAP mt-Forward-SM messages using a TCAP Handshakes
If the serving network receives an mt-forward-SM MAP message which uses the
TC_Continue to transfer the MAP payload then it is guaranteed that the SCCP
calling party address of the (empty) TC_Begin message is authentic, otherwise
the first TC-continue message would be sent to the falsified address. The
correct message flow is guaranteed by the TCAP transaction capabilities (use
of Transaction ID).
Unfortunately there are some ways in which a fraudulent SMS Gateway operator
(called the originator in bullets (a) and (b)) may try to circumvent the
implicit SCCP address authentication provided by the TCAP handshake.
(a) The originator includes a falsified SMS-GMSC address as SM-RP-OA in the
mt-forward-SM payload carried by the TC-continue (third message in figure D.1)
(b) The originator tries to predict the TCAP transaction ID assigned by the
serving node, which is to be used within the third message, and spoofs the
third message without waiting for the second message. This attack has to be
carried out within the right time window.
If TCAP handshake is to be used, the following measure shall be taken within
the network of the serving node in order to counteract the spoofing
possibilities of a malicious mt-Forward-SM originator.
MEAS-1: The receiving network shall verify if the received SMS-GMSC address
(as SM-RP-OA in the third message) may be used from the SCCP Calling Party
Address. Some operators use a single SMS-GMSC address for a range of SCCP
Calling Party Addresses and this will need to be taken into consideration.
If TCAP handshake is to be used, at least one of the following measures shall
be taken within the network of the serving node in order to counteract the
spoofing possibilities of a malicious mt-Forward-SM originator.
MEAS-2a: The receiving node shall use mechanisms to ensure that the
destination TCAP transaction ID which needs to be used within the third
message is predictable with a probability of less than 1 / 2^10^ for a third
party knowing all previous TCAP transaction ID values.
MEAS-2b: The receiving network shall wait n seconds before it processes the
third message (TC-continue(mt-forwardSM with payload)). This should ensure
that the TC_abort from the spoofed network is processed at the destination
node earlier than a TC_continue including a successfully guessed TCAP
Transaction ID value.
The following grouping method may be used for an operator to gradually
introduce the TCAP handshake for mt-Forward-SM messages. Define an 'operator
group-1' as a trusted operator group and 'operator group-2' as an un-trusted
operator group. Agree that group-1 uses the TCAP handshake, while group-2 does
not use the TCAP handshake. As specified by TS 29.002 [2] this requires that
the SMS Gateway operators belonging to group-1 shall either use application
context2 or 3 for mt-Forward-SM. The management of the two groups requires
that the serving network shall implement a policy table of SCCP Calling Party
Addresses for which a TCAP handshake is required.
If the above described grouping method is used then the following measure
shall be taken at the serving network in order to counteract the spoofing
possibilities of a malicious mt-Forward-SM originator that tries to circumvent
the policy table checks.
MEAS-3: The serving network shall verify that the SCCP Calling Party Address
of a first message with a payload (i.e. not using the TCAP handshake) is not
from an SMS-GMSC-address as SM-RP-OA that shall use the TCAP handshake.
The benefit gained for operators that belong to group-1 is that spoofing of
their SMS-GMSC-addresses is practically difficult if the policy table has been
administrated accurately.
# D.2 Mobile Originated SMS
Figure D.2: MAP mo-Forward-SM messages using a TCAP Handshakes
If the serving network sends an mo-forward-SM MAP message which uses the
TC_Continue to transfer the MAP payload then it is guaranteed that the SCCP
calling party address of the (empty) TC_Begin message is authentic, otherwise
the first TC-continue message would be sent to the falsified address. The
correct message flow is guaranteed by the TCAP transaction capabilities (use
of Transaction ID).
Unfortunately there are some ways in which a fraudulent serving (MSC or SGSN)
operator (called the originator in bullets (a) and (b)) may try to circumvent
the implicit SCCP address authentication provided by the TCAP handshake.
(a) The originator includes a falsified MSISDN as SM-RP-OA within the mo-
forward-SM payload carried by the TC-continue (third message in figure D.2)
(b) The originator tries to predict the TCAP transaction ID assigned by the
serving node, which is to be used within the third message, and spoofs the
third message without waiting for the second message. This attack has to be
carried out within the right time window.
If TCAP handshake is to be used, the following measure may be taken within the
network of the SMS Interworking MSC in order to counteract the spoofing
possibilities of a malicious mo-Forward-SM originator.
MEAS-1: The receiving node (i.e. SMS interworking MSC) may query the HLR to
verify if the received SCCP Calling Party Address of the mo-forward-SM is from
the same network which is currently serving the subscriber (MSISDN contained
in SM-RP-OA in the third message).
If the TCAP handshake is to be used, then at least one of MEAS-2a and MEAS-2b
of clause D.1 shall also be applied.
The following grouping method may be used for an operator to gradually
introduce the TCAP handshake for mo-Forward-SM messages. Define an \'operator
group-1\' as a trusted operator group and \'operator group-2\' as an un-
trusted operator group. Agree that group-1 uses the TCAP handshake, while
group-2 does not use the TCAP handshake. As specified by TS 29.002 [2] this
requires that the MSC operators belonging to group-1 shall either use
application context2 or 3 for mo-Forward-SM. The management of the two groups
requires that the network of the SMS Interworking MSC shall implement a policy
table of originating SCCP-addresses for which a TCAP handshake is required.
If the above described grouping method is used then the following measure
shall be taken at the network of the SMS Interworking MSC in order to
counteract the spoofing possibilities of a malicious mo-Forward-SM originator
that tries to circumvent the policy table checks.
MEAS-3: The SMS Interworking MSC shall verify that the SCCP Calling Party
address of a first message with a payload (i.e. not using the TCAP handshake)
is not from an address that shall use the TCAP handshake.
The benefit gained for operators that belong to group-1 is that mo-Forward-SM
spoofing for their subscribers, while roaming within group-1, becomes
practically difficult if the policy table has been administrated accurately.
