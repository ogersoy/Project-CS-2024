# 4 MME-specific security requirements and related test cases
## 4.1 Introduction
The structure of the present TS 33.116 is aligned with TS 33.117 such that the
MME-specific adaptation of a generic requirement in 33.sas, clause 4.a.b.c.d,
can be always found in TS 33.116, clause 4.a.b.c.d. The text on pre-requisites
for testing in clause 4.1.2 of TS 33.117 [3] applies also to the present
document.
## 4.2 MME-specific adaptations of security functional requirements and
related test cases
### 4.2.1 Introduction
### 4.2.2 Security functional requirements on the MME deriving from 3GPP
specifications and related test cases
#### 4.2.2.1 Security functional requirements on the MME deriving from 3GPP
specifications -- general approach
In addition to the requirements and test cases in TS 33.117, clause 4.2.2, an
MME shall satisfy the following:
It is assumed for the purpose of the present SCAS that an MME conforms to all
mandatory security-related provisions pertaining to an MME in:
\- 3GPP TS 33.401: \"EPS security architecture\";
\- other 3GPP specifications that make reference to TS 33.401 or are referred
to from TS 33.401 (e.g. TS 23.401 [7]).
Security procedures pertaining to an MME are typically embedded in mobility
management procedures and are hence assumed to be tested together with them.
Examples include:
\- AKA authentication is embedded in an Attach procedure or a TAU procedure.
\- Security Mode Control is embedded in an Attach procedure or a TAU
procedure.
\- The derivation of a mapped security context is embedded in inter-RAT
mobility procedures.
#### 4.2.2.2 Authentication and key agreement procedure
##### 4.2.2.2.1 Access with 2G SIM forbidden
_Requirement Name_ : 2G SIM access forbidden
_Requirement Reference:_ TBA
_Requirement Description_ : \"Access to E-UTRAN with a 2G SIM or a SIM
application on a UICC shall not be granted.\" as specified in TS 33.401,
clause 6.1.1.
_Threat References_ : TBA
_Security Objective References_ : TBA
_Test Case_ :
**Purpose:**
Verify that access to EPS with a 2G SIM is not possible.
**Pre-Conditions:**
Test environment with HSS. HSS may be simulated.
**Execution Steps**
Include 2G authentication vector in _authentication data response_ from HSS.
**Expected Results:**
MME rejects UE authentication when receiving 2G authentication vector from
HSS.
NOTE: When both MME and HSS function correctly 2G authentication vector are
never included in authentication data response from HSS to MME.
##### 4.2.2.2.2 Re-synchronization
_Requirement Name_ : Inclusion of RAND, AUTS
_Requirement Reference:_ TBA
_Requirement Description_ : \"In the case of a synchronization failure, the
MME shall also include RAND and AUTS.\" as specified in TS 33.401, clause
6.1.2.
_Threat References_ : TBA
_Security Objective References_ : TBA
_Test Case_ : **Purpose:**
Verify that Re-synchronization procedure works correctly.
**Pre-Conditions:**
Test environment with UE and HSS. UE and HSS may be simulated.
**Execution Steps**
The MME receives an AUTHENTICATION FAILURE message, with the EMM cause #21
\"synch failure\" and a re‑synchronization token AUTS.
**Expected Results:**
The MME includes the stored RAND and the received AUTS in the _authentication
data request_ to the HSS.
NOTE: When RAND and AUTS are not included in the authentication data request
to the HSS then the HSS will return a new authentication vector (AV) based on
its current value of the sequence number SQN~HE~ (cf. TS 33.102, clause 6.3.5)
A new authentication procedure between MME and UE using this new AV will be
successful just the same if the cause of the synchronisation failure was the
sending of a \"stale\" challenge, i.e. one that the UE had seen before or
deemed to be too old. But if the cause of the synchronisation failure was a
problem with the sequence number SQN~HE~ in the HSS (which should be very
rare), and the RAND and AUTS are not included in the authentication data
request to the HSS, then an update of SQN~HE~ based on AUTS will not occur in
the HSS, and the new authentication procedure between MME and UE using the new
AV will fail again. This can be considered a security-relevant failure case as
it may lead to a subscriber being shut out from the system permanently.

The old MME sends a response indicating that the user identity cannot be
retrieved.

priority according to the ordered lists and is contained in the UE EPS
security capabilities. The MME checks the message authentication code on the
SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message.
2\. The MAC in the SECURITY MODE COMPLETE is verified, and the NAS integrity
protection algorithm is selected and applied correctly.
