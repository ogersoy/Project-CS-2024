# 4 Catalogue of security requirements and related test cases
## 4.1 Introduction
### 4.1.1 Pre-requisites for testing
The SCAS tests, as described in the present specification, are to be applied
to a network product whose software and hardware has been brought into use so
that the network product can provide the intended functionality, either in a
real network environment or in a simulated environment. This implies that,
before any testing is performed, the hardware and software has been installed
correctly, the network product is powered on, and communication has been
established over all standardized interfaces and OAM interfaces related with
the network product\'s functionality, as described in the vendor\'s
documentation.
Communication over external non standardized Interfaces that may exist and are
marked as optional, according to the vendor\'s documentation, shall also be
established during testing unless they are explicitly marked as \"not
recommended\" in the vendor\'s documentation.
For each of the enabled external communication interfaces there may be various
optional capabilities. During testing, all such capabilities shall be enabled
unless they are explicitly marked as \"not recommended\" in the vendor\'s
documentation.
In some cases a testcase might require configuration changes as part of the
execution steps or pre-conditions. After such test is executed and prior any
further test execution it needs to be ensured that the state of the ToE is
restored back in the original state.
SCAS testing is not about security in operations and deployments. So, in
particular, SCAS testing is independent of any operator guidelines or
considerations on specific deployment scenarios.
### 4.1.2 Use of tools in testing
The following text shall apply to all test cases described in the present
document:
The present document takes into account that the landscape of testing tools
evolves more rapidly than SCAS specifications. It is therefore allowed that,
for each requirement, the actual test carried out may deviate from the
stepwise description of the test case in the present document if the following
conditions are fulfilled:
(1) The test is carried out by preferably using Commercial-of-the-Shelf (COTS)
and Free-Open-Source-Software (FOSS) tools that are available for other
testers that may want to repeat the test. In case a tool not in any of these
two categories is used then evidence of the quality assurance of the tool
needs to be provided. This applies only to tools used to perform the actual
test and not supportive tools needed for setting up the testing environment
like for example traffic generators/ simulators.
> In cases where a test lab is not able to obtain the necessary tools to
> perform the test, vendor proprietary test tools may be used by the test lab
> as long the test tool is controlled under a suitable quality management
> system (QMS). The test lab ensures that this QMS is in place in order to
> avail of a vendor's test tool.
>
> Additionally in cases where the accredited test lab does not have the
> necessary test environment to perform a test, it shall be possible for the
> accredited test lab personnel to perform the test in a vendor\'s test lab.
> In such cases the accredited lab should record details of test environment,
> test set-up used and how the test was performed.
(2) The tester provides evidence, e.g. by referring to the documentation of
the tool, that the tool is suitable to verify the requirement, and the scope
of testing is equal or larger to the one of the test case described in the
present document. The evidence needs to be sufficiently detailed for experts
in the field of testing, not for the general public.
(3) The tester provides evidence that the tool has been actually used for
testing the network product (e.g. by providing a trace).
### 4.1.3 Documentation Requirements
When a test case makes an assumption on the availability of certain items in
the product documentation then this assumption is to be considered part of the
requirement even if the requirements text does not mention the documentation.
## 4.2 Security functional requirements and related test cases
### 4.2.1 Introduction
The present clause describes the security functional requirements and the
corresponding test cases, independent of a specific network product class. In
particular the proposed security requirements are classified in two groups:
\- Security functional requirements deriving from 3GPP specifications and
detailed in clause 4.2.2
\- General security functional requirements which include requirements not
already addressed in the 3GPP specifications but whose support is also
important to ensure a network product conforms to a common security baseline
detailed in clasue 4.2.3.
### 4.2.2 Security functional requirements deriving from 3GPP specifications
and related test cases
#### 4.2.2.1 Security functional requirements deriving from 3GPP
specifications -- general approach
The present clause describes the general approach taken towards security
functional requirements deriving from 3GPP specifications and the
corresponding test cases, independent of a specific network product class.
It is assumed for the purpose of the present SCAS that a network product
conforms to all mandatory security-related provisions in 3GPP specifications
pertaining to it, in particular:
\- all 3GPP specifications of the 33-series (security specifications) that are
pertinent to the network product class;
\- other 3GPP specifications that make reference to security specifications or
are referred to from one of them.
3GPP has decided to develop test specifications for the UE in the TSs of the
34-series under the responsibility of Working Group RAN5. 3GPP saw, however,
no need to develop test specifications for network elements. For network
elements, 3GPP rather trusts that tests are run under the responsibility of
the vendors.
Security procedures pertaining to a network product are typically embedded in
non-security procedures and are hence assumed to be tested together with them.
It is the purpose of the present SCAS to identify security requirements from
the EPS security architecture that require special attention in testing as
they may:
(a) lead to vulnerabilities when not satisfied;
(b) not be captured through ordinary testing activity for non-security
procedures;
(c) address security-relevant failure cases and exceptions or \'negative\'
requirements of the kind: \"The network product shall not...\"
It is not an intention of the present document to provide an exhaustive set of
test cases that would be sufficient to demonstrate conformance of all security
procedures with the above-mentioned specifications.
### 4.2.3 Technical baseline
#### 4.2.3.1 Introduction
The technical baseline is a generic set of security requirements to be
fulfilled by all network products.
#### In particular these requirements counter the security threats and
objectives identified in the TR 33.926 [4] and they basically aim to guarantee
the network product confidentiality, integrity and availability.4.2.3.2
Protecting data and information
##### 4.2.3.2.1 Protecting data and information -- general
Adequate security measures for protecting sensitive data shall be implemented
as defined in the present document. Further measures (that are beyond the
scope of the present document) may be required by local regulation depending
on the classification of the data and other factors such as type of network
used during transmission, storage location for data, etc.
##### 4.2.3.2.2 Protecting data and information -- Confidential System
Internal Data
_Requirement Name_ : Unauthorized Viewing
_Requirement Description_ : When the system is not in maintenance mode, there
shall be no system function that reveals confidential system internal data in
the clear to users and administrators. Such functions could be, for example,
local or remote OAM CLI or GUI, logging messages, alarms, configuration file
exports etc. Confidential system internal data contains authentication data
(i.e. PINs, cryptographic keys, passwords, cookies) as well as system internal
data that is not required for systems administration and could be of advantage
to attackers (i.e. stack traces in error messages).
_Security Objective references_ : tba.
_Test case_ :
**Test Name** : TC_CONFIDENTIAL_SYSTEM_INTERNAL_DATA
**Purpose:**
Verify that no system function reveals sensitive data in the clear
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Condition:**
The vendor shall provide documentation describing how confidential system
internal information that could possibly be revealed in clear-text is handled
by system functions.
A list of all system functions in the network product, information on how to
enable and execute them should be provided as a part of the vendor\'s
documentation. A system function is every function implemented in the network
product needed by the services/functionalities provided by the network product
itself.
**Execution Steps**
**Execute the following steps:**
1\. Review the documentation provided by the vendor describing how
confidential system internal information is handled by system functions.
2\. The tester checks if all system functions as described in the product
documentation (e.g. local or remote OAM CLI or GUI, logging messages, alarms,
error messages, configuration file exports, stack traces) whether they reveal
any confidential system internal data in the clear (for example, passphrases).
**Expected Results:**
There should be no confidential system internal data revealed in the clear by
each system function.
**Expected format of evidence:**
Evidence suitable for the interface, e.g. screenshot containing the
operational results.
##### 4.2.3.2.3 Protecting data and information in storage
_Requirement Name_ : Protecting data and information in storage
_Requirement Description_ :
For sensitive data in (persistent or temporary) storage read access rights
shall be restricted. Files of a system that are needed for the functionality
shall be protected against manipulation.
In addition, the following rules apply for:
\- Systems that need access to identification and authentication data in the
clear, e.g. in order to perform an authentication. Such systems shall not
store this data in the clear, but scramble or encrypt it by implementation-
specific means.
\- Systems that do not need access to sensitive data (e.g. user passwords) in
the clear. Such systems shall hash this sensitive data .
\- Stored files on the network product: examples for protection against
manipulation are the use of checksum or cryptographic methods.
_Security Objective references:_ tba
_Test case:_
**Test Name** : TC_PSW_STOR_SUPPORT
**Purpose:**
Verify that Password storage use one-way hash algorithm.
**Procedure and execution steps:**
> **Pre-Conditions:**
\- The tester can access the storage of own user account password.
\- The tester has privileges to change the password.
\- The original password is P1.
> **Execution Steps**
1\. The tester accesses the storage where the result of P1 is, and the
corresponding hash value is recorded as A
2\. The tester changes the password with P2, then the tester record the
storage hash value of the new password as B
3\. The tester repeats the step 2 to get other records.
> 4\. The tester verifies whether all the records comply with the
> characteristic of one-way hash result.
>
> **Expected Results:**
All records comply with the characteristic of one-way hash result.
> **Expected format of evidence:**
Evidence suitable for the interface, e.g. screenshot contains the operation
results.
##### 4.2.3.2.4 Protecting data and information in transfer
_Requirement Name_ : tba
_Requirement Description_ :
\- Usage of cryptographically protected network protocols is required.
\- The transmission of data with a need of protection shall use industry
standard network protocols with sufficient security measures and industry
accepted algorithms. In particular, a protocol version without known
vulnerabilities or a secure alternative shall be used.
_Security Objective references_ : tba
_Test case_ :
**Test Name:** TC_PROTECT_DATA_INFO_TRANSFER_1
**Purpose:**
Verify the mechanisms implemented to protect data and information in transfer
to and from the Network Product\'s OAM interface.
NOTE: The test is limited to the OAM interface although the requirement does
not have this limitation because the protection of standardised interfaces
will be covered by regular interoperability testing and the proprietary use of
HTTPS is covered in clause 4.2.5.1.
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Conditions:**
Network product documentation containing information about supported OAM
protocols is provided by the vendor,
A peer implementing the security protocol configured by the vendor (e.g. SSH
client supporting SSHv2 or HTTPS client) shall be available.
Network product documentation stating which security protocols for protection
of data in transit are implemented and which profiles in TS 33.310 [5] and TS
33.210 [X] are applicable is provided by the vendor.
For TLS, the tester shall base the tests on the profile defined by 3GPP in TS
33.310 [5]. For IKE and IPsec, the tester shall base the tests on the profile
defined by 3GPP in TS 33.210 [X]. For protocols, for which 3GPP did not define
a security profile, e.g. SSH, the tester shall base the tests on a widely
recognised and publicly available security profile.
**Execution Steps**
1\. The tester shall check that compliance with the selected security profile
can be inferred from detailed provisions in the product documentation.
2\. The tester shall establish a secure connection between the network product
and the peer and verify that all protocol versions and combinations of
cryptographic algorithms that are mandated by the security profile are
supported by the network product.
3\. The tester shall try to establish a secure connection between the network
product and the peer and verify that this is not possible when the peer only
offers a feature, including protocol version and combination of cryptographic
algorithms, that is forbidden by the security profile.
**Expected Results:**
The traffic is properly protected, and insecure options are not accepted by
the Network Product.
**Expected format of evidence:**
Provide evidence of the check of the product documentation in plain text. Save
the logs and the communication flow in a .pcap file.
##### 4.2.3.2.5 Logging access to personal data
_Requirement Name_ : Logging access to personal data
_Requirement Description_ :
In some cases access to personal data in clear text might be required. If such
access is required, access to this data shall be logged, and the log shall
contain who accessed what data without revealing personal data in clear text.
When for practical purposes such logging is not available, a coarser grain
logging is allowed.
In some cases, the personal data stored in the log files may allow the direct
identification of a subscriber. In such cases, the revealed personal
information may not expose the subscriber to any kind of privacy violation.
_Test case_ :
**Test Name** : TC_LOGGING_ACCESS_TO_PERSONAL_DATA
**Purpose:**
Verify that in cases where a network product presents personal data in clear
text that access attempts to such data are logged and the log information
includes the user identity that has accessed the data. The test case also
verifies that the personal data itself is not included in clear text in the
log.
**Procedure and execution steps:**
> **Pre-Conditions:**
A document which provides a description of where personal data in clear text
is accessible on the network product, how it can be accessed, and details of
where such access attempts are logged and how to view these logs.
> **Execution Steps**
\- The tester verifies that for cases where personal data is accessible in
clear text that attempts to access it are recorded in a log, that the log
includes the user that has attempted to access the data and that the log does
not include the actual personal data in clear-text.
\- The tester repeats the check for each case where personal data is
accessible.
**Expected Results:**
All access attempts to personal data (in clear text) are recorded in the
described logs, with the user identity included and no personal data is
visible in the log.
**Expected format of evidence:**
Sample copies of the log files.
#### 4.2.3.3 Protecting availability and integrity
##### 4.2.3.3.1 System handling during overload situations
_Requirement Name_ : System handling during overload situations
_\- Requirement Description:_
The system shall provide security measures to deal with overload situations
which may occur as a result of a denial of service attack or during periods of
increased traffic. In particular, partial or complete impairment of system
availability shall be avoided. Potential protective measures include:
\- Restricting of available RAM per application
\- Restricting of maximum sessions for a Web application
\- Defining the maximum size of a dataset
\- Restricting CPU resources per process
\- Prioritizing processes
\- Limiting of amount or size of transactions of an user or from an IP address
in a specific time range
\- _Security Objective references_ : tba.
_Test case_ : Refer to clause test case in clause 4.2.3.3.3.
##### 4.2.3.3.2 Boot from intended memory devices only
_Requirement name_ : Boot from intended memory devices only
_Requirement reference_ : to be done later
_Requirement Description_ :
The network product can boot only from the memory devices intended for this
purpose.
_Test case_ :
**Test Name:** TC_BOOT_INT_MEM_1
**Purpose:**
Verify that the network product can only boot from memory devices intended for
this purpose (e.g. not from external memory like USB key).
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Conditions:**
A document which contains information regarding the firmware access mechanism
supported by the product and about the memory devices from which the network
product can boot.
**Execution Steps**
1\. The tester verifies that the network product is configured to boot from
memory devices declared in the network product document only.
2\. The tester verifies that there is not possible to access and modify the
firmware of the network product without successful authentication.
**Expected Results:**
The network product cannot boot from a memory device that is not configured in
its firmware, and access to the firmware is only possible with the correct
authentication.
**Expected format of evidence: NA**
##### 4.2.3.3.3 System handling during excessive overload situations
_Requirement Name_ : System handling during overload situations
_Requirement Description_ : The system shall act in a predictable way if an
overload situation cannot be prevented. A system shall be built in this way
that it can react on an overload situation in a controlled way. However it is
possible that a situation happens where the security measures are no longer
sufficient.
In such case it shall be ensured that the system cannot reach an undefined and
thus potentially insecure state. In an extreme case this means that a
controlled system shutdown is preferable to uncontrolled failure of the
security functions and thus loss of system protection.
The vendor shall provide a technical description of the network products\'
Over Load Control mechanisms (especially whether these mechanisms rely on
cooperation of other network elements e.g. eNode B) and the accompanying test
case for this requirement will check that the description provides sufficient
detail in order for an evaluator to understand how the mechanism is designed.
_Security Objective references_ : tba.

\- Description of the types of attacks that may cause an overload to the
network product and how these are handled.
\- A description of how the network product discards or handles input during
various overload situations including excessive overloads. i.e. where the
overload is significantly greater than the thresholds where overload detection
is triggered.
\- A description of how the network product security functions operate and
perform during overload.
\- A description of how the network product shuts down or performs or takes

items are not applicable.
The test results should:
\- Contain details of the overload conditions used in the test execution that
are consist with the technical description document.
\- Describe the test procedures used to verify the overload control
mechanisms.
\- Contain data which demonstrates/indicates that the overload control
mechanisms described in the technical description document have been
implemented.
\- Contains details of the test set-up including the mechanisms for creating
the overload.
**Expected format of evidence:**

##### 4.2.3.3.4 System robustness against unexpected input.
_Requirement Name_ : System robustness against unexpected input.
_Requirement Description_ : During transmission of data to a system it is
necessary to validate input to the network product before processing. This
includes all data which is sent to the system. Examples of this are user
input, values in arrays and content in protocols. The following typical
implementation error shall be avoided:
\- No validation on the lengths of transferred data

stage.
2) Network product shall support software package integrity validation via
cryptographic means, e.g. digital signature. To this end, the network product
has a list of public keys or certificates of authorised software sources, and
uses the keys to verify that the software update is originated from only these
sources.
3) Tampered software shall not be executed or installed if integrity check
fails.
4) A security mechanism is required to guarantee that only authorized
individuals can initiate and deploy a software update, and modify the list
mentioned in bullet 2.
_Security Objective references:_ SOFTWARE INTEGRITY
_Test case_ :
**Test Name:** TC_SW_PKG_INTEGRITY_1
**Purpose:**
Verify that:
1\. The Network Product validates the software package integrity during the
installation/upgrade stage.
2\. The software package integrity validation mechanism is performed using
cryptographic mechanisms, e.g. digital signature using the public keys or
certificates configured in the network product.
3\. Software that fails an integrity check is rejected by the network product.
4\. Only authorized users are allowed to install software.
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Conditions:**
\- A network product document containing information regarding software
package integrity checks, including details of how the integrity check is
carried out, where public keys or certificates of sources authorised to sign
software packages are stored on the network product and who these sources are,
and what evidence is created to prove that the integrity check has been
executed and what the result of the check was. Documentation which describes
the installation procedure including how a user is authorized and
authenticated to perform installation process.
\- A valid network product software load/package and one that is not-valid (or
could be deemed to have been tampered with) are available.
**Execution Steps**
The tester checks the permissions required to install software on the network
product ensuring that a user is properly authenticated by the network product
and that they have the required access privileges to perform the installation
activity.
The tester checks that when a software package is attempted to be installed on
the network product that the software package integrity check is executed
(check for evidence of execution as described in network product
documentation) and that valid software is allowed to be installed but invalid
software is rejected.
The tester checks the access control permissions for the software package
integrity checking process, the list of public keys of authorised software
sources, and any related credentials or keys for the process to ensure that
the process cannot be controlled by persons that are not authorized to do so.
**Expected Results:**
\- Evidence that the software package integrity check has been executed for
both cases of software installation (valid and invalid software packages).
\- Authentication and access control mechanisms are in operation for software
package installation and around the software package integrity checking
mechanism.
\- The installation/upgrade operation fails when using an invalid software
package.
\- The installation/upgrade operation is successful when using a valid
software package.
**Expected format of evidence:**
Snapshots containing the result of the installation of package A and B.
#### 4.2.3.4 Authentication and authorization

system functions that are locally accessible and those that are remotely
accessible via a network interface.
**Expected Results:**
1\. The network product does not allow to access to any system function
provided by the manufacturer without a successful user authentication.
**Expected format of evidence:**
A testing report provided by the testing agency which will consist of the
following information:
\- Description of executed tests and commands

##### 4.2.3.4.3.3 Protection against brute force and dictionary attacks
{#protection-against-brute-force-and-dictionary-attacks .H6}
_Requirement Name_ : Protection against brute force and dictionary attacks
_Requirement Description_ :
If a password is used as an authentication attribute, a protection against
brute force and dictionary attacks that hinder password guessing shall be
implemented.
Brute force and dictionary attacks aim to use automated guessing to ascertain
passwords for user and machine accounts. Various measures or a combination of
these measures can be taken to prevent this.
The most commonly used protection measures are:
1) Using the timer delay (this delay could be the same or increased depending
the operator\'s policy for each attempt) for each newly entered password input
following an incorrect entry (\"tar pit\").
2) Blocking an account following a specified number of incorrect attempts,
refer to 4.2.3.4.5. However it has to be taken into account that this solution
needs a process for unlocking and an attacker can force this to deactivate
accounts and make them unusable.
3) Using CAPTCHA to prevent automated attempts (often used for Web
applications).
4) Using a password blacklist to prevent vulnerable passwords.
NOTE 1: Password management and blacklist configuration may be done in a
separate node that is different to the node under test, e.g. a SSO server or
any other central credential manager.
In order to achieve higher security, it is often meaningful to combine two or
more of the measures named here. It is left to the vendor to select
appropriate measures.
Above requirements shall be applicable for all passwords used (e.g.
application-level, OS-level, etc.). An exception to this requirement is
machine accounts.
_Security Objective references_ : tba.
_Test case_ :
**Test Name** : TC_PROTECT_AGAINST_BRUTE_FORCE_AND_DICTIONARY_ATTACKS
This test applies only when the most commonly used protection measures used in
the requirement are implemented. If they are not implemented, then the vendor
documentation needs to provide alternative measures and the tester needs to
develop suitable tests for these alternative measures. Since a vendor is free
to select appropriate measures, only the vendor selected measures are to be
tested.
**Purpose:**
To ensure that the system uses a mechanism with adequate protection against
brute force and dictionary attacks
To check whether system follows commonly used preventive measures which are
mentioned below.
1\. Using the timer delay (e.g. doubling wait times after every incorrect
attempt) after each incorrect password input (\"tar pit\").
2\. Blocking an account following a specified number of incorrect attempts
(typically 5). However administrator has to keep in account that this solution
needs a process for unlocking and an attacker can utilize this process to
deactivate the accounts and make them unusable.
3\. Using CAPTCHA to prevent automated attempts (often used for Web
interface).
4\. Using a password blacklist to prevent vulnerable passwords.
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Conditions:**
1\. The password policy management of the network product is configured to use
the timer delay after each incorrect password input.
2\. The password policy management is configured to block an account following
a specified number of incorrect password attempts (typically 5).
3\. The web interface should be configured with CAPTCHA feature to prevent
automated attempts.
4\. CAPTCHA feature is optional and test is done only if implemented.
5\. A password blacklist is configured by the tester. At least one blacklisted
password (a password that meets the complexity criteria but is blacklisted) is
documented.
NOTE 2: Password management and blacklist configuration may be done in a
separate node that is different to the node under test, e.g. a SSO server or
any other central credential manager.
6\. Tester has valid credentials as an authorized user.
**Execution Steps**
Execute the following steps:
A. Positive Test
Case 1:
Test case to use the timer delay after each incorrect password input is

Case 3:
1\. The network product\'s login web interface is configured with CAPTCHA
feature.
2\. Tester enters the valid password and correct CAPTCHA
3\. Tester can successfully log into the network product.
In some cases the network product class can have two or more of the attack
prevention methods available, which are a combination of Cases 1-3. In such
cases the tester will need to run a combination of these test cases.
B. Negative Test
Case 1:
Test case to use the timer delay after each incorrect password input is
covered in clause 4.2.3.4.5.
Case 2:
Test case to block an account following a specified number of incorrect

that certain ICMP message types are dropped by the network product on receipt.
\- A tester machine is available and equipped with a suitable ICMP packets
generator tool.
**Execution Steps**
The following needs to be done for all IP protocol versions (IPv4 and/or IPv6)
supported by the network element.
For verifying that the network product does not reply to ICMP messages with
types where this is not permitted: The tester sends samples of the applicable
ICMP messages from the tester machine to the network product and verifies by
appropriate means that
\- the messages are dropped on receipt by the network product (e.g. by means
of appropriate firewall rules),
\- or no response is sent out towards the test machine,
\- or there are other means ensuring that the ICMP messages cannot trigger a
response.
For verifying that the network product does not change its configuration due
to receiving ICMP messages with types where this is not permitted: The tester
sends samples of the applicable ICMP messages from the tester machine to the
network product and verifies by appropriate means that
\- the messages are dropped on receipt by the network product (e.g. by means
of appropriate firewall rules),
\- or the network product\'s applicable system configuration remains unchanged
upon receipt of the messages,
\- or there are other means ensuring that the ICMP messages cannot lead to
configuration changes.

_Requirement Name_ : There shall not be a privilege escalation method in
interactive sessions (CLI or GUI) which allows a user to gain
administrator/root privileges from another user account without re-
authentication.
_Requirement Description_ :
There shall not be a privilege escalation method in interactive sessions (CLI
or GUI) which allows a user to gain administrator/root privileges from another
user account without re-authentication.. Implementation example: Disable
insecure privilege escalation methods so that users are required to (re-)login
directly into the account with the required permissions.
_Test Case_ :
**Test Name** : TC_OS_PRIVILEGE
**Purpose:**
To ensure that privileged operating system functions shall not be used without
successful authentication and authorization, and that violations of this
requirement are documented and strictly limited in number and functionality.
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Conditions:**
1\. The manufacturer shall provide documentation of the operating system(s)
used in the network product.
2\. The manufacturer shall supply a list \"A\" of operating system functions
which a system user can use to explicitly gain higher privileges, and how
these functions are configured. UnixÂ® example: sudo command and its
configuration file /etc/sudoers.
3\. The manufacturer shall supply a list \"B\" of operating system commands,
GUI functions, and files which will execute specifically limited tasks
automatically with higher privileges, even when used by a low-privileged user.
List \"B\" shall also contain:
\- configuration of these commands and GUI functions;
\- owner and permission settings of files;
\- justification for having the command, GUI function or file on the network
product\ UnixÂ® example: root-owned files with SUID and SGID permissions.
**Execution Steps**
The accredited evaluator\'s test lab is required to execute the following
steps:
1\. The tester logs into the network product and verifies that list \"A\" is
accurate, based on his expert knowledge of the operating system(s) used in the
network product, and operating system documentation.
2\. The tester verifies that entries in the list \"A\" require successful
authentication for all users without exception, on basis of the user name and
at least one authentication attribute.
3\. The tester logs into the network product and verifies that list \"B\" is
accurate, based on his expert knowledge of the operating system(s) used in the
network product, and operating system documentation. UnixÂ® example: To list
files with SUID and SGID permissions, the following commands can be used:
> SUID: find / -perm -4000 -type f -exec ls {} \; > suid_files.txt
>
> SGID: find / -perm -2000 -type f -exec ls {} \; > sgid_files.txt
4\. The tester verifies that file entries in the list \"B\" do not have write
permissions for anyone else than the owner.
5\. The tester verifies that entries in the list \"B\" only allow execution of
specifically limited tasks which are needed on this network product, based on
his expert knowledge of the operating system(s) used in the network product,
and operating system documentation.
6\. The tester logs into the network product and tests for every entry in the
list \"B\" that it does not provide a means to execute arbitrary functions
with administrator/root privileges, e.g. via a shell escape.
**Expected Results:**
1\. The network product does not allow a user to gain administrator/root
privileges from another user account without re-authentication.
2\. If a network product provides functions and files which execute
specifically limited tasks automatically with higher privileges, it ensures
that these limits cannot be bypassed.
3\. The system documentation about means for a user to gain administrator/root
privileges from another user account accurately describes the network product.
**Expected format of evidence:**
A test report provided by the accredited evaluator\'s test lab which will
consist of the following information:
\- Documentation provided by the vendor: lists \"A\" and \"B\"
\- Description of executed tests and commands
\- Relevant output (e.g. screenshot or terminal log)
\- Test result (passed or not passed)

the documentation and the user IDs associated with them. The tester verifies
that:
a. The tester verifies that the session IDs are different between sessions of
the same and different users;
b. The tester verifies that the session IDs seems random based on his/her own
experience. The tester may use tests like the bitstream test or the count-
the-1s-tests from the diehard test suite. The tester documents how randomness
was verified;
c. The tester verifies that the session IDs are always different between
sessions, also when the user ID is the same.
2\. The tester verifies that when session cookies are used
a. neither the \"expire\" or the \"max-age\" is set;
b. the \'HttpOnly\' is set to true;
c. the \'domain\' attribute is set to the correct domain;
d. the \'path\' attribute is set to the correct directory or sub-directory.
3\. The tester verifies that it is impossible to:
a. access a session by retrieving the session ID and communicating the session
ID through a POST or GET variable.
b. generate a session ID on the client by attempting to login with a custom
generated session ID.
c. keep a session alive for longer than the configured maximum lifetime (by
default 8 hours).

even when the tester has logged in with the same user and that are
unpredictable as is confirmed by the entropy calculation.
2\. A confirmation from the tester that the correct variables are indeed set.
3\. A denied access to the tester when attempting the two login steps of step
3 and an expired session in step 3c.
**Expected format of evidence:**
A confirmation that the tester has confirmed that:
1\. Session IDs follow the rules 1-3, 5, 6.
2\. A session times out after 8 hours or sooner according to the
documentation.
3\. The correct cookie settings are used.
4\. The network product does not accept customly generated session IDs and
that session IDs over GET or POST are ignored.

applied and no answer is sent back.
\- Accept: the matching message is accepted.
\- Account: the matching message is accounted for i.e. a counter for the rule
is incremented. This action can be combined with the previous ones. This
feature is useful to monitor traffic before its blocking.
3) To enable/disable for each rule the logging for Dropped packets, i.e.
details on messages matching the rule for troubleshooting.
4) To filter on the basis of the value(s) of any portion of the protocol
header.

##### 4.2.6.2.2 Interface robustness requirements
_Requirement Name_ : Manipulated packets that are sent to an address of the
network device shall not lead to an impairment of availability.
_Requirement Description_ :
A network device shall be not affected in its availability or robustness by
incoming packets, from other network element, that are manipulated or
differing the norm. This means that appropriate packets shall be detected as
invalid and be discarded. The process shall not be affecting the performance
of the network device. This robustness shall be just as effective for a great
mass of invalid packets as for individual or a small number of packets.
Examples of such packets are:
\- Mass-produced TCP packets with a set SYN flag to produce half-open TCP
connections (SYN flooding attack).
\- Packets with the same IP sender address and IP recipient address (Land
attack).
\- Mass-produced ICMP packets with the broadcast address of a network as
target address (Smurf attack).
\- Fragmented IP packets with overlapping offset fields (Teardrop attack).
\- ICMP packets that are larger than the maximum permitted size (65,535 Bytes)
of IPv4 packets (Ping-of-death attack).
\- Uncorrelated reply packets (i.e. packets which cannot be correlated to any
request).
Sometimes the relevant behaviour of the network device will be configured. In
other cases, the behaviour of the network device may only be verified by the
relevant tests.

## 4.3 Security requirements and related test cases related to hardening
### 4.3.1 Introduction
The requirements proposed hereafter (with the relative test cases) aim to
securing a network product by reducing its surface of vulnerability. In
particular the identified requirements aim to ensure that all the default
network product configurations (including operating system software, firmware
and applications) are appropriately set.
### 4.3.2 Technical Baseline
#### 4.3.2.1 No unnecessary or insecure services / protocols
_Requirement Name_ : No unnecessary or insecure services / protocols
_Requirement Description_ :
The network product shall only run protocol handlers and services which are
needed for its operation, and which do not have any known security
vulnerabilities. In particular, by default the following services shall be
initially configured to be disabled on the network product by the vendor
except if services are needed during deployment. In that case those services
shall be disabled according to vendor's instructions after deployment is done.
Disabled protocols may still need to be enabled for other reasons by the
operators, e.g. remote diagnostics.
\- FTP
\- TFTP
\- Telnet
\- rlogin, RCP, RSH
\- HTTP
\- SNMPv1 and v2
\- SSHv1
\- TCP/UDP Small Servers (Echo, Chargen, Discard und Daytime)
\- Finger
\- BOOTP server
\- Discovery protocols (CDP, LLDP)
\- IP Identification Service (Identd)
\- PAD
\- MOP
NOTE 1: As an alternative to disabling the HTTP service, it is also possible
for this service to remain active for reasons of user friendliness. In this
case, however, queries to the web service may not be answered directly on this
port but from a redirected to HTTPS service.
Note 2: Full documentation of required protocols and services of the network
product and their purpose needs to be provided by the vendor as prerequisite
for the test case.

\- their open ports and associated services;
\- and a description of their purposes.
> The tool used shall be capable to detect and identify the protocol handlers
> and running services in the system.
>
> **Execution Steps**
>
> The accredited evaluator\'s test lab is required to execute the following
> steps:
1\. Verification of the compliance to the prerequisites:
> a. Verification that the list of available network services and protocol
> handlers is available in the documentation of the Network Product.
>
> b. Validation that all entries in the list are meaningful and reasonably
> necessary for the operation of the Network Product class.
2\. Identification of the network services and protocol handlers by means of
capable tools or any other suitable testing means.
3\. Validation that there are no entries in the list of network services and
handlers apart from the ones that have been mentioned and deemed necessary for
the operation of the Network Product in the attached documentation.
4\. The tester shall reboot the network product and re-execute execution steps
2 and 3 without further configuration.
**Expected Results:**
The report will contain:
\- The names and version of the tool(s) used.
\- Information of all the protocol handlers and services running in the
network product.
Result will show:
\- There are no unnecessary services running in the network product except for
the ones which are deemed necessary for its operation.
\- Any undocumented services running on the network product should be
highlighted and brought out in the report.
\- The network product behaves the same after reboot as before.

> \- if2-n1 has a static IP address (e.g. 192.168.3.1 belonging to the subnet
> 192.168.3.0/24)
\- A nodes N2 is available with:
> \- Two interface named respectively if1-n2 connected to the network product
> and if2-n2 to which the tester connects a tester machine
>
> \- Routing capabilities. In particular N2 has a default route to if1-np
> subnet via if2-np (e.g. 192.168.2.1)
>
> \- if2-n2 has a static IP address . This ip is the same of if2-n1 (e.g.
> 192.168.3.1 belonging to the subnet 192.168.3.0/24)
\- The network product has at least 2 enabled interface said if1-np and
if2-np:
\- The interface if1-np is connected to interface if1-n1 of the node N1 on the

> \- The interface if2-np is connected to interface if1-n2 of the node N2 on
> the subnet, e.g., 192.168.2.0/24.
>
> \- The network product is configured with a static route for the subnet
> where if2-n1 is connected to (e.g. 192.168.3.0/24), so this subnet can be
> reached via if1-n1 through if1-np.

\- A network traffic analyser (e.g. tcpdump) on the network product is
available
> **Execution Steps**
1\. The tester starts to send pings message to if1-np interface of the network
product.
2\. The tester verifies, through the network traffic analyser, that the ping
reaches correctly the if1-np interface and that responses are sent back.
3\. The tester disconnects the tester machine from if2-n1 interface of the
node N1 and reconnects it to the interface if2-n2 of the node N2:
> \- The testers uses the same network configuration of the tester machine.
>
> \- The tester sends pings message to if1-np interface of the network
> product.
>
> \- The tester verifies, through the network traffic analyser, that the pings
> reach the if1-np interface of the network product, but they are dropped and
> no response is sent back since the source of the received packet is not
> reachable through the interface it came in.
>
> \- The tester sends pings message to if2-np interface of the network
> product.
>
> \- The tester verifies, through the network traffic analyser, that the pings
> reach the if2-np interface of the network product, but they are dropped and
> no response is sent back since there is a default route via if2-np.
>
> \- If the dropped packets are logged, the testers verifies that these
> packets are recorded.
**Expected Results:**
The network product supports an anti-spoofing mechanism (e.g. the RPF
function) and it accepts a packet only if it reaches the network product on
the expected interface (i.e. this packet has a source ip address belonging to
the same network of the interface where it came in or if it is routable
through the interface which it came in), otherwise it discards the packet.
**Expected format of evidence:**
A testing report provided by the testing agency which will consist of the
following information:
\- The user settings and configurations
\- Pcap files
\- Log file if available
\- Test result (Passed or not)

## 4.4 Basic vulnerability testing requirements
4.4.1 Introduction
Basic Vulnerability Testing activities consist of requirements for running
automated Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) and Commercial off-the-shelf
(COTS) security testing tools against the external interfaces of a Network
Product. These activities cover at least four aspects: Port Scanning,
Vulnerability Scanner by the use of Vulnerability scanners and robustness/fuzz
testing, and endpoint scanning. For each of these aspects, test requirements
and test results are described in the present clause.
NOTE: The individual tools used for Basic Vulnerability Testing are selected
by the evaluator. The SECAM accreditation body will ensure during
accreditation of the evaluator\'s laboratory that the testers are able to
utilize adequate tools.
4.4.2 Port Scanning
_Requirement Name_ : Port scaning
_Requirement Description_ :
It shall be ensured that on all network interfaces, only documented ports on
the transport layer respond to requests from outside the system.
The test for this requirement can be carried out using a suitable tool or
manually performed as described below. If a tool is used then the tester needs
to provide evidence, e.g. by referring to the documentation of the tool, that
the tool actually provides functionality equivalent to the steps described
below.
_Security Objective references_ : TBA
_Test Case_ :
**Test Name** : TC_BVT_PORT_SCANNING
**Purpose:**
To ensured that on all network interfaces, only documented ports on the
transport layer respond to requests from outside the system
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Conditions:**
A list of all available network services containing at least the following
information shall be included in the documentation accompanying the Network
Product:
1\. all interfaces providing IP-based protocols;
2\. the available transport layer protocols on these interfaces;
3\. their open ports and associated services per transport layer protocol;
4\. and a free-form description of their purposes.
The port scanning tool that is used shall be capable to detect open ports on
the relevant transport layer protocols.
NOTE: It might not be possible for certain transport layer protocols (like
UDP) to unambiguously detect whether a port is open or not by means of
external port scanning. Also in some circumstances it might not be efficient
to do external port scanning, e.g. if there are security measures to limit the
rate a system can be probed. In those cases the accredited evaluator\'s test
laboratory determines another means suitable to verify which ports are open.
**Execution Steps**
The accredited evaluator\'s test lab is required to execute the following
steps:
1\. Verification of the compliance to the prerequisites:
a. Verification that the list of available network services is available in
the documentation of the Network Product
b. Validation that all entries in the list of services are meaningful and
reasonably necessary for the operation of the Network Product class
2\. Identification of the open ports by means of capable port scanning tools
or other suitable testing means
3\. Verification that the list of identified open ports matches the list of
available network services in the documentation of the Network Product

applicable), used settings, and the relevant output containing all the
technically relevant information about test results is evidence and shall be
part of the testing documentation.
All discrepancies between the list of identified open ports and the list of
available network services in the documentation shall be highlighted in the
testing documentation.
**Expected format of evidence:**

4.4.3 Vulnerability scanning
_Requirement Name:_ Vulnerability scanning
_Requirement Description_ :
The purpose of vulnerability scanning is to ensure that there no known
vulnerabilities (or that relevant vulnerabilities are identified and
remediation plans in place to mitigate them) on the Network Product, both in
the OS and in the applications installed, that can be detected by means of
automatic testing tools via the Internet Protocol enabled network interfaces.
Vulnerability scanning tools may also report false positives and they shall be
investigated and documented in the test report.
The test for this requirement can be carried out using a suitable tool or
manually performed as described below. If a tool is used then the tester needs
to provide evidence, e.g. by referring to the documentation of the tool, that
the tool actually provides functionality equivalent to the steps described
below.
_Security Objective references_ : TBA
_Test case_ :
**Test Name** : TC_BVT_VULNERABILITY_SCANNING
**Purpose:**
The purpose of vulnerability scanning is to ensure that there no known
vulnerabilities (or that relevant vulnerabilities are identified and
remediation plans in place to mitigate them) on the Network Product that can
be detected by means of automatic testing tools via the Internet Protocol
enabled network interfaces.
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Conditions:**
A list of all available network services containing at least the following
information shall be included in the documentation accompanying the Network
Product:
\- all interfaces providing IP-based protocols;
\- the available transport layer protocols on these interfaces;
\- their open ports and associated services;
\- and a free-form description of their purposes.
NOTE 1: This list is to be validated as part of the BVT port scanning
activity.
The used vulnerability scanning tool shall be capable to detect known
vulnerabilities on common services. The used vulnerability information shall
be reasonably recent at the time of testing.
**Execution Steps**
The accredited evaluator\'s test lab is required to execute the following
steps:
1\. Execution of the suitable vulnerability scanning tool against all
interfaces providing IP-based protocols of the Network Product.
2\. Evaluation of the results based on their severity.
**Expected Results:**
The used tool(s) name, their unambiguous version (also for plug-ins if
applicable), used settings, and the relevant output is evidence and shall be
part of the testing documentation.
The discovered vulnerabilities (including source, example CVE ID), together
with a rating of their severity, shall be highlighted in the testing
documentation.
COTS Vulnerability scanners, by their nature, (e.g. depending on how they are
configured) may result in false findings/positives. The tool's documentation
may even mention that the failing test shall be repeated to check whether it
is really a recurring problem or not. The tester shall make best effort to
determine if there is an issue with NE or the test tool and if necessary, work
with the vendor of the network product to come to a consensus on the test
result outcome.
NOTE 2: This testing documentation is input to the vulnerability mitigation
process (that may include patching). This is part of the product lifecycle
management process developed by GSMA SECAG.
**Expected format of evidence:**
Output of BVT tool.
4.4.4 Robustness and fuzz testing
_Requirement Name:_ Robustness and fuzz testing
_Requirement Reference:_ 4.2.6.2.2. -- Interface Robustness requirements
_Requirement Description_ :
It shall be ensured that externally reachable services are reasonably robust
when receiving unexpected input
_Security Objective references_ : TBA.
_Test case_ :
**Test Name** : TC_BVT_ROBUSTNESS AND FUZZ TESTING
**Purpose:**
To verify that the network product provides externally reachable services
which are robust against unexpected input. The target of this test are the
protocol stacks (e.g. diameter stack) rather than the applications (e.g. web
app).
**Procedure and execution steps:**
**Pre-Conditions:**
\- The tester has the privileges to log in the network product and to access
to the all system resources (e.g. log files)
\- A list of all available network services containing at least the following
information shall be included in the documentation accompanying the Network
Product:
\- all interfaces providing IP-based protocols;
\- the available transport layer protocols on these interfaces;
\- their open ports and associated services;
\- and a free-form description of their purposes.
NOTE: This list is to be validated as part of the BVT port scanning activity.
\- The robustness and fuzzing tools that are selected for this test shall
utilize state-of-the-art technology to identify input which causes the Network
Product to behave in an unspecified, undocumented, or unexpected manner.
\- Fuzz testing tools are a highly sophisticated technology and adaptation to
the individual protocols in question is needed to be effective. Therefore,
there is a lack of available effective fuzz testing tools available especially
for protocols proprietary to the Telco industry. Taking into account note 4 of
TR 33.916\'s clause 7.2.4, test labs shall acquire fuzz testing tools for
those protocols where commercially feasible.
\- It needs to be taken into account that fuzz testing tools might show
drastic differences in terms of effectiveness. The accredited test lab is
expected to have sufficient expertise to recognize the level of effectiveness
of the available tools.
\- A network traffic analyser on the network product (e.g. TCPDUMP) or an
external traffic analyser directly connected to the network product and on a
tester machine is available.
**Execution Steps**
The accredited evaluator\'s test lab is required to execute the following
steps:
1\. Execution of available effective fuzzing tools against the protocols
available via interfaces providing IP-based protocols of the Network Product
for an amount of time reasonable long enough to be effective.
2\. Execution of available effective robustness test tools against the
protocols available via interfaces providing IP-based protocols of the Network
Product for an amount of time reasonable long enough to be effective.
3\. For both step 1 and 2:
a. Using a network traffic analyser on the network product (e.g. TCPDUMP) or
an external traffic analyser directly connected to the network product, the
tester verifies that the packets are correctly processed by the network
product.
b. The testers verifies that the network product and any running network
service does not crash.
c. The execution of tests shall run sufficient times.
**Expected Results:**
A list of all of the protocols of the network product reachable externally on
an IP-based interface, together with an indication whether an effective
available robustness and fuzz testing tools have been used against them shall
be part of the testing documentation. If no tool can be acquired for a
protocol, a free form statement should explain why not.
The used tool(s) name, their unambiguous version (also for plug-ins if
applicable), used settings, and the relevant output is evidence and shall be
part of the testing documentation.
Any input causing unspecified, undocumented, or unexpected behaviour, and a
description of this behaviour shall be highlighted in the testing
documentation.
COTS fuzzing tools, by their nature, may have an acceptable failure rate (e.g.
0.1%) due to different non-deterministic variables in their implementation. At
some point the tool's documentation may even mention that the failing test
shall be repeated to check whether it is really a recurring problem or not.
The tester shall make best effort to determine if there is an issue with NE or
the test tool and if necessary, work with the vendor of the network product to
come to a consensus on the test result outcome.
**Expected format of evidence:**
A testing report provided by the testing agency which will consist of the
following information:
\- The used tool(s) name and version information,
\- Settings and configurations used
\- The output log file of the chosen tool that displays the results
(passed/failed).
\- Screenshot
\- Test result (Passed or not)
\- Log/evidence tracing possible crashes
\- Any input causing unspecified, undocumented, or unexpected behaviour
