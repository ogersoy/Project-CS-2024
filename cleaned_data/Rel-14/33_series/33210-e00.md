# Introduction
An identified security weakness in 2G systems is the absence of security in
the core network. This was formerly perceived not to be a problem, since the
2G networks previously were the provinces of a small number of large
institutions. This is no longer the case, and so there is now a need for
security precautions. Another significant development has been the
introduction of IP as the network layer in the GPRS backbone network and then
later in the UMTS network domain. Furthermore, IP is not only used for
signalling traffic, but also for user traffic. The introduction of IP
therefore signifies not only a shift towards packet switching, which is a
major change by its own accounts, but also a shift towards completely open and
easily accessible protocols. The implication is that from a security point of
view, a whole new set of threats and risks must be faced.
For 3G and fixed broadband systems it is a clear goal to be able to protect
the core network signalling protocols, and by implication this means that
security solutions must be found for both SS7 and IP based protocols.
This technical specification is the stage-2 specification for IP related
security in the 3GPP and fixed broadband core networks.
The security services that have been identified as being needed are
confidentiality, integrity, authentication and anti-replay protection. These
will be ensured by standard procedures, based on cryptographic techniques.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the security architecture for network domain IP
based control planes, which shall be applied to NDS/IP-networks (i.e. 3GPP and
fixed broadband networks). The scope of network domain control plane security
is to cover the control signalling on selected interfaces between network
elements of NDS/IP networks.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply.
**Anti-replay protection:** Anti-replay protection is a special case of
integrity protection. Its main service is to protect against replay of self-
contained packets that already have a cryptographical integrity mechanism in
place.
**Confidentiality:** The property that information is not made available or
disclosed to unauthorised individuals, entities or processes.
**Data integrity:** The property that data has not been altered in an
unauthorised manner.
**Data origin authentication:** The corroboration that the source of data
received is as claimed.
**Entity authentication:** The provision of assurance of the claimed identity
of an entity.
**Key freshness:** A key is fresh if it can be guaranteed to be new, as
opposed to an old key being reused through actions of either an adversary or
authorised party.
**NDS/IP Traffic:** Traffic that requires protection according to the
mechanisms defined in this specification.
**NDS/IP-networks:** 3GPP and fixed broadband networks.
**IPsec Security Association:** A unidirectional logical connection created
for security purposes. All traffic traversing a SA is provided the same
security protection. The SA itself is a set of parameters to define security
protection between two entities. A IPsec Security Association includes the
cryptographic algorithms, the keys, the duration of the keys, and other
parameters.
**Security Domain** : Networks that are managed by a single administrative
authority. Within a security domain the same level of security and usage of
security services will be typical.
**Transit Security Domain:** A security domain, which is transmitting NDS/IP
traffic between other security domains.
**Transport mode** : Mode of operation that primarily protects the payload of
the IP packet, in effect giving protection to higher level layers.
**Tunnel mode** : Mode of operation that protects the whole IP packet by
tunnelling it so that the whole packet is protected.

# 4 Overview over network domain security for IP based protocols
## 4.1 Introduction
The scope of this section is to outline the basic principles for the network
domain security architecture. A central concept introduced in this
specification is the notion of a security domain. The security domains are
networks that are managed by a single administrative authority. Within a
security domain the same level of security and usage of security services will
be typical. Typically, a network operated by a single network operator or a
single transit operator will constitute one security domain although an
operator may at will subsection its network into separate sub-networks.
## 4.2 Protection at the network layer
For native IP-based protocols, security shall be provided at the network
layer. The security protocols to be used at the network layer are the IETF
defined IPsec security protocols as specified in RFC-4301 [35] and in RFC-2401
[12].
## 4.3 Security for native IP based protocols
The network domain control plane of an NDS/IP-network is sectioned into
security domains and typically these coincide with operator borders. The
border between the security domains is protected by Security Gateways (SEGs).
The SEGs are responsible for enforcing the security policy of a security
domain towards other SEGs in the destination security domain. The network
operator may have more than one SEG in its network in order to avoid a single
point of failure or for performance reasons. A SEG may be defined for
interaction towards all reachable security domain destinations or it may be
defined for only a subset of the reachable destinations.
The network domain security of an NDS/IP-network does not extend to the user
plane and consequently the security domains and the associated security
gateways towards other domains do not encompass the user plane Gi-interface
towards other, possibly external, IP networks.
A chained-tunnel/hub-and-spoke approach is used which facilitates hop-by-hop
based security protection between security domains.
Within a security domain the use of Transport Mode is allowed.All NDS/IP
traffic shall pass through a SEG before entering or leaving the security
domain.
## 4.4 Security domains
### 4.4.1 Security domains and interfaces
The network domain of an NDS/IP-network shall be logically and physically
divided into security domains. These control plane security domains may
closely correspond to the core network of a single operator and shall be
separated by means of security gateways.
## 4.5 Security Gateways (SEGs)
Security Gateways (SEGs) are entities on the borders of the IP security
domains and will be used for securing native IP based protocols. The SEGs are
defined to handle communication over the Za-interface, which is located
between SEGs from different IP security domains.
All NDS/IP traffic shall pass through a SEG before entering or leaving the
security domain. Each security domain can have one or more SEGs. Each SEG will
be defined to handle NDS/IP traffic in or out of the security domain towards a
well-defined set of reachable IP security domains.
The number of SEGs in a security domain will depend on the need to
differentiate between the externally reachable destinations, the need to
balance the traffic load and to avoid single points of failure. The security
gateways shall be responsible for enforcing security policies for the
interworking between networks. The security may include filtering policies and
firewall functionality not required in this specification.
SEGs are responsible for security sensitive operations and shall be physically
secured. They shall offer capabilities for secure storage of long-term keys
used for IKE authentication.
# 5 Key management and distribution architecture for NDS/IP
## 5.1 Security services afforded to the protocols
IPsec offers a set of security services, which is determined by the negotiated
IPsec security associations. That is, the IPsec SA defines which security
protocol to be used, the mode and the endpoints of the SA.
For NDS/IP-networks the IPsec security protocol shall always be ESP. For
NDS/IP-networks it is further mandated that integrity protection/message
authentication together with anti-replay protection shall always be used.
The security services provided by NDS/IP:
\- data integrity;
\- data origin authentication;
\- anti-replay protection;
\- confidentiality (optional);
\- limited protection against traffic flow analysis when confidentiality is
applied.
## 5.2 Security Associations (SAs)
### 5.2.0 General
For NDS/IP-networks the key management and distribution between SEGs is
handled by the protocol Internet Key Exchange Internet Key Exchange (IKEv2)
(RFC 7296 [43]). The main purpose of IKEv2 is to negotiate, establish and
maintain Security Associations between parties that are to establish secure
connections. The concept of a Security Association is central to IPsec and
IKEv2.
To secure a typical, bi-directional communication between two nodes using
IKEv2 an IKE SA is established through which the Child Security associations
i.e. IPsec security associations are established.
IPsec Security associations are uniquely defined by the following parameters:
\- A Security Parameter Index (SPI);
\- An IP Destination Address (this is the address of the ESP SA endpoint);
\- A security protocol identifier (this will always be the ESP protocol in
NDS/IP).
With regard to the use of IPsec security associations in the network domain
control plane of NDS/IP-networks the following is noted:
\- NDS/IP only requires support for ESP SAs;
The specification of IPsec SAs can be found in RFC4301 [35].
### 5.2.1 Security Policy Database (SPD)
The Security Policy Database (SPD) is a policy instrument to decide which
security services are to be offered and in what fashion.
The SPD shall be consulted during processing of both inbound and outbound
traffic. This also includes traffic that shall not/need not be protected by
IPsec. In order to achieve this the SPD must have unique entries for both
inbound and outbound traffic such that the SPD can discriminate among traffic
that shall be protected by IPsec, that shall bypass IPsec or that shall be
discarded by IPsec.
The SPD plays a central role when defining security policies, both within the
internal security domain and towards external security domains. The security
policy towards external security domains will be subject to roaming
agreements.
### 5.2.2 Security Association Database (SAD)
The Security Association Database (SAD) contains parameters that are
associated with the active security associations. Every SA has an entry in the
SAD. For outbound processing, a lookup in the SPD will point to an entry in
the SAD. If an SPD entry does not point to an SA that is appropriate for the
packet, an SA shall be automatically created.
## 5.3 Profiling of IPsec
### 5.3.0 General
This section gives an overview of the features of IPsec that are used by
NDS/IP. The overview given here defines a minimum set of features that must be
supported. In particular, this minimum set of features is required for
interworking purposes and constitutes a well-defined set of simplifications.
The accumulated effect of the simplifications is quite significant in terms of
reduced complexity. This is achieved without sacrificing security in any way.
It shall be noted explicitly that the simplifications are specified for NDS/IP
and that they may not necessarily be valid for other network constellations
and usages.
Within their own network, operators are free to use IPsec features not
described in this section although there should be no security or functional
reason to do so.
NOTE: Clause 5.3 contains the general 3GPP IPsec ESP profile. Other 3GPP
specifications (e.g. TS 33.203 [10], etc.) may point to clause 5.3. Thus parts
of clause 5.3 may also apply to devices and network nodes as specified in
other specifications. New specifications using ESP should refer to this
profile with as few exceptions as possible.
### 5.3.1 Support of ESP
When NDS/IP is applied, the ESP security protocol shall be used. IPsec ESP
shall be supported according to RFC-4303 [31]. For compatibility with earlier
3GPP releases, it shall be possible to communicate with nodes supporting only
RFC-2406 [17].
NOTE: Annex E describes the main differences between RFC-4303 [31] and
RFC-2406 [17] and the features which require RFC-4303 [31] implementation.
### 5.3.2 Support of tunnel mode
Since security gateways are an integral part of the NDS/IP architecture,
tunnel mode shall be supported. For NDS/IP inter-domain communication,
security gateways shall be used and consequently only tunnel mode (RFC-4301
[35]]) is applicable for this case.
### 5.3.3 Support of ESP encryption transforms
The implementation conformance requirements for ESP encryption transforms
(including authenticated encryption transforms) in RFC 7321 [45] shall be
followed.
Only the ESP encryption algorithms (including authenticated encryption
algorithms) mentioned in RFC 7321 [45] shall be used. Algorithms marked with
\"MUST\" shall be supported. AES-256 should be supported. AES-GCM with a 16
octet ICV shall be supported.
### 5.3.4 Support of ESP authentication transforms
The implementation conformance requirements for ESP authentication transforms
in RFC 7321 [45] shall be followed.
Only the ESP authentication algorithms mentioned in RFC 7321 [45] shall be
used. Algorithms marked with \"MUST\" shall be supported. AES-GMAC with
AES-128 shall be supported.
ESP shall always be used to provide integrity, data origin authentication, and
anti-replay services, thus the NULL authentication algorithm is explicitly not
allowed for use, unless an authenticated encryption algorithm is used.
### 5.3.5 Requirements on the construction of the IV
The following strengthening of the requirements on how to construct the IV
shall take precedence over the description given in RFC‑2451 [24] section 3
and all other descriptions that allow for predictable IVs.
> \- For CBC mode: the IV field shall be the same size as the block size of
> the cipher algorithm being used. The IV shall be chosen at random, and shall
> be unpredictable to any party other than the originator.
\- For CTR, GCM, CCM, and GMAC mode: the IV field shall be 8 octets. The IV
must be generated in a manner that ensures uniqueness. The same IV and key
combination shall not be used more than once. The IV shall be chosen at
random, and shall be unpredictable to any party other than the originator.
\- It is explicitly not allowed to construct the IV from the encrypted data of
the preceding encryption process.
The common practice of constructing the IV from the encrypted data of the
preceding encryption process means that the IV is disclosed before it is used.
A predictable IV exposes IPsec to certain attacks irrespective of the strength
of the underlying cipher algorithm. The second bullet point forbids this
practice in the context of NDS/IP.
These requirements imply that the network elements must have a capability to
generate random data. RFC‑1750 [27] gives guidelines for hardware and software
pseudorandom number generators.
## 5.4 Profiling of IKEv2
### 5.4.0 General
NOTE: Clause 5.4 contains the general 3GPP IKEv2 profile. Other 3GPP
specifications may point to clause 5.4. Thus parts of clause 5.4 may also
apply to devices and network nodes as specified in other specifications. New
specifications using IKE should refer to this profile with as few exceptions
as possible.
### 5.4.1 Void
### 5.4.2 Profiling of IKEv2
The Internet Key Exchange protocol IKEv2 shall be supported for negotiation of
IPsec SAs. The following additional requirements apply.
**General:**
IKEv2 Configuration Payload as defined in RFC 7296 [43] should be supported.
Protocol support for High Availability as defined in RFC 6311 [42] should be
supported.
**For IKE_SA_INIT exchange:**
The following algorithms are listed with their names according to [44].
Following algorithms shall be supported:
\- Confidentiality: ENCR_AES_CBC with 128-bit key length;
\- Confidentiality: AES-GCM with a 16 octet ICV with 128-bit key length;
\- Pseudo-random function: PRF_HMAC_SHA1;
\- Pseudo-random function: PRF_HMAC_SHA2_256;
\- Integrity: AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_96;
\- Integrity: AUTH_HMAC_SHA256_128;
\- Diffie-Hellman group 14 (2048-bit MODP);
\- Diffie-Hellman group 19 (256-bit random ECP group) ;
Following algorithms should be supported:
\- Confidentiality: AES-GCM with a 16 octet ICV with 256-bit key length;
\- Pseudo-random function: PRF_HMAC_SHA2_384;
\- Diffie-Hellman group 20 (384-bit random ECP group).
NOTE 1: The IANA IKEv2 registry [44] contains further references for the
algorithms listed.
> For security reasons, the use of Diffie-Hellman MODP groups less than
> 2048-bit shall not be supported.
**For IKE_AUTH exchange:**
\- Authentication method 2 - Shared Key Message Integrity Code shall be
supported;
\- IP addresses and Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN) shall be supported for
identification;
\- Re-keying of IPsec SAs and IKE SAs shall be supported as specified in RFC
7296 [43].
\- In addition to the requirements defined in RFC 7296 [43], rekeying shall
not lead to a noticeable degradation of service.
**For the CREATE_CHILD_SA exchange:**
\- Perfect Forward Secrecy is optional.
**For reauthentication:**
\- Reauthentication of IKE SAs as specified in RFC 7296 [43] section 2.8.3
shall be supported;
\- A NE shall proactively initiate reauthentication of IKE SAs, and creation
of its Child SAs, i.e. the new SAs shall be established before the old ones
expire;
\- A NE shall destroy an IKE SA and its Child SAs when the authentication
lifetime of the IKE SA expires;
NOTE 2: NE actions related to reauthentication are controlled by locally
configured lifetimes according to RFC 4301 [35]: a soft authentication
lifetime that warns the implementation to initiate reauthentication, and a
hard authentication lifetime when the current IKE SA and its Child SAs are
destroyed.
\- In addition to the requirements defined in RFC 7296 [43], reauthentication
shall not lead to a noticeable degradation of service.
### 5.4.3 Void
## 5.5 Security policy granularity
The policy control granularity afforded by NDS/IP is determined by the degree
of control with respect to the ESP Security Association between the NEs or
SEGs. The normal mode of operation is that only one ESP Security Association
is used between any two NEs or SEGs, and therefore the security policy will be
identical to all secured traffic passing between the NEs.
This is consistent with the overall NDS/IP concept of security domains, which
should have the same security policy in force for all traffic within the
security domain. The actual inter-security domain policy is determined by
roaming agreements when the security domains belong to different operators or
may be unilaterally decided by the operator when the security domains both
belong to him. IPsec security policy enforcement for inter-security domain
communication is a matter for the SEGs of the communicating security domains.
## 5.6 Network domain security key management and distribution architecture
for native IP based protocols
### 5.6.1 Network domain security architecture outline
The NDS/IP key management and distribution architecture is based on the IKEv2
(RFC 7296 [43]) protocol. As described in the previous section a number of
options available in the full IETF IPsec protocol suite have been considered
to be unnecessary for NDS/IP. Furthermore, some features that are optional in
IETF IPsec have been mandated for NDS/IP and lastly a few required features in
IETF IPsec have been deprecated for use within NDS/IP scope. Sections 5.3 and
5.4 give an overview over the profiling of IPsec and IKEv2 in NDS/IP.
The compound effect of the design choices in how IPsec is utilized within the
NDS/IP scope is that the NDS/IP key management and distribution architecture
is quite simple and straightforward.
The basic idea to the NDS/IP architecture is to provide hop-by-hop security.
This is in accordance with the _chained-tunnels_ or _hub-and-spoke_ models of
operation. The use of hop-by-hop security also makes it easy to operate
separate security policies internally and towards other external security
domains.
In NDS/IP only the Security Gateways (SEGs) shall engage in direct
communication with entities in other security domains for NDS/IP traffic. The
SEGs will then establish and maintain IPsec secured ESP Security Association
in tunnel mode between security domains. SEGs will normally maintain at least
one IPsec tunnel available at all times to a particular peer SEG. The SEG will
maintain logically separate SAD and SPD databases for each interface.
The NEs may be able to establish and maintain ESP Security Associations as
needed towards a SEG or other NEs within the same security domain. All NDS/IP
traffic from a NE in one security domain towards a NE in a different security
domain will be routed via a SEG and will be afforded hop-by-hop security
protection towards the final destination.
Operators may decide to establish only one ESP Security Association between
two communicating security domains. This would make for coarse-grained
security granularity. The benefits to this is that it gives a certain amount
of protection against traffic flow analysis while the drawback is that one
will not be able to differentiate the security protection given between the
communicating entities. This does not preclude negotiation of finer grained
security granularity at the discretion of the communicating entities.
Figure 1: NDS architecture for IP-based protocols
Additional guidelines on how to apply IPsec in SCTP are specified in RFC3554
[26]. This RFC is optional for implementation unless otherwise explicitly
indicated per reference point.
NOTE: TS 33.310 [30] defines an inter-operator Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
that can be used to support the establishment of IPsec connections.
### 5.6.2 Interface description
The following interfaces are defined for protection of native IP based
protocols:
**\- Za-interface (SEG-SEG)**
The Za-interface covers all NDS/IP traffic between security domains. On the
Za-interface, authentication/integrity protection is mandatory and encryption
is recommended. ESP shall be used for providing authentication/integrity
protection and encryption. The SEGs use IKEv2 to negotiate, establish and
maintain a secure ESP tunnel between them. The tunnel is subsequently used for
forwarding NDS/IP traffic between security domain A and security domain B.
Inter-SEG tunnels can be available at all times, but they can also be
established as needed.
One SEG of security domain A can be dedicated to only serve a certain subset
of security domains that security domain A needs to communicate with. This
will limit the number of SAs and tunnels that need to be maintained.
All security domains compliant with the present document shall operate the Za-
interface.
NOTE 1: It is possible to use transit security domains between other security
domains. The Za interface is used to protect the interface between the transit
security domain and other security domains. If there are multiple transit
security domains between two security domains then Za-interface is used to
protect interfaces between transit security domains.
NOTE 2: Further details about the usage of encryption in specific cases are
provided in the (normative) Annexes of the present document and in other 3GPP
specifications referencing the present document.
**\- Zb-interface (NE-SEG / NE-NE)**
The Zb-interface is located between SEGs and NEs and between NEs within the
same security domain. The Zb-interface is optional for implementation. If
implemented, it shall implement ESP in tunnel mode and IKE as described in
clause 5.4. The support of ESP in Transport mode is optional.
On the Zb-interface, ESP shall always be used with authentication/integrity
protection. The use of encryption is optional. The ESP Security Association
shall be used for all control plane traffic that needs security protection.
Whether the Security Association is established when needed or a priori is for
the security domain operator to decide. The Security Association is
subsequently used for exchange of NDS/IP traffic between the nodes.
NOTE 3: The security policy established over the Za-interface may be subject
to roaming agreements. This differs from the security policy enforced over the
Zb-interface, which is unilaterally decided by the security domain operator.
NOTE 4: There is normally no NE-NE interface for NEs belonging to separate
security domains. This is because it is important to have a clear separation
between the security domains. This is particularly relevant when different
security policies are employed whithin the security domain and towards
external destinations.
The restriction not to allow secure inter-domain NE-NE communication does not
preclude a single physical entity to contain both NE and SEG functionality. It
is observed that SEGs are responsible for enforcing security policies towards
external destinations and that a combined NE/SEG would have the same
responsibility towards external destinations. The exact SEG functionality
required to allow for secure inter-domain NENE communication will be subject
to the actual security policies being employed. Thus, it will be possible to
have secure direct inter-domain NENE communication within the framework of
NDS/IP if both NEs have implemented SEG functionality. If a NE and SEG is
combined in one physical entity, the SEG functionality of the combined unit
should not be used by other NEs towards external security domains.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Other issues
# A.1 Network Address Translators (NATs) and Transition Gateways (TrGWs)
Network Address Translators (NATs) are not designed to be part of the network
domain control plane of NDS/IP-networks. Since network domain security employs
a chained-tunnel approach it may be possible to use NATs provided that the
network is carefully configured.
NDS/IP provides no explicit support for Transition Gateways (TrGWs) to be used
in the network domain control plane of NDS/IP-networks, but the NDS/IP
architecture will not itself prohibit the use of TrGWs. However, the inclusion
of TrGWs must be carefully executed in order not to create interoperability
problems.
# A.2 Filtering routers and firewalls
In order to strengthen the security for IP based networks, border gateways and
access routers would normally use packet filtering strategies to prevent
certain types of traffic to pass in or out of the network. Similarly,
firewalls are used as an additional measure to prevent certain types of
accesses towards the network.
The rationale behind the application of packet filters and firewalls should be
found in the security policy of the network operator. Preferably, the security
policy should be an integral part of the network management strategy as a
whole.
While network operators are strongly encouraged to use filtering routers and
firewalls, the usage, implementation and security policies associated with
these are considered outside the scope of this specification.
Simple filtering may be needed before the Security Gateway (SEG)
functionality. The filtering policy must allow key protocols to allow DNS and
NTP etc to pass. This will include traffic over the Za interface from
IKEv1/IKEv2 and IPsec ESP in tunnel mode. Unsolicited traffic shall be
rejected.
# A.3 The relationship between BGs and SEGs
It is observed that GPRS Border Gateways (BG) and NDS/IP Security Gateways
(SEGs) will both reside at the border of an operator network.
###### ## Annex B (normative): Security protection for GTP
# B.0 General
This section details how NDS/IP shall be used when GTP is to be security
protected.
# B.1 The need for security protection
The GPRS Tunnelling Protocol (GTP) is defined in 3GPP TS 29.060 [6]. The GTP
protocol includes both the GTP control plane signalling (GTP-C) and user plane
data transfer (GTP-U) procedures. GTP is defined for Gn interface, i.e. the
interface between GSNs within a PLMN, and for the Gp interface between GSNs in
different PLMNs.
GTP-C is used for traffic that that is sensitive in various ways including
traffic that is:
\- critical with respect to both the internal integrity and consistency of the
network;
\- essential in order to provide the user with the required services;
\- crucial in order to protect the user data in the access network and that
might compromise the security of the user data should it be revealed.
Amongst the data that clearly can be considered sensitive are the mobility
management messages, the authentication data and MM context data. Therefore,
it is necessary to apply security protection to GTP signalling messages
(GTP-C).
Network domain security is not intended to cover protection of user plane data
and hence GTP-U is not protected by NDS/IP mechanisms.
Table 1 presents a list of GTP interfaces that shall be considered by NDS/IP.

# B.2 Policy discrimination of GTP-C and GTP-U
It must be possible to discriminate between GTP-C messages, which shall
receive protection, and other messages, including GTP-U, that shall not be
protected. Since GTP-C is assigned a unique UDP port-number in (TS29.060 [6])
IPsec can easily distinguish GTP-C datagrams from other datagrams that may not
need IPsec protection.
Security policies shall be checked for all traffic (both incoming and
outgoing) so datagrams can be processed in the following ways:
\- discard the datagram;
\- bypass the datagram (do not apply IPsec);
\- apply IPsec.
Under this regime GTP-U will simply bypass IPsec while GTP-C will be further
processed by IPsec in order to provide the required level of protection. The
SPD has a pointer to an entry in the Security Association Database (SAD) which
details the actual protection to be applied to the datagram.
NOTE 1: Selective protection of GTP-C relies on the ability to uniquely
distinguish GTP-C datagrams from GTP-U datagrams. For R99 and onwards this is
achieved by having unique port number assignments to GTP-C and GTP-U. For
previous version of GTP this is not the case and provision of selective
protection for the control plane parts of pre-R99 versions of GTP is not
possible. Although NDS/IP was not designed for protection of pre-R99 versions
of GTP, it is recognized that NDS/IP may also be used for protection of GTP
pre-R99. It should be noted that NDS/IP support for pre-R99 versions of GTP is
not mandatory.
NOTE 2: NDS/IP has been designed to protect control plane protocols. However,
it is recognized that NDS/IP may also be used to protect GTP-U. It should be
noted that NDS/IP support for GTP-U is outside the scope of this
specification.
# B.3 Protection of GTP-C transport protocols and interfaces
IPSec ESP shall be used with both encryption and integrity protection for all
GTP-C messages traversing inter-security domain boundaries.
Gn and Gp control plane traffic shall be routed via a SEG when it takes place
between different security domains. In order to do so, operators shall operate
NDS/IP Za-interface between SEGs. If a network node has implemented SEG
functionality within the same physical entity, transport mode IPsec is
optional for implementation and use on the Gn and Gp interfaces.
It will be for the operator to decide whether and where to deploy Zb-
interfaces in order to protect the GTP-C messages over the Gn and Gp
interfaces within the same security domain.
###### ## Annex C (normative): Security protection of IMS protocols
# C.0 General
This section details how NDS/IP shall be used to protect IMS protocols and
interfaces. The network domain security for IMS in 3GPP2 networks shall be as
specified in in Annex S.5 of TS 33.203[10].
# C.1 The need for security protection
The security architecture of the IP multimedia Core Network Subsystem (IMS) is
specified in 3GPP TS 33.203 [10]. 3GPP TS 33.203 [10] defines that the
confidentiality and integrity protection for SIP-signalling are provided in a
hop-by-hop fashion.
The first hop i.e. between the UE and the P‑CSCF through the IMS access
network (i.e. Gm reference point) is protected by security mechanisms
specified in 3GPP TS 33.203 [10].
The other hops, within the IMS core network including interfaces within the
same security domain or between different security domains are protected by
NDS/IP security mechanisms as specified by this Technical Specification.
3GPP **TS 23.002 [3] specifies the different reference points defined for
IMS.**
# C.2 Protection of IMS protocols and interfaces
IMS control plane traffic within the IMS core network shall be routed via a
SEG when it takes place between different security domains (in particular over
those interfaces that may exist between different IMS operator domains). In
order to do so, IMS operators shall operate NDS/IP Za-interface between SEGs
as described in clause 5.6.2.
When SEGs are deployed to secure a Za reference point potentially carrying IMS
session keys (i.e. in IMS roaming scenarios, when SEGs are deployed between a
P-CSCF and I-CSCF located in different security domains), IPSec ESP shall be
used with both encryption and integrity protection for all SIP signalling
traversing inter-security domain boundaries.
It will be for the IMS operator to decide whether and where to deploy Zb-
interfaces in order to protect the IMS control plane traffic over those IMS
interfaces within the same security domain.
###### ## Annex D (normative): Security protection of UTRAN/GERAN IP transport
protocols
# D.0 General
This annex details how NDS/IP shall be used to protect UTRAN/GERAN IP
transport protocols and interfaces.
# D.1 The need for security protection
The control plane in question is used to transfer signalling messages in
UTRAN/GERAN IP transport network. The UTRAN IP transport option is specified
in Rel-5 UTRAN Technical Specifications. UTRAN Iu interface signalling
transport is specified in 3GPP TS 25.412 [28] and Iur interface signalling
transport in TS 25.422 [38]. The architecture for the UTRAN Iuh/Iurh
interfaces is specified in 3GPP TS 25.467 [39], stage 3 specification is
contained in 3GPP TS 25.468 [40] and TS 25.471 [41]. Based on the known
security threats in IP networking, the traffic shall be protected properly.
This is in order not to restrict the application of IP in UTRAN and GERAN only
to closed network environments.
The security solution for IP based UTRAN/GERAN transport shall follow the
principles introduced in the NDS/IP since the IPSec provides application
independent security solution for all IP traffic.
Iu/Iuh and Iur/Iurh interfaces are carrying information that is classified as
sensitive. Iu/Iuh and Iur/Iurh are used for conveying e.g. subscriber specific
security keys. These keys are vital for the end-user security. Hence Iu/Iuh
and Iur/Iurh shall be encrypted along with the integrity check.
# D.2 Protection of UTRAN/GERAN IP transport protocols and interfaces
IPSec ESP shall be used with both encryption and integrity protection for all
RANAP and RNSAP messages traversing inter-security domain boundaries.
Iu/Iuh and Iur/Iurh control plane traffic shall be routed via a SEG when it
takes place between different security domains (in particular over those
interfaces that may exist between different operator domains). In order to do
so, operators shall operate NDS/IP Za-interface between SEGs. If a UTRAN node
has implemented SEG functionality within the same physical entity, transport
mode IPsec is optional for implementation and use on the Iur/Iurh interface.
It will be for the operator to decide whether and where to deploy Zb-
interfaces in order to protect the RANAP and RNSAP messages over the Iu/Iuh
and Iur/Iurh interfaces within the same security domain.
###### ## Annex E (informative): RFC-4303 compared with RFC-2406
If none of the new features available in RFC-4303[31] are employed, then the
format of an ESP packet is identical to the format of those packets which are
generated following RFC-2406[17]. RFC-4303[31] provides a detailed
description.
The new features of RFC-4303 [31] that affect the format are:
1) Use of combined mode encryption algorithm
However, a peer who implements only RFC-2406 [17] would never negotiate such
an algorithm, as they are defined for use only in RFC-4303 [31].
2) ESN (Extended Sequence Numbering)
This feature requires an extension to IKEv1 in order to be able to negotiate
it and can be negotiated through IKEv2. This feature is useful for very high
bandwidth environments.
3) Better support of traffic flow confidentiality (TFC) in RFC-4303 [31].
NOTE 1: RFC-4303 [31] section 8 describes how an RFC-2406 [17] receiver needs
to behave when receiving an ESP packet with the Next Header field set to a
value of \"59\".
NOTE 2: The implementation of RFC-4303 [31] is functionally required if IPsec
multicast needs to be supported on an interface.
