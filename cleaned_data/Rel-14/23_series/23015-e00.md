# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3GPP.
This TS describes the network feature Operator Determined Barring which allows
a network operator or service provider to regulate access by subscribers to
services within the 3GPP system.
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of this TS, it will be re-released by the TSG with an identifying
change of release date and an increase in version number as follows:
Version 3.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 Indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the specification;
# 1 Scope
The network feature Operator Determined Barring (ODB) allows a network
operator or service provider to regulate access by subscribers to services
(Circuit/Packet Oriented and Interworking WLAN), by the barring of certain
categories of incoming or outgoing calls/ Packet Oriented Services or of
roaming. Operator Determined Barring applies to all bearer services and
teleservices except the Emergency Call teleservice and Emergency Bearer
Services; the teleservice Short Message Point-to-Point is therefore subject to
Operator Determined Barring in the same way as circuit-switched calls.
The application of specific categories of Operator Determined Barring to a
subscription is controlled by the network operator or service provider, using
administrative interaction at the HLR; this interface is not standardised.
## 1.1 Normative references
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 2 Method of realisation
The entities which control the application of Operator Determined Barring
(ODB), and the methods used, are described in this clause. Two cases are
considered for each type of barring: the effect of administrative action in
the HLR to modify the application of the category to a particular
subscription, and the effect of the category on the handling of calls or other
traffic involving the subscriber.
## 2.1 Barring of Outgoing Calls or Mobile Originated Short Messages
Barring of outgoing calls or mobile originated short messages includes the
categories \"outgoing calls\" and \"outgoing premium rate calls\" defined in
3GPP TS 22.041 [2], and the \"operator specific barring\" category where this
is defined by the PLMN operator to apply to outgoing calls or mobile
originated short messages.
### 2.1.1 Application or Change of Barring in the HLR
If barring of outgoing calls or mobile originated short messages is applied to
a subscription (or existing barring of outgoing calls or mobile originated
short messages is modified or removed) by administrative action in the HLR,
the HLR will update the subscription information accordingly, and transfer the
updated subscription information to the VLR and the SGSN using one or more
Insert Subscriber Data operations, as shown in figure 2.1.1/1.
If operator specific barring is applied to a subscription (or existing
operator specific barring is modified or removed) by administrative action in
the HLR, the HLR will update the subscription information accordingly. If the
mobile subscriber is registered in the home PLMN, the HLR will transfer the
updated subscription information to the VLR and the SGSN using one or more
Insert Subscriber Data operations, as shown in figure2.1.1/ 1.
If the VPLMN does not support Operator Determined Barring of outgoing calls,
the VLR and the SGSN shall indicate this in the acknowledgement of the Insert
Subscriber Data message. The HLR shall then, as an operator option, apply the
Outgoing Calls Barred supplementary service, apply barring of roaming as
described in subclause 2.3 or take any other action decided by the operator of
the HPLMN.

## 2.3 Barring of Roaming
### 2.3.1 Application or Change of Barring in the HLR/HSS
If barring of roaming is applied to a subscription (or modified or removed) by
administrative action in the HLR/HSS, the HLR/HSS shall update the
subscription information accordingly. If the HLR/HSS determines from the
identity of the VLR and/or the SGSN and/or MME that the mobile subscriber is
currently registered in a barred PLMN, the HLR/HSS shall put the barring into
effect by using a Cancel Location operation to the VLR and/or the SGSN and /or
to the MME, as shown in figure 2.3.1/1. If the mobile subscriber is not
currently registered in a barred PLMN, the HLR/HSS shall take no further
action.

## 2.6A Barring of existing PDP contexts
Barring of existing PDP contexts shall be performed based on the Operator
Determined Barring for Packet Oriented Services defined in 3G TS 22.041 [2].
### 2.6A.1 Application or Change of Barring in the HLR
If barring of Packet Oriented Services is applied to a subscription (or
existing barring of Packet Oriented Services is modified or removed) by
administrative action in the HLR, the HLR will update the subscription
information accordingly, and transfer the updated subscription information to
the SGSN using one or more Insert Subscriber Data operations, as shown in
figure 2.6A.1/1.
If the VPLMN does not support Operator Determined Barring of Packet Oriented
Services, the SGSN shall indicate this in the acknowledgement of the Insert
Subscriber Data message. The HLR shall then, as an operator option, apply
barring of roaming as described in subclause 2.3 or take any other action
decided by the operator of the HPLMN.
