# 1 Scope
This document specifies the common functional architecture, procedures and
information flows needed to support mission critical services including the
common services core architecture.
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2], 3GPP
TS 22.280 [3], 3GPP TS 22.281 [4] and 3GPP TS 22.282 [5].
The present document is applicable primarily to mission critical services
using E-UTRAN access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401
[17]. Certain MC service functions such as dispatch and administrative
functions could also be supported via non-3GPP access networks but no
additional functionality is specified to support non-3GPP access.
The common functional architecture to support mission critical services can be
used for public safety applications and also for general commercial
applications e.g. utility companies and railways.

# 4 Introduction
A common functional architecture to support MC services (i.e., MCPTT defined
in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], MCVideo defined in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12], MCData defined
in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]) including common application plane and signalling
plane entities is specified in this document.
Each MC service supports several types of communications amongst the users
(e.g. group call, private call). There are several common functions and
entities (e.g. group, configuration, identity) which are used by the MC
services.
The common functional architecture to support MC services utilises aspects of
the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9], the Proximity-based
Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14], the Group
Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.468 [18] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS
23.237 [10].
The MC service UE primarily obtains access to a MC service via E-UTRAN, using
the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [17]. Certain MC service
functions such as dispatch and administrative functions can be supported using
either MC service UEs in E-UTRAN or using MC service UEs via non-3GPP access
networks. External applications usage of MC services can be enabled via
E-UTRAN or non-3GPP access networks.
NOTE: Dispatch consoles and devices used by MC service administrators are
considered MC service UEs in the common functional architecture to support MC
services.
# 5 Assumptions and architectural requirements
## 5.1 Assumptions
### 5.1.1 Service continuity
Service continuity shall be supported between on-network MC services and UE-
to-network relay MC services. The following 3GPP TS 23.237 [9] procedures are
needed:
  * Originating sessions that use only PS media flow(s) as defined in subclause 6.2.1.3.
  * Terminations sessions that use only PS media flow(s) as defined in subclause 6.2.2.3.
  * Remote Leg Update as defined in subclause 6.3.1.5.
  * PS-PS Access Transfer with full media transfer as defined in subclause 6.2.2.1.
The MC service UE, prior to going out of E-UTRAN coverage, should attempt to
make use of a ProSe UE-to-network relay to support service continuity.
### 5.1.2 Trust domain
For an MC system, the trust domain consists of one or more MC service
functions that are administered by the same or different service providers
(e.g. MC service provider, PLMN operator) that have an agreement to share
sensitive information.
For the MC system architecture, the following rules are implied for functions
in different trust domains:
\- A public user identity shall not identify an MC service user in a different
trust domain (see subclause 8.3.1);
\- A public service identity shall not identify an MC service group ID in a
different trust domain (see subclause 8.3.2);
\- A SIP database shall not pass responses to a registrar or registrar finder
in a different trust domain (see subclause 7.4.3.2.1); and
\- An HTTP proxy shall not pass requests or responses to another HTTP proxy,
an HTTP server or an HTTP client in a different trust domain (see subclause
7.4.3.3.2).
## 5.2 Architectural requirements
### 5.2.1 General architectural requirements
General MC service architectural requirements include:
a) To develop economies of scale, it will be useful if PLMN operators can
reuse the MC service architecture for non-public safety customers that require
similar functionality. These PLMN operators may want to integrate many
components of the MC service solution with their existing network
architecture.
Hence a functional decomposition of MC service architecture into distinct
logical functions is required.
b) The MC service architecture should enable an application plane and
signalling control plane split for the provisioning of the MC service.
c) To enable parts of the MC service architecture to be shared for other
applications, the architecture should enable the group management functions
(e.g. admission control; linking of groups;) to be implemented on a separate
node from the main application functions of the MC service (e.g. \"call\"
setup/termination; allocation of TMGI to UE; floor control;).
d) There is a need to promptly form (and release) groups of users that span
multiple public safety network administrations. To enable this, the MC service
architecture should provide the relevant interfaces between public safety
networks.
### 5.2.2 Roaming requirements
The MC applications can provide MC services to users in various PLMNs. Roaming
is supported using EPC-level roaming or IMS-level roaming.
### 5.2.3 UE-to-network relay MC service requirements
To support the requirement that a public safety ProSe UE-to-network relay
shall be able to restrict the relayed group communication on a per group
basis, the MC service should be able to provide a means for an MC service
administrator to configure a ProSe UE-to-network relay with a list of allowed
MC service groups. For each allowed MC service group, a unique associated
relay service code should be allocated and it may be provided to the relay UE
from MC service server or DPF.
NOTE: According to the PLMN operator\'s configuration, one relay service code
can map to one or multiple MC service group(s).
### 5.2.4 MC service user profile requirements
The MC service user profile shall:
\- be provisioned subject to the user authentication by the identity
management server;
\- be available at configuration management server;
\- be available at MC service servers with the corresponding user profile
information;
\- be associated with an MC service user; and
\- contain an index to uniquely distinguish the MC service user profile from
other MC service user profiles associated to the same MC service user.
For the set of MC service user profiles associated to a single MC service
user, one of the MC service user profiles shall be indicated as the pre-
selected MC service user profile to the MC service client and the MC service
server.
The MC service user shall be able to:
\- change the pre-selected MC service user profile; and
\- change the selected MC service user profile.
The MC service user profile may be modified at the configuration management
server.
### 5.2.5 MC service group affiliation and MC service group de-affiliation
The MC system shall support affiliation and de-affiliation to an MC service
group for one or more MC services. For affiliation and de-affiliation, the MC
service client shall indicate interest in one or more MC services for the MC
service group. For a single MC service group configured for multiple MC
services, the affiliation and de-affiliation shall be performed as per the MC
service selected by the MC service user. For individual MC service group
affiliation and MCservice group de-affiliation, the requirements are specified
in the corresponding MC service TS.
Editor\'s note: The requirement for a combined affiliation to multiple MC
services for a single MC service group is FFS.
MC service group affiliation can be achieved through the following two
methods:
a) Explicit affiliation: An MC service client indicates interest in one or
many MC service groups to the MC service server. This interest may be
initiated either by an MC service user using the MC service UE, or by an
automatic procedure within the MC service client that indicates that the MC
service user is interested in the MC service group at that MC service client.
An authorized MC service user may remotely modify another MC service user\'s
affiliation to an MC service group.
b) Implicit affiliation: An MC service user\'s affiliations to MC service
groups are determined through configurations and policies within the MC
service and performed by the associated MC service server.
NOTE: MC service group affiliation is not the same as MC service group
membership; however, an MC service user is a member of an MC service group
prior to becoming an affiliated member of that MC service group.
The MC service server may refuse a request for affiliation from an MC service
user to an MC service group, in which case the MC service user will be unable
to take part in the requested MC service associated with that MC service
group, and the MC service client should make the MC service user aware that
the MC service user is not affiliated to the MC service group for the
requested MC service. The MC service server may also de-affiliate an MC
service client from an MC service group following a relevant trigger
condition.
MC service group de-affiliation indicates that the MC service user is no
longer interested in that MC service group, either at the MC service client,
or across all MC service clients depending on MC service group configuration,
and therefore is unable to perform any actions that are associated with an
affiliated member (e.g. receive media, notifications). MC service group
deâ€‘affiliation can occur due to either an MC service client\'s explicit
request, or implicitly i.e. changed by the MC service server as the result of
another action e.g. the MC service user logging off.
### 5.2.6 GCS AS requirements for the MC services
Point to multipoint broadcast offered by the LTE MBMS technology is well
suited to group communications, which form a major part of the public safety
related communications. The MC service on-network architecture, is based in
part on 3GPP TS 23.468 [18] with the MC service server assuming the function
of the GCS AS and can be represented (in a simplified diagram) as shown in
figure 5.2.6-1:
Figure 5.2.6-1: MC service on-network architecture showing MBMS
The MC service server is shown being bundled with the GCS AS within the same
network entity. It is illustrated this way for simplicity of the diagram.
MC service media content is transmitted via LTE bearers, which are
communication pipes with one end in the MC service server and the other end in
the MC service UE. The uplink bearers are always allocated as unicast, but the
downlink bearers can be allocated as unicast or as MBMS bearers, or both.
An MBMS bearer (both network and radio part) is uniquely identified via a TMGI
or via a combination of a TMGI and a flow identifier (see 3GPP TS 23.246
[11]). The MC service server is capable, via the MB2 interface, to request the
creation of MBMS bearers and associate a unique TMGI or a combination of a
TMGI and a flow identifier (see 3GPP TS 23.468 [18]). The MC service server
may determine the MBMS broadcast area based on the cell identities of the
affiliated group members received over GC1. The MC service server may
determine for a user the switching from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer based on
the information reported over GC1.
### 5.2.7 Bearer management
#### 5.2.7.0 General
The MC service UE shall use the following APNs:
\- an MC services APN for the SIP-1 reference point;
\- an MC common core services APN for the HTTP-1 reference point; and
\- an MC identity management service APN for the CSC-1 reference point.
The value of each of these APNs:
\- may be the same or may differ;
\- may be the same as other non-MC services that have compatible QoS and PDN
(see NOTE); and
\- shall be made available to the UE either via UE (pre)configuration or via
initial UE configuration (see subclause 10.1.1) on a per HPLMN and optionally
also a per VPLMN basis.
NOTE: The APN value of \"IMS\" is a well-known APN, whose PDN connection
characteristics are defined in GSMA PRD IR.92 [23] and GSMA PRD IR.88 [24],
and which is used in some deployments for operator IMSâ€‘based services e.g.
Voice over LTE. This well-known APN can be used for the MC service APN if the
SIP core belongs to the PLMN operator and both the PLMN operator and MC
service provider have agreed which QoS aspects to utilise i.e. either the QoS
aspects defined in subclause 5.2.7.2 or the QoS aspects defined in GSMA PRD
IR.92 [23] and GSMA PRD IR.88 [24].
The MC service UE may utilise PDN access credentials as specified in 3GPP TS
23.401 [17] (e.g. PAP, CHAP) to access the PDNs identified by the MC service
APN, the MC common core services APN and the MC identity management service
APN. If PDN access credentials are required, then they shall be made available
to the MC service UE via initial MC service UE configuration (see subclause
10.1.1) on a per APN basis.
The PDN connection to the APNs defined within the present subclause can be of
type \"IPv4\", \"IPv6\" or \"IPv4v6\" (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [17]). If a PDN
connection to an APN defined within the present subclause is of type
\"IPv4v6\" then the MC service client shall use configuration data to
determine whether to use IPv4 or IPv6.
#### 5.2.7.1 MBMS bearer management
When operating in systems that support MBMS functionality, the MC service can
provide downlink MBMS delivery of MC service media.
When operating in systems that support MBMS functionality, the MC service can
provide downlink MBMS delivery of application level control messages targeted
towards multiple MC clients at the same time (e.g. floor idle and floor taken
for MCPTT services).
MC service UEs can receive the traffic delivered via MBMS, regardless of
whether or not they have any unicast radio bearers available.
When switching between different downlink bearers, the MC service UE shall
preserve the reception context in order to eliminate or reduce to a minimum
any interruption of service.
The MC service shall enable an MC service UE in an ongoing MC service group
session that has just entered an area of media delivery via MBMS bearers to
immediately start receiving the media for that MC service group session via
MBMS.
The MC service server shall not map MC service group sessions to MBMS bearers
that cannot provide the QoS required by the group.
An MC service UE that uses MBSFN transmission should be able to support eight
MBSFN areas simultaneously on the same RF carrier.
#### 5.2.7.2 EPS bearer considerations
5.2.7.2.1 Considerations for the EPS bearer to the MC services PDN
If the PDN connection established during the initial attach by the MC service
UE is to an APN other than the MC services APN, then prior to user
authentication, the MC service UE shall establish another PDN connection to
the MC services APN. PDN connection establishment can also be caused by a SIP
registration request for one or more MC services.
The QCI value of 69 (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [8]) shall be used for the
EPS bearer that transports SIP-1 reference point messaging.
5.2.7.2.2 Considerations for the EPS bearer to the MC common core services PDN
and MC identity management service PDN
The QCI value 8 (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [8]) or better shall be used
for the EPS bearer that transports HTTP-1 reference point messaging.
### 5.2.8 External applications access to services in a MC system
The MC system shall allow external applications to gain secure access to MC
services by supporting authentication and authorization of external
applications.
Editor\'s note: External applications reside outside a MC system and can
access a MC system using IP connectivity.
Editor\'s note: How to enable the external application access to services in
an MC system is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The definition for services and capabilities discovery is FFS.
# 6 Involved business relationships
Based on the information in subclause 5.2.1 and subclause 5.2.2, figure 6-1
shows the business relationships that exist and that are needed to support a
single MC service user.
Figure 6-1: Business relationships for MC services
The MC service user belongs to a single mission critical organization based on
a MC service user agreement between the MC service user and the mission
critical organization. The MC service user can have MC service user agreement
and MC service arrangement directly with a single MC service provider.
The mission critical organization and the MC service provider can be part of
the same organization, in which case the business relationship between the two
is internal to a single organization. The mission critical organization can
have MC service arrangements with several MC service providers. In this case,
a MC service user of a mission critical organization is always served by only
one MC service provider. The MC service provider can have MC service
arrangements with several mission critical organizations. The MC service
provider can have MC service user agreements and MC service arrangements with
several MC service users.
The MC service provider and the home PLMN operator can be part of the same
organization, in which case the business relationship between the two is
internal to a single organization.
The home PLMN operator can have PLMN operator service arrangements with
multiple MC service providers and the MC service provider can have PLMN
operator service arrangements with multiple home PLMN operators. As part of
the PLMN operator service arrangement between the MC service provider and the
home PLMN operator, PLMN subscription arrangements can be provided which
allows the MC service UEs to register with home PLMN operator network.
The home PLMN operator can have PLMN roaming agreements with multiple visited
PLMN operators and the visited PLMN operator can have PLMN roaming agreements
with multiple home PLMN operators.
Where mutual aid operates between MC service providers, figure 6-2 shows the
required additional relationship. An MC service user can only affiliate to
groups of the partner MC service provider:
\- if such a service provider agreement exists; or
\- subject to authorisation for a specific group membership from the partner
MC service provider.
Figure 6-2: Additional business relationships for mutual aid
The primary and partner MC service providers do not need to be served by the
same home SIP core operator in order to support mutual communication and
mutual aid when interconnection between the SIP cores is available.
An example of the usage of these business relationships is elaborated for two
users, one resident on its primary MC service provider and one providing
mutual aid within the same group:
User A is a user on MC service provider X in group M. The relationships are as
follows:
a) user A has user configuration established with MC service provider X and
forms part of group M;
b) user A uses a PLMN subscription arrangement with PLMN operator R provided
by MC service provider X; and
c) MC service provider X has a PLMN operator service arrangement with PLMN
operator R.
User B is a user on MC service provider Y and joins group M as part of a
mutual aid:
a) user B has user configuration established with MC service provider Y and
forms part of its own set of groups relating to MC service provider Y;
b) user B uses a PLMN subscription arrangement with PLMN operator S provided
by MC service provider Y;
c) MC service provider Y has a PLMN operator service arrangement with PLMN
operator S;
d) MC service provider Y has a service provider agreement with MC service
provider X that allows user B to participate within group M; and
e) PLMN operator S has a PLMN roaming agreement with PLMN operator R allowing
user B to roam to PLMN operator R.
NOTE: There is no requirement that the PLMN operator that user B roams to is
the same PLMN operator that MC service provider X has a service arrangement
with. It does however need to support one or more MC services capabilities,
and provides service in the same geographic area as used by MC service
provider X.
# 7 Functional model
## 7.1 General
The functional model for the MC services architecture is defined as a series
of planes to allow for the breakdown of the architectural description.
Further, each plane is expected to operate in an independent manner, providing
services to the connected planes as and when requested by the connected plane,
and requesting services from other planes as required.
As a consequence of this each plane should manage on its own behalf:
a) use of identities. Each plane is therefore responsible for the privacy of
that plane\'s own identities; and
b) security for that plane. This does not preclude a plane requesting security
services from another plane, but that is a decision made within the plane, as
to whether to use offered security services or mechanisms within the plane
itself.
NOTE: Terminology such as client and server are not meant to imply specific
physical implementation of a functional entity.
## 7.2 Description of the planes
The following planes are identified:
a) application plane: The application plane provides all of the services (e.g.
call control, floor control, video control, data control) required by the user
together with the necessary functions to support MC service. It uses the
services of the signalling control plane to support those requirements. For
example, within the MCPTT service, the application plane also provides for the
conferencing of media, and provision of tones and announcements; and
b) signalling control plane: The signalling control plane provides the
necessary signalling support to establish the association of users involved in
an MC service, such as an MCPTT call or other type of MC services. The
signalling control plane also offers access to and control of services across
MC services. The signalling control plane uses the services of the bearer
plane.
Bearers supporting these planes are defined for LTE within 3GPP TS 23.401
[17]. The resource control that is needed to support these planes is defined
within 3GPP TS 23.203 [8]. The application plane also relies on the use of
multicast bearers established via procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23. 468 [18]
and 3GPP TS 23.246 [11].
## 7.3 Functional model description
### 7.3.1 On-network functional model
Each MC service can be represented by an application plane functional model.
The functional model across MC services may be similar but is described by the
individual functional entities and reference points that belong to that MC
service. Within the application plane for an MC service there is a common set
of functions and reference points. The common set is shared across services.
This common set of functions and reference points is known as the common
services core.
Figure 7.3.1-1 shows the functional model for the application plane for an MC
system.
Figure 7.3.1-1: Functional model for application plane for an MC system
The common services core functions and reference points shown in figure
7.3.1-1 are shared across each MC service. The description of the functions
and reference points specific to an MC service is contained in the
corresponding MC service TS.
In the model shown in figure 7.3.1-1, the following apply:
\- A specific MC service server is an instantiation of a GCS AS in accordance
with 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].
Figure 7.3.1-2 shows the functional model for the signalling control plane.
Figure 7.3.1-2: Functional model for signalling control plane
Figure 7.3.1-3 shows the relationships between the reference points of the
application plane of an MC service server and the signalling plane.
Figure 7.3.1-3: Relationships between reference points of MC service
application plane and signalling control planes
NOTE 1: Application plane reference point CSC-7 makes use of SIP-2 reference
point when the group management servers are connected by a single SIP core.
Where they are joined by more than one SIP core, CSC-7 also makes use of the
SIP-3 reference point.
NOTE 2: For simplicity, the HTTP proxy, which provides the interconnection
between HTTP-1, HTTP-2 and HTTP-3 reference points, is not shown in figure
7.3.1-3.
NOTE 3: CSC-5, CSC-9, and CSC-15 make use of SIP-1 and SIP-2 reference points.
For simplicity, this mapping relationship is not shown in figure 7.3.1-3.
### 7.3.2 Off-network functional model
Figure 7.3.2-1 shows the functional model for off-network operation.

finder in the MC service provider\'s domain uses the information from the MC
service provider\'s SIP database to identify the serving registrar in the MC
service provider domain.
2) Registrar finder and registrar in the PLMN operator domain: registrar
finder uses information from PLMN operator\'s SIP database to identify the
serving registrar in the PLMN operator domain.
3) Registrar finder in PLMN operator domain and registrar in MC service
provider domain: registrar finder uses information from the MC service
provider\'s SIP database to identify the serving registrar in the MC service
provider domain.
NOTE 1: The need for the registrar finder is deployment specific e.g. a
deployment that has only one registrar does not need the registrar finder and
the related SIP database information.

acts as an inbound proxy (with access to the integral location server), and
outbound proxy for all SIP transactions where application service selection is
required. It registers the user and maintains the association of the location
and identity of the user in a location service. It provides notifications of
the registration states.
\- Supports authentication for identities provided within SIP signalling. Both
the registrar (with integral location server) and authentication functions are
supported by access either to the public network\'s own SIP database or the MC
service provider\'s SIP database.

#### 7.4.3.2 SIP database
##### 7.4.3.2.1 General
The SIP database contains information concerning the SIP subscriptions and
corresponding identity and authentication information required by the SIP
core, and such information as application service selection.
In deployment scenarios where the PLMN operator provides the SIP core, this
database is provided by the HSS.
In deployment scenarios where the MC service provider provides the SIP core,
the SIP database may be provided by the MC service provider.
Access to the data residing in the SIP database is restricted to the SIP core
entities that are specifically serving the subscriber/user whose data are
stored, i.e. registrars and registrar finders can access SIP databases only
when they are part of the same trust domain for the data being provided.
NOTE: The SIP database can be in a different network than the registrar finder
since the trust domain for the criteria for registrar selection can be
different than the trust domain for the signalling plane user identities.
The SIP database is responsible for storing the following user related
information:
\- signalling plane user identities: Numbering and addressing information;
\- signalling plane security information: SIP core access control information
for authentication and authorization;
\- MC service UE Location information at inter-system level: the SIP database
supports the user registration, and stores inter-system location information,
etc.; and
\- signalling plane subscription profile (including initial filter criteria).
The SIP database also generates signalling plane security information for
mutual authentication, communication integrity check and ciphering.
Based on this information, the SIP database is also responsible to support the
call control and session management entities of the SIP core.
The SIP database consists of the following functionalities:
\- support for control functions of the SIP core such as the Registrar and
Registrar finder. This is needed to enable subscriber usage of the SIP core
services. This functionality is independent of the access network used to
access the SIP core; and
\- authentication functionality required by the SIP core to authenticate the
MC service UE.
##### 7.4.3.2.2 SIP database logical functions
The SIP database provides the following logical functions:
a) mobility management;
\- provides the UE mobility through the SIP core.
b) registrar assignment support;
\- provides to the registrar finder the required capabilities for MC services
based on MC service provider requirements on a per-user basis, (e.g. whether a
particular registrar within the PLMN operator\'s network (e.g. a registrar
reserved for MC service use or a registrar in a secure location) or a
registrar within the MC service provider network is assigned.
c) call and/or session establishment support;
\- provides the call and/or session establishment procedures in the SIP core.
For terminating traffic, it provides information on which registrar currently
hosts the user.
d) user security information generation;
\- provides generation of user authentication, integrity and ciphering data
for the SIP core.
e) signalling plane security support;
\- provides authentication procedures to access MC services by storing the
generated data for authentication, integrity and ciphering at the signalling
plane and by providing these data to the appropriate registrar.
f) user identification handling;
\- provides the appropriate relations among all the identifiers uniquely
determining the signalling plane identities in the SIP core e.g. IMS public
identities.
g) access authorisation; and
\- provides authorisation of the user for mobile access when requested by the
registrar e.g. by checking that the user is allowed to roam to that visited
network.
h) service authorisation support.
\- provides basic authorisation for terminating call/session establishment and
service invocation. The SIP database may update the registrar with filter
criteria to trigger the MC service server(s).
#### 7.4.3.3 HTTP entities
##### 7.4.3.3.1 HTTP client
This functional entity acts as the client for all hypertext transactions.
##### 7.4.3.3.2 HTTP proxy
This functional entity acts as a proxy for hypertext transactions between the
HTTP client and one or more HTTP servers. The HTTP proxy terminates a TLS
session on HTTP-1 with the HTTP client of the MC service UE allowing the HTTP
client to establish a single TLS session for hypertext transactions with
multiple HTTP servers that are reachable by the HTTP proxy.
The HTTP proxy is not used as part of CSC-1 interface. CSC-1 is a direct HTTP
interface between the IdM client in the UE and the IdM server as specified in
3GPP TS 33.180 [25].
According to 3GPP TS 33.180 [25], either an HTTP proxy or a direct HTTP
interface is used between the key management server and the key management
client in the UE for CSC-8.
The HTTP proxy shall be in the same trust domain as the HTTP clients and HTTP
servers that are located within a MC service provider\'s network. There can be
multiple instances of an HTTP proxy e.g. one per trust domain.
NOTE: The number of instances of the HTTP proxy is deployment specific.

# 8 Identities
## 8.1 Application plane
### 8.1.1 Mission Critical user identity (MC ID)
The mission critical user identity is also known as the MC ID. The MC ID is
the identity that an MC service user presents to the identity management
server during a user authentication transaction. In general, since identity
management is a common service it uses an identity which is linked to a set of
credentials (e.g. biometrics, secureID, username/password) that may not
necessarily be tied to a single mission critical service. The MC ID and the MC
service ID may be the same. The MC ID uniquely identifies the MC service user
to the identity management server. The MC ID is used by the identity
management server to provide the identity management client a means for
mission critical service authentication.
NOTE: The specific security and authentication mechanisms required in order to
use the MC user identity is specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [25].
### 8.1.2 MC service user identity (MC service ID)
The MC service user identity is also known as the MC service ID. The MC
service ID is a globally unique identifier within the MC service that
represents the MC service user. The MC service ID identifies an MC service
user. The MC service ID may also identify one or more MC service user profiles
for the user at the application layer.
There are attributes associated with the MC service ID configured in the MC
service that relate to the human user of the MC service. Typically this
information identifies the MC service user, by name or role, may also identify
a user\'s organization or agency, and may also identify MC service user\'s
service subscription to one or more MC services. Such attributes associated
with an MC service ID can be used by the MC service server to make
authorization decisions about the MC service granted to the user. For example,
if the MC service user is subscribed to MCPTT service, an attribute that
identifies a user\'s role as an incident commander could automatically be used
by the MCPTT service to grant the user additional administrative rights over
the creation of groups, or access to privileged talk groups.
The MC service ID shall be a URI. The MC service ID uniquely identifies an MC
service user in an MC system. The MC service ID indicates the MC system where
the MC service ID is defined.
When required by the MC service provider, the MC service ID is hidden from the
signalling control plane.
A default or temporary MC service ID may be used where a user is not yet
associated with a device. When a user would like to use one or more MC
services but has not been authenticated by the identity management server, a
default or temporary MC service ID and a corresponding MC service user profile
may be used.
### 8.1.3 MC service group identity (MC service group ID)
#### 8.1.3.1 General
The MC service group identity is also known as the MC service group ID. The MC
service group ID is a globally unique identifier within the MC service that
represents a set of MC service users. The set of MC service users may belong
to the same or different MC systems. The MC system for each user (within the
group) is identified by each user\'s respective MC service ID.
The MC service group ID identifies an MC service group in an MC system. It
indicates the MC system where the MC service group is defined. It indicates
the MC service server within the MC system where the group is defined as
described in subclause 8.3.2.
The MC service group ID is used as follows:
a) For identifying a set of identities of its group members; and
b) By the MC service client to address the MC service group.
The MC service group ID shall be a URI.
When required by the MC service provider, the MC service group ID is hidden
from the signalling control plane.
#### 8.1.3.2 MC service group ID management (off-network operation)
In off-network operation, an MC service group ID is used for identifying the
MC service group while off-network. The MC service group ID should be resolved
to the ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID for the
group communication. The MC service UE is able to make one or more MC service
communications (as per the group configuration) with other member UEs whose
users are of the same MC service group ID over ProSe direct communications
based on ProSe Layer-2 Group ID and ProSe Group IP multicast address, and
utilising IPv4 or IPv6 as indicated by policy, as described in 3GPP TS 23.303
[14].
Figure 8.1.3.2-1 illustrates how the MC service group ID, ProSe Group IP
multicast address and the ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are mapped to each other.
ProSe Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured
in accordance with the MC service group ID. Thus, they are pre-defined and
associated. This mapping information should be provisioned through UICC in the
UE or through ProSe function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14], or be
delivered from an application server. Mapping information is provisioned from
group management server for online configuration, and provisioned from
configuration management server for offline configuration.
NOTE: To define the retrieval mechanism of the off-network information (ProSe
Group IP multicast address and ProSe Layer-2 Group ID) from ProSe function to
group management server is out of scope of the present document.
Figure 8.1.3.2-1: MC service group ID management in off-network operation
## 8.2 SIP signalling control plane
The SIP signalling control plane depends upon the use of both a private user
identity and one or more public user identities.
When the signalling user agent sends registration requests to the registrar /
application service selection, the private user identity is used to find
corresponding credentials for authentication of the signalling user agent by
the registrar / application service selection. This private user identity
fulfils the same functions as the IMPI defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
All SIP signalling messages sent by a signalling user agent to an MC service
server via a SIP core use a public user identity as the identifier to enable
signalling messages to be routed through the SIP system. The public user
identity fulfils the same functions as IMPU defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
NOTE 1: The relationship between the private user identity and public user
identity is defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
The public user identities do not necessarily contain any application-level
attributes of MC services (e.g., MCPTT ID). Any association of the public user
identities with such attributes occurs at the application layer only.
When the SIP core and the MC service are part of the same trust domain, public
user identities may be provided by the MC service provider or the PLMN
operator. When the SIP core and the MC service are part of the different trust
domains, public user identities may be provided by the PLMN operator.
NOTE 2: The MC service provider can have an agreement with the PLMN operator
to manage a pool of public user identities.
The SIP core may generate public GRUUs and temporary GRUUs in order to
uniquely identify MC service UEs when a user logging on from multiple devices
or multiple users sharing the same device is supported per 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
Public service identity is used as the identifier to route SIP signalling for
the MC system. The public service identity fulfils the same functions as PSI
defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
## 8.3 Relationship between identities in different planes
### 8.3.1 Relationship between MC service ID and public user identity
The following relationships exist between the MC service ID(s) and the public
user identity(ies):
\- An MC service ID may be mapped to one or more public user identities (e.g.
multiple UEs, shared UE, multiple MC services);
\- A public user identity may be mapped to one or more MC service IDs (e.g.
UE-to-network relay); and
\- An MC service ID may be mapped to one or more public GRUUs (e.g. a user
logging on from multiple UEs, multiple users sharing the same UE).
The MC service server manages the mapping between MC service IDs and public
user identities.
The MC service server manages the mapping between MC service IDs and public
GRUUs.
Temporary GRUUs are mapped to public GRUUs by the SIP core.
The public user identity does not necessarily identify the MC service user at
the SIP signalling control plane. When the MC service provider and the home
PLMN operator are part of the same trust domain, the public user identity in
the SIP signalling control plane may also identify the MC service user at the
application plane.
### 8.3.2 Relationship between MC service group ID and public service identity
Each MC service group ID shall be mapped to a public service identity for the
MC service server where the group is defined. The MC service server manages
the mapping between MC service group IDs and public service identities.
When the MC service provider and the home PLMN operator are part of the same
trust domain, the public service identity in the SIP signalling control plane
may also identify the MC service group ID at the application plane.

servers
# 9 Application of functional model to deployments
## 9.1 General
This clause describes the application of the functional model, described in
clause 7, to on-network and off-network deployments. It also describes
deployment scenarios that highlight some of the possible variations in the way
that the functional model can be applied in different situations.
## 9.2 Architecture model and deployment scenarios for on-network operations
### 9.2.1 On-network architectural model
#### 9.2.1.1 On-network architectural model diagram
Figure 9.2.1.1-1 below is the on-network architectural model for the MC system
solution, where the MC system provides one or more MC services via a single
PLMN.
Figure 9.2.1.1-1: On-network architectural model
#### 9.2.1.2 Application services layer
##### 9.2.1.2.1 Overview
The application services layer includes application functions of one or more
MC services and any required supporting functions grouped into common services
core.
##### 9.2.1.2.2 Common services core
Common services core is composed of the following functional entities:
\- for common services, a configuration management server as described in
subclause 7.4.2.2.2, a group management server as described in subclause
7.4.2.2.4, an identity management server as described in subclause 7.4.2.2.6
and a key management server as described in subclause 7.4.2.2.8; and
\- for signalling control, an HTTP proxy as described in subclause 7.4.3.3.2
and an HTTP server as described in subclause 7.4.3.3.3.
##### 9.2.1.2.3 MC services
MC services are composed of the following functional entities:
\- an MC service server as described in subclause 7.4.2.3.2 with relevant
application functions of the corresponding MC service defined in the
corresponding MC service TS.
#### 9.2.1.3 SIP core
The SIP core provides rendezvous (contact address binding and URI resolution)
and service control (application service selection) functions. It is composed
of the following functional entities:
\- for signalling control, a local inbound / outbound proxy as described in
subclause 7.4.3.1.3.2, a registrar finder as described in subclause
7.4.3.1.3.3 and a registrar / application service selection entity as
described in subclause 7.4.3.1.3.4.
#### 9.2.1.4 EPS
The EPS provides point-to-point and point-to-multipoint bearer services with
QoS.
#### 9.2.1.5 UE 1
UE 1 is:
\- an MC service UE in on-network mode supporting bearer services and
application(s) related to one or more MC service;
\- an MC service UE that acts as ProSe UE-to-network relay; or
\- both of the above.
When acting as an MC service UE in on-network mode supporting bearer services
and application(s) related to one or more MC services, UE 1 is composed of the
same functional entities as for UE 2, as described in subclause 9.2.1.6,
without the support of ProSe capabilities.
#### 9.2.1.6 UE 2
UE 2 is a device using ProSe UE-to-network relay, and supporting
application(s) related to one or more MC services. It is composed of the
following functional entities:
\- for common services, a group management client as described in subclause
7.4.2.2.3, a configuration management client as described in subclause
7.4.2.2.1, an identity management client as described in subclause 7.4.2.2.5
and a key management client as described in subclause 7.4.2.2.7;
\- for MC services, MC service clients as described in subclause 7.4.2.3.1
with relevant application functions of the corresponding MC service defined in
the corresponding MC service TS; and
\- for signalling control, a signalling user agent as described in subclause
7.4.3.1.1 and an HTTP client as described in subclause 7.4.3.3.1.
### 9.2.2 Deployment scenarios
#### 9.2.2.1 Administration of MC service, SIP core and EPS
##### 9.2.2.1.1 General
This subclause describes five different deployment scenarios in which
different administration of MC service, SIP core and EPS are described,
together with the sensitivities of identities and other forms of signalling in
those scenarios.
In each of these scenarios, the owner of the devices at each plane may be
different from the organisation that administers these devices. For example,
the MC service provider may own some RAN components within the EPS even when
the EPS is administered by the PLMN operator, and the MC service UE may be
owned by an organisation that is independent from PLMN and MC service
providers.
##### 9.2.2.1.2 Common administration of all planes
In this scenario, all planes (application services layer, SIP core and EPS)
are administered by the same party. This is illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.2-1
below.
Figure 9.2.2.1.2-1: Common administration of all services by one operator
Although the identities in each plane are separate according to clause 8,
there is no particular sensitivity of identities and other information at the
application plane, and these may be exposed to the SIP core and the EPS.
All authorisation and authentication mechanisms at each plane, i.e. the
application services layer, SIP core and EPS, shall be separate, but there may
be no need for any restrictions in how these are stored and managed; for
example the same entity could provide services to each of the application
services layer, SIP core and EPS.
##### 9.2.2.1.3 MC service provider separate from SIP core and EPS
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.3-1, the MC service
provider is separate and independent from the PLMN operator, and the MC
service is administered independently of the EPS and SIP core. The PLMN
operator administers the EPS and the SIP core.
Figure 9.2.2.1.3-1: MC service provider administers MC service separately from
SIP core and EPS
The MC service provider may require that all application services layer
identities and other sensitive information are hidden both from the SIP core
and the EPS.
When required by the MC service provider, all authentication and authorisation
mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer are
hidden from and not available to the PLMN operator.
##### 9.2.2.1.4 MC service provider administers SIP core, separate from EPS
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.4-1, the MC service
provider administers the SIP core, and the MC services and SIP core are
independent of the PLMN operator.
Figure 9.2.2.1.4-1: MC service provider provision of SIP core, separate domain
from EPS
The MC service provider may require that all identities and other sensitive
information at the application services layer are hidden from the EPS. The MC
service provider need not hide the identities and signalling at the
application services layer from the SIP core. However the MC service provider
may require that identities and other sensitive information between SIP core
and SIP client in the MC service UE are also hidden from the EPS.
All authentication and authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at
both application services layer and at SIP signalling plane may need to be
hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.
##### 9.2.2.1.5 SIP core partially administered by both PLMN operator and MC
service provider
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.5-1, the SIP core is
partially administered by both parties, for example when the SIP core
registrar is administered by the MC service provider, but the SIP core
registrar finder and proxy is administered by the PLMN operator.
Figure 9.2.2.1.5-1: MC service provider partial provision of SIP core,
separate domain from EPS
The MC service provider may require that all identities and signalling at the
application services layer are hidden from the EPS, and may require identities
and other sensitive information to be hidden from the PLMN operator
administered part of the SIP core.
All authentication and authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at
the application services layer may need to be hidden from, and not available
to, the PLMN operator.
##### 9.2.2.1.6 PLMN operator administers SIP core with SIP identities
administered by MC service provider
In this scenario, the PLMN operator administers the SIP core. However, the
identities used by the SIP core (IMPI and IMPU) for MC service UEs served by
the MC service provider are provided from the SIP database of the MC service
provider.
Figure 9.2.2.1.6-1: MC service provider provides identities to PLMN operator
SIP core
The MC service provider may require that all identities and signalling at the
application services layer are hidden from the SIP core and EPS.
When required by the MC service provider, all authentication and authorisation
mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer may
need to be hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.
The security roots (authentication keys) required for access to the signalling
control plane are not available to the PLMN operator as these are held in the
MC service provider\'s SIP database. However, derived parameters e.g.
authentication vectors are provided to the SIP core to allow signalling
control plane authentication to take place.
#### 9.2.2.2 MC service user database, SIP database and HSS
Figures 9.2.2.2-1 to 9.2.2.2-4 show the possible deployment scenarios of the
MC service user database and SIP database, including collocation with the HSS.
The MC service user database may be combined with an HSS in some deployment
scenarios (e.g. when the MC service provider and the PLMN operator are part of
the same trust domain).
The MC service user database may be a user data repository (UDR) in deployment
scenarios when the UDC architecture is applied (see 3GPP TS 23.335 [15]), in
that case the MC service server and the configuration management server are
assumed to be application front-ends and the Ud interface is used to access
data from the repository.
NOTE 1: As an implementation option, the SIP database can be located within
the SIP core, in which case the AAAâ€‘1 interface is not exposed.
NOTE 2: The MC service user database and the MC service server are always
deployed in the same network i.e. both in the PLMN operator\'s network or both
in the MC service provider\'s network.
Figure 9.2.2.2-1: Collocation of MC service user database and SIP database
with HSS
The HSS depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-1 can be deployed either in the PLMN
operator\'s network or the MC service provider\'s network.
Figure 9.2.2.2-2: Shared PLMN operator and MC service provider based
deployment of MC service - SIP database collocated with HSS with separate MC
service user database
The MC service user database depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-2 can be deployed in
the PLMN operator\'s network or the MC service provider\'s network, and the
HSS depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-2 can be deployed in the same or different
network to the MC service user database i.e. PLMN operator\'s network or the
MC service provider\'s network.
Figure 9.2.2.2-3: Shared PLMN operator and MC service provider based
deployment of MC service - MC service user database and SIP database deployed
together, with separate HSS
The MC service user database and SIP database depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-3 can
be deployed in the PLMN operator\'s network or the MC service provider\'s
network, and the HSS depicted in figure 9.2.2.2-3 can be deployed in the same
or different network to the MC service user database i.e. PLMN operator\'s
network or the MC service provider\'s network.
Figure 9.2.2.2-4: Shared PLMN operator and MC service provider based
deployment of MC service - separate HSS, MC service user database and SIP
database
Each of the MC service user database, SIP database and HSS depicted in figure
9.2.2.2-4 can be deployed in the same or different networks i.e. PLMN
operator\'s network or the MC service provider\'s network.
#### 9.2.2.3 Control of bearers by SIP core and MC service server
##### 9.2.2.3.1 General
This subclause describes two different scenarios in which bearers are
controlled by access to Rx by either the SIP core or the MC service server.
These may provide suitable models for each of the scenarios listed in
subclause 9.2.2.1. However, there is no direct correlation of any of the
scenarios described in this subclause to each of the scenarios described in
subclause 9.2.2.1.
##### 9.2.2.3.2 Control of bearers by SIP core
In this scenario, bearer control is performed by the SIP core alone, as shown
in figure 9.2.2.3.2-1 below.
Figure 9.2.2.3.2-1: Bearer control by SIP core
##### 9.2.2.3.3 Control of bearers by MC service server
In this scenario, bearer control is performed by the MC service server alone,
as shown in figure 9.2.2.3.3-1 below.
Figure 9.2.2.3.3-1: Bearer control by MC service server
## 9.3 Architecture model for off-network operations
### 9.3.1 Off-network architectural model diagram
Figure 9.3.1-1 shows the off-network architectural model for the MC system
solution for inter-UE communication, where no relay function is used.
Figure 9.3.1-1: Off-network architectural model for inter-UE communication
where no relay function is used
Figure 9.3.1-2 shows the off-network architectural model for the MC system
solution for configuration management and group management.
Figure 9.3.1-2: Off-network architectural model for configuration management
and group management
NOTE 1: The offline common services server denoted in figure 9.3.1-2 could be
provided by a portable device e.g. laptop.
NOTE 2: Non-EPS access can be any IP-CAN that is mutually supported by the
offline common services server and the UE 3, and which provides necessary
connectivity for the CSC-11 and CSC-12 reference points. It is out of scope of
this specification what type of IP-CANs are supported, but could be e.g. USB,
Bluetooth or WLAN.
The offline common services server could be the same entity (or set of
entities) as the common services core. In this case the configuration
management server shall not configure to the same user on the same UE, with
parameters provisioned by offline and online configuration simultaneously. The
configuration management server shall not configure to the same user on the
same UE for the same parameters by using CSC-11 and CSC-4 reference points
simultaneously.
The entities within this model are described in the following subclauses and a
full functional model is given in subclause 7.3.2.
### 9.3.2 UE 3
The UE 3 is a UE using ProSe and supporting application(s) related to off-
network MC service, and is composed of the following functional entities:
\- for MC services, MC service clients as described in subclause 7.4.2.3.1
with relevant application functions of the specific MC service defined in the
corresponding MC service TS;
\- for signalling control, a signalling user agent as described in subclause
7.4.3.1.1;
\- for configuration management, a configuration management client as
described in subclause 7.4.2.2.1; and
\- for group management, a group management client as described in subclause
7.4.2.2.3.
### 9.3.3 UE 4
The UE 4 represents one or more UEs with the same functionality as UE 3.
### 9.3.4 Offline common services server
The offline common services server supports configuration applications related
to MC service, and is composed of the following functional entities:
\- for configuration management, a configuration management server as
described in subclause 7.4.2.2.2; and
\- for group management, a group management server as described in subclause
7.4.2.2.4.
## 9.4 Architecture model for roaming
Roaming is achieved using either:
\- EPC-level roaming as defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [17]; or
\- IMS-level roaming as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].
# 10 Procedures and information flows
## 10.1 MC service configuration
### 10.1.1 General
Depicted in figure 10.1.1-1 is a MC service configuration time sequence of the
data related to specific MC service, representing the general lifecycle of MC
service UE using an MC service.
Figure 10.1.1-1 MC service UE configuration time sequence and associated
configuration data
The MC service UE is provided with initial UE configuration via a bootstrap
procedure that provides the MC service UE\'s clients (e.g. MC service client,
group management client, configuration management client, identity management
client, key management client) with critical information needed to connect to
the MC system. This includes PDN connection information corresponding to the
configured MC services on the MC service UE (see \"EPS bearer considerations\"
in the 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]) and on-network server identity information for all
application plane servers with which the MC service UE needs to interact. See
annex A.6 for more information.
The MC service UE is provided with UE configuration, MC service user profile
configuration and group configuration via online configuration. While the MC
service UE is using the MC service it may receive online configuration
updates. If the MC service user profile configuration contains multiple MC
service user profiles for an authenticated MC service user, then the MC
service client and MC service server set the active MC service user profile to
the configured pre-selected MC service user profile at MC service
authorization (which can be updated by the MC service user using the procedure
specified in subclause 10.1.4.6). The active MC service user profile can be
changed by the MC service user to a different MC service user profile during
MC service service (see MC service TSs).
The MC service is configured with the service configuration (not shown in the
figure 10.1.1-1) which the MC service enforces during the entire phase of MC
service UE using the MC service.
Editor\'s note: Providing MC services to an MC service UE with an
unauthenticated MC service user is FFS.

### 10.1.3 MC service UE configuration data
#### 10.1.3.1 General
The MC service UE configuration data has to be known by the MC service UE
before it can use the MC service.
#### 10.1.3.2 Procedures
The procedure for MC service UE obtaining the MC service UE related
configuration data is illustrated in figure 10.1.3.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service UE has the secure access to the configuration management
server.
Figure 10.1.3.2-1: MC service UE obtains the configuration data
1\. The configuration management client sends a get MC service UE
configuration request to the configuration management server for obtaining MC
service UE configuration data.
2\. The configuration management server sends get MC service UE configuration
response to the configuration management client. This message carries the MC
service UE configuration data.
#### 10.1.3.3 Structure of UE configuration data
For a MC service, the MC service UE configuration data is listed in the
corresponding MC service TS.
### 10.1.4 MC service user profile
#### 10.1.4.1 General
An MC service user is identified by an MC service ID. An MC service ID is
associated with at least one MC service user profile and can be associated
with multiple MC service user profiles (identified by an index and optionally
a profile name). This is depicted in figure 10.1.4.1-1.
Figure 10.1.4.1-1: The relationship of MC service user, MC service IDs, MC
service user profile and MC services
For an MC service user there can be multiple MC service IDs with the
constraint that only one MC service ID exists for a given MC service for that
MC service user (e.g. MC service ID X may correspond to MCPTT service and MC
service ID Y may correspond to MCVideo service). When the MC service provider
requires to support a single MC service ID for all MC services, the value of
the multiple MC service IDs is the same (e.g. value of MC service ID X is same
as MC service ID Y).
In the case where a single MC service ID is configured for a MC service user
for authorized access to multiple MC services, the MC service UE and MC
service server shall include the indication of the specific MC service during
the communication.
For the same MC service user there can be different MC service user profiles
active on different MC service UEs or different MC service user profiles
active on the same MC service UE at different times. Only one MC service user
profile per MC service client is active at a time.
All MC service user profiles associated with an MC service user are stored in
the MC service user database. Different parts of the MC service user profile
are provisioned by the Mission Critical Organization, by the MC service
provider and by the MC service user, respectively.
MC service user profile information is downloaded to the MC service UE. The MC
service user profile provisioning in the UE is initiated by the configuration
management client (e.g. upon MC service user authentication or on reconnect to
the MC service), or initiated by the configuration management server (e.g. due
to role change or organization change). MC service user profile configuration
may include more than one information exchange e.g. the configuration
management server may provide the MC service UE with a list of some or all
enabled MC service user profiles to allow the MC service user to select one
(where the list may contain a subset of the MC service user profile
information sufficient for the MC service user to distinguish which MC service
user profile to select).

request message to the configuration management server, which includes the MC
service ID.
2\. The configuration management server obtains the MC service user profile
information.
3\. The configuration management server sends get MC service user profile
response message to the configuration management client. When a download is
necessary, this message includes all MC service user profiles that are
associated with the MC service ID.
#### 10.1.4.4 MC service user receives updated MC service user profile data
from the network
The procedure for MC service user obtaining updated MC service user profile
data (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]) that is initiated by the network is illustrated
in figure 10.1.4.4-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service user has performed user authentication in identity
management server.
\- The MC service UE has secure access to the configuration management server.
\- The MC service UE has already obtained one or more MC service user
profiles.
\- The configuration management server has access to the MC service user
profile(s) associated with the MC service ID of the MC service user.
Figure 10.1.4.4-1: MC service user receives updated MC service user profile
data from the network
1\. The configuration management server obtains updated MC service user
profile data.
2\. The configuration management server sends a notification for MC service
user profile data update to the configuration management client.
3\. The configuration management client sends get updated MC service user
profile data request to the configuration management server, which includes
the MC service ID.
4\. The configuration management server sends get updated MC service user
profile data response to the configuration management client which includes
the updated MC service user profile data requested in step 3.
NOTE: The updated MC service user profile data could be for a specific MC
service user profile, a specific parameter in an MC service user profile, a
set of MC service user profiles, or all the MC service user profiles for the
MC service ID. MC service user profile data is defined per MC service. E.g.
the MC service user profile data related to MCPTT is defined in 3GPP TS 23.379
[16].
#### 10.1.4.5 MC service user updates MC service user profile data to the
network
The procedure for MC service user updating the MC service user profile data
(see 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]) is illustrated in figure 10.1.4.5-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service user has performed user authentication in identity
management server.
\- The MC service UE has secure access to the configuration management server.
\- The MC service UE has already obtained one or more MC service user
profiles.
Figure 10.1.4.5-1: MC service user updates MC service user profile data to the
network
1\. The configuration management client is triggered (e.g. by user interaction
operation) to update the MC service user profile data on the configuration
management server.
2\. The configuration management client sends update MC service user profile
data request to the configuration management server, which includes the MC
service user profile data to be updated.
3\. The configuration management server stores the received MC service user
profile data.
4\. The configuration management server sends update MC service user profile
data response to the configuration management client to confirm the MC service
user profile data update is complete.
NOTE: The updated MC service user profile data could be for a specific MC
service user profile, a specific parameter in an MC service user profile, a
set of MC service user profiles, or all the MC service user profiles for the
MC service ID. MC service user profile data is defined per MC service. E.g.
the MC service user profile data related to MCPTT is defined in 3GPP TS 23.379
[16].
#### 10.1.4.6 Updating the pre-selected MC service user profile
The procedure for updating the pre-selected MC service user profile in the
configuration for an MC service UE by the MC service user is illustrated in
figure 10.1.4.6-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service user has performed user authentication in identity
management server.
\- The MC service UE has secure access to the configuration management server.
\- The MC service UE has already obtained one or more MC service user
profiles.
\- The configuration management client is triggered (e.g. by user interaction,
by some automated means) to change the pre-selected MC service user profile.
Figure 10.1.4.6-1: MC service user updates the pre-selected MC service user
profile
1\. The configuration management client sends update pre-selected MC service
user profile request to the configuration management server, which includes
the MC service user\'s MC service ID and an MC service user profile index that
indicates which MC service user profile is to be pre-selected by the MC
service server at next MC service authorization.
2\. The configuration management server checks the authorization of the update
pre-selected MC service user profile request.
3\. The configuration management server stores the received pre-selected MC
service user profile selection.
4\. The configuration management server sends update pre-selected MC service
user profile response to the configuration management client to confirm the
pre-selected MC service user profile has been set.
NOTE: Steps 3 to 4 can occur in any order or in parallel.
For each update pre-selected MC service user profile request to the MC service
user profile, the configuration management server determines whether the
requested update is allowed prior to storing the configuration parameters and
updating the MC service user database (via the CSC-13 reference point as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.283 [19]).
After each update to the MC service user profile in the MC service user
database, the MC service server receives the changes from the MC service user
profile database via the corresponding MC service reference point defined
between MC service server and the MC service user database, and all of the MC
service UEs associated with the MC service user receive the updated MC service
user profile as specified in subclause 10.1.4.4.
A change to the pre-selected MC service user profile while the MC service user
is receiving MC service does not have any effect on the active MC service user
profile, however, the change will be applied at the next MC service
authorization.
Editor\'s note: Specifying pre-selected MC service user profile specific to
each UE associated with an MC service user is FFS.
#### 10.1.4.7 Updating the selected MC service user profile for an MC service
The procedure for updating the selected MC service user profile within a
single MC service for an MC service UE by the MC service user whilst the MC
service user is receiving that MC service service is illustrated in figure
10.1.4.7-1. This procedure is used by the following MC services:
\- MCPTT (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]);
\- MCVideo (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]); and
\- MCData (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]).
Pre-conditions:
\- For the MC service (see list above) for which the selected MC service user
profile is to be updated:
\- The MC service user has performed user authentication in the identity
management server.
\- The MC service UE has secure access to the MC service server.
\- The MC service UE has already obtained multiple MC service user profiles.
\- The MC service UE has performed MC service authorization.
\- The MC service client is triggered (e.g. by user interaction, by some
automated means) to select a particular MC service user profile as active.
Figure 10.1.4.7-1: MC service user updates the selected MC service user
profile
1\. MC service client sends update selected MC service user profile request to
the MC service server, which includes the MC service user\'s MC service ID and
an MC service user profile index that indicates which MC service user profile
is selected to be currently active for MC service client.
2\. If the MPCTT server does not have stored the MC service user profile data
for the MC service user, then the MC service server obtains the MC service
user profile data.
3\. The MC service server stores the selected MC service user profile index
for the MC service client.
NOTE 1: Different MC service user profiles can be active for different MC
service clients of the same MC service user.
4\. If the MC service server does not have stored the group configuration data
for the selected MC service user profile then the MC service server obtains
group configuration data according to the selected MC service user profile
(see subclause 10.1.5.2) and subscribes to updates of the group configuration
data (see subclause 10.1.5.3).
5\. The MC service server sends update selected MC service user profile
response to the MC service client to confirm the active MC service user
profile has been set.
NOTE 2: Steps 4 to 5 can occur in any order or in parallel.
6\. If the MC service client does not have stored the group configuration data
for the selected MC service user profile then the MC service client obtains
group configuration data according to the successfully selected MC service
user profile (see subclauase 10.1.5.2) and subscribes to updates of the group
configuration data (see subclause 10.1.5.3).
After each of the MC service server and the MC service UE have successfully
negotiated a selected MC service user profile, then both the MC service server
and the MC service UE, based upon the selected MC service user profile, clear
any currently active service state from any previously selected or pre-
selected MC service user profile data (including deaffiliating from relevant
groups, disconnecting any MC service calls) and process the successfully
negotiated selected MC service user profile data e.g. perform any needed
affiliations.
### 10.1.5 MC service group configuration management
#### 10.1.5.1 Store group configurations at the group management server
The procedure for store group configurations at the group management server is
described in figure 10.1.5.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The group management server may have some pre-configuration data which can
be used for online group configuration validation;
Figure 10.1.5.1-1: Store group configurations at group management server
1\. The group configurations are received by the group management client of an
authorized user.
2\. The received group configurations are sent to the group management server
for storage using a store group configuration request.
3\. The group management server may validate the group configurations before
storage.
4\. The group management server stores the group configurations.
5\. The group management server provides a store group configuration response
indicating success or failure. If any validation or storage fails, the group
management server provides a failure indication in the store group
configuration response.
#### 10.1.5.2 Retrieve group configurations at the group management client
The procedure for retrieve group configurations at the group management client
is described in figure 10.1.5.2-1. This procedure can be used following
service authorisation when the configuration management client has received
the list of groups and the group management client needs to obtain the group
configurations, or following a notification from the group management server
that new group configuration information is available.
Pre-conditions:
\- The group management server has received configuration data for groups, and
has stored this configuration data;
\- The MC service UE has registered for service and the group management
client needs to download group configuration data applicable to the current
user.
Figure 10.1.5.2-1: Retrieve group configurations at group management client
1\. The group management client requests the group configuration data.
2\. The group management server provides the group configuration data to the
client.
3\. The group management client stores the group configuration information.
#### 10.1.5.3 Subscription and notification for group configuration data
The procedure for subscription for group configuration data as described in
figure 10.1.5.3-1 is used by the group management client to indicate to the
group management server that it wishes to receive updates of group
configuration data for groups for which it is authorized.
Pre-conditions:
\- The group management server has some group configurations stored.
Figure 10.1.5.3-1: Subscription for group configurations
1\. The group management client subscribes to the group configuration
information stored at the group management server using the subscribe group
configuration request.
2\. The group management server provides a subscribe group configuration
response to the group management client indicating success or failure of the
request.
The procedure for notification of group configuration data as described in
figure 10.1.5.3-2 is used by the group management server to inform the group
management client that new group configuration data is available. It can also
be used by the group management server to provide new group related key
material to the group management client.
Pre-conditions:
\- The group management client has subscribed to the group configuration
information
\- The group management server has received and stored new group configuration
information, or the group management server has generated and stored new key
material, or both of these have occurred.
Figure 10.1.5.3-2: Notification of group configurations
1\. The group management server provides the notification to the group
management client, who previously subscribed for the group configuration
information. Optionally, the notify group configuration request may contain
group related key material for the group management client.
2\. The group management client provides a notify group configuration response
to the group management server.
3\. If the group management server had provided group related key material to
the group management client, the group management client stores the key
material.
If the group management server has notified the group management client about
new group configuration information through this procedure, the group
management client may then follow the procedure described in subclause
10.1.5.2 in order to retrieve that group configuration information.
#### 10.1.5.4 Structure of group configuration data
The group configuration data contains group configuration data common to all
MC services and group configuration data specific to each MC service. All
group configuration data is specified in Annex A.4 of the present document.
#### 10.1.5.5 Dynamic data associated with a group
There may be dynamic data associated with a group. The following dynamic data
is known to the MC service server and provided when requested:
Table 10.1.5.5-1: Dynamic data associated with a group

## 10.2 Group management (on-network)
### 10.2.1 General
Group management procedures apply to on-network MC service only.
Group creation provides a dedicated MC service group to individual MC service
users to enable the required communication for one or multiple MC services.
This includes the normal group creation by administrators as well as user
regrouping by authorized user/dispatcher.
For an MC service, group regrouping enables dispatchers or authorized users to
temporarily combine several MC service groups.
NOTE 1: If an authorized MC service user wants to participate in a new group
created by the authorized MC service user, then the authorized MC service user
needs to have been included in the new group as a member and have affiliated
to the new group.
NOTE 2: If an authorized MC service user wants to participate in a temporary
group created by a group regroup operation performed by this authorized MC
service user, then the authorized MC service user needs to have been an
existing member of and affiliated to at least one of the constituent groups
that was part of the associated group regroup operation and have affiliated to
the new temporary group.

### 10.2.3 Group creation
Figure 10.2.3-1 below illustrates the group creation operations by authorized
MC service user/ MC service administrator to create a group. It applies to the
scenario of normal group creation by an MC service administrator and user
regrouping operations by authorized user/dispatcher.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management client, group management server, MC service server
and the MC service group members belong to the same MC system.
2\. The administrator/authorized user/dispatcher is aware of the users\'
identities which will be combined to form the MC service group.
Figure 10.2.3-1: Group creation
1\. The group management client of the administrator/dispatcher/authorized MC
service user requests group create operation to the group management server.
The identities of the users being combined and the information of the MC
services that are enabled on the group shall be included in this message.
2\. During the group creation, the group management server creates and stores
the information of the group as group configuration data as described in
subclause 10.1.5.4. The group management server performs the check on the
maximum limit of the total number (Nc6) of MC service group members for the MC
service group(s).
3\. The group management server may conditionally notify the MC service server
regarding the group creation with the information of the group members. During
user regroup, the group management server notifies the MC service server
regarding the group creation with the information of the temporary group
members. The MC service users of the temporary group may be automatically
affiliated, if configured on the MC service server.
4\. The MC service group members of the MC service group are notified about
the newly created MC service group configuration data.
5\. The group management server provides a group creation confirmation
response to the group management client of the
administrator/dispatcher/authorized MC service user.
### 10.2.4 Group regrouping
#### 10.2.4.1 Temporary group formation - group regrouping within an MC system
Figure 10.2.4.1-1 below illustrates the group regroup operations to create a
temporary group within an MC system. For simplicity, only the case of two MC
service groups being combined is represented, but the procedure is the same if
more than two groups are combined.
NOTE: The temporary group formation is applicable only for groups configured
with the same MC service(s).
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management client, group management server, MC service server
and the MC service group members belong to the same MC system.
Figure 10.2.4.1-1: Group regroup for the groups within the same MC system
1\. The group management client of the MC service user requests group regroup
operation to the group management server, where the groups being combined are
within the same MC system. The identities of the groups being combined shall
be included in this message. The group management client may indicate the
security level required for the temporary group. The group management client
may indicate the priority level required for the temporary group.
2\. The group management server checks whether group regroup operation is
performed by an authorized MC service user, based on group policy. The group
management server checks whether group1 or group2 is a temporary group. If
group 1 or group2 is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be
rejected, otherwise the group regrouping can proceed.
3\. The group management server creates and stores the information of the
temporary group, including the temporary MC service group ID, the MC service
group ID of the groups being combined, the priority level of the temporary
group and the security level of the temporary group. If the authorized MC
service user does not specify the security level and the priority level, the
group management server shall set the lowest security level and the highest
priority of the constituent groups.
4\. The group management server notifies the MC service server regarding the
temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups, i.e.
temporary MC service group ID, group1\'s MC service group ID and group2\'s MC
service group ID.
5\. The group management server notifies the affiliated MC service group
members of the constituent MC service groups, possibly with an indication of
lower security level.
6\. The group management server provides a group regroup response to the group
management client of the authorized MC service user.
Editor\'s note: The temporary group formation for different MC services
belonging to the same mission critical system is FFS.
#### 10.2.4.2 Temporary group formation involving multiple MC systems
Figure 10.2.4.2-1 below illustrates the group regroup operations to create a
temporary group involving multiple MC systems. For simplicity, only the case
of two MC service groups being combined is represented, but the procedure is
the same if more than two groups are combined.
NOTE: The temporary group formation is applicable only for groups configured
with the same MC service(s).
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, we consider the partner MC system does not share
their users\' information to the primary MC system.
2\. The primary MC system consists of the group management server 1 and MC
service server (primary). The partner MC system consists of the group
management server 2 and MC service server (partner).
3\. The group management client of the authorized MC service user belongs to
the primary MC system.
Figure 10.2.4.2-1: Temporary group formation - group regrouping involving
multiple MC systems
1\. The group management client of the MC service user (e.g. dispatcher)
requests group regroup operation to the group management server 1 (which is
the group management server of the authorized MC service user). The identities
of the groups being combined shall be included in this message. The group
management client may indicate the security level required for the temporary
group. The group management client may indicate the priority level required
for the temporary group.
2\. The group management server checks whether group regroup operation is
performed by an authorized MC service user, based on group policy. The group
management server 1 checks whether group1 is a temporary group. If group1 is a
temporary group, then the group regrouping will be rejected, otherwise the
group regrouping can proceed.
3\. The group management server 1 forwards the group regroup request to the
target group management server 2 with the information of the group management
server 2 MC service groups.
4\. The group management server 2 checks whether group2 is a temporary group.
If group2 is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be rejected,
otherwise the group regrouping can proceed.
5\. The group management server 2 provides a group regroup response. Due to
security aspects concerning sharing information among different MC systems,
the group management server 2 does not share the users\' information of the
groups under its management to the group management server 1.
NOTE: If there is a trust relationship between the primary MC service provider
and the partner MC service provider, the partner MC system can share their
users\' information to the primary MC system at this step. If there is a
change in partner MC system\'s constituent group membership, the
synchronization procedure with the primary MC system for temporary group is
out of scope of this specification
6\. The group management server 1 creates and stores the information of the
temporary group, including the temporary MC service group ID, off-network
information, and the MC service IDs of the groups being combined, the priority
level of the temporary group, and the security level of the temporary group.
If the authorized MC service user does not specify the security level and the
priority level, the group management server shall set the lower security level
and the higher priority of the constituent groups.
7\. The group management server 1 notifies the group management server 2 about
its group regroup operation.
8\. The group management server 2 acknowledges the group management server 1
and the group management server 2 also stores the information about the
temporary group including the temporary MC service group ID, the MC service
group IDs of the groups being combined, the priority level of the temporary
group and the security level of the temporary group.
9\. The group management server 2 notifies the partner MC service server
regarding the temporary group creation with the information of the constituent
groups i.e. temporary MC service group ID, group1\'s MC service group ID and
group2\'s MC service group ID.
10\. Partner MC service server acknowledges the notification from the group
management server 2.
11\. The group management server 2 notifies the affiliated MC service group
members of the constituent MC service groups of the group management server 2,
possibly with an indication of a lower security level.
12\. The group management server 1 notifies the MC service server of the
primary system regarding the temporary group creation with the information of
the constituent groups, i.e. temporary MC service group ID, group1\'s MC
service group ID and group2\'s MC service group ID. If there are active calls
to be merged then the group management server 1 includes an indication to
merge active calls.
13\. Primary MC service server acknowledges the notification from the group
management server 1.
14\. The group management server 1 notifies the affiliated MC service group
members of the constituent MC service groups of the group management server 1,
possibly with an indication of lower security level.
15\. The group management server 1 provides a group regroup response to the
group management client of the authorized MC service user (e.g. dispatcher).
Editor\'s note: The temporary group formation for different MC services
belonging to multiple mission critical system is FFS.
#### 10.2.4.3 Temporary group tear down involving multiple group host servers
Figure 10.2.4.3-1 below illustrates the tearing down procedure of temporary
group created through the group regroup operation. The procedure can be used
when, e.g., the specific task for which the temporary group was created has
been completed or a busier period occurs. For simplicity, only the teardown
case for a temporary group with two MC service groups is represented. The
procedure is applicable for more than two groups combined in this temporary
group.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The security aspects of sharing the user information between primary and
partner MC systems shall be governed as per the service provider agreement
between them. In this case, it considers the partner MC system does not share
their users\' information to the primary MC system.
2\. The primary MC system consists of the group management server 1 and MC
service server (primary). The partner MC system consists of the group
management server 2 and MC service server (partner).
3\. The group management client of the authorized MC service user belongs to
the primary MC system.
4\. The temporary group to be torn down is comprised of multiple MC service
groups, and is created through the group regrouping procedure as described in
subclause 10.2.4.2.
Figure 10.2.4.3-1: Temporary group tear down
1\. The group management client of the MC service user requests group regroup
teardown operation to the group management server 1 (which is the group
management server where the temporary group is created and stored). The
identity of the temporary group (MC service group ID) being torn down shall be
included in this message. This message may route through some other signalling
nodes.
2\. The group management server checks whether group regroup operation is
performed by an authorized MC service user, based on group policy. The group
management server 1 checks whether the MC service group ID is a temporary
group. If MC service group ID is not a temporary group, then the group regroup
teardown request will be rejected, otherwise the group regroup teardown can
proceed.
3\. Any active group call for the temporary group is completed.
4\. The group management server 1 tears down the temporary group, i.e., remove
the temporary group related information.
5\. The group management server 1 notifies the primary MC service server
regarding the temporary group teardown.
6\. The group management server 1 notifies the affiliated MC service group
members regarding the temporary group teardown.
7\. The group management server 1 sends a group regroup teardown notification
(7a) and receives a group regroup teardown notification response (7b) messages
with the group management server 2 -- group management server in another MC
system regarding the temporary group teardown.
8-9. The group management server 2 notifies the partner MC service server and
the affiliated MC service group members regarding the temporary group
teardown.
NOTE: Step 7, 8 and 9 are only performed when the teardown of the temporary
group involves constituent groups from different MC systems.
10\. The group management server 1 provides a group regroup teardown
confirmation response to the group management client of the authorized MC
service user.
### 10.2.5 Membership and affiliation list query
#### 10.2.5.1 General
An MC service user can request the membership or affiliation list on an MC
service group regardless the user\'s group membership or affiliation.
#### 10.2.5.2 Procedure
Figure 10.2.5.2-1 below illustrates the membership or affiliation list query
on an MC service group.
Figure 10.2.5.2-1: membership or affiliation list query
1\. The group management client of the MC servicer user requests the
membership or affiliation list on the MC service group from the group
management server by sending a group information query request. The query type
is included.
2\. The group management server checks whether the MC servicer user is
authorized to perform the query. If authorized, then the group management
server retrieve the requested group information based on the query type.
3\. The group management server sends a group information query response
including the retrieved group information to the group management client.
### 10.2.6 Group membership
#### 10.2.6.1 Group membership notification
Figure 10.2.6.1-1 illustrates the group membership notification operations to
the MC service server(s) and group management clients upon the group
membership change at group management server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management server and MC service server serve the same MC
system.
Figure 10.2.6.1-1: group membership notification
1\. The membership of a specific MC service group is changed at group
management server.
2\. The group management server notifies the MC service server(s) regarding
the group membership change with the information of the updated group members.
3\. The group management server updates the group management clients of the MC
service users who have been added to or removed from the group.
4\. The group management client requests to retrieve the relevant group
configurations from group management server by procedure defined in subclause
10.1.5.2, if the user is added to the group. If the user is deleted from the
group, the locally stored group configurations in the MC service UE may be
removed.
#### 10.2.6.2 Group membership update by authorized user
Figure 10.2.6.2-1 below illustrates the group membership update operations by
an authorized user/administrator/dispatcher to change the membership a MC
service group (e.g. to add or delete group members).
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management server and MC service server serve the same MC
service system;
2\. The initiator of this operation is aware of the current group membership
of the MC service group;
3\. The Administrator/dispatcher/authorized user is aware of the users\'
identities which will be added to or deleted from the MC service group.
Figure 10.2.6.2-1: Group membership update by authorized user
1\. The group management client of the administrator/dispatcher/authorized
user requests group membership update operation to the group management
server.
2\. The group management server updates the group membership information. The
group management server may perform the check on the maximum limit of the
total number (Nc6) of MC service group members.
3\. The group management server notifies the MC service server(s) regarding
the group membership change with the information of the updated group members.
4\. The group members that are added to or deleted from the group by this
operation are notified about the group membership change. This step may be
followed by retrieving group configurations defined in subclause 10.1.5.2
5\. The group management server provides a group membership response to the
group management client of the administrator/dispatcher/authorized user.
### 10.2.7 Group deletion
Figure 10.2.7-1 below illustrates the group deletion procedure by an
authorized MC service user/ MC service administrator to delete a group in the
primary MC system. Any actions taken by the group management clients on the UE
after receiving the group deletion notification are outside the scope of this
procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management clients, the group management server, and the MC
service server belong to the same MC system.
2\. The group management client (originator) is for an authorized user with
authorization to perform the group deletion.
Figure 10.2.7-1: Group deletion
1\. The group management client (originator) of an authorized MC service user
sends a group deletion request to the group management server.2. The group
management server checks whether the MC service user is authorized to perform
the group deletion operation. For an authorized MC service user, the group
management server will proceed to delete the group and move to step 3. If the
MC service user is not authorized, then the group management server will not
delete the group and move to step 5 sending a group deletion response failure.
3\. The group management server sends a group deletion notification to the MC
service server of the group as well as any MC service servers subscribed to
the group. When a group is configured for multiple MC services, the group
deletion notification is sent from the group management server to all MC
service servers subscribed to the group. Affiliations to the deleted group
will be removed.
> NOTE1: Any actions taken by the MC service server upon receiving the group
> deletion notification are not shown in this procedure. Whether ongoing calls
> associated with the group deletion are impacted is left to implementation.
4\. The group management server sends the group deletion notification to group
management clients for all group members of the deleted group. MC service
client affiliations to the deleted group are removed.
> NOTE2: It is assumed in this flow that the group management client
> (originator) is not a member of the group, so it does not receive a group
> deletion notification.
5\. The group management server sends a group deletion response to the group
management client (originator).
## 10.3 Pre-established session (on-network)
### 10.3.1 General
A pre-established session is a session established between an MC service
client and the MC service server, on a per MC service basis, to exchange
necessary media parameters needed for the definition of media bearers,
allowing a faster set-up of MC service calls/sessions.
After a pre-established session is established, a media bearer carrying the
media and media control messages is always active. The MC service client
establishes one or more pre-established sessions to an MC service server after
SIP registration, and prior to initiating any MC service related procedures
(e.g. calls, sessions) to other MC service users. When establishing a pre-
established session, the MC service client negotiates the media parameters,
including establishing IP addresses and ports using interactive connectivity
establishment (ICE) as specified in IETF RFC 5245 [22], which later can be
used in MC service calls/sessions. This avoids the need to negotiate media
parameters (including evaluating ICE candidates) and reserving bearer
resources during the MC service call/session establishment that results in
delayed MC service call/session establishment.
The use of pre-established session on the origination side is completely
compatible with the use of on demand session on the termination side. The use
of pre-established session on the termination side is completely compatible
with the use of on demand session on the origination side.
The pre-established session may be modified by the MC service client and the
MC service server using the SIP procedures for session modification.
The pre-established session may be released by the MC service client and the
MC service server using the SIP procedures for terminating a SIP session.
### 10.3.2 Procedures
#### 10.3.2.1 General
The pre-established session can be established after MC service authorization
for the user (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]).
The pre-established session is a session establishment procedure between the
MC service client and the MC service server to exchange necessary media
parameters needed for the definition of the media bearers. After the pre-
established session is established, the media bearer carrying the floor
control messages is always active. Additionally, the MC service client is able
to activate the media bearer carrying the voice whenever needed:
\- immediately after the pre-established session procedure; or
\- using SIP signalling when an MC service call is initiated.
#### 10.3.2.2 Pre-established session establishment
The pre-established session is a session between the MC service client and the
MC service server in the MC system, and which may utilise other functional
entities (e.g. a media distribution function, as defined in subclause
7.4.2.3.5, for means of obtaining media parameters and gathering ICE
candidates). Figure 10.3.2.2-1 represents the pre-established session
establishment flow.
Figure 10.3.2.2-1: Pre-established session establishment
1\. The MC service client within the MC service UE gathers ICE candidates.
2\. The MC service client within the MC service UE sends a request to the MC
service server to create a pre-established session.
3\. MC service server performs necessary service control, obtains media
parameters (e.g. by means of interacting with a media distribution function of
the MC service server) and gathers ICE candidates.
4\. MC service server sends a create pre-establish session response to the MC
service client within the MC service UE.
5\. ICE candidate pair checks take place e.g. between the MC service client
within the MC service UE and a media distribution function of the MC service
server.
6\. If necessary the MC service client within the MC service UE sends a modify
pre-established session request to the MC service server to update the ICE
candidate pair for the pre-established session.
7\. The MC service server sends a modify pre-established session response
accepting the ICE candidate pair update.
The media sessions consist of at least an active media session carrying the
media and media control messages and an inactive media session for the media.
#### 10.3.2.3 Pre-established session modification
Figure 10.3.2.3-1 represents the pre-established session modification flow.
Figure 10.3.2.3-1: Pre-established session modification
1\. The MC service client within the MC service UE gathers ICE candidates, if
necessary (e.g. depending on the information that needs to be updated).
2\. The MC service client within the MC service UE sends a request to the MC
service server to modify a pre-established session.
3\. MC service server performs necessary service control, obtains any
necessary media parameters (e.g. by means of interacting with a media
distribution function of the MC service server) and gathers necessary ICE
candidates.
4\. MC service server sends a modify pre-establish session response to the MC
service client within the MC service UE.
5\. If necessary, ICE candidate pair checks take place e.g. between the MC
service client within the MC service UE and a media distribution function of
the MC service server.
6\. If necessary the MC service client within the MC service UE sends a modify
pre-established session request to the MC service server to update the ICE
candidate pair for the pre-established session.
7\. The MC service server sends a modify pre-established session response
accepting the ICE candidate pair update.
NOTE 1: The represented procedure corresponds to a session modification
initiated by the MC service client. It can also be initiated by the MC service
server.
NOTE 2: The procedure can also be used to switch a media session from the
inactive to the active state and the reverse. The modification of the session
triggers a corresponding modification of the characteristics (e.g. activity,
bandwidth) of the corresponding GBR bearers.
#### 10.3.2.4 Pre-established session release
Figure 10.3.2.4-1 represents the MC service client within the MC service UE
initiated pre-established session release flow and figure 10.3.2.4-2
represents the MC service server initiated pre-established session release
flow.
Figure 10.3.2.4-1: MC service client within the MC service UE initiated pre-
established session release
1\. The MC service client within the MC service UE sends a request to the MC
service server to release a pre-established session.
2\. The MC service server sends a release pre-establish session response to
the MC service client within the MC service UE.
3\. The MC service server releases all resources for the pre-established
session.
Figure 10.3.2.4-2: MC service server initiated pre-established session release
1\. The MC service server sends a request to the MC service client within the
MC service UE to release a pre-established session.
2\. The MC service client within the MC service UE sends a release pre-
establish session response to the MC service server.
3\. The MC service server releases all resources for the pre-established
session.
## 10.4 Simultaneous session (on-network)
### 10.4.1 General
A simultaneous session is functionality whereby the MC service client can
receive the media from multiple MC service calls/sessions over the same SIP
session and media bearer(s) between the MC service client and the MC service
server.
## 10.5 Use of UE-to-network relay
### 10.5.1 UE-to-network relay service authorization
The MC service shall support the capability for UE-to-network relay to
restrict the relayed group communication on a per group basis.
To meet the above requirement, ProSe (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14]) can
be used with an appropriate relay service code as per the following:
\- To restrict connection from only the membership of allowed MC service
groups, UE-to-network relay UE is provisioned with relay service code(s)
associated with allowed MC service group(s). The UE-to-network relay performs
the access control as follows:
1) The UE broadcasts which MC service group(s) is/are authorized to connect to
the network over this UE-to-network relay by including the related relay
service code(s) in the UE-to-Network Relay Discovery Announcement message (as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14]); or
2) The UE determines whether to respond to a remote UE\'s broadcasting message
by checking if the relay service code carried in the UE-to-Network Relay
Discovery Solicitation message is within the list of allowed relay service
codes.
\- To find a permitted UE-to-network relay, a remote UE is provisioned with
the relay service code(s) associated MC service group(s) which the MC service
user belongs to. The remote UE performs the UE-to-network relay selection as
follows:
1) The remote UE determines if it is allowed to connect to a particular UE-to-
network relay by checking whether the relay service code(s) associated with
its MC service group(s) is/are carried in UE-to-Network Relay Discovery
Announcement message (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14]; or
2) The remote UE includes the relay service code(s) associated with its MC
service group(s) in Network Relay Discovery Solicitation message (as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14]).
### 10.5.2 UE-to-network relay MC service
The ProSe UE-to-network relay provides a purely layer 3 IP data routing
service, when the remote UE loses the coverage of cellular network and the MC
service user on the remote UE requires to access the MC service via a ProSe
UE-to-network relay.
The application layer signalling for the MC service user on a remote UE are
identical to the application layer signalling for the MC service user on an on
network UE.
## 10.6 General user authentication and authorization for MC services
NOTE: Figure 10.6-1 is a high level user authentication and authorization
flow. 3GPP TS 33.180 [25] defines the specific user authentication and
authorization architecture required by the MC services in order to realize the
MC service user authentication and authorization requirements as defined in
3GPP TS 22.280 [3].
The user authentication process shown in figure 10.6-1 may take place in some
scenarios as a separate step independently from a SIP registration phase, for
example if the SIP core is outside the domain of the MC service server.
A procedure for user authentication is illustrated in figure 10.6-1. Other
alternatives may be possible, such as authenticating the user within the SIP
registration phase.
Figure 10.6-1: MC service user authentication and registration, single domain
1\. In this step the identity management client begins the user authorization
procedure. The MC service user supplies the user credentials (e.g. biometrics,
secureID, username/password) for verification with the identity management
server. This step may occur before or after step 3. In a MC system with
multiple MC services, a single user authentication as in step 1 can be used
for multiple MC service authorizations for the user.
2\. The signalling user agent establishes a secure connection to the SIP core
for the purpose of SIP level authentication and registration.
3\. The signalling user agent completes the SIP level registration with the
SIP core (and an optional third-party registration with the MC service
server(s)).
NOTE: The MC service client(s) perform the corresponding MC service
authorization for the user by utilizing the result of this procedure.
## 10.7 Use of MBMS transmission
### 10.7.1 General
This subclause defines information flows and procedures for MBMS usage that
applies to MC services. MBMS bearers can be used by any MC service for any MC
service group. A single MBMS bearer can be used for one or more MC services
within a single group or by multiple group communications in parallel.
The following subclauses specify the procedures and information flows for the
usage of MBMS transmission that are utilised by the following MC services:
\- MCPTT (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]);
\- MCVideo (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]); and
\- MCData (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]).
MC service specific pre-requisites and resultant behaviour by functional
entities in performing these procedures are specified in the respective MC
service TSs as listed above.

### 10.7.3 Procedures for MBMS usage
Editor\'s note: The procedures defined in this subclause are utilized by each
MC service servers individually. It is FFS if the use of MBMS bearer(s) can be
managed by a centralized MBMS management server.
#### 10.7.3.1 Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
##### 10.7.3.1.1 General
In this scenario, the MC service server pre-establishes MBMS bearer(s) in
certain pre-configured areas before the initiation of the group communication
session. When a user originates a request for a group communication session
for one of these areas, the pre-established MBMS bearer(s) is used for the DL
media transmission.
The following steps needs to be performed prior the start of the MC group
communication session over pre-established MBMS bearer:
\- MBMS bearer(s) is Pre-established
\- Announce the pre-established MBMS bearer to the MC service clients
When these preparation steps have been done the MC group communication session
using MBMS bearer can start.
Both the media packets as well as the application level control signalling
(e.g. floor control messages) to the receiving MC service clients are sent on
the MBMS bearer. Optionally a separate MBMS bearer could be used for the
application level control messages, due to different bearer characteristic
requirements.
##### 10.7.3.1.2 Procedure
The procedure figure 10.7.3.1.2-1 shows only one of the receiving MC service
clients using an MBMS bearer. There might also be MC service clients in the
same MC group communication session that receive the communication on unicast
bearers.
Pre-conditions:
\- The participating users are already affiliated.
Figure 10.7.3.1.2-1: Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
1a. The MC service server determines to activate MBMS bearer. The activation
of the MBMS bearer is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP
TS 23.468 [18]. This bearer will be used for the MC communication media.
1b. Optionally, the MC service server may also activate an MBMS bearer
dedicated for application level control signalling. The activation of the MBMS
bearer is done on MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].
NOTE 1: The procedure to determine the activation of MBMS bearers is
implementation specific.
2a. The MC service server passes the MBMS bearer info for the service
description associated with the pre-established MBMS bearer to the MC service
client. The MC service client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer,
from the service description.
2b. The MC service server may pass the MBMS bearer info for the service
description associated with the pre-established floor control MBMS bearer to
the MC service client. The MC service client obtains the TMGI, identifying the
MBMS bearer, from the service description.
NOTE 2: Step 2a and Step 2b can be done in one MBMS bearer announcement
message.
3\. The MC service client stores the information associated with the TMGI(s).
The MC service client uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information
to activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer by the MC service UE.
4\. The MC service client that enters or is in the service area of at least
one announced TMGI indicates to the MC service server that the MC service
client is able to receive media over MBMS, whereby the MC service server may
decide to use the MBMS bearer instead of unicast bearer for MC communication
sessions.
NOTE 3: Step 4 is optional for the MC service UE on subsequent MBMS bearer
announcements.
5\. An MC service group communication session is established.
6\. As the MC service server transmits the media over the MBMS bearer, the
media packets are detected and delivered to the MC service client.
#### 10.7.3.2 Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
In this scenario depicted in figure 10.7.3.2-1, the MC service server uses a
unicast bearer for communication with the UE on the DL at the start of the
group communication session. When the MC service server decides to use an MBMS
bearer for the DL media transmission, the MC service server establishes an
MBMS bearer using the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [18]. The MC
service server provides MBMS service description information associated with
MBMS bearer(s), obtained from the BM-SC, to the UE. The UE starts using the
MBMS bearer(s) to receive DL media and stops using the unicast bearer for the
DL media transmission.
NOTE 1: The MC service server logic for determining when to establish the new
MBMS delivery bearer is implementation specific. For example, the MC service
server could decide to establish the MBMS delivery based on the location of
the UE\'s that are a part of the group communication session.
Figure 10.7.3.2-1: Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
1\. An MC service group communication session is established.
2\. The downlink data is sent by unicast delivery.
3\. The MC service server establishes the MBMS bearer(s) for the group
communication session according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468
[18]. Service description associated with the MBMS bearer(s) is returned from
The BM-SC.
4\. The MC service server provides service description information associated
with the MBMS bearer to the UE. The MC service UE obtains the TMGI from the
announcement message. This message may be sent on an application level control
signalling bearer.
5\. The MC service UE starts monitoring data over MBMS associated with the
TMGI, while in the service area associated with the TMGI.
6\. The MC service UE detects that it is able to receive data over MBMS
associated with the TMGI.
7\. The MC service client notifies the MC service server that it is
successfully receiving the TMGI. MC service server stops sending media data
over unicast way to the MC service client.
8\. An MC service group communication session via dynamic MBMS bearer(s) is
established.
NOTE 2: Step 8 can occur before step 7.
9\. MC service server sends the downlink media for the group communication
session over the MBMS.
#### 10.7.3.3 Switching from MBMS bearer to unicast bearer
Figure 10.7.3.3-1 shows the procedure for service continuity when a UE is
about to move out of MBMS coverage by switching from MBMS bearer to unicast
bearer.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that the MBMS bearer has been activated by MC service server
for downlink delivery.
Figure 10.7.3.3-1: Switching from MBMS delivery to unicast delivery
1\. The MC service UE detects that it suffers from bad MBMS bearer condition
for the corresponding MBMS service. The method to detect is implementation
specific.
2\. The MC service client notifies the MC service server that it suffers from
bad MBMS bearer condition for the corresponding MBMS service by sending the
MBMS listening status report.
3\. The MC service server sends the downlink data by unicast delivery to the
MC service client.
NOTE: The unicast bearer may be set up on demand after step 2 or before.
4\. During the switching, the MC service client simultaneously receives
downlink data through both unicast bearer and MBMS bearer. If there is no
downlink data to the MC service client, this step can be skipped.
5\. The MC service client ceases to receive the downlink data through MBMS
bearer but continues receiving data through unicast bearer.
#### 10.7.3.4 Use of MBMS bearer for application level control signalling
##### 10.7.3.4.1 Description
The MC service server may use an MBMS bearer for application level control
signalling, according to this subclause. An MBMS bearer for application level
control signalling is typically used for the purposes beyond the benefit for
using MBMS for resource efficiency, e.g. for improved MC service performance
(KPIs), handling of high load scenarios.
The MBMS bearer for application level control signalling may be used to
transmit the following messages:
> \- Transmission control (e.g. call setup and floor control)
>
> \- MBMS bearer announcement for media bearers
>
> \- Group application paging
>
> \- Group configuration
>
> \- Group state (e.g. emergency alerts)
An MBMS bearer for application level control signalling is activated in a
service area that is larger than the estimated service for media bearers. The
service area for the media bearers mainly based on counting of group members
in each defined service area. The MBMS bearer for application level control
signalling is also activated with a QoS that is better than MBMS media bearers
since the packet loss requirements are much stricter.
##### 10.7.3.4.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 10.7.3.4.2-1 shows only one of the receiving MC
service clients using an MBMS bearer.
Figure 10.7.3.4.2-1: Use of MBMS bearer for application level control
signalling
1\. The MC service server determines to activate MBMS bearer for application
level control signalling, The activation of the MBMS bearer is done on the
MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].
2\. The MC service server passes the MBMS bearer info for the service
description associated MBMS bearer to the MC service client. The MC service
client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service
description.
3\. The MC service client stores the information associated with the TMGI. The
MC service client uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information to
activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer by the MC service UE.
4\. The MC service client that enters or is in the service area of the
announced TMGI indicates to the MC service server that the MC service client
is able to receive application level control messages over the MBMS bearer,
whereby the MC service server may decide to use the MBMS bearer for MC
application control messages.
5\. The MC service server transmit MC application control messages
#### 10.7.3.5 MBMS bearer announcement over MBMS bearer
##### 10.7.3.5.1 Description
The MBMS announcement may be done on either a unicast bearer or a MBMS bearer.
Using a unicast bearer for MBMS bearer announcement provides an interactive
way of doing announcement. The MC service server will send the MBMS bearer
announcement message to the MC service client regardless if there is an MBMS
bearer active or the MC service client can receive the data on the MBMS bearer
with sufficient quality. The benefit of the existing procedure is that it
gives a secure way to inform the MC service client about the MBMS bearer and
how to retrieve the data on the MBMS bearer.
When there is more than one MBMS bearer active in the same service area for MC
service, there are not the same reasons to use unicast bearer for additional
MBMS bearer announcement. Instead a MBMS bearer for application level control
signalling can be used to announce additional MBMS bearers.
The MBMS bearer announcement messages are sent on an MBMS bearer used for
application control messages. This bearer will have a different QoS setting
compared to an MBMS bearer used for media, since application signalling
messages are more sensitive to packet loss.
##### 10.7.3.5.2 Procedure
The procedure defined below enables the MC service to announcement a new MBMS
bearer.
Pre-conditions:
\- An MBMS bearer used for MC service application control messages must have
been pre-established and announced to the MC service client.
\- Additional MBMS bearer information may have already been announced to the
client.
Figure 10.7.3.5.2-1: MBMS bearer announcement over an MBMS bearer used for
application control messages
1\. The MC service client monitors an MBMS bearer that is used for MC service
application signalling messages, such as bearer announcement messages.
2\. The MC service server activates a new MBMS bearer.
3\. The MC service server announce the MBMS bearer to the MC service client.
The bearer may have just been activated or may have already been running for
some time. The step may be repeated as needed.
4\. The MC service server sends a MBMS bearer announcement on the MBMS bearer
used for MC application control messages. The MBMS bearer announcement
contains the identity of the MBMS bearer (i.e. the TMGI) and may optionally
include additional information about the newly announced bearer. Required and
optional MBMS bearer announcement details may have already been provided. In
this case the MBMS bearer identity could be used as a key for such MBMS bearer
details.
5\. The MC service clients start to monitor the newly announced MBMS bearer.
6\. If requested by the MC service server, the MC service client sends an
acknowledgement of the MBMS bearer to the MC service server.
7\. The MC service server de-announce the MBMS bearer.
8\. The MC service server sends a MBMS bearer de-announcement message that
contains the identity of the MBMS bearer.
9\. The MC service client stops monitoring the de-announced MBMS bearer.
The same procedure can also be used to modify existing MBMS bearer
announcement information. Example of such modification could be addition of
UDP ports or modification of codec in the SDP.
#### 10.7.3.6 MBMS bearer quality detection
##### 10.7.3.6.1 Description
The MC service client and MC service server use this procedure to report and
take action on the MBMS bearer quality. An MC service client monitors an MBMS
bearer to receive MC service media. Based on the received quality (e.g. radio
level quality, transport level quality), the MC service client needs to inform
the MC service server that the MC service client is able to receive the MC
service media on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality or not able to
receive the MC service media on the MBMS bearer with sufficient quality.
The issue can be more complex since the MC service client needs to estimate
the quality of the bearer even in the scenario when there are no data
currently transmitted on the MBMS bearer (e.g. between MCPTT group call). The
reason for this is that an MC service client that has entered an area with
significantly degraded MBMS quality, might not even notice that an MC service
communication is ongoing, meanwhile the MC server still assumes that the MC
service client can receive the media being broadcasted.
To estimate the MBMS bearer quality, for example as an equivalent BLER (Block
Error Rate) when no data is sent is implementation specific. This estimation
is dependent on for example the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and
measurements from the reference signals from the eNB(s). Other metrics (e.g.
RTP packet loss) may be used to estimate the MBMS bearer quality.
##### 10.7.3.6.2 Procedure
The MC service client shall indicate the ability of the MC service client to
receive the MBMS bearer.
Pre-conditions:
\- There is an MBMS bearer activated and the MBMS bearer information is
announced to the MC service client
\- The MC service client is located in the MBMS broadcasting area
\- The MC service UE monitors SIB-13 (or SIB-20) and (SC-)MCCH to receive the
modulation and coding scheme
\- The MC service UE monitors the cell specific reference signal and when
MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN specific reference signals
Figure 10.7.3.6.2-1: MBMS bearer quality detection
1\. The MC service client determines that the MBMS bearer quality shall be
reported to the MC service server. The MC service client may determine the
MBMS bearer quality by using the BLER of the received data. When no data is
received, the quality estimation should consider the reference signals and the
modulation and coding scheme (MCS). The UE may also use predictive methods to
estimate the expected MBMS bearer quality (e.g. speed and direction) to
proactively inform the MBMS service server of an expected loss of the MBMS
bearer quality.
NOTE 1: When MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN reference signal needs to
be used and when SC-PTM is used the cell specific reference signal needs to be
used. With the measured reference signal, the reference signal received
quality (RSRQ) can be calculated.
2\. If the MBMS bearer quality reaches a certain threshold, the MC service
client sends an MBMS listening status report. The threshold used indicates
that the MBMS bearer is not acceptable for MC services.
NOTE 2: Prior sending the MBMS listening status report, it could be beneficial
to also include information for different alternatives e.g. another MBMS
bearer might have better quality and could be a better option than a transfer
of the communication to unicast.
NOTE 3: The threshold used to indicate MBMS bearer quality depends on service
type (i.e. MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData) and the metrics used. The metrics used
and the associated thresholds are out of scope of this specification.
3\. The MC service server may send additional proposal for measurements e.g.
information about neighbouring MBMS bearers. This message may be an MBMS
bearer announcement message.
#### 10.7.3.7 Service continuity in MBMS scenarios
##### 10.7.3.7.1 General
This subclause specify service continuity scenario when MBMS bearers are used.
There are different solutions for different scenarios.
##### 10.7.3.7.2 Service continuity when moving from one MBSFN to another
The service continuity solution described in this subclause is suitable in the
scenario when multiple MBMS bearers are used with the purpose to cover a
larger area. In mission critical communication several media streams may be
multiplexed in one MBMS bearer. Furthermore, one media stream (e.g. MCPTT
group call) may be sent on more than one MBMS bearer if the receiving users
are distributed over more than one MBMS service area. An MC service client
that is interested in receiving a media stream that is broadcasted in both
MBMS bearers is a candidate for this service continuity procedure.
Figure 10.7.3.7.2-1 illustrates a deployment scenario that provides service
continuity between two MBSFN areas. Two different MBMS bearers are activated
(TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), the activation of the bearers is done in the two MBSFN
areas (MBSFN 1 and MBSFN 2). The MBSFN areas 1 and 2 are partially
overlapping, meaning that some transmitting cells belong to both MBSFN area 1
and MBSFN area 2.
Figure 10.7.3.7.2-1: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas
The procedural steps will work as follows:
1\. The UE is located in MBSFN 1 and can listen to TMGI 1. No additional MBMS
bearers that the MC service client is interested in are active in the current
cell.
2\. The UE moves into a new cell in which both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2 are active.
This cell is part of both MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2, and broadcast the
same service on both TMGIs. After some seconds the UE detects the new MBMS
bearer and detects that TMGI 2 broadcasts the same service. The UE may now
listen to both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2 and receive duplicated packets. The MC
service client must also verify that it is the same content sent on both
bearers. The duplicated packets may also be used to perform error corrections.
NOTE: It is assumed that both MBMS bearers are announcement to the MC service
client, and the MC service UE listen to SIB-13 and (SC-)MCCH to detect these
MBMS bearers.
3\. The UE moves into a new cell in which only TMGI 2 is active.
This service continuity procedure mitigates the risk of packet loss that may
occur if the UE would request to transfer the media stream to a unicast bearer
when moving into the new area and then back to a multicast bearer when the UE
can listen to TMGI 2. However, it is still required that the MC service client
sends a location report (and MBMS listening report), which means that a
unicast bearer is needed. The location report from the MC service client is
required, since the MC service server must know that the UE has entered a new
area and can only listen to MBMS bearer active in that area. If this is not
done the MC service server might send a media stream that the MC service
client is required to listen to on the MBMS bearer 1, since the MC service
server still assumes that the UE is located in the MBSFN area 1.
The solution can be improved as illustrated in figure 10.7.3.7.2-2. In this
case two different MBMS bearers are activated (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), these MBMS
bearers are used only for media. An application level signalling bearer is
activated (TMGI 9), in both MBSFN areas. This bearer is used for floor control
messages and other application level signalling messages that are sent on the
MBMS bearer TMGI 9. A similar concept was already introduced in 3GPP TS 23.179
[7] subclause 10.10.2, where the procedure allowed a separate MBMS bearer for
floor control signalling. The application level signalling bearer will be used
for all control messages needed for both media MBMS bearer (TMGI 1 and TMGI2).
By using an application level signalling bearer (e.g. TMGI 9) the MC service
clients can receive floor control messages for all calls going on in the areas
of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. A MC service client that is located in the area of
TMGI 2 and is interested in a MCPTT group call transmission only going on in
TMGI 1, can with the information received in TMGI 9 initiate a unicast bearer
and request to receive that specific call over a unicast instead. Without the
information received over TMGI 9 the MC service client must immediately report
that the MC service client has left the broadcast area that the MC service
server assumes that the MC service client is located in. With the use of TMGI
9 there is no immediate need for the MC service client to inform the MC
service server of a location change.
Figure 10.7.3.7.2-2: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas with a
separate MC application signalling bearer
The procedural steps in this scenario will be the same as described above in
this subclause. However, in this scenario the MC service client is not
required to initiate a unicast bearer to send location report (or MBMS
listening report). The UE may move between the two MBMS bearers (TMGI 1 and
TMGI 2) without the need to report an area change. A condition for this to
work is that there is an application level signalling bearer (TMGI 9)
activated in the full area (i.e. the area of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2). The TMGI
9 will broadcast all floor control messages for all calls ongoing in both
areas. If the UE is in coverage of one of the two MBMS bearers that does not
transmit the media of interest the UE can report to the server that it is not
able to listen to the media over the MBMS bearer, which triggers the server to
use a unicast bearer instead.
##### 10.7.3.7.3 Service continuity with a UE-to-Network relay
This procedure handles a scenario when UE is moving from a location when the
UE is experiencing good reception of the MBMS bearer to a location outside the
MBMS service coverage. The MC service client apply a service continuity
procedure to ensure that the service can be maintained and that the packet
loss can be minimized during transition to a UE-to-Network relay connection.
The solution also provides the benefit that it offloads the cell when UEs that
normally would trigger a transfer from MBMS bearers to unicast bearers when
moving outside the MBMS coverage area.
Figure 10.7.3.7.3-1 below illustrates the concept of this procedure. In the
figure UE A (with the MC service client) is first within the MBMS coverage
(the far right most location). The MBMS coverage is represented by the dashed
circle. The UE A is the moving outside the MBMS coverage and first enters a
location in which the MBMS signal is not good enough, but in this location
there is still coverage to use unicast bearers. Unicast bearers use link
adaption and retransmission so the coverage area for unicast bearers is larger
than the coverage of the MBMS bearers. The solid circle outer line represents
the coverage of the unicast bearer.
A UE that is leaving the area of MBMS coverage may in this scenario trigger a
ProSe discovery procedure to initiate the establishment a relay communication
path to UE-R. A UE that is receiving media over an MBMS bearer (and is in idle
mode) and for the moment does not need a unicast bearer is costly (from a
resource efficiency point of view) to transfer to a unicast bearer due to the
need for retransmissions and robust coding in the outer part of cell.
When the ProSe communication path is established the UE A may continue to
receive the media over the relay UE-R.
Figure 10.7.3.7.3-1: UE A is moving from a position in MBMS coverage to
outside the network coverage passing an area where only unicast is possible
The procedure defined in this subclause allows for MBMS bearer service
continuity when UE is moving from a MBMS coverage area to outside the MBMS
coverage area. The procedure applies when the UE is not finding a target cell
with good RSRP/RSRQ (receiving strong reference signals from other cells),
which could trigger normal cell reselection procedure. In such scenario other
aspects should be evaluated to trigger to a relay communication path.
Pre-conditions:
  * The MC service client UE is not using a unicast bearer when this procedure applies.
Figure 10.7.3.7.3-2: Service continuity over MBMS bearer using UE-to-network
relay
1\. The MC service client estimate the MBMS bearer quality. The MC service
clients also measure the reference signals from other cells to estimate the
possibilities to transfer to unicast and perform a cell reselection procedure.
2\. If the MBMS bearer quality has reach a certain threshold the MC service
client performs ProSe UE-to-network relay discovery over PC5 and establishes a
secure point-to-point link with the relay (UE-R) over PC5. As part of this
process the remote UE is mutually authenticated at PC5 layer with either the
relay or with the network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14].
3\. Normal service continuity procedure for a UE-to-network relay. This may be
done according to annex B.
4\. The MC service client informs the UE-R about the reception of media over
the MBMS bearer. This includes sending the TMGIs, MBMS SAIs and ProSe per
packet priority to the UE-R. This procedure is specified in 3GPP TS 23.303
[14].
5\. The UE-R will relay the MBMS media using one-to-many ProSe Direct
Communication. The UE-R may also relay requests to transfer the media flow
from multicast to unicast and vice versa.
#### 10.7.3.8 MBMS suspension notification
##### 10.7.3.8.1 Description
In this procedure the MC sevice client is requested by the MC service server
to send a MBMS suspension report. This request for MBMS suspension report can
be included in the MBMS bearer announcement and the MC service server may
choose to only send this request for MBMS suspension report to a subset of all
MC service clients.
##### 10.7.3.8.2 Procedure
The information flow below defines a procedure in which the MC service client
notifies the MC service server about an MBMS suspension decision in RAN.
The MC service server can decide on a subset of all UE\'s in the MBMS
broadcast area that shall report on MBMS bearer suspension. When the MC
service server make the decision of the UE subset, consideration shall be
taken to the location of the UEs, since UEs location is dynamically changed.
This means that the MBMS suspension reporting instruction may need to be
updated regularly based on the UEs mobility.
Pre-conditions:
\- It is assumed that there is at least one active MBMS bearer
Figure 10.7.3.8.2-1: MBMS suspension notification from MC service client
1\. The MC service server sends an MBMS suspension reporting instruction to
the MC service client.
NOTE: This message may be included in the MBMS bearer announcement message and
may be sent both on a unicast bearer and a multicast bearer.
2\. RAN decides to suspend the MBMS bearer, according to existing procedures
in 3GPP TS 36.300 [21].
3\. An MBMS suspension indication is sent in the MSI (MCH Scheduling
Information), according to existing procedures in 3GPP TS 36.300 [21].
4\. The MC service client detect the MBMS suspension and sends an MBMS
suspension report.
MC service client that is not instructed to send an MBMS suspension report
shall still detect the MBMS suspension indication from RAN (step 3). An MC
service client shall in this case not send other types of report (e.g. MBMS
listening reports).
The same procedure can be applied at MBMS resumption or other MBMS events that
may be detected by the MC service client.
#### 10.7.3.9 Multi-server bearer coordination
##### 10.7.3.9.1 General
To avoid allocating duplicate bearers for an MBMS service area, a single MC
service server manages all the MBMS media transmission for all groups and
users within a particular MBMS service area. An MC service server controlling
the MBMS bearer has the MBMS bearer controlling role. Different MC service
servers may allocate bearers as needed and make them available for other MC
service servers to use.
NOTE: For a single call, multiple MC service servers (participating role)
might be involved. Multiple MBMS service areas might have sufficient MC
service group members to warrant multiple MBMS bearers to be used and
therefore multiple MC service servers (MBMS bearer controlling role) might be
involved. For brevity, this clause only illustrates the simplest case.
##### 10.7.3.9.2 Procedures
NOTE 1: This procedure is not fully specified in this version of the document.
Pre-conditions:
\- All MC service servers are configured with the contact information of those
MC service servers that have, or in the case of dynamic bearer allocation,
might make MBMS bearers available for use by other MC service servers.
Figure 10.7.3.9.2-1: Multiple server MBMS procedure
1\. MC service client 1 affiliates to an MC service group hosted on an MC
service server 2 (controlling role) via MC service client 1\'s MC service
server 1 (participating role).
2\. MC service client 2 initiates a group call on an MC service group owned by
the MC service server 2 (controlling role).
3\. The MC service server 2 (controlling role) calculates whether multicast is
desired for each service area in which MC service group members are located,
based upon the locations, affiliation status and other factors of the MC
service group members.
Editor\'s note: How the MC service server (controlling role) obtains the
location information for the MC service clients is FFS.
Editor\'s note: How the MC service server (controlling role) obtains the
listening reports from the MC service clients is FFS.
Editor\'s note: How the bearer announcement is sent is FFS.
4\. The MC service server 2 (controlling role) determines whether another MC
service server has already established a bearer with coverage for the MBMS
service area where multicast is desired. To do this, the MC service server 2
(controlling role) consults a pre-configured list of MC service servers and
sends them a discover bearer request.
NOTE 2: The MC service server which has the MBMS bearer controlling role need
not have a participating or controlling role on the call.
NOTE 3: For a single call, multiple MC service servers (participating role)
might be involved, multiple MBMS service areas might have sufficient MC
service group members to warrant multiple MBMS bearers to be used and
therefore multiple MC service servers (in the MBMS bearer controlling role)
might be involved. For brevity, this clause only illustrates the simplest
case.
NOTE 4: MC service servers of the same type can be configured to discover
bearers from a single server. The single server then becomes a centralized
MBMS bearer controller for the MC service. Similarly, all MC service servers
of all types can be configured to discover bearers from a single server. The
single server then becomes a centralized MBMS bearer controller for all MC
services.
Editor\'s note: How the MC service servers identify and route messages to
other MC service servers is FFS.
5\. The MC service server 3 (MBMS bearer controlling role) responds with a
discover bearer response indicating whether there is available bandwidth for
the desired bearer. If the bearer of interest has insufficient bandwidth, the
polling MC service server 2 may resort to unicast, or may allocate another
bearer for the congested area. If a duplicate bearer is allocated for the same
area, the bearer should not be shared with other servers and may be torn down
as soon as the congestion on the original bearer clears up, in order to
conserve resources.
> For any MBMS service areas not covered by another MC service server, the MC
> service server 2 (controlling role) prepares to distribute media to those
> MBMS service areas via multicast by setting up a bearer. The bearer set up
> by the MC service server 2 (controlling role) may then become available for
> other MC service servers (controlling role) for other MC service groups.
6\. The MC service server 2 (controlling role) sends a media distribution
request to the MC service server 3 (MBMS bearer controlling role). Information
about the call is included so that the MC service server 3 (MBMS bearer
controlling role) can send a MapGroupToBearer request on the MBMS bearer to
the clients.
7\. MC service server 3 (MBMS bearer controlling role) sends a media
distribution response to the MC service server 2 (controlling role) indicating
whether the request can be supported and supplies details about the bearer.
8\. The MC service server 2 (controlling role) informs the MC service server 1
(participating role) of the MC service clients that will be receiving
multicast, so that the MC service servers 1 (participating role) need not send
via unicast the media to those MC service clients.
9\. The MC service server 3 (MBMS bearer controlling role) establishes a group
communication session via the bearer, informing MBMS connected MC service
clients 1 and 2 that a call is about to start on the MBMS bearer. This step is
equivalent to MapGroupToBearer in MCPTT.
10\. MC service client 2 sends media on the uplink to the MC service server 2
(controlling role). This step is not dependent upon receipt of the
MapGroupToBearer request by MC service client 2.
11\. The MC service server 2 (controlling role) forwards the media to MC
service server 1 (participating role) so that they can unicast to their
affiliated MC service group members that are not MBMS connected or are out of
the MBMS service area receiving the broadcast. The MC service server 2
(controlling role) also forwards the media to the MC service server 3 (MBMS
bearer controlling role).
12\. The MC service server 3 (MBMS bearer controlling role) distributes the
media to MBMS served MC service client 1 via multicast.
Editor\'s note: Whether the controlling server can send the media directly on
MB2U is FFS.
13\. At some point later, the group call ends.
14\. The MC service server 2 (controlling role) sends a remove call from
bearer request, informing the MC service server 3 (MBMB bearer controlling
role) to remove the call from the MBMS bearer.
15\. The MC service server 3 (MBMS bearer controlling role) removes the group
communication session from the bearer. This step is equivalent to
UnMapGroupToBearerRequest in MCPTT.
16\. The MC service server 3 (MBMS bearer controlling role) may deallocate the
MBMS bearer if it has no other calls using the bearer and is configured to
allocate and deallocate bearers dynamically as needed.

### 10.8.3 Affiliation
#### 10.8.3.1 MC service group affiliation procedure
Procedure for affiliation to MC service group(s) for a single MC service is
described in figure 10.8.3.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service client has already been provisioned (statically or dynamically)
with the group information, or a pointer to the group information, that the MC
service client is allowed to be affiliated.
2\. MC service server may have retrieved the user subscription and group
policy e.g. which user(s) are authorized to affiliate to what MC service
group(s), priority, and other configuration data.
3\. MC service client may have indicated to the group management server that
it wishes to receive updates of group configuration data for MC service
groups(s) for which it is authorized (as described in subclause 10.1.5.3).
4\. The MC service client triggers the affiliation procedure. This is an
explicit affiliation caused either by the MC service user or determined by a
trigger event such as the MC service UE coming within a permitted geographic
operational area of an MC service group.
Figure 10.8.3.1-1: MC service group affiliation procedure
1\. MC service client of the MC service user requests the MC service server to
affiliate to an MC service group or a set of MC service groups.
2a. MC service server checks if the group policy is locally cached. If the
group policy is not locally cached on the MC service server then MC service
server requests the group policy from the group management server.
2b. MC service server receives the group policy from the group management
server.
3\. Based on the group policy and user subscription, the MC service server
checks if the MC service group(s) is enabled and if the MC service client is
authorised to affiliate to the requested MC service group(s). The MC service
server also performs the check for the maximum limit of the total number (N2)
of MC service groups that the user can be affiliated to simultaneously.
4\. If the user of the MC service client is authorised to affiliate to the
requested MC service group(s) then the MC service server stores the
affiliation status of the user for the requested MC service group(s).
5\. MC service server confirms to the MC service client the affiliation (5a)
and updates the group management server with the affiliation status of the
user for the requested MC service group(s) (5b).
NOTE: Steps 5a and 5b can occur in any order or in parallel.
#### 10.8.3.2 Affiliation to MC service group(s) defined in partner MC service
system
##### 10.8.3.2.1 Functional description
When an MC service client wants to affiliate to MC service group(s) which is
defined in a partner MC service system for a single MC service, it shall be
subject to authorization from the partner MC service system where the MC
service group(s) is defined, and whether it subjects to authorization from the
primary MC service system is conditional.
##### 10.8.3.2.2 Procedure
The procedure for affiliation to MC service group(s) which is defined in a
partner MC service system for a single MC service is described in figure
10.8.3.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service client has already been provisioned (statically or
dynamically) with the group information, or a pointer to the group
information, that the MC service client is allowed to be affiliated.
2\. The MC service server of the primary MC service system may have locally
cached the MC service group affiliation status of the MC service user.
3\. The MC service server of the partner MC service system may have retrieved
the group related information from the group management server.
4\. The MC service client may have indicated to the group management server of
the partner MC service system that it wishes to receive updates of group
configuration data for MC service group(s) for which it is authorized (as
described in subclause 10.1.5.3).
5\. The MC service user triggers the affiliation procedure. This is an
explicit affiliation caused by the MC service user.
Figure 10.8.3.2.2-1: Affiliation for an MC service group defined in partner MC
service system
1\. The MC service client requests the MC service server of the primary MC
service system to affiliate to an MC service group or a set of MC service
groups.
2\. The MC service server of the primary MC service system checks if the MC
service client is authorized to affiliate to the requested MC service group(s)
based on the user subscription. The MC service server also performs the check
for the maximum limit of the total number (N2) of MC service groups that the
user can be affiliated to simultaneously.
3\. Based on the group information included in the request, the MC service
server of the primary MC service system, it determines to send group
affiliation request to the corresponding MC service server of the partner MC
service system. The request may be routed through intermediate signalling
nodes.
4a. The MC service server of the partner MC service system checks if the group
policy is locally cached. If the group policy is not locally cached on the MC
service server then MC service server subscribes to the group policy from the
group management server.
4b. The MC service server of the partner MC service system receives the group
policy from the group management server via notification and locally caches
the group policy information.
5\. Based on the group policy, the MC service server of the partner MC service
system checks if the MC service group(s) is not disabled and if the user of
the MC service client is authorised to affiliate to the requested MC service
group(s).
6\. If the user of the MC service client is authorised to affiliate to the
requested MC service group(s) then the MC service server of the partner MC
service system stores the affiliation status of the user for the requested MC
service group(s).
7\. The MC service server of the partner MC service system sends the
affiliation status result of requested MC service group(s) to the MC service
server of the primary MC service system (7a) and updates the group management
server with the affiliation status of the user for the requested MC service
group(s) (7b).
NOTE: Steps 7a and 7b can occur in any order or in parallel.
8\. The MC service server of the primary MC service system stores the
affiliation status of the user for the requested MC service group(s).
9\. The MC service server of the primary MC service system sends the group
affiliation status result for the requested MC service group(s) to the MC
service client.
### 10.8.4 De-affiliation from MC service group(s)
#### 10.8.4.1 General
When an MC service user does not want to communicate with an MC service group
anymore for a single MC service, then the MC service user can revoke its
affiliation to the MC service group.
#### 10.8.4.2 MC service group de-affiliation procedure
The procedure for revoking the affiliation with an MC service group for a
single MC service is described in figure 10.8.4.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. MC service server has already subscribed to the MC service group
information from group management server and has stored the data of MC service
group(s) to which the MC service user is affiliated to.
2\. The MC service client triggers the de-affiliation procedure. This is an
explicit de-affiliation requested either by the MC service user or determined
by a trigger event such as the MC service UE moving outside a permitted
geographic operational area of an MC service group.
NOTE: The geographical operational area beyond which de-affiliation occurs may
be larger than the geographical operational area within which affiliation is
permitted, to avoid repeated affiliation and de-affiliation by a user on the
edge of an operational area.
Figure 10.8.4.2-1: MC service group de-affiliation procedure
1\. MC service client requests the MC service server to de-affiliate from an
MC service group or a set of MC service groups.
2\. Based on the user subscription and stored group policy, the MC service
server checks if the user of the MC service client is authorized to de-
affiliate from the requested MC service group(s) and if the user of the MC
service client has affiliated to the requested MC service group(s).
3\. If the user of the MC service client has affiliated to the requested MC
service group(s), is authorized to de-affiliate from the requested MC service
group(s) then the MC service server removes the affiliation status of the user
for the requested MC service group(s).
4\. MC service server provides to the MC service client the group de-
affiliation response (4a) and updates the group management server with the de-
affiliation status of the user for the requested MC service group(s) (4b).
NOTE: Steps 4a and 4b can occur in any order or in parallel.
#### 10.8.4.3 De-affiliation from MC service group(s) defined in partner MC
service system
The procedure for de-affiliation from affiliated MC service group(s) which is
defined in partner MC service system for a single MC service is described in
figure 10.8.4.3-1.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The primary/partner MC service servers have already subscribed to the
group information from group management server and stored the data of MC
service group(s) to which the MC service user intends to de-affiliate.
Figure 10.8.4.3-1: De-affiliation from an MC service group defined in partner
MC service system
1\. The MC service client requests the primary MC service server to de-
affiliate from an MC service group or a set of MC service groups.
2\. The primary MC service server checks if the MC service client is
authorized to de-affiliate from the requested MC service group(s) based on the
user subscription. The primary MC service server performs the check if the
user has affiliated to the MC service groups.
3\. Based on the MC service group information included in the request, the
primary MC service server determines to send MC service group de-affiliation
request to the corresponding partner MC service server. The request may be
routed through some intermediate signalling nodes.
4\. Based on the stored group policy, the partner MC service server checks if
the MC service group is not disabled and if the user of the MC service client
has affiliated to the requested MC service group(s) and is authorized to de-
affiliate from the requested MC service group(s).
5\. If the user of the MC service client has affiliated to the requested MC
service group(s) and is authorized to de-affiliate to the requested MC service
group(s), then the partner MC service server removes the affiliation status of
the user for the requested MC service group(s).
6\. The partner MC service server sends the MC service group de-affiliation
response to primary MC service server (6a) and updates the group management
server with the de-affiliation status of the user for the requested MC service
group(s) (6b).
NOTE: Steps 6a and 6b can occur in any order or in parallel.
7\. The primary MC service server will remove any information stored about the
user\'s affiliation with requested MC service group(s) of partner MC service
system.
8\. The primary MC service server sends the MC service group de-affiliation
response to the MC service client.
### 10.8.5 Remote change of affiliation
#### 10.8.5.1 Remote change of affiliation for groups defined in primary MC
service system
##### 10.8.5.1.1 Authorized user remotely changes another MC service user\'s
affiliated MC service group(s) -- mandatory mode
The procedure for an authorized user to remotely change another MC service
user\'s affiliated MC service group(s) for a single MC service without
requiring the target user\'s approval is described in figure 10.8.5.1.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service client 1 (authorized user 1) has already been provisioned
(statically or dynamically) with the target MC service user\'s information and
its group information, that target MC service user 2 is allowed to be
affiliated or de-affiliated;
\- The primary MC service server may have retrieved the user/group policy e.g.
information regarding user(s) authorization to affiliate or to de-affiliate to
MC service group(s), priority, and other related configuration data.
Figure 10.8.5.1.1-1: Remotely change MC service group affiliation -- mandatory
mode
1\. When an authorized user requires one or more MC service users to change
the affiliation to an MC service group or set of MC service groups, the MC
service client 1 of the authorized user 1 sends MC service group affiliation
change request with the indication of mandatory mode to the primary MC service
server. The information used to indicate the change of the affiliation
relationship between the target MC service user 2 and the MC service group(s)
shall be included.
2\. The primary MC service server shall check if the MC service user 1 is
authorized to initiate the change of the affiliation relationship between the
target user 2 and the MC service group(s). The primary MC service server shall
check if the target MC service user(s) are authorized for the requested
affiliation relationship based on the user subscription. The primary MC
service server also performs the check for the maximum limit on the total
number (N2) of MC service groups that the user can be affiliated to
simultaneously.
3a. The primary MC service server checks if the group policy is locally
cached. If the group policy is not locally cached on the MC service server,
then, the MC service server subscribes to the group policy from the group
management server.
3b. The primary MC service server receives the group policy from the group
management server via notification and locally caches the group policy
information.
4\. Based on the group policy, the primary MC service server checks if the
target MC service user 2 is authorized to affiliate or de-affiliate to the MC
service group(s).
5\. If the target MC service user 2 is authorized to affiliate or de-affiliate
to the MC service group(s) then the primary MC service server stores the new
requested affiliation status of the target MC service user 2 for the MC
service group(s).
6\. If the requested affiliation status is a change from the current
affiliation status, then the primary MC service server updates the group
management server with the affiliation status of the MC service user 2 for the
MC service group(s).
7a. If the requested affiliation status is a change the primary MC service
server sends the MC service group affiliation change request with the
indication of mandatory mode to MC service client 2 of the target MC service
user 2. The target MC service user 2 receives the latest information about the
affiliated MC service groups. The MC service client 2 may subscribe to the
affiliated MC service groups information with the group management server.
7b. The MC service user 2 provides a response to the primary MC service server
by sending an MC service group affiliation change response.
8\. The primary MC service server sends the MC service group affiliation
change response to MC service client 1. If the requested affiliation status
was not changed (see 7a), then the MC service server creates an appropriate
(accept) MC service group affiliation change response to send to MC service
client 1.
NOTE: Steps 6, 7a, 7b and 8 can occur in any order or in parallel, with the
restriction that step 7b can only occur after step 7a occurred.
##### 10.8.5.1.2 Authorized user remotely changes another MC service user\'s
affiliated MC service group(s) -- negotiated mode
The procedure for the authorized user to remotely change another MC service
user\'s affiliated MC service group(s) for a single MC service with the target
MC service user\'s approval is described in figure 10.8.5.1.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service client 1 (authorized user 1) has already been provisioned
(statically or dynamically) with target MC service user\'s information and its
group information, that target MC service user 2 is allowed to be affiliated
or de-affiliated;
\- The primary MC service server may have retrieved the user/group policy e.g.
information regarding user(s) authorization to affiliate or to de-affiliate to
MC service group(s), priority, and other related configuration data.
Figure 10.8.5.1.2-1: Remotely change MC service group affiliation --
negotiated mode
1\. When an authorized user requires one or more MC service users to change
the affiliation to an MC service group or set of MC service groups, the MC
service client 1 of the authorized user 1 sends MC service group affiliation
change request to the primary MC service server. The information (i.e. target
MC service user(s) ID, MC service group(s) ID, requested affiliation status)
used to indicate the change of the affiliation relationship between the target
MC service user 2 and the MC service group(s) shall be included.
2\. The primary MC service server checks if the MC service user 1 is
authorized to initiate the change of the affiliation relationship between the
target user 2 and the MC service group(s). The primary MC service server
checks if the target MC service user(s) are authorized for the requested
affiliation relationship based on the user subscription and the group policy
(i.e. if not available, the primary MC service server obtains the group policy
from the group management server). The primary MC service server also performs
the check for the maximum limit on the total number (N2) of MC service groups
that the user can be affiliated to simultaneously.
3\. If the target MC service user 2 is authorized to accept the changes to its
affiliated MC service group(s), then the primary MC service server sends the
MC service group affiliation change request to the MC service client 2 of the
target MC service user 2.
4\. If the requested affiliation status is different from the current
affiliation status, then the MC service client 2 notifies the MC service group
affiliation change request to the target MC service user 2 to receive the
approval from the user on the proposed changes to the affiliated MC service
group(s).
NOTE 1: The procedure is aborted if the target MC service user 2 does not
respond to the notification within an implementation dependent time.
5\. If the target MC service user 2 provides a response (accept or reject) to
the notification, then the MC service client 2 sends an MC service group
affiliation change response to the primary MC service server. A response
indicating target user 2\'s acceptance to the requested affiliation change by
authorized user 1, triggers the affiliation or de-affiliation procedures at
the primary MC service server (see subclause 10.8.3.1 or subclause 10.8.4.2)
as per the MC service user 1\'s requested changes to the target user 2\'s
affiliated group(s).
NOTE 2: In the case where the affiliation changes for target user 2 includes
MC service groups defined in partner MC service systems, the primary MC
service server performs the affiliation or de-affiliation procedures by
interacting with the partner MC service systems (see subclause 10.8.3.2 or
subclause 10.8.4.3).
6\. The primary MC service server sends the MC service group affiliation
change response to the MC service client 1. If the requested affiliation
status was not changed (see 4), then the MC service server creates an
appropriate (accept) MC service group affiliation change response to send to
MC service client 1.
NOTE 3: If multiple MC service groups are included in step 1, and these MC
service groups belong to different partner MC service systems, the primary MC
service server can wait until all the partner MC service systems provides the
MC service group affiliation change response messages.
#### 10.8.5.2 Remote change of affiliation for groups defined in partner MC
service system
##### 10.8.5.2.1 Authorized user remotely changes another MC service user\'s
affiliated MC service group(s) defined in partner MC service system --
mandatory mode
The procedure for the authorized user to remotely change another MC service
user\'s affiliated MC service group(s) defined in partner MC service systems
for a single MC service without requiring the target user\'s approval is
described in figure 10.8.5.2.1-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service client 1 (authorized user) has already been provisioned
(statically or dynamically) with the target MC service user 2\'s information
and group information, that the target MC service user 2 is allowed to be
affiliated or de-affiliated;
\- The MC service client 1 (authorized user 1), MC service client 2 (target MC
service user 2), and the primary MC service server belong to the same MC
service system;
\- The partner MC service server may have retrieved the group related
information from the group management server; and
\- The primary MC service server may have retrieved the user policy e.g. user
related information regarding user(s) authorization to affiliate or to de-
affiliate to MC service group(s), priority, and other related configuration
data.
Figure 10.8.5.2.1-1: Remote change MC service group affiliation defined in
partner MC service system -- mandatory mode
1\. When an authorized user requires one or more MC service users to change
the affiliation to an MC service group or set of MC service groups, the MC
service client 1 of the authorized user 1 sends MC service group affiliation
change request with the indication of mandatory mode to the primary MC service
server. The information (i.e. target MC service user(s) ID, MC service
group(s) ID, requested affiliation status) used to indicate the change of the
affiliation relationship between the target MC service user 2 and the MC
service group(s) shall be included.
2\. The primary MC service server shall check if the MC service user 1 is
authorized to initiate the change of the affiliation relationship between the
target user 2 and the MC service group(s). The primary MC service server shall
check if the target MC service user(s) are authorized for the requested
affiliation relationship based on the user subscription. The primary MC
service server also performs the check for the maximum limit on the total
number (N2) of MC service groups that the user can be affiliated to
simultaneously.
3\. Based on the MC service group information included in the request, the
primary MC service server determines to send MC service group affiliation
change request to the corresponding partner MC service server (group host
server).
4a. The partner MC service server checks if the group policy is locally
cached. If the group policy is not locally cached on the partner MC service
server then the partner MC service server subscribes to the group policy from
the group management server.
4b. The partner MC service server receives the group policy from the group
management server via notification and locally caches the group policy
information.
5\. Based on the group policy, the partner MC service server checks if the
target MC service user 2 is authorized to affiliate to the MC service
group(s). It is possible that the target MC service user 2 affiliates to one
or more MC service groups and also de-affiliates from one or more MC service
groups.
6\. If the target MC service user 2 is authorized to affiliate or de-affiliate
to the MC service group(s) and if the requested affiliation status is
different to the current affiliation status, then the partner MC service
server stores the new affiliation status of the target MC service user 2 for
the MC service group(s).
7\. The partner MC service server updates the group management server with the
affiliation status of the target MC service user 2 for the MC service
group(s).
8\. The partner MC service server sends the MC service group affiliation
change response to the primary MC service server.
NOTE: Steps 7 and 8 can occur in any order or in parallel.
9\. If the requested affiliation status is different to the current
affiliation status, then the primary MC service server stores the new
affiliation status of the target MC service user 2 for the MC service
group(s).
10a. If the requested affiliation status is different to the current
affiliation status, then the primary MC service server sends the MC service
group affiliation change request with the indication of mandatory mode to MC
service client 2 of the target MC service user 2. The target MC service user 2
receives the latest information about the affiliated MC service groups.
Further the MC service client 2 may subscribe for the affiliated MC service
groups information with the group management server.
10b. The target MC service client 2 provides an MC service group affiliation
change response to the MC service server.
11\. The primary MC service server sends the MC service group affiliation
change response to MC service client 1 (authorized user). If the requested
affiliation status was not changed (see 10a), then the MC service server
creates an appropriate (accept) MC service group affiliation change response
to send to MC service client 1.

### 10.9.3 Procedure
#### 10.9.3.1 Event-triggered location reporting procedure
The location management server provides location reporting configuration to
the location management clients, indicating what information the location
management server expects and what events will trigger the sending of this
information to the location management server. The decision to report location
information can be triggered at the location management client by different
conditions, e.g., the reception of the location reporting configuration,
initial registration, distance travelled, elapsed time, cell change, MBMS SAI
change, MBMS session change, leaving a specific MBMS bearer service area,
tracking area change, PLMN change, call initiation, or other types of events
such as emergency alert, emergency call or imminent peril calls. The location
report can include information described as ECGI, MBMS SAIs, geographic
coordinates and other location information.
Figure 10.9.3.1-1: Event-triggered location reporting procedure
1\. The location management server sends location reporting configuration
message to the location management client(s) containing the initial
configuration (or a subsequent update) for reporting the location of the MC
service UE. This message can be sent over a unicast bearer to a specific
location management client or as a group message over an MBMS bearer to update
the location reporting configuration for multiple location management clients
at the same time.
NOTE 1: The location reporting configuration information can be made part of
the user profile, in which case the sending of the message is not necessary.
NOTE 2: Different location management clients may be given different location
reporting criteria.
2\. A location reporting event occurs, triggering step 3.
3\. The location management client sends a location information report to the
location management server, containing location information identified by the
location management server and available to the location management client.
4\. Upon receiving the report, the location management server updates location
of the reporting location management client. If the location management server
does not have location information of the reporting location management client
before, then just stores the reporting location information for that location
management client.
#### 10.9.3.2 On-demand location reporting procedure
The location management server can request UE location information at any time
by sending a location information request to the location management client,
which may trigger location management client to immediately send the location
report.
Figure 10.9.3.2-1: On-demand location information reporting procedure
1\. Based on configurations such as periodical location information timer, or
location information request from other entities (e.g., another location
management client, MC service server), location management server initiates
the immediately request location information from the location management
client.
2\. The location management server sends a location information request to the
location management client.
3\. MC service user is notified and asked about the permission to share its
location. MC service user can accept or deny the request
4\. The location management client immediately responds to the location
management server with a report containing location information identified by
the location management server and available to the location management
client.
5\. Upon receiving the report, the location management server updates location
of the reporting location management client. If the location management server
does not have location information of the reporting location management client
before, then just stores the reporting location information for that location
management client.
#### 10.9.3.3 Client-triggered location reporting procedure
Figure 10.9.3.3-1 illustrates the high level procedure of client-triggered
location reporting.
Figure 10.9.3.3-1: Client-triggered location reporting procedure
1\. Location management client 2 (authorized MC service user) sends a location
reporting trigger to the location management server to activate a location
reporting procedure for obtaining the location information of location
management client 1.
2\. Location management server checks whether location management client 2 is
authorized to send a location reporting trigger. Depending on the information
specified by the location reporting trigger, location management server
initiates an on-demand location reporting procedure or an event-triggered
location reporting procedure for the location of location management client 1.
#### 10.9.3.4 Location reporting cancel procedure
The location reporting cancel procedure reuses the information flow of
location reporting configuration.
Pre-conditions:
\- The location management client has been provided the location reporting
configuration information.
Figure 10.9.3.4-1: Location reporting cancel procedure
1\. The location management server sends location reporting configuration
without any information element to the location management client to stop
location reporting from the MC service UE.
2\. The location management client stops sending location information reports
to the location management server.
#### 10.9.3.5 Location information subscription procedure
Figure 10.9.3.5-1 illustrates the high level procedure of location information
subscription request. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to MC
service user location information.
Figure 10.9.3.5-1: Location information subscription request procedure
1\. MC service server sends a location information subscription request to the
location management server to subscribe location information of one or more MC
service users.
2\. The location management server shall check if the MC service server is
authorized to initiate the location information subscription request.
3\. The location management server replies with a location information
subscription response indicating the subscription status.
#### 10.9.3.6 Usage of location information procedure
##### 10.9.3.6.1 Event-trigger location information notification procedure
Figure 10.9.3.6.1-1 illustrates the high level procedure of event-trigger
usage of location information. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to location
information of MC service user.
Figure 10.9.3.6.1-1: Event-trigger usage of location information procedure
1\. Based on the configurations, e.g., subscription, periodical location
information timer, location management server is triggered to report the
latest user location information to MC service server.
2\. The location management server send the location information report
including the latest location information of one or more MC service users to
the MC service server. The latest location information is from the location
report procedure as described in subclause 10.9.3.1, or from PLMN operator.
3\. MC service server may further share this location information to a group
or to another MC service user.
NOTE: For other entities, the step 3 can be skipped if not needed.
##### 10.9.3.6.2 On-demand usage of location information procedure
The MC service server can request UE location information at any time by
sending a location information request to the location management server,
which may trigger location management server to immediately send the location
report.
Figure 10.9.3.6.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure of on demand usage of
location information. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to location
information of MC service user.
Figure 10.9.3.6.2-1: On-demand usage of location information procedure
1\. MC service server sends a location information request to the location
management server.
2\. The location management server acquires the latest location of the UEs
being requested, by triggering an on-demand location report procedure as
described in subclause 10.9.3.2, or from PLMN operator.
3\. Then, location management server immediately sends the location
information report including the latest location information acquired of one
or more MC service users.
4\. MC service server may further share this location information to a group
or to another MC service user.
NOTE: For other entities, the step 3 can be skipped if not needed.
## 10.10 Emergency Alert
### 10.10.1 On-network emergency alert
#### 10.10.1.1 General
The following subclauses specify the procedures for emergency alert initiation
and emergency state cancel that are utilised by the following MC services:
\- MCVideo service
\- MCData service
Editor\'s note: Whether the following procedures for emergency alert
initiation and emergency state cancel apply to MCPTT service also is FFS.
#### 10.10.1.2 MC service emergency alert
##### 10.10.1.2.1 MC service emergency alert initiation
The procedure focuses on the case where an MC service client is initiating an
MC service emergency alert unicast signalling for communicating the alert with
the affiliated MC service group members of that MC service group. An MC
service client in the MC service emergency state gains elevated access
privilege for all of the MC service user\'s mission critical applications.
This procedure will place the MC service client in the MC service emergency
state if the MC service client is not already in that state.
Procedures in figure 10.10.1.2.1-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MC service client initiating an MC service emergency alert with an MC
service group i.e., MC service users on MC service client 1, MC service client
2 and MC service client 3 belong to the same MC service group which is defined
on group management server.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MC service server is shown in place of a user
home MC service server and a group hosting MC service server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service group is previously defined on the group management server
with MC service client 2 and MC service client 3 affiliated to that MC service
group.
2\. All members of the MC service group belong to the same MC system.
3\. The initiating MC service client 1 is affiliated with one or more MC
service groups.
4\. The initiating MC service client 1 has been provisioned with an MC service
group designated as the MC service emergency group.
NOTE 2: Alternatively, the client could have been provisioned for emergency
behaviour on the currently selected group.
5\. The initiating MC service client 1 may not have carried out an explicit
affiliation procedure with the MC service group designated as the MC service
emergency group.
Figure 10.10.1.2.1-1 MC service emergency alert
1\. The user at the MC service client 1 initiates an MC service emergency
alert. MC service client 1 sets its MC service emergency state. The MC service
emergency state is retained by the MC service client until explicitly
cancelled.
2\. MC service client 1 requests the MC service server to send an MC service
emergency alert request to the MC service group designated as the MC service
emergency group.
3\. MC service server checks whether the MC service user of MC service client
1 is authorized for initiation of MC service emergency alerts for the
indicated MC service group.
4\. MC service server resolves the MC service group ID to determine the
members of that MC service group and their affiliation status, based on the
information from group management server.
5\. The MC service server sends the MC service emergency alert response to the
MC service user 1 to confirm the MC service emergency alert request. MC
service group calls made to this MC service group by the MC service client 1
will be sent as emergency calls until the emergency state on the MC service
client 1 is cancelled.
6\. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency alert request towards
the MC service clients of each of those affiliated MC service group members.
The MC service emergency alert request message shall contain the following
information: Location, MC service ID and MC service group ID (i.e., MC service
user\'s selected MC service group or dedicated MC service emergency group, as
per MC service group configuration) and the MC service user\'s mission
critical organization name.
7\. MC service users are notified of the MC service emergency.
8\. The receiving MC service clients send the MC service emergency alert
response to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service emergency
alert.
9\. The MC service server implicitly affiliates the client to the emergency
group if the client is not already affiliated.
NOTE 3: Sending the emergency alert without making a request to also start an
emergency call does not put the group into the ongoing emergency condition.
NOTE 4: Sending the emergency alert does not put the other UEs in the group
into an emergency state.
NOTE 5: The MC service client 1 need not initiate a group call. For example,
the MC service client can be configured to only allow alerts or the MC service
user can choose not to make an MC service emergency group call.

FFS.
##### 10.10.1.2.2 MC service emergency state cancel
The procedure focuses on the case where an MC service client has initiated an
MC service emergency alert and entered the emergency state, and wishes to
cancel this state, informing the MC service server and other group members of
this cancellation. By doing so, the MC service client may also request the
cancellation of the ongoing emergency condition in the group.
Procedures in figure 10.10.1.2.2-1 are the signalling control plane procedures
for the MC service client cancelling an MC service emergency state with an MC
service group i.e., MC service users on MC service client 1, MC service client
2 and MC service client 3 belong to the same MC service group which is defined
on MC service group management server.
NOTE 1: For simplicity, a single MC service server is shown in place of a user
home MC service server and a group hosting MC service server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service client 1 had previously successfully initiated an MC
service emergency alert.
2\. The MC service client 1 is still in the emergency state.
3\. The initiating MC service client 1 has affiliated with the MC service
group designated as the MC service emergency group.
Figure 10.10.1.2.2-1 MC service emergency state cancel
1\. The user at the MC service client 1 initiates an MC service emergency
state cancel.
NOTE 2: The MC service emergency state cancel request carries an indication to
also request that the in-progress emergency is to be cancelled. The MC service
server can accept or deny the request to cancel the ongoing emergency
condition of the group as a whole, separately from accepting or denying the
request to cancel the emergency state at MC service client 1. Additionally, an
authorized user can cancel either or both the ongoing emergency condition of
the group and the initiator\'s local MC service emergency state.
2\. MC service client 1 requests the MC service server to send an MC service
emergency state cancel to the MC service group to which MC service client 1
had previously sent the emergency alert.
3\. MC service server resolves the MC service group ID to determine the
members of that MC service group and their affiliation status, based on the
information from group management server.
4\. The MC service server sends the MC service emergency state cancel response
to the MC service client 1 to confirm the MC service emergency state cancel
request. MC service client 1 resets its emergency state.
5\. The MC service server sends an MC service emergency state cancel request
towards the MC service clients of each of those affiliated MC service group
members.
6\. MC service users are notified of the MC service emergency state
cancellation of MC service client 1.
7\. The receiving MC service clients send the MC service emergency state
cancel response to the MC service server to acknowledge the MC service
emergency state cancel. For a multicast call scenario, these acknowledgements
are not sent.
### 10.10.2 Off-network emergency alert
#### 10.10.2.1 General
The following subclauses specify the procedures for emergency alert initiation
and emergency state cancel that are utilised by the following MC services:
\- MCVideo service
\- MCData service
Editor\'s note: Whether the following procedures for emergency alert
initiation and emergency state cancel apply to MCPTT service also is FFS.
#### 10.10.2.2 MC service emergency alert
##### 10.10.2.2.1 Emergency alert initiation
Figure 10.10.2.2.1-1 describes procedures for the MC service client initiating
an MC service emergency alert with an MC service group.
This procedure will place the MC service client in the MC service emergency
state if the MC service client is not already in that state.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The initiating MC service client 1 has been provisioned with an MC service
group designated as the MC service emergency group.
NOTE 1: Alternatively, MC service client 1 could have been provisioned for
emergency behaviour on the currently selected group.
2\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MC
service group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in
MC service client 1.
3\. MC service client 1 to MC service client N are members of the same MC
service group.
4\. MC service user 1 has initiated MC service emergency alert.
Figure 10.10.2.2.1-1: Emergency alert initiation
1\. MC service client 1 sends an MC service emergency alert announcement
message to the other clients. MC service client 1 sets its MC service
emergency state. This MC service emergency state is retained by the MC service
client until explicitly cancelled. Once MC service client1 is in the MC
service emergency state, any communications initiated by MC service client 1,
group or private, shall be initiated as emergency communications and shall
receive priority treatment. The MC service emergency alert announcement is
sent periodically so that late joining MC service group members are notified.
NOTE 2: Sending the emergency alert without making a request to also start an
MC service emergency communication does not put the group into the in-progress
emergency condition.
2\. MC service users are notified of the MC service emergency state of the
originating MC service user.
3\. The MC service clients upon receiving the emergency alert announcement
message acknowledge the MC service emergency alert to the originating MC
service client.
NOTE 3: The MC service client 1 need not initiate a group communication. For
example, the MC service client can be configured to only allow alerts or the
MC service user can choose not to make an MC service emergency group
communication.
NOTE 4: MC service clients need to respond only to the first emergency alert
announcement message that is received.
4\. The originating MC service client 1 checks the responses and may inform
the MC service user of the MC service group members whose MC service clients
responded.
##### 10.10.2.2.2 Emergency state cancel
An MC service client has initiated an MC service emergency alert, has entered
the MC service emergency state and wishes to cancel this state, informing the
other MC service group members of the cancellation. As part of this process,
the MC service client may also request the cancellation of the in-progress
emergency condition in the group if authorized to do so.
Procedures in figure 10.10.2.2.2-1 describe procedures for the MC service
client cancelling an MC service emergency state.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC service client 1 has successfully initiated an MC service emergency
alert and is in the MC service emergency state.
2\. Information for ProSe direct communications corresponding to the MC
service group and its mapping to ProSe Layer-2 Group ID are pre-configured in
MC service client 1.
3\. MC service client 1 to MC service client N are members of the same MC
service group.
4\. MC service user 1 has initiated MC service emergency alert cancel.
Figure 10.10.2.2.2-1 Emergency state cancel
1\. MC service client 1 sends an MC service emergency state cancel
announcement to the MC service group to which MC service client 1 had
previously sent the emergency alert announcement message.
2\. MC service users are notified of the MC service emergency cancellation by
MC service client 1.
3\. The receiving MC service clients acknowledge the MC service emergency
state cancel to the originating MC service client.
NOTE: MC service clients that track the MC service emergency alerts of other
MC service users, e.g. clients that fail to receive subsequent periodic MC
service emergency alert announcements after a configured timeout can consider
the alert to be cancelled.
###### ## Annex A (normative): Configuration data for MC services
# A.1 General
This Annex provides information about the static data needed for configuration
for MC services, which belong to one of the following categories:
\- MC service UE configuration data (see subclause A.2);
\- MC service user profile data (see subclause A.3);
\- MC service group configuration data (see subclause A.4);
\- MC service configuration data (see subclause A.5); and
\- Initial MC service UE configuration data (see subclause A.6).
For each configuration category, data is split between configuration data that
is applicable to both onâ€‘network and offâ€‘network, configuration data that is
applicable to on-network only, and configuration data that is applicable to
off-network only. The configuration data in each configuration category
corresponds to a single instance of the category type i.e. the MC service UE,
MC service group, MC service user and MC service configuration data refers to
the information that will be stored against each MC service UE, MC service
group, MC service user and MC service. This means that the three separate
tables (on-network and off-network, on-network only, off-network only) for
each configuration category represent the complete set of data for each
configuration data category element.
The columns in the tables have the following meanings:
\- Reference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.280
[3] or 3GPP TS 22.281 [4] or 3GPP TS 22.282 [5] or 3GPP TS 22.179 [2] or the
corresponding subclause from the present document.
\- Parameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the
corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter
in the configuration hierarchy.
\- When it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is
configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the
following nomenclature is used:
\- \"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be
configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
\- \"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need
to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
Parameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy
that pertains only to that configuration data. The hierarchy of the
configuration data is common across all the three tables of on-network and
offâ€‘network, onâ€‘network only and offâ€‘network only. The level of a parameter
within the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the
character \">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per
level. Parameters that are at the topâ€‘most level within the hierarchy have no
\">\" character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child
parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\"
character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child
parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child
parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they
are just containers for their child parameters.
Each parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through
one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline
shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent
configuration data made available to the MC service UE shall always overwrite
previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data
was provided via the online or offline mechanism.
# A.2 MC service UE configuration data
MC service UE configuration data has to be known by an MC service UE after MC
service authorization. The CSC-4 reference point is used for configuration
between the configuration management server and the configuration management
client on the MC service UE when the MC service UE is on-network.
MC service UE configuration data can be configured offline using the CSC-11
reference point.
MC service UE configuration data is specific to each MC service and is
specified as follows:
\- MCPTT UE configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16];
\- MCVideo UE configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]; and
\- MCData UE configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13].
Within each MC service, the MC service UE configuration data can be the same
or different across MC service UEs.
# A.3 MC service user profile configuration data
The MC service user profile configuration data is stored in the MC service
user database. The configuration management server is used to configure the MC
service user profile configuration data to the MC service user database
(CSC-13) and MC service UE (CSC-4).
MC service user profile configuration data can be configured offline using the
CSC-11 reference point.
MC service user profile configuration data is specific to each MC service and
is specified as follows:
\- MCPTT user profile configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16];
\- MCVideo user profile configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.281
[12]; and
\- MCData user profile configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13];
# A.4 Group configuration data
The group configuration data is stored in the group management server. The
group management server is used to configure the group configuration data to
the MC service UE (CSC-2) and the MC service server (CSC-3).
A single group can support one or multiple MC service configurations. Hence,
the MC service group configuration data is divided into common group
configuration data and MC service specific group configuration data.
The group configuration data can be configured offline using the CSC-12
reference point.
The common group configuration data are specified in table A.4-1. Tables A.4-1
and A.4-2 contain the group configuration required to support the use of on-
network MC service. Tables A.4-1 and A.4-3 contain the group configuration
required to support the use of off-network MC service.
The MC service related group configuration data specific to each MC service is
specified as follows:
\- MCPTT related group configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16];
\- MCVideo related group configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.281
[12]; and
\- MCData related group configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.282
[13];

# A.5 MC service configuration data
The MC service configuration data is stored in the MC service server. The
configuration management server is used to configure the MC service
configuration data to the MC service server (CSC-5) and the MC service UE
(CSC-4).
The MC service configuration data can be configured offline using the CSC-11
reference point.
The MC service configuration data is specific to each MC service and hence the
detailed list of MC service configuration data is listed as follows:
\- MCPTT service configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16];
\- MCVideo service configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12]; and
\- MCData service configuration data is specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13];
# A.6 Initial MC service UE configuration data
The initial MC service UE configuration data is essential to the MC service UE
to successfully connect to the MC system. The initial MC service UE
configuration data can be the same or different across MC service UEs.
Data in table A.6-1 is provided to the MC service UE\'s clients (e.g. MC
service client, group management client, configuration management client,
identity management client, key management client) during the bootstrap
process (see subclause 10.1.1), and can be configured on the MC service UE
offline using the CSC-11 reference point or via other means e.g. as part of
the MCPTT client\'s provisioning on the UE, using a device management
procedure.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Service continuity for MC service
# B.1 Service continuity between on-network MC service and UE-to-network relay
MC service
This annex describes how 3GPP TS 23.237 [10] mechanisms for IMS service
continuity can be used to provide service continuity between on-network MC
service and UE-to-network relay MC service. For illustration, MCPTT AS is
considered as the MC service.
Only the procedure for service continuity from on-network MCPTT service to UE-
to-network relay MCPTT service is described in figure B.1-1. The procedure for
service continuity in the opposite direction is identical.
Figure B.1-1: Service continuity from on-network to UE-to-network relay
As illustrated in figure B.1-1:
\- Initially UE-1 has a direct connection to the network (on-network MCPTT
service). It is registered with the SIP core and is engaged in a SIP session
with the MCPTT Application Server (solid lines SIP-1 and MCPTT-1 in figure
B.1-1).
\- When UE-1 realises that it is losing connection to the network, or after
the connection to the network has been lost, UE-1 discovers a UE-to-network
relay (UE-R) and establishes a PC5 connection with UE-R. UE-1 registers with
the SIP core over the target access leg and enters UE-to-network relay MCPTT
service by transferring the media streams over the target leg (dashed lines
SIP-1 and MCPTT-1 in figure B.1-1).
\- The SIP session is anchored at a Service Centralisation and Continuity
Application Server (SCC AS) before and after the handover, as described in
3GPP TS 23.237 [10].
Depicted in figure B.1-2 is the call flow for service continuity when the UE
switches from on-network MCPTT service to UE-to-network MCPTT relay service.
Figure B.1-2 Service continuity when UE switches from on-network MCPTT service
to UE-to-network relay MCPTT service
0\. UE-1 has a direct connection to the network and is engaged in a SIP
session with the MCPTT AS (on-network MCPTT service). The SIP session is
anchored at a Service Centralisation and Continuity Application Server (SCC
AS) and a Session transfer Identifier (STI) is assigned for the anchored SIP
session, as described in 3GPP TS 23.237 [10].
1\. UE-1 realises that it is losing connection to the network or has
completely lost it.
2\. UE-1 (in the role of remote UE) performs ProSe UE-to-network relay
discovery over PC5 and establishes a secure point-to-point link with the relay
(UE-R) over PC5. As part of this process the remote UE is mutually
authenticated at PC5 layer with either the relay or with the network as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14]. In the process UE-1 is also assigned an IP
address/prefix by the relay.
NOTE 1: If step 2 is started after losing connection, the service interruption
can be noticeable to the user.
NOTE 2: Step 2 will be entirely described under in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14].
3: UE-1 registers with the SIP core over the UE-to-network relay leg.
4\. In order to transfer the media streams of the SIP session UE-1 sends an
INVITE message on the new access leg towards the SCC AS. The INVITE message
includes the STI identifying the session to be transferred. The SCC AS
identifies the session based on STI and updates the session over the remote
access leg i.e. towards the MCPTT AS.
5\. The procedure is completed when all media streams have been transferred on
the access leg relayed via UE-R. At this point UE-1 may deregister the on-
network leg if it still has direct network connection (not shown in the
figure).
NOTE 3: The procedure for service continuity is always completed with unicast
delivery on the target side. If MCPTT content is being distributed on the
target side in multicast mode, then switching from unicast to multicast
delivery is performed after completion of the service continuity procedure.
