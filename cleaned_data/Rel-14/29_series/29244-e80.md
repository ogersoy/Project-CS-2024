# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Packet Forwarding Control Protocol (PFCP)
used on the interface between the control plane and the user plane function in
a split SGW, PGW and TDF architecture in EPC.
The architecture reference model and stage 2 information are specified in 3GPP
TS 23.214 [2].
PFCP shall be used over the Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and the combined Sxa/Sxb reference
points.
PFCP shall also be used over the Sxa\' and Sxb\' reference points specified in
3GPP TS 33.107 [20]. In the rest of this specification, no difference is made
between Sxa and Sxa\', or between Sxb and Sxb\'. The Sxa\' and Sxb\' reference
points reuse the protocol specified for the Sxa and Sxb reference points, but
comply in addition with the security requirements specified in clause 8 of
3GPP 33.107 [20].

# 5 General description
## 5.1 Introduction
The architecture reference model with Control and User Plane Separation of EPC
nodes is described in subclause 4.2 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
This clause specifies the high level principles of the PFCP protocol and
describe how 3GPP functionalities are realised on the Sxa, Sxb and Sxc
reference points, e.g. Packet Forwarding, Policy and Charging Control, Lawful
Interception.
## 5.2 Packet Forwarding Model
### 5.2.1 General
The packet forwarding scenarios supported over the Sxa, Sxb and Sxc reference
points are specified in 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
The CP function controls the packet processing in the UP function by
establishing, modifying or deleting Sx Session contexts and by provisioning
(i.e. adding, modifying or deleting) PDRs, FARs, QERs, URRs and/or BAR per Sx
session context, whereby an Sx session context may correspond to an individual
PDN connection, a TDF session, or a standalone session not tied to any PDN
connection or TDF session used e.g. for forwarding Radius, Diameter or DHCP
signalling between the PGW-C and the PDN.
Each PDR shall contain a PDI, i.e. one or more match fields against which
incoming packets are matched, and may be associated to the following rules
providing the set of instructions to apply to packets matching the PDI:
\- one FAR, which contains instructions related to the processing of the
packets as follows:
\- an Apply Action parameter, which indicates whether the UP function shall
forward, duplicate, drop or buffer the packet with or without notifying the CP
function about the arrival of a DL packet;
\- forwarding, buffering and/or duplicating parameters, which the UP function
shall use if the Apply Action parameter requests the packets to be forwarded,
buffered or duplicated respectively. These parameters may remain configured in
the FAR regardless of the Apply Action parameter value, to minimize the
changes to the FAR during the transitions of the UE between the idle and
connected modes. The buffering parameters, when present, shall be provisioned
in a BAR created at the Sx session level and referenced by the FAR.
NOTE 1: Buffering refers here to the buffering of the packet in the UP
function. The UP function is instructed to forward DL packets to the CP
function when applying buffering in the CP function. See subclause 5.3.1.
\- zero, one or more QERs, which contains instructions related to the QoS
enforcement of the traffic;
\- zero, one or more URRs, which contains instructions related to traffic
measurement and reporting.
A FAR, a QER and a URR shall only be associated to one or multiple PDRs of the
same Sx session context.
The QoS Enforcement Rule Correlation ID shall be assigned by the CP function
to correlate QERs from multiple Sx session contexts. For instance, the
enforcement of APN-AMBR in the PGW-U shall be achieved by setting the same QoS
Enforcement Rule Correlation ID to the QERs from different Sx sessions
associated with all the PDRs corresponding to the non-GBR bearers of all the
UE\'s PDN connections to the same APN. The QERs that are associated to the
same QoS Enforcement Rule Correlation ID in multiple Sx sessions shall be
provisioned, with the same QER contents, in each of these Sx sessions.
The following principles shall apply for the provisioning of PDRs in the UP
function:
\- The CP function shall not provision more than one PDR with the same match
fields in the PDI (i.e. with the same set of match fields and with the same
value). The CP function may provision PDRs with the same value for a subset of
the match fields of the PDI but not all;
\- different PDRs of a same Sx session may overlap, e.g. the CP function may
provision two PDRs which differ by having one match field set to a specific
value in one PDR and the same match field not included in the other PDR (thus
matching any possible value);
\- different PDRs of different Sx sessions shall not overlap, i.e. there shall
be at least one PDR in each Sx session which differs by at least one different
(and not wildcarded) match field in their PDI, such that any incoming user
plane packet may only match PDRs of a single Sx session;
NOTE 2: It is allowed for instance to provision in a PGW-U a same uplink PDR,
matching any uplink traffic towards a particular application server\'s IP
address, in two different Sx sessions of two different UEs, as long as each Sx
session is also provisioned with another uplink PDR set with the respective UE
IP address and/or uplink F-TEIDu, which allows the PGW-U to identify the Sx
session to which the packet corresponds.
\- As an exception to the previous principle, the CP function may provision a
PDR with all match fields wildcarded (i.e. all match fields omitted in the
PDI) in a separate Sx session, to control how the UP function shall process
packets unmatched by any PDRs of any other Sx session. The CP function may
provision the UP function to send these packets to the CP function or to drop
them. The UP function shall grant the lowest precedence to this PDR.
On receipt of a user plane packet, the UP function shall perform a lookup of
the provisioned PDRs and:
\- identify first the Sx session to which the packet corresponds; and
\- find the first PDR matching the incoming packet, among all the PDRs
provisioned for this Sx session, starting with the PDRs with the highest
precedence and continuing then with PDRs in decreasing order of precedence.
Only the highest precedence PDR matching the packet shall be selected, i.e.
the UP function shall stop the PDRs lookup once a matching PDR is found.
A packet matches a PDR if all the match fields which are identified with
different IE type in the PDI of the PDR are matching the corresponding packet
header fields. If a match field is not included in the PDI, it shall be
considered as matching all possible values in the header field of the packet.
If the match field is present and does not include a mask, the match field
shall be considered as matching the corresponding header field of the packet
if it has the same value. If the match field is present and includes a mask
(e.g. IP address with a prefix mask), the match field shall be considered as
matching the corresponding header field of the packet if it has the same value
for the bits which are set in the mask. If a match field has multiple
instances, i.e. there are several IEs with the same IE type, a packet matches
this match field if any instance is matching the corresponding packet header
field.\ The match fields of the PDI shall correspond to outer and/or inner
packet header fields, e.g. uplink bearer binding verification in the PGW-U may
be achieved by configuring a PDR with the PDI containing the local GTP-U
F-TEID (for outer IP packet matching) and the SDF filters of the data flows
mapped to the bearer (for inner IP packet matching).
The UP function should drop packets unmatched by any PDRs.
The packet processing flow in the UP function is illustrated in Figure
5.2.1-1.
Figure 5.2.1-1: Packet processing flow in the UP function
At the deletion of an Sx session, the UP function shall delete the Sx session
context and all the associated non-preconfigured rules.
NOTE 3: Deleting a QER in one Sx session does not result in deleting another
QER in another Sx session even when these two QERs have the same QER ID and/or
are associated with the same QER Correlation ID.
A UP Function controlled by multiple CP functions shall handle Rule IDs from
the different CP functions independently from each other.
Rule ID used for PDR, FAR, BAR, QER or URR is uniquely identifying a rule of
the corresponding rule type within a session.
### 5.2.1A Packet Detection Rule Handling
#### 5.2.1A.1 General
When provisioning a PDR in the UP function, the CP function shall provide the
PDI with the following information:
\- the source interface of the incoming packets;
\- a combination of the parameters, that incoming packets are requested to
match, among: Local F-TEID, Network Instance, UE IP address, SDF Filter(s)
and/or Application ID.
The requirements for provisioning an SDF filter in the PDI are specified in
subclauses 5.2.1A.2A and 5.2.1A.3.
The CP function may provision the parameters, that incoming packets are
requested to match, in the UP function by:
\- providing the parameters individually in each PDI of the Sx session; or
\- optionally, if the PDI Optimization feature is supported by the UP
function, by providing the parameters which may be common to multiple PDIs of
a same Sx session in a Traffic Endpoint IE and by referencing this Traffic
Endpoint in the PDI(s) of the Sx session. See subclause 5.2.1A.2. A Traffic
Endpoint may include a Local F-TEID, Network Instance and/or UE IP address.
NOTE: A Traffic Endpoint can correspond to a GTP-u endpoint or an SGi
endpoint.
#### 5.2.1A.2 PDI Optimization
PDI Optimization is an optional feature which may be supported by the CP and
UP Functions. This feature allows the CP function to optimize the signaling
towards the UP function by creating the information that are common to
multiple PDRs as a Traffic Endpoint with a Traffic Endpoint ID and then
referring to this common information from multiple PDRs. The Traffic Endpoint
ID shall be unique within an Sx session. When a PDI refers to a Traffic
Endpoint, the parameters that are in the Traffic Endpoint shall not be once
again provided in the PDI. The CP function may update the Traffic Endpoint at
any time.
If a Traffic Endpoint is updated, all the PDRs that refer to this Traffic
Endpoint in the UP function shall use the updated information.
If F-TEID allocation is performed in the UP function, the UP function shall
allocate and store the F-TEID associated to the Traffic Endpoint. When the UP
function provides the allocated F-TEID to the CP function in the Sx Session
Establishment response or Sx Session Modification response message, the CP
function shall update the Traffic Endpoint information stored in the CP
function with the received F-TEID.
The CP function should use a Traffic Endpoint ID created in a different Sx
message only after getting the confirmation from the UP function of the
Traffic Endpoint ID creation.
If the CP function deletes a Traffic Endpoint, the UP Function shall delete
all the PDRs that refer to this Traffic Endpoint.
NOTE 1: The requirements specified in subclause 5.2.2.3.1 for reporting usage
reports to the CP function also apply if the deletion of the Traffic Endpoint
results in deleting the last PDR associated to a URR.
NOTE2: For EPC, the Remove Traffic Endpoint IE can be used to delete a bearer
for which multiple PDRs exist (with the same Traffic Endpoint ID).
#### 5.2.1A.2A Provisioning of SDF filters
When provisioning an SDF Filter in a PDI, the CP function shall:
\- copy the Flow Description if it is received from the PCRF (or PCF), in the
corresponding PDI of a PDR regardless of whether the PDR is for matching
uplink or downlink traffic;
NOTE 1 The Flow Description received from the PCRF (or PCF) is set assuming
downlink flows only, see subclause 5.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8]. The CP
function uses the Flow-Direction AVP received from the PCRF (or PCF) to
determine the actual direction and thus the source interface of the packet
flows described in the Flow Description.
\- for traffic from CP-function or SGi-LAN:
\- If the traffic is intended to be forwarded to the UE, the CP function shall
provision the Flow Description with IPFilterRule \"source\" parameters set to
correspond to the CP function or SGi-LAN and the IPFilterRule \"destination\"
parameters correspond to the UE;
\- If the traffic is intended to be forwarded to the PDN, the CP function
shall provision the Flow Description with IPFilterRule \"source\" parameters
set to correspond to the CP function or SGi-LAN and the IPFilterRule
\"destination\" parameters correspond to the PDN.
The UP function shall apply the SDF filter based on the Source Interface of
the PDR as follows (see also subclause 8.2.5):
\- when the Source Interface is CORE, this indicates that the filter is for
downlink data flow, so the UP function shall apply the Flow Description as is;
\- when the Source Interface is ACCESS, this indicates that the filter is for
uplink data flow, so the UP function shall swap the source and destination
address/port in the Flow Description;
\- when the Source Interface is CP-function or SGi-LAN, the UP function shall
use the Flow Description as is.
#### 5.2.1A.3 Bidirectional SDF Filters
The CP function may provision bidirectional SDF Filters in the UP function
(see subclause 8.2.5), i.e. SDF Filters that may be associated to both uplink
and downlink PDRs of a same Sx session, as follows:
\- when provisioning a bidirectional SDF Filter the first time for an Sx
session, the CP function shall provision the SDF filter definition together
with a SDF Filter ID uniquely identifying the SDF Filter among all the SDF
Filters provisioned for a given Sx Session;
\- the CP function may then provision a PDR for the same Sx session but the
opposite direction, by provisioning the SDF Filter ID in the SDF filter ID
field of the PDI, without provisioning again the SDF filter definition;
\- the UP function shall apply any modification of a bidirectional SDF Filter
to all PDRs of the Sx session making use of this SDF Filter;
\- upon deletion of a PDR making use of a bidirectional SDF Filter, the UP
function shall still apply the SDF Filter for any other PDR making use of the
SDF Filter.
The requirements specified for provisioning SDF filters in subclause 5.2.1A.2A
shall also apply when provisioning bidirectional SDF Filters.
### 5.2.2 Usage Reporting Rule Handling
#### 5.2.2.1 General
The CP function shall provision URR(s) for an Sx session in an Sx Session
Establishment Request or an Sx Session Modification Request to request the UP
function to:
\- measure the network resources usage in terms of traffic data volume,
duration (i.e. time) and/or events, according to the provisioned Measurement
Method; and
\- send a usage report to the CP function, when the measurement reaches a
certain threshold, periodically or when detecting a certain event, according
to the provisioned Reporting Triggers.
NOTE: The UP function sends a usage report without performing network
resources usage measurements when being requested to detect and report the the
start of an SDF or application traffic.
#### 5.2.2.2 Provisioning of Usage Reporting Rule in the UP function
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
When provisioning a URR, the CP function shall provide the reporting
trigger(s) in the Reporting Triggers IE of the URR which shall cause the UP
function to generate and send a Usage Report for this URR to the CP function.
When adding or removing reporting trigger(s) to or from the URR, the CP
function shall provide the new complete list of applicable reporting triggers
in the Reporting Triggers IE in the Sx Session Modification Request message.
For the volume-based measurement method, the CP function may provision:
\- the Volume Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate a usage
report when the measured traffic reaches the threshold;
\- the Volume Quota IE, to request the UP function to stop forwarding packets
(or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on
operator policy in the UP function) and, if no Volume Threshold is
provisioned, to also generate a usage report, when the measured traffic
reaches the quota;
\- the Dropped DL Traffic Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate
a usage report when the downlink traffic that is being dropped reaches the
threshold; and/or
NOTE 1: The Dropped DL Traffic Threshold can be armed in a SGW-U for
triggering the PGW Pause of Charging feature (see 3GPP TS 23.401 [14]).
\- a Measurement Information with the \'Measurement Before QoS Enforcement\'
flag set to 1, to request the UP function to measure the traffic usage before
any QoS enforcement.
For the time-based measurement method, the CP function may provision:
\- a Time Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate a usage report
when the measured traffic reaches the threshold;
\- a Time Quota, to request the UP function to stop forwarding packets (or
only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator
policy in the UP function) and, if no Time Threshold is provisioned, to also
generate a usage report, when the measured traffic reaches the quota;
\- a Measurement Information with the \"Immediate Start Time Metering\" flag
set to 1, to request the UP function to start time metering immediately at
receiving the flag; otherwise, the UP function shall start time metering when
the first packet is received; and/or
\- an Inactivity Detection Time, to request the UP function to suspend the
time measurement when no packets are received during the provisioned
Inactivity Detection Time. The time measurement shall then be resumed by the
UP function when subsequent traffic is received. If an Inactivity Detection
Time value of zero is provided, or if no Inactivity Detection Time has been
provided by the CP function, the time measurement shall be performed
continuously until a new non-zero Inactivity Detection Time is received or the
time-based usage measurement is stopped. See Figure 5.2.2.2-1:
Figure 5.2.2.2-1: IDT based charging
NOTE 2: The Inactivity Detection Time can be set to the Quota Consumption
Timer if received. The Inactivity Detection Time is not used to control when
the time metering starts.
\- a Time Quota Mechanism, including a Base Time Interval Type, which is
either Continuous Time Period (CTP) or Discrete Time Period (DTP), and a Base
Time Interval (BTI), to the UP function. See subclause 6.5.7 in 3GPP TS
32.299[18].
\- For CTP (Continuous Time Period), the time measurement starts from the time
that traffic has occurred up to the first Base Time Interval (BTI) which
contains no traffic. The time measurement shall include the last Base Time
Interval, i.e. the one which contained no traffic. The time measurement
resumes by the UP function when subsequent traffic is received. See Figure
5.2.2.2-2:
Figure 5.2.2.2-2: CTP based charging
\- For DTP (Descrete Time Period), the time measurement starts from the time
that traffic has occurred up to the Base Time Interval end. The time
measurement shall be resumed by the UP function when subsequent traffic is
received. See Figure 5.2.2.2-3:
Figure 5.2.2.2-3: DTP based charging
When the time-based measurement method applies, and when the Envelope
Reporting is required, the CP function shall request the UP function to report
the usage by setting the reporting trigger to Envelope Closure in addition to
other Reporting Trigger(s), in the Reporting Triggers IE. The CP function may
indicate the UP function to report for just time, time and volume, time and
events, or time and volume and number of events by setting Measurement Method
accordingly. The CP function may set the Reduced Application Detection
Information flag in the Measurement Information of the URR, when requesting
the detection of start and stop of an application solely for the purpose of
envelope reporting.
The CP function may provision a Volume Threshold, a Volume Quota, or both
(and/or respectively a Time Threshold, a Time Quota, or both).
When both a Volume (or Time) Threshold and a Volume (or Time) Quota are
provisioned, the UP function shall send a usage report only when reaching the
Volume (or Time) Threshold; when subsequently reaching the Volume (or Time)
Quota, the UP function shall stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding
of some limited user plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP
function) without sending a new usage report to the CP function.
NOTE 3: For online charging, the Volume Threshold (or Time Threshold) can be
set in a PGW-U or TDF-U to the value of the granted volume (or time) quota
minus the volume (or time) quota threshold, such as to get a usage report from
the UP function when the volume (or time) based credit falls below the
remaining quota thresholds provided by the OCS.
NOTE 4: The Volume Quota or Time Quota can be armed in a PGW-U or TDF-U for
online charging to enable the traffic to be forwarded up to an intermediate or
final quotas granted by the OCS. The CP function can provision both a Volume
(or Time) Threshold and a Volume (or Time) Threshold to request the UP
function to:\ \- send a usage report when the consumed resources reach the
volume (or time) usage threshold provided by the OCS, and\ \- to stop
forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane
traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function), without sending a
second usage report, when the granted volume (or time) quota is exhausted.
For event based measurement method, the CP function may provision:
\- the Event Threshold IE, to request the UP function to generate a usage
report when the number of events reaches the event threshold;
\- the Event Quota IE, to request the UP function to stop forwarding packets
applicable to the event (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane
traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) and, if no Event
threshold is provisioned, to also generate a usage report, when the number of
events reaches the event quota;
NOTE 5: An event is preconfigured with one or more event detection logic in
the UPF. Each event detection logic is associated with an Application ID. The
CP function activates the detection and reporting of an event by provisioning
PDR(s) with the PDI set to an Application ID and by provisioning a URR with an
event threshold or event quota reporting trigger. The CP function identifies
an event reported in a Usage Report by the URR ID.For all the measurement
methods (i.e. volume, time or event), the CP function may also provision:
\- a Quota Holding Time, to request the UP function to send a usage report and
to also stop forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user
plane traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function) when no packets
have been received for the duration indicated in this parameter;
NOTE 6: A Quota Holding Time can be armed in a PGW-U or TDF-U for online
charging to request the UP function to send a Usage Report when the Quota
Holding Time provided by the OCS (see 3GPP TS 32.299 [18]) expires. The UP
function can be instructed in the same Usage Reporting Rule with the Report
Triggers -- START to generate a new Usage Report upon receiving any subsequent
packets associated with this URR.
\- a Monitoring Time IE and zero or more additional Monitoring Time IEs, to
request the UP function to measure the network resources usage before and
after the monitoring time in separate counts and to re-apply the volume and/or
time, and/or event thresholds at the monitoring time. The CP function may
additionally provision a Subsequent Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold IE
and/or a Subsequent Volume (or Time or Event) Quota IE, for a volume (or time
or Event) based measurement. When being provisioned with a Monitoring Time,
the UP function shall:
\- reset its usage thresholds at the monitoring time to the value provided in
the Subsequent Volume (or Time or Event) Threshold IE, if provisioned in the
URR, or to the remaining value of the Volume (or Time or Event) threshold used
before the monitoring time (i.e. excluding the already accumulated volume or
time or Event usage);
\- shall indicate the usage up to the Monitoring time and usage after the
Monitoring time in the first usage report after the Monitoring Time is
reached;
\- a Measurement Period, indicating the period to generate periodic usage
reports to the CP function.
The CP function may request at any time the UP function to activate or
deactivate a network resources usage measurement, using the Inactive
Measurement flag of the Measurement Information IE of the URR.
NOTE 7: This can be used in a PGW-U for the PGW Pause of Charging procedure
(see 3GPP TS 23.401 [14]).
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Credit pooling
When the Credit Pool feature is supported and the CP function (e.g. PGW-C) is
instructed to handle a Credit Pool for a given Gy Session, the CP function
shall create a URR for the Credit Pool, and in this URR, the CP function:
\- shall include one Aggregated URR ID IE per URR sharing the credit pool,
including the URR ID of the URR sharing the credit pool and the associated
Multiplier to measure the abstract service units the corresponding traffic
consumes from the credit pool;
\- shall set the Time or Volume Threshold or Quota IE to the value calculated
as specified in IETF RFC 4006 [16] according to the Measurement Method.
> NOTE 1: The value can be calculated using the following formula:
>
> S = Q1*M1 + Q2*M2 + ... + Qn*Mn,\ where the S is the quota for the credit
> pool, Qn is the quota and Mn is the multiplier for each Rating Group (RG)
> which are provided via the Multiple Services Credit Control from the OCS.\ A
> URRn is defined for each of RG.
>
> NOTE 2: When the Measurement Method is set to the combined volume/duration,
> the Time and Volume Threshold or Quota are calculated indepentently.
\- may set the Reporting Trigger to reporting upon reaching a volume or time
threshold or quota;
\- may set the Measurement Method to the data volume, duration (i.e. time),
combined volume/duration according to the Measurement Method set in the URRs
in the Credit Pool.
> NOTE 3: The UP function is instructed to handle a Credit Pool when a G-S-U-
> Pool-Reference AVP is included within a Multiple Services Credit Control
> from the OCS. A Credit Pool is identified by the G-S-U-Pool-Identifier AVP.
> See subclause 6.3.11, 6.4.3 and 6.4.4 of 3GPP TS 32.299 [18].
In addition, the CP function shall also include the Linked URR IE, set to the
Credit Pool URR ID, in all the URRs which are sharing the credit pool (i.e.
which are associatied with RGs sharing the Credit Pool).
#### 5.2.2.3 Reporting of Usage Report to the CP function
##### 5.2.2.3.1 General
When detecting that a provisioned reporting trigger occurs, the UP function
shall generate a Usage Report for the related URR and send it to the CP
function by initiating the Sx Session Report procedure.
When providing usage report information for a URR in a message, the UP
function shall include the UR-SEQN (Usage Report Sequence Number) identifying
the order in which a Usage Report is generated for the given URR. The UR-SEQN
(Usage Report Sequence Number) shall be set to \"0\" for the first Usage
Report and incremented for every subsequent Usage Report generated by the UP
function for the URR. The UP function shall also indicate the trigger that
causes the usage report to be generated in the Usage Report Trigger IE.
Upon generating a usage report for a URR towards the CP function, the UP
function shall:
\- reset its ongoing measurement counts for the related URR (i.e. the UP
function shall report in a usage report the network resources usage
measurement since the last usage report for that URR);
\- re-apply all the thresholds (Volume/Time/Event Threshold) provisioned for
the related URR, if the usage report was triggered due to one of the
thresholds being reached; and
\- continue to apply all the provisioned URR(s) and perform the related
network resources usage measurement(s), until getting any further instruction
from the CP function.
When receiving a new threshold or quota from the CP function for a measurement
that is already ongoing in the UP function, the UP function shall consider its
ongoing measurements counts for the related URR against the new threshold or
quota to determine when to send its next usage report to the CP function. At
receiving a new quota with value set to zero, the UP function shall stop
forwarding packets (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane
traffic, based on operator policy in the UP function), and the UP function
shall report in a usage report the network resources usage measurement since
the last usage report for that URR.
NOTE 1: The UP function determines when to send its next usage report to the
CP function by deducting from the newly provisioned threshold or quota the
traffic it has forwarded since its last usage report. As an example, if the UP
function has forwarded 10 Mbytes of traffic since it last usage report to the
CP function and the CP function provisions a new volume threshold or quota of
100 Mbytes, the UP function sends its next usage report upon forwarding an
additional 90 Mbytes traffic.
When reporting the network resources usage before and after a Monitoring Time,
the UP function shall send two Usage Reports in the PFCP message (e.g. Sx
Session Report Request) for the same URR ID. Each Usage Report shall then
include the Usage Information IE indicating whether the reported network
resource usage was consumed before or after the Monitoring Time. Omission of
this IE in a Usage Report indicates that no monitoring time has occurred. The
UP function shall send Usage Reports soon after the occurrence of the
Monitoring Time.
NOTE 2: The UP function needs to take care to smooth the signalling load
towards the CP function if Usage Reports need to be generated for a large
number of Sx sessions after the occurrence of the Monitoring Time.
For the volume-based measurement method, the UP function shall report the
traffic usage after any QoS enforcement. Additionally, if the CP function
requested to measure the traffic usage before QoS enforcement, the UP function
shall also report corresponding measurements, when measurements needs to be
reported for the traffic usage after QoS enforcement, by sending two Usage
Reports in the PFCP message (e.g. Sx Session Report Request) for the same URR
ID. Each Usage Report shall then include the Usage Information IE indicating
whether the reported network resource usage corresponds to the traffic before
or after QoS enforcement. Thresholds provisioned in a URR shall apply to the
traffic usage after any QoS enforcement.
For the volume-based measurement method, the UP function shall include all the
counters (Total, Uplink and Downlink) of the URR in the Volume Measurement IE
in the Usage Report IE.
A usage report triggered only due to the Dropped DL Traffic Threshold shall
not contain any measurement information.
When being instructed to remove a URR or the last PDR associated to a URR, the
UP function shall include a Usage Report in the Sx Session Modification
Response or in an additional Sx Session Report Request if there are non-null
measurements to report for the URR, and shall reset its ongoing measurements
for the URR that is removed, or dissociated from the last PDR.
When being instructed to deactivate a network resources usage measurement via
the Inactive Measurement flag of the Measurement Information IE of the URR,
the UP function shall stop measuring the network resources usage (against the
volume/time/event threshold/quota) and store the current measurement counts
which will be resumed when the URR is activated again. The UP function shall
not generate a usage report upon the deactivation of the URR and it shall send
a usage report during the period when the URR is deactivated for the following
scenarios:
\- if the Quota Holding Time is expired and if the reporting trigger QUHTI is
set;
NOTE 3: The Quota Holding Time can have been started before the URR is
deactivated or starts from the moment when the URR is deactivated since no
quota will be consumed.
\- if it is the time for a periodic reporting and if the reporting trigger
PERIO is set;
\- if it is required to send a usage report for this URR when a usage report
is reported for a linked URR and if the reporting trigger LIUSA is set;
\- if it is required to send an immeditate report upon a query for the URR, or
the URR is removed, dissociated from the last PDR.
NOTE 4: Multiple usage reports can be required to be reported to the CP
function when deleting a PDR that is the last one to be associated to multiple
URRs.
The CP function may request the UP function, in an Sx Session Modification
Request, to report its ongoing network resources measurement for one or
multiple URRs of the Sx session. In this case, the UP function shall:
\- generate usage report(s) for the URR(s) being queried and for any
associated linked usage reports (see subclause 5.2.2.4) for which there are
non-null measurements to report;
\- include them in the Sx Session Modification Response or in additional Sx
Session Report Request messages; and
\- proceed as specified above upon generating a usage report for a URR towards
the CP function, with the following additions:
\- if the Sx Session Modification Request includes the Update URR IE (for the
URR being queried) with a Volume or Time Threshold, the UP function shall re-
apply the threshold received in the request;
\- otherwise, if a threshold had been set for the URR that is queried, since
the usage report is not triggered due to the threshold being reached, the UP
function shall adjust the threshold by subtracting the time/volume reported in
the usage report to determine when to generate the next report.
NOTE 5: Upon reaching a threshold that was adjusted due to a URR query as
specified above, the UP function re-applies then the threshold that was
provisioned in the URR (i.e. not the value of the adjusted threshold).
NOTE 6: The CP function can query a URR without including a Volume or Time
Threshold in the Sx Session Modification Request e.g. when it needs to close a
traffic volume/service container (see subclause 5.2.3.10.3 of 3GPP TS 32.251
[17]).
NOTE 7: The CP function can query a URR including a Volume or Time Threshold
in the Sx Session Modification Request e.g. when it needs to close a CDR (see
subclause 5.2.3.10.3 of 3GPP TS 32.251 [17]). In such a case, the CP function
can include the same threshold for the URR being queried in the Update URR IE
in the Sx Session Modification Request message to trigger the UP function to
re-apply the threshold.
NOTE 8: It is up to the CP function to request the UP function to generate an
immediate report (or not) as specified above when the CP function modifies a
URR or any other rules of the Sx session. As an exception, the UP function
always generates an immediate report when being instructed to remove a URR.
When additional Sx Session Report Request messages need to be sent, the UP
function shall indicate, either in the Sx Session Modification Response or in
one Sx Session Report Request, how many usage reports will be sent in Sx
Session Report Request messages. If this is indicated in one Sx Session Report
Request, the Sx Session Modification Response shall indicate that more reports
will follow by setting the AURI flag of the Additional Usage Reports
Information IE. Besides, if the Sx Session Modification Request included the
Query URR Reference IE, usage reports sent in response to the query in the Sx
Session Modification Response and/or additional Sx Session Report Request
messages shall include the Query URR Reference IE set to the same value as
received in the Sx Session Modification Request.
When the reporting trigger \"Envelope Closure\" is set in the corresponding
Usage Reporting Rule, the UP function shall generate a usage report with the
measurement of the time and/or volume as instructed in the Measurement Method:
\- when the Inactivity Detection Time (if included) is expired; or
\- when detecting no usage for the first Base Time Interval if the Base Time
Interval Type in the Time Quota Mechanism is set to CTP; or
\- at the end of each of base time interval if the Base Time Interval Type in
the Time Quota Mechanism is set to DTP.
NOTE 9: Events (e.g. application detection information) are reported
individually and independently from the usage report sent for envelope
closure.
At the Sx session termination, the UP function shall indicate to the CP
function, in the Sx Session Deletion Response, the resources that have been
consumed for each URR that was provisioned in the Sx session since the last
usage report (respective to each URR).
Upon receiving the Usage Report from the UP function, the CP function may
initiate Sx Session Modification procedure as result of the communication with
the PCRF or OCS, as described in subclause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2], e.g. by:
\- modifying the URR (e.g. changing the Volume/Time threshold, Volume/Time
quota, disabling the usage monitoring);
\- creating a new FAR (e.g. for redirect) and/or modifying the existing FAR;
or
\- modifying the QER (s) in the Sx session.
##### 5.2.2.3.2 Credit pooling
When a URR is received with at least one Aggregated URRs IE included, the UP
function:
\- shall calculate the traffic usage of the URR by applying the Multiplier(s)
and aggregating the traffic usage from all URRs indicated in the Aggregated
URRs IE(s), as specified in IETF RFC 4006 [16];
> NOTE 1: The usage of this URR is calculated using the following formula:
>
> C1*M1 + C2*M2 + ... + Cn*Mn = U,\ where U is the usage counted by this URR,
> Cn is the usage counted by each aggregated URR (i.e. URR for each RG sharing
> the credit pool), and Mn is the multiplier for each aggregrated URR.
\- shall generate a report when the counted usage exceeds the threshold;
\- shall generate a report if the threshold is not provided, and stop packets
forwarding (or only allow forwarding of some limited user plane traffic, based
on operator policy in the UP function) for all Aggregated URRs when the
counted usage exceeds the quota.
NOTE 2: The handling of the aggregated URR(s), e.g. generating a Usage Report
upon the Reporting Trigger(s) is not impacted by handling of this URR for the
Credit Pool.
#### 5.2.2.4 Reporting of Linked Usage Reports to the CP function
The CP function may instruct the UP function to generate a Usage Report for a
URR \"X\" when a Usage Report is generated for another URR \"Y\", by:
\- provisioning the URR \"X\" with the Reporting Triggers IE set to Linked
Usage Reporting; and
\- including in the URR \"X\" the Linked URR ID IE set to the URR ID of the
URR \"Y\".
NOTE 1: This can be used by the CP function e.g. to request the UP function to
report a Usage Report for an SDF (i.e. URR \"X\") when the UP function reports
a Usage Report for a bearer (i.e. URR \"Y\").
NOTE 2: This can be used by the CP function e.g. to request the UP function to
report a Usage Report for a RG (i.e. URR \"X\") when the UP function reports a
Usage Report for a credit pool to which this RG pertain (i.e. URR \"Y\").
When a usage report is to be generated for the URR \"Y\", including when an
immediate usage report is requested for the URR \"Y\" within an Sx Session
Modification Request, the UP function shall also send a Usage Report for the
URR \"X\" with the accumulated usage information, and the Usage Report Trigger
IE set to Linked Usage Reporting.
The URR \"Y\" may be linked to more URRs than just URR \"X\".
A RG level URR may be linked to IP-CAN bearer level URR as well as IP-CAN
Session level URR to enable the CP function to generate a CDR on the different
level. In such case, a URR \"X\" may link to more URRs than just URR \"Y\".
### 5.2.3 Forwarding Action Rule Handling
#### 5.2.3.1 General
The CP function shall provision one and only one FAR for each PDR provisioned
in an Sx session. The FAR provides instructions to the UP function on how to
process the packets matching the PDR.
By setting the appropriate flag(s) in the Apply Action IE in the FAR (see
subclause 8.2.26), the CP function may request the UP function to:
\- drop the packets, by setting the DROP flag;
\- forward the packets, by setting the FORW flag and by provisioning the
Forwarding Parameters providing instructions on how to forward the packets;
\- buffer downlink packets by setting the BUFF flag and by optionally
provisioning buffering parameters providing instructions on how to buffer the
packets;
\- notify the CP function about the arrival of a first DL packet being
buffered, by setting the NOCP flag;
\- duplicate the packets, by setting the DUPL flag and by provisioning the
Duplicating Parameters providing instructions on how to forward the duplicated
packets.
The CP function may request the UP function to duplicate packets that are to
be dropped, forwarded or buffered.
The CP function may provision one or more FAR(s) per Sx session. Different
FARs of a same Sx session may be provisioned with a different Apply Action
flags, e.g. to enable the forwarding of downlink data packets for some PDRs
while requesting to buffer downlink data packets for other PDRs.
NOTE 1: This is necessary to establish or release a partial set of radio
access bearers in UTRAN.
When instructed to buffer and notify the CP function about the arrival of a DL
packet, the UP function shall notify the CP function, when it receives a first
downlink packet for a given FAR, by sending an Sx Session Report Request
including a Downlink Data Report IE identifying the PDR(s) for which downlink
packets have been received.
NOTE 2: Receipt of downlink packets on PDRs associated to different FARs can
result in sending multiple Sx Session Report Request messages for the same Sx
session.
If the UP function indicated support of Header Enrichment of UL traffic (see
subclause 8.2.25), the CP function may provide the UP function with header
enrichment information for uplink traffic, by including one or more Header
Enrichment IE(s) in the FAR. In this case, the UP function should use this
information to enrich the header of the uplink traffic (e.g. HTTP header
enrichment).
NOTE 3: It is not defined how to support SGi PtP tunnelling mechanisms other
than based on UDP/IP encapsulation (such as PMIPv6/GRE, L2TP, GTP-C/U, see
subclause 4.3.17.8.3.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [14]) for Non-IP PDN connections.
If the UP function indicated support of PDI optimisation (see subclause
8.2.25), the CP function may include in the forwarding parameters of the FAR
the Linked Traffic Endpoint ID, if it is available, identifying the traffic
Endpoint allocated for this Sx session to receive the traffic in the reverse
direction.
NOTE 4: This information can enable an SGW-U or PGW-U to correlate the UL and
DL traffic (i.e. PDRs) sent over a same bearer.
Assuming for instance an Sx session provisioned in a PGW-U with:
\- an UL PDR 1 (for an S5/S8 bearer 1) with Source Interface \"Access\"
associated to an UL Traffic Endpoint ID \"1\" (comprising the IP address, a
local TEID and optionally a network instance),
\- a DL PDR 1 with Source Interface \"Core\", UE IP address and SDF 1,
the CP function sets the Linked Traffic Endpoint in the DL FAR 1 (associated
to DL PDR 1) to the UL Traffic Endpoint \"1\", which allows the PGW-U to
correlate the uplink and downlink PDRs for the same bearer (i.e. that UL PDR 1
associated to UL Traffic Endpoint \"1\", and DL PDR1 associated to DL FAR 1
with Linked Traffic Endpoint set to UL Traffic Endpoint \"1\", use the same
S5/S8 bearer).
NOTE 5: The Linked Traffic Endpoint can possibly refer to a Traffic Endpoint
in the reverse direction requested to be created in the same PFCP request.
### 5.2.4 Buffering Action Rule Handling
#### 5.2.4.1 General
A BAR provides instructions to control the buffering behaviour of the UP
function for all the FARs of the Sx session set with an Apply Action parameter
requesting the packets to be buffered and associated to this BAR.
The CP function may create a BAR for an Sx session and associate it to the
FAR(s) of the Sx session in an Sx Session Establishment Request or an Sx
Session Modification Request to request the UP function to apply a specific
buffering behaviour for packets requested to be buffered and associated to
this BAR.
The CP function may modify the following buffering instructions provided in a
BAR as follows:
\- the Downlink Data Notification Delay in an Sx Session Modification Request;
or
\- the Downlink Data Notification Delay, DL Buffering Duration and/or DL
Buffering Suggested Packet Count in an Sx Session Report Response message.
NOTE: The CP function needs to provision a (possibly empty) BAR and associate
it to the FARs of the Sx session when establishing or modifying the Sx session
to be able to modify the BAR in an Sx Session Report Response.
In this release of the specification, at most one BAR may be created per Sx
session.
#### 5.2.4.2 Provisioning of Buffering Action Rule in the UP function
The CP function may provision the following buffering parameters in a BAR:
\- the Downlink Data Notification Delay IE, to request the UP function to
delay the sending of an Sx Session Report Request, between receiving a
downlink data packet and notifying the CP function about it, if the UP
function indicated support of the Downlink Data Notification Delay parameter
(see subclause 8.2.28);
\- the DL Buffering Duration IE, to request the UP function to buffer the
downlink data packet for an extended duration without sending any further
notification to the CP function about the arrival of DL data packets, if the
UP function indicated support of the DL Buffering Duration parameter (see
subclause 8.2.25);
\- the DL Buffering Suggested Packet Count, to request the UP function to
buffer the suggested number of downlink data packets, when extended buffering
of downlink data packet is required in the UP function.
The UP function shall stop applying the DL Buffering Duration and DL Buffering
Suggested Packet Count parameters and shall delete these parameters from the
BAR (without explicit request from the CP function) when extended buffering of
downlink data packets ends in the UP function.
NOTE: The CP function will provide the DL Buffering Duration and DL Buffering
Suggested Packet Count parameters again when re-invoking extended buffering of
downlink data packets.
### 5.2.5 QoS Enforcement Rule Handling
#### 5.2.5.1 General
The CP function shall provision QER(s) for an Sx session in an Sx Session
Establishment Request or an Sx Session Modification Request to request the UP
function to perform QoS enforcement of the user plane traffic.
#### 5.2.5.2 Provisioning of QoS Enforcement Rule in the UP function
The CP function may request the UP function to perform the following QoS
enforcement actions in a QER:
\- Gating Control, as specified in subclause 5.4.3;
\- QoS Control, i.e. MBR, GBR or Packet Rate enforcement, as specified in
subclause 5.4.4;
\- DL flow level marking for application detection, as specified in subclause
5.4.5;
\- SCI (Service Class Indicator) marking for service identification for
improved radio utilisation for GERAN, as specified in subclause 5.4.12.
### 5.2.6 Combined SGW/PGW Architecture
The usage of a combined SGW/PGW remains possible in a deployment with
separated control and user planes, see subclause 4.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
This is enabled by supporting a combined Sxa/Sxb interface with a common
packet forwarding model, message and parameter structure for non-combined and
combined cases.
The following additional requirements shall apply to a combined Sxa/Sxb
interface between a combined SGW/PGW-C and a combined SGW/PGW-U:
\- all the functionalities specified for Sxa and Sxb shall be supported,
possibly concurrently, over a combined Sxa/Sxb association;
\- a single Sx session may be setup to support both the functionalities of an
SGW-U and PGW-U;
\- the CP function may provision PDRs, QERs, URRs, FARs (possibly with a
buffering instruction) and BAR, possibly concurrently, for the same Sx
session;
\- the CP function may provision concurrently parameters in a message or for
the Sx session that are applicable to Sxa and Sxb.
## 5.3 Data Forwarding between the CP and UP Functions
### 5.3.1 General
Forwarding of user plane data between the CP and UP functions may take place
as part of the following scenarios (see 3GPP TS 23.214 [2]).
Table 5.3.1-1: Data forwarding scenarios between the CP and UP functions
+---+-----------------------+-----------------------+---------------+ | | Scenario description | Data forwarding | Applicable to | | | | direction | | +===+=======================+=======================+===============+ | 1 | Forwarding of | UP to CP function | PGW | | | user-plane packets | | | | | between the UE and | CP to UP function | | | | the CP function. | | | +---+-----------------------+-----------------------+---------------+ | 2 | Forwarding of packets | UP to CP function | PGW | | | between the CP | | | | | function and the | CP to UP function | | | | external PDN / Sgi. | | | +---+-----------------------+-----------------------+---------------+ | 3 | Forwarding of packets | UP to CP function | SGW | | | subject to buffering | | | | | in the CP function. | CP to UP function | | +---+-----------------------+-----------------------+---------------+ | 4 | Forwarding of End | CP to UP function | SGW, PGW | | | Marker Packets | | | | | constructed by the CP | | | | | function to a | | | | | downstream node. | | | +---+-----------------------+-----------------------+---------------+
User plane packets shall be forwarded between the CP and UP functions by
encapsulating the user plane packets using GTP-U encapsulation (see 3GPP TS
29.281 [3]).
For forwarding data from the UP function to the CP function, the CP function
shall provision PDR(s) per Sx session context, with the PDI identifying the
user plane traffic to forward to the CP function and with a FAR set with the
Destination Interface \"CP function side\" and set to perform GTP-U
encapsulation and to forward the packets to a GTP-u F-TEID uniquely assigned
in the CP function per Sx session and PDR. The CP function shall then identify
the PDN connection and the bearer to which the forwarded data belongs by the
F-TEID in the header of the encapsulating GTP-U packet.
For forwarding data from the CP function to the UP function, the CP function
shall provision one or more PDR(s) per Sx session context, with the PDI set
with the Source Interface \"CP function side\" and identifying the GTP-u
F-TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function per PDR, and with a FAR set to
perform GTP-U decapsulation and to forward the packets to the intended
destination. URRs and QERs may also be configured.
Sx session contexts may correspond to individual PDN connections, TDF
sessions, or standalone sessions not tied to any PDN connection or TDF session
used e.g. for forwarding RADIUS, Diameter or DHCP signalling between the PGW-C
and the PDN or for forwarding End Marker packets from the PGW-C or SGW-C to a
downstream SGW-U or eNodeB.
The CP function may establish one Sx-u tunnel per:
\- bearer of PDN connection e.g. for the data forwarding scenarios 1 and 3;
\- UP function or PDN e.g. for the data forwarding scenario 1, 2 and 4.
Requirements for forwarding packets subject to buffering in the CP function
between the UP and CP functions (scenario 3) are further specified in
subclause 5.3.3.
Requirements for sending End Marker packets (scenario 4) are further specified
in subclause 5.3.2.
### 5.3.2 Sending of End Marker Packets
The construction of End Marker packets may either be done in the CP function
or UP function, based on network configuration, as specified in subclause 5.8
of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2]. The support of End Marker packets by the UP function is
optional.
If the UP function indicated support of End Marker packets constructed in the
UP function, the CP function shall request the UP function to construct and
send End Marker packets by sending a Session Modification Request including
FAR(s) with the new downstream F-TEID and with the SNDEM (Send End Marker
Packets) flag set.
For End Marker packets constructed in the CP function, the CP function shall:
\- establish (once) one standalone Sx session not tied to any PDN connection,
per the UP function, for forwarding End Marker packets, and provision the UP
function to perform one GTP-U decapsulation and to forward the resulting
packets without any further change towards the destination IP address of these
packets;
\- construct the GTP-U End Marker packets, with the destination IP address and
TEID set according to the old F-TEID value, and with a source IP address set
according to the UP function\'s F-TEID value (e.g. S1 or Iu SGW F-TEID);
\- encapsulate the constructed GTP-U End Marker packets in GTP-U packets
according to the principles specified in subclause 5.3.1 for data forwarding
between the CP function and the UP function, and send them towards the F-TEID
assigned in the UP function for the above Sx session, after receipt of the Sx
Session Modification Response indicating that the UP function has switched to
a new F-TEID.
Upon receipt of an Sx Session Modification Request modifying the F-TEID in the
Outer Header Creation of a FAR, the UP function shall send the Response
message only after having switched to the new F-TEID.
### 5.3.3 Forwarding of Packets Subject to Buffering in the CP Function
#### 5.3.3.1 General
The following requirements shall apply to the data forwarding scenario 3 of
Table 5.3.1-1 in addition to the requirements specified in subclause 5.3.1.
The CP function shall establish one Sx-u tunnel per bearer of a PDN connection
when applying the data forwarding scenario 3.
#### 5.3.3.2 Forwarding of Packets from the UP Function to the CP Function
Regardless of whether the downlink traffic received by the UP function
consists of T-PDUs (i.e. user data packet, see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]) for a
combined SGW/PGW-U, or G-PDUs (i.e. T-PDU plus a GTP-U header) for a SGW-U,
the downlink traffic shall be forwarded from the UP function to the CP
function as G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID
uniquely assigned in the CP function for the Sx-u tunnel corresponding to the
bearer of the PDN connection.
NOTE 1: An SGW-U receiving G-PDUs from an S5/S8 bearer forwards the same
G-PDUs towards the SGW-C but with the IP address and TEID in the GTP-U header
changed to the SGW-C IP address and TEID of the corresponding Sx-u tunnel.
To forward the user plane data to be buffered in the CP function from the UP
function, the CP function shall provision:
\- a PDR per bearer of the PDN connection, matching the received downlink user
plane packets and for a (non-combined) SGW-U, with the field Outer Header
Removal Description in the Outer Header Removal IE set to \"0\" or \"1\" for
IPv4 or IPv6 respectively;
\- a FAR instructing the UP function to forward the received downlink data to
the CP function, with the field Outer Header Creation Description in the Outer
Header Creation set to \"0\" or \"1\".
NOTE 2: The PDR can be provisioned in the UP function before applying data
forwarding to the CP function.
G-PDUs sent from the UP function to the CP function over the Sx-u tunnel shall
include any GTP-U extension header(s):
\- possibly received by the UP function over the S5/S8 bearers and stored
during the Outer Header Removal;
\- possibly created by the UP function as part of a QER rule.
#### 5.3.3.3 Forwarding of Packets from the CP Function to the UP Function
Likewise, when subsequently sending the downlink traffic buffered in the CP
function back to the UP function, the downlink traffic shall be forwarded over
Sx-u as G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to the IP address and TEID uniquely
assigned in the UP function for the Sx-u tunnel set up for the corresponding
bearer of the PDN connection.
G-PDUs sent over Sx-u shall include GTP-U extension header(s) possibly
received earlier from the UP function.
To forward the user plane data from the CP function to the UP function, the CP
function shall provision:
a PDR per bearer of the PDN connection, with an IP address and TEID uniquely
assigned in the UP function for the Sx-u tunnel, and with the field Outer
Header Removal Description in the Outer Header Removal IE set to \"0\" or
\"1\";
\- a FAR enabling the UP function to forward the received downlink data from
the CP function towards the RAN, with the field Outer Header Creation
Description in the Outer Header Creation set to \"0\" or \"1\".
G-PDUs sent from the UP function towards the RAN shall include GTP-U extension
header(s) possibly received from the CP function.
### 5.3.4 Data Forwarding between the CP and UP Functions with one Sx-u Tunnel
per UP Function or PDN
#### 5.3.4.1 General
The following requirements shall apply to the data forwarding scenario 1 and 2
of Table 5.3.1-1, when establishing one Sx-u tunnel per UP function or PDN, in
addition to the requirements specified in subclause 5.3.1.
#### 5.3.4.2 Forwarding of Packets from the UP Function to the CP Function
Regardless of whether the traffic received by the UP function consists of
T-PDUs (i.e. user data packet, see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]) from SGi or G-PDUs
(i.e. T-PDU plus a GTP-U header) from the UE, the traffic shall be forwarded
from the UP function to the CP function as G-PDUs with the GTP-U header set to
the IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the CP function for the Sx-u
tunnel corresponding to the UP function or PDN.
To forward the user plane data to from the UP function, the CP function shall
provision:
\- a PDR per UP function or PDN, matching the received user plane packets and
for uplink traffic, optionally with the field Outer Header Removal Description
in the Outer Header Removal IE set to \"0\" or \"1\" for IPv4 or IPv6
respectively;
\- a FAR instructing the UP function to forward the received data to the CP
function, with the field Outer Header Creation Description in the Outer Header
Creation set to \"0\" or \"1\".
NOTE 2: The PDR can be provisioned in the UP function before applying data
forwarding to the CP function e.g. immediately after the Sx Association Setup
procedure.
#### 5.3.4.3 Forwarding of Packets from the CP Function to the UP Function
When sending user plane data from the CP function, the traffic shall be
forwarded over Sx-u as:
\- T-PDUs encapsulated in GTP-U with the GTP-U header set to the IP address
and TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function for the Sx-u tunnel set up for
the UP function or PDN for traffic to be sent towards SGi, or
\- G-PDUs encapsulated in GTP-U with the outer GTP-U header set to the IP
address and TEID uniquely assigned in the UP function for the Sx-u tunnel set
up for the UP function and with the inner GTP-U header set to the F-TEID
assigned by the downstreams GTP-U peer (e.g. SGW) to the bearer over which the
data shall be sent.
To forward the user plane data from the CP function to the UP function, the CP
function shall provision:
a PDR per UP function, with an IP address and TEID uniquely assigned in the UP
function for the Sx-u tunnel, and with the field Outer Header Removal
Description in the Outer Header Removal IE set to \"0\" or \"1\";
\- a FAR enabling the UP function to forward the received data from the CP
function.
## 5.4 Policy and Charging Control
### 5.4.1 General
This subclause describe how Policy and Charging Control requirements are
supported over the Sxa, Sxb and Sxc reference points.
### 5.4.2 Service Detection and Bearer Binding
Bearer binding is the procedure that associates service data flow(s) to an IP-
CAN bearer deemed to transport the service data flow. UL bearer binding
verification refers to the process of discarding uplink packets due to no
matching service data flow template for the uplink direction. See subclauses
6.1.1.4 and 6.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7].
Service detection is controlled over the Sxa, Sxb and Sxc reference points by
configuring Packet Detection Information in PDRs to match the intended service
data flows or application.
The mapping of DL traffic to bearers is achieved by configuring and
associating FARs to the downlink PDRs, with FARs set to forward the packets to
the appropriate downstream bearers (S5/S8 or S1/S12/S4/Iu).
Uplink bearer binding verification is achieved by configuring Packet Detection
Information in uplink PDRs containing the local F-TEID of the uplink bearer,
the UE IP address (source IP address to match for the incoming packet), and
the SDF filter(s) or the Application ID. As a result, uplink packets received
on the uplink bearer but that do not match the SDF filter(s) or Application
detection filter associated to the uplink PDRs are discarded.
> NOTE 1: For PCC Rules that contain an application identifier (i.e. that
> refer to an application detection filter), uplink traffic can be received on
> other IP-CAN bearers than the one determined by the binding mechanism. The
> detection of the uplink part of the service data flow can be activated in
> parallel on other bearers with non-GBR QCI (e.g. the default bearer) in
> addition to the bearer where the PCC rule is bound to. See subclauses
> 6.1.1.1 and 6.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]. Therefore, the uplink PDRs for
> these bearers can be provisioned with the PDI containing this service data
> flow and the local F-TEID of the uplink bearer.
>
> NOTE 2: To avoid the PGW-U discarding packets due to no matching service
> data flow template, the operator can apply open PCC rules (with wildcarded
> SDF filters) to allow for the passage of packets that do not match any other
> candidate SDF template. Therefore, an uplink PDR can be provisioned with the
> PDI containing only the local F-TEID of the uplink bearer.
>
> NOTE 3: Uplink bearer binding does not apply to Non-IP PDN connections.
### 5.4.3 Gating Control
Gating control refers to the process within the PGW-U and TDF-U of enabling or
disabling the forwarding of IP packets, belonging to a service data flow or
detected application\'s traffic, to pass through to the desired endpoint (see
subclause 4.3.2 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7]).
The PGW-C and TDF-C controls the gating in the PGW-U and TDF-U by creating
PDR(s) for the service data flow(s) or application\'s traffic to be detected,
and by associating a QER, including the Gate Status IE, to the PDRs.
The Gate Status IE indicates whether the service data flow or detected
application traffic is allowed to be forwarded (the gate is open) or shall be
discarded (the gate is closed) in the uplink and/or in downlink directions.
The PGW-U and TDF-U shall identify UL and DL flows by the Source Interface IE
in the PDI of the PDRs or the Destination Interface IE in the FARs. The PGW-U
and TDF-U shall apply UL and DL gating accordingly.
### 5.4.4 QoS Control
QoS control refers to the authorization and enforcement of the maximum QoS
that is authorized:
\- at the session level (APN-AMBR, TDF session UL and DL bitrates, or UL and
DL Packet Rate of a PDN connection);
\- at the bearer level (GBR, MBR for GBR bearers);
\- at the service data flow (SDF) or application level.
See subclause 4.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] subclause 4.5.5 of 3GPP TS 29.212
[8] and subclause 4.7.7 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [14].
The CP function shall control the QoS enforcement in the UP function by:
\- creating the necessary PDR(s) to represent the service data flow,
application, bearer or session, if not already existing;
\- creating QERs for the QoS enforcement at session level, SDF/application
level;
\- creating QERs for the QoS enforcement of the aggregate of SDFs with the
same GBR QCI;
\- associating the session level QER to all the PDRs defined for the session;
\- associating the SDF or application QER to the PDRs associated to the SDF or
application;
\- associating the QER of the aggregate of SDFs to the PDRs associated to SDFs
or applications that share the QER.
The same QER may be associated to UL and DL PDRs. The UP function shall
identify the UL and DL flows by the Source Interface IE in the PDRs or the
Destination Interface IE in the FARs. The UP function shall enforce the QoS
for the UL or DL flows accordingly.
The PGW-C shall map the precedence of a PCC rule to the precedence of the PDRs
associated to the corresponding service data flows.
### 5.4.5 DL Flow Level Marking for Application Detection
DL flow level marking is performed using DL DSCP marking. DL DSCP marking for
application indication refers to the process in the TDF of marking detected
downlink application traffic with a DSCP value received within an installed
ADC rule matching this traffic. See Annex U of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and
subclauses 4.5.2.7 and 4b.5.14 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
DL DSCP marking for application indication is controlled by the TDF-C by
associating a QER, including the ToS or Traffic Class within the DL Flow Level
Marking IE, to the PDR matching the DL traffic to be marked. The TDF-U
performs the DL DSCP marking for the detected DL traffic and sends the marked
packet to the PGW-U.
If a tunnelling protocol is used between the TDF-U and the PGW-U, the DSCP
value for service data flow detection shall be carried in the inner IP header.
The TDF-C may stop the DL DSCP marking for the application during the Sx
session by removing the related QER or removing the DL Flow Level Marking IE
from the related QER, the TDF-U shall then stop such function consequently.
Policy and charging control in the downlink direction by the PCEF for an
application detected by the TDF is performed by the PGW-C configuring a PDR
with a PDI containing an SDF Filter with the corresponding DSCP value.
### 5.4.6 Usage Monitoring
Usage Monitoring Control refers to the process of monitoring the user plane
traffic in the PGW-U or TDF-U for the accumulated usage of network resources
per:
\- individual or group of service data flows;
\- individual or group of applications;
\- IP-CAN session, possibly excluding an individual SDF or a group of service
data flow(s), and/or
\- TDF session, possibly excluding an individual application or a group of
application(s).
See subclauses 4.4, 6.2.2.3 and 6.6 of 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and subclauses
4.5.16, 4.5.17, 4b.5.6, 4b.5.7 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
Usage Monitoring Control is supported over the Sxb and Sxc reference points by
activating in the UP function the reporting of usage information towards the
CP function, as specified in subclauses 5.3 and 7.8.4 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
The CP function shall control the Usage Reporting in the UP function by:
\- creating the necessary PDR(s) to represent the service data flow,
application or session;
\- creating a URR for each Monitoring key; and
\- associating the URR to:
\- all the PDRs of the Sx session, for usage monitoring at IP-CAN or TDF
session level, possibly excluding the PDRs matching the SDFs or Applications
excluded from the usage monitoring at session level; or
\- the PDR(s) of the Sx session associated to the individual or group of
SDF(s) or Application(s), for usage monitoring at SDF or application level.
### 5.4.7 Traffic Redirection
Traffic Redirection refers to the process of redirecting uplink application
traffic, in a PGW or TDF, towards a redirect destination, e.g. redirect some
HTTP flows to a service provisioning page. See subclause 6.1.13 of 3GPP TS
23.203 [7] and subclauses 4.5.2.6 and 4b.5.1.4 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The redirect destination may be provided by the PCRF or be preconfigured in
the CP function or in the UP function.
The traffic redirection may be enforced in the CP function or in the UP
function. If the traffic that the UP function can support may be subject to
traffic redirection, traffic redirection enforcement in the UP function shall
be supported by the UP function. The UP function reports to the CP function
whether it supports traffic redirection enforcement in the UP function via the
UP Function Features IE (see subclause 8.2.25).
NOTE: A UP function that supports traffic not requiring traffic redirection
does not need to support traffic redirection enforcement in the UP function.
The CP function can select a UP function supporting traffic redirection
enforcement in the UP function for users or services which may require traffic
redirection.
To enforce the traffic redirection in the CP function, the CP function shall
instruct the UP function to forward the applicable user traffic to the CP
function, as specified in subclause 5.3.1.
To enforce the traffic redirection in the UP function, the CP function shall:
\- create the necessary PDR(s) to represent the traffic to be redirected, if
not already existing;
\- create a FAR with:
\- the Redirect Information IE including the redirect destination, if the
traffic needs to be redirected towards a redirect destination provided by the
CP function; a redirect destination provided by the CP function shall prevail
over a redirect destination preconfigured in the UP function; or
\- the Forwarding Policy IE including the identifier of the forwarding policy
to apply, if the traffic needs to be redirected towards a redirect destination
preconfigured in the UP function;
\- For HTTP traffic redirection, the Redirection Address Type shall be set to
\"URL\" and the CP function shall set the Destination Interface IE in the FAR
to \"Access\" (to forward the HTTP response message with a status code
indicating redirect). For other types of traffic redirection, the Destination
Interface IE in the FAR may be set to \"Core\".
\- associate the FAR to the above PDRs of the Sx session.
### 5.4.8 Traffic Steering
Traffic Steering refers to the process of applying a specific (S)Gi-LAN
traffic steering policy in the PCEF or TDF (or TSSF), for the purpose of
steering the subscriber\'s traffic to appropriate operator or 3rd party
service functions (e.g. NAT, antimalware, parental control, DDoS protection)
in the (S)Gi-LAN, per service data flows level or applications level.
The UP function shall set the TRST feature flag in the UP Function Features IE
if it supports Traffic Steering (see subclause 8.2.25).
Traffic Steering is supported over the Sxb and Sxc reference points by
instructing the UP function to apply a specific Forwarding Policy, that is
locally configured in the UP function and that can be used for the uplink, the
downlink or for both directions. A Forwarding Policy is identified by a
Forwarding Policy Identifier.
When so instructed, the UP function shall perform the necessary actions to
enforce the forwarding policy referenced by the CP function, e.g. performing
packet marking and routing the traffic towards the service functions within
the (S)Gi-LAN.
See 3GPP TS 23.203 [7] and 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The CP function shall control Traffic Steering towards SGi-LAN in the UP
function by:
\- creating the necessary PDRs to represent the service data flows or
applications to be steered towards SGi-LAN;
\- creating a FAR with the Forwarding Policy IE including the Forwarding
Policy Identifier set to the Traffic Steering Policy Identifier; and
\- associating the FAR to the above PDRs of the Sx session.
The CP function shall control the processing of the traffic received from the
(S)Gi-LAN in the UP function as specified in the rest of this specification
for traffic received from any other interface, but with PDR(s) including a PDI
with the Source Interface indicating \"SGi-LAN\". The UP function shall
distinguish packets coming from (S)Gi-LAN based on local configuration.
### 5.4.9 Provisioning of Predefined PCC/ADC Rules
A Predefined PCC rule is preconfigured in the PCEF, e.g. a PGW. Predefined PCC
rules can be activated or deactivated by the PCRF at any time. The Predefined
PCC rules may be grouped allowing the PCRF to dynamically activate a set of
PCC rules.
A predefined ADC rule is preconfigured in the TDF. In the case of solicited
reporting, the Predefined ADC rules can be activated or deactivated by the
PCRF at any time. Predefined ADC rules within the TDF may be grouped allowing
the PCRF to dynamically activate a set of ADC rules.
See subclauses 4.3.1 and 4b.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The CP function may enforce an activated predefined PCC or ADC rule by the
PCRF in the UP function by:
\- determining the service data filters or application IDs referred by the
activated predefined PCC or ADC rule(s) and the corresponding QoS and charging
control information respectively;
\- creating the necessary PDR(s) to identify the service data flow(s),
application(s) that the predefined PCC or ADC rule refer to, if not already
existing;
\- creating the necessary QER for the QoS enforcement at service data flow or
application level accordingly;
\- creating the necessary FAR if a new FAR needs to be created as result of
Bearer binding and QoS control for forwarding the detected service data flow
or application traffic, or to redirect or to apply traffic steering control if
included in the predefined PCC/ADC rule;
\- creating the necessary URR(s) for each monitoring key, charging key,
combination of Charging Key and Service ID, or combination of Charging Key,
Sponsor ID and Application Service Provider Id if included in the predefined
PCC or ADC rule;
And then:
\- associating the created URR(s) to the newly created PDR(s);
\- associating the existing FAR or the new FAR to the newly created PDR(s);
Optionally, the traffic handling policies (i.e. predefined
QER(s)/FAR(s)/URR(s)) may be configured in the UP function. The CP function
may activate these traffic handling policies by including the Activate
Predefined Rules IE within:
\- the Create PDR IE in an Sx session establishment request; or
\- the Update PDR IE in an Sx Session Modification Request.
For traffic matching PDR(s) associated with the activated predefined rules,
the UP function shall enforce the rules, e.g. for URR, the UP function shall
generate Usage Report(s) and send it to the CP function and the CP function
shall be able to handle the usage reports as described in subclause 5.2.2.
NOTE: The URR IDs used in reports triggered by a predefined rule in UP
function are also pre-configured at the CP function.
For deactivating predefined rules which are activated in the UP function, the
CP function shall include the Deactivate Predefined Rules IE in the Update PDR
IE in an Sx Session Modification request to inform the UP function to
deactivate the corresponding predefined rules for the related PDR.
### 5.4.10 Charging
The charging requirements for online and offline charging in the PS domain
specified in 3GPP TS 32.251 [17] shall be preserved with a split SGW, PGW and
TDF architecture.
Charging is supported by the CP function by activating in the UP function the
measurement and reporting of the accumulated usage of network resources per:
\- IP-CAN bearer, for an SGW;
\- IP-CAN bearer, IP-CAN session and/or individual or group of service data
flows, for a PGW;
\- TDF session and/or individual or group of applications, for a TDF.
See subclauses 5.3 and 7.8.4 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
The CP function shall control the usage measurement and reporting in the UP
function by:
\- creating the necessary PDR(s) to represent the service data flow,
application, bearer or session, if not already existing;
\- creating URR(s) for each Charging Key, combination of Charging Key and
Service ID, or combination of Charging Key, Sponsor ID and Application Service
Provider Id;
\- associating the URR(s) to the relevant PDRs defined for the Sx session, for
usage reporting at IP-CAN bearer, IP-CAN session, TDF session, SDF or
application level.
For online charging, the CP function shall provision the URR with the Volume
(or Time) Quota, and with the Volume (or Time) Quota if a quota threshold was
received from the OCS, as specified in subclause 5.2.2.2. Besides, when the
OCS provides a final quota and requests to redirect the traffic towards a
redirect destination when exhausing this quota, the CP function shall redirect
the traffic towards a redirect destination as specified in subclause 5.4.7
upon being notified that the final quota has been reached; to permit HTTP
traffic redirection, the UP function should have at least one HTTP packet,
e.g. the UP function may store one packet when reaching the Volume (or Time)
Quota. An example call flow is depicted in Annex C.2.1.1.
To avoid the risk of signalling storms between the CP and UP functions at
times of tariff change, the CP function may include the Monitoring Time IE and
zero or more Additional Monitoring IEs in the URR and set it to the time of
tariff change to request the UP function to report separately the resource
usage before and after the time of tariff change (see e.g. subclause 6.3.7.1
of 3GPP TS 32.299 [18]).
### 5.4.11 (Un)solicited Application Reporting
(Un)solicited Application Reporting refers to the process of reporting the
start or stop of applications by the TDF or PCEF. See 3GPP TS 23.203 [3] and
3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The CP function shall instruct the UP function to detect and report
applications by:
\- creating the necessary PDR(s) to represent the applications to detect;
\- creating a URR with the Reporting Trigger IE set to detect the start and/or
stop of Traffic;
\- associating the URR to the PDR.
For unsolicited application reporting, an Sx session which is not linked to
any specific TDF session may be established and the PDI in the PDR(s) does not
contain any UE IP address.
When detecting the start or stop of an application, the UP function shall then
initiate the Sx Session Report procedure and send a Usage Report with the
Usage Report Trigger set to \'Start of Traffic\' or \'Stop of Traffic\'. The
UP function shall also include the following information in the Usage Report:
\- when reporting the start of an application:
\- the Application ID;
\- the Flow Information including the Flow Description and the Flow Direction,
if the traffic flow information is deducible;
\- the Application-Instance-Identifier, if the traffic flow information is
deducible; and
\- if no UE IP address was provisioned in the PDI, the UE\'s IP address, and
the Network instance when multiple PDNs with overlapping IP addresses are used
in the UP function.
NOTE: When the CP function instructs the UP function to perform unsolicited
application reporting, the PDI in the corresponding PDR has no UE IP address.
\- when reporting the stop of an application:
\- the Application ID;
\- the Application-Instance-Identifier, if an Application Identifier was
provided when reporting the start of the application;
\- if no UE IP address was provisioned in the PDI, the UE\'s IP address, and
the Network instance when multiple PDNs with overlapping IP addresses are used
in the UP function.
The UP function shall only report the Application ID when detecting the start
or stop of an application and the Reduced Application Detection Information
flag is set in the Measurement Information of the URR, e.g. for envelope
reporting.
### 5.4.12 Service Identification for Improved Radio Utilisation for GERAN
Service Identification for improved radio utilization for GERAN refers to the
process in the PGW of marking DL user plane traffic with a Service Class
Indicator (SCI) value. See subclause 5.3.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.060 [19].
This is controlled by the PGW-C by associating a QER, including the Service
Class Indicator within the DL Flow Level Marking IE, to the PDR matching the
DL traffic to be marked. The PGW-U performs the SCI marking for the detected
DL traffic and sends the packet with the GTP-U Service Class Indicator
Extension Header downstreams.
The PGW-C may stop the SCI marking during the Sx session by removing the
related QER or removing the DL Flow Level Marking IE from the related QER, the
PGW-U shall then stop such function consequently.
### 5.4.13 Transport Level Marking
Transport level marking is performed on a per EPS bearer basis in the SGW and
PGW. Transport level marking refers to the process of marking EPS bearer
traffic with a DSCP value based on the locally configured mapping from the QCI
and optionally ARP.
Transport level marking shall be controlled by the CP function by providing
the DSCP in the ToS or Traffic Class within the Transport Level Marking IE in
the FAR that is associated to the PDR matching the traffic to be marked. The
UP function shall perform the transport level marking for the detected traffic
and sends the marked packet to the peer entity.
The CP function may change transport level marking by changing the Transport
Level Marking IE in the related FAR.
## 5.5 F-TEID Allocation and Release
### 5.5.1 General
F-TEID shall be allocated either by the CP function or the UP function. The
support of F-TEID allocation by the CP function is mandatory. The support of
F-TEID allocation by the UP function is optional. See subclause 5.4 of 3GPP TS
23.214 [2].
The UP function shall set the FTUP feature flag in the UP Function Features IE
if it supports F-TEID allocation in the UP function (see subclause 8.2.25). If
so, the CP function shall determine whether F-TEIDs are allocated by the CP
function or the UP function based on network configuration. The same F-TEID
allocation option shall be used by all the CP functions controlling a
particular UP function. The UP function shall reject a request to establish a
new PDR with a different F-TEID allocation option than the option used for
already created PDRs (by the same or a different CP function), with the cause
\"Invalid F-TEID allocation option\".
### 5.5.2 F-TEID allocation in the CP function
When performing F-TEID allocation in the CP function, the CP function shall
assign the Local F-TEID IE of the PDR IE (see Table 7.5.2.2-1) and provide the
assigned F-TEID value to the UP function.
### 5.5.3 F-TEID allocation in the UP function
When performing F-TEID allocation in the UP function, the CP function shall
request the UP function to allocate the F-TEID by setting the CHOOSE flag in
the Local F-TEID IE of the PDR IE (see Table 7.5.2.2-1). The Source Interface
IE indicates for which interface the F-TEID is to be assigned.
The CP function may request the UP function to allocate the same F-TEID to
several PDRs to be created within one single Sx Session Establishment Request
or Sx Session Modification Request by:
\- setting the CHOOSE flag in the Local F-TEID IE of each PDR to be created
with a new F-TEID, and
\- setting the CHOOSE ID field of the Local F-TEID IE, for each PDR to be
created with the same F-TEID, with the same CHOOSE ID value.
or, if the UP function indicated support of the PDI optimization (see
subclause 8.2.25), by:
\- including the Local F-TEID IE only in the Create Traffic Endpoint IE and by
setting the CHOOSE flag in the Local F-TEID IE of this IE; and
\- including the Traffic Endpoint ID in all the PDRs to be created with the
same F-TEID.
If the PDR(s) is created successfully, the UP function shall return the
F-TEID(s) it has assigned to the PDR(s) or to the Traffic Endpoint(s) in the
Sx Session Establishment Response or Sx Session Modification Response.
Upon receiving a request to remove a PDR or a Traffic Endpoint or to delete an
Sx session, the UP function shall free the F-TEID(s) that was assigned to the
PDR, to the Traffic Endpoint or to the Sx Session.5.6 Sx Session Handling
### 5.6.1 General
The following subclauses provide details on Sx Sessions handling.
### 5.6.2 Session Endpoint Identifier Handling
The SEID uniquely identifies an Sx session at an IP address of a PFCP entity.
The F-SEID is the Fully Qualified SEID and it contains the SEID and IP
address. The PFCP endpoint locally assigns the SEID value the peer PFCP side
has to use when transmitting message. The SEID values are exchanged between
PFCP endpoints using PFCP messages. The PFCP entity communicates to the peer
PFCP entity the SEID value at which it expects to receive all subsequent
control plane messages related to that Sx session via the \"F-SEID\" IE.
The Sx session related messages shall share the same F-SEID for the Sx
session. A F-SEID shall be released after the Sx session is released.
### 5.6.3 Modifying the Rules of an Existing Sx Session
The following principles shall apply, unless specified otherwise in the
specification.
When modifying an existing Sx session, the CP function shall only provide in
the PFCP Request message the requested changes compared to what was previously
provisioned in the UP function for this Sx session, i.e. the CP function
shall:
\- include IEs which needs to be newly provisioned in the UP function;
\- include IEs which need to be provisioned with a modified value;
\- remove IEs which need to be removed from the set of parameters previously
provisioned in the UP function, as further specified below.
The CP function shall remove IEs which needs to be removed by either:
\- removing the entire Rule if no other parameter of that rule needs to remain
provisioned in the UP function, e.g. by including the Remove URR IE in the Sx
Session Modification Request; or
\- updating the Rule including the IEs to be removed with a null length, e.g.
by including the Update URR IE in the Sx Session Modification Request with the
IE(s) to be removed with a null length.
The CP function shall set a URR ID and/or QER ID with a length \"0\" in the
Update PDR IE within Sx Session Modification Request, to request the UP
function to stop applying the URRs and/or QERs for this PDR.
Upon receipt of an PFCP Request which modifies an existing Sx session, the UP
function shall add, update or remove the parameters as instructed by the CP
function, as defined above, and shall keep unchanged the set of parameters
previously provisioned in the UP function which are neither modified nor
removed.
## 5.7 Support of Lawful Interception
Requirements for support of Lawful Interception with a split SGW or PGW are
specified in subclauses 12.9 and 20.4 of 3GPP TS 33.107 [20].
User plane packets shall be forwarded from the UP function to the SX3LIF (or
LMISF for S8HR) by encapsulating the user plane packets using GTP-U
encapsulation (see 3GPP TS 29.281 [3]).
The CP function shall instruct the UP function to duplicate the packets to be
intercepted and to forward them to the SX3LIF (or to the LMISF for S8HR) as
specified in subclause 5.2.3.
For forwarding data from the UP function to the SX3LIF (or LMISF for S8HR),
the CP function shall set the DUPL flag in the Apply Action and set the
Duplicating Parameters in the FAR, associated to the PDRs of the traffic to be
intercepted, with the Destination Interface \"LI Function\" and set to perform
GTP-U encapsulation and to forward the packets to a GTP-u F-TEID uniquely
assigned in the SX3LIF (or LMISF for S8HR) for the traffic to be intercepted.
The SX3LIF (or LMISF for S8HR) shall then identify the intercepted traffic by
the F-TEID in the header of the encapsulating GTP-U packet.
## 5.8 Sx Association
### 5.8.1 General
An Sx Association shall be set up between the CP function and the UP function
prior to establishing Sx sessions on that UP function. Only one Sx association
shall be setup between a given pair of CP and UP functions, even if the CP
and/or UP function exposes multiple IP addresses.
The CP function and the UP function shall support the Sx Association Setup
procedure initiated by the CP function (see subclause 6.2.6.2). The CP
function and the UP function may additionally support the Sx Association Setup
procedure initiated by the UP function (see subclause 6.2.6.3).
A CP function may have Sx Associations set up with multiple UP functions. A UP
function may have Sx Associations set up with multiple CP functions.
A CP function or a UP function shall be identified by a unique Node ID. A Node
ID may be set to an FQDN or an IP address (see subclause 8.2.38).
Prior to establishing an Sx Association, the function responsible for
establishing the Sx Association (e.g. CP function) shall look up a peer
function (e.g. UP function), e.g using DNS procedures (see 3GPP TS 29.303
[25]), or local configuration. If the peer function is found to support
multiple IP addresses (in the look up information), one of these addresses
(any one) shall be used as destination IP address to send the Sx Association
Setup Request. Once the Sx Association is established, any of the IP addresses
of the peer function (found during the look-up) may then be used to send
subsequent Sx node related messages and Sx session establishment requests for
that Sx Association.
NOTE 1: The look up information (e.g. in DNS or local configuration of the
function responsible for establishing the Sx association) needs to be
configured consistently with the addressing information of the peer function.
If a FQDN is configured to identify a function in DNS, then the Node ID of
that function included in PFCP messages need to be set to the same FQDN. For
instance, if the CP function is responsible for establishing the Sx
association, a UP function that exposes multiple IP addresses (for Sx node
related messages and Sx session establishment requests) needs to be configured
in the look up information as one (single) UP function that is associated to
multiple IP addresses.
NOTE 2: Sx session related messages for sessions that are already established
are sent to the IP address received in the F-SEID allocated by the peer
function. This IP address need not be configured in the look up information.
See subclause 4.3.2 and 4.3.3.
### 5.8.2 Behaviour with an Established Sx Association
When an Sx Association is established with a UP function, the CP function:
\- shall provision node related parameters (i.e. parameters that apply to all
Sx sessions) in the UP function, if any, e.g. PFDs;
\- shall provision the UP function with the list of features (affecting the UP
function behaviour) the CP function supports, if any, e.g. support of load
and/or overload control;
\- shall check the responsiveness of the UP function using the Heartbeat
procedure as specified in subclause 6.2.2;
\- may establish Sx sessions on that UP function;
\- shall refrain from attempting to establish new Sx sessions on the UP
function, if the UP function has indicated it will shut down gracefully.
When an Sx Association is established with a CP function, the UP function:
\- shall update the CP function with the list of features it supports;
\- shall update the CP function with its load and/or overload control
information, if load and/or overload control is supported by the CP and UP
functions;
\- may update the CP function with the set of its IP resources available for
use by the CP function, when F-TEID allocation is performed by the CP
function;
NOTE: The CP function can be aware of the available IP resources in the UP
function e.g. based on the UP function reporting this information over Sx
using Sx node related messages, or by other implementation specific means.
\- shall accept Sx Session related messages from that CP function (unless
prevented by other reasons, e.g. overload);
\- shall check the responsiveness of the CP function using the Heartbeat
procedure as specified in subclause 6.2.2;
\- shall indicate to the CP function if it will shut down within a graceful
period and, when possible, if it fails and becomes out of service.
### 5.8.3 Behaviour without an Established Sx Association
When an Sx Association is not established with a UP function, the CP function:
\- shall reject any incoming Sx Session related messages from that UP
function, with a cause indicating that no Sx association exists with the peer
entity.
When an Sx Association is not yet established with a CP function, the UP
function:
\- shall reject any incoming Sx Session related messages from that CP
function, with a cause indicating that no Sx association exists with the peer
entity.
## 5.9 Usage of Vendor-specific IE
Vendor-specific IEs are defined to cover requirements and features not
specified by 3GPP.
NOTE 1: When a IE is intended to be used by more than one vendor, the
definition of the IE is encouraged to be specified by 3GPP to ease
implementation and interoperability.
NOTE 2: The PFCP entities can use Vendor-specific IE(s) in the Sx message
relevant to the Sx Association Setup procedure to learn which vendor specific
enhancements are supported by the peer.
In a network with Vendor specific enhancements, unrecognized vendor specific
IEs shall be handled as unknown optional IEs.
## 5.10 Error Indication Handling
Upon receipt of a GTP-U Error Indication message, the UP function:
\- shall identify the related Sx session for which the message is received;
and
\- shall initiate an Sx Session Report procedure, towards the CP function
controlling this Sx session, to send an Error Indication Report including the
remote F-TEID signalled in the GTP-U Peer Address IE and the Tunnel Endpoint
Identifier Data I IE of the GTP-U Error Indication (see subclause 7.3.1 of
3GPP TS 29.281 [3]).
Upon receipt of an Error Indication Report, the CP function shall then
identify the bearer for which the Error Indication Report is received using
the remote F-TEID included in the report and proceed as specified in
subclauses 21.7 and 21.8 of 3GPP TS 23.007 [24], i.e.:
\- modify the Sx session to instruct the UP function to buffer DL packets;
\- modify the Sx session to delete the PDR and FAR, when having to delete a
bearer; or
\- delete the Sx session, when having to delete the PDN connection.
## 5.11 User plane inactivity detection and reporting
**Subclause 5.4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [14] requires the PGW to** initiate the
**release of an inactive emergency PDN connection**.
The CP function may request the UP function to detect and report when no user
plane packets are received for an Sx session, by provisioning the User Plane
Inactivity Timer IE in the Sx Session Establishment Request or Sx Session
Modification Request.
Upon being provisioned with this IE, the UP function shall monitor the user
plane activity of the Sx session, and report any user plane inactivity
exceeding the duration indicated by this IE by sending an Sx Session Report
Request with the Report Type set to UPIR (User Plane Inactivity Report). The
UP function shall then continue to process any further user plane packets as
instructed by the rules provisioned for the Sx session, until receiving any
new instruction from the CP function.
## 5.12 Suspend and Resume Notification procedures
Upon receipt of a Suspend Notification message, the PGW-C should request the
PGW-U to discard packets received for the suspended PDN connection by:
\- setting the DROP flag in the Apply Action IE of the FARs of the
corresponding Sx session, or
\- setting the gate fields in the Gate Status IE of QERs to the value CLOSED.
Upon being requested to resume the PDN connection, the PGW-C should re-allow
the PGW-U to forward the packets for the PDN connection (unless not permitted
for other reasons) by:
\- setting the FORW flag in the Apply Action IE of the FARs of the
corresponding Sx session or
\- setting the gate fields in the Gate Status IE of QERs to the value OPEN.
## 5.13 Void
## 5.14 Support IPv6 Prefix Delegation
**Subclause 5.3.1.2.6 of 3GPP TS 23.401 [14] specifies the requirements for
IPv6 Prefix Delegation via DHCPv6, that allow assigning a single network
prefix shorter than the default /64 prefix to a PDN connection.**
**When assigning additional IPv6 prefixes (i.e. prefixes in addition to the
default prefix) to a UE, the CP function shall provision/update the UE IP
Address IE in the UP function with the IPv6D flag set to \"1\" and IPv6 Prefix
Delegation Bits field to indicating the length of IPv6 Prefix for
delegation.**
# 6 Procedures
## 6.1 Introduction
The following subclauses specify the procedures supported over the Sxa, Sxb
and Sxc reference points.
## 6.2 Sx Node Related Procedures
### 6.2.1 General
The following subclauses specify the node related procedures over the Sxa, Sxb
and Sxc reference points. The behaviour of the CP function und UP function
when sending and receiving a node related message is described.
### 6.2.2 Heartbeat Procedure
#### 6.2.2.1 General
Two messages are specified for PFCP heartbeat procedure: Heartbeat Request and
Heartbeat Response. The use of these messages is further specified in clause
19A of 3GPP TS 23.007 [24].
#### 6.2.2.2 Heartbeat Request
The CP function or the UP function may send an Heartbeat Request on a path to
the peer node to find out if it is alive. Heartbeat Request messages may be
sent for each peer with which an Sx control association is established.
For each peer with which an Sx control association is established, a CP
function or UP function shall be prepared to receive an Heartbeat Request at
any time and it shall reply with an Heartbeat Response.
#### 6.2.2.3 Heartbeat Response
The message shall be sent as a response to a received Heartbeat Request.
### 6.2.3 Load Control Procedure
#### 6.2.3.1 General
Load Control is an optional feature defined over the Sxa, Sxb and Sxc
reference points.
Load control enables the UP function to send its load information to the CP
function to adaptively balance the Sx session load across the UP functions
according to their effective load. The load information reflects the operating
status of the resources of the UP function.
Load control allows for better balancing of the Sx session load, so as to
attempt to prevent overload in the first place (preventive action). Load
control does not trigger overload mitigation actions even if the UP function
reports a high load.
Load control and overload control may be supported and activated independently
in the network, based on operator\'s policy.
#### 6.2.3.2 Principles
The UP function may signal its Load Control Information to reflect the
operating status of its resources, at the node level, allowing the receiving
CP function to use this information to augment the UP function selection
procedures.
The Load Control Information is piggybacked in PFCP request or response
messages such that the exchange of Load Control Information does not trigger
extra signalling.
NOTE: The inclusion of Load Control Information in existing messages means
that the frequency of transmission of load control information increases as
the session load increases, allowing for faster feedback and thus better
regulation of the load.
The calculation of the Load Control Information is implementation dependent
and its calculation and transfer shall not add significant additional load to
the node itself and to its corresponding peer nodes.
#### 6.2.3.3 Load Control Information
##### 6.2.3.3.1 General Description
A PFCP message may contain one instance of the Load Control Information (LCI)
IE.
When providing load control information in a message for the first time or
subsequently, the UP function shall always include the full set of load
control information, i.e. all the node level instance of the Load Control
Information, even if only a subset of the load control information has
changed. The Load Control Sequence Number shall be incremented whenever the
load control information is changed (see subclause 6.2.3.3.2.1).
Load Control Information shall be linked to the Node ID (i.e. FQDN or the IP
address used during the UP function selection) of the UP function providing
the Information.
The receiver shall overwrite any stored load control information of a peer
with the newly received load control information from the same peer node if
the new load control information is more recent than the old information as
indicated by the Load Control Sequence Number, e.g. if the receiver has stored
an instance of the load control information for a peer node, it overwrites
this instance with the new instance received in a message from the same peer
node.
The receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same instance
of the LCI IE in conjunction while using this information for UP function
selection.
The parameters are further defined in subclause 6.2.3.3.2.
Load control information may be extended with new parameters in future
versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be categorized
as:
\- Non-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is _not
critical_ for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and correctly
comprehend the load control information instance, containing one or more of
these parameters, by using the other parameters and ignoring the non-critical
optional parameter.
\- Critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is _critical_
for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the load control
information containing one or more of these parameters.
The sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameters within any
instance of the LCI IE without having the knowledge of the receiver\'s
capability to support the same. However, the sender shall only include one or
more critical optional parameter in an instance of the LCI IE towards a
receiver if the corresponding receiver is known to support those parameters.
The sender may be aware of this either via signalling methods or by
configuration (this will have to be defined when introducing any such new
parameter in future).
##### 6.2.3.3.2 Parameters
###### 6.2.3.3.2.1 Load Control Sequence Number
The Load Control Sequence number contains a value that indicates the sequence
number associated with the LCI IE. This sequence number shall be used to
differentiate any two LCI IEs generated at two different instances by the same
UP function. The Load Control Sequence Number shall be supported (if load
control is supported) and shall always be present in the LCI IE.
The UP function generating this information shall increment the Load Control
Sequence Number whenever modifying some information in the Load Control
Information IE. The Load Control Sequence Number shall not be incremented
otherwise. The UP function may use the time, represented in an unsigned
integer format, of the generation of the Load Control Information to populate
the Load Control Sequence Number.
This parameter shall be used by the receiver of the Load Control Information
IE to properly collate out-of-order load control information, e.g. due to PFCP
retransmissions. This parameter shall also be used by the receiver of the LCI
IE to determine whether the newly received load control information has
changed compared to load control information previously received from the same
node earlier.
NOTE: The PFCP sequence number cannot be used for collating out-of-order load
control information as e.g. load control information may be sent in both PFCP
requests and responses, using independent PFCP sequence numbering.
If the receiving entity has already received and stored load control
information from the peer UP function, the receiving CP function shall update
its load control information only if the Load Control Sequence Number received
in the new load control information is higher than the stored value of the
Load Control Sequence Number associated with the peer UP function. However due
to roll-over of the Load Control Sequence Number or restart of the node, the
Load Control Sequence Number may be reset to an appropriate base value by the
peer UP function, hence the receiving entity shall be prepared to receive (and
process) a Load Control Sequence Number parameter whose value is less than the
previous value.
###### 6.2.3.3.2.2 Load Metric
The Load Metric parameter shall indicate the current load level of the
originating node. The computation of the Load Metric is left to
implementation. The node may consider various aspects, such as the used
capacity of the UP function, the load in the node (e.g. memory/CPU usage in
relationship to the total memory/CPU available, etc.).
The Load Metric represents the current load level of the sending node as a
percentage within the range of 0 to100, where 0 means no or 0% load and 100
means maximum or 100% load reached (i.e. no further load is desirable).
The Load Metric shall be supported (if load control is supported). The Load
Metric shall always be included in the Load Control Information.
Considering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Load Control
Information (e.g. handling of the new information, tuning the node selection
algorithm to take the new information into account), the sender should refrain
from advertising every small variation (e.g. with the granularity of 1 or 2),
in the Load Metric which does not result in useful improvement in node
selection logic at the receiver. During the typical operating condition of the
sender, a larger variation in the Load Metric, e.g. 5 or more units, should be
considered as reasonable enough for advertising the new Load Control
Information and thus justifying the processing requirement (to handle the new
information) of the receiver.
NOTE: The range of the Load Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not mandate the sender
to collect its own load information at every increment/decrement and hence to
advertise the change of Load Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various
implementation specific criteria, such as: the architecture, session and
signalling capacity, the current load and so on, the sender is free to define
its own logic and periodicity with which its own load information is
collected.
#### 6.2.3.3.3 Frequency of Inclusion
How often the sender includes the load control information is implementation
specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated load control information is
propagated to the target CP functions within an acceptable delay, such that
the purpose of the information (i.e. effective load balancing) is achieved.
The sender may include the LCI IE e.g. as follows:
\- the sender may include Load Control Information towards a peer only when
the new/changed value has not already been provided to that peer;
\- the sender may include the Load Control Information in each and every
message (extended with LCI IE) towards the peer;
\- the sender may include Load Control Information periodically, i.e. include
the information during a first period then cease to do so during a second
period.
The sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above
approaches. Besides, the sender may also decide to include the Load Control
Information only in a subset of the applicable PFCP messages.
The receiver shall be prepared to receive the load control information in any
of the PFCP messages extended with an LCI IE and upon such reception, shall be
able act upon the received load control information.
### 6.2.4 Overload Control Procedure
#### 6.2.4.1 General
Overload Control is an optional feature defined over the Sxa, Sxb and Sxc
reference points.
Overload control enables a UP function becoming or being overloaded to
gracefully reduce its incoming signalling load by instructing its peer CP
functions to reduce sending traffic according to its available signalling
capacity to successfully process the traffic. A UP function is in overload
when it operates over its signalling capacity which results in diminished
performance (including impacts to handling of incoming and outgoing traffic).
Overload control aims at shedding the incoming traffic as close to the traffic
source as possible generally when an overload has occurred (reactive action),
so to avoid spreading the problem inside the network and to avoid using
resources of intermediate nodes in the network for signalling that would
anyhow be discarded by the overloaded node.
Load control and overload control may be supported and activated independently
in the network, based on operator\'s policy.
#### 6.2.4.2 Principles
When a UP function determines that the offered incoming signalling traffic is
growing (or is about to grow) beyond its nominal capacity, the UP function may
signal its overload, at node level granularity, to its peer CP functions by
including Overload Control Information in PFCP signalling which provides
guidance to the receiving CP functions to decide actions which lead to
signalling traffic mitigation towards the sender of the information. This
helps in preventing severe overload and hence potential breakdown of the UP
function.
The Overload Control Information is piggybacked in PFCP request or response
messages such that the exchange of Overload Control Information does not
trigger extra signalling.
NOTE: The inclusion of Overload Control Information in existing messages means
that the frequency of transmission of overload control information increases
as the signalling load increases, thus allowing for faster feedback and better
regulation.
The calculation of the Overload Control Information is implementation
dependent and its calculation and transfer shall not add significant
additional load to the node itself and to its corresponding peer nodes. The
calculation of Overload Control Information should not severely impact the
resource utilization of the UP function, especially considering the overload
situation.
The overload control feature should continue to allow for preferential
treatment of priority users (eMPS) and emergency services.
The overload mitigation actions based on the reception of the overload related
information received from the UP function will not be standardized.
#### 6.2.4.3 Overload Control Information
##### 6.2.4.3.1 General Description
A PFCP message may contain one instance of the Overload Control Information
(OCI) IE.
When providing overload control information in a message for the first time or
subsequently, the UP function shall always include the full set of overload
control information, i.e. all the node level instance of the Overload Control
Information, even if only a subset of the overload control information has
changed. The Overload Control Sequence Number shall be incremented whenever
the Overload control information is changed (see subclause 6.2.4.3.2.1).
The receiver shall overwrite any stored overload control information of a peer
with the newly received overload control information from the same peer node
if the new overload control information is more recent than the old
information as indicated by the Overload Control Sequence Number, e.g. if the
receiver has stored an instance of the Overload control information for a peer
node, it overwrites this instance with the new instance received in a message
from the same peer node.
The receiver shall consider all the parameters received in the same instance
of the OCI IE in conjunction while applying the overload mitigation action.
The parameters are further defined in subclause 6.2.4.3.2.
Overload control information may be extended with new parameters in future
versions of the specification. Any new parameter will have to be categorized
as:
\- Non-critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is _not
critical_ for the receiver. The receiver can successfully and correctly
comprehend the Overload control information instance, containing one or more
of these parameters, by using the other parameters and ignoring the non-
critical optional parameter.
\- Critical optional parameters: the support of these parameters is _critical_
for the receiver to correctly comprehend the instance of the Overload control
information containing one or more of these parameters.
The sender may include one or more non-critical optional parameters within any
instance of the OCI IE without having the knowledge of the receiver\'s
capability to support the same. However, the sender shall only include one or
more critical optional parameter in an instance of the OCI IE towards a
receiver if the corresponding receiver is known to support those parameters.
The sender may be aware of this either via signalling methods or by
configuration (this will have to be defined when introducing any such new
parameter in future).
The Overload Control Information shall be associated by default to the PFCP
entity corresponding to the peer node\'s IP address of the Sx session, over
which the OCI IE is received, i.e. to the IP address received within the \"UP
F-SEID\" IE.
Alternatively, the UP function may send Overload Control Information which is
associated with the Node ID of the UP function (i.e. FQDN or the IP address
used during the UP function selection). In that case, the UP function shall
provide an explicit indication that the OCI IE included in the message belongs
to the Node ID.
##### 6.2.4.3.2 Parameters
###### 6.2.4.3.2.1 Overload Control Sequence Number
The PFCP protocol requires retransmitted messages to have the same contents as
the original message. Due to PFCP retransmissions, the overload control
information received by a CP function at a given time may be less recent than
the overload control information already received from the same UP function.
The Overload Control Sequence Number aids in sequencing the overload control
information received from an overloaded UP function. The Overload Control
Sequence Number contains a value that indicates the sequence number associated
with the Overload Control Information IE. This sequence number shall be used
to differentiate between two OCI IEs generated at two different instants, by
the same UP function.
The Overload Control Sequence Number parameter shall be supported (when
supporting the overload control feature) and shall always be present in the
Overload Control Information IE.
The UP function generating this information shall increment the Overload
Control Sequence Number whenever modifying some information in the OCI IE. The
Overload Control Sequence Number shall not be incremented otherwise. The UP
function may use the time, represented in an unsigned integer format, of the
generation of the overload control information, to populate the Overload
Control Sequence Number.
This parameter shall be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to properly collate
out-of-order OCI IEs, e.g. due to PFCP retransmissions. This parameter shall
also be used by the receiver of the OCI IE to determine whether the newly
received overload control information has changed compared to the overload
control information previously received from the same UP function. If the
newly received overload control information has the same Overload Control
Sequence Number as the previously received overload control information from
the same UP function, then the receiver may simply discard the newly received
overload control information whilst continuing to apply the overload abatement
procedures, as per the previous value.
NOTE 1: The timer corresponding to the Period of Validity (see subclause
6.2.4.3.2.2) is not restarted if the newly received overload control
information has the same Overload Control Sequence Number as the previously
received overload control information. If the overload condition persists and
the overloaded UP function needs to extend the duration during which the
overload information applies, the sender needs to provide a new overload
control information with an incremented Overload Control Sequence Number (even
if the parameters within the overload control information have not changed).
NOTE 2: The PFCP Sequence Number cannot be used for collating out-of-order
overload information as e.g. overload control information may be sent in both
PFCP requests and responses, using independent PFCP sequence numbering.
If the receiving CP function already received and stored overload control
information, which is still valid, from the overloaded UP function, the
receiving entity shall update its overload control information, only if the
Overload-Sequence-Number received in the new overload control information is
larger than the value of the Overload Control Sequence Number associated with
the stored information. However due to roll-over of the Overload Control
Sequence Number or restart of the UP function, the Overload Control Sequence
Number may be reset to an appropriate base value by the peer UP function,
hence the receiving entity shall be prepared to receive (and process) an
Overload Control Sequence Number parameter whose value is less than the
previous value.
###### 6.2.4.3.2.2 Period of Validity
The Period of Validity indicates the length of time during which the overload
condition specified by the OCI IE is to be considered as valid (unless
overridden by subsequent new overload control information).
An overload condition shall be considered as valid from the time the OCI IE is
received until the period of validity expires or until another OCI IE with a
new set of information (identified using the Overload Control Sequence Number)
is received from the same UP function (at which point the newly received
overload control information shall prevail). The timer corresponding to the
period of validity shall be restarted each time an OCI IE with a new set of
information (identified using the Overload Control Sequence Number) is
received. When this timer expires, the last received overload control
information shall be considered outdated and obsolete, i.e. any associated
overload condition shall be considered to have ceased.
The Period of Validity parameter shall be supported (when supporting overload
control).
The Period of Validity parameter achieves the following:
\- it avoids the need for the overloaded UP function to include the Overload
Control Information IE in every PFCP messages it signals to its peer CP
functions when the overload state does not change; thus it minimizes the
processing required at the overloaded UP function and its peer CP functions
upon sending/receiving PFCP signalling;
\- it allows to reset the overload condition after some time in the peer CP
functions having received an overload indication from the overloaded UP
function, e.g. if no signalling traffic takes place between these PFCP
entities for some time due to overload mitigation actions. This also removes
the need for the overloaded UP function to remember the list of CP functions
to which it has sent a non-null overload reduction metric and to which it
would subsequently need to signal when the overload condition ceases, if the
Period of Validity parameter was not defined.
###### 6.2.4.3.2.3 Overload Reduction Metric
The Overload Reduction Metric shall have a value in the range of 0 to 100
(inclusive) which indicates the percentage of traffic reduction the sender of
the overload control information requests the receiver to apply. An Overload
Reduction Metric of \"0\" always indicates that the UP function is not in
overload (that is, no overload abatement procedures need to be applied) for
the indicated scope.
Considering the processing requirement of the receiver of the Overload Control
Information, e.g. to perform overload control based on the updated Overload
Reduction Metric, the sender should refrain from advertising every small
variation, e.g. with the granularity of 1 or 2, in the Overload Reduction
Metric which does not result in useful improvement for mitigating the overload
situation. During the typical operating condition of the sender, a larger
variation in the Overload Reduction Metric, e.g. 5 or more units, should be
considered as reasonable enough for advertising a new Overload Reduction
Metric Information and thus justifying the processing requirement (to handle
the new information) of the receiver.
NOTE: The range of Overload Reduction Metric, i.e. 0 to 100, does not mandate
the sender to collect its own overload information at every
increment/decrement and hence to advertise the change of Overload Reduction
Metric with a granularity of 1%. Based on various implementation specific
criteria, such as the architecture, session and signalling capacity, the
current load/overload situation and so on, the sender is free to define its
own logic and periodicity with which its own overload control information is
collected.
The computation of the exact value for this parameter is left as an
implementation choice at the sending UP function.
The Overload Reduction Metric shall be supported (when supporting overload
control) and shall always be present in the OCI IE.
The inclusion of the OCI IE signals an overload situation is occuring, unless
the Overload Reduction Metric is set to 0, which signals that the overload
condition has ceased. Conversely, the absence of the OCI IE in a message does
not mean that the overload has abated.
##### 6.2.4.3.3 Frequency of Inclusion
How often or when the sender includes the overload control information is
implementation specific. The sender shall ensure that new/updated overload
control information is propagated to the target receivers with an acceptable
delay, such that the purpose of the information, (i.e. the effective overload
control protection) is achieved. The following are some of the potential
approaches the sender may implement for including the OCI IE:
\- the sender may include OCI IE towards a receiver only when the new/changed
value has not already been provided to the given receiver;
\- the sender may include the OCI IE in a subset of the messages towards the
receiver;
\- the sender may include the OCI IE periodically, i.e. include the
information during a first period then cease to do so during a second period.
The sender may also implement a combination of one or more of the above
approaches. Besides, the sender may also include the OCI IE only in a subset
of the applicable PFCP messages.
The receiver shall be prepared to receive the overload control information
received in any of the PFCP messages extended with an OCI IE and upon such
reception, shall be able act upon the received information.
#### 6.2.4.4 Message Throttling
##### 6.2.4.4.1 General
As part of the overload mitigation, a CP function shall reduce the total
number of messages, which would have been sent otherwise, towards the
overloaded peer based on the information received within the Overload Control
Information. This shall be achieved by discarding a fraction of the messages
in proportion to the overload level of the target peer. This is called
\"message throttling\".
Message throttling shall only apply to Request messages. Response messages
should not be throttled since that would result in the retransmission of the
corresponding request message by the sender.
A CP function supporting PFCP overload control shall support and use the
\"Loss\" algorithm as specified in this clause, for message throttling.
##### 6.2.4.4.2 Throttling algorithm -- \"Loss\"
###### 6.2.4.4.2.1 Description
An overloaded UP function shall ask its peers to reduce the number of requests
they would ordinarily send by signalling Overload Control Information
including the requested traffic reduction, as a percentage, within the
\"Overload-Reduction-Metric\", as specified in subclause 6.2.4.3.2.
The recipients of the \"Overload-Reduction-Metric\" shall reduce the number of
requests sent by that percentage, either by redirecting them to an alternate
destination if possible (e.g. the Sx Session Establishment Request message may
be redirected to an alternate UP function), or by failing the request and
treating it as if it was rejected by the destination UP function.
For example, if a sender requests another peer to reduce the traffic it is
sending by 10%, then that peer shall throttle 10% of the traffic that would
have otherwise been sent to this UP function.
The overloaded UP function should periodically adjust the requested traffic
reduction based e.g. on the traffic reduction factor that is currently in use,
the current system utilization (i.e. the overload level) and the desired
system utilization (i.e. the target load level), and/or the rate of the
current overall received traffic.
Annex A.1 provides an (informative) example of a possible implementation of
the \"Loss\" algorithm, amongst other possible methods.
NOTE 1: This algorithm does not guarantee that the future traffic towards the
overloaded UP function will be less than the past traffic but it ensures that
the total traffic sent towards the overloaded UP function is less than what
would have been sent without any throttling in place. If after requesting a
certain reduction in traffic, the overloaded UP function receives more traffic
than in the past, whilst still in overload, leading to the worsening rather
than an improvement in the overload level, then the overloaded UP function can
request for more reduction in traffic. Thus, by periodically adjusting the
requested traffic reduction, the overloaded node can ensure that it receives,
approximately, the amount of traffic which it can handle.
NOTE 2: Since the reduction is requested as a percentage, and not as an
absolute amount, this algorithm achieves a good useful throughput towards the
overloaded node when the traffic conditions vary at the source nodes
(depending upon the events generated towards these source nodes by other
entities in the network), as a potential increase of traffic from some source
nodes can possibly be compensated by a potential decrease of traffic from
other source nodes.
#### 6.2.4.5 Message Prioritization
##### 6.2.4.5.1 Description
When performing message throttling:
\- PFCP requests related to priority traffic (i.e. eMPS as described in 3GPP
TS 22.153 [15]) and emergency have the highest priority. Depending on
regional/national requirements and network operator policy, these PFCP
requests shall be the last to be throttled, when applying traffic reduction,
and the priority traffic shall be exempted from throttling due to PFCP
overload control up to the point where the requested traffic reduction cannot
be achieved without throttling the priority traffic;
\- for other types of sessions, messages throttling should consider the
relative priority of the messages so that the messages which are considered as
low priority are considered for throttling before the other messages. The
relative priority of the messages may be derived from the relative priority of
the procedure for which the message is being sent or may be derived from the
session parameters such as APN, QCI, ARP and/or Low Access Priority Indicator
(LAPI).
NOTE: A random throttling mechanism, i.e. discarding the messages without any
special consideration, could result in an overall poor congestion mitigation
mechanism and bad user experience.
An overloaded node may also apply these message prioritization schemes when
handling incoming initial messages during an overloaded condition, as part of
a self-protection mechanism.
##### 6.2.4.5.2 Based on the Message Priority Signalled in the PFCP Message
Message prioritization may be performed by an overloaded node, when handling
incoming messages during an overloaded condition, based on the relative PFCP
message priority signalled in the PFCP header (see subclause 7.2.2.3).
A PFCP entity shall determine whether to set and use the message priority in
PFCP signalling, based on operator policy. The requirements specified in this
subclause shall apply if message priority in PFCP signalling is used.
A sending PFCP entity shall determine the relative message priority to signal
in the message according to the principles specified in subclause 6.2.4.5.1.
If the message affects multiple bearers, the relative message priority should
be determined considering the highest priority ARP among all the bearers.
A PFCP entity should set the same message priority in a Response message as
received in the corresponding Request message.
For incoming PFCP messages that do not have a message priority in the PFCP
header, the receiving PFCP entity:
\- shall apply a default priority, if the incoming message is a Request
message;
\- should apply the message priority sent in the Request message, if the
incoming message is a Response message.
This feature should be supported homogenously across the CP functions and UP
functions in the network, otherwise an overloaded node will process Request
messages received from the non-supporting nodes according to the default
priority while Request messages received from supporting nodes will be
processed according to the message priority signalled in the PFCP message.
### 6.2.5 Sx PFD Management Procedure
#### 6.2.5.1 General
The Sx PFD Management procedure may be used by the CP function and UP function
to provision PFDs to the UP function, for one or more Application Identifiers,
as specified in subclauses 5.11.4 and 6.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
Support of this procedure is optional for the CP function and the UP function.
The UP function shall set the PFDM feature flag in the UP Function Features IE
if it supports the PFD Management procedure (see subclause 8.2.25).
The UP function shall store the PFDs provisioned per Application Identifier.
These PFDs shall apply to all the Sx session established in the UP function,
for all the controlling CP functions, i.e. the scope of a PFD is not limited
to the Sx sessions established by the CP function which provisioned the PFD.
#### 6.2.5.2 CP Function Behaviour
The CP function initiates the Sx PFD Management procedure to provision PFDs in
the UP function, for one or more Application Identifier(s).
The CP function:
\- shall send the Sx PFD Management Request message, including the full set of
PFD IDs and PFD contents to be provisioned in the UP function per Application
Identifier.
When the CP function receives an Sx PFD Management Response with cause
success, the CP function shall consider that the PFDs have been provisioned as
requested.
#### 6.2.5.3 UP Function Behaviour
When the UP function receives an Sx PFD Management Request message, it shall:
\- if no Application ID\'s PFDs IE is present in the request (i.e. empty
message),
\- delete all the PFDs received and stored earlier for all Application
Identifier(s);
\- if at least one Application ID\'s PFDs IE is present in the request,
\- delete all the PFDs received and stored earlier for the indicated
Application Identifier(s);
\- store all the PFDs received in the request for the indicated Application
Identifier(s);
\- send an Sx PFD Management Response with the cause \"success\", if the above
operations were performed successfully.
\- if a PFD is removed/modified and this PFD was used to detect application
traffic related to an application identifier in a PDR created/activated for an
Sx session and the UP function has reported the application start to the CP
function for the application instance corresponding to this PFD as defined in
subclause 5.4.11 ((Un)solicited Application Reporting), the UP function shall
report the application stop to the CP function for the corresponding
application instance identifier as defined in subclause 5.4.11 if the
removed/modified PFD in UP results in the stop of the application instance is
not being able to be detected. See subclause 5.11.4 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
### 6.2.6 Sx Association Setup Procedure
#### 6.2.6.1 General

between a CP function and a UP function, to enable the CP function to use the
resources of the UP function subsequently, i.e. establish Sx Sessions.
The setup of an Sx association may be initiated by the CP function (see
subclause 6.2.6.2) or the UP function (see subclause 6.2.6.3).
The CP function and the UP function shall support the Sx Association Setup
initiated by the CP function. The CP function and the UP function may

setup an Sx association towards a CP function. The UP function is configured
with a set of CP functions to which it shall establish an Sx association.
The UP function:
\- shall retrieve an IP address of the CP function, e.g. based on local
configuration in the UP function;
\- shall send the Sx Association Setup Request including the Node ID of the UP
function, all supported optional features in the UP function and optionally
the available user plane resources, e.g. IP address(es) or F-TEID range.
##### 6.2.6.3.2 CP Function Behaviour
When receiving an Sx Association Setup Request, the CP function:
\- if the request is accepted:
\- shall store the Node ID of the UP function as the identifier of the Sx
association;
\- shall send an Sx Association Setup Response with a successful cause, its
Node ID, and information of the list of optional features the CP function
supports which may affect the UP function behaviour, if any;
\- shall send an Sx Version Not Supported Response if the PFCP header of the
request indicates a PFCP protocol version that is not supported by the CP
function;
\- otherwise, shall send an Sx Association Setup Response with an appropriate
error cause if the request is rejected.
The CP function shall only initiate Sx Session related signalling procedures
toward a UP function after it has sent the Sx Association Setup Response with
a successful cause to the UP function.
The CP function shall determine the UP function supports Sxa, Sxb, Sxc and/or
combined Sxa/Sxb by local configuration or optionally via DNS if deployed.
### 6.2.7 Sx Association Update Procedure
#### 6.2.7.1 General
The Sx Association Update procedure shall be used to modify an existing Sx
association between the CP function and the UP function. It may be initiated
by the UP function or by the CP function to update the supported features or
available resources of the UP function.
#### 6.2.7.2 Sx Association Update Procedure Initiated by the CP Function
##### 6.2.7.2.1 CP Function Behaviour

The UP function initiates the Sx Association Update procedure to report
changes to the Sx association to the CP function, e.g. change of optional
features, change of the available user plane resources, an indication to
request to release the Sx association.
The UP function may send an Sx Association Update Request to request the CP
function to perform the release of the Sx association, optionally providing a
Graceful Release Period. After reception of the Sx Association Update
Response, the UP function shall consider that the Sx association is still
setup until receiving an Sx Association Release Request.

received;
\- shall send an Sx Association Update Response with an appropriate error
cause if the Node ID is not known by the CP Function;
\- shall return an Sx Association Update Response with a successful cause
value if the Sx Association Update Request is handled successfully.
If the UP function has requested to release the Sx association in the Sx
Association Update Request, the CP function should initiate an Sx Association
Release Request to release the Sx association, as soon as possible if no
Graceful Release Period was included in the request or before the expiry of
the Graceful Release Period.
If the UP function has included User Plane IP Resource Information IE in the
Sx Association Update Request message, the CP function shall use it to
overwrite the User Plane IP Resource Information previously received from the
UP function.
### 6.2.8 Sx Association Release Procedure
#### 6.2.8.1 General

\- shall delete the Sx association and any related information (e.g. Node ID
of the CP function);
\- shall send an Sx Association Release Response with a successful cause.
NOTE: The UP function always accepts an Sx Association Release Request.
### 6.2.9 Sx Node Report Procedure
#### 6.2.9.1 General

## 6.3 Sx Session Related Procedures
### 6.3.1 General
The following subclauses describe the session related procedures over the Sxa,
Sxb and Sxc reference points. The behaviour of the CP function and UP function
when sending and receiving session related messages is described.
### 6.3.2 Sx Session Establishment Procedure
#### 6.3.2.1 General
The Sx Session Establishment procedure shall be used to setup an Sx session
between CP function and UP function and configure Rules in the UP function so
that the UP function can handle incoming packets.
#### 6.3.2.2 CP Function Behaviour
The CP function initiates the Sx Session Establishment procedure to create a
Sx session for a PDN connection, or IP-CAN session or TDF session or for
applying a certain IP packets treatment which is not associated with any PDN
connection or TDF session.
The CP function:
\- shall send the Sx Session Establishment Request message with a new Sx
F-SEID together with Rules to be created;
\- may assign a local F-TEID for the access side and/or core side and provide
it in the PDI, if F-TEID allocation is performed in the CP function.
When the CP function receives an Sx Session Establishment Response with cause
success, the CP function shall continue with the procedure which triggered the
Sx Session Establishment procedure.
#### 6.3.2.3 UP Function Behaviour
When the UP function receives an Sx Session Establishment Request message it
shall:
\- store and apply the rules received in the request and send an Sx Session
Establishment Response with cause \"success\", if all rules in the Sx Session
Establishment Request are stored and applied;
\- Otherwise, if at least one rule failed to be stored or applied, return an
appropriate error cause value with the Rule ID of the Rule causing the first
error, discard all the received rules and not create any Sx session context.
### 6.3.3 Sx Session Modification Procedure
#### 6.3.3.1 General
The Sx Session Modification procedure shall be used to modify an existing Sx
session, e.g. to configure a new rule, to modify an existing rule, to delete
an existing rule.
#### 6.3.3.2 CP Function behaviour

existing Sx session, e.g. triggered by an modification of PDN connection, IP
CAN session or TDF session.
The CP function shall:
\- include a complete PDI if the PDI in the existing PDR is to be updated;
\- remove locally the reference to a rule in the PDRs when the related Rule is
deleted;
\- provide all the new, updated or deleted Rules. The Updated Rules shall
contain only the information which are changed, added and/or deleted.
When the CP function receives an Sx Session Modification Response with the
cause \"success\" it shall continue with the procedure which has initiated the
Sx Session Modification procedure.
#### 6.3.3.3 UP Function Behaviour
When the UP function receives a Sx Session Modification Request it shall:
\- send the Sx Session Modification Response message with a rejection cause
value set to \"Session context not found\" if the F-SEID included in the Sx
Session Modification Request message is unknown;
\- reject a modification request which would relate to a rule not existing in
the UP function;
\- discard any updates on the Sx session context included in the Sx Session
Modification Request message if the request is rejected and send an Sx Session
Modification Response with an appropriate error cause together with additional
information e.g. indicating the first Rule ID of the Rule causing the error.
In this case, the UP function shall continue with the existing Sx session
context for the Sx session as if the Sx Session Modification Request had not
been received;

session.
When the CP function receives Sx Session Deletion Response with cause success,
the CP function shall continue with the procedure which triggers the Sx
Session Deletion procedure.
#### 6.3.4.3 UP Function Behaviour
When the UP function receives a Sx Session Deletion Request it shall:
\- send the Sx Session Deletion Response message with a rejection cause set to
\"Session context not found\" if the F-SEID include in the Sx Session Deletion
Request message is unknown;
\- send the Sx Session Deletion Response message with an acceptance cause if
the Sx session and associated rules are deleted successfully, and include any
pending Usage Report(s) in the message.
### 6.3.5 Sx Session Report Procedure
#### 6.3.5.1 General
The Sx Session Report procedure shall be used by the UP function to report
information related to the Sx session to the CP function.
#### 6.3.5.2 UP Function Behaviour
The UP function shall initiate the Sx Session Report procedure to report
information related to an Sx session to the CP function. The UP function:
\- shall send the Sx Session Report Request message, identifying the Sx
session for which the report is sent and including the information to be
reported.
When the UP function receives an Sx Session Report Response with the cause
success, the UP function shall consider the information to be successfully
delivered to the CP function.
#### 6.3.5.3 CP Function Behaviour

\"Session context not found\" if the F-SEID included in the Sx Session Report
Request message is unknown;
\- process the information being reported as appropriate and send an Sx
Session Report Response with the cause \"success\";
\- otherwise return an appropriate error cause value.
## 6.4 Reliable Delivery of PFCP Messages
Reliable delivery of PFCP messages is accomplished by retransmission of these
messages as specified in this subclause.
A PFCP entity shall maintain, for each triplet of local IP address, local UDP
port and remote peer\'s IP address, a sending queue with Request messages to
be sent to that peer. Each message shall be sent with a Sequence Number and be
held until a corresponding Response is received or until the PFCP entity
ceases retransmission of that message. The Sequence Number shall be unique for
each outstanding Request message sourced from the same IP/UDP endpoint. A PFCP
entity may have several outstanding Requests waiting for replies.
When sending a Request message, the sending PFCP entity shall start a timer
T1. The sending entity shall consider that the Request message has been lost
if a corresponding Response message has not been received before the T1 timer
expires. If so, the sending entity shall retransmit the Request message, if
the total number of retry attempts is less than N1 times. The setting of the
T1 timer and N1 counter is implementation specific.
A retransmitted PFCP message shall have the same message content, including
the same PFCP header, UDP ports, source and destination IP addresses as the
originally transmitted message.
A Request and its Response message shall have the same Sequence Number value,
i.e. the Sequence Number in the PFCP header of the Response message shall be
copied from the respective Request message. A Request and its Response
messages are matched based on the Sequence Number and the IP address and UDP
port.
Not counting retransmissions, a Request message shall be answered with a
single Response message. Duplicated Response messages shall be discarded by
the receiver. A received Response message not matching an outstanding Request
message waiting for a reply should be discarded.
The PFCP entity should inform the upper layer when detecting an unsuccessful
transfer of a Request message to enable the controlling upper entity to take
any appropriate measure.
# 7 Messages and Message Formats
## 7.1 Transmission Order and Bit Definitions
PFCP messages shall be transmitted in network octet order starting with octet
1 with the most significant bit sent first.
The most significant bit of an octet in a PFCP message is bit 8. If a field in
a PFCP message spans over several octets, the most significant bit is bit 8 of
the octet with the lowest number, unless specified otherwise.

#### 7.2.2.4 Usage of the PFCP Header
##### 7.2.2.4.1 General
The format of the PFCP header is specified in subclause 7.2.2.
The usage of the PFCP header shall be as defined below.
The first octet of the header shall be used is the following way:
\- Bit 1 represents the \"S\" flag, which indicates if SEID field is present
in the PFCP header or not. If the \"S\" flag is set to 0, then the SEID field
shall not be present in the PFCP header. If the \"S\" flag is set to 1, then
the SEID field shall immediately follow the Length field, in octets 5 to 12.
Apart from the node related messages , in all Sx messages the value of the
\"S\" flag shall be set to \"1\".
\- Bit 2 represents the \"MP\" flag. If the \"MP\" flag is set to \"1\", then
bits 8 to 5 of octet 16 shall indicate the message priority.
\- Bit 3 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to \"0\" and the
receiving entity shall ignore it.
\- Bit 4 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to \"0\" and the
receiving entity shall ignore it.
\- Bit 5 is a spare bit. The sending entity shall set it to \"0\" and the
receiving entity shall ignore it.
\- Bits 6 to 8, which represent the PFCP version, shall be set to decimal 1
(\"001\").
The usage of the fields in octets 2 - n of the header shall be as specified
below.
\- Octet 2 represents the Message type field, which shall be set to the unique
value for each type of control plane message. Message type values are
specified in Table 7.3-1 \"Message types\".
\- Octets 3 to 4 represent the Message Length field. This field shall indicate
the length of the message in octets excluding the mandatory part of the PFCP
header (the first 4 octets). The SEID (if present) and the Sequence Number
shall be included in the length count. The format of the Length field of
information elements is specified in subclause 8.2 \"Information Element
Format\".
\- When S=1, Octets 5 to 12 represent the Session Endpoint Identifier (SEID)
field. This field shall unambiguously identify a session endpoint in the
receiving Packet Forward Control entity. The Session Endpoint Identifier is
set by the sending entity in the PFCP header of all control plane messages to
the SEID value provided by the corresponding receiving entity (CP or UP
function). If a peer\'s SEID is not available the SEID field shall be present
in a PFCP header, but its value shall be set to \"0\", \"Conditions for
sending SEID=0 in PFCP header\".
NOTE: The SEID in the PFCP header of a message is set to the SEID value
provided by the corresponding receiving entity regardless of whether the
source IP address of the request message and the IP Destination Address
provided by the receiving entity for subsequent request messages are the same
or not.
\- Octets 13 to 15 represent PFCP Sequence Number field.
##### 7.2.2.4.2 Conditions for Sending SEID=0 in PFCP Header
If a peer\'s SEID is not available, the SEID field shall still be present in
the header and its value shall be set to \"0\" in the following messages:
\- Sx Session Establishment Request message on Sxa/Sxb/Sxc;
\- If a node receives a message for which it has no session, i.e. if SEID in
the PFCP header is not known, it shall respond with \"Session context not
found\" cause in the corresponding response message to the sender, the SEID
used in the PFCP header in the response message shall be then set to \"0\";
\- If a node receives a request message containing protocol error, e.g.
Mandatory IE missing, which requires the receiver to reject the message as
specified in clause 7.6, it shall reject the request message. For the response
message, the node should look up the remote peer\'s SEID and accordingly set
SEID in the PFCP header and the message cause code. As an implementation
option, the node may not look up the remote peer\'s SEID and set the PFCP
header SEID to \"0\" in the response message. However in this case, the cause
value shall not be set to \"Session not found\".
### 7.2.3 Information Elements
#### 7.2.3.1 General
The format of PFCP Information Elements are defined in subclause 8.2.
#### 7.2.3.2 Presence Requirements of Information Elements
IEs within PFCP messages shall be specified with one of the following presence
requirement:
\- Mandatory: this means that the IE shall be included by the sending entity,
and that the receiver diagnoses a \"Mandatory IE missing\" error when
detecting that the IE is not present. A response including a \"Mandatory IE
missing\" cause, shall include the type of the missing IE.
\- Conditional: this means that:
\- the IE shall be included by sending entity if the conditions specified are
met;
\- the receiver shall check the conditions as specified in the corresponding
message type description, based on the parameter combination in the message
and/or on the state of the receiving node, to infer if a conditional IE shall
be expected. Only if a receiver has sufficient information, if a conditional
IE, which is necessary for the receiving entity to complete the procedure, is
missing, then the receiver shall abort the procedure.
\- Conditional-Optional: this means that:
\- the IE shall be included by a sending entity complying with the version of
the specification, if the conditions specified in the relevant protocol
specification are met. An entity, which is at an earlier version of the
protocol and therefore is not up-to-date, cannot send this IE;
\- the receiver need not check the presence of the IE in the message. If the
receiver checks the presence of the Conditional-Optional IE, then the IE\'s
absence shall not trigger any of the error handling procedures. The handling
of an absence or erroneous such IEs shall be treated as Optional IEs as
specified in subclause 7.6.
\- Optional: this means that:
\- the IE shall be included as a service option. Therefore, the IE may be
included or not in a message. The handling of an absent optional IE, or an
erroneous optional IE is specified in subclause 7.6.
For conditional IEs, the clause describing the PFCP message explicitly defines
the conditions under which the inclusion of each IE becomes mandatory or
optional for that particular message. These conditions shall be defined so
that the presence of a conditional IE only becomes mandatory if it is critical
for the receiving entity. The definition might reference other protocol
specifications for final terms used as part of the condition.
For grouped IEs, the presence requirement of the embedded IE shall follow the
rules:
\- If the grouped IE is Mandatory within a given message: the presence
requirements of individual embedded IEs are as stated within the Mandatory
grouped IE for the given message;
\- if the grouped IE is Conditional within a given message: if the embedded IE
in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is viewed as
Conditional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is
Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the
receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this embedded IE
is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver;
\- if the grouped IE is Conditional-Optional within a given message: if the
embedded IE in the grouped IE is Mandatory or Conditional, this embedded IE is
viewed as Conditional-Optional IE by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the
grouped IE is Conditional-Optional, this embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE
by the receiver. If the embedded IE in the grouped IE is Optional, this
embedded IE is viewed as Optional IE by the receiver;
\- if the grouped IE is Optional within a given message: all embedded IEs in
the grouped IE are viewed as Optional IEs by the receiver.
In all of the above cases, appropriate error handling as described in
subclause 7.6 shall be applied for protocol errors of the embedded IEs.
Only the Cause IE at message level shall be included in the response if the
Cause contains a value that indicates that the request is not accepted,
regardless of whether there are other mandatory or conditional IEs defined for
a given response message. The following are exceptions:
\- the Node ID and Offending IE shall be included as per the requirements
specified for the corresponding response message;
\- the Load Control Information, Overload Control Information and the Failed
Rule ID IEs may be included in an Sx session related message.
If the Cause IE at Grouped IE level contains a value that indicates that the
Grouped IE is not handled correctly, the other IEs in this Grouped IE, other
than the Cause IE, may not be included.
#### 7.2.3.3 Grouped Information Elements
A Grouped IE is an IE which may contain other IEs.
Grouped IEs have a length value in the TLV encoding, which includes the added
length of all the embedded IEs. Overall coding of a grouped IE with 4 octets
long IE header is defined in subclause 8.2. Each IE within a grouped IE also
shall also contain 4 octets long IE header.
Grouped IEs are not marked by any flag or limited to a specific range of IE
type values. The clause describing an IE in this specification shall
explicitly state if it is a Grouped IE.
NOTE: Each entry into each Grouped IE creates a new scope level. Exit from the
grouped IE closes the scope level. The PFCP message level is the top most
scope.
If more than one grouped IEs of the same type, but for a different purpose are
sent with a message, these IEs shall have different IE types.
If more than one grouped IEs of the same type and for the same purpose are
sent with a message, these IEs shall have exactly the same IE type to
represent a list.
#### 7.2.3.4 Information Element Type
An IE in a PFCP message or Grouped IE is identified by its IE Type and
described by a specific row in the corresponding tables in clause 7.
If several IEs with the same Type are included in a PFCP message or Grouped
IE, they represent a list for the corresponding IE name.
An IE Type value uniquely identifies a specific IE.
One IE type value is specified for Vendor Specific IEs.

the receiving PFCP entity\'s implementation shall discard such a message
without further processing or that the receiving PFCP entity discards such an
IE and continues processing the message. The conditions for the receiving PFCP
entity to silently discard an IE are specified in the subsequent subclauses.
The handling of unknown, unexpected or erroneous PFCP messages and IEs shall
provide for the forward compatibility of PFCP. Therefore, the sending PFCP
entity shall be able to safely include in a message a new conditional-optional
or an optional IE. Such an IE may also have a new type value. Any legacy
receiving PFCP entity shall, however, silently discard such an IE and continue
processing the message.
If a protocol error is detected by the receiving PFCP entity, it should log
the event including the erroneous message and may include the error in a
statistical counter.
For Response messages containing a rejection Cause value, see subclause
7.2.3.2.
The receiving PFCP entity shall apply the error handling specified in the
subsequent subclauses.
If the received erroneous message is a reply to an outstanding PFCP message,
the PFCP transaction layer shall stop retransmissions and notify the PFCP
application layer of the error even if the reply is silently discarded.
### 7.6.2 Different PFCP Versions
If a PFCP entity receives a message of an unsupported PFCP version, it shall
return an Sx Version Not Supported Response message and silently discard the
received message.
### 7.6.3 PFCP Message of Invalid Length
If a PFCP entity receives a message, which is too short to contain the
respective PFCP header, the PFCP-PDU shall be silently discarded.
If a PFCP entity receives a Request message within an IP/UDP packet of a
length that is inconsistent with the value specified in the Length field of
the PFCP header, then the receiving PFCP entity should log the error and shall
send the Response message with Cause IE value set to \"Invalid Length\".
If a PFCP entity receives a Response message within an IP/UDP packet of a
length that is inconsistent with the value specified in the Length field of
the PFCP header, then the receiving PFCP entity should log the error and shall
silently discard the message.
### 7.6.4 Unknown PFCP Message
If a PFCP entity receives a message with an unknown Message Type value, it
shall silently discard the message.
### 7.6.5 Unexpected PFCP Message
If a PFCP entity receives an unexpected request message, for example a known
message that is sent over an interface for which the message is not defined,
or a message that is sent over an interface for which the message is defined,
but the direction is incorrect, then the PFCP entity shall silently discard
the message and shall log an error.
If a PFCP entity receives an unexpected response message which is not a
request message, for example a message for which there is no corresponding
outstanding request, it shall discard the message and may log an error.
### 7.6.6 Missing Information Elements
A PFCP entity shall check if all mandatory IEs are present in the received
Request message. Apart from Echo Request message, if one or more mandatory
information elements are missing in the received Request message, the PFCP
entity should log the error and shall send a Response message with Cause IE
value set to \"Mandatory IE missing\" with the type of the missing mandatory
IE.
If a PFCP entity receives a Response message with Cause IE value set to
\"Mandatory IE missing\", it shall notify its upper layer.
A PFCP entity shall check if all mandatory IEs are present in the received
Response message without a rejection Cause value. If one or more mandatory
information elements are missing, the PFCP entity shall notify the upper layer
and should log the error.
A PFCP entity shall check if conditional information elements are present in
the received Request message, if possible (i.e. if the receiving entity has
sufficient information available to check if the respective conditions were
met). If one or more conditional information elements are missing, a PFCP
entity should log the error and shall send a Response message with Cause IE
value set to \"Conditional IE missing\" together with the type of the missing
conditional IE.
A PFCP entity shall check if conditional information elements are present in
the received Response message without a rejection Cause value, if possible
(i.e. if the receiving entity has sufficient information available to check if
the respective conditions were met). If one or more conditional information
elements are missing, a PFCP entity shall notify the upper layer and should
log the error.
For Response messages containing a rejection Cause value, see subclause
7.2.3.2.
Absence of an optional information element shall not trigger any error
handling.
### 7.6.7 Invalid Length Information Element
An information element has an invalid length when the actual length of the IE
is different from the value of the Length field in the IE header. Here, the
actual length of the IE means the length of the content field of the received
IE.
If a PFCP message contains more than one information elements and one or more
of them have invalid length, the receiving PFCP entity can detect which of the
IEs have invalid length only in the following cases:
\- If the Length value in the IE header is greater than the overall length of
the message;
\- If the invalid length IE is the last one in the message.
Apart from Echo Request message, if a receiving PFCP entity detects
information element with invalid length in a Request message, it shall send an
appropriate error response with Cause IE value set to \"Invalid length\"
together with the type of the offending IE.
### 7.6.8 Semantically incorrect Information Element
Apart from Echo Request message, the receiver of a PFCP signalling message
Request including a mandatory or a verifiable conditional information element
with a semantically invalid Value shall discard the request, should log the
error, and shall send a response with Cause IE value set to \"Mandatory IE
incorrect\" together with a type and instance of the offending IE.
The receiver of a PFCP signalling message Response including a mandatory or a
verifiable conditional information element with a semantically invalid Value
shall notify the upper layer that a message with this sequence number has been
received and should log the error.
If a PFCP entity receives an information element with a value which is shown
as reserved, it shall treat that information element as invalid and should log
the error. If the invalid IE is received in a Request, and it is a mandatory
IE or a verifiable conditional IE, the PFCP entity shall send a response with
Cause set to \"Mandatory IE incorrect\" together with a type and instance of
the offending IE.
The principle is: the use of reserved values invokes error handling; the use
of spare values can be silently discarded and for IEs with spare values used,
processing shall be continued ignoring the spare values.
The receiver of a PFCP signalling message including an optional information
element with a Value that is not in the range defined for this information
element value shall discard this IE, but shall treat the rest of the message
as if this IE was absent and continue processing. The receiver shall not check
the content of an information element field that is defined as \"spare\".
All semantically incorrect optional information elements in a PFCP signalling
message shall be treated as not present in the message.
### 7.6.9 Unknown or unexpected Information Element
The receiver of a PFCP message including an unexpected information element
with a known Type value that is not defined for this message shall discard the
IE and log an error. The receiver shall process the message.
NOTE: An Information Element in an encoded PFCP message or grouped IE is
identified by the IE Type.
### 7.6.10 Repeated Information Elements
An Information Element is repeated if there is more than one IE with the same
IE Type in the scope of the PFCP message (or in the scope of the grouped IE).
Such an IE is a member in a list.
If an information element is repeated in a PFCP signalling message in which
repetition of the information element is not specified, only the contents of
the information element appearing first shall be handled and all subsequent
repetitions of the information element shall be ignored. When the number of
repetitions of information elements is specified, only the contents of
specified repeated information elements shall be handled and all subsequent
repetitions of the information element shall be ignored.

NOTE 1: If the Bit 8 of Octet 1 is not set, this indicates that the IE is
defined by 3GPP and the Enterprise ID is absent. If Bit 8 of Octet 1 is set,
this indicates that the IE is defined by a vendor and the Enterprise ID is
present identified by the Enterprise ID.
An IE has the following mandatory fields:
\- Type: this field indicates the type of the Information Element. IE type
values within the range of 0 to 32767 are reserved for IE defined by 3GPP and
are listed in subclause 8.1.2 IE type values within the range of 32768 to
65535 are used for vendor-specific IE and the value allocation is controlled
by the vendor.
\- Length: this field contains the length of the IE excluding the first four
octets, which are common for all IEs (Type and Length) and is denoted \"n\" in
Figure 8.1.1-1 and in Figure 8.1.1-2. Bit 8 of the lowest numbered octet is
the most significant bit and bit 1 of the highest numbered octet is the least
significant bit.
An IE has the following optional fields:
\- Enterprise ID: if the IE type value is within the range of 32768 to 65535,
this field shall contain the IANA-assigned \"SMI Network Management Private
Enterprise Codes\" value of the vendor defining the IE. The Enterprise ID set
to \"10415\" (IANA-assigned \"SMI Network Management Private Enterprise
Codes\") shall not be used for the vendor specific IEs.
For illustration, Figure 8.1.1-2 depicts the format of a Information Element

### 8.1.2 Information Element Types
A PFCP message may contain several IEs. In order to have forward compatible
type definitions for the PFCP IEs, all of them shall be TLV (Type, Length,
Value) coded. PFCP IE type values are specified in the Table 8.1.2-1. The last
column of this table indicates whether the IE is:
\- Fixed Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and a fixed number of
octets;
\- Variable Length: the IE has a fixed set of fields, and has a variable
number of octets.\ For example, the last octets may be numbered similar to \"5
to (n+4)\". In this example, if the value of the length field, n, is 0, then
the last field is not present;
\- Extendable: the IE has a variable number of fields, and has a variable
number of octets.\ The last fields are typically specified with the statement:
\"These octet(s) is/are present only if explicitly specified\". The legacy
receiving entity shall ignore the unknown octets.
An IE of any of the above types may have a null length as specified in
subclause 5.6.3. This shall not be considered as an error by the receiving
PFCP entity.
In order to improve the efficiency of troubleshooting, it is recommended that
the IEs should be arranged in the signalling messages as well as in the
grouped IEs, according to the order the IEs are listed in the message
definition table or grouped IE definition table in section 7. However the
receiving entity shall be prepared to handle the messages with IEs in any
order.
Within IEs, certain fields may be described as spare. These bits shall be
transmitted with the value set to 0. To allow for future features, the
receiver shall not evaluate these bits.

The following flags are coded within Octet 5:
\- Bit 1 -- V4: If this bit is set to \"1\" and the CH bit is not set, then
the IPv4 address field shall be present, otherwise the IPv4 address field
shall not be present.
\- Bit 2 -- V6: If this bit is set to \"1\" and the CH bit is not set, then
the IPv6 address field shall be present, otherwise the IPv6 address field
shall not be present.
\- Bit 3 -- CH (CHOOSE): If this bit is set to \"1\", then the TEID, IPv4
address and IPv6 address fields shall not be present and the UP function shall
assign an F-TEID with an IP4 or an IPv6 address if the V4 or V6 bit is set
respectively. This bit shall only be set by the CP function.
\- Bit 4 -- CHID (CHOOSE ID): If this bit is set to \"1\", then the UP
function shall assign the same F-TEID to the PDRs requested to be created in a
Sx Session Establishment Request or Sx Session Modification Request with the
same CHOOSE ID value. This bit may only be set to \"1\" if the CH bit it set
to \"1\". This bit shall only be set by the CP function.
\- Bit 5 to 8: Spare, for future use and set to 0.
At least one of the V4 and V6 flags shall be set to \"1\", and both may be set

IPv6 address field may be present;
\- or when the UP function is requested to allocate the F-TEID, i.e. when
CHOOSE bit is set to \"1\", and the IPv4 address and IPv6 address fields are
not present.
Octet 6 to 9 (TEID) shall be present and shall contain a GTP-U TEID, if the CH
bit in octet 5 is not set. When the TEID is present, if both IPv4 and IPv6
addresses are present in the F-TEID IE, then the TEID value shall be shared by
both addresses.

Figure 8.2.5-1: SDF Filter
The following flags are coded within Octet 5:
\- Bit 1 -- FD (Flow Description): If this bit is set to \"1\", then the
Length of Flow Description and the Flow Description fields shall be present,
otherwise they shall not be present.
\- Bit 2 -- TTC (ToS Traffic Class): If this bit is set to \"1\", then the ToS
Traffic Class field shall be present, otherwise the ToS Traffic Class field
shall not be present.
\- Bit 3 -- SPI (Security Parameter Index): If this bit is set to \"1\", then
the Security Parameter Index field shall be present, otherwise the Security
Parameter Index field shall not be present.
\- Bit 4 -- FL (Flow Label): If this bit is set to \"1\", then the Flow Label
field shall be present, otherwise the Flow Label field shall not be present.
\- Bit 5 -- BID (Bidirectional SDF Filter): If this bit is set to \"1\", then
the SDF Filter ID shall be present, otherwise the SDF Filter ID shall not be
present.
\- Bit 6 to 8: Spare, for future use and set to 0.
The Flow Description field, when present, shall be encoded as an OctetString
as specified in subclause 5.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and subclause 5.2.1A.2A.
The ToS Traffic Class field, when present, shall be encoded as an OctetString
on two octets as specified in subclause 5.3.15 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8].
The Security Parameter Index field, when present, shall be encoded as an
OctetString on four octets and shall contain the IPsec security parameter
index (which is a 32-bit field), as specified in subclause 5.3.51 of 3GPP TS
29.212 [8].
The Flow Label field, when present, shall be encoded as an OctetString on 3
octets as specified in subclause 5.3.52 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [8] and shall
contain an IPv6 flow label (which is a 20-bit field). The bits 8 to 5 of the
octet \"v\" shall be spare and set to zero, and the remaining 20 bits shall
contain the IPv6 flow label.
An SDF Filter may:
\- be a pattern for matching the IP 5 tuple (source IP address or IPv6 network
prefix, destination IP address or IPv6 network prefix, source port number,
destination port number, protocol ID of the protocol above IP). In the
pattern:
\- a value left unspecified in a filter matches any value of the corresponding
information in a packet;
\- an IP address may be combined with a prefix mask;
\- port numbers may be specified as port ranges;
\- the pattern can be extended by the Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic
class (IPv6) and Mask;
\- consist of the destination IP address and optional mask, protocol ID of the
protocol above IP, the Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and
Mask and the IPsec Security Parameter Index (SPI);
\- consist of the destination IP address and optional mask, the Type of
Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask and the Flow Label
(IPv6).
NOTE 1: The details about the IPsec Security Parameter Index (SPI), the Type
of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask and the Flow Label
(IPv6) are defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [19] clause 15.3.
\- extend the packet inspection beyond the possibilities described above and
look further into the packet. Such service data flow filters need to be
predefined in the PGW-U, as specified in subclause 5.11 of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
NOTE 2: Such filters may be used to support filtering with respect to a
service data flow based on the transport and application protocols used above
IP, e.g. for HTTP and WAP. Filtering for further application protocols and
services can also be supported.
The SDF Filter ID, when present, shall be encoded as an Unsigned32 binary
integer value. It shall uniquely identify an SDF Filter among all the SDF
Filters provisioned for a given Sx Session. The source/destination IP address
and port information, in a bidirectional SDF Filter, shall be set as for
downlink IP flows. The SDF filter for the opposite direction has the same
parameters, but having the source and destination address/port parameters
swapped. When being provisioned with a bidirectional SDF filter in a PDR, the
UP function shall apply the SDF filter as specified in subclause 5.2.1A.2A.
### 8.2.6 Application ID
The Application ID IE type shall be encoded as shown in Figure 8.2.6-1. It
contains an Application Identifier referencing an application detection filter

Figure 8.2.43-1: FQ-CSID
Where FQ-CSID Node-ID Type values are:
0 indicates that Node-Address is a global unicast IPv4 address and p = 9.
1 indicates that Node-Address is a global unicast IPv6 address and p = 21.
2 indicates that Node-Address is a 4 octets long field with a 32 bit value
stored in network order, and p= 9. The coding of the field is specified below:
\- Most significant 20 bits are the binary encoded value of (MCC * 1000 \+
MNC).
\- Least significant 12 bits is a 12 bit integer assigned by an operator to an
MME, SGW-C, SGW-U, PGW-C or PGW-U. Other values of Node-Address Type are
reserved.
Values of Number of CSID other than 1 are only employed in the Sx Session
Delete Request.
The node that creates the FQ-CSID (i.e. SGW-C for SGW-C FQ-CSID, SGW-U for
SGW-U FQ-CSID, PGW-C for PGW-C FQâ€‘CSID and PGW-U for PGW-U FQâ€‘CSID) needs to
ensure that the Node-ID is globally unique and the CSID value is unique within
that node.

\- Bit 2 -- V6: If this bit is set to \"1\", then the IPv6 address field shall
be present, otherwise the IPv6 address field shall not be present.
\- Bit 3-5 -- TEID Range Indication (TEIDRI): the value of this field
indicates the number of bits in the most significant octet of a TEID that are
used to partition the TEID range, e.g. if this field is set to \"4\", then the
first 4 bits in the TEID are used to partition the TEID range.
\- Bit 6 -- Associated Network Instance (ASSONI): if this bit is set to \"1\",
then the Network Instance field shall be present, otherwise the Network
Instance field shall not be present.
\- Bit 7 -- Associated Source Interface (ASSOSI): if this bit is set to \"1\",
then the Source Interface field shall be present, otherwise the Source
Interface field shall not be present.

###### ## Annex A (Informative): PFCP Load and Overload Control Mechanism
## A.1 Throttling Aalgorithms
### A.1.1 \"Loss\" Throttling Algorithm
#### A.1.1.1 Example of Possible Implementation
This subclause provides an example of a possible implementation of the
\"Loss\" algorithm, amongst other possible methods.
It is possible to make use of a statistical loss function (e.g., random
selection of messages to throttle based on the indicated percentage) to decide
if the given message can be sent or need to be throttled. For example, the
source node generates a random number between (0, 100) for each message which
is a potential candidate for throttling. To realize 10% throttling, messages
with a random number 10 or less are throttled and hence this achieves
approximately a 10% reduction in the overall traffic. The actual traffic
reduction might vary slightly from the requested percentage, albeit by an
insignificant amount.
The algorithm can select certain messages to throttle in priority. For
example, implementations can distinguish between higher-priority and lower-
priority messages, and drop the lower-priority messages in favour of dropping
the higher priority messages, as long as the total reduction in traffic
conforms to the requested reduction in effect at the time. For example, in the
50-50 distribution of high priority and low priority messages, 20% reduction
to low priority messages and 0% reduction to high priority messages need to be
applied in order to achieve the effective reduction in traffic by 10% towards
the overloaded node.
###### ## Annex B (Normative): CP and UP Selection Functions with Control and
User Plane Separation
## B.1 CP Selection Function
### B.1.1 General
The SGW-C and PGW-C selection function shall follow the principles specified
in 3GPP TS 29.303 [25] for the SGW and PGW selection functions without Control
and User Plane Separation.
The following additional considerations apply with Control and User Plane
Separation:
1\. At most one SGW-C shall be selected per user at any time.
2\. The service area of an SGW-C function shall be aligned with the service
area of the corresponding SGW-U functions (see subclause 4.3.4 of 3GPP TS
23.214 [2]. All the SGW-U functions in the service area shall have a full
meshed connectivity with all the eNBs of TAs and/or all RNCs/BSCs of RAs
served by that service area.
3\. The SGW dynamic load reported to the MME/SGSN and the PGW dynamic load
reported to the MME/SGSN or TWAN/ePDG should take into account the operating
status of the CP and UP functions\' resources that the SGW-C/PGW-C is
controlling. See subclause 6.2.3 for how the CP function obtains load control
information from the UP function.
4\. For Dedicated Core Networks (see subclause 5.8 of 3GPP TS 29.303 [25]), an
SGW-C or PGW-C function shall be declared in DNS as dedicated to certain
mapped UE usage types if the CP function or if all the UP functions it
controls are dedicated to certain mapped UE usage types. In this case, the CP
function shall be provisioned in DNS with all the mapped UE usage types that
both the CP function and its UP functions support.
## B.2 UP Selection Function
### B.2.1 General
The following requirements apply for the selection of the UP function:
\- the SGW-C, PGW-C and TDF-C shall be responsible for the selection of the
SGW-U, PGW-U and TDF-U respectively;
\- an SGW-C may select different SGW-U functions for different PDN connections
of a same user.
It is implementation specific how to support the UP selection function
requirements specified in this clause. Subclause B.2.6 specifies one possible
implementation.
### B.2.2 SGW-U Selection Function
The SGW-C shall be able to select the SGW-U considering the following
parameters:
\- the SGW-U location and the user \'s location (i.e. ECGI, eNodeB ID or TAI
for E-UTRAN, RAI or RNC-ID for UTRAN);
\- the SGW-U\'s capabilities and the capabilities required for the particular
UE session to establish;
\- the mapped UE Usage Type (when dedicating SGW-U to specific Dedicated Core
Networks);
\- the SGW-U\'s dynamic load;
\- the SGW-U\'s relative static capacity (versus other SGW-Us).
Based on local policy, if the user\'s location information is required to be
used for selecting the UP function, the SGW-C shall determine the list of
candidate SGW-Us taking into account the user \'s location (ECGI, eNodeB ID or
TAI for E-UTRAN, RAI or RNC-ID for UTRAN).
The SGW-C shall select, among the candidate SGW-U functions, an SGW-U function
which supports all the capabilities required for the particular UE session,
considering the information received during the Sx Association Setup.
### B.2.3 PGW-U Selection Function
The PGW-C shall be able to select the PGW-U considering the following
parameters:
\- the requested APN for the PDN connection;
\- the PGW-U location and the user \'s location;
\- the PGW-U\'s capabilities and the capabilities required for the particular
UE session to establish;
\- the mapped UE Usage Type (when dedicating PGW-U to specific Dedicated Core
Networks);
\- the PGW-U\'s dynamic load;
\- the PGW-U\'s relative static capacity (versus other PGW-Us);
\- whether a PDN connection already exists for the same UE and APN, in which
case the same PGW-U shall be selected (to enable APN-AMBR enforcement);
NOTE: The SGW-U and PGW-U location can be configured in the SGW-C and PGW-C or
derived from DNS procedures as specified in subclause B.2.2.
If the PGW-C already assigned a PGW-U to the UE for the requested APN (e.g. UE
with multiple PDN connections to the same APN), the PGW-C shall select the
same PGW-U for the new PDN connection.
If a non-null IPv4 address and/or a IPv6 prefix is received in the PDN Address
Allocation (PAA) IE in the Create Session Request, e.g. static address
assignment in the user subscription, the PGW-C shall select a PGW-U which can
support the requested UE\'s IP address and/or IPv6 prefix.
Otherwise, the PGW-C shall determine the list of candidate PGW-Us taking into
account the requested APN.
The PGW-C shall select, among the candidate PGW-U functions, a PGW-U function
which supports all the capabilities required for the particular UE session,
considering the information received during the Sx Association Setup.
### B.2.4 Combined SGW-U/PGW-U Selection Function
A Combined SGW-C and PGW-C function shall be able to select a combined SGW-U
and PGW-U function. This shall be possible for all the UE\'s PDN connections,
as shown in Figure B.2.1-1.
Figure B.2.4 -1: SGW-U/PGW-U colocation with Control and User Plane Separation
A combined SGW-C/PGW-C function shall select the SGW-U and PGW-U as defined
respectively in B.2.2 and B.2.3, with the following additions:
\- the combined SGW-C/PGW-C function shall select the best couple of SGW-U and
PGW-U, for the requested APN, among all candidate couples of (SGW-U, PGW-U),
instead of selecting independently the SGW-U and the PGW-U.
### B.2.5 TDF-U selection function
The TDF-C shall be able to select the TDF-U as specified in subclause 5.12.5
of 3GPP TS 23.214 [2].
### B.2.6 UP Selection Function Based on DNS
#### B.2.6.1 General
This subclause specifies optional DNS procedures to select the SGW-U and PGW-U
functions and the requirements which apply when these procedures are
supported.
The relative static capacity of an SGW-U and PGW-U may be configured in the
DNS.
The Node ID of an SGW-U and PGW-U may take the form of a canonical node name
to allow the selection of a SGW-U and PGW-U with the best topological match.
#### B.2.6.2 SGW-U Selection Function Based on DNS
The SGW-C shall retrieve the list of candidate SGW-Us using DNS procedures
taking into account the user \'s location (ECGI, eNodeB ID or TAI for E-UTRAN,
RAI or RNC-ID for UTRAN), as specified in 3GPP TS 29.303 [25].
In non-roaming or LBO scenarios where the PGW-U is already selected (e.g. TAU
with SGW change) and when it is preferred to select a collocated node or a
topologically closer node, the SGW-C shall try to select an SGW-U collocated
with the PGW-U.
#### B.2.6.3 PGW-U Selection Function Based on DNS
The PGW-C shall retrieve the list of candidate PGW-Us using DNS procedures
taking into account the requested APN, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.303 [25].
In non-roaming or LBO scenarios, when it is preferred to select a collocated
node or a topologically closer node, i.e. when such preference is indicated in
the canonical node names of the PGW-U functions in the DNS (using \"topon\" as
the first label of canonical node name), the PGW-C shall give precedence to
collocation of SGW-U and PGW-U, then to topological closeness (i.e. pairs of
SGW-U and PGW-U with canonical node names with the highest number of matching
labels). This requires the SGW-C to provide the SGW-U Node ID to the PGW-C.
#### B.2.6.4 Combined SGW-U/PGW-U Selection Function Based on DNS
A combined SGW-C/PGW-C function shall select the SGW-U and PGW-U as defined
respectively in B.2.4, B.2.6.2 and B.2.6.3.
###### ## Annex C (Informative): Examples scenarios
## C.1 General
This clause provides example call flows illustrating how the CP function can
provision the UP function to support certain functionalities.
This Annex is informative and the normative descriptions in this specification
and in 3GPP TS 23.214 [2] prevail over the descriptions in this Annex if there
is any difference.
## C.2 Charging Support
### C.2.1 Online Charging
#### C.2.1.1 Online Charging Call Flow -- Normal Scenario
Figure C.2.1.1-1 illustrates the exchanges taking place over the Sxb or Sxc
reference points when applying online charging. In this example, the OCS
grants quotas by chunks of 100 Mbytes and requests the CP function to request
new credits when the remaining credit falls below 10 Mbytes.
Figure C.2.1.1-1: Online charging with intermediate and final quotas
1\. Upon the request from the CP function, the OCS grants an intermediate
quota of 100 Mbytes and requests the CP function to request a new credit when
the remaining credit falls below 10 Mbytes.
2\. The CP function sends an Sx Session Modification Request to the UP
function with an Update URR IE including the Volume Threshold IE set to 90
Mbytes and the Volume Quota IE set to 100 Mbytes.
3\. Upon reaching the Volume Threshold (i.e. 90 Mbytes), the UP function sends
an Sx Session Report Request to the CP function with a Usage Report IE
including the Usage Report Trigger set to \"Volume Threshold\" and the Volume
Measurement set to 90 Mbytes. The UP function continues to pass on traffic
until reaching the Volume Quota (i.e. an extra 10 Mbytes of traffic can be
passed on).
4\. Upon the request from the CP function, the OCS grants a new intermediate
quota of 100 Mbytes and requests the CP function to request a new credit when
the remaining credit falls below 10 Mbytes.
5\. The CP function sends an Sx Session Modification Request to the UP
function with an Update URR IE including the Volume Threshold IE set to 90
Mbytes and the Volume Quota IE set to 100 Mbytes. If the UP function had
forwarded e.g. 5 Mbytes of traffic since the last usage report, the UP
function knows that it shall send the next usage report upon passing on an
extra 85 Mbytes of traffic.
6\. Upon reaching the Volume Threshold (i.e. 90 Mbytes), the UP function sends
an Sx Session Report Request to the CP function with a Usage Report IE
including the Usage Report Trigger set to \"Volume Threshold\" and the Volume
Measurement set to 90 Mbytes. The UP function continues to pass on traffic
until reaching the Volume Quota (i.e. an extra 10 Mbytes of traffic can be
passed on).
7\. Upon the request from the CP function, the OCS grants a new final quota of
50 Mbytes and requests the CP function to terminate the service or to redirect
the traffic towards a redirect destination when the quota is consumed.
8\. The CP function sends an Sx Session Modification Request to the UP
function with an Update URR IE including the Volume Quota IE set to 50 Mbytes.
If the UP function had forwarded e.g. 5 Mbytes of traffic since the last usage
report, the UP function knows that it shall send the next usage report upon
passing on an extra 45 Mbytes of traffic.
9\. Upon reaching the Volume Quota (i.e. 50 Mbytes), the UP function sends an
Sx Session Report Request to the CP function with a Usage Report IE including
the Usage Report Trigger set to \"Volume Quota\" and the Volume Measurement
set to 50 Mbytes. The UP function stops passing on traffic.
10\. Upon being notified that the final quota has been reached, the CP
function terminates the service (e.g. by preventing the traffic of the
corresponding SDF to further pass on in the UP function) or redirects the
traffic towards a redirect destination by provisioning a Redirect Information
IE within the FAR associated to the traffic.
#### C.2.1.2 Online Charging Call Flow with Credit Pooling
##### C.2.1.2.1 General
Figure C.2.1.2-1 illustrates a signalling flow over the Sxb and Gy reference
points when applying online charging, and when the CP function (i.e. PGW-C) is
instructed by the OCS to handle a Credit Pool for a given Gy Session.
##### C.2.1.2.2 Example Call Flow 1
In this example, the PGW-C is instructed by the OCS to handle a credit pool
for two Rating Groups, RG1 and RG2. The PGW-C provisions two URRs, URR1 and
URR2, for the two RGs respectively, and a URR3 for the Credit Pool. The PGW-C
provisions the URR1 and URR2 with the quota received from the OCS respectively
for RG1 and RG2 (like if there was no credit pooling).
This reflects one possible implementation option, whereby each quota remains
managed independently from the others. This approach can result in extra usage
reports being sent over Sxb for RG1 or RG2 before the credit pool is
exhausted.
Figure C.2.2.2-1: Online charging with Credit Pooling (alt 1)
> 1\. Upon the request from the CP function for RG1 and RG2, the OCS grants:
RG1: quota 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included
within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG1), where the G-S-U-Pool-
Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to
which the RG1 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for
which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the
multiplier (e.g. 0.1);
RG2: quotas 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included
within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG2), where the G-S-U-Pool-
Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to
which the RG2 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for
which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the
multiplier (e.g. 0.5);
2\. The CP function sends an Sx Session Modification Request to the UP
function, to create:
A new URR1 for RG1, quota=100, Linked URR = URR3;\ A new URR2 for RG2,
quota=100, Linked URR = URR3;\ A new URR3 for Pool, quota = S = 100 x 0.1 +
100 x 0.5 = 60, Aggregated URRs: URR1 with Multiplier 0.1 and URR2 with
Multiplier 0.5.
The UP function accepts the request.
3\. The RG1 has consumed 100 counted by URR1, RG2 consumed 10 counted by URR2;
the URR3 for the Credit Pool counts U = 100 x 0.1 + 10 x 0.5 = 15 \= S = 60. So the UP function sends
an Sx Session Report Request, including the Usage Reports for:\ \- the URR3,
generated due to reaching quota (60),\ \- for the URR1, generated due to that
it is linked to the URR3 and it has reached the quota 100, and\ \- for the
URR2 generated due to that it is linked to the URR3.\ The CP function sends
the response message.
11\. The CP function requests new Quota for RG1 and RG2 to the OCS. The OCS
grants 200M for RG1 and 100M for RG2, with the same pool ID and Multipliers.
12\. The CP function sends an Sx Session Modification Request to the UP
function with the modified URRs, for URR1, URR2 and URR3.
##### C.2.1.2.3 Example Call Flow 2
In this example, the PGW-C is instructed by the OCS to handle a credit pool
for two Rating Groups, RG1 and RG2. The PGW-C provisions two URRs, URR1 and
URR2, for the two RGs respectively, and a URR3 for the Credit Pool. The PGW-C
provisions the quotas for URR1 and URR2 taking into account the credit pool
quota and the multipliers of the RGs.
This reflects another possible implementation option. This approach avoids
extra usage reports being sent over Sxb for RG1 or RG2 before the credit pool
is exhausted, and thus reduces Sxb signalling.
Figure C.2.2.3-2: Online charging with Credit Pooling (alt 2)
1\. Upon the request from the CP function for RG1 and RG2, the OCS grants:
RG1: quota 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included
within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG1), where the G-S-U-Pool-
Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to
which the RG1 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for
which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the
multiplier (e.g. 0.1);
RG2: quotas 100 Mbytes, together with a G-S-U-Pool-Reference AVP included
within the Multiple Services Credit Control (for RG2), where the G-S-U-Pool-
Identifier AVP indicating the identifer (e.g. 1000) of the Credit Pool to
which the RG2 pertains, the CC-Unit-Type AVP specifies the type of units for
which credit is (e.g. total octets), the Unit-Value AVP specifies the
multiplier (e.g. 0.5);
2\. The CP function sends an Sx Session Modification Request to the UP
function, to create:
A new URR1 for RG1, quota=600, Linked URR = URR3;\ A new URR2 for RG2,
quota=120, Linked URR = URR3;\ And new URR3 for Pool, quota = S = 100 x 0.1 +
100 x 0.5 = 60, Aggregated URRs: URR1 with Multiplier 0.1 and URR2 with
Multiplier 0.5.
The UP function accepts the request.
NOTE 1: To avoid receiving usage report upon exceeding the original Quota for
RG1 or RG2, the quota can be set to 60 / 0.1 = 600 for RG1, assuming RG1
consumes the complete Quota for the pool; similarly, for RG2, the quota can be
set to 60 / 0.5 = 120;
3\. The URR3 always first reaches the Quota, e.g. when the URR1 has counted
400, and URR2 has counted 40, this results the counted usage for the Credit
Pool U=400 x 0.1 + 40 x 0.5 = 60. So the UP function sends an Sx Session
Report Request, including the Usage Reports:
> \- for the URR3, generated due to that it has reached quota (60),\ \- for
> the URR1, generated due to that it is linked to the URR3 and\ \- for the
> URR2, generated due to that it is linked to the URR3.
>
> The CP function sends the response message.
4\. The CP function requests new Quota for RG1 and RG2 to the OCS. The OCS
grants 200M for RG1 and 100M for RG2, with the same pool ID and Multipliers.
5\. The CP function sends an Sx Session Modification Request to the UP
function with the modified URRs, for URR1, URR2 and URR3.
URR1 for RG1, quota=70 / 0.1 = 700; \ URR2 for RG2, quota=70 / 0.5 = 140; \
URR3 for The Credit Pool, quota = 200 x 0.1 + 100 x 0.5 = 70.
