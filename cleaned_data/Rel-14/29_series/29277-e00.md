# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the stage 3 of the Evolved Packet System S102
interface between the MME and the 1x CS IWS to relay the 1xCS signalling
messages documented in 3GPP TS 23.216 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.272 [4]. 1x CS
signalling messages are those messages that are defined for A21 interface as
described in 3GPP2 A.S0008-D [3] and 3GPP2 A.S0009-D [6]. The S102 interface
messages shall be based on A21 messages.
The S102 interface is used to support UEs that do not transmit and receive on
both the LTE and 1x radio interfaces simultaneously. S102 protocol aspects for
SRVCC from E-UTRAN access to 3GPP2 1xCS is covered in this specification.
Handling of non-voice component and protocol aspects for SRVCC from 3GPP2 1xCS
to E-UTRAN direction is not specified in this release.
The S102 interface is also used to support CS fallback to 1xRTT procedures
from E-UTRAN access to CDMA 1x RTT CS domain and to support SMS over S102 with
the CDMA 1xRTT CS domain through support of registration over EPS procedures
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.272[4].

# 6 S102 Messages and Message Formats
## 6.1 Introduction
The S102 application defines a set of messages between the MME and 1xCS IWS to
provide SR VCC and CSFB. The messages to be used are described in the
following sections.
The S102 messages shall be based on A21 messages. The following A21 messages
shall be used to support interworking and CS fallback to 1x RTT procedures
between MME and 1xCS IWS.
## 6.1 Message Formats
## 6.2 S102 Messages
### 6.2.1 A21-1x Air Interface Signalling message
This message is A21-1x air interface signalling message specified in 3GPP2
A.S0008-D [3] and 3GPP2 A.S0009-D [6]. This message shall be sent from an MME
or 1xCS IWS to transport 1x air interface message to the peer 1xCS IWS or MME.
The MME shall be provisioned to be able to reach a 1XCS IWS over the S102
interface. The IWS shall then decide which MSC to contact. The MME selects the
1XCS IWS based on the Reference Cell ID that it receives via the eNodeB.
This message shall be used by the MME or 1xCS IWS during Registration, paging,
handover (SRVCC) procedures, and mobile originated and mobile terminated SMS
procedures.
When the MME receives a 1x air interface message from the UE that is to be
sent to 1xCS IWS, the MME encapsulates the 1x air interface message in a
A21-1x air interface signalling message and sends it to the 1xCS IWS via the
S102 interface. To support CS fallback to 1xRTT registration procedures, it
contains the CDMA 2000 sector ID.
When sent from the 1xCS IWS to the MME, the 1xCS IWS encapsulates the 1x
handoff direction message or 1xRTT CS paging request (after successful
registration for CS fallback to 1xRTT) into A21-1x air interface signalling
message.
Details about Information Element contents of A21-1x Air Interface signalling
messages are found in 3GPP2 A.S0008-D [3] section 5.1.6.1.
### 6.2.2 A21-Ack message
This message is A21-Ack message specified in 3GPP2 A.S0008-D [3] and 3GPP2
A.S0009-D [6]. This message shall be sent from an MME or 1xCS IWS to
acknowledge receipt of some A21 message to the peer 1xCS IWS or MME.
The Correlation ID in a A21-Ack message shall be copied from the request
message that the MME or 1xCS IWS is replying to.
Details about Information Element contents of S102-Ack message are found in
3GPP2 A.S0008-D [3] section 5.1.6.2.
### 6.2.3 A21-Event Notification
This message is A21-Event Notification message specified in 3GPP2 A.S0008-D
[3] and 3GPP2 A.S0009-D [6]. This message shall be sent by either MME or 1xCS
IWS to notify the peer node of a specific event.
To support S102 tunnel redirection in case of MME relocation, \"S102
Redirection\" value shall be used.
To support notifying the 1xCS IWS, specifically if the UE switches off or if
the MME changes the UE EMM state to EMM-DEREGISTERED, i.e. if the UE becomes
unreachable, the \"Power Down/Connection Closed Event\" value shall be used.
Details about Information Element contents of S102-Event Notification message
are found in 3GPP2 A.S0008-D [3] section 5.1.6.4.
## 6.3 Reliable Delivery of Signalling Messages
The A21 messages are transmitted using best-effort service.
## 6.4 Information Elements
### 6.4.1 Information Element Assignments
An A21 message may contain several information elements. Detailed information
about the contents of the A21 messages is specified in 3GPP2 A.S0008-D [3] and

encapsulated PDU or any other GCSNA information including 3G1x parameters, to
be transported over the S102 interface. The IE is passed transparently for the
MME. Details of inclusion rules, format and contents of this IE are specified
in 3GPP2 A.S0008-D [3] and 3GPP2 A.S0009-D [6].
#### 6.4.1.10 GCSNA Status
This IE contains the GCSNA status information to be transported over the S102
interface. The MME maps the Status field values (Handoff successful, Handoff
failure) from the GCSNA Status IE to the CDMA2000 HO Status IE (enumeration
values HO Success and HO Failure, as defined in 3GPP TS 36.413 [5]). Details
of inclusion rules, format and contents of this IE are specified in 3GPP2
A.S0008-D [3] and 3GPP2 A.S0009-D [6].
The Activity Type field in the 1x IWS to MME direction provides information to
the MME regarding the activity (i.e. SMS or CSFB) being undertaken as a result
of processing of the GCSNA PDU at the UE. The MME may use the Activity Type
indication received from the 1x IWS in order to control the paging based on
operator policy, such as:
\- paging retransmission strategies;
\- determining whether to send the Paging message to the eNodeBs during
certain MME high load conditions.
The Call Priority field in the 1x IWS to MME direction indicates the priority
of the activity being undertaken for CSFB Priority Call Handling (see 3GPP TS
23.272 Annex B).
The Global Emergency Call field in the MME to 1x IWS direction indicates
whether the call is an emergency call.
#### 6.4.1.11 Reference Cell ID

included by the MME whenever the MME receives the 1xRTT Pilot List from the
eNodeB. Details of format and contents of this IE are specified in 3GPP2
A.S0008-D [3] and 3GPP2 A.S0009-D [6].
#### 6.4.1.13 Void
# 7 Error Handling
## 7.1 Protocol Errors
A protocol error is defined as a message with unknown, unforeseen or erroneous
content. When the Tack timer expires, the sender may resend the request to the
receiver and restart the Tack timer a configurable number of times. A cause
value of \"Unspecified\" as indicated in section 6.4.1.7 shall be included in
the response message to indicate protocol errors.
Detailed error handling procedures specific to each A21 message are found in
3GPP2 A.S0008-D [3] section 2.8.2 and 3GPP2 A.S0009-D [6].
## 7.2 Restoration and Recovery
There are no new specific Restoration and recovery requirements to be
supported over S102 interface.
# 8 Security provided to Communication over the S102 Interface
Protection of A21 communication over S102 interface shall be provided
according to security mechanisms defined in 3GPP2 A.S0008-D [3] and 3GPP2
A.S0009-D [6].
# 9 S102 Parameters
## 9.1 Timers
### 9.1.1 Introduction
The parameters defined here and their recommended values shall not be fixed,
but shall be possible to configure as described in section \"Reliable delivery
of messages\".
The method used for retry sending of messages on S102 shall be based on the
A21 retry method. In 3GPP2 A.S0008-D [3] section 2.8.2 and 3GPP2 A.S0009-D
[6], the procedures for each of the A21 messages have a \"Failure Operation\"
section where there are references to the use of timers and retries. In
addition, there are flows in section 4.6 provided.
### 9.1.2 Acknowledgement Timer (Tack)
This timer is started when the MME or 1xCS IWS sends an A21-1x Air interface
signalling message or a A21 Event Notification message and is stopped when the
corresponding A21-Ack message is received from the peer 1xCS IWS or MME.
Further details about recommended timer values and specifics are found in
3GPP2 A.S0008-D [3] section 5.3 and 3GPP2 A.S0009-D [6].
