# Introduction
The present document specifies the user plane protocol used between two Media
Gateways in the CS core network. Through out the present document this
protocol shall be referred to as the Nb UP protocol. The Nb UP protocol is for
a large part identical to the Iu UP protocol (see 3GPP TS 25.415 [2]), and
only the differences between the two protocols are specified. This
specification defines the applicability of the UP, as defined in 3GPP TS
25.415 [2], for the Nb interface only.
Given that the Nb UP uses the same PDU types as the Iu UP, the term IuFP is
used to refer to the common framing.
For the purpose of the present document, any occurrence of the term \"Iu UP\"
in the corresponding sections of 3GPP TS 25.415 [2], shall be interpreted as
\"Nb UP\".
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the user plane protocol of the bearer used
between two MGWs within the BICC-based CS core network, called the Nb UP
protocol. The present document assumes the implementation of the split between
call control and the bearer transport and control, as specified in 3GPP TS
23.205 [1], see figure 1. Note that the present document does not preclude an
implementation of a combined MSC Server and MGW.

# 4 User Plane
## 4.1 General aspects
The Nb UP is located in the user plane of the CS core network over the Nb
interface. It is used to convey data between MGWs.
The Nb UP protocol shall be initiated at one MGW and acknowledged by the
adjoining MGW.
The Nb UP framing is identical to the Iu UP framing, i.e., the same PDU types
are valid for both protocols.
Figure 2 shows the logical location of the Nb UP protocol layer in relation to
the Nb interface.
Figure 2: Nb UP protocol layer occurrence in overall architecture.
## 4.2 Operational and Functional Aspects
There are two modes of operation for the Nb UP:
\- Transparent mode;
\- Support mode for predefined SDU size.
The two modes of operation follow the definition of the corresponding Iu UP
modes of operation, as described in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
Support mode version 2 is mandatory on the NbUP interface. Support mode
version 1 is not required at the Nb but may be used if both MGWs support it,
as a result of the version negotiation during the Initialisation procedure.
# 5 Transparent Mode
This mode of operation is identical to that of the Iu UP protocol, see the
corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
# 6 Support mode for predefined SDU sizes
## 6.1 General
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
## 6.2 Nb UP protocol layer services in Support Mode
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
## 6.3 Services expected from the Transport Network Layer
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
## 6.4 Functions of the Nb UP protocol layer in Support Mode
### 6.4.1 Functional model of the Nb UP protocol layer in Support Mode
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
### 6.4.2 Frame handler function
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
### 6.4.3 Procedure control functions
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
### 6.4.4 Non Access Stratum data streams specific functions
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
#### 6.4.4.1 Frame quality classification
##### 6.4.4.1.1 General
On the Nb UP in Support Mode the frames are classified with the Frame Quality
Classifier (FQC). This classifying is based on frame classification on the
preceding link and the setting of the attribute \"Delivery of erroneous
SDUs\". The MSC server shall indicate the value of the attribute \"Delivery of
erroneous SDUs\" see 3GPP TS 29.232 [3].
Figure 4 shows the main input and output information for the frame quality
classification function on the Nb UP.
Figure 4: Frame quality classification in Nb UP
##### 6.4.4.1.2 Handling of FQC information
The handling of FQC shall be as specified in Table 1.
Table 1. FQC handling in Nb UP protocol, receiving side
* * *
Input Action  
Delivery of erroneous SDUs FQC in received PDU Payload CRC  
\'yes\' or \'no\' \'good\' OK Leave FQC unchanged. Forward SDU and FQC to
upper layer 'yes' 'bad radio' OK Leave FQC unchanged. Forward SDU and FQC to
upper layer \'yes\' \'good\' or 'bad radio' Not OK Set FQC to \'bad\'. Forward
SDU and FQC to upper layer 'yes' 'bad' Any Leave FQC unchanged. Forward SDU
and FQC to upper layer \'no\' \'good\' Not OK Drop SDU 'no' 'bad' or 'bad
radio' Any Not applicable. SDUs are dropped at a previous link. \'no-error-
detection-consideration\' Any Any Leave FQC unchanged. Forward SDU and FQC to
upper layer
* * *
The FQC handling in the Nb UP protocol entity on the sending side is as
follows:
  * When the upper layer indicates an FQC value in the Nb-UP-DATA-Request message, an FQC shall be set in the PDU as indicated by the upper layer. If the upper layer does not indicate an FQC value, the FQC in the PDU shall be set to \'good\'.
  * When the upper layer indicates an FQC with the value \'bad\' to the Nb UP protocol layer, the Nb UP support functions may generate an erroneous payload CRC.
An MGW may ignore the settings of the \"delivery of erroneous SDUs\" property
of the 3GUP package if the MGW passes frames transparently through the UP
entities as described in 3GPP TS 29.232 [3].
## 6.5 Elementary procedures
### 6.5.1 Transfer of User Data procedure
#### 6.5.1.1 Successful operation
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2]. For the purpose of the
present document, the MGW replaces the function of the SRNC and the CN, and
the Nb replaces the function of the Iu.
When the MGW provides the Frame Number IE it shall be based on time according
to the handling on Iu (see 3GPP TS 25.415 [2]) for conversational and
streaming traffic class.
NOTE: The IuUP Frame Number IE is based on time also and therefore no
interworking of this IE is required.
#### 6.5.1.2 Unsuccessful operation
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2]. For the purpose of the
present document, the MGW replaces the function of the SRNC and the CN, and
the Nb replaces the function of the Iu.
### 6.5.2 Initialisation procedure
#### 6.5.2.1 Successful operation
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
For the EVS codec, Equal Error Protection (EEP) is applied on the radio
interface. Only class A bits are defined. Class B and Class C bits are not
present. Consequently each RAB sub-flow Combination Indication (RFCI)
corresponds to one bit rate of the selected EVS Configuration, as described in
3GPP TS 26.454 [11] subclause 5.
When an Nb UP layer protocol entity receives an initialisation status request
from the upper layer, it shall start the initialisation procedure. See 3GPP TS
29.232 [3], concerning the overall initialisation process. When an Nb UP layer
protocol entity receives an initialisation message it shall acknowledge this
message and indicate to the upper layer that an initialisation message has
been received. When an Nb UP layer protocol entity receives a positive
initialisation acknowledgement it shall indicate to the upper layer that a
positive initialisation acknowledgement has been received.
#### 6.5.2.2 Unsuccessful operation
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2]. A negative
acknowledgement triggers a repetition of the initialisation message. After N
~INIT~ unsuccessful repetitions, the initialisation procedure is terminated.
### 6.5.3 Rate Control
#### 6.5.3.1 Successful operation
##### 6.5.3.1.1 Rate control for codecs other than the EVS codec
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2]. When an Nb UP protocol
entity receives a rate control message over the Nb interface, it shall provide
an indication of the rate control to the upper layer. The rate control
indication is acknowledged on request from the upper layer.
##### 6.5.3.1.2 Rate and mode control for the EVS codec
For the EVS codec:
\- On the Iu interface, IuFP provides for rate control via the exchange of
RATE CONTROL and RATE CONTROL ACK PDUs.
\- On the Iu interface, CMR for EVS (EVS-CMR) as specified in 3GPP TS 26.453
[10] subclause 4.5 provides for in-band rate and mode control via the Codec
Mode Request (CMR) field of every codec frame (Speech or SID) and CMR-Only
frame.
\- On the Nb interface of the BICC-based CS CN, EVS-CMR as specified in 3GPP
TS 26.453 [10] subclause 4.5 provides for in-band rate and mode control via
the Codec Mode Request (CMR) field of every codec frame.
\- A MGW receiving an EVS-CMR over an Nb interface may modify its contents
based on local policies and include the resulting contents into the EVS-CMR
field of the outgoing speech frame on the Nb interface.
\- Interworking of rate control procedures at an MGW between an Nb interface
and a corresponding Iu interface only applies when the MGW bridges compatible
codec configurations between the interfaces without applying a transcoding
function.
\- A MGW receiving an EVS-CMR from an Nb interface may modify its contents
based on local policies and include the resulting contents into the EVS-CMR
field of the outgoing speech frame on the corresponding Iu interface.
\- An MGW receiving a rate control request and an EVS-CMR on an Iu interface
shall determine the lower limit of the maximum bit rates contained in each
request and include the resulting limit into the EVS-CMR field of the outgoing
speech frame on the corresponding Nb interface, with possible further
modifications to the EVS-CMR contents based on configured policies.
\- The rules by which the MGW may filter and modify the EVS-CMR contents
consist of the following:
1) The MGW shall not modify the EVS-CMR to increase the maximum bit rate;
2) If the MGW observes the incoming stream of speech frames or packets and
determines that a lower EVS mode is more appropriate, the MGW may modify the
EVS-CMRs sent in the opposite direction of the observed speech flow;
3) If the MGW modifies the EVS-CMR to decrease the maximum bit rate and the
resulting maximum bit rate no longer support the originally requested maximum
audio bandwidth, then the maximum audio bandwidth may be reduced by the MGW to
the next lower one that fits to the reduced maximum bit rate;
4) The MGW shall not modify the EVS-CMR in a way that results in a change of
the major operation mode (EVS primary mode or EVS AMR-WB IO mode);
NOTE: The MGW can be forced to change the major operation mode of an incoming
EVS-CMR when interworking between EVS and AMR-WB, during handover or after
handover.
5) When channel-aware mode is used, if the MGW observes the incoming stream of
speech frames or packets and determines that other channel-aware mode
parameters are more appropriate, the MGW may modify the EVS-CMRs, flowing in
the opposite direction of the observed speech flow to change the received
channel-aware offset to a bigger one (e.g. from 2 to 3) and the received
channel-aware depth to a lower, more robust one;
6) When channel-aware mode is used, the MGW shall not reduce the received
channel-aware offset or modify the received channel-aware depth a less robust
one;
7) The MGW should not block the channel-aware mode;
8) The MGW may modify the EVS primary mode in the received EVS-CMR to the EVS
Variable Bit Rate mode.
##### 6.5.3.1.3 Interworking of rate control between compatible AMR-WB and EVS
codec configurations
The EVS codec includes the EVS AMR-WB IO major operation mode and is therefore
TrFO-compatible to the AMR-WB codec, if the configurations are TrFO-
compatible. For example, AMR-WB on one MGW termination and EVS on the other
MGW termination are TrFO-compatible codecs, if the configurations are TrFO-
compatible.
If the MGW bridges compatible EVS codec configurations and AMR-WB codec
configurations:
\- If the codec of the incoming termination is EVS and the codec of the
outgoing termination is AMR-WB, then the rate control procedure for AMR-WB
shall apply at the outgoing termination, with the maximum rate equal to or
lower than the maximum rate received in the EVS-CMR. The MGW shall map
received EVS-CMRs to the selected configuration of the outgoing AMR-WB
termination.
\- If the codec of the incoming termination is AMR-WB and the codec of the
outgoing termination is EVS, then the rate control procedure for AMR-WB shall
apply on the incoming termination and shall determine the maximum rate
included in the EVS-CMR sent by the MGW. The MWG shall request the EVS AMR-WB
IO major operation mode in the outgoing EVS-CMR.
\- The MGW may filter and modify the CMR contents according to the following
rules:
1) The MGW shall not modify the EVS-CMR to increase the maximum bit rate;
2) If the MGW observes the incoming stream of speech frames or packets and
determines that a lower EVS mode is more appropriate, the MGW may modify the
EVS-CMRs sent in the opposite direction of the observed speech flow.
If the MGW bridges EVS codec configurations and AMR-WB codec configurations
which are not compatible, the MGW shall apply transcoding and shall handle the
independent rate and mode control procedures towards the incoming and the
outgoing networks.
#### 6.5.3.2 Unsuccessful operation
For codecs other than the EVS codec, see the corresponding section in 3GPP TS
25.415 [2]. Depending on the error cause, a negative acknowledgement is either
reported in a status indication to the upper layer, or it triggers a
repetition of the control command. After N ~RC~ unsuccessful repetitions, the
rate control procedure is terminated.
### 6.5.4 Time Alignment
#### 6.5.4.1 Successful operation
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2]. When an Nb UP protocol
entity receives a time alignment command over the Nb interface, it shall
indicate the time alignment to the upper layer. The time alignment is
acknowledged on request from the upper layer.
#### 6.5.4.2 Unsuccessful operation
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2]. Depending on the error
cause, a negative acknowledgement is either reported in a status indication to
the upper layer, or it triggers a repetition of the control command. After N
~TA~ unsuccessful repetitions, the time alignment procedure is terminated.
### 6.5.5 Handling of Error Event procedure
#### 6.5.5.1 Successful operation
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
#### 6.5.5.2 Unsuccessful operation
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
## 6.6 Elements for Nb UP communication in Support mode
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
## 6.7 Handling of unknown, unforeseen and erroneous protocol data
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
# 7 Communication Primitives for the Nb UP protocol layer
## 7.1 Modelling Principle
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
## 7.2 Primitives towards the upper layers at the CNL-SAP
See the corresponding section in 3GPP TS 25.415 [2].
## 7.3 Primitives towards the transport layers at TNL-SAP
### 7.3.1 General
Access to the Transport network Layer is performed through a generic SAP: TNL-
SAP.
When the Transport Network upper layer consists of AAL2, the TNL SAP maps to
the AAL-SAP which allows communication to be performed using specific AAL
primitives.
When the Transport Network upper layer consists of RTP/UDP/IP, the TNL-SAP
maps to the services provided by IETF RFC 1889 [7].
The choice of communication, specific or generic, through the TNL-SAP is fixed
by the Core Network Layer control plane logic. This choice of communication is
based on the requirements placed by, e.g. the RAB characteristics, the core
network domain requesting the RAB establishment or other operator\'s choice.
### 7.3.2 ATM/AAL2 based Transport Layer
#### 7.3.2.1 General
When the Nb UP protocol layer uses the services of an ATM/AAL2 transport, it
shall use an established AAL2 connection for transferring frames between the
peer TNL-SAPs at both ends of the Nb User plane access points. The Transport
Network Control Plane over the Nb interface handles the signalling to
establish and release the AAL2 call connections.
#### 7.3.2.2 AAL2 Service Primitives used by the Nb UP protocol
AAL2 services and primitives used at the Service Access Point from the AAL2
layer are shown in table 3.
Table 4: AAL2 primitives and parameters
* * *
Primitive Type Parameters Comments SSSAR-UNITDATA Request SSSAR-INFO  
SSSAR-UUI Not used (note) SSSAR-UNITDATA Indication SSSAR-INFO  
SSSAR-UUI Not used (note) NOTE: The setting of this field is set to not used
i.e. decimal value 26 according to ITU-T Q.366.1 [8].
* * *
These primitives are to be used in the Nb UP.
The Transport Network control plane is as specified in 3GPP TS 29.414 [4].
### 7.3.3 GTP-U based Transport Layer
Not applicable.
### 7.3.4 RTP/UDP/IP based Transport Layer
When the Nb UP protocol layer uses the services of an RTP-based transport, it
shall use a dynamic payload type that was negotiated for the connection for
transferring Nb UP frames between the two endpoints at both ends of the Nb
User plane access points. This dynamic payload type is negotiated using the
specified bearer control protocol, 3GPP TS 29.414 [4].
