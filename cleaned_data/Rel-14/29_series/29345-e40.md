### 5.2.2 Detailed behaviour of the ProSe Function in the HPLMN
The ProSe Function in the HPLMN shall make use of this procedure to request
service authorization information for ProSe related to the UE from the ProSe
Function in local PLMN or VPLMN. The ProSe Function shall include in the
request the UE identity (IMSI or MSISDN) and the PLMN-Id identifying the PLMN
of the requesting ProSe Function.
When receiving a ProSe Service Authorization response from the ProSe Function
in the local PLMN or VPLMN, the ProSe Function in the HPLMN shall check the
result code. If it indicates SUCCESS, the ProSe Function shall merge with its
own policy.
### 5.2.3 Detailed behaviour of the ProSe Function in the Local PLMN or VPLMN
When receiving a ProSe Service Authorization request, the ProSe Function in
the local PLMN or VPLMN shall, in the following order:
1\. Check whether the UE Identity (IMSI or MSISDN) exists. If not, a Result
Code of DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN shall be returned.
2\. Check whether ProSe is authorized for this UE Identity. If not, a Result
Code of DIAMETER_ERROR_UNAUTHORIZED_SERVICE shall be returned.
If there is an error in any of the above steps then the ProSe Function shall
stop processing the request and shall return the error code specified in the
respective step.
If the ProSe Function cannot fulfil the received request for reasons not
stated in the above steps, e.g. due to a database error or any of the required
actions cannot be performed, it shall stop processing the request and set the
Result Code to \"DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY\".
Otherwise, when the UE is authorized to use ProSe Direct Discovery or ProSe
Direct Communication in this PLMN, the ProSe Function shall return the
authorization data in the response, according to the supported/unsupported
features of the ProSe Function in the Local PLMN or VPLMN, and the authorised
announcing range (short/medium/long) at which and if the UE is allowed to
announce in the VPLMN according to the defined announcing authorisation policy
for this UE (see 3GPP TS 24.333 [26] for the possible values of the range) and
shall set the Result Code to \"DIAMETER_SUCCESS\".
## 5.3 ProSe Direct Discovery Authorization
### 5.3.1 General
The ProSe Direct Discovery Authorization Procedure shall be used between the
ProSe Function in the HPLMN and the ProSe Function in a Local PLMN or VPLMN to
obtain authorization for access to the discovery resources and perform ProSe
Direct Discovery. The procedure shall be invoked by the ProSe Function in the
HPLMN and is used:
\- to request the ProSe Function in the VPLMN or Local PLMN for the
authorization for ProSe Direct Discovery announcing when the announcing UE is
roaming in the VPLMN or announcing in a Local PLMN;
\- to perform the resolution ProSe Application ID Name to ProSe Application
Code and/or ProSe Application Mask when the ProSe Application ID has PLMN-
specific scope for open ProSe Direct discovery;
\- to notify the ProSe Function in Local PLMN that the previously allocated
ProSe Discovery Filter for a ProSe Application ID which has PLMN-specific
scope is no longer monitored by a monitoring UE of the HPLMN;
\- to perform the resolution of a target RPAUID to a ProSe Restricted Code or
ProSe Restricted Code Prefix for restricted ProSe Direct Discovery;
\- to provide the ProSe Function in the Local PLMN or VPLMN with the
application identity in order to allow it to perform charging;
\- to provide the ProSe Function in the Local PLMN or VPLMN with the UE
identity (i.e. IMSI or MSISDN) in order to allow to perform charging;
\- to provide the ProSe Function in VPLMN with the allocated ProSe Application
Code, ProSe Restricted Code or ProSe Restricted Code Prefix/Suffix Pool, and
the corresponding validity timer, or a notification of the termination or
change of the allocated ProSe-related codes, in order to allow to perform
charging.
\- to provide the ProSe Function in VPLMN with the allocated ProSe Query Code
or ProSe Response Code and the corresponding validity timer when such a code
is announced in restricted ProSe Direct Discovery model B procedure, in order
to allow to perform charging.
\- to provide the ProSe Function in VPLMN/Local PLMN with the allocated ProSe
Query Code, ProSe Response Code and associated validity timer for a given
RPAUID using restricted ProSe Direct Discovery model B.
This procedure is mapped to the commands ProSe-Discovery-Request/Answer
(PDR/PDA) in the Diameter application specified in clause 6.

### 5.3.2 Detailed behaviour of the HPLMN ProSe Function
The ProSe Function in the HPLMN shall make use of this procedure to request
the ProSe Function in VPLMN or a PLMN other than the HPLMN/VPLMN for ProSe
Direct Discovery announcing authorisation for an announcing UE roaming in the
VPLMN or announcing in a Local PLMN.
\- For open ProSe Direct Discovery, the HPLMN ProSe Function shall include in
the request the Discovery Entry ID and shall include in the Discovery
Authorization Request the Discovery Type set to
\"ANNOUNCING_REQUEST_FOR_OPEN_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\", the ProSe Application
ID corresponding to the request from the announcing UE and the ProSe
Application Code or ProSe Application Code Prefix/Suffix(es) assigned for this
request. The Discovery Authorization Request shall include the UE identity
(i.e., IMSI or MSISDN) and the ProSe Validity Timer corresponding to ProSe
Application Code in order to allow the ProSe Function in VPLMN or the Local
PLMN to perform charging. If the announcing UE\'s original announce request is
for updating the metadata, the updated metadata shall also be included. If the
announcing UE\'s original announce request is for stopping the announcing
operation, the ProSe Function shall not include any ProSe Application Code(s)
or ProSe Validity Timer.
\- For restricted ProSe Direct Discovery, the HPLMN ProSe Function shall
include in the Discovery Authorization Request the Discovery Entry ID and the
Discovery Type set to
\"ANNOUNCING_REQUEST_FOR_RESTRICTED_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\", the application

VPLMN or the Local PLMN to perform charging. For restricted ProSe Direct
Discovery using application-controlled extension, the ProSe Function shall
include a ProSe Restricted Code Prefix and one or more ProSe Restricted Code
Suffix Range in the Discovery Authorization Request. If the announcing UE\'s
original announce request is for stopping the announcing operation, the ProSe
Function shall not include any ProSe Restricted Code or ProSe Restricted Code
Prefix or ProSe Restricted Code Suffix Range(s), or ProSe Validity Timer.
\- For restricted ProSe Direct Discovery model B discoverer operation, the
HPLMN ProSe Function shall include in the Discovery Authorization Request the
Discovery Entry ID and the Discovery Type set to
\"DISCOVERER_ANNOUNCING_REQUEST_FOR_RESTRICTED_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\", the
application identity, RPAUID corresponding to the discoverer UE as well as the
ProSe Query Code assigned for this request. The Discovery Authorization
Request shall also include the UE identity (i.e., IMSI or MSISDN) and the
ProSe Validity Timer corresponding to ProSe Query Code in order to allow the
ProSe Function in VPLMN or the Local PLMN to perform charging
\- For restricted ProSe Direct Discovery model B discoveree operation, the
HPLMN ProSe Function shall include in the Discovery Authorization Request the
Discovery Entry ID and the Discovery Type set to
\"DISCOVEREE_REQUEST_FOR_RESTRICTED_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\", the application
identity, RPAUID corresponding to the discoverer UE as well as the ProSe
Response Code assigned for this request. The Discovery Authorization Request
shall also include the UE identity (i.e., IMSI or MSISDN) and the ProSe
Validity Timer corresponding to ProSe Query Code in order to allow the ProSe
Function in VPLMN or the Local PLMN to perform charging.
The ProSe Function in the HPLMN shall make use of this procedure to retrieve
from the ProSe Function in the Local PLMN the Discovery Filter for monitoring
in open ProSe Direct Discovery or to retrieve parameters needed to create a
Restricted Discovery Filter, or ProSe Response Filter associated with the
monitored/queried application-layer identity for restricted ProSe Direct
Discovery.
\- For open ProSe Direct Discovery, the HPLMN ProSe Function shall include in
the request the Discovery Entry ID and shall include in the Discovery
Authorization Request the Discovery Type set to
\"MONITORING_REQUEST_FOR_OPEN_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\", the ProSe Application
ID name corresponding to the request from the monitoring UE. The Discovery
Authorization Request shall also include the UE identity (i.e., IMSI or
MSISDN) in order to allow the ProSe Function in Local PLMN to perform
charging. If the monitoring UE\'s original announce request is for stopping
the monitoring operation or the allocated Discovery Filter has been revoked by
the ProSe Function, the ProSe Function shall not include the ProSe Application
ID name.
\- For restricted ProSe Direct Discovery, the HPLMN ProSe Function shall
include in the Discovery Authorization Request the Discovery Entry ID and the
Discovery Type set to
\"MONITORING_REQUEST_FOR_RESTRICTED_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY, the application
identity, the requesting RPAUID, target RPAUID and target PDUID of a
monitoring target. The Discovery Authorization Request shall also include the
UE identity (i.e., IMSI or MSISDN) in order to allow the ProSe Function in

and the Discovery Entry ID in order to allow the ProSe Function in Local PLMN
to perform charging.
When receiving the ProSe Direct Discovery Authorization response with the
Result Code set to \"DIAMETER_SUCCESS\" for a request with the Discovery Type
set to \"MONITORING_REQUEST_FOR_OPEN_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\", the HPLMN ProSe
Function shall check whether a ProSe Discovery Filter is received for each
ProSe Application ID Name sent in the request. If a ProSe Discovery Filter is
missing for one ProSe Application ID Name, the ProSe Function shall consider
that there is no valid ProSe Discovery Filter the ProSe associated with this
ProSe Application ID Name in the ProSe Function in the Local PLMN or VPLMN.
When receiving the ProSe Direct Discovery Authorization response with the
Result Code set to \"DIAMETER_SUCCESS\" for a request with the Discovery Type
set to \"MONITORING_REQUEST_FOR_RESTRICTED_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\" or
\"DISCOVERER_REQUEST_FOR_RESTRICTED_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\", the HPLMN ProSe
Function shall enclose the information in Code Receiving Security Material
parameter in the discovery filter created for the target RPAUID. If a DUIK
parameter is included in the response message, the ProSe Function shall store
the DUIK in order to verify the MIC field, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.334
[22].
### 5.3.3 Detailed behaviour of the ProSe Function in the Local PLMN or VPLMN
When receiving a ProSe Direct Discovery Authorization request, the ProSe
Function in the Local PLMN or VPLMN shall check the value of the Discovery
Type.
\- If the value is \"ANNOUNCING_REQUEST_FOR_OPEN_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\", the

## 5.4 ProSe Match Report
### 5.4.1 General
The ProSe Match Report Procedure shall be used between the ProSe Function in
the HPLMN and the ProSe Function in the local PLMN identified by the PLMN-Id
contained in the ProSe Application Code(s) discovered by the monitoring UE..
The procedure shall be invoked by the ProSe Function in the HPLMN and is used:
\- to confirm that the ProSe Application Code(s) is authorized to be
transmitted on the monitored PLMN;
\- to retrieve the ProSe Application ID(s), associated validity timer(s) and
associated match report refresh timer(s) corresponding to the ProSe
Application Code(s) as well metadata associated with the ProSe Application ID
if available and requested by the UE; and
\- to provide the ProSe Function in the local PLMN with the identity (IMSI or
MSISDN) of the monitoring UE in order to allow to perform charging.
This procedure is mapped to the commands ProSe-Match-Request/Answer (PMR/PMA)
in the Diameter application specified in clause 6.
Table 5.4.1-1 specifies the involved information elements for the request.

### 5.4.2 Detailed behaviour of the HPLMN ProSe Function
The ProSe Function in the HPLMN shall make use of this procedure to retrieve
from the ProSe Function in the local PLMN (identified by the PLMN-Id contained
in the Prose Application Code) the ProSe Application ID(s) that correspond to
ProSe Application Code(s) discovered by the monitoring UE. The HPLMN ProSe
Function shall include in the Match Request the Discovery Type set to
\"MONITORING_REQUEST_FOR_OPEN_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\", the discovered ProSe
Application Code(s) corresponding to the request from the monitoring UE as
well as the MIC and UTC-based counter associated with the discovered ProSe
Application Code. The request shall include the UE identity (i.e. IMSI or
MSISDN) in order to allow the ProSe Function in the local PLMN to perform
charging of the monitoring UE. If the metadata information associated with the
ProSe Application ID is requested by the UE, the flag \"Metadata Requested\"
shall be set in the PMR Flags.
When receiving the ProSe Match Report response from the ProSe Function in the
local PLMN with the Result Code set to \"DIAMETER_SUCCESS\", the HPLMN ProSe
Function shall check whether a Match Report is received for each ProSe
Application Code sent in the request. If a Match Report is missing for one
ProSe Application Code, this ProSe Application Code shall be considered as
invalid by the ProSe Function.
### 5.4.3 Detailed behaviour of the ProSe Function in the local PLMN
When receiving a ProSe Match Report request, the ProSe Function in the local
PLMN shall check the value of the Discovery Type contained in the Match
Request.
\- If the value indicated in the Discovery Type is not supported, the
experimental result code shall be set to
\"DIAMETER_ERROR_INVALID_DISCOVERY_TYPE\" in the response.
\- If the value is \"MONITORING_REQUEST_FOR_OPEN_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\", the
ProSe Function shallcheck whether that the ProSe Application Code received is
authorized to be announced in the monitored PLMN.
\- If not, the experimental result code shall be set to
\"DIAMETER_ERROR_ANNOUNCING_UNAUTHORIZED_IN_PLMN\" in the response.
\- If the ProSe Code is authorized to be announced, the ProSe Function shall
check the validity of the ProSe Application Code(s) discovered by the
monitoring UE, i.e. a ProSe Application ID name is associated and the validity
timer has not expired, and the MIC value associated with the ProSe Application
Code is valid when verified based on the associated UTC-based counter as
defined in 3GPP TS 33.303 [23].
\- If none of the ProSe Application Code(s) is valid in the ProSe Function,
i.e. either no ProSe Application Code exists, the validity timer(s) has
expired, or MIC check(s) for the ProSe Application Code(s) has failed, the
experimental result code shall be set to
\"DIAMETER_ERROR_INVALID_APPLICATION_CODE\" in the response sent by the ProSe
Function.
\- Otherwise, when at least one ProSe Application Code is valid, the ProSe
Function shall return the Match Report and set the result code to
\"DIAMETER_SUCCESS\" in the response. For each valid ProSe Application code,
the Match Report shall contain the matched ProSe Application Code, the ProSe
Application ID Name, the validity timer and the match report refresh timer.
The Match Report may include metadata associated with the ProSe Application ID
if requested and available. The ProSe Function may store the monitoring UE
identity (i.e. IMSI or MSISDN) in order to perform charging.
If there is an error in any of the above steps then the ProSe Function shall
stop processing the request and shall return the error code specified in the
respective step.
If the ProSe Function cannot fulfil the received request for reasons not
stated in the above steps, e.g. due to a database error or any of the required
actions cannot be performed, it shall stop processing the request and set the
Result Code to \"DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY\".
If the ProSe Application Code contains a metadata index, a ProSe-Metadata-
Index-Mask AVP shall be provided for this ProSe Application Code.
## 5.5 ProSe Match Report info
### 5.5.1 General
For open discovery, the ProSe Match Report Info Procedure shall be used by the
ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the monitoring UE to provide a match report
information to the ProSe Function of the visited PLMN in which the announcing
UE is roaming. For restricted discovery, the ProSe Match Report Info Procedure
shall also be used by the ProSe Function in the HPLMN of the monitoring UE or
discoverer UE to provide a match report information to the ProSe Function of
the HPLMN of the announcing UE or discoveree UE.
This procedure is mapped to the commands ProSe-Match-Report-Info-
Request/Answer (PIR/PIA) in the Diameter application specified in clause 6.
Table 5.5.1-1 specifies the involved information elements for the request.
Table 5.5.1-2 specifies the involved information elements for the answer.

### 5.5.2 Detailed behaviour of the requesting ProSe Function
When the monitored PLMN-Id provided by the monitoring UE during the Match
Report procedure (see clause 5.4) is different from the PLMN-Id contained in
the ProSe Application Code discovered by the monitoring UE, i.e. the
announcing UE is roaming in a visited PLMN, the monitoring UE\'s ProSe
Function in the HPLMN may make use of this procedure to send a match report
information to the ProSe Function in the visited PLMN in which the announcing
UE is roaming.. In such case, the HPLMN ProSe Function shall include in the
Match Report Information the Discovery Type set to
\"MONITORING_REQUEST_FOR_OPEN_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\" as well as the ProSe
Application ID and the identity of the monitoring UE (i.e. IMSI or MSISDN).
When the HPLMN ProSe Function of the monitoring UE processes a match report
for a discovered ProSe Restricted Code from the UE, and finds that the target
PDUID for the corresponding discovery entry contains a PLMN-Id different from
the PLMN of the ProSe Function, the monitoring UE\'s ProSe Function in the
HPLMN may make use of this procedure to send a match report information to the
ProSe Function to which the announcing UE belongs. In such case, the HPLMN
ProSe Function shall include in the Match Report Information the Discovery
Type set to \"MONITORING_REQUEST_FOR_RESTRICTED_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\", the
ProSe Restricted Code, the RPAUID, the target RPAUID and the identity of the
monitoring UE (i.e. IMSI or MSISDN). The ProSe Function may also include the
timestamp of the match event in the Match Report Information.
When the HPLMN ProSe Function of the discoverer UE processes a match report
for a discovered ProSe Response Code from the discoverer UE, and finds that
the target PDUID for the corresponding discovery entry contains a PLMN-Id
different from the PLMN of the ProSe Function, the discoverer UE\'s ProSe
Function in the HPLMN may make use of this procedure to send a match report
information to the ProSe Function to which the discoveree UE belongs. In such
case, the HPLMN ProSe Function shall include in the Match Report Information
the Discovery Type set to
\"DISCOVERER_REQUEST_FOR_RESTRICTED_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\", the ProSe
Response Code, the RPAUID, the target RPAUID and the identity of the
discoverer UE (i.e. IMSI or MSISDN). The ProSe Function may also include the
timestamp of the match event in the Match Report Information.
### 5.5.3 Detailed behaviour of the receiving ProSe Function
When receiving a ProSe Match Report Info request, the ProSe Function shall
check the value of the Discovery Type contained in the Match Report
Information.
\- If the value indicated in the Discovery Type is not supported, the
experimental result code shall be set to
\"DIAMETER_ERROR_INVALID_DISCOVERY_TYPE\" in the response.
\- If the value is \"MONITORING_REQUEST_FOR_OPEN_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\",
\"MONITORING_REQUEST_FOR_RESTRICTED_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\" or
\"DISCOVERER_REQUEST_FOR_RESTRICTED_PROSE_DIRECT_DISCOVERY\", the ProSe
Function shall check whether the UE Identity (i.e. IMSI or MSISDN) exists.
\- If not, a Result Code of DIAMETER_ERROR_USER_UNKNOWN shall be returned.
\- Otherwise, it shall acknowledge the reception of the Match Report info and
set the Result Code to \"DIAMETER_SUCCESS\" in the response.
If the ProSe Function in the VPLMN cannot fulfil the received request for
reasons not stated in the above steps, e.g. due to a database error or any of
the required actions cannot be performed, it shall stop processing the request
and set the Result Code to \"DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY\" in the response.
## 5.6 ProSe Proximity Request
### 5.6.1 General
The ProSe Proximity Request Procedure shall be used by a ProSe Function in
charge of the requesting UE to request the ProSe Function in charge of another
UE to indicate when two UEs will enter into proximity within a requested time
window.
This procedure is mapped to the commands ProSe-Proximity-Request/Answer
(PRR/PRA) in the Diameter application specified in clause 6.
Table 5.6.1-1 specifies the involved information elements for the request.

### 5.6.2 Detailed behaviour of the ProSe Function of the requesting UE
The ProSe Function of the UE triggering the Proximity request shall make use
of this procedure to propagate the Proximity request to the ProSe Function of
the targeted UE. The ProSe Function shall include in the request the EPC ProSe
User Identities of the requesting and targeted UEs, the location of the
requesting UE, the validity period of the Proximity request and, the location
update trigger. If the requesting UE has requested EPC support for WLAN direct
discovery and communication with the targeted UE, the PRR-Flag \"WLAN
Indication\" shall be set.
NOTE: The location update trigger enable the ProSe Function of the targeted UE
to configure SUPL reporting in targeted UE using the \"\"Inside\" trigger with
Repeated Reporting\" mechanism as defined in OMA AD SUPL [25].
When receiving a ProSe Proximity response from the ProSe Function of the
targeted UE, the ProSe Function of the requesting UE shall check the result
code. If it indicates SUCCESS, the ProSe Function shall create and manage a
context associated with the Proximity request, including the EPUIDs of the
UEs, the validity period of this Proximity request and the WLAN indication
received in the Proximity request until the execution of the Proximity Alert
procedure, the Proximity Request Cancellation procedure or until the expiry of
the time window during which the request is valid.
### 5.6.3 Detailed behaviour of the ProSe Function of the targeted UE

stated in the above steps, e.g. due to a database error or any of the required
actions cannot be performed, it shall set the Result Code to
\"DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY\".
# 6 Protocol Specification and Implementation
## 6.1 Introduction
### 6.1.1 Use of Diameter base protocol
The Diameter Base Protocol as specified in IETF RFC 6733 [29] shall apply
except as modified by the defined support of the methods and the defined
support of the commands and AVPs, result and error codes as specified in this
specification. Unless otherwise specified, the procedures (including error
handling and unrecognised information handling) shall be used unmodified.
### 6.1.2 Securing Diameter Messages
For secure transport of Diameter messages, see 3GPP TS 33.210 [8].
### 6.1.3 Accounting functionality
Accounting functionality (Accounting Session State Machine, related command
codes and AVPs) shall not be used on the PC6/PC7 interfaces.
### 6.1.4 Use of sessions
Between the ProSe Functions, Diameter sessions shall be implicitly terminated.
An implicitly terminated session is one for which the server does not maintain
state information. The client shall not send any re-authorization or session
termination requests to the server.
The Diameter base protocol includes the Auth-Session-State AVP as the
mechanism for the implementation of implicitly terminated sessions.
The client (server) shall include in its requests (responses) the Auth-
Session-State AVP set to the value NO_STATE_MAINTAINED (1), as described in
IETF RFC 6733 [29]. As a consequence, the server shall not maintain any state
information about this session and the client shall not send any session
termination request. Neither the Authorization-Lifetime AVP nor the Session-
Timeout AVP shall be present in requests or responses.
### 6.1.5 Transport protocol
Diameter messages over the PC6/PC7 interfaces shall make use of SCTP IETF RFC
4960 [9].
### 6.1.6 Routing considerations
This clause specifies the use of the Diameter routing AVPs Destination-Realm
and Destination-Host.
The Destination-Realm AVP shall contain the network domain name of the
targeted ProSe Function. The network domain name is either known by the
sending ProSe Function or derived from the PLMN-Id of the targeted ProSe
Function to construct the EPC Home Network Realm/Domain, as indicated in 3GPP
TS 23.003 [4], clause 19.2.
If a ProSe Function knows the address/name of the ProSe Function in charge of
a given UE, and the associated network domain name, both the Destination-Realm
and Destination-Host AVPs shall be present in the request.
If a ProSe Function knows only the network domain name, the Destination-Realm
AVP shall be present and the command shall be routed to the next Diameter
node.
Consequently, the Destination-Realm AVP is declared as mandatory and the
Destination-Host AVP is declared as optional in the ABNF for all requests
initiated by a ProSe Function.
If the Vendor-Specific-Application-ID AVP is received in any of the commands
defined in this specification, it shall be ignored by the receiving node, and
it shall not be used for routing purposes.
### 6.1.7 Advertising Application Support
The ProSe Functions shall advertise support of the Diameter Inter ProSe
Functions Application by including the value of the application identifier in
the Auth-Application-Id AVP within the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id grouped
AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer
commands.
The vendor identifier value of 3GPP (10415) shall be included in the
Supported-Vendor-Id AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-
Exchange-Answer commands, and in the Vendor-Id AVP within the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id grouped AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and
Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands.
The Vendor-Id AVP included in Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-
Exchange-Answer commands that is not included in the Vendor-Specific-
Application-Id AVPs as described above shall indicate the manufacturer of the
Diameter node as per IETF RFC 6733 [29].
### 6.1.8 Diameter Application Identifier
The Diameter Inter ProSe Functions Application protocol shall be defined as an
IETF vendor specific Diameter application, where the vendor is 3GPP. The
vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP
(http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is 10415.
The Diameter application identifier assigned to the Diameter Inter ProSe
Functions application is 16777340 (allocated by IANA). The same Diameter
application identifier is used over the PC6 interface and the PC7 interface.
### 6.1.9 Use of the Supported-Features AVP
When new functionality is introduced on the PC6/PC7 interfaces, it should be
defined as optional. If backwards incompatible changes cannot be avoided, the
new functionality shall be introduced as a new feature and support advertised
with the Supported-Features AVP. The usage of the Supported-Features AVP on
the PC6/PC7 interfaces is consistent with the procedures for the dynamic
discovery of supported features as defined in clause 7.2 of 3GPP TS 29.229
[10].
When extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature, the new AVPs
shall have the M bit cleared and the AVP shall not be defined mandatory in the
command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [10], the Supported-Features AVP is of type
grouped and contains the Vendor-Id, Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On
the all reference points as specified in this specification, the Supported-
Features AVP is used to identify features that have been defined by 3GPP and
hence, for features defined in this document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain
the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415). If there are multiple feature lists defined for
the reference point, the Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists
from one another.
## 6.2 Commands
### 6.2.1 Introduction
This clause defines the Command code values and related ABNF for each command
described in this specification.
### 6.2.2 Command-Code values
This csublause defines Command-Code values for the Diameter Inter ProSe
Functions application used over the PC6/PC7 interfaces as allocated by IANA.
Every command is defined by means of the ABNF syntax IETF RFC 5234 [11],
according to the Command Code Format (CCF) specification defined in IETF RFC
6733 [29]. In the case, the definition and use of an AVP is not specified in
this document, the guidelines in IETF RFC 6733 [29] shall apply.
The Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP shall not be included in any command
sent by Diameter nodes supporting applications defined in this specification.
If the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP is received in any of the commands
defined in this specification, it shall be ignored by the receiving node.
NOTE: The Vendor-Specific-Application-Id is included as an optional AVP in all
Command Code Format specifications defined in this specification in order to
overcome potential interoperability issues with intermediate Diameter agents
non-compliant with IETF RFC 6733 [29].
The following Command Codes are defined in this specification:

## 6.3 Information Elements
### 6.3.1 General
The following table (table 6.3.1-1) specifies the Diameter AVPs defined for
the PC6/PC7 interfaces, their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values and
whether or not the AVP may be encrypted. The Vendor-ID header of all AVPs
defined in this specification shall be set to 3GPP (10415).
For all AVPs which contain bit masks and are of the type Unsigned32 e.g., PRR-
Flags, bit 0 shall be the least significant bit. For example, to get the value
of bit 0, a bit mask of 0x0001 shall be used.

###### ## Annex A (normative): Diameter overload control mechanism
## A.1 General
Diameter overload control mechanism is an optional feature.
IETF RFC 7683 [21] specifies a Diameter overload control mechanism which
includes the definition and the transfer of related AVPs between Diameter
nodes.
It is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 7683 [21] on the PC6/PC7 interface
where, when applied, the requesting ProSe Function shall behave as a reacting
node and the responding ProSe Function as a reporting node.
## A.2 Responding ProSe Function behaviour
The responding ProSe Function requests traffic reduction from requesting ProSe
Function when it is in an overload situation, including OC-OLR AVP in answer
commands as described in IETF RFC 7683 [21].
The ProSe Function identifies that it is in an overload situation by
implementation specific means. For example, the ProSe Function may take into
account the traffic over the PC6/PC7 interfaces or other interfaces, the level
of usage of internal resources (CPU, memory), the access to external
resources, etc.
The ProSe Function determines the specific contents of OC-OLR AVP in overload
reports and the ProSe Function decides when to send OC-OLR AVPs by
implementation specific means.
## A.3 Requesting ProSe Function behaviour
The requesting ProSe Function applies required traffic reduction received in
answer commands to subsequent applicable requests, as per IETF RFC 7683 [21].
Requested traffic reduction is achieved by the requesting ProSe Function by
implementation specific means. For example, it may implement message
throttling with prioritization or a message retaining mechanism for operations
that can be postponed.
As a result of the need to throttle traffic, the requesting ProSe Function may
reject Registration Request, Discovery Request, Match Report Requests
initiated by UEs. The possible related error messages used over PC3 are
described in the 3GPP TS 24.334 [22].
###### ## Annex B (Informative): Diameter overload node behaviour
## B.1 Message prioritization
This clause describes possible behaviours of the requesting ProSe Function
receiving an overload indication from the responding ProSe Function, regarding
message prioritisation in an informative purpose.
The requesting ProSe Function may take the following into account when making
throttling decisions:
\- Identification of the procedures that can be deferred (e.g. Proximity
Requests), so to avoid to drop non deferrable procedures;
\- Prioritisation of certain types of request (e.g. between ProSe-Proximity-
Request (PRR) and ProSe-Location-Update-Request (PLR)) according to the
context of their use, in particular:
\- Higher prioritisation for commands that are related to a registered user
for a service, so to avoid the interruption of the registered service for the
user.
###### ## Annex C (normative):**** Diameter message priority mechanism
## C.1 General
IETF RFC 7944 [27] specifies a Diameter routing message priority mechanism
that allows Diameter nodes to indicate the relative priority of Diameter
messages. With this information, other Diameter nodes may leverage the
relative priority of Diameter messages into routing, resource allocation, set
the DSCP marking for transport of the associated Diameter message, and also
abatement decisions when overload control is applied.
## C.2 PC6/PC7 interfaces
### C.2.1 General
The Diameter message priority mechanism is an optional feature.
It is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 7944 [27] over the PC6/PC7
interfaces of an operator network when the overload control defined in Annex A
is applied on these PC6/7 interfaces.
### C.2.2 ProSe Function behaviour
When the ProSe Function supports the Diameter message priority mechanism over
the PC6 or the PC7 interface, the ProSe Function shall comply with IETF RFC
7944 [27].
The ProSe Function sending a request shall determine the required priority
according to its policies. When priority is required, the ProSe Function shall
include the DRMP AVP indicating the required priority level in the requests it
sends, and shall prioritise the request according to the required priority
level.
When the ProSe Function receives the corresponding response, it shall
prioritise the received response according to the priority level received
within the DRMP AVP if present in the response, otherwise according to the
priority level of the corresponding request.
When the ProSe Function receives a request, it shall handle the request
according to the received DRMP AVP priority level. For the response, the ProSe
Function may modify the priority level received in the DRMP AVP according to
its policies and shall handle the response according to the required priority
level. If the required priority level is different from the priority level
received in the request, it shall include the DRMP AVP in the response.
If:
\- the ProSe Function supports using the Diameter message priority mechanism
for DSCP marking purposes,
\- the transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and
\- message-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack
transporting Diameter,
then the ProSe Function shall set the DSCP marking for transport of the
request or response according to the required priority level.
The ProSe Function decisions for a required priority and for the priority
level value are implementation specific.
Diameter requests related to high priority traffic shall contain a DRMP AVP
with a high priority of which the level value is operator dependent.
###### ## Annex D (normative): Diameter load control mechanism
## D.1 General
Diameter load control mechanism is an optional feature.
IETF RFC 8583 [28] specifies a Diameter load control mechanism which includes
the definition and the transfer of related AVPs between Diameter nodes.
It is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 8583 [28] on the PC6/PC7 interface
where, when applied, the requesting ProSe Function shall behave as a reacting
node and the responding ProSe Function as a reporting node.
## D.2 Responding ProSe Function behaviour
The responding ProSe Function may report its current load by including a Load
AVP of type HOST in answer commands as described in IETF RFC 8583 [28].
The responding ProSe Function calculates its current load by implementation
specific means. For example, the responding ProSe Function may take into
account the traffic over the PC6/PC7 interface or other interfaces, the level
of usage of internal resources (e.g. CPU, memory), the access to external
resources, etc.
The responding ProSe Function determines when to send Load AVPs of type HOST
by implementation specific means.
## D.3 Requesting ProSe Function behaviour
When performing next hop Diameter Agent selection for requests that are routed
based on realm, the requesting ProSe Function may take into account load
values from Load AVPs of type PEER received from candidate next hop Diameter
nodes, as per IETF RFC 8583 [28].
