# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply:
**DRA binding:** The PCRF routing information stored per UE or per PDN in the
DRA, which include the user identity (UE NAI), the UE Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6
prefix, the APN (if available) and the selected PCRF identity for a certain
IP-CAN Session.
**Gateway Control Session:** An association between a BBERF and a PCRF (when
GTP is not used in the EPC), used for transferring access specific parameters,
BBERF events and QoS rules between the PCRF and BBERF. In the context of this
specification this is implemented by use of the Gxx procedures.
**IP-CAN session:** association between a UE and an IP network.\ The
association is identified by one or more UE Ipv4 addresses/ and/or Ipv6 prefix
together with a UE identity information, if available, and a PDN represented
by a PDN ID (e.g. an APN). An IP-CAN session incorporates one or more IP-CAN
bearers. Support for multiple IP-CAN bearers per IP-CAN session is IP-CAN
specific. An IP-CAN session exists as long as the related UE Ipv4 address
and/or Ipv6 prefix are assigned and announced to the IP network.
**Policy counter:** A mechanism within the OCS to track spending applicable
for a subscriber.
**Policy counter status:** A label whose values are not standardized and that
is associated with a policy counter's value relative to the spending limit(s)
(the number of possible policy counter status values for a policy counter is
one greater than the number of thresholds associated with that policy counter,
i.e policy counter status values describe the status around the thresholds).
This is used to convey information relating to subscriber spending from OCS to
PCRF. Specific labels are configured jointly in OCS and PCRF.
**RAN user plane congestion:** RAN user plane congestion occurs when the
demand for RAN resources exceeds the available RAN capacity to deliver the
user data for a prolonged period of time.
NOTE: Short-duration traffic bursts is a normal condition at any traffic load
level, and is not considered to be RAN user plane congestion. Likewise, a
high-level of utilization of RAN resources (based on operator configuration)
is considered a normal mode of operation and might not be RAN user plane
congestion.
**Spending limit:** A spending limit is the usage limit of a policy counter
(e.g. monetary, volume, duration) that a subscriber is allowed to consume.
**Spending limit report:** a notification, containing the current policy
counter status generated from the OCS to the PCRF via the Sy reference point.
**TDF session:** An association between an IP-CAN session and the assigned TDF
for the purpose of application detection and control by the PCRF . The
association is identified by one UE Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix together
with optionally a PDN represented by a PDN ID and a set of ADC rules to be
applied by the TDF.

# 4 Signalling Flows over Gx, Gxx, Rx, Sd, Sy, Np, Nt, St and S9
## 4.0 General
There are three distinct network scenarios for an IP-CAN Session:
Case 1. No Gateway Control Session is required, no Gateway Control
Establishment occurs at all (e.g. 3GPP Access where GTP-based S5/S8 are
employed, and Non-3GPP access where GTP-based S2a or GTP-based S2b is
employed).
Case 2. A Gateway Control Session is required. There are two subcases:
> 2a) The BBERF assigns a Care of Address (CoA) to the UE and establishes a
> Gateway Control Session prior to any IP-CAN session establishment that will
> apply for all IP-CAN sessions using that CoA.
>
> 2b) At IP-CAN session establishment a Gateway Control Session is required
> before the PCEF announces the IP-CAN Session to the PCRF. At BBERF change
> and pre-registration the Gateway Control Session shall match an IP-CAN
> session that the PCEF has already announced. Each IP-CAN session is handled
> in a separate Gateway Control Session.
The PCRF shall select whether case 2a or case 2b applies based on the
information received in the Gateway Control Session Establishment. For a user
identified with a Subscription-Id AVP, when the PDN identifier included as
part of the Called-Station-Id AVP is received, case 2b applies. If not
received, case 2a applies.
The following considerations shall be taken into account when interpreting the
signalling flows:
\- V-PCRF is included to also cover the roaming scenarios.
\- H-PCRF will act as a PCRF for non-roaming Ues.
\- The steps numbered as "number+letter" (e.g. "3a") will be executed, for the
roaming case, instead of steps numbered as "number" (e.g. "3"), as indicated
in the explanatory text below the signalling flows.
\- Emergency services are handled locally in the serving network, therefore
the S9 reference point does not apply.
NOTE: For the Visited Access case, the operator can by roaming agreement
decide not to use S9 reference point.
The procedure to detect that the Gx session or a Gateway Control Session is
restricted to Emergency Services is described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].
\- Subscription-related information is not relevant for the policy control of
Emergency Sessions; therefore Sp reference point does not apply in that case.
\- With the UDC-based architecture as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [2] and 3GPP
TS 23.335 [51], SPR, whenever mentioned in the present specification, refers
to UDR. The Ud interface as defined in 3GPP TS 29.335 [52] is the interface
between the PCRF and the UDR.
\- When monitoring event reporting via PCRF applies as defined in 3GPP TS
23.682 [38], the SCEF is acting as an AF. In this case, only the flows where
the AF is located in the home network apply. Support of this functionality is
detailed in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], Annex D.
\- If the PCEF/BBERF/TDF needs to send an IP-CAN session/ Gateway Control
Session/ TDF session modification request towards a PCRF which is known to
have restarted since the IP-CAN session/ Gateway Control Session/ TDF session
establishment, the PCEF/BBERF/TDF shall follow the PCRF Failure and
Restoration procedure as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].
NOTE: Only the interaction with OCS for spending limits reporting over Sy
interface is introduced in this document.
\- The PCEF and TDF are depicted as monolithic entities in the signalling
flows, but each of those can be decomposed into a User Plane Function and a
Control Plane Function connected via the Sx reference point. Signalling on the
Sx reference point is not shown.
## 4.1 IP-CAN Session Establishment
This clause is applicable if a new IP-CAN Session is being established.
Figure 4.1.1: IP-CAN Session Establishment
1\. The BBERF may initiate a Gateway Control Session Establishment procedure
as defined in 4.4.1 (applicable for cases 2a during initial attach and 2b, as
defined in clause 4.0), if appropriate. In this step, the PCRF determines
whether the cases 2a or 2b applies, as defined in clause 4.0.
2\. The PCEF receives an Establish IP-CAN Session Request. The form of the
Establish IP-CAN Session Request depends upon the type of the IP-CAN.
3\. For the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a
Home Routed scenario, the PCEF informs the H-PCRF of the IP-CAN Session
establishment. The PCEF starts a new Gx session by sending a CCR to the H-PCRF
using the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value INITIAL_REQUEST. The PCEF
provides UE identity information, PDN identifier, the UE Ipv4 address and/or
UE Ipv6 prefix and, if available, the PDN connection identifier, IP-CAN type,
RAT type and/or the default charging method and additional charging parameters
as defined in clause 4.5.1 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9] and may send charging
characteristics if available. The PCEF provides, when available, the Default-
EPS-Bearer-QoS and the APN-AMBR to the PCRF. The PCEF may provide the
applicable TDF routing information in TDF-Information AVP. If the UE has
declared support for the extended TFT filter format and the PCEF does not
prevent the use thereof, the PCE F shall indicate that the support for
extended TFT filters is available in the IP-CAN session. For types of IP-CAN,
where the H-PCRF can be in control of IP-CAN Bearers, e.g. GPRS, the PCEF also
provides a new bearer identifier and information about the requested bearer,
such as QoS. If applicable for the IP-CAN type, it will also provide
information to indicate whether NW-initiated bearer control procedures are
supported, if available. The PCRF links the Gx session for the new IP-CAN
session with the corresponding Gateway Control Session as defined in clause
4.0. The PCRF maintains aligned set of PCC and QoS rules in the PCEF and
BBERF(s) as applicable for the case. For case 2a and if IP flow mobility is
supported, the PCEF provides, when available, the IP flow mobility routing
rules. For case 1 and if NBIFOM is supported, the PCEF provides, when
available, the NBIFOM support and NBIFOM mode information. If available, the
PCEF provides a timestamp corresponding to the time at which the request was
initiated by the originating node, and additionally the PCEF can include the
maximum wait time as defined in subclause 4.5.1 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].
For the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 3a\~3c
are executed instead of step 3.
3a. The PCEF informs the V-PCRF of the establishment of the IP-CAN session.
The PCEF starts a new Gx session by sending a CCR to the V-PCRF with the CC-
Request-Type AVP set to the value INITIAL_REQUEST. The parameters for CCR as
listed in step 3 are applicable here.
3b. The V-PCRF determines that the request is for a roaming user and concludes
the IP-CAN session uses visited access. V-PCRF stores the received
information.
3c. If there is not an already established S9 session for this roaming user,
the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the
value INITIAL_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes the Subsession-Enforcement-Info AVP
within the CCR with a new S9 subsession identifier assigned by the V-PCRF to
this IP-CAN session within the Subsession-Id AVP, and the Subsession-Operation
AVP set to the value ESTABLISHMENT.
> If there is an already established S9 session for this roaming user, the
> V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the
> value UPDATE_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes the Subsession-Enforcement-Info
> AVP within the CCR with a new S9 subsession identifier assigned by the
> V-PCRF to this IP-CAN session within the Subsession-Id AVP, and the
> Subsession-Operation AVP set to the value ESTABLISHMENT.
4\. The H-PCRF stores the information received in the CCR. For cases 2a and
2b, the H-PCRF links the Gx session with the Gateway Control Session(s).
NOTE 1: In the case 2a, when an additional PDN connection is established, the
Gx session is linked with the already established Gateway Control Session.
5\. If the H-PCRF requires subscription-related information and does not have
it, the H-PCRF sends a request to the SPR in order to receive the information.
6\. The SPR replies with the subscription related information containing the
information about the allowed service(s), QoS information, PCC Rules
information and may include MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority Level and IMS
Signalling Priority for establishing a PS session with priority.
NOTE 2: For steps 5 and 6: The details associated with the Sp reference point
are not specified in this Release. The SPR's relation to existing subscriber
databases is not specified in this Release.
7\. If the PCRF determines that the policy decision depends on the status of
the policy counters available at the OCS and no Sy session yet has been
established for this subscriber, the PCRF sends an Initial Spending Limit
Report Request as defined in clause 4.7.1. If the Sy sesson is already
established for this subscriber, the PCRF may send, if required, an
Intermediate Spending Limit Report Request as defined in clause 4.7.2.
8\. The H-PCRF selects or generates PCC Rule(s) to be installed. The H- PCRF
may also make a policy decision by deriving an authorized QoS and by deciding
whether service flows described in the PCC Rules are to be enabled or
disabled. If MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority Level, and IMS Signalling Priority
are present for the user, the PCRF takes the information into account. If
NBIFOM is supported, the PCRF determines whether the NBIFOM applies to the IP-
CAN session and selects the NBIFOM mode.
9\. The H-PCRF stores the selected PCC Rules. The H-PCRF selects the Bearer
Control Mode that will apply during the IP-CAN session if applicable for the
particular IP-CAN. If the H-PCRF controls the binding of IP-CAN Bearers, the
H-PCRF stores information about the IP-CAN Bearer to which the PCC Rules have
been assigned. If the BBERF/PCEF controls the binding of IP-CAN bearers, the
H-PCRF may derive the QoS information per QCI applicable to that IP-CAN
session for non-GBR bearers.
10\. When user profile configuration indicates that Application Detection and
Control function is enabled, the H-PCRF makes the policy decision for the
application detection and control. For the non-roaming case, or for the case
when the UE is roaming in a Home Routed scenario, the H-PCRF selects the
applicable PCC Rules to be provided for application detection and control for
the PCEF supporting ADC feature, or the applicable ADC rules for the solicited
application reporting with a TDF. For the case when the UE is roaming in a
Visited Access scenario, the H-PCRF selects the applicable PCC Rules to be
provided for application detection and control. For solicited application
reporting with a TDF, the H-PCRF finds the TDF by using the TDF-Information
AVP received from the PCEF in step 3, or, if not received, using a pre-
configured TDF address.
11\. Only applicable for non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is
roaming in a home routed case, In case of solicited application reporting with
a TDF, the PCRF initiates a TDF Session Establishment procedure, according to
clause 4.6.1, with the selected TDF.
12\. If traffic steering control over St applies andthe H-PCRF determines that
traffic steering control information is needed for the IP-CAN session, the
PCRF initiates an St session establishment procedure according to subclause
4.9.1 with the TSSF. The TSSF identifier is pre-configured on the PCRF per
e.g. PCEF.
13\. For the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a
Home Routed scenario, the H-PCRF provisions the PCC Rules to the PCEF using
CCA. The H-PCRF also provides the selected Bearer Control Mode if applicable
for the particular IP-CAN and if available, the QoS information per QCI. If
the PCEF has indicated that the support for extended TFT filters is available
in the IP-CAN session, then the PCRF may, by indicating the PCRF support for
extended TFT filters, enable the use of the extended TFT filter format in the
IP-CAN session. The PCRF may also provide event triggers listing events for
which the PCRF desires PCC Rule Requests. Furthermore, the PCRF may provide
authorized QoS including the APN-AMBR and the Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS, User
Location Information, user CSG information (if received from the BBERF) and
Presence Reporting Area Information. If usage monitoring is enabled, the
H-PCRF may provide the applicable thresholds for usage monitoring control at
PCEF within the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP. If NBIFOM is supported, the
H-CRF provides the decision on whether the NBIFOM is supported and the
selected NBIFOM mode if applicable.
For types of IP-CAN, where the PCRF controls IP-CAN Bearers, e.g. GPRS, the
PCRF indicates the IP-CAN Bearer where the PCC Rules are to be installed and
that the authorized QoS refers to. Otherwise, the PCRF operates without any
further reference to any specific bearer.
If the PCEF supports Application Detection and Control feature, the PCRF
provisions the applicable PCC Rules to the PCEF for the corresponding IP-CAN
session.
If online charging is applicable then the PCEF requests credit information
from the OCS over the Gy interface. If the PCEF receives credit re-
authorisation triggers from the OCS then, for case 2b, it requests the PCRF
via a CCR message to provision the triggers at the BBERF. The triggers to be
provisioned are specified in the Event-Report-Indication AVP in the CCR
message.
> For the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 13a
> -13g are executed.
13a. The PCC Rules, if they were selected in step 9, are provisioned by the
H-PCRF to the V-PCRF by using a CCA. The H-PCRF includes PCC Rules in the
Subsession-Decision-Info AVP of the CCA, along with the S9 subsession
identifier as received in step 3c within the Subsession-Id AVP. Other
parameters listed in step 9 are also applicable here.
13b. The V-PCRF enforces visited operator policies regarding QoS authorization
requested by the H-PCRF as indicated by the roaming agreements.
13c. In case of TDF, if Application Detection and Control function is enabled
for the IP-CAN session, the V-PCRF extracts ADC rules from the received PCC
rules from the H-PCRF and stores the ADC rules.
13d. The V-PCRF informs the H-PCRF when a request has been denied and may
provide the acceptable QoS Information for the service.
13e. The H-PCRF acknowledges the CCR and may additionally include new or
modified PCC rules to the V-PCRF. When user profile configuration indicates
that Application Detection and Control function is enabled, some of those PCC
Rules may be dedicated for application detection and control.
13f. In case of solicited application reporting with a TDF, the V-PCRF
initiates a TDF Session Establishment procedure, according to clause 4.6.1,
with the selected TDF and provides ADC Rules extracted from the corresponding
PCC Rules.
13g. The V-PCRF provisions PCC rules received from the H-PCRF to the PCEF by
using CCA. The parameters listed in step 11a are applicable here, User
Location Information and user CSG information (if received from the BBERF).
NOTE 3: From this point and onward, the PCRF is responsible for keeping the
active PCC, ADC and QoS rules aligned.
14\. If case 2a or 2b applies, the PCRF aligns the set of QoS rules at the
BBERF with the set of active rules at the PCEF.
15\. The PCEF installs the received PCC Rules. The PCEF also enforces the
authorized QoS and enables or disables service flows according to the flow
status of the corresponding PCC Rules. If QoS information is received per QCI,
PCEF sets the upper limit accordingly for the MBR that the PCEF assigns to the
non-GBR bearer(s) for that QCI. In case of PCEF supporting Application
Detection and Control feature, the PCEF enforces the application detection and
control.
16\. The PCEF sends a response to the Establish IP-CAN Session Request.\ For
GPRS, the GGSN accepts the PDP Context Request based on the results of the
authorisation policy decision enforcement. If the requested QoS parameters do
not correspond to the authorized QoS, the GGSN adjusts (downgrades /upgrades)
the requested UMTS QoS parameters to the authorized values.
NOTE 4: The PCRF can reject the IP-CAN session establishment, e.g. the PCRF
cannot obtain the subscription-related information from the SPR and the PCRF
cannot make the PCC rule decisions, as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].
> PCEF can also enforce active preconfigured PCC rules which are not know to
> the PCRF.
The PCEF can also reject the IP-CAN session establishment, e.g. there is no
active PCC rule for the IP-CAN session as specified in 3GPP TS 23.203 [2].
## 4.2 IP-CAN Session Termination
### 4.2.1 UE-Initiated
#### 4.2.1.1 AF located in the HPLMN
This clause is applicable if an IP-CAN Session is being released by the UE and
the AF is located in the HPLMN.
Figure 4.2.1.1.1: UE-Initiated IP-CAN Session Termination -- AF located in the
HPLMN
In the following procedures, the V-PCRF is included to depict the roaming
scenarios. H-PCRF acts as the PCRF for non-roaming UEs.
1\. If case 2b applies (as defined in clause 4.0), the BBERF receives a
request to remove the IP-CAN session. In case 2a, the request goes
transparently through the BBERF. In all cases, the PCEF receives a request to
remove the IP-CAN Session. The form of the Remove IP-CAN Session Request
depends upon the type of the IP-CAN.
2\. If case 2b applies (as defined in clause 4.0), the BBERF-initiated Gateway
Control Session Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.4.4 (BBERF-
Initiated Gateway Control Session Termination) is initiated.
3\. For the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a
Home Routed scenario, the PCEF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF, indicating the IP-
CAN Session termination. The PCEF requests the termination of the Gx session
using the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value TERMINATION_REQUEST. If the
usage monitoring is enabled, the PCEF informs the H-PCRF about the resources
that have been consumed by the user since the last report. If the Required-
Access-Info AVP is included in any PCC Rule, the PCEF informs the H-PCRF about
the access network information. If NAS-RAN-Cause feature is supported the PCEF
informs the H-PCRF about the access network information and the failure
cause(s), if available.
For the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 3a\~3b
are executed instead of step 3:
3a. The PCEF sends a CCR to the V-PCRF, indicating the IP-CAN Session
termination. The PCEF requests the termination of the Gx session using the CC-
Request-Type AVP set to the value TERMINATION_REQUEST. If the usage monitoring
is enabled, the PCEF informs the V-PCRF about the resources that have been
consumed by the user since the last report. If the Required-Access-Info AVP is
included in any PCC Rule, the PCEF informs the V-PCRF about access network
information.
3b If there is an active TDF session between the TDF and the V-PCRF, for
roaming UE with visited access, the TDF Session termination is initiated as
defined in Section 4.6.2. For this case, the PCRF described in Section 4.6.2
acts as a V-PCRF.
3c. If congestion reporting is active for the user id and PDN id, for roaming
UE with visited access, the V-PCRF initiates a UE context removal as defined
in clause 4.8.5.
3d. The V-PCRF sends the CCR to the H-PCRF. If case 2b or case 1 applies and
this is the last subsession associated with the S9 session, the V-PCRF sends a
CCR to the H-PCRF to request the termination of the S9 session using the CC-
Request-Type AVP set to the value TERMINATION_REQUEST. Otherwise, the V-PCRF
sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
UPDATE_REQUEST and a Subsession-Enforcement-Info within which the Subsession-
Operation AVP set to value TERMINATION to request the termination of the
conresponding S9 subsession.
NOTE 1: If the usage monitoring is enabled on PCEF and/or TDF, the V-PCRF
gathers the reports and provides them all to H-PCRF in the single CCR message.
4\. The H-PCRF identifies the AF sessions that are bound to IP flows of the
removed IP-CAN Session.
5\. For the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a
Home Routed scenario, the H-PCRF acknowledges the Gx session termination by
sending a CCA to the PCEF.
For the case when the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 5a\~5c
are executed instead of step 5:
5a. The H-PCRF acknowledges the S9 session or subsession termination by
sending a CCA to the V-PCRF.
5b. The V-PCRF removes the information related to the terminated IP-CAN
Session.
5c. The V-PCRF acknowledges the Gx session termination by sending a CCA to the
PCEF.
6\. The PCEF sends a response to the Remove IP-CAN Session Request. The form
of the Remove IP-CAN Session Response depends upon the type of the IP-CAN.
Step 6 may be executed in parallel with step 3 or 3a (as applicable).
7\. If there is an activeTDF session between the TDF and the H-PCRF, for non-
roaming UE/roaming UE with home routed access, the TDF Session termination is
initiated as defined in Section 4.6.2.
NOTE 2: Step 7 can occur anytime after step 3.
For each AF session identified in step 4 as bound to the IP-CAN Session being
removed, steps 7-11 are executed:
8\. If congestion reporting is active for the user id and PDN id, for non-
roaming UE or UE is roaming in home routed case, the H-PCRF initiates a UE
context removal as defined in clause 4.8.5.
NOTE 3: Step 8 can occur anytime after step 3.
9\. The H-PCRF indicates the session abort to the H-AF by sending an ASR to
the H-AF.
10\. The H-AF responds by sending an ASA to the H-PCRF.
11\. The H-AF sends an STR to the H-PCRF to indicate that the session has been
terminated.
12\. The H-PCRF responds by sending an STA to the H-AF. If the provided PCC
rules are related to an AF session associated with a sponsor, usage thresholds
were provided by the H-AF earlier, and the H-PCRF has usage data that has not
yet been reported to the H-AF, the H-PCRF informs the H-AF about the resources
that have been consumed by the user since the last report. If the BBERF in
step 2 or PCEF in step 3 reports the access network information and if the AF
requested the H-PCRF to report access network information previously and/or
the RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported, the H-PCRF informs the H-AF about the
access network information and/or RAN/NAS/TWAN/Untrusted WLAN failure cause(s)
if available.
13\. If this is the last IP-CAN session for this subscriber the Final Spending
Limit Report Request as defined in clause 4.7.3 is sent. If any existing IP-
CAN sessions for this subscriber require policy counter status reporting, the
Intermediate Spending Limit Report Request as defined in clause 4.7.2 can be
sent to alter the list of subscribed policy counters.
14\. If case 2a applies (as defined in clause 4.0), the Gateway Control and
QoS Rules Provision procedure as defined in clause 4.4.3 (Gateway Control and
QoS Rules Provision) may be initiated to remove the QoS rules associated with
the IPâ€‘CAN session being terminated. This applies e.g. in case the Gateway
Control Session remains to serve other IPâ€‘CAN sessions.
Alternatively, if UE acquires a care of address (CoA) that is used for the S2c
reference point and the H-PCRF determines that all QoS rules are to be removed
and the Gateway Control Session to be terminated, the PCRF-initiated Gateway
Control Session Termination procedure as defined in clause 4.4.4 (PCRF-
Initiated Gateway Control Session Termination) is initiated. This applies e.g.
in case the UE is detached and the CoA acquired by the UE is not used for any
other IPâ€‘CAN session.
15\. The H-PCRF sends a cancellation notification request to the SPR if it has
subscribed such notification. The H-PCRF stores the remaining usage allowance
in the SPR if all IP-CAN sessions of the user to the same APN are terminated.
Step 14 may be initiated any time after step 5 or 5a (as applicable).
16\. The SPR sends a response to the H-PCRF.
NOTE 4: For steps 14 and 15: The details associated with the Sp reference
point are not specified in this Release. The SPR's relation to existing
subscriber databases is not specified in this Release.
17\. If the H-PCRF has provided traffic steering control information to the
TSSF for the IP-CAN session, the H-PCRF initiates the St session termination
procedure to the TSSF to remove the traffic steering control information
associated to the UE IPv4 address and/or to the UE IPv6 prefix for the
terminated IP-CAN session according to the subclause 4.9.3.
NOTE 5: Step 17 can be initiated any time after step 5.
#### 4.2.1.2 AF located in the VPLMN
This clause is applicable only for the Visited Access scenario for the case
when an IP-CAN Session is being released by the UE and the AF is located in
the VPLMN.

## 4.3 IP-CAN Session Modification
### 4.3.1 Network-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
#### 4.3.1.1 Interactions between BBERF, PCEF, TDF, OCS, TSSF and
PCRF(PCC/QoS/ADC Rule Provisioning in PUSH mode)
This flow shows the provisioning of PCC/QoS/ADC Rules and/or authorized QoS
triggered by an event in the PCRF.
Figure 4.3.1.1.1: Interactions between BBERF, PCEF, TDF, OCS, TSSF and PCRF
for PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
1\. The H-PCRF receives an internal or external trigger to re-evaluate PCC
Rules and policy decision for an IP-CAN Session. Possible external trigger
events are described in clause 4.3.1.2. In addition, this procedure is
triggered by
\- PCEF subscribed event
\- SPR subscription data modification (e.g. change in MPS EPS Priority, MPS
Priority Level and/or IMS Signalling Priority, or change in user profile
configuration indicating whether supporting application detection and
control).
\- OCS status of a policy counter identifier(s) has changed and the PCRF
requested notification for spending limits apply.
\- Application detection information report from TDF.
2\. The H-PCRF selects the PCC Rule(s) to be installed, modified or removed
for the IP-CAN Session. In case of PCEF supporting Application Detection and
Control feature, some of those PCC rules may be used for application detection
and control. The H-PCRF may also update the policy decision by defining an
authorized QoS and enable or disable the service flow(s) of PCC Rules. If the
PCEF controls the binding of IP-CAN bearers, the H-PCRF may add or change QoS
information per QCI applicable to that IP-CAN session. In case of TDF, the
H-PCRF selects the applicable ADC rules for the solicited application
reporting with a TDF. If NBIFOM applies to the IP-CAN session and Network-
initiated mode is selected, the H-PCRF determines the access that is to be
used for the transfer of traffic and include the allowed access type in the
PCC rules. If NBIFOM applies to the IP-CAN session, the H-PCRF determines one
access is to be removed from multi access IP-CAN session.
3\. The H-PCRF stores the updated PCC Rules, and ADC rules if available.
4\. Step 4 is only applicable if the Bearer Control Mode (BCM) selected is UE-
only or, for UE/NW the H-PCRF determines that UE mode applies for the affected
PCC Rules, and the PCRF receives an external trigger from the AF.\ The PCRF
may start a timer to wait for a UE requested bearer resource initiation,
modification or removal procedure initiated by the UE, as depicted in figure
4.3.2.1.1.
If a UE requested bearer resource initiation, modification or termination
procedure initiated by the terminal is received for the affected PCC rules
while the timer is running, all subsequent steps in the present figure shall
not be executed and, for case 1, the steps in figure 4.3.2.1.1 (on
provisioning based on PULL procedure at PCEF \--initiated IP-CAN session
modification when the AF is located in the HPLMN), 4.3.2.2.1 (on provisioning
based on PULL procedure at PCEF-initiated IP-CAN session modification when the
AF is located in the VPLMN) and for cases 2a and 2b, the steps in figure
4.4.2.1.1 (Home Routed case) or 4.4.2.2.1 (Visited Access case) shall be
executed instead.
Otherwise, if the BCM selected is UE/NW, the PCRF shall proceed with the
subsequent steps (provisioning based on PUSH procedure) in the present figure
after timer expiry.
NOTE 1: For IMS Emergency session step 4 is not applicable.
5\. For case 2a and 2b, if Gxx applies for the IP-CAN session and the user is
not roaming, or the user is roaming in a Home Routed scenario or a Visited
Access scenario for case 2a when the available QoS rule are not related to any
IP-CAN session, the H-PCRF may initiate Gateway Control and QoS rules
provisioning procedures described in clause 4.4.3.
NOTE 2: This step is not executed if this procedure is triggered by PCEF
subscribed events and/or credit re-authorisation triggers reported by the
BBERF.
6\. The H-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to request that the PCEF installs,
modifies or removes PCC Rules and updates the policy decision, or to report
PCEF subscribed events reported by the BBERF. The report includes the User
Location Information and the User CSG Information (If received from the
BBERF). If the provided PCC rules are related to an AF session associated with
a sponsor that has requested sponsoring the service, the H-PCRF includes, in
the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP, the Sponsor-Identity AVP and the
Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP that it received from the AF if the
Reporting-Level AVP is set to the value SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL and, if
AF provided the application usage thresholds, the Usage-Monitoring-Information
AVP. If the AF requests the access network information, the H-PCRF includes
Required-Access-Info AVP in the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP and/or Charging-
Rule-Remove AVP. In addition, the H-PCRF includes the Event-Trigger set to the
value \"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" if not provided yet. If the Sharing-Key-
UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP are provided within the Media-Component-
Description AVP, the PCRF may apply the mechanisms for resource sharing as
specified at 3GPP TS 29.212 [9]. The PCRF includes the Removal-Of-Access AVP
set to the value REMOVAL_OF_ACCESS (0) and the IP-CAN-Type AVP set to the
value of removed access to remove one access from the multi access IP-CAN
session. If the H-PCRF subscribes the change of UE presence in Presence
Reporting Area, the H-PCRF may provide the Presence Reporting Area Information
to the PCEF.
When the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 6a \~ 6e are
executed instead of step 6:
6a. The H-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to the V-PCRF to request that the PCEF
installs, modifies or removes PCC Rules and updates the policy decision. In
the case of VPLMN supporting Application Detection and Control feature for
solicited application reporting, some of those PCC Rules may be used for
application detection and control. If the provided PCC rules are related to an
AF session associated with a sponsor that has requested sponsoring the
service, the H-PCRF includes, in the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP, the
Sponsor-Identity AVP and the Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP that it
received from the AF if the Reporting-Level AVP is set to the value
SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL and, if AF provided the application usage
thresholds, the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP. If the AF requests the
access network information, the H-PCRF includes Required-Access-Info AVP in
the Charging-Rule-Definition AVP and/or Charging-Rule-Remove AVP. In addition,
the H-PCRF includes the Event-Trigger set to the value
\"ACCESS_NETWORK_INFO_REPORT\" if not provided yet.
6b. The V-PCRF enforces visited operator policies regarding PCC rules
requested by the H-PCRF based on roaming agreements or locally configured
policy. In case of TDF, V-PCRF extracts the ADC rules from the PCC Rules
received from the H-PCRF and stores them.
NOTE 3: If the V-PCRF rejects provisioned PCC rules received from the H-PCRF,
the remaining steps in this call flow are not followed. Instead, the V-PCRF
shall notify the H-PCRF by sending a Diameter RAA, including the Experimental-
Result-Code AVP set to the value PCC_RULE_EVENT, identify the failed PCC rules
as specified in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9], and additionally may provide the
acceptable QoS Information for the service.
6c. In case of TDF, solicited application reporting, for roaming UE with
visited access, the V-PCRF initiates the TDF session establishment,
modification, or termination. If the provided ADC rules are related to an AF
session associated with a sponsor that has requested sponsoring the service,
the H-PCRF includes, in the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP, the Sponsor-Identity AVP
and the Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP that are received from the
AF if the Reporting-Level AVP is set to the value
SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL. Additionally, if the AF provided the application
usage thresholds, the H-PCRF includes the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP. If
the last ADC rule is deactivated, the V-PCRF requests the TDF to terminate the
TDF session toward the V-PCRF as defined in clause 4.6.2. If there is no
active TDF session between the TDF and the V-PCRF, the V-PCRF requests the TDF
to establish the TDF session towards V-PCRF and provides ADC Rules to the TDF
as defined in clause 4.6.1. If there is already an active TDF session between
the TDF and the V-PCRF, the V-PCRF provides the ADC rules to the TDF as
defined in clause 4.6.3.2.
6d. For case 2a and 2b, V-PCRF will derive the QoS rules from the PCC rules.
The V-PCRF will initiate a Gateway Control and QoS Rule procedure as described
in clause 4.4.3 to install, modify or remove QoS rules and optionally
subscribe to new events in the BBERF.
6e. The BBERF installs, modifies or removes the identified QoS Rules. The
BBERF also enforces the authorized QoS of the corresponding QoS Rules.
6f. The V-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to request that the PCEF installs,
modifies or removes PCC Rules.
7\. The PCEF installs, modifies or removes the identified PCC Rules. The PCEF
also enforces the authorized QoS and enables or disables service flow
according to the flow status of the corresponding PCC Rules. If QoS
information is received per QCI, PCEF shall set/update the upper limit for the
MBR that the PCEF assigns to the non-GBR bearer for that QCI. In the case of
PCEF supporting Application Detection and Control feature, the PCEF may also
enforce application detection and control. The PCEF may perform resource
sharing among PCC rules if requested from the PCRF. If allowed access type
information is included in the PCC rules, the PCEF generates the NBIFOM
routing rules based on the PCC rules.
The following applies for emergency sessions only:
When the PCEF receives an IP-CAN Session Modification Request from the PCRF
requesting the removal of the PCC rules of an emergency session, the PCEF
starts an inactivity timer to enable the PSAP to request a callback session
with the UE.
When the timer expires, the PCEF initiates an IP-CAN Session Termination
Request (per clause 4.2.2.1) to terminate the emergency session.
If, before the timer expires, the PCEF receives an IP-CAN Session Modification
Request from the PCRF with PCC rules for an emergency session the PCEF cancels
the timer.
8\. The PCEF sends a Diameter RAA to acknowledge the RAR. The PCEF informs the
H-PCRF about the outcome of the PCC rule operation
When the UE is roaming in a Visited Access scenario, steps 8a \~ 8d are
executed instead of step 8:
8a. The BBERF informs the V-PCRF about the outcome of the operation by sending
a Diameter RAA command.
8b. The PCEF informs the V-PCRF about the outcome of the PCC rule operation by
sending a Diameter RAA command.
8c. The V-PCRF stores the received information.
8d. The V-PCRF informs the H-PCRF about the outcome of the operation by
sending a Diameter RAA command.
9\. In case of TDF, solicited application reporting, for non-roaming
UE/roaming UE with home routed access, H-PCRF initiates the TDF session
establishment, modification, or termination. If the provided ADC rules are
related to an AF session associated with a sponsor that has requested
sponsoring the service, the H-PCRF includes, in the ADC-Rule-Definition AVP,
the Sponsor-Identity AVP and the Application-Service-Provider-Identity AVP
that are received from the AF if the Reporting-Level AVP is set to the value
SPONSORED_CONNECTIVITY_LEVEL. Additionally, if the AF provided the application
usage thresholds, the H-PCRF includes the Usage-Monitoring-Information AVP. If
the last ADC rule is deactivated, the H-PCRF requests the TDF to terminate the
TDF session toward the H-PCRF as defined in clause 4.6.2. If there is no
active TDF session between the TDF and the H-PCRF, the H-PCRF requests the TDF
to establish the TDF session towards H-PCRF and provides ADC Rules to the TDF
as defined in clause 4.6.1. If there is already an active TDF session between
the TDF and the H-PCRF, H-PCRF provides the ADC rules to the TDF as defined in
clause 4.6.3.2.
NOTE 4: Step 9 can occur anytime after step 6.
10\. If traffic steering control over St applies, if the PCRF determines that
the traffic steering control information needs to be provisioned for the IP-
CAN session; the PCRF initiates the St session establishment procedure
according to the subclause 4.9.1. If the PCRF determines that the traffic
steering control information provisioned to the TSSF needs to be updated, the
PCRF initiates the St session modification procedure according to the
subclause 4.9.2. If the PCRF determines that the traffic steering control
information is not needed for the IP-CAN session any more, the PCRF initiates
the St session termination procedure according to the subclause 4.9.3.
11\. In case of spending limits, for non-roaming/roaming UE with both home
routed and visited access, H-PCRFinitiates Initial/ Intermediate/ Final
Spending Limit Report Request. The H-PCRF sends an Initial Spending Limit
Report Request if this is the first time a status notification of policy
counter is requested for the user as defined in clause 4.7.1. If the H-PCRF
decides to modify the list of subscribed policy counters the H-PCRF sends an
Intermediate Spending Limit Report Request as defined in clause 4.7.2. If the
H-PCRF decides to unsubscribe any future status notification of policy
counters, it sends a Final Spending Limit Report Request to cancels the
request for reporting the change of the status of the policy counters
available at the OCS as defined in clause 4.7.3.
NOTE 5: Step 11 can occur anytime after step 2.
> 12\. If usage monitoring is enabled and the H-PCRF either removed the last
> PCC rule applicable for certain monitoring key, or disabled usage monitoring
> or requested usage report, the PCEF shall initiate an IP-CAN session
> modification procedure.
>
> 13\. When Gxx does not apply for the IP-CAN session, IP-CAN bearer
> signalling is executed separately for each IP-CAN bearer under the following
> conditions:
\- If all PCC rules bound to a bearer have been removed or deactivated (bearer
deactivation is applicable)
\- If one or more bearers have to be modified
\- If the PCEF needs to establish a new bearer (bearer establishment is
applicable).
\- If the PCEF needs to request access network information.
> \- if the PCEF needs to send the NBIFOM routing rules to the UE in the
> corresponding access.
>
> 14\. If the AF, in step 1, has requested notifications from the PCRF, e.g.
> in the case of access network information the PCEF initiates an IP-CAN
> session modification procedure to provide the requested information as
> described in clause 4.3.2.
NOTE 6: If the conditions of both step 14 and step 12 apply the PCEF can make
use of only one IP-CAN session modification procedure in step 14.

If the AF session being terminated corresponds to a session that included the
Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP set to PRIORITY_SHARING_ENABLED within the
Media-Component-Description AVP, if the related media flow(s) was in priority
sharing with other media flows, the PCRF should readjust the Allocation and
Retention Priority for the remaining services sharing priority. These PCC/QoS
Rules may need to be modified.
If the AF did not request access network information, and if no usage
thresholds due to an AF session associated with a sponsor were provided that
relate to the installed PCC rules and RAN-NAS-Cause feature is not supported,

### 4.3.2 PCEF --Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification (PCC Rule Provisioning
in PULL Mode)
#### 4.3.2.1 PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification. AF located in HPLMN.
This flow shows the provisioning of PCC Rules and/or authorized QoS triggered
by the PCEF.
Figure 4.3.2.1.1: PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification. AF in HPLMN.
1\. For case 2a and 2b, the BBERF may initiate Gateway Control and QoS rules
request procedure described in subclause 4.4.2.
2\. The PCEF may receive a request for IPâ€‘CAN Session modification. The IP-CAN
session modification can be initiated upon receiving UE-initiated resource
modification request (case 1), a new IP-CAN bearer establishment signalling
(case 1), due to a specific event (e.g. UE requested PDN connectivity in all
cases) or an internal trigger(e.g. if the PCEF supports Application Detection
and Control feature, the start/stop of application traffic event that matches
with one or more activated PCC rules for application detection and control
that do not contain the Mute-Notification AVP has been detected by the PCEF).
3\. The PCEF informs the H-PCRF about the IP-CAN session modification for non-
roaming case and Home Routed roaming scenario. The PCEF sends a CCR command to
the H-PCRF including the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
"UPDATE_REQUEST". For an IP-CAN Session modification where an existing IP-CAN
bearer is modified, the PCEF supplies the specific event that caused the IP-
CAN Session modification within the Event-Trigger AVP and the PCC rule name(s)
and their status within the Charging-Rule-Report AVP. For an IP-CAN Session
modification where an existing IP-CAN bearer is terminated, the PCEF supplies
the affected PCC rule name(s), their status set to inactive, the rule failure
code and, if available, the RAN/NAS/TWAN/Untrusted WLAN cause(s) within the
Charging-Rule-Report AVP. In the case where the UE initiates a resource
modification request procedure, the PCEF includes the Packet-Filter-
Information AVP, Packet-Filter-Operation AVP and QoS-Information AVP, if
applicable. In the case of PCEF supporting Application Detection and Control
feature, when the start or stop of the application's traffic, identified by
TDF-Application-Identifier, is detected, if PCRF has previously subscribed to
the APPLICATION_START/APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers, the PCEF shall report
the information regarding the detected application's traffic in the
Application-Detection-Information AVP in the CCR command. If NBIFOM applies to
the IP-CAN session, if one of the conditions specified in subclause 4.5.25.2
of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9] applies, the PCEF informs the PCRF accordingly making
use of the applicable event trigger, i.e. \"ADDITION_OF_ACCESS\", \"
REMOVAL_OF_ACCESS\", \"UNAVAILIBILITY_OF_ACCESS\", \"AVAILIBILITY_OF_ACCESS\"
or \"ROUTING_RULE_CHANGE\".
When the UE is roaming in a Visited Access case, steps 3a \~ 3c are executed
instead of step 3:
3a. The PCEF sends a Diameter CCR to the V-PCRF to request PCC/ADD Rules for
the roaming user. The parameters listed in step 3 are applicable here.
3b. The V-PCRF stores the information received in the Diameter CCR from the
PCEF.
3c. The V-PCRF sends a CCR command with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to
"UPDATE_REQUEST" to the H-PCRF. The V-PCRF includes the Subsession-
Enforcement-Info AVP and the assigned S9 subsession identifier within
Subsession-Id AVP. The Subsession-Operation AVP is set to the value
"MODIFICATION".
4\. If the H-PCRF requires subscription-related information and does not have
it, the PCRF sends a request to the SPR in order to receive the information.
5\. The SPR replies with the subscription related information containing the
information about the allowed service(s) and PCC Rules information.
NOTE 1: For steps 4 and 5: The details associated with the Sp reference point
are not specified in this Release. The SPR's relation to existing subscriber
databases is not specified in this Release.
6\. If the AF requested a notification of the corresponding event, the H-PCRF
sends a Diameter RAR with the Specific-Action AVP set to indicate the event
that caused the request. If the session modification affected a sponsored data
flow and the H-PCRF detects that the usage threshold provided by the AF has
been reached, this message includes the accumulated usage in the Used-Service-
Unit AVP within the Sponsored-Connectivity-Data AVP and the Specific-Action
AVP set to the value USAGE_REPORT.
7\. If step 6 takes place, the AF may take the application specific procedure
(e.g. for IMS refer to 3GPP TS 23.228 [59], replies with a Diameter RAA and
may provide updated service information within. Additionally, the AF may
terminate the Rx session as per subclause 4.3.1.2.3.
8-11. If all service data flows for an AF session are deleted, the AF session
is terminated. If the session modification affected a sponsored data flow and
the H-PCRF detects the UE is roaming with home routed case, the H-PCRF
initiates the AF session termination.
If the IP-CAN session is associated with a sponsor, usage thresholds were
provided by the AF earlier, and the H-PCRF has usage data that has not yet
been reported to the AF, the H-PCRF informs the AF[,]{.underline} in step 11,
about the resources that have been consumed by the user since the last report.
If RAN-NAS-Cause feature is supported and RAN/NAS/TWAN/Untrusted WLAN cause(s)
and/or access network information were received in step 3, the H-PCRF sends
this information to the AF in step 11.
NOTE 2: Initial/intermediate/Final Spending Limit Report Request can be
triggered at any time after this if PCRF, based on policy decisions, find the
need to initialize, modify, or deactivate spending limit reporting for the
subscriber according to subclause 4.7.1/2/3 respectively.
12\. The H-PCRF selects or generates PCC Rule(s) to be installed. The H-PCRF
may also identify existing PCC rules that need to be modified or removed. In
the case of VPLMN supporting Application Detection and Control feature for
solicited application reporting, some of those PCC Rules may be used for
application detection and control. The PCC Rules may relate to any of the
matching AF sessions or may exist in the PCRF without matching to any AF
session. The H-PCRF may also make a policy decision by deriving an authorized
QoS and by deciding whether service data flows described in the PCC Rules are
to be enabled or disabled. The H-PCRF may also update the ADC decisions and
select the ADC rules to be installed, modified or removed for the IP-CAN
session in the non-roaming case. If the NBIFOM applies to the IP-CAN session,
the PCRF can also make a decision of NBIFOM as defined in subclause 4.5.25.2
of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].
13\. For the non-roaming case, and for the case when the UE is roaming in a
Home Routed scenario, the H-PCRF provisions the PCC Rules to the PCEF using
CCA command. The H-PCRF also provides the selected Bearer Control Mode, if
changed and applicable for the IP-CAN type. The PCRF may also provide a new
list of event triggers for which the PCRF requires to be notified. The PCRF
may provide QoS information within the APN-AMBR AVP and the Default-EPS-
Bearer-QoS AVP. In the case of PCEF supporting Application Detection and
Control feature, the H-PCRF may provision the PCC rules for application
detection and control to the PCEF.
When the UE is roaming in a Visited Access, steps 13a \~13c are executed
instead of step 13:
13a. The H-PCRF sends a Diameter CCA to the V-PCRF including the PCC Rules to
be provisioned within the Subsession-Decision AVP, along with the S9
subsession identifier as received in step 3b within the Subsession-Id AVP.
Other parameters listed in step 9 are also applicable here.
13b. The V-PCRF validates the QoS parameters requested within the PCC Rules
and enforces visited operator policies regarding QoS authorization requested
by the H-PCRF as indicated by the roaming agreements. In case of TDF, the
V-PCRF extracts and validates the ADC rules from the PCC rules received from
the H-PCRF according to the local policy and roaming agreements if provided by
the H-PCRF.
NOTE: If the V-PCRF rejects provisioned PCC rules received from the H-PCRF,
the remaining steps in this call flow are not followed. Instead, the V-PCRF
shall notify the H-PCRF by sending a Diameter CCR, including the Experimental-
Result-Code AVP set to the value PCC_RULE_EVENT, identify the failed PCC rules
as specified in 3GPP TS 29.215 [22], and additionally may provide the
acceptable QoS Information for the service.
13c. The V-PCRF provisions PCC rules to the PCEF by using CCA command. The
parameters listed in step 13a are applicable here.
13d. In case of TDF, solicited application reporting, the V-PCRF provisions
the ADC rules to the TDF as defined in subclause 4.6.3.2. In case of TDF,
unsolicited application reporting, the V-PCRF initiates the TDF session
termination as defined in clause 4.6.2 if the PCEF reported the
UE_IP_ADDRESS_RELEASE to the V-PCRF and there is an active Ipv4 address
related TDF session for that IP-CAN session.
14\. In case of TDF, solicited application reporting, the H-PCRF provisions
the ADC rules to the TDF as defined in subclause 4.6.3.2. In case of TDF,
unsolicited application reporting, the H-PCRF initiates the TDF session
termination as defined in subclause 4.6.2 if the PCEF reported the
UE_IP_ADDRESS_RELEASE to the H-PCRF and there is an active Ipv4 address
related TDF session for that IP-CAN session.
15\. The PCEF installs, modifies or removes the provided PCC Rules. The PCEF
also enforces the authorized QoS and enables or disables service flows
according to the flow status of the corresponding PCC Rules. In the case of
PCEF supporting Application Detection and Control feature, the PCEF enforces
application detection and control.
16\. If traffic steering control over St applies, if the PCRF determines that
the traffic steering control information needs to be provisioned for the IP-
CAN session; the PCRF initiates the St session establishment procedure
according to the subclause 4.9.2. If the PCRF determines that the traffic
steering control information provisioned to the TSSF needs to be updated, the
PCRF initiates the St session modification procedure according to the
subclause 4.9.3. If the PCRF determines that the traffic steering control
information is not needed for the IP-CAN session any more, the PCRF initiates
the St session termination procedure according to the subclause 4.9.2.
17\. The PCEF may initiate IP-CAN session signalling or acknowledges any
IPâ€‘CAN Session signalling for IP-CAN Session modification received in step 2.
18\. If the PCRF requested to confirm that the resources associated to a PCC
Rule have been successfully allocated or the resource release procedure has
concluded, the PCEF-initiated IP-CAN session modification procedure is
performed again starting from step 3.
19\. For case 2a and 2b, the PCRF may initiate Gateway Control and QoS rules
Provision procedure described in subclause 4.4.3.
#### 4.3.2.2 PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification, AF located in the
VPLMN
Figure 4.3.2.2.1: PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification, AF in VPLMN. If
the AF resides in the VPLMN, the Vâ€‘PCRF proxies the AF session signalling over
S9 between the V-AF and the Hâ€‘PCRF.
1\. Steps 1 to 5 in figure 4.3.2.1.1 are executed.
When all PCC Rules related to a particular AF session are removed, the H-PCRF
initiates the AF session termination procedure. For each AF session bound to
the modified IP-CAN session that is being removed, steps 2-9 are executed
instead of steps 10-13:
2\. The H-PCRF indicates the session abort to the V-PCRF by sending a Diameter
ASR to the V-PCRF.
3\. The V-PCRF proxies the Diameter ASR command to the V-AF.
4\. The V-AF responds by sending a Diameter ASA command to the V-PCRF.
5\. The V-PCRF proxies the ASA command to the H-PCRF.
6\. The V-AF sends a Diameter STR command to the V-PCRF to indicate that the
session has been terminated.
7\. The V-PCRF proxies the Diameter STR command to the H-PCRF.
8\. The V-PCRF proxies the Diameter STA command to the V-AF.
9\. The H-PCRF responds by sending a Diameter STA command.
When the H-PCRF receives event triggers related to specific actions that the
AF has subscribed to, the H-PCRF initiates the AF session modification
procedure to notify the AF of these specific actions. For each Afsession bound
to the modified IP-CAN session that has subscribed to these specific actions,
steps 10-13 are executed instead of steps 2-9:
10\. If the H-PCRF is notified of an event in the access network that has to
be notified to the V-AF for an AF session, the H-PCRF informs of the event by
sending a RAR command to the V-PCRF.
11\. The V-PCRF proxies the RAR command to the V-AF.
12\. The V-AF responds by sending a RAA command to the V-PCRF.
13\. The V-PCRF proxies the RAA to the H-PCRF.
14\. Steps 12 to 18 in figure 4.3.2.1.1 are executed.
## 4.4 Gateway Control Session Procedures
There are two kinds of Gateway Control (GC) sessions:
\- A Gateway Control session that serves a single IP-CAN session (e.g.
S-GW/BBERF connecting to PDN-GW using S5/S8 PMIP according to 3GPP TS 23.402
[21]).
\- A Gateway Control session that serves all the IP-CAN sessions from the same
Care-of address of the UE (e.g. a UE connecting to PDN-GW using S2c according
to 3GPP TS 23.402 [21]).
These Gateway Control sessions are initiated in connection with IP-CAN session
establishment and Initial Attach respectively. For the first case, the PCRF
will identify that the GC session serves a single IP-CAN session based on the
PDN Identifier received in the request.
An access network may support mobility with BBERF change. The new BBERF shall
establish new Gateway Control sessions according to the procedures defined for
the new access type and the PCRF shall correlate those sessions with ongoing
IP-CAN sessions as part of the handover procedure.
These scenarios are shown separately in different flows.
In the following procedures, the V-PCRF is included to depict the roaming
scenarios. H-PCRF will act as a PCRF for non-roaming Ues. The procedure to
detect that the IP-CAN Session is restricted to Emergency Services is
described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].
### 4.4.1 Gateway Control Session Establishment
Figure 4.4.1.1 Gateway Control Session Establishment.
1\. The BBERF receives a message or indication that it needs to establish a
Gateway Control session.\ For case 2a, as defined in clause 4.0, the BBERF
detects that a UE has been assigned a Local IP address that the UE may use as
a Care-of Address in MIP registrations (see 3GPP TS 23.402 [21], clause 6.3).\
For case 2b, as defined in clause 4.0, the BBERF detects that the UE requests
an IP-CAN session to be established (see 3GPP TS 23.402 [21], clauses 4.5.2
and 5.6.1) or, at BBERF relocation, to be resumed with a certain APN (see 3GPP
TS 23.402 [21], clauses 5.7.1 and 5.7.2) or the UE requests a pre-registration
with this BBERF (see 3GPP TS 23.402 [21], clause 9.3.1).
2\. For the non-roaming case, the BBERF initiates a Gateway Control session
with the H-PCRF by sending a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP
set to the value INITIAL_REQUEST. The BBERF provides UE identity information
and the IP-CAN type, User Location Information, User CSG Information (if
received from the access network) and the indication of the BBERF support for
the extended TFT filters.\ For case 2a, as defined in clause 4.0, the BBERF
provides the CoA assigned to the UE.\ For case 2b, as defined in clause
4.0,the BBERF provides the PDN identifier and PDN connection identifier, if
multiple PDN connections for the same APN are supported and, if applicable, a
Session-Linking-Indicator to indicate if the session linking has to be
deferred. The BBERF provides, when available, the APN-AMBR and Default-EPS-
Bearer-QoS.
NOTE: The BBERF support is a prerequisite for the PCRF enabling the
possibility for usage of the extended TFT filter in the IP-CAN session(s).
If applicable for the IP-CAN type, the BBERF additionally provides Network-
Request-Support AVP to indicate whether NW-initiated procedures are supported.
When the UE is roaming, the steps 2a-2c are executed instead of step 2:
2a. The BBERF initiates a Gateway Control session with the V-PCRF by sending a
CCR to the V-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
INITIAL_REQUEST. The BBERF provides UE identity information and the IP-CAN
type, User Location Information and User CSG Information (if received from the
access network).\ For case 2a, as defined in clause 4.0, the BBERF provides
the CoA assigned to the UE.\ For case 2b, as defined in clause 4.0, the BBERF
provides the PDN identifier and, if applicable, a Session-Linking-Indicator
AVP to indicate if the session linking has to be deferred. The BBERF provides,
when available, the APN-AMBR and Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS.
If applicable for the IP-CAN type, the BBERF additionally provides Network-
Request-Support AVP to indicate whether NW-initiated procedures are supported.
2b. The V-PCRF determines based on the UE identity information that the
request is for a roaming user. The V-PCRF checks whether the V-PCRF needs to
send the CCR to the H-PCRF based on the roaming agreements. For the Visited
Access case, the V-PCRF does not send the CCR to the H-PCRF if the Session-
Linking-Indicator AVP was received indicating that the session linking has to
be deferred.
NOTE: If the V-PCRF does not send the CCR to the H-PCRF, the PCRF may generate
QoS rules based on VPLMN roaming agreements.
2c. For case 2a:
\- If there is not an already established S9 session for this roaming user,
the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the
value INITIAL_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes in the CCR the information received
in step 2a.
\- If there is an already established S9 session for this roaming user, the
V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
UPDATE_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes in the CCR the information received in
step 2a.
> For case 2b and for the visited case or for the home routed case and if the
> Session-Linking-Indicator AVP is not received or it indicates
> SESSION_LINKING_IMMEDIATE, the following procedures apply:
\- If there is not an already established S9 session for this roaming user,
the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the
value INITIAL_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes the Subsession-Enforcement-Info AVP
within the CCR with a new S9 subsession identifier assigned by the V-PCRF to
this Gateway Control Session within the Subsession-Id AVP, and the Subsession-
Operation AVP set to the value ESTABLISHMENT.
\- If there is an already established S9 session for this roaming user and not
an already established S9 subsession for the PDN connection corresponding to
the Gateway Control Session, the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-
Request-Type AVP set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes the
Subsession-Enforcement-Info AVP within the CCR with a new S9 subsession
identifier assigned by the V-PCRF to this Gateway Control Session within the
Subsession-Id AVP, and the Subsession-Operation AVP set to the value
ESTABLISHMENT.
\- If there is an already established S9 session for this roaming user and an
already established S9 subsession for the PDN connection corresponding to the
Gateway Control Session, the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-
Request-Type AVP set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes the
Subsession-Enforcement-Info AVP within the CCR command with the S9 subsession
identifier assigned by the V-PCRF for this Gateway Control Session within the
Subsession-Id AVP, the Subsession-Operation AVP set to the value MODIFICATION,
and the BBERF identity within AN-GW-Address AVP.
> For case 2b and for the home routed case and if the Session-Linking-
> Indicator AVP was received indicating that the session linking has to be
> deferred, following procedure applies:
\- The V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to
the value UPDATE_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes the Subsession-Enforcement-Info
AVP within the CCR with a new S9 subsession identifier assigned by the V-PCRF
to this Gateway Control Session within the Subsession-Id AVP, the Subsession-
Operation AVP set to the value ESTABLISHMENT and the Session-Linking-Indicator
AVP set to the value "SESSION_LINKING_DEFERRED".
3\. The H-PCRF stores the information received in the CCR. The H-PCRF
determines the network scenario that applies (case 2a or 2b) as described in
clause 4.0.
> For case 2a, the H-PCRF may correlate the UE identity information with
> already established Gx sessions for the same UE.\ For case 2b, for non
> roaming case, the H-PCRF links the Gateway Control session with the already
> established Gx Session and acts as follows:
\- if the Session-Linking-Indicator was received indicating that the session
linking has to be deferred, defers the session linking till the associated IP-
CAN session establishment or modification is received.
\- if the Session-Linking-Indicator was not received or indicates that the
session linking has to be performed immediately, links the Gateway Control
session with the already established Gx Session.
4\. If the H-PCRF requires subscription-related information and does not have
it, the H-PCRF sends a request to the SPR in order to receive the information.
5\. The SPR replies with the subscription related information containing the
information about the allowed service(s), QoS information, PCC Rules
information and may include MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority Level and IMS
Signalling Priority of establishment a PS session with priority.
NOTE: For steps 4 and 5: The details associated with the Sp reference point
are not specified in this Release. The SPR's relation to existing subscriber
databases is not specified in this Release.
6\. For case 2a, the H-PCRF may prepare for the installation of QoS rules if
available;
For case 2b, the H-PCRF may
\- At IP-CAN session establishment, if the session linking was not deferred,
select or generate and store PCC Rule(s) in preparation for the anticipated Gx
session and derive the QoS rules from them. If MPS EPS Priority, MPS Priority
Level, and IMS Signalling Priority are present for the user, the PCRF takes
the information into account. If the session linking was deferred, the PCC
rules are not generated;
\- At BBERF relocation and at pre-registration, if the Session-Linking-
Indicator was not received or indicates that the session linking has to be
performed immediately, prepare for the installation of QoS rules, derived from
the active PCC rules, at the target BBERF;
7\. The H-PCRF stores the selected QoS Rules and PCC Rules. If applicable the
H-PCRF selects the Bearer Control Mode that will apply during the Gateway
Control session.
8\. For the non-roaming case, the H-PCRF acknowledges the Gateway Control
Session by sending a CCA to the BBERF. The H-PCRF includes:
\- The selected BCM, if applicable for the IP-CAN type
\- If NW-initiated procedures are available, the available QoS rules
\- If BCM is UE-only, the QoS rules that correspond to the request from the
BBERF
\- Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS and APN-AMBR when applicable
\- The event triggers
When the UE is roaming, the steps 8a-8e are executed instead of step 8:
8a. The H-PCRF acknowledges the Gateway Control Session by sending a CCA to
the V-PCRF. The H-PCRF includes
\- The selected BCM, if applicable for the IP-CAN type
\- If NW-initiated procedures are available, the available QoS rules for the
home routed case or the available PCC rules for the visited access case
\- If BCM is UE-only, the QoS rules that correspond to the request from the
V-PCRF for the home routed case or the PCC rules that correspond to the
request from the V-PCRF for the visited access case
\- For the case 2a, the QoS rules when the available QoS rules are not related
to any IP-CAN session
\- Default-EPS-Bearer-QoS and APN-AMBR when applicable
\- Event triggers
8b. The V-PCRF enforces visited operator policies regarding QoS authorization
requested by the H-PCRF as indicated by the roaming agreements.
8c. If the V-PCRF denies an authorization, it informs the H-PCRF and may
provide the acceptable QoS Information for the service.
8d. The H-PCRF may provide new or modified QoS rules to the V-PCRF
8e. If V-PCRF receives the PCC rules from the H-PCRF, the V-PCRF extracts the
QoS rules from the PCC rules. The V-PCRF acknowledges the Gateway Control
Session establishment by sending a CCA to the BBERF. The V-PCRF includes the
selected BCM if applicable for the IP-CAN type, any applicable QoS rules and
event triggers.
9\. The BBERF installs and enforces the received QoS Rules.
10\. The BBERF sends an Establish Gateway Session Control Response to ack the
Gateway Control Session Request.
### 4.4.2 Gateway Control and QoS Rules Request
#### 4.4.2.1 Non-Roaming and Home Routed cases
Figure 4.4.2.1.1: Gateway Control and QoS Rules Request for non-roaming and
home routed
1\. The BBERF is triggered to either report an event or obtain QoS rules or
both for a gateway control session.
2\. The BBERF sends a Diameter CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP
set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST to report event or request QoS rules.
When the UE is roaming (home routed traffic), steps 2a \~ 2c are executed
instead of step 2:
2a. The BBERF sends a Diameter CCR to the V-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP
set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST to report event or request QoS rules.
2b. The V-PCRF stores the information received.
2c. For case 2a, The V-PCRF sends a Diameter CCR to the H-PCRF within the
information received in step 2a at command level.
For case 2b, The V-PCRF sends a Diameter CCR to the H-PCRF within the
information received in step 2a at Subsession-Enforcement-Info AVP.
3\. The H-PCRF stores the received information in the Diameter CCR and derives
updated QoS rules and event triggers.
4\. The H-PCRF provisions the updated QoS rules and event triggers to the
BBERF using Diameter CCA. The CCA may also only acknowledge that the event
report has been received successfully.
When the UE is roaming (home routed traffic), steps 4a \~ 4c are executed
instead of step 4:
4a. The H-PCRF sends the updated QoS rules and event triggers to the V-PCRF
using Diameter CCA. The CCA may also only acknowledge that the event report
has been received successfully.
4b. The V-PCRF may also perform further authorization of the rules based on
local policies.
4c. The V-PCRF sends the updated QoS rules and event triggers to the BBERF
using Diameter CCA.
5\. The BBERF installs the received QoS Rules and event triggers. This may
result in bearer binding being performed according to the rules. The BBERF
also enables or disables service flow according to the flow status of the
corresponding QoS Rules. The result of the QoS rule activation may trigger the
BBERF to send an additional Diameter CCR as described above to the PCRF, for
example, to indicate that QoS rule activation has failed.
#### 4.4.2.2 Visited access cases
Figure 4.4.2.2.1: Gateway Control and QoS Rules Request for visited access
1\. The BBERF is triggered to either report an event or obtain QoS rules or
both for a gateway control session.
2\. The BBERF sends a Diameter CCR to the V-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP
set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST to report event or request QoS rules.
3\. The V-PCRF stores the information received in the Diameter CCR and derives
updated QoS rules and event triggers according to local policies and roaming
agreements.
When the report event is subscribed by H-PCRF, the steps 3a\~3d are executed
instead of step3:
3a. The V-PCRF sends a Diameter CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP
set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST to report event.
For case 2a, the information received in step 2 is send to H-PCRF at command
level.
For case 2b, the CCR is send with the information provided at subsession level
within the Subsession-Enforcement-Info AVP.
3b. The H-PCRF stores the received information in the Diameter CCR and derives
event triggers.
3c. The H-PCRF sends the event triggers to the V-PCRF using Diameter CCA. The
CCA may also only acknowledge that the event report has been received
successfully.
3d. The V-PCRF may also perform further authorization of the rules based on
local policies.
4\. The V-PCRF provisions the updated QoS rules and event triggers to the
BBERF using Diameter CCA.
5\. The BBERF installs the received QoS Rules and event triggers. This may
result in bearer binding being performed according to the rules. The BBERF
also enables or disables service flow according to the flow status of the
corresponding QoS Rules. The result of the QoS rule activation may trigger the
BBERF to send an additional Diameter CCR as described above to the PCRF, for
example, to indicate that QoS rule activation has failed.
### 4.4.3 Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision
Since the PCRF is required to keep QoS rules aligned with the active PCC rules
for a certain IP-CAN session, it shall initiate the Gateway Control and QoS
Rules Provision whenever there is a change to the corresponding PCC rules for
a Gx session that is linked with the Gateway Control Session.
Figure 4.4.3.1: Gateway Control and QoS Rules Provision
1\. The H-PCRF receives an internal or external trigger to update QoS Rules
and event triggers for a gateway control session. If the trigger is from the
AF and the AF requests the access network information, the H-PCRF applies the
procedure as defined in clause 4a.5.16 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9] to request the
access network information. If the trigger is from the AF and the AF provided
the Sharing-Key-UL AVP and/or Sharing-Key-DL AVP within the Media-Component-
Description AVP, the H-PCRF may apply the procedures as defined in clause
4a.5.10.6 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9] to request the resource sharing.
2\. The H-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to request that the BBERF installs,
modifies or removes QoS Rules and/or updates the event triggers.
If the UE is roaming, then steps 2a \~ 2c are executed instead of step 2:
2a. The H-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to the V-PCRF to provision updated QoS
Rules and updated event triggers.
> For case 2a, the RAR provides the updated QoS Rules and updated event
> triggers with the information included at command level.
For case 2b, The H-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to the V-PCRF within the
information at Subsession-Decision-Info AVP.
2b. The V-PCRF identifies the gateway control session if needed and performs
local authorization of the updated QoS rules when necessary.
2c. The V-PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to the BBERF to provision updated QoS
rules and updated event triggers.
3\. The BBERF installs, modifies or removes the identified QoS Rules. The
BBERF also enforces the authorized QoS and enables or disables service flow
according to the flow status of the corresponding QoS Rules.
4\. The BBERF sends RAA to the H-PCRF to acknowledge the RAR and informs the
H-PCRF about the outcome of the QoS rule operation. If network initiated
resource allocation procedures apply for the QoS rules and the corresponding
IP-CAN bearer can not be established or modified to satisfy the bearer
binding, then the BBERF rejects the activation of a PCC rule.
If the UE is roaming, then steps 4a \~ 4b are executed instead of step 4:
4a. The BBERF sends RAA to the V-PCRF to acknowledge the RAR and informs the
V-PCRF about the outcome of the QoS rule operation. If network initiated
resource allocation procedures apply for the QoS rules and the corresponding
IP-CAN bearer can not be established or modified to satisfy the bearer
binding, then the BBERF rejects the activation of a PCC rule.
4b. The V-PCRF forwards the RAA to the H-PCRF to acknowledge the RAR and
informs the H-PCRF about the outcome of the QoS rule operation.
5\. If needed, the BBERF initiates the access specific procedures to create or
modify existing IP-CAN bearers. When the procedure in step 5 is completed and
requires of notifications from the BBERF to the PCRF, e.g. in the case of
access network information, the steps described as in clause 4.4.2 are
additionally executed.
### 4.4.4 Gateway Control Session Termination
#### 4.4.4.1 BBERF-Initiated Gateway Control Session Termination
This procedure applies for case 2b, as defined in clause 4.0, whenever the
BBERF detects a request for a PDN disconnection, mobility to other access or
the termination of a pre-registration at the BBERF.
Figure 4.4.4.1.1: BBERF-Initiated Gateway Control Session Termination
1\. The BBERF is requested to terminate its gateway control session. The form
of the request to remove the gateway control session depends upon the type of
the IP-CAN.
2\. The BBERF sends a Diameter CCR message to the H-PCRF, indicating the
gateway control session termination. The BBERF requests the termination of the
DCC session using the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
TERMINATION_REQUEST.
If the UE is roaming, then steps in 2a \~ 2b are executed instead of step 2:
2a. The BBERF sends a Diameter CCR message to the V-PCRF, indicating the
gateway control session termination. The BBERF requests the termination of the
DCC session using the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
TERMINATION_REQUEST.
2b. For the case 2a or if this is the last subsession associated with the S9
session for the case 2b, the V-PCRF sends a Diameter CCR message to the H-PCRF
to request the termination of the S9 session. Otherwise, if the gateway
control session is locally handled at the V-PCRF, the V-PCRF continues from
step 4b; if the gateway control session has a corresponding S9 subsession,
then the V-PCRF sends a Diameter CCR message to the H-PCRF to request the
termination of the corresponding S9 subsession.
3\. The H-PCRF identifies the related IP-CAN session and performs update as
necessary.
4\. The H-PCRF acknowledges the session termination by sending a Diameter CCA
message.
If the UE is roaming, then steps 4a \~ 4c are executed instead of step 4:
4a. If the H-PCRF receives the Diameter CCR message in step 2b, the H-PCRF
acknowledges the session or subsession termination request by sending a
Diameter CCA message to the V-PCRF.
4b. The V-PCRF identifies the related IP-CAN session and performs update as
necessary.
4c. The V-PCRF acknowledges the session termination by sending a Diameter CCA
message to the BBERF.
5\. The BBERF sends a reply to the request to remove the gateway control
session. The form of the reply depends upon the type of the IP-CAN.
#### 4.4.4.2 PCRF-Initiated Gateway Control Session Termination
This procedure applies for case 2a, as defined in clause 4.0, when the PCRF

## 4.6 Application Detection and Enforcement Procedures
### 4.6.1 TDF Session Establishment in case of solicited reporting
In the following procedure, the PCRF is the H-PCRF for the roaming UE with
home routed access and the V-PCRF for the roaming UE with visited access.
As part of the IP-CAN Session Establishment or Modification procedure, in case
of solicited application reporting with a TDF, the PCRF initiates a TDF
Session Establishment with the selected TDF. The TDF is selected based on data
received from the PCEF or a local configuration at the PCRF.
Figure 4.6.1.1: TDF Session Establishment in case of solicited reporting
1\. PCRF initiates a session towards the TDF. The PCRF provisions the
applicable ADC Rules for the corresponding TDF session by sending a Diameter
TS-Request to the TDF, including user identity information, the UE Ipv4
address and/or UE Ipv6 prefix and, if available, PDN identifier, IP-CAN type,
RAT type and additional parameters as defined in clause 4b.5.1.1 of 3GPP TS
29.212 [9]. PCRF may also subscribe to the Event Triggers (e.g.
APPLICATION_START and APPLICATION_STOP).
NOTE: For PDN type Ipv4v6, in case the UE Ipv4 address is not available in the
PCRF, the PCRF initiates the TDF session establishment providing the UE Ipv6
prefix, and will subsequently provide UE Ipv4 address to the TDF using Event-
Report-Indication AVP to the TDF.
1a. This step applies to the IP-CAN Session Establishment procedure. If online
charging is applicable for the TDF, and at least one ADC rule with charging
parameters was activated, then the TDF requests credit information from the
OCS over the Gyn interface. If the TDF receives credit re-authorisation
triggers from the OCS then it requests the PCRF via a TSA message to provision
the triggers at the PCEF and/or BBERF. The triggers to be provisioned are
specified in the Event-Report-Indication AVP in the TSA message.
2\. The TDF acknowledges the session establishment by sending a Diameter TS-
Answer. The TDF may include Event-Report-Indication in the response.
### 4.6.1A TDF Session Establishment in case of unsolicited reporting
In the following procedure, the PCRF is the H-PCRF for the roaming UE with
home routed access and the V-PCRF for the roaming UE with visited access.
When the TDF detects for an Ipv4 address or Ipv6 address the first application
start, the TDF shall initiate the TDF Session Establishment procedure with the
PCRF.
Figure 4.6.1A.1: TDF Session Establishment in case of unsolicited reporting
1\. The TDF initiates a session by sending a CCR to the PCRF using the CC-
Request-Type AVP set to the value INITIAL_REQUEST. The TDF provides the full
UE IP address using either Framed-IP-Address AVP or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP
and, if available, the PDN identifier. The TDF also includes the TDF-
Application-Identifier AVP, the Flow-Information AVP of the detected
application when service data flow descriptions are deducible, within the
Application-Detection-Information AVP and sets the event trigger value with
APPLICATION_START. If Flow-Information AVP is included, the TDF-Application-
Instance-Identifier shall also be included within the Application-Detection-
Information AVP in order to allow correlation of APPLICATION_START.
2 The PCRF stores the information and acknowledges the session establishment
by sending a CCA. The PCRF may include the Ipv6 prefix within the Framed-
Ipv6-Prefix AVP if the established TDF session is Ipv6 address related.
NOTE 1: The TDF handles each Ipv4 address and Ipv6 prefix within a separate
TDF session.
NOTE 2: In the scenario where the TDF performs initial Application Detection
on 81vailabi simultaneous traffic flows for the same Ipv6 prefix (i.e. two or
more from Ipv6 addresses of the same IP-CAN session) the TDF could not be
aware that those flows belong to the same IP-CAN session until a response is
received from the PCRF, containing the Ipv6 prefix. This leads to using
separate TDF sessions for the Ipv6 addresses for the same IP-CAN session. The
TDF reports new application detection information related to that Ipv6 prefix
via any of the TDF sessions at a later stage.
### 4.6.2 TDF Session termination
In the following procedures, the PCRF is the H-PCRF for the roaming UE with
home routed access and the V-PCRF for the roaming UE with visited access.
This procedure applies in any of the following cases:
\- the corresponding IP-CAN session is terminated;
\- the Ipv4 address of a dual stack IP-CAN session is released and there is an
active Ipv4 address related TDF session for the IP-CAN session (only for
unsolicited application reporting);
\- at any point of time when the PCRF decides that the session with TDF is to
be terminated (e.g. subscriber profile changes).
Figure 4.6.2.1: TDF Session Termination
1\. The PCRF sends a RAR including the Session-Release-Cause AVP to request
that the TDF terminates the TDF session.
2\. For the solicited application reporting, the TDF removes/deactivates all
the ADC Rules which are applied to the TDF session.
3\. The TDF sends a RAA to acknowledge the RAR.
4\. The TDF sends a CCR to the PCRF, indicating the TDF Session termination.
The TDF requests the termination of the Sd session using the CC-Request-Type
AVP set to the value TERMINATION_REQUEST. For solicited application reporting,
if the usage monitoring is enabled, the TDF informs the PCRF about the
resources that have been consumed by the user since the last report in the
same request.
5\. The PCRF acknowledges the TDF session termination by sending a CCA to the
TDF.
### 4.6.3 TDF Session modification

Figure 4.6.3.1.1 Application Detection, Reporting and Control Rules Request
1\. TDF is triggered to report an event(s) (e.g. The TDF detects the
start/stop of an application traffic that matches with one or more activated
ADC rules that do not contain the Mute-Notification AVP) for a TDF session.
For the start of traffic detection, in case the enforcement actions were
provided as a part of ADC rules, the TDF enforces corresponding actions for
solicited application reporting.
2\. The TDF sends a Diameter CCR to the PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set
to the value UPDATE_REQUEST to report an event. For the start of traffic
detection, if PCRF has previously subscribed to the
APPLICATION_START/APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers, the TDF includes TDF-
Application-Identifier AVP, the Flow-Information AVP of the detected
application when service data flow descriptions are deducible, within the
Application-Detection-Information AVP and sets the event trigger value with
APPLICATION_START. If Flow-Information AVP is included, the TDF-Application-
Instance-Identifier shall also be included within the Application-Detection-
Information AVP in order to allow correlation of APPLICATION_START. For the
stop of traffic detection, if PCRF has previously subscribed to the
APPLICATION_START/APPLICATION_STOP Event-Triggers, the TDF includes TDF-
Application-Identifier AVP, the TDF-Application-Instance-Identifier AVP, if
provided in the report of the start of application traffic detection within
the Application-Detection-Information AVP and sets the event trigger value
with APPLICATION_STOP. For the solicited application reporting, if usage
monitoring is enabled and the usage threshold is reached or the PCRF removes
the last ADC rule applicable for certain monitoring key or disables usage
monitoring or requests usage report, the TDF may inform the PCRF about the
corresponding usage that have been consumed by the user since the last report.
3\. The PCRF stores the information, received in the Diameter CCR and makes
the PCC/QoS and -- in the solicited reporting case -- ADC decisions.
4\. The PCRF acknowledges to the TDF by sending a Diameter CCA. For the
solicited application reporting, the PCRF may provide a new ADC decisions by
including the ADC-Rule-Install AVP and/or ADC-Rule-Remove AVP to the TDF
within this acknowledge.
5\. For the solicited application reporting, the TDF installs, modifies and
removes the ADC rules according the new ADC decisions provided in step 4.
NOTE: If the installation or modification of one or more ADC rules fails, the
TDF reports the failure to the PCRF as defined in clause 4b.5.5 of 3GPP TS
29.212 [9].
#### 4.6.3.2 Application Detection and Control Rules Provision
In the following procedure, the PCRF is the H-PCRF for the roaming UE with
home routed access and the V-PCRF for the roaming UE with visited access. This
procedure is applicable only for the solicited application reporting.
Figure 4.6.3.2.1 Application Detection and Control Rules Provision
1\. The PCRF receives an internal or external trigger (e.g. the subscriber's
profile configuration is changed) to update the ADC rule or notify the event
occurred at the PCEF/BBERF for a TDF session.
2\. The PCRF sends a Diameter RAR to provide a new ADC decision by including
the ADC-Rule-Install AVP and/or ADC-Rule-Remove AVP or notify the event
occurred at the PCEF/BBERF by including the Event-Report-Indication AVP.
3\. The TDF stores the information, received in the Diameter RAR. The TDF
installs, modifies and removes the ADC rules according the new ADC decisions
provided in step 2.
4\. The TDF acknowledges to the PCRF by sending a Diameter RAA to inform the
PCRF about the outcome of the actions related to the decision(s).

and the PCRF requested notification of changes in the status of a policy
counter(s). Alternatively, if the OCS detects a policy counter status will
change at a future point in time, the OCS shall be able to instruct the PCRF
to apply one or more pending statuses for a requested policy counter.
2\. When the status of a specific policy counter changes, or the OCS detects
that a policy counter status will change at a future point in time and decides
to instruct the PCRF to apply one or more pending statuses for a requested
policy counter, the OCS shall determine the Sy sessions impacted by the change
(i.e. those Sy sessions that have subscribed to status change notifications
for the changed policy counter) and send the Diameter SNR command to the PCRF
associated with each affected Sy session including one Policy-Counter-Status-
Report AVP. If several counters change status at the same time, the OCS may
group the status change notifications into a single Spending Limit Report
request to the PCRF by sending multiple Policy-Counter-Status-Report AVPs in
the request.
NOTE: Sy session is per UE. And more than one Sy session will exist when the
UE has IP-CAN session connection with more than one PCRF.

# 5 Binding Mechanism
## 5.1 Overview
The binding mechanism associates the session information with the IP-CAN
bearer that is intended to carry the service data flow.
For PCC rules with application identifier, and for certain IP-CAN types, up-
link traffic can be received on other/additional IP-CAN bearers than the one
determined by the binding mechanism (further details provided in clause
6.2.2.2 and the IP-CAN specific annexes of 3GPP TS 23.203 [2]).
The binding mechanism includes three steps as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [2]:
1\. Session binding.
2\. PCC Rule authorization and QoS Rule generation.
3\. Bearer binding.
The Session Binding function receives the Session Information and determines
the relevant IP-CAN session. With this information the PCC Rule Authorization
and QoS Rule generation function runs the policy rules and constructs the PCC
rule(s) and if applicable, the QoS rule(s) if the authorization is granted.
Finally the Bearer Binding function selects the IP-CAN bearer where the PCC
rule(s) or QoS rule(s) should be installed within the IP-CAN session already
known.
PCC Rule Authorization and QoS Rule generation function and Bearer Binding
function can take place without Session Binding at certain IP-CAN Session
events (e.g. IP-CAN Session Establishment).
## 5.2 Session Binding
Session binding is the association of the AF session information to an IP-CAN
session.
When the PCRF accepts an AA-Request from the AF over the Rx interface with
service information, the PCRF shall perform session binding and associate the
described service IP flows within the AF session information (and therefore
the applicable PCC rules) to one and only one existing IP-CAN session. When
the PCRF receives an AA-Request from the P-CSCF acting as an AF over the Rx
interface for P-CSCF Restoration, the PCRF shall perform session binding and
associate the request to the existing IMS PDN connection and perform P-CSCF
Restoration for that impacted IMS PDN connection. This association is done
comparing the user IP address received via the Rx interface in either the
Frame-IP-Address AVP or the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP with the Ipv4 address or
Ipv6 prefix received via the Gx interface. The UE Identity if present in the
Subscription-Id AVP and the PDN information if available in the Called-
Station-Id AVP may also assist on this association. The Domain identity if
available in the IP-Domain-Id AVP may also assist on this association, e.g. if
other user identity information than the UE IP address is unavailable and the
UE IP addresses is not unique for a certain APN.
NOTE 1: The UE IP address is unique per Domain identity.
NOTE 2: The IP-Domain-Id AVP is helpful in the following scenario: Within a
PLMN, there are several separate IP address domains, with PCEF(s) that
allocate Ipv4 IP addresses out of the same private address range to Ues. The
same IP address can thus be allocated to Ues served by PCEFs in different
address domains. If one PCRF controls several PCEFs in different IP address
domains, the UE IP address is thus not sufficient for the session binding. An
AF can serve Ues in different IP address domains, either by having direct IP
interfaces to those domains, or by having interconnections via NATs in the
user plane between PCEFs and the AF. If a NAT is used, the AF obtains the IP
address allocated to the UE via application level signalling and supplies it
for the session binding as Framed-IP-Address to the PCRF. The AF supplies an
IP-Domain-Id value denoting the IP address domain behind the NAT in addition.
The AF can derive the appropriate value from the source address (allocated by
the NAT) of incoming user plane packets.
NOTE 3ï¼šWhen the scenario described in NOTE 2 applies and the AF is a P-CSCF it
is assumed that the P-CSCF has direct IP interfaces to the different IP
address domains and that no NAT is located between P-GW and P-CSCF. How a non-
IMS AF obtains the UE private IP address to be provided to the PCRF is out of
scope of the present release; it is unspecified how to support applications
that use a protocol that does not retain the original UE's private IP address.
If the Domain identity is not used to assist association, the PCRF will
determine that the UE has an IP-CAN session if the IP address (Ipv4 or Ipv6)
received over the Rx interface matches the Ipv4 address or Ipv6 prefix
received via one or more of the following interfaces: Gx interface and S9
interface, and if the UE identity is used to assist the association, the UE
identity received over the Rx interface matches the UE identity received via
one or more of the following interfaces: Gx interface and S9 interface.
If the Domain identity is used to assist association, the PCRF will determine
that the UE has an IP-CAN session if the Domain identity received over the Rx
interface matches the PCEF Identity received via the Gx interface, and the IP
address (Ipv4) received over the Rx interface matches the Ipv4 address
received via the Gx interface.
For the roaming scenario, the Domain identity may be used for session binding
when the AF and PCEF are located in same PLMN, i.e. for the home routed case,
the Domain identity may be used by the (H-)PCRF for session binding, and for
the visited case, Domain identity could be used by the V-PCRF for session
binding.
For an IP-CAN session associated to a dedicated APN for the purpose of
offering services to remote UEs via a ProSe UE-to-network relay UE, the PCRF
shall use the UE IPv6 prefix alone in the session binding.
NOTE 4: In case the UE identity in the IP-CAN and the application level
identity for the user are of different kinds, the PCRF needs to maintain, or
have access to, the mapping between the identities. Such mapping is not
subject to specification within this TS.
NOTE 5: An Ipv6 address provided over Rx matches an Ipv6 prefix provided over
Gx or S9 if the Ipv6 address belongs to the Ipv6 (sub-)network prefix.
NOTE 6: The PCRF derives the PCEF identity from the Origin-Host AVP of the CCR
command received from the PCEF. In order to correlate the PCEF Identity and
the domain identity received over the Rx interface, the PCRF uses configured
mapping between those identities. The Domain Identity is useful for assistance
in session binding if the Origin-Host of the Gx CCR command is not modified by
intermediate Diameter proxies deployed between the PCEF and the PCRF.
NOTE 7: The PCEF identity is not transported over S9 reference point in the
present release. So for the visited access with AF located in HPLMN case,
session binding assisted with Domain identity is not supported in the present
release. Session binding is still possible based on other available
information in addition to the IP address when provided by the AF, according
to the current procedures.
If the PCRF uses the Called-Station-Id AVP to assist the association, the PCRF
shall apply the procedures in Annex I to match APN information.
As a result from the session binding function, the PCRF identifies what IP-CAN
session the current AF session is related with. If the PCRF is not capable of
executing the Session Binding, the PCRF shall issue an AA-Answer command to
the AF with a negative response.
## 5.3 PCC Rule Authorization and QoS Rule Generation
The PCRF shall perform the PCC rule authorization and QoS rule generation when
the PCRF receives session information from an AF over Rx interface, when the
PCRF receives notification of IP-CAN session events (e.g. establishment,
modification) from the PCEF over Gx or S9 interface, when the PCRF receives
IP-CAN events from the BBERF over Gxa/Gxc interface, or the PCRF receives a
notification from the SPR that calls for a policy decision. The PCRF shall
also perform PCC Rule Authorization and QoS Rule generation for dynamic PCC
Rules already provisioned to the PCEF and dynamic QoS rules already
provisioned to the BBERF due to internal PCRF triggers (e.g. policies are
included or modified within PCRF).
If the PCRF receives any traffic mapping information from the BBF that does
not match any service data flow filter, the PCRF shall also perform PCC and/or
QoS rule authorization when the UE's subscriber profile allows subscription
based authorization. In this case, the PCRF shall treat the received traffic
mapping information as if it is service data flow filter information.
If the PCRF receives from the AF a reference ID together with the AF session
information, the PCRF may provide it to the SPR in order to retrieve the
corresponding transfer policy. The PCRF shall derive the PCC rules for the
background data transfer according to the retrieved transfer policy.
NOTE 1: A transfer policy is only valid within its time window. The removal of
outdated transfer policies from the SPR is up to implementation.
If the PCRF receives information from the SPR for the invocation/revocation of
a Priority EPS Bearer service (i.e. the MPS EPS Priority is set/removed or the
MPS Priority Level changes while the MPS EPS Priority is set) , then the PCRF
should change the QCI/ARP of the dynamic PCC/QoS rules that have the same
QCI/ARP as for the present default EPS bearer with the new QCI/ARP assigned to
the default EPS bearer unless those PCC rules contain an indication that they
have to be bound to the default EPS bearer. If there are active non-MPS
services, the QCI/ARP of the PCC/QoS rules related to the non-MPS services
shall also be changed.
If the PCRF receives information from the SPR that invokes/revokes the IMS
Signalling Priority or changes the MPS Priority Level while IMS Signaling
Priority is enabled, then the PCRF should
\- change the ARP of the dynamic PCC/QoS rules applicable to the IM CN
signalling
\- replace the predefined PCC rules applicable to the IM CN signalling by
predefined rules that apply when the IMS Signalling Priority is set according
to operator policies
When IMS Signalling Priority is set, the PCRF should keep the ARP assigned to
the default EPS bearer higher than the ARP related to the IM CN signalling
bearer.
NOTE 2. IMS Signalling Priority only applies to an APN enabled for IMS.
The PCRF assigns appropriate QoS parameters (QCI, ARP, GBR, MBR, etc.) to each
PCC or QoS rule. The PCRF takes the information received over Rx into account
for determining the appropriate QCI/ARP. If the Rx authorization indicates IMS
Multimedia Priority Service, then the PCRF shall allow the prioritization of
the MPS session according to clauses 4.5.19.1.3 and 4a.5.14.1.3 in 3GPP TS
29.212 [9] for Gx/Gxx respectively. If the Rx authorization indicates Group
Communication Service prioritization as described in 3GPP TS 23.468 [34], then
the PCRF shall allow the prioritization of the Group Communication session
according to clause 4.5.19 in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].
The PCRF authorizes the affected PCC rules and /or QoS rules after successful
Session Binding. By the authorization process the PCRF will determine whether
the user can have access to the requested services and under what constraints.
If so, the PCC rules and QoS rules are created or modified. If the Session
Information is not authorized, a negative answer shall be issued to the AF by
sending an AA-Answer command.
The PCRF assigns an appropriate QCI to each PCC or QoS rule. IP-CAN specific
restrictions and other information available to the PCRF (e.g. users
subscription information, operator policies) shall be taken into account. Each
PCC or QoS rule shall receive a QCI that can be supported by the IP-CAN. The
PCRF shall ensure consistency between the QoS rules and PCC rules authorized
for the same service data flow when QoS rules are derived from corresponding
PCC rules.
If PrioritySharing feature is supported over Rx reference point as described
in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10], the PCRF shall apply the priority sharing procedures
as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9], subclauses 4.5.27 and 4a.5.17, if
applicable.
In roaming scenarios, the V-PCRF may further authorize the rules received from
the H-PCRF based on local operator policy. Depending on the local policy, the
V-PCRF may change the authorized QoS for the affected rules. If local
authorization of the rules fails, the V-PCRF shall issue a negative answer to
the H-PCRF.
## 5.4 Bearer Binding
The Bearer Binding function is responsible for associating a PCC rule and QoS
rule (if applicable) to an IP-CAN bearer within the IP-CAN session. The QoS
demand in the rule, as well as the service data flow template, is input to the
bearer binding. The selected bearer shall have the same QCI and ARP as the one
indicated by the PCC or QoS rule.
When Rule-Bound-to-Default-Bearer feature is supported as described in 3GPP TS
29.212 [9], the value included within the Default-Bearer-Indication AVP shall
be used as input for the bearer binding instead of the QoS demand in the rule.
NOTE 1: The PCRF provides the appropriate ARP/QCI for both PCC Rules and
default bearer QoS so that the PCEF can perform a valid bearer binding.
Alternatively, when Rule-Bound-to-Default-Bearer feature is supported, the
PCRF can provide the Default-Bearer-Indication AVP within the PCC Rules to
indicate that these PCC Rules have to be bound to the default bearer
regardless of the provisioned ARP/QCI.
The Bearer Binding Function (BBF) is located either at the BBERF or at the
PCEF.
The PCRF shall supply the PCC rules to be installed, modified or removed over
Gx interface to PCEF. If there are gateway controls sessions associated with
the Gx session, the PCRF shall also supply the QoS rules to be installed,
modified, or removed over Gxa/Gxc interface to the BBERF.
When Rule-Bound-to-Default-Bearer feature is supported, the BBF located at the
PCEF shall bind to the default bearer the PCC rules that have indicated so.
For the rules that do not contain an indication that they have to be bound to
the default bearer, the BBF shall then check the QoS class identifier and ARP
indicated by the rule and bind the rule with an IP-CAN bearer that has the
same QoS class identifier and ARP. The BBF shall evaluate whether it is
possible to use one of the existing IP-CAN bearers or not and, if applicable,
whether to initiate IP-CAN bearer modification or not. If none of the existing
bearers are possible to use, the BBF should initiate the establishment of a
suitable IP-CAN bearer. The BBF should not bind rules with the PS to CS
session continuity indicator to the same bearer as the rules without the PS to
CS session continuity indicator.
NOTE 2: For an IP-CAN, limited to a single IP-CAN bearer per IP-CAN session,
the bearer is implicit, so finding the IP-CAN session is sufficient for
successful bearer binding.
NOTE 3: The handling of a rule with MBR>GBR is up to operator policy (e.g. an
independent IP-CAN bearer may be maintained for that SDF to prevent unfairness
between competing SDFs).
NOTE 4: The QCI and ARP (including the Priority-Level, Pre-emption-Capability
and Pre-emption-Vulnerability) are used for the bearer binding. Depending on
operator policy, only the QCI and ARP Priority-Level can be used for bearer
binding. In such a case, it is left to operator policy to determine whether
different PCC rules with the same QCI and ARP Priority-Level but different
Pre-emption-Capability and Pre-emption-Vulnerability can be bound to the same
bearer.
For an IP-CAN, where the BBF gains no information on what IP-CAN bearer the UE
selects to send an uplink IP flow on, the binding mechanism shall assume that,
for bi-directional service data flows, both downlink and uplink packets travel
on the same IP-CAN bearer.
Whenever the service data flow template, the QoS authorization of a PCC/QoS
rule or the negotiated traffic mapping information change, the existing bearer
bindings shall be re-evaluated. The re-evaluation may, for a service data
flow, require a new binding with another IP-CAN bearer. The BBF should, if the
PCRF requests the same change to the ARP/QCI for all PCC/QoS Rules bound to
the same bearer, modify the bearer ARP/QCI as requested.
NOTE 5: A QoS change of the default EPS bearer causes the bearer binding for
PCC/QoS rules previously bound to the default EPS bearer to be re-evaluated.
During PCC/QoS rules enforcement, if packet filters are provided to the UE,
the BBF shall provide packet filters with the same content as that in the SDF
template filters received over the Gx/Gxx interface from the PCRF within the
Flow-Description or the Flow-Information AVP. The representation/format of the
packet filters provided by the network to the UE is access-system dependent
and may vary between accesses and also may be different from that of the SDF
template filter on the Gx/Gxx interface. The PCRF may control the provisioning
of packet filters to the UE, i.e. which filters are required to be sent to the
UE, as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].
If PCC rule(s) with application identifier(s) are the only PCC rule(s) that
are bound to a bearer which requires traffic mapping information, the PCEF
shall derive traffic mapping information based on implementation specific
logic (e.g. traffic mapping information that effectively disallows any useful
packet flows in uplink direction as described in clause 15.3.3.4 of 3GPP TS
23.060 [3]) and provides it to the UE.
NOTE 6: For GPRS and EPS, the state of TFT packet filters, as defined in 3GPP
TS 23.060 [3], for an IP-CAN session requires that there is at most one bearer
with no TFT packet filter for the uplink direction.
Requirements specific for each type of IP-CAN are defined in the IP-CAN
specific Annex. The Bearer Binding Function may also be located in the PCRF
(e.g. as specified in Annex D for GPRS running UE only IP-CAN bearer
establishment mode). Selection of the Bearer Binding location shall be based
on the Bearer Control Mode selected by the PCRF.
# 6 QoS Parameters Mapping
## 6.1 Overview
Several QoS parameters mapping functions are needed during PCC interaction.
These functions are located at the AF, PCRF, PCEF and UE. The main purpose of
these mapping functions is the conversion of QoS parameters from one format to
another. Examples of QoS information are:
\- Parts of a session description language (SDI), e.g. SDP, MPD.
\- IP QoS parameters.
\- Access specific QoS parameters.
One QoS mapping function is located at the AF, which maps the application
specific information into the appropriate AVPs that are carried over the Rx
interface. The AF derives information about the service from the SDI or from
other sources. The mapping is application specific. If SDP (IETF RFC 2327
[11]) is used as SDI, the AF should apply the mapping described in clause 6.2.
If MPD (3GPP TS 26.247 [30]) is used, the AF may apply the mapping described
in Annex X in 3GPP TS 26.247 [30]. For IMS, the mapping rules in clause 6.2
shall be used at the P-CSCF. The AF passes service information to the PCRF
over the Rx interface. Subclause 6.2 specifies the QoS parameter mapping
functions at the AF applicable for all IMS P-CSCFs regardless of the access
technology.
One QoS mapping function is located at the PCRF, which maps the service
information received over the Rx interface into IP QoS parameters (e.g. QCI,
GBR, MBR, ARP, ...). This mapping is access independent. Subclause 6.3
specifies the QoS mapping functions at the PCRF applicable for all accesses.
The other mapping functions located at PCEF, BBERF, and UE are implementation
dependent and are not specified within this specification except for GPRS
case.
The PCRF notes and authorizes the IP flows described within this service
information by mapping from service information to Authorized IP QoS
parameters for transfer to the PCEF/BBERF via the Gx/Gxx interface. Both the
PCEF and BBERF will map from the Authorized IP QoS parameters to the access
specific QoS parameters. For GPRS, the GGSN acting as PCEF will map from the
Authorized IP QoS parameters to the Authorized UMTS QoS parameters.
The general QoS mapping framework is shown in figure 6.1.1.

NOTE 1: The AF can derive the Service information from the AF session
signalling.
NOTE 2: Service Information on Rx interface to Authorized IP QoS parameters
mapping.
NOTE 3: For the UE initiated bearer setup, the UE may derive IP QoS
parameters, requested Access-Specific QoS parameters mapping and Authorized
Access-Specific QoS parameters from the AF session signalling.

parameters mapping.
NOTE 5: Access Specific QoS parameters with Authorized Access-Specific QoS
parameters comparison.
### 6.1.1 UE-Initiated IP-CAN bearers
This clause covers the case where the UE is capable to initiate/modify the IP-
CAN bearers sending requests to the PCEF/BBERF. When a UE desires to
establish/modify an IP-CAN bearer the following steps are followed:
1\. The AF can map from SDI within the AF session signalling to service
information passed to the PCRF over the Rx interface. (see clause 6.2 if SDP
is used as SDI).
2\. The PCRF shall map from the service information received over the Rx
interface to the Authorized IP QoS parameters that shall be passed to the
PCEF/BBERF via the Gx/Gxx interface. The mapping is performed for each IP
flow. Upon a request from the PCEF/BBERF, the PCRF combines per direction the
individual Authorized IP QoS parameters per flow (see clause 6.3).
3\. The UE derives access specific QoS parameters, e.g. UMTS QoS parameters,
and, if an IP BS manager is present, IP QoS parameters from the AF session
signalling in an application specific manner. The IP and access specific QoS
parameters should be generated according to application demands.\ \ For GPRS,
the recommendations for conversational (3GPP TS 26.114 [29]) or streaming
applications (3GPP TS 26.234 [6]) should also be taken into account when the
UE derives the IP and UMTS QoS parameters. If SDP is used as SDI, e.g. for
IMS, the UE should apply clause 6.5.1.and should also apply mapping rules for
the authorised QoS parameters in clause 6.5.2 to derive the maximum values for
the different requested bit rates and traffic classes. In case the UE
multiplexes several IP flows onto the same PDP Context, it has to combine
their IP and UMTS QoS parameters. If an IP BS manager is present, the
Translation/Mapping function maps the IP QoS parameters to the corresponding
UMTS QoS parameters.
4\. The PCEF/BBERF shall map from the Authorized IP QoS parameters received
from PCRF to the Authorized access specific QoS parameters.
> For GPRS. The GGSN shall map to the Authorized UMTS QoS parameters (see
> clause 6.4.1.1).
5\. The PCEF/BBERF shall compare the requested access specific QoS parameters
against the authorized access specific QoS parameters.
> For GPRS, the GGSN shall compare the UMTS QoS parameters of the PDP context
> against the Authorized UMTS QoS parameters (see clause 6.4.1.2).
The mapping that takes place in the UE and the network should be compatible in
order to ensure that the PCEF will be able to correctly authorize the session.
Figure 6.1.1.1 shows the different kind of QoS parameters in the different
points of QoS mapping figure. Due to the UE requests, there are bidirectional
flows between the UE and the PCRF.
Figure 6.1.1.1: QoS mapping for UE initiated IP CAN bearers
### 6.1.2 Network-Initiated IP-CAN bearers
When the IP-CAN session supports Network-Initiated bearers, the network sets
up IP CAN bearer(s) with a suitable QoS. If the type of IP CAN supports such
an indication, the network indicates to the terminal the QoS characteristics
of those IP-CAN bearer(s). Therefore the flow of QoS related information will
be unidirectional as indicated in the figure 6.1.2.1.
EMBED Word.Picture.8
Figure 6.1.2.1: QoS mapping for network initiated IP CAN bearers
1\. The AF can map from SDI within the AF session signalling to service
information passed to the PCRF over the Rx interface (see subclause 6.2 if SDP
is used as SDI).
2\. The PCRF shall map from the service information received over the Rx
interface to the Authorized IP QoS parameters that shall be passed to the
PCEF/BBERF via the Gx/Gxx interface. The mapping is performed for each IP
flow. Upon a request from the PCEF/BBERF, the PCRF combines per direction the
individual Authorized IP QoS parameters per flow (see subclause 6.3).
3\. The PCEF/BBERF shall map from the Authorized IP QoS parameters received
from PCRF to the access specific QoS parameters. For GPRS, the GGSN shall map
to the UMTS QoS parameters (see clause 6.4.1.1).
## 6.2 QoS parameter mapping Functions at AF
The mapping described in this clause is mandatory for the P-CSCF and should
also be applied by other AFs, if the SDI is SDP.
When a session is initiated or modified the P-CSCF shall use the mapping rules
in table 6.2.1 for each SDP media component to derive a Media-Component-
Description AVP from the SDP Parameters. The mapping shall not apply to media
components where the SDP payload is proposing to use a circuit-switched bearer
(i.e. \"c=\" line set to \"PSTN\" and an \"m=\" line set to \"PSTN\", refer to
3GPP TS 24.292 [24]). Circuit-switched bearer related media shall not be
included in the service information sent to the PCRF.

## 6.3 QoS parameter mapping Functions at PCRF
The QoS authorization process consists of the derivation of the parameters
Authorized QoS Class Identifier (QCI), Allocation and Retention Priority
(ARP), and Authorized Maximum/Guaranteed Data Rate UL/DL.
When a session is initiated or modified the PCRF shall derive Authorized IP
QoS parameters (i.e. QCI, Authorized Maximum/Guaranteed Data Rate DL/UL, ARP)
from the service information. If the selected Bearer Control Mode (BCM) is UE-
only this process shall be performed according to the mapping rules in table
6.3.1 to avoid undesired misalignments with the UE QoS parameters mapping.
In the case of forking, the various forked responses may have different QoS
requirements for the IP flows of the same media component. Each Authorized IP
QoS Parameter should be set to the highest value requested for the IP flow(s)
of that media component by any of the active forked responses.

The support of this | | | behaviour is optional. | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
The PCRF should per ongoing session store the Authorized IP QoS parameters per
for each IP flow or bidirectional combination of IP flows (as described within
a Media Subcomponent AVP).
If the PCRF provides a QoS-Information AVP within a Charging-Rule-Definition
AVP it may apply the rules in table 6.3.2 to combine the Authorized QoS per IP
flow or bidirectional combination of IP flows (as derived according to table
6.3.1) for all IP flows described by the corresponding PCC rule.
If the PCRF provides a QoS-Information AVP for an entire IP CAN bearer (for a
UE-initiated IP-CAN bearer in the GPRS case) or IP CAN session, it may apply
the rules in table 6.3.2 to combine the Authorized QoS per IP flow or
bidirectional combination of IP flows (as derived according to table 6.3.1)
for all IP flows allowed to be transported within the IP CAN bearer or
session. It is recommended that the rules in table 6.3.2 are applied for all
IP flows with corresponding AF session. The PCRF may increase the authorized
QoS further to take into account the requirements of predefined PCC rules
without ongoing AF sessions.
NOTE: QoS-Information AVP provided at IP-CAN session level is not derived
based on mapping tables, but based on subscription and operator specific
policies.
NOTE: Allocation-Retention-Priority AVP is always calculated at PCC rule level
according to table 6.3.2.
For a UE initiated PDP context within GPRS, the PCRF applies the binding
mechanism described in clause 5 to decide which flows are allowed to be
transported within the IP CAN bearer.

#### 6.4.1.2 Comparing UMTS QoS Parameters against the Authorized UMTS QoS
parameters in GGSN for UE initiated PDP context
Upon receiving a PDP context activation, the GGSN requests PCC rules from the

QoS Parameters per PDP context together with the PCC rules. The GGSN maps the
Authorized IP QoS parameters per PDP Context to Authorized UMTS QoS parameters
according to subclause 6.4.1.1 and then compares the requested UMTS QoS
parameters against the corresponding Authorized UMTS QoS parameters. The
following criteria shall be fulfilled:
\- If the requested Guaranteed Bitrate DL/UL (if the requested Traffic Class
is Conversational or Streaming) is equal to the Authorized Guaranteed data
rate DL/UL; and
\- if received, the requested Maximum Bitrate DL/UL (if the requested Traffic
Class is Interactive or Background) is equal to Maximum Authorized data rate
DL/UL; and
\- the requested Traffic Class is equal to Maximum Authorized Traffic Class;
and.
\- if received, the requested Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority is equal
to Allocation-Retention-Priority.
\- if received, the requested APN-AMBR DL/UL is equal to the APN-Aggregate-
Max-Bitrate DL/UL.
Then, the GGSN shall accept the PDP context activation or modification with
the UE requested parameters.Otherwise, the GGSN is adjusted (downgrade or
upgrade) the requested UMTS QoS parameters to the values that were authorized.

#### 6.4.2.2 Comparing UMTS QoS Parameters against the Authorized UMTS QoS
parameters in P-GW for UE initiated PDP context
Upon receiving a PDP context activation, the P-GW requests PCC rules from the
PCRF (see 3GPP TS 29.212 [9] for details). The PCRF may supply Authorized IP
QoS Parameters applicable for the provided PCC rules. The P-GW calculates the
Authorized IP QoS parameters per bearer and maps the Authorized IP QoS
parameters per bearer to Authorized UMTS QoS parameters according to subclause
6.4.2.1 and then compares the requested UMTS QoS parameters against the
corresponding Authorized UMTS QoS parameters. The following criteria shall be
fulfilled:
\- If the requested Guaranteed Bitrate DL/UL (if the requested Traffic Class
is Conversational or Streaming) is equal to the Authorized Guaranteed data
rate DL/UL; and
\- the requested Maximum Bitrate DL/UL (if the requested Traffic Class is
Interactive or Background) is equal to Maximum Authorized data rate DL/UL; and
\- the requested Traffic Class is equal to Maximum Authorized Traffic Class;
and
\- if received, the requested Evolved Allocation/Retention Priority is equal
to Allocation-Retention-Priority.
Then, the P-GW shall accept the PDP context activation with the UE requested
parameters. Otherwise, the P-GW shall accept the request and adjust (downgrade
or upgrade) the requested UMTS QoS parameters to the values that were
authorized.
## 6.5 QoS parameter mapping Functions at UE for a UE-initiated GPRS PDP
Context
Figure 6.5.1 indicates the entities participating in the generation of the
requested QoS parameters when the UE activates or modifies a PDP Context. The
steps are:
1\. The Application provides the UMTS BS Manager, possibly via the IP BS
Manager and the Translation/Mapping function, with relevant information to
perform step 2 or step 4. (Not subject to standardization within 3GPP).
2\. If needed, information from step 1 is used to access a proper set of UMTS
QoS Parameters. See 3GPP TS 26.114 [29] for Conversational Codec Applications
and 3GPP TS 26.234 [6] for Streaming Codec Applications.
3\. If SDP is available then the SDP Parameters should give guidance for the
UMTS BS Manager (possibly via the IP Manager and the Translation/Mapping
function) ,according to the rules in clause 6.5.1, to set the Maximum Bitrate
UL/DL and the Guaranteed Bitrate UL/DL. Furthermore the Maximum Authorized
Bandwidth UL/DL and Maximum Authorised Traffic Class should be derived
according to the rules in clause 6.5.2.
4\. A set of UMTS QoS Parameters values from step 2 (or directly from step 1)
is possibly merged together with the Maximum Bitrate UL/DL and the Guaranteed
Bitrate UL/DL from step 3. The result should constitute the requested UMTS QoS
Parameters. The UE should check that the requested Guaranteed Bitrate UL/DL or
requested Maximum Bitrate UL/DL (depending on the requested Traffic Class)
does not exceed the Maximum Authorized Bandwidth UL/DL derived in step 3.
Furthermore, if the UE has implemented the mapping rule for Maximum Authorized
Traffic Class, as defined in clause 6.5.2, the UE should check that the
requested Traffic Class does not exceed the Maximum Authorised Traffic Class
derived in step 3.
Figure 6.5.1: Framework for generating requested QoS parameters in the UE
### 6.5.1 SDP to UMTS QoS parameter mapping in UE
If SDP Parameters are available, then before activating or modifying a PDP
Context the UE should check if the SDP Parameters give guidance for setting
the requested UMTS QoS Parameters. The UE should use the mapping rule in table
6.5.1.1 to derive the Maximum and Guaranteed Bitrate DL/UL from the SDP
Parameters.

### 6.5.2 SDP parameters to Authorized UMTS QoS parameters mapping in UE
If the PDP Context is activated or modified the UE should use the mapping
rules in table 6.5.2.1 for all applications using SDP to derive the Maximum
Authorized Bandwidth UL/DL per IP flow or bidirectional combinations of IP
flows.
Table 6.5.2.1 also has a mapping rule for derivation of Maximum Authorized
Traffic Class per IP flow or bidirectional combinations of IP flows which
applies for session initiation and modification.
In future releases this mapping rule may change.
In the case of forking, the various forked responses may have different QoS
requirements for the same IP flows of a media component. When the Authorized
UMTS QoS Parameters are used by the UE, they shall be set equal to the highest
values requested for the IP flows of that media component by any of the active
forked responses. The UE should use the mapping rule in table 6.5.2.1 for each
forked response.

The UE should per ongoing session store the Authorized UMTS QoS parameters per
IP flow or bidirectional combination of IP flows.
Before activating or modifying a PDP context the UE should check that the
requested Guaranteed Bitrate UL/DL (if the Traffic Class is Conversational or
Streaming) or the requested Maximum Bitrate UL/DL (if the Traffic Class is
Interactive or Background) does not exceed the Maximum Authorized Bandwidth
UL/DL per PDP context (calculated according to the rule in table 6.5.2.2). If
the requested Guaranteed Bitrate UL/DL or the requested Maximum Bitrate UL/DL
exceeds the Maximum Authorized Bandwidth UL/DL per PDP context, the UE should
reduce the requested Guaranteed Bitrate UL/DL or the requested Maximum Bitrate
UL/DL to the Maximum Authorized Bandwidth UL/DL per PDP context. Furthermore,
if the rule in table 6.5.2.1 for calculating Traffic Class per IP flow or
bdirectional combination of IP flows is implemented, the UE should check that
the requested UMTS QoS parameter Traffic Class does not exceed the Maximum
Authorized Traffic Class per PDP context (calculated according to the rule in
table 6.5.2.2). If the requested UMTS QoS parameter Traffic Class exceeds the
Maximum Authorized Traffic Class per PDP context, the UE should reduce the
requested UMTS QoS parameter Traffic Class to the Maximum Authorized Traffic
Class per PDP context.

# 7 PCRF addressing
## 7.1 General
The PCRF discovery procedures are needed where more than one PCRF is present
in an operator's network realm. Within such a deployment, an additional
functional element, called DRA, is needed. PCRF discovery procedures include
all the procedures that involve a DRA functional element.
Routing of Diameter messages from a network element towards the right Diameter
realm in a PLMN is based on standard Diameter realm-based routing, as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61] using the UE-NAI domain part. If PLMN is
separated into multiple realms based on PDN information or IP address range
(if applicable); the PDN information available in the Called-Station-Id AVP,
or the UE's Ipv4 address available in the Framed-IP-Address AVP or the UE's
Ipv6 address or prefix provided within the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP may be used
to assist routing PCC message to the appropriate Diameter realm.
The DRA keeps status of the assigned PCRF for a certain UE and IP-CAN session
across all reference points, e.g. Gx, Gxx, S9, Rx and for unsolicited
application reporting, the Sd interfaces.
The DRA shall support the functionality of a proxy agent and a redirect agent
as defined in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. The mode in which it operates (i.e. proxy or
redirect) shall be based on operator's requirements.
Diameter clients of the DRA, i.e. AF, PCEF, BBERF, RCAF and PCRF in roaming
scenarios shall support all procedures required to properly interoperate with
the DRA in both the proxy and redirect modes.
NOTE: The proxy mode includes two variants:
PA1: Proxy agent based on the standard Diameter proxy agent functionality. All
the messages need to go through the DRA.
PA2: Proxy agent based on the standard Diameter proxy agent functionality.
Session establishment messages always go through the DRA. Gx, Gxx and S9
session termination messages always go through the DRA. All other messages
bypass the DRA.
## 7.2 DRA Definition
The DRA (Diameter Routing Agent) is a functional element that ensures that all
Diameter sessions established over the Gx, S9, Gxx, Rx interfaces and for
unsolicited application reporting, the Sd interface for a certain IP-CAN
session reach the same PCRF when multiple and separately addressable PCRFs
have been deployed in a Diameter realm. The DRA also ensures that the NRR
commands over Np interface reach the same PCRF for a certain IP-CAN session.
The DRA is not required in a network that deploys a single PCRF per Diameter
realm.
## 7.3 DRA Procedures
### 7.3.1 General
A DRA implemented as a Diameter Redirect Agent or a Diameter Proxy Agent shall
be compliant to IETF RFC 6733 [61], except when noted otherwise in this
document.
### 7.3.2 DRA Information Storage
The DRA shall maintain PCRF routing information per IP-CAN session or per UE-
NAI, depending on the operator's configuration.
The DRA shall select the same PCRF for all the Diameter sessions established
for the same UE in case 2a.
As there's only one S9 session per UE, the V-DRA/H-DRA shall select the same
V-PCRF/H-PCRF respectively for the same UE in the roaming case.
The DRA has information about the user identity (UE NAI), the UE Ipv4 address
and/or Ipv6 prefix, the APN (if available), the PCEF identity (if available)
and the selected PCRF identity for a certain IP-CAN Session.
NOTE 1: The DRA derives the PCEF identity from the Origin-Host AVP of the CCR
command received from the PCEF.
The DRA finds the correct PCRF by matching the user identity (if available),
IPv4 address or IPv6 address/prefix (if available) and APN (if available)
received in the message from the BBERF/PCEF/AF/TDF/ RCAF/V-PCRF with the
corresponding information stored the DRA.
NOTE 2: If the DRA does not use the IP address to find the PCRF and the user
identity in the IPâ€‘CAN and the application level identity for the user are of
different kinds (e.g. user identity is the IP-CAN is IMSI and application
level identity for the user is SIPURI), the DRA needs to maintain, or have
access to, the mapping between the identities. Such mapping is not subject to
specification within this TS.
NOTE 3: An IPv6 address provided over Rx matches an IPv6 prefix stored in the
DRA binding if the IPv6 address belongs to the IPv6 (sub-)network prefix.
When matching the APNs to each other, the DRA shall apply the procedures in
Annex I.
For the PCRF selection over the Rx reference point, the DRA may additionally
match the IP domain Id received in the message from the AF with the PCEF
identity stored in the DRA to find the correct PCRF.
NOTE 4: In order to correlate the PCEF Identity and the domain identity, the
DRA uses configured mapping between those identities.
For the PCRF selection over the Rx reference point, when the APN related to
the IP-CAN session is dedicated for the purpose of offering services to remote
UEs via a ProSe UE-to-network relay UE, the DRA shall use the UE IPv6 prefix
alone to find the correct PCRF.
The PCRF routing information stored for an IP-CAN session in the DRA shall be
removed after the IP-CAN session is terminated. In case of DRA change (e.g.
inter-operator handover), the information about the IP-CAN session stored in
the old DRA shall be removed.
The PCRF routing information stored per UE in the DRA may be removed when no
more IP-CAN and gateway control sessions are active for the UE.
### 7.3.3 Capabilities Exchange
In addition to the capabilities exchange procedures defined in IETF RFC 6733
[61], the Redirect DRA and Proxy DRA shall advertise the specific applications
it supports (e.g., Gx, Gxx, Rx, Np,S9 and for unsolicited application
reporting, Sd) by including the value of the application identifier in the
Auth-Application-Id AVP and the value of the 3GPP (10415) in the Vendor-Id AVP
of the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP contained in the
Capabilitiesâ€‘Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands.
### 7.3.4 Redirect DRA
#### 7.3.4.1 Redirecting Diameter Requests
A DRA implemented as a Diameter redirect agent shall redirect the received
Diameter request message by carrying out the procedures defined in clause
6.1.7 of IETF RFC 6733 [61]. The Client shall use the value within the
Redirect-Host AVP of the redirect response in order to obtain the PCRF
identity. The DRA may provide the Redirect-Host-Usage AVP in the redirect
response to provide a hint to the Client about how the cached route table
entry created from the Redirect-Host AVP is to be used as described in clause
6.13 of IETF RFC 6733 [61].
The two most revelant redirect host usage scenarios for PCC from IETF RFC 6733
[61]are:
\- If the PCRF routing information is per UE-NAI, the DRA shall set the
Redirect-Host-Usage AVP to ALL_USER. The DRA client may contact the DRA on IP-
CAN session termination.
\- If the PCRF routing information is per IP-CAN session, the DRA shall set
the Redirect-Host-Usage AVP to ALL_SESSION. The DRA client shall contact the
DRA on IP-CAN session termination.
The DRA may also provide the Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVP in the redirect
response to indicate to the Client the lifetime of the cached route table
entry created from the Redirect-Host and Redirect-Host-Usage AVP values as
described in clause 6.14 of IETF RFC 6733 [61].
If the DRA is maintaining PCRF routing information per IP-CAN session, the DRA
shall be aware of Gx and Gxx Diameter termination requests as defined in 3GPP
TS 29.212 [9] in order to detect whether release of DRA bindings is required.
Otherwise the DRA clients shall use cached route table entry created from the
Redirect-Host, Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs to
determine whether DRA interaction is required.
The DRA shall be aware of IP-CAN Session modification requests over Gx which
is to update the Ipv4 address of the UE by the PCEF.
If the client is the AF, the DRA (redirect) does not need to maintain Diameter
sessions and Diameter Base redirect procedures are applicable. Therefore, an
AF should not send an AF session termination request to the DRA.
#### 7.3.4.2 DRA binding removal
If the DRA binding is per IP-CAN session and the IP-CAN session is terminated
or if the DRA binding is per UE and the last IP-CAN session is terminated (eg.
From an indication by the BBERF/PCEF) the Redirect DRA shall remove the
associated DRA binding information and responds with a Diameter redirect
answer message.
### 7.3.5 Proxy DRA
The DRA shall support the functionality of a Diameter proxy agent as defined
in IETF RFC 6733 [61].
When the DRA receives a request from a client, it shall check whether it
already has selected a PCRF for the UE or the UE's IP-CAN session; if it does
have a PCRF already selected for that UE or UE's IP-CAN session, it shall
proxy the request to the corresponding PCRF. If the request is an IP-CAN
session termination or gateway control session termination, the DRA shall
check whether PCRF routing information shall be removed as specified in clause
7.3.3. If the DRA does not have a PCRF already selected, it shall follow one
of the procedures below:
\- If the request is an IP-CAN session establishment or gateway control
session establishment, it shall select a PCRF to handle all sessions for that
UE or UE's IP-CAN session. It shall then proxy the request to the selected
PCRF.
\- Otherwise, if the request is not an IP-CAN session establishment or gateway
control session establishment, it shall reject the request by returning a
DIAMETER_UNABLE_TO_COMPLY error code.
If a DRA is deployed in a PCRF's realm, clients of the DRA shall send the
first request of a session to the DRA handling the PCRF's realm. Clients of
the DRA shall as well send IP-CAN session termination and gateway control
termination requests to the DRA. A client of the DRA shall be capable of
sending every message of a session to the DRA. A client of the DRA may be
configured to bypass the DRA on session modification messages and AF session
termination messages by sending these types of messages directly to the PCRF.
### 7.3.6 PCRF selection by BBERF/PCEF (non-roaming case)
The PCEF (e.g. P-GW) or BBERF (e.g. Non-3GPP Access, S-GW) shall provide the
DRA of the PCRF realm with identity parameters upon the first interaction
between the access entity and the PCRF realm.
If the redirect agent is used for DRA, the DRA shall use the redirecting
requests procedure as specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61], and include the PCRF
identity in the Redirect-Host AVP in the Diameter reply sent to the PCEF or
the BBERF.
If proxy agent is used for DRA, the DRA should use the proxy procedure as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. For PA2 solution (described in clause 7.1),
only session establishment, session modification with the UE's Ipv4 address
updated and session termination messages shall be sent through the DRA.
The identity parameters from the PCEF or BBERF may comprise the UE's Ipv4
address in the Framed-IP-Address AVP and/or the UE's Ipv6 prefix in the
Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP, PDN information in the Called-Station-Id AVP and user
identity in the Subscription-Id AVP.
### 7.3.7 PCRF selection by AF
If the AF has the realm identification (i.e. FQDN from a UE NAI) and is
located in the HPLMN, the AF sends the user identity in the Subscription-Id
AVP and PDN information (i.e. APN) if available in the Called-Station-Id AVP
in a Diameter request to the DRA which acts as a Diameter agent.
For an AF serving mission critical communication services (e.g. MCPTT), the AF
shall derive the realm of the PCRF based on the IP address and, based on the
PLMN ID, construct the Diameter destination realm and use that destination
realm in the initial request to address the DRA.
NOTE 1: An AF serving mission critical communication services as defined in
3GPP TS 23.280 [64] can be independent from a PLMN and is not guaranteed to
have any realm identification.
If the AF does not have proper knowledge about the user identity and the AF is
located in the HPLMN, the AF may use pre-configured information to find the
DRA.
NOTE 1A: How the AF which is a third party or non-IMS application server finds
the DRA if it does not have the proper knowledge about the user identity is
out of scope of this specification.
The AF shall provide the DRA of the PCRF realm with identity parameters upon
the first interaction between the AF and the PCRF realm.
If redirect agent is used for DRA, the DRA shall use the redirecting requests
procedure as specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61], and include the PCRF identity in
the Redirect-Host AVP in the Diameter reply sent to the AF.
If proxy agent is used for DRA, the DRA should use the proxy procedure as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. For PA2 solution (described in clause 7.1),
only AF session establishment messages shall be sent through the DRA.
The parameters from the AF may comprise the UE IP address in either the
Framed-IP-Address AVP or the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP, PDN information in the
Called-Station-Id AVP, user identity in the Subscription-Id AVP and domain
Identity in the IP-Domain-Id AVP (3GPP TS 23.203 [2]).
NOTE 2: In case the user identity in the IPâ€‘CAN and the application level
identity for the user are of different kinds (e.g. user identity is the IP-CAN
is IMSI and application level identity for the user is SIPURI), the DRA needs
to maintain, or have access to, the mapping between the identities. Such
mapping is not subject to specification within this TS.
### 7.3.8 PCRF selection in a roaming scenario
In the roaming case, a V-DRA is needed in the visited PLMN when there are more
than one PCRFs per realm. The V-DRA will ensure that all the related Diameter
sessions for a UE are handled by the same V-PCRF.
The BBERF in the visited access and home routed cases, the PCEF in the case of
visited access and the AF when located in the visited PLMN may use pre-
configured information (e.g. based on PDN) to find the V-DRA, and then find
theV-PCRF. Other possible options are Dynamic peer discovery, or DNS-based.
The V-PCRF can find the H-DRA based on the UE NAI, and then find the H-PCRF by
the H-DRA.
The V-PCRF shall provide the H-DRA of the H-PCRF realm with identity
parameters upon the first interaction between the V-PCRF and the H-PCRF realm.
If redirect agent is used for H-DRA, the H-DRA shall use the redirecting
requests procedure as specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61], and include the H-PCRF
identity in the Redirect-Host AVP in the Diameter reply sent to the V-PCRF.
If proxy agent is used for H-DRA, the H-DRA should use the proxy procedure as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. For PA2 solution (described in clause 7.1),
only session establishment, session modification with the UE's Ipv4 address
updated and, only for the Gx, Gxx and S9 interfaces, termination messages
shall be sent through the H-DRA.
The identity parameters from the V-PCRF may comprise the same parameters sent
by the PCEF or the BBERF to the V-PCRF, i.e. the user identity (UE NAI), APN,
the UE's Ipv4 address and/or Ipv6 prefix (3GPP TS 23.203 [2]).
If redirect agent or PA2 is used for H-DRA, and the V-PCRF receives
establishment message from the AF in the VPLMN, the V-PCRF may send the
message to the H-PCRF directly (e.g. based on the stored information provided
by H-DRA during the IP-CAN session establishment).
### 7.3.9 PCRF selection by TDF for unsolicited application reporting
The TDF uses pre-configured information to find the DRA.
The TDF shall provide the DRA of the PCRF realm with identity parameters upon
the first interaction between the TDF and the PCRF realm.
If redirect agent is used for DRA, the DRA shall use the redirecting requests
procedure as specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61], and include the PCRF identity in
the Redirect-Host AVP in the Diameter reply sent to the TDF.
If proxy agent is used for DRA, the DRA should use the proxy procedure as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. For PA2 solution (described in subclause
7.1), only TDF session establishment messages shall be sent through the DRA.
The parameters from the TDF may comprise the UE IP address in either the
Framed-IP-Address AVP or the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP and PDN information in the
Called-Station-ID AVP.
NOTE: The TDF located in the HPLMN finds the H-PCRF for the roaming UE with
home routed access case. The TDF located in the VPLMN finds the V-PCRF for the
roaming UE with visited access case.
### 7.3.10 PCRF selection by RCAF
For initial Non-Aggregated RUCI reporting, the RCAF shall provide the identity
parameters to the DRA of the PCRF realm.
The identity parameters from the RCAF may comprise PDN information in the
Called-Station-Id AVP and user identity in the Subscription-Id AVP.
In the roaming with home-routed access case, the RCAF can find the H-DRA based
on the IMSI, and then find the H-PCRF by the H-DRA.The RCAF shall provide the
H-DRA of the H-PCRF realm with identity parameters upon the first interaction
between the RCAF and the H-PCRF realm.
In the roaming with visited case, the RCAF shall provide the V-DRA of the
V-PCRF realm with identity parameters upon the first interaction between the
RCAF and the V-PCRF realm.
If the redirect agent is used for DRA, the DRA shall use the redirecting
requests procedure as specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61], and include the PCRF
identity in the Redirect-Host AVP in the Diameter reply sent to the RCAF.
If proxy agent is used for DRA, the DRA should use the proxy procedure as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61].
For subsequent non-aggregated or aggregated RUCI reporting, the RCAF shall
include the PCRF identity within the Destination-Host AVP for direct PCRF
selection. The PCRF identity shall be responded by the PCRF within the PCRF-
Address AVP in the initial non-aggregated RUCI reporting, for identifying the
same destination PCRF in the subsequent non-aggregated or aggregated RUCI
reporting.

### 7.4.1 Proxy DRA
#### 7.4.1.1 Establishment of Diameter Sessions
##### 7.4.1.1.1 Non-roaming cases
Establishment of Diameter sessions may occur at any of the following cases:
\- Gateway control establishment
\- IP-CAN session establishment
\- AF session establishment
\- For unsolicited application reporting, TDF session establishment
Figure 7.4.1.1.1.1: Establishment of Diameter sessions using DRA (proxy)
1\. A Client receives an external trigger (e.g. IP-CAN session establishment
request) that requires the establishment of a Diameter session with a PCRF.
2\. A Diameter Request (e.g. a Diameter CCR sent by PGW to indicate
establishment of an IP-CAN session as defined in clauses 4.5.1, 4a.5.1 of 3GPP
TS 29.212 [9]) is sent by the Client and received by a DRA (proxy).
3\. The DRA (proxy) stores the user information (e.g. UE-NAI) and checks
whether an active DRA binding exists. If not, the DRA creates a dynamic DRA
binding (assignment of a PCRF node per UE or per IP-CAN session).
NOTE 1: When the AF establishes an Rx session or TDF establishes a TDF session
with the DRA, there is already a DRA binding active.
4\. The DRA (proxy) proxies the Diameter Request to the target PCRF. The
proxied Diameter Request maintains the same Session-Id AVP value.
5\. PCRF-1 returns a Diameter Answer as defined in clauses 4.5, 4a.5 of 3GPP
TS 29.212 [9] to the DRA (proxy).
6\. DRA (proxy) proxies the Diameter Answer to the Client. The proxied
Diameter Answer maintains the same Session-Id AVP value.
7\. If PA2 option is implemented, the Client uses the Origin-Host AVP value
providedin the Diameter Answer of step 6. This value is the identity of the
target PCRF. The client populates the Destination-Host AVP with this address
and sends any subsequent Diameter messages directly to this PCRF bypassing the
DRA (proxy).

V-PCRF and received by a H-DRA (proxy) in the home PLMN.
3\. The H-DRA (proxy) stores the user information (e.g. UE-NAI) and checks
whether an active DRA binding exists. If not, the H-DRA creates a dynamic DRA
binding (assignment of a PCRF node per UE or per IP-CAN session).
4\. The H-DRA (proxy) proxies the Diameter Request to the target PCRF in the
home PLMN. The proxied Diameter Request maintains the same Session-Id AVP
value.
5\. H-PCRF-1 returns a Diameter Answer to the H-DRA (proxy).
6\. H-DRA (proxy) proxies the Diameter Answer to the V-PCRF. The proxied
Diameter Answer maintains the same Session-Id AVP value.
7\. If PA2 option is implemented, the V-PCRF uses the Origin-Host AVP value
provided in the Diameter Answer of step 6. This value is the identity of the
target H-PCRF. The V-PCRF populates the Destination-Host AVP with this address
and sends any subsequent Diameter messages directly to this H-PCRF bypassing
the H-DRA.

is initiated by the UE or PCRF) that requires the sending of a Diameter
Termination Request.
2\. A Diameter Termination Request (e.g., a Diameter CCR sent by PGW to
indicate termination of an IP-CAN session) as defined in clauses 4.5, 4a.5 of
3GPP TS 29.212 [9]) is sent by the Client to the DRA (proxy). The message uses
the same Session-Id AVP value of the active Diameter session established
between the Client and PCRF-1.
3\. The DRA (proxy) verifies that there is an active DRA binding for the IP-
CAN session based on the Session-Id AVP in the request.

#### 7.4.2.1 Establishment of Diameter Sessions
##### 7.4.2.1.1 Non-roaming cases
Establishment of Diameter sessions may occur at the following cases:
\- Gateway control session establishment
\- IP-CAN session establishment

\- For unsolicited application reporting, TDF session establishment
The DRA client (AF/BBERF/PCEF/TDF) shall follow the procedure below if an
appropriate cached route table entry created from previous DRA (redirect)
interactions does not exist. Cached route table entries are created from the
Redirect-Host, Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs as
described in sections 6.12, 6.13 and 6.14 of IETF RFC 6733 [61].
Figure 7.4.2.1.1.1: Establishment of Diameter session through DRA (redirect)
1\. A Client receives an external trigger (e.g., IP-CAN session establishment
request) that requires the establishment of a Diameter session with a PCRF.
2\. A Diameter Establishment request (e.g., a Diameter CCR sent by PGW to
indicate establishment of an IP-CAN session as defined in clauses 4.5.1,
4a.5.1 of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9]) with user information (e.g., UE-NAI) is sent by
the Client and received by the DRA (redirect).
3\. The DRA (redirect) stores the user information (e.g., UE-NAI) and checks
whether an active DRA binding exists. If not the DRA creates a dynamic DRA
binding (assignment of a PCRF node per UE or per IP-CAN session); if the DRA
(redirect) find there has been a DRA binding for the user, the DRA shall
select the PCRF from the binding for the client.
4\. The DRA (redirect) sends a Diameter Answer indicating redirection as
defined in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. The target PCRF identity is included in the
Redirect-Host AVP.

Establishment of Diameter sessions may occur at the following cases:
\- S9 session 142vailability142
\- AF session establishment
The DRA client (AF/BBERF/PCEF) shall follow the procedure below if an
appropriate cached route table entry created from previous DRA (redirect)
interactions does not exist. Cached route table entries are created from the
Redirect-Host, Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs as
described in clause 6.12, 6.13 and 6.14 of IETF RFC 6733 [61].
Figure 7.4.2.1.2.1: Establishment of Diameter session through DRA (redirect)
-- Roaming scenario

establishment request) that requires the establishment of a Diameter session
with an H-PCRF over the S9 reference point.
2\. A Rx/S9 Diameter Establishment Request with user information (e.g., UE-
NAI) is sent by the V-PCRF and received by the H-DRA (redirect) in the home
PLMN.
3\. The H-DRA (redirect) stores the user information (e.g., UE-NAI) and checks
whether an active DRA binding exists. If not the H-DRA creates a dynamic DRA
binding (assignment of a PCRF node per UE); if the DRA (redirect) find there
has been a DRA binding for the user, the DRA shall select the PCRF from the
binding for the client.
4\. The H-DRA (redirect) sends a Diameter Answer indicating redirection as
defined in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. The target PCRF identity is included in the
Redirect-Host AVP.
5\. The V-PCRF re-sends the Rx/S9 Diameter Establishment Request of step 2 to
the target H-PCRF.
6\. H-PCRF-1 returns a corresponding Diameter Answer to the V-PCRF.
NOTE: The V-PCRF may proxy the Rx Diameter Establishment Request to the H-PCRF
directly (e.g. based on the stored information provided by H-DRA during the S9
Diameter session establishment).
#### 7.4.2.2 Modification of Diameter sessions
The PCEF shall send the Diameter session modification message to the DRA to
update the DRA binding information only if the UE's address(es) is updated and
the DRA (redirect) is maintaining PCRF routing information per IP-CAN session.
For visited access case, the V-PCRF shall send the Diameter session
modification message to the H-DRA to update the DRA binding information only
if the UE's address(es) is updated. The detailed procedure is similar to the
Establishment of Diameter sessions, which is described in the clause 7.4.2.1.
#### 7.4.2.3 Termination of Diameter Sessions
##### 7.4.2.3.1 Non-roaming cases
Termination of Diameter sessions that impact the DRA binding occur at the
following cases:
\- Gateway control session termination
\- IP-CAN session termination
The DRA client (BBERF/PCEF) shall follow the procedure below if the DRA
(redirect) is maintaining PCRF routing information per IP-CAN session or an
appropriate cached route table entry created from previous DRA (redirect)
interactions does not exist. Cached route table entries are created from the
Redirect-Host, Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs as
described in clause 6.12, 6.13 and 6.14 of IETF RFC 6733 [61].

1\. Client receives an external trigger (e.g. an IP-CAN session termination is
initiated by the UE or PCRF) that triggers the client to terminate Diameter
session with server (i.e. PCRF)
2 A Diameter Termination Request (e.g., as defined in clauses 4.5.7 (Gx) and
4a.5.3 (Gxx) of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9]) is sent by the Client to the DRA
(redirect).
3\. A Diameter Termination Request (e.g., as defined in clauses 4.5.7 (Gx) and
4a.5.3 (Gxx) of 3GPP TS 29.212 [9]) is sent by the Client to PRCF-1. The
message uses the same Session-Id AVP value of the active Diameter session
established between the Client and PCRF-1.
NOTE: Steps 2, 3 may be carried out in parallel. Otherwise, the client after
step2 may need to wait for the redirect answer before sending the Diameter
termination request to the PCRF.
4\. DRA (redirect) verifies that there is an active DRA binding for the IP-CAN
session based on the Session-Id AVP and marks the Diameter session terminated.
If the DRA binding is per IP-CAN session and all the Diameter sessions (i.e.
Gx session or Gxx session) of that IP-CAN session are terminated or if the DRA
binding is per UE and all the Diameter sessions (i.e. Gx session or Gxx
session) of that UE are terminated the DRA removes the DRA binding.
5 DRA (redirect) acknowledges termination of the session by sending a Diameter
redirect answer to the client.
6 PCRF-1 acknowledges termination of session. PCRF-1 sends a Diameter Answer
(e.g., as defined in clauses 4.5.7 (Gx) and 4a.5.3 (Gxx) of 3GPP TS 29.212
[9]) to the Client.
NOTE: Figure 7.4.2.3.1.1 is also applicable when the BBERF/PCEF in the VPLMN
terminates the Diameter sessions through the V-DRA.

The DRA client (AF/BBERF/PCEF) shall follow the procedure below) if the DRA
(redirect) is maintaining PCRF routing information per IP-CAN session or an
appropriate cached route table entry created from previous DRA (redirect)
interactions does not exist. Cached route table entries are created from the
Redirect-Host, Redirect-Host-Usage and Redirect-Max-Cache-Time AVPs as
described in clause 6.12, 6.13 and 6.14 of IETF RFC 6733 [61].

2 A Diameter Termination Request is sent by the V-PCRF and received by the
H-DRA (redirect) in the home PLMN.
3\. A Diameter Termination Request is sent by the V-PCRF to H-PRCF-1. The
message uses the same Session-Id AVP value of the active Diameter session
established between theV-PCRF and H-PCRF-1.
NOTE: Steps 2, 3 may be carried out in parallel. Otherwise, the V-PCRF after
step2 may need to wait for the redirect answer before sending the Diameter
termination request to the H-PCRF
4\. H-DRA (redirect) verifies that there is an active DRA binding for the IP-
CAN session based on the Session-Id AVP and marks the Diameter session
terminated. If all the Diameter sessions (i.e. S9 session, Gxx session, Gx
session) of that UE are terminated the H-DRA removes the DRA binding.
5 H-DRA (redirect) acknowledges termination of the session by sending a
Diameter redirect answer to the V-PCRF.
6 H-PCRF-1 acknowledges termination of the session by sending a Diameter
answer to the V-PCRF.
NOTE: Rx Diameter termination messages are not required to be sent to H-DRA
(redirect) since such messages do not affect the DRA binding
# 8 Diameter race condition handling
## 8.1 Overview
Certain Diameter PCC applications (Gx, Gxx, Sd, S9) allow the server (PCRF for
Gx, Gxx, Sd, H-PCRF for S9) to update a session in two ways: unsolicited and
solicited. The PCRF can push policy decisions and provision event triggers in
an unsolicited fashion using an RAR. It can also install policy decisions in a
solicited manner by responding to a CCR sent by the client (BBERF for Gxx,
PCEF for Gx, TDF for Sd, V-PCRF for S9).
The client and the server can initiate transactions that modify the state of
the session independently (e.g. CCR from the client and RAR from the server)
and potentially concurrently. Additionally, there may be Diameter agents in
between the client and server (e.g. DRA or in general Diameter relays/proxies)
that could cause messages to be delivered out of order. This can lead to race
conditions that may result in the wrong information maintained by the client
and/or server for a session.
Note that race conditions occur in different ways based on the application.
Also, their impact is specific to the application. For example, even though Gx
is based on DCCA (RFC 4006), Gx is much more vulnerable to race conditions as
Gx allows sessions to be updated based on RARs and CCAs whereas DCCA only
allows the server to update the session based on a CCA. The RAR is merely used
to solicit the client to send a CCR.
## 8.2 Procedures for Gx, Gxx, Sd and S9
This clause describes the optional procedures for handling Diameter race
conditions in a deterministic manner for the following interfaces: Gx, Gxx, Sd
and S9. These procedures apply to the PCEF (Gx), BBERF (Gxx), TDF (Sd) and
PCRF (Gx, Gxx, Sd and S9).
In this clause, the terms "client" and "server" are relative to the session
context. As an example, for the Gx interface, the client is the PCEF and the
server is the PCRF. The term "node" can refer to either a client or a server.
The term "transaction" refers to a Diameter request and its associated answer.
The term "ongoing transaction" refers to a transaction that has an outstanding
answer.
A node that supports the procedures defined in this clause and is configured
to comply with them, shall advertise such support by setting the corresponding
PendingTransaction feature bit in the Supported-Features AVP during session
establishment as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9] for Gx, Gxx and Sd and 3GPP TS
29.215 [22] for S9.
On receipt of a Diameter request for an existing Diameter session, the
recipient Diameter node shall check if it has an ongoing transaction on that
session:
1\. If there are no ongoing transactions on the session, the node shall
process the incoming request normally.
2\. If there is an ongoing transaction on the session and optionally, if the
recipient node cannot determine that the incoming request can be safely
handled without creating a state mismatch:
a. The client shall reject the incoming request with a Diameter experimental
result code of DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION as defined in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9].
b. The server shall either reject the incoming request with a Diameter
experimental result code of DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION or shall wait for one
of the following conditions to occur:
i. The ongoing transaction completes. In this case, the session is updated at
the server based on the completion of the ongoing transaction and afterwards,
the incoming request (e.g. CCR) is processed normally based on the updated
session state.
ii. The waiting period has exceeded its allotted time. In this case, the
server shall reject the incoming request with a Diameter experimental result
code of DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION.
3\. On receipt of a DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION result code, a client shall
retry the request. On the other hand, if a server had rejected a request from
the client with a DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION, the server should not retry
the failed request until it receives the re-attempted request from the client.
This is to avoid having both the client and server concurrently retry their
requests. In all other cases, if the session on the client still needs to be
updated, the server shall retry the request.
4\. Nodes should limit the number of times they re-attempt the same request
due to receipt of a DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION.
5\. The only exception to the rules above is a session termination request
(e.g. CCR with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to TERMINATION_REQUEST) or a request
for session release (e.g. RAR with Session-Release-Cause AVP). In both cases,
the request should be handled as follows:
a. When receiving a request for a session release that requires new
transactions to be initiated, a client shall acknowledge the request
immediately (e.g. a RAR command with Session-Release-Cause AVP shall be
acknowledged with a RAA command). The client shall wait for the current
transaction to complete (either by the server acknowledgeing the request or
rejecting it with DIAMETER_PENDING_TRANSACTION) before completing the session
termination procedure (e.g. before sending the CCR command with the CC-
Request-Type set to TERMINATION_REQUEST).
> NOTE: The client needs to wait for the outcome of the session modification
> to determine if the session termination procedure will be used to report
> information that could not be reported as part of the session modification
> procedure.
b. When receiving a session termination request the server shall handle it
immediately.

# B.2 IMS Session Establishment
## B.2.1 Provisioning of service information at Originating P-CSCF and PCRF
This clause covers the PCC procedures at the originating P-CSCF and PCRF at
IMS session establishment.

13\. If step 11 occurs, the P-CSCF forwards the access network information as
the network provided location information when a suitable SIP message is
received.
Optionally, the provisioning of service information may be derived already
from the SDP offer to enable that a possible rejection of the service
information by the PCRF is obtained by the P-CSCF in time to reject the
service with appropriate SIP signalling, to allow the P-CSCF to request
network provided location information for inclusion in the SDP offer, to
support authentication of roaming users in deployments with no IMS-level
roaming interfaces or to support PSAP callback functionality for anonymous IMS
emergency sessions. This is described in figure B.2.1.2.

forwards the access network information received in step 7 in a Diameter RAR.
9\. If step 8 occurs, the P-CSCF acknowledges the receipt of Diameter RAR.
10a. If step 8 occurs, and if the P-CSCF requires the access network
information for inclusion in the SDP offer, the P-CSCF forwards the SDP offer
and adds the access network information as the network provided location
information to the corresponding SIP message.
10b. If step 8 occurs, and if the P-CSCF does not require the access network
information for inclusion in the SDP offer, the P-CSCF forwards the access
network information as the network provided location information in a suitable
SIP message. This step normally occurs only after step 17.
11\. The P-CSCF receives the negotiated SDP parameters from the terminating
side within a SDP answer in SIP signalling.

service with appropriate SIP signalling or to enable pre-authorization for a
UE terminated IMS session establishment with UE initiated resource
reservation. This is described in figure B.2.2.2.
Figure B.2.2.2: PCC Procedures for IMS Session Establishment at terminating

Optionally, the provisioning of service information may be derived already
from the SDP offer to enable that a possible rejection of the service
information by the PCRF is obtained by the P-CSCF in time to reject the
service with appropriate SIP signalling or to enable pre-authorization for a
UE terminated IMS session establishment with UE initiated resource
reservation. This is described in figure B.3.1.2.
Figure B.3.1.2: Provisioning of service information derived from SDP offer and
answer at IMS session modification
1\. The P-CSCF receives an SDP offer in SIP signalling for an exiting SIP
dialogue.
2\. The P-CSCF identifies the relevant changes in the SDP and extracts the
corresponding service information.
3\. The P-CSCF forwards the derived service information to the PCRF by sending

may imply provisioning of PCC/QoS rules and authorized QoS. The PCRF may need
to enable or disable IP Flows (see clauses B.3.2 and B.3.3, respectively) due
to the updated service information.
13\. If the P-CSCF did not request access network information in step 3 or 10,
the P-CSCF forwards the SDP answer in SIP signalling. This step is executed in
parallel with step 12.
14\. If the P-CSCF requested access network information in step 3 or 10, the
PCRF forwards the access network information received in step 12 in a Diameter
RAR.
15\. If step 14 occurs, the P-CSCF acknowledges the receipt of Diameter RAR.
16\. If step 14 occurs, the P-CSCF forwards the SDP answer and adds the access
network information as the network provided location information to the
corresponding SIP message.
## B.3.2 Enabling of IP Flows
The PCRF makes a final decision to enable the allocated QoS resource for the
authorized IP flows of the media component (s) if the QoS resources are not
enabled at the time they are authorized by the PCRF or if the media IP flow(s)
previously placed on hold are resumed, i.e. the media IP flow(s) of the media
component that was placed on hold at the time of the resource authorization or
at a later stage is reactivated (with SDP direction sendrecv, sendonly,
recvonly or none direction).
The Enabling of IP Flows procedure is triggered by the P-CSCF receiving any
2xx success response to an INVITE request or a 2xx success response to an
UPDATE request within a confirmed dialogue that is not embedded as part of
another INVITE Transaction (in both cases a 200 OK response is usually
received). When receiving such responses, the PCRF shall take the SDP
direction attribute in the latest received SDP (either within the 2xx success
or a previous SIP message) into account when deciding, which gates shall be
opened:
\- For a unidirectional SDP media component, IP flows in the opposite
direction shall not be enabled.
\- For an inactive SDP media component, no IP flows shall be enabled.
Figure B.3.2.1 is applicable to the Mobile Originating (MO) side and the
Mobile Terminating (MT) side.
Figure B.3.2.1: Enabling of IP Flows
1\. The P-CSCF receives the 2xx Success message complying with the conditions
specified in the paragraphs above.
2\. The P-CSCF sends a Diameter AAR message to the PCRF, requesting that gates
shall be opened.
3\. The PCRF approves the enabling of IP flows and PCRF updates flow status of
affected PCC rules.
4 The PCRF sends a Diameter AAA to the P-CSCF.
5 The P-CSCF forwards the 2xx Success message.
6\. The PCRF executes interactions according to figure 4.3.1.1.1. This step
implies opening the 'gates' by updating the flow status of PCC rules.
## B.3.3 Disabling of IP Flows
The "Disabling of IP Flows" procedure is used when media IP flow(s) of a
session are put on hold (e.g. in case of a media re-negotiation or call hold).
Media is placed on hold as specified in RFC 3264 [12]. Media modified to
become inactive (SDP direction attribute) shall also be considered to be put
on hold.
If a bidirectional media component is placed on hold by making it
unidirectional, the IP flows shall only be disabled in the deactivated
direction. If a media component is placed on hold by making it inactive, the
IP flows shall be disabled in both directions.
Figure B.3.3.1 presents the "Disabling of IP Flows" procedure at media on hold
for both the Mobile Originating (MO) side and the Mobile Terminating (MT)
side.
Figure B.3.3.1: Disabling of IP Flows at Media on Hold
1\. The P-CSCF receives an SDP answer putting media on hold within a SIP
message. (NOTE)
2\. The P-CSCF sends a Diameter AAR request to the PCRF, requesting that gates
shall be closed.
3\. The PCRF updates flow status of affected PCC rules for the media on hold.
4\. The PCRF sends a Diameter AAA message back to the P-CSCF.
5\. The P-CSCF forwards the SDP answer putting media on hold within a SIP
message.
6\. The PCRF executes interactions according to figure 4.3.1.1.1. This step
implies closing the relevant media IP flow gate(s), leaving the possible
related RTCP gate(s) open to keep the connection alive.
NOTE: This procedure occurs whenever a bidirectional media is made
unidirectional or when a media is changed to inactive.
## B.3.4 Media Component Removal
Figure B.3.4.1 presents the flows of PCC procedures at the removal of media
component(s) from an IMS session which is not being released for both the
Mobile Originating (MO) side and the Mobile Terminating (MT) side.
Figure B.3.4.1: Revoke authorization for IP resources at media component
removal\ for both Mobile Originating (MO) and Mobile Terminating (MT) side

information.
3\. The PCRF stores the Session information and identifies the affected IP-CAN
Session(s).
4\. The PCRF sends a Diameter AAA message back to the P-CSCF.
5\. The P-CSCF forwards the SDP answer removing a media component.
6\. The PCRF makes a decision on what PCC/QoS rules need to be modified or

## B.4.1 Mobile initiated session release / Network initiated session release
Figure B.4.1.1 presents the mobile or network initiated IMS session release
without access network information retrieval. The session release may be
signalled by a SIP BYE message, or any SIP 3xx redirect response, or any 4xx,
5xx, or 6xx SIP final error response to an initial INVITE request. If any 4xx,
5xx, or 6xx SIP final error response to Re-INVITE or UPDATE request just
terminates the transaction, then the session is not released, otherwise if the
error response terminates the dialog then the session is released.
Figures B.4.1.2 and B.4.1.3 presents the network initiated and the mobile
initiated IMS session release with access network information retrieval,
respectively.

information obtained in step 2 as the network provided location information.
## B.4.2 IP-CAN Bearer Release/Loss
An IP-CAN Bearer Release or Loss event may affect all IP-Flows within an IMS
Session. Flows in clause 4.3.2.2.1 (AF located in the HPLMN) or 4.3.2.2.2 (AF
located in the VPLMN) apply for case 1. Flows in clause 4.4.2.1.1 (Home Routed
case) or 4.4.2.2.1 (Visited Access case) apply for case 2a and case 2b.
## B.5 P-CSCF Restoration
This clause is applicable if P-CSCF Restoration is to be performed.
Figure B.5.1: P-CSCF Restoration
1\. The P-CSCF sends an AAR command to PCRF to initiate a P-CSCF Restoration
procedure, as defined in the 3GPP TS 23.380 [35]. The AAR command contains a
Rx-Request-Type AVP with value set to PCSCF_RESTORATION and can contain the IP
address of the UE within Framed-IP-Address AVP (if available) or the Framed-
Ipv6-Prefix AVP (if available), IMSI (if available) within the Subscription-Id
AVP, the IMS APN (if available) within the Called-Station-Id AVP and/or the IP
address domain (if available) within the IP-Domain-Id AVP.
For the non-roaming case and the home routed case, the H-PCRF receives the AAR
command, i.e. step 1 is executed.
1a. For the roaming case with visited access, when the P-CSCF is located in
the VPLMN, step 1 is executed with the exception that the V-PCRF receives the
AAR command and responds with the AAA command
2\. When receiving the AAR command for P-CSCF Restoration from the P-CSCF, the
PCRF acknowledges the AAR by sending an AAA command to the P-CSCF.
For the non-roaming case and the home routed case, the H-PCRF sends an AAA
command to the P-CSCF, i.e. step 2 is executed.
2a. For the roaming case with visited access, when the P-CSCF is located in
the VPLMN, step 2 is executed with the exception that the V-PCRF sends an AAA
command to the P-CSCF.
> For the roaming case with local breakout when the P-CSCF is located in the
> HPLMN, when the H-PCRF receives the AAR command from the P-CSCF, the H-PCRF
> sends an RAR command to the V-PCRF, i.e. step 1b is executed.
3\. When receiving the AAR command for P-CSCF Restoration, the PCRF finds the
corresponding IP-CAN session according to the received information within the
AAR command, and sends an RAR command for the corresponding IP-CAN session
(IMS PDN connection) to the PCEF for P-CSCF Restoration. The RAR contains a
PCSCF-Restoration-Indication AVP with value set to PCSCF_RESTORATION.
For the non-roaming case and the home routed case, when receiving the AAR
command from the P-CSCF, the H-PCRF sends the RAR command to the PCEF, i.e.
step 3 is executed.
3a, For the roaming case with visited access, when the P-CSCF is located in
the VPLMN, step 3 is executed with the exception that when receiving the AAR
command from the P-CSCF, the V-PCRF sends the RAR command to the PCEF.
For the roaming case with local breakout when the P-CSCF is located in the
HPLMN, when receiving the RAR command from the H-PCRF, the V-PCRF sends an RAR
command to the PCEF, i.e. step 2a is executed.
4\. When receiving the RAR command for P-CSCF Restoration, the PCEF
acknowledges the RAR by sending an RAA command to the PCRF and performs the
subsequent P-CSCF Restoration procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.380 [35].
NOTE 1: If the IMS PDN disconnection is performed for P-CSCF Restoration, the
PCEF sends a CCR command to the PCRF to terminate the corresponding Gx
session.
For the non-roaming case and the home routed case, when receiving the RAR
command from the H-PCRF, the PCEF acknowledges this message by sending an RAA
command to the H-PCRF, i.e. step 4 is executed.
4a. For the roaming case with visited access, when the P-CSCF is located in
the VPLMN, step 4 is executed with the exception that when receiving the RAR
command from the V-PCRF, the PCEF acknowledges this message by sending an RAA
command to the V-PCRF.
NOTE 2: This P-CSCF Restoration procedure is applicable to the cases that both
the P-CSCF and the PCEF are located in the same PLMN.
###### ## Annex C (normative): NAT Related Procedures
# C.1 Support for media traversal of NATs using ICE
The IMS calls out procedures for NAT traversal for media and 173vailabili
within IMS. One of the methods supported by IMS for media traversal of NATs is
a UE controlled NAT traversal solution based on the IETF Interactive
Connectivity Establishment (ICE) protocol, IETF RFC 5245 [15]. When a UE uses
the ICE protocol for media traversal of NATs, additional enhancements to the
existing PCC procedures are necessary to allow for proper ICE operation.
This annex presents a set of rules that PCC network elements use to build flow
descriptors, identify the proper UE IP addresses used by the PCRF for session
and bearer binding, and gating control when the ICE procedures are invoked by
the UE.
In order for the ICE procedures to work a static, preconfigured PCC rule needs
to be in place at the PCEF which allows the UE to perform STUN binding
requests prior to offering or answering an SDP.
NOTE 1: Predefined PCC rules can be created to allow the UE to communicate
with the STUN relay much in the same way the UE is allowed to communicate with
the IMS network for session management.
NOTE 2: Given that a STUN relay is a forwarding server under the direction of
the UE, necessary precaution needs to be taken by the operator in how it
chooses to craft these rules. It is recommended that such predefined rules
only guarantee the minimal amount of bandwidth necessary to accomplish the
necessary UE to STUN relay communication. Such an approach helps reduce the
resources required to support NAT traversal mechanisms. Finally, such an
approach allows the preconfigured rule to be over-ridden by dynamic rules
which allow for the necessary bandwidth needed by the session.
NOTE 3: The dynamic PCC rule will need to differentiate between different
media traffic between UE and STUN relay (e.g. voice vs. video), which can be
identified by the different ports assigned by the residential NAT. Session
bindings need to take into account that the relevant terminal IP address may
be contained within the ICE candidates contained in the session description,
rather than in the normal media description.
NOTE 4: It is assumed that the NAT device is located between the UE and the
PCEF. NAT traversal outside of IMS in FBI services is considered FFS in the
current 3GPP stage 2 specifications.
NOTE 5: When a NAT device is located between the UE and the PCEF, it is
assumed that the IP CAN session signalling will contain the IP address
assigned by the residential NAT, rather than the UE IP address.
NOTE 6: It is assumed that NAT devices that assign multiple IP addresses for
the UE are outside the scope of release 7.
NOTE 7: In this release, only one IP address per subscription is supported by
session binding at the PCRF. Multiple Ues behind a NAT will use the same IP
CAN session and IP address.
# C.2 P-CSCF procedures
## C.2.1 General
The procedures in clause C.2 are only invoked in the case where the local UE
(uplink SDP) has utilized the ICE protocol for media traversal of NATs. The
P-CSCF can determine this by inspecting the UE provided SDP (uplink) for the
"a=candidate" attribute(s). If such attributes are present this is an
indication that the UE has invoked the ICE procedures as defined in IETF RFC
5245 [15] for media traversal of NATs and the P-CSCF shall follow the
requirements in clause C.2.
## C.2.2 Deriving the Ues IP address
The P-CSCF shall set the Framed-IP-Address AVP or Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP to
the source IP address of SIP messages received from the UE.
## C.2.3 Deriving flow descriptions
In the case where STUN Relay and ICE are used for NAT traversal, the UE is
required to place the STUN Relay provided address in the "m=" and "c=" lines
of its SDP. Given that these addresses cannot be used by the P-CSCF for
building a valid flow description, the P-CSCF will need to determine if a STUN
Relay address has been provided in the "m=" and "c=" lines of the UE provided
SDP (uplink only). The P-CSCF shall make this determination by inspecting the
uplink SDP for "a=candidate" attributes and compare the candidate address with
that contained in the "c=" line. If a match is found, the P-CSCF shall then
look at the candidate type. If the candidate type is "relay" then the address
in the "c=" line is that of a STUN Relay server. In this case, the P-CSCF
shall derive the Flow-Description AVP within the service information from the
SDP candidate type of "relay" as follows:
**Uplink Flow-Description**
\- Destination Address and Port: If the P-CSCF knows the destination address
and port of the STUN Relay allocation that the UE is sending media to, it
should use that information. If the P-CSCF does not know this address and
port, it shall wildcard the uplink destination address and port.
\- Source Address and Port: The P-CSCF shall populate the uplink source
address with the "rel-addr" address and the uplink source port with the "rel-
port" port contained within the "a=candidate" attribute.
**Downlink Flow-Description**
\- Destination Address and Port: The P-CSCF shall populate the downlink
destination address with the "rel-addr" address and the downlink destination
port with the "rel-port" port contained within the "a=candidate" attribute.
\- Source Address and Port: If the P-CSCF knows the source address and port of
the STUN Relay allocation that the UE is receiving media from, it should use
that information. If the P-CSCF does not know this address and port, it shall
wildcard the downlink source address and port.
For the other candidate types, the address in the "c=" and "m=" SDP attributes
can be used for building the flow descriptor and the P-CSCF shall follow the
rules to derive the Flow-Description AVP as described in table 6.2.2 of clause
6.2 of this TS.
## C.2.4 Gating control
If both endpoints have indicated support for ICE (both the SDP offer and
answer contain SDP attributes of type "a=candidate") ICE connectivity checks
will take place between the two Ues. In order to allow these checks to pass
through the PCEF, the P-CSCF shall enable each flow description for each media
component upon receipt of the SDP answer.
## C.2.5 Bandwidth impacts
ICE has been designed such that connectivity checks are paced inline with RTP
data (sent no faster than 20ms) and thus consumes a lesser or equal amount of
bandwidth compared to the media itself (given the small packet size of a STUN
connectivity check it is expected that the STUN connectivity checks will
always have a smaller payload than the media stream itself). Thus, there are
no additional requirements on the P-CSCF for bandwidth calculations for a
given media flow.
# C.3 PCRF procedures
## C.3.1 General
The procedures in clause C.3 are only invoked when the following two
conditions are met:
1\. Both the local and remote UE have utilized the ICE protocol for media
traversal of NATs (see clause C.2.1 for details on how this is determined);
and
2\. The IP-CAN which is servicing the IMS session does not support the concept
of a default bearer.
## C.3.2 Deriving additional flow descriptions
The PCRF may need to develop additional flow descriptions (beyond those
provided by the P-CSCF) for a media component based on additional candidate
addresses present in the SDP offer/answer exchange. The PCRF shall follow the
procedures defined in IETF RFC 5245 [15] for forming candidate pairs based on
the data contained within the received codec-data AVP. For each candidate pair
created based on the ICE procedures and not already present in the received
flow descriptions, the PCRF shall add an uplink and downlink flow description
for each media component.
NOTE 1: The uplink SDP represents the local candidates while the downlink SDP
represents the remote candidates.
Following the ICE procedures for forming candidate pairs will result in some
flow descriptions which would never be exercised. In particular, while the UE
will send connectivity checks (and ultimately its media stream) from its host
candidate, from the PCEF perspective, this will appear as being from the
server reflexive address. Given this, the PCRF should not form flow
descrptions using host candidate addresses and should only form additional
flows based on server reflexive addresses and relay addresses.
As candidates are removed from the SDP via subsequent offer/answer exchanges,
the PCRF shall update its candidate pair list and shall remove any flow
descriptors no longer being used.
NOTE 2: If the default candidate (the candidate used to populate the "c=" and
"m=" lines of both the uplink and downlink SDP) is chosen, then an updated SDP
offer/answer will not be done, and any extra flow descriptions not being used
by the session will not be removed.
## C.3.3 Gating control
For each additional flow description the PCRF adds to a media component (per
clause C.3.2), the PCRF shall enable the flow in order to allow connectivity
checks to pass.
## C.3.4 Bandwidth impacts
Per clause C.2.5 ICE is designed to have minimal impact on bandwidth policy
control. However, it is possible that media will begin flowing while the ICE
connectivity checks are still in progress. Given the possibility that no
session update will be made (the default candidates will be chosen by the ICE
protocol), it is not recommended that the PCRF adjust the bandwidth parameters
provided by the P-CSCF.
# C.4 P_CSCF procedures to support media traversal through hosted NAT without
ICE
Both the media flows and the SIP signalling can traverse a NA(P)T device
located in the customer premises domain, or "hosted NAT", as described in
Annex F of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]. The hosted NAT will modify the source IP
address and source port of uplink IP packets, and the destination IP address
and port of downlink IP packets. The IP addess and port information provided
by the UE are thus not appropriate to configure PCC rules.
The UE may use ICE procedures for hosted NAT traversal, and related PCC
procedures are described in clauses C.1 to C.3. The present clause provides
procedures to cover the case where ICE is not used.
If the P-CSCF determines that the UE is located behind a hosted NAT (using
procedures in Annex F of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]) and that ICE is not used (using
procedures in clause C.2.1), the P-CSCF shall, within the service information
sent to the PCRF:
\- provide the source IP address of IP packets transporting incoming SIP
messages from the UE as destination IP address of downlink media streams;
\- for Ipv4, provide the source IP address of IP packets transporting incoming
SIP messages from the UE as source address of uplink media streams;
\- for Ipv6, derive the source address of uplink media streams from the prefix
of the source IP address of IP packets transporting incoming SIP messages from
the UE;
\- wildcard source ports of uplink media streams; and
\- wildcard destination ports of downlink media streams.
\- provide the port information within SDP sent towards the served UE as
source ports of corresponding downlink media streams.
\- provide the port information within SDP sent towards the served UE as
destination ports of corresponding uplink media streams.
###### ## Annex D (normative): Access specific procedures for GPRS
# D.1 General
The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for General Packet
Radio Service (GPRS).
# D.2 Binding Mechanisms
Depending on the bearer control mode, bearer binding can be executed either by
PCRF, PCEF or both PCRF and PCEF.
\- For "UE-only" IP-CAN bearer establishment mode, the PCRF performs bearer
binding.
\- For "UE/NW" IP-CAN bearer establishment mode, the PCRF performs the binding
of the PCC rules for user controlled services while the PCEF performs the
binding of the PCC rules for the network controlled services.
If the PCEF performs the bearer binding, the PCRF shall follow the procedures
as described in clause 5.4 with the exceptions described in this subclause.
If the Bearer Binding function is located at the PCEF, the PCEF shall check
the QCI and ARP indicated by the PCC Rule(s) and bind the PCC rule with an IP-
CAN bearer that has the same QCI and Evolved ARP (if this is supported by the
SGSN).
If there is no suitable PDP-Context to accommodate a PCC rule when PCEF
performs the bearer binding, the PCEF shall initiate the establishment of PDP-
Contexts as specified in 3GPP TS 23.060 [3].
The PCEF shall not combine PCC rules with different ARP to the same bearer. If
the Evolved ARP parameter is not supported by the SGSN, the PCEF shall map the
Evolved ARP to Rel-99 ARP as specified in clause B.3.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.212
[9].
NOTE: If Evolved ARP is not supported by the SGSN then this enables a
modification of the PDP context ARP without impacting the bearer binding after
relocation to a SGSN that supports Evolved ARP.
If the Bearer Binding function is located at the PCRF, the PCRF shall compare
the TFT(s) of all IP-CAN bearer(s) within the IP-CAN session received via PCEF
from the UE with the existing service data flow filter information. The PCRF
shall indicate to the PCEF the IP-CAN bearer within the IP-CAN session where
the PCC Rules shall be installed, modified or removed. This is done including
the Bearer-Identifier AVP together with the associated PCC Rules within the
corresponding RAR and/or CCA commands.
\- When the PCRF does not require additional filter information coming from
the UE in order to decide on bearer binding, the PCRF shall supply the PCC
rules to be installed over the Gx interface to the PCEF within a RAR command.
\- Otherwise, the PCRF shall wait for the PCEF requesting a policy decision
for the establishment of a new IP-CAN bearer or the modification of an
existing one within a CCR command over the Gx interface.
\- When the PCEF reports the bearer event, it shall include within the CCR
command a bearer reference together with the new or modified TFT information,
the QCI and associated bitrates for new or modified PDP-Contexts.
# D.3 PCC Procedures
## D.3.1 IP-CAN Session Modification
### D.3.1.1 Network-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
Network-initiated IP-CAN session modification is executed according to clause
4.3.1.1 with the following differences:
\- The timer in step 4 will also be activated waiting for one of the following
cases:
\- If the authorized QoS for an IP-CAN bearer is changed or
\- If one or more Flow Descriptions need to be added, deactivated or removed
in any of the PCC rules bound to an IP-CAN bearer
\- If the timer in step 4 expires and the PCRF still requires additional
filter information coming from the UE in order to decide on bearer binding for
new PCC rules to be installed, all subsequent steps in figure 4.3.1.1.1 shall
not be executed, and further reactions of the PCRF are left unspecified. As a
possible option, the PCRF could abort the AF session.
\- When the PCRF performs the bearer binding, once the PCC rules are selected,
the PCRF identifies the IP-CAN bearer for each of the PCC rules and the
authorized QoS. The PCRF may provision PCC Rules and authorized QoS for
several IP-CAN Bearers within the same RAR command.
\- For step 9, IP-CAN session signalling, the subsequent steps are executed
separately for each IP-CAN bearer under the following conditions:
\- if all PCC rules bound to a PDP context have been removed or deactivated
(PDP Context deactivation is applicable)
\- if one or more PDP contexts have to be modified
\- if in UE/NW Bearer Control Mode, the GGSN needs to establish a new PDP
context(PDP Context establishment is applicable) if the bearer binding is
located at the PCEF.
The GGSN initiates the procedure to Create/Update or Terminate PDP Context
Request message to the SGSN. If in the case of updating the PDP Context the
authorized QoS for the bearer has changed, the GGSN will modify the UMTS QoS
parameters accordingly.
When the procedure in step 9 is completed and requires notifications from the
GW, for an IP-CAN Bearer termination in UE-Only Bearer Control Mode, the GGSN
sends a Diameter CCR with the Bearer-Identifier and Bearer-Operation AVPs to
indicate "Termination".
### D.3.1.2 PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification
PCEF-initiated IP-CAN Session Modification procedure shall take place
according to clauses 4.3.2.1 and 4.3.2.2 except for those procedures initiated
by the UE, as described in the clauses below.
#### D.3.1.2.1 UE-initiated IP-CAN Bearer Establishment or IP-CAN Bearer
Modification
This clause is applicable for the establishment of a new IP-CAN Bearer (other
than the one which created the IP-CAN session) and for the modification of an
already established IP-CAN Bearer. The signalling flows for these cases are as
per Figure 4.3.1.2.1.
A bearer-event-initiated Request of PCC Rules occurs when a new bearer is
established or when an existing bearer is modified. For GPRS, these are PDP
Context Modification(s) or secondary PDP context Activation(s). An IP-CAN
Session modification triggers a PCC Rule request only if the PCRF has
previously requested a PCC Rule request for the given modification event.
Figure D.3.1.2.1: UE-initiated IP-CAN Bearer Establishment and Modification.
1\. The GW receives IP-CAN Bearer signalling that is a trigger for a PCC Rule
request. For GPRS, the GGSN receives a secondary Establish PDP Context Request
or an Update PDP Context Request.
2\. The GW informs the PCRF of the modification of the IP-CAN Session due to
the IP-CAN Bearer signalling in step 1, using a Diameter CCR with the CC-
Request-Type AVP set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST. The GW reuses the existing
Gx DCC session corresponding to the IP-CAN Session.
> If the IP-CAN Bearer signalling in step 1 established a new IP-CAN Bearer,
> the GW assigns a new bearer identifier to this IP-CAN Bearer. The GW
> provides information about the new or modified bearer, e.g. requested QoS
> and TFT filters. If the event that caused the bearer modification applies
> uniquely to that bearer and PCRF performs the bearer binding, then, the
> bearer identifier should be provided within the CCR. If no bearer identifier
> is provided, the event trigger will apply to the IP-CAN session.
3\. The PCRF stores the received information in the Diameter CCR.
4\. The PCRF binds the IP-CAN Session to existing of AF session(s) using the
information received from the GW and the Service Information included in the
stored PCC rules, which was previously received from the AF(s) , as depicted
in figure 4.3.1.1.1.\ The PCRF also binds the IP-CAN Bearers within the IP-CAN
Session to all matching IP flow(s) of existing AF session(s) using the bearer
information received from the GW and the Service Information received from the
AF(s). If IP flow(s), which have previously been bound to other bearers, have
been bound to the modified bearer, PCC Rules in other bearer(s) may need to be
removed. For GPRS, an IP flow may need to be removed if a matching higher
priority TFT filter in the newly established PDP context takes precedence over
a matching lower priority TFT filter in another PDP context. Furthermore, if
IP Flow(s), which have previously been bound to the modified bearer are be
bound to other bearer(s), PCC Rules may need to be installed in other bearers.
For GPRS, an IP flow may be bound to another PDP context if it was previously
bound to the modified PDP context due to a removed higher priority TFT filter,
and a lower priority TFT filter in the other PDP context matches the IP flow.
5\. If the PCRF requires subscription-related information and does not have
it, the PCRF sends a request to the SPR in order to receive the information.
6\. The SPR replies with the subscription related information containing the
information about the allowed service(s) and PCC Rules information.
NOTE: For steps 5 and 6: The details associated with the Sp reference point
are not specified in this Release. The SPR's relation to existing subscriber
databases is not specified in this Release.
7\. For IP CAN session modification, if the AF requested a notification of the
corresponding event at the initial authorisation of the AF session, the PCRF
shall sent a Diameter RAR with the Specific-Action AVP set to indicate the
trigger event that caused the request.
8\. If step 7 happens, the AF replies with a Diameter RAA and may provide
updated service information within.
9\. The PCRF selects the new PCC Rule(s) to be installed. The PCRF can also
identify existing PCC Rules that need to be modified or removed. The PCC Rules
may relate to any of the matching AF sessions identified in step 4 or may
exist in the PCRF without matching to any AF session. The PCRF may also make a
policy decision by defining an authorized QoS and by deciding whether service
flows described in the PCC Rules are to be enabled or disabled.\ For types of
IP-CAN, where the PCRF controls IP-CAN Bearers, e.g. GPRS, the PCC Rules may
affect the IP-CAN Bearer identified in the CCR of step 2 or any other IP-CAN
Bearer identified in step 4.
10\. The PCRF stores the modified PCC Rules.
11\. The PCC Rules are provisioned by the PCRF to the GW using Diameter CCA.
The PCRF may also provide authorized QoS. The PCRF identifies the affected IP-
CAN Bearer for each of the PCC Rules and the authorized QoS. The PCRF may
provision PCC Rules and authorized QoS for several IP-CAN Bearers within the
same CCA.
12\. The GW installs the received PCC Rules. The GW also enforces the
authorized QoS and enables or disables service flow according to the flow
status of the corresponding PCC Rules.
13\. The GW sends a response to the IP-CAN Bearer signalling in step 1.\ For
GPRS, the GGSN accepts the secondary Establish PDP Context Request or the
Update PDP Context Request based on the results of the authorisation policy
decision enforcement and sends an Establish PDP Context Response or Update PDP
Context Response. If the requested QoS parameters do not correspond to the
authorized QoS, the GGSN adjusts (downgrades/upgrades) the requested UMTS QoS
parameters to the authorized values.
The PCRF may have decided in step 4 to modify PCC Rules and/or authorized QoS
of other IP CAN bearers than the IP-CAN Bearer identified in the CCR of step
2. For each such other IP-CAN Bearer identified in step 4, the GGSN executes
the following steps.
14\. The PCRF may start a timer to wait for PDP context modification requests
from the UE.
15\. The PCRF interacts with the GW according to figure 4.3.1.1.1.
#### D.3.1.2.2 UE-initiated IP-CAN Bearer Termination
This clause is applicable if an IP-CAN Bearer is being released while other
IP-CAN Bearers and thus the IP-CAN Session are not released.
For the termination of IP-CAN Bearers, three cases are covered:
\- Bearer release that does not cause service data flow(s) within an AF
session to be disabled;
\- Bearer release that causes at least one but not all the service data
flow(s) within an AF session to be disabled; and
\- Bearer release that causes all the service data flows within an AF session
to be disabled.
A Bearer release may not cause a service data flow within this bearer to be
disabled if the IP flow can be bound to another bearer. For GPRS, an IP flow
can be bound to another PDP context if a lower precedence TFT filter matching
the IP flow is installed at the other PDP context.
Figure D.3.1.2.2: UE-Initiated IP-CAN Bearer Termination
1\. The GW receives a Remove IP-CAN Bearer Request that request the
deactivation of an IP-CAN Bearer while other IP-CAN Bearers and thus the IP-
CAN Session are not released. The form of the Remove IP-CAN Bearer Request
depends upon the type of the IP-CAN. For GPRS, the GGSN receives a Delete PDP
Context Request.
2\. The GW sends a Diameter CCR message with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to
the value UPDATE_REQUEST to the PCRF, indicating the IP-CAN Bearer
termination.
3\. The PCRF identifies the IP flows bound to the removed bearer and updates
the stored bearer information. The PCRF re-evaluates the binding of IP flows,
as IP flows may now be bound to other bearers. For GPRS, an IP flow may be
bound to another PDP Context if it was previously bound to the removed PDP
context due to a higher priority TFT filter, and a lower priority TFT filter
in another PDP context matches the IP flow.
> The following steps 4 and 5 are performed for each of the other bearers
> identified in step 3:
4\. The PCRF selects the PCC Rule(s) to be installed or modified for the
affected bearer. The PCRF may also update the policy decision for this bearer.
5\. The PCRF stores the updated PCC Rules for the affected bearer.
6\. The PCRF acknowledges the bearer termination by sending a Diameter CCA
message.\ The PCRF provides PCC Rules and possibly updated authorized QoS for
each of the other bearers identified in step 3. The PCRF identifies the
affected IP-CAN Bearer for each of the PCC Rules and the authorized QoS.
7\. The GW removes those PCC Rules, which have not been moved to other IP CAN
bearers by the CCA message and are installed in the IP-CAN bearer, for which a
termination has been requested in step 1.
8\. The GW sends a Remove IP-CAN Bearer Response. For GPRS, the GGSN sends the
Delete PDP Context Response message.
9\. It the PCRF has provided PCC Rules and possibly updated authorized QoS for
other bearers in step 6, the GW installs or modifies the identified PCC Rules.
The GW also enforces the authorized QoS and enables or disables service flow
according to the flow status of the corresponding PCC Rules.
The following steps 10 to 13 or 10a to 13a apply for the case where at least
one IP Flow within an AF session is being disabled, i.e. if the IP Flow is not
bound to any other bearer that is still established. The steps shall be
performed separately for each ongoing AF session that is affected by the
bearer release as explained below.
If all IP flow(s) within the AF session are disabled by the bearer release:
10\. The PCRF indicates the session abort to the AF by sending a Diameter ASR
message to the AF.
11\. The AF responds by sending a Diameter ASA message to the PCRF.
12\. The AF sends a Diameter STR message to the PCRF to indicate that the
session has been terminated.
13\. The PCRF responds by sending a Diameter STA message to the AF.
If at least one but not all of the IP flow(s) within the AF session are
disabled by the bearer release, and the AF has requested notification of
bearer removal:
10a. The PCRF indicates the release of the bearer by sending a Diameter RAR to
the AF.
11a. The AF responds by sending a Diameter RAA to the PCRF.
12a. The AF may send an AAR to the PCRF to update the session information.
13a. If step 12a occurs, the PCRF responds by sending a AAA to the AF.

# E.3 Binding Mechanisms
## E.3.1 EPC-routed traffic
For EPC- routed traffic, binding mechanisms apply as defined insub clause 5.1
by PCRF, PCEF and BBERF. In addition, if both a Gx and associated S9a session
exist for the same IP-CAN session, the PCRF shall generate QoS Rules for all
the authorized PCC rules.
## E.3.2 NSWO traffic
The binding mechanism includes two steps for the NSWO traffic:
1\. Session binding.
2\. PCC rule authorization.
For NSWO traffic, session binding of AF session to an IP-CAN session is
performed by the PCRF for the purpose of policy control in the Fixed Broadband
access network.
When the PCRF accepts an AA-Request from the AF over the Rx interface with
service information, the PCRF shall perform session binding and associate the
described service IP flows within the AF session information (and therefore
the applicable PCC rules) to one and only one existing IP-CAN session. This
association is done comparing the user IP address received via the Rx
interface in either the Framed-IP-Address AVP or the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP
with the Ipv4 address or Ipv6 address/Ipv6 prefix received via the S9a or S9
interface. The user identity if present in the Subscription-Id AVP and the PDN
information if available in the Called-Station-Id AVP may also assist on this
association.
The PCRF determines that the UE has an IP-CAN session if the IP address (Ipv4
or Ipv6) received over the Rx interface matches the Ipv4 address or Ipv6
address/Ipv6 prefix received via one or more of the following interfaces: S9a
interface and S9 interface, and if the user identity is used to assist the
association, the user identity received over the Rx interface matches the user
identity received via one or more of the following interfaces: S9a interface
and S9 interface.
NOTE 1: In case the user identity in the IP-CAN and the application level
identity for the user are of different kinds, the PCRF needs to obtain the
mapping between the identities. Such mapping is not subject to specification
within this TS.
NOTE 2: An Ipv6 address provided over Rx matches an Ipv6 prefix provided over
S9a or S9 if the Ipv6 address belongs to the Ipv6 (sub-)network prefix.
As a result from the session binding function, the PCRF identifies what IP-CAN
session the current AF session is related with. If the PCRF is not capable of
executing the Session Binding, the PCRF shall issue an AA-Answer command to
the AF with a negative response.
NOTE: For roaming cases, the H-PCRF performs session binding of the AF session
to an IP-CAN session.
The PCRF derives and authorises PCC rules as described in clause 5.
# E.4 PCC Procedures
## E.4.1 Introduction
From the network scenarios listed in clause 4.0, in order to support
interworking with Fixed Broadband access network, three distinct network
scenarios are defined as follows:
\- the Case 1 (no Gateway Control Session over Gxx reference point) applies to
GTP-based S2a or GTP-based S2b, trusted S2c and GTP-based S5/S8 H(e)NB
scenarios.
\- the Case 2a (the same Gateway Control Session over Gxx reference point)
applies to untrusted S2c.
\- the Case 2b (a Gateway Control Session over Gxx reference point per IP-CAN
Session) applies to PMIP-based S2b and PMIP-based S5/S8 H(e)NB scenarios.
NOTE: No policy interworking solution based on S9a is defined for Fixed
Broadband access interworking via S2a in this Release.
Additionally, for case 1, the PCRF checks whether the CoA information is
included in the CC-Request command to differentiate the GTP-based S2b case and
trusted S2c case. If it is included, the trusted S2c case applies; otherwise,
the GTP-based S2b case applies.
## E.4.2 IP-CAN Session Establishment
### E.4.2.1 IP-CAN Session Establishment for EPC- routed traffic
This procedure is applicable for WLAN and H(e)NB scenarios for EPC-routed
traffic. This procedure is same as described in clause 4.1 with the exceptions
described in this clause.
Figure E.4.2.1.1 IP-CAN Session Establishment for EPC-routed traffic
1\. Step 1 through step 6: as specified in Figure 4.1.1: IP-CAN session
establishment are executed towards the H-PCRF (non-roaming case or home routed
case) or towards the V-PCRF (roaming case).
> For case 2a and case 2b of the WLAN scenario and for case 2b of the H(e)NB
> scenario, the BBERF provides the data as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9],
> clause E.5.2.
For case 1, the PCEF provides the data as described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [9],
clause E.5.1.
For case 1 (visited access), case 2a and case 2b (home routed and visited
access) the V-PCRF forwards the data towards the H-PCRF.
NOTE: For the roaming case, the V-PCRF omits the UE Local IP address (WLAN
scenario), the H(e)NB Local IP address and the UDP port in the S9 reference
point.
2\. For GTP/PMIP-based S2b of the WLAN scenario (non-roaming case) the PCRF
sends a TER command to BPCF to trigger an S9a session establishment procedure
triggered by the Gateway Control session establishment or Indication of IP-CAN
session establishment in step 1.
> For trusted and untrusted S2c of the WLAN scenario (non roaming case), when
> there is not an already established S9a session for the user, the PCRF sends
> a TER command to BPCF to trigger an S9a session establishment procedure
> triggered by the Gateway Control session establishment in step 1; otherwise,
> the PCRF may send a RAR command to BPCF to provide the QoS rules to the
> BPCF.
For H(e)NB scenarion (non roaming case), when there is not an already
established S9a session for the H(e)NB Local IP address, the PCRF sends a TER
command to BPCF to trigger an S9a session establishment procedure triggered by
the Gateway Control session establishment or Indication of IP-CAN session
establishment in step 1; otherwise, the PCRF may send a RAR command to BPCF to
provide the QoS rules to the BPCF.
The PCRF provides the data as described in 3GPP TS 29.215 [22], clause A.5.1.1
For case 1 (roaming with home routed case), the steps 2a and step 2b are
executed instead of step 2.
2a. If there is not an already established S9 session for the user, the H-PCRF
sends a TER command to V-PCRF to trigger an S9 session establishment procedure
triggered by the Indication of IP-CAN session establishment in step 1;
otherwise, the H-PCRF sends a RAR command to V-PCRF to trigger an S9
subsession establishment procedure.
The H-PCRF trigger an S9 session/subsession establishment procedure as
described in 3GPP TS 29.215 [22], clause A.6.1.1.1 or A.6.3.1.0.
2b. For GTP-based S2b of the WLAN scenario, the V-PCRF sends a TER command to
BPCF to trigger an S9a session establishment procedure.
For trusted S2c of the WLAN scenario, if there is not an already established
S9a session for the user, the V-PCRF sends a TER command to BPCF; otherwise,
the PCRF may send a RAR command to BPCF to provide the QoS rules to the BPCF.
For the H(e)NB scenario and if there is not an already established S9a session
for the H(e)NB local IP address, the V-PCRF sends a TER command to BPCF to
trigger an S9a session establishment procedure; otherwise the V-PCRF may send
a RAR command to BPCF to provide the QoS rules to the BPCF.
The V-PCRF provides the data as described in 3GPP TS 29.215 [22], clause
A.5.1.1.
> For case 1 (visited access) and for case 2a and case 2b (visited access or
> home routed case), step 2c is executed instead of step 2.
>
> 2c. For trusted and untrusted S2c of the WLAN scenario when there is not an
> already established S9a session for the user, the V-PCRF sends a TER command
> to BPCF to trigger an S9a session establishment procedure; otherwise, the
> PCRF may send a RAR command to BPCF to provide the QoS rules to the BPCF.
For GTP/PMIP-based S2b of the WLAN scenario the V-PCRF sends a TER command to
BPCF to trigger an S9a session establishment procedure.
For case 1 and case 2b of the H(e)NB scenario when there is not an already
established S9a session for the H(e)NB local IP address, the V-PCRF sends a
TER command to BPCF to trigger an S9a session establishment procedure;
otherwise, the V-PCRF may send a RAR command to provide the QoS rules to the
BPCF.

>
> 3c. The BPCF acknowledges to the V-PCRF by sending the TEA/RAA command.
4\. For the non-roaming case, triggered by step 2, the BPCF initiates an S9a
session establishment with the PCRF by sending a CCR to the PCRF with the CC-
Request-Type AVP set to the value INITIAL_REQUEST. The BPCF provides the data
as described in 3GPP TS 29.215 [22], clause A.5.1.2.
> For case 1 (roaming with home routed case), the steps 4a\~4c are executed
> instead of step 4.
4a. Triggered by step 2b, the BPCF initiates an S9a session establishment with
the V-PCRF by sending a CCR to the V-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to
the value INITIAL_REQUEST. The BPCF provides the data as described in 3GPP TS
29.215 [22], clause A.5.1.2.
4b. The V-PCRF determines that the request is for a roaming user and stores
the received information.
4c. If there is not an already established S9 session for the user, the V-PCRF
sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value
INITIAL_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes the Subsession-Enforcement-Info AVP
within the CCR with a new S9 subsession identifier assigned by the V-PCRF to
this IP-CAN session within the Subsession-Id AVP, and the Subsession-Operation
AVP set to the value ESTABLISHMENT. If there is an already established S9
session for this roaming user, the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF with the
CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes the
Subsession-Enforcement-Info AVP within the CCR with a new S9 subsession
identifier assigned by the V-PCRF to this IP-CAN session within the

29.215 [22], clause A.5.1.2.
4e. The V-PCRF determines that the request is for a roaming user and stores
the received information.
5\. The H-PCRF stores the information received in the CCR.

establishment by sending a CCA to the BPCF.
> For case 1 (roaming with home routed case), steps 6a\~6b are executed
> instead of step 6.
>
> 6a. The H-PCRF acknowledges the S9 session establishment/modification by
> sending a CCA to the V-PCRF.

scenario.
### E.4.2.2 IP-CAN Session Establishment for NSWO traffic
Figure E.4.2.2.1: IP-CAN Session Establishment for NSWO traffic
1\. The broadband access network becomes aware of the IMSI of the 3GPP UE if
3GPP-based access authentication (EAP-AKA/AKA') is performed. The BPCF also
becomes aware of the UE local IP address.
2\. For the non-roaming case, the BPCF initiates an S9a* session establishment
procedure with the H-PCRF by sending a CCR using the CC-Request-Type AVP set
to the value INITIAL_REQUEST. The BPCF shall provide the data as described in

value INITIAL_REQUEST. The V-PCRF includes the Subsession-Enforcement-Info AVP
within the CCR with a new S9 subsession identifier assigned by the V-PCRF to
this IP-CAN session within the Subsession-Id AVP, and the Subsession-Operation
AVP set to the value ESTABLISHMENT.
> If there is an already established S9 session for this roaming user, the

3\. The H-PCRF stores the information received in the CCR.
4\. Perform step 5 through 11: as specified in Figure 4.1.1: IP-CAN session
establishment. Additionally, an indication on whether policy control for NSWO
traffic should be performed for the UE may be retrieved from the SPR. The
H-PCRF enables policy control for NSWO traffic for that UE based on operator
policies and user profile information that may depend on e.g. NSWO-APN being
used by the UE.
5\. For the non-roaming case, the H-PCRF provisions the PCC Rules to the BPCF
using CCA if policy control is enabled.
> For the roaming case, steps 5a\~5f are executed instead of step 5.
5a. The H-PCRF provisions the PCC Rules if available to the V-PCRF using CCA
if policy control is enabled. The H-PCRF includes PCC Rules and ADC Rules if
available in the Subsession-Decision AVP of the CCA, along with the S9
subsession identifier as received in step 2c within the Subsession-Id AVP.
5b. If policy control is enabled in step 5a, the V-PCRF stores the received
PCC rules if available. The V-PCRF enforces visited operator policies
regarding QoS authorization requested by the H-PCRF as indicated by the
roaming agreements.
5c. The V-PCRF informs the H-PCRF when a request has been denied and may
provide the acceptable QoS information for the service.
5d. The H-PCRF acknowledges the CCR and may additionally include new or
modified PCC rules to the V-PCRF. When user profile configuration indicates
that Application Detection and Control function is enabled, the H-PCRF may
additionally include new or modified PCC rules for application detection and
control.
5e. In case of solicited application reporting with a TDF, the V-PCRF
initiates a TDF Session Establishment procedure, according to clause 4.6.1,
with the selected TDF.
5f. The V-PCRF provisions PCC rules received from the H-PCRF to the BPCF by
using CCA.

1\. The Fixed Broadband Access network is aware of the UE is detached from the
broadband access network
2\. For the non-roaming case, the BPCF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF to indicate
the S9a* session termination. The BPCF requests the termination of the S9a*
session using the CC-Request-Type set to the value TERMINATION_REQUEST.
For the roaming case, the steps 2a and 2c are executed instead of step 2.
2a. The BPCF sends a CCR to the V-PCRF to indicate the S9a* session
termination. The BPCF requests the termination of the S9a* session using the
CC-Request-Type set to the value TERMINATION_REQUEST.
2b. If there is an active TDF session between TDF and V-PCRF, the TDF session
termination is initiated as defined in clause 4.6.2. For this case, the PCRF
described in clause 4.6.2 acts as a V-PCRF.
2c. The V-PCRF sends the CCR to the H-PCRF. If this is the last subsession
associated with the S9 session, the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF to
request the termination of the S9 session using the CC-Request-Type AVP set to
the value TERMINATION_REQUEST. Otherwise, the V-PCRF sends a CCR to the H-PCRF
with a CC-Request-Type AVP set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST and a Subsession-
Enforcement-Info within which the Subsession-Operation AVP set to value
TERMINATION to request the termination of the conresponding S9 subsession.
3\. The H-PCRF identifies the AF sessions that are bound to IP flows of the
removed IP-CAN Session.
4\. For the non-roaming case, the H-PCRF acknowledges the S9a* session
termination by sending a CCA to the BPCF.
For the roaming case, steps 4a\~4c are executed instead of step 4:
4a. The H-PCRF acknowledges the S9 session or subsession termination by
sending a CCA to the V-PCRF.
4b. The V-PCRF removes the information related to the terminated IP-CAN
Session.
4c. The V-PCRF acknowledges the S9a* session termination by sending a CCA to
theBPCF.
5\. If there is an active TDF session between TDF and H-PCRF, the TDF session
termination is initiated as defined in clause 4.6.2.
6\. Perform step 8 through step 12: as specified in Figure 4.2.1.1: UE-
Initiated IP-CAN Session Termination -- AF located in the HPLMN
#### E.4.3.2.2 PCRF-initiated IP-CAN Session Termination for NSWO traffic
Figure E.4.3.2.2.1: PCRF-initiated IP-CAN Session Termination for NSWO Traffic
1\. The H-PCRF detects that the termination of an IP-CAN Session is required.
2\. For the non-roaming case, the H-PCRF sends a RAR including the Session-
Release-Cause AVP to request that the BPCF terminates the S9a* session.
For the roaming case, steps 2a\~2b are executed instead of step 2:
2a. If the subsession being terminated is the last subsession over S9, the
H-PCRF sends a RAR including the Session-Release-Cause AVP to the V-PCRF to
indicate the termination of the S9 session. Otherwise, the H-PCRF sends a RAR
to the V-PCRF including the Subsession-Decision-Info AVP with the Session-
Release-Cause AVP to indicate the request for terminating the S9 subsession
corresponding to the IP-CAN session.
2b. The V-PCRF sends a RAR including the Session-Release-Cause AVP to the
BPCF.
3\. The Fixed Broadband access network removes all the PCC rules which are
applied to the IP-CAN session.
4\. For the non-roaming case, the BPCF sends a RAA to acknowledge the RAR.
For the roaming case, steps 4a\~4b are executed instead of step 4:
4a. The BPCF sends a RAA to the V-PCRF.
4b. The V-PCRF sends a RAA to the H-PCRF and acknowledges the request for
terminating the S9 session or the S9 subsession corresponding to the IP-CAN
session.

trigger in Step 1 in figure 4.3.1.1.1 only applies to AF session interactions
(as described in clause 4.3.1.2) and TDF session interactions (as described in
clause 4.3.1.2). For V-PCRF initiated IP-CAN session modification, the V-PCRF
always asks the H-PCRF for policy decision.
NOTE: If the AF/TDF is located in the V-PLMN, upon a request from the AF/TDF,
the V-PCRF will proxy the request to the H-PCRF, this may also trigger the
PCRF-Initiated IP-CAN Session Modification for EPC routed traffic.

PCC rules for Visited Access scenario, or QoS Rules for Home Routed scenario.
2b. The V-PCRF performs local authorization of the received PCC rules or QoS
rules when necessary.

received (i.e. SDF template, QCI, MBR, GBR and ARP) into access specific QoS
parameters applicable in the BBF domain (the details of the mapping from 3GPP
QoS parameters on S9a to QoS parameters applicable in the BBF domain is out of
3GPP scope).
4\. The BPCF sends RAA to the H-PCRF to acknowledge the RAR and informs the
H-PCRF about the outcome of the QoS rule operation. If the BPCF cannot provide
the requested QoS by the H-PCRF, the BPCF may respond with the acceptable QoS.

set to the value UPDATE_REQUEST to report QoS Rule failure.
2b. The V-PCRF stores the information received.
2c. For Visited Access scenario, the V-PCRF sends a Diameter CCR to the H-PCRF
to report PCC Rule failure. For Home Routed scenario, the V-PCRF sends a
Diameter CCR to the H-PCRF to report QoS Rule failure.

in figure 4.3.2.1.1. In step 3 (3c for the Visited Access case), when the UE
Local IP address, H(e)NB Local IP address or the UDP port number is changed,
the PCEF may provide the updated UE local IP address, the updated H(e)NB IP

NOTE The detail of the mapping from 3GPP QoS parameters on S9a to QoS
parameters applicable in the Fixed Broadband Access is out of 3GPP scope.

1 Step 1 to 3(3a-3c for the Visited Access case) is the same as specified in
figure 4.3.2.1.1.
In step 1, in case 2b and case 2a for WLAN scenario, when the UE Local IP
address, and/or the UDP port number is changed, the BBERF (ePDG) may provide
these information to the PCRF. For H(e)NB scenario, when the H(e)NB local IP

S9 session termination notification is received.
The DRA has information about the user identity (UE NAI), the UE Local IP
address/H(e)NB Local IP address, the PDN Id (if available) and the selected
PCRF identity for a certain IP-CAN Session or a certain user.
For NSWO traffic, the DRA Information Storage shall be done as specified
below:
\- The DRA shall maintain PCRF routing information per UE-NAI and APN.
\- The DRA has information about the user identity (UE NAI), the local UE Ipv4
address and/or the local UE Ipv6 address/prefix, the APN (i.e. NSWO_APN) and
the selected PCRF identity for a certain UE.
\- The PCRF routing information stored for an S9a* session in the DRA shall be
removed after the S9a* session is terminated.
When both EPC-routed and NSWO traffic exist, the DRA Information Storage shall
be done as specified below:
\- The DRA shall maintain PCRF routing information per UE-NAI or per UE-NAI
and APN.
\- The DRA has information received for both EPC-Routed and NSWO scenarios and

as follows:
\- If the request is an S9 session establishment trigger from the H-PCRF, it
shall select a V-PCRF to handle the S9 session for that UE. It shall then send
the redirect message including selected V-PCRF to the H-PCRF.
\- If the request is an S9 session termination notification from H-PCRF, the
V-DRA shall remove the PCRF routing information (i.e. DRA binding). If the
V-DRA does not have a V-PCRF already selected, it shall reject the request.
The S9 session establishment trigger and the S9 session termination
notification request shall have the same information of user identity (UE
NAI), the UE Local IP address/H(e)NB Local IP address, the PDN Id(if
available). The DRA shall remove the DRA binding based on the above
information when the DRA receives the S9 session termination notification
(i.e. a TER command including DRA- Binding AVP set to the value
DRA_BINDING_DELETION).
For NSWO traffic, the DRA is maintaining PCRF routing information per UE-NAI
and APN. The DRA shall be aware of the S9a* Diameter termination request as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.215 [22] in order to release the DRA binding
information.
### E.6.3.4 Proxy DRA
Proxy DRA is specified in clause 7.3.5 with the additions described in this
subclause.
For EPC-routed traffic for case 1 (home routed case), when the V-DRA receives
a message from the H-PCRF, it shall behave as follows:
\- If the message is an S9 session establishment trigger from the H-PCRF, it
shall select a V-PCRF to handle the S9 session for that UE. It shall then
proxy the request to the selected V-PCRF. The V-DRA indicates that there is a
V-DRA deployed in the visited PLMN by including the DRA-Deployment AVP in TEA
command.
\- If the message is an S9 session termination notification from the H-PCRF,
the V-DRA shall remove the PCRF routing information (i.e. DRA binding). If the
V-DRA does not have a V-PCRF already selected, it shall reject the request.
The S9 session establishment trigger and the S9 session termination
notification shall have the same information of user identity (UE NAI), the UE
Local IP address/H(e)NB Local IP address and the PDN Id (if available). The
DRA shall remove the DRA binding based on the above information when the DRA
receives the S9 session termination notification (i.e. a TER command including
DRA-Binding AVP set to the value DRA_BINDING_DELETION).
Proxy DRA is specified in clause 7.3.5 with the additions described in this
subclause.
For NSWO traffic in both non-roaming and roaming cases, when the (V-) DRA
receives an S9a* request from the BPCF, it shall behave as follows:
\- If the request is an S9a* session establishment, it shall select a V-PCRF
to handle the S9 session for that UE and APN. It shall then proxy the request
to the selected V-PCRF.
\- If the request is an S9a* session termination, the (V-) DRA shall remove
the PCRF routing information and proxy the request to the (V-) PCRF. If the
(V-) DRA does not have a (V-) PCRF already selected, it shall reject the
request.
\- If the request is an S9a* session modification, the (V-) DRA shall proxy
the request.
The BPCF shall be capable of sending every message of a session to the DRA.
The BPCF may be configured to bypass the (V-) DRA on S9a* session modification
messages by sending these types of messages directly to the (V-) PCRF.
### E.6.3.5 PCRF selection by BPCF
For EPC-routed traffic, when the S9a Session Establishment request is
triggered by the (V-) PCRF, the BPCF may use the (V-) PCRF identity provided
within the PCRF-Address AVP in the S9a Session Establishment Trigger.
The BPCF may also use the DRA procedures as described in clause 7.3. In order
to do so, the BPCF shall provide the DRA of the PCRF realm with identity
parameters during the S9a Session Establishment procedure. The identity
parameters from the BPCF may comprise the UE Local Ipv4 or UE local Ipv6
address in the UE-Local-IP-Address AVP (WLAN scenario), H(e)NB Local IP
address in the HeNB-Local-IP-Address AVP (H(e)NB scenario), PDN information in
the Called-Station-Id AVP if available and user identity in the Subscription-
Id AVP. The BPCF obtains these data from the S9a Session Establishment Trigger
procedure initiated by the (V-) PCRF.
For NSWO traffic, the BPCF finds the PCRF using the DRA procedures as
described in clause 7.3. In order to do so, the BPCF shall provide the DRA of
the PCRF realm with identity parameters during the S9a* Session Establishment
procedure. The identity parameters from the BPCF shall comprise the UE local
Ipv4 adress or UE local Ipv6 prefix/address in the UE-Local-IP-Address AVP or
UE-Local-IP-Prefix AVP, the APN in the Called-Station-Id AVP and user identity
in the Subscription-Id AVP.
For both EPC-routed traffic and NSWO traffic, if the redirect agent is used
for DRA, the DRA shall use the redirecting requests procedure as specified in
IETF RFC 6733 [61], and include the PCRF identity in the Redirect-Host AVP in
the Diameter reply sent to the BPCF .
If proxy agent is used for DRA, the DRA should use the proxy procedure as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. For PA2 solution (described in clause 7.1)
only S9a/S9a* session establishment and S9a/S9a* session termination messages
shall be sent through the DRA.
For NSWO traffic in a roaming scenario the selected V-PCRF shall belong to the
same VPLMN selected during the 3GPP --based authentication procedure. The BPCF
uses the VPLMN-Id to find the V-DRA in the VPLMN. The V-PCRF finds the DRA in
the HPLMN according to clause 7.3.8.
NOTE: The BPCF will use the VPLMN-Id to obtain the Destination-Realm AVP used
to find the V-DRA and then to find the V-PCRF using Diameter based procedures
as described in IETF RFC 6733 [61].
### E.6.3.6 PCRF selection by AF and TDF in Unsolicited application reporting
mode for NSWO traffic
PCRF selection by the AF shall be done according to clause 7.3.7.
PCRF selection by the TDF shall be done according to clause 7.3.9.
NOTE: The DRA matches the received UE IP address received in either the
Framed-IP-Address AVP or the Framed-Ipv6-Prefix AVP in the Rx and Sd reference
point with the UE Local IP Address received in UE-Local-IP-Address AVP or UE
Local Ipv6 Prefix in the UE-Local-IP-Prefix AVP in the S9a reference point in
order to select the same PCRF.
### E.6.3.7 PCRF selection in a roaming scenario
For both EPC-routed traffic and NSWO traffic, the V-PCRF uses the DRA
procedures as described in clause 7.3.8 to address the H-PCRF. In order to do
so, the V-PCRF shall provide the DRA of the H-PCRF realm with identity
parameters during the S9 Session Establishment procedure.
For EPC-routed traffic, the identity parameters from the V-PCRF may comprise
the UE Local Ipv4 or UE local Ipv6 address in the UE-Local-IP-Address AVP
(WLAN scenario), H(e)NB Local IP address in the HeNB-Local-IP-Address AVP
(H(e)NB scenario), PDN information in the Called-Station-Id AVP if available
and user identity in the Subscription-Id AVP obtained from the S9 Session
Establishment Trigger procedure initiated by the H-PCRF.
For NSWO traffic, the identity parameters from the V-PCRF may comprise the UE
Local Ipv4 or Ipv6 address in the UE-Local-IP-Address AVP or UE local Ipv6
prefix in the UE-Local-IP-Prefix AVP, PDN information in the Called-Station-Id
AVP and user identity in the Subscription-Id AVP obtained from the S9a*
Session Establishment procedure.
### E.6.3.8 PCRF selection for the HNB CS Service
When the DRA receives a request for a certain S15 Session establishment from
the HNB GW, the DRA selects a suitable PCRF for the S15 Session based on the
HNB local IP address within the HeNB-Local-IP-Address AVP. When the S15
Session is terminated, the DRA shall remove the information about the S15
Session.
## E.6.4 DRA flows
### E.6.4.1 General
For the EPC-routed traffic case and for the non-roaming case, the flows for
the non-roaming case in the clauses 7.4.1 and 7.4.2 are applied with the
following exception:
\- BPCF acts as a client and messages are S9a Diameter messages;
\- The external trigger in the Establishment of Diameter Sessions is an S9a
session establishment trigger message from the PCRF
For the EPC-routed traffic case and for the roaming case, the flows for the
roaming case in clauses 7.4.1 and 7.4.2 are applied with the following
exception:
\- The external trigger in the Establishment of Diameter Sessions is an S9
session establishment trigger message from the PCRF for case 1 and home routed
case.
The flows in clauses E.6.4.2 and E.6.4.3 are applicable to the EPC-routed
traffic and for case 1 and UE roaming in the home routed scenario.
For the NSWO traffic case and for the non-roaming case, the flows for the non-
roaming and roaming case in the clauses 7.4.1 and 7.4.2 are applied with
following exception:
> \- BPCF acts as a client and messages are S9a* Diameter messages for the
> non-roaming case.

request) and determines that an S9 session shall be established.
2\. A TER command including user identity, PDN ID if available, UE Local IP
address/H(e)NB Local IP address and UDP source port number(if NA(P)T is
detected) is sent by the H-PCRF and received by a V-DRA (proxy) in the visited
PLMN. The Auth-Session-State AVP set to NO_STATE_MAINTAINED shall be included
in the TER.

using DRA (Proxy), which is described in clause E.6.4.2.2.
If the H-PCRF was aware that there is a V-DRA deployed in the V-PLMN (step 4
of S9 session establishment procedure according to clause E.6.4.3.1), this
procedure shall apply.
# E.7 BPCF Addressing
## E.7.1 General
For S9a session establishment trigger procedure initiated by the (V-)PCRF, the
PCRF (for non-roaming case) and the V-PCRF (for roaming case) is configured
with IP address range mappings { (Ipx..Ipy) â€‘> BBF network entry point}. The
PCRF (for non-roaming) and the V-PCRF (for roaming cases) selects the correct
BBF network entry point based on UE Local IP address for WLAN scenario and
based on H(e)NB IP address and FQDN if available for H(e)NB case received from
the PCEF/BBERF/HNB GW for H(e)NB scenario. The implementation of a BBF network
entry point is out-of-scope for 3GPP e.g. be a BPCF or a DRA.
For case 1 and roaming with home routed, for S9 session establishment trigger
procedure initiated by the H-PCRF, H-PCRF finds the VPLMN according to the
PLMN Id of the visited network in 3GPP-SGSN-MCC-MNC AVP if received at IP-CAN
session establishment received over Gx reference point, and then discovers
V-PCRF by V-DRA if there are more than one PCRF deployed in the visited
network. The H-PCRF sends the H(e)NB Local IP address within HeNB-Local-IP-
Address AVP and optionally the FQDN of BBF access network within the HeNB-BBF-
FQDN AVP for H(e)NB scenario or the UE local IP address within the UE-Local-
IP-Address AVP for WLAN scenario to the V-PCRF over the S9 reference point.
# E.8 Session Linking Function
PCRF and BPCF needs to support session linking function. The PCRF shall be
able to perform the linking between multiple Gx and Gateway Control Session to
the same S9a session.
When receiving an IP-CAN Session Establishment request or an IP-CAN Session
modification request with an UE local IP address or H(e)NB local IP address,
the PCRF shall perform the session linking between the S9a session and the
corresponding Gx session according to the UE Local IP address/ H(e)NB local IP
address.
When receiving a Gateway Control Session Establishment Request or a Gateway
Control and QoS Rule Request with UE local IP Address or a H(e)NB local IP
Address change, the PCRF shall perform the session linking between the S9a
session and the Gateway Control Session according to the UE Local IP address/
H(e)NB local IP address.
If there is not an established S9a session which could be linked to the Gx or
Gateway Control Session, the PCRF shall initiate the S9a Session Establishment
trigger procedure.
For 3GPP HNB Procedures with CS support, the PCRF shall be able to perform the
linking between S15 sessions and the S9a session.
NOTE 1: There is a single S15 session per HNB for CS calls for all Ues
connected to the HNB in order to improve performance. In addition, for CS
calls there are no UE specific policies and therefore a single PCRF can handle
CS calls for all Ues.
###### ## Annex F (normative): Access specific aspects, Fixed Broadband Access
network convergence
# F.1 General
This annex defines the enhancement to PCC framework for supporting policy and
charging control in the fixed broadband access network in the convergent
scenario where the PCRF controls directly the network element(s) in the fixed
broadband access without the mediation of a different policy server, such as
the Broadband Policy Control Function (BPCF).
Policy and charging control is provided for both Non-seamless WLAN offload
traffic from a 3GPP UE and the traffic from fixed devices.
# F.2 Definitions and abbreviations
## F.2.1 Definitions
The definitions in the following are relevant for this Annex only.
**UE local IP address** is defined as either the public IP address assigned to
the UE by the Broadband Forum domain in the no-NAT case, or the public IP
address assigned by the Broadband Forum domain to the NATed RG.
**IP-CAN session** as defined in clause 3.1 applies with the following
clarifications for fixed broadband access. The term UE corresponds to the
device that accesses the services provided by the network (i.e. either RG, or
3GPP UE or fixed end-device), the PDN identifies the IP network where the
device gets IP connectivity and the UE identity information may be the IMSI,
the user-name or the access line identifier (if available). In a Fixed
Broadband Access an IP-CAN session corresponds to a Subscriber IP Session
defined in Broadband Forum TR-146.
NOTE: The PDN connection concept and APN are not applicable to a Subscriber IP
session for a fixed device.
### F.2.2 Abbreviations
The following abbreviations are relevant for this annex only:
BBF Broadband Forum
BPCF Broadband Policy Control Function
NSWO Non-Seamless WLAN offload
NSWO-APN Non-Seamless WLAN offload APN
RG Residential Gateway
# F.3 Binding Mechanisms

Subscriber IP session in Fixed Broadband Access network can be the Access Line
Identifier (Physical-Access-ID AVP and Logical-Access-ID AVP) or the username
(Subscription-Id AVP), for example when the Subscriber IP session is a PPP
Session.
NOTE: In case the Subscriber Identifier in the IP-CAN and the application
level identity for the fixed device are of different kinds, the PCRF needs to
map between them. Such mapping is not subject to specification within this TS.

###### ## Annex G (normative): Diameter overload control mechanism
# G.1 General
Support for Diameter overload control by PCC functional elements is optional.
Unless otherwise stated, the procedures defined in this Annex assume that a
PCC functional element supports the Diameter overload control mechanism.
IETF RFC 7683 [33] specifies the Diameter overload control mechanism. This
includes the definition of Diameter overload related AVPs and the Diameter
overload related behavior.
To indicate support of the Diameter overload control mechanism, each PCC
functional element shall include the OC-Supported-Features AVP in every
Diameter request and answer as defined in IETF RFC 7683 [33].
Each PCC functional element (e.g. PCRF, PCEF, AF, etc) shall act asa reacting
node and asa reporting node as defined in IETF RFC 7683 [33].
# G.2 Reporting Node
When a PCC functional element determines the need to request a reduction in
the traffic it is handling due to an overload condition, it shall include the
OC-OLR AVP in answer messages, as defined in IETF RFC 7683 [33].
How it determines that it is in an overload situation and the severity of the
overload is implementation dependent and based on operator policy.
How it determines the specific contents of the OC-OLR AVP is implementation
dependent and based on operator policy.
# G.3 Reacting Node
A PCC functional element acting as a reacting node applies the requested
traffic reduction received in OC-OLR AVPs in answer messages to corresponding
applicable requests, as per IETF RFC 7683 [33].
How it achieves the requested traffic reduction is implementation dependent.
Diameter requests related to priority traffic (e.g. MPS) as described in 3GPP
TS 22.153 [58] and emergency have the highest priority. If required by the
regional/national regulatory and operator policies, and when the reacting node
is able to detect priority traffic, priority traffic shall be exempted from
throttling due to Diameter overload control up to the point where requested
traffic reduction cannot be achieved without throttling the priority traffic.
Relative priority amongst various priority traffic (e.g. MPS) and emergency
traffic is subject to regional/national regulatory and operator policies.
# G.4 DRA Diameter Overload Behavior
The DRA may optionally incorporate agent behavior specified in IETF RFC 7683
[33].
## G.4.1 DRA reacting to Host Reports
The procedures defined in this clause are only applicable to the proxy DRA
(PA1 and PA2) as the redirect DRA is not in the path of application answers
and as such does not have access to overload reports from other nodes.
The proxy DRA shall use host reports as one of the inputs when making routing
decisions for realm-routed requests, i.e. requests that do not contain a
Destination-Host AVP. This is needed because entities sending such requests
are not aware of the final recipient of the request (e.g. specific PCRF
instance).
The following scenarios shall be addressed:
\- No binding exists for the request and the request can result in a new
binding (e.g. IP-CAN session establishment); in this case the DRA is selecting
the PCRF that will handle the binding. The DRA should use any active and
relevant Diameter overload host reports as one of the inputs to the selection
of the PCRF. If all PCRFs are in an overload state, the DRA should reduce
traffic sent to each of the PCRFs based on the individual host requested
traffic reduction. This may result in the DRA rejecting the request.
\- A binding already exists for the request -- In this case the DRA should
reduce the traffic sent to the overloaded node by the host requested traffic
reduction. This may result in the DRA rejecting the request.
NOTE: Result-Code when rejecting a request in the above cases need to be used
according to the IETF RFC 7683 [33].
How the DRA achieves any requested traffic reduction is implementation
dependent and/or based on operator policy.
###### ## Annex H (normative): Access specific procedures for 3GPP EPS
# H.1 General
The present annex defines IP-CAN specific requirements for 3GPP Evolved Packet
System (EPS).
# H.2 Binding Mechanisms
The procedures defined in clause 5.4 apply.
Whenever the PCRF modifies the Authorized QoS of the default bearer, the BBF
shall re-evaluate the bearer binding taking into account the default bearer
QoS change the default bearer binding indication in the PCC Rule if applicable
and any PCC Rule/QoS Rule operation requested by the PCRF.
###### ## Annex I (normative): APN matching procedures
A PCRF or DRA needs to compare APN information received over different
interfaces, for instance within the Called-Station-Id AVP, for certain
purposes such as session binding. To do so, the PCRF or DRA shall apply the
procedures in the present Annex.
The PCRF or DRA shall consider the different possible encoding formats of the
APN defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [37], clause 9.1. When the PCRF or DRA needs to
compare an APN only containing the APN Network Identifier, with an APN
containing both APN Network Identifier and APN Operator Identifier, the PCRF
shall consider those APNs as matching if their APN Network Identifiers match.
The PCRF shall perform a case-insensitive comparison for APN Network
Identifiers and APN Operator Identifiers.
###### ## Annex J (normative): Diameter message priority mechanism
## J.1 General
The support of the Diameter message priority mechanism by PCC functional
elements is optional. PCC functional elements that support Diameter message
priority mechanism shall comply with the procedures specified in this annex.
IETF RFC 7944 [40] specifies the Diameter message priority mechanism that
allows Diameter nodes to indicate the relative priority of Diameter messages.
With this information, other Diameter nodes can leverage the relative priority
of Diameter messages into routing, resource allocation, set the DSCP marking
for transport of the associated Diameter message, and also abatement decisions
when overload control is applied. This includes the definition of Diameter
message priority related AVPs and the Diameter message priority related
behaviour.
## J.2 PCC functional element behaviour
A PCC functional entity supporting the Diameter message priority mechanism
shall comply with IETF RFC 7944 [40].
A PCC functional element sending a request shall determine the required
priority according to its policies. When priority is required, the PCC
functional element shall include the DRMP AVP indicating the required priority
level in the request it sends, and shall prioritise the request according to
the required priority level
When the PCC functional element receives the corresponding response, it shall
prioritise the received response according to the priority level received
within the DRMP AVP if present in the response, otherwise according to the
priority level of the corresponding request.
When a PCC functional element receives a request, it shall handle the request
according to the received DRMP AVP priority level. For the response, it may
modify the priority level received in the DRMP AVP according to its policies
and shall handle the response according to the required priority level. If the
required priority level is different from the priority level received in the
request, it shall include the DRMP AVP in the response.
If:
\- a PCC functional element supports using the Diameter message priority
mechanism for DSCP marking purposes,
\- the transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and
\- message-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack
transporting Diameter,
then the PCC functional element shall set the DSCP marking for transport of
the request or response according to the required priority level.
The PCC functional element decisions for a required priority and the priority
level value are implementation specific.
Diameter requests related to high priority traffic (e.g. MPS, emergency) shall
contain a DRMP AVP with a high priority of which the level is operator
dependent.
## J.3 Interactions
If the PCC entity supporting the Diameter message priority mechanism receives
the request message containing both the Reservation-Priority AVP and DRMP AVP,
the PCC entity shall prioritise the request according to priority level
received within the DRMP AVP. This procedure also applies for MPS.
NOTE: Upon receipt of the request message containing the DRMP AVP, the PCRF
will use the DRMP AVP to prioritize other PCC interfaces related to that IP-
CAN session.
###### ## Annex K (normative): Diameter load control mechanism
# K.1 General
IETF RFC 8583 [60] specifies the Diameter load control mechanism. This
includes the definition of Diameter Load AVP and the Diameter load related
behaviour.
Whether Diameter load control mechanism is applicable for a specific interface
is specified in the 3GPP specification for that interface. For PCC related
interfaces where the Diameter load control mechanism is applicable, the
procedures in this Annex apply.
Support for Diameter load control is optional for all PCC functional elements.
NOTE: The Diameter Load AVP will simply be ignored by peers not supporting
Diameter load control.
If a PCC functional element supports the Diameter load control mechanism, it
shall apply the procedures in the present Annex.
The PCC functional elements that are recipients of realm-routed requests (e.g.
PCRF, H-PCRF, TDF for solicited application reporting, TSSF, OCS) shall for
that interface act as Endpoint Reporting Node as defined in IETF RFC 8583
[60].
The PCC functional elements that send realm-routed requests (e.g. PCRF,
V-PCRF, PCEF, AF) shall for that interface act as Reacting Node as defined in
IETF RFC 8583 [60].
# K.2 Endpoint or Agent Reporting Node
The reporting shall include load information in the Load AVP as defined in
IETF RFC 8583 [60] in Diameter answer messages.
When and in which frequency to include the Load AVP is implementation
dependent and based on operator policy.
How the reporting node determines the specific contents of the Load-Value AVP
within the Load AVP is also implementation dependent and based on operator
policy.
# K.3 Reacting Node
A PCC functional element acting as a Reacting Node may use the load
information in implementation dependent manner, e.g. when deciding where to
route requests for new Diameter sessions.
# K.4 DRA Behaviour
The DRA may optionally incorporate Reacting Node behaviour as defined in IETF
RFC 8583 [60]. Support of Agent Reporting Node behaviour as defined in IETF
RFC 8583 [60] is not required.
NOTE: Only one logical DRA is specified in the PCC architecture. The Agent
Reporting Node behaviour as defined in IETF RFC 8583 [60] is only useful if
several Diameter routeing agents are deployed. i.e. not in the PCC
architecture.
The procedures defined in this clause are only applicable to the proxy DRA
(PA1 and PA2) as the redirect DRA is not in the path of application answers
and as such does not have access to load reports from other nodes.
The proxy DRA should use load reports as one of the inputs when making routing
decisions and selection of the PCRF for realm-routed requests, i.e. requests
that do not contain a Destination-Host AVP. This is needed because entities
sending such requests are not aware of the final recipient of the request
(e.g. specific PCRF instance). If no binding exists for the request and the
request can result in a new binding (e.g. IP-CAN session establishment), the
DRA is selecting the PCRF that will handle the binding.
