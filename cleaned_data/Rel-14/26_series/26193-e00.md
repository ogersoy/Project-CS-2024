# 4 General
Source Controlled Rate operation (SCR) is a mechanism for the AMR Wideband
Speech Codec, which allows to encode the input signal at a lower average rate
by taking speech inactivity into account. The SCR scheme may be used for the
following purposes:
-to save power in the User Equipment;
-to reduce the overall interference and load in the networks.
SCR in the transmitting path (uplink) shall be in operation in UEs, if
commanded so by the network. The UE shall handle SCR in the receiving path
(downlink) at any time, regardless, whether SCR in the transmitting path is
commanded or not.
## 4.1 General organisation
The default SCR mechanism described in this document requires the following
functions:
-a Voice Activity Detector (VAD) on the transmit (TX) side;
-evaluation of the background acoustic noise on the transmit (TX) side, in order to transmit characteristic parameters to the receive (RX) side;
-generation on the receive (RX) side of a similar noise, called comfort noise, during periods where the transmission is switched off.
The Voice Activity Detector (VAD) is defined in [7] and the comfort noise
functions in [6]. Both are based partly on the speech Codec and its internal
variables, defined in [4].
In addition to these functions, if the parameters arriving at the RX side are
detected to be seriously corrupted by errors, the speech or comfort noise must
be generated from substituted data in order to avoid seriously annoying
effects for the listener. These functions are defined in [5].
An overall description of the speech processing parts can be found in [1]. An
overview of one link SCR operation is shown in Figure 1.

### 5.1.1 General operation
The TX SCR handler passes traffic frames, individually marked by TX_TYPE, to
the Framing unit. Each frame consists of bit fields containing the information
bits, the codec mode indication, and the TX_TYPE. TX_TYPE shall be used to
specify the contents of the frame. The table below provides an overview of the
different TX_TYPEs used and explains the required contents in the information
bit and the mode indication bit fields.
Table 1: SCR TX_TYPE identifiers for UMTS_AMR-WB and FR_AMR-WB
* * *
**TX_TYPE** **Information Bits** **Mode Indication**
SPEECH_GOOD Speech frame, size 132..477 bits, depending on codec mode Current
codec mode
SPEECH_BAD Corrupt speech frame (bad CRC), size 132..477 bits, depending on
codec mode Current codec mode
SPEECH_LOST No useful information.\ No useful information (Note: If
implementation does not support the SPEECH_LOST, SPEECH_BAD shall be used
instead)
SID_FIRST Marker for the end of talkspurt, no further information, all 35
comfort noise bits set to "0" The codec mode that would have been used if
TX_TYPE had been "SPEECH_GOOD"
SID_UPDATE 35 comfort noise bits The codec mode that would have been used if
TX_TYPE had been "SPEECH_GOOD"
SID_BAD Corrupt SID update frame (bad CRC) The codec mode that would have been
used if TX_TYPE had been "SPEECH_GOOD"
NO_DATA No useful information, nothing to be transmitted No useful information
* * *
TX_TYPE = "SPEECH_LOST" indicates that the Information Bit and Codec Mode
fields do not contain any useful data (but still should be transmitted over
AN). The purpose of this TX_TYPE is indicate that the frame was transmitted
but lost on some previous phase. This TX_TYPEs may occur only in TFO and TrFO
situations. Note, that it is possible to replace SPEECH_LOST with SPEECH_BAD
but this may degrade the quality of the error concealment in the receiving end
because concealment may try to use part of the received parameters from the
frame which do not contain any useful information.
TX_TYPE = "NO_DATA" indicates that the Information Bit and Codec Mode fields
do not contain any useful data (and should not be transmitted over AN). The
purpose of this TX_TYPE is to provide the option to save network transmission
between the transcoder and AN.
Note, the TX_TYPEs "SPEECH_BAD", "SPEECH_LOST" and "SID_BAD" may occur in TFO
and TrFO situations.
The scheduling of the frames for transmission on the Access Network is
controlled by the TX SCR handler by the use of the TX_TYPE field.
### 5.1.2 Functions of the TX SCR handler
If TX SCR operation is disabled, the TX SCR handler continuously generates
speech frames, i.e. frames marked with TX_TYPE="SPEECH_GOOD".
If the TX SCR operation is enabled, the VAD flag controls the TX SCR handler
operation as described in the following paragraphs.
#### 5.1.2.1 AMR-WB SCR Timing procedures
To allow an exact verification of the TX SCR handler functions, all frames
before the reset of the system are treated as if there were speech frames of
an infinitely long time. Therefore, and in order to ensure the correct
estimation of comfort noise parameters at RX SCR side, the first 7 frames
after the reset or after enabling the SCR operation shall always be marked
with TX_TYPE= \"SPEECH_GOOD\", even if VAD flag =\"0\" (hangover period, see
figure 3).
The Voice Activity Detector (VAD) shall operate all the time in order to
assess whether the input signal contains speech or not. The output is a binary
flag (VAD flag =\"1\" or VAD flag =\"0\", respectively) on a frame by frame
basis (see [7]).
The VAD flag controls indirectly, via the TX SCR handler operations described
below, the overall SCR operation on the transmit side.
Whenever VAD flag =\"1\", the speech encoder output frame along with mode
information shall be passed directly to the AN, marked with TX_TYPE =\"
SPEECH_GOOD \"
At the end of a speech burst (transition VAD flag =\"1\" to VAD flag =\"0\"),
it takes eight consecutive frames to make a new updated SID analysis available
(see [6]). Normally, the first seven speech encoder output frames after the
end of the speech burst shall therefore be passed directly to the AN, marked
with TX_TYPE =\" SPEECH_GOOD \" (\"hangover period\").
The end of the speech is then indicated by passing frame eight after the end
of the speech burst to the AN, marked with TX_TYPE = "SID_FIRST" (see figure
3). SID_FIRST frames do not contain data.
{width="6.325in" height="3.1597222222222223in"}
Figure 3: Normal hangover procedure for AMR-WB (Nelapsed > 23)
If, however, at the end of the speech burst, less than 24 frames have elapsed
since the last SID_UPDATE frame was computed, then this last analysed
SID_UPDATE frame should be passed to the AN whenever a SID_UPDATE frame is to
be produced, until a new updated SID analysis is available (8 consecutive
frames marked with VAD flag =\"0\").This reduces the load on the network in
cases where short background noise spikes are taken for speech, by avoiding
the \"hangover\" waiting for the SID frame computation.
Once the SID_FIRST frame has been passed to the AN, the TX SCR handler shall
at regular intervals compute and pass updated SID_UPDATE (Comfort Noise)
frames to the AN as long as VAD flag = \"0\". SID_UPDATE frames shall be
generated every 8^th^ frame. The first SID_UPDATE shall be sent as the third
frame after the SID_FIRST frame.
The speech encoder is operated in full speech modality if TX_TYPE = \"
SPEECH_GOOD \" and otherwise in a simplified mode, because not all encoder
functions are required for the evaluation of comfort noise parameters and
because comfort noise parameters are only to be generated at certain times.
### 5.1.3 The TX part of the AN
The TX part of the AN has the following overall functionality. The
transmission is cut after the transmission of a SID_FIRST frame when the
speaker stops talking. During speech pauses the transmission is resumed at
regular intervals for transmission of one SID_UPDATE frame, in order to update
the generated comfort noise on the RX side. The operation of
the TX part of the AN is controlled by the TX SCR handler via the TX_TYPE.
All frames, marked with SPEECH_GOOD, SID_FIRST or SID_UPDATE shall be
transmitted by the TX part of the AN.
## 5.2 Receive (RX) side
A block diagram of the receive side SCR functions is shown in Figure 3 below.
{width="5.625in" height="2.104861111111111in"}
Figure 4: Block diagram of the receive side SCR functions
### 5.2.1 General operation
The AN passes all the received traffic frames to the RX SCR handler,
classified with RX_TYPE, as described in Table 2 (see TS 26.201). The RX SCR
handles the frame accordingly.
Table 2: RX_TYPE identifiers for AMR-WB
* * *
**RX_TYPE** **Information Bits** **SPEECH_GOOD** Speech frame without detected
errors. **SPEECH_BAD** (likely) speech frame with bad CRC (or estimated to be
very bad by the RX part of the AN ) **SPEECH_LOST** No frame received.
Indicates that this frame was transmitted, but never received. **SID_FIRST**
This SID-frame marks the beginning of a comfort noise period. **SID_UPDATE**
Correct SID update frame **SID_BAD** Corrupt SID update frame (bad CRC;
applicable only for SID_UPDATE frames) **NO_DATA** Nothing useable was
received. The synthesis mode of the previous frame type is used.
* * *
### 5.2.3 Demands on the RX SCR handler
The RX SCR handler is responsible for the overall SCR operation on the RX
side. It consists of two main modes: SPEECH and COMFORT_NOISE. The initial
mode shall be SPEECH.
The SCR operation on the RX side shall be as follows:
\- The RX SCR handler shall enter mode SPEECH, when a frame classified as
SPEECH_GOOD is received.
Whenever a frame classified as SPEECH_GOOD is received the RX SCR handler
shall pass it directly on to the speech decoder;
\- if the RX SCR handler is in mode SPEECH, then frames classified as
SPEECH_BAD, SPEECH_LOST, or NO_DATA shall be substituted and muted as defined
in [5]. Frames classified as NO_DATA shall be handled like SPEECH_LOST frames
without valid speech information;
\- if the error concealment of RX SCR handler does not support the
RX_TYPE=SPEECH_LOST, then frames classified as SPEECH_LOST shall be
substituted with RX_TYPE=SPEECH_BAD;
\- frames classified as SID_FIRST, SID_UPDATE or SID_BAD shall bring the RX
SCR handler into mode COMFORT_NOISE and shall result in comfort noise
generation, as defined in [6]. SID_BAD frames shall be substituted and muted
as defined in [5];
\- in mode COMFORT_NOISE the RX SCR handler shall ignore all unusable frames
(NO_DATA, SPEECH_BAD); comfort noise generation shall continue, until timeout
may apply ([5]).
## 5.3 AMR-WB SID Information format
When the TX SCR handler is ordered by the network to operate in AMR-WB mode
with SCR operation enabled the SID_UPDATE frame format is according to [5].
This is the default and only mandatory operating mode of the SCR handler.
###### ## Annex A (normative): AMR-WB DTX handler for the GSM system
# A.1 Scope
The present document gives a description of the general baseband operation of
Adaptive Multi-Rate Wideband speech traffic channels in the transmitter and in
the receiver of GSM Mobile Stations (MS)s and Base Station Systems (BSS)s
during Discontinuous Transmission (DTX).
For clarity, the description is structured according to the block diagrams in
Figures 1 and 3. Except in the case described next, this structure of
distributing the various functions between system entities is not mandatory
for implementation, as long as the operation on the air interface and on the
speech decoder output remains the same.
In the case of BSSs where the speech transcoder is located remote from the
Base Transceiver Station (BTS), the implementation of the interfaces between
the DTX handlers and the Radio Sub System (RSS) as described in the present
document together with all their flags is mandatory, being part of the A‑bis
interface as described in GSM 08.60 and GSM 08.61.
The DTX functions described in this technical specification are mandatory for
implementation in the GSM MSs implementing the AMR-WB speech codec. The
receiver requirements are mandatory for implementation in all GSM BSSs
implementing the AMR-WB speech codec, the transmitter requirements only for
those BSSs where downlink DTX or Tandem Free Operation will be used.

# A.4 General
Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) is a mechanism, which allows the radio
transmitter to be switched off most of the time during speech pauses for the
following two purposes:
\- to save power in the Mobile Station (MS);
\- to reduce the overall interference level over the air interface.
DTX in uplink shall be in operation within the GSM MS, if commanded so by the
network, see 3GPP TS 24.008. The MS shall handle DTX in downlink at any time,
regardless, whether DTX in uplink is commanded or not.
## A.4.1 General organisation
The overall DTX mechanism described in the present document requires the
following functions:
\- a Voice Activity Detector (VAD) on the transmit (TX) side;
\- evaluation of the background acoustic noise on the transmit (TX) side, in
order to transmit characteristic parameters to the receive (RX) side;
\- generation on the receive (RX) side of a similar noise, called comfort
noise, during periods where the radio transmission is switched off.
The Voice Activity Detector (VAD) is defined in 3GPP TS 26.194 and the comfort
noise functions in 3GPP TS 26.192. Both are based partly on the speech
transcoder and its internal variables, defined in 3GPP TS 26.190.
In addition to these functions, if the parameters arriving at the RX side are
detected to be seriously corrupted by errors, the speech or comfort noise must
be generated from substituted data in order to avoid seriously annoying
effects for the listener. This function is defined in 3GPP TS 26.191.
An overall description of the speech processing parts can be found in 3GPP TS
26.171.
The description for Tandem Free Operation is given in 3GPP TS 28.062.

## A.5.1 General operation
The TX DTX handler passes traffic frames, individually marked by TX_TYPE, to
the Radio Subsystem (RSS). Each frame passed to the RSS consists of bit fields
containing the information bits, the codec mode indication, and the TX_TYPE.
TX_TYPE is used to specify the contents of the frame. The table below provides
an overview of the different TX_TYPEs used and explains the required contents
in the information bit and the mode indication bit fields. In case of ongoing
Tandem Free Operation (see 3GPP TS 28.062) frames with errors may arrive in
downlink in the BTS.

TX_TYPE = "SPEECH_LOST" indicates that the Information Bit and Codec Mode
fields do not contain any useful data (but still should be transmitted the air
interface). The purpose of this TX_TYPE is indicate that the frame was
transmitted but lost on some previous phase. This TX_TYPEs may occur only in
TFO and TrFO situations. Note, that it is possible to replace SPEECH_LOST with
SPEECH_BAD but this may degrade the quality of the error concealment in the
receiving end because concealment may try to use part of the received
parameters from the frame which do not contain any useful information.
TX_TYPE = "NO_DATA" indicates that the Information Bit and Codec Mode fields
do not contain any useful data (and shall not be transmitted over the air
interface). The purpose of this TX_TYPE is to provide the option to save
transmission between the transcoder and the radio base station if a packet
oriented transmission is used.
The scheduling of the frames for transmission on the air interface is
controlled by the TX DTX handler by the use of the TX_TYPE field.
### A.5.1.1 Functions of the TX DTX handler
To allow an exact verification of the TX DTX handler functions, all frames
before the reset of the system are treated as if there were speech frames of
an infinitely long time. Therefore, and in order to ensure the correct
estimation of comfort noise parameters at RX DTX side, the first 7 frames
after the reset or after enabling the DTX operation shall always be marked
with TX_TYPE= \" SPEECH_GOOD \", even if VAD flag =\"0\" (hangover period, see
figure 2).
The Voice Activity Detector (VAD) shall operate all the time in order to
assess whether the input signal contains speech or not. The output is a binary
flag (VAD flag =\"1\" or VAD flag =\"0\", respectively) on a frame by frame
basis (see 3GPP TS 26.194).
The VAD flag controls indirectly, via the TX DTX handler operations described
below, the overall DTX operation on the transmit side.
Whenever VAD flag =\"1\", the speech encoder output frame along with mode
information shall be passed directly to the radio subsystem (RSS), marked with
TX_TYPE =\" SPEECH_GOOD \"
At the end of a speech burst (transition VAD flag =\"1\" to VAD flag =\"0\"),
it takes 8 consecutive frames to make a new updated SID analysis available at
receiver side (see 3GPP TS 26.192). Normally, the first 7 speech encoder
output frames after the end of the speech burst shall therefore be passed
directly to the RSS, marked with TX_TYPE =\" SPEECH_GOOD \" (\"hangover
period\"). The end of the speech is then indicated by passing frame 8 after
the end of the speech burst to the RSS, marked with TX_TYPE = "SID_FIRST" (see
figure 2).
{width="6.325in" height="3.1597222222222223in"}
Figure 6: Normal hangover procedure (Nelapsed > 23)
If, however, at the end of the speech burst, less than 24 frames have elapsed
since the last SID_UPDATE frame was computed and passed to the RSS, then this
last analysed SID_UPDATE frame shall repeatedly be passed to the RSS whenever
a SID_UPDATE frame is to be produced, until a new updated SID analysis is
available (8 consecutive frames marked with VAD flag =\"0\").This reduces the
activity on the air in cases where short background noise spikes are taken for
speech, by avoiding the \"hangover\" waiting for the SID frame computation.
Once the first SID analysis after the end of a speech burst has been computed
and the SID_FIRST frame has been passed to the Radio Subsystem, the TX DTX
handler shall at regular intervals compute and pass updated SID_UPDATE
(Comfort Noise) frames to the Radio Subsystem (RSS) as long as VAD flag =
\"0\". SID_UPDATE frames shall be generated every 8^th^ frame. The first
SID_UPDATE shall be sent as the third frame after the SID_FIRST frame.
The speech encoder is operated in full speech modality if TX_TYPE = \"
SPEECH_GOOD \" and otherwise in a simplified mode, because not all encoder
functions are required for the evaluation of comfort noise parameters and
because comfort noise parameters are only to be generated at certain times.
In order to ensure TX/RX DTX handler synchronisation at handover, the uplink
TX DTX handler in the MS shall accept messages from TX RSS with control
parameter NSYNC, resulting in the following operation during a period of the
next NSYNC frames:
\- The TX DTX handler shall send SID_UPDATE instead of NO_DATA frames to the
TX RSS.
\- If, during this period of NSYNC frames, VAD flag is equal to 1 at least for
one speech frame, TX DTX handler shall send SPEECH frames for the rest of the
period of the NSYNC frames. Note the TX DTX handler shall send SPEECH frames
at least for the duration of the hangover period.
### A.5.1.2 Functions of the TX Radio Subsystem
The TX Radio Subsystem has the following overall functionality. The radio
transmission is cut after the transmission of a SID_FIRST frame when the
speaker stops talking. During speech pauses the transmission is resumed at
regular intervals for transmission of one SID_UPDATE frame, in order to update
the generated comfort noise on the RX side (and to improve the measurement of
the link quality by the RSS). Note that the transcoder knows what frames to
send. In the case when nothing is to be transmitted it outputs frames marked
with TX_TYPE = "NO_DATA".
Within the TX Radio Subsystem the TX_TYPE Monitoring unit controls the
operation of the Channel Encoder (as specified in 3GPP TS 25.003) and the
Transmission of the frame. Control input to the TX_TYPE Monitoring unit is the
TX_TYPE. Control output and input to the Channel Encoder are indicators
specifying the frame format. These frame format indicators are defined in 3GPP
TS 25.003.
#### A.5.1.2.1 Functions of the TX Radio Subsystem for TCH/WFS
The TX Radio Subsystem operates in the following way regarding DTX (without
TFO):
\- all frames marked with TX_TYPE = \" SPEECH_GOOD \" are scheduled for normal
channel coding and transmission. The frame format for CHE operation shall be
SPEECH. If, however, the previous frame was not of TX_TYPE = "SPEECH_GOOD", an
ONSET frame format followed by SPEECH_GOOD shall be signalled to the CHE;
\- for frames marked with TX_TYPE = "SID_FIRST" a SID_FIRST frame format is
signalled to the CHE;
\- frames marked with TX_TYPE = "SID_UPDATE" are scheduled for SID_UPDATE
frame channel coding and transmission. The frame format signalled to CHE is
SID_UPDATE;
\- for frames marked with TX_TYPE = "NO_DATA" no processing or transmission is
carried out.
If a SID_FIRST frame or a SID_UPDATE frame is stolen for Fast Associated
Control Channel (FACCH) signalling purposes, then the subsequent frame shall
be scheduled for transmission of the SID_FIRST or SID_UPDATE frame (whichever
applies) instead.
SPEECH frames shall override possible SID_FIRST or SID_UPDATE frames in
exceptional cases.
At handover, TX/RX DTX handler synchronisation shall be initiated. At the time
instant before the MS starts sending to the new base station, a message shall
be sent to the uplink TX DTX handler with the parameter NSYNC = 12.
#### A.5.1.2.2 Functions of the Downlink TX Radio Subsystem for TFO
The TX Radio Subsystem in the BTS shall in addition operate in the following
way regarding DTX, if TFO is ongoing (see 3GPP TS 28.062):
\- Frames with TX_TYPE = SPEECH_GOOD, SID_FIRST and SID_UPDATE shall be
handled as usual in DTX, regardless whether DTX in downlink is requested or
not. Also NO_DATA shall be handled as usual, if DTX is requested.
\- Frames with TX_TYPE = NO_DATA shall be replaced by SID_FILLER frames, if
DTX in downlink is not requested. By this the radio transmission continues in
downlink, although no parameters are transmitted in speech pauses on the Abis
interface. The MS generates Comfort Noise in these speech pauses.
\- Frames with TX_TYPE = SPEECH_DEGRADED shall be handled exactly like
SPEECH_GOOD frames.
\- For frame with TX_TYPE = SPEECH_BAD and SID_BAD the CHE shall perform its
regular processing, but then shall invert CRC bits before convolutional
encoding and transmitting the frames on the air interface. By this the error
concealment mechanism in the MS is triggered to handle these corrupted frames.
\- Frames with TX_TYPE = SPEECH_LOST shall be replaced by SPEECH_LOST_FILLER
frames, if DTX in downlink is not requested. By this the radio transmission
continues in downlink. The MS performs special lost frame handling operations
for the frame.
\- ONSET frames may be ignored by the TX Radio Subsystem and need not to be
processed.
**Definitions:\** SID_FILLER frames are like SID_BAD frames, but with all
information bits set to "1". The CRC bits shall artificially be inverted by
the CHE before convolutional encoding and transmission.\ SPEECH_LOST_FILLER
frames are like SPEECH_BAD frames, but with all information bits set to "1".
The CRC bits shall artificially be inverted by the CHE before convolutional
encoding and transmission.
#### A.5.1.2.4 Functions of the TX Radio Subsystem for RATSCCH
During regular speech transmission (in the middle of a speech burst) RATSCCH
replaces (steals) one speech frame (see 3GPP TS 25.009). Also in all non
speech cases the RATSCCH shall be handled like speech. The respective RATSCCH
frame formats shall be signalled to the CHE.
If RATSCCH has to be sent during a speech pause in DTX, then first an ONSET
frame shall be signalled to the CHE, followed by the RATSCCH frame and finally
by the respective SID_FIRST frame.
If a SID_UPDATE frame is affected by RATSCCH signalling, then the SID_UPDATE
frame shall be re-scheduled for transmission immediately after the RATSCCH
signalling.
FACCH should be handled in the same way as a RATSCCH, i.e. like a short speech
burst.

## A.6.1 General operation
Whatever their context (speech, SID, FACCH or none), the RSS continuously
passes the received traffic frames to the RX DTX handler, individually marked
by various pre‑processing functions with RX_TYPE as described in subclause
6.1.1 and table 2, which serves to classify the traffic frame. This
classification allows the RX DTX handler to determine in a simple way how the
received frame is to be handled.
Table 4: RX_TYPE identifiers
* * *
RX_TYPE Legend Description **SPEECH_GOOD** Speech frame with CRC OK, Channel
Decoder soft values also OK **SPEECH_DEGRADED** Speech frame with CRC OK, but
1B bits and class2 bits may be corrupted **SPEECH_BAD** (likely) speech frame,
bad CRC (or very bad Channel Decoder measures) **SPEECH_LOST** Nothing useable
(for the speech decoder) was received. Indicates that this frame was
transmitted, but never received **SID_FIRST** first SID marks the beginning of
a comfort noise period **SID_UPDATE** SID update frame (with correct CRC)
**SID_BAD** Corrupt SID update frame (bad CRC; applicable only for SID_UPDATE
frames) **ONSET** ONSET frames precede the first speech frame of a speech
burst **NO_DATA** Nothing useable (for the speech decoder) was received. This
applies for the cases of no received frames (DTX) or received FACCH or RATSCCH
or SID_FILLER signalling frames.

### A.6.1.1 Functions of the RX radio subsystem
The RX radio subsystem uses a combination of gross-bit markers, receiver
measurements, and CRC checks to classify each received frame. The basic
operation for each frame is outlined below:
\- the receiver first searches for the RATSCCH, SID_UPDATE, SID_FIRST or ONSET
gross bit markers.
> \- If the RATSCCH signalling is detected, then the RATSCCH frame shall be
> decoded and handled as described in 3GPP TS 25.009. They shall be passed to
> the RX DTX handler as a NO_DATA frame(s).
\- If the SID_FIRST marker is detected the frame is passed to the RX DTX
handler as a SID_FIRST frame.
\- If the SID_UPDATE marker is detected, then the frame shall be decoded and
passed to the RX DTX handler as a SID_UPDATE or a SID_BAD or a NO_DATA frame,
depending on the CRC and the information bits, along with the comfort noise
parameters, if applicable. A NO_DATA frame shall be passed on, if all
information bits of a SID_UPDATE frame are set to "1" and the CRC is bad (see
SID_FILLER in subclause 5.1.2.2).
  * If the ONSET marker is detected, then an ONSET frame shall be passed to the RX DTX handler.
\- if neither SID_UPDATE nor SID_FIRST markers are detected, the frame shall
be channel decoded assuming it to be a speech frame. A speech frame shall be
passed on, if all information bits of speech frame are set to "1" and the CRC
is bad (see SPEECH_LOST_FILLER in subclause 5.1.2.2). Depending on the CRC for
speech frame channel decoding along with other receiver measurements the frame
shall then be passed to the RX DTX handler marked as either SPEECH_GOOD,
SPEECH_ DEGRADED, SPEECH_BAD, NO_DATA or SPEECH_LOST frame.
### A.6.1.2 Functions of the RX DTX handler
The RX DTX handler is responsible for the overall DTX operation on the RX
side. It consists of two main modes: SPEECH and COMFORT_NOISE. The initial
mode shall be SPEECH.
The DTX operation on the RX side shall be as follows:
\- The RX DTX handler shall enter mode SPEECH, when a frame classified as
SPEECH_GOOD or SPEECH_DEGRADED is received. ONSET frames may be taken into
account to identify the beginning of a speech burst;
\- whenever a frame classified as SPEECH_GOOD is received the RX DTX handler
shall pass it directly on to the speech decoder;
\- if the RX DTX handler is in mode SPEECH, then frames classified as
SPEECH_DEGRADED, SPEECH_BAD, SPEECH_LOST or NO_DATA shall be substituted and
muted as defined in 3GPP TS 26.191. Frames classified as NO_DATA shall be
handled like SPEECH_LOST frames without valid speech information;
\- if the error concealment of RX SCR handler does not support the
RX_TYPE=SPEECH_LOST, then frames classified as SPEECH_LOST shall be
substituted with RX_TYPE=SPEECH_BAD.
Frames classified as SID_FIRST, SID_UPDATE or SID_BAD shall bring the RX DTX
handler into mode COMFORT_NOISE and shall result in comfort noise generation,
as defined in 3GPP TS 26.192. SID_BAD frames shall be substituted and muted as
defined in 3GPP TS 26.191. In mode COMFORT_NOISE the RX DTX handler shall
ignore all unusable frames (NO_DATA, SPEECH_BAD, SPEECH_LOST) delivered by the
RSS; comfort noise generation shall continue, until timeout may apply (see
3GPP TS 26.191).
