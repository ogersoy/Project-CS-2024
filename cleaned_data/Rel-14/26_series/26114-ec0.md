# Introduction
Multimedia Telephony Service for IMS (MTSI), here also referred to as
Multimedia Telephony, is a standardized IMS telephony service that builds on
the IMS capabilities to establish multimedia communications between terminals
within and in-between operator networks. The terminals connect to the IMS
using either a fixed access network or a 3GPP access network.
The objective of defining a service is to specify the minimum set of
capabilities required in the IP Multimedia Subsystem to secure multi-vendor
and multi-operator inter-operability for Multimedia Telephony and related
Supplementary Services. The objective also includes defining procedures for
inter-working between different clients and networks.
The user experience of multimedia telephony is expected to be equivalent to or
better than corresponding circuit-switched telephony services. Multimedia
telephony also exploits the richer capabilities of IMS. In particular,
multiple media components can be used and dynamically added or dropped during
a session.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies a client for the Multimedia Telephony Service
for IMS (MTSI) supporting conversational speech (including DTMF), video and
text transported over RTP with the scope to deliver a user experience
equivalent to or better than that of Circuit Switched (CS) conversational
services using the same amount of network resources. It defines media handling
(e.g. signalling, transport, jitter buffer management, packet-loss handling,
adaptation), as well as interactivity (e.g. adding or dropping media during a
call). The focus is to ensure a reliable and interoperable service with a
predictable media quality, while allowing for flexibility in the service
offerings.
The present document describes two client types:
\- An MTSI client in terminal which uses a 3GPP access (LTE, HSPA, or EGPRS)
to connect to the IMS. These clients are described in Clauses 5 \-- 17 and
Annexes A -- M.
\- An MTSI client in terminal which uses a fixed access (corded interface,
fixed-wireless interface, e.g. Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or DECT/NG DECT) to connect to
the IMS. These clients are described in Clause 18.
MTSI clients using 3GPP access and MTSI clients using fixed access have many
common procedures for the media handling. This specification aligns the media
handling by using cross references whenever possible. This does not mean that
3GPP terminals must support fixed access, nor does it mean that fixed
terminals must support 3GPP access.
The scope includes maintaining backward compatibility in order to ensure
seamless inter-working with existing services available in the CS domain, such
as CS speech and video telephony, as well as with terminals of earlier 3GPP
releases. In addition, inter-working with other IMS and non-IMS IP networks as
well as traditional PSTN is covered.
The client may also support the IMS Messaging service and Group 3 facsimile
transmission. The scope therefore also includes media handling for non-
conversational media using MSRP and UDPTL-based Facsimile over IP (FoIP).
The specification is written in a forward-compatible way in order to allow
additions of media components and functionality in releases after Release 7.
NOTE 1: MTSI clients can support more than conversational speech, video and
text, which is the scope of the present document. See 3GPP TS 22.173 [2] for
the definition of the Multimedia Telephony Service for IMS.
NOTE 2: 3GPP TS 26.235 [3] and 3GPP TS 26.236 [4] do not include the
specification of an MTSI client, although they include conversational
multimedia applications. Only those parts of 3GPP TS 26.235 [3] and 3GPP TS
26.236 [4] that are specifically referenced by the present document apply to
Multimedia Telephony Service for IMS.
NOTE 3: The present document was started as a conclusion from the study in
3GPP TR 26.914 [5] on optimization opportunities in Multimedia Telephony for
IMS (3GPP TR 22.973 [6]).
NOTE 4: For ECN, the present specification assumes that an interface enables
the MTSI client to read and write the ECN field. This interface is outside the
scope of this specification.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply:
NOTE: A term defined in the present document takes precedence over the
definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**example:** text used to clarify abstract rules by applying them literally.
**AMR, AMR-NB:** Both names refer to the AMR codec (3GPP TS 26.071 [11]) and
are used interchangeably in this specification.
**Codec mode:** Used for the AMR and AMR-WB codecs to identify one specific
bitrate. For example AMR includes 8 codec modes (excluding SID), each of
different bitrate.
**Dual-mono:** A variant of 2-channel stereo encoding where two instances of a
mono codec are used to encode a 2-channel stereo signal.
**Evolved UTRAN:** Evolved UTRAN is an evolution of the 3G UMTS radio-access
network towards a high-data-rate, low-latency and packet-optimized radio-
access network.
**EVS codec:** The EVS codec includes two operational modes: EVS Primary
operational mode ('EVS Primary mode') and EVS AMR-WB Inter-Operable ('EVS AMR-
WB IO mode'). When using EVS AMR-WB IO mode the speech frames are bitstream
interoperable with the AMR-WB codec [18]. Frames generated by an EVS AMR-WB IO
mode encoder can be decoded by an AMR-WB decoder, without the need for
transcoding. Likewise, frames generated by an AMR-WB encoder can be decoded by
an EVS AMR-WB IO mode decoder, without the need for transcoding.
**EVS Primary mode:** Includes 11 bit-rates for fixed-rate or multi-rate
operation; 1 average bit-rate for variable bit-rate operation; and 1 bit-rate
for SID (3GPP TS 26.441 [121]). The EVS Primary can encode narrowband,
wideband, super-wideband and fullband signals. None of these bit-rates are
interoperable with the AMR-WB codec.
**EVS AMR-WB IO mode:** Includes 9 codec modes and SID. All are bitstream
interoperable with the AMR-WB codec (3GPP TS 26.171 ‎‎[17]).
**Frame Loss Rate (FLR):** The percentage of speech frames not delivered to
the decoder. FLR includes speech frames that are not received in time to be
used for decoding.
**Mode-set:** Used for the AMR and AMR-WB codecs to identify the codec modes
that can be used in a session. A mode-set can include one or more codec modes.
**MSMTSI client:** A multi-stream capable MTSI client supporting multiple
streams as defined in Annex S. An MTSI client may support multiple streams,
even of the same media type, without being an MSMTSI client. Such an MTSI
client may, for example, add a second video to an ongoing video telephony
session as shown in Annex A.11. In that case, the MTSI client is an MSMTSI
client only if it is fully compliant with Annex S.
**MSMTSI MRF:** An MSMTSI client implemented by functionality included in the
MRFC and the MRFP.
**MSMTSI client in terminal:** An MSMTSI client that is implemented in a
terminal or UE. The term \"MSMTSI client in terminal\" is used in this
document when entities such as MRFP, MRFC or media gateways are excluded.
**MTSI client:** A function in a terminal or in a network entity (e.g. a MRFP)
that supports MTSI.
**MTSI client in terminal:** An MTSI client that is implemented in a terminal
or UE. The term "MTSI client in terminal" is used in this document when
entities such as MRFP, MRFC or media gateways are excluded.
**MTSI media gateway (or MTSI MGW):** A media gateway that provides
interworking between an MTSI client and a non MTSI client, e.g. a CS UE. The
term MTSI media gateway is used in a broad sense, as it is outside the scope
of the current specification to make the distinction whether certain
functionality should be implemented in the MGW or in the MGCF.
**Operational mode:** Used for the EVS codec to distinguish between EVS
Primary mode and EVS AMR-WB IO mode.
**Simulcast:** Simultaneously sending different encoded representations
(simulcast formats) of a single media source (e.g. originating from a single
microphone or camera) in different simulcast streams.
**Simulcast format:** The encoded format used by a single simulcast stream,
typically represented by an SDP format and all SDP attributes that apply to
that particular SDP format, indicated in RTP by the RTP header payload type
field.
**Simulcast stream:** The RTP stream carrying a single simulcast format in a
simulcast.

# 4 System description
## 4.1 System
A Multimedia Telephony Service for IMS call uses the Call Session Control
Function (CSCF) mechanisms to route control‑plane signalling between the UEs
involved in the call (see figure 4.1). In the control plane, Application
Servers (AS) should be present and may provide supplementary services such as
call hold/resume, call forwarding and multi‑party calls, etc.
The scope of the present document is to specify the media path. In the example
in figure 4.1, it is routed directly between the PS Domains outside the IMS.
Figure 4.1: High-level architecture figure showing two MTSI clients in
terminals using 3GPP access involved in an MTSI call set-up. The terminals
connect to the IMS network over a 3GPP radio access network.
The call setup for an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access is the same
as shown in Figure 4.1 for 3GPP terminals except that a fixed access is used
instead of the 3GPP access and that the PS Domain is not necessarily used.
## 4.2 Client
The functional components of a terminal including an MTSI client in terminal
using 3GPP access are shown in figure 4.2. An MTSI client in terminal using
fixed access can have the same functional components except that it does not
have any 3GPP Layer 2 protocol.
NOTE: The grey box marks the scope of the present document.
Figure 4.2: Functional components of a terminal including an MTSI client in
terminal using 3GPP access
The scope of the present document is to specify media handling and
interaction, which includes media control, media codecs, as well as transport
of media and control data. General control-related elements of an MTSI client,
such as SIP signalling (3GPP TS 24.229 [7]), fall outside this scope, albeit
parts of the session setup handling and session control for conversational
media are defined here:
\- usage of SDP (RFC 4566 [8]) and SDP capability negotiation (SDPCapNeg [69])
in SIP invitations for capability negotiation and media stream setup.
\- set-up and control of the individual media streams between clients. It also
includes interactivity, such as adding and dropping of media components.
Transport of media consists of the encapsulation of the coded media in a
transport protocol as well as handling of coded media received from the
network. This is shown in figure 4.2 as the \"packet based network interface\"
and is displayed, for conversational media, in more detail in the user-plane
protocol stack in figure 4.3. The basic MTSI client defined here specifies
media codecs for speech, video and text (see clause 5). All conversational
media components are transported over RTP with each respective payload format
mapped onto the RTP (RFC 3550 [9]) streams.
Figure 4.3: User plane protocol stack for a basic MTSI client
An MTSI client may also support non-conversational media, for example IMS
messaging. The functional entities and the protocols used for IMS messaging
are described in 3GPP TS 24.247 [82].
## 4.3 MRFP and MGW
A Media Resource Function Processor (MRFP), see 3GPP TS.23.002 [47], may be
inserted in the media path for certain supplementary services (e.g.
conference) and/or to provide transcoding and may therefore act as a MTSI
client together with other network functions, such as a MRFC.
A Media Gateway (MGW), see 3GPP TS 23.002 [47], may be used to provide inter-
working between different networks and services. For example, a MTSI MGW may
provide inter-working between MTSI and 3G-324M services. The MTSI MGW may have
more limited functionality than other MTSI clients, e.g. when it comes to the
supported bitrates of media. The inter-working aspects are described in more
detail in clause 12.
# 5 Media codecs
## 5.1 Media components
The Multimedia Telephony Service for IMS supports simultaneous transfer of
multiple media components with real-time characteristics. Media components
denote the actual components that the end-user experiences.
The following media components are considered as core components. Multiple
media components (including media components of the same media type) may be
present in a session. At least one of these components is present in all
conversational multimedia telephony sessions.
**\- Speech:** The sound that is picked up by a microphone and transferred
from terminal A to terminal B and played out in an earphone/loudspeaker.
Speech includes detection, transport and generation of DTMF events.
**\- Video:** The moving image that is, for example, captured by a camera of
terminal A, transmitted to terminal B and, for example, rendered on the
display of terminal B.
**\- Text:** The characters typed on a keyboard or drawn on a screen on
terminal A and rendered in real time on the display of terminal B. The flow is
time-sampled so that no specific action is needed from the user to request
transmission.
The above core media components are transported in real time from one MTSI
client to the other using RTP (IETF RFC 3550 [9]). All media components can be
added or dropped during an ongoing session as required either by the end-user
or by controlling nodes in the network, assuming that when adding components,
the capabilities of the MTSI client support the additional component.
NOTE: The terms voice and speech are synonyms. The present document uses the
term speech. The media type is called "audio" in SDP and therefore also the
term \"audio\" is used as synonym.
MTSI specifications also support other media types than the core components
described above, for example facsimile (fax) transmission.
Facsimile transmission is described in Annex L.
## 5.2 Codecs for MTSI clients in terminals
### 5.2.1 Speech
#### 5.2.1.1 General codec requirements
MTSI clients in terminals offering speech communication shall support:
\- AMR codec (3GPP TS 26.071 [11], 3GPP TS 26.090 [12], 3GPP TS 26.073 [13]
and 3GPP TS 26.104 [14]) including all 8 modes and source controlled rate
operation ‎3GPP TS 26.093 [15]. The MTSI client in terminal shall be capable
of operating with any subset of these 8 codec modes. More detailed codec
requirements for the AMR codec are defined in clause 5.2.1.2.
\- telephone-event codec (IETF RFC 4733 [61]) as described in Annex G.
MTSI clients in terminal offering speech communication should support:
\- EVS codec (3GPP TS 26.441 [121], 3GPP TS 26.445 [125], 3GPP TS 26.442
[122], 3GPP TS 26.446 [126] and 3GPP TS 26.443 [123]) including functions for
backwards compatibility with AMR-WB (3GPP TS 26.446 [126]) and discontinuous
transmission (3GPP TS 26.450 [130]). More detailed codec requirements for the
EVS codec are defined in in clause 5.2.1.4.
MTSI clients in terminals offering wideband speech communication at 16 kHz
sampling frequency shall support:
\- AMR-WB codec (3GPP TS 26.171 ‎‎[17], 3GPP TS 26.190 ‎[18], 3GPP TS 26.173
‎[19] and 3GPP TS 26.204 [20]) including all 9 modes and source controlled
rate operation ‎3GPP TS 26.193 [21]. The MTSI client in terminal shall be
capable of operating with any subset of these 9 codec modes. More detailed
codec requirements for the AMR-WB codec are defined in clause 5.2.1.3. When
the EVS codec is supported, the EVS AMR-WB IO mode may serve as an alternative
implementation of AMR-WB as defined in clause 5.2.1.4.
MTSI clients in terminals offering super-wideband or fullband speech
communication shall support:
\- EVS codec (3GPP TS 26.441 [121], 3GPP TS 26.445 [125], 3GPP TS 26.442 [122]
and 3GPP TS 26.443 [123] as described below including functions for backwards
compatibility with AMR-WB (3GPP TS 26.446 [126]) and discontinuous
transmission (3GPP TS 26.450 [130]). More detailed codec requirements for the
EVS codec are defined in in cluause 5.2.1.4.
Encoding of DTMF is described in Annex G.
#### 5.2.1.2 Detailed codec requirements, AMR
When transmitting, the MTSI client in terminal shall be capable of aligning
codec mode changes to every frame border, and shall also be capable of
restricting codec mode changes to be aligned to every other frame border, e.g.
like UMTS_AMR_2 (3GPP TS 26.103 [16]). The MTSI client in terminal shall also
be capable of restricting codec mode changes to neighbouring codec modes
within the negotiated codec mode set. When receiving, the MTSI client in
terminal shall allow codec mode changes at any frame border and to any codec
mode within the negotiated codec mode set.
The codec modes and the other codec parameters (mode-change-capability, mode-
change-period, mode-change-neighbor, etc), applicable for each session, are
negotiated as described in clauses 6.2.2.2 and 6.2.2.3.
#### 5.2.1.3 Detailed codec requirements, AMR-WB
When transmitting, the MTSI client in terminal shall be capable of aligning
codec mode changes to every frame border, and shall also be capable of
restricting codec mode changes to be aligned to every other frame border, e.g.
like UMTS_AMR_WB‎ (3GPP TS 26.103 [16]). The MTSI client in terminal shall
also be capable of restricting codec mode changes to neighbouring codec modes
within the negotiated codec mode set. When receiving, the MTSI client in
terminal shall allow codec mode changes at any frame border and to any codec
mode within the negotiated codec mode set.
The codec modes and the other codec parameters (mode-change-capability, mode-
change-period, mode-change-neighbor, etc), applicable for each session, are
negotiated as described in clauses 6.2.2.2 and 6.2.2.3.
#### 5.2.1.4 Detailed codec requirements, EVS
When the EVS codec is supported, the MTSI client in terminal may support dual-
mono encoding and decoding.
When the EVS codec is supported, EVS AMR-WB IO may serve as an alternative
implementation of the AMR-WB codec, [125]. In this case, the requirements and
recommendations defined in this specification for the AMR-WB codec also apply
to EVS AMR-WB IO.
#### 5.2.1.5 Offering multiple audio bandwidths and multiple channels
MTSI clients in terminals offering wideband speech communication shall also
offer narrowband speech communications.
When offering super-wideband speech, both wideband speech and narrowband
speech shall also be offered. When offering fullband speech, super-wideband
speech, wideband speech and narrowband speech shall also be offered.
MTSI clients in terminals offering dual-mono, shall also offer mono.
#### 5.2.1.6 Codec preference order
When offering both wideband speech and narrowband speech communication,
payload types offering wideband shall be listed before payload types offering
only narrowband speech in the 'm=' line of the SDP offer (RFC 4566 [8]).
When offering super-wideband speech, wideband and narrowband speech
communication, payload types offering super-wideband shall be listed before
payload types offering lower bandwidths than super-wideband speech in the 'm='
line of the SDP offer (RFC 4566 [8]).
For an MTSI client in terminal supporting EVS the following rules apply when
creating the list of payload types on the m= line:
\- When the EVS codec is offered for NB by an MTSI client in terminal
supporting NB only, it shall be listed before other NB codecs.
\- When the EVS codec is offered for up to WB, it shall be listed before other
WB codecs.
When dual-mono is offered then this may be preferable over mono depending on
the call scenario.
### 5.2.2 Video
MTSI clients in terminals offering video communication shall support:
\- H.264 (AVC) [24] Constrained Baseline Profile (CBP) Level 1.2.
In addition they should support:
\- H.264 (AVC) [24] Constrained High Profile (CHP) Level 3.1.
\- H.265 (HEVC) [119] Main Profile, Main Tier, Level 3.1.
For backwards compatibility to previous releases, if H.264 (AVC) [24]
Constrained High Profile Level 3.1 is supported, then H.264 (AVC) [24]
Constrained Baseline Profile (CBP) Level 3.1 should also be offered.
H.264 (AVC) shall be used without requirements on output timing conformance
(annex C of [24]). Each sequence parameter set of H.264 (AVC) shall contain
the vui_parameters syntax structure including the num_reorder_frames syntax
element set equal to 0.
H.265 (HEVC) Main Profile shall be used with general_progressive_source_flag
equal to 1, general_interlaced_source_flag equal to 0,
general_non_packed_constraint_flag equal to 1,
general_frame_only_constraint_flag equal to 1, and sps_max_num_reorder_pics[ i
] equal to 0 for all i in the range of 0 to sps_max_sub_layers_minus1,
inclusive, without requirements on output timing conformance (annex C of
[119]).
For both H.264 (AVC) and H.265 (HEVC), the decoder needs to know the Sequence
Parameter Set (SPS) and the Picture Parameter Set (PPS) to be able to decode
the received video packets. A compliant H.265 (HEVC) bitstream must include a
Video Parameter Set (VPS), although the VPS may be ignored by the decoder in
the context of the present specification. When H.264 (AVC) or H.265 (HEVC) is
used it is recommended to transmit the parameter sets within the SDP
description of a stream, using the relevant MIME/SDP parameters as defined in
RFC6184 [25] for H.264 (AVC) and in [120] for H.265 (HEVC), respectively. Each
media source (SSRC) shall transmit the currently used parameter sets at least
once in the beginning of the RTP stream before being referenced by the encoded
video data to ensure that the parameter sets are available when needed by the
receiver. If the video encoding is changed during an ongoing session such that
the previously used parameter set(s) are no longer sufficient then the new
parameter sets shall be transmitted at least once in the RTP stream prior to
being referenced by the encoded video data to ensure that the parameter sets
are available when needed by the receiver. When a specific version of a
parameter set is sent in the RTP stream for the first time, it should be
repeated at least 3 times in separate RTP packets with a single copy per RTP
packet and with an interval not exceeding 0.5 seconds to reduce the impact of
packet loss. A single copy of the currently active parameter sets shall also
be part of the data sent in the RTP stream as a response to FIR. Moreover, it
is recommended to avoid using a sequence or picture parameter set identifier
value during the same session to signal two or more parameter sets of the same
type having different values, such that if a parameter set identifier for a
certain type is used more than once in either SDP description or RTP stream,
or both, the identifier always indicates the same set of parameter values of
that type.
The video decoder in a multimedia MTSI client in terminal shall either start
decoding immediately when it receives data, even if the stream does not start
with an IDR/IRAP access unit (IDR access unit for H.264, IRAP access unit for
H.265) or alternatively no later than it receives the next IDR/IRAP access
unit or the next recovery point SEI message, whichever is earlier in decoding
order. The decoding process for a stream not starting with an IDR/IRAP access
unit shall be the same as for a valid video bit stream. However, the MTSI
client in terminal shall be aware that such a stream may contain references to
pictures not available in the decoded picture buffer. The display behaviour of
the MTSI client in terminal is out of scope of the present document.
An MTSI client in terminal offering H.264 (AVC) CBP support at a level higher
than Level 1.2 shall support negotiation to use a lower Level as described in
[25] and [58].
An MTSI client in terminal offering H.264 (AVC) CHP support at a level higher
than Level 3.1 shall support negotiation to use a lower Level as described in
[25] and [58].
An MTSI client in terminal offering video support other than H.264 CBP Level
1.2 shall also offer H.264 CBP Level 1.2.
An MTSI client in terminal offering video support for H.265 (HEVC) [119] Main
Profile, Main Tier, Level 3.1, should normally set it to be preferred.
An MTSI client in terminal offering H.265 (HEVC) shall support negotiation to
use a lower Level than the one in the offer, as described in [120] and [58].
If a codec is supported at a certain level, then all (hierarchically) lower
levels shall be supported as well.
NOTE 1: An example of a lower level than Level 1.2 is Level 1 for H.264 (AVC)
Constrained Baseline Profile.
NOTE 2: All levels are minimum requirements. Higher levels may be supported
and used for negotiation.
NOTE 3: MTSI clients in terminals may use full-frame freeze and full-frame
freeze release SEI messages of H.264 (AVC) to control the display process. For
H.265 (HEVC), MTSI clients may set the value of pic_output_flag in the slice
segment headers to either 0 or 1 to control the display process.
NOTE 4: An H.264 (AVC) encoder should code redundant slices only if it knows
that the far-end decoder makes use of this feature (which is signalled with
the redundant-pic-cap MIME/SDP parameter as specified in RFC 6184 [25]). H.264
(AVC) encoders should also pay attention to the potential implications on
end‑to‑end delay. The redundant slice header is not supported in H.265 (HEVC).
NOTE 5: If a codec is supported at a certain level, it implies that on the
receiving side, the decoder is required to support the decoding of bitstreams
up to the maximum capability of this level. On the sending side, the support
of a particular level does not imply that the encoder will produce a bitstream
up to the maximum capability of the level. This method can be used to set up
an asymmetric video stream. For H.264 (AVC), another method is to use the SDP
parameters 'level-asymmetry-allowed' and 'max-recv-level' that are defined in
the H.264 payload format specification, [25]. For H.265 (HEVC) it is possible
to use the SDP parameter 'max-recv-level-id' defined in the H.265 payload
format specification, [120], to indicate a higher level in the receiving
direction than in the sending direction. See also clause 6.2.3.2, Annex A.4.5
for SDP examples with asymmetric video using H.264 (AVC) and Annex A.4.8 for
SDP examples with asymmetric video using both H.264 (AVC) and H.265 (HEVC).
Other methods for asymmetric video transmission are also possible.
NOTE 6: If video is used in a session, an MTSI client in terminal should offer
at least one video stream with a picture aspect ratio in the range from 0.7 to
1.4. For all offered video streams, the width and height of the picture should
be integer multiples of 16 pixels. For example, 224x176, 272x224, and 320x240
are image sizes that satisfy these conditions.
NOTE 7: For H.264 (AVC) and H.265 (HEVC), respectively, multiple sequence and
picture parameter sets can be defined, as long as they have unique parameter
set identifiers, but only one sequence and picture parameter set can be active
between two consecutive IDRs and IRAPs, respectively.
### 5.2.3 Real-time text
MTSI clients in terminals offering real time text conversation shall support:
\- ITU-T Recommendation T.140 [26] and [27].
T.140 specifies coding and presentation features of real-time text usage. Text
characters are coded according to the UTF-8 transform of ISO 10646-1
(Unicode).
A minimal subset of the Unicode character set, corresponding to the Latin-1
part shall be supported, while the languages in the regions where the MTSI
client in terminal is intended to be used should be supported.
Presentation control functions from ISO 6429 are allowed in the T.140 media
stream. A mechanism for extending control functions is included in ITU-T
Recommendation T.140 [26] and [27]. Any received non-implemented control code
must not influence presentation.
A MTSI client in terminal shall store the conversation in a presentation
buffer during a call for possible scrolling, saving, display re-arranging,
erasure, etc. At least 800 characters shall be kept in the presentation buffer
during a call.
Note that erasure (backspace) of characters is included in the T.140 editing
control functions. It shall be possible to erase all characters in the
presentation buffer. The display of the characters in the buffer shall also be
impacted by the erasure.
# 6 Media configuration
## 6.1 General
MTSI uses SIP, SDP and SDPCapNeg for media negotiation and configuration.
General SIP signalling and session setup for IMS are defined in 3GPP TS 24.229
[7], whereas this clause specifies SDP and SDPCapNeg usage and media handling
specifically for MTSI, including offer/answer considerations in the capability
negotiation. The MTSI client in the terminal may use the OMA-DM solution
specified in Clause 15 for enhancing SDP negotiation and resource reservation
process.
The support for ECN [83] in E-UTRAN is specified in [85]. The support for ECN
in UTRA/HSPA is specified in [89]. MTSI may use Explicit Congestion
Notification (ECN) to perform rate adaptation for speech and video. When the
MTSI client in terminal supports, and the session allows, adapting the media
encoding at multiple bit rates and the radio access bearer technology is known
to the MTSI client to be E-UTRAN or UTRA/HSPA, the MTSI client may negotiate
the use of ECN [83] to perform ECN triggered media bit-rate adaptation. An
MTSI MGW supporting ECN supports ECN in the same way as the MTSI client in
terminal as described in clauses 12.3.3 and 12.7.3.
The support of ECN is optional for both MTSI client in terminal and MTSI MGW.
It is assumed that the network properly handles ECN-marked packets as
described in [84] end-to-end between the MTSI clients in terminals.
An MTSI MGW can be used for inter-working with:
> • a client that does not use ECN;
>
> • a client that supports ECN in different way than what is specified for
> MTSI clients;
>
> • a CS network;
>
> • a network which does not handle ECN-marked packets properly.
In such cases, the ECN protocol, as specified for MTSI clients, is terminated
in the MTSI MGW.
## 6.2 Session setup procedures
### 6.2.1 General
The session setup for RTP transported media shall determine for each media: IP
address(es), RTP profile, UDP port number(s); codec(s); RTP Payload Type
number(s), RTP Payload Format(s). The session setup may also determine: ECN
usage and any additional session parameters.
The session setup for UDP transported media without RTP shall determine: IP
address(es), UDP port number(s) and additional session parameters.
The session setup for RTP transported media shall, when the port number is not
set to zero, determine the maximum bandwidth that is allowed in the session,
see also clause 6.2.5. The maximum bandwidth for the receiving direction is
specified with the "b=AS" bandwidth modifier. Additional requirements and/or
recommendations on the bandwidth negotiation are found in clause 6.2.2.1 for
speech and in clause 6.2.3.2 for video.
An MTSI client shall offer at least one RTP profile for each RTP media stream.
Multiple RTP profiles may be offered using SDPCapNeg as described in Clause
6.2.1a. For voice and real-time text, the first SDP offer shall include at
least the AVP profile. For video, the first SDP offer for a media type shall
include at least the AVPF profile. Subsequent SDP offers may include only
other RTP profiles if it is known from a preceding offer that this RTP profile
is supported by the answerer. The MTSI client shall be capable of receiving an
SDP offer containing both AVP and AVPF offers in order to support
interworking.
The configuration of ECN for media transported with RTP is described in clause
6.2.2 for speech and in clause 6.2.3.2 for video. The negotiation of ECN at
session setup is described in [84]. The adaptation response to congestion
events is described in clause 10.
### 6.2.1a RTP profile negotiation
#### 6.2.1a.1 General
MTSI clients should support SDPCapNeg to be able to negotiate RTP profiles for
all media types where AVPF is supported. MTSI clients supporting SDPCapNeg
shall support the complete SDPCapNeg framework.
SDPCapNeg is described in [69]. This clause only describes the SDPCapNeg
attributes that are directly applicable for the RTP profile negotiation, i.e.
the tcap, pcfg and acfg attributes. TS 24.229 [7] may outline further
requirements needed for supporting SDPCapNeg in SDP messages.
NOTE: This clause describes only how to use the SDPCapNeg framework for RTP
profile negotiation using the tcap, pcfg and acfg attributes. Implementers may
therefore (incorrectly) assume that it is sufficient to implement only those
specific parts of the framework that are needed for RTP profile negotiation.
Doing so would however not be future proof since future versions may use other
parts of the framework and there are currently no mechanisms for declaring
that only a subset of the framework is supported. Hence, MTSI clients are
required to support the complete framework.
#### 6.2.1a.2 Using SDPCapNeg in SDP offer
For voice and real-time text, SDPCapNeg shall be used when offering AVPF the
first time for a new media type in the session since the support for AVPF in
the answering client is not known at this stage. For video, an MTSI client
shall either offer AVPF and AVP together using SDPCapNeg, or the MTSI client
shall offer only AVPF without using SDPCapNeg. If an MTSI client has offered
only AVPF for video, and then receives as response either an SDP answer where
the video media component has been rejected, or an SIP 488 or 606 failure
response with an SDP body indicating that only AVP is supported for video
media, the MTSI client should send a new SDP offer with AVP as transport for
video. Subsequent SDP offers, in a re-INVITE or UPDATE, may offer AVPF without
SDPCapNeg if it is known from an earlier re-INVITE or UPDATE that the
answering client supports this RTP profile. If the offer includes only AVP
then SDPCapNeg does not need to be used, which can occur for: text; speech if
RTCP is not used; and in re-INVITEs or UPDATEs where the RTP profile has
already been negotiated for the session in a preceding INVITE or UPDATE.
When offering AVP and AVPF using SDPCapNeg, the MTSI client shall offer AVP on
the media (m=) line and shall offer AVPF using SDPCapNeg mechanisms. The
SDPCapNeg mechanisms are used as follows:
\- The support for AVPF is indicated in an attribute (a=) line using the
transport capability attribute 'tcap'. AVPF shall be preferred over AVP.
\- At least one configuration using AVPF shall be listed using the attribute
for potential configurations 'pcfg'.
#### 6.2.1a.3 Answering to an SDP offer using SDPCapNeg
An invited MTSI client should accept using AVPF whenever supported. If AVPF is
to be used in the session then the MTSI client:
\- Shall select one configuration out of the potential configurations defined
in the SDP offer for using AVPF.
\- Indicate in the media (m=) line of the SDP answer that the profile to use
is AVPF.
\- Indicate the selected configuration for using AVPF in the attribute for
actual configurations 'acfg'.
If AVP is to be used then the MTSI shall not indicate any SDPCapNeg attributes
for using AVPF in the SDP answer.
### 6.2.2 Speech
#### 6.2.2.1 General
For AMR or AMR-WB encoded media, the session setup shall determine the
applicable bandwidth(s) as defined in clause 6.2.5, what RTP profile to use;
if all codec modes can be used or if the operation needs to be restricted to a
subset; if the bandwidth-efficient payload format can be used or if the octet-
aligned payload format must be used; if codec mode changes shall be restricted
to be aligned to only every other frame border or if codec mode changes can
occur at any frame border; if codec mode changes must be restricted to only
neighbouring modes within the negotiated codec mode set or if codec mode
changes can be performed to any mode within the codec mode set; the number of
speech frames that should be encapsulated in each RTP packet and the maximum
number of speech frames that may be encapsulated in each RTP packet. For EVS
encoded media, the session setup shall determine the RTP profile to use in the
session.
If the session setup negotiation concludes that multiple configuration
variants are possible in the session then the default operation should be used
as far as the agreed parameters allow, see clause 7.5.2.1. It should be noted
that the default configurations are slightly different for different access
types.
An MTSI client offering a speech media session for narrow-band speech and/or
wide-band speech should generate an SDP offer according to the examples in
Annexes A.1 to A.3. An MTSI client offering EVS should generate an SDP offer
according to the examples in Annex A.14.
An MTSI client in terminal supporting EVS should support the RTCP-APP
signalling for speech adaptation defined clause 10.2.1, and shall support the
RTCP-APP signalling when the MTSI client in terminal supports adaptation for
call cases where the RTP-based CMR cannot be used.
NOTE: Examples of call cases where the RTP-based CMR cannot be used are: when
the RTP-based CMR is disabled; or for uni-directional media (sendonly or
recvonly).
Some of the request messages are generic for all speech codecs while other
request messages are codec-specific. Request messages that can be used in a
session are negotiated in SDP, see clause 10.2.3.
An MTSI client shall at least offer AVP for speech media streams. An MTSI
client should also offer AVPF for speech media streams. An MTSI client shall
offer AVPF for speech media streams when offering to use RTCP-APP signalling.
RTP profile negotiation shall be done as described in clause 6.2.1a. When AVPF
is offered then the RTCP bandwidth shall be greater than zero.
If an MTSI client in terminal offers to use ECN for speech in RTP streams then
the MTSI client in terminal shall offer ECN Capable Transport as defined
below. If an MTSI client in terminal accepts an offer for ECN for speech then
the MTSI client in terminal shall declare ECN Capable Transport in the SDP
answer as defined below. The SDP negotiation of ECN Capable Transport is
described in [84].
ECN shall not be used when the codec negotiation concludes that only fixed-
rate operation is used.
An MTSI client may support multiple codecs where ECN-triggered adaptation is
supported only for some of the codecs. An SDP offer for ECN may therefore
include multiple codecs where ECN-triggered adaptation is supported only for
some of the codecs. An MTSI client receiving an SDP offer including multiple
codecs and an offer for ECN should first select which codec to accept and then
accept or reject the offer for ECN depending on whether ECN-triggered
adaptation is supported for that codec or not. An MTSI client receiving an SDP
answer accepting ECN for a codec where ECN-triggered adaptation is not
supported should re-negotiate the session to disable ECN.
NOTE: ECN-triggered adaptation is currently undefined for EVS. This does not
prevent ECN-triggered adaptation from being negotiated and used for AMR or
AMR-WB.
The use of ECN for a speech stream in RTP is negotiated with the 'ecn-capable-
rtp' SDP attribute, [84]. ECN is enabled when both clients agree to use ECN as
configured below. An MTSI client in terminal using ECN shall therefore also
include the following parameters and parameter values for the ECN attribute:
> \- 'leap', to indicate that the leap-of-faith initiation method shall be
> used;
>
> \- 'ect=0', to indicate that ECT(0) shall be set for every packet.
An MTSI client offering ECN for speech may indicate support of the RTCP AVPF
ECN feedback messages [84] using \"rtcp-fb\" attributes with the "nack"
feedback parameter and the "ecn" feedback parameter value. An MTSI client
offering ECN for speech may indicate support for RTCP XR ECN summary reports
[84] using the "rtcp-xr" SDP attribute [88] and the "ecn-sum" parameter.
An MTSI client receiving an offer for ECN for speech without an indication of
support of RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages [84] within an \"rtcp-fb\"
attribute should accept the offer if it supports ECN.
An MTSI client receiving an offer for ECN for speech with an indication of
support of the RTCP AVPF ECN feedback message [84] should also accept the
offer and may indicate support of the RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages [84] in
the answer.
An MTSI client accepting ECN for speech in an answer may indicate support for
RTCP XR ECN summary reports in the answer using the "rtcp-xr" SDP attribute
[88] and the "ecn-sum" parameter.
The use of ECN is disabled when a client sends an SDP without the 'ecn-
capable-rtp' SDP attribute.
An MTSI client may initiate a session re-negotiation to disable ECN to resolve
ECN-related error cases. An ECN-related error case may, for example, be
detecting non-ECT in the received packets when ECT(0) was expected or
detecting a very high packet loss rate when ECN is used.
SDP examples for offering and accepting ECT are shown in Annex A.12.
Session setup for sessions including speech and DTMF events is described in
Annex G.
#### 6.2.2.2 Generating SDP offers
When speech is offered, an MTSI client in terminal sending a first SDP offer
in the initial offer-answer negotiation shall include at least one RTP payload
type for AMR-NB according to RFC4867 [28] and the MTSI client in terminal
shall support and offer a configuration, where the MTSI client in terminal
includes the parameter settings as defined in Table 6.1. When EVS-NB is also
offered, the MTSI client in terminal shall support and offer a configuration,
where the MTSI client in terminal includes the parameter settings for EVS
primary mode as defined in Table 6.2a and the RTP payload type for EVS shall
also use the parameters for EVS AMR-WB IO mode as defined in Table 6.1, except
for the 'ecn-capable-rtp' and 'leap ect' parameters.
If wideband speech is also offered, then the SDP offer shall also include at
least one RTP payload type for AMR-WB according to RFC4867 [28] and the MTSI
client in terminal shall support and offer a configuration, where the MTSI
client in terminal includes the parameter settings as defined in Table 6.1.
When EVS-WB is also offered, the MTSI client in terminal shall support and
offer a configuration, where the MTSI client in terminal includes the
parameter settings for EVS primary mode as defined in Table 6.2a and the RTP
payload type for EVS shall also use parameters for EVS AMR-WB IO mode as
defined in Table 6.1, except for the 'ecn-capable-rtp' and 'leap ect'
parameters. AMR-WB and EVS (including the EVS AMR-WB IO mode) are thus offered
using different RTP payload types.
If super-wideband speech is also offered, the SDP offer shall include at least
one RTP payload type for EVS and the MTSI client in terminal shall support a
configuration where the MTSI client in terminal includes the parameter
settings as defined in Table 6.2a.
If fullband speech is also offered, the SDP offer shall include at least one
RTP payload type for EVS and the MTSI client in terminal shall support a
configuration where the MTSI client in terminal includes the parameter
settings as defined in Table 6.2a.
When EVS is offered, the RTP payload type for EVS shall also use parameters
for EVS AMR-WB IO mode as defined in Table 6.1, except for the 'ecn-capable-
rtp' and 'leap ect' parameters. AMR-WB and EVS (including the EVS AMR-WB IO
mode) are thus offered using different RTP payload types.
NOTE 1: RFC4867 can also be used for EVS AMR-WB IO when EVS is supported. This
may happen after SRVCC when the EVS payload format is used between the ATGW
and the MTSI client in terminal while RFC4867 is used between the CS-MGW and
the ATGW.
NOTE 2: ECN-triggered adaptation is currently undefined for EVS. This does not
prevent ECN-triggered adaptation from being negotiated and used for AMR or
AMR-WB.
NOTE 3: When EVS is offered, the audio bandwidths may be different for
different directions for the EVS Primary mode, even for 'sendrecv' media.
Clause 5.2.1.6 describes the preference order for how different configurations
should be ordered in the list of payload type numbers that is given on the m=
line.

considerations in 3GPP TS 26.445 [125] apply. max-red Shall be included and
shall be set to 220 or less.
When the channels parameter is omitted then this means that one channel is
being offered.
The mode-set parameter is omitted, allowing maximum freedom for the visited
network.
The mode-change-capability parameter is included and set to 2, to support
potential interworking with 2G radio access (GERAN).
An example of an SDP offer for AMR-NB is shown in Table A.1.1. An example of
an SDP offer for both AMR-NB and AMR-WB is shown in Table A.1.2. An example of
SDP offer for AMR-NB, AMR-WB, and EVS is shown in Table A.14.1.
An SDP example for offering and accepting a dual-mono session for EVS is shown
in Annex A.14.1 and A.14.3.
An MTSI client in terminal may divide the offer-answer negotiation into
several phases and offer different configurations in different SDP offers. If
this is done then the first SDP offer in the initial offer-answer negotiation
shall include the most preferable configurations. For AMR-NB, this means that
the first SDP offer in the initial offer-answer negotiation shall include at
least one RTP payload type for AMR-NB with the parameters as defined in Table
6.1. If wideband speech is offered then the first SDP offer in the initial
offer-answer negotiation shall include also at least one RTP payload type for
AMR-WB with the parameters as defined in Table 6.1. This also means that
offers for octet-aligned payload format do not need to be included in the
first SDP offer. If super-wideband or fullband speech is offered, the first
SDP offer in the initial offer-answer negotiation shall include at least one
RTP payload type for EVS with the parameters as defined in [125]. One example
of dividing the offer-answer negotiation into two phases, and the
corresponding SDP offers, is shown in clause A.1.1.2.2.
NOTE: Dividing the offer-answer negotiation into several phases may lead to
never offering the less preferred configurations, if the other end-point
accepts to use at least one of the configurations offered in the initial SDP
offer.
If the speech media is re-negotiated during the session then the knowledge
from earlier offer-answer negotiations should be used in order to shorten the
session re-negotiation time. I.e., failed offer-answer transactions shall not
be repeated.
#### 6.2.2.3 Generating SDP answer
An MTSI client in terminal must understand all the payload format options that
are defined in RFC 4867 [28], and in [125]. It does not have to support
operating according to all these options but must be capable to properly
accepting or rejecting all options.
The SDP answer depends on many factors, for example:
\- what is included in the SDP offer and in what preference order that is
defined. The SDP offer will probably be different if it is generated by
another MTSI client in terminal, by an MTSI MGW, a TISPAN client or some other
VoIP client that does not follow this specification;
\- if terminal and/or network resources are available; and:
\- if there are other configurations, for example defined with OMA-DM, that
mandate, recommend or prevent some configurations.
Table 6.3 describes requirements and recommendations for handling of the AMR
payload format parameters and for how to generate the SDP answer.
NOTE: An MTSI client in terminal may support more features than what is
required by this specification, e.g. crc, robust sorting and interleaving.
Table 6.3 describes the handling of the AMR payload format parameters when the
MTSI client implementation supports only those features that are required by
this specification. Tables 6.3a-6.3c describe the handling of the EVS payload
format parameters.

If an SDP offer is received from another MTSI client in terminal using the
AMR-NB or AMR-WB codec, then the SDP offer will include configurations as
described in Table 6.1 and Table 6.2. If the MTSI client in terminal chooses
to accept the offer for using the AMR-NB or AMR-WB codec, as configured in
Table 6.1 or Table 6.2 then the MTSI client in terminal shall support a
configuration where the MTSI client in terminal creates an SDP answer
containing an RTP payload type for the AMR-NB and AMR-WB codec as shown in
Table 6.4.

may modify SDP offer or answer in order to disable DTX for the send direction
of the receiver of dtx-recv. hf-only - evs-mode-switch This parameter is used
by MTSI MGW either when starting in EVS AMR-WB IO mode instead of EVS Primary

session, the offerer shall use the requested mode when sending EVS packets.
However, if a media stream is already being received, the offerer needs to be
prepared to receive packets in both EVS primary and EVS AMR-WB IO modes until
receiving the answer. When including evs-mode-switch in the SDP answer during

### 6.2.3 Video
#### 6.2.3.1 Introduction
The common session setup procedures for video are described in Clause 6.2.3.2.
Session setup procedures for Coordination of Video Orientation (CVO) and Video
Region of Interest (ROI) are described in Clauses 6.2.3.3 and 6.2.3.4,
respectively. Session setup procedures for RTP Retransmission and Forward
Error Correction (FEC) are described in clauses 6.2.3.5 and 6.2.3.6,
respectively.
#### 6.2.3.2 Common Session Setup Procedures
If video is used in a session, the session setup shall determine the
applicable bandwidth(s) as defined in clause 6.2.5, RTP profile, video codec,
profile and level. The \"imageattr\" attribute as specified in [76] should be
supported. The \"framesize\" attribute as specified in [60] shall not be used
in the session setup.
An MTSI client shall offer AVPF for all media streams containing video. RTP
profile negotiation shall be done as described in clause 6.2.1a.
An MTSI client is required to support the AVPF feedback messages trr-int, NACK
and PLI [40] and the CCM feedback messages FIR, TMMBR and TMMBN [43], see
Clauses 7.3.3 and 10.3. These feedback messages can only be used together with
AVPF and shall be negotiated in SDP offer/answer before they can be used in
the session [40]. An MTSI client sending an SDP offer for AVPF shall also
include these AVPF and CCM feedback messages in the offer. An MTSI client
accepting an SDP offer for AVPF for video shall also accept these AVPF and CCM
feedback messages if they are offered.
If an MTSI client offers to use ECN for video in RTP streams then the MTSI
client shall offer ECN Capable Transport as defined below. If an MTSI client
accepts an offer for ECN for video then the MTSI client shall declare ECN
Capable Transport in the SDP answer as defined below. The SDP negotiation of
ECN Capable Transport is described in [84].
The use of ECN for a video stream in RTP is negotiated with the \"ecn-capable-
rtp\" SDP attribute, [84]. ECN is enabled when both clients agree to use ECN
as configured below. An MTSI client using ECN shall therefore also include the
following parameters and parameter values for the ECN attribute:
\- 'leap', to indicate that the leap-of-faith initiation method shall be used;
\- 'ect=0', to indicate that ECT(0) shall be set for every packet.
An MTSI client offering ECN for video shall indicate support of TMMBR [43] by
including the \"ccm tmmbr\" value within an \"rtcp-fb\" SDP attribute [40]. An
MTSI client offering ECN for video may indicate support for RTCP AVPF ECN
feedback messages [84] using the \"rtcp-fb\" SDP attribute with the \"nack\"
feedback parameter and the \"ecn\" feedback parameter value. An MTSI client
offering ECN for video may indicate support for RTCP XR ECN summary reports
[84] using the \"rtcp-xr\" SDP attribute and the \"ecn-sum\" parameter.
An MTSI client receiving an offer for ECN for video with an indication of
support of TMMBR [43] within an \"rtcp-fb\" attribute should accept the offer
if it supports ECN. It shall then indicate support for TMMBR using an \"rtcp-
fb\" attribute in the SDP answer.
An MTSI client receiving an offer for ECN for video with an indication of
support of RTCP AVPF ECN feedback message but without support for TMMBR should
accept the offer if it supports ECN and also the RTCP AVPF ECN feedback
message. It shall then indicate support of the RTCP AVPF ECN feedback message
using the \"rtcp-fb\" attribute in the SDP answer.
An MTSI client receiving an offer for ECN for video with an indication of
support of RTCP XR ECN summary reports [84] without support for TMMBR should
accept the offer if it supports ECN and also the RTCP XR ECN summary reports.
It shall then indicate support of RTCP XR ECN summary reports in the SDP
answer.
The use of ECN is disabled when a client sends an SDP without the \"ecn-
capable-rtp\" SDP attribute.
An MTSI client may initiate a session re-negotiation to disable ECN to resolve
ECN-related error cases. An ECN-related error case may be, for example,
detecting non-ECT in the received packets when ECT(0) was expected or
detecting a very high packet loss rate when ECN is used.
Examples of SDP offers and answers for video can be found in clause A.4. SDP
examples for offering and accepting ECT are shown in Annex A.12.2.
NOTE: For H.264 / MPEG-4 (Part 10) AVC, the optional max-rcmd-nalu-size
receiver-capability parameter of RFC 6184 [25] should be set to the smaller of
the MTU size (if known) minus header size or 1 400 bytes (otherwise).
The \"framerate\" attribute as specified in [8] indicates the maximum frame
rate the offerer wishes to receive. If the "framerate" attribute is present in
the SDP offer, its value may be modified in the SDP answer when the answerer
wishes to receive video with a different maximum frame rate than what was
indicated in the offer.
An MTSI client in terminal setting up asymmetric video streams with H.264
(AVC) should use both the 'level-asymmetry-allowed' parameter and the 'max-
recv-level' parameter that are defined in the H.264 payload format, [25]. When
the 'max-recv-level' parameter is used then the level offered for the
receiving direction using the 'max-recv-level' parameter must be higher than
the default level that is offered with the 'profile-level-id' parameter.
An SDP offer-answer example showing the usage of the 'level-asymmetry-allowed'
and 'max-recv-level' parameters is included in Annex A.4.5.
An MTSI client in terminal setting up asymmetric video streams with H.265
(HEVC) should use the 'max-recv-level-id' parameter that is defined in the
H.265 payload format, [120]. The level offered for the receiving direction
using the 'max-recv-level-id' parameter must be higher than the default level
that is offered with the 'level-id' parameter.
An SDP offer-answer example showing the usage of the 'max-recv-level-id'
parameter is included in Annex A.4.8.
The resolutions in the "imageattr" attribute correspond to the image size
information in the encoded video bitstream such that the x-component
corresponds to the image width, and the y-component corresponds to the height
component. When the bit-rate is being adapted, values of image width or image
height smaller than the x- or y-component(s) in the negotiated "imageattr"
attribute may be temporarily used.
#### 6.2.3.3 Coordination of Video Orientation (CVO)
An MTSI client should support Coordination of Video Orientation (CVO) as
specified in clause 7.4.5.
An MTSI client supporting CVO shall offer Coordination of Video Orientation
(CVO) in SDP for all media streams containing video. CVO is offered by
including the a=extmap attribute [95] indicating the CVO URN under the
relevant media line scope. The CVO URN is: urn:3gpp:video-orientation. Here is
an example usage of this URN to signal CVO relative to a media line:
a=extmap:7 urn:3gpp:video-orientation
The number 7 in the example may be replaced with any number in the range 1-14.
The above SDP line indicates 2 bits of granularity for rotation and shall be
present when offering CVO.
Higher granularity CVO supports up to 6 bits of precision and may additionally
be offered for the rotation value by also including the following line of SDP
in the offer:
a=extmap:5 urn:3gpp:video-orientation:6
For terminals with asymmetric capability (e.g. the ability to process video
orientation information but not detect orientation), the sendonly and recvonly
attributes [95] may be used. Terminals should express their capability in each
direction sufficiently clearly such that signals are only sent in each
direction to the extent that they both express useful information and can be
processed by the recipient; for example, 6-bit signals would not be sent when
the sending terminal can only detect orientation to a precision of 2 bits, and
terminals incapable of detecting orientation would not send the header.
An MTSI client supporting CVO shall respond to receive CVO when CVO is offered
to be sent in SDP, by including exactly one of the offered extmap attributes.
An MTSI client supporting CVO shall respond to send CVO when CVO is offered to
be received in SDP, by including exactly one of the offered extmap attributes.
An MTSI client shall not answer with CVO in a direction when not offered CVO
in that direction in SDP.
#### 6.2.3.4 Video Region-of-Interest (ROI)
An MTSI client should support Video Region-of-Interest (ROI) signaling as
specified in clause 7.3.7.
An MTSI client supporting ROI shall support at least one of the following
modes to request a desired region of interest (signalled from an MTSI receiver
to an MTSI sender):
\- Far End Camera Control' (FECC), as specified in [135]-[139] and clause
7.3.7
\- 'Arbitrary ROI', as specified in clause 7.3.7
\- 'Pre-defined ROI', as specified in clause 7.3.7
An MTSI client supporting FECC using H.224 shall offer FECC in SDP for all
media streams containing video, where FECC capabilities are desired. FECC
shall be offered via the syntax and semantics defined in IETF RFC 4573 [139].
The MIME type 'application/h224' corresponding to the RTP payload format for
H.224 shall be used as in [139], which also defines the SDP parameters needed
to indicate support for FECC using H.224.
An MTSI client supporting 'Arbitrary ROI' mode shall offer 'Arbitary ROI' in
SDP for all media streams containing video, where 'Arbitrary ROI' capabilities
are desired. 'Arbitrary ROI' shall be offered by including the a=rtcp-fb
attribute [40] with the 'Arbitrary ROI' type under the relevant media line
scope. The 'Arbitrary ROI' type in conjunction with the RTCP feedback method
shall be expressed with the following parameter: 3gpp-roi-arbitrary. A
wildcard payload type (\"*\") may be used to indicate that the RTCP feedback
attribute for 'Arbitrary ROI' signaling applies to all payload types. If
several types of ROI signaling are supported and/or the same 'Arbitary ROI'
shall be specified for a subset of the payload types, several \"a=rtcp-fb\"
lines can be used. Here is an example usage of this attribute to signal
'Arbitrary ROI' relative to a media line based on the RTCP feedback method:
a=rtcp-fb:* 3gpp-roi-arbitrary
An MTSI client supporting 'Pre-defined ROI' mode shall offer 'Pre-defined ROI'
in SDP for all media streams containing video, where 'Pre-defined ROI'
capabilities are desired. 'Pre-defined ROI' shall be offered by including the
a=rtcp-fb attribute [40] with the 'Pre-defined ROI' type under the relevant
media line scope. The 'Pre-defined ROI' type in conjunction with the RTCP
feedback method shall be expressed with the following parameter: 3gpp-roi-
predefined. A wildcard payload type (\"*\") may be used to indicate that the
RTCP feedback attribute for 'Pre-defined ROI' signaling applies to all payload
types. If several types of ROI signaling are supported and/or the same 'Pre-
defined ROI' shall be specified for a subset of the payload types, several
\"a=rtcp-fb\" lines can be used. Here is an example usage of this attribute to
signal 'Pre-defined ROI' relative to a media line based on the RTCP feedback
method:
a=rtcp-fb:* 3gpp-roi-predefined
The IANA registration information on the new RTCP feedback types for
'Arbitrary ROI' and 'Pre-defined ROI' are provided in Annex R.1.
The ABNF for rtcp-fb-val corresponding to the feedback types \"3gpp-roi-
arbitrary\"and "3gpp-roi-predefined" is given as follows:
rtcp-fb-val =/ \"3gpp-roi-arbitrary\"
rtcp-fb-val =/ \"3gpp-roi-predefined\"
An MTSI sender supporting the 'Pre-defined ROI' feature shall offer detailed
pre-defined ROI information in the initial offer-answer negotiation by
carrying it in SDP. Pre-defined ROIs shall be offered by including the
\"a=predefined_ROI\" attribute under the relevant media line. The following
parameters shall be provided in the attribute for each pre-defined ROI:
\- ROI_ID -- identifies the pre-defined ROI
\- Position_X - specifies the x-coordinate for the upper left corner of the
ROI area covered in the original content (i.e., uncompressed captured content)
in units of pixels
\- Position_Y - specifies the y-coordinate for the upper left corner of the
ROI area covered in the original content in units of pixels
\- Size_X - specifies the horizontal size of the ROI area covered in the
original content in units of pixels
\- Size_Y - specifies the vertical size of the ROI area covered in the
original content in units of pixels
\- Name- specifies the name of the pre-defined ROI.
The syntax for the "a=predefined_ROI" attribute shall conform to the following
ABNF:
predefined_ROI = \"predefined_ROI:\" PT 1*WSP attr-list
PT = 1*DIGIT / \"*\"
attr-list = ( set *(1*WSP set) ) / \"*\"

The SDP offer with a=predefined_ROI parameter shall contain the full-size view
of the video indicated via ROI_ID=0.
Here is an example use of the "a=predefined_ROI" attribute relative to a media
line:
a=predefined_ROI:99
[ROI_ID=0,Position_X=1,Position_Y=1,Size_X=1080,Size_Y=720,Name=fullview]
[ROI_ID=1,Position_X=1,Position_Y=1,Size_X=540,Size_Y=360,Name=museum]
[ROI_ID=2,Position_X=541,Position_Y=1,Size_X=540,Size_Y=360,Name=cinema]
[ROI_ID=3,Position_X=1,Position_Y=361,Size_X=540,Size_Y=360,Name=park]
[ROI_ID=4,Position_X=541,Position_Y=361,Size_X=540,Size_Y=360,Name= zoo]
The IANA registration information for the "a=predefined_ROI" SDP attribute is
provided in Annex M.5.
In response to the SDP offer with the set of offered pre-defined ROIs provided
using the \"a=predefined_ROI\" line(s), an MTSI client accepting 'Pre-defined
ROI' shall provide an SDP answer using the \"a=predefined_ROI\" line(s)
containing the accepted set of pre-defined ROIs. Such an SDP answer shall also
contain the \"a=rtcp-fb:* 3gpp-roi-predefined\" line. The accepted set of pre-
defined ROIs shall be a subset of the offered set of pre-defined ROIs. If the
SDP answer contains the a=rtcp-fb:* 3gpp-roi-predefined\" line, but does not
contain a \"a=predefined_ROI\" line, this indicates that the MTSI client
supports the 'Pre-defined ROI' mode, but none of the ROIs in the offered set
of pre-defined ROIs is acceptable for this MTSI client. Following the
successful negotiation of 'Pre-defined ROI', the MTSI receiver uses the RTCP
feedback method to request from the accepted set of pre-defined ROIs and MTSI
sender encodes the sent video accordingly to provide the requested pre-defined
ROI.
If the SDP offer just provides the \"a=predefined_ROI\" but not \"a=rtcp-fb:*
3gpp-roi-predefined \", then the \"a=predefined_ROI\" lines should be ignored.
A new SDP offer-answer negotiation can be performed to modify the set of pre-
defined ROIs. The MTSI sender may update all the content of pre-defined ROIs,
including the total number of pre-defined ROIs, and the position, size and
name of each of the pre-defined ROIs.
The ROI information parameters exchanged via the a=predefined_ROI parameter in
the SDP signalling defined above are independent of the negotiated video
resolution for the encoded content. Instead, the ROI information parameters
defined above take as reference the original video content, i.e., uncompressed
captured video content. Therefore, no modifications or remappings of ROI
parameters are necessary during any transcoding that results in changes in
video resolution or during potential dynamic adaptations of encoded video
resolution at the sender.
An MTSI client supporting 'Arbitrary ROI' or 'Pre-defined ROI' should also
offer 'Sent ROI' in SDP for all media streams containing video. An MTSI sender
accepting "Arbitrary ROI' or 'Pre-defined ROI' shall also accept an
accompanying 'Sent ROI' offer. An MTSI sender accepting 'FECC' should also
accept an accompanying 'Sent ROI' offer. 'Sent ROI' is specified in clause
7.3.7 and is offered by including the a=extmap attribute [95] indicating the
'Sent ROI' URN under the relevant media line scope. The 'Sent ROI' URN
corresponding to an arbitrary ROI is: urn:3gpp:roi-sent, on which the IANA
registration information is provided in Annex O.4. The 'Sent ROI' URN
corresponding to a pre-defined ROI is: urn:3gpp:predefined-roi-sent, on which
the IANA registration information is provided in Annex O.5. Here is an example
usage of this URN to signal 'Sent ROI' relative to a media line:
a=extmap:7 urn:3gpp:roi-sent
The number 7 in the example may be replaced with any number in the range 1-14.
#### 6.2.3.5 RTP Retransmission
An MTSI client should support RTP Retransmission as specified in clause 7.4.6.
An MTSI client supporting RTP Retransmission shall offer retransmission for
all media streams containing video. The binding used for retransmission stream
to the payload type number is indicated by an rtpmap attribute. The MIME
subtype name used in the binding is \"rtx\". The \"apt\" (associated payload
type) parameter shall be used to map the retransmission payload type to the
associated original payload type. The \"rtx-time\" payload-format-specific
parameter indicates the maximum time a sender will keep an original RTP packet
in its buffers available for retransmission [140]. An MTSI client offering RTP
retransmission shall specify \"rtx-time\" parameter.
An SDP offer/answer example showing the usage of the \"apt\" and \"rtx-time"
is included in Annex A.4.2c.
Bandwidth allocation for video with RTP Retransmission is discussed in clause
6.2.5.3.
#### 6.2.3.6 Forward Error Correction (FEC)
An MTSI client should support Forward Error Correction (FEC) as specified in
clause 7.4.7.
An MTSI client supporting FEC shall offer FEC for all media streams containing
video. The MIME subtype name used for FEC stream is \"flexfec\". The \"ssrc-
group\" attribute is used to designate FEC grouping association according to
\"ssrc\" identifiers along with the \"FEC-FR\" grouping semantics for FEC
Framework. The \"repair-window\" parameter indicates the time span of the
source and repair packets [141] [143]. An example for FEC grouping relative to
a media line is:
a=ssrc:1234
a=ssrc:2345
a=ssrc-group:FEC-FR 1234 2345
An SDP offer/answer example showing the usage of the \"flexfec\",\"repair-
window\" and \"ssrc-group\" is included in Annex A.4.2d.
Bandwidth allocation for video with FEC is discussed in clause 6.2.5.3.
### 6.2.4 Text
An MTSI client should offer AVP for all media streams containing text. Only in
cases where there is an explicit demand for the AVPF RTCP reporting timing or
feedback messages AVPF shall be used. If AVPF is offered then RTP profile
negotiation shall be done as described in clause 6.2.1a.
Examples of SDP offers for text can be found in clause A.5.
An MTSI client configured to automatically enable global text telephony (GTT),
e.g. because the MTSI client is used by a deaf or hearing-impaired person or a
person wanting to communicate with such an impaired person, shall accept an
initial INVITE request for a SIP dialogue if the SDP offer does not include
real time text media. It shall then send a new SDP offer (e.g. in a SIP UPDATE
request during call establishment) adding text media for real time text
conversation.
NOTE: As one example, incoming calls from a PSTN interworked by an MGCF will
not contain media for real time text conversation in the initial SDP offer.
The new offer adding media for real time text conversation enables the
transport of real time text towards the MTSI client.
### 6.2.5 Bandwidth negotiation
#### 6.2.5.1 General
The SDP shall include bandwidth information for each media stream and also for
the session in total. The bandwidth information for each media stream and for
the session is defined by the Application Specific (AS) bandwidth modifier as
defined in RFC 4566 [8].
An MTSI client in terminal should include the 'a=bw-info' attribute in the SDP
offer. When accepting a media type where the 'a=bw-info' attribute is included
the MTSI client in terminal shall include the 'a=bw-info' attribute in the SDP
answer if it supports the attribute. The 'a=bw-info' attribute and the below
used bandwidth properties are defined in clause 19.
When the 'a=bw-info' attribute is supported, the following bandwidth
properties shall be included for each RTP payload type in the SDP:
\- Maximum Supported Bandwidth for sending direction.
\- Maximum Desired Bandwidth for sending direction.
\- Minimum Desired Bandwidth for sending direction.
\- Minimum Supported Bandwidth for sending direction.
\- Maximum Supported Bandwidth for receiving direction with the following
exception:
\- The b=AS bandwidth modifier indicates the bandwidth needed for the RTP
payload type that requires the highest bandwidth. The Maximum Supported
Bandwidth for this RTP payload type is therefore indicated with the b=AS
bandwidth modifier and does not need to be indicated with the 'a=bw-info'
attribute for this RTP payload type. It is still allowed to include the 'a=bw-
info' attribute for this RTP payload type but the value shall then be aligned
with the b=AS value when sending the SDP. When receiving the SDP,the b=AS
bandwidth modifier and the Maximum Supported Bandwidth for the receiving
direction may not be aligned. In this case, the maximum sending rate is
determined as defined below.
\- Maximum Desired Bandwidth for receiving direction.
\- Minimum Desired Bandwidth for receiving direction.
\- Minimum Supported Bandwidth for receiving direction.
Recommended bandwidths for several codec configurations are provided in the
media-specific sections.
For a media stream that has been removed by either the offerer or answerer,
the inclusion of bandwidth information is optional. This is in accordance with
clause 8.2 of RFC 3264 [58].
SDP examples incorporating bandwidth modifiers are shown in annex A. SDP
examples using the 'a=bw-info' attribute are shown in annex A.6.3.
When an MTSI client in terminal receives an SDP offer or answer it shall
determine the maximum sending rate for the selected codec by selecting the
smallest of the following:
\- the bandwidth value, if the b=AS parameter was included in the received SDP
offer or answer
\- the Maximum Supported Bandwidth for the receiving direction, if included in
the received SDP
\- the preconfigured data rate for the selected codec, if the MTSI client has
been preconfigured by the operator to use a particular data rate for the
selected codec
\- the maximum data rate for the selected codec as determined by examining the
codec information (e.g., codec, mode, profile, level) and any other media
information (e.g., ptime and maxptime) included in the received SDP offer or
answer. This maximum data rate is determined assuming no extra bandwidth is
allowed for redundancy.
The maximum sending rate may be further updated by the MTSI client in terminal
based on receiving an indication of the granted QoS (see clause 6.2.7).
The MTSI client in terminal shall not transmit at a rate above the maximum
sending rate. For speech, the MTSI client should transmit using the codec mode
with the highest data rate allowed by the maximum sending rate, except if
limited to a lower codec mode by the initial codec mode procedures (see clause
7.5.2.1.6) or by the adaptation procedures (see clause 10.2).
The MTSI client in terminal may support access network bitrate recommendation
(ANBR, see clause 10.7). SDP offer/answer re-negotiation shall not be used as
a replacement for dynamic media bitrate adaptation. ANBR contains information
on short-term bandwidth and SDP offer/answer re-negotiations should be avoided
or minimized since they consume network resources. Therefore, SDP offer/answer
re-negotiation (e.g. in SIP UPDATE) shall not be initiated based on ANBR
information other than in the following cases:
> If;
1\. The received ANBR from the access network is below the established GBR;
and
2\. The received ANBR cannot be supported by any of the negotiated codec
configurations; and
3\. Potentially increased loss and/or delay due to not lowering the bitrate
are not acceptable; and
4\. The MTSI client in terminal supports one or more codec configurations that
supports the received ANBR; and
5\. ANBR messages with values meeting all conditions in 1-4 above are received
consistently for an extensive period of time (e.g. 5 seconds or more, see also
clause 10.7.2)
> then the MTSI client in terminal:
\- may re-negotiate the session
\- To switch to a codec or codec configuration that can support the lower
bitrate in the ANBR (if any); and/or
\- To reduce the number of used RTP streams (e.g. turning off the affected
media); and
\- If the session re-negotiation fails, shall not initiate further re-
negotiation based on ANBR for that bearer in the session.
> For video, if:
\- TMMBR/TMMBN are not supported in the session; and
\- For an extensive period of time (e.g. 5 seconds), the MTSI client in
terminal consistently receives ANBR messages with values significantly below
the video bitrate sent (as estimated by the receiving MTSI client in terminal)
from the remote peer
> Then the MTSI client in terminal may re-negotiate the session:
\- To set the session bitrate for video (see clause 6.2.5) to a value
corresponding to the minimum of the received ANBR and GBR (if > 0); or
\- To turn video off
NOTE 1: An ANBR below GBR does not change the GBR semantics in any way. GBR is
defined as a guarantee that for a packet stream not exceeding the GBR, 98
percent of the packets do not experience a delay exceeding the QCI's Packet
Delay Budget (see clause 6.1.7.2 of 3GPP TS 23.303 [90]). Temporarily reducing
bitrate below GBR to comply with an ANBR can increase the probability that
loss and/or delay can be kept within the bounds set by the used QCI.
NOTE 2: For GBR=MBR bearers, an ANBR below the GBR can frequently be supported
by the negotiated codec configuration.
NOTE 3: For GBR\ NOTE 1: This can improve the interworking with non-MTSI ECN peers.
When an MTSI client that has negotiated the use of ECN and then receives RTP
packets with ECN-CE marks, the MTSI client shall send application specific
adaptation requests (RTP CMR [28] or RTCP-APP CMR, as defined in Subclause
10.2.1.5) and shall not send RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages, even if RTCP
AVPF ECN feedback messages were negotiated.
> NOTE 2: RTP CMR is mandated to be supported by any AMR or AMR-WB
> implementation using the RTP profile [28].
When an MTSI client in terminal that has negotiated the use of ECN for speech
and RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages receives both application specific
requests and RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages, the MTSI client should follow
the application specific requests for perfoming media bit rate adaptation.
When an MTSI client in terminal that has negotiated the use of ECN for speech
and RTCP XR ECN summary reports receives an RTCP XR ECN summary report, the
MTSI client should use the RTCP XR ECN summary report as specified in [84]. If
the MTSI client received and acted upon a recent application specific
adaptation request, then the MTSI client shall not perform any additional rate
adaptation based on the received RTCP XR ECN summary report.
If ANBR (see clause 10.7) is available to the MTSI client in terminal, it
should use this information when performing media bitrate adaptation. In
addition, a media receiving MTSI client in terminal may send RTCP-APP or RTP
CMR messages for speech rate adaptation based on adaptation decisions,
including ANBR information.
For speech, RTCP APP packets are used for adaptation (see clause 10.2). If the
MTSI client determines that RTCP APP cannot be used or does not work then the
MTSI client may use CMR in the AMR RTP payload [28] inband CMR or other RTCP
mechanisms for adaptation.
An MTSI client that requests mode adaptation shall use the CMR in the AMR/AMR-
WB RTP payload [28] when using the AMR or the AMR-WB codec or in the EVS
payload [125] when using the EVS codec, respectively, when:
\- the RTCP bandwidth is set to zero,
\- the MTSI client detected that the remote end-point does not respond to
adaptation requests sent with RTCP APP during the session, or
\- the support for RTCP APP was not negotiated for the session.
If RTCP-APP was negotiated, an MTSI client that requests mode adaptation for
EVS shall use RTCP-APP when the CMR in the EVS RTP payload has been disabled
for the session.
NOTE 3: It is not possible to send adaptation requests if both CMR in the EVS
RTP payload has been disabled and if RTCP-APP is not negotiated for the
session.
An MTSI client using AMR or AMR-WB that requests mode adaptation when no MTSI
feature tag was received (see Clause 5.2 of [57]) may use the CMR in the
AMR/AMR-WB RTP payload, [28], when AMR or AMR-WB is used and may use the CMR
in the EVS RTP payload, [125], when EVS is used, respectively. If ECN-
triggered adaptation is used and an MTSI client requests mode adaptation when
no MTSI feature tag was received it should use the CMR in the AMR RTP payload,
[28].
NOTE 4: Other procedures by which the MTSI client determines that RTCP APP
cannot be used or does not work is implementation specific.
If ECN-triggered adaptation is used with AVP then the RTCP APP signalling
could be too slow and CMR in the AMR RTP payload [28] should be used for
faster feedback.
An MTSI client that requests mode adaptation in combination with other codec
control requests (as defined in Clause 10.2.1) shall use RTCP APP.
An MTSI client that requests rate adaptation for unidirectional streams shall
use RTCP-based adaptation signaling (RTCP APP or RTCP SR/RR) since CMR in the
AMR RTP payload, [28] is not usable for unidirectional streams.
### 7.3.3 Video
MTSI clients offering video shall support AVPF (RFC 4585 [40]). The behaviour
can be controlled by allocating enough RTCP bandwidth using \"b=RR:\" and
\"b=RS:\" (see section 7.3.1) and setting the value of \"trr-int\".
MTSI clients offering video shall support transmission and reception of AVPF
NACK messages, as an indication of non-received media packets. MTSI terminals
offering video shall also support transmission and reception of AVPF Picture
Loss Indication (PLI). The actions of an MTSI client receiving NACK or PLI to
improve the situation for the MTSI client that sent NACK or PLI is defined in
clause 9.3. Note that by setting the bitmask of following lost packets (BLP)
the frequency of transmitting NACK can be reduced, but the repairing action by
the MTSI client receiving the message can be delayed correspondingly.
The Temporary Maximum Media Bit-rate Request (TMMBR) and Temporary Maximum
Media Bit-rate Notification (TMMBN) messages of Codec-Control Messages (CCM)
[43] shall be supported by MTSI clients in terminals supporting video. The
TMMBR notification messages along with RTCP sender reports and receiver
reports are used for dynamic video rate adaptation. See clause 10.3 for usage
and Annexes B and C for examples of bitrate adaptation.
MTSI clients supporting video shall support Full Intra Request (FIR) of CCM
[43]. A sender should ignore FIR messages that arrive within Response Wait
Time (RWT) duration after responding to a previous FIR message. Response Wait
Time (RWT) is defined as RTP-level round-trip time, estimated by RTCP or some
other means, plus twice the frame duration.
MTSI clients in terminals shall not use SIP INFO message, as specified in
[96], for video picture fast update.
The usage of the AVPF and CCM feedback messages is negotiated in SDP
offer/answer, see Clause 6.2.3.2. Any AVPF or CCM feedback messages that have
not been agreed in the SDP offer/answer negotiation shall not be used in the
session, [40].
An MTSI client using ECN for video in RTP sessions may support the RTCP AVPF
ECN feedback message and the RTCP XR ECN summary report [84]. If the MTSI
client supports the RTCP AVPF ECN feedback message then the MTSI client shall
also support the RTCP XR ECN summary report.
NOTE This can improve the interworking with non-MTSI ECN-capable peers.
When an MTSI client that has negotiated the use of ECN and TMMBR receives RTP
packets with ECN-CE marks, the MTSI client shall send application specific
adaptation requests (TMMBR) and shall not send RTCP AVPF ECN feedback
messages, even if RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages were negotiated in addition
to TMMBR.
When an MTSI client that has negotiated the use of ECN for video and RTCP AVPF
ECN feedback messages receives both application specific requests and RTCP
AVPF ECN feedback messages, the MTSI client should follow the application
specific requests for perfoming media bit rate adaptation.
When an MTSI client that has negotiated the use of ECN for video and RTCP XR
ECN summary reports receives an RTCP XR ECN summary report, the MTSI client
should use the RTCP XR ECN summary report as specified in [84]. If the MTSI
client received and acted upon a recent application specific adaptation
request, then the MTSI client shall not perform any additional rate adaptation
based on the received RTCP XR ECN summary report.
If ANBR (see clause 10.7) information is available to the MTSI client in
terminal, it should use this information when performing media bitrate
adaptation. In addition, a media receiving MTSI client in terminal may send
RTCP feedback messages (e.g., TMMBR, TMMBN messages of CCM, etc.) for video
rate adaptation based on adaptation decisions, including ANBR information.
### 7.3.4 Real-time text
For real-time text, RTCP reporting should be used according to general
recommendations for RTCP.
### 7.3.5 Void
### 7.3.6 Reduced-Size RTCP
MTSI clients should support the use of Reduced-Size RTCP reports [87]. A
Reduced-Size RTCP packet is an RTCP packet that does not follow the sending
rules outlined in RFC 3550 [9] in the aspect that it does not necessarily
contain the mandated RR/SR report blocks and SDES CNAME items.
As specified in RFC5506 [87], a client that support Reduced-Size RTCP shall
also support AVPF, see clause 7.2 An SDP offer to use Reduced-Size RTCP shall
also offer using AVPF.
When Reduced-Size RTCP is used, the following requirements apply on the RTCP
receiver:
\- The RTCP receiver shall be capable of parsing and decoding report blocks of
the RTCP packet correctly even though some of the items mandated by RFC3550
[9] are missing.
\- An SDP attribute "a=rtcp-rsize" is used to enable Reduced-Size RTCP. A
receiver that accepts the use of Reduced-Size RTCP shall include the attribute
in the SDP answer. If this attribute is not set in offer/answer, then Reduced-
Size RTCP shall not be used in any direction.
When Reduced-Size RTCP is used, an RTCP sender transmitting Reduced-Size RTCP
packets shall follow the requirements listed below:
\- AVPF early or immediate mode shall be used according to RFC4585 [40].
\- The "a=rtcp-rsize" attribute shall be included in the SDP offer, see Annex
A.9a.
\- Reduced-Size RTCP packets should be used for transmission of adaptation
feedback messages, for example APP packets as defined in Clause 10.2 and TMMBR
as defined in Clause 10.3. When regular feedback packets are transmitted, the
individual packets that would belong to a compound RTCP packet shall be
transmitted in a serial fashion, although adaptation feedback packets shall
take precedence.
\- Two or more RTCP packets should be stacked together, within the limits
allowed by the maximum size of Reduced-Size RTCP packets (see clause 7.3.2)
(i.e., to form a semi-compound RTCP packet which is smaller than a compound
RTCP packet). The RTCP sender should not send Reduced-Size RTCP packets that
are larger than the regularly scheduled compound RTCP packets.
\- Compound RTCP packets with an SR/RR report block and CNAME SDES item should
be transmitted on a regular basis as outlined in RFC 3550 [9] and RFC 4585
[40]. In order to control the allocation of bandwidth between Reduced-Size
RTCP and compound RTCP, the AVPF "trr-int" parameter should be used to set the
minimum report interval for compound RTCP packets.
\- The first transmitted RTCP packet shall be a compound RTCP packet as
defined in RFC3550 [9] without the size restrictions defined in clause 7.3.2.
The application should verify that the Reduced-Size RTCP packets are
successfully received by the other end-point. Verification can be done by
implicit means, for instance the RTCP sender that sends an adaptation feedback
requests is expected to detect some kind of a response to the requests in the
media stream. If verification fails then the RTCP sender shall switch to the
use of compound RTCP packets according to the rules outlined in RFC3550 [9].
Examples of SDP negotiation for Reduced-Size RTCP given in Clause A.9a.
### 7.3.7 Video Region-of-Interest (ROI) Signaling
Video Region-of-Interest (ROI) consists of signalling the currently requested
region-of-interest (ROI) of the video on the receiver side to the sender for
appropriate encoding and transmission.
Video ROI is composed of three modes of signalling from an MTSI receiver to an
MTSI sender in order to request a desired region of interest, and an MTSI
client supporting ROI shall support at least one of these modes:
\- 'FECC' mode, in which the MTSI client uses the FECC protocol based on ITU-T
H.281 over H.224 [135]-[138] to signal ROI information as a sequence of 'Pan',
'Tilt', 'Zoom' and 'Focus' (PTZF) commands.
\- 'Arbitrary ROI' mode, in which the MTSI receiver determines a specific ROI
and signals this ROI to the MTSI sender.
\- 'Pre-defined ROI' mode, in which the MTSI receiver selects one of the ROIs
pre-determined by the MTSI sender and signals this ROI to the MTSI sender. In
this mode, the MTSI receiver obtains the set of pre-defined ROIs from the MTSI
sender during the SDP capability negotiation.
In the FECC mode, the ROI information shall be signaled by the MTSI client via
RTP packets that carry H.224 frames using the stack IP/UDP/RTP/H.224/H.281.
FECC is internal to the H.224 frame and is identified by the client ID field
of the H.224 packet. The zooming to a particular region of interest is enabled
by the H.281 protocol that supports the 4 basic camera movements "PTZF" (Pan,
Tilt, Zoom, and Focus). In case of a fixed camera without pan/tilt
capabilities, the pan command should be mapped to left/right
movements/translations and tilt command should be mapped to up/down
movements/translations over the 2D image plane. As such, a combination of PTZ
commands can still allow for zooming into an arbitrary ROI.
The signalling of 'Arbitrary ROI' and 'Pre-defined ROI' requests uses RTCP
feedback messages as specified in IETF 4585 [40]. The RTCP feedback message is
identified by PT (payload type) = PSFB (206) which refers to payload-specific
feedback message. FMT (feedback message type) shall be set to the value '9'
for ROI feedback messages. The IANA registration information for the FMT value
for ROI is provided in Annex R.1. The RTCP feedback method may involve
signaling of ROI information in both of the immediate feedback and early RTCP
modes.
The FCI (feedback control information) format for ROI shall be as follows. The
FCI shall contain exactly one ROI. The ROI information is composed of the
following parameters:
\- Position_X - specifies the x-coordinate for the upper left corner of the
ROI area covered in the original content (i.e., uncompressed captured content)
in units of pixels
\- Position_Y - specifies the y-coordinate for the upper left corner of the
ROI area covered in the original content in units of pixels
\- Size_X - specifies the horizontal size of the ROI area covered in the
original content in units of pixels
\- Size_Y - specifies the vertical size of the ROI area covered in the
original content in units of pixels
\- ROI_ID -- identifies the pre-defined ROI selected by the MTSI receiver
For 'Arbitrary ROI' requests, the RTCP feedback message for ROI shall contain
the parameters Position_X, Position_Y, Size_X and Size_Y. The values for the
each of the parameters Position_X, Position_Y, Size_X and Size_Y shall each be
indicated using two bytes. The MTSI sender shall ignore ROI requests
describing regions outside the original video. The FCI for the RTCP feedback
message for 'Arbitrary ROI' shall follow the following format:
0 1 2 3\ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\

Position_X (h)\| Position_X (l)\| Position_Y (h)\| Position_Y(l)\|\
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\ \| Size_X
(h) \| Size_X (l) \| Size_Y (h) \| Size_Y(l) \|\
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
For each two-byte indication of the Position_X, Position_Y, Size_X and Size_Y
parameters, the high byte (indicated by '(h)' above) shall be followed by the
low byte (indicated by '(l)' above), where the low byte holds the least
significant bits.
For 'Pre-defined ROI' requests, the RTCP feedback message for ROI shall
contain the ROI_ID parameter. The value of ROI_ID shall be acquired from the
\"a=predefined_ROI\" attributes that are indicated in the SDP offer-answer
negotiation (see clause 6.2.3.4 for the related SDP-based procedures). The
value for the ROI_ID parameter shall be indicated using one byte. The FCI for
the RTCP feedback message for 'Pre-defined ROI' shall follow the following
format:
0 1 2 3\ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\

If 'Arbitrary ROI' and 'Pre-defined ROI' are both successfully negotiated,
then the RTCP feedback message from the MTSI receiver shall conform to one of
the two message formats specified above for 'Arbitary ROI' or 'Pre-defined
ROI', respectively. The MTSI sender should distinguish between the two RTCP
feedback message formats by parsing the first 24 bits, which is uniquely set
to all ones in case of 'Pre-defined ROI' requests.
The semantics of the ROI feedback messages is independent of the payload type.
'Sent ROI' involves signalling from the MTSI sender to the MTSI receiver and
this helps the MTSI receiver to know the actually sent ROI corresponding to
the video transmitted by the MTSI sender, i.e., which may or may not agree
with the ROI requested by the MTSI receiver, but shall contain it so that the
end user is still able to see the desired ROI. When 'Sent ROI' is successfully
negotiated, it shall be signalled by the MTSI sender.
If the sent ROI corresponds to an arbitrary ROI (indicated via the URN
urn:3gpp:roi-sent in the SDP negotiaton, see clause 6.2.3.4), the signalling
of the ROI shall use RTP header extensions as specified in IETF 5285 [95] and
shall carry the Position_X, Position_Y, Size_X and Size_Y parameters
corresponding to the actually sent ROI. The one-byte form of the header should
be used. The values for the parameters Position_X, Position_Y, Size_X and
Size_Y shall each be indicated using two bytes, with the following format:
0 1 2 3\ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\ \| ID \|
len=7 \| Position_X (h)\| Position_X (l)\| Position_Y (h)\|\
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\ \|
Position_Y (l)\| Size_X (h) \| Size_X (l) \| Size_Y (h) \|\
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\ \| Size_Y
(l) \| zero padding \|\
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
The 4-bit ID is the local identifier as defined in [95]. The length field
takes the value 7 to indicate that 8 bytes follow. For each two-byte
indication of the Position_X, Position_Y, Size_X and Size_Y parameters, the
high byte (indicated by '(h)' above) shall be followed by the low byte
(indicated by '(l)' above), where the low byte holds the least significant
bits.
If the sent ROI corresponds to one of the pre-defined ROIs (indicated via the
URN urn:3gpp:predefined-roi-sent in the SDP negotiation, see clause 6.2.3.4),
then the signalling of the ROI shall again use the RTP header extensions and
shall carry the ROI_ID parameter corresponding to the actually sent pre-
defined ROI. The one-byte form of the header should be used. The value for the
ROI_ID parameter shall be indicated using one byte, with the following format:
0 1 2 3\ 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1\
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+\ \| ID \|
len=0 \| ROI_ID \| zero padding \|\
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
In this case, the length field takes the value 0 to indicate that only a
single byte follows.
'Arbitrary ROI' and 'Pre-defined ROI' may be supported bi-directionally or
uni-directionally depending on how clients negotiate to support the feature
during SDP capability negotiations. For terminals with asymmetric capability
(e.g. the ability to process ROI information but not detect/signal ROI
information), the sendonly and recvonly attributes may be used. Terminals
should express their capability in each direction sufficiently clearly such
that signals are only sent in each direction to the extent that they both
express useful information and can be processed by the recipient.
'Arbitary ROI' and 'Pre-defined ROI' support may be offered at the same time,
or only one of them may be offered. When both capabilities are successfully
negotiated by the MTSI sender and receiver, it is the MTSI receiver's decision
to request an arbitrary ROI or one of the pre-defined ROIs at a given time.
When pre-defined ROIs are offered by the MTSI sender, it is also the
responsibility of the MTSI sender to detect and track any movements of the
ROI, e.g., the ROI could be a moving car, or moving person, etc. and refine
the content encoding accordingly.
The presence of ROI signalling should not impact the negotiated resolutions
(based on SDP imageattr attribute) between the sending and receiving
terminals. The only difference is that the sending terminal should encode only
the ROI with the negotiated resolution rather than the whole captured frame,
and this would lead to a higher overall resolution and better user experience
than having the receiving terminal zoom in on the ROI and crop out the rest of
the frame.
The ROI information parameters exchanged via the RTP/RTCP signalling defined
above are independent of the negotiated video resolution for the encoded
content. Instead, the ROI information parameters defined above take as
reference the original video content, i.e., uncompressed captured video
content. Therefore, no modifications or remappings of ROI parameters are
necessary during any transcoding that results in changes in video resolution
or during potential dynamic adaptations of encoded video resolution at the
sender.
An MTSI sender may have to handle multiple simultaneously received ROI
requests. The encoder at the MTSI sender may consider the multiple ROI
requests to determine a proximity ROI that is a larger area that contains all
the requested ROIs, and encode the transmitted video stream according to the
proximity ROI. The encoder may iteratively adjust the proximity ROI based on
the interactive additional ROI requests received from the remote clients.
These additional ROI requests can be in the form of PTZF commands (using the
FECC protocol) corresponding to the desired translation of the proximity ROI
each MTSI receiver wishes the MTSI sender to make. Alternatively, the MTSI
sender may offer the set of candidate proximity ROIs to the MTSI receivers
using the pre-defined ROI signalling framework, and collect responses from the
MTSI receivers to determine their preferred proximity ROIs. By considering
these additional ROI requests, the MTSI sender can make a better decision on
the proximity ROI to fulfil the requests of as many MTSI receivers as
possible.
When the MTSI sender is not able to derive a proximity ROI from the received
concurrent ROI requests, the MTSI sender should transmit the full-size view of
the video to those users whose ROI requests cannot be satisfied. In case of
'Pre-defined ROI', this can be achieved by including the full-size view of the
video in the list of pre-defined ROIs. Then, the MTSI sender can transmit the
full-size view of the video and also signal the corresponding ROI_ID (via the
RTP header extension using 'Sent ROI') if a specific pre-defined ROI request
cannot be satisfied. In case of 'Arbitrary ROI', the MTSI sender can transmit
the full-size view of the video and also signal the corresponding coordinates
of the full-size view (via the RTP header extension using 'Sent ROI') during
times when an ROI request cannot be satisfied.
## 7.4 RTP payload formats for MTSI clients
### 7.4.1 General
This clause specifies RTP payload formats for MTSI clients, except for MTSI
media gateways that is specified in clause 12.3.2, for all codecs supported by
MTSI in clause 5.2. Note that each RTP payload format also specifies media
type signalling for usage in SDP.
### 7.4.2 Speech
When the AMR codec is selected in the SDP offer-answer negotiation the AMR
payload format [28] shall be used between RTP termination points.
When the AMR-WB is selected in the SDP offer-answer negotiation the AMR-WB
payload format [28] shall be used between RTP termination points.
NOTE 1: It may happen that EVS AMR-WB IO encoded speech is transported using
the AMR-WB payload format between an EVS-capable MTSI client and a legacy (not
EVS capable) MTSI client. This may also happen after SRVCC (see Clause 12.3.4)
when an EVS-capable MTSI client sends EVS AMR-WB IO encoded speech in EVS
payload format to the ATGW and the ATGW then re-packetizes the EVS AMR-WB IO
packet into AMR-WB payload format without performing transcoding of the media.
When the EVS codec is selected in the SDP offer-answer negotiation the EVS
payload format [125] shall be used between RTP termination points.
NOTE 2: After SRVCC when a CS UE (not EVS capable) sends AMR-WB encoded speech
to the ATGW, it may happen that the ATGW then re-packetizes this AMR-WB packet
into the EVS payload format without performing transcoding of the media, see
clause 12.3.4.
[In case of ambiguity the present specification shall take precedence over RFC
4867 [28]]{.underline}.
MTSI clients (except MTSI MGW) shall support both the bandwidth-efficient and
the octet-aligned payload format of the AMR/AMR-WB payload format [28]. The
bandwidth‑efficient payload format shall be preferred over the octet-aligned
payload format.
When sending AMR or AMR-WB encoded media, the RTP Marker Bit shall be set
according to Section 4.1 of the AMR/AMR-WB payload format [28]. When sending
EVS encoded media, the RTP Marker Bit shall be set as described in the EVS
payload format [125].
The MTSI clients (except MTSI MGW) should use the SDP parameters defined in
table 7.1 for the session. For all access technologies, and for normal
operating conditions, the MTSI client should encapsulate the number of non-
redundant (a.k.a. primary) speech frames in the RTP packets that corresponds
to the ptime value received in SDP from the other MTSI client, or if no ptime
value has been received then according to \"Recommended encapsulation\"
defined in table 7.1. The MTSI client may encapsulate more non-redundant
speech frames in the RTP packet but shall not encapsulate more than 4 non-
redundant speech frames in the RTP packets. The MTSI client may encapsulate
any number of redundant speech frames in an RTP packet but the length of an
RTP packet, measured in ms, shall never exceed the maxptime value.
NOTE: The terminology \"non-redundant speech frames\" refers to speech frames
that have not been transmitted in any preceding packet.
Table 7.1: Encapsulation parameters (to be used as defined above)
+------------------+------------------+------------------+----------+ | Radio access | Recommended | ptime | maxptime | | bearer | encapsulation | | | | technology | (if no ptime and | | | | | no | | | | | RTC | | | | | P_APP_REQ_AGG | | | | | has been | | | | | received) | | | +==================+==================+==================+==========+ | Default | 1 non-redundant | 20 | 240 | | | speech frame per | | | | | RTP packet | | | | | | | | | | Max 12 speech | | | | | frames in total | | | | | but not more | | | | | than a received | | | | | maxptime value | | | | | requires | | | +------------------+------------------+------------------+----------+ | HSPA | 1 non-redundant | 20 | 240 | | | speech frame per | | | | E-UTRAN | RTP packet | | | | | | | | | | Max 12 speech | | | | | frames in total | | | | | but not more | | | | | than a received | | | | | maxptime value | | | | | requires | | | +------------------+------------------+------------------+----------+ | EGPRS | 2 non-redundant | 40 | 240 | | | speech frames | | | | | per RTP packet, | | | | | but not more | | | | | than a received | | | | | maxptime value | | | | | requires | | | | | | | | | | Max 12 speech | | | | | frames in total | | | | | but not more | | | | | than a received | | | | | maxptime value | | | | | requires | | | +------------------+------------------+------------------+----------+ | GIP | 1 to 4 | 20, 40, 60 or 80 | 240 | | | non-redundant | | | | | speech frames | | | | | per RTP packet | | | | | but not more | | | | | than a received | | | | | maxptime value | | | | | requires. | | | | | | | | | | Max 12 speech | | | | | frames in total | | | | | but not more | | | | | than a received | | | | | maxptime | | | +------------------+------------------+------------------+----------+
NOTE: It is possible to send only redundant speech frames in one RTP packet.
When the radio access bearer technology is not known to the MTSI client, the
default encapsulation parameters defined in Table 7.1 shall be used.
When the AMR/AMR-WB payload formats are used, the bandwidth-efficient payload
format should be used unless the session setup concludes that the octet-
aligned payload format is the only payload format that all parties support.
The SDP offer shall include an RTP payload type where octet-align=0 is defined
or where octet-align is not specified and should include another RTP payload
type with octet-align=1. MTSI client offering wide-band speech shall offer
these parameters and parameter settings also for the RTP payload types used
for wide-band speech.
For examples of SDP offers and answers, see annex A.
The RTP payload format for DTMF events ís described in Annex G.
### 7.4.3 Video
The following RTP payload formats shall be used:
\- H.264 (AVC) video codec RTP payload format according to RFC 6184 [25],
where the interleaved packetization mode shall not be used. Receivers shall
support both the single NAL unit packetization mode and the non‑interleaved
packetization mode of RFC 6184 [25], and transmitters may use either one of
these packetization modes.
\- H.265 (HEVC) video codec RTP payload format according to [120].
### 7.4.4 Real-time text
The following RTP payload format shall be used:
\- T.140 text conversation RTP payload format according to RFC 4103 [31].
Real-time text shall be the only payload type in its RTP stream because the
RTP sequence numbers are used for loss detection and recovery. The redundant
transmission format shall be used for keeping the effect of packet loss low.
Media type signalling for usage in SDP is specified in section 10 of RFC 4103
[31] and section 3 of RFC 4102 [49].
### 7.4.5 Coordination of Video Orientation
Coordination of Video Orientation consists in signalling of the current
orientation of the image captured on the sender side to the receiver for
appropriate rendering and displaying. When CVO is succesfully negotiated it
shall be signalled by the MTSI client. The signalling of the CVO uses RTP
Header Extensions as specified in IETF RFC 5285 [95]. The one-byte form of the
header should be used. CVO information for a 2 bit granularity of Rotation
(corresponding to urn:3gpp:video-orientation) is carried as a byte formatted
as follows:
> Bit# 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0(LSB)\ Definition 0 0 0 0 C F R1 R0
With the following definitions:
C = Camera: indicates the direction of the camera used for this video stream.
It can be used by the MTSI client in receiver to e.g. display the received
video differently depending on the source camera.
0: Front-facing camera, facing the user. If camera direction is unknown by the
sending MTSI client in the terminal then this is the default value used.
1: Back-facing camera, facing away from the user.
F = Flip: indicates a horizontal (left-right flip) mirror operation on the
video as sent on the link.
0: No flip operation. If the sending MTSI client in terminal does not know if
a horizontal mirror operation is necessary, then this is the default value
used.
1: Horizontal flip operation
R1, R0 = Rotation: indicates the rotation of the video as transmitted on the
link. The receiver should rotate the video to compensate that rotation. E.g. a
90° Counter Clockwise rotation should be compensated by the receiver with a
90° Clockwise rotation prior to displaying.
Table 7.2: Rotation signalling for 2 bit granularity
R1 R0 Rotation of the video as sent on the link Rotation on the receiver
before display
* * *
0 0 0° rotation None 0 1 90° Counter Clockwise (CCW) rotation or 270°

rotation 180° CW rotation 1 1 270° CCW rotation or 90° CW rotation 90° CCW
rotation
CVO information for a higher granularity of Rotation (corresponding to
urn:3GPP:video-orientation:6) is carried as a byte formatted as follows:
> Bit# 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0(LSB)\ Definition R5 R4 R3 R2 C F R1 R0
where C and F are as defined above and the bits R5,R4,R3,R2,R1,R0 represent
the Rotation, which indicates the rotation of the video as transmitted on the
link. Table 7.3 describes the rotation to be applied by the receiver based on
the rotation bits.
Table 7.3: Rotation signalling for 6 bit granularity
R1 R0 R5 R4 R3 R2 Rotation of the video as sent on the link Rotation on the
receiver before display
* * *
0 0 0 0 0 0 0° rotation None 0 0 0 0 0 1 (360/64)° Counter Clockwise (CCW)
rotation (360/64)° CW rotation 0 0 0 0 1 0 (2*360/64)° CCW rotation

1 1 1 1 (63*360/64)° CCW rotation (360/64)° CCW rotation
The sending MTSI client in the terminal using a camera as source and equipped
with appropriate orientation sensor(s) should compute the image orientation
from the sensor(s) that indicate the rotation of the device with respect to
the default camera orientation. It is recommended that appropriate filtering
on the time and angular domain is applied onto the sensor's indications to
prevent a \"ping-pong\" effect between two quantization levels in the case
where the measured value is fluctuating between two quantization levels. The
sending MTSI client may choose to send any orientation information not
necessarily based on orientation sensor(s).
For higher granularity CVO, a terminal shall send a report at least as
frequently as it would have sent a 2-bit report. A report interval shorter
than this requirement should only be used when the report contains a value
that differs significantly from the previous report, i.e. after taking noise
removal, sensor precision, and any other relevant factors into account.
The rotation is a quantized value of the angle between the earth vertical
projected onto the plane of the image as sent on the link and the image
vertical. The earth vertical is a radial line starting at the center of the
earth and passing through the depicted scene while the image vertical is a
line passing from the middle of the bottom to the middle of the top of the
image. For the case where the camera is pointing vertical or nearly vertical,
the last valid value used for rotation should be used. In case there is no
previous valid value, a suitable default value should be chosen.
When compensating for both rotation and flip at the receiving MTSI client, the
operations shall be performed in the order of rotation compensation followed
by flipping, because the order of flip and rotation operations matters when
rotating 90° or 270°. The sending MTSI client shall correspondingly, when the
transmitted image is both flipped and rotated, include information in the RTP
Header Extension as if the transmitted image on the link was first flipped
(mirrored) and then rotated, using an image perceived as upright (regardless
if using portrait or landscape format) as starting point.
The MTSI client shall add the payload bytes as defined in this clause onto the
last RTP packet in each group of packets which make up a key frame (I-frame or
IDR frame in H.264 (AVC), or an IRAP picture in H.265 (HEVC)). The MTSI client
may also add the payload bytes onto the last RTP packet in each group of
packets which make up another type of frame (e.g. a P-Frame) only if the
current value is different from the previous value sent.
If this is the only header extension present, a total of 8 bytes are appended
to the RTP header, and the last packet in the sequence of RTP packets will be
marked with both the marker bit and the Extension bit, as defined in RFC3550
[9].
When CVO is not succesfully negotiated the MTSI clients are said to be in non-
CVO operation. The sender in non-CVO operation should operate as follows to
compensate for image rotation and potential misalignment.
If the receiver has explicitly indicated support for both [x,y] and [y,x]
resolutions via the imageattr attribute during SDP negotiation (see clause
6.2.3.3 and an example in clause A.4.6), and when video is negotiated for the
session, the sender should rotate the image prior to video encoding and
compensate image rotation by changing the signaled Sequence Parameter Set in
the video bitstream between [x,y] and [y,x] as applicable.
If the receiver has not explicitely indicated support for both [x,y] and [y,x]
resolutions via the imageattr attribute during SDP negotiation, then the
sender should apply rotation/padding/cropping/resizing prior to video encoding
as the sender considers appropriate while keeping the resolution unchanged. As
for CVO operation, the sending MTSI client in the terminal using a camera as
source and equipped with appropriate orientation sensor(s) should compute the
image orientation from the output of the sensor(s) that indicates the rotation
of the device with respect to the default camera orientation. It is
recommended that appropriate filtering on the time and angular domain is
applied onto the sensor's indications to prevent a \"ping-pong\" effect in the
case where the measured value is fluctuating between two quantization levels.
The decision of MTSI client transmitting video to change the image size needs
not necessarily be based on input from orientation sensor(s).
### 7.4.6 RTP Retransmission
AVPF NACK messages are used by MTSI clients to indicate non-received RTP
packets for video (see clause 7.3.3). The RTP Retransmission Payload Format
RFC 4588 [140] supports retransmission of lost packets based on NACK feedback.
Retransmission is useful if retransmitted packets arrive within the end to end
delay requirements of the system. It is suitable for low RTT networks with
relatively low observed packet loss [142]. If support for RTP retransmission
payload format has been negotiated, the receivers shall support handling of
RTP retransmission packets defined in RFC 4588 sent using SSRC multiplexing.
Similarly, senders shall use RTP retransmission packets defined in RFC 4588
for packets it retransmits using SSRC multiplexing.
### 7.4.7 Forward Error Correction (FEC)
Forward Error Correction (FEC) can provide effective error resiliency under
certain packet loss and network RTT conditions [142]. If support for FEC is
negotiated, then use of a separate SSRC multiplexed FEC stream with the RTP
payload defined in [141] shall be supported at both the receiver and the
sender. The receiver can demultiplex the incoming stream by the SSRC field and
map it to the source by using the ssrc-group mechanism defined in RFC 5956
[143]. The systematic FEC scheme defined in [141] is a flexible parity FEC
scheme that supports various signalling of source packets used to generate the
parity packets.
Other types of FEC schemes may be supported. The use of a particular FEC sheme
shall be negotiated before it is used.
## 7.5 Media flow
### 7.5.1 General
This clause contains considerations on how to use media in RTP, packetization
guidelines, and other transport considerations. The use of ECN for RTP
sessions is also described for speech in this clause.
The general handling of bitrate variations is described in clause 7.5.5.1.
Media specific handling is described in clause 7.5.5.2 for video.
### 7.5.2 Media specific
#### 7.5.2.1 Speech
##### 7.5.2.1.1 General
This clause describes how the speech media should be packetized during a
session. It includes definitions both for the cases where the access type is
known and one default operation for the case when the access type is not
known.
Requirements for transmission of DTMF events are described in Annex G.
##### 7.5.2.1.2 Default operation
###### 7.5.2.1.2.1 General
When the radio access bearer technology is not known to the MTSI client, the
default encapsulation parameters defined in Table 7.1 shall be used.
The codec modes and the other codec parameters (mode-change-capability, mode-
change-period, mode-change-neighbor, etc), applicable for each session, are
negotiated as described in clauses 6.2.2.2 and 6.2.2.3.
When transmitting AMR or AMR-WB encoded media, codec mode changes should be
aligned to every other frame border and should be performed to one of the
neighbouring codec modes in the negotiated mode set, except for a MTSI media
gateway, see clause 12.3.1.1. In the transmitted media, the highest codec mode
of the negotiated mode-set (or of all modes, if no mode-set was included in
the SDP answer) should be used, unless it is restricted by the most recently
received CMR. In the received media, codec mode changes shall be accepted at
any frame border and to any codec mode within the negotiated mode set.
The bandwidth-efficient payload format should be used for AMR and AMR-WB
encoded media unless the session setup determines that the octet-aligned
payload format must be used.
The adaptation of codec mode, aggregation and redundancy is defined in clause
10.2.
###### 7.5.2.1.2.2 Codec Mode Requests
For AMR and AMR-WB, if the highest mode within the negotiated mode-set is
acceptable for media reception, then the MTSI client in terminal shall either
indicate that no codec mode request is present (i.e. value 15) or shall
indicate the CMR value corresponding to the highest mode within the negotiated
mode-set in the CMR bits in the AMR and/or AMR-WB payload format [28] in every
outgoing RTP packet. Otherwise the highest acceptable mode within the
negotiated mode-set shall be sent in CMR in each outgoing RTP packet.
NOTE 1: The MTSI client sending CMR values relies on that the remote media-
sender will not send media with higher codec modes than requested by CMR,
after some reaction time (round trip delay). However the remote party can send
with lower modes within the negotiated mode-set, because there could be other
mode limiting effects in the voice path.
For AMR and AMR-WB, the MTSI client shall accept that the remote party sends
with lower modes within the negotiated mode-set than requested by the CMR. The
MTSI client shall follow each received CMR and shall not use higher modes in
media-encoding than indicated by the most recently received CMR, while lower
modes within the negotiated mode-set are allowed any time.
NOTE 2: The codec modes in media-sending and media-receiving direction may
differ in general. Received CMR values have no influence on or relation to
received media-frames.
The MTSI client shall accept Codec Mode Requests signalled with the CMR bits
in the AMR and/or AMR-WB payload format in every incoming RTP packet.
For EVS, the CMR related procedures in subclause A.2.2.1.1 of 3GPP TS 26.445
[125] apply.
If the MTSI client supports RTCP-APP packets, it shall also accept CMR in
every incoming RTCP-APP packet.
The MTSI client shall follow each received CMR as soon as possible.
NOTE 3: There is no upper limit defined for the reaction time; it is expected
that typically the media-sender reacts within less than 40ms after the
reception of a new CMR value.
###### 7.5.2.1.2.3 Frame aggregation and redundancy
The MTSI client should send one speech frame encapsulated in each RTP packet
unless the session setup or adaptation request defines that the other MTSI
client wants to receive another encapsulation variant.
The MTSI client should request to receive one speech frame encapsulated in
each RTP packet but shall accept any number of frames per RTP packet up to the
maximum limit of 12 speech frames per RTP packet.
For application-layer redundancy, see clause 9.2.
##### 7.5.2.1.3 HSPA
Use default operation as defined in clause 7.5.2.1.2.
NOTE: The RLC PDU sizes defined in 3GPP TR 25.993 [33] have been optimized for
the codec modes, payload formats and frame encapsulations defined in the
default operation in clause 7.5.2.1.2.
##### 7.5.2.1.4 EGPRS
Use default operation as defined in clause 7.5.2.1.2, except that the MTSI
client in terminal
\- should send two speech frames encapsulated in each RTP packet unless the
session setup or adaptation request defines that the other PS end-point want
to receive another encapsulation variant;
\- should request receiving two speech frames encapsulated in each RTP packet
but shall accept any number of frames per RTP packet up to the maximum limit
of 12 speech frames per RTP packet.
##### 7.5.2.1.5 GIP
Use default operation as defined in clause 7.5.2.1.2, except that the MTSI
client in terminal:
\- should send 0, 1, 2, 3 or 4 non-redundant speech frames encapsulated in
each RTP packet unless the session setup or adaptation request defines that
other PS end-point want to receive another encapsulation variant;
\- should request receiving 1 to 4 speech frames in each RTP packet but shall
accept any number of frames per RTP packet up to the maximum limit of 12
speech frames per RTP packet;
\- may use application layer redundancy, in which case the MTSI client in
terminal may encapsulate up to 12 speech frames in each RTP packet, with a
maximum of four non-redundant speech frames.
##### 7.5.2.1.6 Initial codec mode for AMR and AMR-WB
To avoid congestion on the link and to improve inter-working with CS GERAN
when AMR or AMR-WB is used and when more than one codec mode is allowed in the
session, the MTSI client in terminal should limit the initial codec mode (ICM)
to one of the lowest codec modes for an Initial Waiting Time from the
beginning of the RTP stream, or until it receives one of the following:
\- a frame-block with rate control information; or:
\- an RTCP message with rate control information; or:
\- reception quality feedback information, e.g. PLR or jitter in RTCP Sender
Reports or Receiver Reports, indicating that the currently used codec mode is
too high for the current operating condition.
The value for the Initial Waiting Time is 600 ms when ECN is not used and 500
ms when ECN is used, unless configured differently by the MTSI Media
Adaptation Management as described in Clause 17.
The rate control information can either be: a CMR with a value other than '15'
in the RTP payload; or a CMR with a value other than '15' in an RTCP_APP
message (see Clause 10.2.1).
NOTE: A CMR with a value of '15' means that no mode request is present [28].
If no rate control information is received within the Initial Waiting Time,
then the sending MTSI client in terminal should gradually increase the codec
mode from the ICM towards the highest codec mode allowed in the session. While
not detecting poor transmission performance or not receiving rate control
information, the sending MTSI client in terminal should use step-wise up-
switch to avoid introducing congestion during the upwards adaptation. The
step-wise up-switch should be performed by switching to the next higher codec
mode in the allowed mode set and then waiting for an Initial Up-switch Waiting
Time before each subsequent up-switch until the first down-switch occurs.
The value for the Initial Up-switch Waiting Time is 600 ms when ECN is not
used and 500 ms when ECN is used, unless configured differently by the MTSI
Media Adaptation Management as described in Clause 17.
The following rules can be used for determining the ICM:
> \- If 1 codec mode is included in the mode-set then this should be the ICM.
>
> \- If 2 or 3 codec modes are included in the mode-set then the ICM should be
> the codec mode with the lowest rate.
>
> \- If 4 or more codec modes are included in the mode-set then the ICM should
> be the codec mode with the 2^nd^ lowest rate.
NOTE: Without ECN, the Initial Waiting Time needs to be long enough to allow
the receiver to collect relilable statistics for the adaptation, e.g. for PLR-
triggered or jitter-triggered adaptation. With ECN, a congested network can
immediately mark IP packets with ECN-CE, which allows the ECN-triggered
adaptation react sooner. The Initial Waiting Time can therefore be shorter
when ECN is used. The same applies for the Initial Up-switch Waiting Time.
##### 7.5.2.1.7 E-UTRAN
Use the default operation as defined in Clause 7.5.2.1.2.
##### 7.5.2.1.8 Initial codec mode for EVS
When the EVS AMR-WB IO mode is used from the start of the session, the Initial
Codec Mode (ICM) should be selected as defined in Clause 7.5.2.1.6 for AMR-WB.
When EVS Primary mode is used from the start of the session, the following
principles apply for the selection of the Initial Codec Mode bit-rate (ICMbr):
\- If GBR is known and if GBR is less than MBR, the ICMbr should be aligned
with the GBR or should be lower than GBR.
When EVS Primary mode is used from the start of the session, the Initial Codec
Mode audio bandwidth (ICMab) should be the highest audio bandwidth negotiated
for the Initial Codec Mode bit-rate (ICMbr).
##### 7.5.2.1.9 Dual-mono
An MTSI client may support dual-mono operation for EVS.
The packetization of dual-mono for EVS is described in [125]. When the EVS
Primary mode is used for dual-mono encoding, the Header-full format must be
used for all RTP packets.
When offering dual-mono for an RTP payload type number, the number of channels
is set to 2, see SDP example in Annex A.14.
#### 7.5.2.2 Video
An MTSI client should follow general strategies for error-resilient coding
(segmentation) and packetization as specified by each codec [24][119] and RTP
payload format [25][120] specification. Further guidelines on how the video
media data should be packetized during a session are provided in this clause.
Coded pictures should be encoded into individual segments:
\- For H.264 (AVC), a slice corresponds to such a segment.
\- For H.265 (HEVC), a slice segment corresponds to such a segment.
Each individual segment should be encapsulated in one RTP packet. Each RTP
packet should be smaller than the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) size.
NOTE 1: Unnecessary video segmentation, e.g. within RTP packets, may reduce
coding efficiency.
NOTE 2: RTP packet fragmentation, e.g. across UDP boundaries, may decrease
transport overhead and reduce error robustness. Hence, packet size granularity
is a trade-off between error robustness and overhead that may be tuned
according to bearer access characteristics if available.
NOTE 3: In most cases, the MTU-size has a direct relationship with the bearer
of the radio network.
#### 7.5.2.3 Text
Real-time text is intended for human conversation applications. Text shall not
be transferred with higher rate than 30 characters per second (as defined for
cps in section 6 of RFC 4103 [31]). A text-capable MTSI client shall be able
to receive text with cps set up to 30.
### 7.5.3 Media synchronization
#### 7.5.3.1 General
RTCP SR shall be used for media synchronization by setting the NTP and RTP
timestamps according to RFC 3550 [9]. To enable quick media synchronization
when a new media component is added, or an MTSI session is initiated, the RTP
sender should send RTCP Sender Reports for all newly started media components
as early as possible.
NOTE: An MTSI sender can signal in SDP that no synchronization between media
components is required. See clause 6.2.6 and clause A.7.
#### 7.5.3.2 Text
The media synchronization requirements for real-time text are relaxed. A
synchronization error between text and other media of a maximum of 3 seconds
is accepted. Since this is longer than the maximum accepted latency, no
specific methods need to be applied to assure to meet the requirement
### 7.5.4 ECN usage in RTP sessions
Once the ECN negotiation has been completed as defined in [84], then only
ECT(0) shall be used when marking packets with ECT, [83]. When ECN is used for
an RTP stream then the sending MTSI client shall mark every packet with ECT
until the end of the session or until the session is re-negotiated to no
longer use ECN. The leap-of-faith method is used for the ECN initiation.
Handling of ECN Congestion Experience (ECN-CE) marked packets is described in
clause 10.
### 7.5.5 Handling of bit-rate variations
#### 7.5.5.1 General
An MTSI client in terminal using variable bitrate encoding shall ensure for
speech, and should ensure for video, that the transmitted bandwidth does not
exceed the negotiated bandwidth (b=AS) nor the QoS bandwidth parameters (MBR,
GBR) for the bearer, if defined and known. This can, in general, be done in
two ways: either by controlling the bit-rate used for encoding each media
frame or by controlling when the generated packets are transmitted.
NOTE 1: This bit-rate control is not to be confused with rate adaptation,
which is described in clause 10. The main purpose of the bitrate control is to
reduce the risk that policing functions in the network drop media packets
since the bandwidth of packets is temporarily exceeding the allowed bandwidth,
which is typically configured in a static fashion. Rate adaptation is instead
used to ensure that the used bandwidth is sufficiently low to avoid packet
losses and extended delays when operating conditions change.
NOTE 2: Controlling when packets are transmitted is called "packet pacing".
The drawback with packet pacing is the increase of end-to-end delay. Excessive
use of packet pacing can lead to not fulfilling the service requirements
defined in 3GPP TS 22.105 [34]. Packet pacing therefore needs to be used with
care.
The method to control the encoding bitrate and/or the transmission of packets
is left for the discretion of the implementation. However, the average
bandwidth of transmitted packets shall be calculated over a sliding window
that is no longer than T seconds. Different media types may use different
window lengths. The default window length T is 2 seconds if nothing else is
specified below.
The bitrate control ensures that the average bandwidth of transmitted media
packets does not exceed the maximum allowed bandwidth in the sending
direction.
The maximum allowed bandwidth for the sending direction is the smaller of:
\- The b=AS bandwidth,
\- The MBR for the bearer, after compensating for the RTCP bandwidth, if
known.
#### 7.5.5.2 Video
Video encoders use variable bitrate encoding to ensure a sufficiently low
average bit-rate, which allow temporarily encoding a few frames at high bit-
rate to match the video content with high motion activity or complex scenes,
or to send an Intra frame, e.g. , when a Full Intra Request (FIR) is received.
The bitrate control should ensure that the average bandwidth of transmitted
media packets does not exceed the maximum allowed bandwidth in the sending
direction.
The bit-rate control requires managing the following properties:
\- The size of large frame to transmit;
\- The proportion of neighboring frames that can be reduced in size;
\- The length of averaging window.
When any two of the properties are known, it is possible to determine the
third.
3GPP TR 26.924 [144] Annex A describes a method for determining the length of
the averaging window from the other two properties. The same method can also
be used to determine the portion of the bit-rate for frames neighboring the
large frame, which needs to be reduced depending on the size of the frame and
the length of the averaging window.
The recommended procedure consists of reducing the encoding bit-rate of the
frames neighboring the large frame in a balanced fashion, taking into account
the spatio-temporal tradeoff of video quality when the encoding parameters
such as quantization step or frame rate are adjusted. This may even require
dropping some frames before they are encoded.
When a FIR is received, the MTSI client in terminal may delay the generation
and transmission of an Intra frame by up to a half of the averaging window.
#### 7.5.5.3 Speech
When speech is operated in a Source-Controlled Variable Bit Rate mode (e.g.,
EVS 5.9VBR), both the GBR and MBR need to be set at least as high as the
highest rate used by the codec in this mode (e.g., 8.0kbps for EVS 5.9VBR).
These rates may be set higher for a session if, in addition to the VBR mode, a
higher rate codec mode is also negotiated for the session. Therefore, packet
policing on the MBR or GBR will not prevent the transport of VBR media packets
regardless of the averaging window used.
# 8 Jitter buffer management in MTSI clients in terminals
## 8.1 General
This clause specifies mechanisms to handle delay jitter in MTSI clients in
terminals.
## 8.2 Speech
### 8.2.1 Terminology
In the following paragraph(s), Jitter Buffer Management (JBM) denotes the
actual buffer as well as any control, adaptation and media processing
algorithm (excluding speech decoder) used in the management of the jitter
induced in the transport channel. An illustration of an exemplary structure of
an MTSI speech receiver with adaptive jitter buffer is shown in figure 8.1 to
clarify the terminology and the relation between different functional
components.
Figure 8.1: Example structure of an MTSI speech receiver
The blocks \"network analyzer\" and \"adaptation control logic\" together with
the information on buffer status form the actual buffer control functionality,
whereas \"speech decoder\" and \"adaptation unit\" provide the media
processing functionality. Note that the external playback device control
driving the media processing is not shown in figure 8.1.
The grey dashed lines indicate the measurement points for the jitter buffer
delay, i.e. the difference between the decoder consumption time and the
arrival time of the speech frame to the JBM.
The functional processing blocks are as follows:
**\- Buffer:** The jitter buffer unpacks the incoming RTP payloads and stores
the received speech frames. The buffer status may be used as input to the
adaptation decision logic. Furthermore, the buffer is also linked to the
speech decoder to provide frames for decoding when they are requested for
decoding.
**\- Network analyser:** The network analysis functionality is used to monitor
the incoming packet stream and to collect reception statistics (e.g. jitter,
packet loss) that are needed for jitter buffer adaptation. Note that this
block can also include e.g. the functionality needed to maintain statistics
required by the RTCP if it is being used.
**\- Adaptation control logic:** The control logic adjusting playback delay
and operating the adaptation functionality makes decisions on the buffering
delay adjustments and required media adaptation actions based on the buffer
status (e.g. average buffering delay, buffer occupancy, etc.) and input from
the network analyser. Furthermore, external control input can be used e.g. to
enable inter-media synchronisation or other external scaling requests. The
control logic may utilize different adaptation strategies such as fixed jitter
buffer (without adaptation and time scaling), simple adaptation during comfort
noise periods or buffer adaptation also during active speech. The general
operation is controlled with desired proportion of frames arriving late,
adaptation strategy and adaptation rate.
> **\- Speech decoder:** The standard AMR, AMR-WB or EVS speech decoder. Note
> that the speech decoder is also assumed to include error concealment / bad
> frame handling functionality. Speech decoder may be used with or without the
> adaptation unit.
**\- Adaptation unit:** The adaptation unit shortens or extends the output
signal length according to requests given by the adaptation control logic to
enable buffer delay adjustment in a transparent manner. The adaptation is
performed using the frame based or sample based time scaling on the decoder
output signal during comfort noise periods only or during active speech and
comfort noise. The buffer control logic should have a mechanism to limit the
maximum scaling ratio. Providing a scaling window in which the targeted time
scale modifications are performed improves the situation in certain scenarios
- e.g. when reacting to the clock drift or to a request of inter-media
(re)synchronization - by allowing flexibility in allocating the scaling
request on several frames and performing the scaling on a content-aware
manner. The adaptation unit may be implemented either in a separate entity
from the speech decoder or embedded within the decoder.
### 8.2.2 Functional requirements for jitter-buffer management
The functional requirements for the speech JBM guarantee appropriate
management of jitter which shall be the same for all speech JBM
implementations used in MTSI clients in terminals. A JBM implementation used
in MTSI shall support the following requirements, but is not limited in
functionality to these requirements. They are to be seen as a minimum set of
functional requirements supported by every speech JBM used in MTSI.
Speech JBM used in MTSI shall:
\- support source-controlled rate operation as well as non-source-controlled
rate operation;
\- be able to receive the de-packetized frames out of order and present them
in order for decoder consumption;
\- be able to receive duplicate speech frames and only present unique speech
frames for decoder consumption;
\- be able to handle clock drift between the encoding and decoding end-points.
### 8.2.3 Minimum performance requirements for jitter-buffer management
#### 8.2.3.1 General
An MTSI client in terminal supporting speech shall use a JBM fulfilling the
minimum performance requirements defined in this clause. The JBM specified in
[128] fulfils these minimum performance requirements and should be used for
EVS. The EVS JBM may also be used for other codecs.
The jitter buffering time is the time spent by a speech frame in the JBM. It
is measured as the difference between the decoding start time and the arrival
time of the speech frame to the JBM. The frames that are discarded by the JBM
are not counted in the measure.
The minimum performance requirements consist of objective criteria for delay
and jitter-induced concealment operations. In order for a JBM implementation
to pass the minimum performance requirements all objective criteria shall be
met.
A JBM implementation used in MTSI shall comply with the following design
guidelines:
1\. The overall design of the JBM shall be to minimize the buffering time at
all times while still conforming to the minimum performance requirements of
jitter induced concealment operations and the design guidelines for sample-
based timescaling (as set in bullet point 3);
2\. If the limit of jitter induced concealment operations cannot be met, it is
always preferred to increase the buffering time in order to avoid growing
jitter induced concealment operations going beyond the stated limit above.
This guideline applies even if that means that end-to-end delay requirement
given in 3GPP TS **22.105** [34] can no longer be met;
3\. If sample-based time scaling is used (after speech decoder), then
artefacts caused by time scaling operation shall be kept to a minimum. **Time
scaling means the modification of the signal by stretching and/or compressing
it over the time axis. The following guidelines on time scaling apply:**
\- Use of a high-quality time scaling algorithm is recommended;
\- The amount of scaling should be as low as possible;
\- Scaling should be applied as infrequently as possible;
\- Oscillating behaviour is not allowed.
NOTE: If the end-to-end delay for the ongoing session is known to the MTSI
client in terminal and measured to be less than 150 ms (as defined in 3GPP TS
22.105 [34]), the JBM may relax its buffering time minimization criteria in
favour of reduced JBM adaptation artefacts if such a relaxation will improve
the media quality. Note that a relaxation is not allowed when testing for
compliance with the minimum performance requirements specified in clauses
8.2.3.2.2 and 8.2.3.2.3.
#### 8.2.3.2 Objective performance requirements
##### 8.2.3.2.1 General
The objective performance requirements consist of criteria for delay, time
scaling and jitter-induced concealment operations.
The objective minimum performance requirements are divided into three parts:
1\. Limiting the jitter buffering time to provide as low end-to-end delay as
possible.
2\. Limiting the jitter induced concealment operations, i.e. setting limits on
the allowed induced losses in the jitter buffer due to late losses, re-
bufferings, and buffer overflows.
3\. Limiting the use of time scaling to adapt the buffering depth in order to
avoid introducing time scaling artefacts on the speech media.
In order to fulfil the objective performance requirements, the JBM under test
needs to pass the respective criteria using the six channels as defined in
clause 8.2.3.3. Note that in order to pass the criteria for a specific
channel, all three requirements must be fulfilled.
##### 8.2.3.2.2 Jitter buffer delay criteria
**The reference delay computation algorithm in Annex D defines the performance
requirements for the set of delay and error profiles described in clause
8.2.3.3. The JBM algorithm under test shall meet these performance
requirements. The performance requirements shall be a threshold for the
Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the speech-frame delay introduced by
the reference delay computation algorithm. A CDF threshold is set by shifting
the reference delay computation algorithm CDF 60 ms. The speech-frame delay
CDF is defined as:**
_P(x) = Probability (delay_compensation_by_JBM ≤ x)_
The relation between the reference delay computation algorithm and the CDF
threshold is outlined in figure 8.2.
Figure 8.2: Example showing the relation between the reference delay
algorithm\ and the CDF threshold - the delay and error profile 4 in table 8.1
has been used
The JBM algorithm under test shall achieve lower or same delay than that set
by the CDF threshold for at least 90 % of the speech frames. The values for
the CDF shall be collected for the full length of each delay and error
profile. The delay measure in the criteria is measured as the time each speech
frame spends in the JBM; i.e. the difference between the decoder consumption
time and the arrival time of the speech frame to the JBM.
The parameter settings for the reference delay computation algorithm are:
\- adaptation_lookback = 200;
\- delay_delta_max = 20;
\- target_loss= 0.5.
##### 8.2.3.2.3 Jitter induced concealment operations
The jitter induced concealment operations include:
\- JBM induced removal of a speech frame, i.e. buffer overflow or intentional
frame dropping when reducing the buffer depth during adaptation.
\- Deletion of a speech frame because it arrived at the JBM too late.
\- Modification of the output timeline due to link loss.
\- Jitter-induced insertion of a speech frame controlled by the JBM (e.g.
buffer underflow).
Link losses handled as error concealment and not changing the output timeline
shall not be counted in the jitter induced concealment operations.
_Jitter loss rate = JBM triggered concealed frames / Number of transmitted
frames_
The jitter loss rate shall be calculated for active speech frames only.
NOTE: SID_FIRST and SID_UPDATE frames belong to the non-active speech period,
hence concealment for losses of such frames should not be included in the
statistics.
The jitter loss rate shall be below 1% for every channel measured over the
full length of the respective channel. The value of 1 % was chosen because
such a loss rate will usually not significantly reduce the speech quality.
#### 8.2.3.3 Delay and error profiles
Six different delay and error profiles are used to check the tested JBM for
compliance with the minimum performance requirements. The profiles span a
large range of operating conditions in which the JBM shall provide sufficient
performance for the MTSI service. All profiles are 7 500 IP packets long.

electronically

formatted as raw text files with one delay entry per line. The delay entries
are written in milliseconds and packet losses are entered as \"-1\". Note that
when testing for compliance, the starting point in the delay and error profile
shall be randomized.
#### 8.2.3.4 Speech material for JBM minimum performance evaluation
The files described in table 8.2 and attached to the present document in the
zip-archive \"JBM_evaluation_files.zip\" shall be used for evaluation of a JBM
against the minimum performance requirements. The data is stored as RTP
packets, formatted according to \"RTP dump\" format [41]. The input to these
files is AMR or AMR-WB encoded frames, encapsulated into RTP packets using the
octet-aligned mode of the AMR RTP payload format [28].

## 8.3 Video
Video receivers should implement an adaptive video de-jitter buffer. The
overall design of the buffer should aim to minimize delay, maintain
synchronization with speech, and minimize dropping of late packets. The exact
implementation is left to the implementer.
## 8.4 Text
Conversational quality of real-time text is experienced as being good, even
with up to one second end-to-end text delay. Strict jitter buffer management
is therefore not needed for text. Basic jitter buffer management for text is
described in section 5 of RFC 4103 [31] where a calculation is described for
the time allowed before an extra delayed text packet may be regarded to be
lost.
# 9 Packet-loss handling
## 9.1 General
This clause specifies some methods to handle conditions with packet losses.
Packet losses in general will also trigger adaptation, which is specified in
clause 10.
The 'a=bw-info' attribute defined in clause 19 allows for negotiating how much
additional bandwidth (if any) may be used for application layer redundancy in
the session. When application layer redundancy is used, the media bandwidth
negotiated for the session may need to be increased, i.e. by increasing the
value used for the b=AS bandwidth modifier. The b=AS bandwidth modifier is
however only a single value, which also applies only to the receiving
direction. When an MTSI client in terminal sends the SDP, it is therefore not
possible for the networks and the other client to know if the intention is to
use the entire media bandwidth all the time (both with and without
redundancy); or if the intention is to use the b=AS bandwidth only when
redundancy is needed and to use a lower bandwidth when redundancy is not
needed. It is also not possible to know what the MTSI client in terminal can
do in the sending direction. The 'a=bw-info' attribute (see clause 19) offers
an improved negotiation mechanism to better know what the MTSI client in
terminal can do and what it intends to do. This is further discussed in TR
26.924 [144].
## 9.2 Speech
### 9.2.1 General
This clause provides a recommendation for a simple application layer
redundancy scheme that is useful in order to handle operational conditions
with severe packet loss rates. Simple application layer redundancy is
generated by encapsulating one or more previously transmitted speech frames
into the same RTP packet as the current previously not transmitted frame(s).
An RTP packet may thus contain zero, one or several redundant speech frames
and zero, one or several non-redundant speech frames.
When transmitting redundancy, the MTSI client should switch to a lower codec
mode, if possible. An MTSI client using AMR or AMR-WB shall utilize the codec
mode rates within the negotiated codec mode set with the negotiated adaptation
steps and limitations as defined by mode-change-neighbor and mode-change-
period. It is recommended to not send redundant speech frames before the
targeted codec mode is reached. Table 9.1 defines the recommended codec modes
for different redundancy level combinations.
When application layer redundancy is used for AMR or AMR-WB encoded speech
media, the transmitting application may use up to 300 % redundancy, i.e. a
speech frame transported in one RTP packet may be repeated in 3 other RTP
packets.

redundancy is supported

supported) AMR12.65 AMR 6.60
### 9.2.2 Transmitting redundant frames
When transmitting redundant frames, the redundant frames should be
encapsulated together with non-redundant media data as shown in figure 9.1.
The frames shall be consecutive with the oldest frame placed first in the
packet and the most recent frame placed last in the packet. The RTP Timestamp
shall represent the sampling time of the first sample in the oldest frame
transmitted in the packet.
NOTE: When switching from no redundancy to using redundancy, the RTP Timestamp
may be the same for consecutive RTP packets.
Figure 9.1: Redundant and non-redundant frames in the case of 100 %
redundancy,\ when the original packing is 1 frame per packet
Figure 9.1 shows only one non-redundant frame encapsulated together with one
redundant frame. It is allowed to encapsulate several non-redundant frames
with one or several redundant frames. The following combinations of non-
redundant frames and redundant frames can be used.
Table 9.2: Example frame encapsulation with different redundancy levels and
when maxptime is 240
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Original | Encapsulation | Encapsulation | Encapsulation | | encapsulation | with 100 % | with 200 % | with 300 % | | (without | redundancy | redundancy | redundancy | | redundancy) | | | | +================+================+================+================+ | 1 frame per | ≤ 1 | ≤ 1 | ≤ 1 | | packet | non-redundant | non-redundant | non-redundant | | | frame and | frame and | frame and | | | | | | | | ≤ 1 redundant | ≤ 2 redundant | ≤ 3 redundant | | | frame | frames | frames | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 2 frames per | ≤ 2 | ≤ 2 | ≤ 2 | | packet | non-redundant | non-redundant | non-redundant | | | frames and | frames and | frames and | | | | | | | | ≤ 2 redundant | ≤ 4 redundant | ≤ 6 redundant | | | frames | frames | frames | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 3 frames per | ≤ 3 | ≤ 3 | ≤ 3 | | packet | non-redundant | non-redundant | non-redundant | | | frames and | frames and | frames and | | | | | | | | ≤ 3 redundant | ≤ 6 redundant | ≤ 9 redundant | | | frames | frames | frames | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | 4 frames per | ≤ 4 | ≤ 4 | Not allowed | | packet | non-redundant | non-redundant | since maxptime | | | frames and | frames and | does not allow | | | | | more than | | | ≤ 4 redundant | ≤ 8 redundant | 12 frames per | | | frames | frames | RTP packet in | | | | | this example | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
With a maxptime value of 240, it is possible to encapsulate up to 12 frames
per packet. It is therefore not allowed to use 300 % when the original
encapsulation is 4 frames per packet, as shown in table 9.2. If the
receiver\'s maxptime value is lower than 240 then even more combinations of
original encapsulation and redundancy level will be prohibited.
The sender shall also ensure that the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) is not
exceeded when sending the IP/UDP/RTP packet.
Figure 9.2 shows an example where the frame aggregation is 2 frames per packet
and when 100 % redundancy added.
Figure 9.2: Redundant and non-redundant frames in the case of 100 %
redundancy,\ when the original packing is 2 frames per packet
A redundant frame may be replaced by a NO_DATA frame. If the transmitter wants
to encapsulate non-consecutive frames into one RTP packet, then NO_DATA frames
shall be inserted for the frames that are not transmitted in order to create
frames that are consecutive within the packet. This method is used when
sending redundancy with an offset, see figure 9.3.
Figure 9.3: Redundant and non-redundant frames in the case of 100 %
redundancy, when the original\ packing is 1 frame per packet and when the
redundancy is transmitted with an offset of 20 ms
Note that with this scheme, the receiver may receive a frame 3 times: first
the non-redundant encoding; then as a NO_DATA frame; and finally the redundant
frame. Other combinations of redundancy and offset may result in receiving
even more copies of a frame. The proper receiver behaviour is described in the
AMR/AMR-WB payload format [28] and in the EVS payload format [125],
respectively.
For any combinations of frame aggregation, redundancy and redundancy offset,
the transmitter shall not exceed the frame encapsulation limit indicated by
the receiver\'s maxptime value when constructing the RTP packet.
When source controlled rate operation is used, it is allowed to send redundant
media data without any non-redundant media, if no non-redundant media is
available.
NOTE 1: When going from active speech to DTX, there may be no non-redundant
frames in the end of the talk spurt while there still are redundant frames
that need to be transmitted.
In the end of a talk spurt, when there are no more non-redundant frames to
transmit, it is allowed to drop the redundant frames that are in the queue for
transmission.
NOTE 2: This ensures that it is possible to use redundancy without increasing
the packet rate. The quality degradation by having less redundancy for the
last frames should be negligible since these last frames typically contain
only background noise.
### 9.2.3 Receiving redundant frames
In order to receive and decode redundant media properly, the receiving
application shall sort the received frames based on the RTP Timestamp and
shall remove duplicated frames. If multiple versions of a frame are received,
i.e. encoded with different bitrates, then the frame encoded with the highest
bitrate should be used for decoding.
## 9.3 Video
### 9.3.1 General
MTSI clients can use the following mechanisms to recover from packet losses:
> • AVPF Generic NACK and Picture Loss Indication (PLI) feedback messages
>
> • RTP Retransmission
>
> • Forward Error Correction (FEC)
These mechanisms offer different performance tradeoff according to channel
conditions: end-to-end delay, bandwidth, rate and profile of packet losses.
AVPF NACK messages are used by MTSI clients to indicate non-received RTP
packets for video (see clause 7.3.3). An MTSI client transmitting video can
use this information, as well as the AVPF Picture Loss Indication (PLI), to at
its earliest opportunity take appropriate action to recover video from errors
for the MTSI client that sent the NACK or PLI message. Recovery from error
action is defined as sending a recovery picture that is equivalent to a good
frame in clause 16.2.1, sending Gradual Decoder Refresh (GDR) that results in
a good frame, or retransmitting missing packets. Requirements and
recommendations for packet loss handling are described below.
Recommendation regarding usage under various channel conditions of error
recovery mechanisms available for MTSI clients are provided in clause 9.3.4.
### 9.3.2 Receiver behaviour
When NACK and PLI have been negotiated without retransmission support for the
session then an MTSI client in terminal receiving media:
\- shall immediately queue a NACK message for RTCP scheduling upon detection
of first error after decoding a good frame.
\- should repeat queuing NACK messages for RTCP scheduling after an RWT
duration if recovery picture does not arrive.
> \- shall queue a PLI message for RTCP scheduling if a recovery picture does
> not arrive in two RWT duration, and shall then stop sending NACK messages
> that relate to the same data as that PLI.
>
> \- shall repeat queuing PLI messages for RTCP scheduling after an RWT
> duration if the initially requested recovery picture does not arrive.
Receiver may report more losses or repeat messages if it deems necessary. As a
minimum requirement on the receiver side, it shall support the capability of
picture level error detection or tracking in order to stop reporting of prior
losses from the recovery point. If FEC is supported, NACK messages should
signal irrecoverable lost packets after recovery by FEC instead of the
detected lost packets before recovery. The receiver should wait "repair-
window" duration before issuing a NACK message for the missing packets.
When retransmission is supported, NACK messages correspond to requests for
missing packets to be retransmitted instead of indication of error position
for recovery without retransmission. The receiver should queue NACK messages
for RTCP scheduling as necessary. The importance of lost packets along with
possibility of timely arrival of requested packets should be considered before
requesting retransmission.
Annex P.2 gives further description of receiver behaviour for error
correction.
### 9.3.3 Sender behaviour
When NACK and PLI have been negotiated without retransmission support for the
session then an MTSI client in terminal sending media:
\- shall send a recovery picture or Gradual Decoder Refresh (GDR) upon
receiving NACK message if loss indicated by the message corresponds to error
in a reference picture within 500 ms. If a recovery picture corresponding to
the NACK message was sent prior to reception of the NACK message by less than
RWT duration, the sender does not have to respond to this particular NACK
message.
\- shall send an Instantaneous Decoder Refresh (IDR) or GDR picture upon
receiving PLI message within 500 ms.
> \- should not respond to incoming NACK or PLI messages within RWT duration
> of the same message type indicating the same loss from the reception of the
> initial feedback message triggered by the onset of the loss.
IDR picture is an intra picture where pictures following the IDR picture can
be decoded without referring (inter prediction) to pictures decoded prior to
IDR picture. This corresponds to IDR pictures in H.264 and HEVC. GDR is
performing intra refresh by distributing intra picture data over _N_ pictures.
At the end of _N_ pictures from the start of GDR all macroblock regions are
intra coded (refreshed) generating a good frame. Similar to IDR case, if intra
picture or GDR is used as a recovery mechanism, the pictures following the
intra picture or the GDR pictures should not reference pictures decoded prior
to these pictures.
When retransmission is supported, sender should retransmit packets that it
deems beneficial for timely recovery. Only source packets should be
retransmitted. The minimum time the sender should keep an original RTP packet
in its buffers available for retransmission, i.e. \"rtx-time\" value, should
be RTT and the maximum time the sender should keep an original RTP packet
should be 400 ms.
When FEC is supported, the amount of time that spans the source and the
corresponding repair packets, i.e. \"repair-window\", should not be less than
the minimum required duration for the bitmask used for generation of the
repair packets. The maximum time that spans the source and corresponding
repair packets should not be more than 300 ms.
An MTSI client in terminal sending video shall obey the rate restrictions
imposed by the video rate adaptation specified in clause 10.3.
Annex P.2 gives further description of sender behaviour for error correction.
Annex P.3 gives further description of sender and receiver behaviour for RTP
retransmission based recovery.
### 9.3.4 Recommendations for packet loss recovery mechanisms usage
FEC should be used to provide robustness against moderate packet loss rates at
high delay scenario. FEC can especially handle random losses and short burst
losses and be beneficial in environments with high packet loss rates and/or
high delay (RTT). The use of FEC may not be appropriate when packet losses are
caused by insufficient throughput (over radio access or due to congestions in
network) since it introduces some bit rate overhead. In order to compensate
for bit rate overhead, FEC should be used with efficient rate adaptation
mechanisms to reduce the source bit rate according to channel conditions and
not increase the total RTP bitrate. When error cases cannot be recovered by
FEC, other mechanisms are needed in combination with FEC.
\- Retransmission in combination with FEC should be used for the low RTT case
with relatively high packet loss since retransmission can efficiently handle
the FEC failure case.
\- Generic NACK based recovery in combination with FEC should be used for high
RTT, relatively high packet loss conditions since generic NACK based recovery
does not introduce additional delay.
Selective retransmission should be used under low delay (RTT) and low failure
(loss) rate conditions. Retransmission needs to ensure that retransmitted
packets arrive in time to meet delay requirements of the end-to-end system.
Higher packet loss rates may cause loss of retransmitted packets, hence
leading to larger end-to-end delay.
Generic NACK and PLI based error correction mechanism should be used in
combination with FEC or selective retransmission or under low packet loss
rates with high RTT conditions. Generic NACK message can be used for
indication of packets to be retransmitted as well as informing the sender of
loss of particular RTP packets for sender to take necessary actions to recover
from errors.
NOTE: Under unknown and varying conditions the MTSI client should dynamically
select & adapt the propoer mechanisms.
Additional information on the usage of these mechanisms is provided in [142].
## 9.4 Text
Redundant transmission provided by the RTP payload format as described in RFC
4103 [31] shall be supported. The transmitting application may use up to 200 %
redundancy, i.e. a T140block transported in one RTP packet may be repeated
once or twice in subsequent RTP packets. 200 % redundancy shall be used when
the conditions along the call path are not known to be free of loss. However,
the result of media negotiation shall be followed, and transmission without
redundancy used if one of the parties does not show capability for redundancy.
The sampling time shall be 300 ms as a minimum (in order to keep the bandwidth
down) and should not be longer than 500 ms. New text after an idle period
shall be sent as soon as possible. The first packet after an idle-period shall
have the M-bit set.
The procedure described in section 5 of RFC 4103 [31], or a procedure with
equivalent or better performance, shall be used for packet-loss handling in
the receiving MTSI client in terminal.
# 10 Adaptation
## 10.1 General
Adaptive mechanisms are used to optimize the session quality given the current
transport characteristics. The mechanisms provided in MTSI are bit-rate,
packet-rate and error resilience adaptation. These mechanisms can be used in
different ways; however, they should only be used when the result of the
adaptation is assumed to increase the session quality even if e.g. the source
bit-rate is reduced.
Adaptive mechanisms that act upon measured or signalled changes in the
transport channel characteristics may be used in a conservative manner.
Examples of measured changes in transport characteristics are variations in
Packet Loss Rate (PLR) and delay jitter. Examples of signalled changes in
transport characteristics are ANBR (see clause 10.7) and ECN Congestion
Experienced (ECN-CE) marking in IP packet headers. A conservative use of
adaptation is characterized by a fast response to degrading conditions, and a
slower, careful upwards adaptation intended to return the session media
settings to the original default state of the session. The long-term goal of
any adaptive mechanism is assumed to be a restoration of the session quality
to the originally negotiated quality. The short-term goal is to maximize the
session quality given the current transport characteristics, even if that
means that the adapted state of the session will give a lower session quality
compared to the session default state if transported on an undisturbed
channel.
The 'a=bw-info' attribute defined in Clause 19 may be used to align the
adaptation with the bearer setup and the end-to-end resource allocation. A few
recommendations are described in sub-clause 10.6.
## 10.2 Speech
### 10.2.0 General
To reduce the risk for confusion in the media-sender, it is beneficial if the
signaling from media-receiver back to media-sender for the media adaptation is
the same regardless of which triggers are used in the adaptation-decision in
the media-receiver. The ANBR described in clause 10.7 can, if supported by
both the access network and the MTSI client in terminal, be used as one such
trigger.
NOTE: The media-receiver is aware that other nodes in the media path may also
influence the media adaptation. A media-receiver sending a specific CMR value
X can expect that (after some time) no media is received with a mode higher
than X, but modes lower than X may be received any time.
The adaptation for AMR, AMR-WB and EVS includes adapting the media bit-rate,
the frame aggregation, the redundancy level and the redundancy offset. The
domain of adaptation for EVS furthermore includes adapting audio bandwidth,
partial redundancy, switching between EVS primary mode and EVS AMR-WB IO mode.
When the AMR codec or the AMR-WB codec is used, two signaling mechanisms are
defined:
\- CMR in the AMR/AMR-WB RTP payload, [28].\ CMR in RTP can be used by the
media-receiver to restrict the codec mode in the remote media-sender to an
upper limit (maximum mode).
\- RTCP-APP, see clause 10.2.1.\ If the media-sender supports RTCP-APP, then
the media-receiver can use it in the following way:\ CMR in RTCP-APP can be
used by the media-receiver to restrict the codec mode in the remote media-
sender to an upper limit (maximum mode), in addition to CMR in RTP.\ RTCP-APP
can further be used by the media-receiver for the adaptation of frame
aggregation, redundancy level and redundancy offset in the RTP packets to be
sent by the remote media-sender.
When the EVS codec is used, the following signaling mechanism is defined:
\- CMR in the EVS RTP payload, [125].
\- RTCP-APP, see clause 10.2.1.
When adapting frame aggregation and/or redundancy, the MTSI client must verify
that the maximum packetization, defined by the maxptime SDP parameter, is not
exceeded. The MTSI client must also verify that the IP packet sizes does not
exceed the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU).
The boundaries of the adaptation may be controlled by a set of parameters.
These parameters may be configured into the MTSI client based on operator
policy, for example using OMA-DM.
Table 10.1 defines a mandatory set of parameters that are used by the ECN
triggered adaptation for AMR and AMR-WB. The default values for the parameters
are also specified. Alternate values for these parameters may be configured
into the MTSI client based on operator policy, for example using OMA-DM.
Table 10.1: Configuration parameters when ECN is used as a trigger
+-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | **Parameter** | **Description** | +=======================+=============================================+ | ECN_min_rate | Lower boundary for the media bit-rate | | | adaptation in response to ECN-CE marking. | | | The media bit-rate shall not be reduced | | | below this value as a reaction to the | | | received ECN-CE. | | | | | | The ECN_min_rate should be selected to | | | maintain an acceptable service quality | | | while reducing the resource utilization. | | | | | | Default value: For AMR and AMR-WB, the | | | default value shall be the rate of the | | | recommended Initial Codec Mode, see Clause | | | 7.5.2.1.6. | +-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+ | ECN_congestion_wait | **The waiting time after an ECN-CE marking | | | for which an up-switch shall not be | | | attempted.** | | | | | | **A negative value indicates an infinite | | | waiting time, i.e. to prevent up-switch for | | | the whole remaining session.** | | | | | | **Default value: 5 seconds** | +-----------------------+---------------------------------------------+
The configuration of adaptation parameters, and the actions taken during the
adaptation, are specific to the particular triggers. For example, the
adaptation may be configured to reduce the media bit-rate to AMR5.9 when ECN-
CE is detected, while it may reduce the media bit-rate to AMR4.75 for bad
radio conditions when high PLR is detected.
Multiple ECN-CE markings within one RTP-level round-trip time is considered as
the same congestion event. Each time an MTSI client detects a congestion event
it shall send an adaptation request to reduce the media bit-rate unless
already operating at the ECN_min_rate or below. An MTSI client detecting a
congestion event shall not send an adaptation request to increase the media
bit-rate for a time period ECN_congestion_wait after the end of the congestion
event.
Multiple adaptation trigger algorithms can be used in parallel, for example
ECN-triggered adaptation, adaptation based on ANBR, and PLR-triggered
adaptation. When multiple adaptation algorithms are used for the rate
adaptation, the rate that the MTSI client is allowed to use should be no
higher than any of the rates determined by each adaptation algorithm.
NOTE: For example, if the ECN-triggered adaptation indicates that AMR5.9
should be used and if the PLR-triggered adaptation indicates that AMR4.75
should be used then the rate that the MTSI client uses should be no higher
than min(AMR5.9, AMR4.75) = AMR4.75.An example adaptation scheme is described
in Annex C.
When additional transport bandwidth information is provided using the 'a=bw-
info' attribute defined in clause 19, the Minimum Desired Bandwidth should be
aligned with the ECN_min_rate configuration parameter.
### 10.2.1 RTCP-APP with codec control requests
#### 10.2.1.1 General
When signalling adaptation requests for speech in MTSI, an RTCP-APP packet
should be used. This application-specific packet format supports three
different adaptation requests when the AMR or AMR-WB codec is used; bit-rate
requests, frame aggregation requests and redundancy requests. The requests for
frame aggregation and redundancy are also used when the EVS codec is used. The
codec mode request used for AMR-WB is also used when the EVS AMR-WB IO mode is
used. The application specific format supports additionally five requests that
are used for the EVS codec. The RTCP-APP packet is put in a compound RTCP
packets according to the rules outlined in RFC 3550 [9] and RFC 4585 [40]. In
order to keep the size of the RTCP packets as small as possible it is strongly
recommended that the RTCP packets are transmitted as minimal compound RTCP
packets, meaning that they contain only the items:
\- SR or RR;
\- SDES CNAME item;
\- APP (when applicable).
The recommended RTCP mode is RTCP-AVPF early mode since it will enable
transmission of RTCP reports when needed and still comply with RTCP bandwidth
rules. The RTCP-APP packets should not be transmitted in each RTCP packet, but
rather as a result in the transport characteristics which require end-point
adaptation.
The signalling allows for a request that the other endpoint modifies the
packet stream to better fit the characteristics of the current transport link.
The request in the received RTCP-APP is valid until a new request is received.
Note that the media sender can, if having good reasons, choose to not comply
with the request received from the media receiver. One such reason could be
knowledge of that the local conditions do not allow the requested format.
#### 10.2.1.2 General Format of RTCP-APP packet with codec control requests
The RTCP-APP packet defined to be used for adaptation signalling for speech in
MTSI is constructed as shown in figure 10.1.
Figure 10.1: RTCP-APP formatting
The RTCP-APP specific fields are defined as follows:
\- Subtype - the subtype value shall be set to \"0\".
\- Name - the name shall be set to \"3GM7\", meaning 3GPP MTSI Release 7.
The application-dependent data field contains the requests listed below. The
length of the application-dependent data shall be a multiple of 32 bits. The
unused bytes shall be set to zero.
Figure 10.2: Basic syntax of the application-dependent data fields
The length of the messages is 1 or 2 bytes depending on request type.
The ID field identifies the request type. ID Code points [0000] ... [1000] are
specified in the present document, whereas the other ID code points are
reserved for future use.
The signalling for three different adaptation requests is defined below. For
each request, the codecs that can use the request are also specified.
The requests that can be used in a session are negotiated with SDP, see clause
10.2.3.
#### 10.2.1.2a Padding
**PADDING** : This message contains no request but is identical to a padding
byte with all zeroes and is therefore used as padding.
Figure 10.2a: Padding
Codecs: This request can be used for all codecs.
The DATA field is a 4-bit value field with all bits set to zero. When
receiving a PADDING message, the whole octet shall be ignored, regardless of
the bits in the DATA field.
An MTSI client uses this to pad the RTCP-APP to be 32 bit aligned when needed.
#### 10.2.1.3 Redundancy Request
**RTCP_APP_REQ_RED** : Request for redundancy level and offset of redundant
data.
Figure 10.3: Redundancy request
Codecs: This request can be used for all codecs.
The Bit field is a 12 bit bitmask that signals a request on how non-redundant
payloads chunks are to be repeated in subsequent packets.
The position of the bit set indicates which earlier non-redundant payload
chunks is requested to be added as redundant payload chunks to the current
packet.
\- If the LSB (rightmost bit) is set equal to 1 it indicates that the last
previous payload chunk is requested to be repeated as redundant payload in the
current packet.
\- If the MSB (leftmost bit) is set equal to 1 it indicates that the payload
chunk that was transmitted 12 packets ago is requested to be repeated as
redundant payload chunk in the current packet. Note that it is not guaranteed
that the sender has access to such old payload chunks.
The maximum amount of redundancy is 300 %, i.e., at maximum three bits can be
set in the Bit field.
See clause 10.2.1 for example use cases.
#### 10.2.1.4 Frame Aggregation Request
**RTCP_APP_REQ_AGG** : Request for a change of frame aggregation.
Figure 10.4: Frame aggregation request
Codecs: This request can be used for all codecs.
The DATA field is a 4 bit value field:
\- 0000 - 1 frame / packet.
\- 0001 - 2 frames / packet.
\- 0010 - 3 frames / packet.
\- 0011 - 4 frames / packet.
The values 0100...1111 are reserved for future use.
The maximum allowed frame aggregation is also limited by the maxptime
parameter in the session SDP since the sender is not allowed to send more
frames in an RTP packet than what the maxptime parameter defines.
The default aggregation is governed by the ptime parameter in the session SDP.
It is allowed to send fewer frames in an RTP packet, for example if there are
no more frames available at the end of a talk spurt. It is also allowed to
send more frames in an RTP packet, but such behaviour is not recommended.
See clauses 7.4.2 and 12.3.2.1 for further information.
#### 10.2.1.5 Codec Mode Request
**RTCP_APP_CMR** : Codec Mode Request
Figure 10.5: Codec mode request
Codecs: This request can only be used for the AMR codec, the AMR-WB codecs and
for the EVS codec when operating in AMR-WB IO mode.
The definition of the CMR bits in the RTCP_APP_CMR message is identical to the
definition of the CMR bits defined in [28]. The CMR indicates the maximum
codec mode (highest bit-rate) that the receiver wants to receive. The sender
may very well use a lower codec mode (lower bit-rate) when sending.
An MTSI client in terminal that requests mode adaptation should transmit the
CMR in an RTCP_APP_CMR, unless specified otherwise in Clause 7.3.2.
When the MTSI MGW has an interworking session with a circuit-switched (CS)
system using transcoding and requests mode adaptation, the MTSI MGW should
transmit CMR in an RTCP_APP_CMR, unless specified otherwise in Clause 7.3.2,
and should set the CMR in the AMR payload to 15 (no mode request present
[28]).
When the MTSI MGW has an interworking session with a circuit-switched (CS)
system using TFO/TrFO, then the MTSI media gateway should translate the CMR
bits (in GERAN case) or the Iu/Nb rate control messages (in UTRAN case) from
the CS client into the CMR bits in the AMR payload. If the MTSI media gateway
prefers to receive a lower codec mode rate from the MTSI client in terminal
than what the CMR from the CS side indicates, then the MTSI media gateway may
replace the CMR from the CS side with the CMR that the MTSI media gateway
prefers. The value 15 (no mode request present [28]) shall be used in the CMR
bits in the AMR payload towards the PS side if on the CS side no mode request
has been received and if the MTSI media gateway has no preference on the used
codec mode. The RTCP_APP_CMR should not be used in the direction from the MTSI
media gateway towards the MTSI client when TFO/TrFO is used.
If an MTSI client receives CMR bits both in the AMR payload and in an
RTCP_APP_CMR message, the mode with the lowest bit rate of the two indicated
modes should be used. A codec mode request received in a RTCP_APP_CMR is valid
until the next received RTCP_APP_CMR.
#### 10.2.1.6 Generation of RTP payloads for multiple codec control requests
Figure 10.6 below illustrates how the three requests are used by the
transmitter. In this case, RTCP_APP_REQ_RED is equal to \"000000000101\".
\- The speech encoder generates frames every 20 ms.
\- The speech frames are buffered in the aggregation buffer until it is
possible to generate a payload chunk with the number of frames requested by
either ptime at session setup or by RTCP_APP_REQ_AGG during a session.
\- The current payload chunk is used when constructing the current RTP packet.
\- The history buffer contains previously transmitted payload chunks. The
length of this buffer needs to be dimensioned to store the maximum number of
payload chunks that are possible. This value is based on the max-red value,
the maxptime values and from the minimum number of frames that the transmitter
will encapsulate in the RTP packets. In this case, the buffer length is
selected to 11 payload chunks since this corresponds to the worst case of max-
red=220, maxptime=240 and one frame per payload chunk.
\- After transmitting the current RTP packet, the content of the history
buffer is shifted, the current payload chunk is shifted in to the history
buffer as P(n-1) and the oldest payload chunk P(n-11) is shifted out.
\- When constructing the (provisional) RTP payload, the selected preceding
payload chunks are selected from the history buffer and added to the current
payload chunk. In order to form a valid RTP payload, the transmitter needs to
verify that the maxptime value is not exceeded. If the provisional RTP payload
is longer than what maxptime allows, then the oldest speech frames shall be
removed until the length (in time) of the payload no longer violates the
maxptime value. NO_DATA frames in the beginning or at the end of the payload
does not need to be transmitted and are therefore removed. The RTP Time Stamp
needs to be incremented when a NO_DATA frames are removed from the beginning
of the payload. A (provisional) RTP packet containing only NO_DATA frames does
not need to be transmitted.
Note also that the transmitter is not allowed to send frames that are older
than the max-red value that the transmitter has indicated in the SDP.
Figure 10.6: Visualization of how the different adaptation requests\ affect
the encoding and the payload packetization
It should be noted that RTCP_APP_REQ_AGG and RTCP_APP_REQ_RED are independent.
Furthermore, it should also be noted that different redundant payload chunks
may contain different number of speech frames.
#### 10.2.1.7 EVS Primary Rate Request
**RTCP_APP_REQ_EPRR** : EVS Primary Rate Request
Figure 10.6a: EVS primary rate request
Codecs: This request can be used for the EVS codecs when operating in EVS
Primary mode.
The DATA field a 4-bit field and is encoded as described in the table below.
The rate request indicates the maximum codec mode (highest bit-rate) that the
receiver wants to receive. The sender may use a lower codec mode (lower bit-
rate) when sending. The rate request shall comply with the media type
parameters that are negotiated in the session.
Table 10.1a Encoding of the DATA field in the EVS Primary Rate Request.

#### 10.2.1.8 EVS Bandwidth Request
**RTCP_APP_REQ_EBWR** : EVS Bandwidth Request
Figure 10.6b: EVS bandwidth request
Codecs: This request can be used for the EVS codecs when operating in Primary
mode.
The DATA field is a 4-bit field b0...b3, corresponding to bit 4 to bit 7 in
the octet:
\- b0 set to '1' = request for narrowband.
\- b1 set to '1' = request for wideband.
\- b2 set to '1' = request for super-wideband.
\- b3 set to '1' = request for fullband.
Each bit in the DATA field indicates a bandwidth that the receiver wants to
receive. One or several of these four bits can be set to '1'. For example, a
request for '1110' indicates that the receiver wants to receive narrowband,
wideband or super-wideband speech but not fullband speech. The bandwidth
request shall comply with the media type parameters that are negotiated in the
session.
#### 10.2.1.9 EVS Channel Aware Request
**RTCP_APP_REQ_EPRED** : EVS Channel Aware Request
Figure 10.6d: EVS partial redundancy request
Codecs: This request can be used for the EVS codecs when operating in Primary
mode.
The DATA field is a 4-bit field and is encoded as described in the table
below.
Table 1.b Encoding of the DATA field in the EVS Channel Aware Request.

1110 Not used 1111 Not used
Since channel-aware mode is only defined for the EVS Primary 13.2 kbps mode
then sending an EVS Channel Aware Request also implies changing to the EVS
Primary mode and to the 13.2 kbps bit-rate and possibly also changing the
audio bandwidth to either WB or SWB.
#### 10.2.1.10 EVS Primary mode to EVS AMR-WB IO mode Switching Request
**RTCP_APP_REQ_EP2I** : EVS Primary mode to EVS AMR-WB IO mode Switching
Request
Figure 10.6e: EVS primary mode to EVS AMR-WB IO mode switching request
Codecs: This request can be used for the EVS codecs when operating in Primary
mode.
The DATA field is an 11-bit field where the first 9 bits (b4-b12) are used to
indicate the AMR-WB codec modes that are allowed and the 2 last bits (b13 and
b14) are flags to set mode-change-period and mode-change-neighbor as follows:
\- first 9 bits for mode-set:
\- b4 = '0': AMR-WB 6.60 not allowed\ b4 = '1': AMR-WB 6.60 allowed,
\- b5 = '0': AMR-WB 8.85 not allowed\ b5 = '1': AMR-WB 8.85 allowed,
\- b6 = '0': AMR-WB 12.65 not allowed\ b6 = '1': AMR-WB 12.65 allowed,
\- b7 = '0': AMR-WB 14.25 not allowed\ b7 = '1': AMR-WB 14.25 allowed,
\- b8 = '0': AMR-WB 15.85 not allowed\ b8 = '1': AMR-WB 15.85 allowed,
\- b9 = '0': AMR-WB 18.25 not allowed\ b9 = '1': AMR-WB 18.25 allowed,

An MTSI client sending this request shall set at least one of the mode-set
bits to '1'. An MTSI client receiving a request with all zeroes shall ignore
the request.
The mode-set indicated in the EVS Primary mode to EVS AMR-WB IO mode Switching
Request can only allow codec modes that have been negotiated in SDP offer-
answer. This request cannot be used to allow codec modes that have not been
negotiated in SDP offer-answer.
An MTSI client sending this request should also send an RTCP_APP_CMR to
indicate the codec mode that should be used after switching to EVS AMR-WB IO
mode. An MTSI client receiving this request without a request for a codec mode
should use the rules for Initial Codec Mode (ICM) defined in clause 7.5.2.1.6
to determine the codec mode that should be used after switching to EVS AMR-WB
IO mode.
The last bit (b15) 'R' is reserved for future use. An MTSI client sending this
request shall set it to '0'. An MTSI client receiving this request shall
ignore this bit.

### 10.2.2 Example use cases
The following examples demonstrate how requests for redundancy and frame
aggregation are realised in the RTP stream.
All examples assume that the speech codec generates frames numbered N-10...N
in a continuous flow.

corresponds to a time difference of 20 ms
In the examples below, P-1...P denote the sequence numbers of the packets.
EXAMPLE 1:
An RTCP_APP_REQ_RED request with bit field 000000000000 (no redundancy) and
RTCP_APP_REQ_AGG request with value = 0 (no frame aggregation) will yield
packets as shown in figure 10.8.

### 10.2.3 SDP negotiation for RTCP-APP
RTCP-APP request messages that can be used are negotiated with SDP using the
'3gpp_mtsi_app_adapt' attribute. The syntax for the 3GPP MTSI RTCP-APP
adaptation attribute is:
> a=3gpp_mtsi_app_adapt:\
where:
> \ is a comma-separated list identifying the different request
> messages (see below).
The ABNF for the RTCP-APP adaptation messages negotiation attribute is the
following:
> adaptation attribute = "a" "=" "3gpp_mtsi_app_adapt" ":" reqName *(","
> reqName)
>
> reqName = \"RedReq\" / \"FrameAggReq\" / \"AmrCmr\" / \"EvsRateReq\" /
> \"EvsBandwidthReq\" / \"EvsParRedReq\" / \"EvsIoModeReq\" /
> \"EvsPrimaryModeReq\"
The name denotes the RTCP APP packet types the SDP sender supportes to
receive. The meaning of the values is as follows:
> RedReq: Redundancy Request, sublause 10.2.1.3
>
> FrameAggReq: Frame Aggregation Request, subclause 10.2.1.4
>
> AmrCmr: Codec Mode Request for AMR and AMR-WB, subclause 10.2.1.5
>
> EvsRateReq: EVS Primary Rate Request, subclause 10.2.1.7
>
> EvsBandwidthReq: EVS Bandwidth Request, subclause 10.2.1.8
>
> EvsParRedReq: EVS Partial Redundancy Request, subclause 10.2.1.9
>
> EvsIoModeReq: EVS Primary mode to EVS AMR-WB IO mode Switching Request,
> subclause 10.2.1.10
>
> EvsPrimaryModeReq: EVS AMR-WB IO mode to EVS Primary mode Switching Request,
> subclause 10.2.1.11
An MTSI client supporting the reception of any RTCP APP packets defined in the
present specification shall indicate the supported RTCP APP packet types in an
initial SDP offer or answer it sends using the SDP \"a=3gpp_mtsi_app_adapt\"
attribute. If the answerer receives an \"a=3gpp_mtsi_app_adapt\" attribute in
the SDP offer, it may send the indicated RTCP APP packet types towards the
offerer. The answerer shall indicate its capabilties with the
\"a=3gpp_mtsi_app_adapt\" attribute irrespective if an
\"a=3gpp_mtsi_app_adapt\" attribute was received and the capabilities within.
If the offerer receives an \"a=3gpp_mtsi_app_adapt\" attribute in the SDP
answer, it may send the indicated RTCP APP packet types towards the answerer.
An MTSI client supporting only AMR and AMR-WB therefore may for instance
include the following in the SDP offer:
> a=3gpp_mtsi_app_adapt: RedReq,FrameAggReq,AmrCmr
An MTSI client supporting only AMR, AMR-WB and EVS may for instance include
the following in the SDP offer:
> a=3gpp_mtsi_app_adapt:
> RedReq,FrameAggReq,AmrCmr,EvsRateReq,EvsBandwidthReq,EvsParRedReq,EvsIoModeReq,EvsPrimaryModeReq
The attribute shall only be used on media level.
When interworking with pre-Rel-12 clients or non-MTSI clients, it may happen
that they support the RTCP-APP signalling but not the SDP negotiation for AMR
and AMR-WB. An MTSI client failing to negotiate RTCP-APP as described may
still try to use the RTCP-APP signalling when requesting adaptation, but the
MTSI client shall then also monitor the received media in order to determine
if some or all of the adaptation requests included in the RTCP-APP were
partially or fully followed or not followed at all. If none of the adaptation
requests is followed, not even partially, then this is an indication that the
remote client does not support the RTCP-APP signalling. The MTSI client should
then try to use other means for triggering the adaptation, for example CMR in
the AMR/AMR-WB payload or RTCP Sender Reports/Receiver Reports.
## 10.3 Video
### 10.3.1 General
MTSI clients receiving RTCP Receiver Reports (RR) indicating nonzero packet
loss shall support adjusting their outgoing bitrate accordingly (see RFC 3550
[9]). Note that for IMS networks, which normally have nonzero packet loss and
fairly long round-trip delay, the amount of bitrate reduction specified in RFC
3448 [56] is generally too restrictive for video and may, if used as
specified, result in very low video bitrates already at (for IMS) moderate
packet loss rates.
A video sender shall support adapting its video output rate based on RTCP
reports and TMMBR messages. This adaptation shall be used as described in
clauses 10.3.2 to 10.3.6 unless the video sender is explicitly notified that
no rate adaptation shall be performed, e.g.by setting the minimum quality
bitrate equal to the negotiated bitrate. **This adaptation should be performed
while maintaining a balance between spatial quality and temporal resolution,
which matches the bitrate and image size.** Some examples are given in Annex
B. For the handling of packet loss signaled through AVPF NACK and PLI, or for
rate adaptation with RTCP reports and TMMBR messages, the video sender shall
be able to dynamically adapt to the reported conditions, in particular to
facilitate the operation of quality-recovery techniques pertinent to the
situations. Quality-recovery techniques include, but may not be limited to,
adapted intra frame periods, adaptation of random intra macroblock refresh
ratios, FEC, and adaptation of the bit rates.
The rate adaptation can be controlled by using the video adaptation parameters
defined in clause 17.2. By using the MIN_QUALITY/BIT_RATE/ABSOLUTE or the
MIN_QUALITY/BIT_RATE/RELATIVE parameters it is possible to set the minimum
bitrate for the adaptation.
### 10.3.2 Signaling mechanisms
The use of TMMBR and TMMBN depends on the outcome of the SDP offer/answer
negotiation, see Clause 6.2.3.2.
If TMMBR and TMMBN are allowed to be used in the session and if the receiving
MTSI client in terminal is made aware of a reduction in downlink bandwidth
allocation through an explicit indication of the available bandwidth
allocation from the network (e.g. due to QoS renegotiation or handoff to
another radio access technology), or from measurements such as increased delay
at the media receiver, it shall notify the media sender of the new current
maximum bitrate using TMMBR. In this context the TMMBR message is used to
quickly signal to the other party a reduction in available transport bitrate.
If rate adaptation is allowed, the media sending MTSI client shall, after
receiving TMMBR, adjust the sent media rate to the requested rate or lower and
shall respond by sending TMMBN, as described in CCM [43]. When determining the
encoder bitrate the MTSI client needs to compensate for the IP/UDP/RTP
overhead since the bitrate indicated in the TMMBR message includes this
overhead. To determine TMMBR and TMMBN content, both media sending and media
receiving MTSI clients in terminals shall use their best estimates of packet
measured overhead size when measured overhead values are not available. If the
TMMBR message was sent due to an explicit indication of available bandwidth
allocation, the MTSI client in terminal that sent the TMMBR message shall,
after receiving the TMMBN, send a SIP UPDATE to the other party to establish
the new rate as specified in clause 6.2.7.
It is the media sender's responsibility to estimate if, and by how much, queue
build-up has occurred due to use of a sending rate that was higher than the
available throughput, before being able to reduce the sending rate. It is
therefore also the media sender's responsibility to recover the buffering
delay by sending with a rate that is lower than what the media receiver has
requested in the TMMBR message for some period of time.
If TMMBR and TMMBN are not allowed to be used in the session and if the MTSI
client in terminal is made aware of a reduction in downlink bandwidth
allocation (e.g. due to QoS renegotiation or handoff to another radio access
technology) it shall send a SIP UPDATE to the other party to establish the new
rate as specified in clause 6.2.7.
If the receiving MTSI client in terminal is made aware of an increase in
downlink bandwidth allocation (determined via separate negotiation) through an
explicit indication from the network (e.g. due to QoS renegotiation or handoff
to another radio access technology) then, if this has not yet occurred, it
shall send a SIP UPDATE to the other party to establish the new rate as
specified in clause 6.2.7.
When an MTSI client in terminal receives available bandwidth information from
ANBR (see 10.7), it shall not be considered an explicit indication of
available bandwidth allocation that requires sending SIP UPDATE as described
above. The conditions under which it is allowed to send SIP UPDATE based on
ANBR are described in clause 6.2.5.1.
The media sender information in the RTCP Sender Reports (RTCP SR) contains
information about how many packets and how much data the media sender has
sent. A media receiving MTSI client in terminal may use this information to
detect the difference between the sent bitrate (from the remote media sending
client) and the received bitrate (in the local media receiving client).
The report blocks in the RTCP Receiver Reports (RTCP RR) or in the RTCP Sender
Reports (RTCP SR), contain information about the highest received sequence
number, the packet loss rate, the cumulative number of packet losses and
interarrival jitter as experienced by the media receiver. A media sending MTSI
client in terminal may use this information to detect the difference between
the sent bitrate (from the local media sending client) and the received
bitrate (in the remote media receiving client) and also to estimate the queue
build-up that can happen when congestion occurs somewhere in the path.
To enable proper video rate adaptation, RTCP Reports must be sent frequently
enough (e.g. at least twice per second) to allow MTSI clients to detect
network congestion. An MTSI client in terminal shall set the RR and RS
bandwidth modifiers in the SDP offer/answer to reserve an RTCP bandwidth that
is no smaller than the bandwidth reserved by setting the RTCP bandwidth
modifiers as follows (see Annex A.6):
\- 0 bps for the RS field (at media level);
\- 5000 bps for the RR field (at media level).
NOTE: In a point-to-point session the MTSI clients in terminals will be
reserved, on average, 2500 bps of RTCP bandwidth in each direction when the
RTCP bandwidth modifiers are negotiated as described above.
Furthermore, unless there is a clear need to set the RTCP bandwidth higher
than specified above, the RTCP bandwidth modifiers in the SDP offer should be
set as specified above.
NOTE: RFC 3550 recommends that the RTCP bandwidth default be 5% of the media
bandwidth. However, this default may be excessive in various scenarios,
including 3GPP access networks, and should therefore be carefully evaluated
when setting the RR and RS values differently than recommended in this clause.
Another way to estimate the transmitted bitrate is to analyse the size of the
packets and the RTP time stamps.
### 10.3.3 Adaptation triggers
An MTSI client in terminal sending or receiving media needs to know the
currently allowed bitrate (). The currently allowed bitrate is the minimum of
the bitrate negotiated in SDP offer/answer and the bitrate allowed after the
latest preceeding adaptation (e.g. last previous TMMBR message) that increased
or decreased the allowed bitrate for the encoder. When no bitrate reduction
trigger is received, the value from SDP offer/answer shall be used. The
currently allowed bitrate may therefore vary over time.
An MTSI client in terminal sending media shall use at least one adaptation
trigger that is based on the reception report blocks in the received RTCP
Receiver Reports or in the RTCP Sender Reports. An MTSI client in terminal
sending media may also use additional triggers such as ANBR.
NOTE: When interworking with non-MTSI clients then it may happen that the
remote client only sends RTCP Receiver Reports (or Sender Reports) but does
not use any adaptation triggers in its receiver. This may happen even if the
remote client supports and uses TMMBR because it is possible that the remote
client uses TMMBR only to signal bitrate changes due to handoff to another
access and not for dynamic rate adaptation.
An MTSI client in terminal receiving media shall use at least one adaptation
trigger that is not ECN. Examples of adaptation triggers are: ANBR,
measurements of packet loss rate; measurements of jitter; difference between
sending bitrate (e.g. from RTCP SR) and measured received bitrate; differences
between sending packet rate (from RTCP SR) and received packet rate; and play-
out delay margin (from packet arrival time until their scheduled play-out
time).
An MTSI client in terminal sending or receiving media:
\- Should use one or more triggers that is capable to detect a needed
reduction in throughput of 10% or more. If a trigger requires reception of an
RTCP Sender or Receiver Report, the change should be detected within 3 frame
durations of reception of the Sender or Receiver Report. If all triggers do
not require Sender or Receiver Report reception, the change should be detected
within 8 frame durations of the reduction in throughput.
\- Shall use one or more triggers that is capable to detect a needed reduction
in throughput of 25% or more. If a trigger requires reception of an RTCP
Sender or Receiver Report, the change shall be detected within 6 frame
durations of reception of the Sender or Receiver Report. If all triggers do
not require Sender or Receiver Report reception, the change shall be detected
within 15 frame durations of the reduction in throughput.
An MTSI client in terminal receiving media shall use at least one method to
estimate if and by how much the bitrate can be increased (). A method for how
an MTSI client in terminal can estimate when and by how much the bitrate can
be increased is described in Annex C.2.5.
### 10.3.4 Sender behavior, downswitching
#### 10.3.4.1 Downswitching divided into phases
The downswitching of the encoder bitrate in response to received adaptation
requests or performance metrics is divided into two phases:
• - First a rate reduction phase, where the bitrate is reduced from the target
bitrate currently used by the sender, which is too high for the current
operating conditions, to the bitrate that is suitable for the current
operating conditions.
• - Then a delay recovery phase, where the delay of any buffered data is
recovered.
These phases are described in more detail below.
Annex C.2 gives a further description of the downswitching procedure.
#### 10.3.4.2 Rate reduction phase
An MTSI client in terminal sending media should be able to immediately change
the sending bitrate to the bitrate requested in a received TMMBR message.
Due to differences in client implementations (video encoder, cameras, etc), a
sending MTSI client in terminal may or may not be able to immediately change
the sending bitrate to the bitrate requested in a TMMBR message. The
capability to immediately change the bitrate may also depend on whether the
bitrate adaptation requires changing the frame rate and/or the video
resolution.
When a reduction of the bitrate is requested with TMMBR and the MTSI client in
terminal cannot immediately adapt to the requested bitrate then this will
introduce excessive bits () since the sending bitrate will be higher than the
available bitrate. These excessive bits will cause buffering, packet delays
and sometimes packet losses. In this case, the MTSI client in terminal shall
calculate the amount of excessive bits that are created until the bitrate has
been reduced to the requested bitrate. In this case, the sending MTSI client
in terminal:
• - should adapt the encoding bitrate such that:
(10.3.4.2-1)
• - shall adapt the encoding bitrate such that:
(10.3.4.2-2)
where:
(10.3.4.2-3)
and: is the adaptation time required by the Worst-Case Adaptation Algorithm,
see Annex C.2.4, in this case 1 second;
is the bit-rate used before the adaptation starts;
is the bit-rate requested in the TMMBR message.
The is calculated over the , which is from the time when the TMMBR message is
received until encoder has adapted down to the , see also Annex C.2.4. The
bitrate used by the encoder is expected to vary from frame to frame. The
bitrate should therefore be averaged using a sliding window over at least the
last 5 frame durations before comparing it to the .
An MTSI client in terminal reducing the bitrate:
\- should have adapted down to after the TMMBR message was received,
\- shall have adapted down to after the TMMBR message was received.
The above procedure applies only when a bitrate reduction is requested with a
TMMBR message. When the bitrate is increased, after the congestion has been
cleared, then the above procedure does not apply.
Annex C.2.4 gives a further description of the above requirements and
recommendations and how the encoder should behave during the rate reducing
phase.
#### 10.3.4.3 Delay recovery phase
After adapting down to the requested bit-rate the sending MTSI client in
terminal shall use a delay recovery phase where the bit-rate is (on average)
lower than the requested bit-rate until the buffering delay caused by the
excessive bits () described in clause 10.3.4.2 have been recovered, see also
Annex C.2.4 and C.2.6.
### 10.3.5 Sender behavior, up-switching
An MTSI client in terminal sending media with a bitrate lower than currently
allowed bitrate should try to increase the bitrate up to the currently allowed
bitrate. The bitrate of the encoded media is increased slowly until the
currently allowed bitrate is reached while monitoring that the quality is
maintained, i.e. no packet losses and no delay should be introduced because of
the up-switch.
An MTSI client in terminal sending media with a bitrate according to the
currently allowed bitrate and receiving a TMMBR request for increasing the
bitrate:
\- should ramp up the bitrate to the currently allowed bitrate within 0.5
seconds,
\- shall ramp up the bitrate to the currently allowed bitrate within 1 second.
If during the up-switch procedure the MTSI client receives a TMMBR message for
reducing the bitrate then the up-switch shall be aborted and the down-switch
is started as described in clause 10.3.4.
### 10.3.6 Receiver behavior, down-switching
An MTSI client in terminal receiving media and detecting that the throughput
is reduced shall behave as follows:
\- When detecting that the throughput is reduced by more than 10% then it
should send a TMMBR message requesting a bitrate that is at least 10% lower
than the currently allowed bitrate,
\- When detecting that the throughput is reduced by more than 25% then it
shall send a TMMBR message requesting a bitrate that is at least 25% lower
than the currently allowed bitrate.
TMMBR messages for down-switch are urgent feedback messages and shall be sent
as soon as possibly. AVPF early mode or immediate mode, [40] shall be used
whenever possible.
### 10.3.7 Receiver behavior, up-switch
An MTSI client in terminal receiving media and detecting that the bitrate can
be increase shall behave as follows:
\- If the bitrate can be increased by at least 5% then the MTSI client in
terminal should send a TMMBR message requesting a bitrate that is:
(10.3.7-1)
\- If the bitrate can be increased by at least 15% then the MTSI client in
terminal shall send a TMMBR message requesting a bitrate that is:
(10.3.7-2)
TMMBR messages for up-switch shall be sent with the normal compound RTCP
packets following the normal RTCP transmission rules defined for the RTP/AVP
profile, [9]. This is to not unnecessarily prevent possible subsequent urgent
feedback messages, e.g. for down-switch, to be sent using AVPF early mode or
immediate mode.
### 10.3.8 ECN triggered adaptation
ECN triggered adaptation may be used in addition to other adaptation triggers.
However, when ECN is used an MTSI client in terminal receiving media shall
also use at least one other adaptation trigger, see clause 10.3.3. When ECN is
used, an MTSI client in terminal sending media shall also monitor the received
RTCP SR/RR. If ANBR described in clause 10.7 is used, the bitrate value used
in that bitrate recommendation shall be seen as independent from ECN and thus
not taking ECN-CE markings into account. It is therefore possible that ECN-CE
and ANBR with a decreased bitrate value both report on the same detected
restriction.
NOTE: When ECN is negotiated, some networks in the path may allow ECN
signalling to pass through even though the network does not actively use ECN
to indicate congestion. For example, in a session between an LTE UE and a HSPA
UE, the LTE access may allow and use ECN, but the backbone and the HSPA access
may allow ECN to be used without marking packets with ECN-CE if congestion
occurs in the backbone or in the HSPA access side.
Table 10.2 defines a mandatory set of parameters that are used by the ECN
triggered adaptation. The default values for the parameters are also
specified. Alternate values for these parameters may be configured into the
MTSI client based on operator policy, for example using OMA-DM.
Table 10.2: Configuration parameters when ECN is used as a trigger
+--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | **Parameter** | **Description** | +==========================+==========================================+ | ECN_min_rate_relative | Lower boundary (proportion of the bit | | | rate negotiated for the video stream) | | | for the media bit-rate adaptation in | | | response to ECN-CE marking. The media | | | bit-rate shall not be reduced below this | | | value as a reaction to the received | | | ECN-CE. | | | | | | The ECN_min_rate should be selected to | | | maintain an acceptable service quality | | | while reducing the resource utilization. | | | | | | Default value: Same as | | | INITIAL_CODEC_RATE for video if | | | defined, otherwise 50% | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | ECN_min_rate_absolute | Lower boundary (kbps) for the media | | | bit-rate adaptation in response to | | | ECN-CE marking. The media bit-rate shall | | | not be reduced below this value as a | | | reaction to the received ECN-CE. | | | | | | The ECN_min_rate should be selected to | | | maintain an acceptable service quality | | | while reducing the resource utilization. | | | | | | Default value: 48 kbps | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | ECN_congestion_wait | **The waiting time after an ECN-CE | | | marking for which an up-switch shall not | | | be attempted.** | | | | | | **A negative value indicates an infinite | | | waiting time, i.e. to prevent up-switch | | | for the whole remaining session.** | | | | | | **Default value: 5 seconds** | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+
The ECN_min_rate parameter is set to the larger of the ECN_min_rate_relative
and ECN_min_rate_absolute values. Since the ECN_min_rate_relative parameter is
relative to the outcome of the offer-answer negotiation this means that the
ECN_min_rate value may be different for different sessions. The
ECN_min_rate_absolute parameter is used to prevent too low bit rates for
video, which would result in too low quality.
The configuration of adaptation parameters, and the actions taken during the
adaptation, are specific to the particular triggers. For example, the
adaptation may be configured to reduce the media bit-rate to ECN_min_rate when
ECN-CE is detected, while it may reduce the media bit-rate even further for
bad radio conditions when high PLR is detected.
Multiple ECN-CE markings within one RTP-level round-trip time is considered as
the same congestion event. Each time an MTSI client detects a congestion event
it shall send an adaptation request to reduce the media bit-rate unless
already operating at the ECN_min_rate or below. An MTSI client detecting a
congestion event shall not send an adaptation request to increase the media
bit-rate for a time period ECN_congestion_wait after the end of the congestion
event.
Multiple adaptation algorithms can be used in parallel, for example ECN-
triggered adaptation, ANBR, and Packet Loss Rate-triggered adaptation. When
multiple adaptation trigger algorithms are used for the rate adaptation, the
rate that the MTSI client is allowed to use should be no higher than any of
the rates determined by each adaptation algorithm.
NOTE: For example, if the ECN-triggered adaptation indicates that 100kbps
should be used and if the PLR-triggered adaptation indicates that 75kbps
should be used then the rate that the MTSI client uses should be no higher
than min(100, 75) = 75kbps.
## 10.4 Text
Rate adaptation (downgrade of used bandwidth) of text shall follow the
recommendation in clause 9 of RFC 4103 [31]. RTCP reports are used as
indicator of loss rate over the channel.
When the transmission interval has been increased in order to handle a
congestion situation, return to normal interval shall be done when RTCP
reports low loss.
## 10.5 Explicit Congestion Notification
When the (e)NodeB experiences congestion it may set the ECN bits in the IP
header to '11' to indicate "Congestion Experienced" for packets that have been
marked with ECN Capable Transport (ECT), [83], [84].
Adaptation requests should be sent in response to ECN congestion events.
Clauses 10.2 and 10.3 describe adaptation for speech and video when ECN-CE is
detected.
## 10.6 Using the a=bw-info attribute for adaptation
This sub-clause outlines a few generic recommendations for how the bandwidth
properties signalled with the 'a=bw-info' may be used for the adaptation.
Media specific usage may override these guidelines.
During the session, when adaptation is needed:
\- The bit rate range from the Minimum Desired Bandwidth up to the Maximum
Desired Bandwidth (if different) defines the most commonly used adaptation
range. The primary means for the adaptation in this range is adapting the
source encoding while adapting the RTP packetization should remain unchanged.
This includes adapting the frame range for video.
\- When adapting in this range, downwards rate adaptation should be fast while
upwards rate adaptation should be relatively slow. This is because when these
bandwidth properties are different then it is likely that an MBR>GBR bearer is
used and the performance defined with the QoS parameters is only guaranteed
when the bit rate does not exceed the GBR [90].
\- The bit rate range above the Maximum Desired Bandwidth up to the Maximum
Supported Bandwidth (if different) is mainly intended for sending application
layer redundancy, in case additional bandwidth is needed for this purpose.
\- It is preferable to first try to overcome the degraded operating conditions
by reducing the bit rate, at least down to the Minimum Desired Bandwidth or
even down to the Minimum Supported Bandwidth, before adding application layer
redundancy.
\- The bit rate range below the Minimum Desired Bandwidth down to the Minimum
Supported Bandwidth (if different) is mainly intended to be used to keep the
session alive during severely degraded operating conditions. For video, this
can be achieved by e.g. reducing the resolution or the frame rate. For speech,
this can be achieved by using frame aggregation or using a codec mode below
the Minimum Desired Bandwidth. The end-to-end delay may be significantly
increased and/or the quality may be significantly reduced. It may still be
preferable to keep the media alive compared to e.g. video freezing, even if
the quality is degraded.
\- The Minimum Supported Bandwidth may be set larger than zero to limit the
adaptation, e.g. to fulfil certain service requirements on end-to-end delay or
minimum quality level. If the throughput is so low that not even the Minimum
Supported Bandwidth can be fulfilled then there is likely no reason to
continue using that media type in the session.
## 10.7 Access network bitrate recommendation
### 10.7.1 General
Support and use of access network bitrate recommendations (ANBR) as described
in this clause are optional for MTSI clients in terminal. Clause 10.7 does not
apply to an MTSI client in terminal that does not support the ANBR message.
Some access networks may provide the MTSI client in terminal with ANBR
messages, separately per local access bearer and separately for the local
uplink and downlink. It is expected that an ANBR message is sent to the MTSI
client in terminal whenever the access network finds it reasonable to inform
about a change in the recommended bitrate, such that the MTSI client in
terminal is generally provided with up-to-date recommended bitrate
information.
In general, a single access bearer can carry multiple RTP streams, in which
case ANBR applies to the sum of the individual RTP stream bitrates on that
bearer.
Access networks supporting ANBR may also support a corresponding ANBR Query
(ANBRQ) message, which allows the MTSI client in terminal to query the network
for updated ANBR information. ANBRQ shall only be used to query for an ANBR
update when media bitrate is to be increased, not for media bitrate decrease.
The ANBR and ANBRQ messages, as used in this clause, are _conceptual_ messages
that allows generalization of the description between different accesses, e.g.
LTE (see 10.7.4) and wireless LAN. There shall be a defined mapping between
the conceptual ANBR/ANBRQ and actual messages for each access where ANBR/ANBRQ
signaling is to be used. The format of such access-specific ANBR/ANBRQ
messages may differ between different types of access networks, and there may
not even exist a one-to-one mapping of messages. The recommended bitrate value
in ANBR/ANBRQ is here defined to include IP and higher layer overhead,
including bitrate used for RTCP signaling (as opposed to e.g. b=AS line in
SDP, which does not include RTCP). Other definitions can be used by the
individual access network mappings (for LTE, the recommended physical layer
bitrate is signalled by the access network, see clauses 10.7.4), e.g.,
including overhead below IP layer that is added by the access network, and the
UE shall then perform appropriate value translation, e.g. adjusting for use of
ROHC and removing the lower layer overhead.
While the sizes of all other protocol overheads are static or change slightly
during an MTSI session, the size of ROHC header is highly dynamic, and hence
there is no deterministic and standardized way to map the recommended physical
layer bitrate into the IP layer bitrate. The queried physical layer bitrate
should be set considering all the L2 and above headers.
NOTE 1: The UE may determine the corresponding IP layer bitrate based on the
long-term average of the IP packet sizes, L2 header sizes, and ROHC header
sizes, but the translation methodologies and the estimation error levels
required to implement accurate media bitrate adaptation have not been
specified.
NOTE 2: The eNodeB may determine the corresponding IP layer bitrate based on
the long-term average of the IP packet sizes, L2 header sizes, and ROHC header
sizes, but the translation methodologies and the estimation error levels
required to implement accurate media bitrate adaptation have not been
specified.
NOTE 3: The recommended/queried bitrate as signalled over the LTE access is
defined to be in kbps at the physical layer. The uplink/downlink bitrate at
the physical layer is , where is the bit-length of the _k_ -th successfully
transmitted/received TB by the UE within the window _T_. In 3GPP TS 36.321, a
window length of 2000 ms is applied.
### 10.7.2 Relation to session signaling bitrate information
ANBR is only a recommendation and does not change any bitrate restrictions
established by session signaling, described in clause 6.2.5.1. Such unaffected
session signaling bitrate information includes:
\- SDP \"b=\" lines, including \"b=AS\", \"b=RS\", and \"b=RR\".
\- SDP \"a=bw-info\" lines, if present.
\- Codec-specific min/max bitrates, based on codec configuration and/or
packetization parameters.
\- MBR and GBR QoS parameters.
An ANBR value with a bitrate above a maximum bitrate limit established by any
of the above shall therefore instead be considered as a bitrate recommendation
for the lowest of the above listed maximum bitrates (except for GBR that is
not considered a maximum bitrate). When using a codec configuration with
discrete bitrate steps, and if the ANBR value does not exactly match such
discrete codec bitrate, it shall be considered as a bitrate recommendation for
the next lower, signaled codec bitrate.
If a GBR bearer is used (GBR > 0), an ANBR value below GBR may be ignored, but
the MTSI client in terminal should then be prepared to handle a higher than
target packet loss and / or delay for the affected bearer. An ANBR value of 0
should be taken as a recommendation to temporarily stop sending RTP media on
the affected bearer, without re-negotiating the session, with the exception
for RTP media related to the first \"m=audio\" line in the SDP that shall
never temporarily stop sending based on ANBR value 0. Corresponding RTCP
transmission shall, when enabled, continue even when RTP media is stopped due
to ANBR value 0.
### 10.7.3 Use with dynamic bitrate adaptation
#### 10.7.3.1 General
An MTSI client in terminal shall use the ANBR message as adaptation trigger,
taking other available triggers into account. The same principle shall apply
for both speech and video, adapting to the lowest bitrate resulting from any
of the possibly multiple, available triggers. Clauses 10.2 and 10.3 describe
adaptation details for speech and video. Use of ANBR in combination with ECN
signaling is described in clause 10.3.8.
A received ANBR message for a certain access bearer and media direction shall
be considered valid for use as input to adaptation trigger evaluation until
either another ANBR message is received for the same access bearer and media
direction, until that access bearer is closed, or until the SIP session is
either re-negotiated or closed.
#### 10.7.3.2 Adaptation of sent media
This relates to adaptation of the media in RTP streams that the MTSI client in
terminal sends in the uplink direction, controlling the local media encoder
bitrate.
The below figures with signaling diagrams describe ANBR usage for a single
media, regardless if that is voice or video. The "Request max" message in
those figures is a generalized application level message that corresponds to
RTCP TMMBR for video and CMR or RTCP-APP for voice. Similarily, the "Notify
max" message is a generalized application level message that corresponds to
RTCP TMMBN for video. "Notify max" has no counterpart for voice and is
therefore not used for voice.
An MTSI client in terminal that rececives both ANBR with bitrate R0 and a
"Request max" message with bitrate R1 for its media sending direction shall
use min(R0, R1) as the combined bitrate for those two adaptation triggers.
Figure 10.7-1 Uplink bitrate decrease based on ANBR
Figure 10.7-2 Uplink bitrate increase based on ANBR
When an MTSI client in terminal receives an ANBR message for the local uplink
that triggers an adaptation decision (step 4 of Figures 10.7-1 and 10.7-2):
1\. For both video and voice, an adaptation resulting in a reduction of the
media sender bitrate shall be initiated immediately without further signaling
(step 6 of Figure 10.7-1).
2\. For the case of video and if TMMBR / TMMBN are supported in the session:
a) If the adaptation decision means that the MTSI client in terminal adapts
bitrate below the most recently received TMMBR message (if any, step 4 of
Figures 10.7-1 or 10.7-2), the media sender itself owns the uplink bitrate
restriction and a corresponding TMMBN message shall be sent, notifying the
remote media receiver of this changed local uplink restriction (step 7 of
Figure 10.7-1 or step 5 of Figure 10.7-2). Such TMMBN message has the media
sender's own SSRC included in the bounding set [43]. Note that only the media
sender or receiving TMMBR with a lower bitrate can then remove such own
restriction, which means that TMMBR messages with a higher bitrate received
from the remote media receiver will be ineffective and ignored. The media
sender can repeat this procedure and either increase or decrease the used
bitrate based on subsequent local uplink ANBR, sending corresponding TMMBN
also for those changes, as long as the MTSI client in terminal does not
receive a TMMBR from the remote MTSI client with a bitrate lower than the most
recently sent TMMBN.
b) An adaptation resulting in an increase of the media sender bitrate in
uplink (Figure 10.7-2) shall delay the media bitrate increase (step 6 of
Figure 10.7-2) to allow sufficient time for the remote media receiver to
receive and react to the TMMBN in bullet 2.a above, as described by section
3.5.4 of CCM [43] (steps 7-9 of Figure 10.7-2). After such delay, the media
sender bitrate is increased (step 12 of Figure 10.7-2). The bitrate increase
shall take all available adaptation triggers into account, which can cause the
bitrate increase to be separated into several steps (see clause C.2.5).
c) It is recommended that the bitrate in a TMMBN from bullet 2.b) that is pre-
announcing an increase in the media sender bitrate in uplink is set to
correspond to the received ANBR message and not to the next bitrate step in a
step-wise increase (see clause 10.3.5), to avoid unnecessary TMMBN, ANBRQ, and
ANBR signaling (see also bullet 4) below).
3\. For the case of voice, an adaptation resulting in an increase of the media
sender bitrate in uplink shall result in an increase of media sender bitrate
at the earliest opportunity (step 6 of Figure 10.7-2), taking other adaptation
triggers into account, such as CMR.
Figure 10.7-3 Downlink bitrate decrease based on ANBR through application
signaling
Figure 10.7-4 Downlink bitrate increase based on ANBR through application
signaling
When an MTSI client in terminal receives application signaling for bitrate
adaptation of media, such as CMR (for speech) or TMMBR (for video), that
triggers an adaptation decision (step 4 of Figure 10.7-3 or step 6 of Figure
10.7-4):
4\. For video and if TMMBR is supported in the session, when receiving a TMMBR
that would result in an increase of the media sender bitrate in uplink
direction (step 6 of Figure 10.7-4), the media sender shall take all available
adaptation triggers for the local uplink into account, e.g. any bitrate limit
from the most recently received ANBR message. If the media sender has reason
to believe that the most recently received ANBR for its uplink no longer
applies, it may send an ANBRQ message for its uplink (step 7 of Figure
10.7-4), if supported, to trigger receiving an ANBR message with recent
information (step 8 of Figure 10.7-4) before deciding on what bitrate value to
send in a TMMBN (step 10 of Figure 10.7-4) and to use for media in the uplink
direction (step 11 of Figure 10.7-4).
5\. For voice, when receiving a CMR that would result in an increase of the
media sender bitrate in uplink direction (step 6 of Figure 10.7-4), the media
sender shall take all available adaptation triggers for the local uplink into
account, e.g. any bitrate limit from the most recently received ANBR message.
If the media sender has reason to believe that the most recently received ANBR
for its uplink no longer applies, it may send an ANBRQ message for its uplink
(step 7 of Figure 10.7-4), if supported, to trigger receiving an ANBR message
with recent information (step 8 of Figure 10.7-4) before deciding on what
voice mode to use in the uplink direction (step 11 of Figure 10.7-4).
#### 10.7.3.3 Adaptation of received media
This relates to adaptation of the media in RTP streams that the MTSI client in
terminal receives in the downlink direction, which can require sending
application-level messages to adapt the remote media encoder bitrate.
When an MTSI client in terminal receives an ANBR message for the local
downlink that triggers an adaptation decision (step 2 of Figure 10.7-3 or step
4 of Figure 10.7-4):
1\. For the case of video and if TMMBR / TMMBN are supported in the session:
a) A corresponding TMMBR message requesting the remote media sender to change
its rate to match the local downlink restriction shall be sent, as described
in clause 10.3.2 (step 4 of Figure 10.7-3 or step 6 of Figure 10.7-4).
NOTE: Adaptation is not triggered if the most recently received TMMBN from the
remote media sender indicated a lower bitrate than would be included in a
TMMBR message, because the remote media sender is then owning the bitrate
limit itself (similar to bullet 2.a of the local uplink in clause 10.7.3.2
above).
b) It is recommended that the bitrate in a TMMBR from bullet 1.a) that is
increasing the media sender bitrate is set to correspond to the most recently
received ANBR message, to avoid unnecessary TMMBR, ANBRQ, and ANBR signaling
caused by a possible step-wise increase (see also bullet 2.c in 10.7.3.2
above).
2\. For the case of voice, adaptation signaling to match the local downlink
restriction shall be initiated towards the remote media sender, as described
in clause 10.2 (step 4 of Figure 10.7-3 or step 6 of Figure 10.7-4).
When an MTSI client in terminal receives application signaling for bitrate
adaptation related to received media, such as TMMBN (for video):
3\. A media receiver receiving a TMMBN with increased bitrate and where the
remote media sender owns the restriction (see bullet 2.a of 10.7.3.2 and step
5 of Figure 10.7-2) shall re-evaluate its downlink adaptation triggers and, if
an adaptation decision arrives at a lower bitrate value than in the received
TMMBN (step 5 of Figure 10.7-2), send a TMMBR with that lower bitrate, as
described by section 3.5.4 of CCM [43]. When deciding whether or not to send
TMMBR, the media receiver shall take all available adaptation triggers into
account, e.g. bitrate limit from the most recently received downlink ANBR
message. If the media receiver has reason to believe the most recently
received ANBR for its downlink no longer applies, it may send an ANBRQ message
for its downlink (step 7 of Figure 10.7-2), if supported, to trigger receiving
an ANBR message with recent information (step 8 of Figure 10.7-2).
### 10.7.4 Message mapping for LTE access
When using LTE access, ANBR is mapped to a MAC level message named
\"Recommended bit rate MAC Control Element\" sent by the eNodeB and applicable
to a specific dedicated bearer, as described by [85] and [157]. Similarly,
when using LTE access, ANBRQ is mapped to a MAC level message named
\"Recommended bit rate query MAC Control Element\" sent to the eNodeB and
applicable to a specific, existing dedicated bearer, as described by [85] and
[157]. An MTSI client in terminal using LTE access may support ANBR and ANBRQ
signaling.
# 11 Front-end handling
## 11.1 General
Terminals used for MTSI shall conform to the minimum performance requirements
on the acoustic characteristics of 3G terminals specified in 3GPP TS 26.131
[35]. The codec modes and source control rate operation (DTX) settings shall
be as specified in 3GPP TS 26.132 [36].
Furthermore, the test point (Point-of-Interconnect (POI)) specified in [35]
shall be a reference terminal capable of receiving digital speech data at the
send side and producing a digital output of the received signal (see figure
11.1). During the testing, the radio conditions should be error free and the
jitter and packet loss in the IP transport shall be kept to a minimum.
Figure 11.1: **Interface for testing acoustic properties of a terminal used
for MTSI**
# 12 Inter-working
## 12.1 General
In order to support inter-working between different networks it is good if
common codecs for the connection can be found. Requirements for different
networks are described in this clause. In some cases functionality is also
needed in the network to make the inter-working possible (e.g. MGCF and MGW).
NOTE: The term MTSI MGW (or MTSI Media gateway) is used in a broad sense, as
it is outside the scope of the current specification to make the distinction
whether certain functionality should be implemented in the MGW or in the MGCF.
## 12.2 3G-324M
### 12.2.1 General
Inter-working functions are required between IMS and CS. There are separate
functions, in e.g. a MGCF, for control-plane inter-working (see 3GPP TS 29.163
[65]) and, in e.g. a IM-MGW, for user-plane inter-working. Control-plane
inter-working includes for instance SIP BICC and SIP H.245 protocol
translations, whereas user-plane inter-working requires transport protocol
translations and possibly transcoding.
### 12.2.2 Codec usage
#### 12.2.2.1 General
An interoperable set of speech, video and real-time text codecs is specified
for 3G-324M and MTSI. Both video codec level and maximum bitrate can be
specified as part of the call setup negotiation (see clause 12.2.5). Thus, it
may be possible that the MTSI client in terminal and a CS UE agree on a common
codec end-to-end without the need for MGW transcoding.
If a common codec is not found and the MTSI MGW does not support transcoding
between any of the supported codecs, then the controlling MGCF may drop the
unsupported media component. If the speech part cannot be supported, then the
connection should not be set up.
#### 12.2.2.2 Text
A channel for real-time text is specified in ITU-T H.324. Presentation and
coding is specified according to ITU-T Recommendation T.140, which is also
used for MTSI clients (see clause 7.4.4). Inter-working is a matter of
establishing the text transport channels and moving the text contents between
the two transport levels.
### 12.2.3 Payload format
See clause 7.4 of the present document.
### 12.2.4 MTSI media gateway trans-packetization
#### 12.2.4.1 General
The MTSI MGW shall offer conversion between H.223 as used in 3G-324M on the CS
side and RTP as used in IMS. This clause contains a list inter-working
functionalities that should be included.
#### 12.2.4.2 Speech de-jitter buffer
The MTSI MGW should use a speech de-jitter buffer in the direction IMS to CS
with sufficient performance to meet the 10 milliseconds maximum jitter
requirement in clause 6.7.2 of ITU-T Recommendation H.324. H.324 specifies
that transmission of each speech AL-SDU at the H.223 multiplex shall commence
no later than 10 milliseconds after a whole multiple of the speech frame
interval, measured from transmission of the first speech frame.
#### 12.2.4.3 Video bitrate equalization
Temporary video rate variations can occur on the IMS side for example due to
congestion. The video rate on the CS side, in contrast, is under full control
of the CS side UE and the MGCF.
During session setup, the MGCF shall negotiate a video bitrate on the IMS side
that allows all video bits to be conveyed to/from the CS link.
A buffer shall be maintained at the IM-MGW in the direction from the IMS to
the CS side. The size of the buffer should be kept small enough to allow for a
low end-to-end delay, yet large enough to conceal most network jitter on the
IMS side. Temporary uneven traffic on the IMS side, beyond the handling
capability of the buffer, should be handled as follows: if the buffer
overflows, RTP packets should be dropped and the resulting loss and observed
jitter should be reported by the means of an RTCP RR at the earliest possible
sending time. The drop strategy may preferably be implemented media aware
(i.e. favouring dropping predicted information over non-predicted information
and similar techniques), or may be drop-head. If the buffer runs empty, the CS
side should insert appropriate flag stuffing.
A buffer shall be maintained in the direction from the CS to the IMS side. The
size of the buffer should be kept small enough to allow for a low end-to-end
delay, but large enough to conceal most network jitter on the CS side. If the
buffer overflows, then video bits must be dropped, preferably in a media-aware
fashion, i.e. at GOB/slice/picture boundaries. IM-MGWs may also take into
account the type of media data, i.e. coded with or without prediction. When
the buffer runs empty, no activity is required on the IMS side.
If the CS video call is changed to a speech-only call [46], the video
component on the IMS side shall be dropped.
#### 12.2.4.4 Data loss detection
If RTP packet loss is detected on input to the MTSI MGW at the IMS side,
including losses caused by buffer-full condition as described above,
corresponding H.223 AL-SDU sequence number increments should be made on the CS
side to enable loss detection and proper concealment in the receiving CS UE.
If packet loss is detected on the CS side, e.g. through H.223 AL-SDU sequence
numbers, those losses should be indicated towards the IMS side through
corresponding RTP packet sequence number increments. The deliberate increments
made for this reason will be visible in the RTCP RR from the MTSI client and
the MTSI MGW should take that into account when acting on RTCP RR from the
MTSI client, as the CS side losses are not related to the IMS network
conditions.
#### 12.2.4.5 Data integrity indication
This is mainly relevant in the direction from CS to IMS. The H.223 AL-SDUs
include a CRC that forms an unreliable indication of data corruption. On the
IMS side, no generic protocol mechanisms are available to convey this CRC
and/or the result of a CRC check. The MTSI MGW shall discard any AL-SDUs which
fail a CRC check and are not of a payload type that supports the indication of
possible bit errors in the RTP payload header or data. If such payload type is
in use, the MTSI MGW may forward corrupted packets, but in this case shall
indicate the possible corruption by the means available in the payload header
or data. One example is setting the Q bit of RFC 3267 [28] to 0 for AMR speech
data that was carried in an H.223 AL-SDU with CRC indicating errors. Another
example is setting the F bit of RFC 6184 [25] for H.264 (AVC) NAL units or the
F bit of [120] for H.265 (HEVC) NAL units that may contain bit errors.
The H.223 AL-SDU CRC is not fully fail-safe and it is therefore recommended
that a MTSI client is designed to be robust and make concealment of corrupt
media data, similar to the CS UE.
#### 12.2.4.6 Packet size considerations
##### 12.2.4.6.0 General
The same packet size and alignment requirements and considerations as defined
in clause 7.5.2 of the present document and in 3GPP TS 26.111 [45] apply to
the MTSI MGW and controlling MGCF, as it in that sense acts both as a MTSI
client towards the IMS and as a CS UE towards the CS side. Maximum available
buffer size for packetization of media data may differ between IMS and CS UE.
To avoid non-favourable segmentation of data (especially video) by the MTSI
MGW, the controlling MGCF should indicate the SDP 'a' attribute
"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize" to the MTSI client in terminal. This attribute indicates
the maximum SDU size of the application data (excluding RTP/UDP/IP headers)
that can be transmitted to the receiver without segmentation. The specific
maximum SDU size limit is determined by the MGCF from the H.245 bearer
capability exchange between the CS UE and the MGCF. For example, the MTSI MGW
determines this through the maximumAl2SDUSize and maximumAl3SDUSize fields of
the H223Capability member in H.245 TerminalCapabilitySet message.
##### 12.2.4.6.1 The Maximum Receive SDU Size attribute "3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize"
The ABNF for the maximum receive SDU size attribute is described as follows:
Max-receive-SDU-size-def = \"a\" \"=\" \"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize\" \":\" size-
value CRLF
size-value = 1*5DIGIT; 0 to 65535 in octets
> The value \"size-value\" indicates the maximum SDU size of application data,
> excluding RTP/UDP/IP headers, that can be transmitted to the other end point
> without segmentation.
The parameter \"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize\" should be included in the SDP at the
session level and/or at the media level. Its usage is governed by the
following rules:
1\. At the session level, the \"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize\" attribute shall apply to
the combination of the data from all the media streams in the session.
2\. At the media level, the \"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize\" attribute indicates to the
MTSI client in terminal that this particular media stream in the session has a
specific maximum SDU size limit beyond which received SDUs will be segmented
before delivery to the CS UE.
3\. If the \"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize\" attribute is included at the session and
media levels, then the particular media streams have specific maximum SDU size
limits for their own data while the session has an overall maximum SDU size
limit for all the media data in the session.
The MGCF includes the \"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize\" attribute in the SDP offer or
answer sent to the MTSI client in terminal after the MGCF determines the
bearer capability of the CS UE (see Annex E of [65]). Upon reception of the
SDP offer or answer that includes the \"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize\" attribute, the
MTSI client in terminal need not include this attribute in its subsequent
exchange of messages with the MTSI MGW.
There are no offer/answer implications on the \"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize\"
attribute. The \"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize\" attribute in the SDP from the MTSI MGW
is only an indication to the MTSI client in terminal of the maximum SDU size
that avoids segmentation for the specified media streams and/or session.
NOTE: Default operation in the absence of the \"3gpp_MaxRecvSDUSize\"
attribute in SDP is to not have any SDU size limits for any of the media
streams or session.
#### 12.2.4.7 Setting RTP timestamps
In general, no explicit timestamps exist at the CS side. Even without
transcoding functionality, the MTSI MGW may have to inspect and be able to
interpret media data to set correct RTP timestamps.
#### 12.2.4.8 Protocol termination
The MTSI MGW shall terminate the H.223 protocol at the CS side. Similarly, the
MTSI MGW shall terminate RTP and RTCP at the IMS side.
#### 12.2.4.9 Media synchronization
The IM-MGW and controlling MGCF should forward and translate the timing
information between the IMS side (RTP timestamps, RTCP sender reports) and the
CS side (H.245 message H223SkewIndication) to allow for media synchronization
in the MTSI client in terminal and the CS UE. The MTSI MGW shall account for
its own contribution to the skew in both directions. Note that transmission
timing of H223SkewIndication and RTCP SR must be decoupled. H223SkewIndication
has no timing restrictions, but is typically sent only once in the beginning
of the session. RTCP SR timing is strictly regulated in RFC 3550 [9], RFC
4585[40], and clause 7.3. To decouple send timings, the time shift information
conveyed in H223SkewIndication and RTCP SR must be kept as part of the MTSI
MGW/MGCF session state. H223SkewIndication should be sent at least once, and
may be sent again when RTCP SR indicates a synchronization change. A
synchronization change of less than 50 ms (value to be confirmed) should be
considered insignificant and need not be signalled.
NOTE: This procedure is not supported in the present Release in a decomposed
MGCF and IM-MGW, as H.245 is treated on the MGCF and RTCP is sent at the IM-
MGW, and no means are defined to forward information from the
H223SkewIndication over the Mn interface.
### 12.2.5 Session control
The MGCF shall offer translation between H.245 and SIP/SDP signalling
according to 3GPP TS 29.163 [65] to allow for end-to-end capability
negotiation.
## 12.3 GERAN/UTRAN CS inter-working
This clause defines requirements only for the PS side of the MGW, i.e. for the
PS session in-between the MTSI client in a terminal and the MGW. The CS side
of the MGW, i.e. in-between the MGW and the CS terminal, is out of scope of
this clause.
This clause applies for MTSI MGWs supporting inter-working between a CS
terminal using CS GERAN/UTRAN access or an MTSI client in terminal performing
SRVCC to CS and:
\- an MTSI client in terminal using 3GPP access; or:
\- an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access; or:
\- a non-MTSI client.
The requirements and recommendations for these three cases are harmonized to
enable using the same procedures regardless of the type of PS client and what
access it uses, as long as it uses IP based access.
The target for this clause is to enable tandem-free operation when the same
codec (AMR or AMR-WB) is used by both end-points.
An MTSI MGW may also support the other codecs listed in clause 18.2.2 for
inter-working between an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access and a CS
terminal using GERAN or UTRAN access. This means that tandem coding will be
used and then the PS side and the CS side operate independently of each other.
This further means that the requirements and recommendations for the PS side
of the MGW are the same as for an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access,
as described in clause 18, unless it is explicitly defined below.
### 12.3.0 3G-324M
If 3G-324M is supported in the GERAN/UTRAN CS, then the inter-working can be
made as specified in clause 12.2.
### 12.3.1 Codecs for MTSI media gateways
#### 12.3.1.1 Speech interworking between 3GPP PS access and CS GERAN/UTRAN
This clause applies to MTSI MGWs used for interworking between an MTSI client
in terminal using 3GPP access and a CS GERAN/UTRAN UE.
MTSI media gateways supporting speech communication between an MTSI client in
terminal using 3GPP access and terminals operating in the CS domain in GERAN
and UTRAN should support Tandem-Free Operation (TFO) for AMR or AMR-WB
according to 3GPP TS 28.062 [37], and Transcoder-Free Operation (TrFO), see
3GPP TS 23.153 [38].
MTSI media gateways supporting speech communication and supporting TFO and/or
TrFO shall support:
\- AMR speech codec modes 12.2, 7.4, 5.9 and 4.75 [11], [12], [13], [14] and
source-controlled rate operation [15].
MTSI media gateways should also support the other AMR codec types and
configurations as defined in Clause 5.4 in [16].
In the receiving direction, from the MTSI client in the terminal, the MTSI
media gateway shall be capable of restricting codec mode changes to be aligned
to every other frame border and shall be capable of restricting codec mode
changes to neighbouring codec modes within the negotiated codec mode set.
NOTE 1: This means that the MTSI client in a terminal will apply and accept
mode changes according to UMTS AMR2 [16]. An example of an SDP offer for how
the MTSI MGW can restrict AMR mode changes in the MTSI client in a terminal is
shown in Table A.2.1. An example of an SDP answer from the MTSI MGW for
restricting the mode changes in the MTSI client in a terminal is shown in
Table A.3.4a.
MTSI media gateways supporting wideband speech communication at 16 kHz
sampling frequency and supporting TFO and/or TrFO for wideband speech shall
support:
\- AMR wideband codec 12.65, 8.85 and 6.60 [17], ‎[18], ‎[19], [20] and source
controlled rate operation ‎[21].
MTSI media gateways supporting wideband speech communication at 16 kHz
sampling frequency should also support the other AMR-WB codec types and
configurations as defined in [16].
In the receiving direction, from the MTSI client in the terminal, the MTSI
media gateway shall be capable of restricting codec mode changes to be aligned
to every other frame border and shall be capable of restricting codec mode
changes to neighbouring codec modes within the negotiated codec mode set.
NOTE 2: This means that the MTSI client in a terminal will apply and accept
mode changes according to UMTS AMR-WB [16]. An example of an SDP offer for how
the MTSI MGW can restrict AMR and AMR-WB mode changes in the MTSI client in a
terminal is shown in Table A.2.4. An example of an SDP answer from the MTSI
MGW for restricting the mode changes in the MTSI client in a terminal is shown
in Table A.3.4.
MTSI MGWs supporting wideband speech communication shall also support
narrowband speech communications. When offering both wideband speech and
narrowband speech communication, wideband shall be listed as the first payload
type in the m line of the SDP offer (RFC 4566 [8]).
Requirements applicable to MTSI media gateways for DTMF events are described
in Annex G.
#### 12.3.1.1a Speech inter-working between fixed access and CS GERAN/UTRAN
This clause applies to MTSI MGWs used for interworking between an MTSI client
in terminal using fixed access and a CS GERAN/UTRAN UE.
Media codecs for MTSI MGWs for speech inter-working between fixed access and
CS GERAN/UTRAN are specified in TS 181 005 [98] in clause 6.2 for narrow-band
codecs and in clause 6.3 for wide-band codecs.
MTSI MGWs for speech inter-working between fixed access and CS GERAN/UTRAN
supporting AMR and AMR-WB shall follow clause 12.3.1.1 for the AMR and AMR-WB
codecs. Tandem-free inter-working should be used whenever possible.
For the other codecs, the MTSI MGW shall follow the recommendations and
requirements defined in clause 18 for the respective codec. For these codecs,
tandem-free inter-working is not possible when interworking with CS
GERAN/UTRAN.
Requirements applicable to MTSI media gateways for DTMF events are described
in Annex G.
#### 12.3.1.2 Text
The CTM coding format defined in 3GPP TS 26.226 [52] is used for real time
text in CS calls. In order to arrange inter‑working, a transcoding function
between CTM and RFC 4103 is required in the MTSI media gateway. A buffer shall
be used for rate adaptation between receiving text from a real-time text
transmitter according to the present document and transmitting to a CTM
receiver. A gateway buffer of 2K characters is considered sufficient according
to clause 13.2.4 in EG 202 320 [51].
### 12.3.2 RTP payload formats for MTSI media gateways
#### 12.3.2.1 Speech
For RTP payload formats, see clause 18.4.3.
MTSI media gateways supporting AMR or AMR-WB shall support the bandwidth-
efficient payload format and should support the octet-aligned payload format.
When offering both payload formats, the bandwidth-efficient payload format
shall be listed before the octet-aligned payload format in the preference
order defined in the SDP.
The MTSI media gateway should use the SDP parameters defined in table 12.1 for
the session.
For all access technologies and for normal operating conditions, the MTSI
media gateway should encapsulate the number of non-redundant speech frames in
the RTP packets that corresponds to the ptime value received in SDP from the
other MTSI client, or if no ptime value has been received then according to
\"Recommended encapsulation\" defined in table 12.1. The MTSI media gateway
may encapsulate more non-redundant speech frames in the RTP packet but shall
not encapsulate more than 4 non-redundant speech frames in the RTP packets.
The MTSI media gateway may encapsulate any number of redundant speech frames
in an RTP packet but the length of an RTP packet, measured in ms, shall never
exceed the maxptime value.
Table 12.1: Recommended encapsulation parameters

When the access technology is not known to the MTSI media gateway, the default
encapsulation parameters defined in Table 12.1 shall be used.
The SDP offer shall include an RTP payload type where octet-align=0 is defined
or where the octet-align parameter is not specified and should include another
RTP payload type with octet-align=1. MTSI media gateways offering wide-band
speech shall offer these parameters and parameter settings also for the RTP
payload types used for wide-band speech.
MTSI media gateways should support the RTCP-APP signalling defined in clause
10.2.1. The Codec Mode Request (RTCP_APP_CMR) is only relevant when AMR or
AMR-WB is used but the Redundancy Request and the Frame Aggregation Request
can be used for all codecs. When RTCP-APP is not supported or cannot be used
in the session then adaptation can also be based on RTCP Receiver
Reports/Sender Reports.
MTSI media gateways should support redundancy according to clause 9.
NOTE: Support of transmitting redundancy may be especially useful in the case
an MTSI media gateway is aware of the used access technology and knows that
the Generic Access technology is used.
#### 12.3.2.2 Text
Both CTM according to TS 26.226 [52] and RFC 4103 make use of ITU-T
Recommendation T.140 presentation and character coding. Therefore inter-
working is a matter of payload packetization and CTM modulation/demodulation.
### 12.3.3 Explicit Congestion Notification
An MTSI MGW can be used to enable ECN between the MTSI client in terminal and
the MTSI MGW when inter-working with CS GERAN/UTRAN.
If ECN is supported in the MTSI MGW, then the MTSI MGW shall also:
\- support ECN as described in this specification for the MTSI client in
terminal, except that the MTSI MGW does not determine whether ECN can be used
based on the Radio Access Technology that is used towards the MTSI client in
terminal;
\- support RTP/AVPF and SDPCapNeg if the MTSI MGW supports RTCP AVPF ECN
feedback messages;
\- be capable of enabling end-to-end rate adaptation between the MTSI client
in terminal and the CS terminal by performing the following:
\- negotiate the use of ECN with the MTSI client in terminal, if it can be
confirmed that the network used towards the MTSI client in terminal properly
handles ECN-marked packets;
\- inter-work adaptation requests between the MTSI client in terminal and the
CS GERAN/UTRAN;
### 12.3.4 Codec switching procedures with SRVCC
An MTSI client in terminal (hereinafter "local client") using 3GPP PS access
may be handed over to CS access. By that SRVCC procedure, the end-point of the
IP connection moves from the local client to a CS MGW in the CS network, as
described in TS 23.216 (SRVCC) [133].
In order to achieve this handover, the MSC server, controlling the CS MGW,
sends a SIP INVITE message:
\- either to the remote client (in case of SRVCC handover without SRVCC
enhancement);
\- or to the ATCF (in case of SRVCC handover with ATCF enhancement),
to change the communication end from the MTSI client in terminal to the CS MGW
as described in TS 23.237 [134].
If EVS is used between local and remote client before SRVCC and if AMR-WB is
used after SRVCC by the local CS UE, an MTSI MGW (e.g. MSC/CS-MGW or
ATCF/ATGW) can send the RTCP_APP_EP2I request message, (see clause 10.1.2.10),
or a CMR in the RTP payload requesting an EVS AMR-WB IO mode, to the remote
client to request that it switches from the EVS Primary mode to the EVS AMR-WB
IO mode. The mode-set used in CS shall be included in the RTCP_APP_EP2I
request message. Furthermore, the RTCP_APP_EP2I request message also supports
signalling to restrict the timing and destination of codec mode changes. An
SDP offer/answer negotiation between the MTSI MGW and the remote client can
also be performed to align the mode-sets and to optimize the resource usage
and also to request switching to the EVS AMR-WB IO mode.
Correspondingly, the RTCP_APP_EI2P request message can be used to switch from
the EVS AMR-WB IO mode to the EVS Primary mode, e.g. in case an SRVCC handover
to a CS access and a switch to the EVS AMR-WB IO mode is followed by a reverse
SRVCC to perform handover back to the PS access. An SDP offer/answer
negotiation can also be performed to restore the session, e.g. bitrates,
bandwidths and other configuration parameters, to what was used before SRVCC.
## 12.4 PSTN
### 12.4.1 3G-324M
If 3G-324M is supported in the PSTN, then the inter-working can be made as
specified in clause 12.2.
### 12.4.2 Text
PSTN text telephony inter-working with PS environments is described in ITU-T
Recommendation H.248.2 [50]and further elaborated in EG 202 320 [51].
Text telephony modem tones are sensitive to packet loss, jitter and echo
canceller behaviour. Therefore, conversion of modem based transmission of
real-time text is best done at the border of the PSTN. If PSTN text telephone
tones need to be carried audio coded in a PS network, considerations must be
taken to carry them reliably as for example specified in ITU-T Recommendations
V.151 [54] and V.152 [55].
When inter-working with PSTN text telephones, it must be considered that in
PSTN most text telephone communication methods do not allow simultaneous
speech and text transmission. An MTSI client in terminal indicating text
capability shall not automatically initiate text connection efforts on the
PSTN circuit. Instead, either a requirement for text support should be
required from the MTSI client in terminal, active transmission of text from
the MTSI client in terminal, or active transmission of text telephone tones
from the PSTN terminal. See clause 13 of EG 202 320 [51].
Note that the primary goal of real-time text support in MTSI is not to offer a
replica of PSTN text telephony functionality. On the contrary, real-time text
in MTSI is aiming at being a generally useful mainstream feature,
complementing the general usability of the Multimedia Telephony Service for
IMS.
## 12.5 GIP inter-working
### 12.5.1 Text
RFC 4103 [31] and T.140 are specified as default real-time text codec in SIP
telephony devices in RFC 4504 [53]. When GIP implements this codec, the media
stream contents are identical for the two environments. Packetization will
also in many cases be equal, while consideration must be taken to cope with
different levels of redundancy and possible use of different media security
and integrity measures.
### 12.5.2 Speech
See Clause 12.7.
## 12.6 Void
### 12.6.1 Void
### 12.6.2 Void
## 12.7 Inter-working with other IMS and non-IMS IP networks
### 12.7.1 General
IMS and MTSI services are required to support inter-working with similar
services operating on other IP networks, both IMS based and non-IMS based,
[2]. It is an operator option to provide transcoding when the end-to-end codec
negotiation fails to agree on a codec to be used for the session. The
requirements herein apply to MTSI MGWs when such transcoding is provided.
These requirements were designed for sessions carried with IP end-to-end,
possibly inter-connected through one or more other IP networks.
A main objective is to harmonize the requirements for this inter-working case
with the requirements for GERAN/UTRAN CS inter-working defined in Clause 12.3.
There is however one major difference as the MGW requirements in Clause 12.3
apply only to the PS side of the MTSI MGW, i.e. between the MTSI MGW and the
MTSI client in the terminal, while here there are requirements for the MTSI
MGW both towards the MTSI client in the terminal and towards the remote
network.
Most requirements included here apply only to the PS access towards the remote
network but there are also requirements that target both the local MTSI client
in terminal and the remote network or even only the local MTSI client.
### 12.7.2 Speech
#### 12.7.2.1 General
This clause defines how speech media should be handled in MTSI MGWs in inter-
working scenarios between an MTSI client in terminal using 3GPP access and a
non-3GPP IP network and between an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access
and a non-3GPP IP network. This clause therefore defines requirements for what
the MTSI MGW needs to support and how it should behave during session setup
and session modification. A few SDP examples are included in Annex A.10.
#### 12.7.2.2 Speech codecs and formats
##### 12.7.2.2.1 MTSI MGW for interworking between MTSI client in terminal
using 3GPP access and other IMS or non-IMS IP networks
This clause applies to MTSI MGWs used for interworking between an MTSI client
in terminal using 3GPP access and a client using another IMS or non-IMS IP
network.
MTSI MGWs offering speech communication between an MTSI client in a terminal
and a client in another IP network through a Network-to-Network Interface
(NNI) using AMR shall support:
• AMR speech codec modes 12.2, 7.4, 5.9 and 4.75 [11], [12], [13], [14] and
source-controlled rate operation [15], both towards the local MTSI client in
terminal and towards the remote network;
• G.711, both A-law and μ-law PCM, [77], towards the remote network.
and should support:
• linear 16 bit PCM (L16) at 8 kHz sampling frequency, towards the remote
network.
When such MTSI MGWs also offer wideband speech communication using AMR-WB they
shall support:
• AMR wideband codec 12.65, 8.85 and 6.60 [17], ‎[18], ‎[19], [20] and source
controlled rate operation ‎[21] , both towards the local MTSI client in
terminal and towards the remote network;
and should support:
• G.722 (SB-ADPCM) at 64 kbps, [78], towards the remote network; and:
• linear 16 bit PCM (L16) at 16 kHz sampling frequency, towards the remote
network.
NOTE: A TrGW decomposed from an IBCF can also be media-unaware and forward any
media transparentely without changing the encoding. Transcoding support is
optional at the Ix interface.
##### 12.7.2.2.2 MTSI MGW for interworking between MTSI client in terminal
using fixed access and other IMS or non-IMS IP networks
This clause applies to MTSI MGWs used for interworking between an MTSI client
in terminal using fixed access and a client using another IMS or non-IMS IP
network.
Media codecs for MTSI MGWs for speech inter-working between fixed access and
IP clients in other IMS or non-IMS IP networks are specified in TS 181 005
[98] in clause 6.2 for narrow-band codecs and in clause 6.3 for wide-band
codecs. In addition, the MTSI MGW should support linear 16 bit PCM (L16) at 8
kHz sampling frequency for narrow-band speech. An MTSI MGW supporting wideband
speech should also support linear 16 bit PCM (L16) at 16 kHz sampling
frequency.
MTSI MGWs for speech inter-working between access and CS GERAN/UTRAN
supporting AMR and AMR-WB shall follow clause 12.7.2.2.2 for the AMR and AMR-
WB codecs. Tandem-free inter-working should be used whenever possible.
For the other codecs, the MTSI MGW shall follow the recommendations and
requirements defined in clause 18 for the respective codec.
##### 12.7.2.2.3 Common procedures
If the remote network supports AMR for narrowband speech and/or AMR-WB for
wideband speech, then transcoding shall be avoided whenever possible. In this
case, the MTSI MGW should not be included in the RTP path unless it is
required for non transcoding related purposes. If the MTSI MGW is included in
the RTP path then it shall support forwarding the RTP payload regardless of
codec mode and packetization.
NOTE: An example of where transcoding may be required when AMR and/or AMR-WB
are supported by the remote network is when the remote terminal is limited to
modes that are not supported by the local MTSI client in terminal due to
operator configuration.
If the MTSI MGW is performing transcoding of AMR or AMR-WB then it shall be
capable of restricting mode changes, both mode change period and mode changes
to neighboring mode, if this is required by the remote network.
Requirements applicable to MTSI MGW for DTMF events are described in Annex G.
#### 12.7.2.3 Codec preference order for session negotiation
It is important to optimize the quality-bandwidth compromise, even though the
NNI uses a fixed IP network. For this reason, the following preference order
should be used by MTSI MGWs unless another preference order is defined in
bilateral agreements between the operators or configured otherwise by the
operator:
• The best option is if a codec can be used end-to-end. For example, using AMR
or AMR-WB end-to-end is preferable over transcoding through G.711 or G.722
respectively.
• The second best solution is to use G.711 or G.722 as inter-connection
codecs, for narrow-band and wide-band speech respectively, since these codecs
offer a good quality while keeping a reasonable bit rate.
• The linear 16 bit PCM format should only be used as the last resort, when
none of the above solutions are possible.
If a wide-band speech session is possible, then fall-back to narrow-band
speech should be avoided whenever possible, unless another preference order is
indicated in the SDP.
NOTE: There may be circumstances, for example bit rate constraints, when a
fall-back to narrow-band speech is acceptable since the alternative would be a
session setup failure.
#### 12.7.2.4 RTP profiles
MTSI MGWs offering speech communication over the NNI shall support the RTP/AVP
profile and should support the RTP/AVPF profile, [40]. If the RTP/AVPF profile
is supported then the SDP Capability Negotiation (SDPCapNeg) framework shall
also be supported, [69].
An MTSI MGW supporting EVS should support the RTCP-APP signalling for speech
adaptation defined in clause 10.2.1.
#### 12.7.2.5 RTP payload formats
The payload format to be used for AMR and AMR-WB encoded media is defined in
Clause 12.3.2.1. The payload format to be used for EVS encoded media is
defined in [125]. The MTSI MGW shall support the following payload SDP
parameters for AMR and AMR-WB: octet-align, mode-set, mode-change-period,
mode-change-capability, mode-change-neighbor, maxptime, ptime, channels and
max-red.
The payload format to be used for G.711 encoded media is defined in RFC 3551,
[10], for both μ-law (PCMU) and Α-law (PCMA).
The payload format to be used for G.722 encoded media is defined in RFC 3551,
[10].
NOTE: The sampling frequency for G.722 is 16 kHz but is set to 8000 Hz in SDP
since it was (erroneously) defined this way in the original version of the RTP
A/V profile, see [10].
The payload format to be used for linear 16 bit PCM is the L16 format defined
in RFC 3551, [10]. When this format is used for narrow-band speech then the
rate (sampling frequency) indicated on the a=rtpmap line shall be 8000. When
this format is used for wide-band speech then the rate (sampling frequency)
indicated on the a=rtpmap line shall be 16000.
The payload formats to be used for the other codecs are listed in Clause
18.4.3.
#### 12.7.2.6 Packetization
For the G.711, G.722 and linear 16 bit PCM formats, the frame length shall be
20 ms, i.e. 160 and 320 speech samples in each frame for narrow-band and wide-
band speech respectively.
MTSI MGWs offering speech communication over the NNI shall support
encapsulating up to 4 non-redundant speech frames into the RTP packets.
MTSI MGWs may support application layer redundancy. If redundancy is supported
then the MTSI MGW should support encapsulating up to 8 redundant speech frames
in the RTP packets. Thereby, an RTP packet may contain up to 12 frames, up to
4 non-redundant and up to 8 redundant frames.
An MTSI MGW setting up a speech session should align the ptime and maxptime
between the networks so that the same packetization can be used end-to-end,
even when transcoding is used.
The MGW should use the packetization schemes indicated by the ptime value in
the SDP offer and answer. If no ptime value is present in the SDP then the MGW
should encapsulate 1 frame per packet or the packetization used by the end-
point clients.
The MTSI MGW should preserve the packetization used by the end-point clients
to minimize the buffering times otherwise caused by jitter. For example, if
one end-point adapts the packetization to use 2 frames per packet then the
MTSI MGW should adapt the packetization to the other end-point to also use 2
frames per packet. This applies also when the MTSI MGW performs transcoding.
The packet size can become quite large for some combinations of formats and
packetization. If the packet size exceeds the Maximum Transfer Unit (MTU) of
the network then the MTSI MGW should encapsulate fewer frames per packet.
NOTE: It is an implementation consideration to determine the MTU of the
network. RFC 4821 [79] describes one method that can be used to discover the
path MTU.
When the MTSI MGW does not perform any transcoding then it shall be
transparent to the packetization schemes used by the end-point clients.
#### 12.7.2.7 RTCP usage and adaptation
The RTP implementation shall include an RTCP implementation.
MTSI MGWs offering speech should support AVPF (RFC 4585 [40]) configured to
operate in early mode. When allocating RTCP bandwidth, it is recommended to
allocate RTCP bandwidth and set the values for the \"b=RR:\" and the \"b=RS:\"
parameters such that a good compromise between the RTCP reporting needs for
the application and bandwidth utilization is achieved, see also SDP examples
in Annex A.10. When an MTSI MGW uses tandem-free inter-working between two PS
networks then it should align the RTCP bandwidths such that RTCP packets can
be sent with the same frequency in both networks. This is to allow for sending
adaptation requests end-to-end without being forced to buffer the requests in
the MTSI MGW. The value of \"trr-int\" should be set to zero or not
transmitted at all (in which case the default \"trr‑int\" value of zero will
be assumed) when Reduced-Size RTCP (see clause 7.3.6) is not used.
For speech sessions, between the MTSI client in terminal and the MTSI MGW, it
is beneficial to keep the size of RTCP packets as small as possible in order
to reduce the potential disruption of RTCP onto the RTP stream in bandwidth-
limited channels. RTCP packet sizes can be minimized by using Reduced-Size
RTCP packets or using the parts of RTCP compound packets (according to RFC
3550 [9]) which are required by the application.
The MTSI MGW shall be capable of adapting the session to handle possible
congestion. For AMR and AMR-WB encoded media, the MTSI MGW shall support the
adaptation signalling method using RTCP APP packets as defined in clause 10.2,
both towards the MTSI client in terminal and towards the remote network. As
the IP client in the remote network may or may not support the RTCP APP
signalling method, the MTSI MGW shall also be capable of using the inband CMR
in the AMR payload. When receiving inband CMR in the payload from the remote
network, the MTSI MGW does not need to move the adaptation signalling to RTCP
APP packets before sending it to the MTSI client in terminal.
For PCM, G.722 and linear 16 bit PCM encoded media, the MTSI MGW shall support
RFC 3550 for signalling the experienced quality using RTCP Sender Reports and
Receiver Reports.
For a given RTP based media stream to/from the MTSI client in terminal, the
MTSI MGW shall transmit RTCP packets from and receive RTCP packets to the same
port number.
For a given RTP based media stream to/from the remote network, the MTSI MGW
shall transmit RTCP packets from and receive RTCP packets on the same port
number, not necessarily the same port number as used to/from the MTSI client
in terminal.
This facilitates inter-working with fixed/broadband access. However, the MTSI
MGW may, based on configuration or local policy, accept RTCP packets that are
not received from the same remote port where RTCP packets are sent by either
the MTSI client in terminal or the remote network.
#### 12.7.2.8 RTP usage
For AMR and AMR-WB encoded media, the MTSI MGW shall follow the same
requirements when inter-working with other IP network as when inter-working
with GERAN/UTRAN CS, see clause 12.3.2.1.
For a given RTP based media stream to/from the MTSI client in terminal, the
MTSI MGW shall transmit RTP packets from and receive RTP packets to the same
port number.
For a given RTP based media stream to/from the remote network, the MTSI MGW
shall transmit RTP packets from and receive RTP packets on the same port
number, not necessarily the same port number as used to/from the MTSI client
in terminal.
This facilitates inter-working with fixed/broadband access. However, the MTSI
MGW may, based on configuration or local policy, accept RTP packets that are
not received from the same remote port where RTP packets are sent by either
the MTSI client in terminal or the remote network.
#### 12.7.2.9 Session setup and session modification
The MTSI MGW shall be capable of dynamically adding and dropping speech media
during the session.
The MTSI MGW may use the original SDP offer received from the MTSI client in
terminal when creating an SDP offer that is to be sent outbound to the remote
network.
If the MTSI MGW adds codecs to the SDP offer then it shall follow the
recommendations of Clause 12.7.2.3 when creating the outbound SDP offer and
when selecting which codec to include in the outbound SDP answer.
If the MTSI MGW generates an SDP offer based on the offer received from the
MTSI client in terminal, it should maintain the ptime and maxptime values as
indicated by the MTSI client in terminal. If the MTSI MGW generates an SDP
offer without using the SDP offer from the MTSI client in terminal then it
should define the ptime and maxptime values in accordance in Clause 12.7.2.6,
i.e. the preferred values for ptime and maxptime are 20 and 80 respectively.
If the MTSI MGW does not support AVPF (nor SDPCapNeg) then it shall not
include the corresponding lines in the SDP offer that is sent to the remote
network.
#### 12.7.2.10 Audio level alignment
In case of interworking, the audio levels should be aligned to ensure suitable
audio levels to the end users. This is especially important when codecs with
different overload points are used on each side of the MTSI MGW as this can
result in an asymmetrical loudness between the end points.
NOTE 1: The overload point of a given codec refers to the adjustment factor
between the digital levels in input/output of this codec and the resulting
acoustic levels. In practice the overload point value corresponds to the
analog Root Mean Square (RMS) level of a full-scale sinusoidal signal.
For MTSI client in terminal using fixed access, clause 18.8 applies to ensure
proper audio alignment.
For communications requiring interworking with other IMS or non-IMS IP
networks, terminals connected to these networks may use different codecs,
which have different overload points. In this case, it is recommended that the
MTSI MGW doing transcoding ensure proper audio level alignment. This alignment
shall be performed such that the nominal level is preserved (0 dBm0 shall be
maintained to 0 dBm0). As an example, a fixed CAT-IQ DECT terminal
implementing G.722 with a 9 dBm0 overload point as recommended in ITU-T
Recommendation G.722 [78] might need some audio level alignment in case of
wideband voice interworking with a 3GPP terminal using AMR-WB with a 3.14 dBm0
overload point. The audio level alignment may use dynamic range control to
prevent saturation or clipping.
NOTE 2: The definition of the dBm0 unit can be found in ITU-T P.10 [108].
### 12.7.3 Explicit Congestion Notification
An MTSI MGW can be used to enable ECN within the local network when the local
ECN-capable MTSI client in terminal is in a network that properly handles ECN-
marked packets, and either the remote network cannot be confirmed to properly
handle ECN-marked packets or the remote terminal does not support or use ECN.
If ECN is supported in the MTSI MGW, then the MTSI MGW shall also:
\- support RTP/AVPF and SDPCapNeg if the MTSI MGW supports RTCP AVPF ECN
feedback messages;
\- be capable of enabling end-to-end rate adaptation between the local MTSI
client in terminal and the remote client by performing the following towards
the local MTSI client in terminal:
\- negotiate the use of ECN;
\- support ECN as described in this specification for the MTSI client in
terminal, except that the MTSI MGW does not determine whether ECN can be used
based on the Radio Access Technology.
NOTE: The adaptation requests are transmitted between the local and the remote
client without modification by the MTSI MGW.
An MTSI MGW can also be used to enable ECN end-to-end if the remote client
uses ECN in a different way than what is described in this specification for
the MTSI client in terminal, e.g. if the remote client only supports probing
for the ECN initiation phase or it needs the RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages.
### 12.7.4 Text
The codec and other considerations for real-time text described in the present
document for MTSI clients in terminal using 3GPP access apply also to MTSI
clients in terminal using fixed access. There are thus no inter-working
considerations on the media level between these types of end-points.
### 12.7.5 Inter-working IPv4 and IPv6 networks
If different IP versions are used by the offerer and the answerer, information
in the SDP offer or answer related to IP version and QoS negotiation should be
modified appropriately by the MTSI MGW so that the offerer and the answerer
agree with an identical or similar source bit-rates.
For video, b=AS in IPv6 should be assumed to be a product of b=AS in IPv4 and
1.04, rounded down to a nearest integer, when other information that can be
used to re-compute b=AS in IPv6 from b=AS in IPv4 is not present. Likewise,
b=AS in IPv4 should be assumed to be a product of b=AS in IPv6 and 0.96,
rounded up to a nearest integer. These formulas meet the relationship of b=AS
values for 176×144 and 320×240 in Table N.x. Depending on service policy or
codec configuration, other formulas can be used.
An MTSI MGW for interworking between IPv4 and IPv6 networks supporting the
'a=bw-info' attribute (see clause 19) shall re-compute the bandwidth
properties signalled with this attribute if only bandwidths for either IPv4 or
IPv6 are present. If bandwidth properties are provided with values for both
IPv4 and IPv6 then the MTSI MGW should not re-compute the bandwidths.
# 13 Void
# 13a Media types, codecs and formats used for MSRP transport
## 13a.1 General
The IMS messaging service is described in TS 26.141 [59]. The description of
IMS messaging in clauses 1-6 of 3GPP TS 26.141 [59] is applicable for MSRP-
transported media in MTSI. The MSRP transport itself is described in 3GPP TS
24.247 [82].
All statements in TS 26.141 regarding IMS messaging are valid for MSRP
transported media in MTSI including the status of the statement (shall,
should, may).
Any differences between IMS messaging in 3GPP TS 26.141 [59] and MSRP
transported media in MTSI are described in clause 13a.2.
## 13a.2 Difference relative to 3GPP TS 26.141
### 13a.2.1 Video
**For MSRP transported Media in MTSI, clause 5.2.2 of this specification
applies**.
# 14 Supplementary services
## 14.1 General
In this section media layer behaviour is specified for relevant supplementary
services. The supplementary services included in MTSI are described in 3GPP TS
24.173 [57]. The requirements on the codec support and the data transport are
identical to those listed in clauses 5.2 and 7. These requirements are listed
here due to the fact that there might be other media‑influencing nodes in MTSI
whose behaviour is not explicitly covered by other parts of the present
document.
The recommended behaviour described in the following sections is valid for
MTSI clients, i.e. all session IP end-points; terminals, MTSI media gateways
and other 3GPP network nodes acting as IP endpoints in MTSI sessions.
## 14.2 Media formats and transport
Any implementation of a supplementary service which affects media or media
handling, e.g. such as media creation, media rendering and media manipulation,
shall meet the same requirements as a MTSI client in terminal regarding codec
support and codec usage. Where applicable,, speech codecs shall be supported
according to clause 5.2.1, video according to clause 5.2.2 and text according
to clause 5.2.3.
Similarly, the configuration and the transport of the media in any
implementation of a supplementary service which affects media or media
handling shall be done according to clause 7.
## 14.3 Media handling in hold procedures
Whenever a supplementary service includes a hold procedure according to RFC
3264 [58], e.g. when using the HOLD supplementary service, the media flow is
changed in terms of the session flow attribute (e.g. changing the session
attribute \"sendrecv\" into \"sendonly\" or \"recvonly\" or \"inactive\" and
then back again). When this occurs, any involved media-originating or media-
terminating node should take measures to ensure that the transitions between
the different media flow states in the session occur with minimal impact on
the media quality.
When a full-duplex session has put the media flow on hold (see section 8.4 in
RFC 3264 [58]), the media flow has been changed into a unidirectional flow
through changing the session attribute into either \"sendonly\" or
\"recvonly\". When resuming the session, it is restored to full duplex by
changing the flow attributes back into \"sendrecv\" from \"sendonly\" and
\"recvonly\". In this case, the encoder and decoder states in the MTSI clients
may not be aligned and a state mismatch could occur. This would result in
media quality degradation. Therefore, the following actions are recommended
whenever the media session is not being put on hold anymore and the session is
restored to full duplex:
\- for speech media, the speech decoders should be reset;
\- for video media, the video encoders should start the updated session with a
full infra refresh even if the previously allocated encoders are still active
and no infra refresh is scheduled to be sent.
# 15 Network preference management object
## 15.1 General
The MTSI client in the terminal may use the OMA-DM solution specified in this
clause for enhancing the SDP negotiation and resource reservation process. If
a MTSI client in the terminal uses this feature, it is mandatory for the MTSI
client in the terminal to implement the Management Object (MO) as described in
this clause.
The 3GPP MTSINP (MTSI Network Preference) MO defined in this clause may be
used to manage the QoS profile settings which express the network preference
for the MTSI client in the terminal. The MO covers parameters that the MTSI
client in the terminal could make use of in SDP negotiation and resource
reservation process. If a MTSI client in the terminal supports the feature,
the usage of the MO includes:
1\. During SDP negotiation process, MTSI client in the terminal should start
SDP negotiation based on the MO parameters.
2\. During resource reservation process, MTSI client in the terminal should
start QoS negotiation based on the MO parameters.
The following parameters in MTSI should be included in the Management Object
(MO):
Speech codec (AMR, AMR-WB, EVS) and bearer QoS parameters
Video codec (H.263, MP4, H.264 (AVC), H.265 (HEVC)) and bearer QoS parameters
Real Time text bearer QoS parameters
Indication of the priority when there are more than one alternative for a
media type is included. Version numbering is included for possible extending
of MO.
The Management Object Identifier shall be: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-mtsinp:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: The MO is compatible with OMA Device Management
protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA
DM Device Description Framework as described in the Enabler Release Definition
OMA-ERELD _DM-V1_2[67].
## 15.2 Nodes Definition
The following nodes and leaf objects in figure 15.1 shall be contained under
the 3GPP_MTSINP node if a MTSI client in the terminal support the feature

## 15.3 Example Configuration of 3GPP MTSINP MO
The examples below are configurations of 3GPP MTSINP MO for selected speech,
text, and video sessions in Annex A. An example of SDP offer for speech
session is shown in Table A.6.1, which includes two RTP payload types for AMR-
NB. Parameter values in Table 15.1 may apply to both payload types and
additional SDP parameters such as max-red may be included under the Ext node
as vendor extensions. Depending on the implementation, two sets of session
parameters may be defined for the two payload types respectively.

An example configuration of MTSINP for video session is shown in Table 15.3,
which includes two RTP payload types for H.264 and H.263 respectively.
Although the "b=AS" value can also be computed with the Source and PayloadSize
nodes, a different value with appropriate implementation margin can be
directly assigned to the AS node. If the AS, Source, and PayloadSize nodes are
defined together, the AS node value should be used for setting "b=AS". In
Table 15.3, the "b=AS" values of 315 and 57 kbps, for H.264 and H.263
respectively, are computed assuming IPv4 addressing. Note that the Priority
nodes of H.264 and H.263 are assigned values of 5 and 3 respectively, which
shows that depending on service policy, parameters sets of lower priority may
be preferred in the construction of SDP offer. If the ImageAttr node is to be
defined, the maximum image size in either the Send or Recv node shall not
exceed the maximum size limited by the offered codec level, which is 352x288
for Baseline profile at level 1.1.

# 16 Quality of Experience
## 16.1 General
The MTSI Quality of Experience (QoE) metrics feature is optional for an MTSI
client in a terminal and shall not disturb the MTSI service. Non-terminal MTSI
clients (such as gateways) should not implement MTSI QoE reporting. An MTSI
client that supports the QoE metrics feature shall support OMA-DM. The OMA-DM
configuration server can configure the activation/deactivation and gathering
of QoE metrics in the MTSI client. An MTSI client supporting the feature shall
perform the quality measurements in accordance to the measurement definitions,
aggregate them into client QoE metrics and report the metrics to the QoE
server using the HTTP transport protocol. The MTSI client may send QoE metrics
reports to a receiving QoE server during the session and at the end of the
session. The way how the QoE metrics are processed and made available is out
of the scope of this specification.
## 16.2 Metrics Definition
An MTSI client supporting the QoE metrics feature shall support the reporting
of the metrics in this clause. The metrics are valid for speech, video and
text media, and are calculated for each measurement resolution interval
\"Measure-Resolution\" (sub-clause 16.3.2). They are reported to the server
according to the measurement reporting interval \"Sending-Rate\" (sub-clause
16.3.2) and after the end of the session (sub-clause 16.4).
### 16.2.1 Corruption duration metric
Corruption duration, M, is the time period from the NPT time of the last good
frame (since the NPT time for the first corrupted frame cannot always be
determined) before the corruption, to the NPT time of the first subsequent
good frame. A corrupted frame may either be an entirely lost frame, or a media
frame that has quality degradation and the decoded frame is not the same as in
error-free decoding.
A good frame is a completely received frame:
\- where all parts of the image are guaranteed to contain the correct content;
or
\- that is a refresh frame, that is, does not reference any previously decoded
frames; or
\- which only references previously decoded good frames
Completely received means that all the bits are received and no bit error has
occurred.
Corruption duration, M, in milliseconds can be calculated as below:
a) M can be derived by the client using the codec layer, in which case the
codec layer signals the decoding of a good frame to the client. A good frame
could also be derived by error tracking methods, but decoding quality
evaluation methods shall not be used.
b) Alternatively, the corruption is considered as ended after N milliseconds
with consecutively completely received frames, or when a refresh frame has
been completely received, whichever comes first..\ \ The optional
configuration parameter N can be set to define the average characteristics of
the codec. If N has not been configured it shall default to the length of one
measurement interval for video media, and to one frame duration for non-video
media.
The syntax for the metrics \"Corruption_Duration\" is as defined in sub-clause
16.3.2.
The N parameter is specified in milliseconds and is used with the
\"Corruption_Duration\" parameter in the \"3GPP-QoE-Metrics\" definition. The
value of N may be set by the server. The syntax for N to be included in the
\"att-measure-spec\" (sub-clause 16.3.2) is as follows:
\- N = \"N\" \"=\" 1*DIGIT
All the occurred corruption durations within each resolution period are summed
and stored in the vector _TotalCorruptionDuration_. The unit of this metrics
is expressed in milliseconds. Within each resolution period the number of
individual corruption events are summed up and stored in the vector
_NumberOfCorruptionEvents._ These two vectors are reported by the MTSI client
as part of the reception report (sub-clause 16.4).
The parameter _CorruptionAlternative_ indicates how the metric has been
calculated, and shall be sent by the client via reception reporting (sub-
clause 16.3.2) as \"a\", or \"b\".
### 16.2.2 Successive loss of RTP packets
The metric \"Successive_Loss\" indicates the number of RTP packets lost in
succession per media channel.
The syntax for the metrics \"Successive_Loss\" is as defined in sub-clause
16.3.2.
All the number of successively lost RTP packets are summed up within each
measurement resolution period of the stream and stored in the vector
_TotalNumberofSuccessivePacketLoss_. The unit of this metric is expressed as
an integer equal to or larger than 0. The number of individual successive
packet loss events within each measurement resolution period are summed up and
stored in the vector _NumberOfSuccessiveLossEvents. The number of received
packets are also summed up within each measurement resolution period and
stored in the vector NumberOfReceivedPackets._ These three vectors are
reported by the MTSI client as part of the QoE report (sub-clause 16.4)
### 16.2.3 Frame rate
Frame rate indicates the playback frame rate. The playback frame rate is equal
to the number of frames displayed during the measurement resolution period
divided by the time duration, in seconds, of the measurement resolution
period.
The syntax for the metric \"Frame_Rate\" is defined in sub-clause 16.3.2.
For the Metrics-Name \"Frame_Rate\", the value field indicates the frame rate
value. This metric is expressed in frames per second, and can be a fractional
value. The frame rates for each resolution period are stored in the vector
_FrameRate_ and reported by the MTSI client as part of the QoE report (sub-
clause 16.4).
### 16.2.4 Jitter duration
Jitter happens when the absolute difference between the actual playback time
and the expected playback time is larger than _JitterThreshold_ milliseconds.
The expected time of a frame is equal to the actual playback time of the last
played frame plus the difference between the NPT time of the frame and the NPT
time of the last played frame.
The syntax for the metric \"Jitter_Duration\" is defined in sub-clause 16.3.2.
The optional configuration parameter JT can be set to control the amount of
allowed jitter. If the parameter has not been set, it defaults to 100 ms. _The
JT parameter is specified in ms and_ is used with the \"Jitter_Duration\"
parameter in the \"3GPP-QoE-Metrics\" definition. The value of JT may be set
by the server. The syntax for _JT_ to be included in the \"att-measure-spec\"
(sub-clause 16.3.2) is as follows:
\- JT = \"JT\" \"=\" 1*DIGIT
All the jitter durations are summed up within each measurement resolution
period and stored in the vector _TotalJitterDuration_. The unit of this metric
is expressed in seconds, and can be a fractional value. The number of
individual events within the measurement resolution period are summed up and
stored in the vector _NumberOfJitterEvents._ These two vectors are reported by
the MTSI client as part of the QoE report (sub-clause 16.4).
### 16.2.5 Sync loss duration
Sync loss happens when the absolute difference between value A and value B is
larger than _SyncThreshold_ milliseconds. Value A represents the difference
between the playback time of the last played frame of the video stream and the
playback time of the last played frame of the speech/audio stream. Value B
represents the difference between the expected playback time of the last
played frame of the video stream and the expected playback time of the last
played frame of the speech/audio stream.
The syntax for the metric \"SyncLoss_Duration\" is defined in sub-clause
16.3.2.
The optional configuration parameter ST can be set to control the amount of
allowed sync mismatch. If the parameter has not been set, it defaults to 100
ms. _The ST parameter is specified in ms and_ is used with the
\"SyncLoss_Duration\" parameter in the \"3GPP-QoE-Metrics\" definition. The
value of ST may be set by the server. The syntax for _ST_ to be included in
the \"att-measure-spec\" (sub-clause 16.3.2) is as follows:
\- ST = \"ST\" \"=\" 1*DIGIT
All the sync loss durations are summed up within each measurement resolution
period and stored in the vector _TotalSyncLossDuration_. The unit of this
metric is expressed in seconds, and can be a fractional value. The number of
individual events within the measurement resolution period are summed up and
stored in the vector _NumberOfSyncLossEvents._ These two vectors are reported
by the MTSI client as part of the QoE report (sub-clause 16.4).
### 16.2.6 Round-trip time
The round-trip time (RTT) consists of the RTP-level round-trip time, plus the
additional two-way delay (RTP level->loudspeaker->microphone->RTP level) due
to buffering and other processing in each client.
The syntax for the metric \"Round_Trip_Time\" is defined in sub-clause 16.3.2.
The last RTCP round-trip time value estimated during each measurement
resolution period shall be stored in the vector _NetworkRTT_. The unit of this
metrics is expressed in milliseconds.
The two-way additional internal client delay valid at the end of each
measurement resolution period shall be stored in the vector _InternalRTT_. The
unit of this metrics is expressed in milliseconds.
The two vectors are reported by the MTSI client as part of the QoE report
(sub-clause 16.4).
Note that if the RTP and the RTCP packets for a media are not sent in the same
RTP stream the estimated media round-trip time might be unreliable.
### 16.2.7 Average codec bitrate
The average codec bitrate is the bitrate used for coding "active" media
information during the measurement resolution period.
For speech media "active" information is defined by frames containing speech,
i.e. silence frames (SID-frames) and DTX periods are excluded from the
calculation. Thus for speech media the average codec bitrate can be calculated
as the number of speech bits received for "active" frames , divided by the
total time, in seconds, covered by these frames. The total time covered is
calculated as the number of "active" frames times the length of each speech
frame.
For non-speech media the average codec bitrate is the total number of RTP
payload bits received, divided by the length of the measurement resolution
period.
The syntax for the metric \"Average_Codec_Bitrate\" is defined in sub-clause
16.3.2.
The average codec bitrate value for each measurement resolution period shall
be stored in the vector _AverageCodecBitrate_. The unit of this metrics is
expressed in kbit/s and can be a fractional value. The vector is reported by
the MTSI client as part of the QoE report (sub-clause 16.4).
### 16.2.8 Codec information
The codec information metrics contain details of the media codec used during
the measurement resolution period. If the codec information is changed during
the measurement resolution period, the codec information valid when each
measurement resolution period ends shall be reported. The unit of this metric
is a string value. No \"white space\" characters are allowed in the string
values, and shall be removed if necessary.
For speech media the codec information contains the speech codec type,
represented as in an SDP offer, for instance \"AMR-WB/1600/1\".
For video media, the codec information contains the video codec type,
represented as in an SDP offer, for instance "H263-2000/90000". Furthermore,
the video profile and level used, as well as the image size used shall be
reported. For instance \"profile=0;level=45\" for the profile and level
information and "176x144" for the image size. In some cases the profile and
level is reported together, for instance \"profile-level-id=42e00a\". Note
that the image size reported for each measurement resolution period shall be
the one actually used, not the maximum size allowed by the SDP negotiation.
For real-time text media, the codec information contains the text encoding,
represented as in an SDP offer, for instance \"t140/1000/1\".
The syntax for the metric \"Codec_Info\", "Codec_ProfileLevel" and
"Codec_ImageSize" are defined in sub-clause 16.3.2.
The codec info, profile / level and codec image size value for each
measurement resolution period shall be stored in the vectors C _odecInfo_ ,
_CodecProfileLevel_ and _CodecImageSize_ respectively. If the metric values in
these vectors for a measurement resolution period are unchanged from the
previous values in the respective vector, it is allowed to put the value "="
in the vector to indicate this. The C _odecInfo, CodecProfileLevel_ and
_CodecImageSize_ vectors are reported by the MTSI client as part of the QoE
report (sub-clause 16.4).
## 16.3 Metric Configuration
An MTSI client supporting the QoE metrics feature shall use the OMA-DM
solution specified in this clause for configuration of QoE metrics and their
activation. If an MTSI client uses this feature, it is mandatory for the MTSI
client to implement the Management Object (MO) as described in this clause.
The 3GPP MTSIQOE (MTSI QoE metrics) MO defined in this clause may be used to
configure the QoE metrics and reporting settings.
The metrics specified in the MO may be derived by the MTSI client. Version
numbering is included for possible extension of the MO.
The Management Object Identifier shall be: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-mtsiqoe:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: The MO is compatible with OMA Device Management
protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA
DM Device Description Framework as described in the Enabler Release Definition
OMA-ERELD _DM-V1_2 [67].
### 16.3.1 QoE metrics reporting management object
The following nodes and leaf objects in figure 16.1 shall be contained under
the 3GPP_MTSIQOE node if an MTSI client supports the feature described in this
clause (information of DDF for this MO is given in Annex I):

### 16.3.2 QoE metric reporting configuration
The syntax of the text contained in the Metrics leaf is similar to the "3GPP-
QoE-Metrics" attribute syntax specified in 3GPP TS 26.234 [60] and 3GPP TS
26.346 [74]:
\- QoE-Metrics = \"3GPP-QoE-Metrics:\" att-measure-spec *(\",\" att-measure-
spec)) CRLF
\- att-measure-spec = Metrics \";\" Sending-rate [\";\" Measure-Range]\ [\";\"
Measure-Resolution] *([\";\" Parameter-Ext])
\- Metrics = \"metrics\" \"=\" \"{\"Metrics-Name *(\"\|\" Metrics-Name) \" }\"
\- Metrics-Name = 1*((0x21..0x2b) / (0x2d..0x3a) / (0x3c..0x7a) / 0x7e) ;VCHAR
except \";\", \",\", \"{\" or \"}\"
\- Sending-Rate = \"rate\" \"=\" 1*DIGIT / \"End\"
\- Measure-Resolution = \"resolution\" \"=\" 1*DIGIT ; in seconds
\- Measure-Range = \"range\" \":\" Ranges-Specifier
\- Parameter-Ext = (1*DIGIT [\".\" 1*DIGIT]) / (1*((0x21..0x2b) / (0x2d..0x3a)
/ (0x3c..0x7a) / 0x7c / 0x7e))
\- Ranges-Specifier = as defined in RFC 2326 [72].
This attribute is used to indicate which QoE metrics are supported, the
reporting interval, the measurement interval and reporting range.
The \"Metrics\" field contains the list of names that describes the
metrics/measurements that are required to be reported in a MTSI call, provided
that the MTSI client supports these measurements and the reporting rule
conditions are met (see clause 16.3.3). The names that are not included in the
\"Metrics\" field shall not be reported during the session.
The \"Sending-Rate\" shall be set, and it expresses the maximum time period in
seconds between two successive QoE reports. If the \"Sending-Rate\" value is
0, then the client shall decide the sending time of the reports depending on
the events occurred in the client. Values ≥ 1 indicate a precise reporting
interval. The shortest interval is one second and the longest interval is
undefined. The reporting interval can be different for different media, but it
is recommended to maintain a degree of synchronization in order to avoid extra
traffic in the uplink direction. The value \"End\" indicates that only one
report is sent at the end of the session.
The optional \"Measure-Resolution\" field, if used, shall define a time over
which each metrics value is calculated. The \"Measure-Resolution\" field
splits the session duration into a number of equally sized periods where each
period is of the length specified by the \"Measure-Resolution\" field. The
\"Measure-Resolution\" field is thus defining the time before the calculation
of a QoE parameter starts over. If the \"Measure-Resolution\" field is not
present, the metrics resolution shall cover the period specified by the
\"Measure-Range\" field. If the \"Measure-Range\" field is not present the
metrics resolution shall be the whole session duration.
The optional \"Measure-Range\" field, if used, shall define the time range in
the stream for which the QoE metrics will be reported. There shall be only one
range per measurement specification. The range format shall be any of the
formats allowed by the media. If the \"Measure-Range\" field is not present,
the metrics range shall be the whole call duration.
### 16.3.3 QoE reporting rule definition
This clause defines the syntax and semantics of a set of rules which are used
to reduce the amount of reporting to the QoE metrics report server. The syntax
of the metrics reporting rules is defined below:
> \- QoE-Rule = \"3GPP-QoE-Rule\" \":\" rule-spec *(\",\" rule-spec)
>
> \- rule-spec = rule-name [\";\" parameters]
>
> \- rule-name = \"OnlyCallerReports\" / \"LimitSessionInterval\" /
> \"SamplePercentage\"
>
> \- parameters = parameter *(\";\" parameter)
>
> \- parameter = Param-Name [\"=\" Param-Value ]
\- Param-Name = 1*((0x21..0x2b) / (0x2d..0x3a) / (0x3c..0x7a) / 0x7e) ;VCHAR
except \";\", \",\", \"{\" or \"}\"
\- Param-Value = (1*DIGIT [\".\" 1*DIGIT]) / (1*((0x21..0x2b) / (0x2d..0x3a) /
(0x3c..0x7a) / 0x7c / 0x7e))
The semantics of the rules and the syntax of its parameters is defined below:
The _OnlyCallerReports_ rule is used to determine the metrics reporting
sources. When this rule is present, only the initiator of the call, i.e.,
caller, will report metrics to the QoE report server. When absent all parties
report metrics.
The _SamplePercentage_ rule can be used to set a percentage sample of calls
which should report reception. This can be useful for statistical data
analysis of large populations while increasing scalability due to reduced
total uplink signalling. The _sample_percentage parameter_ takes on a value
between 0 and 100, including the use of decimals. It is recommended that no
more than 3 digits follow a decimal point (e.g. 67.323 is sufficient
precision).
When the _SamplePercentage_ rule is not present or its _sample_percentage
parameter_ value is 100 each MTSI client shall send metric report(s). If the
_sample_percentage_ value is less than 100, the UE generates a random number
which is uniformly distributed in the range of 0 to 100. The UE sends the
reception report when the generated random number is of a lower value than the
_sample_percentage_ value.
The _LimitSessionInterval_ rule is used to limit the time interval between
consecutive calls that report metrics. The _min_interval_ parameter for this
rule indicates the minimum time distance between the start of two calls that
are allowed to report metrics. When this rule is absent there is no limitation
on the minimum time interval.
In case multiple rules are defined in the Management Object, the MTSI client
should only report metrics when all individual rules evaluate to true (i.e.
the rules are logically ANDed). In case no rules are present the MTSI client
should always report metrics (see also clause 16.4 for metrics reporting
procedures).
An example for a QoE metric reporting rule is shown below:
3GPP-QoE-Rule:OnlyCallerReports,SamplePercentage;sample_percentage=10.0,\
LimitSessionInterval;min_interval=300,
This example rule defines that only the caller shall report, and only for 10%
of the sessions, with the minimum time interval between the start times of two
consecutive calls that report metrics to be 5 minutes.
## 16.4 Metrics Reporting
When a session is started, the MTSI client must determine whether QoE
reporting is required for the session. If the MO parameter \"Enabled\" is set
to false, no QoE reporting shall be done. If the \"Enabled\" parameter is set
to true the optional MO \"Rule\" parameters are checked (sub-clause 16.3.3) to
define if QoE reporting shall be done.
Once the need for QoE reporting has been established, the client shall
continuously compute all specified metrics for each measurement interval
period, according to the \"Measure-Resolution\" parameter (sub-clause 16.3.2).
In order to bound the resources used by metrics reporting, the minimum values
for the Measure-Resolution and Sending-Rate are specified to be 5 seconds and
30 seconds respectively. The computed metrics are represented in a vector
format, adding an additional metric value to each metric vector after each new
measurement interval period.
Note that the calculated metrics shall only cover one measurement interval.
For instance, if the corruption duration extends longer than to the end of the
current measurement interval, only the portion which fits into the current
measurement interval shall be reported. The remaining portion of the
corruption duration shall be reported as belonging to the next measurement
interval.
The end of the session will normally not correspond to the end of a
measurement interval period, so the metrics for the last measurement interval
period will typically be calculated over a time shorter than the configured
measurement interval. Note, however, that these last metrics shall still be
added to the metrics vectors and reported to the server.
It is possible for the server to use the start and stop timestamps, together
with the knowledge of the configured measurement interval, to derive the
actual length of the last measurement interval period, but any specific action
or interpretation of these last shorter measurements is out of scope of this
specification.
The MTSI client shall send QoE report messages to the server in accordance
with the specified reporting interval \"Sending-Rate\" (sub-clause 16.3.2).
All stored metrics data shall then be sent to the server, and then deleted
from the metrics storage.
Note that if the reporting interval is not an integer multiple of the
measurement interval, only the measurement interval periods which have been
fully passed shall be included in the report. The ongoing not-passed
measurement interval period shall be included in the next report. The only
exception is at the end of the session, where also the last ongoing
measurement interval period shall be directly calculated and included in the
report.
The client shall send QoE reports using the HTTP (RFC 2616 [73]) POST request
carrying XML formatted metadata. If the optional \"APN\" parameter is defined
in the OMA managed object, that APN shall be used for establishing the PDP
context or EPS bearer on which the QoE metric reports will be transmitted. The
MTSI client randomly selects one of the URIs from the MO \"Server\" parameter,
with uniform distribution.
Each QoE report is formatted in XML according the following XML schema (sub-
clause 16.4.1). An informative example of a single reception report XML object
is also given (sub-clause 16.4.2). The reports should be compressed using GZIP
only if the MO parameter \"Format\" specifies this.
Each QoE Metrics element has a set of attributes and any number of media level
QoE Metrics elements. All attributes are defined in sub-clause 16.4.1 and
correspond to the QoE metrics listed in sub-clause 16.2. Individual metrics
can be selected as described in sub-clause 16.3.2.
Except for the media level QoE metrics, the following parameters shall be
reported for each report:
\- The _callId_ attribute identifies the call identity of the SIP session.
\- The _clientId_ attribute is unique identifier for the receiver, e.g. an
MSISDN of the UE as defined in [80].
\- The _startTime_ and _stopTime_ attributes identifies the client NTP time
when the measurements included in the report were started and stopped. The
time is based on the local real-time clock in the client, and might not be
consistent with the true NTP time. However, assuming that the reporting is
done without any extra delay the server can use the _stopTime_ attribute to
correct the timestamps if necessary.
\- The _mediaId_ attribute shall be reported for each media level QoE report,
and identifies the port number for the media.

# 17 Management of Media Adaptation
## 17.1 General
For the purpose of quality control or network management, it can be necessary
to adjust the speech and video adaptation of the MTSI client in terminal. To
effectively manage, i.e., initialize and update, the media adaptation of a
large number of terminals, which can be implemented in different fashions, the
3GPP MTSIMA (MTSI Media Adaptation) MO defined in this clause may be used.
The MO, which exploits the information estimated or received from various
entities such as ongoing multimedia packet stream, the far-end MTSI client in
terminal, IMS, and network node such as eNodeB, provides two sets of
parameters that can be used in the design of adaptation state machines for
speech and video respectively. The parameters are contrived such that
dependence on media codec or radio access bearer technology is avoided as much
as possible, not to constrain the evolution of these elements. In addition,
vendor specific parameters taking advantage of the implementation can be
placed under Ext nodes.
By altering the parameters of the MO via OMA-DM protocol, media adaptation
behavior of the MTSI client in terminal can be modified up to extent allowed
by the implementation. Note that due to the underlying uncertainties and
complexities, one should expect only to shape the expected bit rate trajectory
of multimedia stream over time-varying transmission conditions, rather than to
control the media flow in a timely and stringent manner. Detailed descriptions
of the speech and video adaptation parameters can be found in table 17.1 and
17.2.
The Management Object Identifier shall be: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-mtsima:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: The MO is compatible with OMA Device Management
protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA
DM Device Description Framework as described in the Enabler Release Definition
OMA-ERELD_DM-V1_2 [67].
## 17.2 Media adaptation management object
The following nodes and leaf objects in figure 17.1 shall be contained under
the 3GPP_MTSIMA node if the MTSI client in terminal supports the feature
described in this clause. Information of DDF for this MO is given in Annex J.

## 17.3 Management procedures
This clause explains how speech and video adaptation of the MTSI client in
terminal can be managed using 3GPP MTSIMA MO and OMA-DM protocol. First, it is
necessary to describe the expected behavior of media adaptation, i.e.,
reaction of the MTSI client in terminal to the received RTCP-APP and TMMBR
messages, information on the transmission results such as RTCP RR and SR,
signalled changes in transport characteristics such as ECN Congestion
Experienced (ECN-CE) marking in IP packet headers, and analysis of packet
reception status. Such descriptions, which include many parameters of
different nature, can be made in the form of adaptation state machines or
state transition tables, as in Annex C, based on the criteria for service
quality or the policy for network management.
Some parameters in the descriptions can be determined in session setup or
measured during session, and therefore do not require to be managed from
outside. For example, the maximum or minimum bit rate of speech and video
codecs, and round-trip time (RTT) belong to this class of parameters. It is
also possible that other parameters are implementation-specific, or related to
detailed features of media codec or underlying radio access bearer technology.
These classes of parameters are not provided by 3GPP MTSIMA MO but still can
be included under Ext nodes as vendor extensions.
The next step will be to select the parameters to be included in 3GPP MTSIMA
MO. It might not be practical or necessary to update all parameters in the
descriptions and selecting a subset of key parameters might simplify the
management. The set of parameters selected should enable the behavior of media
adaptation to be controlled up to the necessary extent.
The results of session setup may influence the selection of media adaptation
methods to apply. For example, the negotiated media codec and the bandwidth,
or whether to use ECN or not may determine the necessary adaptation
procedures. Selection of session parameters from 3GPP MTSINP MO falls outside
the scope of the present document. Information available to the MTSI client in
terminal that may assist such decisions includes, but may not be limited to,
the radio access bearer technology, information on service provider broadcast
by (e)NodeB, date and time, and service policy.
### 17.3.1 Management of speech adaptation
3GPP MTSIMA MO contains a set of parameters which can be used in the
construction of adaptation state machines. If available, information on the
expected behavior of the network, such as the scheduling strategy applied to
eNodeB, can assist the design and calibration process. Basically the receiver
estimates the encoding and payload packetization status of the sender, and
transmits appropriate RTCP-APP messages when the state of adaptation state
machine needs to be switched.
Each PLR in table 17.1 is used to specify the conditions, usually as a
threshold, to enter or exit a state. MAX, LOW, STATE_REVERSION, and
RED_INEFFECTIVE correspond to PLR_1, PLR_2, PLR_3, and PLR_4 in Annex C
respectively. Once the measured PLR exceeds or falls below the thresholds,
while meeting certain conditions, adaptation state machine triggers the
programmed transitions. A subset of PLRs can be used to construct adaptation
state machines with fewer states. For example, the two-state adaptation state
machine in Annex C can be built with MAX and LOW. DURATION_MAX, DURATION_LOW,
DURATION_STATE_REVERSION, and DURATION_RED_INEFFECTIVE can be used to specify
the duration of sliding window over which MAX, LOW, STATE_REVERSION, and
RED_INEFFECTIVE PLR are observed and computed. DURATION is reserved for the
case when it is not necessary to separately specify the durations. N_HOLD
allows setting of the duration as an integer multiple of DURATION.
With each pair of a PLR and a DURATION, the observation period of each PLR can
be controlled and the sensitivity of each transition path can be tailored to
meet the requirements. For example, larger DURATION values are likely to
smooth out the impact of bursty loss of packets and reduce the likelihood of
frequent transitions between states, i.e., the ping-pong effects, but can
delay the reaction to events that require immediate repairing actions. In
general, transitions to states designed for better transmission conditions
need to be taken more conservately than transitions to states for worse
transmission conditions. Other requirements can be combined with PLR to refine
the conditions for transitions.
Packet loss burst (PLB) refers to a davastating event in which a large number
of packets are lost during a limited period. Immediate measures, such as
changing the bit rate or payload packetization are required to reduce the
impact on the perceived speech quality. As PLR and PLR/DURATION enable
detailed specification of PLR, PLB can be described efficiently with
PLB/LOST_PACKET and PLB/DURATION.
The parameters ICM/INITIAL_CODEC_RATE, ICM/INIT_WAIT and
ICM/INIT_UPSWITCH_WAIT can be used to control the rate adaptation during the
beginning of the session. ICM/INITIAL_CODEC_RATE is used to define what codec
mode should be used when starting the encoding for the RTP stream. In EVS
Primary mode, ICM/INITIAL_CODEC_BANDWIDTH is used to define which audio
bandwidth should be used when starting the encoding for the RTP stream.
ICM/INIT_WAIT defines the period over which the sending MTSI client in
terminal should use the Initial Codec Mode when ECN is not used. If no codec
mode request or other feedback information is received within this period then
the sender is allowed to adapt to a higher rate. Since it is unknown in the
beginning of the RTP stream whether the transmission path can support higher
rates, the adaptation to higher bit rates needs to be conservative. It is
therefore recommended that when adapting to a higher rate the sender increases
the rate only to the next higher rate in the list of codec modes allowed in
the session. It is also recommended that the sender waits for a while in-
between consecutive up-switches, to give the receiver a chance to evaluate
whether the new rate can be sustained. This waiting period in-between
consecutive up-switches can be controlled with the ICM/INIT_UPSWITCH_WAIT
parameter when ECN is not used. For the channel aware mode of EVS Primary,
ICM/INIT_PARTIAL_REDUNDANCY_OFFSET_SEND and
INIT_PARTIAL_REDUNDANCY_OFFSET_RECV can be used to configure the initial
redundancy offset for the send and the receive directions respectively.
When ECN is used in the session, the ECN/INIT_WAIT and ECN/INIT_UPSWITCH_WAIT
parameters are used instead of the ICM/INIT_WAIT and ICM/INIT_UPSWITCH_WAIT
parameters, respectively.
N_INHIBIT can be used to limit the earliest time for the next transition,
after transition is temporarily disabled due to frequent transitions among a
limited number of states. Use of N_INHIBIT is suggested as a measure to avoid
unnecessary transtions during rapid fluctuations of transmission conditions.
It is left as the discretion of the implementation to handle RTCP-APP messages
received before the sender is allowed to transition again.
T_RESPONSE refers to the maximum period the receiver can tolerate, before
declaring that either the transmitted RTCP-APP message was lost or its
execution was denied by the sender. After the timer expires, the receiver may
retransmit the request or transmit a new request, or choose to be satisfied
with current status.
Adaptation state machines using above parameters collect the information on
transmission path by analyzing the packet reception process. Another, more
direct source of information can be provided by network nodes, such as eNodeB,
in the form of Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) to IP. A key benefit of
ECN is more refined initiation of adaptation in which the receiver can be
aware of incoming deterioration of transmission conditions even before any
packets are dropped by network node, i.e., as an early-warning scheme for
congestion.
STEPWISE_DOWNSWITCH can be used to control the path of bit-rate reduction,
i.e., whether to directly down-switch to ECN/MIN_RATE or to gradually down-
switch via several intermediate bit-rates specified in ECN/RATE_LIST. The
former path may be preferred when rapid reduction of the bit-rate is required
while the latter path may be employed for more graceful degradation of speech
quality.
To avoid premature up-switch before the congestion has been cleared, waiting
periods during which the sender is not allowed to increase the bit-rate can be
defined with ECN/CONGESTION_WAIT parameter. The ECN/CONGESTION_UPSWITCH_WAIT
parameter is used to prevent congestion from re-occuring during the upswitch
after the ECN/CONGESTION_WAIT period.
To align speech adaptation of the MTSI client in terminal with the purpose of
quality control or network management, not only the terminals, which might be
managed by different service providers, but also the behavior, such as
scheduling strategy or ECN-marking policy, of network nodes should be
considered in the construction of adaptation state machines. It is also
possible to program the terminals to adapt differently, as a means of
differentiating the quality of service.
With 3GPP MTSIMA MO, it is possible to shape a rough trajectory of the bit
rate over time-varying transmission conditions but the maximum and minimum bit
rates of speech codec are determined during session setup with mode-set, which
can be managed with RateSet leaf of 3GPP MTSINP MO (see clause 15).
Adaptation state machines designed to recover the once reduced bit or packet
rate at an earliest opportunity might be considered as an adaptation policy
oriented to service quality. However, such an aggressive up-switch before the
transmission conditions fully recover takes the risk of degrading the quality
or even backward transitions, i.e., the ping-pong effects. Such an optismistic
adaptation strategy might not necessarily result in higher quality but can
influence the service quality of other terminals sharing the same link. On the
other hand, adaptation state machines that increase the once reduced bit or
packet rate more conservatively are likely to avoid such situations but might
be late in the recovery of speech quality after the transmission conditions
are restored.
Even at similar total bit rates, bit stream consisting of a smaller number of
larger packets can be at a disadvantage during transmission over packet
networks or shared links, when the link quality deteriorates or the link
becomes congested, than bit stream consisting of a larger number of smaller
packets, since many types of schedulers installed in the network nodes base
their decisions on the size of packets such that lower priorities are assigned
to larger packets. RTCP_APP_REQ_RED, RTCP_APP_REQ_AGG, and RTCP_APP_CMR
specify detailed request for the bit rate and packetization. Bit-fields of
RTCP_APP_REQ_RED and RTCP_APP_REQ_AGG are restricted by parameters, such as
max-red and maxptime, which are negotiated during session setup.
### 17.3.2 Management of video adaptation
Compared with speech adaptation where the number of allowed bit rates from
speech encoder is limited and each encoded speech frame covers the same short
period, e.g., 20 ms, or contains the same number of bits when voice activity
is present, video adaptation should tolerate a higher level of uncertainty in
the control of the bit rate. Moreover, due to the structural dependence
between encoded video frames, from motion estimation and compensation,
packetization is not likely to be used as an opportunity for adaptation. This
dependence necessitates not only controling the bit rate but also putting an
end to error propagation with AVPF NACK or PLI.
Output bit rate from video encoder depends also on the scene being encoded and
even if maintaining a constant bit rate is intended, actual output bit rate is
likely to fluctuate around a target value. In the design of adaptation state
machines for video, this uncertainty needs to be compensated for, for example,
with additional implementation margin.
Encoded speech frames have a clear boundary in the bit stream and multiple
speech frames can be transported over an RTP packet. In contrast, an encoded
video frame, whose size depends on the bit rate, frame rate, and image size,
is typically far larger than an encoded speech frame. Multiple packets are
usually necessary to transport even a predicted frame, which is usually
smaller than an intra frame.
As in speech adaptation, basic information on transmission path can be
obtained from analyzing received packet stream. However, perceived video
quality can be more sensitive to PLR since the compression ratio of video is
typically higher than that of speech and even a minor level of packet loss can
initiate error propagation to the following predicted frames, rendering them
unrecognizable. For example, at comparable PLR values, speech quality can be
acceptable but video quality can be significantly damaged such that dropping
the media might be considered. Two parameters for PLR, MAX and LOW, and two
additional parameters for their durations, DURATION_MAX and DURATION_LOW, are
available for video adaptation.
PLB/LOST_PACKET and PLB/DURATION are also available for video but the
fundamental differences in the frame structure need to be taken into account
when the event of packet loss burst is defined for video.
INC_FBACK_MIN_INTERVAL and DEC_FBACK_MIN_INTERVAL can be used to control the
rate of adaptation and also the amount of signaling overhead. These two
minimum intervals are provided separately since the minimum interval between
the feedback messages to decrease the bit rate typically needs to be shorter
than the one to increase the bit rate. The urgency of rate-decreasing
conditions generally requires shorter minimum feedback intervals.
Target bit rate for video is determined during session setup and can be
considered as the maximum bit rate to be used during session, which can be
configured with the Bandwidth leaf of 3GPP MTSINP MO. On the other hand,
BIT_RATE can be used to set a lower threshold for the bit rate. **Whether
MIN_QUALITY/** BIT_RATE/**ABSOLUTE or MIN_QUALITY/** BIT_RATE/**RELATIVE is to
be used is left as the discretion of the implementation or service provider.
For example, capability of setting a fixed minimum bit rate can be necessary
when the lowest quality of MTSI is required to be comparable to the quality of
3G-324M, whose bit rate for video is in general set to 47 \~ 49 kbps.** If
both MIN_QUALITY/BIT_RATE/ABSOLUTE and MIN_QUALITY/BIT_RATE/RELATIVE are set,
the larger of these two shall be used as the minimum bit rate.
In the case of speech adaptation, the MTSI client in terminal limits the
initial codec mode (ICM) to a lower mode than the maximum mode negotiated,
until at least one frame block or an RTCP message is received with rate
control information **(see clause 7.5).** This policy is recommended to avoid
congestion during initial phase of session when the information on
transmission path is known to neither the sender nor the receiver.
INITIAL_CODEC_RATE can be used for video with similar objectives as that of
ICM, i.e., a warming-up process in the beginning of session. Once the session
starts and few packets are lost during delivery, the receiver will attempt to
increase the bit rate by transmitting TMMBR messages requesting higher bit
rates until the negotiated value is reached. However, low INITIAL_CODEC_RATE
can reduce the video quality at session setup when the transmission path is
free of congestion.
The maximum bit rate allowed for video communication in a session depends on
the outcome of the SDP offer-answer negotiation. For inter-working with
3G-324M it is likely that the bit rate is limited to 47 \~ 49 kbps while for
high-quality video communication it is foreseen that bit rates in the order of
several hundred kbps might be used. This can be challenging when setting the
ECN/MIN_RATE parameter since the configuration of the MTSI client in terminal
parameters occurs rarely while the maximum allowed bit rate used for video may
vary from session to session.
Two parameters, ECN/MIN_RATE/ABSOLUTE and ECN/MIN_RATE/RELATIVE, are therefore
provided to enable better control of the video rate adaptation algorithm. The
ECN/MIN_RATE/RELATIVE parameter is provided to limit the bit range variations
during a session to avoid large quality variations. The ECN/MIN_RATE/ABSOLUTE
parameter is provided to avoid reducing the bit rate to an unacceptably low
quality level.
FRAME_RATE can be used to set a lower threshold for the frame rate. As the bit
rate is controlled during adaptation between two limits, the frame rate also
needs to be controlled between the limits while **maintaining a balance
between spatial quality and temporal resolution (see clause 10.3). As the
increase in codec profile/level can result in an abrupt increase of the
maximum image size, e.g., from QCIF to CIF, so can quadruple the maximum frame
rate, with a fixed image size. With "imageattr" attribute, it is possible that
image sizes whose maximum frame rates are unspecified by codec profile/level,
such as 272x224, can be negotiated (see clause A.4). In this case, the maximum
frame rate is determined as the maximum value at the maximum image size
supported by the profile/level negotiated. Whether**
MIN_QUALITY/FRAME_RATE/**ABSOLUTE or** MIN_QUALITY/FRAME_RATE/**RELATIVE is
used to specify the lower threshold of the frame rate is left as the
discretion of the implementation or service provider.** If both are set, the
larger of these two shall be used as the minimum frame rate.
RTP_GAP can be used to set the maximum interval between received packets
before the receiver considers repairing actions. During periods of severe
congestion or packet loss, the receiver may not receive packets for an
unexpectedly long period. Observing such gaps in the reception of packets can
be used by the receiver to request the sender to decrease the bit or packet
rate. In the case of severe packet loss, this gap can be detected before any
other observations are made and thus allows for faster reaction, while
detection of packet loss requires reception of at least one packet after the
loss.
However, estimating such gaps in the arrival of packets can be challenging
because video encoder may not always output packets at regular intervals and
typical scheduling strategy of network node, especially in the downlink, can
cause jitter in the delivery of video packets. Therefore, it is recommended
that RTP_GAP is set conservatively and the measured gap is based on a moving
average estimate of the frame period observed by the receiver. The timestamps
of the received packets allow the receiver to estimate the frame period based
on the past a few received video frames. Since typical video encoders are not
likely to abruptly change their encoding frame rates, this estimate can serve
as a fairly reliable basis for detecting the gaps in the transport of video
packets.
**Leaf nodes for** luminance quantization parameter, **H263, MPEG4, and H264,
can be used to set a lower threshold for the image clarity to be maintained.
Target range of the quantization parameters depends on the video codec
negotiated**.
If the MTSI client in terminal cannot maintain the bit rate or the frame rate
higher than the lower thresholds, or cannot maintain the quantization
parameter lower than the higher threshold, the video stream might be put on
hold, dropped, or the session might be ended, depending on the criteria for
service quality or policy for network management, with HOLD_DROP_END.
RAMP_UP_RATE and RAMP_DOWN_RATE can be used to control how fast the sender
changes its target bit rate from its current target value to the value
indicated in the most recently received TMMBR message, when the bit rate is
being increased and decreased respectively. As with INC_FBACK_MIN_INTERVAL and
DEC_FBACK_MIN_INTERVAL, rates for ramping up and down need to be different, as
rapid ramping down is usually necessary whereas rapid ramping up is
undesirable as it can cause sudden congestion in the transmission path.
DECONGEST_TIME can be used to control the time spent in resolving the
congestion of transmission path. Smaller values of this parameter can result
in faster reduction of the bit rate while larger values can be used for slower
decongestion. If the situation at the receiver does not improve at the end of
initial decongesting, another round of decongestion can be attempted, or the
video stream can be dropped or put on hold.
From received packets, video frames are typically reconstructed to YUV format,
converted to formats such as RGB, and stored in the frame buffer, before being
fed to the display for visual presentation. TARGET_PLAYOUT_MARGIN_HI and
TARGET_PLAYOUT_MARGIN_MIN can be used to maintain appropriate playout margin,
defined as the interval between packet arrival and its properly scheduled
playout. Duration of sliding window over which the interval is observed and
computed can be controlled with TP_DURATION_HI and TP_DURATION_MIN.
In general, video should be encoded, packetized, transmitted, de-packetized,
decoded, and, played out within a total delay target. In addition, processing
of video should be appropriately synchronized to that of speech. If the
estimated playout margin exceeds TARGET_PLAYOUT_MARGIN_HI, it is considered
that video packets are arriving too early and there remains room for higher
bit rate in the transmission path. Therefore the receiver may signal the
sender to increase the bit rate with TMMBR messages. If the estimated playout
margin falls below TARGET_PLAYOUT_MARGIN_MIN, it is considered that video
packets are arriving too late and current transmission path cannot sustain the
bit rate. Therefore the receiver should signal the sender to reduce the bit
rate to enable earlier arrival of video packets.
X_PERCENTILE can be used to control the target playout margin but the packet
arrival distribution is left to the discretion of the implementation, which
might be implemented as statistical models or empirical data.
# 18 MTSI client in terminal using fixed access
## 18.1 General
This clause 18 applies to an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access.
The functional components of an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access are
the same as described in clause 4.2 except that another Layer 2 technology may
be used instead of the 3GPP L2 data link.
## 18.2 Media codecs
### 18.2.1 General
Media codecs for speech and video are specified in TS 181 005 [98]. Additional
requirements and recommendations are included below.
### 18.2.2 Speech
#### 18.2.2.1 Speech codecs
MTSI clients in terminal using fixed access supporting AMR, AMR-WB or EVS
shall follow clause 5.2.1.
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supporting G.711 [77] shall
support either A-law PCM or μ-law PCM and should support both.
MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supporting G.722 shall use the mode
operation 1 at 64 kbps as specified in ITU-T Recommendation G.722 [78] when
G.722 is used. The bitstream ordering shall be in chronological order with
Most Significant Bit (MSB) first.
MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supporting EVRC, EVRC-B, and /or
EVRC-WB shall follow 3GPP2 C.S0014-E v1.0 [99] when any of these codecs are
used.
Encoding of DTMF is described in Annex G.
#### 18.2.2.2 Error concealment procedures
Error concealment procedures shall be used to reduce the quality degradation
of the reconstructed speech when one or more erroneous/lost speech or lost
Silence Descriptor (SID) frames are received.
For G.722, it is recommended to use Appendix III or Appendix IV of ITU-T
Recommendation G.722 [78].
NOTE: Appendices III and IV meet the same quality requirements but with two
different quality/complexity trade-offs:
\- Appendix III of ITU-T Recommendation G.722 [78] aims at maximizing the
robustness at a price of additional complexity.
\- Appendix IV of ITU-T Recommendation G.722 [78] offers an optimized
complexity/quality trade off with almost no additional complexity compared
with G.722 normal decoding (+0.07 WMOPS).
If another error concealment procedure is used it shall have equivalent or
better performance than Appendix III or Appendix IV.
For G.711, it is recommended to use Appendix I of ITU-T Recommendation G.711
[77]. If another error concealment procedure is used, it shall have equivalent
or better performance than Appendix I of ITU-T Recommendation G.711.
For G.729, the error concealment procedure shall be used as specified in the
Main Body of ITU-T Recommendation G.729 [100].
For G.729.1, the error concealment procedure shall be used as specified in the
ITU-T Recommendation G.729.1 [101].
#### 18.2.2.3 Source controlled rate operation
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supporting AMR, AMR-WB or EVS
shall support source controlled rate operation in accordance with clause
5.2.1.
For an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supporting other codecs than
AMR, AMR-WB or EVS the following recommendations apply:
\- Source controlled rate operation for G.729 should be supported according to
Annex B of ITU-T G.729 [100].
\- Source controlled rate operation for G.729.1 should be supported according
to Annex C and Annex F of ITU-T G.729.1 [101]. Annex C specifies a
discontinuous transmission (DTX) and comfort noise generation for G.729.1.
Annex F specified the voice activity detector (VAD) to be used together with
the DTX/CNG scheme of Annex C to provide the complete functionality of the
discontinuous transmission system.
\- Source controlled rate operation for G.711 should be supported according to
Appendix 2 of ITU-T G.711 [77].
\- No source controlled rate operation has been standardized for G.722.
NOTE 1: Use of source controlled rate operation is optional. Source controlled
rate operation is known to degrade the speech quality, especially in noisy
environments or with background music, and is not needed when both MTSI client
in terminals are using fixed access and when the bandwidth is sufficient to
ensure best possible voice quality.
NOTE 2: Apart from source controlled rate operation (VAD/DTX) specified in
clause 4.19 of 3GPP2 C.S0014-E [99] and in 3GPP2 C.S0076 v1.0 [102], EVRC,
EVRC-B, and EVRC-WB can dynamically vary the source coding bit-rate for active
speech to achieve a targeted active speech average data rate as specified in
3GPP2 C.S0014-E.
### 18.2.3 Video
MTSI clients in terminals using fixed access offering video communication
shall support the video codecs as defined in clause 5.2.2.
NOTE: The video codecs recommended in TS 181 005 [98] are H.263 profile 0 and
H.264 Baseline Profile without any constraint on the levels. For 3GPP MTSI
clients in terminal using 3GPP access, only H.264 is specified in the present
document but with a different profile: the Constrained Baseline Profile (CBP)
for which the Level 1.2 is mandatory and Level 3.1 is recommended.
The Baseline Profile and the Constrained Baseline Profile are very close but
not compatible. The Baseline Profile includes all features that are supported
in the Constrained Baseline Profile but some limited features of the Baseline
Profile are not supported in the Constrained Baseline Profile.
### 18.2.4 Real-time text
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access and offering real-time text
shall support real-time text as defined in clause 5.2.3.
## 18.3 Media configuration
### 18.3.1 General
The general clause on media configuration (clause 6.1) applies to an MTSI
client in terminal using fixed access.
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access and supporting RTP/AVPF shall do
RTP profile negotiation as defined in clause 6.2.1a.
The support for Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is optional for an MTSI
client in terminal using fixed access. ECN may be used to perform rate
adaptation for speech and video when at least one multi-rate or rate-adaptive
codec is supported. If ECN is supported then this shall be done in accordance
with the requirements and recommendations specified in clause 6 and in clause
7.3 for RTCP based adaptation.
NOTE: It is beneficial if the MTSI client in terminal using fixed access
supports ECN, even if the fixed network is not expected to support or use ECN
for RTP. This enables using ECN between fixed and mobile clients when the same
codecs are supported end-to-end.
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access and supporting ECN should
negotiate ECN usage when the SDP offer includes at least one multi-rate or
rate-adaptive codec, see clause 6.2.2 for speech and clause 6.2.3.2 for video.
If only fixed-rate codecs are included in the SDP offer for a media type then
ECN shall not be negotiated for that media type.
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access and supporting ECN may accept
using ECN when a multi-rate or rate-adaptive codec is accepted, see clause
6.2.2 for speech and clause 6.2.3.2 for video.
### 18.3.2 Session setup procedures
#### 18.3.2.1 General
The general clause on session set up procedures (clause 6.2.1) applies to the
MTSI client in terminal using fixed access.
If an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supports AVPF for a media
type then it shall also support the complete SDPCapNeg framework, RFC 5939
[69], for that media type in order to negotiate the RTP profiles.
#### 18.3.2.2 Speech
If an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supports AMR and/or AMR-WB
and/or EVS, then clause 6.2.2 applies for session set up.
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access shall support RTP/AVP. When at
least one multi-rate codec is supported (AMR, AMR-WB, EVS or G.729.1) then
RTP/AVPF should be supported to allow for end-to-end rate adaptation.
If an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supports AMR and/or AMR-WB,
or EVS, then clause 6.2.2.2 applies for generating SDP offers for AMR-NB, AMR-
WB and EVS.
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supporting both A-law PCM and
μ-law PCM shall offer both variants when sending an SDP offer for G.711.
When an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supports EVRC-B or EVRC-WB,
then clauses 14-18 of RFC 5188 [103] apply when generating SDP offers and
answers for EVRC-B and EVRC-WB.
If an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supports G.729.1 then it also
supports G.729 and should offer both G.729.1 and G.729 when sending an SDP
offer.
An MTSI client in terminal offering G.729 with source controlled rate
operation shall use the parameter "annexb" according to RFC 4855 [107].
The following codec preference order applies for the SDP offer in the session
negotiation:
\- If AMR-WB is offered it shall be listed first in the codec list (in order
of preference, the first codec being preferred).
\- If both narrowband codecs and wideband codecs are offered, wideband codecs
shall be listed first in the codec list.
When sending the SDP answer, if a wide-band speech session is possible, then
selection of narrow-band speech should be avoided whenever possible, unless
another preference order is indicated in the SDP offer.
Session setup for sessions including speech and DTMF events is described in
Annex G.
#### 18.3.2.3 Video
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access and supporting video shall
support RTP/AVP and shall support RTP/AVPF.
If an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supports video, then clause
6.2.3 applies for the video session set up.
#### 18.3.2.4 Text
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access and offering text shall follow
clause 6.2.4.
#### 18.3.2.5 Bandwidth negotiation
The general clause 6.2.5.1 related to the use of Application Specific (AS)
bandwidth modifier applies also to the MTSI client in terminal using fixed
access.
If an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supports AMR and/or AMR-WB
and/or EVS, then clause 6.2.5.2 applies for the bandwidth negotiation for
these codecs.
If an MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supports video, then clause
6.2.5.3 applies for the bandwidth negotiation.
When the SDP offer includes multiple codecs then the bandwidth indicated with
b=AS shall be set based on the codec that requires the highest bandwidth.
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access should include the 'a=bw-info'
attribute (see clause 19) in the SDP offer for speech and video media types
and should include the attribute for other media types, as described in clause
6.2.5.1. For AMR, AMR-WB or EVS, the setting of the bandwidth properties are
defined in clause 6.2.5.2 and Annex K.
### 18.3.3 Session control procedures
The clause 6.3 on session set up procedures applies also to an MTSI client in
terminal that uses fixed access.
## 18.4 Data transport
### 18.4.1 General
The clauses data transport general (7.1) and RTCP usage (7.3.1) apply also to
the MTSI client in terminal using fixed access.
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access shall transport real-time media
using RTP (RFC 3550 [9]) over UDP (RFC 0768 [39]). See clause 18.3.2.2,
18.3.2.3 and 18.3.2.4 for requirements on RTP/AVP and RTP/AVPF for speech,
video and text, respectively.
The support of AVPF requires an MTSI client in terminal to implement the RTCP
transmission rules, the signalling mechanism for SDP and the feedback messages
explicitly mentioned in the present document.
For a given RTP based media stream, the MTSI client in terminal shall use the
same port number for sending and receiving RTP packets. This facilitates
interworking with fixed/broadband access. However, the MTSI client shall
accept RTP packets that are not received from the same remote port where RTP
packets are sent by the MTSI client.
### 18.4.2 Packetization
For G.711 both 10 ms and 20 ms frame length shall be supported, and 20 ms
frame length shall be used unless another packetization is negotiated. The
terminal shall offer to receive 20 ms frame length packetization.
For G.722, 20 ms frame length shall be supported.
The default packetization time for the codecs used in the MTSI client in
terminal using fixed access shall be 20 ms (1 non-redundant speech frame per
RTP packet). The packetization could change as a result of adaptation by using
frame aggregation when adapting to packet rate limited operating conditions,
see also clause 18.7.
Packetization time shall be indicated using the a=ptime SDP attribute.
An MTSI clients in terminal using fixed access shall support encapsulating up
to 4 non-redundant speech frames into the RTP packets and 12 speech frames in
total if redundancy is used (maxptime = 240).
### 18.4.3 RTP payload format
For each of the following codecs the payload formats are defined in:
\- For AMR and/or AMR-WB, or EVS as specified in clause 7.4.2.
\- For G.729.1 as specified in RFC 4749 [104], and as specified in RFC 5459
[105] when DTX is used.
\- For EVRC and EVRC-B as specified in RFC 4788 [106].
\- For EVRC-WB as specified in RFC 5188 [103].
\- For DTMF events is described in Annex G.
The RTP payload types for G.711, G.729, G.722 shall be supported as specified
in Section 6, Table 4 of RFC 3551 [10].
The following payload types should be used for G.711, G.729 and G.722:
Table 18.4.3-1: Recommended payload type numbers
Codec Payload Type
* * *
G.711 A-law PT= 8 G.711 μ-law PT= 0 G.729 PT= 18 G.722 PT=9
For other codecs, dynamic payload types shall be used.
## 18.5 Jitter buffer management
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access shall be able to handle delay
jitter in order to minimize the speech quality degradation due to jitter
(jitter induced frame losses) while limiting the additional end to end delay
due to jitter buffering time.
The jitter buffer management (JBM) shall comply with the functional
requirements defined in clause 8.2.2 and with the minimum performance
requirements defined in clause 8.2.3.
NOTE: The delay and error profiles defined in clause 8.2.3.2.3 were derived
for mobile access but they were selected to span the different jitter and
packet loss conditions that may occur in different types of networks and in
different combination of networks. For fixed-mobile interworking the jitter
may be small and packet loss rate may be low in the fixed part of the path,
but the jitter may be large and the packet loss rate may be fairly high in the
mobile part of the path. This can give end-to-end jitter and packet loss
characteristics that are similar to the characteristics found in these
profiles. The JBM therefore needs to handle these profiles to support end-to-
end fixed-mobile interworking.
## 18.6 Packet-loss handling
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access may use redundancy to handle
operating conditions with high packet loss rates. When redundancy is supported
then this shall be done in accordance with the requirements and
recommendations defined in clause 9.
When redundancy is used then the multi-rate or rate-adaptive capabilities of
the codec should be used to avoid increasing the load in the network.
Redundancy shall be used for fixed-rate codecs only when permitted by the
allocated bandwidth.
NOTE: It is beneficial if the MTSI client in terminal using fixed access
supports redundancy since this enables using such solutions end-to-end between
fixed and mobile clients, at least when the same codecs are supported end-to-
end.
## 18.7 Adaptation
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access supporting AMR and/or AMR-WB for
speech or supporting video should support adaptation as described in clause 10
for speech and video, respectively.
Frame aggregation and redundancy should be supported also for fixed-rate
codecs.
The media bit rate adaptation for G.729.1 should use the same principles as
described for AMR and AMR-WB in clause 10.2. For example, if G.729.1 is used
at a bit rates up to 32 kbps, the adaptation may be configured to reduce the
media bit-rate to 8 kbps when ECN-CE is detected.
## 18.8 Front-end handling
For terminals only supporting fixed access, performance requirements for
terminal acoustics and test methods are specified in ETSI TS 103 737 [109],
ETSI TS 103 738 [110], ETSI TS 103 739 [111], ETSI TS 103 740 [112], ETSI ES
202 737 [113], ETSI ES 202 738 [114], ETSI ES 202 739 [115], ETSI ES 202 740
[116] and for DECT terminals in ETSI specifications EN 300 175-8 [117] and EN
300 176-2 [118].
Other terminals supporting fixed and 3GPP access shall meet or exceed the
minimum performance requirements on the acoustic characteristics of 3G
terminals specified in 3GPP TS 26.131 [35] in order to harmonize the acoustic
front-end.
## 18.9 Supplementary services
An MTSI client in terminal using fixed access shall support media handling for
supplementary services as defined in clause 14, except that the codecs are
defined in clause 18.2 and the data transport is defined in clause 18.4.
# 19 Additional bandwidth information
## 19.1 General
This clause describes additional bandwidth properties that can be used when
the existing bandwidth modifiers (b=AS, etc) give insufficient information.
The additional information can be used to, for example (but not limited to):
align the resource allocation end-to-end; align the bearer setup in different
networks; or to assist how the MTSI clients should adapt in case of degraded
operating conditions. The bandwidth properties are defined in clause 19.2.
A new SDP attribute 'a=bw-info' is defined in clause 19.3 and can be used to
negotiate the additional bandwidth properties end-to-end. The SDP attribute
allows for future extensions.
The IANA registration information on the new SDP attribute is provided in
Annex M.6.
## 19.2 Bandwidth properties
### 19.2.1 General description
This clause defines in total seven bandwidth properties, which can be used
both for sending and receiving direction. When the Maximum Supported Bandwidth
property is defined for the receiving direction then this is semantically very
similar to the b=AS parameter.
Four bandwidth properties are defined to describe different transport
bandwidths:
\- Maximum Supported Bandwidth
\- Maximum Desired Bandwidth
\- Minimum Desired Bandwidth
\- Minimum Supported Bandwidth
These bandwidth properties shall include the IP, UDP and RTP overhead.
NOTE: Corresponding bandwidth parameters excluding IP, UDP and RTP overhead
can be defined in the future but are not included here.
Since the above bandwidth properties include the IP, UDP and RTP overhead, the
following bandwidth properties are defined to assist the re-calculation of the
above bandwidth properties, e.g. when a MGW does conversion between different
IP versions and therefore need to re-calculate these values:
\- IP version
\- Maximum packet rate
\- Minimum packet rate
Detailed descriptions for these bandwidth properties are given in the
following sub-sections.
The motivations for defining these properties are:
\- The best compromise between quality and network utilization is reached when
the media uses bandwidths from the Minimum Desired Bandwidth up to the Maximum
Desired Bandwidth, which is therefore the most preferred bandwidth range. The
higher end of this range should preferably be used for most sessions. When
bitrate adaptation is needed due to degraded operating conditions, it may
require changing the bandwidth down towards the Minimum Desired Bandwidth.
\- Bandwidths below the Minimum Desired Bandwidth, down to the Minimum
Supported Bandwidth, may be used during poor operating conditions, although
this should happen rarely. If the operating conditions are so poor that not
even media using Minimum Supported Bandwidth can be maintained then the media
may be stopped or the session may be closed.
\- Bandwidths above the Maximum Desired Bandwidth, up to the Maximum Supported
Bandwidth, can be used to provide room for redundancy so that the media may
survive during very bad operating conditions and when bandwidth reduction
alone is unable to provide sufficient quality. This range should be used
rarely.
NOTE: Increasing the bandwidth during bad operating conditions is an
exception. Normally, the end-points ought to reduce the bandwidth. However,
there are cases when it is not possible to reduce the bandwidth. For example,
when AMR 4.75 kbps is used then the encoding bitrate cannot be reduced any
further. It is then possible to use frame aggregation to reduce the IP/UDP/RTP
overhead. However, if the limitation is in the RAN, where ROHC is used, then
this will have limited effect, possibly even no effect at all. In this case,
the only remaining option to improve the probability that speech reaches the
receiving end-point is to allow the end-points to use redundancy, even if this
means using a higher bandwidth. Otherwise, it is likely that the session will
be terminated prematurely. This specification therefore allows for using up to
300% redundancy, as described in clause 9.2.1.
This means that the following relationships apply:
\- Minimum Supported Bandwidth ≤ Minimum Desired Bandwidth
\- Minimum Desired Bandwidth ≤ Maximum Desired Bandwidth
\- Maximum Desired Bandwidth ≤ Maximum Supported Bandwidth
### 19.2.2 Maximum Supported Bandwidth
**Definition:**
Identifies the highest bandwidth that can be used in the session during any
operating conditions (including redundancy).
Should be used to set MBR.
Should also be used to set GBR for MBR=GBR bearers.
The unit for this bandwidth property shall be kbps.
**Usage during the session:**
The additional bandwidth for redundancy should only be used if adapting the
bitrate to lower values, down to the Minimum Supported Bandwidth, fails to
provide sufficient quality.
**Quality aspects:**
When additional bandwidth is allocated for redundancy, the resilience against
losses should be improved. It should however be expected that the end-to-end
delay will be longer than for the normal operating range.
### 19.2.3 Maximum Desired Bandwidth
**Definition:**
Identifies the highest bandwidth that should be used in most cases during
normal operating conditions. This normally corresponds to the maximum bitrate
allowed for the encoding.
The unit for this bandwidth property shall be kbps.
**Usage during the session:**
The adaptation should ensure that bandwidths up to the Maximum Desired
Bandwidth are used whenever possible.
**Quality aspects:**
Using bandwidths in the higher end of the Minimum Desired Bandwidth \~ Maximum
Desired Bandwidth range should give the intended encoding quality and end-to-
end delay.
### 19.2.4 Minimum Desired Bandwidth
**Definition:**
Identifies the lowest bandwidth that should be used in the session during
relatively normal or slightly degraded operating conditions.
Used for setting GBR for MBR>GBR bearers.
The unit for this bandwidth property shall be kbps.
**Usage during the session:**
Bandwidths in the lower end of the Minimum Desired Bandwidth \~ Maximum
Desired Bandwidth should be used less frequently, mainly during periods with
high load and/or degraded operating conditions.
The bandwidth used by media can be lower than the Minimum Desired Bandwidth,
for example during DTX periods or lower rate operation of Source-Controlled
Variable Bit Rate modes, e.g. EVS 5.9 VBR, for speech or when DTMF is being
transmitted instead of speech.
**Quality aspects:**
Using bandwidths in the lower end of this range can give slightly reduced
encoding quality but should not give increased end-to-end delay.
For video, this bandwidth should be selected such that the video is still
relatively smooth.
### 19.2.5 Minimum Supported Bandwidth
**Definition:**
Identifies the lowest bandwidth that may be used in the session during
exceptional operating conditions.
The unit for this bandwidth property shall be kbps.
**Usage during the session:**
Bandwidths below the Minimum Desired Bandwidth, down to the Minimum Supported
Bandwidth, should be used quite rarely, mainly for severely degraded operating
conditions.
If the operating conditions are so poor that not even Minimum Supported
Bandwidth can be maintained then the session can be terminated.
The bandwidth used by media can deliberately be lower than the Minimum
Supported Bandwidth, for example during DTX periods or lower rate operation of
Source-Controlled Variable Bit Rate modes, e.g. EVS 5.9 VBR, for speech or
when DTMF is being transmitted instead of speech. This is not to be considered
a violation of the bandwidth parameter.
**Quality aspects:**
It can be expected that the encoding quality is reduced for these bandwidths
and also that the end-to-end delay is increased.
### 19.2.6 IP version
**Definition:**
Identifies the IP version used for the calculation of the bandwidth
properties.
This bandwidth property shall have the numerical values 4 or 6.
**Usage during the session:**
It may happen that gateways performing IPv4-IPv6 conversion re-calculate the
bandwidth modifiers, e.g. b=AS, while leaving the bandwidths indicated with
the 'a=bw-info' attribute unchaged. It is therefore beneficial to indicate
which IP version that was assumed when the bandwidth properties were
calculated.
The bandwidth properties may be calculated either using IPv4 and/or IPv6. The
SDP may include bandwidth properties for both IPv4 and IPv6 in which case
different attribute lines are used for the different IP versions and the IP
version needs to be indicated
If no IP version is included for any of the 'a=bw-info' lines related to a
certain payload type and direction then IPv6 is assumed for all bandwidth
properties related to the same direction and payload type, on all of the
related 'a=bw-info' lines.
### 19.2.7 Maximum Packet Rate
**Definition:**
Identifies the maximum packet rate assumed when calculating the bandwidth
properties.
The unit for this bandwidth property shall be packets per second.
**Usage during the session:**
The overhead when transmitting media using IP/UDP/RTP depends on the packet
rate, especially for media using a relatively low bit-rate media, e.g. speech.
When IPv4-IPv6 conversion is performed and when the bandwidth properties are
re-calculated for the 'a=bw-info' attribute, it is necessary to know which
packet rate that was assumed when the bandwidth properties were originally
calculated.
The maximum packet rate is used when re-calculating the Maximum Supported
Bandwidth, Maximum Desired Bandwidth and Minimum Desired Bandwidth bandwidth
properties.
### 19.2.8 Minimum Packet Rate
**Definition:**
Identifies the minimum packet rate assumed when calculating the bandwidth
properties.
The unit for this bandwidth property shall be packets per second.
**Usage during the session:**
The overhead when transmitting media using IP/UDP/RTP depends on the packet
rate, especially for media using a relatively low bit-rate media, e.g. speech.
When IPv4-IPv6 conversion is performed and when the bandwidth properties are
re-calculated for the 'a=bw-info' attribute, it is necessary to know which
packet rate that was assumed when the bandwidth properties were originally
calculated.
The minimum packet rate is used when re-calculating the Minimum Supported
Bandwidth bandwidth property.
## 19.3 SDP attribute
### 19.3.1 Definition
The syntax for the SDP attribute is:
> a=bw-info:\ \ \=\; ...; \ prop-N>=\
where:
> \ is the definition of the RTP payload type(s) that the bandwidth
> information applies to. This can be a single value, a comma-separated list
> of RTP payload type numbers, or a wild card ('*').
>
> \ is either 'send' or 'recv'. The direction shall be defined for
> each 'a=bw-info' line.
>
> \=\ define the bandwidth property and the related
> bandwidth value(s).
The new attribute is designed to allow for future extensibility.
### 19.3.2 SDP grammar
The ABNF RFC 5234 [153] for this attribute is the following:
> bw-attrib = \"a=bw-info:\" pt-def SP direction SP bw-def *(\";\" [SP] bw-
> def)
>
> pt-def = \"*\" / pt-val *(\",\" pt-val)
>
> pt-val = 1*3DIGIT
>
> direction = \"send\" / \"recv\" / \"sendrecv\" / direction-ext
>
> direction-ext = 1*VCHAR
>
> bw-def = bw-name \"=\" bw-val-def
>
> bw-name = 1*VCHAR ; Label defining the bandwitdh property
>
> bw-val-def = zero-based-int-or-real / bw-val-def-ext ; Bandwidth value for
> the bandwidth property
>
> bw-val-def-ext = zero-based-int-or-real *(\":\" zero-based-int-or-real)
>
> ; Extension possibility
>
> ; DIGIT as defined by IETF RFC 4566
>
> ; zero-based-int-or-real as defined by IETF RFC 8866
The \'a=bw-info\' attribute defines the following possible directionalities
for the bandwidth. Three directionalities are defined here:
\- send: In the send direction for SDP Offer/Answer agent providing the SDP or
in case of declarative use in relation to the device that is being configured
by the SDP.
\- recv: In the receiving direction for the SDP Offer/Answer agent providing
the SDP or in case of declarative use in relation to the device that is being
configured by the SDP.
\- sendrecv: In both the send and receiving directions for the SDP
Offer/Answer agent providing the SDP or in case of declarative use in relation
to the device that is being configured by the SDP.
Additional directionalities may be defined in the future, if needed. If an
'a=bw-info' line is received with an unknown directionality then the entire
'a=bw-info' line is ignored.
The directionality shall be specified when the 'a=bw-info' attribute is used.
Only one directionality can be specified on each 'a=bw-info' line.
It is allowed to define different bandwidth properties on different attribute
lines for the same payload type and direction. However, special care should be
taken to avoid conflicting definitions. Therefore, a single bandwidth property
shall not be included in several attribute lines applicable to the same
payload type, direction and IP version. For example, if bandwidth property
'MaxSupBw' is defined for payload number 96 on one 'a=bw-info' line for
direction 'send' and IPv6, then 'MaxSupBw' cannot be defined on another
\'a=bw-info\' line for the same payload type number, direction and IP version.
However, for example, 'MaxSupBw' and 'MinSupBw' may be defined in different
'a=bw-info' lines, even for the same payload type, direction and IP version.
This applies also when a wild card is used for the payload type number.
The 'bw-name' is a character string describing the name (or label) used for
the bandwidth property that is defined. Four bandwidth property names are
defined here for indicating bandwidth needs:
\- MaxSupBw: The Maximum Supported Bandwidth, see clause 19.2.2. The Maximum
Supported Bandwidth may be a real value.
\- MaxDesBw: The Maximum Desired Bandwidth, see clause 19.2.3. The Maximum
Desired Bandwidth may be a real value.
\- MinDesBw: The Minimum Desired Bandwidth, see clause 19.2.4. The Maximum
Desired Bandwidth may be a real value.
\- MinSupBw: The Minimum Supported Bandwidth, see clause 19.2.5. The Maximum
Supported Bandwidth may be a real value.
These bandwidth properties include IP/UDP/RTP overhead but not RTCP bandwidth,
similar to b=AS. This means that the Maximum Supported Bandwidth for the
receiving direction corresponds to the b=AS value used in an SDP offer-answer
negotiation.
The following bandwidth property names are also defined:
\- IpVer: The IP version, see clause 19.2.6. Allowed values are 4 and 6 for
IPv4 and IPv6, respectively. If the IP version is not indicated then IPv6 is
assumed.
\- MaxPRate: The Maximum Packet Rate, see clause 19.2.7. The maximum packet
rate may be a real value.
\- MinPRate: The Minimum Packet Rate, see clause 19.2.8. The minimum packet
rate may be a real value.
Unknown bandwidth property names shall be ignored, and shall not be included
in an answer if received in an offer. A received SDP may include 'a=bw-info'
lines containing both known and unknown bandwidth properties. Ignoring unknown
bandwidth properties shall not cause known bandwidth properties to be ignored.
### 19.3.3 Declarative use
In declarative usage the SDP attribute is interpreted from the perspective of
the end-point being configured by the particular SDP. An interpreter may
ignore \'a=bw-info\' attribute lines that contain only unknown payload
numbers.
### 19.3.4 Usage in offer/answer
The offer/answer negotiation is performed for each 'a=bw-info' attribute line,
payload type, direction and bandwidth property individually.
An offerer may use the \'a=bw-info\' attribute line for some or all of the
offered payload types. The offerer may use the wild card to describe that a
bandwidth property applies to all payload types included in the offer.
Different bandwidth properties may be defined on different 'a=bw-info'
attribute lines, even for the same payload type (including wild card) and
directionality. However, the offerer shall ensure that there is no
contradicting information. Therefore, a bandwidth property shall not occur on
multiple 'a=bw-info' lines for the same payload type (including wild card),
direction and IP version.
An answerer may remove the \'a=bw-info\' attribute line(s) for the payload
types where it was used in the SDP offer. If \'a=bw-info\' is included in the
SDP offer, the answerer may add additional \'a=bw-info\' lines for payload
types it has added in the SDP answer compared to the SDP offer. An answerer
may also remove or add individual bandwidth properties.
The SDP may include an offer for some of the defined bandwidth properties
without including an offer for other defined bandwidth properties, in which
case the values of the omitted properties are undefined, but may still be
implicitly limited by the general property equalities defined in clause
19.2.1.
An offer may include any defined directionality in the 'a=bw-info'
attribute(e.g. 'send', 'recv' or 'sendrecv') regardless of the directional
attribute defined for the media stream ('a=sendrecv', 'a=sendonly',
'a=recvonly' or 'a=inactive').
An agent understanding the \'a=bw-info\' attribute and answering to an offer
including the \'a=bw-info\' attribute should include the attribute in the
answer for all payload types for which it was offered.
If an answerer has received \'a=bw-info\' in an SDP offer with a certain set
of bandwidth properties, and would like to add additional bandwidth
properties, possibly using other directionality, then it may do so by adding
such definitions in the SDP answer.
An agent may also divide an \'a=bw-info\' line into several \'a=bw-info\'
lines. One example is when the SDP offer included an \'a=bw-info\' lines
listing several different RTP payload types, or using a wild card. The agent
may then divide the attribute line with the payload type list into several
attribute lines with payload type lists consisting of fewer payload type
numbers or even several attribute lines with only a single payload type number
each. Another example is separating a list of bandwidth properties from a
single 'a=bw-info' line onto multiple 'a=bw-info' lines.
An agent may also merge several 'a=bw-info' offers into fewer offers or even a
single offer.
An agent responding to an \'a=bw-info\' offer will need to consider the
directionalities and reverse them in the answer when responding to media
streams using unicast.
If the answerer removes one or several RTP Payload Types from the SDP when
creating the SDP answer then the corresponding payload type numbers should be
removed from the \'a=bw-info\' lines as well.
An agent accepting an offer with the 'a=bw-info' attribute may modify the
bandwidth properties in the following ways when including them in the answer:
\- The Maximum Supported Bandwidth may be reduced.
\- The Maximum Desired Bandwidth may be reduced.
\- The Minimum Desired Bandwidth may be reduced.
\- The Minimum Supported Bandwidth may be increased. If the reason for
increasing the Minimum Supported Bandwidth is that the Minimum Packet Rate
needs to be increased then the Minimum Packet Rate shall also be adjusted.
\- The Maximum Packet Rate may be reduced.
\- The Minimum Packet Rate may be increased.
## 19.4 Modifications of the bandwidth information by intermediate network
nodes
Networks nodes in the path, capable of understanding and modifying the SDP,
may modify the new bandwidth information in the SDP offer for each codec and
configuration in the following manner:
\- The first node may decrease the maximum supported, maximum desired and
minimum desired bandwidth according to network policies. However, the first
node should not increase the maximum supported, maximum desired and minimum
desired bandwidth except when required to correct undesired or erroneous UE
behavior, or for IPv4/IPv6 transport interworking.
\- The first node may increase the minimum supported bandwidth according to
network policies. However, the first node should not decrease the minimum
supported bandwidth except when required to correct UE misbehavior, or for
IPv4/IPv6 transport interworking.
\- Subsequent nodes may decrease the maximum supported, maximum desired and
minimum desired bandwidths and increase the minimum supported bandwidth, but
shall not increase the maximum supported, maximum desired and minimum desired
bandwidths, and shall also not decrease the minimum supported bandwidth except
when required due to IPv4/IPv6 transport interworking.
\- Networks nodes may remove an unwanted codec or configuration together with
all related bandwidth information.
\- Networks nodes may add codecs or configurations accessible via transcoding
together with all related bandwidth information.
\- If a network node desires to use a MBR=GBR bearer, it should decrease
maximum supported bandwidth down to the maximum desired bandwidth in the SDP
offer.
\- The following relationships shall be maintained by any network node when
modifying the bandwidth propertiess:
> Minimum Supported Bandwidth \
> Minimum Desired Bandwidth \
> Maximum Desired Bandwidth \GBR bearers can decrease the Minimum Desired Bandwidth.\ An
operator desiring to limit the GBR for MBR=GBR bearers can decrease the
Maximum Supported Bandwidth.
In the SDP answer, the first node should not modify the bandwidth values
except when required to correct UE misbehavior, when replacing the selected
codec and configuration in the SDP answer due to transcoding, or due to
IPv4/IPv6 transport interworking. Subsequent node also shall not modify the
bandwidth values except when replacing the selected codec and configuration in
the SDP answer due to transcoding, or due to IPv4/IPv6 transport interworking.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Examples of SDP offers and answers
# A.1 SDP offers for speech sessions initiated by MTSI client in terminal
This Annex includes several SDP examples for session setup for speech. SDP
examples for sessions with speech and DTMF are shown in Annex G. These SDP
offer and answer examples are designed to highlight the respective area that
is being described and should therefore not be considered as complete SDP
offers and answers. See TS 24.229 [7] for a complete description of the SDPs.
Therefore mandated session parameters such as b=AS should be assumed as
present in the media and session level, even if they are not included in the
SDP examples.
Some of the SDP examples contain a=fmtp lines that are too long to meet the
column width constraints of this document and are therefore folded into
several lines using the backslash ("\") character. In a real SDP, long lines
would appear as one single line and not as such folded lines.
Some of the examples included in this Annex outline configurations that have
been optimized for HSPA. These configurations are equally applicable to
E-UTRAN access since the packetization recommendations for HSPA and E-UTRAN in
Clauses 7.4.2 and 7.5.2.1 for MTSI clients and Clause 12.3.2 for MTSI media
gateways are identical.
## A.1.1 HSPA or unknown access technology
When the access technology is unknown to the MTSI client in terminal, the
client uses the encapsulation parameters of default operation as defined in
clause 7.5.2.1.2. The SDP examples below apply to HSPA as well as the default
operation since the encapsulation parameters are the same.
### A.1.1.1 Only AMR-NB supported by MTSI client in terminal
In this example one RTP Payload Type (97) is defined for the bandwidth-
efficient payload format and another RTP payload type (98) for the octet-
aligned payload format. In this case, the MTSI client in terminal supports
mode changes at any time, mode changes to any mode and mode change
restrictions.
Table A.1.1: SDP example
+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
The UDP port number (49152) and the payload type numbers (97 and 98) are
examples and the offerer is free to select other numbers within the
restrictions of the UDP and RTP specifications. It is recommended to use the
dynamic port numbers in the 49152 to 65535 range. RTP should use even numbers
for RTP media and the next higher odd number for RTCP. It is however allowed
to use any number within the registered port range 1 024 to 49 151. The
receiver must be capable of using any combination of even and odd numbers for
RTP and RTCP.
The SDP Capabilities Negotiation framework (SDPCapNeg) [69] is used to
negotiate what RTP profile to use. The offer includes RTP/AVP in the
conventional SDP part by including it in the media (m=) line, while RTP/AVPF
is given as a transport capability using the SDPCapNeg framework "a=tcap:1
RTP/AVPF". A potential configuration gives RTP/AVPF as an alternative
"a=pcfg:1 t=1". Given by the rules in SDPCapNeg, the RTP/AVPF profile has
higher preference than RTP/AVP.
It is important that the MTSI client in terminal does not define any mode-set
because then the answerer is free to respond with any mode-set that it can
support. If the MTSI client in terminal would define mode-set to any value,
then the answer only has the option to either accept it or reject it. The
latter case might require several ping-pong between the MTSI clients before
they can reach an agreement on what mode set to use in the session. This would
increase the setup time significantly. This is also one important reason for
why the MTSI clients in terminals must support the complete codec mode set of
the AMR and AMR-WB codecs, because then a media gateway interfacing GERAN or
UTRAN can immediately define the mode-set that it supports on the GERAN or
UTRAN circuit switched access.
Since the MTSI client in terminal is required to support mode changes at any
frame border and also to any mode in the received media stream, it does not
set the mode-change-period and mode-change-neighbor parameters.
The mode-change-capability and max-red parameter are new in the updated AMR
payload format [28]. With mode-change-capability=2, the MTSI client in
terminal shows that it does support aligning mode changes every other frame
and the answerer then knows that requesting mode-change-period=2 in the SDP
answer will work properly. The max-red parameter indicates the maximum
interval between a non-redundant frame and a redundant frame. Note that the
maxptime and max-red parameters do not need to be synchronized.
The payload type for the bandwidth-efficient payload format (97) is listed
before the payload type for the octet-aligned payload format (98) because it
is the preferred one.
With the combination of ptime:20 and maxptime:240, the MTSI client in terminal
shows that it desires to receive one speech frame per packet but can handle up
to 12 speech frames per packet. However, no more than 4 original speech frames
can be encapsulated in one packet.
A suitable SDP answer from another MTSI client in terminal is shown in Table
A.3.0.
### A.1.1.2 AMR and AMR-WB are supported by MTSI client in terminal
#### A.1.1.2.1 One-phase approach
The size of the SDP may become quite big, depending on how many configurations
the MTSI client in terminal supports for different media. Therefore, the
session setup may be divided into phases where the most desirable
configurations are offered in the first phase. If the first phase fails, then
the remaining configurations can be offered in a second phase.
In table A.1.2 an example is shown where a one-phase approach is used and
where the SDP includes both AMR and AMR-WB and both the bandwidth-efficient
and octet-aligned payload formats.
Table A.1.2: SDP example: one-phase approach
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 99 100 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:100 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:100 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
It is easy to imagine that the SDP offer can become quite large if the client
supports many different configurations for one or several media. A solution to
this problem is shown in Clause A.1.1.2.2.
A few possible SDP answers are outlined in Tables A.3.1, A.3.1a, A.3.2, A.3.3
and A.3.4.
#### A.1.1.2.2 Two-phase approach
Tables A.1.3 and A.1.4 show the same configurations as in table A.1.2 but when
the SDP has been divided into 2 phases.
Table A.1.3: SDP example: 1^st^ phase SDP offer
+-------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-------------------------------------------------+
Table A.1.4: SDP example: 2^nd^ phase SDP offer
+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVPF 97 98 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
Many types of media and maybe even many different configurations for some or
all media types, may give quite large SIP messages. When constructing the
offer, the access type and the radio bearer(s) for the answerer are not yet
known. To maintain a reasonable setup time, a 2-phase approach may be useful
where the most desirable configurations are included in the 1^st^ phase and
the 2^nd^ phase is entered only if all payload types for one media type are
rejected.
There is however a drawback with the two-phase approach. If the 2^nd^ phase is
not entered, then a cell change that would require configurations from the
2^nd^ phase SDP is likely to give long interruption times, several seconds,
while the session parameters are re-negotiated.
The SDPCapNeg framework is only used in the 1^st^ SDP offer because when
generating the 2^nd^ SDP offer the profile is already agreed. In this example,
it is assumed that AVPF was accepted in the first round.
If the 1^st^ SDP offer, shown in Table A.1.3, is accepted by the answerer then
a few possible example SDP answers are shown in: Table A.3.1 if the answerer
is an MTSI client in terminal and supports AMR-WB; Table A.3.2 if the answerer
is an MTSI client in terminal but does not support AMR-WB; Table A.3.3 if the
answerer is an MTSI client in terminal, supports AMR-WB and is using EGPRS
access; Table A.3.4 if the answerer is a CS terminal, supports AMR-WB and an
MTSI MGW is therefore needed.
## A.1.2 EGPRS
In this example one RTP Payload Type (97) is defined for the bandwidth-
efficient payload format and another RTP Payload Type (98) is defined for the
octet-aligned payload format.
Table A.1.5: SDP example
+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=200 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=200; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:40 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
The only difference compared with the SDP offer for HSPA is ptime: 40. This
definition is used to optimize capacity by reducing the amount of overhead
that lower layers introduce. Defining ptime:20 will also work, but will be
less optimal. Thus, when performing a cell change from HSPA to EGPRS, it is
not an absolute necessity to update the session parameters immediately. It can
be done after a while, which would also reduce the amount of SIP signalling if
a MTSI client in terminal is switching frequently between HSPA and EGPRS or
some other access type.
It is recommended to set the max-red parameter to an integer multiple of the
ptime.
An example of a suitable SDP answer to this SDP offer is shown in Table
A.3.3a.
## A.1.3 Generic Access
In this example one RTP Payload Type (97) is defined for the bandwidth-
efficient payload format and another RTP Payload Type (98) is defined for the
octet-aligned payload format.
Table A.1.6: SDP example
+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=160 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=160; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:80 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
In this case the MTSI client in terminal has detected that the load on the
WLAN network is quite high and therefore ptime is set to 80. For other
operating conditions, it could set ptime to 20, 40 or 60. This parameter may
be updated during the session if the load of the WLAN network changes.
An example of a suitable SDP answer to this SDP offer is shown in Table
A.3.3b.
# A.2 SDP offers for speech sessions initiated by media gateway
## A.2.1 General
These examples show only SDP offers when the MTSI media gateway does not
support the same configurations as for the MTSI terminal in clause A.1. A
media gateway supporting the same configurations as for the examples in clause
A.1 should create the same SDP offers.
## A.2.2 MGW between GERAN UE and MTSI
This example shows the SDP offer when the call is initiated from GSM CS using
the AMR with the {12.2, 7.4, 5.9 and 4.75} codec mode set. In this example, it
is also assumed that only the bandwidth-efficient payload format is supported
and that it will not send any redundant speech frames.
Table A.2.1: SDP example
+-------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=============================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-set=0,2,4,7; mode-change-period=2, \ | | | | mode-change-neighbor=1; mode-change-capability=2; max-red=0 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:80 | +-------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
Since the MGW only supports a subset of the AMR codec modes, it needs to
indicate this in the SDP. The same applies for the mode change restrictions.
An example of a suitable SDP answer to this SDP offer is shown in Table A.3.5.
## A.2.3 MGW between legacy UTRAN UE and MTSI
This example shows the SDP offer when the call is initiated from legacy UTRAN
CS mobile that only the AMR 12.2 mode. In this example, it is also assumed
that only the bandwidth-efficient payload format is supported.
Table A.2.2: SDP example
+---------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-set=7; max-red=0 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:20 | +---------------------------------+
**Comments:**
Since only one mode is supported, the mode-change-period, mode-change-neighbor
and mode-change-capability parameters do not apply.
In this case it is advisable to not allow redundancy since the legacy UTRAN CS
mobile does not support any lower rate codec modes and then redundancy would
almost double the bitrate on the PS access side. Therefore, maxptime is set to
20 and max-red is set to 0.
If a mode-set with several codec modes was defined and if max-red and maxptime
are set to larger values than what Table A.1.8 shows, then redundancy is
possible on the PS access side but not together with TFO.
An example of a suitable SDP answer to this SDP offer is shown in Table A.3.6.
## A.2.4 MGW between CS UE and MTSI
This example shows the SDP offer when two mode sets are supported by the MGW.
Table A.2.3: SDP example
+--------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +==============================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-set=0,2,4,7; mode-change-period=2, \ | | | | mode-change-neighbor=1; mode-change-capability=2; max-red=20 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-set=0,3,5,6; mode-change-period=2, \ | | | | mode-change-neighbor=1; mode-change-capability=2; max-red=20 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:80 | +--------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
Redundancy up to 100 % is supported in this case since max-red is set to 20.
An example of a suitable SDP answer to this SDP offer is shown in Table A.3.6.
## A.2.5 MGW between GERAN UE and MTSI when wideband speech is supported
This example shows the SDP offer when the call is initiated from GSM CS when
AMR is supported with the {12.2, 7.4, 5.9 and 4.75} codec mode set and when
AMR-WB is supported with the {12.65, 8.85 and 6.60} mode set. In this example,
it is also assumed that only the bandwidth-efficient payload format is
supported and that the MTSI MGW will not send any redundant speech frames.
Table A.2.4: SDP example
+-------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=============================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 98 97 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-set=0,2,4,7; mode-change-period=2, \ | | | | mode-change-neighbor=1; mode-change-capability=2; max-red=0 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-set=0,1,2; mode-change-period=2, \ | | | | mode-change-neighbor=1; mode-change-capability=2; max-red=0 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:80 | +-------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
Since the MGW only supports a subset of the AMR codec modes and of the AMR-WB
codec modes, it needs to indicate this in the SDP. The same applies for the
mode change restrictions.
# A.3 SDP answers to SDP speech session offers
## A.3.1 General
This clause gives a few examples of possible SDP answers. The likelihood that
these SDP answers will be used may vary from case to case since the SDP answer
depends on circumstances outside the scope of this specification for example:
availability of resources, radio bearer assignment and policy control. It is
impossible to cover all the possible variants and hence these examples should
be regarded as just a few examples of many possible alternatives. They were
however selected because they span the range of possible SDP answers quite
well.
The SDP offers are included to clarify what is being answered.
## A.3.1a SDP answer from an MTSI client in terminal when only narrowband
speech was offered
These SDP offers and answer are likely when the offering MTSI client in
terminal (or other client) only supports narrowband speech (AMR).
The SDP offer included in this example is identical to the SDP offer shown in
Table A.1.1.
Table A.3.0: SDP example
+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | **SDP offer** | +================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+ | **SDP answer** | +----------------------------------------------------------------+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVPF 99 | | | | a=acfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
The SDP answer contains only one encoding format since 3GPP TS 24.229 [7]
requires that the answerer shall select exactly one codec for the answer.
Since both MTSI clients in terminals support the same configurations for
narrowband speech, it is likely that the selected configuration included in
the answer is identical to the configuration in the offer and that no mode-set
is defined by the terminating client.
The conclusion from this offer-answer procedure is that the offerer can only
send AMR encoded speech to the answerer using the bandwidth-efficient payload
type with RTP Payload Type 99, since this was the only configuration included
in the answer. The answerer sends AMR encoded speech to the offerer using the
bandwidth-efficient payload format, in this case RTP Payload Type 97.
Even though both MTSI clients in terminals support all codec modes, it is
desirable to mainly use the codec modes from the AMR {12.2, 7.4, 5.9 and 4.75}
mode set because the set includes codec modes frequently used in GERAN and
UTRAN, and enables to control quality and capacity with appropriate bit-rate
granularity.
Unless transmission conditions necessitate other encapsulation types it is
also desirable to encapsulate only 1 speech frame per packet, even though both
MTSI clients in terminals support receiving several frames per packet.
In the above example it is assumed that AVPF will be accepted since the MTSI
client is required to support this RTP profile.
## A.3.2 SDP answer from an MTSI client in terminal
These SDP offers and answers are likely when both MTSI clients in terminals
support AMR and AMR-WB and also both the bandwidth-efficient and the octet-
aligned payload formats.
The SDP offer included in this example is identical to the SDP offer shown in
Table A.1.2, with the exception that the number of channels is omitted for
each of the codecs. This implies that the terminal is offering one channel for
each codec.
Table A.3.1: SDP example
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 99 100 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR-WB/16000 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR-WB/16000 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR/8000 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:100 AMR/8000 | | | | a=fmtp:100 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP answer if AVPF is accepted | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVPF 97 | | | | a=acfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR-WB/16000 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
The SDP answer contains only one encoding format since 3GPP TS 24.229 [7]
requires that the answerer shall select exactly one codec for the answer.
Since both MTSI clients in terminals support the same configurations, it is
likely that the selected configuration included in the answer is identical to
the configuration in the offer and that no mode-set is defined by the
terminating client. The conclusion from this offer-answer process is that AMR-
WB will be used during the session with RTP Payload Type 97. The SDP answer
does not include the number of audio channels, implying that one channel has
been accepted.
Even though both MTSI clients in terminals support all codec modes, it is
desirable to mainly use the codec modes from the AMR-WB {12.65, 8.85 and 6.60}
mode set because the set includes codec modes frequently used in GERAN and
UTRAN, and enables to control quality and capacity with appropriate bit-rate
granularity.
Unless transmission conditions necessitate other encapsulation types it is
also desirable to encapsulate only 1 speech frame per packet, even though both
MTSI clients in terminals support receiving several frames per packet.
In the above example it is assumed that AVPF will be accepted since the MTSI
client is required to support this RTP profile.
This SDP answer is also a possible answer to the SDP offer shown in Table
A.1.3.
## A.3.2a SDP answer from a non-MTSI UE with AVP
The MTSI client must be prepared to receive an SDP answer with AVP. This is
likely to occur for legacy clients that do not support AVPF or SDPCapNeg. The
example in Table A.3.1a shows a possible SDP answer with AVP to an SDP offer
as shown in Table A.1.2.
Table A.3.1a: SDP answer example with AVP
+-------------------------------------------------+ | **SDP answer with AVP** | +=================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
A client that does not support SDPCapNeg would not understand the attributes
defined by the SDPCapNeg framework and would therefore ignore the lines with
'a=tcap' and 'a=pcfg'.
## A.3.3 SDP answer from an MTSI client in terminal supporting only AMR
These SDP offers and answers are likely when the answering MTSI client in
terminal supports only AMR.
The SDP offer included in this example is identical to the SDP offer shown in
Table A.1.2.
Table A.3.2: SDP example
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 99 100 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:100 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:100 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP answer | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVPF 99 | | | | a=acfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
In the answer, RTP Payload Types 97 and 98 have been removed since AMR-WB is
not supported and RTP Payload Type 100 is removed since the answerer is
required to answer with only one encoding format.
Even though both MTSI clients in terminals support all codec modes, it is
desirable to mainly use the codec modes from the AMR [12.2, 7.4 5.9 and 4.75]
mode set because the set includes codec modes frequently used in GERAN and
UTRAN, and enables to control quality and capacity with appropriate bit-rate
granularity.
This SDP answer is also a possible answer to the SDP offer shown in Table
A.1.3.
## A.3.4 SDP answer from an MTSI client in terminal using EGPRS access when
both AMR and AMR-WB are supported
In this case the answering MTSI client in terminal is using EGPRS access and
supports both narrowband and wideband speech, i.e. both AMR and AMR-WB.
The SDP offer is identical to the SDP offer shown in Table A.1.2.
Table A.3.3: SDP example
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 99 100 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:100 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:100 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP answer | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVPF 97 | | | | a=acfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=200 | | | | a=ptime:40 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
The answering MTSI client in terminal responds that it desires to receive 2
frames encapsulated in each packet. It will however send with 1 frame per
packet since the offering MTSI client in terminal desires to receive this
format. A future SIP UPDATE may change this so that 2 frames per packet are
used in both directions.
The answering MTSI client in terminal also responds with max-red defined to
200 ms since this is the closes multiple of the desired frame aggregation. It
should however be noted that it is not a requirement to define max-red to be a
multiple of ptime, but it is recommended to do so.
This SDP answer is also a possible answer to the SDP offer shown in Table
A.1.3.
## A.3.4a SDP answer from an MTSI client in terminal using EGPRS access when
only AMR is supported
In this case the answering MTSI client in terminal is using EGPRS access but
supports only narroband speech, i.e. only AMR.
The SDP offer is identical to the SDP offer shown in Table A.1.2 although the
SDP answer here would also work nicely as a response to the SDP offer shown in
Table A.1.5.
Table A.3.3a: SDP example
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | **SDP offer** | +=================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 99 100 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:100 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:100 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | **SDP answer** | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVPF 97 | | | | a=acfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=200 | | | | a=ptime:40 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
The answering MTSI client in terminal responds that it desires to receive 2
frames encapsulated in each packet. It will however send with 1 frame per
packet since the offering MTSI client in terminal desires to receive this
format. A future SIP UPDATE may change this so that 2 frames per packet are
used in both directions.
The answering MTSI client in terminal also responds with max-red defined to
200 ms since this is the closes multiple of the desired frame aggregation. It
should however be noted that it is not a requirement to define max-red to be a
multiple of ptime, but it is recommended to do so.
This SDP answer is also a suitable response to an SDP offer as shown in Table
A.1.5, even if the answering MTSI client in a terminal is using HSPA access.
This is because it is wise to harmonize the packetization, and the ptime in
the SDP answer, with the ptime in the SDP offer so that 2 frames per packet
will be used in both directions when one of the end-points is using EGPRS
access.
## A.3.4b SDP answer from an MTSI client in terminal using WLAN
In this example, the MTSI client in terminal is using a WLAN network.
The SDP offer shown here is identical to the SDP offer shown in Table A.1.1.
Table A.3.3b: SDP example
+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | **SDP offer** | +================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+ | **SDP answer** | +----------------------------------------------------------------+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVPF 97 | | | | a=acfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=160 | | | | a=ptime:80 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
This SDP answer, with ptime=80, is suitable if the MTSI client in terminal can
measure the load in the WLAN network and has detected that the load is high.
If, on the other hand, the load is low then the MTSI client in terminal may
very well choose to use a lower value for the ptime attribute, for example 20
or 40.
This SDP answer is also suitable when the answering MTSI client in terminal is
using HSPA access but when the offerer is using WLAN and indicates ptime=80,
e.g. as shown in the SDP offer in Table A.1.6. In such a case, it is wise to
harmonize the ptime values in both directions to increase the likelihood that
several frames will be encapsulated in the RTP packets.
This SDP answer is also a possible answer to the SDP offer shown in Table
A.1.3.
## A.3.5 SDP answer from MTSI MGW supporting only one codec mode set for AMR
and AMR-WB each
In this case the MTSI MGW supports only one codec mode set for AMR, {12.2,
7.4, 5.9 and 4.75}, and one codec mode set for AMR-WB, {12.65, 8.85 and 6.60},
since the CS terminal only supports these mode sets. The MTSI MGW also only
supports the bandwidth-efficient payload format.
The SDP offer included in this example is identical to the SDP offer shown in
Table A.1.2.
Table A.3.4: SDP example
+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer (from MTSI client in terminal on HSPA) | +======================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 99 100 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:100 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:100 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP answer (from MTSI MGW) | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVPF 97 | | | | a=acfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-set=0,1,2; mode-change-period=2, | | mode-change-neighbor=1; \ | | | | mode-change-capability=2; max-red=0 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:80 | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
The MTSI MGW is allowed to define the mode-set parameter since the MTSI client
in terminal did not define it. Thereby, it is possible to avoid several SDP
offers and answers.
The SDP answer contains only one encoding format since 3GPP TS 24.229 [7]
requires that the answerer shall select exactly one codec for the answer. In
this case, the CS terminal supports wideband speech and the MTSI MGW therefore
chooses to establish a wideband speech session.
Since the MTSI client in terminal has defined that it does support
restrictions in mode changes, the MTSI MGW can safely set the mode-change-
period and mode-change-neighbor parameters.
In this example, the MTSI MGW also does not support redundancy so it sets max-
red to zero.
This SDP answer is also a possible answer to the SDP offer shown in Table
A.1.3.
## A.3.5a SDP answer from MTSI MGW supporting only one codec mode set for AMR
In this case the MTSI MGW supports only one codec mode set for AMR, {12.2,
7.4, 5.9 and 4.75}, since the CS terminal supports only this mode set. The
MTSI MGW also only supports the bandwidth-efficient payload format.

## A.3.6 SDP answer from MTSI client in terminal on HSPA for session initiated
from MTSI MGW interfacing UE on GERAN
This example shows the offers and answers for a session between a GERAN CS UE,
through a MTSI media gateway, and a MTSI client in terminal.
The SDP offer shown here is very similar to the SDP offer shown in Table
A.2.1. The only difference is that maxptime is set to 20.
Table A.3.5: SDP example
+-------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer (from MTSI MGW) | +=============================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-set=0,2,4,7; mode-change-period=2, \ | | | | mode-change-neighbor=1; mode-change-capability=2; max-red=0 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:20 | +-------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP answer (from MTSI client in terminal) | +-------------------------------------------------------------+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVPF 97 | | | | a=acfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-set=0,2,4,7; mode-change-period=2, \ | | | | mode-change-neighbor=1; mode-change-capability=2; max-red=0 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
The MTSI media gateway offers only a restricted mode set sincethe CS terminal
does not support anything else. The MTSI client in terminal has to accept
this, if it wants to continue with the session setup.
This example also shows that the MTSI media gateway wants to receive only 1
frame per packet. The maxptime parameter is therefore set to 20. With max-red
set to 0 the MTSI media gateway also shows that it will not send redundancy.
The MTSI terminal can support receiving up to 12 frames per packet. It
therefore set the maxptime parameter to 240.
The MTSI client in terminal detects that the MTSI media gateway does not want
to receive redundancy and therefore sets max-red to 0.
The SDP answer shown in this example is also a suitable answer to the SDP
offer shown in Table A.2.1. This SDP answer is also suitable for the SDP offer
shown Table A.2.3.
## A.3.7 SDP answer from MTSI client in terminal on HSPA for session initiated
from MTSI MGW interfacing legacy UE on UTRAN
This example shows the offers and answers for a session between a legacy UTRAN
CS UE that only supports AMR 12.2, through a MTSI media gateway, and a MTSI
client in terminal.
The SDP offer shown here is identical to the SDP offer shown in Table A.2.2.

+-------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=============================================================+ | m=video 49154 RTP/AVP 99 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | b=AS:315 | | | | b=RS:0 | | | | b=RR:2500 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000 | | | | a=fmtp:99 packetization-mode=0; profile-level-id=42e00c; \ | | | | sprop-parameter-sets=J0LgDJWgUH6Af1A=,KM46gA== | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* trr-int 5000 | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* nack | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* nack pli | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* ccm fir | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* ccm tmmbr | | | | a=extmap:4 urn:3gpp:video-orientation | +-------------------------------------------------------------+
The offered codec is H.264/AVC. The packetization-mode parameter indicates
single NAL unit mode. This is the default mode and it is therefore not
necessary to include this parameter (see RFC 6184 [25]). The profile-level-id
parameter indicates Constrained Baseline profile at level 1.2, which supports
bitrates up to 384 kbps. It also indicates, by using so‑called constraint-set
flags, that the bit stream can be decoded by any Baseline, Main or Extended
profile decoder. The third parameter, sprop-parameter-sets, includes base-64
encoded sequence and picture parameter set NAL units that are referred by the
video bit stream. The sequence parameter set used here includes syntax that
specifies the number of re‑ordered frames to be zero so that latency can be
minimized. The bandwidth (including IP, UDP and RTP overhead) for video is
restricted to 315 kbps.
The negotiation of AVPF features is also shown. By setting 'trr-int' to 5000
the MTSI client indicates that the minimum interval between two regular RTCP
packets needs to be 5 seconds, [40]. The 'nack' and 'nack pli' parameters
indicate that the MTSI client supports NACK (Generic NACK) and PLI (Picture
Loss Indication) as defined by AVPF, [40]. The 'ccm fir' and 'ccm tmmbr'
parameters indicate that the MTSI client supports the FIR (Full Intra Request)
and TMMBR (Temporary Maximum Media Stream Bit Rate Request), [43]. The
wildcard ('*') indicates that at it is possible to use these features for all
RTP payload types for the video stream.
The negotiation of the video orientation header extension is made with the
a=extmap attribute [95]. In this example, the local identifier (ID) is set to
'4'. This number is only an example and other values may be used.
An example SDP answer to the offer is given below.
Table A.4.2a2: Example SDP answer
+-------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP answer | +=============================================================+ | m=video 49154 RTP/AVPF 99 | | | | a=acfg:1 t=1 | | | | b=AS:315 | | | | b=RS:0 | | | | b=RR:2500 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000 | | | | a=fmtp:99 packetization-mode=0; profile-level-id=42e00c; \ | | | | sprop-parameter-sets=J0LgDJWgUH6Af1A=,KM46gA== | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* trr-int 5000 | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* nack | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* nack pli | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* ccm fir | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* ccm tmmbr | | | | a=extmap:4 urn:3gpp:video-orientation | +-------------------------------------------------------------+
The responding MTSI client is capable of using H.264/AVC. As the offer already
indicated the lowest level (level 1.2) of H.264/AVC as well as the minimum
constraint set, there is no room for further negotiation of profiles and
levels. However, the bandwidth could be constrained further by reducing the
bandwidth in b=AS.

The offer for 'Arbitrary ROI' and 'Sent ROI' are indicated in the last two
lines.
The use of RTCP feedback messages carrying 'Arbitrary ROI' is negotiated with
the '3gpp-roi-arbitrary' parameter. The wildcard ('*') indicates that it is
possible to use the ROI features for all RTP payload types including video.
The use of the 'Sent ROI' header extension carrying arbitrary ROI information
is negotiated with the a=extmap attribute [95] based on the URN 'urn:3gpp:roi-
sent'. In this example, the local identifier (ID) is set to 7, which is only
an example. Other values may be used as long as a distinct ID is assigned for
each extmap attribute corresponding to different URNs.

The offer for 'Pre-defined ROI' and 'Sent ROI' are indicated in the last two
lines.
The offered set of pre-defined ROIs is provided by the "a=predefined_ROI"
attribute. The use of RTCP feedback messages carrying 'Pre-defined ROI' is
negotiated with the '3gpp-roi-predefined' parameter. The wildcard ('*')
indicates that it is possible to use the ROI features for all RTP payload
types including video.
The use of the 'Sent ROI' header extension carrying pre-defined ROI
information is negotiated with the a=extmap attribute [95] based on the URN
'urn:3gpp:predefined-roi-sent'. In this example, the local identifier (ID) is

The answer indicates that both 'Pre-defined ROI' and 'Sent ROI' have been
accepted.
The following example is identical to A.4.2a with the exception of FECC,
'Arbitrary ROI' and 'Sent ROI' being offered.
Table A.4.2e.5: Example SDP offer with FECC, 'Arbitrary ROI' and 'Sent ROI'
+-------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=============================================================+ | m=video 49154 RTP/AVP 99 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | b=AS:315 | | | | b=RS:0 | | | | b=RR:2500 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000 | | | | a=fmtp:99 packetization-mode=0; profile-level-id=42e00c; \ | | | | sprop-parameter-sets=J0LgDJWgUH6Af1A=,KM46gA== | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* trr-int 5000 | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* nack | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* nack pli | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* ccm fir | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* ccm tmmbr | | | | a=extmap:4 urn:3gpp:video-orientation | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* 3gpp-roi-arbitrary | | | | a=extmap:7 urn:3gpp:roi-sent | | | | m=application 50000 RTP/AVPF 99 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 h224/4800 | | | | a=sendonly | +-------------------------------------------------------------+
The offer for FECC is made according to the procedures specified in [139]. In
this example, the MTSI client offers a sendonly channel since it is unwilling
to adjust the video ROI during encoding based on PTZF commands received from
the far end and it does not intend to use H.224 to learn the capabilities of
the far end. At the same time, if the far end is capable of FECC, it indicates
that it can take advantage of this capability and send PTZF commands to adjust
video ROI for the video stream in the receive direction.

The answer indicates that FECC, 'Arbitrary ROI' and 'Sent ROI' are all
accepted. On FECC, the MTSI client answers with a recvonly confirming that it
supports the FECC protocol and would be willing to adjust the video ROI during
encoding based on PTZF commands received from the far end. As such, FECC can
only be used for video in one direction.
The following example is identical to A.4.2a with the exception of FECC, 'Pre-

accepted. For FECC, the MTSI client answers with a sendonly since it is
unwilling to adjust the video ROI during encoding based on PTZF commands
received from the far end and it does not intend to use H.224 to learn the
capabilities of the far end. At the same time, since the far end is capable of
FECC, it indicates that it can take advantage of this capability and send PTZF
commands to adjust video ROI for the video stream in the receive direction. As
such, FECC can only be used for video in one direction.
## A.4.3 Void
## A.4.4 Void
## A.4.4a H.264/AVC with \"imageattr\" attribute
In this example the SDP offer includes H.264/AVC with negotiation of the image
size using the "imageattr" attribute.

The offered codec is H.264/AVC. The packetization-mode parameter indicates
single NAL unit mode. This is the default mode and it is therefore not
necessary to include this parameter (see RFC 6184 [25]). The profile-level-id
parameter indicates Baseline profile at level 1.2, which supports bitrates up
to 384 kbps. It also indicates, by using so‑called constraint-set flags, that
the bit stream can be decoded by any Baseline, Main or Extended profile
decoder. The bandwidth (including IP, UDP and RTP overhead) for video is 315
kbps. The third parameter, sprop-parameter-sets, includes base-64 encoded
sequence and picture parameter set NAL units that are referred by the video
bit stream. The sequence parameter set used here includes syntax that
specifies the number of re‑ordered frames to be zero so that latency can be
minimized. sprop-parameter-sets is constructed assuming the offered conditions
and image size of 320x240, which is the largest of all offered sizes for send
direction. The offering MTSI client offers four image sizes for both send and
receive directions but prefers 272x224 for receive direction, which might fit
the available space on its display better than the other image sizes.
Since the support of a particular codec level does not imply that the video
encoder has to produce a bitstream up to the maximum capability of the level,
it may be useful for an MTSI client to indicate the image sizes it can encode
video at for each codec it supports, using the "imageattr" SDP attribute [76].
Then on the receiving side, the MTSI client can indicate which of these image
sizes it prefers to receive. This reduces the loss of quality from rescaling
the decoded image to fit the available space on the receiver's display.
An example SDP answer to the offer is given below.

The responding MTSI client is capable of using H.264/AVC. The responding MTSI
client agreed to use a bandwidth of 315 kbps and to use the Baseline profile
at level 1.2. From the four image sizes offered, the responding MTSI client
included 320x240 for both send and receive directions. Although the offering
MTSI client preferred 272x224 for receive direction, the responding MTSI
client might not be able to offer 272x224 or not allow encoding and decoding
of video of different image sizes simultaneously. The responding MTSI client
sent new sprop-parameter-sets for the video decoder of the offering MTSI
client, which was constructed assuming the agreed conditions and image size of
320x240.

In this alternative answer, the responding MTSI client has restricted the
video bandwidth to 107 kbps and restricted the H.264/AVC level to 1.1 which
supports bitrates up to 192 kbps. The restricted H.264/AVC level should be
high enough to enable the image sizes for both send and receive directions.
From the four image sizes offered, the responding MTSI client included 272x224
for send direction, which was preferred by the offering MTSI client. For the
receive direction, the responding MTSI client included 320x240 as preferred
and 272x224 as fallback because the responding MTSI client was unsure whether
the offering MTSI client can encode and decode video of different image sizes
simultaneously at the conditions. The responding MTSI client sent new sprop-
parameter-sets for the video decoder of the offering MTSI client, which was
constructed assuming the restricted conditions. Though not required in
response to the SDP answer indicating more than one image size in the receive
direction, the offering MTSI client may chose to send a second offer as shown
in Table A.4.12 to confirm that it is able to encode and decode at different
image sizes.

Since now the offering MTSI client knows that the responding MTSI client
supports and prefers to use AVPF, AVPF is offered without SDPCapNeg and AVP.
### A.4.4a.1 H.264/AVC with \"imageattr\" attribute -- different image sizes
in SDP offer and answer
In this example the SDP offer includes H.264/AVC with negotiation of the image
size using the "imageattr" attribute.

The offer in Table A.4.12ad is identical to that in Table A.4.10a except that
the MTSI client offers an image size of 320x240 for both directions.
An example SDP answer to the offer is given below.

In this case, unless the offering MTSI client also supports 272x224, the
offering MTSI client should proceed with the session setup without issuing
another SDP offer to perform image size negotiation.
### A.4.4a.2 H.264/AVC with \"imageattr\" attribute -- different payload type
numbers in offer and answer
In this example the SDP offer includes H.264/AVC with negotiation of the image
size using the "imageattr" attribute.

The offer in Table A.4.12af is identical to that in Table A.4.10a except that
the MTSI client offers image sizes of 320x240 for the send direction and
272x224 for the receive direction.
An example SDP answer to the offer is given below.
Table A.4.12ag: Example SDP answer

In this case, the responding MTSI client's answer matches the image sizes in
the offer. However, payload type number 99 is not available (e.g., already
used for other media) and payload type number 101 is included instead for
video media. After the session is established, the offering MTSI client sends
the video with payload type number 101 with image size 320x240 towards the
responding MTSI client. Similarly, the answering MTSI client sends the video
with payload type number 99 with image size 272x224 towards the offering MTSI
client.
## A.4.4b H.264/AVC with \"imageattr\" attribute with multiple rtpmaps
In this example the SDP offer includes H.264/AVC with negotiation of the image
size using the "imageattr" attribute with multiple rtpmaps for different image
sizes.

The offered codec is H.264/AVC. The packetization-mode parameter indicates
single NAL unit mode. Two image sizes for send and receive directions are
offered. The profile-level-id parameter of the first rtpmap indicates
Constrained Baseline profile at level 2.2, which supports bitrates up to 4000
kbps. It also indicates, by using so‑called constraint-set flags, that the bit
stream can be decoded by any Baseline, Main or Extended profile decoder. The
bandwidth (including IP, UDP and RTP overhead) for video is 900 kbps. The
third parameter, sprop-parameter-sets, includes base-64 encoded sequence and
picture parameter set NAL units that are referred by the video bit stream. The
sequence parameter set used here includes syntax that specifies the number of
re‑ordered frames to be zero so that latency can be minimized. sprop-
parameter-sets is constructed assuming the offered conditions and image size
of 640x480. The profile-level-id parameter of the second rtpmap indicates
Constrained Baseline profile at level 1.2, which supports bitrates up to
384kbps. It also indicates, by using so‑called constraint-set flags, that the
bit stream can be decoded by any Baseline, Main or Extended profile decoder.
The third parameter, sprop-parameter-sets, includes base-64 encoded sequence
and picture parameter set NAL units that are referred by the video bit stream.
The sequence parameter set used here includes syntax that specifies the number

An example SDP answer to the offer is given below.

The responding MTSI client is capable of using H.264/AVC. The responding MTSI
client agreed to use a bandwidth of 315 kbps and to use the Constrained
Baseline profile at level 1.2. The responding MTSI client included 320x240 for
both send and receive directions. Therefore, the final negotiated level is
1.2. The offering MTSI is expecting receiving H.264 RTP packets of resolution
320x240 with payload type number either 99 or 100, while the answering MTSI is
expecting receving H.264 RTP packets of resolution 320x240 with payload type
number 99.
## A.4.5 H.264 with asymmetric video streams
As described in Clause 5.2.2 (Note 5), when a certain level of H.264 (AVC) is
offered using the 'profile-level-id' parameter then the video codec is capable
of receiving a bitstream up to the offered level and the bandwidth offered
with b=AS. This however does not necessarily mean that the H.264 video codec
will produce a bitstream up to the offere level when sending video. An MTSI
client in terminal can use this method to set up asymmetric video streams. One
drawback with using this method is that there is no information in the SDP
that resource reservation functions in the network, e.g. RAN bearer
allocation, could use to allocate transmission resources asymmetrically for
the different directions.
A better method to allocate asymmetric video for H.264 (AVC) is to use the
'level-asymmetry-allowed' and the 'max-recv-level' parameters defined in the
H.264 payload format, [25]. The 'profile-level-id' parameter then defines the
default level while the 'max-recv-level' parameter defines the maximum level
for the receiving direction. With this method, there is codec-specific
information in the SDP that could be used by resource reservation functions to
allocate for example radio bearers in a more optimal way.
The SDP example below shows how a session with asymmetric video can be setup
using these SDP parameters. The SDP offer sets the default level to 1.2 (max
384 kbps). The maximum receive level is set to 3.1 (max 14 Mbps) but is
limited to 2 Mbps using the b=AS bandwidth modifier. The answerer also
declares asymmetric video but using lower levels and bitrates. The default
level is set to 1.1 (max 192 kbps) and receiving direction is limited to level
1.2 (max 384 kbps)

A resource reservation function that only uses the bandwidth information in
the b=AS bandwidth modifiers will probably allocate 416 kbps in both
directions. This means that an overallocation will occur but this does not
present any other problems. The offering MTSI client offers two and three
image sizes for both send and receive directions. A larger size, 1280x720, is
offered only for the receive direction, which has a higher level.
With the 'provile-level-id', 'level-asymmetry-allowed' and the 'max-recv-
level' in the SDP, a codec-aware resource allocation function can take
advantage of this information and allocate transmission resources more
efficiently, e.g. to allocate 192 kbps from the answerer to the offerer and
384 kbps from the offerer to the answerer. From the image sizes offered, the
responding MTSI client included 640x480 for both send and receive directions.
## A.4.6 H.264/AVC with \"imageattr\" attribute for non-CVO operation
In this example the SDP offer includes H.264/AVC with negotiation of the image
size using the "imageattr" attribute allowing for orientation compensation in
case of non-CVO operation (see clause 6.2.3.3 and clause 7.4.5).

The offered codec is H.264/AVC. The packetization-mode parameter indicates
single NAL unit mode. This is the default mode and it is therefore not
necessary to include this parameter (see RFC 6184 [25]). The profile-level-id
parameter indicates Constrained Baseline profile at level 1.2, which supports
bitrates up to 384 kbps. It also indicates, by using so‑called constraint-set
flags, that the bit stream can be decoded by any Baseline, Main or Extended
profile decoder. The bandwidth (including IP, UDP and RTP overhead) for video
is 315 kbps. The third parameter, sprop-parameter-sets, includes base-64
encoded sequence and picture parameter set NAL units that are referred by the
video bit stream. The sequence parameter set used here includes syntax that
specifies the number of re‑ordered frames to be zero so that latency can be
minimized. sprop-parameter-sets is constructed assuming the offered conditions
and image size of 320x240 and 240x320, and contains separate sequence and
picture parameter sets with separate ID for both of the supported image
resolutions in the send direction. In this example there are two Sequence
Parameter Sets (SPS), numbered 0 and 1. SPS 0 has resolution 320x240. SPS 1
has resolution 240x320. There are two Picture Parameter Sets (PPS), numbered 0
and 1. PPS 0 refers to SPS 0. PPS 1 refers to SPS 1. There are four comma-
separated and Base64 encoded NAL units as value for sprop-parameter-sets. The
order in the example is SPS0,PPS0,SPS1,PPS1.
While the offering MTSI client indicates support for CVO operation, it also
offers a couple of image sizes following the format [x,y] and [y,x] for both
send and receive directions which allows for signalling of image rotation by a
change of resolution in the bitstream in case the receiving MTSI client does
not support CVO operation.
An example SDP answer to the offer is given below.

The responding MTSI client is capable of using H.264/AVC. The responding MTSI
client agreed to use a bandwidth of 315 kbps and to use the Constrained
Baseline profile at level 1.2. The responding MTSI client did not agree CVO
operation (removed the extmap attribute) but agreed both offered images sizes
320x240 for both send and receive directions allowing for image rotation
compensation in non-CVO operation. The responding MTSI client sent new sprop-
parameter-sets for the video encoder of the offering MTSI client, which was
constructed assuming the agreed conditions and image sizes.
## A.4.7 H.264 (AVC) and H.265 (HEVC)
### A.4.7.1 MTSI client with 848x480 resolution 5 inch display
This example SDP offer is for an MTSI client with a 5 inch display that
supports 848x480 video and a frame rate of 25 fps. The MTSI client supports
H.264 (AVC) Constrained Baseline Profile (CBP) level 3.1. The MTSI client also
supports H.265 (HEVC) Main Profile, Main tier level 3.1. When encoding video
with H.264 (AVC), the required bandwidth is 690 kbps, including 36 kbps
IPv6/UDP/RTP overhead (3 RTP packets per frame), but when H.265 (HEVC) is
used, the required bandwidth is only 540 kbps, including 36 kbps overhead (3
RTP packets per frame).
Since the SDP offer includes both codecs, then the b=AS bandwidth must be set
to the higher of the bandwidths for those codecs.

The SDP offer includes the image sizes that are supported in sending and
receiving directions. It is recommended to provide codec parameter sets for
each image size in the SDP offer.
Table A.4.17 shows an example SDP answer where the answerer receives the SDP
offer described in Table A.4.16 and accepts using the H.265 (HEVC) codec. The
answerer chooses to use the H.265 (HEVC) codec for increased quality and
therefore sets the bandwidth to the same value as in the SDP offer.

The SDP offer in Table A.4.16 and the SDP answer in Table A.4.17 mean that
symmetric bandwidths are requested with 690 kbps in both directions.
Table A.4.18 shows another example SDP answer where the answerer receives the
SDP offer described in Table A.4.16 and accepts using the H.265 (HEVC) codec.
In this case, the answerer chooses to use the H.265 (HEVC) codec to save
bandwidth and therefore sets the bit-rate to 540 kbps.

The SDP offer in Table A.4.16 and the SDP answer in Table A.4.18 mean that
asymmetric bandwidths are requested. The offerer requested to receive 690 kbps
while the answerer requested to receive 540 kbps. This discrepency however can
be solved by sending a new SDP offer with only the selected codec.
### A.4.7.2 MTSI client with 1280x720 resolution 5 inch display
This example SDP offer is for an MTSI client with a 5 inch display that
supports 1280x720 video and a frame rate of 25 fps. The MTSI client supports
H.264 (AVC) Constrained Baseline Profile (CBP) level 3.1 and H.265 (HEVC) Main
Profile, Main tier level 3.1. When encoding video with H.264 (AVC), the
required bandwidth is 950 kbps, including 48 kbps IPv6/UDP/RTP overhead (4 RTP
packets per frame), but when H.265 (HEVC) is used, the encoder uses only 640
kbps, including 36 kbps overhead (3 RTP packets per frame).
The answerer is also an MTSI client that supports H.264 (AVC) and H.265 (HEVC)
in the same way as the offerer.

The SDP offer includes the image sizes that are supported in sending and
receiving directions.
The answerer could also have chosen to use H.265 (HEVC) to improve the
quality, similar to what is discussed for Table A.4.17. In this case, the
answerer would set the bandwidth to the same value as in the SDP offer.
Another possibility is that the answerer wants to use H.265 (HEVC) partly to
increase the quality and partly to reduce the bit-rate. In this case the
answerer would select a bit-rate that is in-between the bit-rate in the SDP
offer and the bit-rate in the SDP answer as shown in Table A.4.19.
### A.4.7.3 MTSI client with 848x480 resolution 10 inch display
This example SDP offer is for an MTSI client with 10 inch display that
supports 848x480 video and a frame rate of 25 fps. The MTSI client supports
H.264 (AVC) Constrained Baseline Profile (CBP) level 3.1 and H.265 (HEVC) Main
Profile, Main tier level 3.1. When encoding video with H.264 (AVC), the
required bandwidth is 900 kbps, including 48 kbps IPv6/UDP/RTP overhead (4 RTP
packets per frame), but when H.265 (HEVC) is used, the encoder uses only 690
kbps, including 36 kbps of overhead (3 RTP packets per frame).
The answerer is also an MTSI client that supports H.264 (AVC) and H.265 (HEVC)
in the same way as the offerer. The answerer chooses to use the H.265 (HEVC)
codec to save bandwidth and therefore sets the bit-rate to 690 kbps.

The SDP offer includes the image sizes that are supported in sending and
receiving directions.
Similar to the previous examples, the answerer could also have chosen to use
H.265 (HEVC) to improve the quality or to use the codec partly to improve the
quality and partly to reduce the bit-rate.
### A.4.7.4 MTSI client with 1280x720 resolution 10 inch display
This example SDP offer is for an MTSI client with a 10 inch display that
supports 1280x720 video and a frame rate of 25 fps. The MTSI client supports
H.264 (AVC) Constrained Baseline Profile (CBP) level 3.1 and H.265 (HEVC) Main
Profile, Main tier level 3.1. When encoding video with H.264 (AVC), the
required bandwidth is 1060 kbps, including 60 kbps IPv6/UDP/RTP overhead (5
RTP packets per frame), but when H.265 (HEVC) is used, the required bandwidth
is only 800 kbps, including 48 kbps overhead (4 RTP packets per frame).
The answerer is also an MTSI client that supports H.264 (AVC) and H.265 (HEVC)
in the same way as the offerer. The answerer chooses to use the H.265 (HEVC)
codec to save bandwidth and therefore sets the bit-rate to 800 kbps.

The SDP offer includes the image sizes that are supported in sending and
receiving directions.
Similar to the previous examples, the answerer could also have chosen to use
H.265 (HEVC) to improve the quality or to use the codec partly to improve the
quality and partly to reduce the bit-rate.
## A.4.8 H.264 (AVC) and H.265 (HEVC) with asymmetric video streams
This example SDP offer shows how an asymmetric video session can be set up.
The SDP offer is based on the example SDP offer shown in Annex A.4.7.4 (10
inch display, 1280x720 resolution) with modifications to allow for setting up
an asymmetric session where the receive level is higher than the default
level. The following video encoding and decoding capabilities apply:
\- For H.264 (AVC):
\- The Constrained Baseline Profile (CBP) is used.
\- The default level is 1.2, max 384 kbps, as shown with 'profile-level-
id=42e00c'. This is then used for the maximum level in the sending direction
if H.264 (AVC) is accepted by the answerer.
\- The maximum level in the receiving direction is 3.1, as shown with'max-
recv-level=e01f'.
\- Asymmetric session is allowed as shown with 'level-asymmetry-allowed=1'.
\- The maximum bitrate in the receiving direction is limited to 1060 kbps with
'b=AS:1060'.
\- For H.265 (HEVC):
\- The Main Profile is used.
\- The default level is 1.0, max128 kbps, as shown with 'level-id=30'. This is
then used for the maximum level in the sending direction if H.265 (HEVC) is
accepted by the answerer.
\- The maximum level in the receiving direction is 3.1, as shown with 'max-
recv-level-id=93'.
\- Asymmetric session is allowed as shown by including the 'max-recv-level-id'
parameter.
\- The offerer would like to receive max 800 kbps if H.265 (HEVC) is accepted
but there is no possibility to indicate this in the SDP offer.

The SDP offer includes the image sizes that are supported in sending and
receiving directions. Different resolutions are offered by including two RTP
payload types for H.264 (AVC) and H.265 (HEVC), respectively.
For PT=98, the MTSI client in terminal specifies max-recv-level-id=93 since
this is needed for 1280x720 resolution. But for PT=97, it specifies max-recv-
level-id=90 since this is sufficient for 640x480 resolution.
# A.5 SDP offers for text
## A.5.1 T.140 with and without redundancy
An offer to use T.140 real-time text may be realized by using SDP according to
the following example in session setup or for addition of real-time text
during a session.
Table A.5.1: Example SDP offer for T.140 real-time text
+-----------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=============================+ | m=text 53490 RTP/AVP 100 98 | | | | b=AS:2 | | | | b=RS:0 | | | | b=RR:500 | | | | a=rtpmap:100 red/1000/1 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 t140/1000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:100 98/98/98 | +-----------------------------+
The example in table A.5.1 shows that RTP payload type 98 is used for sending
text without redundancy, whereas RTP payload type 100 is used for sending text
with 200 % redundancy. IPv4 addressing is assumed in the computation of
bandwidth values.
# A.6 SDP example with bandwidth information
## A.6.1 General
This clause gives an example where the bandwidth modifiers have been included
in the SDP offer. Clause A.6.2 gives some examples with the b=AS, b=RS and
b=RR bandwidth modifiers. Clause A.6.3 gives some examples where the SDP are
enhanced with the 'a=bw-info' attribute defined in clause 19.

The b=AS value indicates the media bandwidth, excluding RTCP, see RFC 3550,
section 6.2. On session level, the b=AS value indicates the sum of the media
bandwidths, excluding RTCP.
In this example, the bandwidth for RTCP is allocated such that it allows for
sending at least 2 compound RTCP packets per second when AVPF immediate mode
is used. The size of a RTCP Sender Report is estimated to 110 bytes, given
IPv4 and point-to-point sessions. The corresponding bandwidth then becomes
1760 bps which means that compound RTCP packets can be sent a little more
frequently than twice per second.
For speech sessions, the total RTCP bandwidth is set to 4000 bps (2000 bps for
each terminal) to give room for adaptation requests with APP packets according
to clause 10.2 in at least some of the RTCP messages. This adds 16 bytes to
the RTCP packet.
The b=AS of AMR, 30, is set in the media level as the larger of the b=AS for
bandwidth-efficient payload format, 29, and the b=AS for octet-aligned payload
format, 30, with IPv4.
For video, the total RTCP bandwidth is set to 5000 bps (2500 bps for each
terminal) to give room for slightly more frequent reporting and also to give
room for codec-control messages (CCM) [43].
Setting the RS value to 0 does not mean that senders are not allowed to send
RTCP packets. It instead means that sending clients are treated in the same
way as receive-only clients, see also RFC 3556 [42].
The tcap attribute is in this example given on the session level to avoid
repeating it for each media type.
## A.6.3 SDP examples giving additional bandwidth information using the a=bw-
info attribute
The SDP offer in Table A.6.2 below shows an SDP offer for speech where the
MTSI client in terminal include the 'a=bw-info' attribute to signal some
additional bandwidth properties. This example is based on the SDP offer in
Table A.6.1 (only the audio part) with some changes, as described below.
Both AMR and AMR-WB are offered with all codec modes and also with both
bandwidth-efficient and octet-aligned payload format. The MTSI client in
terminal includes the 'a=bw-info' attribute both to show that this attribute
is supported and to suggest suitable bandwidth properties. The assumptions
used for the SDP offer follow the recommendations in clause 6.2.5.2, with the
following description and a few changes:
\- Bandwidth properties for both IPv4 and IPv6 are included. However, the b=AS
bandwidth assumes IPv4.
\- The Maximum Supported Bandwidth property suggests that 100% redundancy
should be possible. The resource allocation in the networks may reduce this,
if needed.
\- The originating MTSI client must set the Maximum Supported Bandwidth and
the Maximum Desired Bandwidth properties for AMR-WB to higher values than what
is described in clause 6.2.5.2 Table 6.10-2 because it is required to offer
all codec modes as described in clause 6.2.2.2 Tables 6.1 and 6.2. This also
means that the b=AS bandwidth needs to be set to a higher value. A network in
the path may however change the offered mode-sets, in which case it should
also modify these bandwidth properties and the b=AS bandwidth.
\- The originating MTSI client can also set the Maximum Supported Bandwidth
and the Maximum Desired Bandwidth properties to the same value since offering
the full mode sets means that redundancy can be used for both AMR and AMR-WB
without allocating any additional bandwidth for this purpose. If a network
changes the offset mode-sets, e.g. to AMR-WB {6.6, 8.85, 12.65} then it should
modify these bandwidth properties correspondingly, and the Maximum Supported
Bandwidth peroperty may then show a higher value than the Maximum Desired
Bandwidth.
\- The Maximum Desired Bandwidth property is based on the maximum codec rates
without redundancy, i.e. AMR 12.2 and AMR 23.85, respectively.
\- If a network changes the offered mode-sets then this bandwidth peroperty
should be modified correspondingly.
\- The Minimum Desired Bandwidth properties are based on AMR 5.9 and AMR-WB
6.6, respectively, without redundancy while still packetizing 1 frame per
packet, as described in clause 6.2.5.2.
\- The Minimum Supported Bandwidth properties are based on AMR 4.75 and AMR-WB
6.6, respectively, without redundancy while packing 4 frames per packet, as
described in clause 6.2.5.2.

**Comments:**
The most relevant lines are highlighted with bold font.
Since the SDP offer describes that the session should be symmetric, the
'sendrecv' directionality is used to reduce the size of the SDP. It would also
have been possible to include separate 'a=bw-info' attribute lines with 'send'
and 'recv', respectively.
The MinDesBw and MinSupBw bandwidths are the same for AMR with bandwidth-
efficient and octet-aligned payload format, which allows for defining them on
one 'a=bw-info' attribute line for both RTP payload types. However, since the
MaxSupBw and MaxDesBw are different for bandwidth-efficient and octet-aligned
payload format these bandwidth properties need to be defined on separate
attribute lines.
The maximum packet rate and minimum packet rate are the same for all payload
types and are therefore defined on separate attribute lines to allow for using
a wildcard. It would also be possible to have one attribute line for each RTP
payload type for these properties but this would in this case be just a waste
of bytes.
The SDP offer in Table A.6.3 below shows an SDP offer for video where the MTSI
client in terminal include the 'a=bw-info' attribute to signal some additional
bandwidth peroperties. This example is based on the SDP offer in Table 6.1
(only the video part) with some changes, as described below. Bandwidth
properties for both IPv4 and IPv6 are included. The conversion factor between
IPv4 and IPv6 bandwidths defined in clause 12.7.5 for the b=AS parameter is
used also for the additional bandwidth properties.
The MTSI client in terminal supports H.264 Constrained Baseline Profile (CBP)
with level 3.1 but video is offered with asymmetric video streams, max 1 Mbps
for the sending direction and max 2 Mbps for the receiving direction. The
maximum bandwidth in the receiving direction can be limited to 2 Mbps with the
b=AS bandwidth modifier. However, the b=AS bandwidth modifier cannot be used
to describe the limitation for the sending direction. The MTSI client in
terminal therefore includes the 'a=bw-info' attribute to able to describe the
limitation also for the sending direction. Since the Maximum Supported
Bandwidth and Maximum Desired Bandwidth properties are different for different
the sending and receiving directions it is necessary to describe them using
two "a=bw-info" attribute lines with directions 'send' and 'recv',
respectively.
The MTSI client in terminal also proposes that the Minimum Desired Bandwidth
and the Minimum Supported bandwidth based on the QoS examples in Annex E.21
for IPv4 (202 kbps) and in Annex E.22 for IPv6 (208 kbps). These bandwidth
properties are the same for both sending and receiving directions, which means
the number of lines can be reduced by using the 'sendrecv' directionality.
Including the 'a=bw-info' also shows to the networks and the remote end-point
that this attribute is supported and that other bandwidth modifiers may be
added, if needed, even though they are not included in the SDP offer.

**Comments:**
The most relevant lines are highlighted with bold font.
The MTSI client in terminal only describes the Maximum Supported Bandwidth and
the Maximum Desired Bandwidth properties.
The Minimum Desired Bandwidth and the Minimum Supported Bandwidth are left
undefined since the MTSI client in terminal can reduce the bitrate virtually
down to zero by reducing the frame rate. Since the 'a=bw-info' attribute is
included in the SDP, the network knows that this attribute is supported and it
can then set these bandwidth properties based on the bearer allocation and/or
operator policies.
The MTSI client in terminal also does not define the maximum and minimum
packet rates. The network can still add these bandwidth properties if needed.

The example in table A.8.1 shows an SDP exchange that reflects the signalling
of negotiated QoS during initial session setup when there is only one PDP
context or EPS bearer for the whole session. The first offer-answer procedure
is initiated by the MTSI client in terminal A at session setup. The responding
MTSI client chose the bandwidth-efficient payload format, by excluding the
octet-align parameter, and reduced the bandwidth in b=AS to 29. The second
offer-answer procedure is initiated by the MTSI client in terminal B when it
receives a different negotiated QoS, only 30 kbps for video, than what was
indicated in the first SDP offer from A. To notify A, B sends a new SDP offer,
in this case embedded in an UPDATE message, to A indicating the lower
negotiated QoS bit rate. The MTSI client in terminal A responds with its
negotiated QoS value to B.
NOTE: The bit rate in the second SDP answer, 48 kbps, was deliberately chosen
to show that this is a fully valid SDP answer even though the second SDP offer
only defines 30 kbps. It is however recommended that the UEs choose the same
bandwidths whenever possible.
The SDP offer in the SIP UPDATE message contains only one encoding format
since the answerer has already removed all but one encoding format in the SDP
answer to the initial SDP offer.
In this example it is assumed that the SDPCapNeg framework is not needed in
the UPDATE since the RTP profile has already been chosen in the initial
invitation.
# A.9 Void
# A.9a SDP offer/answer regarding the use of Reduced-Size RTCP

Comments:
This example allows the use of Reduced-Size RTCP (attribute rtcp-rsize) for
the adaptation feedback. Moreover the minimum interval between two regular
compound RTCP packets is set to 5000 milliseconds.
# A.10 Examples of SDP offers and answers for inter-working with other IMS or
non-IMS IP networks
## A.10.1 General
The session between an MTSI client in a terminal and a client in a remote (IMS
or non-IMS) network can be established in many ways, especially when the
session is initiated by the remote network and when the remote network does
not use the MTSI service.
The SDP will also depend on how and when the MTSI MGW chooses to add
information about what formats (other than AMR and AMR-WB) that can be used
for inter-working. There are, in general, two methods for MTSI MGWs to add
information about the alternative formats. The first method is to add the
alternative formats to the original SDP offer from the initiating client as a
pre-emptive action. The second method is to leave the original SDP offer
unchanged, forward it to the remote network and wait for the answerer to
respond and only add the alternative formats if/when the SDP offer was
rejected. A further complication is that there might be multiple MGWs in the
path for this kind of inter-working and different MGWs might work differently.
The SDP examples included below should therefore be regarded as a few samples
of possible SDPs and should not be regarded as a complete description of what
might occur in a real implementation.
## A.10.2 Session initiated by MTSI client in terminal
### A.10.2.1 SDP offers from an MTSI client in terminal
The MTSI client in terminal could send an SDP offer as shown in Table A.10.1
(narrow-band speech only) or Table A.10.2 (wide-band and narrow-band speech).
Table A.10.1: Original SDP offer from an MTSI client in terminal for narrow-
band speech
+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
This SDP offer is identical to the SDP offer in Table A.1.1.

band and wide-band speech

**Comments:**
This SDP offer is identical to the SDP offer in Table A.1.2.
### A.10.2.2 SDP offers modified by MTSI MGW when pre-emptively adding inter-
working formats
In this example, the MTSI MGW intercepts the SIP INVITE with the original SDP
offer from the MTSI client in terminal and adds the codecs and formats that
are supported for inter-working before forwarding the SDP offer to the remote
network.
When an MTSI MGW pre-emptively adds codecs and formats for inter-working it
will also remove lines that it does not support. These examples show an MTSI
MGW that does not support AVPF nor SDPCapNeg and it will therefore remove the
corresponding lines. The SDP offers could look like the examples included in
Table A.10.3 (narrow-band speech only) and Table A.10.4 (wide-band and narrow-
band speech).
Table A.10.3: SDP offer for narrow-band speech which has been modified by the
MTSI MGW before it is sent to the remote network
+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | Modified SDP offer | +================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 99 100 101 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 PCMA/8000/1 | | | | a=rtpmap:100 PCMU/8000/1 | | | | a=rtpmap:101 L16/8000/1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
The SDP offer from Table A.10.1 has been modified by adding RTP Payload Types
99 (A-law PCM), 100 (μ-law PCM) and 101 (linear 16 bit PCM with 8 kHz sampling
frequency).
The lines "a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF" and "a=pcfg:1 t=1" are removed because the MTSI
MGW does not support AVPF nor SDPCapNeg in this example.
To allow for end-to-end adaptation for AMR and AMR-WB, the MTSI MGW keeps
a=maxptime:240.
If the remote network supports AMR, then the received SDP answer should
contain at least one RTP Payload Type for AMR but there may also be one or
more RTP Payload types for non-AMR codecs. In this case, the MTSI MGW does not
need to perform transcoding and may forward the SDP offer to the MTSI client
in terminal unchanged.
If the SDP answer contains no AMR RTP Payload Type then the MTSI MGW needs to
perform transcoding to and from the format indicated by the remote network. In
this case, the MTSI MGW needs to add AMR to the SDP answer that is sent back
to the MTSI client in terminal.
Table A.10.4: SDP offer for wide-band and narrow-band speech which has been
modified by the MTSI MGW before it is sent to the remote network
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | Modified SDP offer | +=================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 101 102 99 100 103 104 105 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:101 G722/8000/1 | | | | a=rtpmap:102 L16/16000/1 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:100 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:100 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:103 PCMA/8000/1 | | | | a=rtpmap:104 PCMU/8000/1 | | | | a=rtpmap:105 L16/8000/1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
The SDP offer from Table A.10.2 has been modified by adding RTP Payload Types
101 (G.722), 102 (linear 16 bit PCM with 16 kHz sampling frequency), 103
(A-law PCM), 104 (μ-law PCM) and 105 (linear 16 bit PCM with 8 kHz sampling
frequency).
NOTE: The sampling frequency for G.722 is 16 kHz but has been set to 8 kHz in
the SDP because G.722 was (erroneously) assigned this value in the original
version of the RTP A/V profile. Hence, one need to use "8000" for backwards
compatibility reasons, see also [10].
The lines "a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF" and "a=pcfg:1 t=1" are removed because the MTSI
MGW does not support SDPCapNeg (in this example).
To allow for end-to-end adaptation for AMR and AMR-WB, the MTSI MGW keeps
a=maxptime:240.
If the remote network supports AMR-WB or AMR, then the received SDP answer
should contain at least one RTP Payload Type for AMR-WB or AMR but there may
also be one or more RTP Payload Types for non-AMR codecs. In this case, the
MTSI MGW does not need to perform transcoding and can remove the non-AMR RTP
Payload Types before forwarding the SDP answer to the MTSI client in terminal.
If the SDP answer contains no AMR-WB or AMR RTP Payload Type then the MTSI MGW
needs to perform transcoding to and from the format indicated by the remote
network.
### A.10.2.3 SDP modified by MGW when adding inter-working formats only when
the original SDP offer was rejected
In this example, the MTSI MGW either forwards the original SDP offer that was
received from the MTSI client in terminal to the remote network or it is not
involved in the session setup at all until it is concluded that the same
codecs are not supported in the different networks. In this latter case, the
MTSI MGW is invoked only if the remote network rejects the SDP offer.
In this case, when the MTSI MGW sends the (new) SDP offer to the remote
network it knows that the AMR (and AMR-WB) codecs are not supported by the
remote network because the original SDP offer was rejected. It is therefore
unnecessary to include these codecs in the (new) SDP offer. The SDP offers
could look like the examples included in Table A.10.5 (narrow-band speech
only) and Table A.10.6 (wide-band and narrow-band speech).
The remote client may also suggest codecs and configurations when it rejects
the SDP offer. Existence of such information can, of course, be used to
increase the likelihood that the session setup will be successful. These SDP
examples are however designed for the case when no such information is
available from the remote network.
Table A.10.5: New SDP offer for narrow-band speech sent by the MTSI MGW to the
remote network

**Comments:**
The new SDP offer includes RTP Payload Types 99 (A-law PCM), 100 (μ-law PCM)
and 101 (linear 16 bit PCM with 8 kHz sampling frequency).
In this case, the maxptime is set to 80, if the MTSI MGW does not support
redundancy.

Comments:
The new SDP offer includes RTP Payload Types 101 (G.722), 102 (linear 16 bit
PCM with 16 kHz sampling frequency), 103 (A-law PCM), 104 (μ-law PCM) and 105
(linear 16 bit PCM with 8 kHz sampling frequency).
NOTE: The sampling frequency for G.722 is 16 kHz but has been set to 8 kHz in
the SDP because G.722 was (erroneously) assigned this value in the original
version of the RTP A/V profile. Hence, one need to use "8000" for backwards
compatibility reasons, see also [10].
In this case, the maxptime is set to 80, if the MTSI MGW does not support
redundancy.
# A.11 Adding or removing a video component to/from an on-going video call
session
The MTSI client in a terminal can add, remove and modify the media components
during an ongoing MTSI session. This clause describes the SDP offer in the
initial SIP INVITE message, see Table A.11.1, and the SDP in the subsequent
re-INVITE or UPDATE message for adding and removing a video stream to/from the
ongoing MTSI video call session, see Table A.11.2 and Table A.11.3,
respectively. Corresponding SDP answers in the SIP 200/OK responses are also
described.
The initial video call session contains one video component and one speech
component. During the session, the MTSI client in terminal A adds a uni-
directional video component (such as one video clip) to the ongoing video call
session. The SDP content attribute "a=content:main" and "a=content:alt" are
used to label the main and alternative video components respectively [81].
This example does not show how to use the content attribute in combination
with the grouping attribute, nor does it show how to use the content attribute

# A.12 SDP examples when using ECN
## A.12.1 SDP examples when using ECN for speech
### A.12.1.1 With RTP/AVP and zero RTCP bandwidth
The following SDP offer and SDP answer are likely when both MTSI clients in
terminals use ECN for speech.
This SDP example is based on the SDP example found in Table A.3.0 except that
bandwidth information for the media has been added, zero RTCP bandwidth has
been negotiated, and AVPF is not offered.
Table A.12.1.1: SDP example
+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | **SDP offer** | +================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 | | | | b=AS:30 | | | | b=RS:0 | | | | b=RR:0 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ecn-capable-rtp: leap ect=0 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+ | **SDP answer** | +----------------------------------------------------------------+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 99 | | | | b=AS:29 | | | | b=RS:0 | | | | b=RR:0 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=ecn-capable-rtp: leap ect=0 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
The SDP offer includes the SDP attribute 'ecn-capable-rtp' to indicate that
ECN is supported. The SDP offer further includes the parameters: 'leap' to
indicate that the leap-of-faith initiation method is to be used; and 'ect=0'
to request that the other endpoint sets the ECN bits to ECT(0). The SDP offer
does not include the \"rtcp-fb\" attribute for negotiating use of the RTCP
AVPF ECN feedback messages [84]. This results in RTP CMR [28] being used as
the application specific feedback for ECN-triggered adaptation. The SDP offer
also proposes to not use RTCP for the session.
The SDP answer is configured in the same way as in the offer to indicate that
the ECN usage and its configuration is agreeable to be used in the session.
### A.12.1.2 With RTP/AVPF and non-zero RTCP bandwidth
This SDP example is based on the SDP example found in Table A.3.0 except that
bandwidth information for the media has been added. The negotiation of
Reduced-Size RTCP is added together with the ECN negotiation. Non-zero RTCP
bandwidth and AVPF have also been negotiated.

**Comments:**
The SDP offer includes the SDP attribute 'ecn-capable-rtp' to indicate that
ECN is supported. The SDP offer further includes the parameters: 'leap' to
indicate that the leap-of-faith initiation method is to be used; and 'ect=0'
to request that the other endpoint sets the ECN bits to ECT(0). The SDP offer
does not include the \"rtcp-fb\" attribute for negotiating use of the RTCP
AVPF ECN feedback messages [84]. This results in RTCP-APP CMR and reduced-size
RTCP being used as the application specific feedback for ECN-related
adaptation.
The SDP answer is configured in the same way as in the offer to indicate that
the ECN usage and its configuration is agreeable to be used in the session.
### A.12.1.3 With RTCP ECN feedback messages and RTCP XR ECN summary reports
for inter-working with non-MTSI clients
The following SDP offer and SDP answer are possible when an MTSI client is
inter-working with non-MTSI clients and when the MTSI client supports RTCP
AVPF ECN feedback messages and RTCP XR ECN summary reports.
Table A.12.1.3: SDP example
+----------------------------------------------------------------+ | **SDP offer** | +================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | b=AS:30 | | | | b=RS:0 | | | | b=RR:2000 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ecn-capable-rtp: leap ect=0 | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* nack ecn | | | | a=rtcp-xr:ecn-sum | | | | a=rtcp-rsize | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+ | **SDP answer** | +----------------------------------------------------------------+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVPF 99 | | | | a=acfg:1 t=1 | | | | b=AS:29 | | | | b=RS:0 | | | | b=RR:2000 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=ecn-capable-rtp: leap ect=0 | | | | a=rtcp-fb:* nack ecn | | | | a=rtcp-xr:ecn-sum | | | | a=rtcp-rsize | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
The SDP offer is similar to the offer in Table A.12.2. The line "a=rtcp-fb:*
nack ecn" is included to indicate that the RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages can
be used by all payload types for speech. The line "a=rtcp-xr:ecn-sum" is
included to indicate that the RTCP XR ECN summary reports can also be used.
Since the offering MTSI client supports the RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages
and RTCP XR ECN summary reports there is no need to insert any media gateway
in the path to solve inter-working.
## A.12.2 SDP examples when using ECN for video in RTP
### A.12.2.1 Without RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages and RTCP XR ECN summary
reports
The following SDP offer and SDP answer are likely when both MTSI clients in
terminals use ECN for video and TMMBR for rate adaptation.
This SDP example is the same as the SDP example found in Tables A.4.4b and
A.4.4c, except that the negotiation for ECN has been added.

**Comments:**
The SDP offer includes the SDP attribute 'ecn-capable-rtp' to indicate that
ECN is supported. The SDP offer further includes the parameters: 'leap' to
indicate that the leap-of-faith initiation method is to be used; and 'ect=0'
to request that the other endpoint sets the ECN bits to ECT(0).
The SDP offer also includes an offer for AVPF to enable sending adaptation
requests without following the normal rules for RTCP transmission intervals.
TMMBR is also offered to indicate that this can be used for rate adaptation.
The SDP answer is configured in the same way as in the offer to indicate that
the ECN usage and its configuration is agreeable to be used in the session.
### A.12.2.2 With RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages and RTCP XR ECN summary
reports for inter-working with non-MTSI clients
The following SDP offer and SDP answer are possible when an MTSI client is
inter-working with non-MTSI clients not supporting TMMBR and when the MTSI
client supports RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages and RTCP XR ECN summary
reports.
This SDP example is the same as the SDP example found in Tables A.4.4b and
A.4.4c, except that the negotiation for ECN has been added.

**Comments:**
The SDP offer is similar to the offer in Table A.12.2.1. The line "a=rtcp-fb:*
nack ecn" is included to indicate that the RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages can
be used all payload types for video. The line "a=rtcp-xr:ecn-sum" is included
to indicate that the RTCP XR ECN summary reports can also be used.
The answering client does not support TMMBR and full intra requests and
therefore removes these attribute lines when creating the SDP answer.
Since the offering MTSI client supports the RTCP AVPF ECN feedback messages
and RTCP XR ECN summary reports there is no need to insert any media gateway
in the path to provide inter-working.
# A.13 SDP examples for MTSI client in terminal using fixed access
## A.13.1 General
This clause includes SDP examples that may be applicable to an MTSI client in
terminal using fixed access. The SDP examples in Annex A.13.2 to A.13.6 show
SDPs including PCM, G.729, G.722 and G.729.1. Examples of SDP offers for the
AMR and AMR-WB codecs are described in Annex A.1 and the corresponding
examples of SDP answers are found in Annex A.3. SDP examples for EVRC, EVRC-B
and EVRC-WB are found in [97].
Examples of SDP offer and answer for video are described in Annex A.4.
An example for an SDP offer for real-time text is described in Annex A.5.
These examples also include bandwidth information which is calculated assuming
IPv6 and 20 ms packetization.
## A.13.2 SDP examples for PCM
Table A.13.1 shows an example for the SDP offer and answer negotiation for
PCM. The SDP offer uses the static payload type numbers that are defined in
RFC 3551 [10] for PCM, i.e. payload type number 0 for μ-law PCM and payload
type number 8 for A-law PCM, see also Clause 18.4.3. Since static payload type
numbers are used, as shown on the m= line, then there is no need for adding
any a=rtpmap attribute lines. The answerer chooses to accept A-law PCM and
therefore sends an SDP answer with RTP payload type number 8 on the m= line.
Table A.13.1: SDP example for PCM
+---------------------------+ | SDP offer | +===========================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 0 8 | | | | b=AS:88 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +---------------------------+ | SDP answer | +---------------------------+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 8 | | | | b=AS:88 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +---------------------------+
**Comments:**
The SDPs further describe that the clients prefer to receive speech with 20 ms
packetization (ptime is set to 20) but up to 240 ms packetization is allowed.
Table A.13.2 shows an example for how the PCM codec can be negotiated using
dynamic payload type numbers. In this case, payload type number 96 is used for
μ-law PCM and payload type number 97 is used for A-law PCM. The answerer
chooses to accept μ-law PCM.
Table A.13.2: SDP example for PCM
+-----------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=============================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 96 97 | | | | b=AS:88 | | | | a=rtpmap:96 PCMU/8000/1 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 PCMA/8000/1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------+ | SDP answer | +-----------------------------+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 96 | | | | b=AS:88 | | | | a=rtpmap:96 PCMU/8000/1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------+
**Comments:**
This example is included here to show that it is possible to use dynamic
payload type numbers also for codecs for which static payload type numbers
have been defined. It is however preferable to use static payload type
numbers, see Clause 18.4.3.
## A.13.3 SDP example for G.722
Table A.13.3 shows an example for how G.722 can be negotiated using the static
payload type number (9) defined in RFC 3551 [10], see also Clause 18.4.3.
Table A.13.3: SDP example for G.722
+-------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=========================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 9 | | | | b=AS:88 | | | | a=rtpmap:9 G722/8000/1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-------------------------+ | SDP answer | +-------------------------+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 9 | | | | b=AS:88 | | | | a=rtpmap:9 G722/8000/1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-------------------------+
**Comments:**
The G.722 codec uses an RTP clock rate of 8 kHz even though G.722 is a
wideband speech codec that uses a sampling frequency of 16 kHz. This means
that the RTP Time Stamp is sampled with 8 kHz.
The SDPs further describe that the clients prefer to receive speech with 20 ms
packetization (ptime is set to 20) but up to 240 ms packetization is allowed.
## A.13.4 SDP example for EVS, AMR-WB, G.722, AMR, PCM and DTMF
Table A.13.4 shows an example where an MTSI client in terminal using fixed
access has been developed to support fixed-mobile interworking without the
need for transcoding in a media gateway. It therefore supports the G.722 and
PCM codecs that are normally used in fixed networks. In addition, it also
supports the AMR-WB and AMR codecs in the same way as an MTSI client in
terminal using mobile access would do. The SDP offer includes all these codecs

**Comments:**
The wideband codecs (AMR-WB and G.722) are listed as preferred over the
narrowband codecs (AMR and PCM). This ensures that a wideband service will be
set up whenever possible.
The AMR and AMR-WB codecs are listed here as preferred over the PCM and G.722
codecs, respectively, because of their lower bitrate and also because of their
bitrate adaptation capabilities.
The SDP offer includes DTMF with both 8 kHz and 16 kHz RTP clock rate since
there are codecs with both clock rates in the offer. An answerer is expected
to accept the DTMF variant that has the same clock rate as for the accepted
codec. This means that when G.722 is accepted then DTMF with 8 kHz clock rate
should also be accepted, even though G.722 is a wideband speech codec. This is
because G.722 uses 8 kHz clock rate, see RFC3551 [10].
Since the clock rate of EVS is set to 16 kHz, regardless of the bandwidth in
the session, DTMF with 16 kHz RTP clock rate should be accepted when EVS is
accepted.
# A.14 SDP offers and answers for speech sessions with EVS
These examples show SDP offers and answers for speech sessions where EVS is
negotiated. These SDP offer and answer examples are designed to highlight the
respective area that is being described and should therefore not be considered
as complete SDP offers and answers.
## A.14.1 SDP offers initiated by MTSI client in terminal
The SDP offers below can be used by MTSI client in terminal, depending on the
access technology or the number of audio channels.
### A.14.1.1 Unknown access technology
When the access technology is unknown to MTSI client in terminal, the SDP
offer below can be used to initiate a speech session. In this example, RTP
Payload Type 97 is defined for EVS, and two sets of RTP Payload Types, 98 and
99, and 100 and 101 are defined for AMR-WB and AMR respectively.
Table A.14.1: SDP example
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 99 100 101 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | b=AS:145 | | | | b=RS:0 | | | | b=RR:2000 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 EVS/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:100 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:100 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:101 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:101 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
Since the MTSI client in terminal is not aware of the access technology it
uses, all bit-rates of EVS are offered in the session.
The MTSI client in terminal supports all bandwidths, up to fullband.
Regardless of the bandwidth used in the session, clock rate of EVS shall be
set to 16 kHz.
Media level b=AS is computed for the highest bit-rate of EVS, 128 kbps, with
IPv4 and Header-full payload format, which is greater than the b=AS values of
other RTP Payload Types.
### A.14.1.2 EGPRS
When the access technology is EGPRS, the SDP offer below can be used to
initiate a speech session. In this example, RTP Payload Type 97 is defined for
EVS, and two sets of RTP Payload Types, 98 and 99, and 100 and 101 are defined
for AMR-WB and AMR respectively.
Table A.14.2: SDP example
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 99 100 101 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | b=AS:33 | | | | b=RS:0 | | | | b=RR:2000 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 EVS/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 br=5.9-24.4; bw=nb-wb; max-red=200 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=200 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=200; octet-align=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:100 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:100 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=200 | | | | a=rtpmap:101 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:101 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=200; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:40 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
It is assumed that the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) of EGPRS used in
this session is MCS-7 [132] or higher, which supports at least 44.8 kbps. The
bit-rate available for data will be reduced further from the overhead for RLC
and MAC headers.
All bit-rates of EVS from 5.9 (SC-VBR) to 24.4 kbps are offered in the
session.
The MTSI client in terminal supports narrowband and wideband.
Media level b=AS is computed for 24.4 kbps of EVS with Header-full payload
format, or for 23.85 which results in a b=AS value of 33 kbps. MCS lower than
MCS-7 would necessitate the use of mode-set parameter for AMR-WB as MCS-6
supports only 29.6 kbps. However, higher MCS values would leave lower overhead
for channel coding.
### A.14.1.3 E-UTRAN/HSPA
When the access technology is E-UTRAN or HSPA, the SDP offer below can be used
to initiate a speech session. In this example, RTP Payload Type 97 is defined
for EVS, and two sets of RTP Payload Types, 98 and 99, and 100 and 101 are
defined for AMR-WB and AMR respectively.
Table A.14.3: SDP example
+-----------------------------------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=================================================================+ | m=audio 49152 RTP/AVP 97 98 99 100 101 | | | | a=tcap:1 RTP/AVPF | | | | a=pcfg:1 t=1 | | | | b=AS:42 | | | | b=RS:0 | | | | b=RR:2000 | | | | a=rtpmap:97 EVS/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:97 br=5.9-24.4; bw=nb-swb; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:98 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:98 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:99 AMR-WB/16000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:99 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=rtpmap:100 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:100 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220 | | | | a=rtpmap:101 AMR/8000/1 | | | | a=fmtp:101 mode-change-capability=2; max-red=220; octet-align=1 | | | | a=ptime:20 | | | | a=maxptime:240 | +-----------------------------------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
It is assumed that 42 kbps is reserved for speech by the radio access
technology.
All bit-rates of EVS from 5.9 (SC-VBR) to 24.4 kbps are offered in the
session.
The MTSI client in terminal supports all bandwidths, up to super-wideband.

format.
### A.14.1.4 Dual-mono
When dual-mono is offered, the SDP offer below can be used to initiate a
speech session. In this example in Table A.14.4a, RTP Payload Types 97 and 98
are defined for EVS, and two sets of RTP Payload Types, 99 and 100, and 101
and 102 are defined for AMR-WB and AMR respectively.

**Comments:**
It is assumed that 50 kbps is reserved for speech by the radio access
technology.
Dual-mono session consisting of two 16.4 kbps SWB channels is offered for the
send and the receive directions.
In addition, all bit-rates of EVS from 5.9 (SC-VBR) to 24.4 kbps are offered
in the session. Channel-aware mode is disabled in the session for the
receiving direction.
Media level b=AS is computed for a dual-mono session including 16.4 kbps of
EVS with IPv4 and Header-full payload format which results in a b=AS value of
50 kbps.
In the example in Table A.14.4b, RTP Payload Types 97 and 98 are defined for
EVS, and two sets of RTP Payload Types, 99 and 100, and 101 and 102 are
defined for AMR-WB and AMR respectively.

**Comments:**
It is assumed that 66 kbps is reserved for speech by the radio access
technology.
Dual-mono session consisting of two NB-SWB channels is offered for the send
and the receive directions. All bit-rates of EVS from 13.2 to 24.4 kbps are
offered in the session. Partial redundancy (channel-aware mode) is used at the
start of the session for the receive direction.
Media level b=AS is computed for a dual-mono session including 24.4 kbps of
EVS with IPv4, Header-full payload format which results in a b=AS value of 66
kbps.
## A.14.2 SDP offers initiated by media gateway
The SDP offer below can be used by media gateway.
### A.14.2.1 Network between MTSI using fixed access and MTSI modifying SDP
offer to configure EVS AMR-WB IO mode
This example shows the SDP offer when the session is initiated from MTSI
client in terminal using fixed access, which supports AMR (all modes) and AMR-
WB (all modes). In addition, EVS, G.722, and PCM codecs are supported by the
MTSI client in terminal.
The offers for AMR, AMR-WB and EVS codecs are changed by the network to
include AMR {12.2, 7.4, 5.9, 4.75}, AMR-WB {12.65, 8.85, 6.60}, EVS AMR-WB IO
{12.65, 8.85, 6.60}. For payload type 98, the network also changes the offer
to start the session with EVS in EVS AMR-WB IO mode if it is agreed to use the
codec.
For EVS, RTP Payload Types 97 and 98 are defined, for example, to initiate a
speech session with another MTSI client in terminal using fixed access
supporting a bit-rate of 64 kbps or radio access supporting all bit-rates from
5.9 to 24.4 kbps respectively.
The MTSI client in terminal does not include the evs-mode-switch parameter in
the initial SDP offer, see Table 6.2a. The SDP is instead changed by the
network.

**Comments:**
For EVS, narrowband and wideband are supported for Payload Type 98 while only
wideband is supported for Payload Type 97.
If Payload Type 97 is negotiated, EVS Primary mode will be used at the start
or update of the session, at 64 kbps wideband. EVS AMR-WB IO mode can be used
in the middle of session, which can be switched by the sender, or the receiver
with CMR.
If Payload Type 98 is negotiated, EVS AMR-WB IO mode will be used at the start
or update of the session, at 6.60, 8.85, or 12.65 kbps.

**Comments:**
The SDP answer contains a dual-mono session consisting of two 16.4 kbps SWB
channels for the send direction, and a mono session consisting of 24.4 kbps
for the receive direction, with IPv4.
In the usage of the channels parameter, "/n," n represents the number of audio
channels, see [125].
'ch-send=2' indicates that the answerer will include two audio channels (dual-
mono) in the RTP packets in the sending direction, see Clause 7.5.2.1.9. 'ch-
recv=1' indicates that the answerer expects that only one audio channel will
be included in the RTP packets in the receiving direction.
### A.14.3.9 SDP answer from MTSI client in terminal when SC-VBR is negotiated
In this example, the MTSI client in terminal includes narrowband and wideband
speech in the SDP answer. This SDP answer is used to negotiate the lowest
possible bit-rate of EVS Primary, for example, due to limited network
capacity.

**Comments:**
Media level b=AS of SC-VBR is computed for the b=AS of its highest component
bit-rate, 8 kbps. Therefore br=5.9, 5.9-7.2, and 5.9-8 result in the same b=AS
value of 25, with IPv4.
If frame aggregation is not used, no codec mode of EVS AMR-WB IO other than
6.6 kbps can be used at this b=AS value, whether mode-set is included or not,

###### ## Annex B (informative): Examples of adaptation scenarios
# B.1 Video bitrate adaptation
It is recommended in clauses 7.3.3 and 10.3 that a video sender adapts its
video output rate based on RTCP reports and TMMBR messages. The following
examples illustrate the usage:
EXAMPLE 1 -- Handover to a different cell:
1\. A video session is established at 100kbps. 5kbps is allocated for RTCP and
trr-int is set to 500 ms. This allows an MTSI client in terminal to send
regular RTCP reports with an average 500 ms interval consuming less than 5
kbps for RTCP. At the same time it allows the MTSI client in terminal to send
an early RTCP packet and then send the next one already after 800 ms instead
of after 1 000 ms.
2\. The receiver is now subject to a reduced bandwidth, e.g. 60 kbps, due to
handover to a different cell. The network indicates the reduced bandwidth to
the receiver. The receiver generates a TMMBR message to inform the sender of
the new maximum bitrate, 60 kbps.
3\. The sender receives the TMMBR message, adjusts its output bitrate and
sends a TMMBN message back.
4\. The receiver sends a SIP UPDATE message to the sender indicating 60 kbps
5\. The receiver travels into an area with full radio coverage. A new
bandwidth of 100 kbps is negotiated with the network. It sends a SIP UPDATE
message for 100 kbps.
6\. The sender receives the SIP UPDATE message, and adjusts its output
bitrate.
EXAMPLE 2 -- Bad coverage or congestion:
1\. A video session is established at 100kbps. 5kbps is allocated for RTCP and
trr-int is set to 500 ms. This allows an MTSI client in terminal to send
regular RTCP reports with an average 500 ms interval consuming less than 5
kbps for RTCP. At the same time it allows the MTSI client in terminal to send
an early RTCP packet and then send the next one already after 800 ms instead
of after 1 000 ms.
2\. The receiver detects congestion and estimates a preferred video
transmission rate of e.g. 60 kbps. The receiver generates a TMMBR message to
inform the sender of the new maximum bitrate, 60 kbps.
3\. The sender receives the TMMBR message, adjusts its output bitrate and
sends a TMMBN message back.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Example adaptation mechanisms for speech
# C.1 Example of feedback and adaptation for speech and video
## C.1.1 Introduction
This annex gives the outline of possible example adaptation implementations
that make use of adaptation signalling for speech as described in section
10.2. Several different adaptation implementations are possible and the
examples shown in this section are not to be seen as a set of different
adaptive schemes excluding other designs. Implementers are free to use these
examples or to use any other adaptation algorithms. The examples are based on
measuring the packet loss rate (PLR) but Annex C.1.3.1 describes how the
measured frame loss rate (FLR) can be used instead of the PLR. A real
implementation is free to use other adaptation triggers. The purpose of the
section is to show a few different examples of how receiver state machines can
be used both to control the signalling but also to control the signalling
requests. Notice that the MTSI clients can have different implementations of
the adaptation state machines.
The annex is divided into three sections:
\- Signalling considerations - Implementation considerations on the signalling
mechanism; the signalling state machine.
\- Adaptation state machines - Three different examples of adaptation state
machines either using the full set of adaptation dimensions or a subset
thereof.
\- Other issues and solutions - Default actions and lower layer triggers.
In this annex, a _media receiver_ is the receiving end of the media flow,
hence the _request sender_ of any adaptation request. A _media sender_ is the
sending entity of the media, hence the _request receiver_ of the adaptation
request. The three different adaptation mechanisms available; bit-rate,
packet-rate and error resilience, represents different ways to adapt to
current transport characteristics:
\- Bit-rate adaptation. Reducing the bit-rate is in all examples shown in this
section the first action done whenever a measurement indicating that action is
needed to further optimize the session quality. A bit-rate reduction will
reduce the utilization of the network resources to transmit the data. In the
radio case, this would reduce the required transmission power and free
resources either for more data or added channel coding. It is reasonable to
assume, also consistent with a proper behaviour on IP networks, that a
reduction of bit-rate is a valid first measure to take whenever the transport
characteristics indicate that the current settings of the session do not
provide an optimized session quality.
\- Packet-rate adaptation. In some of the examples, packet-rate adaptation is
a second measure available to further adapt to the transport characteristics.
A reduction of packet rate will in some cases improve the session quality,
e.g. in transmission channels including WLAN. Further, a reduction of packet
rate will also reduce the protocol overhead since more data is encapsulated
into each RTP packet. Although robust header compression (RoHC) can reduce the
protocol overhead over the wireless link, the core network will still see the
full header and for speech data, it consists of a considerable part of the
data transmitted. Hence, packet-rate adaptation serves as a second step in
reducing the total bit-rate needed for the session.
\- Error resilience. The last adaptive measure in these examples is the use of
error resilience measures, or explicitly, application level redundancy.
Application level redundancy does not reduce the amount of bits needed to be
transmitted but instead transmit the data in a more robust way. Application
level redundancy should only be seen as a last measure when no other
adaptation action has succeeded in optimizing the session quality sufficiently
well. For most normal use cases, application level redundancy is not foreseen
to be used, rather it serves as the last resort when the session quality is
severely jeopardized.
## C.1.2 Signalling state considerations
The control of the adaptation signalling can by itself be characterized as a
state machine. The implementation of the state machine is in the decoder and
each MTSI client has its own implementation. The decoder sends requests as
described in clause 10.2 to the encoder in the other end.
The requests that are transmitted can be queued up in a send buffer to be
transmitted the next time an RTCP-APP packet is to be sent. Hence, a sender
might receive one, two or all three receiver requests at the same time. It
should not expect any specific order of the requests. A receiver shall not
send multiple requests of the same type in the same RTCP-APP packet.
Transmission of the requests should preferably be done immediately using the
AVPF early mode but in some cases it may be justified to delay the
transmission a limited time or until the next DTX period in order to minimize
disturbance on the RTP stream, in the latter case monitoring of the RTP stream
described below must take the additional delay into account.
To summarize:
\- A request can be sent immediately (alone in one RTCP-APP packet) but the
subsequent RTCP-APP packet must follow the transmission rules for RTCP.
\- RTCP-APP packets may be delayed until the next DTX period.
Reception of the transmitted RTCP-APP packets is not guaranteed. Similar to
the RTP packets, the RTCP packets might be lost due to link losses. Monitoring
that the adaptation requests are followed can to be done by means of
inspection of the received RTP stream.
For various reasons the requests might not be followed even though they
received successfully by the other end. This behaviour can be seen in the
following ways:
\- Request completely ignored: An example is a request for 1 frame/packet
which might be rejected as the MTSI client decides that the default mode of
operation 2 frames/packet or more and a frame aggregation reduction compared
to the default state is not allowed.
\- Request partially followed: An example here is when no redundancy is
received and a request for 100 % redundancy with 1 extra frame offset is made
which may be realized by the media sender as 100 % redundancy with no extra
offset. Another example is when a request for 5.9 kbps codec rate is sent and
it is realized as e.g. 6.7 kbps codec rate. Table C.1 displays how the
requests and realizations are grouped. E.g. it can be seen (if Ninit =1) that
a request for 3 frames per packets realized as 2 frames per packet is
considered to be fulfilled.
Table C.1: Distinction of different settings for frame aggregation,\
redundancy and codec mode settings
Codec rate Frame aggregation Redundancy
* * *
Highest rate in mode set N~init~ frame per packet No redundancy All other
codec rates ≥ N~init~+1 frames per packet ≥ 100 % redundancy , arbitrary
offset
In table C.1 above N~init~ is 1 in most cases which corresponds to 1 frame per
packet. In certain cases N~init~ might have another value, one such example is
E-GPRS access where N~init~ may be 2. N~init~ is given by the ptime SDP
attribute.
Note that special care in the monitoring should be taken when DTX is used as
DTX SID update packets are normally not aggregated or transmitted redundant.
Important is also that it takes at least one roundtrip before the effect of a
request is seen in the RTP flow, if transmission of RTCP is delayed due to
e.g. bandwidth requirements this extra delay must also be taken into account
in the monitoring.
If the requests are not followed as requested, the request should not be
repeated infinitely as it will increase the total bit-rate without clear
benefit. In order to avoid such behaviour the following recommendations apply:
\- Partially fulfilled requests should be considered as obeyed.
\- If a new request is not fulfilled within T_RESPONSE ms, the request is
repeated again with a delay between trials of 2*T_RESPONSE ms. If the three
attempts have been made without sender action, it should be assumed that the
request cannot be fulfilled. In this case, the adaptation state machine will
stay in the previous state or in a state that matches the current properties
(codec mode, redundancy, frame aggregation). Any potential mismatch between
define states in the adaptation state machine and the current properties of
the media stream should resolved by the request sender.
\- The default mode of operation for a MTSI client if the RTCP bandwidth for
the session is greater than zero is that the requests received should be
followed. Ignoring requests should be avoided as much as possible. However, it
is required that any signalling requests are aligned with the agreed session
parameters in the SDP.
In some cases the adaptation state machine may go out-of-synch with the
received RTP stream. Such cases may occur if e.g. the other MTSI client makes
a reset. These special cases can be sensed, e.g. through a detection of a
large gap in timestamp and/or sequence number. The state machine should then
reset to the default state and start over again.
The signalling state machine has three states according to table C.2.
Table C.2: Signalling state machine states
State Description
* * *
T1 Idle state: This is the default state of the signalling state machine. The
signalling state should always return here after a state transition and when
it has been detected that the media sender has followed the request, either
completely or partially. The signalling state machine remains in this state as
long as the selected adaptation is \"stable\", i.e. as long as the adaptation
measures are appropriate for the current operating conditions. When it has
been detected that the operating conditions has changed so much that the
current adaptation measures are no longer appropriate then the adaptation
function triggers a request signalling and the signalling state machine goes
to state T2. T2 In this state, the received RTP stream is monitored to verify
that the properties of a given adaptation state (redundancy, frame aggregation
and codec mode) are detected in the received RTP stream. If necessary, some of
the requests are repeated maximum 3 times. If any of the properties is
considered to be not fulfilled, the signalling state machine enters state T3.
T3 In this state, the properties of the RTP stream (redundancy, frame
aggregation and codec rate) is reverted back to the properties of the last
successful state and a new state transition is tested in T2, or alternatively
the adaptation state is set to the state that matches the current properties
(codec mode, redundancy, frame aggregation).

adaptation state transitions
## C.1.3 Adaptation state machine implementations
### C.1.3.1 General
The example adaptation state machines shown in this section are different
realizations of the control algorithm for the adaptation requests. Note that
this does not include how the actual signalling should be done but how various
triggers will result in the transmission of different requests.
The example adaptation state machines make use of the signalling state machine
outlined in clause B.2. Common to all adaptation state machines is that it is
possible to implement all versions in the same code and just exclude
appropriate states depending on desired mode of operation. All examples can
transit between a number of states (denoted S1...S4). In these examples, it is
assumed that the codec is AMR-NB and that it uses two coding rates (AMR 12.2
and AMR 5.9). However, this is not a limitation of the adaptation mechanism by
itself. It is only the scenario used in these examples.
Since the purpose of the adaptation mechanism is to improve the quality of the
session, any adaptation signalling is based upon some trigger; either a
received indication or a measurement. In the case of a measurement trigger, it
is important to gather reliable statistics. This requires a measurement period
which is sufficiently long to give a reliable estimation of the channel
quality but also sufficiently short to enable fast adaptation. For typical
MTSI scenarios on 3GPP accesses, a measurement period in the order of 100
packets is recommended. Further, in order to have an adaptation control which
is reliable and stable, a hangover period is needed after a new state has been
entered (typically 100 to 200 packets). An even longer hangover period is
suitable when transiting from an error resilient state or a reduced rate into
the default, normal state. In the below examples, it is assumed that the
metric used in the adaptation is the packet loss rate measured on the
application layer. It is possible to use other metrics such as lower layer
channel quality metrics.
Note that mode change requests must follow the rules outlined in clause 5.2.1.
The example solution is designed based on the following assumptions:
\- When the packet loss rate increases, the adaptation should:
\- First try with a lower codec mode rate, i.e. bit-rate back off.
\- If this does not improve the situation, then one should try with packet
rate back-off by increasing the frame aggregation.
\- If none of these methods help, then application layer redundancy should be
added to save the session.
\- When the packet loss rate increases, one should try to increase the bit
rate in a \"safe\" manner. This is done by probing for higher bit rates by
adding redundancy.
\- The downwards adaptation, towards lower rates and redundancy, should be
fast while the upwards adaptation should be slow.
\- Hysteresis should be used to avoid oscillating behaviour between two
states.
A description of the different states and what trigger the transition into the
respective state is given in table C.3.
Table C.3: Adaptation state machine states and their meaning
+-------+-------------------------------------------------------------+ | State | Description | +=======+=============================================================+ | S1 | Default/normal state: Good channel conditions. | | | | | | This state has the properties: | | | | | | > • Codec rate: Highest mode in mode set. | | | > | | | > • Frame aggregation: Equal to the ptime value in the | | | > agreed session parameters. | | | > | | | > • Redundancy: 0%. | +-------+-------------------------------------------------------------+ | S2 | In this state the encoding bit-rate and the packet rate is | | | reduced. The state is divided into 2 sub states (S2a and | | | S2b). In state S2a the codec rate is reduced and in state | | | S2b the packet rate is also reduced (the frame aggregation | | | is increased). State S2a may also involve a gradual | | | decrease of the codec-rate in order to be in agreement with | | | the session parameters. If no restrictions are in place | | | regarding mode changes (i.e. such as only allowing changing | | | to a neighbouring mode), it changes bit-rate to the target | | | reduced bit-rate directly. If restrictions are in place, | | | several mode changes might be needed. | | | | | | This state has the properties: | | | | | | > • Codec rate: Any codec rate except the highest rate in | | | > mode set, preferably a codec rate that is roughly half | | | > the highest rate. | | | > | | | > • Frame aggregation: | | | > | | | > o S2a: Equal to the ptime value in the agreed session | | | > parameters. | | | > | | | > o S2b: ptime+N*20ms where N > 1, limited by max-ptime. | | | > | | | > • Redundancy: 0%. | +-------+-------------------------------------------------------------+ | S3 | This is an interim state where the total bit-rate and | | | packet rate is roughly equal to state S1. 100% redundancy | | | is used with a lower codec mode than S1. This is done to | | | probe the channel band-width with a higher tolerance to | | | packet loss to determine if it is possible to revert back | | | to S1 without significantly increase the packet loss rate. | | | | | | This state has the properties: | | | | | | > • Codec rate: Any codec rate except the highest rate in | | | > mode set, preferably a codec rate that is roughly half | | | > the highest rate, target total rate (with redundancy) | | | > should be roughly the same as in S1. | | | > | | | > • Frame aggregation: Equal to the ptime value in the | | | > agreed session parameters. | | | > | | | > • Redundancy: 100%. | +-------+-------------------------------------------------------------+ | S4 | In this state the encoding bit-rate is reduced (the same | | | bit-rate as in S2) and redundancy is turned on. Optionally | | | also the packet rate is kept the same as in state S2. | | | | | | This state has the properties: | | | | | | > • Codec rate: Any codec rate except the highest rate in | | | > mode set, preferably a codec rate that is roughly half | | | > the highest rate. | | | > | | | > • Frame aggregation: Equal to the ptime value in the | | | > agreed session parameters. | | | > | | | > • Redundancy: 100%, possibly with offset. | +-------+-------------------------------------------------------------+
The parameters and other definitions controlling the behaviour of the
adaptation state machine are described in table C.4. Example values are also
shown, values which give good performance on a wide range of different channel
conditions.

As described in Annex C.1.1, the frame loss rate (FLR) can be used instead of
the packet loss rate to trigger the adaptation. The benefit with using FLR is
that this metric can (and should) include the late losses that occur if frames
are received too late to be useful for decoding. Table C.4a shows thresholds
that can be used for FLR if the FLR-triggered adaptation is used instead of
the PLR-triggered adaptation.

frame losses in the last 20 frames. Replaces packet loss burst
The adaptation state machines shown in Annex C.1.3.2, C.1.3.3 and C.1.3.4 can
be used also for FLR-triggered adaptation by applying the following
modifications:
\- The media receiver needs to measure the frame loss rate instead of the
packet loss rate. The frame loss rate includes late losses.
\- The PLR thresholds need to be replaced with the corresponding FLR
thresholds, as shown in Table C.4a.
The state machines are otherwise the same.
### C.1.3.2 Adaptation state machine with four states
The first example utilizes all adaptation possibilities, both in terms of
possible states and transitions between the states. Figure C.2 shows the
layout of the adaptation state machine and the signalling used in the
transitions between the states.
Figure C.2: State diagram for four-state adaptation state machine
**State transitions:**
Below are listed the possible state transitions and signalling that is
involved. Note that the state can go from S1 to either S2 or state S4, this is
explained below:
Table C.5: State transitions for four-state adaptation state machine
+------------------+--------------------------------------------------+ | State transition | Conditions and actions | +==================+==================================================+ | S1 S2a | Condition: Packet loss ≥ PLR_1 or packet loss | | | burst detected.\ | | | A request to reduce the encoding bit-rate is | | | sent using RTCP_APP_CMR, e.g. change mode from | | | AMR 12.2 to AMR 5.9. | +------------------+--------------------------------------------------+ | S2a S2b | Condition: Packet loss ≥ PLR_1. | | | | | | This state transition occurs if the packet loss | | | is still high despite the reduction in codec | | | rate. A request is sent to reduce the packet | | | rate is reduced by means of an | | | RTCP_APP_REQ_AGG message. | +------------------+--------------------------------------------------+ | S2b S2a | Condition: Packet loss ≤ PLR_ 2 for N_HOLD | | | consecutive measurement periods. | | | | | | This state transition involves an increase of | | | the packet rate restoring it to the same value | | | as in S1. The request transmitted is | | | RTCP_APP_REQ_AGG. If the state transition | | | S2bS2aS2b occurs in sequence, the state will be | | | locked to S2b for N_INHIBIT frames to avoid | | | state oscillation. | +------------------+--------------------------------------------------+ | S2a S3 | Condition: Packet loss ≤ PLR_2 for N_HOLD | | | consecutive measurement periods. | | | | | | A request to turn on 100% redundancy is | | | transmitted by means of request | | | RTCP_APP_REQ_RED. | +------------------+--------------------------------------------------+ | S3 S2a | Condition: Packet loss ≥ PLR_3. | | | | | | Same actions as in transition from, S1S2a. If | | | the transition S2aS3S2aS3S2a occurs, the S3 is | | | disabled for N_INHIBIT frames. | +------------------+--------------------------------------------------+ | S3 S1 | Condition: Packet loss ≤ PLR_2 for N_HOLD | | | consecutive measurement periods. | | | | | | A request to turn off redundancy is transmitted | | | as RTCP_APP _REQ_RED. Encoding bit-rate is | | | increased by means of RTCP_APP_CMR. | +------------------+--------------------------------------------------+ | S2b S4 | Condition: Packet loss ≥ PLR_3. | | | | | | A request to turn on 100% redundancy is | | | transmitted by means of request | | | RTCP_APP_REQ_RED. The packet rate is restored | | | to same value as in S1 using RTCP_APP | | | _REQ_AGG. | +------------------+--------------------------------------------------+ | S4 S2b | Condition: | | | | | | 1. If the previous transition was S2bS4 and | | | packet loss ≥ to 4*PLR@ S2bS4 (packet loss | | | considerably increased since transition to state | | | S4).\ | | | This is indicative of that the total bit-rate is | | | too high and that it is probably better to | | | transmit with a lower packet rate/bit-rate | | | instead. This case might occur if the packet | | | loss is high in S2a due to a congested link, a | | | switch to redundant mode S4 will then increase | | | the packet loss even more | | | | | | 2. If previous transition was S1S4 and packet | | | loss >= PLR_4.\ | | | This transition is made to test if a | | | bitrate/packet rate reduction is better. | +------------------+--------------------------------------------------+ | S4 S1 | Condition: Packet loss \ is the Round-Trip Time;
and: is the time needed to detect if congestion occurs, see Figure C.8.
The corresponding worst case excess delay () due to excess_bits equals:
(C.2.5-2)
where: is the average throughput as measured by the receiver.
Therefore, if the receiver determines the amount of allowable excess delay ()
from the received video packets, it can calculate the amount of rate increase
that would not congest the system as:
(C.2.5-3)
Since the one-way delay from sender to receiver is generally unknown to the
receiver, it cannot use this to calculate the allowable excess delay. Instead
the receiver measures the amount of time between when a packet arrives and
when it is scheduled to be played out to determine how much additional delay
is acceptable. This metric is actually more accurate from a user-experience
perspective since this directly determines whether the video information in
received packets can actually be displayed to the user without degradation.
The bitrate to request () in TMMBR is then:
(C.2.5-4)
Before sending the TMMBR message with the requested rate, the receiver needs
to verify that the requested rate does not exceed the bitrate that was
negotiated in SDP offer/answer.
## C.2.6 Video encoder bitrate adaptation, recovery phase
The delay recovery rate () and delay recovery period () can be determined as
follows. Let
(C.2.6-1)
where: () is the rate undershoot factor and may depend on the magnitude of the
channel rate drop () is:
(C.2.6-2)
For example, if is large, then may be proportionally large or if is small,
then may be proportionally small, for example:
(C.2.6-3)
Assuming that the bits during time period are queued up and are contributing
to the delay, the delay recovery period can be computed as follows:
(C.2.6-4)
A minimum bit rate requirement for the encoder may exist that applies to and,
therefore, also to as follows:
(C.2.6-5)
and therefore:
(C.2.6-6)
with:
(C.2.6-7)
If during the delay recovery period a TMMBR message is received that carries a
new rate value (), and is significantly larger than , for example , then the
delay recovery period may be shortened. Conversely, if then an extended delay
recovery period can be computed.
###### ## Annex D (informative): Reference delay computation algorithm
In this annex, the reference jitter management algorithm is described. It is
written in pseudo code and is non-causal; hence non-implementable. The purpose
of this algorithm is to define an \"ideal\" behaviour which all jitter buffers
used in MTSI should strive to mimic. This buffer operates based on three input
parameters:
\- lookback factor to set the current target buffering depth;
\- target late loss rate;
\- maximum allowed time scaling percentage.
function ref_jb(channel,jb_adaptation_lookback,delay_delta_max,target_loss)
\% channel = file name of the channel
\% lookback = look back factor when estimating the max jitter
\% buffer level [number of frames]
\% delay_delta_max = max timescaling related modification (%) of the
\% delay
\% target_loss = target late loss (%)
\% example syntax:
\% ref_jb(\'channel_1.dat\',200,15,0.5);
framelength = 20;
\% this value sets the speech data in each RTP packet to 20 ms. For 2 speech
\% frames/RTP packet the value would be 40 ms.
jitter_est_window=50;
\% Sets the jitter estimation window in number of frames
delay_delta_max_ms = framelength*delay_delta_max*0.01;
\% Sets the maximum allowed time scaling
tscale = 1;
\% Scale factor of delay data
\% In this case the files are assumend to be ascii files with one delay
\% entry per line, the entries are in ms, a negative value denotes
\% a packet loss.
x = load(channel);
x =x\';
\% remove packet losses
\% remove inital startup empty frames
ix = find(x > 0);
x(1:ix(1)-1) = x(ix(1));
\% remove packet losses (replace with nearby delay values)
ix = find(x \ 1)
x(ix(n)) = x(ix(n)-1);
end;
end;
\% convert timescale to ms
x = x*tscale;
L = length(x);
T = 1:L;
\% estimate min and max TX delay, estimate a delta_delay
for n=1:L
ix = [max(1,n-jitter_est_window):n];
max_delay(n) = max(x(ix));
min_delay(n) = min(x(ix));
delta_delay(n) = max_delay(n)-min_delay(n);
end
\% compute the target max jitter buffer level with some slow adaptation
\% downwards, just to mimick how a jitter buffer might behave
for n=1:L
ix = [max(1,n-jb_adaptation_lookback):n];
jb(n) = max(delta_delay(ix));
\% The timescaling is not allowed to adjust the jitterbuffer target max level
\% too fast.
if n == 1
jb_ = jb(n);
end
delta = abs(jb_-jb(n));

\% must be able to revert back to the previous data
while late_loss \GBR bearers are based on the highest bitrates possible
with the codecs, profiles and levels defined in Clause 5.2. The bitrates used
for GBR for MBR>GBR bearers are chosen to still give usable quality levels.
The 'a=bw-info' attributed defined in Clause 19 can be used to provide
additional bandwidth information for the setting of MBR and GBR and also to
align the resource allocation end-to-end, see also Clauses 6.2.5 and 6.2.7.
The bearer setup also depends on the outcome of the SDP offer-answer
negotiation. The QoS profiles shown below assume that both end-points agree on
using the codecs and bitrates as described in each respective example.
The QoS Class Identifier (QCI) [90] is used to describe the packet forwarding
treatment for different media types. The table below gives a few examples for
how the QCI can be set for different media types.

Using a conversational class bearer means that resources are reserved
throughout the session. Depending on the intended usage of real-time text, it
might not be the most resource efficient choice to use a conversational class
bearer, especially if it is foreseen that the sessions will be long-lived
while the actual text conversations will be rare and bursty. Table E.4
therefore shows an example with QoS mapping for using an interactive class
bearer. It is recommended to use QCI 6, 8, or 9 [90] for T.140 real-time text

# E.22 Bi-directional video (H.264 AVC level 1.2, IPv6, RTCP and MBR>GBR
bearer)
The video bandwidths used for defining MBR and GBR are assumed to be 384 kbps
and 192 kbps, respectively. The IPv6 overhead is 32 kbps (assuming 15fps and 4
IP packets per frame) for MBR and 16 kbps (assuming 15fps and 2 IP packets per
frame) for GBR, resulting in 416 kbps and 208 kbps, respectively. The transfer
delay for video is different from other media. The applicable H.264 profile
level can be derived from the \"profile-level-id\" MIME parameter signalled
within the SDP \"a=fmtp\" attribute. H.264 receivers can request to receive
only a lower bandwidth than depicted in this example via the SDP \"b:AS\"
parameter.

###### ## Annex F (Normative): Void
###### ## Annex G (Normative): DTMF events
# G.1 General
Typically, \"DTMF events\" are triggered by an end-user (on either side of the
speech call) by pressing some key of the user's terminal, with the goal to
control services in the network or in an application server. This may happen
throughout the duration of the speech call on both ends of the call.
It might happen that DTMF events are forwarded as telephone events to the
(remote) MTSI client in terminal. In such a case, the MTSI client in terminal
may convert the telephone events into audible DTMF tone-pairs. There is,
however, no requirement in 3GPP for handling downlink telephone events.
This annex describes a method for sending DTMF events as telephone events
within the same RTP media stream as the speech, i.e. \"inband\", using the
same IP address and UDP port as the RTP for speech, but using a different RTP
Payload Type number.
\- MTSI clients in terminal offering speech communication shall support the
below described method in the transmitting direction (uplink) and should
support it in the receiving direction (downlink).
\- MTSI media gateways offering speech communication shall support the below
described method in both directions with respect to the MTSI client in
terminal, the transmitting direction (downlink) and in the receiving direction
(uplink). For MTSI media gateways, the described method applies only to the PS
session between the MTSI gateway and the MTSI client in terminal.
\- The use of the telephone-event codec between MTSI media gateways is
recommended. Typically, DTMF events are also transported between MTSI media
gateways as telephone events in both directions.
# G.2 Encoding of DTMF events
DTMF events shall be encoded and transmitted in MTSI sessions as "telephone
events" in RTP packets, using the selected "telephone-event" codec. DTMF
events in this Annex refer to the DTMF Named Events described in Section 3.2,
Table 3 in IETF RFC 4733 [61], i.e. events (0-9, *, # and A-D) which are
encoded with event code values 0-9, 10, 11 and 12-15 respectively.
DTMF events are carried as part of the audio stream which can either be
narrowband, wideband, super-wideband or fullband audio, i.e. use 8 kHz or 16
kHz RTP clock rate respectively. MTSI clients that in addition to narrowband
also support wideband, super-wideband or fullband speech shall support
telephone-event RTP clock rates matching all supported codecs. When switching
between speech and DTMF, telephone events shall use the same RTP clock rate as
the currently used codec for the speech signal in the same RTP stream.
The encoding of DTMF events includes specifying the duration time for the
events, see IETF RFC 4733 [61]. Supporting long-lasting DTMF events, where the
duration time exceeds the maximum duration time expressible by the duration
field, is optional. If supported, long-lasting DTMF events shall be divided
into segments, see IETF RFC 4733 [61]. To harmonize with legacy DTMF
signalling, [62], [63], the tone duration of a DTMF event shall be at least 65
ms and the pause duration in-between two DTMF events shall be at least 65 ms.
The duration of the DTMF event and the pause time to the next DTMF event,
where applicable, should be selected such that it enables incrementing the RTP
Time Stamp with an integer multiple of the number of timestamp units
corresponding to the frame length of the speech codec used for the speech
media before the DTMF event.
# G.3 Session setup
The MTSI client(s) in terminal and the IMS network(s) shall support the
telephone-event codec(s) for the transport of DTMF events during the whole
MTSI session.
NOTE: They may in addition support the SIP INFO method (TS 24.229 [7]) for
setup and modification of supplementary services, when no user plane is
necessary. The SIP INFO method is, however, not to be used during MTSI
sessions.
When sending an SDP offer, an MTSI client should indicate support of all DTMF
Named Events 0 to15 in the fmtp attribute. As defined by IETF RFC 4733 [61]
section 7.1.1, if this fmtp parameter is not included, then the default
applies: 0-15.
If the SDP offer includes a single audio codec then, this SDP offer shall also
include the telephone-event codec with the same RTP clock rate as used for the
offered audio codec, as described by Errata 3489 to IETF RFC 4733 [61].If the
SDP offer includes multiple audio codecs with different RTP clock rates, then
this SDP offer shall also include the telephone-event codecs with different
payload type numbers for these different RTP clock rates.
The answerer, which determines the Selected (audio) Codec(s), shall, if
telephone-event was included in the SDP offer, include in the SDP answer the
corresponding telephone-event codec that matches the highest RTP clock rate
from the Selected (audio) Codec(s).
If the SDP offer or answer contains multiple m=audio lines, then the
telephone-event shall only be included for the first m=audio line.
An example of SDP offer and answer from MTSI clients in terminals using 3GPP
access is provided in Table G.3.1 when narrowband speech codec with RTP clock
rate 8000 is offered.

NOTE 1: Wideband codec ITU-T G.722 uses an RTP clock rate of 8000, although
its sampling frequency is 16000 Hz. An SDP offer or answer with G.722/8000
therefore must be combined with telephone-event/8000. The 3GPP EVS codec
supports various sampling frequencies, up to 48000 Hz, but only one RTP clock
rate of 16000 and the corresponding telephone-event/16000 is used.
NOTE 2: The a=sendrecv attribute applies to all RTP payload types within the
same media stream. To comply with the transmission rules defined in clause
G.4, SDP offers and SDP answers include audio codecs and telephone-event
codec(s) for the same media stream in both directions. The consequence of this
is that MTSI clients that want to send DTMF events in local uplink, also allow
the remote MTSI client to send DTMF events in the reverse direction.
For MTSI clients in terminals, since support of DTMF events in the receiving
direction is not mandatory, it is an implementation consideration to decide
how to handle any received RTP packets containing telephone-event codec
payload.
# G.4 Data transport for DTMF events
For sending and receiving DTMF events via telephone events with RTP, the RTP
payload format for "DTMF Named Events" of the telephone-event codec(s), IETF
RFC 4733 [61], shall be supported by MTSI clients in terminal and MTSI media
gateways.
Telephone events shall use the same RTP media stream as for speech, i.e. the
same IP address, UDP port, RTP SSRC and RTP clock rate as the Selected
(Speech) Codec. Thereby, RTP Sequence Number and RTP Time Stamp shall be
synchronized between RTP packets for speech and RTP packets for DTMF events.
For example, by setting the initial random values the same and when switching
from speech to DTMF, or vice versa, the RTP Sequence Number and RTP Time Stamp
shall continue from the value that was used for the other audio media (speech
or DTMF event).
The RTP Sequence Number for telephone events shall increment in the same way
as for speech, i.e. by 1 for each transmitted RTP packet.
The RTP Time Stamp for telephone events should increment in the same way as
for RTP speech packets or with an integer multiple. Example: if the RTP Time
Stamp increments with 160 between RTP speech packets (Codec with RTP clock
rate 8000 and 20 ms frame duration) then the RTP Time Stamp increment during
DTMF events and when switching between speech and DTMF events should be 160 or
an integer multiple of 160. The RTP Time Stamp should not increment with a
smaller interval for DTMF events than for speech frames. The RTP Time Stamp
shall use the same RTP clock rate as for the speech codec that is transmitted
in the same RTP stream immediately before the start of the DTMF event(s).
NOTE 1: A DTMF event may be transmitted in several RTP packets even if the
DTMF event has a shorter duration time than what is expressible by the
duration field. In this case all RTP packets containing the same DTMF event
within the same segment shall have the same RTP Time Stamp value according to
IETF RFC 4733 [61].
Speech packets shall not be transmitted such that the resulting decoded speech
would overlap in time with the audible representation of DTMF events, when
DTMF events are transmitted in the same RTP media stream.
NOTE 2**:** Most DTMF events are not translated into DTMF tone-pairs, because
they are used by the network or an application server (e.g. a voice mail box).
For such cases, it would not matter, if DTMF events are overlapping with
speech packets, but the non-overlap restriction is kept here for backward
compatibility reasons. If an MTSI client receives speech and DTMF event
packets, overlapping during a possible playout time, then the MTSI client
optimally ignores the overlapping speech packets and plays out only the DTMF
events correctly as DTMF tone-pairs, embedded into sufficient silence.
NOTE 3: If the RTP stream carrying the telephone events is paused on RTP level
[156], the need to send telephone events may cause the MTSI client in terminal
to leave the paused state.

###### ## Annex K (informative): Computation of b=AS for AMR and AMR-WB
# K.1 General
This annex contains examples of computing b=AS for AMR and AMR-WB when
ptime=20 and when ptime=40. In these examples, it is assumed that no extra
bandwidth is allocated for redundancy.
# K.2 Procedure for computing the bandwidth
The bandwidth is calculated using the following procedure when no extra
bandwidth is allocated for redundancy:
1) Calculate the size of the RTP payload, see below.
2) Calculate the size of the IP packets by taking the RTP payload size (in
bytes) and adding the IP/UDP/RTP overhead: 20 bytes for IPv4; 40 bytes for
IPv6; 8 bytes for UDP; 12 bytes for RTP.
3) Convert the IP packet size to bits.
4) Calculate the required bit rate (bps) given the packet size and the packet
rate: 50 packets per second for 1 frame per packet; 25 packets per second for
2 frames per packet.
5) The b=AS bandwidth is then calculated by converting the required bit rate
to kbps and rounding to the nearest higher integer value.
When redundancy is used then the RTP payload contains several frames, both
non-redundant and redundant. For example, for 100% redundancy each RTP payload
contains one non-redundant frame and one redundant frame, giving 2 frames per
packet. The packet rate is however still 50 frames per packet.
If the SDP includes multiple codecs and/or configurations then the bandwidth
is calculated for each configuration and the b=AS bandwidth is set to the
highest of the bandwidths.
# K.3 Computation of RTP payload size
When the b=AS bandwidth is computed it is assumed that the codec is using the
highest allowed coded mode for each frame.
The RTP payload size for the bandwidth-efficient payload format mode and 1
frame/packet is calculated from the following components:
\- 4 bits for the payload header (=CMR)
\- 6 bits for the Table of Contents (ToC)
\- N bits for the speech frame (size depends on codec mode)
\- Padding bits at the end of the RTP payload to give an integer number of
octets
The RTP payload size for the octet-aligned payload format mode and 1
frame/packet is calculated from the following components:
\- 4 bits for the payload header (=CMR) + 4 bits padding
\- 6 bits for the Table of Contents (ToC) + 2 bits padding
\- N bits for the speech frame (size depends on codec mode) + padding bits to
give an integer number of octets
\- No padding in the end of the RTP payload is needed since each item is
already an integer number of octets
The RTP payload size for the bandwidth-efficient payload format mode and 2
frames per packet is calculated from the following components:
\- 4 bits for the payload header (=CMR)
\- 6 bits for the Table of Contents (ToC) for speech frame 1
\- 6 bits for the Table of Contents (ToC) for speech frame 2
\- N1 bits for the speech frame 1 (size depends on codec mode)
\- N2 bits for the speech frame 2 (size depends on codec mode)
\- Padding bits at the end of the RTP payload to give an integer number of
octets
The RTP payload size for the octet-aligned payload format mode and 2 frames
per packet is calculated from the following components:
\- 4 bits for the payload header (=CMR) + 4 bits padding
\- 6 bits for the Table of Contents (ToC) for speech frame 1 + 2 bits padding
\- 6 bits for the Table of Contents (ToC) for speech frame 2 + 2 bits padding
\- N1 bits for the speech frame 1 (size depends on codec mode) + padding bits
to give an integer number of octets
\- N2 bits for the speech frame 2 (size depends on codec mode) + padding bits
to give an integer number of octets
\- No padding in the end of the RTP payload is needed since each item is
already an integer number of octets
# K.4 Detailed computation
The tables below give a detailed description of the bandwidth computation. The
b=AS bandwidth is not defined for SID. Since a SID is rarely encapsulated with
a speech frame or another SID, Tables K.9-16 do not include the computation
procedure for the comfort noise frame.

###### ## Annex L (Normative): Facsimile transmission
# L.1 General
This Annex describes Facsimile over IP (FoIP) transmission in MTSI using
UDPTL-based transmission, see ITU-T Recommendation T.38, [93].
FoIP is an optional capability for both MTSI client in terminals and MTSI
MGWs. This Annex defines the minimum capabilities that need to be supported
when FoIP is supported.
# L.2 FoIP support in MTSI clients
## L.2.1 FoIP support in MTSI client in terminal
An MTSI client in terminal supporting FoIP is typically either a facsimile
gateway or a facsimile end-point and does not need to support both cases.
An MTSI client in terminal may support FoIP where the MTSI client in terminal
is used as a facsimile gateway between an external Group 3 facsimile equipment
and the IMS network. In this case, the MTSI client in terminal acts as an
Internet Facsimile Protocol (IFP) peer, either as an emitting gateway or as a
receiving gateway depending on whether the MTSI client in terminal initiates
the Internet Facsimile Transfer (IFT) or whether it accepts the IFT, [93].
An MTSI client in terminal may support FoIP where the MTSI client in terminal
is the end-point for the facsimile transmission. In this case, the facsimile
transmission originates or terminates in the MTSI client in terminal.
An MTSI client in terminal supporting FoIP and used as a facsimile gateway
shall support:
\- input/output to Group 3 facsimile devices, [91]
NOTE: The interface used to connect the external facsimile device to the MTSI
client in terminal is outside the scope of this specification.
An MTSI client in terminal supporting FoIP and used either as a facsimile
gateway or as a facsimile end-point should support the recommended
configuration defined in Clause L2.3, Table L.1.
\- encapsulating and decapsulating T.30 to/from Internet Facsimile Protocol
(IFP) packets, [93];
## L.2.2 FoIP support in MTSI MGW
An MTSI MGW may support FoIP where the MGW is used as a facsimile gateway
between the IMS network and a Circuit Switched (CS) network, e.g. PSTN or CS
GERAN, in order to connect to another Group 3 facsimile device.
An MTSI MGW supporting FoIP should support the recommended configuration
defined in Clause L2.3, Table L.1.
## L.2.3 Recommended configuration
The recommended configuration for T.38 UDPTL-based FoIP is defined in Table

It is recommended that the MTSI client supports sending and receiving
facsimile with 200% redundancy when UDP redundancy is used, even if the SDP
attributes and parameters ('T38FaxUdpECDepth' with 'minred' and '\'maxred')
are not supported. This allows for transmitting each IFP message three times,
once as a primary message and twice as redundancy messages.
# L.3 Session setup
## L.3.1 Session setup for any MTSI client supporting facsimile transmission
An MTSI client supporting facsimile transmission shall support facsimile
transmission in stand-alone sessions without any other media types.
NOTE: This does not prevent supporting facsimile transmission also in other
session types, for example in speech+facsimile sessions, but this is not
described here.
An MTSI client supportings facsimile versions (T38FaxVersion) higher than 0
shall be capable of downgrading the session to any lower facsimile version, if
indicated by a received SDP message.
An MTSI client sending an SDP for a facsimile session shall include the
following in the SDP (offer or answer):
\- MIME media type and subtype names as defined in [94];
\- bandwidth information, both on media level and session level;
\- T38FaxVersion attribute, if the offered version is higher than 0;
\- T38FaxRateManagement attribute, with the value according to the offered
method.
Absence of the T38FaxVersion attribute indicates that only version 0 is
supported.
SDP examples for facsimile calls can be found in clause L.7.
## L.3.2 Session setup when the recommended profile is supported
When the MTSI client supports facsimile transmission according to the
recommended profile in Annex L.2.3 and initiates a session for UDPTL-based
facsimile transmission then:
\- the following SDP lines shall be used in the SDP offer:
\- b=AS with the bandwidth set to at least 46 kbps for IPv4 or 48 kbps for
IPv6;
\- T38FaxVersion attribute indicating at least version 2;
\- T38FaxRateManagement attribute with value 'transferredTCF';
\- the following SDP attributes should be included in the SDP offer:
\- T38MaxBitRate, the value should be set to 14400;
\- T38FaxMaxBuffer with value 1800;
\- T38FaxMaxDatagram with value 150;
\- T38FaxUdpEC with value 't38UDPRedundancy'.
Other SDP attributes defined in ITU-T T.38 Annex D may be included, if
supported.
When the MTSI client supports facsimile transmission according to the
recommended profile in Annex L.2.3 and accepts an offer for a session
initiation for facsimile transmission then:
\- the following SDP lines shall be included in the SDP answer:
\- T38FaxVersion attribute indicating at least version 2;
\- T38FaxRateManagement, the value shall be the same as in the SDP offer;
\- T38FaxUdpEC, the value to include depends both on what error correction
schemes the MTSI client supports and what error correction schemes that are
declared in the SDP offer;
\- b=AS, the value indicates the bandwidth needed for facsimile transmission
and should be aligned with T38MaxBitRate (if included);
\- and the following SDP attributes should be included:
\- T38MaxBitRate, the value should be set to 14400;
\- T38FaxMaxBuffer, the value indicates the receiver buffer size.
# L.4 Data transport using UDP/IP
An MTSI client in terminal supporting facsimile transmission using UDP/IP
shall support:
\- encapsulating and decapsulating T.30 [92] into/from Internet Facsimile
Protocol (IFP) packets [93];
\- UDPTL-based transport format in ITU-T Recommendation T.38 [93], and:
\- redundancy transmission of primary IFP packets, see ITU-T Recommendation
T.38 Clause 9.1.4.1 [93].
An MTSI client in terminal supporting facsimile transmission using UDP/IP may
support:
\- the parity FEC scheme specified in ITU-T Recommendation T.38 Annex C [93].
An IFP packet may include either partial, single or multiple HDLC frames.
A T.38 packet may include both one IFP packet and one or more redundancy/FEC
information packets.
# L.5 CS GERAN inter-working
An MTSI MGW for CS GERAN inter-working and supporting facsimile transmission
should support the recommended profile in Annex L.2.3.
# L.6 PSTN inter-working
An MTSI MGW for PSTN inter-working and supporting facsimile transmission
should support the recommended profile in Annex L.2.3.
# L.7 SDP examples
## L.7.1 Facsimile-only session
This example shows the media scope of the SDP offer and SDP answer for a
facsimile-only session when the recommended configuration in Annex L.2.3 is
offered by both end-points.
Table L.2: Example SDP offer for facsimile-only session
+---------------------------------------+ | SDP offer | +=======================================+ | m=image 49150 udptl t38 | | | | b=AS:46 | | | | a=T38FaxVersion:2 | | | | a=T38FaxRateManagement:transferredTCF | | | | a=T38MaxBitRate:14400 | | | | a=T38FaxUdpEC:t38UDPRedundancy | | | | a=T38FaxMaxBuffer:1800 | | | | a=T38FaxMaxDatagram:150 | +---------------------------------------+ | SDP answer | +---------------------------------------+ | m=image 49154 udptl t38 | | | | b=AS:46 | | | | a=T38FaxVersion:2 | | | | a=T38FaxRateManagement:transferredTCF | | | | a=T38MaxBitRate:14400 | | | | a=T38FaxUdpEC:t38UDPRedundancy | | | | a=T38FaxMaxBuffer:1800 | | | | a=T38FaxMaxDatagram:150 | +---------------------------------------+
**Comments:**
The session bandwidth is set to 46 kbps based on the following calculation:
\- the maximum fax bitrate is 14.4 kbps;
\- it is recommended that the MTSI client supports 200% redundancy;
\- 14.4 kbps and 150 bytes in each IP/UDP packet gives 12 packets per second;
\- IPv4 and UDP gives 28 bytes overhead for each IP/UDP packet (IPv6 and UDP
gives 48 bytes overhead).
This gives 3*14400 +12*28*8 = 45888 bps, which is rounded up to 46 kbps for
IPv4 (48 kbps for IPv6).
ITU-T Recommendation T.38 states that only 'T38FaxRateManagement' is mandatory
to include in the SDP. There are however other reasons to include the other
SDP lines:
\- b=AS is included both because this is useful information both for resource
allocation in network nodes and the remote end-point, and because it is
required by the current specification, see Clause 6.2.5.1;
\- the 'T38FaxVersion' attribute needs to be included to declare that version
2 is supported, since the other end-point would otherwise assume that only
version 0 is supported;
\- the 'T38MaxBitRate', 'T38FaxMaxBuffer' and 'T38FaxMaxDatagram' attributes
are very useful to ensure that the remote end-point sends fax media within the
limitations of the local end-point;
\- The 'T38FaxUdpEc' attribute is very useful information for the remote end-
point in case of bad channel conditions.
The SDP attributes 'T38FaxFillBitRemoval', 'T38FaxTranscodingMMR' and
'T38FaxTranscodingJBIG' are not included since the MTSI client is not required
to support these options.
The SDP attributes 'T38FaxMaxIFP', 'T38FaxUdpECDepth' and
'T38FaxUdpFECMaxSpan' are not included since these attributes are not defined
for T.38 fax version 2.

###### ## Annex N (informative): Computation of b=AS for Video Codec
# N.1 General
If an MTSI client includes any video codecs in the SDP offer or answer,
procedures to compute b=AS are left to the discretion of the implementation.
# N.2 Examples
Table N.x shows example values of b=AS in IPv4 and IPv6 for each source bit-
rate and image size pair of H.264/AVC. These values are determined from
encoding a variety of content with the codec targeting a particular source
bit-rate and then measuring the fluctuations of the encoded bit-rate in order
to determine the recommended b=AS values. As the source bit-rate increases,
the relative differences of b=AS values in IPv4 and IPv6 decrease as the
proportion of RTP/UDP/IP headers in the packet decreases, but the required
margin for the fluctuations increases. Different source bit-rates and b=AS
values can be used for the same image size depending on service policy,
alternative codec configurations, and the amount of bit-rate variation
introduced by the rate control algorithm implementation.

###### ## Annex P (informative): Video packet loss handling operation
principles and examples
# P.1 General
This annex describes operation principles and provides examples to video
packet loss handling scheme described in section 9.3. Several different video
packet loss handling behaviours are possible at both sender and receiver ends
for responding and reporting, respectively. Example criteria shown in this
section are not to be seen as a scheme that excludes other designs.
Implementers are free to use any packet loss algorithm as long as the
requirements and recommendations specified in clause 9.3 are fulfilled.
# P.2 Video error recovery
Efficient video error recovery requires error tracking capabilities at both
the sender and the receiver side. Error detection and tracking is necessary on
the receiver side for detecting the occurrence of the error as well as
detecting the recovery from the error. On the sender side it is necessary for
producing a recovery picture that would address the reported packet loss.
Basically a receiver should be able to detect errors and report them to the
sender in timely fashion. In return sender responds by sending recovery
pictures or performing gradual decoder refresh (GDR).
An example of video error recovery is illustrated in Figure P.1 below using a
NACK message.
Figure P.1 Video error recovery using NACK feedback message.
In this example, the error correction is performed in the following steps:
1\. Sender encodes a reference picture (blue) and transmits it. One or more of
the packets belonging to this picture are lost.
2\. Receiver detects lost packets belonging to the blue picture upon receiving
packets belonging to the picture following the blue picture or the last packet
(if received) of the blue picture, after de-jittering.
3\. When the decoder tries to decode the picture following the blue picture
and notices that a reference picture that it is referring to (i.e. the blue
picture) is missing or has been partially received, and in response flags an
error.
4\. Upon seeing the error report from the decoder, the receiver issues a NACK
message. The duration of time that elapses from the first detection of missing
packets to the issuance of the feedback message is denoted as the receiver
reaction time.
5\. Sender receives the NACK message, feeds this information to the encoder,
which responds by encoding the next picture either as an intra or inter
picture. Alternatively the encoder can generate GDR over next _N_ frames. In
the inter-picture case, the encoder refers to a reference picture (red) that
it assumes can be correctly decoded at the receiver side. The duration of time
that elapses from receipt of the feedback message and sending of the recovery
picture is denoted as the sender reaction time.
6\. Sender sends the recovery picture or the GDR to the receiver.
7\. Receiver's decoder continues to decode incoming pictures looking for the
arrival of the recovery picture or full refresh from GDR. The receiver may opt
not to render any incoming corrupted pictures while waiting for the arrival of
the recovery picture or full refresh.
If the recovery picture does not arrive in response wait time duration (RWT)
then the receiver should issue another NACK message to request error recovery
and wait for recovery. If the recovery still does not occur within another
RWT, then it starts issuing PLI messages to request IDR or GDR recovery. This
is illustrated in Figure P.2 below.
Figure P.2 Video error recovery using PLI feedback message.
PLI request becomes necessary when the likelihood of having a common reference
frame for inter error recovery is diminished. In this example, the error
correction is performed in the following steps:
1\. Receiver issues a PLI message after waiting for two RWT duration for a
recovery picture requested by NACK messages to arrive from the onset of the
error.
2\. Sender upon reception of the PLI message, encodes the next picture as IDR
picture or starts a GDR.
3\. Receiver receives the IDR picture or the GDR pictures resulting in full
refresh.
In the above example, a second PLI is received by the sender within RWT
interval. In this case, the sender ignores the second PLI since the receiver
cannot detect the arrival of the first sent IDR/GDR within this time frame.
The same principle applies to NACK messages as well. This would also apply to
cases where the sender has sent a picture that could serve as a recovery
picture (not triggered by a PLI/NACK message) prior to the reception of a
PLI/NACK message within RWT duration. In this case the sender does not have to
respond to the received PLI/NACK message as illustrated in Figure P.3 below.
Figure P.3 Example case where sender does not have to respond to incoming
NACK/PLI messages.
This case would apply to schemes where the sender periodically performs some
form of periodic intra refresh or inter recovery (periodically predict from
long term reference (LTR) pictures) as long as the period is conforms to the
timing restrictions defined in section 9.3.
# P.3 RTP Retransmission
RTP retransmission offers retransmission of lost packets reported by NACK
feedback. The receiver detects missing packets and requests retransmission of
missing packets. The sender upon receiving the NACK message decides to take
corrective action by retransmitting the reported missing packets to the
receiver. If retransmitted packets arrive in time for rendering, then timely
recovery is achieved.
An example of recovery from error is illustrated in Figure P.4 below using a
NACK message.
Figure P.4 Video error recovery using NACK feedback message and
retransmission.
In this example, the error correction is performed in the following steps:
> 1\. Sender encodes a reference picture (blue) and transmits it. Sender
> stores RTP packets corresponding to this frame in its buffers. One or more
> of the packets belonging to this picture are lost.
>
> 2\. Receiver detects lost packets belonging to the blue picture upon
> receiving packets belonging to the picture following the blue picture or the
> last packet (if received) of the blue picture, after de-jittering.
>
> 3\. The receiver issues a NACK message and pauses decoding while caching
> incoming packets.
>
> 4\. Sender receives the NACK message, checks whether the requested packets
> are available in its cache. If they are, it retransmits the requested
> packets.
>
> 5\. Receiver monitors the incoming packets to determine the arrival of the
> requested packets to resume decoding.
>
> 6\. If packets arrive in time, rendering is not interrupted.
###### ## Annex Q (informative): Computation of b=AS for EVS
# Q.1 General
This annex contains examples of computing b=AS for EVS Primary mode when
ptime=20, and ptime=40. In these examples, it is assumed that no extra
bandwidth is allocated for redundancy.
# Q.2 Procedure for computing the bandwidth
The bandwidth is calculated using the following procedure when no extra
bandwidth is allocated for redundancy:
1) Calculate the size of the RTP payload, see below.
2) Calculate the size of the IP packets by taking the RTP payload size (in
bytes) and adding the IP/UDP/RTP overhead: 20 bytes for IPv4; 40 bytes for
IPv6; 8 bytes for UDP; 12 bytes for RTP.
3) Convert the IP packet size to bits.
4) Calculate the required bit-rate (bps) given the packet size and the packet
rate: 50 packets per second for 1 frame per packet; 25 packets per second for
2 frames per packet.
5) The b=AS bandwidth is then calculated by converting the required bit-rate
to kbps and rounding to the nearest higher integer value.
If the SDP includes multiple codecs and/or configurations, the bandwidth is
calculated for each configuration and the b=AS bandwidth is set to the highest
of the bandwidths.
# Q.3 Computation of RTP payload size
When the b=AS bandwidth is computed, it is assumed that the codec is using the
highest allowed bit-rate for each frame.
The RTP payload size for the 2 bytes header-full payload format and 1
frame/packet is calculated from the following components:
\- 8 bits for the codec mode request (CMR)
\- 8 bits for the table of content (ToC)
\- N bits for the speech frame (size depends on bit-rate)
\- No padding in the end of the RTP payload is needed since each item is
already an integer number of octets
The RTP payload size for the 2 bytes header-full payload format and 2
frames/packet is calculated from the following components:
\- 8 bits for the codec mode request (CMR)
\- 16 bits for the table of content (ToC)
\- N bits for the speech frame (size depends on bit-rate)
\- No padding in the end of the RTP payload is needed since each item is
already an integer number of octets
# Q.4 Detailed computation
The tables below give a detailed description of the bandwidth computation. The
b=AS bandwidth is not defined for SID.
NOTE 1: The tables below apply for both the header-full format and the compact
format of EVS Primary mode, as switching between the modes can occur during
the session.
For each codec mode, b=AS value of EVS AMR-WB IO mode is the same as the b=AS
value of AMR-WB in octet-aligned mode. See clause K.4.
NOTE 2: The tables in clause K.4 also apply for the compact format of EVS AMR-
WB IO mode, as switching between the modes can occur during the session.
NOTE 3: In tables Q.1 and Q.2, the speech frame of 7.2 kbps in EVS Primary
mode at ptime=20 is zero-padded by one byte to avoid the protected payload
size of 8.0 kbps, but zero-padding by additional byte(s) is also allowed.

###### ## Annex S (normative): Multi-party Multimedia Conference Media
Handling
# S.1 General
This annex describes an extension to MTSI, which is optional to implement for
an MTSI client. It contains descriptions of both mandatory and optional
functionalities for the particular type of MTSI client that is called MSMTSI
client, which is better suited for group audio/video communication than a
regular MTSI client. The specifications in this Annex apply in addition to the
rest of this specification, except when it is explicitly stated that the text
here replaces other parts of this specification.
The intention with this extension is to avoid transcoding as far as possible
in multiparty calls. For example, without this extension, video conferencing
would need transcoding in the MRF to compose the different videos received
from different senders into a single video, containing a main video and a
number of thumbnails, which is then sent to each receiver. It may happen that
the MRF needs to compose different video compositions to different receivers,
which multiplies the need for transcoding and thus scales poorly with the size
of the group. With this extension, the MRF can forward the necessary streams,
without transcoding, to each MSMTSI client in terminal, which then composes
the final image that is presented to the user.
Avoiding transcoding reduces the complexity in the MRF and reduces the end-to-
end delay. Quality degradations caused by the transcoding can often also be
avoided. The benefits with this extension are further described in 3GPP TR
26.980 [152].
# S.2 Video
## S.2.1 Conversational video
An MSMTSI client in the terminal shall be capable of receiving and locally
composing at least one main video and one or more video thumbnails. A
\"thumbnail\" video is in this context defined as a receive-only video
\"m=\"-line that is not the first video \"m=\"-line in the SDP, and that is
also not identified with any \"a=content:main\" or \"a=content:slides\".
An MSMTSI client in terminal shall support receiving at least one thumbnail
and may also support receiving any number of additional thumbnails, subject to
MSMTSI client capability. An MSMTSI MRF shall support sending at least two
thumbnails and may support sending any number of additional thumbnails,
subject to MSMTSI MRF capability.
An MSMTSI client in terminal shall support sending at least one thumbnail-
sized simulcast format of the main video, and may support sending also other
simulcast formats. An MSMTSI MRF shall support receiving at least one
thumbnail-sized simulcast format of the main video, and may support receiving
also other simulcast formats.
## S.2.2 Non-conversational (screenshare) video
An MSMTSI client may support sending and receiving screenshare video. The
first picture of the screen sharing video an MSMTSI client sends after being
granted the screenshare BFCP floor (see clause S.5.6) shall be random
accessible, i.e., as if a FIR would have been received.
# S.3 Audio
## S.3.1 General
An MSMTSI client in terminal shall be capable of receiving and may be capable
of sending multiple simultaneous audio RTP streams. The number of multiple
audio streams received at the MSMTSI client may be different than the number
of multiple audio streams sent from the same MSMTSI client.
Support for multiple audio streams in the direction from an MSMTSI MRF to an
MSMTSI client in the terminal shall be interpreted as originating from
different group call participants.
An MSMTSI client in terminal shall support local mixing of received audio
streams, and may support use of spatial rendering tools, such as local Head-
Related Transfer Function (HRTF), to perform audio panning and mixing of the
multiple audio streams. Audio panning may enable the rendering device to
choose to vary the audio levels of participants by adjusting the mixing gains.
Multi-stream audio is not to be confused with multichannel audio where multi-
stream audio may include one or more of mono, stereo, or multichannel audio
RTP streams originating from different group call participants.
## S.3.2 De-jitter buffer
The functional requirements for jitter-buffer management of MSMTSI client in
terminal shall meet the same minimum performance requirements per audio stream
that are set for MTSI clients (Clause 8).
# S.4 SIP
## S.4.1 MSMTSI client in terminal
An MSMTSI client in terminal shall, when connecting to a remote party that
included the \"isFocus\" tag in any of its SIP headers, subscribe to SIP
conference events, as described in [147]. The MSMTSI client in terminal shall
be able to receive and handle conference event notifications, resulting from
the subscription. The MSMTSI client in terminal shall be capable of parsing
all conference event information elements, shall be capable of receiving
partial conference event information, and shall be capable of presenting
conference event information to the user of the MSMTSI client in terminal,
either automatically or on explicit user request. The MSMTSI client in
terminal shall be capable of presenting at least the values of the conference
event information elements indicated in **bold** below to the user of the
MSMTSI client in the terminal, and shall be capable to use the conference
event information elements indicated in _italics_ below for endpoint and media
identification, as defined by [147] and [148] (here also indicating relevant
parts of the XML document hierarchy, for information):
> • \
>
> o \
>
>  **\ **

>  _\ _
>
> • \
>
> o \
>
>  _\ _
Values for other conference event information elements may optionally be made
available to the user of the MSMTSI client in the terminal.
## S.4.2 MSMTSI MRF
An MSMTSI MRF shall include the \"isFocus\" tag in all of its outgoing SIP
headers that support inserting that tag. It shall be capable of handling
subscriptions and unsubscriptions for conference event information, as
specified in [147].
# S.5 Media configuration
## S.5.1 General
An MSMTSI client that receives an SDP offer with \"m=\"-lines that it cannot
handle or does not understand shall use regular SDP offer/answer procedures
[8] to individually reject those unsupported \"m=\"-lines. An MSMTSI client
shall not send RTP or RTCP for rejected \"m=\"-lines.
An MSMTSI client shall support controlling its maximum sending rate per
\"m=\"-line for media related to that \"m=\"-line, as described by clause
6.2.5.
A \"common codec\" is a codec (typically a legacy/older generation codec) that
is supported by all the participants in the conference and enables transcoder-
free MSMTSI conferencing. If all participants share support for more than a
single codec for a certain media type, the codec providing the best media
quality for a given bitrate should be chosen by the MSMTSI MRF as the \"common
codec\".
A \"preferred codec\" is a codec (typically a better compression performance,
newer generation codec) that is supported by some but not all participants in
the conference and enables better media quality.
The common codec and preferred codec(s) may be determined by:
> 1) the codecs that were offered or pre-selected by the conference
> participant that initiated the conference (ad hoc or pre-scheduled)
>
> 2) the codecs supported by other conference participants, e.g., by use of
> SIP OPTIONS (see clause S.5.7.3)
When setting up individual sessions with the conference participants, the
MSMTSI MRF:
> 1) shall include the common codec in the SDP offer/answer negotiation, and
>
> 2) may additionally include the preferred codecs in the SDP offer/answer
> negotiation to improve conference quality or performance.
To avoid transcoding when multiple codecs of a media type are used in an
MSMTSI session,
> 1) simulcast [154] shall be negotiated;
>
> 2) usage of both preferred and common codecs in the SDP shall be supported;
>
> 3) the MSMTSI MRF shall include the preferred codecs in the SDP as being
> simulcast with a corresponding common codec stream for the same media type;
> and
>
> 4) a participant sending media using a preferred codec shall also simulcast
> a representation of the same media using the common codec for that media
> type.
When constructing \"a=rid\" [155] line identification of simulcast formats,
MSMTSI clients in terminal and MSMTSI MRF shall use a 1:1 mapping per
direction between each rid-id and the corresponding RTP payload type number in
the \"pt=\" parameter on the \"a=rid\" line. It is optional for MSMTSI clients
in terminal and MSMTSI MRF to support constraints parameters for the \"a=rid\"
lines. An MSMTSI client in terminal and MSMTSI MRF shall be capable to ignore
any \"a=rid\" constraints parameters it does not understand and shall
correctly negotiate them away in the SDP answer, as specified in [155].
NOTE 1: The only, currently defined \"a=rid\" constraint applicable to 3GPP
audio codecs is bitrate (\"max-br\").
The recommended approach by which the common and preferred codec information
is exchanged between the MSMTSI MRF and the MSMTSI terminals is to use the
order in which the codecs are listed in the SDP a=simulcast line, which lists
simulcast streams in order of decreasing priority. The common codec should be
listed first, assuming that the common codec simulcast stream is to be used as
far as possible, to avoid transcoding. The preferred codec may instead be
listed first if a limited amount of transcoding is considered an acceptable
cost for keeping good media quality.
NOTE 2: An MSMTSI MRF needs to make a trade-off between minimizing transcoding
by use of a common codec and maximizing media quality by use of a preferred
codec in the conference, which is described in more detail in clauses 6.17 and
6.13.4 in [152]. The common codec being listed with highest priority means
that it will be kept, even if some other simulcast streams need to be rejected
or dropped (e.g. due to network resource limitations, see clause S.8). The
preferred codec being listed with highest priority similarly means that it
will be kept, even if common codec simulcast streams need to be rejected or
dropped, which can in turn require transcoding to some conference
participants. This applies both across different simulcast streams (\";\"
separator) and for alternatives (\",\" separator) within a single simulcast
stream in the \"a=simulcast\" line. This choice between prioritizing common or
preferred codecs does not impact interoperability and is therefore left for
individual MSMTSI MRF implementation.
## S.5.2 Main video
The main video SDP \"m=\"-line shall be the first video \"m=\"-line in an SDP
offer from an MSMTSI client, to increase the probability that it is accepted
by a non-MSMTSI client. The main video SDP \"m=\"-line shall be identified by
an \"a=content:main\" SDP attribute [145] under that \"m=\"-line. The MSMTSI
client shall be capable of identifying the main video when the video
\"m=\"-line contains \"a=content:main\", even if this is not the first video
\"m=\"-line in the SDP. An MSMTSI client shall be capable of receiving an SDP
without any \"a=content:main\" SDP video attribute, and should then choose
main video to be the first suitable video \"m=\"-line that cannot be clearly
identified for another purpose (such as for example \"a=content:slides\", see
below).
In case of video, where the main video and thumbnail video are being sent from
the MSMTSI client to the MSMTSI MRF, use of simulcast shall be indicated in
SDP according to [154] and [155] in an SDP offer. SDP simulcast negotiation
decides which simulcast formats, if any, that are sent between the MSMTSI
clients in terminal and the MSMTSI MRF. An MSMTSI client in terminal shall use
send direction simulcast in the SDP when negotiating use of simulcast to send
main video thumbnail. An MSMTSI MRF shall use receive direction simulcast in
the SDP when negotiating use of simulcast towards an MSMTSI client in terminal
to receive main video thumbnail.
An MSMTSI client in terminal that receives an SDP offer using simulcast from a
remote party that is not a conference focus (indicated by the SIP isFocus tag
not being present in SIP headers), should disable use of simulcast in the
corresponding SDP answer.
## S.5.3 Thumbnail video
Each thumbnail video that the MSMTSI client supports shall be negotiated as a
separate SDP video \"m=\"-line, different from the main video \"m=\"-line
(\"a=content:main\") and any screenshare video \"m=\"-line
(\"a=content:slides\").
An MSMTSI client in the terminal shall use receive-only direction for all
thumbnail videos in the SDP. An MSMTSI MRF shall use send-only direction for
all thumbnail videos in the SDP that are sent towards an MSMTSI client in the
terminal. As a specific case of the general SDP \"m=\"-line handling specified
by S.5, an MSMTSI client that receives an SDP offer with more thumbnail video
\"m=\"-lines than it can support, shall disable the \"m=\"-lines it cannot
support (by setting port to 0) in the SDP answer. Which thumbnail \"m=\"-lines
to keep and which to reject, in case all cannot be supported, is left for
MSMTSI client implementation preference.
A thumbnail \"m=\"-line is generally not dedicated to a certain conference
participant and the number of \"m=\"-lines for thumbnails therefore need not
match the number of conference participants. If RTP stream selective
forwarding (see clause S.6) is used for thumbnails by the MSMTSI MRF, though
the forwarded participant may change at any point in time, a single thumbnail
\"m=\"-line can map to an RTP stream from any one of the participants. The
number of thumbnail \"m=\"-lines actually used between an individual MSMTSI
client in terminal and an MSMTSI MRF is thus decided by the minimum number of
thumbnail \"m=\"-lines in any of their SDPs, irrespective of the MSMTSI client
in terminal or the MSMTSI MRF being the entity supporting the fewest thumbnail
\"m=\"-lines. Therefore, the number of thumbnail \"m=\"-lines supported by an
individual MSMTSI client in terminal does not limit the number of thumbnail
\"m=\"-lines used between the MSMTSI MRF and other MSMTSI clients in terminals
participating in the same conference.
An MSMTSI client in terminal that receives an SDP offer using thumbnails from
a remote party that is not a conference focus (indicated by the SIP isFocus
tag not being present in SIP headers), should disable thumbnail \"m=\"-lines
in the corresponding SDP answer.
## S.5.4 Screenshare video
When screenshare video is supported, it shall be indicated as a separate SDP
video \"m=\"-line, identified by \"a=content:slides\" [145] under that
\"m=\"-line. There is no restriction in how the screenshare video \"m=\"-line
is ordered in relation to other \"m=\"-lines in the SDP, except that it shall
be listed after the main video \"m=\"-line.
## S.5.5 Audio
The main audio SDP \"m=\"-line shall be the first \"m=\"-line in an SDP offer
from an MSMTSI client, to increase the probability that it is accepted by a
non-MSMTSI client.
Support for multiple, simultaneous audio streams shall be indicated in SDP as
separate audio \"m=\"-lines. The number of supported channels in multi-channel
audio shall be indicated per audio stream through the SDP \"m=\"-line
\, with the default being a single channel when
\ is omitted. There is no restriction in how additional
audio \"m=\"-lines are ordered in relation to other \"m=\"-lines in the SDP,
except that they shall be listed after the main audio \"m=\"-line.
## S.5.6 BFCP
Use of BFCP (see also clause S.7) is defined in TS 24.147 [147]. BFCP is
negotiated with a single \"m=\"-line for BFCP in SDP as specified in [150]. If
both screenshare video and main video are negotiated, they shall be negotiated
to use separate BFCP floor identifications. An MSMTSI client shall be capable
of correctly associating SDP \"m=\"-lines with BFCP floors through the SDP
answer, as described in [150].
An MSMTSI MRF shall support at least the BFCP floor control server role in SDP
offer/answer.
An MSMTSI client in terminal shall support the BFCP floor control client role
in SDP offer/answer, but may in addition support also the BFCP floor control
server role. Which role is taken by which part is decided by BFCP SDP
offer/answer.
## S.5.7 Compact Concurrent Codec Negotiation and Capabilities
### S.5.7.1 General
To establish MMCMH sessions that make the most of all the participating
terminals' codec capabilities without exceeding the concurrent codec
capabilities of each participating terminal, the MMCMH session intiator needs
to know the concurrent codec capabilities of all the other terminals. MSMTSI
terminals can use the concurrent codec capabilities exchange procedures
specified in this clause to obtain this information in a compact format.
Furthermore, the specified procedures can be used to negotiate, in a compact
manner, which concurrent codecs to use for the MMCMH session.
### S.5.7.2 The Compact CCC SDP Attribute
The Compact CCC SDP attribute enables MSMTSI terminals to communicate the CCC
information in a more compact format. The ABNF definition is as follows:
> ccc-list = \"a=ccc_list:\" codeclist 1*63( \"\|\" ccc-prof )
>
> codeclist = codec [SP config] *63( \";\" codec [SP config] )
>
> ccc-prof = \"ENC:\" num *63( rule num ) \":DEC:\" num *63( rule num )
>
> codec = byte-string
>
> ; byte-string defined in RFC 4566
>
> level = 1*3DIGIT
>
> profile = 1*3DIGIT
>
> config = ( profile SP level ) / level
>
> rule = \";\" / \",\"
>
> num = 1*2DIGIT
codec is the media subtype name of a codec as defined in the RTP payload
format for that codec, e.g. \"H264\" for H.264 as defined in [25] and \"H265\"
for H.265 as defined in [120], respectively.
codeclist is an ordered list of the different codecs that are supported by the
terminal. The codecs should be listed in order of decreasing complexity from
left to right for the \",\" rule to indicate the ability to substitute an
instance of a more complex codec with a simpler one.
level, which is optional, specifies the level of the codec, converted and
expressed in hexadecimal format, i.e., for H.264 and H.265 the value is equal
to level_idc as defined in [25] and level-id as defined in [120],
respectively.
profile, which is optional, specifies the profile of the codec, e.g. for H.264
and H.265 the value is equal to profile_idc as defined in [25] and profile-id
as defined in [120], both expressed in hexadecimal fomat, respectively. If the
profile is included then the level is also included. However, it is allowed to
have the level to be present without the profile being present.
rule specifies in a particular CCC profile (ccc-prof) whether the resources
used for a concurrent instance of the codec may be used instead by a
concurrent instance of the codec listed afterwards, e.g., the next listed
codec is less computationally complex and runs on the same processor as the
previously listed codec. When the value is \",\" then an instance of the
subsequent codec can used in place of an instance of the previously listed
codec. When the value is \";\"\' an instance of the subsequent codec cannot be
used instead.
num specifies the maximum number of supported concurrent encoders (when the
combination follows \"ENC\") or decoders (when the combination follows
\"DEC\") of the specified codec at the specified level and profile (when
present). num specifies the maximum number of instances of the particular
codec that can operate concurrently when all the other codecs in the same ccc-
prof have their corresponding num of instances operating. The number of
instances of num that immediately follows \"ENC\" and the number of instances
of num that immediately follows \"DEC\" are both the same as the number of
instances of codec, and an instance of num is mapped to an instance of codec
with the same order in the ordered codeclist.
There can be multiple ccc-prof's to indicate support of different
configurations of concurrent encoders and decoders, e.g., to indicate that
supporting less concurrent encoders enables the terminal to support more
concurrent decoders. ccc-prof's should not be in conflict with each other,
i.e., indicate a different maximum number of instances (num) of a particular
codec when the maximum number of instances of all the other codecs in the ccc-
prof's are the same. If a conflict is detected between ccc-prof's, the
information from the first ccc-prof among the conflicting ccc-prof's is used
and all the other conflicting ccc-prof's are ignored.
If the terminal has the ability to trim the number of received media streams
it actually decodes, it can advertise a num value that is larger than it
actually has the concurrent decoding capabilities for.
As the \"a=ccc_list\" attribute is a compact representation of the media
capabilities that are expressed in SDP, using it is not expected to introduce
any additional security conditions beyond those identified for SDP. Therefore
the security considerations for the attribute are covered by the security
considerations for SDP as specified in RFC 4566 [8]. There are no identified
interoperability concerns for this atttibute as it is a new attribute and the
values used for the codec field are well defined to use values managed by
IANA.
### S.5.7.3 Using the Compact CCC SDP Attribute for CCC Exchange
The SIP OPTIONS method specified in RFC 3261 is used to query the capabilities
of another terminal by asking the conference participant to send a copy of the
SDP it would offer.
For example, the SIP OPTIONS request may be made in-advance of a conference
call and the SIP OPTIONS response be stored for the queried terminal.
Alternatively, immediately before setting up a conference, the conference
initiator may query the capabilities of all the terminals it plans to invite
for which it does not have the information pre-stored.
In single source multi-unicast (SSMU) topology [152], the MRF sends the SIP
OPTIONS request to each of the terminals before setting up the conference. The
terminals send the SIP OPTIONS response to the MRF. The MRF can then use this
response information to pre-configure and send the SDP Offers to the terminals
using simulcast and multiple m- lines for the MSMTSI session. Alternatively,
for the case where MSMTSI terminals call in and sends SDP Offers to MRF
(instead of MRF calling out), the MRF can still use knowledge from SIP OPTIONS
response to adjust its SDP Answer.
In multi-unicast topology, the conference initiator sends the SIP OPTIONS
request to each of the conference participants well in-advance of the
conference call. Upon receiving the SIP OPTIONS response from the
participants, the conference initiator may store the encoding/decoding
preferences of the conference participants for setting up the MSMTSI session.
A new content type cccex, is used to request the ccc_list attribute (see
S.5.7.4). The SIP OPTIONS response shall contain the text that follows
\"a=ccc_list:\" when using the ccc_list attribute.
SIP OPTIONS SDP examples are given in Clause T.3.4.
### S.5.7.4 Using the Compact CCC SDP Attribute for Session Initiation
#### S.5.7.4.1 General
MSMTSI terminals shall be able to interpret and respond to the ccc_list
attribute included in an SDP answer. MSMTSI terminals should include the
ccc_list attribute in an SDP offer to reduce the size of the offer when
multiple media configurations of concurrent codecs are being offered.
#### S.5.7.4.2 SDP Offer Rules
When an MSMTSI terminal generates an offer that includes the ccc_list
attribute, it shall include only a single instance of the ccc_list attribute,
and one or more media configurations which together cover all the possible
concurrent codec configurations that the offerer can support. If the included
media configuration(s) offer more concurrent codec configurations than the
offerer can support, the offering MSMTSI terminal shall use the ccc_list
attribute to indicate to the answerer additional restrictions to the media
configurations included in the offer. This allows the MSMTSI offerer to
include a single media configuration without using MediaCapNeg and requiring
much fewer lines of SDP.
When an MSMTSI terminal includes the ccc_list attribute in an SDP offer it
shall check whether the ccc_list attribute is included in the SDP answer it
receives. If the attribute is included, the offering MSMTSI terminal may store
this CCC information about the other terminal for use in future sessions. If
multiple instances of the attribute are included in the SDP answer, the
offering MSMTSI terminal shall ignore all but the first instance. If the
attribute is not included, the offering MSMTSI terminal shall check that it
can support the media configuration selected in the SDP answer in the MMCMH
session. If the offering MSMTSI can not support the selected media
configuration, it shall send a re-INVITE to the answering terminal without
including the ccc_list attribute in the new SDP offer.
#### S.5.7.4.3 SDP Answer Rules
When an answering MSMTSI terminal receives an offer that includes the ccc_list
attribute, it shall include exactly one instance of the ccc_list attribute in
the SDP answer. If multiple instances of the attribute are received in the
offer, the answering MSMTSI terminal shall ignore all but the first instance.
The answering MSMTSI terminal may store this CCC information about the
offering terminal for use in future sessions.
When an answering MSMTSI terminal includes the ccc_list attribute in an SDP
answer, it shall set the attribute to describe the complete concurrent codec
capabilities of the answering MSMTSI terminal, independent of what was
received in the SDP offer.
# S.6 Media transport
## S.6.1 RTP
An MSMTSI client shall be capable of receiving multiple, separate RTP streams
[9] related to a single SIP dialog and route them to the correct decoder based
on RTP SSRC, RTP Payload Type, and any \"a=content\" information in the SDP.
The number of RTP streams used in each direction and for each media type is
limited to what is negotiated by SDP offer/answer for that SIP dialog,
allowing the involved MSMTSI clients to express a limit to the number of
streams they can handle simultaneously.
An MSMTSI client in terminal shall be capable of relating received RTP SSRC
and CSRC with information from the conference event information (clause S.4),
to enable indicating the identity of the RTP stream source. If a received RTP
SSRC has no match in the conference event information, and if RTP CSRC is
present, CSRC shall also be matched against conference event information. It
is left up to MSMTSI client implementation what RTP stream source
identification to use if neither SSRC nor CSRC can be matched against
conference event information.
## S.6.2 RTCP
An MSMTSI client in the terminal shall, as an MTSI client in the terminal, be
capable to receive RTCP feedback (FIR, PLI, TMMBR, etc) [40][43] and respond
accordingly, but shall also be capable to identify which sent RTP stream
(SSRC) the RTCP feedback targets and direct it to the appropriate encoder.
An MSMTSI client shall support RTP-level pause and resume functionality
according to [156] for all of its RTP streams, with the exception of the main
audio stream from an MSMTSI client in terminal towards an MSMTSI MRF, which is
not required to (but may) support RTP-level pause and resume functionality. An
MSMTSI client shall be capable of restricting its use of RTP-level pause and
resume functionality according to received pause/resume config parameter
information in SDP, including not using it at all if that is the negotiation
outcome.
An MSMTSI client in terminal shall support RTP-level pause and resume
functionality at least corresponding to config=3, and should support full RTP-
level pause and resume functionality corresponding to config=1.
An MSMTSI MRF shall support RTP-level pause and resume functionality at least
corresponding to config=2, and should support full RTP-level pause and resume
functionality corresponding to config=1.
## S.6.3 RTP Stream Selective Forwarding
When a conference includes a large number of terminals or participants, the
size of the SDP Offer listing the concurrent codec capabilities (CCC) using
multiple m= lines can increase considerably. **To reduce the size of the SDP
offer when a conference includes a large number of participants, RTP-level
selective forwarding by the MSMTSI MRF shall support RTP pause/suspend, reuse,
replace, and resume actions. This RTP-level "suspend, resuse, replace, and
resume" action is described using an example in Clause 6.13.4.2, TR 26.980
[152].**
**In the SDP Offer the MSMTSI MRF may use fewer downlink m= lines,
corresponding to dynamically selected streams even though there are large
number of participants or terminals in the MSMTSI session.**
**To support RTP stream selective forwarding when some participants in a
conference supports both the \"common\" and one or more \"preferred\" codecs
while other participants support only the \"common\" codec, certain conditions
need to be fulfilled for MSMTSI clients both in the terminal and in MSMTSI
MRF. This is described below.**
**The MSMTSI MRF should construct the SDP Offer such that the downlink RTP
stream from one participant fits sufficiently well with the capabilities of
another participant such that the same downlink m= line can be used for RTP
stream selective forwarding. For this, the MSMTSI MRF should pre-anlayze the
CCCEx (e.g., based on SIP OPTIONS) and construct sub-groups of participants
that can share a given m= line with a given set of \"preferred\" and
\"common\" codecs in the simulcast.**
An MSMTSI client in terminal that supports both \"common\" and \"preferred\"
codecs for a media type shall support concurrent encoding, sending simulcast
[155], and concurrent decoding, with more than a single one codec for every
sending media source (\"m=\" line) of that media type. An MSMTSI MRF that
supports both \"common\" and \"preferred\" codecs for a media type shall
support receving simulcast with more than a single codec for every received
media source (\"m=\" line) of that media type.
An MSMTSI client in terminal that supports both \"common\" and \"preferred\"
codecs for a media type shall be capable to receive media using any one of
those codecs, even if the used codec (RTP payload type) is changing from one
RTP packet to the next, for all received media sources (\"m=\" lines) of that
media type. This capability to receive RTP payload type changing from one RTP
packet to the next is indicated by accepting payload types with both
\"common\" and \"preferred\" codecs from the SDP offer in the SDP answer. This
way, no SDP re-negotiation is needed to change codec between the ones included
in the answer. This ability to support RTP payload type changes every RTP
packet is an essential part of the receiving end of a codec simulcast
scenario, and shall be explicitly indicated in SDP by including
\"a=simulcast\" with the supported codecs as simulcast format alternatives,
even if it means that only a single simulcast stream with alternatives is
listed in simulcast receive direction.
An MSMTSI client in the terminal that negotiated receiving simulcast with
different codecs and that receives a set of such simulcast streams, can
dynamically choose which simulcast stream to decode and should use the best
quality simulcast stream that is available.
An MSMTSI MRF that negotiated sending simulcast with a set of different codecs
and that needs to forward streams using those codecs, may change RTP payload
type within that set in its sent stream at any point in time, as needed to
support the communication scenario and forwarding strategy used by the MSMTSI
MRF.
The MSMTSI MRF should take action to allow decoder memories to clear when
replacing one RTP stream with another RTP stream during switching, to avoid
media distortion in the receiving MSMTSI client in the terminal. To enable
this, it is currently necessary for the MSMTSI MRF to know the RTP payload
format of the used codecs, even if no transcoding is needed. The MSMTSI MRF
should therefore, before suspending forwarding of RTP stream A and replacing
it by instead forwarding RTP stream B:
> • For speech
>
> o Replace the content of a few RTP packet payloads from RTP stream A with a
> few silence indication (SID) or discontinuous transmission (DTX) frames for
> the used codec
>
> • For video
>
> o Take assistance from the sender of RTP stream B, asking for a decoder
> refresh point by sending RTCP FIR to that RTP stream B sender
>
> o Continue forwarding RTP stream A while monitoring RTP stream B for decoder
> refresh points
>
> o From the point where a decoder refresh point is received in RTP stream A,
> suspend forwarding of RTP stream A and replace it by forwarding RTP stream B
# S.7 BFCP
## S.7.1 General
BFCP with TCP transport according to [149][150] shall be supported. An MSMTSI
client in terminal shall be capable of indicating to the user when it is
granted a floor, when a floor request is rejected, and when a floor grant is
revoked. The details of such indication are left for MSMTSI client
implementation. If the MSMTSI client in terminal supports floor control of
more than a single video, it shall be able to make such indications separately
for each supported floor.
An MSMTSI client may support functionality for moderated BFCP floor handling,
involving a floor chair.
An MSMTSI MRF should silently ignore and discard any received video that is
currently under active floor control, but where another MSMTSI or MTSI client
than the one sending such received stream currently owns the floor.
## S.7.2 Floor controlled main video
An MSMTSI client shall support BFCP [147][149] to control the main video.
When BFCP is used to control the MSMTSI client main video, all MSMTSI clients
are allowed to send video as long as no one owns that BFCP floor. Whenever any
MSMTSI client owns the main video floor, only that MSMTSI client is allowed to
send main video in the group video call, and the MSMTSI MRF forwards that
video to all other participants. The MSMTSI MRF should continue to use any
previously used video forwarding strategy towards the MSMTSI client in the
terminal that owns the main video floor.
## S.7.3 Floor controlled screenshare video
If screeenshare video is supported by an MSMTSI client, BFCP [147][149] to
control the screenshare video shall also be supported.
If BFCP is not available to control the screenshare video, and considering
that the MSMTSI client supports screenshare video as a separate video
\"m=\"-line, implicit screenshare floor control of that \"m=\"-line shall be
assumed. Such implicit floor control shall here be taken to mean that the
MSMTSI client is allowed to start sending screenshare video at any point in
time, whenever initiated by the user of the MSMTSI client. No explicit
screenshare floor grant indication to the sending MSMTSI client is possible in
this case. An MSMTSI client in the terminal using implicitly floor controlled
screenshare video that begins receiving screenshare video after itself started
sending, shall immediately stop sending screenshare video, since this shall be
interpreted as the implicit screenshare floor grant being revoked.
## S.7.4 Implicit floor control for audio
An MSMTSI client in terminal is allowed to receive more audio streams than it
is capable of decoding concurrently at a given time. In such case, the MSMTSI
client in terminal shall have means for choosing which streams to prioritize
and which ones to ignore. This selection can be made based on which streams
are not in DTX mode. Media streams may also be prioritized based on the active
level or volume of the audio stream. However, this requires decoding of the
media from each stream to determine the loudest stream. The prioritized
streams may further be spatially mixed for rendering.
## S.7.5 Floor control interworking with DTMF-capable MTSI clients
If MTSI clients participate in the group video call, not supporting BFCP for
the main video but having successfully negotiated use of DTMF with the MSMTSI
MRF according to Annex G, the MSMTSI MRF may act as a signalling gateway
between DTMF and BFCP main video floor control. It is then assumed that the
MSMTSI MRF is configured with a DTMF sequence that can be used to request and
release that BFCP floor, and that this DTMF sequence is somehow communicated
to the MTSI client, but the details of that are out of scope for this
specification.
If such MTSI client uses the designated DTMF sequence to request the main
video floor, it shall be treated in the MSMTSI MRF as equivalent to receiving
a BFCP request for the main video floor.
Lacking other possibilities to indicate main video floor grant status back to
such DTMF-requesting MTSI client, the MSMTSI MRF should send its main video
back to it as long as it owns the main video floor.
When the MTSI client owning the main video floor uses the DTMF sequence to
release the main video floor, it shall be treated in the MSMTSI MRF as
equivalent to receiving a BFCP release for the main video floor.
# S.8 Rate Adaptation
An MSMTSI client in the terminal should know which RTP streams that share a
common channel resource (such as a radio bearer), and shall take this into
account when performing per-stream rate adaptation. Per-stream adaptation is
specified in clause 10. An MSMTSI MRF should, unless explicitly configured
otherwise, assume during rate adaptation that all media streams of the same
SDP media type (audio, video, etc) from a single MSMTSI client share a common
channel resource. The sum of bitrates used for streams sharing a common
channel resource shall be controlled such that they jointly do not exceed the
estimated available channel resource. This applies to all MSMTSI clients both
in the send direction and in the receive direction, providing rate adaptation
information feedback (e.g. TMMBR or any rate control mechanism natively
available to the used codec) to the sending party.
In situations where a MSMTSI client or MRF media sender that has the ability
to send multiple media streams is faced with scarce network resources,
insufficient to support maximum bitrate for all streams the sender is capable
to send, it can be necessary for the sender to choose which streams to either
entirely omit, temporarily stop, or degrade more than others. Degrading all
streams evenly may not be the best approach, but consistently degrading one
stream at a time may also not be preferable. The individual media receiver of
those multiple streams is likely the one best equipped to decide which streams
are most interesting to receive in a specific communication scenario, but some
general guidance can be given. It is recommended that the main audio stream is
considered most important, except for special use cases that do not require
use of audio. Screenshare video is likely next most important, after which
comes main video and BFCP. When using simulcast, main video simulcast using
different codecs is likely more important than video thumbnail simulcast.
Video thumbnails are likely least important in most use cases.
###### ## Annex T (informative): SDP examples for Multi-party Multimedia
Conference Media Handling
# T.1 General
## T.1.1 Introduction
This annex gives a few examples of media portions from possible SDP offers and
answers involving an MSMTSI client and/or MSMTSI MRF. It is not feasible to
cover all possible variants of different communication scenarios and MSMTSI
capabilities and hence these examples should be regarded as just a few
examples of many possible alternatives. For brevity, these examples do not
make use of all functionality (like robustness etc) or list all codecs that
could be used in a real SDP offer/answer, and for the same reason also limits
the number of supported streams compared to what could be used in a real SDP
offer/answer.
## T.1.2 Quality of Service examples
This clause describes how the QoS bandwidth is reserved for MMCMH sessions
based on the codec and bandwidth information in the SDP answer, the number of
conference participants, and the topology of the multi-party session.
When determining the QoS bandwidth to reserve for the MMCMH session, the SDP
answer is examined for the following:
> • When simulcast is included, the bandwidth reserved for the transmission of
> the media (on either the uplink or downlink) is enough to cover the
> simulcast. If multiple media formats are sent concurrently then the reserved
> bandwidth is enough to carry the sum of their bandwidth requirements. If
> media formats are sent alternatively, then the reserved bandwidth is enough
> to carry the bandwidth requirements of the highest codec rate that can be
> used.
>
> • If multiple active media lines are included, the reserved bandwidth is
> enough to carry the sum of the bandwidth requirements of each active media
> line.
Table T.0 provides examples of the QoS bandwidth that could be reserved for
the example SDP answers listed in the rest of this Annex.

# T.2 MSMTSI video offer/answer examples
## T.2.1 MSMTSI offer/answer towards an MTSI client
This offer includes sending two different simulcast streams for the main
video, receiving two thumbnail videos, both sending and receiving screenshare
video, and has support for BFCP to control screenshare and (possibly) main
video, which are all features that can be supported by MSMTSI but that are not
supported by a regular MTSI client. All audio is omitted in this example, for
brevity, but could be added according to the other examples (e.g., in Clause
T.3) in this annex.
Video levels are in this example aligned with the maximum size of the video
stream, and the maximum receive bandwidth limit is set by the \"b=\"-line
rather than just implicitly by the video level bandwidth limit.
The main video is listed as the first video \"m=\"-line and is also explicitly
identified through \"a=content:main\".
One subsequent \"m=\"-line is explicitly identified as screenshare video,
using \"a=content:slides\".
The rest of the video \"m=\"-lines indicate support for two additional,
receive-only video thumbnails.
All video \"m=\"-lines offer support for RTP level pause/resume, indicated
through \"a=rtcp-fb:* ccm pause\". The \"nowait\" parameter is set, indicating
that the MSMTSI client expects the RTP media streams to be sent point-to-point
on RTP level. That can for example be either between MSMTSI clients in
terminal, or between an MSMTSI client in terminal and an MSMTSI MRF. In either
case, the \"nowait\" parameter indicates it is not expected that multiple
receivers of the RTP streams are able to send RTCP back to request RTP level
pause/resume.
Support for reduced-size RTCP (see clause 7.3.6 and [87]) is offered for all
video \"m=\"-lines, to save bandwidth for RTCP feedback messages listed on
\"a=rtcp-fb\"-lines.
BFCP support is offered with client role.
Blank lines are here added in the SDP for improved readability, but are not
included in an actual SDP. SDP lines specifically interesting to this example
are highlighted in **bold** , which would also not be the case in an actual
SDP.

The answerer, being an MTSI client, knows of no MSMTSI features, but has
correctly disabled all of them in the SDP answer, according to generic SDP
offer/answer rules, keeping unsupported \"m=\"-lines with port set to zero,
leaving the session effectively identical to a regular MTSI session with a
single video and mono audio.
## T.2.2 MSMTSI answer from an MSMTSI MRF
This example assumes the same offer as in Table T.1, which is thus not
repeated here, but the answerer is here an MSMTSI MRF, supporting all of the
offered MSMTSI-specific features. All audio is omitted in this example, for
brevity, but could be added according to any of the other examples in this
annex.
Note that the \"isFocus\" tag, identifying this answer as an MRF, is included
as part of SIP headers and is thus not visible in the SDP in this example.
The MSMTSI MRF accepts to receive the two offered simulcast streams for the
main video. Then, the MSMTSI MRF can send video for the two supported
thumbnails, and can also control both main video and screenshare video through
BFCP.
It can be noted that the MSMTSI MRF needs to keep all payload type formats
that it accepts to use for simulcast on the \"m=\"-line in the answer.
The MSMTSI MRF is, by including the RTP-level \"nowait\" parameter on the
\"a=rtcp-fb:* ccm pause\" line in the SDP answer, confirming that exchange of
RTP level pause/resume messages will be point-to-point and no hold-off period
will therefore be necessary when resuming paused streams (see [156]).
Support for reduced-size RTCP (see clause 7.3.6 and [87]) is accepted for all
video \"m=\"-lines, to save bandwidth for RTCP feedback messages listed on
\"a=rtcp-fb\"-lines.
The \"a=label\" lines are added by the MSMTSI MRF to support identification of
BFCP-controlled \"m=\"-lines, relating BFCP floor identifications to
\"m=\"-lines through \"a=floorid\" lines under the BFCP \"m=\"-line. In this
example, both the main video and the screenshare video \"m=\"-lines are floor
controlled. The thumbnail videos are however not floor controlled, so there
are no \"a=label\" lines for those \"m=\"-lines.
Blank lines are here added in the SDP for improved readability, but are not
included in an actual SDP. SDP lines specifically interesting to this example
are highlighted in **bold** , which would also not be the case in an actual
SDP.

## T.2.3 MSMTSI answer from an MSMTSI client in terminal
This example assumes the same offer as in clause T.2, which is thus not
repeated here, but the answerer is here an MSMTSI client in terminal,
supporting all of the offered MSMTSI-specific features, although not all of
them are feasible to use between MSMTSI clients in terminal. All audio is
omitted in this example, for brevity, but could be added according to any of
the other examples in this annex.
Note that the \"isFocus\" tag is here not included as part of the SIP headers
(compare to annex T.3). This information is used by the answering MSMTSI
client to construct an appropriate SDP answer.
The answering MSMTSI client has no reason to send any thumbnail videos to
another MSMTSI client in terminal, and has thus disabled them. There is no
need for simulcast, meaning that the simulcast attribute and the corresponding
\"a=rid\" attributes are removed from the SDP and simulcast will not be used.
It can however act as BFCP server and can also support simultaneous main video
and screen sharing, which are both kept.
Blank lines are here added in the SDP for improved readability, but are not
included in an actual SDP. SDP lines specifically interesting to this example
are highlighted in **bold** , which would also not be the case in an actual
SDP.

## T.2.4 MSMTSI simulcast offer using a single payload type
This example offer is an excerpt of just the first \"m=\" block from the
example in clause T.2.1 and effectively offers the same functionality, but
does not make use of different payload types to distinguish the simulcast
formats. Instead different \"a=rid\" constraints parameters are used. Because
there is only a single format listed on the \"m=\" line containing the
\"a=simulcast\" line, the \"a=rid\" lines contains constraints parameters
(here max-width and max-height) to differentiate the simulcast formats.
SDP lines specifically interesting to this example are highlighted in **bold**
, which would not be the case in an actual SDP.

for the main audio, receiving two additional audio participants for local
rendering, and receiving codec simulcast for all received audio streams. All
video is omitted in this example, for brevity, but could be added according to
any of the other examples in this annex.
Three different codecs are offered as audio simulcast in the send direction,
separated by semicolons. In the simulcast receive direction, a single stream
is offered, explicitly accepting three different alternative simulcast
formats, separated by comma, which means that the used audio codec (RTP
payload format) is allowed to change from one RTP packet to the next.
Blank lines are here added in the SDP for improved readability, but are not
included in an actual SDP. SDP lines specifically interesting to this example
are highlighted in **bold** , which would also not be the case in an actual
SDP.

## T.3.2 MSMTSI answer with multi-stream audio support
This answer builds on the offer in annex T.3.1, includes multi-stream audio,
accepting to receive simulcast with multiple codecs for the main audio,
sending two additional audio participants for local rendering, and sending
codec simulcast for all received audio streams. All video is omitted in this
example, for brevity, but could be added according to any of the other
examples in this annex.
The three different codecs from the offer are accepted as audio simulcast in
the receive direction, separated by semicolons. In the simulcast send
direction, a single stream is accepted, explicitly listing three different
alternative simulcast formats, separated by comma, which means that the used
audio codec (RTP payload format) may change from one RTP packet to the next.
As in annex T.2.2, it can be noted that the MSMTSI MRF needs to keep all
payload type formats that it accepts to use for simulcast on the \"m=\"-line
in the answer.
Blank lines are here added in the SDP for improved readability, but not
included in an actual SDP. SDP lines specifically interesting to this example
are highlighted in **bold** , which would also not be the case in an actual
SDP.

## T.3.3 MSMTSI CCCEx SDP offer/answer example
Table T.7 shows example concurrent codec combinations supported at the
terminal. All video is omitted in this example, for brevity, but could be
added according to any of the other examples in this annex. As shown in Table
T.7, the terminal may have identified three possible CCCEx combinations
through profiles (shown for 6 participants). SDP offer examples from the
terminal to the MRF for profile A is shown in Table T.8. The MSMTSI MRF may
then send an SDP answer as shown using the simulcast attribute and multiple
m-lines in Table T.9 enabling a multi-stream multiparty conference (among 6
participants).

## T.3.3a MSMTSI offer/answer examples using the compact CCC SDP attribute
Table T.3a1 shows an example SDP offer using the compact ccc_list SDP
attribute to simultaneously describe the three media configurations listed for
N=6 in Table T.7. Note that the media configuration for the codec is broader
than all the concurrent codec configurations that can be supported by the
offering MSMTSI terminal. Similar to table T.8, all video is omitted in this
example for brevity, but could be added according to any of the other examples

An answering MSMTSI MRF that supports the ccc_list attribute may then send an
SDP answer as shown Table T.x2, including the ccc_list attribute and using the
simulcast attribute and multiple m-lines to enable a multi-stream multiparty
conference among 6 participants. The included ccc_list attribute indicates the
full capabilities of the MRF to concurrently switch multiple audio streams (10
EVS, 5 AMR-WB, 5 AMR-NB, etc...) towards the offering MSMTSI terminal
eventhough the selected media configurations in the answer are only using a
subset of the MRF's capabilities.

## T.3.4 SIP OPTIONS request for multi-stream audio support
This offer includes multi-stream audio, sending simulcast with multiple codecs
for the main audio, receiving two additional audio participants for local
rendering, and receiving codec simulcast for all received audio streams. All
video is omitted in this example, for brevity, but could be added according to
any of the other examples in this annex.
Blank lines are here added in the SDP for improved readability, but are not
included in an actual SDP. SDP lines specifically interesting to this example
are highlighted in **bold** , which would also not be the case in an actual
SDP.
Table T.11 shows an example SIP OPTIONS request from an MRF or a conference
initiator. Table T.12 shows an example SIP OPTIONS response from a conference
participant to the MRF or the initiator. The SIP OPTIONS response includes the
SDP Offer of the conference participant. From Table T.12, the conference
participant can allow for three concurrent encoding and three concurrent
decoding of audio streams.
