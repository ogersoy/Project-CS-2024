(VAD) (3GPP TS.26.451), Comfort Noise Generation (3GPP TS 26.449),
Discontinuous Transmission (DTX) (3GPP TS 26.450), Error Concealment of Lost
Packets (3GPP TS 26.447), Jitter Buffer Management (JBM) (3GPP TS 26.448), and
AMR-WB Interoperable Function (3GPP TS 26.446). In addition, the present
document specifies conformance testing (FFS).

# 4 General
## 4.1 Introduction
Digital test sequences are necessary to test for a bit exact implementation of
the EVS codec (TS 26.445 [2]), Voice Activity Detection (TS 26.451 [3]),
Comfort Noise Generation (TS 26.449 [4]), Discontinuous Transmission (TS
26.450 [5]), and Concealment of Lost Packets (3GPP TS 26.447 [6]). Jitter
Buffer Management (JBM) (3GPP TS 26.448 [11]), and AMR-WB Interoperable
Function (3GPP TS 26.446 [10]) and for the testing of the bit exactness of
installations of the ANSI C code in TS 26.442 [7]. In addition, test sequences
for the testing of the bit exactness of installations of the ANSI C code in TS
26.443 [8] are provided. For a standard compliant implementation of the above
specifications the encoder and decoder output sequences shall match the
provided output test sequences in the attached ZIP file.
Clause 5 describes the format of the files, which contain the digital test
sequences. Clause 6 describes the test sequences for the EVS codec, including
error concealment of lost packets, the AMR-WB interoperable function. the VAD,
comfort noise generation, discontinuous transmission, the AMR-WB interoperable
function, the EVS jitter buffer management, Clause 7 describes the conformance
testing for non-bit exact implementations of the EVS codec.
# 5 Test sequence format
## 5.1 Introduction to test sequence format
This clause provides information on the format of the digital test sequences
for the EVS codec (TS 26.445 [2]), Voice Activity Detection (TS 26.451 [3]),
Comfort Noise Generation (TS 26.449 [4]), Discontinuous Transmission (TS
