The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardised Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of a multi-vendor 3G-system GSM or UMTS
PLMN.
During the lifetime of a 3G network PLMN, its logical and physical
configuration will undergo changes of varying degrees and frequencies in order
to optimise the utilisation of the network resources. These changes will be
executed through network configuration management activities and/or network
engineering, see GSM TS 12.06 [10] and 3GPP TS 32.106 [3].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of a 3G PLMN network require data on which to base decisions. This
data refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service
offered. In order to produce this data performance measurements are executed
in the NEs, which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an
external system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for
further evaluation. The purpose of the present document and its companion
parts 1 and 3 is to describe the mechanisms involved in the collection of the
data and the definition of the data itself.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the TMN model for the administration of
measurements and the collection of measurement result data in a GSM system. It
also includes the measurement definitions for GSM. The concept and functional
requirements for performance management in wireless GSM and UMTS systems is
set out in TS 32.401 [31].

# 4 Detailed description of the measurement system for a GSM PLMN
## 4.1 Introduction
TS 32.401 [31] describes the required functions for the administration of
performance measurements and the retrieval of their results. For this purpose,
the characteristics of measurement jobs and measurement results have been
defined.
The present document explains how these requirements can be met in a GSM
system using standard OSI systems management functions or SNMP management
operations and, where necessary, tailoring them for GSM PLMN use. In the
following, managed object classes and their properties (attributes,
notifications, etc.) to be used on the object oriented interface between OS
and NEs for the execution of performance management functions are specified.
Note that the implementation of this object oriented approach defined in the
following clauses is optional. As an alternative, vendors can also choose to
implement their GSM systems or GSM parts of combined GSM/UMTS systems
according to the interface definition and requirements specified in TS 32.401
[31], which implies that:
\- for measurement administration, the functional requirements are
standardised, but technology and details of the implementation are vendor
specific;
\- for the retrieval of measurement results, only a file based mechanism for
transfer of results to a Network Manager is standardised.
### 4.1.1 Basic measurement system functions
Before measurement data from the NEs can be collected and the results be
forwarded to the OS, the measurement jobs that generate the required data
shall be activated in the system. In object oriented terms, this corresponds
to the instantiation of managed objects which model the measurement process.
In order to control the measurement process, appropriate attributes of these
objects shall be defined and have to be set to the required/desired values,
either when the objects are created or during the lifetime of the objects. The
specific attributes and their values will determine the measurement schedule,
the measured network resources, the measurement types and the generation of
scheduled result reports as well as the layout of the reports. Scheduled
results can be forwarded to the OS using a notification that is defined
specifically for this purpose as a part of the measurement object class
definitions. A dedicated action will be used for requesting current results of
active measurements.
### 4.1.2 Measurement Object Administration
The management of objects in an open system is performed utilising the
internationally standardised \"Common Management Information Service Element\"
(CMISE ITU-T Recommendation X.710 [13] or IETF RFC 1157 [30]). Managed objects
for the execution of PLMN performance measurement functions can be
instantiated and deleted using the M-CREATE and M-DELETE services or SNMP SET
and GET operations. Reading and modifying attributes of these objects can be
achieved employing the M-GET and M-SET services of CMISE or SET and GET
operations of SNMP. The CMISE M-EVENT-REPORT service and SNMP TRAP is defined
for the emission of notifications, while actions can be executed using the
M-ACTION service.
Specific notifications defined in the OSI object management function (see
ITU-T Recommendation X.730 [15]) are used to notify the OS of the creation and
deletion of managed objects and of the change of attribute values. For the
formal definition of the PLMN performance management object model, refer to
annex C.
The measurement job can be ideally modelled by the managed object class
\"simpleScanner\" as defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.738 [19]. The
\"simpleScanner\" is derived from the \"homogeneousScanner\" object class (see
ITU‑T Recommendation X.738 [19]), which in turn is a specialisation of the
\"scanner\" class of managed objects (see ITU‑T Recommendation X.738 [19]).
The \"simpleScanner\" object has attributes to determine:
\- the measurement types;
\- the measured network resources;
\- the recording periods; and
\- the reporting requirements;
of the measurement job. The \"simpleScanner\" generates measurement result
reports in the form of notifications, according to the attributes that
prescribe the reporting requirements. The measurement transfer requirements
are not modelled in the scanner objects, since generic and general services
are used (see clause 4.3.2 and annex D).
## 4.2 Modelling of measurement jobs
A measurement job is represented by a \"simpleScanner\" object. The following
clauses define how the measurement job characteristics are mapped onto the
properties of the \"simpleScanner\" managed object class, and how the
measurement types of a measurement job are modelled in the PLMN performance
measurement system.
### 4.2.1 Measurement job characteristics
#### 4.2.1.1 Measurement Function
Every measurement job collects measurement data from selected measurement
types across one or more network resources of the same type. The selected
measurement types shall be identical throughout all network resources observed
by a measurement job. For each network resource, the related measurement types
have been grouped in one or more measurement functions.
Measurement functions, are modelled by various \"measurementFunction\" object
classes (see annex C). The measurement types for the PLMN performance
measurement system are defined in annex B, and their result values are
included as attributes in the appropriate \"measurementFunction\" object
class. In case the measurement type is a counter, the attribute represents the
counter value as is. In all other cases, the attribute delivers a calculated
value (e.g. a mean), over the observed period. The \"measurementFunction\"
objects are contained in the objects that represent the network resource to
which the measurement types included in the \"measurementFunction\" refer. All
measurement types that relate only to a network resource alone are grouped
into one \"measurementFunction\" class which is unique for that network
resource. Measurement types that are related to the network resource and the
same type(s) of adjacent resource(s) (e.g. Handover neighbour cell) are also
grouped into one unique type of measurement function which may exist once or
more per instance or per set of that adjacent resource(s). The instances of
the adjacent resources that are to be addressed by the measurement function
are identified by the values of attributes which are part of that specific
\"measurementFunction\" object class definition.
Measurement types that belong together are grouped together in the same
package (e.g. \"immediateAssignmentProcedurePackage\" has attributes
\"attemptedImmediateAssignmentProcedures\" and
\"successfullImmediateAssignmentProcedures\" - for details refer to annex C).
Since all measurement types defined in annex B may or may not be supported by
the system, all packages of a \"measurementFunction\" which contain
measurement attributes are conditional. A \"measurementFunction\" needs to be
created before a \"simpleScanner\" can scan its attributes, i.e. before actual
measurements can be taken. The create request from the OS shall specify the
values of attributes that identify adjacent resources (like Handover neighbour
cell), if any, but it may not specify any measurement attributes of the
\"measurementFunction\" object. Upon creation of a \"measurementFunction\"
object, the system will determine the measurement packages that are included
in the object according to the measurement types the system supports. If
multiple instances of the same \"measurementFunction\" object class are
created, the packages included in the various instances may be different from
instance to instance since the system may have restrictions on how many
measurement packages of the same type it supports. The OS can inquire the
measurement types supported by a \"measurementFunction\" object from the
system, by reading the \"packages\" attribute or the attribute list of the
object (see ITU-T Recommendation X.721 [14]). Unlike the former operation, the
latter, however, will also return values of the measurement attributes which
are not expected to be meaningful at this time (see below). Deletion of the
\"measurementFunction\" will render the measurement types that correspond to
the \"measurementFunction\" attributes unavailable to the OS. Creation and
deletion of a \"measurementFunction\" will be notified to the OS using the
object creation and deletion notifications as defined in ITU-T Recommendation
X.730 [15].
Each measurement job may collect data from one or more measurement types
across one or more network resources, i.e. a \"simpleScanner\" object may make
a choice of one or more \"measurementFunction\" instances and scan the same
set of attributes across all selected measurement functions. For this purpose,
it can scope the set of measurement functions that are eligible for inclusion
in the observation, and it may select measurement functions using filtering
criteria (similar to the concept of scoping and filtering as described in
ITU-T Recommendation X.710 [13]). Alternatively, it can use an explicit list
of \"measurementFunction\" objects for scanning. The \"simpleScanner\" does
not explicitly identify the network resource(s) it measures. Instead, this
information is derived from the containment relationship between the selected
\"measurementFunction\" instances and the objects that model the network
resources, and, where necessary, through specific attributes of the
\"measurementFunction\" objects that identify adjacent resources. In
principle, a \"simpleScanner\" is able to scan attributes of any defined
\"measurementFunction\", but for the purpose of the present document, each
\"simpleScanner\" instance is only required to scan attributes of
\"measurementFunction\" objects that are contained in the same \"xxxFunction\"
object as the \"simpleScanner\" itself, where \"xxx\" stands for \"bss\",
\"msc\", \"hlr\", \"vlr\", \"eir\" or \"smsc\", respectively (see figure C.1).
All measurement attributes of any \"measurementFunction\" should only be read
by a \"simpleScanner\" that has been instantiated for this purpose. By
definition they can be read directly by systems management protocol, but their
values are not expected to have any meaning apart from the scan. Therefore,
the system will not return the \"attribute list\" in the create reply, and the
\"attributeList\" will also not be included in the object creation
notification.
#### 4.2.1.2 Measurement schedule
The measurement schedule specifies the time frame during which the measurement
job will be active. The schedule consist of a measurement start- and stoptime
and one or more recording intervals which may repeat on a daily or weekly
basis. The semantics of the scheduling parameters are described in clause
3.2.1.2.
All of the above parameters are formally defined as attributes of conditional
packages of the \"simpleScanner\" managed object class. The starttime and
stoptime are included in the \"duration\" package and indicate, if the package
is present, the specific point in time at which the \"simpleScanner\" will
become active or inactive, respectively. If the \"simpleScanner\" is
instantiated after the specified starttime, this will have the same effect as
if no starttime was specified (see clause 3.2.1.2).
The optional recording intervals, if specified, further restrict the time
during which the \"simpleScanner\" actively collects measurement data within
the time frame determined by the duration package. The \"dailyScheduling\"
package may be used to define one or more intervals during each day.
Alternatively, the \"weeklyScheduling\" package can be used to define
individual intervals for each day of the week. The recording interval should
be a multiple of the granularity period (if non-zero) and the start- and
endtimes shall be aligned with granularity period boundaries for the system to
accept the values.
It is possible to create several \"simpleScanner\" objects which scan the same
attributes of the same \"measurementFunction\" instances according to
different recording intervals. In this case it is, however, required that
these intervals do not overlap. Consequently, if it is required to measure the
same measurement type with overlapping schedules, it is necessary to have an
appropriate number of instances of the same \"measurementFunction\" available
which all support the required attributes (see clause 4.2.1.1).
For the definition of the syntactical and additional behavioural aspects of
the above parameters, refer to ITU-T Recommendation X.721 [14] and ITU-T
Recommendation X.738 [19].
#### 4.2.1.3 Granularity period
The granularity period defines the periodicity of the generation of results by
a measurement job within the timeframe specified in the scheduling attributes.
The granularity period of a measurement job is determined by the value of the
\"granularityPeriod\" attribute of the \"simpleScanner\". The present document
requires, as a minimum, the support of granularity periods of 5, 15, 30 and 60
minutes.
The value of this attribute shall specify the required value in minutes. The
underlying International Standards allow the modification of the
\"granularityPeriod\" attribute, but for an implementation claiming
conformance to the present document, it is not required that its value be
changeable during the lifetime of the \"simpleScanner\" object. If this value
is 60, measurement results will be generated every full hour. If the value is
30, results will be generated every 0 and 30 minutes past the full hour. If
the value is 15, result output will occur every 0, 15, 30 and 45 minutes past
the full hour, and finally, if the value is 5, the \"simpleScanner\" will
generate output every 5 minutes, synchronised on the full hour. Again,
measurement results are only reported at the end of each granularity period
within the recording interval. Due to these definitions, synchronisation of
granularity periods through the conditional \"periodSynchronisationPackage\"
of the \"simpleScanner\" is not supported in the scope of the present
document.
If periodical generation of results is not required from a \"simpleScanner\"
instance, this can be achieved by specifying the value 0 for the
\"granularityPeriod\" attribute. In this case, it will only be possible to
request current measurement results from the \"simpleScanner\" (see below).
#### 4.2.1.4 Scan reports
At the end of each granularity period within the measurement schedule, the
\"simpleScanner\" will emit a \"scanReport\" notification, defined in ITU-T
Recommendation X.738 [19], which contains the measurement results generated by
the scanner at the end of that granularity period. The information in the
notification shall comprise:
\- the managed object class and managed object instance of the
\"simpleScanner\" that emitted the notification, plus the notification type
(i.e. \"scan report\");
\- a time stamp that indicates the time at which the measurement results were
taken, i.e. the end time of the respective granularity period;
\- for each \"measurementFunction\" object from which measurements were taken
by the scanner, a list of measurement attribute values and optional attribute
identifiers, plus a suspect flag for each attribute that indicates the
validity of the result value. Missing data is indicated in the list. The time
stamp that indicates the time offset forward from scan initiation until the
value of the measurement attribute was actually taken is not supported in the
PLMN measurement system;
\- for an incomplete scan the reason why the scan could not be completed.
The definition of the \"scanReport\" notification in ITU-T Recommendation
X.738 [19] provides some flexibility with respect to the actual layout of the
report. In the PLMN performance measurement system, the following options can
be selected:
\- suppressing the reporting of the identification of the
\"measurementFunction\" object from which the measurements reported in the
notification were collected. This is only useful when the identification of
the \"measuremntFunction\" can be determined by other means, or if the
identification is not required by the OS (e.g. when the statistics are to be
calculated);
\- omitting the attribute identifiers from the report. In this case, the
attribute values are reported in an agreed order, which is defined by an
attribute of the \"simpleScanner\";
\- measurement values that are identical throughout all \"mesurementFunction\"
instances from which the scanner takes measurements may be included in the
report only once.
ITU-T Recommendation X.738 [19] defines in detail the attributes of the
\"simpleScanner\" which are used to control the above features. Additional
options of ITU-T Recommendation X.738 [19] which are not listed here are not
supported in the PLMN performance measurement system (see conformance
requirements in clause 4.4).
### 4.2.2 Scanner state and status attributes
State and status indicators are defined for the measurement job in clause
3.2.2 of the present document. These are modelled through appropriate
attributes which reflect the state and status of the \"simpleScanner\" object.
These attributes are: administrativeState, operationalState and
availabilityStatus.
**administrativeState:** the administrativeState attribute is used to suspend
and resume the scanning performed by the \"simpleScanner\". This attribute can
be altered by means of CMISE M-SET service or SNMP SET operation for the
applicable \"simpleScanner\" object instance.
**operationalState** : the operationalState attribute represents the
operational capability of the scanner to perform it\'s functions.
**availabilityStatus** : the availabilityStatus attribute reflects whether or
not the simpleScanner object instance is active according to the measurement
schedule.
Any changes to the values of the administrativeState and the operationalState
attributes will be reported to the OS using the \"stateChange\" notification,
as defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.731 [16].
Further details about these attributes can be found in ITU-T Recommendation
X.738 [19].
### 4.2.3 Scanner administration
The generic CMISE services M-CREATE, M-DELETE, M-GET and M-SET or SNMP SET and
GET, applied to a simpleScanner managed object instance respectively represent
creation, deletion, display and modification of a measurement job. A CMISE
M-ACTION primitive or SNMP SET with a specific action type for activating a
scan report is defined for the retrieval of the current values of measurement
results.
**Creating a \"simpleScanner\":** a \"simpleScanner\" can be created by
issuing an appropriate M-CREATE request or SNMP SET request. On creation of
the object, all attribute values have to be supplied that determine:
\- the selection of \"measurementFunction\" instances and their attributes
which shall be measured;
\- the schedule of the \"simpleScanner\"; and
\- the reporting requirements;
as defined in previous clauses. The \"measurementFunction\" objects shall be
created before the scanner can be instantiated, and the measurement attributes
specified in the scanner shall be present in the selected
\"measurementFunction\" instances, for the scan to return its results. For
each object that does not exist, an empty report shall be returned and for
each attribute that does not exist, an empty value shall be returned within
the report. The relationship between the scan attributes and the scanner is
explained in ITU-T Recommendation X.738 [19].
**Modifying \"simpleScanner\" attributes:** modification of \"simpleScanner\"
attributes may be requested by the OS during the lifetime of a scanner, using
the CMISE M-SET or SNMP SET operation. The conditions for modification of
attributes of the \"simpleScanner\" are specified in ITU-T Recommendation
X.738 [19], but some additional restrictions, defined in the present document
with respect to the changeability of \"simpleScanner\" attributes, apply in
the PLMN performance measurement system.
**Displaying scanner objects:** the system operator can get a list of all
\"simpleScanner\" objects that currently exist in the system, together with
all available information as stored in the NE. This information consists of
the data that was supplied on creation/modification of the objects and the
values of the state and status attributes of the \"simpleScanner\" objects.
The CMISE M-GET or SNMP GET operation can be used to selectively retrieve the
required information from the system. For details see ITU-T Recommendation
X.710 [13].
**Deleting a \"simpleScanner\":** a \"simpleScanner\" instance is
automatically deleted by the system when the scheduled endtime is reached and
all result reports, either scheduled or on request have been generated. A
\"simpleScanner\" object can also be deleted by manual intervention, utilising
the CMISE M‑DELETE or SNMP SET operation, at any time. When deleted, the
measurement process associated with the scanner is stopped, and all allocated
resources are released.
**Suspending/resuming scanner operation:** on normal operation, the
\"simpleScanner\" collects measurement data from the selected
\"measurementFunction\" objects according to the values of the
\"simpleScanner\" attributes. However, the system operator may decide for some
reason to discard temporarily the collection of measurement data (e.g. in case
of system overload or congestion, measurement results not used, ...). The
system operator therefore is able to suspend scanner operation at any time,
setting the administrativeState attribute to \"locked\". This implies that the
\"simpleScanner\" instance remains in the system, but no measurement gathering
and result reporting activities are performed for this scanner. When scanner
operation is resumed, i.e. the administrativeState is \"unlocked\",
measurement data collection and result reporting is started again at the next
full granularity period within the measurement schedule.
**Requesting current measurement result values:** the system operator may for
some reason be interested in the current values of the measurement results of
a particular measurement process, independently of the scheduled data
collection and reporting of the respective scanner, e.g. for tracing the
increment of some of the measurement attributes. To this aim, the
\"activateScanReport\" CMISE M-ACTION or SNMP GET is used as defined in ITU-T
Recommendation X.738 [19]. The action reply will return current results
according to the attributes of the scanner that govern the generation of the
\"scanReport\" notification, i.e. the format of the reply is identical to that
of scheduled reports generated by the scanner. Any such request does not
affect the underlying measurement process, and may only be issued when the
scanner is operating according to its schedule and not suspended (i.e.
\"offduty\" not present in the availability status, administrative state
equals \"unlocked\"), otherwise an error will be returned.
## 4.3 Modelling of measurement results
Each measurement produces a result at the end of the granularity period or on
request of the OS. Annex B provides for each measurement type a description of
the expected measurement result. Annex C contains the formal definition of the
attribute that represents the measurement type.
### 4.3.1 Characteristics of the result report
A scheduled result report is generated in the form of a \"scanReport\"
notification. Current measurement results requested by the OS using the
\"activateScanReport\" action will be supplied by the system in the reply to
the request. All measurement attributes that are observed by a
\"simpleScanner\" object are included in a single report or action reply,
respectively. The layout of the two result reports - notification or action
reply - is identical, as far as the contained measurement information is
concerned. For details on the result report characteristics, please refer to
the previous clauses.
### 4.3.2 Result report transfer control
Result reports from a \"simpleScanner\" object are either produced according
to the measurement schedule (notification) or on receipt of an explicit
request (action) from the OS. There are no mechanisms to control the
forwarding of the reply to that request (action reply), or to store it in the
NE. There are, however, functions to determine the forwarding, local storage
in the NE and deferred retrieval of the \"scanReport\" notification. These
functions are described in the following clauses.
The forwarding of notifications can be controlled by the OS via \"Event
Forwarding Discriminator\" (EFD) objects, as defined in ITU-T Recommendation
X.734 [17]. For each EFD, the OS can specify a discriminator construct which
will be applied as a filter to any event report generated in the system. If an
event report passes the filter, a notification will be forwarded to the OS
accordingly. The following filter criteria are allowed in an EFD for the PLMN
performance measurement system:
\- the event type, which allows to enable or disable completely the forwarding
of scan report notifications;
\- the \"simpleScanner\" managed object instance, which allows to restrict
forwarding of result reports to those that are generated by specific scanner
instances;
\- the time stamp contained in the scan report (\"scanInitiationTime\"), which
allows to selectively enable the forwarding of result reports that were
generated at a specific time or during specific periods of time;
\- any operation on the above attributes in any combination.
Measurement result reports can be stored in the NE. This property is modelled
through the managed object class \"log\", as specified in ITU-T Recommendation
X.721 [14] and \"log control function\" as specified in ITU-T Recommendation
X.735 [18]. The storage of event reports in the \"log\" can be controlled
through a discriminator construct, similar to the event forwarding control.
The present document requires for the \"log\" discriminator construct the same
criteria as for the EFD discriminator construct.
All scan report notifications that pass the discriminator construct of the
\"log\" will create a \"scanReportRecord\" object which is contained in the
log. These records can be retrieved by the OS at any time, as defined in ITU-T
Recommendation X.735 [18] and ITU-T Recommendation X.710 [13], using either
CMISE, SNMP, FTP or using FTAM (see annex D). The use of FTAM or FTP services
is especially suitable for bulk data transfer. From the common procedures
defined in GSM TS 12.00 [8] for data transfer in a PLMN, only the method that
provides logged information into file(s) can be used for the measurement
system. The \"resultType\" requested in the action will identify the
appropriate log instance(s) as the source of the measurement data, and
optionally additional filter criteria which determines the actual records to
be put into the file(s) can be supplied. The filter criteria that shall be
supported are identical to those defined for the discriminator construct of
the logs. On receipt of the action, the requested records will be put into one
or more files, which will then be made available to the OS. The format of the
records in the file shall be according to the definition of the
\"scanReportRecord\" as given in ITU-T Recommendation X.738 [19].
Since all measurement attributes and the identification of the network
resource observed by a \"simpleScanner\" are included in a single attribute of
the result reports, it is not possible to filter on the measured resource or
the measurement type. If the selective forwarding/logging/retrieval of
measurement results referring to individual network resources or individual
measurement types is required by the system operator, then \"simpleScanner\"
objects shall be instantiated such that the scanner identity will implicitly
identify the measured resource and measurement types, i.e. the scanner
attributes should be set such that the scanner observes only the specific
resources and/or the specific measurement attributes which shall be filtered,
according to the system operator\'s requirements.
## 4.4 Conformance requirements
In the following clause, conformance requirements for object classes,
notifications and actions defined in ITU-T Recommendation X.738 [19] are
specified. In cases where requirements in the present document restrict
options of ITU-T Recommendation X.738 [19], like e.g. changeability of
attribute values, the conditions of the present document shall apply.

###### ## Annex C (normative): Performance Measurement Object Model
This annex to GSM 12.04 comprises the Object Model for Performance Measurement
to complement the high level Object Model in GSM 12.00 [8].
The whole management approach defined in GSM 12.00 [8] defines all entities of
GSM network as managed functions. These are BSS, MSC, HLR etc. and one or more
of these can be contained in managed element and each of these functions can
contain it\'s own measurement function.
The SGSN and GGSN detailed, are additional to GSM 12.00 [8] due to the
introduction of GPRS.
**Model Structure and Content**
The following measurement function model takes its basis from the proposed GSM
12.00 [8] high level model. Figure C.1 shows the containment tree of all the
measurement Object Classes. The formal GDMO definitions of the Managed Object
Classes concerning measurement functions are described in this clause, except
the \"log\", which is described in annex D under data transfer requirements.
Figure C.1: GSM 12.04 Performance Measurement Object Class Containment
# C.1 Measurement Managed Object Classes
## C.1.1 object class from ITU-T ISO
The object class used by the present document is the simple scanner, as
defined in ISO 10164-13 [34]. Within the realm of the present document, each
\"simpleScanner\" instance is only required to scan attributes of
\"measurementFunction\" objects that are contained in the same \"xxxFunction\"
object as the \"simpleScanner\" itself, where \"xxx\" stands for \"bss\",
\"msc\", \"hlr\", \"vlr\", \"eir\", \"sgsn\", \"ggsn\" or \"smsc\",
respectively (see containment tree diagram on previous page).

###### ## Annex D (normative): Data Transfer Requirements
This annex defines the data transfer requirements from the NE to the OS for
the present document. The present document makes use of the generic approach
to EFD, Log and File transfer facility as defined in GSM 12.00 [8].
# D.1 Data Transfer Requirements
## D.1.1 General
The GSM 12.04 defines how statistical information concerning various aspects
of the NE\'s can be collected. Once this data is collected and available in
the NE, it shall be possible to transfer it to the OS. The way in which this
can be achieved is described in GSM 12.00 [8].
GSM 12.00 [8] describes the generic solutions to data transfer requirements
which are used by GSM 12.04. This annex describes the additional information
required to fully satisfy the data transfer requirements of GSM 12.04,
containment of which is described in annex C.
Of the data transfer functions described in GSM 12.00 [8], GSM 12.04 requires
the upload function, i.e. OS controlled data transfer from NE to OS.
# D.2 Object Model
## D.2.1 Managed Object Classes
### D.2.1.1 \"Recommendation X.721: 1992\": log
Object instances of this class are used to store incoming event reports. An
instance of this class can be created to store specifically scan report
notifications (in form of \"scanReportRecords\" managed objects). This is
achieved by using the discriminator construct and filtering on the event type
information.
### D.2.1.2 \"Recommendation X.738: 1993\": scanReportRecord
objects of this class are used to represent logged information that resulted
from Attribute Value Change Notifications and are contained in a \'log\'
instance.
## D.2.2 Name Bindings
### D.2.2.1 log-managedElement
log-managedElement **NAME BINDING**
**SUBORDINATE OBJECT CLASS** \"Recommendation X.721: 1992\": log;
**NAMED BY superior object class** \"Recommendation M.3100: 1992\":
managedElement;
**WITH ATTRIBUTE** \"Recommendation X.721: 1992\": logId;
**CREATE** ;
**DELETE** ;
**REGISTERED AS** { gsm1204NameBinding 221 };
### D.2.2.2 scanReportRecord-log
scanReportRecord-log **NAME BINDING**
**SUBORDINATE OBJECT CLASS** \"Recommendation X.738: 1993\": scanReportRecord;
**NAMED BY superior object class** \"Recommendation X.721: 1992\": log;
**WITH ATTRIBUTE** \"Recommendation X.721: 1992\": logRecordId;
**DELETE** ;
**REGISTERED AS** { gsm1204NameBinding 222 };
###### ## Annex E (informative): Non Standardised Measurements of Interest to
PLMN Management
Following is the template used to describe the measurements contained in this
annex.
A. Description
\- A short explanation of the measurement operation.
B. Collection Method
\- The form in which this measurement data is obtained:
\- **CC** (Cumulative Counter).
\- **GAUGE** (dynamic variable), used when data being measured can vary up or
down during the period of measurement.
\- **DER** (Discrete Event Registration), when data related to a particular
event are captured every nth event is registered, where n can be 1 or larger.
\- **SI** (Status Inspection).
**Inception of annex E**
The annex E has been created to contain all the measurements that are **NOT**
candidates for standardisation, (indication that they have been considered).
At the end of the annex there are also references to the Fixed Network
measurements, which have been included for completeness.
NOTE: The measurements in this annex are for information only and as a
consequence are **NOT** included in the Object Model (annex C).
