This clause is mandatory; do not alter the text in any way other than to
choose between \"Specification\" and \"Report\".
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been

In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document establishes the minimum RF characteristics and minimum
performance requirements of NR Integrated access and backhaul (IAB).
The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for NR Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) type 1-H.
These have been derived from, and are consistent with the conducted
requirements for NR Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) type 1-H in NR
Integrated access and backhaul specification defined in TS 38.174 [2].
An _IAB type 1-H_ has both conducted and radiated requirements so it requires
compliance to the applicable requirements of the present document and TS
38.176-2 [3].
_IAB type 1-O_ and IAB _type 2-O_ have only radiated requirements so they
require compliance to TS 38.176-2 [3] only.
# 2 References {#references-1}

# 4 General conducted test conditions and declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 1 of the
present document, i.e. to all conducted tests defined for FR1. The frequency
ranges FR1 and FR2 are defined in clause 5.1 of TS 38.174 [2].
The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.174 [2] and the references
therein. Test Tolerances for the conducted test requirements explicitly stated
in the present document are given in Annex C of the present document.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances
are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in Annex C.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
#### 4.1.2.1 General
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where appropriate.
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for test requirements
included by reference is defined in the respective referred test
specification.
For _IAB type 1-H_ when a requirement is applied per _TAB connector_ then the
test uncertainty is applied to the measured value. When a requirement is
applied for a group of _TAB connectors_ then the test uncertainty is applied
to sum of the measured power on each _TAB connector_ in the group.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause 4.1.2 apply
to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not include
system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.

#### 6.4.2.4 Method of test
##### 6.4.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment:
\- normal; see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier:
\- M; see clause 4.9.1.
RF bandwidth positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:
\- MRFBW in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1;
\- BRFBW_T\'RFBW and B\'RFBW_TRFBW in multi-band operation, see clause 4.9.1.
##### 6.4.2.4.2 Procedure
The minimum requirement is applied to all _TAB connectors_ , they may be
tested one at a time or multiple _TAB connectors_ may be tested in parallel as
shown in annex D.1.1 for _IAB type 1-H_. If IAB simultaneous transmission is
declared to be supported (see D.IAB-2 in table 4.6-1), connector(s) for IAB-MT
and IAB-DU may be tested one at a time or TAB connectors may be tested in
parallel as shown in Annex D.1.1 for _IAB type 1-H_. Whichever method is used
the procedure is repeated until all _TAB connectors_ necessary to demonstrate
conformance have been tested.
1) Connect _TAB connector_ to measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1
for _IAB type 1-H_. All _TAB connectors_ not under test shall be terminated.
As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should
be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result
should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
2) For single carrier set the _TAB connector_ under test to transmit according
to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding
test models or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2 at manufacturers
declared _rated carrier output power_ per _TAB connector_ (P~rated,c,TABC~,
D.21).
For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit on all carriers
configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power
setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.
3) Measure the mean power spectral density over 70/N μs filtered with a square
filter of bandwidth equal to the RF bandwidth of the _TAB connector_ centred
on the central frequency of the RF bandwidth. 70/N μs average window centre is
set from 35/N μs after end of one transmitter ON period + 10 μs to 35/N μs
before start of next transmitter ON period \-- 10 μs. N = SCS/15, where SCS is
Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.
4) For a _TAB connector_ supporting contiguous CA, measure the mean power
spectral density over 70/N μs filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal
to the _aggregated IAB channel bandwidth_ BW~Channel_CA~ centred on
(F~edge_high~+F~edge_low~)/2. 70/N μs average window centre is set from 35/N
μs after end of one transmitter ON period + 10 μs to 35/N μs before start of
next transmitter ON period \-- 10 μs. N = SCS/15, where SCS is the smallest
supported Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz in the _aggregated IAB channel
bandwidth_.
In addition, for _multi-band connector(s)_ , the following steps shall apply:
5) For _multi-band connectors_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
#### 6.4.2.5 Test requirements
The measured mean power spectral density according to clause 6.4.2.4.2 shall
be less than -83 dBm/MHz for carrier frequency f ≤ 3.0 GHz.
The measured mean power spectral density according to clause 6.4.2.4.2 shall
be less than -82.5 dBm/MHz for carrier frequency 3.0 GHz \ 3.0GHz ±(0.1
ppm + 36 Hz)

### 6.5.3 Modulation quality
#### 6.5.3.1 Definition and applicability
Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured carrier
signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be expressed as Error
Vector Magnitude (EVM). The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the
difference between the ideal symbols and the measured symbols after the
equalization. This difference is called the error vector.
For _IAB type 1-H_ this requirement shall be applied at each _TAB connector_
supporting transmission in the _operating band._
#### 6.5.3.2 Minimum Requirement
For IAB-DU, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2], clause 6.5.2.1.
For IAB-MT, the minimum requirement is in TS 38.174 [2], clause 6.5.2.2.
#### 6.5.3.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify that modulation quality is within the limit
specified by the minimum requirement.
#### 6.5.3.4 Method of test
##### 6.5.3.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see clause 4.9.1.

### 6.5.4 Time alignment error
#### 6.5.4.1 Definition and applicability
For IAB-DU, this requirement applies to frame timing in MIMO transmission,
carrier aggregation and their combinations. There's no time alignment error
requirement for IAB-MT.
Frames of the NR signals present at the IAB-DU transmitter _TAB connectors_
are not perfectly aligned in time and may experience certain timing
differences in relation to each other.
For _IAB type 1-H_ , the TAE is defined as the largest timing difference
between any two signals belonging to _TAB connectors_ belonging to different
transmitter groups at the _transceiver array boundary_ , where transmitter
groups are associated with the _TAB connectors_ in the transceiver unit array
corresponding to MIMO transmission, _carrier aggregation_ for a specific set
of signals/transmitter configuration/transmission mode.
#### 6.5.4.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirements for _IAB-DU_ are in TS 38.174 [2], clause 6.5.3.1.
#### 6.5.4.3 Test purpose

##### 6.5.4.4.2 Procedure
For _IAB type 1-H_ _TAB connectors_ to be tested are identified from the
declared sets of _TAB connector beam forming groups_ in the TAE groups
declaration (D.31).
Compliance is to be demonstrated between all pairs of _single-band connectors
and/or multi-band connectors_ , however it is not required to exhaustively
measure TAE between every combination of pairs of representative connectors.
Compliance can be demonstrated by comparison of a reduced set of
representative measurement results.
1) Conducted measurement setup:
\- For _IAB type 1-H_ : Connect two representative _TAB connectors_ one from
separate TAE group (D.31) to the measurement equipment according to annex
D.1.4. Terminate any unused _TAB connector(s)._
2) Set the connectors under test to transmit IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1 or any DL signal

## 6.6 Unwanted emissions
### 6.6.1 General
Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious emissions
according to ITU definitions in recommendation ITU-R SM.329 [5]. In ITU
terminology, out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside
the _channel bandwidth_ resulting from the modulation process and non-
linearity in the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious
emissions are emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such
as harmonics emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and
frequency conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
The out-of-band emissions requirement for the IAB-DU and IAB-MT transmitter is
specified both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and
_operating band_ unwanted emissions (OBUE).
The maximum offset of the _operating band_ unwanted emissions mask from the
_operating band_ edge is Δf~OBUE~. The Operating band unwanted emissions
define all unwanted emissions in each supported downlink _operating band_ of
IAB-DU and uplink _operating band_ of IAB-MT, plus the frequency ranges
Δf~OBUE~ above and Δf~OBUE~ below each band. Unwanted emissions outside of
this frequency range are limited by a spurious emissions requirement.
The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in tables 6.6.1-1 and 6.6.1-2 for the NR
_operating bands_.

##### 6.6.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted signal using at least the
number of measurement points, and across a span, as listed in table
6.6.2.4.2-1. The selected resolution bandwidth (RBW) filter of the analyser
shall be 30 kHz or less.

NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyser will not have any effect on
the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW power are the same
as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected to have the Rayleigh
distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In any case where the
statistics are not the same, though, the detection mode must be power
responding. The analyser may be set to respond to the average of the power
(root-mean-square of the voltage) across the measurement cell.
2) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel units) of
all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1, the power
outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the total power
outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied percentage)) of P0.
For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005 times P0.
3) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds P1.
4) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from f2 to the end of the span exceeds P1.
5) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.
In addition, for a multi-band capable IAB, the following step shall apply:
6) For multi-band capable IAB and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single carrier test models shall apply, with no
carrier activated in the other band. In addition, when contiguous CA is
supported, single band test configurations and test models shall apply with no
carrier activated in the other band.
#### 6.6.2.5 Test requirements
The occupied bandwidth for each carrier shall be less than the channel
bandwidth as defined in TS 38.174 [2], table 5.3.5-1. For contiguous CA, t**he
occupied bandwidth shall be less than or equal to the _aggregated IAB channel
bandwidth_ as defined in** TS 38.174 [2], clause 5.3A.
### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio
#### 6.6.3.1 General
Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean
power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power
centred on an adjacent channel frequency.
The requirements shall apply outside the _IAB-DU RF Bandwidth, IAB-MT RF
Bandwidth_ or _Radio Bandwidth_ whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by
the manufacturer's specification.
For an _IAB- node_ operating in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , the ACLR
requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in _sub-block gaps_ for the
frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-3, while the CACLR requirement in
clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in _sub-block gaps_ for the frequency ranges
defined in table 6.6.3.2-4.
For a _multi-band connector_ , the ACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall
apply in _Inter RF Bandwidth gaps_ for the frequency ranges defined in table
6.6.3.2-3, while the CACLR requirement in clause 6.6.3.2 shall apply in _Inter
RF Bandwidth gaps_ for the frequency ranges defined in table 6.6.3.2-4.
The requirement shall apply during the _transmitter ON period_.
#### 6.6.3.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement applies per _single-band connector_ , or per _multi-

### 6.6.5 Transmitter spurious emissions
#### 6.6.5.1 Definition and applicability
For IAB-DU, the transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from 9 kHz to
12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink _operating band_ , up to Δf~OBUE~ above
the highest frequency of each supported downlink _operating band_ , where the
Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1-1. For some _operating bands_ , the upper
limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic
limit of the downlink _operating band_ , as specified in Recommendation ITU-R
SM.329 [5].
For IAB-MT, the transmitter spurious emission limits shall apply from 9 kHz to
12.75 GHz, excluding the frequency range from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported uplink _operating band_ , up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of each supported uplink _operating band_ , where the
Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.6.1-2. For some _operating bands_ , the upper
limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the 5^th^ harmonic
limit of the uplink _operating band_ , as specified in Recommendation ITU-R
SM.329 [5].
For a _multi-band connector_ , for each supported _operating band_ together
with Δf~OBUE~ around the band is excluded from the transmitter spurious
emissions requirement.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.
Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power (RMS).
#### 6.6.5.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement applies per _single-band connector_ , or per _multi-
band connector_ supporting transmission in the _operating band_.
The minimum requirement for _IAB type 1-H_ are defined in TS 38.174 [2],
clause 6.6.5.
#### 6.6.5.3 Test purpose
This test measures conducted spurious emissions while the transmitter is in
operation.
#### 6.6.5.4 Method of test
##### 6.6.5.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier:
\- B when testing the spurious emissions below F~DL_low~ - Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-DU
or F~UL_low~ - Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-MT~,~
\- T when testing the spurious emissions above F~DL_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-
DU or F~UL_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-MT; see clause 4.9.1.
_IAB RF Bandwidth_ positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:
\- B~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies below F~DL_low~ - Δf~OBUE~

band; B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ when testing the spurious frequencies above F~DL_high~
+ Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-DU or F~UL_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ for IAB-MT of the highest
operating band in multi-band operation, see clause 4.9.1.
##### 6.6.5.4.2 Procedure
For _IAB type 1-H_ where there may be multiple _TAB connectors_ , they may be
tested one at a time or multiple _TAB connectors_ may be tested in parallel as
shown in annex D.13.1. Whichever method is used the procedure is repeated
until all _TAB connectors_ necessary to demonstrate conformance have been
tested.
1) Connect the _single-band connector_ or _multi-band connector_ under test to
measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1. All connectors not under test
shall be terminated.
2) Measurements shall use a measurement bandwidth in accordance to the
conditions in clause 6.6.5.5.
The measurement device characteristics shall be:
\- Detection mode: True RMS.
3) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation only
(D.16), set the representative connectors under test to transmit according to
the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at _rated carrier output
power_ (P~rated,c,AC~, or P~rated,c,TABC~, D.21). Channel set-up shall be
according to IAB-DU-FR1‑TM1.1 or IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1.
For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit on all carriers
configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power
setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2.
4) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth.
In addition, for _multi-band connectors_ , the following steps shall apply:
5) For a _multi-band connectors_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved _operating band_ where single band test configurations and test
models shall apply with no carrier activated in the other _operating band_.

##### 6.6.5.5.2 Additional spurious emissions requirements
These requirements may be applied for the protection of system operating in
other frequency ranges. The limits may apply as an optional protection of such
systems that are deployed in the same geographical area as the IAB-node, or
they may be set by local or regional regulation as a mandatory requirement for
an NR _operating band_. It is in some cases not stated in the present document
whether a requirement is mandatory or under what exact circumstances that a
limit applies, since this is set by local or regional regulation. An overview
of regional requirements in the present document is given in clause 4.5.
Some requirements may apply for the protection of specific equipment (UE, MS
and/or BS) or equipment operating in specific systems (GSM, CDMA, UTRA,
E-UTRA, NR, etc.) as listed below.
The spurious emission _basic limits_ are provided in table 6.6.5.5.2-1 where
requirements for co-existence with the system listed in the first column apply
for IAB-MT and IAB-DU. For a _multi-band connector_ , the exclusions and
conditions in the Note column of table 6.6.5.5.2-1 apply for each supported
_operating band_.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause the co-
existence requirements in table 6.6.5.2.2-1 do not apply for the Δf~OBUE~
frequency range immediately outside the downlink _operating band_ (see table
5.2-1). Emission limits for this excluded frequency range may be covered by
local or regional requirements.
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.2.2-1 assumes that two _operating bands_ , where the
frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be overlapping, are not deployed in the
same geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping
frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence
requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
##### 6.6.5.5.3 Co-location with base stations and IAB-nodes
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS, IAB-DU or
IAB-MT receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850, CDMA850, UTRA FDD,
UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU or IAB-MT are co-located with IAB-MT and/or
IAB-DU.
The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver
and are based on co-location with same class.
The _basic limits_ are in table 6.6.5.2.3-1 for an IAB-DU and IAB-MT.
Requirements for co-location with a system listed in the first column apply,
depending on the declared IAB-DU and IAB-MT class. For a _multi-band
connector_ , the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table
6.6.5.2.3-1 shall apply for each supported _operating band_.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in table 6.6.5.2.3-1 do not apply for the frequency
range extending Δf~OBUE~ immediately outside the transmit frequency range of a
IAB-MT and IAB-DU. The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a
single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent
frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum coupling loss. However, there
are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are
addressed in TR 25.942 [8].
NOTE 2: Table 6.6.5.2.3-1 assumes that two _operating bands_ , where the
corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges in table 5.2-1 would be
overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case
of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical
area, special co-location requirements may apply that are not covered by the
3GPP specifications.
#### 6.6.5.6 _IAB type 1-H_
The Tx spurious emissions requirements for _IAB type 1-H_ are that for each
_TAB connector TX min cell group_ and each applicable _basic limit_ in clause
6.6.5.2, the power summation of emissions at the _TAB connectors_ of the _TAB
connector TX min cell group_ shall not exceed a limit specified as the _basic
limit_ \+ X, where X = 10log~10~(N~TXU,countedpercell~), unless stated
differently in regional regulation.
NOTE: Conformance to the _IAB type 1-H_ spurious emission requirement can be
demonstrated by meeting at least one of the following criteria as determined
by the manufacturer:
1) The sum of the emissions power measured on each _TAB connector_ in the _TAB
connector TX min cell group_ shall be less than or equal to the limit as
defined in this clause for the respective frequency span.
Or
2) The unwanted emissions power at each _TAB connector_ shall be less than or
equal to the _type 1-H_ limit as defined in this clause for the respective
frequency span, scaled by -10log~10~(n), where n is the number of _TAB
connectors_ in the _TAB connector TX min cell group_.
## 6.7 Transmitter intermodulation
### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability
The transmitter intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of
the transmitter unit to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear
elements caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal
reaching the transmitter unit via the antenna, RDN and antenna array. The
requirement shall apply during the transmitter ON period and the _transmitter
transient period_.
For _IAB type 1-H_ , the transmitter intermodulation level is the power of the
intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into the _TAB
connector_.
For _IAB type 1-H_ , there are two types of transmitter intermodulation cases
captured by the transmitter intermodulation requirement:
1) Co-location transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering signal is
from a co-located base station.
2) Intra-system transmitter intermodulation in which the interfering signal is
from other transmitter units within the _IAB type 1-H_.
For _IAB type 1-H_ , the co-location transmitter intermodulation requirement
is considered sufficient if the interference signal for the co-location
requirement is higher than the declared interference signal for intra-system
transmitter (D.30) intermodulation requirement.
### 6.7.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement applies per _single-band connector_ , or per _multi-
band connector_ supporting transmission in the _operating band_.
The minimum requirement for _IAB type 1-H_ is defined in TS 38.174 [2], clause
6.7.2.
### 6.7.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the transmitter units associated
with the _single-band connectors_ or _multi-band connector_ under test to
restrict the generation of intermodulation products in its nonlinear elements
caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
transmitter via the antenna to below specified levels.
### 6.7.4 Method of test
#### 6.7.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.
_IAB RF Bandwidth_ positions to be tested for multi-carrier and/or CA:
\- M~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see clause 4.9.1.
\- B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see clause
4.9.1.
NOTE: When testing in M (or M~RFBW~), if the interferer is fully or partially
located outside the supported frequency range, then the test shall be done
instead in B (or B~RFBW~) and T (or T~RFBW~), and only with the interferer
located inside the supported frequency range.
#### 6.7.4.2 Procedure
For _IAB type 1-H_ where there may be multiple _TAB connectors_ , they may be
tested one at a time or multiple _TAB connectors_ may be tested in parallel as
shown in annex D.1.2. If IAB simultaneous transmission is declared to be
supported (see D.IAB-2 in table 4.6-1), connector(s) for IAB-MT and IAB-DU may
be tested one at a time or may be tested in parallel as shown in annex D.1.2.
Whichever method is used the procedure is repeated until all _TAB connectors_
necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested.
1) Connect the _single-band connector_ or _multi-band connector_ under test to
measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.2 for _IAB type 1-H_. All
connectors not under test shall be terminated.
2) The measurement device characteristics shall be:
\- Detection mode: True RMS.
3) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation only
(D.16), set the representative connectors under test to transmit according to
the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at _rated carrier output
power_ P~rated,c,TABC~ for _IAB type 1-H_ (D.21). Channel set-up shall be
according to IAB-DU-FR1-TM 1.1 for IAB-DU and IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1 for IAB-MT.
For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier and/or CA
operation (D.15-D.16) set the connector under test to transmit on all carriers
configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding power
setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models
or set of physical channels in clause 4.9.2 for IAB-DU and IAB-MT.
4) For IAB 1-H, generate the interfering signal according to IAB-DU-FR1-TM1.1
for IAB-DU and IAB-MT-FR1-TM1.1 for IAB-MT, as defined in clause 4.9.2, with
the minimum channel bandwidth (BW~Channel~) with 15 kHz SCS of the band
defined in clause 5.3.5 and a centre frequency offset from the lower/upper
edge of the wanted signal or edge of sub-block inside a sub-block gap , for n
= 1, 2 and 3, but exclude interfering frequencies that are outside of the
allocated downlink operating band or interfering frequencies that are not
completely within the sub-block gap or within the _Inter RF Bandwidth gap_.
5) Adjust ATT attenuator (as in the test setup in annex D.1.2 for _IAB type
1-H_) so that level of the interfering signal is as defined in clause 6.7.5.
6) Perform the unwanted emission tests specified in clauses 6.6.3 and 6.6.4
for all third and fifth order intermodulation products which appear in the
frequency ranges defined in clauses 6.6.3 and 6.6.4. The width of the

The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to _IAB
type 1-H_ _TAB connector_ using the parameters in table 7.5.5.1-1. The

7.2.2 for each channel bandwidth and further specified in annex A.1.
For _IAB type 1-H_ the out-of-band blocking requirement apply from 1 MHz to
F~UL_low~ - Δf~OOB~ and from F~UL_high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750 MHz. The Δf~OOB~
for _IAB type 1-H_ is defined in table 7.4.2.5.1-0.
Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the _TAB connector_ for _IAB type
1-H._
For a IAB capable of multi-band operation, the requirement in the out-of-band
blocking frequency ranges apply for each _operating band_ , with the exception
that the in-band blocking frequency ranges of all supported _operating bands_
according to clause 7.4.2.5 shall be excluded from the out-of-band blocking
requirement.

IAB receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA BS or NR IAB operating in a
different frequency band are co-located with a NR IAB. The requirement is
applicable to all channel bandwidths supported by the NR IAB.
The requirements in this clause assume a 30 dB coupling loss between
interfering transmitter and NR IAB receiver and are based on co-location with
base stations or IAB of the same class.
The throughput shall be ≥ 95% of the maximum throughput of the reference
measurement channel, with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to IAB
antenna input using the parameters in table 7.5.5.2-1 for all the IAB classes.
The reference measurement channel for the wanted signal is identified in
tables 7.2.5-1, 7.2.5-2 and 7.2.5-3 for each channel bandwidth and further
specified in annex A.1.
For _IAB type 1-H_ blocking requirement for co-location with IAB in other
bands is applied for all operating bands for which co-location protection is
provided.
Minimum conducted requirement is defined at the _TAB connector_ for _IAB type
1-H._

#### 8.1.2.3 Performance requirements for UCI multiplexed on PUSCH
##### 8.1.2.3.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH is determined by two
parameters: block error probability (BLER) of CSI part 1 and block error
probability of CSI part 2. The performance is measured by the required SNR at
block error probability of CSI part 1 not exceeding 0.1 %, and the required
SNR at block error probability of CSI part 2 not exceeding 1 %.
The CSI part 1 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding the
CSI part 1 information when the CSI part 1 information is sent.
The CSI part 2 BLER is defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding the
CSI part 2 information when the CSI part 2 information is sent.
In the test of UCI multiplexed on PUSCH, the UCI information only contains CSI
part 1 and CSI part 2 information, there is no HACK/ACK information
transmitted.
The number of UCI information bit payload per slot is defined for two cases as
follows:
\- 7 bits: 5 bits in CSI part 1, 2 bits in CSI part 2,
\- 40 bits: 20 bits in CSI part 1, 20 bits in CSI part 2.
The 7 bits UCI information case is further defined with the bitmap [c0 c1 c2
c3 c4] = [0 1 0 1 0] for CSI part 1 information, where c0 is mapping to the RI
information, and with the bitmap [c0 c1] = [1 0] for CSI part 2 information.
The 40 bits UCI information case is assumed random information bit selection.
In both tests, PUSCH data, CSI part 1 and CSI part 2 are transmitted
simultaneously.
Which specific test(s) is applicable to IAB-DU is based on the test
applicability rule defined in clause 8.1.1.2.2.
##### 8.1.2.3.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirements are in TS 38.174 [2] clause 8.1.2.3.
##### 8.1.2.3.3 Test purpose

### 8.1.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH
#### 8.1.3.1 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0
##### 8.1.3.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of single user PUCCH format 0 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection
of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The
probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.
The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.
The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 [23] clause 6.3.3.1 is not
taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping
is symmetric to the CC centre, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

##### 8.1.3.2.1 NACK to ACK detection
##### 8.1.3.2.1.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-
applicability-27 .H6}
The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection is
determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK
and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection equal to 0.1% or
less. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular bit position when
input is only noise. Each false bit detection is counted as one error.
The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an ACK
bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK bit
erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously detected
NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are mapped from
DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be considered.
The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-1 [23] clause 6.3.3.1 is not
taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping

##### 8.1.3.6.1.1.1 Definition and applicability {#definition-and-

The performance requirement of multi-slot PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection
of the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection equal
to 0.1 % or less. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01
% or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular bit position when
input is only noise. Each false bit detection is counted as one error.
The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an ACK
bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK bit
erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously detected
NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are mapped from
DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be considered.

determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK
and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of
false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.
The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.

1) Connect the IAB-DU tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all IAB-DU _TAB connectors_ for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in annex D. 3.
2) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the combinations of SCS and channel
bandwidth defined in table 8.1.3.6.1.2.4.2-1.

5) Adjusting the equipment so that the SNR specified in table 8.1.3.6.1.2.5-1
is achieved at the IAB-DU input during the transmissions.
6) The tester sends random codewords from applicable codebook, in regular time
periods. The following statistics are kept: the number of ACK bits falsely
detected in the idle periods and the number of missed ACK bits. Each falsely
detected ACK bit in the idle periods is accounted as one error for the
statistics of false ACK detection, and each missed ACK bit is accounted as one
error for the statistics of missed ACK detection.
Note that the procedure described in this clause for ACK missed detection has
the same condition as that described in clause 8.1.3.6.1.1.4.2 for NACK to ACK
detection. Both statistics are measured in the same testing.
##### 8.1.3.6.1.2.5 Test requirement {#test-requirement-14 .H6}

### 8.1.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
#### 8.1.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection requirements
##### 8.1.4.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is determined by
the two parameters: total probability of false detection of the preamble (Pfa)
and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd). The performance is measured
by the required SNR at probability of detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1%
or less.
Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of
the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only
noise.
Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble when the
signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several error cases --
detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that was sent, not detecting
any preamble at all, or detecting the correct preamble but with the out-of-
bounds timing estimation value.
For AWGN and TDLC300-100, a timing estimation error occurs if the estimation
error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than the time error
tolerance values given in table 8.1.4.1.1-1.

the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A and the
test parameter _msg1-FrequencyStart_ is set to 0.
4) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex F.
5) Adjust the frequency offset of the test signal according to table
8.1.4.1.5-1 or 8.1.4.1.5-2 or 8.1.4.1.5-3 or 8.1.4.1.6-1 or 8.1.4.1.6-2 or

7) The test signal generator sends a preamble and the receiver tries to detect
the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure 8.1.4.1.4.2-1.
The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets as described below. The
following statistics are kept: the number of preambles detected in the idle
period and the number of missed preambles.

The timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format 0 is set to 50% of Ncs.
This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of
0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.9us. Then the loop is
being reset and the timing offset is set again to 50% of Ncs. The timing
offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 is presented in figure

## 8.2 IAB-MT Performance requirements
### 8.2.1 General
#### 8.2.1.1 Scope and definitions
Conducted performance requirements specify the ability of the IAB-MT to
correctly demodulate signals in various conditions and configurations.
Conducted performance requirements are specified at the TAB connector(s).
Conducted performance requirements for the IAB-MT are specified for the fixed
reference channels and the propagation conditions defined in TS 38.174 [2]
annex A and annex F, respectively. The requirements only apply to those FRCs
that are supported by the IAB-MT.
Unless stated otherwise, performance requirements apply for a single carrier
only. Performance requirements for an IAB-MT supporting CA are defined in
terms of single carrier requirements.
The SNR used in this clause is specified based on a single carrier and defined
as:
SNR = S / N
Where:
S is the total signal energy in a slot on a single _TAB connector_.
N is the noise energy in a bandwidth corresponding to the transmission
bandwidth over the duration of a slot.

#### 8.2.3.3 Reporting of Precoding Matrix Indicator (PMI)
##### 8.2.3.3.1 Definition and applicability
The minimum performance requirements of PMI reporting are defined based on the
precoding gain, expressed as the relative increase in throughput when the
transmitter is configured according to the IAB-MT reported PMI compared to the
case when the transmitter is using random precoding, respectively. When the
transmitter uses random precoding, for each PDSCH allocation a precoder is
randomly generated with equal probability of each applicable i~1~ and i~2~
combination and applied to the PDSCH. A fixed transport format (FRC) is
configured for all requirements.
The requirements for transmission mode 1 with higher layer parameter
_codebookType_ set to \'typeI-SinglePanel\' are specified in terms of the
ratio:
In the definition of _γ_ , for 4TX and 8TX PMI requirements, is 90 % of the
maximum throughput obtained at using the precoders configured according to the

by:
{width="0.5083333333333333in" height="0.45in"}.

For 8 port transmission the channel matrix is defined in the frequency domain
by:
{width="1.6in" height="0.45in"}
# F.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
## F.2.1 General
The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:
\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized by a
number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile can be
further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum delay spanned
by the taps.
\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay profile
and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical spectrum shape
and a maximum Doppler frequency.
\- Different models are used for FR1 (410 MHz - 7.125 GHz) and FR2 (24.25 GHz
-- 52.6 GHz).
## F.2.2 Delay profiles
### F.2.2.1 General
The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.901 [25] TDL models. The
simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps are only
used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay profiles
specified in F.2.2.1 can be used as such.
\- Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.901 [25].
\- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays.
\- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.3 in TR 38.901 [25].
\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is done
simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the delay
resolution.
\- Step 5: If multiple taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge them by
calculating their linear power sum.
\- Step 6: If there are more than 12 taps in the quantized model, merge the
taps as follows:
\- Find the weakest tap from all taps (both merged and unmerged taps are
considered):
\- If there are two or more taps having the same value and are the weakest,
select the tap with the smallest delay as the weakest tap.
\- When the weakest tap is the first delay tap, merge taps as follows:
\- Update the power of the first delay tap as the linear power sum of the
weakest tap and the second delay tap.
\- Remove the second delay tap.
\- When the weakest tap is the last delay tap, merge taps as follows:
\- Update the power of the last delay tap as the linear power sum of the
second-to-last tap and the last tap.
\- Remove the second-to-last tap.
\- Otherwise:
\- For each side of the weakest tap, identify the neighbour tap that has the
smaller delay difference to the weakest tap.
\- When the delay difference between the weakest tap and the identified
neighbour tap on one side equals the delay difference between the weakest tap
and the identified neighbour tap on the other side.
\- Select the neighbour tap that is weaker in power for merging.
\- Otherwise, select the neighbour tap that has smaller delay difference for
merging.- To merge, the power of the merged tap is the linear sum of the power
of the weakest tap and the selected tap:
\- When the selected tap is the first tap, the location of the merged tap is
the location of the first tap. The weakest tap is removed.
\- When the selected tap is the last tap, the location of the merged tap is
the location of the last tap. The weakest tap is removed.
\- Otherwise, the location of the merged tap is based on the average delay of
the weakest tap and selected tap. If the average delay is on the sampling
grid, the location of the merged tap is the average delay. Otherwise, the
location of the merged tap is rounded towards the direction of the selected
tap (e.g. 10 ns & 20 ns 15 ns, 10 ns & 25 ns 20 ns, if 25 ns had higher or
equal power; 15 ns, if 10 ns had higher power). The weakest tap and the
selected tap are removed.
\- Repeat step 6 until the final number of taps is 12.
\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB -8.8 dB)
\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap merge,
adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the power of the
last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.
\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest tap to 0 dB.
Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification steps
may differ from the values in tables F.2.2.2-2, F.2.2.2-3, and F.2.1.1-4 for
the corresponding model.
Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the linear
domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the linear domain.
### F.2.2.2 Delay profiles for FR1
The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of low, medium

The correlation matrices for high, medium and low correlation are defined in
table F.2.4.2.3-2, F.2.4.2.3-3 and F.2.4.2.3-4 as below.
The values in table F.2.4.2.3-2 have been adjusted for the 2x4 and 4x4 high
correlation cases to ensure the correlation matrix is positive semi-definite
after round-off to 4 digit precision. This is done using the equation:

Where the value \"a\" is a scaling factor such that the smallest value is used
to obtain a positive semi-definite result. For the 2x4 high correlation case,
a = 0.00010. For the 4x4 high correlation case, a = 0.00012.
The same method is used to adjust the 4x4 medium correlation matrix in table

used at IAB
\- Multiple TX antennas and multiple RX antennas case, with cross polarized
antennas used at both UE and IAB
The cross-polarized antenna elements with +/-45 degrees polarization slant
angles are deployed at IAB. For one TX antenna case, antenna element with +90
degree polarization slant angle is deployed at UE. For multiple TX antennas
case, cross-polarized antenna elements with +90/0 degrees polarization slant
angles are deployed at UE.
For the cross-polarized antennas, the N antennas are labelled such that
antennas for one polarization are listed from 1 to N/2 and antennas for the
other polarization are listed from N/2+1 to N, where N is the number of TX or
RX antennas.

###### ## Annex G (normative): In-channel TX tests for IAB-DU
The Annex H in TS 38.141-1 [13] applies to FR1 IAB-DU.
###### ## Annex H (normative): In-channel TX tests for IAB-MT
# H.0 Applicability
FR1 IAB-MT EVM can be determined by the process according to following
alternatives:
Alternative 1: Annex E in TS 38.521-1 [16]. Only CP-OFDM waveform of PUSCH is
measured for IAB-MT or
Alternative 2: from Annex H.1 to Annex H.7.
# H.1 General
The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant parameters that
describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of the TX under test in a
single measurement process.
The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter, however,
are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for description inside
this annex places particular emphasis on the exclusion of all
interdependencies among the parameters.
# H.2 Basic principles
The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of the TX
under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal signal, that is
generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal error free
received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent (generally complex)
baseband signals.
The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only. These
numbers are taken from a TDD frame structure with normal CP length, 30 kHz SCS
and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 100 MHz (_N_ ~RB~ = 273). The
application of the text below, however, is not restricted to this parameter
set.
## H.2.1 Output signal of the TX under test
The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring equipment
and stored for further processing. It is sampled at a sampling rate which is
the product of the SCS and the _FFT size_ , and it is named $z\left( \upsilon
\right)$. The _FFT size_ is determined by the transmission bandwidth in table
6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4
for 60 kHz SCS. In the time domain, it comprises at least 10 ms. It is
modelled as a signal with the following parameters:
\- demodulated data content,
\- carrier frequency,
\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.
For the example in the annex, the _FFT size_ is 4096 based on table 6.5.3.5-3.
The sampling rate of 122.88 Msps is the product of the _FFT size_ and SCS.
## H.2.2 Ideal signal
Two types of ideal signals are defined:
The first ideal signal $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by the
measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters:
\- demodulated data content,
\- nominal carrier frequency,
\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.
It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate determined
from annex H.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the signal is described
in the test models.
The second ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by the
measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters:
\- nominal demodulation reference signals (all other modulation symbols are
set to 0 V),
\- nominal carrier frequency,
\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,
\- nominal timing.
It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate determined
from annex H.2.1 in the time domain.
## H.2.3 Measurement results
The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the following:
\- Carrier frequency error
\- EVM
\- Resource element TX power
\- OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP)
Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX chain
after equalisation.
## H.2.4 Measurement points
The resource element TX power is measured after the FFT box as described in
figure H.2.4-1. The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a
zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted for FR1 in figure
H.2.4-1. The FFT window of _FFT size_ samples out of (_FFT size_ \+ cyclic
prefix length) samples in the time domain is selected in the \"Remove CP\"
box. The _FFT size_ and the cyclic prefix length are obtained from table
6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4
for 60 kHz SCS.
In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic prefix
larger than the values listed in tables 6.5.3.5-2, 6.5.3.5-3 and 6.5.3.5-4.
Table H.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the symbol number and the formula how
to compute the length of cyclic prefix for those two symbols according to the
sampling rate.
Table H.2.4-1: Slot number and symbol number identifying the longer CP length
for normal CP
* * *
SCS (kHz) # slots in subframe Symbol # and slot # with longer CP Longer CP
length
* * *
15 1 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 128 (symbol 7, slot 0)
30 2 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 64 (symbol 0, slot 1)
60 4 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 32 (symbol 0, slot 2)
* * *
For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096 samples
out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 has 64 more samples in the cyclic prefix than
the other 13 symbols in the slot (the longer CP length = 352).
Figure H.2.4-1: Reference point for FR1 EVM measurements
# H.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
Sample Timing, Carrier Frequency in $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are varied in
order to minimise the difference between $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$, after the amplitude ratio of $z\left( \upsilon
\right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ has been scaled. Best fit (minimum
difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value between $z\left(
\upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is an absolute minimum.
The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier frequency
error.
From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency error can be
derived.
Note 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be supported by
post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process defined in the pre-FFT
domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it does not exclude the samples
in-between the FFT widths and it does not exclude the bandwidth outside the
transmission bandwidth configuration).
Note 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and sample
frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there are no
requirements for sample frequency error. Hence the algorithm models the RF and
the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It returns one error and
does not distinguish between both.
After this process, the samples $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are called
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$.
# H.4 Timing of the FFT window
The FFT window length is _FFT size_ samples per OFDM symbol.
The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.
In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic prefix
without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the window. The EVM
requirements shall be met within a window _W_ \ and
$$\varphi\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\varphi\left( t_{i},f
\right)}}{N}$$

3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase $\widehat{a}\left( f
\right)$ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ at the demodulation reference
signal subcarriers are obtained by computing the moving average in the
frequency domain of the time-averaged demodulation reference signal
subcarriers. The moving average window size is 19 and averaging is over the
DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or near the
edge of the channel, or when the number of available DM-RS subcarriers within
a set of contiguously allocated RBs is smaller than the moving average window
size, the window size is reduced accordingly as per figure H.6-1.
4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
$\widehat{a}\left( f \right)$ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ to
compute coefficients$\widetilde{\text{\ a}}\left( f \right)$,
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ for each subcarrier.

# H.7 EVM
## H.7.0 General
For EVM create two sets of $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$, according to
the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and $\left(
\mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$, using the equalizer coefficients from H.6.
The equivalent ideal samples are calculated from $i_{1}\left( \upsilon
\right)$ (annex H.2.2) and are called $I\left( t,f \right)$.
The EVM is the difference between the ideal signal and the equalized measured
signal.
$$EVM = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i
\right)}^{}\left| Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right) - I\left( t,f \right)
\right|^{2}}}{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left|
I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}}$$
Where:
> \- T is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being
> active within the slot,
>
> \- $F\left( t \right)$ is the set of subcarriers within the resource blocks
> with the considered modulation scheme being active in symbol _t_ ,
>
> \- $I\left( t,f \right)$ _is_ the ideal signal reconstructed by the
> measurement equipment in accordance with relevant test models,
>
> \- $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$ is the equalized signal under test.
NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer is
calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the impact of
noise in the reference signals.
## H.7.1 Averaged EVM (TDD)
EVM is averaged over all allocated uplink resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of $N_{\text{ul}}$
slots where $N_{\text{ul}}$ is the number of slots in a 10 ms measurement
interval.
For TDD, let $N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}$ be the number of slots with uplink
symbols within a 10 ms measurement interval, the averaging in the time domain
can be calculated from $N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}$ slots of different 10 ms
measurement intervals and should have a minimum of $N_{\text{ul}}\ $slots
averaging length where $N_{\text{ul}}\ $is the number of slots in a 10 ms
measurement interval.
_-_ ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ is derived by: Square the EVM
results in each 10 ms measurement interval. Sum the squares, divide the sum by
the number of EVM relevant locations, square-root the quotient (RMS).
$${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i =
1}^{N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i =
1}^{N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}}{\sum_{j = 1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$$
_\- Where_ $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot _i_.
_-_ The $\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}}$ is calculated, using the maximum of
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ at the window _W_ extremities. Thus
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using $\widetilde{t}
= \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ and
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using $\widetilde{t}
= \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ (_l_ and _h_ , low and high; where low
is the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and and high is the
timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).
$$\text{EVM}_{\text{frame}} = \max\left(
{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}
\right)$$
_-_ In order to unite at least $N_{\text{ul}}$ slots, consider the minimum
integer number of 10 ms measurement intervals, where $N_{\text{frame}}$ is
determined by.
$$N_{\text{frame}} = \left\lceil \frac{10 \times
N_{\text{slot}}}{N_{\text{ul}}^{\text{TDD}}} \right\rceil$$
and $N_{\text{slot}} = 1$ for 15 kHz SCS, $N_{\text{slot}} = 2$ for 30 kHz SCS
and $N_{\text{slot}} = 4$ for 60 kHz SCS normal CP.
_-_ Unite by RMS.
$$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N_{\text{frame}}}\sum_{k =
1}^{N_{\text{frame}}}\text{EVM}_{\text{frame},k}^{2}}$$
