# 4 Overall Architecture and Functional Split
## 4.1 Overall Architecture
An NG-RAN node is either:
\- a gNB, providing NR user plane and control plane protocol terminations
towards the UE; or
\- an ng-eNB, providing E-UTRA user plane and control plane protocol
terminations towards the UE.
The gNBs and ng-eNBs are interconnected with each other by means of the Xn
interface. The gNBs and ng-eNBs are also connected by means of the NG
interfaces to the 5GC, more specifically to the AMF (Access and Mobility
Management Function) by means of the NG-C interface and to the UPF (User Plane
Function) by means of the NG-U interface (see TS 23.501 [3]).
NOTE: The architecture and the F1 interface for a functional split are defined
in TS 38.401 [4].
The NG-RAN architecture is illustrated in Figure 4.1-1 below.

NG-U provides non-guaranteed delivery of user plane PDUs between the NG-RAN
node and the UPF.
Further details of NG-U can be found in TS 38.410 [16].
#### 4.3.1.2 NG Control Plane
The NG control plane interface (NG-C) is defined between the NG-RAN node and
the AMF. The control plane protocol stack of the NG interface is shown on
Figure 4.3.1.2-1. The transport network layer is built on IP transport. For
the reliable transport of signalling messages, SCTP is added on top of IP. The
application layer signalling protocol is referred to as NGAP (NG Application
Protocol). The SCTP layer provides guaranteed delivery of application layer
messages. In the transport, IP layer point-to-point transmission is used to
deliver the signalling PDUs.

NG-C provides the following functions:
\- NG interface management;
\- UE context management;
\- UE mobility management;
\- Transport of NAS messages;
\- Paging;
\- PDU Session Management;
\- Configuration Transfer;
\- Warning Message Transmission.
Further details of NG-C can be found in TS 38.410 [16].
### 4.3.2 Xn Interface
#### 4.3.2.1 Xn User Plane
The Xn User plane (Xn-U) interface is defined between two NG-RAN nodes. The
user plane protocol stack on the Xn interface is shown in Figure 4.3.2.1-1.
The transport network layer is built on IP transport and GTP-U is used on top
of UDP/IP to carry the user plane PDUs.
Figure 4.3.2.1-1: Xn-U Protocol Stack
Xn-U provides non-guaranteed delivery of user plane PDUs and supports the
following functions:
\- Data forwarding;
\- Flow control.
Further details of Xn-U can be found in TS 38.420 [17].
#### 4.3.2.2 Xn Control Plane
The Xn control plane interface (Xn-C) is defined between two NG-RAN nodes. The
control plane protocol stack of the Xn interface is shown on Figure 4.3.2.2-1.
The transport network layer is built on SCTP on top of IP. The application
layer signalling protocol is referred to as XnAP (Xn Application Protocol).
The SCTP layer provides the guaranteed delivery of application layer messages.
In the transport IP layer point-to-point transmission is used to deliver the
signalling PDUs.

\- UE mobility management, including context transfer and RAN paging;
\- Dual connectivity.
Further details of Xn-C can be found in TS 38.420 [17].
## 4.4 Radio Protocol Architecture
### 4.4.1 User Plane
The figure below shows the protocol stack for the user plane, where SDAP,
PDCP, RLC and MAC sublayers (terminated in gNB on the network side) perform
the functions listed in clause 6.

in clause 7;
\- NAS control protocol (terminated in AMF on the network side) performs the
functions listed in TS 23.501 [3]), for instance: authentication, mobility
management, security control...
Figure 4.4.2-1: Control Plane Protocol Stack
## 4.5 Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity
NG-RAN supports Multi-Radio Dual Connectivity (MR-DC) operation whereby a UE
in RRC_CONNECTED is configured to utilise radio resources provided by two
distinct schedulers, located in two different NG-RAN nodes connected via a
non-ideal backhaul, one providing NR access and the other one providing either
E-UTRA or NR access. Further details of MR-DC operation, including Conditional
PSCell Addition (CPA) and Conditional PSCell Change (CPC), can be found in TS
37.340 [21].
## 4.6 Radio Access Network Sharing
NG-RAN supports radio access network sharing as defined in TS 23.501 [3].
If NR access is shared, system information broadcast in a shared cell
indicates a TAC and a Cell Identity for each subset of PLMNs, PNI-NPNs and
SNPNs. NR access provides only one TAC and one Cell Identity per cell per
PLMN, SNPN or PNI-NPN. In this version of the specification, a Cell Identity
can only belong to one network type among PLMN, PNI-NPN or SNPN as defined in
TS 23.501 [3].
Each Cell Identity associated with a subset of PLMNs, SNPNs or PNI-NPNs
identifies its serving NG-RAN node.
## 4.7 Integrated Access and Backhaul
### 4.7.1 Architecture
Integrated access and backhaul (IAB) enables wireless relaying in NG-RAN. The
relaying node, referred to as _IAB-node_ , supports access and backhauling via
NR. The terminating node of NR backhauling on network side is referred to as
the _IAB-donor_ , which represents a gNB with additional functionality to
support IAB. Backhauling can occur via a single or via multiple hops. The IAB
architecture is shown in Figure 4.7.1-1.
The IAB-node supports the gNB-DU functionality, as defined in TS 38.401 [4],
to terminate the NR access interface to UEs and next-hop IAB-nodes, and to
terminate the F1 protocol to the gNB-CU functionality, as defined in TS 38.401
[4], on the IAB-donor. The gNB-DU functionality on the IAB-node is also
referred to as _IAB-DU_.
In addition to the gNB-DU functionality, the IAB-node also supports a subset
of the UE functionality referred to as _IAB-MT_ , which includes, e.g.,
physical layer, layer-2, RRC and NAS functionality to connect to the gNB-DU of
another IAB-node or the IAB-donor, to connect to the gNB-CU on the IAB-donor,
and to the core network.
The IAB-node can access the network using either SA mode or EN-DC. In EN-DC,
the IAB-node connects via E-UTRA to a MeNB, and the IAB-donor terminates X2-C
as SgNB (TS 37.340 [21]).
Figure 4.7.1-1: IAB architecture; a) IAB-node using SA mode with NGC; b) IAB-
node using EN-DC
All IAB-nodes that are connected to an IAB-donor via one or multiple backhaul
hops and controlled by this IAB-donor via F1AP and/or RRC form an IAB topology
with the IAB-donor as its root (Fig. 4.7.1-2). In this IAB topology, the
neighbour node of the IAB-DU or the IAB-donor-DU is referred to as the _child_
node and the neighbour node of the IAB-MT is referred to as the _parent_ node.
The direction toward the child node is referred to as _downstream_ while the
direction toward the parent node is referred to as _upstream_. The IAB-donor
performs centralized resource, topology and route management for its IAB
topology.
Figure 4.7.1-2: Parent- and child-node relationship for IAB-node
### 4.7.2 Protocol Stacks
Fig. 4.7.2-1 shows the protocol stack for F1-U and Fig. 4.7.2-2 shows the
protocol stack for F1-C between IAB-DU and IAB-donor-CU. In these figures,
F1-U and F1-C are carried over two backhaul hops.
F1-U and F1-C use an IP transport layer between IAB-DU and IAB-donor-CU as
defined in TS 38.470 [32]. F1-U and F1-C need to be security-protected as
described in TS 33.501 [5] (the security layer is not shown in the Figures
4.7.2-1/2).
On the wireless backhaul, the IP layer is carried over the Backhaul Adaptation
Protocol (BAP) sublayer, which enables routing over multiple hops. The IP
layer can also be used for _non_ -F1 traffic, such as OAM traffic as defined
in TS 38.401 [4].
On each backhaul link, the BAP PDUs are carried by BH RLC channels. Multiple
BH RLC channels can be configured on each BH link to allow traffic
prioritization and QoS enforcement. The BH-RLC-channel mapping for BAP PDUs is
performed by the BAP entities on each IAB-node and the IAB-donor-DU.
Protocol stacks for an IAB-donor with split gNB architecture are specified in
TS 38.401 [4].
Fig. 4.7.2-1: Protocol stack for the support of F1-U protocol
Fig. 4.7.2-2: Protocol stack for the support of F1-C protocol
The IAB-MT further establishes SRBs (carrying RRC and NAS) with the IAB-donor-
CU. For IAB-nodes operating in EN-DC, the IAB-MT establishes one or more DRBs
with the eNB and one or more DRBs with the IAB-donor-CU, which can be used,
e.g., to carry OAM traffic. For SA mode, the establishment of DRBs is
optional. These SRBs and DRBs are transported between the IAB-MT and its
parent node over Uu access channel(s). The protocol stacks for the SRB is
shown in Fig. 4.7.2-3.
Figure 4.7.2-3: Protocol stack for the support of IAB-MT\'s RRC and NAS
connections
### 4.7.3 User-plane Aspects
#### 4.7.3.1 Backhaul transport
The IAB-DU\'s IP traffic is routed over the wireless backhaul via the BAP
sublayer. The BAP sublayer is specified in TS 38.340 [31]. In downstream
direction, upper layer packets are encapsulated by the BAP sublayer at the
IAB-donor-DU and de-encapsulated at the destination IAB-node. In upstream
direction, upper layer packets are encapsulated at the IAB-node and de-
encapsulated at the IAB-donor-DU. IAB-specific transport between IAB-donor-CU
and IAB-donor-DU is specified in TS 38.401 [4].
On the BAP sublayer, packets are routed based on the BAP routing ID, which is
carried in the BAP header. The BAP header is added to the packet when it
arrives from upper layers, and the BAP header is stripped off when the packet
has reached its destination node. The selection of the packet\'s BAP routing
ID is configured by the IAB-donor-CU. The BAP routing ID consists of BAP
address and BAP path ID, where the BAP address indicates the destination node
of the packet on the BAP sublayer, and the BAP path ID indicates the routing
path the packet should follow to this destination. For the purpose of routing,
each IAB-node and IAB-donor-DU is further configured with a designated BAP
address.
On each hop of the packet\'s path, the IAB-node inspects the packet\'s BAP
address in the BAP routing ID carried in the BAP header to determine if the
packet has reached its destination, i.e., matches the IAB-node\'s BAP address.
In case the packet has _not_ reached the destination, the IAB-node determines
the next hop backhaul link, referred to as _egress_ link, based on the BAP
routing ID carried in the BAP header and a routing configuration it received
from the IAB-donor-CU.
For each packet, the IAB-node further determines the egress BH RLC channel on
the designated egress link. For packets arriving from upper layers, the
designated egress BH RLC channel is configured by the IAB-donor-CU, and it is
based on upper layer traffic specifiers. Since each BH RLC channel is
configured with QoS information or priority level, BH-RLC-channel selection
facilitates traffic-specific prioritization and QoS enforcement on the BH. For
F1-U traffic, it is possible to map each GTP-U tunnel to a dedicated BH RLC
channel or to aggregate multiple GTP-U tunnels into one common BH RLC channel.
For traffic other than F1-U traffic, it is possible to map UE-associated F1AP
messages, non-UE-associated F1AP messages and non-F1 traffic onto the same or
separate BH RLC channels.
When packets are routed from one BH link to another, the egress BH RLC channel
on the egress BH link is determined based on the mapping configuration between
ingress BH RLC channels and egress BH RLC channels provided by the IAB-donor-
CU.
#### 4.7.3.2 Flow and Congestion Control
Flow and congestion control can be supported in both upstream and downstream
directions in order to avoid congestion-related packet drops on IAB-nodes and
IAB-donor-DU:
\- In upstream direction, UL scheduling on MAC layer can support flow control
on each hop;
\- In downstream direction, the NR user plane protocol (TS 38.425 [33])
supports flow and congestion control between the IAB-node and the IAB-donor-CU
for UE bearers that terminate at this IAB-node. Further, flow control is
supported on BAP sublayer, where the IAB-node can send feedback information on
the available buffer size for an ingress BH RLC channel or BAP routing ID to
its parent node. The feedback can be sent proactively, e.g., when the buffer
load exceeds a certain threshold, or based on polling by the parent node.
#### 4.7.3.3 Uplink Scheduling Latency
The IAB-node can reduce UL scheduling latency through signalling of a Pre-
emptive BSR to its parent node. The IAB-node can send the Pre-emptive BSR
based on UL grants it has provided to child nodes and/or UEs, or based on BSRs
it has received from child nodes or UEs (Figure 4.7.3.3-1). The Pre-emptive
BSR conveys the data expected rather than the data buffered.
Figure 4.7.3.3-1: Scheduling of BSR in IAB:
> a) regular BSR based on buffered data,\ b) Pre-emptive BSR based on UL
> grant,\ c) Pre-emptive BSR based on reception of regular BSR
### 4.7.4 Signalling procedures
#### 4.7.4.1 IAB-node Integration
The IAB-node integration procedure is captured in TS 38.401 [4].
#### 4.7.4.2 IAB-node Migration
The IAB-node can migrate to a different parent node underneath the same IAB-
donor-CU. The IAB-node continues providing access and backhaul service when
migrating to a different parent node.
The IAB-MT can also migrate to a different parent node underneath another IAB-
donor-CU. In this case, the collocated IAB-DU and the IAB-DU(s) of its
descendant node(s) retain F1 connectivity with the initial IAB-donor-CU. The
IAB-MT of each descendant node and all the served UEs retain the RRC
connectivity with the initial IAB-donor-CU. This migration is referred to as
_inter-donor partial migration_. The IAB-node, whose IAB-MT migrates to the
new IAB-donor-CU, is referred to as a _boundary IAB-node_. After inter-donor
partial migration, the F1 traffic of the IAB-DU and its descendant nodes is
routed via the BAP layer of the IAB topology to which the IAB-MT has migrated.
Inter-donor partial migration is only supported for SA-mode.
The intra-donor IAB-node migration procedure and inter-donor partial migration
procedures are captured in TS 38.401 [4].
#### 4.7.4.3 Topological Redundancy
The IAB-node may have redundant routes to the IAB-donor-CU(s).
For IAB-nodes operating in SA-mode, NR DC can be used to enable route
redundancy in the BH by allowing the IAB-MT to have concurrent BH links with
two parent nodes. The parent nodes may be connected to the same or to
different IAB-donor-CUs, which control the establishment and release of
redundant routes via these two parent nodes. Either parent node\'s gNB-DU
functionality together with the respective IAB-donor-CU assumes the role of
the IAB-MT\'s master node or secondary node. The NR DC framework (e.g.,
MCG/SCG-related procedures) is used to configure the dual radio links with the
parent nodes (TS 37.340 [21]).
The procedure for establishment of topological redundancy for IAB-nodes
operating in SA-mode is captured in TS 38.401 [4].
An IAB-node operating in NR-DC may also use one of its links for BH
connectivity with an IAB-donor and the other link for access-only connectivity
with a separate gNB that does not assume IAB-donor role. The IAB-donor can
assume the MN or the SN role. The IAB-node may exchange F1-C traffic with the
IAB-donor via the backhaul link and/or via the access link with the gNB. In
the latter case, the F1-C messages are carried over NR RRC between the IAB-
node and the gNB, and via XnAP between the gNB and the IAB-donor.
IAB-nodes operating in EN-DC can exchange F1-C traffic with the IAB-donor via
the MeNB. The F1-C message is carried over LTE RRC using SRB2 between IAB-node
and MeNB and via X2AP between the MeNB and the IAB-donor.
The procedures for establishment of redundant transport of F1-C for IAB-nodes
using NR-DC and EN-DC are captured in TS 37.340 [21] and TS 38.401 [4].
#### 4.7.4.4 Backhaul RLF Recovery
When the IAB-node using SA-mode declares RLF on the backhaul link, it can
perform RLF recovery at another parent node underneath the same or underneath
a different IAB-donor-CU. In the latter case, the collocated IAB-DU and the
IAB-DU(s) of its descendant node(s) may retain the F1 connectivity with the
initial IAB-donor-CU, while the IAB-MT(s) of the descendant node(s) and all
the served UEs retain the RRC connectivity with the initial IAB-donor-CU, in
the same manner as for _inter-donor partial migration_.
The BH RLF recovery procedure for the IAB-node is captured in TS 38.401 [4].
BH RLF declaration for IAB-node and the aspects of RLF recovery by the IAB-MT
are handled in clause 9.2.7 of the present document.
#### 4.7.4.5 OTA timing synchronization
An IAB-DU is subject to the same downlink timing alignment of a gNB. The IAB-
DU may use the received downlink signal from a parent as a reference to
control its downlink timing using TA in conjunction with an additional Tdelta
parameter received by the collocated IAB-MT from the parent via MAC-CE.
#### 4.7.4.6 Inter node discovery
Inter node discovery is supported via SSB-based and/or CSI-RS-based
measurements. An IAB-node can be configured to transmit and receive off
synchronization raster SSB signals to discover neighbouring IAB-nodes. The
configuration is not expected to create a conflict between IAB-DU SSB
transmission and IAB-MT SSB measurement windows.
## 4.8 Non-Public Networks
A Non-Public Network (NPN) is a network for non-public use (see TS 22.261
[19]), which can be deployed as (see TS 23.501 [3]):
\- a Stand-alone Non-Public Network (SNPN) when not relying on network
functions provided by a PLMN; or
\- a Public Network Integrated (PNI) NPN when relying on the support of a
PLMN.
NOTE: As described in clause 5.30.3.1 of TS 23.501 [3], there are several
approaches in which PNI-NPNs can be made available via PLMNs. The only
approach visible to AS, and hence the only approach that is addressed in AS
specifications is the approach of using CAGs.
# 5 Physical Layer
## 5.1 Waveform, numerology and frame structure
The downlink transmission waveform is conventional OFDM using a Cyclic Prefix.
The uplink transmission waveform is conventional OFDM using a CP with a
transform precoding function performing DFT spreading that can be disabled or
enabled. For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, the uplink
transmission waveform subcarrier mapping can map to subcarriers in one or more
PRB interlaces.
Figure 5.1-1: Transmitter block diagram for CP-OFDM with optional DFT-
spreading
The numerology is based on exponentially scalable sub-carrier spacing _âˆ†f_ = 2
_^Âµ^_ Ã— 15 kHz with _Âµ_ ={0,1,3,4,5,6} for PSS, SSS and PBCH and _Âµ_
={0,1,2,3,5,6} for other channels. Normal CP is supported for all sub-carrier
spacings, Extended CP is supported for _Âµ_ =2. 12 consecutive sub-carriers
form a Physical Resource Block (PRB). Up to 275 PRBs are supported on a
carrier.
Table 5.1-1: Supported transmission numerologies.

Normal Yes Yes 4 240 Normal No Yes 5 480 Normal Yes Yes 6 960 Normal Yes Yes
The UE may be configured with one or more bandwidth parts on a given component
carrier, of which only one can be active at a time, as described in clauses
7.8 and 6.10 respectively. The active bandwidth part defines the UE\'s
operating bandwidth within the cell\'s operating bandwidth. For initial
access, and until the UE\'s configuration in a cell is received, initial
bandwidth part detected from system information is used.
Downlink and uplink transmissions are organized into frames with 10 ms
duration, consisting of ten 1 ms subframes. Each frame is divided into two
equally-sized half-frames of five subframes each. The slot duration is 14
symbols with Normal CP and 12 symbols with Extended CP, and scales in time as
a function of the used sub-carrier spacing so that there is always an integer
number of slots in a subframe.
Timing Advance _TA_ is used to adjust the uplink frame timing relative to the
downlink frame timing.
Figure 5.1-2: Uplink-downlink timing relation
Operation on both paired and unpaired spectrum is supported.
## 5.2 Downlink
### 5.2.1 Downlink transmission scheme
A closed loop Demodulation Reference Signal (DMRS) based spatial multiplexing
is supported for Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH). Up to 8 and 12
orthogonal DL DMRS ports are supported for type 1 and type 2 DMRS
respectively. Up to 8 orthogonal DL DMRS ports per UE are supported for SU-
MIMO and up to 4 orthogonal DL DMRS ports per UE are supported for MU-MIMO.
The number of SU-MIMO code words is one for 1-4 layer transmissions and two
for 5-8 layer transmissions.
The DMRS and corresponding PDSCH are transmitted using the same precoding
matrix and the UE does not need to know the precoding matrix to demodulate the
transmission. The transmitter may use different precoder matrix for different
parts of the transmission bandwidth, resulting in frequency selective
precoding. The UE may also assume that the same precoding matrix is used
across a set of Physical Resource Blocks (PRBs) denoted Precoding Resource
Block Group (PRG).
Transmission durations from 2 to 14 symbols in a slot is supported.
Aggregation of multiple slots with Transport Block (TB) repetition is
supported.
### 5.2.2 Physical-layer processing for physical downlink shared channel
The downlink physical-layer processing of transport channels consists of the
following steps:
\- Transport block CRC attachment;
\- Code block segmentation and code block CRC attachment;
\- Channel coding: LDPC coding;
\- Physical-layer hybrid-ARQ processing;
\- Rate matching;
\- Scrambling;
\- Modulation: QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM, 256QAM, and 1024QAM;
\- Layer mapping;
\- Mapping to assigned resources and antenna ports.
The UE may assume that at least one symbol with demodulation reference signal
is present on each layer in which PDSCH is transmitted to a UE, and up to 3
additional DMRS can be configured by higher layers.
Phase Tracking RS may be transmitted on additional symbols to aid receiver
phase tracking.
The DL-SCH physical layer model is described in TS 38.202 [20].
### 5.2.3 Physical downlink control channels
The Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH) can be used to schedule DL
transmissions on PDSCH and UL transmissions on PUSCH, where the Downlink
Control Information (DCI) on PDCCH includes:
\- Downlink assignments containing at least modulation and coding format,
resource allocation, and hybrid-ARQ information related to DL-SCH;
\- Uplink scheduling grants containing at least modulation and coding format,
resource allocation, and hybrid-ARQ information related to UL-SCH.
In addition to scheduling, PDCCH can be used to for:
\- Activation and deactivation of configured PUSCH transmission with
configured grant;
\- Activation and deactivation of PDSCH semi-persistent transmission;
\- Notifying one or more UEs of the slot format;
\- Notifying one or more UEs of the PRB(s) and OFDM symbol(s) where the UE may
assume no transmission is intended for the UE;
\- Transmission of TPC commands for PUCCH and PUSCH;
\- Transmission of one or more TPC commands for SRS transmissions by one or
more UEs;
\- Switching a UE\'s active bandwidth part;
\- Initiating a random access procedure;
\- Indicating the UE(s) to monitor the PDCCH during the next occurrence of the
DRX on-duration;
\- In IAB context, indicating the availability for soft symbols of an IAB-DU;
\- Triggering one shot HARQ-ACK codebook feedback;
\- For operation with shared spectrum channel access:
\- Triggering search space set group switching;
\- Indicating one or more UEs about the available RB sets and channel
occupancy time duration;
\- Indicating downlink feedback information for configured grant PUSCH (CG-
DFI).
A UE monitors a set of PDCCH candidates in the configured monitoring occasions
in one or more configured COntrol REsource SETs (CORESETs) according to the
corresponding search space configurations.
A CORESET consists of a set of PRBs with a time duration of 1 to 3 OFDM
symbols. The resource units Resource Element Groups (REGs) and Control Channel
Elements (CCEs) are defined within a CORESET with each CCE consisting a set of
REGs. Control channels are formed by aggregation of CCE. Different code rates
for the control channels are realized by aggregating different number of CCE.
Interleaved and non-interleaved CCE-to-REG mapping are supported in a CORESET.
The PDCCH repetition is operated by using two search spaces which are
explicitly linked by configuration provided by the RRC layer, and are
associated with corresponding CORESETs. For PDCCH repetition, two linked
search spaces are configured with the same number of candidates, and two PDCCH
candidates in two search spaces are linked with the same candidate index. When
PDCCH repetition is scheduled to a UE, an intra-slot repetition is allowed and
**each repetition has the same number of CCEs and coded bits, and corresponds
to the same DCI payload.**
Polar coding is used for PDCCH.
Each resource element group carrying PDCCH carries its own DMRS.
QPSK modulation is used for PDCCH.
### 5.2.4 Synchronization signal and PBCH block
The Synchronization Signal and PBCH block (SSB) consists of primary and
secondary synchronization signals (PSS, SSS), each occupying 1 symbol and 127
subcarriers, and PBCH spanning across 3 OFDM symbols and 240 subcarriers, but
on one symbol leaving an unused part in the middle for SSS as show in Figure
5.2.4-1. The possible time locations of SSBs within a half-frame are
determined by sub-carrier spacing and the periodicity of the half-frames where
SSBs are transmitted is configured by the network. During a half-frame,
different SSBs may be transmitted in different spatial directions (i.e. using
different beams, spanning the coverage area of a cell).
Within the frequency span of a carrier, multiple SSBs can be transmitted. The
PCIs of SSBs transmitted in different frequency locations do not have to be
unique, i.e. different SSBs in the frequency domain can have different PCIs.
However, when an SSB is associated with an RMSI, the SSB is referred to as a
Cell-Defining SSB (CD-SSB). A PCell is always associated to a CD-SSB located
on the synchronization raster.
Figure 5.2.4-1: Time-frequency structure of SSB
Polar coding is used for PBCH.
The UE may assume a band-specific sub-carrier spacing for the SSB unless a
network has configured the UE to assume a different sub-carrier spacing.
PBCH symbols carry its own frequency-multiplexed DMRS.
QPSK modulation is used for PBCH.
The PBCH physical layer model is described in TS 38.202 [20].
### 5.2.5 Physical layer procedures
#### 5.2.5.1 Link adaptation
Link adaptation (AMC: adaptive modulation and coding) with various modulation
schemes and channel coding rates is applied to the PDSCH. The same coding and
modulation is applied to all groups of resource blocks belonging to the same
L2 PDU scheduled to one user within one transmission duration and within a
MIMO codeword.
For channel state estimation purposes, the UE may be configured to measure
CSI-RS and estimate the downlink channel state based on the CSI-RS
measurements. The UE feeds the estimated channel state back to the gNB to be
used in link adaptation.
#### 5.2.5.2 Power Control
Downlink power control can be used.
#### 5.2.5.3 Cell search
Cell search is the procedure by which a UE acquires time and frequency
synchronization with a cell and detects the Cell ID of that cell. NR cell
search is based on the primary and secondary synchronization signals, and PBCH
DMRS, located on the synchronization raster.
#### 5.2.5.4 HARQ
Asynchronous Incremental Redundancy Hybrid ARQ is supported. The gNB provides
the UE with the HARQ-ACK feedback timing either dynamically in the DCI or
semi-statically in an RRC configuration. Retransmission of HARQ-ACK feedback
is supported by using enhanced dynamic codebook and/or one-shot triggering of
HARQ-ACK transmission for (i) all configured CCs and HARQ processes in the
PUCCH group, (ii) a configured subset of CCs and/or HARQ processes in the
PUCCH group, or (iii) a dynamically indicated HARQ-ACK feedback instance. For
HARQ-ACK of SPS PDSCH without associated PDCCH, in case of HARQ-ACK dropping
due to TDD specific collisions, the HARQ-ACK feedback can be deferred to a
next available PUCCH transmission occasion.
The UE may be configured to receive code block group based transmissions where
retransmissions may be scheduled to carry a sub-set of all the code blocks of
a TB.
#### 5.2.5.5 Reception of SIB1
The Master Information Block (MIB) on PBCH provides the UE with parameters
(e.g. CORESET#0 configuration) for monitoring of PDCCH for scheduling PDSCH
that carries the System Information Block 1 (SIB1). PBCH may also indicate
that there is no associated SIB1, in which case the UE may be pointed to
another frequency from where to search for an SSB that is associated with a
SIB1 as well as a frequency range where the UE may assume no SSB associated
with SIB1 is present. The indicated frequency range is confined within a
contiguous spectrum allocation of the same operator in which SSB is detected.
### 5.2.6 Downlink Reference Signals and Measurements for Positioning
The DL Positioning Reference Signals (DL PRS) are defined to facilitate
support of different positioning methods such as DL-TDOA, DL-AoD, multi-RTT
through the following set of UE measurements DL RSTD, DL PRS-RSRP, and UE Rx-
Tx time difference respectively as described in TS 38.305 [42].
Besides DL PRS signals, UE can use SSB and CSI-RS for RRM (RSRP and RSRQ)
measurements for E-CID type of positioning.
## 5.3 Uplink
### 5.3.1 Uplink transmission scheme
Two transmission schemes are supported for PUSCH: codebook based transmission
and non-codebook based transmission.
For codebook based transmission, the gNB provides the UE with a transmit
precoding matrix indication in the DCI. The UE uses the indication to select
the PUSCH transmit precoder from the codebook. For non-codebook based
transmission, the UE determines its PUSCH precoder based on wideband SRI field
from the DCI.
A closed loop DMRS based spatial multiplexing is supported for PUSCH. For a
given UE, up to 4 layer transmissions are supported. The number of code words
is one. When transform precoding is used, only a single MIMO layer
transmission is supported.
Transmission durations from 1 to 14 symbols in a slot is supported.
Aggregation of multiple slots with TB repetition is supported.
Two types of frequency hopping are supported, intra-slot frequency hopping,
and in case of slot aggregation, inter-slot frequency hopping. Intra-slot and
inter-slot frequency hopping are not supported when PRB interlace uplink
transmission waveform is used.
PUSCH may be scheduled with DCI on PDCCH, or a semi-static configured grant
may be provided over RRC, where two types of operation are supported:
\- The first PUSCH is triggered with a DCI, with subsequent PUSCH
transmissions following the RRC configuration and scheduling received on the
DCI, or
\- The PUSCH is triggered by data arrival to the UE\'s transmit buffer and the
PUSCH transmissions follow the RRC configuration.
### 5.3.2 Physical-layer processing for physical uplink shared channel
The uplink physical-layer processing of transport channels consists of the
following steps:
\- Transport Block CRC attachment;
\- Code block segmentation and Code Block CRC attachment;
\- Channel coding: LDPC coding;
\- Physical-layer hybrid-ARQ processing;
\- Rate matching;
\- Scrambling;
\- Modulation: Ï€/2 BPSK (with transform precoding only), QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM
and 256QAM;
\- Layer mapping, transform precoding (enabled/disabled by configuration), and
pre-coding;
\- Mapping to assigned resources and antenna ports.
The UE transmits at least one symbol with demodulation reference signal on
each layer on each frequency hop in which the PUSCH is transmitted, and up to
3 additional DMRS can be configured by higher layers.
Phase Tracking RS may be transmitted on additional symbols to aid receiver
phase tracking.
The UL-SCH physical layer model is described in TS 38.202 [20].
For configured grants operation with shared spectrum channel access, described
in clause 10.3, a CG-UCI (Configured Grant Uplink Control Information) can be
transmitted in PUSCH scheduled by configured uplink grant.
### 5.3.3 Physical uplink control channel
Physical uplink control channel (PUCCH) carries the Uplink Control Information
(UCI) from the UE to the gNB. Five formats of PUCCH exist, depending on the
duration of PUCCH and the UCI payload size:
\- Format #0: Short PUCCH of 1 or 2 symbols with small UCI payloads of up to
two bits with UE multiplexing capacity of up to 6 UEs with 1-bit payload in
the same PRB;
\- Format #1: Long PUCCH of 4-14 symbols with small UCI payloads of up to two
bits with UE multiplexing capacity of up to 84 UEs without frequency hopping
and 36 UEs with frequency hopping in the same PRB;
\- Format #2: Short PUCCH of 1 or 2 symbols with large UCI payloads of more
than two bits with no UE multiplexing capability in the same PRBs;
\- Format #3: Long PUCCH of 4-14 symbols with large UCI payloads with no UE
multiplexing capability in the same PRBs;
\- Format #4: Long PUCCH of 4-14 symbols with moderate UCI payloads with
multiplexing capacity of up to 4 UEs in the same PRBs.
The short PUCCH format of up to two UCI bits is based on sequence selection,
while the short PUCCH format of more than two UCI bits frequency multiplexes
UCI and DMRS. The long PUCCH formats time-multiplex the UCI and DMRS.
Frequency hopping is supported for long PUCCH formats and for short PUCCH
formats of duration of 2 symbols. Short and long PUCCH formats can be repeated
over multiple slots or sub-slots, where the repetition factor is either
indicated dynamically in the DCI or semi-statically in an RRC configuration.
For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, PUCCH Format #0, #1,
#2, #3 are extended to use resource in one PRB interlace (up to two interlaces
for Format #2 and Format #3) in one RB Set. PUCCH Format #2 and #3 are
enhanced to support multiplexing capacity of up to 4 UEs in the same PRB
interlace when one interlace is used.
For operation in FR2-2, PUCCH Format #0, #1, #4 are extended to use resource
in configurable number of continuous PRBs, up to 16 PRBs.
Up to two PUCCH configurations can be configured for a UE per PUCCH group (see
TS 38.331 [12]), where the first PUCCH configuration is associated with a
PUCCH of priority index 0 (low) and the second PUCCH configuration is
associated with a PUCCH of priority index 1 (high).
UCI multiplexing in PUCCH is supported when PUCCH transmissions of UCIs
coincide in time, and are associated with the same priority (high/low). In
addition, multiplexing of HARQ-ACK of priority index 0 (low) and UCI of
priority index 1 (high) in PUCCH of priority index 1 (high) is supported when
PUCCH transmissions of HARQ-ACK of priority index 0 and UCI of priority index
1 (high) coincide in time.
UCI multiplexing in PUSCH is supported when UCI and PUSCH transmissions
coincide in time, either due to transmission of a UL-SCH transport block or
due to triggering of A-CSI transmission without UL-SCH transport block, and
are associated with the same priority (high/low). In addition, HARQ-ACK
multiplexing of a certain priority in PUSCH of a different priority is
supported when HARQ-ACK and PUSCH transmissions coincide in time, either due
to transmission of a UL-SCH transport block or due to triggering of A-CSI
transmission without UL-SCH transport block:
\- UCI carrying HARQ-ACK feedback with 1 or 2 bits is multiplexed by
puncturing PUSCH;
\- In all other cases UCI is multiplexed by rate matching PUSCH.
UCI consists of the following information:
\- CSI;
\- ACK/NAK;
\- Scheduling request.
Simultaneous transmission of PUCCH and PUSCH associated with different
priorities on cells of different bands in a PUCCH group is supported, where
UCI multiplexing in the PUCCH associated with a priority in combination of UCI
multiplexing in a PUSCH associated with a different priority is supported if
the UCI multiplexed on PUSCH is of same priority as the PUSCH.
For operation with shared spectrum channel access, multiplexing of CG-UCI and
PUCCH carrying HARQ-ACK feedback can be configured by the gNB. If not
configured, when PUCCH overlaps with PUSCH scheduled by a configured grant
within a PUCCH group and PUCCH carries HARQ ACK feedback, PUSCH scheduled by
configured grant is skipped.
QPSK and Ï€/2 BPSK modulation can be used for long PUCCH with more than 2 bits
of information, QPSK is used for short PUCCH with more than 2 bits of
information and BPSK and QPSK modulation can be used for long PUCCH with up to
2 information bits.
Transform precoding is applied to PUCCH Format #3 and Format #4.
Channel coding used for uplink control information is described in table
5.3.3-1.
Table 5.3.3-1: Channel coding for uplink control information
Uplink Control Information size including CRC, if present Channel code
* * *
1 Repetition code 2 Simplex code 3-11 Reed Muller code >11 Polar code
### 5.3.4 Random access
Random access preamble sequences, of four different lengths are supported.
Sequence length 839 is applied with subcarrier spacings of 1.25 and 5 kHz,
sequence length 139 is applied with subcarrier spacings of 15, 30, 60, 120,
480, and 960 kHz, sequence length of 571 is applied with subcarrier spacings
of 30, 120, and 480 kHz, and sequence length 1151 is applied with subcarrier
spacings of 15 and 120 kHz. Sequence length 839 supports unrestricted sets and
restricted sets of Type A and Type B, while sequence lengths 139, 571, and
1151 support unrestricted sets only. Sequence length 839 is only used for
operation with licensed channel access while sequence length 139 can be used
for operation with either licensed or shared spectrum channel access. For FR1,
sequence lengths of 571 and 1151 can be used only for operation with shared
spectrum channel access. For FR2-2, sequence lengths of 571 can be used for
operation with either licensed or shared spectrum channel access only with
subcarrier spacings of 120 kHz and 480 kHz and sequence lengths of 1151 can be
used for operation with either licensed or shared spectrum channel access only
with subcarrier spacings of 120 kHz.
Multiple PRACH preamble formats are defined with one or more PRACH OFDM
symbols, and different CP and guard time. The PRACH preamble configuration to
use is provided to the UE in the system information.
For IAB additional random access configurations are defined. These
configurations are obtained by extending the random access configurations
defined for UEs via scaling the periodicity and/or offsetting the time domain
position of the RACH occasions.
IAB-MTs can be provided with random access configurations (as defined for UEs
or after applying the aforementioned scaling/offsetting) different from random
access configurations provided to UEs.
The UE calculates the PRACH transmit power for the retransmission of the
preamble based on the most recent estimate pathloss and power ramping counter.
The system information provides information for the UE to determine the
association between the SSB and the RACH resources. The RSRP threshold for SSB
selection for RACH resource association is configurable by network.
### 5.3.5 Physical layer procedures
#### 5.3.5.1 Link adaptation
Four types of link adaptation are supported as follows:
\- Adaptive transmission bandwidth;
\- Adaptive transmission duration;
\- Transmission power control;
\- Adaptive modulation and channel coding rate.
For channel state estimation purposes, the UE may be configured to transmit
SRS that the gNB may use to estimate the uplink channel state and use the
estimate in link adaptation.
#### 5.3.5.2 Uplink Power control
The gNB determines the desired uplink transmit power and provides uplink
transmit power control commands to the UE. The UE uses the provided uplink
transmit power control commands to adjust its transmit power.
#### 5.3.5.3 Uplink timing control
The gNB (including IAB-DU and IAB-donor-DU) determines the desired Timing
Advance setting and provides that to the UE (or IAB-MT). The UE/IAB-MT uses
the provided TA to determine its uplink transmit timing relative to the
UE\'s/IAB-MTs observed downlink receive timing.
An IAB-node may support additional modes for uplink timing:
\- The IAB-MT uses the provided TA plus a provided additional offset to
determine its uplink transmission timing, to facilitate parent node\'s IAB-MT
Rx / IAB-DU Rx multiplexing;
\- The IAB-MT aligns its uplink transmission timing to that of the collocated
IAB-DU downlink transmission timing, to facilitate IAB-MT Tx / IAB-DU Tx
multiplexing of this IAB-node.
The IAB-node uplink timing mode is indicated by the parent node via MAC-CE.
#### 5.3.5.4 HARQ
Asynchronous Incremental Redundancy Hybrid ARQ is supported. The gNB schedules
each uplink transmission and retransmission using the uplink grant on DCI. For
operation with shared spectrum channel access, UE can also retransmit on
configured grants if configured.
The UE may be configured to transmit code block group based transmissions
where retransmissions may be scheduled to carry a sub-set of all the code
blocks of a transport block.
Up to two HARQ-ACK codebooks corresponding to a priority (high/low) can be
constructed simultaneously. For each HARQ-ACK codebook, more than one PUCCH
for HARQ-ACK transmission within a slot is supported. Each PUCCH is limited
within one sub-slot, and the sub-slot pattern is configured per HARQ-ACK
codebook.
#### 5.3.5.5 Prioritization of overlapping transmissions
PUSCH and PUCCH can be associated with a priority (high/low) by RRC or L1
signalling. If a PUCCH transmission overlaps in time with a transmission of a
PUSCH or another PUCCH, only the PUCCH or PUSCH associated with a high
priority can be transmitted.
### 5.3.6 Uplink Reference Signals and Measurements for Positioning
The periodic, semipersistent and aperiodic transmission of Rel-15 SRS is
defined for gNB UL RTOA, UL SRS-RSRP, UL-AoA measurements to facilitate
support of UL TDOA and UL AoA positioning methods as described in TS 38.305
[42].
The periodic, semipersistent and aperiodic transmission of SRS for positioning
is defined for gNB UL RTOA, UL SRS-RSRP, UL-AoA, gNB Rx-Tx time difference
measurements to facilitate support of UL TDOA, UL AoA and multi-RTT
positioning methods as described in TS 38.305 [42].
## 5.4 Carrier aggregation
### 5.4.1 Carrier aggregation
In Carrier Aggregation (CA), two or more Component Carriers (CCs) are
aggregated. A UE may simultaneously receive or transmit on one or multiple CCs
depending on its capabilities:
\- A UE with single timing advance capability for CA can simultaneously
receive and/or transmit on multiple CCs corresponding to multiple serving
cells sharing the same timing advance (multiple serving cells grouped in one
TAG);
\- A UE with multiple timing advance capability for CA can simultaneously
receive and/or transmit on multiple CCs corresponding to multiple serving
cells with different timing advances (multiple serving cells grouped in
multiple TAGs). NG-RAN ensures that each TAG contains at least one serving
cell;
\- A non-CA capable UE can receive on a single CC and transmit on a single CC
corresponding to one serving cell only (one serving cell in one TAG).
CA is supported for both contiguous and non-contiguous CCs. When CA is
deployed frame timing and SFN are aligned across cells that can be aggregated,
or an offset in multiples of slots between the PCell/PSCell and an SCell is
configured to the UE. The maximum number of configured CCs for a UE is 16 for
DL and 16 for UL.
### 5.4.2 Supplementary Uplink
In conjunction with a UL/DL carrier pair (FDD band) or a bidirectional carrier
(TDD band), a UE may be configured with additional, Supplementary Uplink
(SUL). SUL differs from the aggregated uplink in that the UE may be scheduled
to transmit either on the supplementary uplink or on the uplink of the carrier
being supplemented, but not on both at the same time.
### 5.4.3 Uplink Tx switching
In uplink CA or SUL, a UE configured with uplink Tx switching can have Tx
dynamically switched from one uplink carrier to another uplink carrier for
enabling 2Tx UL transmission on that carrier.
## 5.5 Transport Channels
The physical layer offers information transfer services to MAC and higher
layers. The physical layer transport services are described by _how_ and with
what characteristics data are transferred over the radio interface. An
adequate term for this is \"Transport Channel\". This should be clearly
separated from the classification of _what_ is transported, which relates to
the concept of logical channels at MAC sublayer.
Downlink transport channel types are:
1\. **Broadcast Channel (BCH)** characterised by:
\- fixed, pre-defined transport format;
\- requirement to be broadcast in the entire coverage area of the cell, either
as a single message or by beamforming different BCH instances.
2\. **Downlink Shared Channel (DL-SCH)** characterised by:
\- support for HARQ;
\- support for dynamic link adaptation by varying the modulation, coding and
transmit power;
\- possibility to be broadcast in the entire cell;
\- possibility to use beamforming;
\- support for both dynamic and semi-static resource allocation;
\- support for UE discontinuous reception (DRX) to enable UE power saving.
3\. **Paging Channel (PCH)** characterised by:
\- support for UE discontinuous reception (DRX) to enable UE power saving (DRX
cycle is indicated by the network to the UE);
\- requirement to be broadcast in the entire coverage area of the cell, either
as a single message or by beamforming different BCH instances;
\- mapped to physical resources which can be used dynamically also for
traffic/other control channels.
Uplink transport channel types are:
1\. **Uplink Shared Channel (UL-SCH)** characterised by:
\- possibility to use beamforming;
\- support for dynamic link adaptation by varying the transmit power and
potentially modulation and coding;
\- support for HARQ;
\- support for both dynamic and semi-static resource allocation.
2\. **Random Access Channel(s) (RACH)** characterised by:
\- limited control information;
\- collision risk.
Sidelink transport channel types are:
1\. **Sidelink broadcast channel (SL-BCH)** characterised by:
\- pre-defined transport format.
2\. **Sidelink shared channel (SL-SCH)** characterised by:
\- support for unicast transmission, groupcast transmission and broadcast
transmission;
\- support for both UE autonomous resource selection and scheduled resource
allocation by NG-RAN;
\- support for both dynamic and semi-static resource allocation when UE is
allocated resources by the NG-RAN;
\- support for HARQ;
\- support for dynamic link adaptation by varying the transmit power,
modulation and coding;
\- support for SL discontinuous reception (SL DRX) to enable UE power saving.
Association of transport channels to physical channels is described in TS
38.202 [20].
## 5.6 Access to Shared Spectrum
### 5.6.1 Overview
NR Radio Access operating with shared spectrum channel access can operate in
different modes where either PCell, PSCell, or SCells can be in shared
spectrum and an SCell may or may not be configured with uplink. The applicable
deployment scenarios are described in Annex B.3.
The gNB performs channel access mode procedures as described in TS 37.213
[37]. The gNB and the UE may apply Listen-Before-Talk (LBT) before performing
a transmission on a cell configured with shared spectrum channel access. When
LBT is applied, the transmitter listens to/senses the channel to determine
whether the channel is free or busy and performs transmission only if the
channel is sensed free.
When the UE detects consistent uplink LBT failures, it takes actions as
specified in TS 38.321 [6]. The detection is per Bandwidth Part (BWP) and
based on all uplink transmissions within this BWP. When consistent uplink LBT
failures are detected on SCell(s), the UE reports this to the corresponding
gNB (MN for MCG, SN for SCG) via MAC CE on a different serving cell than the
SCell(s) where the failures were detected. If no resources are available to
transmit the MAC CE, a Scheduling Request (SR) can be transmitted by the UE.
When consistent uplink LBT failures are detected on SpCell, the UE switches to
another UL BWP with configured RACH resources on that cell, initiates RACH,
and reports the failure via MAC CE. When multiple UL BWPs are available for
switching, it is up to the UE implementation which one to select. For PSCell,
if consistent uplink LBT failures are detected on all the UL BWPs with
configured RACH resources, the UE declares SCG RLF and reports the failure to
the MN via _SCGFailureInformation._ For PCell, if the uplink LBT failures are
detected on all the UL BWP(s) with configured RACH resources, the UE declares
RLF.
### 5.6.2 Channel Access Priority Classes
The Channel Access Priority Classes (CAPC) of radio bearers and MAC CEs are
either fixed or configurable for operation in FR1:
\- Fixed to the lowest priority for the padding BSR and recommended bit rate
MAC CEs;
\- Fixed to the highest priority for SRB0, SRB1, SRB3 and other MAC CEs;
\- Configured by the gNB for SRB2 and DRB.
When choosing the CAPC of a DRB, the gNB takes into account the 5QIs of all
the QoS flows multiplexed in that DRB while considering fairness between
different traffic types and transmissions. Table 5.6.2-1 below shows which
CAPC should be used for which standardized 5QIs i.e. which CAPC to use for a
given QoS flow.
NOTE: A QoS flow corresponding to a non-standardized 5QI (i.e. operator
specific 5QI) should use the CAPC of the standardized 5QI which best matches
the QoS characteristics of the non-standardized 5QI.
Table 5.6.2-1: Mapping between Channel Access Priority Classes and 5QI
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | CAPC | 5QI | +==================================+==================================+ | 1 | 1, 3, 5, 65, 66, 67, 69, 70, 79, | | | 80, 82, 83, 84, 85 | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 2 | 2, 7, 71 | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 3 | 4, 6, 8, 9, 72, 73, 74, 76 | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | 4 | - | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | NOTE: lower CAPC value means | | | higher priority | | | | | | - | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
When performing Type 1 LBT for the transmission of an uplink TB (see TS 37.213
[37], clause 4.2.1.1) and when the CAPC is not indicated in the DCI, the UE
shall select the CAPC as follows:
\- If only MAC CE(s) are included in the TB, the highest priority CAPC of
those MAC CE(s) is used; or
\- If CCCH SDU(s) are included in the TB, the highest priority CAPC is used;
or
\- If DCCH SDU(s) are included in the TB, the highest priority CAPC of the
DCCH(s) is used; or
\- The lowest priority CAPC of the logical channel(s) with MAC SDU multiplexed
in the TB is used otherwise.
## 5.7 Sidelink
### 5.7.1 General
Sidelink supports UE-to-UE direct communication using the sidelink resource
allocation modes, physical-layer signals/channels, and physical layer
procedures below.
### 5.7.2 Sidelink resource allocation modes
Two sidelink resource allocation modes are supported: mode 1 and mode 2. In
mode 1, the sidelink resource allocation is provided by the network. In mode
2, UE decides the SL transmission resources in the resource pool(s).
### 5.7.3 Physical sidelink channels and signals
Physical Sidelink Control Channel (PSCCH) indicates resource and other
transmission parameters used by a UE for PSSCH. PSCCH transmission is
associated with a DM-RS.
Physical Sidelink Shared Channel (PSSCH) transmits the TBs of data themselves,
and control information for HARQ procedures and CSI feedback triggers, etc. At
least 6 OFDM symbols within a slot are used for PSSCH transmission. PSSCH
transmission is associated with a DM-RS and may be associated with a PT-RS.
Physical Sidelink Feedback Channel (PSFCH) carries HARQ feedback over the
sidelink from a UE which is an intended recipient of a PSSCH transmission to
the UE which performed the transmission. PSFCH sequence is transmitted in one
PRB repeated over two OFDM symbols near the end of the sidelink resource in a
slot.
The Sidelink synchronization signal consists of sidelink primary and sidelink
secondary synchronization signals (S-PSS, S-SSS), each occupying 2 symbols and
127 subcarriers. Physical Sidelink Broadcast Channel (PSBCH) occupies 9 and 7
symbols for normal and extended CP cases respectively, including the
associated DM-RS.
### 5.7.4 Physical layer procedures for sidelink
#### 5.7.4.1 HARQ feedback
Sidelink HARQ feedback uses PSFCH and can be operated in one of two options.
In one option, which can be configured for unicast and groupcast, PSFCH
transmits either ACK or NACK using a resource dedicated to a single PSFCH
transmitting UE. In another option, which can be configured for groupcast,
PSFCH transmits NACK, or no PSFCH signal is transmitted, on a resource that
can be shared by multiple PSFCH transmitting UEs.
In sidelink resource allocation mode 1, a UE which received PSFCH can report
sidelink HARQ feedback to gNB via PUCCH or PUSCH.
#### 5.7.4.2 Power Control
For in-coverage operation, the power spectral density of the sidelink
transmissions can be adjusted based on the pathloss from the gNB.
For unicast, the power spectral density of some sidelink transmissions can be
adjusted based on the pathloss between the two communicating UEs.
#### 5.7.4.3 CSI report
For unicast, channel state information reference signal (CSI-RS) is supported
for CSI measurement and reporting in sidelink. A CSI report is carried in a
sidelink MAC CE.
### 5.7.5 Physical layer measurement definition
For measurement on the sidelink, the following UE measurement quantities are
supported:
\- PSBCH reference signal received power (PSBCH RSRP);
\- PSSCH reference signal received power (PSSCH-RSRP);
\- PSÐ¡CH reference signal received power (PSCCH-RSRP);
\- Sidelink received signal strength indicator (SL RSSI);
\- Sidelink channel occupancy ratio (SL CR);
\- Sidelink channel busy ratio (SL CBR).
# 6 Layer 2
## 6.1 Overview
The layer 2 of NR is split into the following sublayers: Medium Access Control
(MAC), Radio Link Control (RLC), Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) and
Service Data Adaptation Protocol (SDAP). The two figures below depict the
Layer 2 architecture for downlink and uplink, where:
\- The physical layer offers to the MAC sublayer transport channels;
\- The MAC sublayer offers to the RLC sublayer logical channels;
\- The RLC sublayer offers to the PDCP sublayer RLC channels;
\- The PDCP sublayer offers to the SDAP sublayer radio bearers;
\- The SDAP sublayer offers to 5GC QoS flows;
\- _Comp._ refers to header compression or uplink data compression;
\- _Segm._ refers to segmentation;
\- Control channels (BCCH, PCCH are not depicted for clarity).
NOTE: The gNB may not be able to guarantee that a L2 buffer overflow will
never occur. If such overflow occurs, the UE may discard packets in the L2
buffer.
Figure 6.1-1: Downlink Layer 2 Structure
Figure 6.1-2: Uplink Layer 2 Structure
Radio bearers are categorized into two groups: data radio bearers (DRB) for
user plane data and signalling radio bearers (SRB) for control plane data.
For IAB, the Layer 2 of NR includes: MAC, RLC, Backhaul Adaptation Protocol
(BAP), PDCP and optionally SDAP. The BAP sublayer supports routing across the
IAB topology and traffic mapping to BH RLC channels for enforcement of traffic
prioritization and QoS.
Figures 6.1-3 below depicts the Layer-2 architecture for downlink on the IAB-
donor. Figure 6.1-4 and 6.1-5 depict the Layer-2 architecture for downlink and
uplink on the IAB-node, where the BAP sublayer offers routing functionality
and mapping to BH RLC channels.

Figure 6.1-4: DL L2-structure at IAB-node
Figure 6.1-5: UL L2-structure at IAB-node
## 6.2 MAC Sublayer
### 6.2.1 Services and Functions
The main services and functions of the MAC sublayer include:
\- Mapping between logical channels and transport channels;
\- Multiplexing/demultiplexing of MAC SDUs belonging to one or different
logical channels into/from transport blocks (TB) delivered to/from the
physical layer on transport channels;
\- Scheduling information reporting;
\- Error correction through HARQ (one HARQ entity per cell in case of CA);
\- Priority handling between UEs by means of dynamic scheduling;
\- Priority handling between logical channels of one UE by means of logical
channel prioritisation;
\- Priority handling between overlapping resources of one UE;
\- Padding.
A single MAC entity can support multiple numerologies, transmission timings
and cells. Mapping restrictions in logical channel prioritisation control
which numerology(ies), cell(s), and transmission timing(s) a logical channel
can use (see clause 16.1.2).
### 6.2.2 Logical Channels
Different kinds of data transfer services as offered by MAC. Each logical
channel type is defined by what type of information is transferred. Logical
channels are classified into two groups: Control Channels and Traffic
Channels. Control channels are used for the transfer of control plane
information only:
\- Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH): a downlink channel for broadcasting
system control information.
\- Paging Control Channel (PCCH): a downlink channel that carries paging
messages.
\- Common Control Channel (CCCH): channel for transmitting control information
between UEs and network. This channel is used for UEs having no RRC connection
with the network.
\- Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH): a point-to-point bi-directional channel
that transmits dedicated control information between a UE and the network.
Used by UEs having an RRC connection.
Traffic channels are used for the transfer of user plane information only:
**-** Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH): point-to-point channel, dedicated to
one UE, for the transfer of user information. A DTCH can exist in both uplink
and downlink.
### 6.2.3 Mapping to Transport Channels
In Downlink, the following connections between logical channels and transport
channels exist:
\- BCCH can be mapped to BCH;
\- BCCH can be mapped to DL-SCH;
\- PCCH can be mapped to PCH;
\- CCCH can be mapped to DL-SCH;
\- DCCH can be mapped to DL-SCH;
\- DTCH can be mapped to DL-SCH.
In Uplink, the following connections between logical channels and transport
channels exist:
\- CCCH can be mapped to UL-SCH;
\- DCCH can be mapped to UL- SCH;
\- DTCH can be mapped to UL-SCH.
### 6.2.4 HARQ
The HARQ functionality ensures delivery between peer entities at Layer 1\. A
single HARQ process supports one TB when the physical layer is not configured
for downlink/uplink spatial multiplexing, and when the physical layer is
configured for downlink/uplink spatial multiplexing, a single HARQ process
supports one or multiple TBs.
## 6.3 RLC Sublayer
### 6.3.1 Transmission Modes
The RLC sublayer supports three transmission modes:
\- Transparent Mode (TM);
\- Unacknowledged Mode (UM);
\- Acknowledged Mode (AM).
The RLC configuration is per logical channel with no dependency on
numerologies and/or transmission durations, and ARQ can operate on any of the
numerologies and/or transmission durations the logical channel is configured
with.
For SRB0, paging and broadcast system information, TM mode is used. For other
SRBs AM mode used. For DRBs, either UM or AM mode are used.
### 6.3.2 Services and Functions
The main services and functions of the RLC sublayer depend on the transmission
mode and include:
\- Transfer of upper layer PDUs;
\- Sequence numbering independent of the one in PDCP (UM and AM);
\- Error Correction through ARQ (AM only);
\- Segmentation (AM and UM) and re-segmentation (AM only) of RLC SDUs;
\- Reassembly of SDU (AM and UM);
\- Duplicate Detection (AM only);
\- RLC SDU discard (AM and UM);
\- RLC re-establishment;
\- Protocol error detection (AM only).
### 6.3.3 ARQ
The ARQ within the RLC sublayer has the following characteristics:
\- ARQ retransmits RLC SDUs or RLC SDU segments based on RLC status reports;
\- Polling for RLC status report is used when needed by RLC;
\- RLC receiver can also trigger RLC status report after detecting a missing
RLC SDU or RLC SDU segment.
## 6.4 PDCP Sublayer
### 6.4.1 Services and Functions
The main services and functions of the PDCP sublayer include:
\- Transfer of data (user plane or control plane);
\- Maintenance of PDCP SNs;
\- Header compression and decompression using the ROHC protocol;
\- Header compression and decompression using EHC protocol;
\- Compression and decompression of uplink PDCP SDUs: DEFLATE based UDC only;
\- Ciphering and deciphering;
\- Integrity protection and integrity verification;
\- Timer based SDU discard;
\- For split bearers, routing;
\- Duplication;
\- Reordering and in-order delivery;
\- Out-of-order delivery;
\- Duplicate discarding.
Since PDCP does not allow COUNT to wrap around in DL and UL, it is up to the
network to prevent it from happening (e.g. by using a release and add of the
corresponding radio bearer or a full configuration).
## 6.5 SDAP Sublayer
The main services and functions of SDAP include:
\- Mapping between a QoS flow and a data radio bearer;
\- Marking QoS flow ID (QFI) in both DL and UL packets.
A single protocol entity of SDAP is configured for each individual PDU
session.
## 6.6 L2 Data Flow
An example of the Layer 2 Data Flow is depicted on Figure 6.6-1, where a
transport block is generated by MAC by concatenating two RLC PDUs from RB
_~x~_ and one RLC PDU from RB _~y~_. The two RLC PDUs from RB _~x~_ each
corresponds to one IP packet (_n_ and _n+1_) while the RLC PDU from RB _~y~_
is a segment of an IP packet (_m_).
NOTE: H depicts the headers and subheaders.
Figure 6.6-1: Data Flow Example
## 6.7 Carrier Aggregation
In case of CA, the multi-carrier nature of the physical layer is only exposed
to the MAC layer for which one HARQ entity is required per serving cell as
depicted on Figures 6.7-1 and 6.7-2 below:
\- In both uplink and downlink, there is one independent hybrid-ARQ entity per
serving cell and one transport block is generated per assignment/grant per
serving cell in the absence of spatial multiplexing. Each transport block and
its potential HARQ retransmissions are mapped to a single serving cell.
Figure 6.7-1: Layer 2 Structure for DL with CA configured
Figure 6.7-2: Layer 2 Structure for UL with CA configured
## 6.8 Dual Connectivity
When the UE is configured with SCG, the UE is configured with two MAC
entities: one MAC entity for the MCG and one MAC entity for the SCG. Further
details of DC operation can be found in TS 37.340 [21].
## 6.9 Supplementary Uplink
In case of Supplementary Uplink (SUL, see TS 38.101-1 [18]), the UE is
configured with 2 ULs for one DL of the same cell, and uplink transmissions on
those two ULs are controlled by the network to avoid overlapping PUSCH/PUCCH
transmissions in time. Overlapping transmissions on PUSCH are avoided through
scheduling while overlapping transmissions on PUCCH are avoided through
configuration (PUCCH can only be configured for only one of the 2 ULs of the
cell). In addition, initial access is supported in each of the uplink (see
clause 9.2.6). An example of SUL is given in Annex B.
## 6.10 Bandwidth Adaptation
With Bandwidth Adaptation (BA), the receive and transmit bandwidth of a UE
need not be as large as the bandwidth of the cell and can be adjusted: the
width can be ordered to change (e.g. to shrink during period of low activity
to save power); the location can move in the frequency domain (e.g. to
increase scheduling flexibility); and the subcarrier spacing can be ordered to
change (e.g. to allow different services). A subset of the total cell
bandwidth of a cell is referred to as a Bandwidth Part (BWP) and BA is
achieved by configuring the UE with BWP(s) and telling the UE which of the
configured BWPs is currently the active one.
Figure 6.10-1 below describes a scenario where 3 different BWPs are
configured:
\- BWP~1~ with a width of 40 MHz and subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz;
\- BWP~2~ with a width of 10 MHz and subcarrier spacing of 15 kHz;
\- BWP~3~ with a width of 20 MHz and subcarrier spacing of 60 kHz.
Figure 6.10-1: BA Example
## 6.11 Backhaul Adaptation Protocol Sublayer
### 6.11.1 Services and Functions
The main service and functions of the BAP sublayer include:
\- Transfer of data;
\- Routing of packets to next hop;
\- Determination of BAP destination and BAP path for packets from upper
layers;
\- Determination of egress BH RLC channels for packets routed to next hop;
\- Differentiating traffic to be delivered to upper layers from traffic to be
delivered to egress link;
\- Flow control feedback and polling signalling;
\- BH RLF detection indication, BH RLF recovery indication, and BH RLF
indication;
\- BAP header rewriting.
### 6.11.2 Traffic Mapping from Upper Layers to Layer-2
In upstream direction, the IAB-donor-CU configures the IAB-node with mappings
between upstream F1 and non-F1 traffic originated at the IAB-node, and the
appropriate BAP routing ID, next-hop BAP address and BH RLC channel. A
specific mapping is configured:
> \- for each F1-U GTP-U tunnel;
>
> \- for non-UE associated F1AP messages;
>
> \- for UE-associated F1AP messages;
>
> \- for non-F1 traffic.
Multiple mappings can contain the same BH RLC channel and/or next-hop BAP
address and/or BAP routing ID. In case the IAB-MT is NR-dual-connected (SA
mode only), the mapping may include two separate BH RLC channels, where the
two BH RLC channels are established toward different parent nodes.
In case the IAB-node is configured with multiple IP addresses for F1-C on the
NR leg, multiple mappings can be configured for non-UE-associated F1AP
messages or UE-associated F1AP messages. The appropriate mapping is selected
based on the IAB-node\'s implementation.
These traffic mapping configurations are performed via F1AP. For a boundary
IAB-node, the traffic mapping configuration includes information that allows
the boundary IAB-node to determine the IAB topology the mapping applies to.
During IAB-node integration, a default BH RLC channel and a default BAP
routing ID may be configured via RRC, which can be used for non-F1-U traffic.
These default configurations may be updated during topology adaptation
scenarios as discussed in TS 38.401 [4].
In downstream direction, traffic mapping occurs internal to the IAB-donor.
Transport for IAB-donors that use split-gNB architecture is handled in TS
38.401 [4].
### 6.11.3 Routing, BAP Header Rewriting and BH-RLC-channel Mapping on BAP
sublayer
Figure 6.11.3-1: Routing and BH RLC channel selection on BAP sublayer
Routing on BAP sublayer uses the BAP routing ID, which is configured by the
IAB-donor-CU. The BAP routing ID consists of BAP address and BAP path ID. The
BAP address is used for the following purposes:
> 1\. Determination if a packet has reached the destination node, i.e. IAB-
> node or IAB-donor-DU, on BAP sublayer. This is the case if the BAP address
> in the packet\'s BAP header matches the BAP address configured via RRC on
> the IAB-node, or via F1AP on the IAB-donor-DU. For a dual-connected boundary
> IAB-node that is configured with two BAP addresses, the BAP address in the
> packet\'s BAP header is matched with the BAP address configured by the CU of
> the IAB topology, where the packet has been received.
>
> 2\. Determination of the next-hop node for packets that have not reached
> their destination. This applies to packets arriving from a prior hop on BAP
> sublayer or that have been received from IP layer.
For packets arriving from a prior hop or from upper layers, the determination
of the next-hop node is based on a routing configuration provided by the IAB-
donor-CU via F1AP signalling or a default configuration provided by the IAB-
donor-CU via RRC signalling. This F1AP configuration contains the mapping
between the BAP routing ID carried in the packet\'s BAP header and the next-
hop node\'s BAP address.
Table 6.11.3-1: Routing configuration
BAP routing ID Next-hop BAP address
* * *
Derived from BAP packet\'s BAP header Egress BH link to forward packet
The IAB-node resolves the next-hop BAP address to a physical backhaul link.
For this purpose, the IAB-donor-CU provides the IAB-node/IAB-donor-DU with its
child-node\'s BAP address via F1AP, and it provides the IAB-node with its
parent-node\'s BAP address via RRC. For a boundary IAB-node, the routing
configuration also indicates the IAB topology it applies to. The BH link to
the next-hop node and the next-hop BAP address belong to the IAB topology of
the CU that provided the RRC configuration of the BH link to that next-hop
node.
The IAB-node can receive multiple routing configurations with the same
destination BAP address but different BAP path IDs. These routing
configurations may resolve to the same or different egress BH links.
In case the BH link resolved from the routing entry is considered
_unavailable_ for this packet, the IAB-node may perform local rerouting as
defined in TS38.340 [31], i.e., select another BH link by considering only the
packet\'s BAP address or, in some cases, by header rewriting. In this manner,
the packet can be delivered via an alternative path as defined in TS 38.340
[31].
A BH link may be considered _unavailable_ in case the BH link has RLF. A
parent link may be considered _unavailable_ after a BH RLF detection
indication has been received on this parent link and before a subsequent BH
RLF recovery indication has been received on the same parent link. For DL
traffic, a BH link may be considered _unavailable_ for BAP PDUs carrying a
certain BAP routing ID due to congestion derived from flow-control feedback
information related to this BAP routing ID, as defined in TS 38.340 [31].
For a boundary IAB-node, the routing configuration may carry information on
the IAB topology the configuration applies to.
The IAB-node may rewrite the BAP routing ID in the packet\'s BAP header under
the following circumstances:
\- A packet is routed between two IAB topologies via a boundary IAB-node as
defined in TS 38.401[31]. In this case, the BAP routing ID carried by the
received BAP PDU is allocated by the IAB-donor-CU of the ingress IAB topology,
while the BAP routing ID carried by the BAP PDU after header rewriting is
allocated by the IAB-donor-CU of the egress IAB topology.
\- An upstream packet is locally re-routed to a different IAB-donor-DU than
indicated by the BAP address in the BAP header of the received packet. The
rewritten BAP header carries the BAP address of the alternative IAB-donor-DU
and the BAP path ID for a path to this alternative IAB-donor-DU. BAP header
rewriting for upstream inter-IAB-donor-DU local rerouting is only applied if
neither routing nor local re-routing without header rewriting resolve to an
available egress BH link.
For packets that are routed between two IAB topologies via a boundary node,
the BAP header rewriting configuration is provided via F1AP, and it includes
the ingress BAP routing ID, the egress BAP routing ID, and it indicates the
egress IAB topology:
Table 6.11.3-2a: BAP header rewriting configuration
Ingress BAP routing ID Egress BAP routing ID Egress topology indicator
* * *
BAP routing ID carried in the BAP header of the received BAP PDU BAP routing
ID carried in the BAP header of the transmitted BAP PDU Indicates the egress
IAB topology.
For upstream packets that are locally re-routed to a different IAB-donor-DU,
the BAP header is rewritten with a BAP routing ID contained in the routing
entry that was selected for re-routing.
Details of BAP header rewriting are defined in TS 38.340 [31].
When routing a packet from an ingress to an egress BH link, the IAB-node
derives the egress BH RLC channel on the egress BH link through an F1AP-
configured mapping from the BH RLC channel used on the ingress BH link. The BH
RLC channel IDs used for ingress and egress BH RLC channels are generated by
the IAB-donor-CU. Since the BH RLC channel ID only has link-local scope, the
mapping configurations also include the BAP addresses of prior and next hop:
Table 6.11.3-2: BH RLC channel mapping configuration
Next-hop BAP address Prior-hop BAP address Ingress RLC channel ID Egress RLC
channel ID
* * *
Derived from routing configuration Derived from packet\'s ingress BH link
Derived from packet\'s ingress BH RLC channel BH RLC channel on egress BH link
to forward packet
For a boundary IAB-node, the BH RLC channel mapping configuration may also
include indicators for the IAB topology of the ingress and of the egress BH
link.
The IAB-node resolves the BH RLC channel IDs from logical channel IDs based on
the configuration by the IAB-donor-CU. The IAB-MT obtains the BH RLC channel
ID in the RRC configuration of the corresponding logical channel. The IAB-DU
obtains the BH RLC channel ID in the F1AP configuration of the BH RLC channel.
## 6.12 Multiple Transmit/Receive Point Operation
In Multiple Transmit/Receive Point (multi-TRP) operation, a serving cell can
schedule the UE from two TRPs, providing better coverage, reliability and/or
data rates for PDSCH, PDCCH, PUSCH, and PUCCH.
There are two different operation modes to schedule multi-TRP PDSCH
transmissions: single-DCI and multi-DCI. For both modes, control of uplink and
downlink operation can be done by physical layer and MAC layer, within the
configuration provided by the RRC layer. In single-DCI mode, the UE is
scheduled by the same DCI for both TRPs and in multi-DCI mode, the UE is
scheduled by independent DCIs from each TRP.
There are two different operation modes for multi-TRP PDCCH: PDCCH repetition
as in Clause 5.2.3 and SFN based PDCCH transmission. In both modes, the UE can
receive two PDCCH transmissions, one from each TRP, carrying the same DCI. In
PDCCH repetition mode, the UE can receive the two PDCCH transmissions carrying
the same DCI from two linked search spaces each associated with a different
CORESET. In SFN based PDCCH transmission mode, the UE can receive the two
PDCCH transmissions carrying the same DCI from a single search space/CORESET
using different TCI states.
For multi-TRP PUSCH repetition, according to indications in a single DCI or in
a semi-static configured grant provided over RRC, the UE performs PUSCH
transmission of the same contents toward two TRPs with corresponding beam
directions associated with different spatial relations. For multi-TRP PUCCH
repetition, the UE performs PUCCH transmission of the same contents toward two
TRPs with corresponding beam directions associated with different spatial
relations.
For inter-cell multi-TRP operation, for multi-DCI PDSCH transmission, one or
more TCI states can be associated with SSB with a PCI different from the
serving cell PCI. The activated TCI states can be associated with at most one
PCI different from the serving cell PCI at a time.

## 7.3 System Information Handling
### 7.3.1 Overview
System Information (SI) consists of a MIB and a number of SIBs, which are
divided into Minimum SI and Other SI:
\- **Minimum SI** comprises basic information required for initial access and
information for acquiring any other SI. Minimum SI consists of:
\- _MIB_ contains cell barred status information and essential physical layer
information of the cell required to receive further system information, e.g.
CORESET#0 configuration. _MIB_ is periodically broadcast on BCH.
\- _SIB1_ defines the scheduling of other system information blocks and
contains information required for initial access. SIB1 is also referred to as
Remaining Minimum SI (RMSI) and is periodically broadcast on DL-SCH or sent in
a dedicated manner on DL-SCH to UEs in RRC_CONNECTED.
\- **Other SI** encompasses all SIBs not broadcast in the Minimum SI. Those
SIBs can either be periodically broadcast on DL-SCH, broadcast on-demand on
DL-SCH (i.e. upon request from UEs in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE, or
RRC_CONNECTED), or sent in a dedicated manner on DL-SCH to UEs in
RRC_CONNECTED (i.e., upon request, if configured by the network, from UEs in
RRC_CONNECTED or when the UE has an active BWP with no common search space
configured or when the UE configured with inter cell beam management is
receiving DL-SCH from a TRP with PCI different from serving cell\'s PCI).
Other SI consists of:
\- _SIB2_ contains cell re-selection information, mainly related to the
serving cell;
\- _SIB3_ contains information about the serving frequency and intra-frequency
neighbouring cells relevant for cell re-selection (including cell re-selection
parameters common for a frequency as well as cell specific re-selection
parameters);
\- _SIB4_ contains information about other NR frequencies and inter-frequency
neighbouring cells relevant for cell re-selection (including cell re-selection
parameters common for a frequency as well as cell specific re-selection
parameters), which can also be used for NR idle/inactive measurements;
\- _SIB5_ contains information about E-UTRA frequencies and E-UTRA
neighbouring cells relevant for cell re-selection (including cell re-selection
parameters common for a frequency as well as cell specific re-selection
parameters);
\- _SIB6_ contains an ETWS primary notification;
\- _SIB7_ contains an ETWS secondary notification;
\- _SIB8_ contains a CMAS warning notification;
\- _SIB9_ contains information related to GPS time and Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC);
\- _SIB10_ contains the Human-Readable Network Names (HRNN) of the NPNs listed
in SIB1;
\- _SIB11_ contains information related to idle/inactive measurements;
\- _SIB15_ contains information related to disaster roaming;
_\- SIB16_ contains slice-based cell reselection information;
\- _SIB17_ contains information related to TRS configuration for UEs in
RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE;
\- _SIBpos_ contains positioning assistance data as defined in TS 37.355 [43]
and TS 38.331 [12];
\- _SIB18_ contains information related to the Group IDs for Network selection
(GINs) associated with SNPNs listed in SIB1.
For sidelink, Other SI also includes:
\- _SIB12_ contains information related to NR sidelink communication;
\- _SIB13_ contains information related to _SystemInformationBlockType21_ for
V2X sidelink communication as specified in TS 36.331 clause 5.2.2.28 [29];
\- _SIB14_ contains information related to _SystemInformationBlockType26_ for
V2X sidelink communication as specified in TS 36.331 clause 5.2.2.33 [29].
For non-terrestrial network, Other SI also includes:
\- _SIB19_ contains NTN-specific parameters for serving cell and optionally
NTN-specific parameters for neighbour cells as defined in TS 38.331 [12].
For MBS broadcast, Other SI also includes:
\- _SIB20_ contains MCCH configuration;
\- _SIB21_ contains information related to service continuity for MBS
broadcast reception.
Figure 7.3.1-1 below summarises System Information provisioning.
Figure 7.3.1-1: System Information Provisioning
For a cell/frequency that is considered for camping by the UE, the UE is not
required to acquire the contents of the minimum SI of that cell/frequency from
another cell/frequency layer. This does not preclude the case that the UE
applies stored SI from previously visited cell(s).
If the UE cannot determine the full contents of the minimum SI of a cell by
receiving from that cell, the UE shall consider that cell as barred.
In case of BA, the UE only acquires SI on the active BWP.
If the UE is configured with inter cell beam management:
\- the UE is not required to acquire the SI from the serving cell while it is
receiving DL-SCH from a TRP with PCI different from serving cell\'s PCI.
### 7.3.2 Scheduling
The MIB is mapped on the BCCH and carried on BCH while all other SI messages
are mapped on the BCCH, where they are dynamically carried on DL-SCH. The
scheduling of SI messages part of Other SI is indicated by _SIB1_.
For UEs in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is not ongoing (see
clause 18), a request for Other SI triggers a random access procedure (see
clause 9.2.6) where MSG3 includes the SI request message unless the requested
SI is associated to a subset of the PRACH resources, in which case MSG1 is
used for indication of the requested Other SI. When MSG1 is used, the minimum
granularity of the request is one SI message (i.e. a set of SIBs), one RACH
preamble and/or PRACH resource can be used to request multiple SI messages and
the gNB acknowledges the request in MSG2. When MSG 3 is used, the gNB
acknowledges the request in MSG4.
For UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, a request for Other SI may be sent to the network,
if configured by the network, in a dedicated manner (i.e., via UL-DCCH) and
the granularity of the request is one SIB. The gNB may respond with an
_RRCReconfiguration_ including the requested SIB(s). It is a network choice to
decide which requested SIBs are delivered in a dedicated or broadcasted
manner.
The Other SI may be broadcast at a configurable periodicity and for a certain
duration. The Other SI may also be broadcast when it is requested by UE in
RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE/RRC_CONNECTED.
For a UE to be allowed to camp on a cell it must have acquired the contents of
the Minimum SI from that cell. There may be cells in the system that do not
broadcast the Minimum SI and where the UE therefore cannot camp.
### 7.3.3 SI Modification
Change of system information (other than for ETWS/CMAS, see clause 16.4) only
occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the concept of a modification period is
used. System information may be transmitted a number of times with the same
content within a modification period, as defined by its scheduling. The
modification period is configured by system information.
When the network changes (some of the) system information, it first notifies
the UEs about this change, i.e. this may be done throughout a modification
period. In the next modification period, the network transmits the updated
system information. Upon receiving a change notification, the UE acquires the
new system information from the start of the next modification period. The UE
applies the previously acquired system information until the UE acquires the
new system information.
## 7.4 Access Control
NG-RAN supports overload and access control functionality such as RACH back
off, RRC Connection Reject, RRC Connection Release and UE based access barring
mechanisms.
One unified access control framework as specified in TS 22.261 [19] applies to
all UE states (RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED) for NR. NG-RAN
broadcasts barring control information associated with Access Categories and
Access Identities (in case of network sharing, the barring control information
can be set individually for each PLMN). The UE determines whether an access
attempt is authorized based on the barring information broadcast for the
selected PLMN, and the selected Access Category and Access Identity(ies) for
the access attempt:
\- For NAS triggered requests, NAS determines the Access Category and Access
Identity(ies);
\- For AS triggered requests, RRC determines the Access Category while NAS
determines the Access Identity(ies).
The gNB handles access attempts with establishment causes \"emergency\",
\"mps-PriorityAccess\" and \"mcs-PriorityAccess\" (i.e. Emergency calls, MPS,
MCS subscribers) with high priority and responds with RRC Reject to these
access attempts only in extreme network load conditions that may threaten the
gNB stability.
Unified access control does not apply to IAB-MTs.
## 7.5 UE Capability Retrieval framework
The UE reports its UE radio access capabilities which are static at least when
the network requests. The gNB can request what capabilities for the UE to
report based on band information. The UE capability can be represented by a
capability ID, which may be exchanged in NAS signalling over the air and in
network signalling instead of the UE capability structure.
In IAB, it is optional for an IAB-MT to support UE capability Retrieval
framework and the related signalling. In case IAB-MT does not support UE
capability Retrieval framework, IAB-MT capabilities are assumed to be known to
the network by other means, e.g. OAM.
## 7.6 Transport of NAS Messages
NR provides reliable in-sequence delivery of NAS messages over SRBs in RRC,
except at handover where losses or duplication can occur when PDCP is re-
established. In RRC, NAS messages are sent in transparent containers.
Piggybacking of NAS messages can occur in the following scenarios:
\- At bearer establishment/modification/release in the DL;
\- For transferring the initial NAS message during connection setup and
connection resume in the UL.
NOTE: In addition to the integrity protection and ciphering performed by NAS,
NAS messages can also be integrity protected and ciphered by PDCP.
Multiple NAS messages can be sent in a single downlink RRC message during PDU
Session Resource establishment or modification. In this case, the order of the
NAS messages contained in the RRC message shall be in the same order as that
in the corresponding NG-AP message in order to ensure the in-sequence delivery
of NAS messages.
NG-RAN node may trigger the NAS Non Delivery Indication procedure to report
the non-delivery of the non PDU Session related NAS PDU received from the AMF
as specified in TS 38.413 [26].
## 7.7 Carrier Aggregation
When CA is configured, the UE only has one RRC connection with the network. At
RRC connection establishment/re-establishment/handover, one serving cell
provides the NAS mobility information, and at RRC connection re-
establishment/handover, one serving cell provides the security input. This
cell is referred to as the Primary Cell (PCell). Depending on UE capabilities,
Secondary Cells (SCells) can be configured to form together with the PCell a
set of serving cells. The configured set of serving cells for a UE therefore
always consists of one PCell and one or more SCells.
The reconfiguration, addition and removal of SCells can be performed by RRC.
At intra-NR handover and during connection resume from RRC_INACTIVE, the
network can also add, remove, keep, or reconfigure SCells for usage with the
target PCell. When adding a new SCell, dedicated RRC signalling is used for
sending all required system information of the SCell i.e. while in connected
mode, UEs need not acquire broadcast system information directly from the
SCells.
## 7.8 Bandwidth Adaptation
To enable BA on the PCell, the gNB configures the UE with UL and DL BWP(s). To
enable BA on SCells in case of CA, the gNB configures the UE with DL BWP(s) at
least (i.e. there may be none in the UL). For the PCell, the BWP used for
initial access is configured via system information. For the SCell(s), the BWP
used after initial activation is configured via dedicated RRC signalling.
In paired spectrum, DL and UL can switch BWP independently. In unpaired
spectrum, DL and UL switch BWP simultaneously. Switching between configured
BWPs happens by means of RRC signalling, DCI, inactivity timer or upon
initiation of random access. When an inactivity timer is configured for a
serving cell, the expiry of the inactivity timer associated to that cell
switches the active BWP to a default BWP configured by the network. There can
be at most one active BWP per cell, except when the serving cell is configured
with SUL, in which case there can be at most one on each UL carrier.
## 7.9 UE Assistance Information
When configured to do so, the UE can signal the network through
_UEAssistanceInformation:_
_-_ If it prefers an adjustment in the connected mode DRX cycle length, for
the purpose of delay budget reporting;
\- If it is experiencing internal overheating;
\- If it prefers certain DRX parameter values, and/or a reduced maximum number
of secondary component carriers, and/or a reduced maximum aggregated bandwidth
and/or a reduced maximum number of MIMO layers and/or minimum scheduling
offsets K0 and K2 for power saving purpose;
\- If it expects not to send or receive any more data in the near future, and
in this case, it can provide its preference to transition out of RRC_CONNECTED
where this indication may express its preferred RRC state, or alternately, it
may cancel an earlier indicated preference to transition out of RRC_CONNECTED;
\- If it prefers (not) to be provisioned with reference time information;
\- If it prefers to transition out of RRC_CONNECTED state for MUSIM operation
and its preferred RRC state after transition;
\- If it wants to include assistance information for setup or release of gaps
for MUSIM operation;
\- The list of frequencies affected by IDC problems (see clause 23.4 of TS
36.300 [2]);
\- Its RRM measurement relaxation status indicating whether RRM measurement
relaxation criteria are met or not;
\- Its RLM measurement relaxation status indicating whether the UE is applying
RLM measurements relaxation;
\- Its BFD measurement relaxation status indicating whether the UE is applying
BFD measurements relaxation.
NOTE: Only the Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) solution as defined for
E-UTRA in clause 23.4 of TS 36.300 [2] is used in NR. The requirements on
RRM/RLM/CSI measurements in different phases of IDC interference defined in TS
36.300 [2] are applicable except that for NR serving cell, the requirements in
TS 38.133 [13] and TS 38.101-1 [18], TS 38.101-2 [35], TS 38.101-3 [36] apply.
In the second case, the UE can express a preference for _temporarily reducing
the number of maximum secondary component carriers, the maximum aggregated
bandwidth and the number of maximum MIMO layers. In_ all _cases,_ it is up to
the gNB whether to accommodate the request.
For sidelink, the UE can report SL traffic pattern(s) to NG-RAN, for periodic
traffic.
## 7.10 Segmentation of RRC messages
An RRC message may be segmented in case the size of the encoded RRC message
PDU exceeds the maximum PDCP SDU size. Segmentation is performed in the RRC
layer using a separate RRC PDU to carry each segment. The receiver reassembles
the segments to form the complete RRC message. All segments of an RRC message
are transmitted before sending another RRC message. Segmentation is supported
in both uplink and downlink as specified in TS 38.331 [12].

## 8.2 Network Identities
The following identities are used in NG-RAN for identifying a specific network
entity:
\- AMF Name: used to identify an AMF.
\- NR Cell Global Identifier (NCGI): used to identify NR cells globally. The
NCGI is constructed from the PLMN identity the cell belongs to and the NR Cell
Identity (NCI) of the cell. The PLMN ID included in the NCGI should be the
first PLMN ID within the set of PLMN IDs associated to the NR Cell Identity in

versions to enable that a NG-RAN node can select either IPv4 or IPv6.
## 8.4 NR sidelink communication and V2X sidelink communication related
identities
The following identities are used for NR sidelink communication:
\- Source Layer-2 ID: Identifies the sender of the data in NR sidelink
communication. The Source Layer-2 ID is 24 bits long and is split in the MAC
layer into two bit strings:
\- One bit string is the LSB part (8 bits) of Source Layer-2 ID and forwarded
to physical layer of the sender. This identifies the source of the intended
data in sidelink control information and is used for filtering of packets at
the physical layer of the receiver;
\- Second bit string is the MSB part (16 bits) of the Source Layer-2 ID and is
carried within the MAC header. This is used for filtering of packets at the
MAC layer of the receiver.
\- Destination Layer-2 ID: Identifies the target of the data in NR sidelink
communication. For NR sidelink communication, the Destination Layer-2 ID is 24
bits long and is split in the MAC layer into two bit strings:
\- One bit string is the LSB part (16 bits) of Destination Layer-2 ID and
forwarded to physical layer of the sender. This identifies the target of the
intended data in sidelink control information and is used for filtering of
packets at the physical layer of the receiver;
\- Second bit string is the MSB part (8 bits) of the Destination Layer-2 ID
and is carried within the MAC header. This is used for filtering of packets at
the MAC layer of the receiver.
\- PC5 Link Identifier: Uniquely identifies the PC5 unicast link in a UE for
the lifetime of the PC5 unicast link as specified in TS 23.287 [40]. The PC5
Link Identifier is used to indicate to upper layers the PC5 unicast link in
which sidelink RLF was declared and corresponding PC5-RRC connection was
released.
V2X sidelink communication related identities are specified in clause 8.3 of
TS 36.300 [2].
# 9 Mobility and State Transitions
## 9.1 Overview
Load balancing is achieved in NR with handover, redirection mechanisms upon
RRC release and through the usage of inter-frequency and inter-RAT absolute
priorities and inter-frequency Qoffset parameters.
Measurements to be performed by a UE for connected mode mobility are
classified in at least four measurement types:
\- Intra-frequency NR measurements;
\- Inter-frequency NR measurements;
\- Inter-RAT measurements for E-UTRA;
\- Inter-RAT measurements for UTRA.
For each measurement type one or several measurement objects can be defined (a
measurement object defines e.g. the carrier frequency to be monitored).
For each measurement object one or several reporting configurations can be
defined (a reporting configuration defines the reporting criteria). Three
reporting criteria are used: event triggered reporting, periodic reporting and
event triggered periodic reporting.
The association between a measurement object and a reporting configuration is
created by a measurement identity (a measurement identity links together one
measurement object and one reporting configuration of the same RAT). By using
several measurement identities (one for each measurement object, reporting
configuration pair) it is then possible to:
\- Associate several reporting configurations to one measurement object and;
\- Associate one reporting configuration to several measurement objects.
The measurements identity is used as well when reporting results of the
measurements.
Measurement quantities are considered separately for each RAT.
Measurement commands are used by NG-RAN to order the UE to start, modify or
stop measurements.
Handover can be performed within the same RAT and/or CN, or it can involve a
change of the RAT and/or CN.
Inter system fallback towards E-UTRAN is performed when 5GC does not support
emergency services, voice services, for load balancing etc. Depending on
factors such as CN interface availability, network configuration and radio
conditions, the fallback procedure results in either RRC_CONNECTED state
mobility (handover procedure) or RRC_IDLE state mobility (redirection), see TS
23.501 [3] and TS 38.331 [12].
SRVCC from 5G to UTRAN, if supported by both the UE and the network, may be
performed to handover a UE with an ongoing voice call from NR to UTRAN. The
overall procedure is described in TS 23.216 [34]. See also TS 38.331 [12] and
TS 38.413 [26].
In the NG-C signalling procedure, the AMF based on support for emergency
services, voice service, any other services or for load balancing etc, may
indicate the target CN type as EPC or 5GC to the gNB node. When the target CN
type is received by gNB, the target CN type is also conveyed to the UE in
_RRCRelease_ Message.
Inter-gNB CSI-RS based mobility, i.e. handover, is supported between two
neighbour gNBs by enabling that neighbour gNBs can exchange and forward their
own CSI-RS configurations and on/off status.
## 9.2 Intra-NR
### 9.2.1 Mobility in RRC_IDLE
#### 9.2.1.1 Cell Selection
The principles of PLMN selection in NR are based on the 3GPP PLMN selection
principles. Cell selection is required on transition from RM-DEREGISTERED to
RM-REGISTERED, from CM-IDLE to CM-CONNECTED and from CM-CONNECTED to CM-IDLE
and is based on the following principles:
\- The UE NAS layer identifies a selected PLMN and equivalent PLMNs;
\- Cell selection is always based on CD-SSBs located on the synchronization
raster (see clause 5.2.4):
\- The UE searches the NR frequency bands and for each carrier frequency
identifies the strongest cell as per the CD-SSB. It then reads cell system
information broadcast to identify its PLMN(s):
\- The UE may search each carrier in turn (\"initial cell selection\") or make
use of stored information to shorten the search (\"stored information cell
selection\").
\- The UE seeks to identify a suitable cell; if it is not able to identify a
suitable cell it seeks to identify an acceptable cell. When a suitable cell is
found or if only an acceptable cell is found it camps on that cell and
commence the cell reselection procedure:
\- A suitable cell is one for which the measured cell attributes satisfy the
cell selection criteria; the cell PLMN is the selected PLMN, registered or an
equivalent PLMN; the cell is not barred or reserved and the cell is not part
of a tracking area which is in the list of \"forbidden tracking areas for
roaming\";
\- An acceptable cell is one for which the measured cell attributes satisfy
the cell selection criteria and the cell is not barred.
\- The IAB-MT applies the cell selection procedure as described for the UE
with the following differences:
> \- The IAB-MT ignores cell-barring or cell-reservation indications contained
> in cell system information broadcast;
>
> \- The IAB-MT only considers a cell as a candidate for cell selection if the
> cell system information broadcast indicates IAB support for the selected
> PLMN or the selected SNPN.
Transition to RRC_IDLE:
On transition from RRC_CONNECTED or RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_IDLE, a UE should camp
on a cell as result of cell selection according to the frequency be assigned
by RRC in the state transition message if any.
Recovery from out of coverage:
The UE should attempt to find a suitable cell in the manner described for
stored information or initial cell selection above. If no suitable cell is
found on any frequency or RAT, the UE should attempt to find an acceptable
cell.
In multi-beam operations, the cell quality is derived amongst the beams
corresponding to the same cell (see clause 9.2.4).
#### 9.2.1.2 Cell Reselection
A UE in RRC_IDLE performs cell reselection. The principles of the procedure
are the following:
\- Cell reselection is always based on CD-SSBs located on the synchronization
raster (see clause 5.2.4).
\- The UE makes measurements of attributes of the serving and neighbour cells
to enable the reselection process:
\- For the search and measurement of inter-frequency neighbouring cells, only
the carrier frequencies need to be indicated.
\- Cell reselection identifies the cell that the UE should camp on. It is
based on cell reselection criteria which involves measurements of the serving
and neighbour cells:
\- Intra-frequency reselection is based on ranking of cells;
\- Inter-frequency reselection is based on absolute priorities where a UE
tries to camp on the highest priority frequency available;
\- A Neighbour Cell List (NCL) can be provided by the serving cell to handle
specific cases for intra- and inter-frequency neighbouring cells;
\- Exclude-lists can be provided to prevent the UE from reselecting to
specific intra- and inter-frequency neighbouring cells;
\- Allow-lists can be provided to request the UE to reselect to only specific
intra- and inter-frequency neighbouring cells;
\- Cell reselection can be speed dependent;
\- Service specific prioritisation;
\- Slice-based cell reselection information can be provided to facilitate the
UE to reselect a cell that supports specific slices.
In multi-beam operations, the cell quality is derived amongst the beams
corresponding to the same cell (see clause 9.2.4).
#### 9.2.1.3 State Transitions
The following figure describes the UE triggered transition from RRC_IDLE to
RRC_CONNECTED (for the NAS part, see TS 23.502 [22]):
Figure 9.2.1.3-1: UE triggered transition from RRC_IDLE to RRC_CONNECTED
1\. The UE requests to setup a new connection from RRC_IDLE.
2/2a. The gNB completes the RRC setup procedure.
NOTE: The scenario where the gNB rejects the request is described below.
3\. The first NAS message from the UE, piggybacked in _RRCSetupComplete_ , is
sent to AMF.
4/4a/5/5a. Additional NAS messages may be exchanged between UE and AMF, see TS
23.502 [22].
6\. The AMF prepares the UE context data (including PDU session context, the
Security Key, UE Radio Capability and UE Security Capabilities, etc.) and
sends it to the gNB.
7/7a. The gNB activates the AS security with the UE.
8/8a. The gNB performs the reconfiguration to setup SRB2 and DRBs for UE, or
SRB2 and optionally DRBs for IAB-MT.
9\. The gNB informs the AMF that the setup procedure is completed.
NOTE 1: RRC messages in step 1 and 2 use SRB0, all the subsequent messages use
SRB1. Messages in steps 7/7a are integrity protected. From step 8 on, all the
messages are integrity protected and ciphered.
NOTE 2: For signalling only connection, step 8 is skipped since SRB2 and DRBs
are not setup.
The following figure describes the rejection from the network when the UE
attempts to setup a connection from RRC_IDLE:
Figure 9.2.1.3-2: Rejection of UE triggered transition from RRC_IDLE
1\. UE attempts to setup a new connection from RRC_IDLE.
2\. The gNB is not able to handle the procedure, for instance due to
congestion.
3\. The gNB sends _RRCReject_ (with a wait time) to keep the UE in RRC_IDLE.
### 9.2.2 Mobility in RRC_INACTIVE
#### 9.2.2.1 Overview
RRC_INACTIVE is a state where a UE remains in CM-CONNECTED and can move within
an area configured by NG-RAN (the RNA) without notifying NG-RAN. In
RRC_INACTIVE, the last serving gNB node keeps the UE context and the UE-
associated NG connection with the serving AMF and UPF.
If the last serving gNB receives DL data from the UPF or DL UE-associated
signalling from the AMF (except the UE Context Release Command message) while
the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE, it pages in the cells corresponding to the RNA and
may send XnAP RAN Paging to neighbour gNB(s) if the RNA includes cells of
neighbour gNB(s).
Upon receiving the UE Context Release Command message while the UE is in
RRC_INACTIVE, the last serving gNB may page in the cells corresponding to the
RNA and may send XnAP RAN Paging to neighbour gNB(s) if the RNA includes cells
of neighbour gNB(s), in order to release UE explicitly.
Upon receiving the NG RESET message while the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE, the last
serving gNB may page involved UEs in the cells corresponding to the RNA and
may send XnAP RAN Paging to neighbour gNB(s) if the RNA includes cells of
neighbour gNB(s) in order to explicitly release involved UEs.
Upon RAN paging failure, the gNB behaves according to TS 23.501 [3].
The AMF provides to the NG-RAN node the Core Network Assistance Information to
assist the NG-RAN node\'s decision whether the UE can be sent to RRC_INACTIVE,
and to assist UE configuration and paging in RRC_INACTIVE. The Core Network
Assistance Information includes the registration area configured for the UE,
the Periodic Registration Update timer, and the UE Identity Index value, and
may include the UE specific DRX, an indication if the UE is configured with
Mobile Initiated Connection Only (MICO) mode by the AMF, the Expected UE
Behaviour, the UE Radio Capability for Paging, the PEI with Paging Subgrouping
assistance information, the NR Paging eDRX Information, the Paging Cause
Indication for Voice Service and the Hashed UE Identity Index Value. The UE
registration area is taken into account by the NG-RAN node when configuring
the RNA. The UE specific DRX and UE Identity Index value are used by the NG-
RAN node for RAN paging. The Periodic Registration Update timer is taken into
account by the NG-RAN node to configure Periodic RNA Update timer. The NG-RAN
node takes into account the Expected UE Behaviour to assist the UE RRC state
transition decision. The NG-RAN node may use the UE Radio Capability for
Paging during RAN Paging. The NG-RAN node takes into account the PEI with
Paging Subgrouping assistance information for subgroup paging in RRC_INACTIVE.
When sending the XnAP RAN Paging to neighbour NG-RAN node(s), the PEI with
Paging Subgrouping assistance information may be included. The NG-RAN node
takes into account the NR Paging eDRX Information to configure the RAN Paging
when the NR UE is in RRC_INACTIVE. When sending XnAP RAN Paging to neighbour
NG-RAN node(s), the NR Paging eDRX Information for RRC_IDLE and for
RRC_INACTIVE may be included. The NG-RAN node takes into consideration the
Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service to include the Paging Cause in RAN
Paging for a UE in RRC_INACTIVE state. When sending XnAP RAN Paging to
neighbour NG-RAN node(s), the Paging Cause may be included. When sending XnAP
RAN Paging to neighbour NG-RAN node(s), the Hashed UE Identity Index Value may
be included to determine the start point of PTW.
At transition to RRC_INACTIVE the NG-RAN node may configure the UE with a
periodic RNA Update timer value. At periodic RNA Update timer expiry without
notification from the UE, the gNB behaves as specified in TS 23.501 [3].
If the UE accesses a gNB other than the last serving gNB, the receiving gNB
triggers the XnAP Retrieve UE Context procedure to get the UE context from the
last serving gNB and may also trigger an Xn-U Address Indication procedure
including tunnel information for potential recovery of data from the last
serving gNB. Upon successful UE context retrieval, the receiving gNB shall
perform the slice-aware admission control in case of receiving slice
information and becomes the serving gNB and it further triggers the NGAP Path
Switch Request and applicable RRC procedures. After the path switch procedure,
the serving gNB triggers release of the UE context at the last serving gNB by
means of the XnAP UE Context Release procedure.
In case the UE is not reachable at the last serving gNB, the gNB shall fail
any AMF initiated UE-associated class 1 procedure which allows the signalling
of unsuccessful operation in the respective response message. It may trigger
the NAS Non Delivery Indication procedure to report the non-delivery of any
non PDU Session related NAS PDU received from the AMF as specified in TS
38.413 [26].
If the UE accesses a gNB other than the last serving gNB and the receiving gNB
does not find a valid UE Context, the receiving gNB can perform establishment
of a new RRC connection instead of resumption of the previous RRC connection.
UE context retrieval will also fail and hence a new RRC connection needs to be
established if the serving AMF changes.
A UE in the RRC_INACTIVE state is required to initiate RNA update procedure
when it moves out of the configured RNA. When receiving RNA update request
from the UE, the receiving gNB triggers the XnAP Retrieve UE Context procedure
to get the UE context from the last serving gNB and may decide to send the UE
back to RRC_INACTIVE state, move the UE into RRC_CONNECTED state, or send the
UE to RRC_IDLE. In case of periodic RNA update, if the last serving gNB
decides not to relocate the UE context, it fails the Retrieve UE Context
procedure and sends the UE back to RRC_INACTIVE, or to RRC_IDLE directly by an
encapsulated _RRCRelease_ message.
#### 9.2.2.2 Cell Reselection
A UE in RRC_INACTIVE performs cell reselection. The principles of the
procedure are as for the RRC_IDLE state (see clause 9.2.1.2).
#### 9.2.2.3 RAN-Based Notification Area
A UE in the RRC_INACTIVE state can be configured by the last serving NG-RAN
node with an RNA, where:
\- the RNA can cover a single or multiple cells, and shall be contained within
the CN registration area; in this release Xn connectivity should be available
within the RNA;
\- a RAN-based notification area update (RNAU) is periodically sent by the UE
and is also sent when the cell reselection procedure of the UE selects a cell
that does not belong to the configured RNA.
There are several different alternatives on how the RNA can be configured:
\- List of cells:
\- A UE is provided an explicit list of cells (one or more) that constitute
the RNA.
\- List of RAN areas:
\- A UE is provided (at least one) RAN area ID, where a RAN area is a subset
of a CN Tracking Area or equal to a CN Tracking Area. A RAN area is specified
by one RAN area ID, which consists of a TAC and optionally a RAN area Code;
\- A cell broadcasts one or, in case of network sharing with multiple cell ID
broadcast, more RAN area IDs in the system information.
NG-RAN may provide different RNA definitions to different UEs but not mix
different definitions to the same UE at the same time. UE shall support all
RNA configuration options listed above.
#### 9.2.2.4 State Transitions
##### 9.2.2.4.1 UE triggered transition from RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_CONNECTED
The following figure describes the UE triggered transition from RRC_INACTIVE
to RRC_CONNECTED in case of UE context retrieval success:
Figure 9.2.2.4.1-1: UE triggered transition from RRC_INACTIVE to
RRC_CONNECTED\ (UE context retrieval success)
1\. The UE resumes from RRC_INACTIVE, providing the I-RNTI, allocated by the
last serving gNB.
2\. The gNB, if able to resolve the gNB identity contained in the I-RNTI,
requests the last serving gNB to provide UE Context data.
3\. The last serving gNB provides UE context data.
4/5. The gNB and UE completes the resumption of the RRC connection.
NOTE: User Data can also be sent in step 5 if the grant allows.
6\. If loss of DL user data buffered in the last serving gNB shall be
prevented, the gNB provides forwarding addresses.
7/8. The gNB performs path switch.
9\. The gNB triggers the release of the UE resources at the last serving gNB.
After step 1 above, when the gNB decides to use a single RRC message to reject
the Resume Request right away and keep the UE in RRC_INACTIVE without any
reconfiguration (e.g. as described in the two examples below), or when the gNB
decides to setup a new RRC connection, SRB0 (without security) is used.
Conversely, when the gNB decides to reconfigure the UE (e.g. with a new DRX
cycle or RNA) or when the gNB decides to push the UE to RRC_IDLE, SRB1 (with
integrity protection and ciphering as previously configured for that SRB)
shall be used.
NOTE: SRB1 can only be used once the UE Context is retrieved i.e. after step
3.
The following figure describes the UE triggered transition from RRC_INACTIVE
to RRC_CONNECTED in case of UE context retrieval failure:
Figure 9.2.2.4.1-2: UE triggered transition from RRC_INACTIVE to
RRC_CONNECTED\ (UE context retrieval failure)
1\. The UE resumes from RRC_INACTIVE, providing the I-RNTI, allocated by the
last serving gNB.
2\. The gNB, if able to resolve the gNB identity contained in the I-RNTI,
requests the last serving gNB to provide UE Context data.

if the UE is still within the previously configured RNA, to keep the UE
context in the last serving gNB and to keep the UE in RRC_INACTIVE (and the
procedure follows steps 3 and later of figure 9.2.2.5-2).

prevented, the gNB provides forwarding addresses.
6./7. The gNB performs path switch.
8\. The gNB keeps the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state by sending _RRCRelease_ with
suspend indication, including redirection information (frequency layer the UE

### 9.2.3 Mobility in RRC_CONNECTED
#### 9.2.3.1 Overview
Network controlled mobility applies to UEs in RRC_CONNECTED and is categorized
into two types of mobility: cell level mobility and beam level mobility. Beam
level mobility includes intra-cell beam level mobility and inter-cell beam
level mobility.
**Cell Level Mobility** requires explicit RRC signalling to be triggered, i.e.
handover. For inter-gNB handover, the signalling procedures consist of at
least the following elemental components illustrated in Figure 9.2.3.1-1:
Figure 9.2.3.1-1: Inter-gNB handover procedures
1\. The source gNB initiates handover and issues a HANDOVER REQUEST over the
Xn interface.
2\. The target gNB performs admission control and provides the new RRC
configuration as part of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE.
3\. The source gNB provides the RRC configuration to the UE by forwarding the
_RRCReconfiguration_ message received in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE. The
_RRCReconfiguration_ message includes at least cell ID and all information
required to access the target cell so that the UE can access the target cell
without reading system information. For some cases, the information required
for contention-based and contention-free random access can be included in the
_RRCReconfiguration_ message. The access information to the target cell may
include beam specific information, if any.
4\. The UE moves the RRC connection to the target gNB and replies with the
_RRCReconfigurationComplete_.
NOTE 1: User Data can also be sent in step 4 if the grant allows.
In case of DAPS handover, the UE continues the downlink user data reception
from the source gNB until releasing the source cell and continues the uplink
user data transmission to the source gNB until successful random access
procedure to the target gNB.
Only source and target PCell are used during DAPS handover. CA, DC, SUL,
multi-TRP, EHC, CHO, UDC, NR sidelink configurations and V2X sidelink
configurations are released by the source gNB before the handover command is
sent to the UE and are not configured by the target gNB until the DAPS
handover has completed (i.e. at earliest in the same message that releases the
source PCell).
The handover mechanism triggered by RRC requires the UE at least to reset the
MAC entity and re-establish RLC, except for DAPS handover, where upon
reception of the handover command, the UE:
\- Creates a MAC entity for target;
\- Establishes the RLC entity and an associated DTCH logical channel for
target for each DRB configured with DAPS;
\- For each DRB configured with DAPS, reconfigures the PDCP entity with
separate security and ROHC functions for source and target and associates them
with the RLC entities configured by source and target respectively;
\- Retains the rest of the source configurations until release of the source.
NOTE 2: Void.
NOTE 3: Void.
RRC managed handovers with and without PDCP entity re-establishment are both
supported. For DRBs using RLC AM mode, PDCP can either be re-established
together with a security key change or initiate a data recovery procedure
without a key change. For DRBs using RLC UM mode, PDCP can either be re-
established together with a security key change or remain as it is without a
key change. For SRBs, PDCP can either remain as it is, discard its stored PDCP
PDUs/SDUs without a key change or be re-established together with a security
key change.
Data forwarding, in-sequence delivery and duplication avoidance at handover
can be guaranteed when the target gNB uses the same DRB configuration as the
source gNB.
Timer based handover failure procedure is supported in NR. RRC connection re-
establishment procedure is used for recovering from handover failure except in
certain CHO or DAPS handover scenarios:
\- When DAPS handover fails, the UE falls back to the source cell
configuration, resumes the connection with the source cell, and reports DAPS
handover failure via the source without triggering RRC connection re-
establishment if the source link has not been released.
\- When initial CHO execution attempt fails or HO fails, the UE performs cell
selection, and if the selected cell is a CHO candidate and if network
configured the UE to try CHO after handover/CHO failure, then the UE attempts
CHO execution once, otherwise re-establishment is performed.
DAPS handover for FR2 to FR2 case is not supported in this release of the
specification.
The handover of the IAB-MT in SA mode follows the same procedure as described
for the UE. After the backhaul has been established, the handover of the IAB-
MT is part of the intra-CU topology adaptation procedure defined in TS 38.401
[4]. Modifications to the configuration of BAP sublayer and higher protocol
layers above the BAP sublayer are described in TS 38.401 [4].
**Beam Level Mobility** does not require explicit RRC signalling to be
triggered. Beam level mobility can be within a cell, or between cells, the
latter is referred to as inter-cell beam management (ICBM). For ICBM, a UE can
receive or transmit UE dedicated channels/signals via a TRP associated with a
PCI different from the PCI of a serving cell, while non-UE-dedicated
channels/signals can only be received via a TRP associated with a PCI of the
serving cell. The gNB provides via RRC signalling the UE with measurement
configuration containing configurations of SSB/CSI resources and resource
sets, reports and trigger states for triggering channel and interference
measurements and reports. In case of ICBM, a measurement configuration
includes SSB resources associated with PCIs different from the PCI of a
serving cell. Beam Level Mobility is then dealt with at lower layers by means
of physical layer and MAC layer control signalling, and RRC is not required to
know which beam is being used at a given point in time.
SSB-based Beam Level Mobility is based on the SSB associated to the initial DL
BWP and can only be configured for the initial DL BWPs and for DL BWPs
containing the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP. For other DL BWPs, Beam
Level Mobility can only be performed based on CSI-RS.
#### 9.2.3.2 Handover
##### 9.2.3.2.1 C-Plane Handling
The intra-NR RAN handover performs the preparation and execution phase of the
handover procedure performed without involvement of the 5GC, i.e. preparation
messages are directly exchanged between the gNBs. The release of the resources
at the source gNB during the handover completion phase is triggered by the
target gNB. The figure below depicts the basic handover scenario where neither
the AMF nor the UPF changes:
Figure 9.2.3.2.1-1: Intra-AMF/UPF Handover
0\. The UE context within the source gNB contains information regarding
roaming and access restrictions which were provided either at connection
establishment or at the last TA update.
1\. The source gNB configures the UE measurement procedures and the UE reports
according to the measurement configuration.
2\. The source gNB decides to handover the UE, based on _MeasurementReport_
and RRM information.
3\. The source gNB issues a Handover Request message to the target gNB passing
a transparent RRC container with necessary information to prepare the handover
at the target side. The information includes at least the target cell ID,
KgNB*, the C-RNTI of the UE in the source gNB, RRM-configuration including UE
inactive time, basic AS-configuration including _antenna Info and DL Carrier
Frequency_ , the current QoS flow to DRB mapping rules applied to the UE, the
SIB1 information from source gNB, the UE capabilities for different RATs, PDU
session related information, and can include the UE reported measurement
information including beam-related information if available. The PDU session
related information includes the slice information and QoS flow level QoS
profile(s). The source gNB may also request a DAPS handover for one or more
DRBs.
NOTE 1: After issuing a Handover Request, the source gNB should not
reconfigure the UE, including performing Reflective QoS flow to DRB mapping.
4\. Admission Control may be performed by the target gNB. Slice-aware
admission control shall be performed if the slice information is sent to the
target gNB. If the PDU sessions are associated with non-supported slices the
target gNB shall reject such PDU Sessions.
5\. The target gNB prepares the handover with L1/L2 and sends the HANDOVER
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE to the source gNB, which includes a transparent container
to be sent to the UE as an RRC message to perform the handover. The target gNB
also indicates if a DAPS handover is accepted.
NOTE 2: As soon as the source gNB receives the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE,
or as soon as the transmission of the handover command is initiated in the
downlink, data forwarding may be initiated.
> NOTE 3: For DRBs configured with DAPS, downlink PDCP SDUs are forwarded with
> SN assigned by the source gNB, until SN assignment is handed over to the
> target gNB in step 8b, for which the normal data forwarding follows as
> defined in 9.2.3.2.3.
6\. The source gNB triggers the Uu handover by sending an _RRCReconfiguration_
message to the UE, containing the information required to access the target
cell: at least the target cell ID, the new C-RNTI, the target gNB security
algorithm identifiers for the selected security algorithms. It can also
include a set of dedicated RACH resources, the association between RACH
resources and SSB(s), the association between RACH resources and UE-specific
CSI-RS configuration(s), common RACH resources, and system information of the
target cell, etc.
NOTE 4: For DRBs configured with DAPS, the source gNB does not stop
transmitting downlink packets until it receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message
from the target gNB in step 8a.
NOTE 4a: CHO cannot be configured simultaneously with DAPS handover.
7a. For DRBs configured with DAPS, the source gNB sends the EARLY STATUS
TRANSFER message. The DL COUNT value conveyed in the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER
message indicates PDCP SN and HFN of the first PDCP SDU that the source gNB
forwards to the target gNB. The source gNB does not stop assigning SNs to
downlink PDCP SDUs until it sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the target
gNB in step 8b.
7\. For DRBs not configured with DAPS, the source gNB sends the SN STATUS
TRANSFER message to the target gNB to convey the uplink PDCP SN receiver
status and the downlink PDCP SN transmitter status of DRBs for which PDCP
status preservation applies (i.e. for RLC AM). The uplink PDCP SN receiver
status includes at least the PDCP SN of the first missing UL PDCP SDU and may
include a bit map of the receive status of the out of sequence UL PDCP SDUs
that the UE needs to retransmit in the target cell, if any. The downlink PDCP
SN transmitter status indicates the next PDCP SN that the target gNB shall
assign to new PDCP SDUs, not having a PDCP SN yet.
NOTE 5: In case of DAPS handover, the uplink PDCP SN receiver status and the
downlink PDCP SN transmitter status for a DRB with RLC-AM and not configured
with DAPS may be transferred by the SN STATUS TRANSFER message in step 8b
instead of step 7.
NOTE 6: For DRBs configured with DAPS, the source gNB may additionally send
the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message(s) between step 7 and step 8b, to inform
discarding of already forwarded PDCP SDUs. The target gNB does not transmit
forwarded downlink PDCP SDUs to the UE, whose COUNT is less than the conveyed
DL COUNT value and discards them if transmission has not been attempted
already.
8\. The UE synchronises to the target cell and completes the RRC handover
procedure by sending _RRCReconfigurationComplete_ message to target gNB. In
case of DAPS handover, the UE does not detach from the source cell upon
receiving the _RRCReconfiguration_ message. The UE releases the source
resources and configurations and stops DL/UL reception/transmission with the
source upon receiving an explicit release from the target node.
NOTE 6a: From RAN point of view, the DAPS handover is considered to only be
completed after the UE has released the source cell as explicitly requested
from the target node. RRC suspend, a subsequent handover or inter-RAT handover
cannot be initiated until the source cell has been released.
8a/b In case of DAPS handover, the target gNB sends the HANDOVER SUCCESS
message to the source gNB to inform that the UE has successfully accessed the
target cell. In return, the source gNB sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message
for DRBs configured with DAPS for which the description in step 7 applies, and
the normal data forwarding follows as defined in 9.2.3.2.3.
NOTE 7: The uplink PDCP SN receiver status and the downlink PDCP SN
transmitter status are also conveyed for DRBs with RLC-UM in the SN STATUS
TRANSFER message in step 8b, if configured with DAPS.
NOTE 8: For DRBs configured with DAPS, the source gNB does not stop delivering
uplink QoS flows to the UPF until it sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message in
step 8b. The target gNB does not forward QoS flows of the uplink PDCP SDUs
successfully received in-sequence to the UPF until it receives the SN STATUS
TRANSFER message, in which UL HFN and the first missing SN in the uplink PDCP
SN receiver status indicates the start of uplink PDCP SDUs to be delivered to
the UPF. The target gNB does not deliver any uplink PDCP SDUs which has an UL
COUNT lower than the provided.
NOTE 9: Void.
9\. The target gNB sends a PATH SWITCH REQUEST message to AMF to trigger 5GC
to switch the DL data path towards the target gNB and to establish an NG-C
interface instance towards the target gNB.
10\. 5GC switches the DL data path towards the target gNB. The UPF sends one
or more \"end marker\" packets on the old path to the source gNB per PDU
session/tunnel and then can release any U-plane/TNL resources towards the
source gNB.
11\. The AMF confirms the PATH SWITCH REQUEST message with the PATH SWITCH
REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.
12\. Upon reception of the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message from the
AMF, the target gNB sends the UE CONTEXT RELEASE to inform the source gNB
about the success of the handover. The source gNB can then release radio and
C-plane related resources associated to the UE context. Any ongoing data
forwarding may continue.
The RRM configuration can include both beam measurement information (for layer
3 mobility) associated to SSB(s) and CSI-RS(s) for the reported cell(s) if
both types of measurements are available. Also, if CA is configured, the RRM
configuration can include the list of best cells on each frequency for which
measurement information is available. And the RRM measurement information can
also include the beam measurement for the listed cells that belong to the
target gNB.
The common RACH configuration for beams in the target cell is only associated
to the SSB(s). The network can have dedicated RACH configurations associated
to the SSB(s) and/or have dedicated RACH configurations associated to CSI-
RS(s) within a cell. The target gNB can only include one of the following RACH
configurations in the Handover Command to enable the UE to access the target
cell:
i) Common RACH configuration;
ii) Common RACH configuration + Dedicated RACH configuration associated with
SSB;
iii) Common RACH configuration + Dedicated RACH configuration associated with
CSI-RS.
The dedicated RACH configuration allocates RACH resource(s) together with a
quality threshold to use them. When dedicated RACH resources are provided,
they are prioritized by the UE and the UE shall not switch to contention-based
RACH resources as long as the quality threshold of those dedicated resources
is met. The order to access the dedicated RACH resources is up to UE
implementation.
Upon receiving a handover command requesting DAPS handover, the UE suspends
source cell SRBs, stops sending and receiving any RRC control plane signalling
toward the source cell, and establishes SRBs for the target cell. The UE
releases the source cell SRBs configuration upon receiving source cell release
indication from the target cell after successful DAPS handover execution. When
DAPS handover to the target cell fails and if the source cell link is
available, then the UE reverts back to the source cell configuration and
resumes source cell SRBs for control plane signalling transmission.
##### 9.2.3.2.2 U-Plane Handling
The U-plane handling during the Intra-NR-Access mobility activity for UEs in
RRC_CONNECTED takes the following principles into account to avoid data loss
during HO:
\- During HO preparation, U-plane tunnels can be established between the
source gNB and the target gNB;
\- During HO execution, user data can be forwarded from the source gNB to the
target gNB;
\- Forwarding should take place in order as long as packets are received at
the source gNB from the UPF or the source gNB buffer has not been emptied.
\- During HO completion:
\- The target gNB sends a path switch request message to the AMF to inform
that the UE has gained access and the AMF then triggers path switch related
5GC internal signalling and actual path switch of the source gNB to the target
gNB in UPF;
\- The source gNB should continue forwarding data as long as packets are
received at the source gNB from the UPF or the source gNB buffer has not been
emptied.
**For RLC-AM bearers** :
\- For in-sequence delivery and duplication avoidance, PDCP SN is maintained
on a per DRB basis and the source gNB informs the target gNB about the next DL
PDCP SN to allocate to a packet which does not have a PDCP sequence number yet
(either from source gNB or from the UPF).
\- For security synchronisation, HFN is also maintained and the source gNB
provides to the target one reference HFN for the UL and one for the DL i.e.
HFN and corresponding SN.
\- In both the UE and the target gNB, a window-based mechanism is used for
duplication detection and reordering.
\- The occurrence of duplicates over the air interface in the target gNB is
minimised by means of PDCP SN based reporting at the target gNB by the UE. In
uplink, the reporting is optionally configured on a per DRB basis by the gNB
and the UE should first start by transmitting those reports when granted
resources are in the target gNB. In downlink, the gNB is free to decide when
and for which bearers a report is sent and the UE does not wait for the report
to resume uplink transmission.
\- The target gNB re-transmits and prioritizes all downlink data forwarded by
the source gNB (i.e. the target gNB should first send all forwarded PDCP SDUs
with PDCP SNs, then all forwarded downlink PDCP SDUs without SNs before
sending new data from 5GC), excluding PDCP SDUs for which the reception was
acknowledged through PDCP SN based reporting by the UE.
NOTE 1: Lossless delivery when a QoS flow is mapped to a different DRB at
handover, requires the old DRB to be configured in the target cell. For in-
order delivery in the DL, the target gNB should first transmit the forwarded
PDCP SDUs on the old DRB before transmitting new data from 5GC on the new DRB.
In the UL, the target gNB should not deliver data of the QoS flow from the new
DRB to 5GC before receiving the end marker on the old DRB from the UE.
\- The UE re-transmits in the target gNB all uplink PDCP SDUs starting from
the oldest PDCP SDU that has not been acknowledged at RLC in the source,
excluding PDCP SDUs for which the reception was acknowledged through PDCP SN
based reporting by the target.
\- In case of handovers involving Full Configuration, the following
description below for RLC-UM bearers applies for RLC-AM bearers instead. Data
loss may happen.
**For RLC-UM bearers** :
\- The PDCP SN and HFN are reset in the target gNB, unless the bearer is
configured with DAPS handover;
\- No PDCP SDUs are retransmitted in the target gNB;
\- The target gNB prioritises all downlink SDAP SDUs forwarded by the source
gNB over the data from the core network;
NOTE 2: To minimise losses when a QoS flow is mapped to a different DRB at
handover, the old DRB needs to be configured in the target cell. For in-order
delivery in the DL, the target gNB should first transmit the forwarded PDCP
SDUs on the old DRB before transmitting new data from 5GC on the new DRB. In
the UL, the target gNB should not deliver data of the QoS flow from the new
DRB to 5GC before receiving the end marker on the old DRB from the UE.
\- The UE does not retransmit any PDCP SDU in the target cell for which
transmission had been completed in the source cell.
**For DAPS handover:**
A DAPS handover can be used for an RLC-AM or RLC-UM bearer. For a DRB
configured with DAPS, the following principles are additionally applied.
Downlink:
\- During HO preparation, a forwarding tunnel is always established.
\- The source gNB is responsible for allocating downlink PDCP SNs until the SN
assignment is handed over to the target gNB and data forwarding in 9.2.3.2.3
takes place. That is, the source gNB does not stop assigning PDCP SNs to
downlink packets until it receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message and sends the
SN STATUS TRANSFER message to the target gNB.
\- Upon allocation of downlink PDCP SNs by the source gNB, it starts
scheduling downlink data on the source radio link and also starts forwarding
downlink PDCP SDUs along with assigned PDCP SNs to the target gNB.
\- For security synchronisation, HFN is maintained for the forwarded downlink
SDUs with PDCP SNs assigned by the source gNB. The source gNB sends the EARLY
STATUS TRANSFER message to convey the DL COUNT value, indicating PDCP SN and
HFN of the first PDCP SDU that the source gNB forwards to the target gNB.
\- HFN and PDCP SN are maintained after the SN assignment is handed over to
the target gNB. The SN STATUS TRANSFER message indicates the next DL PDCP SN
to allocate to a packet which does not have a PDCP sequence number yet, even
for RLC-UM.
\- During handover execution period, the _s_ ource and target gNBs separately
perform ROHC header compression, ciphering, and adding PDCP header.
\- During handover execution period, the UE continues to receive downlink data
from both source and target gNBs until the source gNB connection is released
by an explicit release command from the target gNB.
\- During handover execution period, the UE PDCP entity configured with DAPS
maintains separate security and ROHC header decompression functions associated
with each gNB, while maintaining common functions for reordering, duplicate
detection and discard, and PDCP SDUs in-sequence delivery to upper layers.
PDCP SN continuity is supported for both RLC AM and UM DRBs configured with
DAPS.
Uplink:
\- The UE transmits UL data to the source gNB until the random access
procedure toward the target gNB has been successfully completed. Afterwards
the UE switches its UL data transmission to the target gNB.
\- Even after switching its UL data transmissions towards the target gNB, the
UE continues to send UL layer 1 CSI feedback, HARQ feedback, layer 2 RLC
feedback, ROHC feedback, HARQ data (re-)transmissions, and RLC data
(re-)transmissions to the source gNB.
\- During handover execution period, the UE maintains separate security
context and ROHC header compressor context for uplink transmissions towards
the source and target gNBs. The UE maintains common UL PDCP SN allocation.
PDCP SN continuity is supported for both RLC AM and UM DRBs configured with
DAPS.
\- During handover execution period, the source and target gNBs maintain their
own security and ROHC header decompressor contexts to process UL data received
from the UE.
\- The establishment of a forwarding tunnel is optional.
\- HFN and PDCP SN are maintained in the target gNB. The SN STATUS TRANSFER
message indicates the COUNT of the first missing PDCP SDU that the target
should start delivering to the 5GC, even for RLC-UM.
##### 9.2.3.2.3 Data Forwarding
The following description depicts the data forwarding principles for intra-
system handover.
The source NG-RAN node may suggest downlink data forwarding per QoS flow
established for a PDU session and may provide information how it maps QoS
flows to DRBs. The target NG-RAN node decides data forwarding per QoS flow
established for a PDU Session.
If \"lossless handover\" is required and the QoS flows to DRB mapping applied
at the target NG-RAN node allows applying for data forwarding the same QoS
flows to DRB mapping as applied at the source NG-RAN node for a DRB and if all
QoS flows mapped to that DRB are accepted for data forwarding, the target NG-
RAN node establishes a downlink forwarding tunnel for that DRB.
For a DRB for which preservation of SN status applies, the target NG-RAN node
may decide to establish an UL data forwarding tunnel.
The target NG-RAN node may also decide to establish a downlink forwarding
tunnel for each PDU session. In this case the target NG-RAN node provides
information for which QoS flows data forwarding has been accepted and
corresponding UP TNL information for data forwarding tunnels to be established
between the source NG-RAN node and the target NG-RAN node.
If QoS flows have been re-mapped at the source NG-RAN node and user packets
along the old source mapping are still being processed at handover
preparation, and if the source NG-RAN node has not yet received the SDAP end
marker for certain QoS flows when providing the SN status to the target NG-RAN
node, the source NG-RAN node provides the old side QoS mapping information for
UL QoS flows to the target NG-RAN node for which no SDAP end marker was yet
received. The target NG-RAN will receive for those QoS flows the end marker
when the UE finalises to send UL user data according to the old source side
mapping.
The source NG-RAN node may also propose to establish uplink forwarding tunnels
for some PDU sessions in order to transfer SDAP SDUs corresponding to QoS
flows for which flow re-mapping happened before the handover and the SDAP end
marker has not yet been received, and for which user data was received at the
source NG-RAN node via the DRB to which the QoS flow was remapped. If accepted
the target NG-RAN node shall provide the corresponding UP TNL information for
data forwarding tunnels to be established between the source NG-RAN node and
the target NG-RAN node.
As long as data forwarding of DL user data packets takes place, the source NG-
RAN node shall forward user data in the same forwarding tunnel, i.e.
\- for any QoS flow accepted for data forwarding by the target NG-RAN node and
for which a DRB DL forwarding tunnel was established for a DRB to which this
QoS flow was mapped at the source NG-RAN node, any fresh packets of this QoS
flow shall be forwarded as PDCP SDUs via the mapped DRB DL forwarding tunnel.
\- for DRBs for which preservation of SN status applies, the source NG-RAN
node may forward in order to the target NG-RAN node via the DRB DL forwarding
tunnel all downlink PDCP SDUs with their SN corresponding to PDCP PDUs which
have not been acknowledged by the UE.
NOTE: The SN of forwarded PDCP SDUs is carried in the \"PDCP PDU number\"
field of the GTP-U extension header.
\- for any QoS flow accepted for data forwarding by the target NG-RAN node for
which a DL PDU session forwarding tunnel was established, the source NG-RAN
node forwards SDAP SDUs as received on NG-U from the UPF.
For handovers involving Full Configuration, the source NG-RAN node behaviour
is unchanged from the description above. In case a DRB DL forwarding tunnel
was established, the target NG-RAN node may identify the PDCP SDUs for which
delivery was attempted by the source NG-RAN node, by the presence of the PDCP
SN in the forwarded GTP-U packet and may discard them.
As long as data forwarding of UL user data packets takes place for DRBs for
which preservation of SN status applies the source NG-RAN node either:
\- discards the uplink PDCP PDUs received out of sequence if the source NG-RAN
node has not accepted the request from the target NG-RAN node for uplink
forwarding or if the target NG-RAN node has not requested uplink forwarding
for the bearer during the Handover Preparation procedure; or
\- forwards to the target NG-RAN node via the corresponding DRB UL forwarding
tunnel, the uplink PDCP SDUs with their SN corresponding to PDCP PDUs received
out of sequence if the source NG-RAN node has accepted the request from the
target NG-RAN node for uplink forwarding for the bearer during the Handover
Preparation procedure, including PDCP SDUs corresponding to user data of those
QoS flows, for which re-mapping happened for a QoS flow before the handover
and the SDAP end marker has not yet been received at the source NG-RAN node.
As long as data forwarding of UL user data packets takes place for a PDU
session, the source NG-RAN node forwards via the corresponding PDU session UL
forwarding tunnel, the uplink SDAP SDUs corresponding to QoS flows for which
flow re-mapping happened before the handover and the SDAP end marker has not
yet been received at the source NG-RAN node, and which were received at the
source NG-RAN node via the DRB to which the QoS flow was remapped.
For DRBs configured with DAPS handover, data forwarding after the source gNB
receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message from the target gNB follows the same
behaviors as described above.
For DRBs configured with DAPS handover, before the source gNB receives the
HANDOVER SUCCESS message:
\- The source gNB may forward to the target gNB downlink PDCP SDUs with SNs
assigned by the source gNB. No downlink PDCP SDU without a SN assigned or SDAP
SDU is forwarded. No uplink PDCP SDU or SDAP SDU is forwarded.
\- The source gNB sends the EARLY STATUS TRANSFER message to maintain HFN
continuity by indicating PDCP SN and HFN of the first PDCP SDU that the source
gNB forwards to the target gNB. The subsequent messages may be sent for
discarding of already forwarded downlink PDCP SDUs in the target gNB.
\- The source gNB does not stop transmitting downlink packets to the UE. The
source gNB keeps forwarding to the 5GC the uplink SDAP SDUs successfully
received in-sequence from the UE.
Handling of end marker packets:
\- The source NG-RAN node receives one or several GTP-U end marker packets per
PDU session from the UPF and replicates the end marker packets into each data
forwarding tunnel when no more user data packets are to be forwarded over that
tunnel.
\- End marker packets sent via a data forwarding tunnel are applicable to all
QoS flows forwarded via that tunnel. After end marker packets have been
received over a forwarding tunnel, the target NG-RAN node can start taking
into account the packets of QoS flows associated with that forwarding tunnel
received at the target NG-RAN node from the NG-U PDU session tunnel.
#### 9.2.3.3 Re-establishment procedure
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the re-establishment procedure to continue
the RRC connection when a failure condition occurs (e.g. radio link failure,
reconfiguration failure, integrity check failure...).
The following figure describes the re-establishment procedure started by the
UE:
Figure 9.2.3.3-1: Re-establishment procedure
1\. The UE re-establishes the connection, providing the UE Identity
(PCI+C-RNTI) to the gNB where the trigger for the re-establishment occurred.
2\. If the UE Context is not locally available, the gNB, requests the last
serving gNB to provide UE Context data.
3\. The last serving gNB provides UE context data.
4/4a. The gNB continues the re-establishment of the RRC connection. The
message is sent on SRB1.
5/5a. The gNB may perform the reconfiguration to re-establish SRB2 and DRBs
when the re-establishment procedure is ongoing.
6/7. If loss of user data buffered in the last serving gNB shall be prevented,
the gNB provides forwarding addresses, and the last serving gNB provides the
SN status to the gNB.
8/9. The gNB performs path switch.
10\. The gNB triggers the release of the UE resources at the last serving gNB.
The IAB-MT in SA mode follows the same re-establishment procedure as described
for the UE. After the backhaul has been established, the re-establishment
procedure of the IAB-MT is part of the intra-CU backhaul RLF recovery
procedure for IAB-nodes defined in TS 38.401 [4]. Modifications to the
configuration of BAP sublayer and higher protocol layers above the BAP
sublayer are described in TS 38.401 [4].
#### 9.2.3.4 Conditional Handover
##### 9.2.3.4.1 General
A Conditional Handover (CHO) is defined as a handover that is executed by the
UE when one or more handover execution conditions are met. The UE starts
evaluating the execution condition(s) upon receiving the CHO configuration,
and stops evaluating the execution condition(s) once a handover is executed.
The following principles apply to CHO:
\- The CHO configuration contains the configuration of CHO candidate cell(s)
generated by the candidate gNB(s) and execution condition(s) generated by the
source gNB.
\- An execution condition may consist of one or two trigger condition(s) (CHO
events A3/A5, as defined in [12]). Only single RS type is supported and at
most two different trigger quantities (e.g. RSRP and RSRQ, RSRP and SINR,
etc.) can be configured simultaneously for the evalution of CHO execution
condition of a single candidate cell.
\- Before any CHO execution condition is satisfied, upon reception of HO
command (without CHO configuration), the UE executes the HO procedure as
described in clause 9.2.3.2, regardless of any previously received CHO
configuration.
\- While executing CHO, i.e. from the time when the UE starts synchronization
with target cell, UE does not monitor source cell.
CHO is also supported for the IAB-MT in context of intra- and inter-donor IAB-
node migration and BH RLF recovery.
CHO is not supported for NG-C based handover in this release of the
specification.
##### 9.2.3.4.2 C-plane handling
As in intra-NR RAN handover, in intra-NR RAN CHO, the preparation and
execution phase of the conditional handover procedure is performed without
involvement of the 5GC; i.e. preparation messages are directly exchanged
between gNBs. The release of the resources at the source gNB during the
conditional handover completion phase is triggered by the target gNB. The
figure below depicts the basic conditional handover scenario where neither the
AMF nor the UPF changes:
Figure 9.2.3.4.2-1: Intra-AMF/UPF Conditional Handover
0/1. Same as step 0, 1 in Figure 9.2.3.2.1-1 of clause 9.2.3.2.1.
2\. The source gNB decides to use CHO.
3\. The source gNB requests CHO for one or more candidate cells belonging to
one or more candidate gNBs. A CHO request message is sent for each candidate
cell.
4\. Same as step 4 in Figure 9.2.3.2.1-1 of clause 9.2.3.2.1.
5\. The candidate gNB(s) sends CHO response (HO REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE) including
configuration of CHO candidate cell(s) to the source gNB. The CHO response
message is sent for each candidate cell.
6\. The source gNB sends an _RRCReconfiguration_ message to the UE, containing
the configuration of CHO candidate cell(s) and CHO execution condition(s).
NOTE 1: CHO configuration of candidate cells can be followed by other
reconfiguration from the source gNB.
NOTE 1a: A configuration of a CHO candidate cell cannot contain a DAPS
handover configuration.
7\. The UE sends an _RRCReconfigurationComplete_ message to the source gNB.
7a If early data forwarding is applied, the source gNB sends the EARLY STATUS
TRANSFER message.
8\. The UE maintains connection with the source gNB after receiving CHO
configuration, and starts evaluating the CHO execution conditions for the
candidate cell(s). If at least one CHO candidate cell satisfies the
corresponding CHO execution condition, the UE detaches from the source gNB,
applies the stored corresponding configuration for that selected candidate
cell, synchronises to that candidate cell and completes the RRC handover
procedure by sending _RRCReconfigurationComplete_ message to the target gNB.
The UE releases stored CHO configurations after successful completion of RRC
handover procedure.
8a/b The target gNB sends the HANDOVER SUCCESS message to the source gNB to
inform that the UE has successfully accessed the target cell. In return, the
source gNB sends the SN STATUS TRANSFER message following the principles
described in step 7 of Intra-AMF/UPF Handover in clause 9.2.3.2.1.
NOTE 2: Late data forwarding may be initiated as soon as the source gNB
receives the HANDOVER SUCCESS message.
8c. The source gNB sends the HANDOVER CANCEL message toward the other
signalling connections or other candidate target gNBs, if any, to cancel CHO
for the UE.
##### 9.2.3.4.3 U-plane handling
The U-plane handling for Conditional Handover follows the same principles for
DAPS handover in 9.2.3.2.2, if early data forwarding is applied, except that,
in case of Full Configuration, HFN and PDCP SN are reset in the target gNB
after the SN assignment is handed over to the target gNB. If late data
forwarding is applied, the U-plane handling follows the RLC-AM or RLC-UM
bearer principles defined in 9.2.3.2.2.
##### 9.2.3.4.4 Data Forwarding
If late data forwarding is applied, the source NG-RAN node initiates data
forwarding once it knows which target NG-RAN node the UE has successfully
accessed. In that case the behavior of the Conditional Handover data
forwarding follows the same behavior as defined in 9.2.3.2.3 for the intra-
system handover data forwarding, except the behavior for DRBs configured with
DAPS handover.
If early data forwarding is applied instead, the source NG-RAN node initiates
data forwarding before the UE executes the handover, to a candidate target
node of interest. The behavior of early data forwarding for the Conditional
Handover follows the same principles for DRBs configured with DAPS handover in
the intra-system handover as defined in 9.2.3.2.3.
### 9.2.4 Measurements
In RRC_CONNECTED, the UE measures multiple beams (at least one) of a cell and
the measurements results (power values) are averaged to derive the cell
quality. In doing so, the UE is configured to consider a subset of the
detected beams. Filtering takes place at two different levels: at the physical
layer to derive beam quality and then at RRC level to derive cell quality from
multiple beams. Cell quality from beam measurements is derived in the same way
for the serving cell(s) and for the non-serving cell(s). Measurement reports
may contain the measurement results of the _X_ best beams if the UE is
configured to do so by the gNB.
The corresponding high-level measurement model is described below:
Figure 9.2.4-1: Measurement Model
NOTE 1: K beams correspond to the measurements on SSB or CSI-RS resources
configured for L3 mobility by gNB and detected by UE at L1.
\- **A** : measurements (beam specific samples) internal to the physical
layer.
\- **Layer 1 filtering** : internal layer 1 filtering of the inputs measured
at point A. Exact filtering is implementation dependent. How the measurements
are actually executed in the physical layer by an implementation (inputs A and
Layer 1 filtering) is not constrained by the standard.
\- **A^1^** : measurements (i.e. beam specific measurements) reported by layer
1 to layer 3 after layer 1 filtering.
**\- Beam Consolidation/Selection** : beam specific measurements are
consolidated to derive cell quality. The behaviour of the Beam
consolidation/selection is standardised and the configuration of this module
is provided by RRC signalling. Reporting period at B equals one measurement
period at A^1^.
**\- B** : a measurement (i.e. cell quality) derived from beam-specific
measurements reported to layer 3 after beam consolidation/selection.
\- **Layer 3 filtering for cell quality** : filtering performed on the
measurements provided at point B. The behaviour of the Layer 3 filters is
standardised and the configuration of the layer 3 filters is provided by RRC
signalling. Filtering reporting period at C equals one measurement period at
B.
\- **C** : a measurement after processing in the layer 3 filter. The reporting
rate is identical to the reporting rate at point B. This measurement is used
as input for one or more evaluation of reporting criteria.
\- **Evaluation of reporting criteria** : checks whether actual measurement
reporting is necessary at point D. The evaluation can be based on more than
one flow of measurements at reference point C e.g. to compare between
different measurements. This is illustrated by input C and C^1^. The UE shall
evaluate the reporting criteria at least every time a new measurement result
is reported at point C, C^1^. The reporting criteria are standardised and the
configuration is provided by RRC signalling (UE measurements).
\- **D** : measurement report information (message) sent on the radio
interface.
\- **L3 Beam filtering** : filtering performed on the measurements (i.e. beam
specific measurements) provided at point A^1^. The behaviour of the beam
filters is standardised and the configuration of the beam filters is provided
by RRC signalling. Filtering reporting period at E equals one measurement
period at A^1^.
\- **E** : a measurement (i.e. beam-specific measurement) after processing in
the beam filter. The reporting rate is identical to the reporting rate at
point A^1^. This measurement is used as input for selecting the X measurements
to be reported.
\- **Beam Selection for beam reporting** : selects the X measurements from the
measurements provided at point E. The behaviour of the beam selection is
standardised and the configuration of this module is provided by RRC
signalling.
\- **F** : beam measurement information included in measurement report (sent)
on the radio interface.
Layer 1 filtering introduces a certain level of measurement averaging. How and
when the UE exactly performs the required measurements is implementation
specific to the point that the output at B fulfils the performance
requirements set in TS 38.133 [13]. Layer 3 filtering for cell quality and
related parameters used are specified in TS 38.331 [12] and do not introduce
any delay in the sample availability between B and C. Measurement at point C,
C^1^ is the input used in the event evaluation. L3 Beam filtering and related
parameters used are specified in TS 38.331 [12] and do not introduce any delay
in the sample availability between E and F.
Measurement reports are characterized by the following:
\- Measurement reports include the measurement identity of the associated
measurement configuration that triggered the reporting;
\- Cell and beam measurement quantities to be included in measurement reports
are configured by the network;
\- The number of non-serving cells to be reported can be limited through
configuration by the network;
\- Cells belonging to an exclude-list configured by the network are not used
in event evaluation and reporting, and conversely when an allow-list is
configured by the network, only the cells belonging to the allow-list are used
in event evaluation and reporting;
\- Beam measurements to be included in measurement reports are configured by
the network (beam identifier only, measurement result and beam identifier, or
no beam reporting).
Intra-frequency neighbour (cell) measurements and inter-frequency neighbour
(cell) measurements are defined as follows:
\- SSB based intra-frequency measurement: a measurement is defined as an SSB
based intra-frequency measurement provided the center frequency of the SSB of
the serving cell and the center frequency of the SSB of the neighbour cell are
the same, and the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs is also the same.
\- SSB based inter-frequency measurement: a measurement is defined as an SSB
based inter-frequency measurement provided the center frequency of the SSB of
the serving cell and the center frequency of the SSB of the neighbour cell are
different, or the subcarrier spacing of the two SSBs is different.
NOTE 2: For SSB based measurements, one measurement object corresponds to one
SSB and the UE considers different SSBs as different cells.
NOTE 2a: If a RedCap UE is configured to perform serving cell measurements
based on an NCD-SSB configured in its active BWP, this NCD-SSB is considered
as the SSB of the serving cell in the definition of intra-frequency and inter-
frequency measurements as above.
\- CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement: a measurement is defined as a
CSI-RS based intra-frequency measurement provided that:
\- The subcarrier spacing of CSI-RS resources on the neighbour cell configured
for measurement is the same as the SCS of CSI-RS resources on the serving cell
indicated for measurement; and
\- For 60kHz subcarrier spacing, the CP type of CSI-RS resources on the
neighbour cell configured for measurement is the same as the CP type of CSI-RS
resources on the serving cell indicated for measurement; and
\- The centre frequency of CSI-RS resources on the neighbour cell configured
for measurement is the same as the centre frequency of CSI-RS resource on the
serving cell indicated for measurement.
\- CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement: a measurement is defined as a
CSI-RS based inter-frequency measurement if it is not a CSI-RS based intra-
frequency measurement.
NOTE 3: Extended CP for CSI-RS based measurement is not supported in this
release.
Whether a measurement is non-gap-assisted or gap-assisted depends on the
capability of the UE, the active BWP of the UE and the current operating
frequency:
\- For SSB based inter-frequency measurement, if the measurement gap
requirement information is reported by the UE, a measurement gap configuration
may be provided according to the information. Otherwise, a measurement gap
configuration is always provided in the following cases:
\- If the UE only supports per-UE measurement gaps;
\- If the UE supports per-FR measurement gaps and any of the serving cells are
in the same frequency range of the measurement object.
\- For SSB based intra-frequency measurement, if the measurement gap
requirement information is reported by the UE, a measurement gap configuration
may be provided according to the information. Otherwise, a measurement gap
configuration is always provided in the following case:
\- Other than the initial BWP, if any of the UE or RedCap UE configured BWPs
do not contain the frequency domain resources of the SSB associated to the
initial DL BWP, and for RedCap UE, are not configured with NCD-SSB for serving
cell measurement.
In non-gap-assisted scenarios, the UE shall be able to carry out such
measurements without measurement gaps. In gap-assisted scenarios, the UE
cannot be assumed to be able to carry out such measurements without
measurement gaps.
Network may request the UE to measure NR and/or E-UTRA carriers in RRC_IDLE or
RRC_INACTIVE via system information or via dedicated measurement configuration
in _RRCRelease_. If the UE was configured to perform measurements of NR and/or
E-UTRA carriers while in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE, it may provide an
indication of the availability of corresponding measurement results to the gNB
in the _RRCSetupComplete_ message. The network may request the UE to report
those measurements after security activation. The request for the measurements
can be sent by the network immediately after transmitting the Security Mode
Command (i.e. before the reception of the Security Mode Complete from the UE).
If the UE was configured to perform measurements of NR and/or E-UTRA carriers
while in RRC_INACTIVE, the gNB can request the UE to provide corresponding
measurement results in the _RRCResume_ message and then the UE can include the
available measurement results in the _RRCResumeComplete_ message.
Alternatively, the UE may provide an indication of the availability of the
measurement results to the gNB in the _RRCResumeComplete_ message and the gNB
can then request the UE to provide these measurement results.
### 9.2.5 Paging
Paging allows the network to reach UEs in RRC_IDLE and in RRC_INACTIVE state
through _Paging_ messages, and to notify UEs in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE and
RRC_CONNECTED state of system information change (see clause 7.3.3) and
ETWS/CMAS indications (see clause 16.4) through _Short Messages_. Both
_Paging_ messages and _Short Messages_ are addressed with P-RNTI on PDCCH, but
while the former is sent on PCCH, the latter is sent over PDCCH directly (see
clause 6.5 of TS 38.331 [12]).
While in RRC_IDLE the UE monitors the paging channels for CN-initiated paging.
While in RRC_INACTIVE with no ongoing SDT procedure (see clause 18.0) the UE
monitors paging channels for RAN-initiated paging and CN-initiated paging. A
UE need not monitor paging channels continuously though; Paging DRX is defined
where the UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE is only required to monitor paging
channels during one Paging Occasion (PO) per DRX cycle (see TS 38.304 [10]).
The Paging DRX cycles are configured by the network:
1) For CN-initiated paging, a default cycle is broadcast in system
information;
2) For CN-initiated paging, a UE specific cycle can be configured via NAS
signalling;
3) For RAN-initiated paging, a UE-specific cycle is configured via RRC
signalling;
\- The UE uses the shortest of the DRX cycles applicable i.e. a UE in RRC_IDLE
uses the shortest of the first two cycles above, while a UE in RRC_INACTIVE
uses the shortest of the three.
The POs of a UE for CN-initiated and RAN-initiated paging are based on the
same UE ID, resulting in overlapping POs for both. The number of different POs
in a DRX cycle is configurable via system information and a network may
distribute UEs to those POs based on their IDs.
While in RRC_CONNECTED and while in RRC_INACTIVE with ongoing SDT procedure,
the UE monitors the paging channels in any PO signalled in system information
for SI change indication and PWS notification. In case of BA, a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED only monitors paging channels on the active BWP with common
search space configured.
For operation with shared spectrum channel access, a UE can be configured for
an additional number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in its PO to monitor for
paging. However, when the UE detects a PDCCH transmission within the UE\'s PO
addressed with P-RNTI, the UE is not required to monitor the subsequent PDCCH
monitoring occasions within this PO.
If Paging Cause is included in the Paging message, a UE in RRC_IDLE or
RRC_INACTIVE state may use the Paging Cause as per TS 23.501[3].
**Paging optimization for UEs in CM_IDLE** : at UE context release, the NG-RAN
node may provide the AMF with a list of recommended cells and NG-RAN nodes as
assistance info for subsequent paging. The AMF may also provide Paging Attempt
Information consisting of a Paging Attempt Count and the Intended Number of
Paging Attempts and may include the Next Paging Area Scope. If Paging Attempt
Information is included in the Paging message, each paged NG-RAN node receives
the same information during a paging attempt. The Paging Attempt Count shall
be increased by one at each new paging attempt. The Next Paging Area Scope,
when present, indicates whether the AMF plans to modify the paging area
currently selected at next paging attempt. If the UE has changed its state to
CM CONNECTED the Paging Attempt Count is reset.
**Paging optimization for UEs in RRC_INACTIVE** : at RAN Paging, the serving
NG-RAN node provides RAN Paging area information. The serving NG-RAN node may
also provide RAN Paging attempt information. Each paged NG-RAN node receives
the same RAN Paging attempt information during a paging attempt with the
following content: Paging Attempt Count, the intended number of paging
attempts and the Next Paging Area Scope. The Paging Attempt Count shall be
increased by one at each new paging attempt. The Next Paging Area Scope, when
present, indicates whether the serving NG_RAN node plans to modify the RAN
Paging Area currently selected at next paging attempt. If the UE leaves
RRC_INACTIVE state the Paging Attempt Count is reset.
**UE power saving for paging monitoring:** in order to reduce UE power
consumption due to false paging alarms, the group of UEs monitoring the same
PO can be further divided into multiple subgroups. With subgrouping, a UE
shall monitor PDCCH in its PO for paging if the subgroup to which the UE
belongs is paged as indicated via associated PEI. If a UE cannot find its
subgroup ID with the PEI configurations in a cell or if the UE is unable to
monitor the associated PEI occasion corresponding to its PO, it shall monitor
the paging in its PO.
These subgroups have the following characteristics:
\- They are formed based on either CN controlled subgrouping or UE ID based
subgrouping;
\- If CN controlled subgroup ID is not provided from AMF, UE ID based
subgrouping is used if supported by the UE and network;
\- The RRC state (RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state) does not impact which
subgroup the UE belongs to;
\- Subgrouping support for a cell is broadcast in the system information as
one of the following: Only CN controlled subgrouping supported, only UE ID
based subgrouping supported, or both CN controlled subgrouping and UE ID based
subgrouping supported;
\- Total number of subgroups allowed in a cell is up to 8 and represents the
sum of CN controlled and UE ID based subgrouping configured by the network;
\- A UE configured with CN controlled subgroup ID applies CN controlled
subgroup ID if the cell supports CN controlled subgrouping; otherwise, it
derives UE ID based subgroup ID if the cell supports only UE ID based
subgrouping.
PEI associated with subgroups has the following characteristics:
\- If the PEI is supported by the UE, it shall at least support UE ID based
subgrouping method;
\- PEI monitoring can be limited via system information to the last used cell
(i.e., the cell in which the UE most recently received _RRCRelease_ without
indicating that the last used cell for PEI shall not be updated);
**\- A PEI-capable UE shall store its last used cell information;**
\- gNBs supporting the PEI monitoring to the last used cell function provide
the UE\'s last used cell information to the AMF in the NG-AP UE Context
Release Complete message for PEI capable UEs, as described in TS 38.413 [26];
\- UE that expects MBS group notification shall ignore the PEI and shall
monitor paging in its PO.
> **CN controlled subgrouping:** For CN controlled subgrouping, AMF is
> responsible for assigning subgroup ID to the UE. The total number of
> subgroups for CN controlled subgrouping which can be configured, e.g. by OAM
> is up to 8. It is assumed that CN controlled subgrouping support is
> homogeneous within an RNA.
>
> The following figure describes the procedure for CN controlled subgrouping:
>
> Figure 9.2.5-1: Procedure for CN controlled subgrouping
1\. The UE indicates its support of CN controlled subgrouping via NAS
signalling.
2\. If the UE supports CN controlled subgrouping, the AMF determines the
subgroup ID assignment for the UE.
3\. The AMF sends subgroup ID to the UE via NAS signalling.
4\. The AMF informs the gNB about the CN assigned subgroup ID for paging the
UE in RRC_IDLE/ RRC_INACTIVE state.
5\. When the paging message for the UE is received from the CN or is generated
by the gNB, the gNB determines the PO and the associated PEI occasion for the
UE.
6\. Before the UE is paged in the PO, the gNB transmits the associated PEI and
indicates the corresponding CN controlled subgroup of the UE that is to be
paged in the PEI.
> **UE ID based subgrouping:** For UE ID based subgrouping, the gNB and UE can

> Figure 9.2.5-2: Procedure for UE ID based subgrouping
1\. The gNB determines the total number of subgroups for UE ID based
subgrouping in a cell.
2\. The gNB broadcasts the total number of subgroups for UE ID based
subgrouping in a cell.
3\. UE determines its subgroup in a cell.
4\. When paging message for the PEI capable UE is received from the CN at the
gNB or is generated by the gNB, the gNB determines the PO and the associated
PEI occasion for the UE.
5\. Before the UE is paged in the PO, the gNB transmits the associated PEI and
indicates the corresponding subgroup derived based on UE ID of the UE that is
paged in the PEI.
### 9.2.6 Random Access Procedure
The random access procedure is triggered by a number of events:
\- Initial access from RRC_IDLE;
\- RRC Connection Re-establishment procedure;
\- DL or UL data arrival, during RRC_CONNECTED or during RRC_INACTIVE while
SDT procedure (see clause 18.0) is ongoing, when UL synchronisation status is
\"non-synchronised\";
\- UL data arrival, during RRC_CONNECTED or during RRC_INACTIVE while SDT
procedure is ongoing, when there are no PUCCH resources for SR available;
\- SR failure;
\- Request by RRC upon synchronous reconfiguration (e.g. handover);
\- RRC Connection Resume procedure from RRC_INACTIVE;
\- To establish time alignment for a secondary TAG;
\- Request for Other SI (see clause 7.3);
\- Beam failure recovery;
\- Consistent UL LBT failure on SpCell;
\- SDT in RRC_INACTIVE (see clause 18);
\- Positioning purpose during RRC_CONNECTED requiring random access procedure,
e.g., when timing advance is needed for UE positioning.
Two types of random access procedure are supported: 4-step RA type with MSG1
and 2-step RA type with MSGA. Both types of RA procedure support contention-
based random access (CBRA) and contention-free random access (CFRA) as shown
on Figure 9.2.6-1 below.
The UE selects the type of random access at initiation of the random access
procedure based on network configuration:
\- when CFRA resources are not configured, an RSRP threshold is used by the UE
to select between 2-step RA type and 4-step RA type;
\- when CFRA resources for 4-step RA type are configured, UE performs random
access with 4-step RA type;
\- when CFRA resources for 2-step RA type are configured, UE performs random
access with 2-step RA type.
The network does not configure CFRA resources for 4-step and 2-step RA types
at the same time for a Bandwidth Part (BWP). CFRA with 2-step RA type is only
supported for handover.
The MSG1 of the 4-step RA type consists of a preamble on PRACH. After MSG1
transmission, the UE monitors for a response from the network within a
configured window. For CFRA, dedicated preamble for MSG1 transmission is
assigned by the network and upon receiving random access response from the
network, the UE ends the random access procedure as shown in Figure
9.2.6-1(c). For CBRA, upon reception of the random access response, the UE
sends MSG3 using the UL grant scheduled in the response and monitors
contention resolution as shown in Figure 9.2.6-1(a). If contention resolution
is not successful after MSG3 (re)transmission(s), the UE goes back to MSG1
transmission.
The MSGA of the 2-step RA type includes a preamble on PRACH and a payload on
PUSCH. After MSGA transmission, the UE monitors for a response from the
network within a configured window. For CFRA, dedicated preamble and PUSCH
resource are configured for MSGA transmission and upon receiving the network
response, the UE ends the random access procedure as shown in Figure
9.2.6-1(d). For CBRA, if contention resolution is successful upon receiving
the network response, the UE ends the random access procedure as shown in
Figure 9.2.6-1(b); while if fallback indication is received in MSGB, the UE
performs MSG3 transmission using the UL grant scheduled in the fallback
indication and monitors contention resolution as shown in Figure 9.2.6-2. If
contention resolution is not successful after MSG3 (re)transmission(s), the UE
goes back to MSGA transmission.
If the random access procedure with 2-step RA type is not completed after a
number of MSGA transmissions, the UE can be configured to switch to CBRA with
4-step RA type.

(c) CFRA with 4-step RA type (d) CFRA with 2-step RA type
Figure 9.2.6-1: Random Access Procedures
Figure 9.2.6-2: Fallback for CBRA with 2-step RA type
For random access in a cell configured with SUL, the network can explicitly
signal which carrier to use (UL or SUL). Otherwise, the UE selects the SUL
carrier if and only if the measured quality of the DL is lower than a
broadcast threshold. UE performs carrier selection before selecting between
2-step and 4-step RA type. The RSRP threshold for selecting between 2-step and
4-step RA type can be configured separately for UL and SUL. Once started, all
uplink transmissions of the random access procedure remain on the selected
carrier.
The network can associate a set of RACH resources with feature(s) applicable
to a Random Access procedure: Network Slicing (see clause 16.3), RedCap (see
clause 16.13), SDT (see clause 18), and NR coverage enhancement (see clause
19). A set of RACH resources associated with a feature is only valid for
random access procedures applicable to at least that feature; and a set of
RACH resources associated with several features is only valid for random
access procedures having at least all of these features. The UE selects the
set(s) of applicable RACH resources, after uplink carrier (i.e. NUL or SUL)
and BWP selection and before selecting the RA type.
When CA is configured, random access procedure with 2-step RA type is only
performed on PCell while contention resolution can be cross-scheduled by the
PCell.
When CA is configured, for random access procedure with 4-step RA type, the
first three steps of CBRA always occur on the PCell while contention
resolution (step 4) can be cross-scheduled by the PCell. The three steps of a
CFRA started on the PCell remain on the PCell. CFRA on SCell can only be
initiated by the gNB to establish timing advance for a secondary TAG: the
procedure is initiated by the gNB with a PDCCH order (step 0) that is sent on
an activated SCell of the secondary TAG, preamble transmission (step 1) takes
place on the SCell, and Random Access Response (step 2) takes place on PCell.
### 9.2.7 Radio Link Failure
In RRC_CONNECTED, the UE performs Radio Link Monitoring (RLM) in the active
BWP based on reference signals (SSB/CSI-RS) and signal quality thresholds
configured by the network. SSB-based RLM is based on the SSB associated to the
initial DL BWP and can be configured for the initial DL BWP and for DL BWPs
containing the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP. Besides, SSB-based RLM
can be also performed based on the non-cell defining SSB, if configured for
RedCap UEs. For other DL BWPs, RLM can only be performed based on CSI-RS. In
case of DAPS handover, the UE continues the detection of radio link failure at
the source cell until the successful completion of the random access procedure
to the target cell.
The UE declares Radio Link Failure (RLF) when one of the following criteria
are met:
\- Expiry of a radio problem timer started after indication of radio problems
from the physical layer (if radio problems are recovered before the timer is
expired, the UE stops the timer); or
\- Expiry of a timer started upon triggering a measurement report for a
measurement identity for which the timer has been configured while another
radio problem timer is running; or
\- Random access procedure failure; or
\- RLC failure; or
\- Detection of consistent uplink LBT failures for operation with shared
spectrum channel access as described in 5.6.1; or
\- For IAB-MT, the reception of a BH RLF indication received from its parent
node.
After RLF is declared, the UE:
\- stays in RRC_CONNECTED;
\- in case of DAPS handover, for RLF in the source cell:
\- stops any data transmission or reception via the source link and releases
the source link, but maintains the source RRC configuration;
\- if handover failure is then declared at the target cell, the UE:
\- selects a suitable cell and then initiates RRC re-establishment;
\- enters RRC_IDLE if a suitable cell was not found within a certain time
after handover failure was declared.
\- in case of CHO, for RLF in the source cell:
\- selects a suitable cell and if the selected cell is a CHO candidate and if
network configured the UE to try CHO after RLF then the UE attempts CHO
execution once, otherwise re-establishment is performed;
\- enters RRC_IDLE if a suitable cell was not found within a certain time
after RLF was declared.
\- otherwise, for RLF in the serving cell or in case of DAPS handover, for RLF
in the target cell before releasing the source cell:
\- selects a suitable cell and then initiates RRC re-establishment;
\- enters RRC_IDLE if a suitable cell was not found within a certain time
after RLF was declared.
When RLF occurs at the IAB BH link, the same mechanisms and procedures are
applied as for the access link. This includes BH RLF detection and RLF
recovery.
The IAB-DU can transmit a BH RLF detection indication to its child nodes in
the following cases:
\- The collocated IAB-MT initiates RRC re-establishment;
\- The collocated IAB-MT is dual-connected, detects BH RLF on a BH link, and
cannot perform UL re-routing for any traffic. This includes the scenario of an
IAB-node operating in EN-DC or NR-DC, which uses only one link for backhauling
and has BH RLF on this BH link;
\- The collocated IAB-MT has received a BH RLF detection indication from a
parent node, and there is no remaining backhaul link that is unaffected by the
BH RLF condition indicated.
Upon reception of the BH RLF detection indication, the child node may perform
local rerouting for upstream traffic, if possible, over an available BH link.
If the IAB-DU has transmitted a BH RLF detection indication to a child node
due to an RLF condition on the collocated IAB-MT\'s parent link, and the
collocated IAB-MT\'s subsequent RLF recovery is successful, the IAB-DU may
transmit a BH RLF recovery indication to this child node.
If the IAB-DU has transmitted a BH RLF detection indication to a child node
due to the reception of a BH RLF detection indication by the collocated IAB-
MT, and the collocated IAB-MT receives a BH RLF recovery indication, the IAB-
DU may also transmit a BH RLF recovery indication to this child node.
Upon reception of the BH RLF recovery indication, the child node reverts the
actions triggered by the reception of the previous BH RLF detection
indication.
In case the RRC re-establishment procedure fails, the IAB-node may transmit a
BH RLF indication to its child nodes. The BH RLF detection indication, BH RLF
recovery indication and BH RLF indication are transmitted as BAP Control PDUs.
### 9.2.8 Beam failure detection and recovery
For beam failure detection, the gNB configures the UE with beam failure
detection reference signals (SSB or CSI-RS) and the UE declares beam failure
when the number of beam failure instance indications from the physical layer
reaches a configured threshold before a configured timer expires. For beam
failure detection in multi-TRP operation, the gNB configures the UE with two
sets of beam failure detection reference signals, and the UE declares beam
failure for a TRP / BFD-RS set when the number of beam failure instance
indications associated with the corresponding set of beam failure detection
reference signals from the physical layer reaches a configured threshold
before a configured timer expires.
SSB-based Beam Failure Detection is based on the SSB associated to the initial
DL BWP and can be configured for the initial DL BWPs and for DL BWPs
containing the SSB associated to the initial DL BWP. Besides, SSB-based Beam
Failure Detection can be also performed based on the non-cell defining SSB, if
configured for RedCap UEs. For other DL BWPs, Beam Failure Detection can only
be performed based on CSI-RS.
After beam failure is detected on PCell, the UE:
\- triggers beam failure recovery by initiating a Random Access procedure on
the PCell;
\- selects a suitable beam to perform beam failure recovery (if the gNB has
provided dedicated Random Access resources for certain beams, those will be
prioritized by the UE).
\- includes an indication of a beam failure on PCell in a BFR MAC CE if the
Random Access procedure involves contention-based random access.
Upon completion of the Random Access procedure, beam failure recovery for
PCell is considered complete.
After beam failure is detected on an SCell, the UE:
\- triggers beam failure recovery by initiating a transmission of a BFR MAC CE
for this SCell;
\- selects a suitable beam for this SCell (if available) and indicates it
along with the information about the beam failure in the BFR MAC CE.
Upon reception of a PDCCH indicating an uplink grant for a new transmission
for the HARQ process used for the transmission of the BFR MAC CE, beam failure
recovery for this SCell is considered complete.
After beam failure is detected for a BFD-RS set of a Serving Cell, the UE:
\- triggers beam failure recovery by initiating a transmission of a BFR MAC CE
for this BFD-RS set;
\- selects a suitable beam for this BFD-RS set (if available) and indicates
whether the suitable (new) beam is found or not along with the information
about the beam failure in the BFR MAC CE for this BFD-RS set.
Upon reception of a PDCCH indicating an uplink grant for a new transmission
for the HARQ process used for the transmission of the BFR MAC CE for this BFD-
RS set, beam failure recovery for this BFD-RS set is considered complete.
After beam failure is detected for both BFD-RS sets of PCell concurrently, the
UE:
\- triggers beam failure recovery by initiating a Random Access procedure on
the PCell;
\- selects a suitable beam for each failed BFD-RS set (if available) and
indicates whether the suitable (new) beam is found or not along with the
information about the beam failure in the BFR MAC CE for each failed BFD-RS
set;
\- upon completion of the Random Access procedure, beam failure recovery for
both BFD-RS sets of PCell is considered complete.
### 9.2.9 Timing Advance
In RRC_CONNECTED, the gNB is responsible for maintaining the timing advance to
keep the L1 synchronised. Serving cells having UL to which the same timing
advance applies and using the same timing reference cell are grouped in a TAG.
Each TAG contains at least one serving cell with configured uplink, and the
mapping of each serving cell to a TAG is configured by RRC.
For the primary TAG the UE uses the PCell as timing reference, except with
shared spectrum channel access where an SCell can also be used in certain
cases (see clause 7.1, TS 38.133 [13]). In a secondary TAG, the UE may use any
of the activated SCells of this TAG as a timing reference cell, but should not
change it unless necessary.
Timing advance updates are signalled by the gNB to the UE via MAC CE commands.
Such commands restart a TAG-specific timer which indicates whether the L1 can
be synchronised or not: when the timer is running, the L1 is considered
synchronised, otherwise, the L1 is considered non-synchronised (in which case
uplink transmission can only take place through MSG1/MSGA).
### 9.2.10 Extended DRX for RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE
When extended DRX (eDRX) is used, the following applies:
\- For RRC_INACTIVE, eDRX configuration for RAN paging is decided and
configured by NG-RAN. In RRC_INACTIVE the UE monitors both RAN and CN paging;
\- For RRC_IDLE, eDRX for CN paging is configured by upper layers. In RRC_IDLE
the UE monitors only CN paging;
\- Information on whether eDRX for CN paging and RAN paging is allowed on the
cell is provided separately in system information;
\- The maximum value of the eDRX cycle is 10485.76 seconds (2.91 hours) for
RRC_IDLE and 10.24 seconds for RRC_INACTIVE, while the minimum value of the
eDRX cycle is 2.56 seconds for both RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE;
\- The hyper SFN (H-SFN) is broadcast by the cell and increments by one when
the SFN wraps around;
\- Paging Hyperframe (PH) refers to the H-SFN in which the UE starts
monitoring paging according to DRX during a Paging Time Window (PTW) used in
RRC_IDLE. The PH and PTW are determined based on a formula (see TS 38.304
[10]) that is known by the AMF, UE and NG-RAN;
\- H-SFN, PH and PTW are used if the eDRX cycle is greater than 10.24 seconds;
\- When the RRC_IDLE eDRX cycle is longer than the system information
modification period, the UE verifies that stored system information remains
valid before resuming/establishing an RRC connection.
## 9.3 Inter RAT
### 9.3.1 NR-E-UTRA mobility: Intra 5GC
#### 9.3.1.1 Cell Reselection
Cell reselection is characterised by the following:
\- Cell reselection between NR RRC_IDLE and E-UTRA RRC_IDLE is supported;
\- Cell reselection from NR RRC_INACTIVE to E-UTRA RRC_IDLE is supported.
#### 9.3.1.2 Handover
Inter RAT mobility is characterised by the following:
\- The Source RAT configures Target RAT measurement and reporting.
\- The source RAT decides on the preparation initiation and provides the
necessary information to the target RAT in the format required by the target
RAT:
\- For handover preparation from E-UTRA to NR, the source RAT issues a
handover preparation request message to the target RAT passing a transparent
RRC container with necessary information to prepare the handover at the target
side. The information for the target RAT is the same type as specified in
clause 9.2.3.2.1 including the current QoS flow to DRB mapping applied to the
UE and RRM configuration.
\- The details of RRM configuration are the same type as specified for NR in
clause 9.2.3.2.1 including beam measurement information for the listed cells
if the measurements are available.
\- Radio resources are prepared in the target RAT before the handover.
\- The RRC reconfiguration message from the target RAT is delivered to the
source RAT via a transparent container, and is passed to the UE by the source
RAT in the handover command:
\- The inter-RAT handover command message carries the same type of information
required to access the target cell as specified for NR baseline handover in
clause 9.2.3.2.1.
\- The in-sequence and lossless handover is supported for the handover between
gNB and ng-eNB.
\- Both Xn and NG based inter-RAT handover between NG-RAN nodes is supported.
Whether the handover is over Xn or CN is transparent to the UE.
\- In order to keep the SDAP and PDCP configurations for in-sequence and
lossless inter-RAT handover, delta-configuration for the radio bearer
configuration is used.
#### 9.3.1.3 Measurements
Inter RAT measurements in NR for this use case are limited to E-UTRA.
Whether a measurement is non-gap-assisted or gap-assisted depends on the
capability of the UE and the current operating frequency:
\- For E-UTRA Inter RAT measurement, if the measurement gap requirement
information is reported by the UE, a measurement gap configuration may be
provided according to the information. Otherwise, a measurement gap
configuration is always provided when:
\- The UE only supports per-UE measurement gaps; or
\- The UE supports per-FR measurement gaps and at least one of the NR serving
cells is in FR1.
### 9.3.2 NR-E-UTRA mobility: From 5GC to EPC
#### 9.3.2.1 Cell Reselection
Cell reselection is characterised by the following:
\- Cell reselection between NR RRC_IDLE and E-UTRA RRC_IDLE is supported;
\- Cell reselection from NR RRC_INACTIVE to E-UTRA RRC_IDLE is supported.
#### 9.3.2.2 Handover and redirection
The source NG-RAN node decides between handover or redirection to EPS based on
radio criteria and availability of the N26 interface.
NOTE: Information about the availability of the N26 interface may be
configured by OAM at the NG-RAN.
Inter RAT handover is characterised by the following:
\- The Source RAT configures Target RAT measurement and reporting.
\- The source RAT decides on the preparation initiation and provides the
necessary information to the target RAT in the format required by the target
RAT.
\- Radio resources are prepared in the target RAT before the handover.
\- The RRC reconfiguration message from the target RAT is delivered to the
source RAT via a transparent container, and is passed to the UE by the source
RAT in the handover command.
\- In-sequence and lossless handovers are not supported.
\- Security procedures for handover to E-UTRA/EPC should follow E-UTRA
handover procedures.
#### 9.3.2.3 Measurements
Inter RAT measurements in NR for this use case are limited to E-UTRA.
Whether a measurement is non-gap-assisted or gap-assisted depends on the
capability of the UE and the current operating frequency:
\- For E-UTRA Inter RAT measurement, if the measurement gap requirement
information is reported by the UE, a measurement gap configuration may be
provided according to the information. Otherwise, a measurement gap
configuration is always provided when:
\- The UE only supports per-UE measurement gaps; or
\- The UE supports per-FR measurement gaps and at least one of the NR serving
cells is in FR1.
#### 9.3.2.4 Data Forwarding for the Control Plane
Control plane handling for inter-System data forwarding from 5GS to EPS
follows the following key principles:
\- Only forwarding of downlink data is supported.
\- PDU session information at the serving NG-RAN node contains mapping
information per QoS Flow to a corresponding E-RAB.
\- At handover preparation, the source NG-RAN node shall decide which mapped
E-RABs are proposed to be subject to data forwarding and provide this
information in the source-to-target container to the target eNB. Based on
availability of direct data forwarding path the source NG-RAN node may request
to apply direct data forwarding by indicating direct data forwarding path
availability to the 5GC.
\- The target eNB assigns forwarding TEID/TNL address(es) for the E-RAB(s) for
which it accepts data forwarding.
\- In case of indirect data forwarding, a single data forwarding tunnel is
established between the source NG-RAN node and UPF per PDU session for which
at least data for a single QoS Flow is subject to data forwarding.
\- In case of direct data forwarding, the source NG-RAN node receives a
TEID/TNL address for each E-RAB accepted for data forwarding as assigned by
the target eNB.
#### 9.3.2.5 Data Forwarding for the User Plane
In case of indirect data forwarding, user plane handling for inter-System data
forwarding from 5GS to EPS follows the following key principles:
\- For the QoS flows accepted for data forwarding, the NG-RAN node initiates
data forwarding to the UPF by the corresponding PDU session data forwarding
tunnel(s).
\- The UPF maps forwarded data received from the per PDU session data
forwarding tunnel(s) to the mapped EPS bearer(s) removing the QFI.
\- Handling of end marker packets:
\- The source NG-RAN node receives one or several end marker packets per PDU
session from the UPF. When there are no more data packets to be forwarded for
QoS flows mapped to an E-RAB, the source NG-RAN node sends one or several end
markers including one QFI (by means of the PDU Session User Plane protocol TS
38.415 [30]) of those QoS flows mapped to that E-RAB and sends the end marker
packets to the UPF over the PDU session tunnel. From the included QFI in the
end markers and its mapping to an EPS bearer ID, the UPF knows which EPS
bearer tunnel it needs to forward the end-markers to the SGW. The QFI is
removed in the end marker packets sent to the SGW.
In case of direct data forwarding, user plane handling for inter-System data
forwarding from 5GS to EPS follows the following key principles:
\- For the QoS flows accepted for data forwarding, the source NG-RAN node maps
data received from the NG-U PDU session tunnel to the respective E-RAB data
forwarding tunnel and forwards each user packet as PDCP SDU without PDCP SN
and QFI information.
\- The source NG-RAN node receives one or several GTP-U end marker packets per
PDU session from the UPF and replicates the end marker packets into each E-RAB
data forwarding tunnel when no more user data packets are to be forwarded over
that tunnel.
### 9.3.3 NR-E-UTRA mobility: From EPC to 5GC
#### 9.3.3.1 Data Forwarding for the Control Plane
Control plane handling for inter-System data forwarding from EPS to 5GS
follows the following key principles:
\- Only forwarding of downlink data is supported.
\- The target NG-RAN node receives in the Handover Request message the mapping
between E-RAB ID(s) and QoS Flow ID(s). It decides whether to accept the data
forwarding for E-RAB IDs proposed for forwarding within the Source NG-RAN Node
to Target NG-RAN Node Transparent Container. Based on availability of direct
data forwarding path the source eNB may request to apply direct data
forwarding by indicating direct data forwarding availability to the CN.
\- In case of indirect data forwarding:
\- The target NG-RAN node assigns a TEID/TNL address for each PDU session for
which at least one QoS flow is involved in the accepted data forwarding.
\- The target NG-RAN node sends the Handover Request Acknowledge message in
which it indicates the list of PDU sessions and QoS flows for which it has
accepted the data forwarding.
\- A single data forwarding tunnel is established between the UPF and the
target NG-RAN node per PDU session for which at least data for a single QoS
Flow is subject to data forwarding.
\- The source eNB receives in the Handover Command message the list of E-RAB
IDs for which the target NG-RAN node has accepted data forwarding of
corresponding PDU sessions and QoS flows.
\- In case of direct data forwarding:
\- The source eNB indicates direct path availability to the CN. The source
eNB\'s decision is indicated by the CN to the target NG-RAN node.
\- The target NG-RAN node assigns a TEID/TNL address for each E-RAB it
accepted for data forwarding.
\- The source eNB receives in the Handover Command message the list of E-RAB
IDs for which the target NG-RAN node has accepted data forwarding.
#### 9.3.3.2 Data Forwarding for the User Plane
In case of indirect data forwarding, user plane handling for inter-System data
forwarding from EPS to 5GS follows the following key principles:
\- For each E-RAB accepted for data forwarding, the source eNB forwards data
to the SGW in the corresponding E-RAB tunnel and the SGW forwards the received
data to the UPF in the E-RAB tunnel.
\- The UPF maps the forwarded data received from an E-RAB tunnel to the
corresponding mapped PDU session tunnel, adding a QFI value (by means of the
PDU Session User Plane protocol TS 38.415 [30]).
\- The target NG-RAN node maps a forwarded packet to the corresponding DRB
based on the received QFI value. It prioritizes the forwarded packets over the
fresh packets for those QoS flows.
\- Handling of end marker packets:
\- The UPF/PGW-U sends one or several end marker packets to the SGW per EPS
bearer. The SGW forwards the received end markers per EPS bearer to the source
eNB. When there are no more data packets to be forwarded for an E-RAB, the
source eNB forwards the received end markers in the EPS bearer tunnel to the
SGW and the SGW forwards them to the UPF. The UPF adds one QFI (by means of
the PDU Session User Plane protocol TS 38.415 [30]) among the QoS flows mapped
to that E-RAB to the end markers and sends those end markers to the target NG-
RAN node in the per PDU session tunnel. When the target NG-RAN node receives
an end marker with a QFI added, the target NG-RAN node starts to transmit the
data packets of all QoS flows mapped to the corresponding E-RAB received from
the core network towards the UE.
In case of direct data forwarding, user plane handling for inter-System data
forwarding from EPS to 5GS follows the following key principles:
\- For each E-RAB accepted for data forwarding, the source node forwards data
to the target NG-RAN node in the corresponding E-RAB data forwarding tunnel.
\- Until a GTP-U end marker packet is received, the target NG-RAN node
prioritizes the forwarded packets over the fresh packets for those QoS flows
which are involved in the accepted data forwarding.
NOTE: The target NG-RAN node should remove the forwarded PDCP SNs if received
in the forwarded GTP-U packets, and deliver the forwarded PDCP SDUs to the UE.
### 9.3.4 NR-UTRA mobility
#### 9.3.4.1 Handover with SRVCC operation
The source NR node decides to handover the UE with ongoing IMS voice from NR
to UTRAN according the following principles:
\- The source NR node determines that the UE supports UTRA and requests the UE
to send its UTRA radio access capabilities to the NG-RAN;
\- The source NR node configures target RAT measurement and reporting;
\- The source NR node determines based on the radio conditions and the
indication that SRVCC operation is possible that handover to UTRAN should be
initiated;
\- The source NR node initiates the handover preparation only for the ongoing
IMS voice and provides the indication to AMF that the handover is towards
UTRAN together with the target UTRAN Node ID. The source NR node also provides
an indication to the target UTRAN that the incoming handover originates from
5G. The SRVCC proceeds as specified in TS 23.216 [34];
\- The source NR node ensures that the size of the source-to-target container
does not exceed the limits that can be handled by the interfaces involved in
the handover;
NOTE: For SRVCC handover, the size limit of the inter-node source-to-target
container is 2560 octets (see AN-APDU in TS 29.002 [44]).
\- Radio resources are prepared in the target RAT before the handover;
\- The RRC reconfiguration message from the target RAT is delivered to the
source NR node via a transparent container and is passed to the UE by the
source NR node in the handover command;
\- In-sequence and lossless handovers are not supported;
\- Only voice bearer is handed over to target RAT;
\- Security procedures for handover to UTRA follows the procedures as
specified in TS 33.501 [5];
\- Only handover to UTRA-FDD is supported.
#### 9.3.4.2 Measurements
Inter RAT measurements are performed for UTRA.
## 9.4 Roaming and Access Restrictions
The roaming and access restriction information for a UE includes information
on restrictions to be applied for subsequent mobility action during CM-
CONNECTED state. It may be provided by the AMF and also may be updated by the
AMF later.
It includes the forbidden RAT, the forbidden area and the service area
restrictions as specified in TS 23.501 [3]. It also includes serving PLMN/SNPN
and may include a list of equivalent PLMNs. It may also include PNI-NPN
mobility restrictions (i.e. list of CAGs allowed for the UE and whether the UE
can also access non-CAG cells). The gNB shall consider that roaming or access
to CAG cells is only allowed if PNI-NPN mobility information is available for
the UE.
Upon receiving the roaming and access restriction information for a UE, if
applicable, the gNB should use it to determine whether to apply restriction
handling for subsequent mobility action, e.g., handover, redirection.
If the roaming and access restriction information is not available for a UE at
the gNB, the gNB shall consider that there is no restriction for subsequent
mobility actions except for the PNI-NPN mobility as described in TS 23.501
[3].
Only if received over NG or Xn signalling, the roaming and access restriction
information shall be propagated over Xn by the source gNB during Xn handover.
If the Xn handover results in a change of serving PLMN (to an equivalent
PLMN), the source gNB shall replace the serving PLMN with the identity of the
target PLMN and move the serving PLMN to the equivalent PLMN list, before
propagating the roaming and access restriction information.
If NG-RAN nodes with different versions of the XnAP or NGAP protocol are
deployed, information provided by the 5GC within the NGAP Mobility Restriction
List may be lost in the course of Xn mobility. In order to avoid such loss of
information at Xn handover or UE context retrieval due to a source NG-RAN node
or an old NG-RAN node not able to recognise the entire content, the source NG-
RAN node or the old NG-RAN node may provide an 5GC Mobility Restriction List
Container to the target NG-RAN node or the new NG-RAN node, containing the
Mobility Restriction List as received from the 5GC. The target NG-RAN node or
the new NG-RAN node shall use the information contained in the 5GC Mobility
Restriction List Container as the Mobility Restriction List, except for the
Serving PLMN and the Equivalent PLMNs, which the NG-RAN node shall use from
the XnAP Mobility Restriction List. The 5GC Mobility Restriction List
Container may be propagated at future Xn handover and UE context retrieval.
# 10 Scheduling
## 10.1 Basic Scheduler Operation
In order to utilise radio resources efficiently, MAC in gNB includes dynamic
resource schedulers that allocate physical layer resources for the downlink
and the uplink. In this clause, an overview of the scheduler is given in terms
of scheduler operation, signalling of scheduler decisions, and measurements.
Scheduler Operation:
\- Taking into account the UE buffer status and the QoS requirements of each
UE and associated radio bearers, schedulers assign resources between UEs;
\- Schedulers may assign resources taking account the radio conditions at the
UE identified through measurements made at the gNB and/or reported by the UE;
\- Resource assignment consists of radio resources (resource blocks).
Signalling of Scheduler Decisions:
\- UEs identify the resources by receiving a scheduling (resource assignment)
channel.
Measurements to Support Scheduler Operation:
\- Uplink buffer status reports (measuring the data that is buffered in the
logical channel queues in the UE) are used to provide support for QoS-aware
packet scheduling;
\- Power headroom reports (measuring the difference between the nominal UE
maximum transmit power and the estimated power for uplink transmission) are
used to provide support for power aware packet scheduling.
## 10.2 Downlink Scheduling
In the downlink, the gNB can dynamically allocate resources to UEs via the
C-RNTI on PDCCH(s). A UE always monitors the PDCCH(s) in order to find
possible assignments when its downlink reception is enabled (activity governed
by DRX when configured). When CA is configured, the same C-RNTI applies to all
serving cells.
The gNB may pre-empt an ongoing PDSCH transmission to one UE with a latency-
critical transmission to another UE. The gNB can configure UEs to monitor
interrupted transmission indications using INT-RNTI on a PDCCH. If a UE
receives the interrupted transmission indication, the UE may assume that no
useful information to that UE was carried by the resource elements included in
the indication, even if some of those resource elements were already scheduled
to this UE.
In addition, with Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS), the gNB can allocate
downlink resources for the initial HARQ transmissions to UEs: RRC defines the
periodicity of the configured downlink assignments while PDCCH addressed to
CS-RNTI can either signal and activate the configured downlink assignment, or
deactivate it; i.e. a PDCCH addressed to CS-RNTI indicates that the downlink
assignment can be implicitly reused according to the periodicity defined by
RRC, until deactivated.
NOTE: When required, retransmissions are explicitly scheduled on PDCCH(s).
The dynamically allocated downlink reception overrides the configured downlink
assignment in the same serving cell, if they overlap in time. Otherwise a
downlink reception according to the configured downlink assignment is assumed,
if activated.
The UE may be configured with up to 8 active configured downlink assignments
for a given BWP of a serving cell. When more than one is configured:
\- The network decides which of these configured downlink assignments are
active at a time (including all of them); and
\- Each configured downlink assignment is activated separately using a DCI
command and deactivation of configured downlink assignments is done using a
DCI command, which can either deactivate a single configured downlink
assignment or multiple configured downlink assignments jointly.
## 10.3 Uplink Scheduling
In the uplink, the gNB can dynamically allocate resources to UEs via the
C-RNTI on PDCCH(s). A UE always monitors the PDCCH(s) in order to find
possible grants for uplink transmission when its downlink reception is enabled
(activity governed by DRX when configured). When CA is configured, the same
C-RNTI applies to all serving cells.
The gNB may cancel a PUSCH transmission, or a repetition of a PUSCH
transmission, or an SRS transmission of a UE for another UE with a latency-
critical transmission. The gNB can configure UEs to monitor cancelled
transmission indications using CI-RNTI on a PDCCH. If a UE receives the
cancelled transmission indication, the UE shall cancel the PUSCH transmission
from the earliest symbol overlapped with the resource or the SRS transmission
overlapped with the resource indicated by cancellation (see clause 11.2A of TS
38.213 [38]).
In addition, with Configured Grants, the gNB can allocate uplink resources for
the initial HARQ transmissions and HARQ retransmissions to UEs. Two types of
configured uplink grants are defined:
\- With Type 1, RRC directly provides the configured uplink grant (including
the periodicity).
\- With Type 2, RRC defines the periodicity of the configured uplink grant
while PDCCH addressed to CS-RNTI can either signal and activate the configured
uplink grant, or deactivate it; i.e. a PDCCH addressed to CS-RNTI indicates
that the uplink grant can be implicitly reused according to the periodicity
defined by RRC, until deactivated.
If the UE is not configured with enhanced intra-UE overlapping resources
prioritization, the dynamically allocated uplink transmission overrides the
configured uplink grant in the same serving cell, if they overlap in time.
Otherwise an uplink transmission according to the configured uplink grant is
assumed, if activated.
If the UE is configured with enhanced intra-UE overlapping resources
prioritization, in case a configured uplink grant transmission overlaps in
time with dynamically allocated uplink transmission or with another configured
uplink grant transmission in the same serving cell, the UE prioritizes the
transmission based on the comparison between the highest priority of the
logical channels that have data to be transmitted and which are multiplexed or
can be multiplexed in MAC PDUs associated with the overlapping resources.
Similarly, in case a configured uplink grant transmissions or a dynamically
allocated uplink transmission overlaps in time with a scheduling request
transmission, the UE prioritizes the transmission based on the comparison
between the priority of the logical channel which triggered the scheduling
request and the highest priority of the logical channels that have data to be
transmitted and which are multiplexed or can be multiplexed in MAC PDU
associated with the overlapping resource. In case the MAC PDU associated with
a deprioritized transmission has already been generated, the UE keeps it
stored to allow the gNB to schedule a retransmission. The UE may also be
configured by the gNB to transmit the stored MAC PDU as a new transmission
using a subsequent resource of the same configured uplink grant configuration
when an explicit retransmission grant is not provided by the gNB.
Retransmissions other than repetitions are explicitly allocated via PDCCH(s)
or via configuration of a retransmission timer.
The UE may be configured with up to 12 active configured uplink grants for a
given BWP of a serving cell. When more than one is configured, the network
decides which of these configured uplink grants are active at a time
(including all of them). Each configured uplink grant can either be of Type 1
or Type 2. For Type 2, activation and deactivation of configured uplink grants
are independent among the serving cells. When more than one Type 2 configured
grant is configured, each configured grant is activated separately using a DCI
command and deactivation of Type 2 configured grants is done using a DCI
command, which can either deactivate a single configured grant configuration
or multiple configured grant configurations jointly.
When SUL is configured, the network should ensure that an active configured
uplink grant on SUL does not overlap in time with another active configured
uplink grant on the other UL configuration.
For both dynamic grant and configured grant, for a transport block, two or
more repetitions can be in one slot, or across slot boundary in consecutive
available slots with each repetition in one slot. For both dynamic grant and
configured grant Type 2, the number of repetitions can be also dynamically
indicated in the L1 signalling. The dynamically indicated number of
repetitions shall override the RRC configured number of repetitions, if both
are present.
## 10.4 Measurements to Support Scheduler Operation
Measurement reports are required to enable the scheduler to operate in both
uplink and downlink. These include transport volume and measurements of a UEs
radio environment.
Uplink buffer status reports (BSR) are needed to provide support for QoS-aware
packet scheduling. In NR, uplink buffer status reports refer to the data that
is buffered in for a group of logical channels (LCG) in the UE. Four formats
are used for reporting in uplink:
\- A short format to report only one BSR (of one LCG);
\- A flexible long format to report several BSRs (up to all eight LCGs);
\- An extended short format to report one BSR (of one LCG);
\- An extended long format to report several BSRs (up to all 256 LCGs).
NOTE: The Extended versions of the BSR formats can only be used by IAB nodes.
Uplink buffer status reports are transmitted using MAC signalling. When a BSR
is triggered (e.g. when new data arrives in the transmission buffers of the
UE), a Scheduling Request (SR) can be transmitted by the UE (e.g. when no
resources are available to transmit the BSR).
For IAB, the Pre-emptive BSR can be configured on the backhaul links. The Pre-
emptive BSR is sent based on expected data rather than buffered data, as
described in clause 4.7.3.3.
Power headroom reports (PHR) are needed to provide support for power-aware
packet scheduling. In NR, three types of reporting are supported: a first one
for PUSCH transmission, a second one for PUSCH and PUCCH transmission in an
LTE Cell Group in EN-DC (see TS 37.340 [21]) and a third one for SRS
transmission on SCells configured with SRS only. In case of CA, when no
transmission takes place on an activated SCell, a reference power is used to
provide a virtual report. To allow network to detect UL power reduction, the
PHR reports may also contain Power Management Maximum Power Reduction (P-MPR,
see TS 38.101-2 [35]) information that UE uses to ensure UE compliance with
the Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) exposure regulation for FR2, which is
set for limiting RF exposure on human body. Power headroom reports are
transmitted using MAC signalling.
## 10.5 Rate Control
### 10.5.1 Downlink
In downlink, for GBR flows, the gNB guarantees the GFBR and ensures that the
MFBR is not exceeded while for non-GBR flows, it ensures that the UE-AMBR is
not exceeded (see clause 12). When configured for a GBR flow, the gNB also
ensures that the MDBV is not exceeded. When received and supported, the gNB in
addition ensures that the UE-Slice-MBR is not exceeded as specified in TS
23.501 [3].
### 10.5.2 Uplink
The UE has an uplink rate control function which manages the sharing of uplink
resources between logical channels. RRC controls the uplink rate control
function by giving each logical channel a priority, a prioritised bit rate
(PBR), and a buffer size duration (BSD). The values signalled need not be
related to the ones signalled via NG to the gNB. In addition, mapping
restrictions can be configured (see clause 16.1.2).
The uplink rate control function ensures that the UE serves the logical
channel(s) in the following sequence:
1\. All relevant logical channels in decreasing priority order up to their
PBR;
2\. All relevant logical channels in decreasing priority order for the
remaining resources assigned by the grant.
NOTE 1: In case the PBRs are all set to zero, the first step is skipped and
the logical channels are served in strict priority order: the UE maximises the
transmission of higher priority data.
NOTE 2: The mapping restrictions tell the UE which logical channels are
relevant for the grant received. If no mapping restrictions are configured,
all logical channels are considered.
NOTE 3: Through radio protocol configuration and scheduling, the gNB can
guarantee the GFBR(s) and ensure that any of the MFBR(s), the UE-AMBR and,
when supported and feasible, the UE-Slice-MBR is not exceeded in uplink (see
clause 12).
NOTE 4: The mapping restrictions allows the gNB to fulfil the MDBV
requirements through scheduling at least for the case where logical channels
are mapped to separate serving cells.
If more than one logical channel have the same priority, the UE shall serve
them equally.
## 10.6 Activation/Deactivation Mechanism
To enable reasonable UE battery consumption when CA is configured, an
activation/deactivation mechanism of Cells is supported. When an SCell is
deactivated, the UE does not need to receive the corresponding PDCCH or PDSCH,
cannot transmit in the corresponding uplink, nor is it required to perform CQI
measurements. Conversely, when an SCell is active, the UE shall receive PDSCH
and PDCCH (if the UE is configured to monitor PDCCH from this SCell) and is
expected to be able to perform CQI measurements. NG-RAN ensures that while
PUCCH SCell (a Secondary Cell configured with PUCCH) is deactivated, SCells of
secondary PUCCH group (a group of SCells whose PUCCH signalling is associated
with the PUCCH on the PUCCH SCell) should not be activated. NG-RAN ensures
that SCells mapped to PUCCH SCell are deactivated before the PUCCH SCell is
changed or removed.
When reconfiguring the set of serving cells:
\- SCells added to the set are initially activated or deactivated;
\- SCells which remain in the set (either unchanged or reconfigured) do not
change their activation status (_activated_ or _deactivated_).
At handover or connection resume from RRC_INACTIVE:
\- SCells are activated or deactivated.
To enable reasonable UE battery consumption when BA is configured, only one UL
BWP for each uplink carrier and one DL BWP or only one DL/UL BWP pair can be
active at a time in an active serving cell, all other BWPs that the UE is
configured with being deactivated. On deactivated BWPs, the UE does not
monitor the PDCCH, does not transmit on PUCCH, PRACH and UL-SCH.
To enable fast SCell activation when CA is configured, one dormant BWP can be
configured for an SCell. If the active BWP of the activated SCell is a dormant
BWP, the UE stops monitoring PDCCH and transmitting SRS/PUSCH/PUCCH on the
SCell but continues performing CSI measurements, AGC and beam management, if
configured. A DCI is used to control entering/leaving the dormant BWP for one
or more SCell(s) or one or more SCell group(s).
The dormant BWP is one of the UE\'s dedicated BWPs configured by network via
dedicated RRC signalling. The SpCell and PUCCH SCell cannot be configured with
a dormant BWP.
To enable fast SCell activation when CA is configured, aperiodic CSI-RS for
tracking for fast SCell activation can be configured for an SCell to assist
AGC and time/frequency synchronization. A MAC CE is used to trigger activation
of one or more SCell(s) and trigger the aperiodic CSI-RS for tracking for fast
SCell activation for a (set of) deactivated SCell(s).
## 10.7 E-UTRA-NR Cell Resource Coordination
An NR cell may use spectrum that overlaps or is adjacent to spectrum in use
for E-UTRA cells. In this case network signalling enables coordination of TDM
and FDM cell resources between MAC in the gNB and the corresponding entity in
the ng-eNB. Both the gNB and the ng-eNB can trigger the E-UTRA - NR Cell
Resource Coordination procedure over Xn to its peer node.
## 10.8 Cross Carrier Scheduling
Cross-carrier scheduling with the Carrier Indicator Field (CIF) allows the
PDCCH of a serving cell to schedule resources on another serving cell but with
the following restrictions:
\- When cross-carrier scheduling from an SCell to PCell is not configured,
PCell can only be scheduled via its PDCCH;
\- When cross-carrier scheduling from an SCell to PCell is configured:
\- PDCCH on that SCell can schedule PCell\'s PDSCH and PUSCH;
\- PDCCH on the PCell can schedule PCell\'s PDSCH and PUSCH but cannot
schedule PDSCH and PUSCH on any other cell;
\- Only one SCell can be configured to be used for cross-carrier scheduling to
PCell.
\- When an SCell is configured with a PDCCH, that cell\'s PDSCH and PUSCH are
always scheduled by the PDCCH on this SCell;
\- When an SCell is not configured with a PDCCH, that SCell\'s PDSCH and PUSCH
are always scheduled by a PDCCH on another serving cell;
\- The scheduling PDCCH and the scheduled PDSCH/PUSCH can use the same or
different numerologies.
## 10.9 IAB Resource Configuration
If the IAB-DU and the IAB-MT of an IAB-node are subject to a half-duplex
constraint, correct transmission/reception by one cannot be guaranteed during
transmission/reception by the other and vice versa, e.g., when collocated and
operating in the same frequency. If an IAB-node supports enhanced frequency or
spatial multiplexing capabilities, additional multiplexing modes can be
supported, i.e., simultaneous operation of IAB-MT Rx / IAB-DU Rx, IAB-MT Tx /
IAB-DU Tx, IAB-MT Rx / IAB-DU Tx, IAB-MT Tx / IAB-DU Rx. An IAB-node can
report its duplexing constraints between the IAB-MT and the collocated IAB-DU
via F1AP. An IAB-node can indicate via F1AP whether or not FDM is required for
an enhanced multiplexing operation.
The scheduler on an IAB-DU or IAB-donor-DU complies with the gNB-DU resource
configuration received via F1AP, which defines the usage of scheduling
resources to account for the aforementioned duplexing constraint.
The resource configuration assigns an attribute of hard, soft or unavailable
to each symbol of each DU cell. Transmission/reception can occur for symbols
configured as hard, whereas scheduling cannot occur, except for some special
cases, for symbols configures as unavailable. For symbols configured as soft,
scheduling can occur conditionally on an explicit indication of availability
by the parent node via DCI format 2_5, or on an implicit determination of
availability by the IAB-node. The implicit determination of availability is
determined by the IAB-node depending on whether or not the operation of the
IAB-DU would have an impact on the collocated IAB-MT.
The resource configuration can be shared among neighbouring IAB-nodes and IAB-
donors to facilitate interference management, dual connectivity, and enhanced
multiplexing.
To facilitate transitioning from IAB-MT to IAB-DU operation and vice versa,
guard symbols can be used to overcome potentially misaligned symbol boundaries
between the IAB-MT operation and the IAB-DU operation (e.g., IAB-MT Rx
boundaries are not aligned with the IAB-DU Tx boundaries). Specifically, an
IAB-node can indicate to a parent node a number of desired guard symbols,
while the parent node can indicate to the IAB-node the number of actually
provided guard symbols for specific transitions.
An IAB-node supporting enhanced multiplexing capabilities, i.e., IAB-MT Rx /
IAB-DU Rx, IAB-MT Tx / IAB-DU Tx, IAB-MT Rx / IAB-DU Tx, IAB-MT Tx / IAB-DU
Rx, can provide via MAC-CE to a parent node information to facilitate
scheduling for enhanced multiplexing operation by the IAB-node, specifically:
\- recommended IAB-MT\'s Tx/Rx beams;
\- desired IAB-MT Tx PSD range;
\- desired parent node\'s IAB-DU Tx power adjustment;
\- required IAB-MT\'s uplink transmission timing mode.
Correspondingly, the parent node can provide information via MAC-CE to the
IAB-node to facilitate enhanced multiplexing at the IAB-node and/or at the
parent node:
\- restricted IAB-DU Tx beams;
\- actual parent node\'s IAB-DU Tx power adjustment;
\- IAB-MT\'s uplink transmission timing mode.
# 11 UE Power Saving
The PDCCH monitoring activity of the UE in RRC connected mode is governed by
DRX, BA, and DCP.
When DRX is configured, the UE does not have to continuously monitor PDCCH.
DRX is characterized by the following:
\- **on-duration** : duration that the UE waits for, after waking up, to
receive PDCCHs. If the UE successfully decodes a PDCCH, the UE stays awake and
starts the inactivity timer;
\- **inactivity-timer** : duration that the UE waits to successfully decode a
PDCCH, from the last successful decoding of a PDCCH, failing which it can go
back to sleep. The UE shall restart the inactivity timer following a single
successful decoding of a PDCCH for a first transmission only (i.e. not for
retransmissions);
\- **retransmission-timer** : duration until a retransmission can be expected;
\- **cycle** : specifies the periodic repetition of the on-duration followed
by a possible period of inactivity (see figure 11-1 below);
**\- active-time** : total duration that the UE monitors PDCCH. This includes
the \"on-duration\" of the DRX cycle, the time UE is performing continuous
reception while the inactivity timer has not expired, and the time when the UE
is performing continuous reception while waiting for a retransmission
opportunity.
Figure 11-1: DRX Cycle
A SL UE can be configured with DRX, in which case, PDCCH providing SL grants
can be send to the UE only during its active time.
When BA is configured, the UE only has to monitor PDCCH on the one active BWP
i.e. it does not have to monitor PDCCH on the entire DL frequency of the cell.
A BWP inactivity timer (independent from the DRX inactivity-timer described
above) is used to switch the active BWP to the default one: the timer is
restarted upon successful PDCCH decoding and the switch to the default BWP
takes place when it expires.
In addition, the UE may be indicated, when configured accordingly, whether it
is required to monitor or not the PDCCH during the next occurrence of the on-
duration by a DCP monitored on the active BWP. If the UE does not detect a DCP
on the active BWP, it does not monitor the PDCCH during the next occurrence of
the on-duration, unless it is explicitly configured to do so in that case.
A UE can only be configured to monitor DCP **when connected mode DRX is
configured, and at occasion(s)** at a configured offset before the on-
duration. More than one monitoring occasion can be configured before the on-
duration. The UE does not monitor DCP on occasions occurring during active-
time, measurement gaps, BWP switching, or when it monitors response for a CFRA
preamble transmission for beam failure recovery (see clause 9.2.6), in which
case it monitors the PDCCH during the next on-duration. If no DCP is
configured in the active BWP, UE follows normal DRX operation.
When CA is configured, DCP is only configured on the PCell.
One DCP can be configured to control PDCCH monitoring during on-duration for
one or more UEs independently.
Power saving in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE can also be achieved by UE relaxing
neighbour cells RRM measurements when it meets the criteria determining it is
in low mobility and/or not at cell edge.
UE power saving may be enabled by adapting the DL maximum number of MIMO
layers by BWP switching.
Power saving is also enabled during active-time via cross-slot scheduling,
which facilitates UE to achieve power saving with the assumption that it
won\'t be scheduled to receive PDSCH, triggered to receive A-CSI or transmit a
PUSCH scheduled by the PDCCH until the minimum scheduling offsets K0 and K2.
Dynamic adaptation of the minimum scheduling offsets K0 and K2 is controlled
by PDCCH.
Serving Cells of a MAC entity may be configured by RRC in two DRX groups with
separate DRX parameters. When RRC does not configure a secondary DRX group,
there is only one DRX group and all Serving Cells belong to that one DRX
group. When two DRX groups are configured, each Serving Cell is uniquely
assigned to either of the two groups. The DRX parameters that are separately
configured for each DRX group are on-duration and inactivity-timer.
UE power saving in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE may be achieved by providing the
configuration for TRS with CSI-RS for tracking in TRS occasions. The TRS in
TRS occasions may allow UEs in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE to sleep longer before
waking-up for its paging occasion. The TRS occasions configuration is provided
in SIB17. The availability of TRS in the TRS occasions is indicated by L1
availability indication. These TRSs may also be used by the UEs configured
with eDRX.
UE power saving may be achieved by UE relaxing measurements for RLM/BFD. When
configured, UE determines whether it is in low mobility state and/or whether
its serving cell radio link quality is better than a threshold. The
configuration for low mobility and good serving cell quality criterion is
provided through dedicated RRC signalling.
RLM and BFD relaxation may be enabled/disabled separately through RRC
Configuration. Additionally, RLM relaxation may be enabled/disabled on per
Cell Group basis while BFD relaxation may be enabled/disabled on per serving
cell basis.
The UE is only allowed to perform RLM and/or BFD relaxation when relaxed
measurement criterion for low mobility and/or for good serving cell quality is
met. If configured to do so, the UE shall trigger reporting of its RLM and/or
BFD relaxation status through UE assistance information if the UE changes its
respective RLM and/or BFD relaxation status while meeting the UE minimum
requirements specified in TS 38.133 [13].
UE power saving may also be achieved through PDCCH monitoring adaptation
mechanisms when configured by the network, including skipping of PDCCH
monitoring and Search space set group (SSSG) switching. In this case UE does
not monitor PDCCH during the PDCCH skipping duration except for the cases as
specified in TS 38.213 [38], or monitors PDCCH according to the search space
sets applied in SSSG.
# 12 QoS
## 12.1 Overview
The **5G QoS model** is based on QoS Flows (see TS 23.501 [3]) and supports
both QoS Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS Flows) and QoS
Flows that do not require guaranteed flow bit rate (non-GBR QoS Flows). At NAS
level (see TS 23.501 [3]), the QoS flow is thus the finest granularity of QoS
differentiation in a PDU session. A QoS flow is identified within a PDU
session by a QoS Flow ID (QFI) carried in an encapsulation header over NG-U.
The **QoS architecture** in NG-RAN, both for NR connected to 5GC and for
E-UTRA connected to 5GC, is depicted in the Figure 12-1 and described in the
following:
\- For each UE, 5GC establishes one or more PDU Sessions;
\- Except for NB-IoT and IAB-MT in SA mode, for each UE, the NG-RAN
establishes at least one Data Radio Bearers (DRB) together with the PDU
Session and additional DRB(s) for QoS flow(s) of that PDU session can be
subsequently configured (it is up to NG-RAN when to do so);
\- If NB-IoT UE supports NG-U data transfer, the NG-RAN may establish Data
Radio Bearers (DRB) together with the PDU Session and one PDU session maps to
only one DRB;
\- The NG-RAN maps packets belonging to different PDU sessions to different
DRBs;
\- NAS level packet filters in the UE and in the 5GC associate UL and DL
packets with QoS Flows;
\- AS-level mapping rules in the UE and in the NG-RAN associate UL and DL QoS
Flows with DRBs.
Figure 12-1: QoS architecture
NG-RAN and 5GC ensure quality of service (e.g. reliability and target delay)
by mapping packets to appropriate QoS Flows and DRBs. Hence there is a 2-step
mapping of IP-flows to QoS flows (NAS) and from QoS flows to DRBs (Access
Stratum).
At **NAS level** , a QoS flow is characterised by a QoS profile provided by
5GC to NG-RAN and QoS rule(s) provided by 5GC to the UE. The QoS profile is
used by NG-RAN to determine the treatment on the radio interface while the QoS
rules dictates the mapping between uplink User Plane traffic and QoS flows to
the UE. A QoS flow may either be GBR or Non-GBR depending on its profile. The
QoS profile of a QoS flow contains QoS parameters, for instance (see TS 23.501
[3]):
\- For each QoS flow:
\- A 5G QoS Identifier (5QI);
\- An Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).
\- In case of a GBR QoS flow only:
\- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) for both uplink and downlink;
\- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) for both uplink and downlink;
\- Maximum Packet Loss Rate for both uplink and downlink;
\- Delay Critical Resource Type;
\- Notification Control.
NOTE: The Maximum Packet Loss Rate (UL, DL) is only provided for a GBR QoS
flow belonging to voice media.
\- In case of Non-GBR QoS only:
\- Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA): the RQA, when included, indicates that some
(not necessarily all) traffic carried on this QoS flow is subject to
reflective quality of service (RQoS) at NAS;
\- Additional QoS Flow Information.
The QoS parameter Notification Control indicates whether notifications are
requested from the RAN when the GFBR can no longer (or again) be fulfilled for
a QoS Flow. If, for a given GBR QoS Flow, notification control is enabled and
the RAN determines that the GFBR cannot be guaranteed, RAN shall send a
notification towards SMF and keep the QoS Flow (i.e. while the NG-RAN is not
delivering the requested GFBR for this QoS Flow), unless specific conditions
at the NG-RAN require the release of the NG-RAN resources for this GBR QoS
Flow, e.g. due to Radio link failure or RAN internal congestion. When
applicable, NG-RAN sends a new notification, informing SMF that the GFBR can
be guaranteed again.
If Alternative QoS parameters Sets are received with the Notification Control
parameter, the NG-RAN may also include in the notification a reference
corresponding to the QoS Parameter Set which it can currently fulfil as
specified in TS 23.501 [3]. The target NG-RAN node may include in the
notification control indication the reference to the QoS Parameter Set which
it can currently fulfil over Xn to the source NG-RAN node during handover.
In addition, an Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate is associated to each PDU session
(Session-AMBR), to each UE (UE-AMBR) and to each slice per UE (UE-Slice-MBR).
The Session-AMBR limits the aggregate bit rate that can be expected to be
provided across all Non-GBR QoS Flows for a specific PDU Session and is
ensured by the UPF. The UE-AMBR limits the aggregate bit rate that can be
expected to be provided across all Non-GBR QoS Flows of a UE and is ensured by
the RAN (see clause 10.5.1). The UE-Slice-MBR limits the aggregate bit rate
that can be expected to be provided across all GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows
corresponding to PDU Sessions of the UE for the same slice (S-NSSAI) as
specified in TS 23.501 [3] and is ensured by the RAN (see clause 10.5.1).
The 5QI is associated to QoS characteristics giving guidelines for setting
node specific parameters for each QoS Flow. Standardized or pre-configured 5G
QoS characteristics are derived from the 5QI value and are not explicitly
signalled. Signalled QoS characteristics are included as part of the QoS
profile. The QoS characteristics consist for instance of (see TS 23.501 [3]):
\- Priority level;
\- Packet Delay Budget (including Core Network Packet Delay Budget);
\- Packet Error Rate;
\- Averaging window;
\- Maximum Data Burst Volume.
At **Access Stratum** level, the data radio bearer (DRB) defines the packet
treatment on the radio interface (Uu). A DRB serves packets with the same
packet forwarding treatment. The QoS flow to DRB mapping by NG-RAN is based on
QFI and the associated QoS profiles (i.e. QoS parameters and QoS
characteristics). Separate DRBs may be established for QoS flows requiring
different packet forwarding treatment, or several QoS Flows **belonging to the
same PDU session** can be multiplexed in the same DRB.
In the uplink, the mapping of QoS Flows to DRBs is controlled by mapping rules
which are signalled in two different ways:
\- Reflective mapping: for each DRB, the UE monitors the QFI(s) of the
downlink packets and applies the same mapping in the uplink; that is, for a
DRB, the UE maps the uplink packets belonging to the QoS flows(s)
corresponding to the QFI(s) and PDU Session observed in the downlink packets
for that DRB. To enable this reflective mapping, the NG-RAN marks downlink
packets over Uu with QFI.
\- Explicit Configuration: QoS flow to DRB mapping rules can be explicitly
signalled by RRC.
The UE always applies the latest update of the mapping rules regardless of
whether it is performed via reflecting mapping or explicit configuration.
When a QoS flow to DRB mapping rule is updated, the UE sends an end marker on
the old bearer.
In the downlink, the QFI is signalled by NG-RAN over Uu for the purpose of
RQoS and if neither NG-RAN, nor the NAS (as indicated by the RQA) intend to
use reflective mapping for the QoS flow(s) carried in a DRB, no QFI is
signalled for that DRB over Uu. In the uplink, NG-RAN can configure the UE to
signal QFI over Uu.
For each PDU session, a default DRB may be configured: if an incoming UL
packet matches neither an RRC configured nor a reflective mapping rule, the UE
then maps that packet to the default DRB of the PDU session. For non-GBR QoS
flows, the 5GC may send to the NG-RAN the Additional QoS Flow Information
parameter associated with certain QoS flows to indicate that traffic is likely
to appear more often on them compared to other non-GBR QoS flows established
on the same PDU session.
Within each PDU session, it is up to NG-RAN how to map multiple QoS flows to a
DRB. The NG-RAN may map a GBR flow and a non-GBR flow, or more than one GBR
flow to the same DRB, but mechanisms to optimise these cases are not within
the scope of standardization.
## 12.2 Explicit Congestion Notification
The gNB and the UE support of the Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is
specified in clause 5 of [27].
# 13 Security
## 13.1 Overview and Principles
The following principles apply to NR connected to 5GC security, see TS 33.501
[5]:
\- For user data (DRBs), ciphering provides user data confidentiality and
integrity protection provides user data integrity;
\- For RRC signalling (SRBs), ciphering provides signalling data
confidentiality and integrity protection signalling data integrity;
NOTE: Ciphering and integrity protections are optionally configured except for
RRC signalling for which integrity protection is always configured. Ciphering
and integrity protection can be configured per DRB but all DRBs belonging to a
PDU session for which the User Plane Security Enforcement information
indicates that UP integrity protection is required (see TS 23.502 [22]), are
configured with integrity protection.
\- For key management and data handling, any entity processing cleartext shall
be protected from physical attacks and located in a secure environment;
\- The gNB (AS) keys are cryptographically separated from the 5GC (NAS) keys;
\- Separate AS and NAS level Security Mode Command (SMC) procedures are used;
\- A sequence number (COUNT) is used as input to the ciphering and integrity
protection and a given sequence number must only be used once for a given key
(except for identical re-transmission) on the same radio bearer in the same
direction.
The keys are organised and derived as follows:
\- Key for AMF:
\- K~AMF~ is a key derived by ME and SEAF from K~SEAF~.
\- Keys for NAS signalling:
\- K~NASint~ is a key derived by ME and AMF from K~AMF~, which shall only be
used for the protection of NAS signalling with a particular integrity
algorithm;
\- K~NASenc~ is a key derived by ME and AMF from K~AMF~, which shall only be
used for the protection of NAS signalling with a particular encryption
algorithm.
Key for gNB:
\- K~gNB~ is a key derived by ME and AMF from K~AMF~. K~gNB~ is further
derived by ME and source gNB when performing horizontal or vertical key
derivation.
Keys for UP traffic:
\- K~UPenc~ is a key derived by ME and gNB from K~gNB~, which shall only be
used for the protection of UP traffic between ME and gNB with a particular
encryption algorithm;
\- K~UPint~ is a key derived by ME and gNB from K~gNB~, which shall only be
used for the protection of UP traffic between ME and gNB with a particular
integrity algorithm.
Keys for RRC signalling:
\- K~RRCint~ is a key derived by ME and gNB from K~gNB~, which shall only be
used for the protection of RRC signalling with a particular integrity
algorithm;
\- K~RRCenc~ is a key derived by ME and gNB from K~gNB~, which shall only be
used for the protection of RRC signalling with a particular encryption
algorithm.
Intermediate keys:
\- NH is a key derived by ME and AMF to provide forward security.
\- K~gNB~* is a key derived by ME and gNB when performing a horizontal or
vertical key derivation.
The primary authentication enables mutual authentication between the UE and
the network and provide an anchor key called K~SEAF~. From K~SEAF~, K~AMF~ is
created during e.g. primary authentication or NAS key re-keying and key
refresh events. Based on K~AMF~, K~NASint~ and K~NASenc~ are then derived when
running a successful NAS SMC procedure.
Whenever an initial AS security context needs to be established between UE and
gNB, AMF and the UE derive a K~gNB~ and a Next Hop parameter (NH). The K~gNB~
and the NH are derived from the K~AMF~. A NH Chaining Counter (NCC) is
associated with each K~gNB~ and NH parameter. Every K~gNB~ is associated with
the NCC corresponding to the NH value from which it was derived. At initial
setup, the K~gNB~ is derived directly from K~AMF~, and is then considered to
be associated with a virtual NH parameter with NCC value equal to zero. At
initial setup, the derived NH value is associated with the NCC value one. On
handovers, the basis for the K~gNB~ that will be used between the UE and the
target gNB, called K~gNB~*, is derived from either the currently active K~gNB~
or from the NH parameter. If K~gNB~* is derived from the currently active
K~gNB~, this is referred to as a horizontal key derivation and is indicated to
UE with an NCC that does not increase. If the K~gNB~* is derived from the NH
parameter, the derivation is referred to as a vertical key derivation and is
indicated to UE with an NCC increase. Finally, K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~, K~UPint~
and K~UPenc~ are derived based on K~gNB~ after a new K~gNB~ is derived. This
is depicted on Figure 13.1-1 below:
Figure 13.1-1: 5G Key Derivation
With such key derivation, a gNB with knowledge of a K~gNB~, shared with a UE,
is unable to compute any previous K~gNB~ that has been used between the same
UE and a previous gNB, therefore providing backward security. Similarly, a gNB
with knowledge of a K~gNB~, shared with a UE, is unable to predict any future
K~gNB~ that will be used between the same UE and another gNB after n or more
handovers (since NH parameters are only computable by the UE and the AMF).
The AS SMC procedure is for RRC and UP security algorithms negotiation and RRC
security activation. When AS security context is to be established in the gNB,
the AMF sends the complete UE 5G security capabilities to the gNB (i.e., all
bits for every capability defined in TS 24.501 [28] and received in NAS
signalling). At handover (or at UE Context retrieval), the complete UE 5G
security capabilities are also sent by the source gNB to the target gNB (or by
the last serving gNB to the receiving gNB respectively). The gNB chooses the
ciphering algorithm which has the highest priority from its configured list
and is also present in the UE 5G security capabilities. The gNB also chooses
the integrity algorithm which has the highest priority from its configured
list and is also present in the UE 5G security capabilities. The chosen
algorithms are indicated to the UE in the AS SMC and this message is integrity
protected. RRC downlink ciphering (encryption) at the gNB starts after sending
the AS SMC message. RRC uplink deciphering (decryption) at the gNB starts
after receiving and successful verification of the integrity protected AS
security mode complete message from the UE. The UE verifies the validity of
the AS SMC message from the gNB by verifying the integrity of the received
message. RRC uplink ciphering (encryption) at the UE starts after sending the
AS security mode complete message. RRC downlink deciphering (decryption) at
the UE shall start after receiving and successful verification of the AS SMC
message. The RRC Connection Reconfiguration procedure used to add DRBs shall
be performed only after RRC security has been activated as part of the AS SMC
procedure.
A UE connected to 5GC, shall support integrity protected DRBs at any data
rate, up to and including the highest data rate supported by the UE for both
UL and DL. In case of failed integrity check (i.e. faulty or missing MAC-I),
the concerned PDU shall be discarded by the receiving PDCP entity.
Key refresh is possible for K~gNB~, K~RRC-enc~, K~RRC-int~, K~UP-enc~, and
K~UP-int~ and can be initiated by the gNB when a PDCP COUNTs are about to be
re-used with the same Radio Bearer identity and with the same K~gNB~. Key re-
keying is also possible for the K~gNB~, K~RRC-enc~, K~RRC-int~, K~UP-enc~, and
K~UP-int~ and can be initiated by the AMF when a 5G AS security context
different from the currently active one shall be activated.
## 13.2 Security Termination Points
The table below describes the security termination points.
Table 13.2-1 Security Termination Points
+-------------------+-------------+------------------------+ | | > Ciphering | > Integrity Protection | +-------------------+-------------+------------------------+ | > NAS Signalling | > AMF | > AMF | +-------------------+-------------+------------------------+ | > RRC Signalling | > gNB | > gNB | +-------------------+-------------+------------------------+ | > User Plane Data | > gNB | > gNB | +-------------------+-------------+------------------------+
## 13.3 State Transitions and Mobility
As a general principle, on RRC_IDLE to RRC_CONNECTED transitions, RRC
protection keys and UP protection keys are generated while keys for NAS
protection as well as higher layer keys are assumed to be already available.
These higher layer keys may have been established as a result of an AKA run,
or as a result of a transfer from another AMF during handover or idle mode
mobility see TS 23.502 [22]).
On RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE transitions, the gNBs deletes the keys it stores
for that UE such that state information for idle mode UEs only has to be
maintained in AMF. It is also assumed that gNB does no longer store state
information about the corresponding UE and deletes the current keys from its
memory. In particular, on connected to idle transitions:
\- The gNB and UE delete NH, K~gNB~, K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~, K~UPint~ and
K~UPenc~ and related NCC;
\- AMF and UE keeps K~AMF~, K~NASint~ and K~NASenc~ stored.
On mobility with vertical key derivation the NH is further bound to the target
PCI and its frequency ARFCN-DL before it is taken into use as the K~gNB~ in
the target gNB. On mobility with horizontal key derivation the currently
active K~gNB~ is further bound to the target PCI and its frequency ARFCN-DL
before it is taken into use as the K~gNB~ in the target gNB (see clause 13.1).
In both cases, ARFCN-DL is the absolute frequency of SSB of the target PCell.
It is not required to change the AS security algorithms during intra-gNB-CU
handover. If the UE does not receive an indication of new AS security
algorithms during an intra-gNB-CU handover, the UE shall continue to use the
same algorithms as before the handover (see TS 38.331 [12]).
# 14 UE Capabilities
The UE capabilities in NR rely on a hierarchical structure where each
capability parameter is defined per UE, per duplex mode (FDD/TDD), per
frequency range (FR1/FR2), per band, per band combinations, ... as the UE may
support different functionalities depending on those (see TS 38.306 [11]).
NOTE 1: Some capability parameters are always defined per UE (e.g. SDAP, PDCP
and RLC parameters) while some other not always (e.g. MAC and Physical Layer
Parameters).
The UE capabilities in NR do not rely on UE categories: UE categories
associated to fixed peak data rates are only defined for marketing purposes
and not signalled to the network. Instead, the peak data rate for a given set
of aggregated carriers in a band or band combination is the sum of the peak
data rates of each individual carrier in that band or band combination, where
the peak data rate of each individual carrier is computed according to the
capabilities supported for that carrier in the corresponding band or band
combination.
For each block of contiguous serving cells in a band, the set of features
supported thereon is defined in a Feature Set (FS). The UE may indicate
several Feature Sets for a band (also known as feature sets per band) to
advertise different alternative features for the associated block of
contiguous serving cells in that band. The two-dimensional matrix of feature
sets for all the bands of a band combination (i.e. all the feature sets per
band) is referred to as a feature set combination. In a feature set
combination, the number of feature sets per band is equal to the number of
band entries in the corresponding band combination, and all feature sets per
band have the same number of feature sets. Each band combination is linked to
one feature set combination. This is depicted on Figure 14-1 below:
Figure 14-1: Feature Set Combinations
In addition, for some features in intra-band contiguous CA, the UE reports its
capabilities individually per carrier. Those capability parameters are sent in
feature set per component carrier and they are signalled in the corresponding
FSs (per Band) i.e. for the corresponding block of contiguous serving cells in
a band. The capability applied to each individual carrier in a block is
agnostic to the order in which they are signalled in the corresponding FS.
NOTE 2: For intra-band non-contiguous CA, there are as many feature sets per
band signalled as the number of (groups of contiguous) carriers that the UE is
able to aggregate non-contiguously in the corresponding band.
To limit signalling overhead, the gNB can request the UE to provide NR
capabilities for a restricted set of bands. When responding, the UE can skip a
subset of the requested band combinations when the corresponding UE
capabilities are the same.
If supported by the UE and the network, the UE may provide an ID in NAS
signalling that represents its radio capabilities for one or more RATs in
order to reduce signalling overhead. The ID may be assigned either by the
manufacturer or by the serving PLMN. The manufacturer-assigned ID corresponds
to a pre-provisioned set of capabilities. In the case of the PLMN-assigned ID,
assignment takes place in NAS signalling.
_The AMF stores the UE Radio Capability uploaded by the gNB_ _as specified in
TS 23.501 [3]._
The gNB can request the UE capabilities for RAT-Types NR, EUTRA, UTRA-FDD. The
UTRAN capabilities, i.e. the INTER RAT HANDOVER INFO, include START-CS, START-
PS and \"predefined configurations\", which are \"dynamic\" IEs. In order to
avoid the START values desynchronisation and the key replaying issue, the gNB
always requests the UE UTRA-FDD capabilities before handover to UTRA-FDD. The
gNB does not upload the UE UTRA-FDD capabilities to the AMF.
# 15 Self-Configuration and Self-Optimisation
## 15.1 Definitions
Void.
## 15.2 Void
## 15.3 Self-configuration
### 15.3.1 Dynamic configuration of the NG-C interface
#### 15.3.1.1 Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are assumed:
\- An initial remote IP end point to be used for SCTP initialisation is
provided to the NG-RAN node for each AMF the NG-RAN node is supposed to
connect to.
#### 15.3.1.2 SCTP initialization
NG-RAN establishes the first SCTP (IETF RFC 4960 [23]) using a configured IP
address.
NOTE: The NG-RAN node may use different source and/or destination IP end
point(s) if the SCTP establishment towards one IP end point fails. How the NG-
RAN node gets the remote IP end point(s) and its own IP address are outside
the scope of this specification.
#### 15.3.1.3 Application layer initialization
Once SCTP connectivity has been established, the NG-RAN node and the AMF shall
exchange application level configuration data over NGAP with the NG Setup
procedure, which is needed for these two nodes to interwork correctly on the
NG interface:
\- The NG-RAN node provides the relevant configuration information to the AMF,
which includes list of supported TA(s), etc.;
\- The AMF provides the relevant configuration information to the NG-RAN node,
which includes PLMN ID, etc.;
\- When the application layer initialization is successfully concluded, the
dynamic configuration procedure is completed and the NG-C interface is
operational.
After the application layer initialization is successfully completed, the AMF
may add or update or remove SCTP endpoints to be used for NG-C signalling
between the AMF and the NG-RAN node pair as specified in TS 23.501 [3].
### 15.3.2 Dynamic Configuration of the Xn interface
#### 15.3.2.1 Prerequisites
The following prerequisites are necessary:
\- An initial remote IP end point to be used for SCTP initialisation is
provided to the NG-RAN node.
#### 15.3.2.2 SCTP initialization
NG-RAN establishes the first SCTP (IETF RFC 4960 [23]) using a configured IP
address.
NOTE: The NG-RAN node may use different source and/or destination IP end
point(s) if the SCTP establishment towards one IP end point fails.
#### 15.3.2.3 Application layer initialization
Once SCTP connectivity has been established, the NG-RAN node and its candidate
peer NG-RAN node are in a position to exchange application level configuration
data over XnAP needed for the two nodes to interwork correctly on the Xn
interface:
\- The NG-RAN node provides the relevant configuration information to the
candidate NG-RAN node, which includes served cell information;
\- The candidate NG-RAN node provides the relevant configuration information
to the initiating NG-RAN node, which includes served cell information;
\- When the application layer initialization is successfully concluded, the
dynamic configuration procedure is completed and the Xn interface is
operational;
\- The NG-RAN node shall keep neighbouring NG-RAN nodes updated with the
complete list of served cells, or, if requested by the peer NG-RAN node, by a
limited list of served cells, while the Xn interface is operational.
### 15.3.3 Automatic Neighbour Cell Relation Function
#### 15.3.3.1 General
The purpose of ANR function is to relieve the operator from the burden of
manually managing NCRs. Figure 15.3.3.1-1 shows ANR and its environment:
Figure 15.3.3.1-1: Interaction between gNB and OAM due to ANR
The ANR function resides in the gNB and manages the Neighbour Cell Relation
Table (NCRT). Located within ANR, the Neighbour Detection Function finds new
neighbours and adds them to the NCRT. ANR also contains the Neighbour Removal
Function which removes outdated NCRs. The Neighbour Detection Function and the
Neighbour Removal Function are implementation specific.
An existing NCR from a source cell to a target cell means that gNB controlling
the source cell:
a) Knows the global and physical IDs (e.g. NR CGI/NR PCI, ECGI/PCI) of the
target cell; and
b) Has an entry in the NCRT for the source cell identifying the target cell;
and
c) Has the attributes in this NCRT entry defined, either by OAM or set to
default values.
NCRs are cell-to-cell relations, while an Xn link is set up between two gNBs.
Neighbour Cell Relations are unidirectional, while an Xn link is
bidirectional.
NOTE: The neighbour information exchange, which occurs during the Xn Setup
procedure or in the gNB Configuration Update procedure, may be used for ANR
purpose.
The ANR function also allows OAM to manage the NCRT. OAM can add and delete
NCRs. It can also change the attributes of the NCRT. The OAM system is
informed about changes in the NCRT.
#### 15.3.3.2 Intra-system Automatic Neighbour Cell Relation Function
ANR relies on NCGI (see clause 8.2) and ANR reporting of E-UTRA cells as
specified in TS 36.300 [2].
Figure 15.3.3.2-1: Automatic Neighbour Relation Function
Figure 15.3.3.2-1 depicts an example where the NG-RAN node serving cell A has
an ANR function. In RRC_CONNECTED, the NG-RAN node instructs each UE to
perform measurements on neighbour cells. The NG-RAN node may use different
policies for instructing the UE to do measurements, and when to report them to
the NG-RAN node. This measurement procedure is as specified in TS 38.331[12]
and TS 36.331 [29].
1\. The UE sends a measurement report regarding cell B. This report contains
Cell B\'s PCI, but not its NCGI/ECGI.
When the NG-RAN node receives a UE measurement report containing the PCI, the
following sequence may be used.
2\. The NG-RAN node instructs the UE, using the newly discovered PCI as
parameter, to read all the broadcast NCGI(s) /ECGI(s), TAC(s), RANAC(s), PLMN
ID(s) and, for neighbour NR cells, NR frequency band(s) and the gNB ID
length(s). To do so, the NG-RAN node may need to schedule appropriate idle
periods to allow the UE to read the NCGI/ECGI from the broadcast channel of
the detected neighbour cell. How the UE reads the NCGI/ECGI is specified in TS
38.331 [12] and TS 36.331 [29].
3\. When the UE has found out the new cell\'s NCGI(s) /ECGI(s), the UE reports
all the broadcast NCGI(s)/ECGI(s) to the serving cell NG-RAN node. In
addition, the UE reports all the tracking area code(s), RANAC(s), PLMN IDs
and, for neighbour NR cells, NR frequency band(s), and the gNB ID length(s)
that have been read by the UE. In case the detected NR cell does not broadcast
SIB1, the UE may report _noSIB1_ indication as specified in TS 38.331 [12].
4\. The NG-RAN node decides to add this neighbour relation, and can use PCI
and NCGI(s)/ECGI(s) to:
a. Lookup a transport layer address to the new NG-RAN node;
b. Update the Neighbour Cell Relation List;
c. If needed, setup a new Xn interface towards this NG-RAN node.
#### 15.3.3.3 Void
#### 15.3.3.4 Void
#### 15.3.3.5 Inter-system Automatic Neighbour Cell Relation Function
For Inter-system ANR, each cell contains an Inter Frequency Search list. This
list contains all frequencies that shall be searched. Figure 15.3.3.5-1
depicts an example where the NG-RAN node serving cell A has an ANR function.
Figure 15.3.3.5-1: Automatic Neighbour Relation Function in case of E-UTRAN
detected cell
In RRC_CONNECTED, the NG-RAN node instructs a UE to perform measurements and
detect E-UTRA cells connected to EPC.:
1 The NG-RAN node instructs a UE to look for neighbour cells in the target
system. To do so the NG-RAN node may need to schedule appropriate idle periods
to allow the UE to scan all cells in the target system.
2 The UE reports the PCI and carrier frequency of the detected cells in the
target system.
NOTE: The NG-RAN node may use different policies for instructing the UE to do
measurements, and when to report them to the NG-RAN node.
When the NG-RAN node receives the UE reports containing PCIs of cell(s), the
following sequence may be used:
3 The NG-RAN node instructs the UE, using the newly discovered PCI as
parameter, to read the ECGI, the TAC and all available PLMN ID(s) of the newly
detected cell in case of E-UTRA detected cells. The UE ignores transmissions
from the serving cell while finding the requested information transmitted in
the broadcast channel of the detected inter-system/inter-frequency neighbour
cell. To do so, the NG-RAN node may need to schedule appropriate idle periods
to allow the UE to read the requested information from the broadcast channel
of the detected inter-system neighbour cell.
4 After the UE has read the requested information in the new cell, it reports
the detected ECGI, TAC, and available PLMN ID(s) to the serving cell NG-RAN
node.
5 The NG-RAN node updates its inter-system NCRT.
### 15.3.4 Xn-C TNL address discovery
If the NG-RAN node is aware of the RAN node ID of the candidate NG-RAN node
(e.g. via the ANR function) but not of a TNL address suitable for SCTP
connectivity, then the NG-RAN node can utilize the 5GC (an AMF it is connected
to) to determine the TNL address as follows:
\- The NG-RAN node sends the UPLINK RAN CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message to the
AMF to request the TNL address of the candidate NG-RAN node, and includes
relevant information such as the source and target RAN node ID;
\- The AMF relays the request by sending the DOWNLINK RAN CONFIGURATION
TRANSFER message to the candidate NG-RAN node identified by the target RAN
node ID;
\- The candidate NG-RAN node responds by sending the UPLINK RAN CONFIGURATION
TRANSFER message containing one or more TNL addresses to be used for SCTP
connectivity with the initiating NG-RAN node, and includes other relevant
information such as the source and target RAN node ID;
\- The AMF relays the response by sending the DOWNLINK CONFIGURATION TRANSFER
message to the initiating NG-RAN node identified by the target RAN node ID.
NOTE: Void.
The NG-RAN node may determine the gNB ID length of the candidate gNB based on,
e.g.OAM configuration or UE reporting in ANR function. If the NG-RAN node is
not able to make this determination, it may include the NR cell identifier in
the UPLINK RAN CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message to the AMF. The AMF may, if
supported, determine the target gNB ID by matching the NR cell identifier with
a gNB ID of a gNB it connects to.
## 15.4 Support for Energy Saving
### 15.4.1 General
The aim of this function is to reduce operational expenses through energy
savings.
The function allows, for example in a deployment where capacity boosters can
be distinguished from cells providing basic coverage, to optimize energy
consumption enabling the possibility for an E-UTRA or NR cell providing
additional capacity via single or dual connectivity, to be switched off when
its capacity is no longer needed and to be re-activated on a need basis.
### 15.4.2 Solution description
#### 15.4.2.1 Intra-system energy saving
The solution builds upon the possibility for the NG-RAN node owning a capacity
booster cell to autonomously decide to switch-off such cell to lower energy
consumption (inactive state). The decision is typically based on cell load
information, consistently with configured information. The switch-off decision
may also be taken by O&M.
The NG-RAN node may initiate handover actions in order to off-load the cell
being switched off and may indicate the reason for handover with an
appropriate cause value to support the target node in taking subsequent
actions, e.g. when selecting the target cell for subsequent handovers.
All neighbour NG-RAN nodes are informed by the NG-RAN node owning the
concerned cell about the switch-off actions over the Xn interface, by means of
the NG-RAN node Configuration Update procedure.
All informed nodes maintain the cell configuration data, e.g., neighbour
relationship configuration, also when a certain cell is inactive. If basic
coverage is ensured by NG-RAN node cells, NG-RAN node owning non-capacity
boosting cells may request a re-activation over the Xn interface if capacity
needs in such cells demand to do so. This is achieved via the Cell Activation
procedure. During switch off time period of the boost cell, the NG-RAN node
may prevent idle mode UEs from camping on this cell and may prevent incoming
handovers to the same cell.
The NG-RAN node receiving a request should act accordingly. The switch-on
decision may also be taken by O&M. All peer NG-RAN nodes are informed by the
NG-RAN node owning the concerned cell about the re-activation by an indication
on the Xn interface.
#### 15.4.2.2 Inter-system energy saving
The solution builds upon the possibility for the NG-RAN node owning a capacity
booster cell to autonomously decide to switch-off such cell to dormant state.
The decision is typically based on cell load information, consistently with
configured information. The switch-off decision may also be taken by O&M. The
NG-RAN node indicates the switch-off action to the eNB over NG interface and
S1 interface. The NG-RAN node could also indicate the switch-on action to the
eNB over NG interface and S1 interface.
The eNB providing basic coverage may request a NG-RAN node\'s cell re-
activation based on its own cell load information or neighbour cell load
information, the switch-on decision may also be taken by O&M. The eNB requests
a NG-RAN node\'s cell re-activation and receives the NG-RAN node\'s cell re-
activation reply from the NG-RAN node over the S1 interface and NG interface.
Upon reception of the re-activation request, the NG-RAN node\'s cell should
remain switched on at least until expiration of the minimum activation time.
The minimum activation time may be configured by O&M or be left to the NG-RAN
node\'s implementation.
### 15.4.3 O&M requirements
Operators should be able to configure the energy saving function.
The configured information should include:
\- The ability of an NG-RAN node to perform autonomous cell switch-off;
\- The ability of an NG-RAN node to request the re-activation of a configured
list of inactive cells owned by a peer NG-RAN node.
O&M may also configure:
\- policies used by the NG-RAN node for cell switch-off decision;
\- policies used by peer NG-RAN nodes for requesting the re-activation of an
inactive cell;
\- The minimum time an NG-RAN node\'s cell should remain activated upon
reception of a re-activation request from an eNB.
## 15.5 Self-optimisation
### 15.5.1 Support for Mobility Load Balancing
#### 15.5.1.1 General
The objective of mobility load balancing is to distribute load evenly among
cells and among areas of cells, or to transfer part of the traffic from
congested cell or from congested areas of cells, or to offload users from one
cell, cell area, carrier or RAT to achieve network energy saving. This can be
done by means of optimization of cell reselection/handover parameters and
handover actions. The automation of such optimisation can provide high quality
user experience, while simultaneously improving the system capacity and also
to minimize human intervention in the network management and optimization
tasks.
Intra-RAT, intra-system inter-RAT and inter-system load balancing scenarios
are supported.
In general, support for mobility load balancing consists of one or more of
following functions:
\- Load reporting for intra-RAT and intra-system inter-RAT load balancing;
\- Load balancing action based on handovers;
\- Adapting handover and/or reselection configuration;
\- Load reporting for inter-system load balancing.
#### 15.5.1.2 Load reporting for intra-RAT and intra-system inter-RAT load
balancing
The load reporting function is executed by exchanging load information over
the Xn/X2/F1/E1 interfaces.
The following load related information should be supported which consists of:
\- Radio resource usage (per-cell and per SSB area PRB usage: DL/UL GBR PRB
usage, DL/UL non-GBR PRB usage, DL/UL total PRB usage, and DL/UL **_scheduling
PDCCH CCE usage; PRB usage for slice(s):_** DL/UL GBR PRB usage, DL/UL non-GBR
PRB usage, and DL/UL Total PRB allocation);
\- TNL capacity indicator (UL/DL TNL offered capacity and available capacity);
\- Cell Capacity Class value (UL/DL relative capacity indicator);
\- Capacity value (per cell, per SSB area and per slice: UL/DL available
capacity);
\- HW capacity indicator (offered throughput and available throughput over E1,
percentage utilisation over F1);
\- RRC connections (number of RRC connections, and available RRC Connection
Capacity);
\- Number of active UEs.
To achieve load reporting function, Resource Status Reporting Initiation &
Resource Status Reporting procedures are used.
15.5.1.3 Load balancing action based on handovers
The source cell may initiate handover due to load. The target cell performs
admission control for the load balancing handovers. A handover preparation
related to a mobility load balancing action is distinguishable from other
handovers, so that the target cell is able to apply appropriate admission
control.
#### 15.5.1.4 Adapting handover and/or reselection configuration
This function enables requesting of a change of handover and/or reselection
parameters at target cell. The source cell that initialized the load balancing
estimates if it is needed to change mobility configuration in the source
and/or target cell. If the amendment is needed, the source cell initializes
mobility negotiation procedure toward the target cell.
The source cell informs the target cell about the new mobility setting and
provides cause for the change (e.g. load balancing related request). The
proposed change is expressed by the means of the difference (delta) between
the current and the new values of the handover trigger. The handover trigger
is the cell specific offset that corresponds to the threshold at which a cell
initialises the handover preparation procedure. Cell reselection configuration
may be amended to reflect changes in the HO setting. The target cell responds
to the information from the source cell. The allowed delta range for HO
trigger parameter may be carried in the failure response message. The source
cell should consider the responses before executing the planned change of its
mobility setting.
All automatic changes on the HO and/or reselection parameters must be within
the range allowed by OAM.
#### 15.5.1.5 Load reporting for inter-system load balancing
The load reporting function for inter-system load balancing is executed by
exchanging load information between NG-RAN and E-UTRAN. Both event-triggered
and periodic inter-system load reporting are supported. Event-triggered inter-
system load reports are sent when the reporting node detects crossing of cell
load thresholds.
The following load related information should be supported:
\- Cell Capacity Class value (UL/DL relative capacity indicator);
\- Capacity value (per cell: UL/DL available capacity);
\- RRC connections (number of RRC connections, and available RRC Connection
Capacity);
\- Number of active UEs;
\- Radio Resource Status (per cell PRB usage: UL/DL GBR PRB usage for MIMO,
DL/UL non-GBR PRB usage for MIMO, DL/UL total PRB usage for MIMO).
NGAP procedures used for inter-system load balancing are Uplink RAN
Configuration Transfer and Downlink RAN Configuration Transfer.
S1AP procedures used for inter-system load balancing are eNB Configuration
Transfer and MME Configuration Transfer.
### 15.5.2 Support for Mobility Robustness Optimization
#### 15.5.2.1 General
Mobility Robustness Optimisation aims at detecting and enabling correction of
following problems:
\- Connection failure due to intra-system or inter-system mobility;
\- Inter-system Unnecessary HO (too early inter-system HO from NR to E-UTRAN
with no radio link failure);
\- Inter-system HO ping-pong;
\- PSCell change failure.
MRO provides means to distinguish the above problems from NR coverage related
problems and other problems, not related to mobility.
For detection of a sub-optimal successful handovers, MRO additionally enables
observability of:
\- Successful HO due to intra-NR mobility.
#### 15.5.2.2 Connection failure
##### 15.5.2.2.1 General
For analysis of connection failures, the UE makes the RLF Report available to
the network.
The UE stores the latest RLF Report, including both LTE and NR RLF report
until the RLF report is fetched by the network or for 48 hours after the
connection failure is detected.
The UE only indicates RLF report availability and only provides the RLF report
to the network if the current RPLMN is a PLMN that was present in the UE\'s
EPLMN List or was the RPLMN at the time the connection failure was detected.
In case RLF happens in an E-UTRA cell, the UE makes the LTE RLF Report
available to NG-RAN nodes and eNB(s), and in case RLF happens in an NR cell
the UE makes the NR RLF Report available to gNB(s).
If the LTE RLF Report is reported to a NG-RAN node, and the last serving node
is an E-UTRAN node, the NG-RAN node may transfer it to the E-UTRAN node by
triggering the Uplink RAN configuration transfer procedure over NG and the
E-UTRAN node can take this into account as defined in TS 36.300 [2].
##### 15.5.2.2.2 Connection failure due to intra-system mobility
One of the functions of Mobility Robustness Optimization is to detect
connection failures that occur due to Too Early or Too Late Handovers, or
Handover to Wrong Cell. These problems are defined as follows:
\- Intra-system Too Late Handover: an RLF occurs after the UE has stayed for a
long period of time in the cell; the UE attempts to re-establish the radio
link connection in a different cell.
\- Intra-system Too Early Handover: an RLF occurs shortly after a successful
handover from a source cell to a target cell or a handover failure occurs
during the handover procedure; the UE attempts to re-establish the radio link
connection in the source cell.
\- Intra-system Handover to Wrong Cell: an RLF occurs shortly after a
successful handover from a source cell to a target cell or a handover failure
occurs during the handover procedure; the UE attempts to re-establish the
radio link connection in a cell other than the source cell and the target
cell.
In the definition above, the \"successful handover\" refers to the UE state,
namely the successful completion of the RA procedure.
In case of CHO, the Too Late Handover, Too Early Handover and Handover to
Wrong Cell in the definition above means Too Late CHO Execution, Too Early CHO
Execution and CHO Execution to Wrong Cell.
**Detection mechanism**
A failure indication may be initiated after a UE attempts to re-establish the
radio link connection at NG-RAN node B after a failure at NG-RAN node A. NG-
RAN node B may initiate the Failure Indication procedure towards multiple NG-
RAN nodes if they control cells which use the PCI signalled by the UE during
the re-establishment procedure. The NG-RAN node receiving this selects the UE
context that matches the received Failure Cell ID and C-RNTI, and, if
available, uses the shortMAC-I to confirm this identification, by calculating
the shortMAC-I and comparing it to the received IE.
A failure indication may also be sent to the node last serving the UE when the
NG-RAN node fetches the RLF REPORT from UE by triggering:
\- The Failure Indication procedure over Xn;
\- The Uplink RAN configuration transfer procedure and Downlink RAN
configuration transfer procedure over NG.
The detailed detection mechanisms for too late handover, too early handover
and handover to wrong cell are carried out through the following in the NG-RAN
node that served the UE before the reported connection failure:
\- Intra-system Too Late Handover: there is no recent handover for the UE
prior to the connection failure e.g. the UE reported timer is absent or larger
than the configured threshold (e.g. Tstore_UE_cntxt), or if CHO is configured
but the CHO execution is not initiated for the UE prior to the connection
failure, e.g. the UE reported timer is absent or larger than the configured
threshold (e.g. Tstore_UE_cntxt).
\- Intra-system Too Early Handover: there is a recent handover for the UE
prior to the connection failure e.g. the UE reported timer is smaller than the
configured threshold (e.g. Tstore_UE_cntxt), and the first re-establishment
attempt cell/the successful re-connect cell is the cell that served the UE at
the last handover initialisation or fall back to the source cell configuration
in case of DAPS HO.
\- Intra-system Handover to Wrong Cell: there is a recent handover for the UE
prior to the connection failure e.g. the UE reported timer is smaller than the
configured threshold (e.g. Tstore_UE_cntxt), and the first re-establishment
attempt cell/ the cell UE attempts to re-connect/the cell UE attempts CHO
recovery is neither the cell that served the UE at the last handover
initialisation nor the cell that served the UE where the RLF happened or the
cell that the handover was initialized toward.
The \"UE reported timer\" above indicates the time elapsed since the last
handover initialisation until connection failure or the time elapsed since the
CHO execution until connection failure.
In case of Too Early Handover or Handover to Wrong Cell, the NG-RAN node
receiving the failure indication may inform the NG-RAN node controlling the
cell where the mobility configuration caused the failure by means of the
Handover Report procedure over Xn or the Uplink RAN Configuration Transfer
procedure over NG. This may include the RLF report.
**Retrieval of information needed for problem analysis**
In order to retrieve relevant information collected at the network side as
part of the UE context, the UE provides C-RNTI used in the last serving cell.
If the cause for the failure is identified as a \"Too Early HO\" or a \"HO to
Wrong Cell\", the NG-RAN node controlling the last serving cell shall, include
in the HANDOVER REPORT message the C-RNTI used in the source cell of the last
completed handover before the failure. If the NG RAN node controlling that
source cell provided the Mobility Information, it is also included in the
HANDOVER REPORT message. If used, the Mobility Information is prepared at the
source NG RAN node of a handover and may refer to or identify any handover-
related data at this NG RAN node.
**Handling multiple reports from a single failure event**
In case the RRC re-establishment fails and the RRC connection setup succeeds,
MRO evaluation of intra-RAT mobility connection failures may be triggered
twice for the same failure event. In this case, only one failure event should
be counted.
##### 15.5.2.2.3 Connection failure due to inter-system mobility
One of the functions of Mobility Robustness Optimization is to detect
connection failures that occurred due to Too Early or Too Late inter-system
handovers. These problems are defined as follows:
\- Inter-system/ Too Late Handover: an RLF occurs after the UE has stayed in a
cell belonging to an NG-RAN node for a long period of time; the UE attempts to
re-connect to a cell belonging to an E-UTRAN node.
\- Inter-system/ Too Early Handover: an RLF occurs shortly after a successful
handover from a cell belonging to an E-UTRAN node to a target cell belonging
to an NG-RAN node; the UE attempts to re-connect to the source cell or to
another cell belonging to an E-UTRAN node.
**Detection mechanism**
A failure indication may be sent to the node last serving the UE when the NG-
RAN node fetches the RLF REPORT from UE by triggering:
\- The Failure Indication procedure over Xn;
\- The Uplink RAN configuration transfer procedure and Downlink RAN
configuration transfer procedure over NG.
In case the last serving node is an E-UTRAN node, the detection mechanism
proceed as deined in TS 36.300 [2].
In case the last serving node is an NG-RAN node, the detection mechanisms for
Too Late Inter-system Handover and Too Early Inter-system Handover are carried
out through the following:
\- Too Late Inter-system Handover: the connection failure occurs while being
connected to a NG-RAN node, and there is no recent handover for the UE prior
to the connection failure i.e., the UE reported timer is absent or larger than
the configured threshold, e.g., _Tstore_UE_cntxt_ , and the first node where
the UE attempts to re-connect is a E-UTRAN node.
\- Too Early Inter-system Handover: the connection failure occurs while being
connected to a NG-RAN node, and there is a recent inter-system handover for
the UE prior to the connection failure i.e., the UE reported timer is smaller
than the configured threshold, e.g., _Tstore_UE_cntxt_ , and the first cell
where the UE attempts to re-connect and the node that served the UE at the
last handover initialisation are both E-UTRAN node.
The \"UE reported timer\" above indicates the time elapsed since the last
handover initialisation until connection failure. The UE may make the RLF
Report available to an NG-RAN node. The NG-RAN node may forward the
information using the FAILURE INDICATION message over Xn or by means of the
Uplink RAN configuration transfer procedure and Downlink RAN configuration
transfer over NG to the node that served the UE before the reported connection
failure.
In case the failure is a Too Early Inter-system Handover, the NG-RAN node
receiving the failure indication may inform the E-UTRAN node by means of the
Uplink RAN Configuration Transfer procedure over NG. This may include the RLF
report.
#### 15.5.2.3 Inter-system Unnecessary HO
One of the purposes of inter-system Mobility Robustness Optimisation is the
detection of a non-optimal use of network resources. In particular, in case of
inter-system operations and when NR is considered, the case known as
Unnecessary HO to another system is identified. The problem is defined as
follows:
\- UE is handed over from NR to E-UTRAN even though quality of the NR coverage
was sufficient for the service used by the UE. The handover may therefore be
considered as unnecessary HO to another system (i.e. EPS) (too early inter-
system HO without connection failure).
In inter-system HO, if the serving cell threshold (NR cell) is set too high,
and cell in another system (i.e. EPS) with good signal strength is available,
a handover to another system may be triggered unnecessarily, resulting in an
inefficient use of the networks. With a lower threshold the UE could have
continued in the source system (5GS).
To be able to detect the Unnecessary HO to another system, a gNB node may
choose to put additional coverage and quality condition information into the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message in the Handover Preparation procedure when an inter-
system HO from gNB to another system occurs. The RAN node in the other system,
upon receiving this additional coverage and quality information, may instruct
the UE to continue measuring the cell(s) in source system during a period of
time, while being connected to another system, and send periodic or single
measurement reports to the node in other system. When the period of time
indicated by the node in source system expires, the RAN node in the other
system, may evaluate the received measurement reports with the
coverage/quality condition received during the inter-system HO procedure and
decide if an inter-system unnecessary HO report should be sent to the gNB in
the source system.
The inter-system unnecessary HO report shall only be sent in cases where, in
all UE measurement reports collected during the measurement period, any cells
in the source system exceed the radio coverage and/or quality threshold (the
radio threshold RSRP, RSRQ or/and SINR and the measurement period are
indicated in the additional coverage and quality information in the Handover
Preparation procedure). If an inter-system handover towards 5GS is executed
from EPS within the indicated measurement period, the measurement period
expires. In this case, the eNB in EPS may also send the HO Report. No HO
Report shall be sent in case no NR cell could be included, or if the indicated
period of time is interrupted by an inter-system handover to a system
different than 5GS.
The RAN node in the source system (5GS) upon receiving of the report, can
decide if/how its parameters (e.g., threshold to trigger Inter-system HO)
should be adjusted.
#### 15.5.2.4 Inter-system Ping-pong
One of the functions of Mobility Robustness Optimization is to detect ping-
pongs that occur in inter-system environment. The problem is defined as
follows:
\- A UE is handed over from a cell in a source system (e.g. 5GS) to a cell in
a target system different from the source system (e.g. EPS), then within a
predefined limited time the UE is handed over back to a cell in the source
system, while the coverage of the source system was sufficient for the service
used by the UE. The event may occur more than once.
The solution for the problem may consist of the following steps:
1) Statistics regarding inter-system ping-pong occurrences are collected by
the responsible node;
2) Coverage verification is performed to check if the mobility to other system
was inevitable.
The statistics regarding ping-pong occurrence may be based on evaluation of
the _UE History Information_ IE in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message. If the
evaluation indicates a potential ping-pong case and the source NG_RAN node of
the 1^st^ inter-system handover is different than the target NG-RAN node of
the 2^nd^ inter-system handover, the target NG-RAN node may use the HANDOVER
REPORT message or the UPLINK RAN CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message to indicate
the occurrence of potential ping-pong cases to the source NG-RAN node.
If NG-RAN coverage during the potential ping-pong event needs to be verified
for the purpose of determining corrective measures, the Unnecessary HO to
another system procedure may be used
#### 15.5.2.5 O&M Requirements
All automatic changes of the HO and/or reselection parameters for mobility
robustness optimisation shall be within the ranges allowed by OAM and
specified below.
The following control parameters shall be provided by OAM to control MRO
behaviour:
\- Maximum deviation of Handover Trigger: this parameter defines the maximum
allowed absolute deviation of the Handover Trigger, from the default point of
operation defined by the parameter values assigned by OAM.
\- Minimum time between Handover Trigger changes: this parameter defines the
minimum allowed time interval between two Handover Trigger change performed by
MRO. This is used to control the stability and convergence of the algorithm.
Furthermore, in order to support the solutions for detection of mobility
optimisation, the parameter _Tstore_UE_cntxt_ shall be configurable by the OAM
system.
#### 15.5.2.6 PSCell change failure
For analysis of PSCell change failures, the UE makes the SCG Failure
Information available to the MN. If the MN can perform an initial analysis, it
transfers the SCG Failure Information together with the analysis results to
the relevant SN which is responsible for the PSCell change failures.
Otherwise, the MN transfers the SCG Failure Information to the last serving
SN, which may respond using the SCG Failure Transfer procedure to inform the
MN it is not responsible for the SCG failure. If needed, the MN transfer the
SCG Failure Information to the source SN.
#### 15.5.2.7 Successful HO
One of the functions of Mobility Robustness Optimization is to detect a sub-
optimal successful handover event. The aim is to identify underlying
conditions during successful ordinary handovers, successful DAPS handovers, or
successful Conditional handovers.
For analysis of successful handover, the UE supports Successful Handover
Report based on configuration by network, if received, and makes the
Successful Handover Report available to the network as specified in TS 38.331
[12].
The UE stores the Successful Handover Report until the Successful Handover
Report is fetched by the network or for 48 hours after the Successful Handover
Report is recorded.
When the target NR node fetches the Successful HO Report from UE, it may
forward the information to the source node, i.e the node handling the cell
reported as source cell in this Successful HO Report, by using the ACCESS AND
MOBILITY INDICATION message over Xn or by means of the Uplink RAN
configuration transfer procedure and Downlink RAN configuration transfer over
NG.
Upon retrieval of a Successful Handover Report, the receiving node may analyse
whether its mobility configuration needs adjustment.
The SHR report can be used to detect one case of Intra-system Too Late
Handover, namely when DAPS HO is configured but an RLF is detected in the
source cell during a successful DAPS HO.
### 15.5.3 Support for RACH Optimization
RACH optimization is supported by UE reported information made available at
the NG RAN node as specified in TS 38.331 [12] and by PRACH parameters
exchange between NG RAN nodes.
The contents of the RACH information report comprise of the following:
\- Contention detection indication per RACH attempt;
\- Indexes of the SSBs and number of RACH preambles sent on each tried SSB
listed in chronological order of attempts;
\- Indication whether the selected SSB is above or below the configured RSRP
threshold per RACH attempt;
\- 2-step RACH information as specified in clause 5.7.10.4 of TS 38.331 [12].
The UE operating in NR-DC, may also support SgNB RACH information report.
### 15.5.4 UE History Information from the UE
The source NG-RAN node collects and stores the UE History Information for as
long as the UE stays in one of its cells.
The UE may report the UE history information when connecting to a cell of the
NG-RAN node, consisting of PCell and PSCell mobility history information, as
specified in TS 38.331 [12].
When information needs to be discarded because the list is full, such
information will be discarded in order of its position in the list, starting
with the oldest cell record. If the list is full, and the UE history
information from the UE is available, the UE history information from the UE
should also be discarded.
The resulting information is then used in subsequent handover preparations by
means of the Handover Preparation procedures over the NG and XN interfaces,
which provide the target NG-RAN node with a list of previously visited cells
and associated (per-cell) information elements. The Handover Preparation
procedures also trigger the target NG-RAN node to start collection and storage
of UE history Information and thus to propagate the collected information.
In case of CHO, the target NG-RAN node updates the time UE stayed in cell of
the latest PCell entry (i.e. the source cell) when the UE successfully
accesses a candidate cell of the target NG-RAN node. The updated value of the
time UE stayed in the source cell is equal to the value received from the
source NG-RAN node during the Handover Preparation plus the time from
receiving the Handover Request message from the source NG-RAN node to
receiving the RRC Reconfiguration Complete message from the UE. When the
target NG-RAN node receives the SCG UHI from the source NG-RAN node via the
Handover Request message, the target NG-RAN node also updates the time UE
stayed in cell of the latest PSCell entry (i.e. the source PSCell) as
specified in TS 37.340 [21].
### 15.5.5 Support for Coverage and Capacity Optimisation
#### 15.5.5.1 General
The objective of NR Coverage and Capacity Optimization (CCO) function is to
detect and resolve or mitigate CCO issues, e.g. coverage and cell edge
interference issues.
#### 15.5.5.2 OAM requirements
Each NG-RAN node may be configured with _alternative coverage configurations_
by OAM. The alternative coverage configurations contain relevant radio
parameters and may also include a range for how each parameter is allowed to
be adjusted.
#### 15.5.5.3 Dynamic coverage configuration changes
An NG-RAN node may autonomously adjust within and switch between coverage
configurations. When a change is executed, a NG-RAN node may notify its
neighbour NG-RAN nodes using the NG-RAN NODE CONFIGURATION UPDATE message with
the list of cells and SSBs with modified coverage included. The list contains
the CGI of each modified cell with its coverage state indicator and optionally
the SSB index of each modified SSB with its coverage state indicator.
The coverage state indicator may be used at the receiving NG-RAN node to
adjust the functions of the Mobility Robustness Optimisation, e.g. by using
the coverage state indicator to retrieve a previously stored Mobility
Robustness Optimisation state. The coverage state indicator may also be used
at the receiving NG-RAN node to adopt coverage configurations matching with
neighbouring cells coverage configurations.
If the list includes indication about planned reconfiguration and possibly a
list of replacing cells, the receiving NG-RAN node may use this to avoid
connection or re-establishment failures during the reconfiguration. Also, if
the sending NG-RAN node adds cells in inactive state, the receiving NG-RAN
node may use this information to avoid connection or re-establishment
failures. The receiving NG-RAN node may also use the notification to reduce
the impact on mobility. The receiving NG-RAN node should avoid triggering
handovers towards cell(s) that are indicated to be inactive.
### 15.5.6 Support for PCI Optimisation
The PCI Optimization Function in split gNB case is specified in TS 38.401 [4].
#### 15.5.6.1 Centralized PCI Assignment {#centralized-pci-assignment .list-
paragraph}
For centralized PCI assignment in gNB, the OAM assigns a single PCI for each
NR cell in the gNB, and the gNB selects this value as the PCI of the NR cell.
#### 15.5.6.2 Distributed PCI Assignment {#distributed-pci-assignment .list-
paragraph}
For distributed PCI assignment in gNB, the OAM assigns a list of PCIs for each
NR cell in the gNB, and the gNB selects a PCI value from the list of PCIs. The
gNB may restrict this list by removing some PCIs that are reported by UEs,
reported over the Xn interface by neighboring gNBs, and/or acquired through
other methods, e.g. detected over the air using a downlink receiver.
# 16 Verticals Support
## 16.1 URLLC
### 16.1.1 Overview
The support of Ultra-Reliable and Low Latency Communications (URLLC) services
is facilitated by the introduction of the mechanisms described in the
following clauses. Please note however that those mechanisms need not be
limited to the provision of URLLC services. Furthermore, RRC can associate
logical channels with different SR configurations, for instance, to provide
more frequent SR opportunities to URLLC services.
### 16.1.2 LCP Restrictions
With LCP restrictions in MAC, RRC can restrict the mapping of a logical
channel to a subset of the configured cells, numerologies, PUSCH transmission
durations, configured grant configurations and control whether a logical
channel can utilise the resources allocated by a Type 1 Configured Grant (see
clause 10.3) or whether a logical channel can utilise dynamic grants
indicating a certain physical priority level. With such restrictions, it then
becomes possible to reserve, for instance, the numerology with the largest
subcarrier spacing and/or shortest PUSCH transmission duration for URLLC
services. Furthermore, RRC can associate logical channels with different SR
configurations, for instance, to provide more frequent SR opportunities to
URLLC services.
### 16.1.3 Packet Duplication
When duplication is configured for a radio bearer by RRC, at least one
secondary RLC entity is added to the radio bearer to handle the duplicated
PDCP PDUs as depicted on Figure 16.1.3-1, where the logical channel
corresponding to the primary RLC entity is referred to as _the primary logical
channel_ , and the logical channel corresponding to the secondary RLC
entity(ies), the _secondary logical channel(s)_. All RLC entities have the
same RLC mode. Duplication at PDCP therefore consists in submitting the same
PDCP PDUs multiple times: once to each activated RLC entity for the radio
bearer. With multiple independent transmission paths, packet duplication
therefore increases reliability and reduces latency and is especially
beneficial for URLLC services.
Figure 16.1.3-1: Packet Duplication
NOTE: PDCP control PDUs are not duplicated and always submitted to the primary
RLC entity.
When configuring duplication for a DRB, RRC also sets the state of PDCP
duplication (either activated or deactivated) at the time of
(re-)configuration. After the configuration, the PDCP duplication state can
then be dynamically controlled by means of a MAC control element and in DC,
the UE applies the MAC CE commands regardless of their origin (MCG or SCG).
When duplication is configured for an SRB the state is always active and
cannot be dynamically controlled. When configuring duplication for a DRB with
more than one secondary RLC entity, RRC also sets the state of each of them
(i.e. either activated or deactivated). Subsequently, a MAC CE can be used to
dynamically control whether each of the configured secondary RLC entities for
a DRB should be activated or deactivated, i.e. which of the RLC entities shall
be used for duplicate transmission. Primary RLC entity cannot be deactivated.
When duplication is deactivated for a DRB, all secondary RLC entities
associated to this DRB are deactivated. When a secondary RLC entity is
deactivated, it is not re-established, the HARQ buffers are not flushed, and
the transmitting PDCP entity should indicate to the secondary RLC entity to
discard all duplicated PDCP PDUs.
When activating duplication for a DRB, NG-RAN should ensure that at least one
serving cell is activated for each logical channel associated with an
activated RLC entity of the DRB; and when the deactivation of SCells leaves no
serving cells activated for a logical channel of the DRB, NG-RAN should ensure
that duplication is also deactivated for the RLC entity associated with the
logical channel.
When duplication is activated, the original PDCP PDU and the corresponding
duplicate(s) shall not be transmitted on the same carrier. The logical
channels of a radio bearer configured with duplication can either belong to
the same MAC entity (referred to as CA duplication) or to different ones
(referred to as DC duplication). CA duplication can also be configured in
either or both of the MAC entities together with DC duplication when
duplication over more than two RLC entities is configured for the radio
bearer. In CA duplication, logical channel mapping restrictions are used in a
MAC entity to ensure that the different logical channels of a radio bearer in
the MAC entity are not sent on the same carrier. When CA duplication is
configured for an SRB, one of the logical channels associated to the SRB is
mapped to SpCell.
When CA duplication is deactivated for a DRB in a MAC entity (i.e. none or
only one of RLC entities of the DRB in the MAC entity remains activated), the
logical channel mapping restrictions of the logical channels of the DRB are
lifted for as long as CA duplication remains deactivated for the DRB in the
MAC entity.
When an RLC entity acknowledges the transmission of a PDCP PDU, the PDCP
entity shall indicate to the other RLC entity(ies) to discard it. In addition,
in case of CA duplication, when an RLC entity restricted to only SCell(s)
reaches the maximum number of retransmissions for a PDCP PDU, the UE informs
the gNB but does not trigger RLF.
### 16.1.4 CQI and MCS
For channel state reporting, a CQI table for target block error rate 10^-5^ is
introduced.
For scheduling data packets with higher reliability, 64QAM MCS tables
containing entries with lower spectral efficiency are introduced for both
downlink and uplink. The tables are different for CP-OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM. The
MCS tables can be configured semi-statically or dynamically. The dynamic
signalling of MCS table is supported by configuring UE with MCS-C-RNTI, where
the scrambling of DCI CRC by MCS-C-RNTI indicates the 64QAM MCS tables with
entries of lower spectral efficiency.
### 16.1.5 DCI formats
For PDCCH transmission with higher reliability, two DCI formats are introduced
for uplink and downlink scheduling respectively.
### 16.1.6 Higher layer multi-connectivity
The redundant transmission may be applied on the user plane path between the
UE and the network for URLLC service as specified in TS 23.501 [3].
#### 16.1.6.1 Redundant user plane paths based on dual connectivity
UE may initiate two redundant PDU Sessions over the 5G network. The 5GS sets
up the user plane paths of the two redundant PDU sessions to be disjoint. When
PDU session setup or modification is initiated, the RAN can configure dual
connectivity in one NG-RAN node or two NG-RAN nodes for the two redundant PDU
sessions to ensure the disjoint user plane paths according to the redundancy
information received from the 5GC. The RAN shall ensure that the resources of
the data radio bearers for the two redundant PDU sessions are isolated. If the
RAN cannot satisfy the disjoint user plane requirement, the redundant PDU
sessions may be kept or not kept according to the RAN local configuration. The
redundancy information is transferred to the target NG-RAN node in case of
handover.
#### 16.1.6.2 Redundant data transmission via single UPF and single RAN node
Two NG-U tunnels are setup between single UPF and single NG-RAN node for
redundant transmission of the QoS flows when PDU session setup or modification
is initiated. The two NG-U tunnels are transferred via disjointed transport
layer paths. The 5GC provides the indicator per QoS flow to the NG-RAN for the
redundant transmission. For downlink, the NG-RAN node eliminates the
duplicated packets per QoS flow. For uplink, the NG-RAN node replicates the
packets and transmits them via the two NG-U tunnels. The indicator per QoS
flow for redundant transmission is transferred to the target NG-RAN node in
case of handover.
### 16.1.7 URLLC in Unlicensed Controlled Environment
URLLC services can be supported in shared spectrum where LBT failures are
assumed to be not frequent. In this case, a channel access procedure for semi-
static channel occupancy can be initiated by the gNB or the UE, or the gNB
operates in dynamic channel access mode, as described in TS 37.213 [37]. To
handle potential LBT failures on configured grants (CG), the CG retransmission
timer can be optionally configured to enable autonomous retransmissions, and
it may be configured simultaneously with enhanced intra-UE overlapping
resource prioritization mechanisms. When the CG retransmission timer is
configured, the UE shall select the HARQ process for each CG resource by
itself. If the enhanced intra-UE overlapping resource prioritization
mechanisms is also configured, the UE may be further configured to select the
HARQ process for a CG resource based on logical channel priority.
### 16.1.8 PUCCH cell switching for TDD cells
To reduce the delay for HARQ-ACK feedback for TDD operation with URLLC
services, PUCCH cell switching for TDD cells is supported. The UE can be
provided in each PUCCH group with a PUCCH switching SCell (PUCCH sSCell) that
can be used for PUCCH transmission in addition to PCell / PSCell / PUCCH
SCell. The applicable cell for PUCCH transmission to be either on PCell
/PSCell / PUCCH SCell or the PUCCH sSCell at a time is either defined by:
\- a higher layer configured semi-static time-domain pattern of the applicable
cell for PUCCH transmission; or
\- dynamic indication of the cell for PUCCH transmission through a PDCCH
scheduling a PUCCH transmission.
The PUCCH cell switching is applicable to all UCI types when using the higher
layer configured time-domain pattern, but is only applicable to HARQ feedback
for the dynamic indication of the cell for PUCCH transmission through a PDCCH
scheduling PUCCH.
## 16.2 IMS Voice
### 16.2.0 Support for IMS voice
For IMS voice support in NG-RAN, the following is assumed:
\- Network ability to support IMS voice sessions, i.e. ability to support QoS
flows with 5QI for voice and IMS signalling (see clause 12 and TS 23.501 [3]),
or through EPC System fallback;
\- UE capability to support \"IMS voice over PS\", see TS 24.501 [28].
The capabilities indications check is handled at NAS layer. To maintain the
voice service in NG-RAN, the UE provides additional capabilities over RRC (see
TS 38.331 [12]), that are used to determine accurate NR voice support options.
Further MMTEL IMS voice and video enhancements are facilitated by the
mechanisms described in the following clauses.
### 16.2.1 Support for MMTEL IMS voice and video enhancements
#### 16.2.1.1 RAN-assisted codec adaptation
RAN-assisted codec adaptation provides a means for the gNB to send codec
adaptation indication with recommended bit rate to assist the UE to select or
adapt to a codec rate for MMTEL voice or MMTEL video. The RAN-assisted codec
adaptation mechanism supports the uplink/downlink bit rate increase or
decrease. For a bearer associated with configuration of MBR greater than GBR,
the recommended uplink/downlink bit rate is within boundaries set by the MBR
and GBR of the concerned bearer.
For uplink or downlink bit rate adaptation, gNB may send a recommended bit
rate to the UE to inform the UE on the currently recommended transport bit
rate on the local uplink or downlink, which the UE may use in combination with
other information to adapt the bit rate, e.g. the UE may send a bit rate
request to the peer UE via application layer messages as specified in TS
26.114 [24], which the peer UE may use in combination with other information
to adapt the codec bit rate. The recommended bit rate is in kbps at the
physical layer at the time when the decision is made.
The recommended bit rate for UL and DL is conveyed as a MAC Control Element
(CE) from the gNB to the UE as outlined in Figure 16.2.1.1-1.
Figure 16.2.1.1-1: UL or DL bit rate recommendation
Based on the recommended bit rate from the gNB, a UE may initiate an end-to-
end bit rate adaptation with its peer (UE or MGW). The UE may also send a
query message to its local gNB to check if a bit rate recommended by its peer
can be provided by the gNB. The UE is not expected to go beyond the
recommended bit rate from the gNB.
The recommended bit rate query message is conveyed as a MAC CE from the UE to
the gNB as outlined in Figure 16.2.1.1-2.
Figure 16.2.1.1-2: UL or DL bit rate recommendation query
A prohibit timer can be configured per logical channel by the network to limit
UEs sending frequent query MAC CEs. Independent prohibit timers are used for
each direction (uplink and downlink) to prohibit the UE from retransmitting
exactly the same query MAC CE to the gNB during the configured time.
#### 16.2.1.2 MMTEL voice quality/coverage enhancements
The air interface delay budget can be relaxed to increase the robustness of
the transmission for coverage enhancement. Such relaxation may be achieved
when a UE in good coverage indicates a preference to the gNB to reduce the
local air interface delay by sending a _DelayBudgetReport_ message to decrease
the DRX cycle length, so that the E2E delay and jitter can be reduced. When
the UE detects changes such as end-to-end MMTEL voice quality or local radio
quality, the UE may inform the gNB its new preference by sending
_DelayBudgetReport_ messages with updated contents.
## 16.3 Network Slicing
### 16.3.1 General Principles and Requirements
In this clause, the general principles and requirements related to the
realization of network slicing in the NG-RAN for NR connected to 5GC and for
E-UTRA connected to 5GC are given.
A network slice always consists of a RAN part and a CN part. The support of
network slicing relies on the principle that traffic for different slices is
handled by different PDU sessions. Network can realise the different network
slices by scheduling and also by providing different L1/L2 configurations.
Each network slice is uniquely identified by a S-NSSAI, as defined in TS
23.501 [3]. NSSAI (Network Slice Selection Assistance Information) includes
one or a list of S-NSSAIs (Single NSSAI) where a S-NSSAI is a combination of:
\- mandatory SST (Slice/Service Type) field, which identifies the slice type
and consists of 8 bits (with range is 0-255);
\- optional SD (Slice Differentiator) field, which differentiates among Slices
with same SST field and consist of 24 bits.
The list includes at most 8 S-NSSAI(s).
The UE provides NSSAI (Network Slice Selection Assistance Information) for
network slice selection in _RRCSetupComplete_ , if it has been provided by NAS
(see clause 9.2.1.3). While the network can support large number of slices
(hundreds), the UE need not support more than 8 slices simultaneously. A BL UE
or a NB-IoT UE supports a maximum of 8 slices simultaneously.
Network Slicing is a concept to allow differentiated treatment depending on
each customer requirements. With slicing, it is possible for Mobile Network
Operators (MNO) to consider customers as belonging to different tenant types
with each having different service requirements that govern in terms of what
slice types each tenant is eligible to use based on Service Level Agreement
(SLA) and subscriptions.
The following key principles apply for support of Network Slicing in NG-RAN:
**RAN awareness of slices**
\- NG-RAN supports a differentiated handling of traffic for different network
slices which have been pre-configured. How NG-RAN supports the slice enabling
in terms of NG-RAN functions (i.e. the set of network functions that comprise
each slice) is implementation dependent.
**Selection of RAN part of the network slice**
\- NG-RAN supports the selection of the RAN part of the network slice, by
NSSAI provided by the UE or the 5GC which unambiguously identifies one or more
of the pre-configured network slices in the PLMN.
**Resource management between slices**
\- NG-RAN supports policy enforcement between slices as per service level
agreements. It should be possible for a single NG-RAN node to support multiple
slices. The NG-RAN should be free to apply the best RRM policy for the SLA in
place to each supported slice.
**Support of QoS**
\- NG-RAN supports QoS differentiation within a slice, and per Slice-Maximum
Bit Rate may be enforced per UE, if feasible. How NG-RAN enables UE-Slice-MBR
enforcement and rate limitation (see TS 23.501 [3]) is up to network
implementation.
**RAN selection of CN entity**
\- For initial attach, the UE may provide NSSAI to support the selection of an
AMF. If available, NG-RAN uses this information for routing the initial NAS to
an AMF. If the NG-RAN is unable to select an AMF using this information or the
UE does not provide any such information the NG-RAN sends the NAS signalling
to one of the default AMFs.
\- For subsequent accesses, the UE provides a Temp ID, which is assigned to
the UE by the 5GC, to enable the NG-RAN to route the NAS message to the
appropriate AMF as long as the Temp ID is valid (NG-RAN is aware of and can
reach the AMF which is associated with the Temp ID). Otherwise, the methods
for initial attach applies.
**Resource isolation between slices**
\- The NG-RAN supports resource isolation between slices. NG-RAN resource
isolation may be achieved by means of RRM policies and protection mechanisms
that should avoid that shortage of shared resources in one slice breaks the
service level agreement for another slice. It should be possible to fully
dedicate NG-RAN resources to a certain slice. Some RACH resources can be
associated to specific NSAG(s). Other aspects how NG-RAN supports resource
isolation is implementation dependent.
**Access control**
\- By means of the unified access control (see clause 7.4), operator-defined
access categories can be used to enable differentiated handling for different
slices. NG-RAN may broadcast barring control information (i.e. a list of
barring parameters associated with operator-defined access categories) to
minimize the impact of congested slices.
**Slice Availability**
\- Some slices may be available only in part of the network. The NG-RAN
supported S-NSSAI(s), NSAG(s) and NSAG related information such as NSAG
associated Cell Reselection Priority and/or NSAG associated RACH resources are
configured by OAM. Awareness in the NG-RAN of the slices supported in the
cells of its neighbours may be beneficial for inter-frequency mobility in
connected mode. In order to support the NSAG, the NG-RAN provides the AMF with
the NSAG information per TA in the appropriate NG interface management
procedures, as specified in TS 38.413 [26]. Awareness in the NG-RAN of the
NSAG information supported in the list(s) of neighbour cells may be configured
by OAM, or exchanged with neighbour NG-RAN nodes.It is assumed that the slice
availability does not change within the UE\'s registration area (see TS 23.501
[3]).
\- The NG-RAN and the 5GC are responsible to handle a service request for a
slice that may or may not be available in a given area. Admission or rejection
of access to a slice may depend by factors such as support for the slice,
availability of resources, support of the requested service by NG-RAN.
**Support for UE associating with multiple network slices simultaneously**
\- In case a UE is associated with multiple slices simultaneously, only one
signalling connection is maintained and for intra-frequency cell reselection,
the UE always tries to camp on the best cell. For inter-frequency cell
reselection, dedicated priorities can be used to control the frequency on
which the UE camps.
**Granularity of slice awareness**
\- Slice awareness in NG-RAN is introduced at PDU session level, by indicating
the S-NSSAI corresponding to the PDU Session, in all signalling containing PDU
session resource information.
**Validation of the UE rights to access a network slice**
\- It is the responsibility of the 5GC to validate that the UE has the rights
to access a network slice. Prior to receiving the Initial Context Setup
Request message, the NG-RAN may be allowed to apply some provisional/local
policies, based on awareness of which slice the UE is requesting access to.
During the initial context setup, the NG-RAN is informed of the slice for
which resources are being requested.
### 16.3.2 AMF and NW Slice Selection
#### 16.3.2.1 CN-RAN interaction and internal RAN aspects
NG-RAN selects AMF based on a Temp ID or NSSAI provided by the UE over RRC as
specified in TS 38.410 [16]. The mechanisms used in the RRC protocol are
described in the next clause.
Table 16.3.2.1-1 AMF selection based on Temp ID and NSSAI
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | > Temp ID | > NSSAI | > AMF Selection by | | | | > NG-RAN | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | > not available or | > not available | > One of the default | | > invalid | | > AMFs is selected | | | | > (NOTE) | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | > not available or | > present | > Selects AMF which | | > invalid | | > supports UE | | | | > requested slices | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | > valid | > not available, or | > Selects AMF per CN | | | > present | > identity | | | | > information in | | | | > Temp ID | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | NOTE: The set of | | | | default AMFs is | | | | configured in the | | | | NG-RAN nodes via | | | | OAM. | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
#### 16.3.2.2 Radio Interface Aspects
When triggered by the upper layer, the UE conveys the NSSAI over RRC in the
format explicitly indicated by the upper layer.
### 16.3.3 Resource Isolation and Management
#### 16.3.3.1 General
Resource isolation enables specialized customization and avoids one slice
affecting another slice.
Hardware/software resource isolation is up to implementation. Each slice may
be assigned with either shared, prioritized or dedicated radio resource up to
RRM implementation and SLA as in TS 28.541 [49].
To enable differentiated handling of traffic for network slices with different
SLA:
\- NG-RAN is configured with a set of different configurations for different
network slices by OAM;
\- To select the appropriate configuration for the traffic for each network
slice, NG-RAN receives relevant information indicating which of the
configurations applies for this specific network slice.
Slice-based RACH configuration for RA isolation and prioritization can be
included in SIB1 messages. The slice-based RACH configurations are associated
to specific NSAG(s), and if not provided for a NSAG that UE considers for
selecting the RACH configuration, then the UE does not consider the NSAG for
selecting the slice-based RACH configuration. The UE determines the NSAG to be
considered during RA as specified in TS 23.501 [3]. When the UE AS does not
receive any NSAG information from NAS for Random Access, the UE does not apply
the slice-based RACH configuration.
#### 16.3.3.2 Handling of Slice Resources
The NG-RAN node may use Multi-Carrier Resource Sharing or Resource
Repartitioning to allocate resources to a slice during the procedures
described in 16.3.4 to support the slice service continuity in case of slice
resources shortage.
In Multi-Carrier Resource Sharing the RAN node can setup the dual connectivity
or carrier aggregation with different frequency and overlapping coverage where
the same slice is available.
The Resource Repartitioning allows a slice to use resources from the shared
pool or/and prioritized pool when its own dedicated or prioritized resources
are not available and the use of unused resources in the prioritized pool is
as specified in TS 28.541 [49].
Slice RRM policies/restrictions associated with Resource Repartitioning are
configured from O&M.
Measurements of RRM policy utilization according to resource types defined in
TS 28.541 [49] are reported from RAN nodes to O&M and may lead O&M to update
the configuration of the Slice RRM policies/restrictions.
### 16.3.3a Slice-based cell reselection
Slice-based cell reselection information can be included in SIB16 and in
_RRCRelease_ messages. The slice-based cell reselection information may
include reselection priorities per NSAG per frequency and corresponding
list(s) of cells where the slices of the NSAG are supported or not supported.
The UE determines the NSAG(s) and their priorities to be considered during
cell reselection as specified in TS 23.501 [3], and in TS 38.304 [10].
When a UE supports slice-based cell reselection, and when slice-based cell
reselection information is provided to the UE, then the UE uses the slice-
based cell reselection information. Valid cell reselection information
provided in _RRCRelease_ always has a priority over cell reselection
information provided in SIB messages. When no slice-based cell reselection
information is provided for any NSAG that was determined to be considered
during cell reselection (as specified in TS 23.501 [3]), then the UE uses the
general cell reselection information, i.e., without considering the NSAG(s)
and their priorities.
### 16.3.4 Signalling Aspects
#### 16.3.4.1 General
In this clause, signalling flows related to the realization of network slicing
in the NG-RAN are given.
#### 16.3.4.2 AMF and NW Slice Selection
RAN selects the AMF based on a Temp ID or NSSAI provided by the UE.
Figure 16.3.4.2-1: AMF selection
In case a Temp ID is not available, the NG-RAN uses the NSSAI provided by the
UE at RRC connection establishment to select the appropriate AMF (the
information is provided after MSG3 of the random access procedure). If such
information is also not available, the NG-RAN routes the UE to one of the
configured default AMF(s).
The NG-RAN uses the list of supported S-NSSAI(s) previously received in the NG
Setup Response message when selecting the AMF with the NSSAI. This list may be
updated via the AMF Configuration Update message.
#### 16.3.4.3 UE Context Handling
Following the initial access, the establishment of the RRC connection and the
selection of the correct AMF, the AMF establishes the complete UE context by
sending the Initial Context Setup Request message to the NG-RAN over NG-C. The
message contains the Allowed NSSAI and additionally contains the S-NSSAI(s) as
part of the PDU session(s) resource description when present in the message.
Upon successful establishment of the UE context and allocation of PDU session
resources to the relevant network slice(s) when present, the NG-RAN responds
with the Initial Context Setup Response message.
Figure 16.3.4.3-1: Network Slice-aware Initial Context Setup
#### 16.3.4.4 PDU Session Setup Handling
When new PDU sessions need to be established, the 5GC requests the NG-RAN to
allocate/ resources relative to the relevant PDU sessions by means of the PDU
Session Resource Setup procedures over NG-C. One S-NSSAI is added per PDU
session to be established, so NG-RAN is enabled to apply policies at PDU
session level according to the SLA represented by the network slice, while
still being able to apply (for example) differentiated QoS within the slice.
NG-RAN confirms the establishment of the resources for a PDU session
associated to a certain network slice by responding with the PDU Session
Resource Setup Response message over the NG-C interface.
Figure 16.3.4.4-1: Network Slice-aware PDU Session Resource Setup
#### 16.3.4.5 Mobility
To make mobility slice-aware in case of Network Slicing, S-NSSAI is introduced
as part of the PDU session information that is transferred during mobility
signalling. This enables slice-aware admission and congestion control.
Both NG and Xn handovers are allowed regardless of the slice support of the
target NG-RAN node i.e. even if the target NG-RAN node does not support the
same slices as the source NG-RAN node. An example for the case of connected
mode mobility across different Registration Areas is shown in Figure
16.3.4.5-1 for the case of NG based handover and in Figure 16.3.4.5-2 for the
case of Xn based handover.
Figure 16.3.4.5-1: NG based mobility across different Registration Areas
Figure 16.3.4.5-2: Xn based mobility across different Registration Areas
## 16.4 Public Warning System
NR connected to 5GC provides support for public warning systems (PWS) through
means of system information broadcast capability. NR is responsible for
scheduling and broadcasting of the warning messages as well as for paging the
UE to provide indication that the warning message is being broadcast:
\- Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System: ETWS is a public warning system
developed to meet the regulatory requirements for warning notifications
related to earthquake and/or tsunami events (see TS 22.168 [14]). ETWS warning
notifications can either be a primary notification (short notification) or
secondary notification (providing detailed information).
\- Commercial Mobile Alert System: CMAS is a public warning system developed
for the delivery of multiple, concurrent warning notifications (see TS 22.268
[15]).
Different SIBs are defined for ETWS primary notification, ETWS secondary
notification and CMAS notification. Paging is used to inform UEs about ETWS
indication and CMAS indication (see clause 9.2.5). UE monitors ETWS/CMAS
indication in its own paging occasion for RRC_IDLE and for RRC_INACTIVE while
no SDT procedure (see clause 18.0) is ongoing. UE monitors ETWS/CMAS
indication in any paging occasion for RRC Connected and during the SDT
procedure in RRC_INACTIVE. Paging indicating ETWS/CMAS notification triggers
acquisition of system information (without delaying until the next
modification period).
Enhancements of public warning system (ePWS) enable broadcast of language-
independent content and notifications to UEs with no user interface or with a
user interface that is incapable of displaying text, see clause 9 in TS 22.268
[15] and TS 23.041 [54]. ETWS/CMAS notifications with ePWS functionality use
the same AS mechanisms as ETWS/CMAS.
KPAS and EU-Alert are public warning systems developed for the delivery of
multiple, concurrent warning notifications (see TS 22.268 [15]). KPAS and EU-
Alert uses the same AS mechanisms as CMAS. Therefore, the NR procedures
defined for CMAS equally apply for KPAS and EU-Alert.
## 16.5 Emergency Services
### 16.5.1 Overview
NG-RAN provides support for Emergency Services either directly or through
fallback mechanisms towards E-UTRA. The support of Emergency Services is
broadcast in system information (see TS 38.331 [12]).
### 16.5.2 IMS Emergency call
An IMS Emergency call support indication is provided to inform the UE that
emergency bearer services are supported. In normal service state the UE is
informed if the PLMN supports emergency services through an Emergency Service
Support indicator in the Attach and TAU procedures (see TS 23.501 [3]). In
limited service state and for emergency services other than eCall over IMS, a
UE is informed about if a cell supports emergency services over NG-RAN from a
broadcast indication (_ims-EmergencySupport_). The broadcast indicator is set
to \"support\" if any AMF in a non-shared environment or at least one of the
PLMN\'s in a shared environment supports IMS emergency bearer services.
### 16.5.3 eCall over IMS
NG-RAN broadcast an indication to indicate support of eCall over IMS
(_eCallOverIMS-Support_). UEs that are in limited service state need to
consider both _eCallOverIMS-Support_ and _ims-EmergencySupport_ to determine
if eCall over IMS is possible. UEs that are not in limited service state need
to only consider _eCallOverIMS-Support_ to determine if eCall over IMS is
possible. The broadcast indicator is set to \"support\" if the PLMN in a non-
shared environment, or all PLMNs in a shared environment, supports eCall over
IMS.
### 16.5.4 Fallback
RAT fallback towards E-UTRA connected to 5GC is performed when NR does not
support Emergency Services and System fallback towards E-UTRA connected to EPS
is performed when 5GC does not support Emergency Services. Depending on
factors such as CN interface availability, network configuration and radio
conditions, the fallback procedure results in either CONNECTED state mobility
(handover procedure) or IDLE state mobility (redirection) - see TS 23.501 [3]
and TS 38.331 [12].
## 16.6 Stand-Alone NPN
### 16.6.1 General
An SNPN is a network deployed for non-public use which does not rely on
network functions provided by a PLMN (see clause 4.8). An SNPN is identified
by a PLMN ID and NID (see clause 8.2) broadcast in SIB1.
An SNPN-capable UE supports the SNPN access mode. When the UE is set to
operate in SNPN access mode, the UE only selects and registers with SNPNs.
When the UE is not set to operate in SNPN access mode, the UE performs normal
PLMN selection procedures.
Emergency services and ETWS /CMAS can be supported by SNPNs. An IMS Emergency
call support indication is provided per SNPN to inform the UE which SNPN(s)
support emergency bearer. In normal service state the indication is provided
in the same way as in case of PLMNs (see clause 16.5.2). In limited service
state and for emergency services other than eCall over IMS, a UE is informed
whether an SNPN of the cell supports emergency services over NG-RAN from a per
SNPN broadcast indication (_imsEmergencySupportForSNPN_). The broadcast
indicator for an SNPN may be set to \"support\" if any AMF of the SNPN
supports IMS emergency bearer services.
NR-NR Dual Connectivity within a single SNPN is supported.
### 16.6.2 Mobility
#### 16.6.2.1 General
The same principles as described in 9.2 apply to SNPN except for what is
described below.
UEs operating in SNPN access mode only (re)select cells within the
selected/registered SNPN and a cell can only be considered as suitable if the
PLMN and NID broadcast by the cell matches the selected/registered SNPN.
In addition, manual selection of SNPN(s) is supported, for which HRNN(s) can
be optionally provided.
The roaming and access restrictions applicable to SNPN are described in clause
9.4.
#### 16.6.2.2 Inactive Mode
The mobility of a UE in inactive mode builds on existing functionality
described in clause 9.2.2 and is limited to the SNPN identified within the
mobility restrictions received in the UE context.
#### 16.6.2.3 Connected Mode
The NG-RAN node is aware of the SNPN ID(s) supported by neighbour cells.
At the time of handover, cells that do not support the serving SNPN ID are not
considered as candidate target cells by the source NG-RAN node.
The target NG-RAN node performs access control. In case it cannot accept the
handover for the serving SNPN the target NG-RAN node fails the handover
including an appropriate cause value.
16.6.3 Self-Configuration for SNPN
Self-configuration is described in clause 15. In addition, on NG, the NG-RAN
node signals the SNPN ID(s) supported per tracking area and the AMF signals
the SNPN ID(s) supported per node; on Xn, NG-RAN nodes exchange SNPN ID(s)
supported per cell.
16.6.4 Access Control
During the establishment of the UE-associated logical NG-connection towards
the 5GC, the AMF checks whether the UE is allowed to access the cell for the
signalled SNPN ID as specified in TS 23.501 [3].
If the check is successful, the AMF sets up the UE-associated logical NG-
connection and provides the NG-RAN node with the mobility restrictions
applicable for the SNPN.
If the check is not successful, the AMF shall reject setting up the UE-
associated NG connection and inform the NG-RAN node with an appropriate cause
value as specified in TS 23.501 [3].
16.6.5 Access with subscription/credentials owned by a Credentials Holder
An SNPN may allow access to UEs being authorized using credentials or
subscription owned by a separate Credentials Holder (CH). The support of this
feature is uniform across the SNPN as specified in TS 23.501 [3].
The following information is broadcast to support SNPN access with
subscription of a Credentials Holder:
\- an indication per SNPN in SIB1 that access using credentials from a
Credentials Holder is supported;
\- optionally a list of supported GINs in SIB18 (each GIN may be assigned to
one or more SNPNs);
\- an optional indication per SNPN in SIB1 that the SNPN allows registration
attempts from UEs that are not explicitly configured to select the SNPN.
The above listed items are forwarded to the UE NAS layer that uses them for
SNPN selection.
16.6.6 Support of UE onboarding and remote provisioning
An SNPN may offer support for restricted 3GPP connectivity for remote
provisioning of credentials. The feature is enabled/disabled per cell.
The following information is broadcast to support UE onboarding and remote
provisioning:
\- an indication per onboarding SNPN in SIB1 that UE onboarding is enabled;
\- optionally a list of supported GINs in SIB18 (each GIN may be assigned to
one or more onboarding SNPNs).
The above listed items are forwarded to the UE NAS layer that uses them for
onboarding SNPN selection. When a UE intends to perform onboarding, it sends
the onboarding request indication to the gNB during RRC connection
establishment.
The NG-RAN nodes receive information about onboarding support capabilities of
the AMF(s). This information is used by the NG-RAN node to select a suitable
AMF when receiving the onboarding request indication from the UE.
## 16.7 Public Network Integrated NPN
### 16.7.1 General
A PNI-NPN is a network deployed for non-public use which relies on network
functions provided by a PLMN (see clause 4.8). In PNI-NPN, a Closed Access
Groups (CAG) identifies a group of subscribers who are permitted to access one
or more CAG cells associated to the CAG. A CAG is identified by a CAG
identifier broadcast in SIB1.
A CAG-capable UE can be configured with the following per PLMN (see clause
5.30.3.3 of TS 23.501 [3]):
\- an Allowed CAG list containing the CAG identifiers which the UE is allowed
to access; and
\- a CAG-only indication if the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG
cells.
Dual Connectivity is supported and may involve both PNI-NPN and PLMN cells,
according to the mobility restrictions in the UE context as described in TS
37.340 [21].
### 16.7.2 Mobility
#### 16.7.2.1 General
The same principles as described in 9.2 apply to CAG cells except for what is
described below.
Cell selection/reselection to CAG cells may be based on a UE autonomous search
function, which determines itself when/where to search, but cannot contradict
the dedicated cell reselection priority information if any is stored.
A range of PCI values reserved by the network for use by CAG cells may be
broadcast.
A CAG Member Cell for a UE is a cell broadcasting the identity of the selected
PLMN, registered PLMN or equivalent PLMN, and for that PLMN, a CAG identifier
belonging to the Allowed CAG list of the UE for that PLMN. The UE checks the
suitability of CAG cells based on the Allowed CAG list provided by upper
layers and a CAG-only cell can only be suitable for its subscribers but can be
acceptable for the rest.
NOTE: A non-CAG-capable UE (e.g. Rel-15 UE) considers a CAG-only cell as
acceptable cell if the cell is not barred to Rel-15 UEs, and if a PLMN ID
without CAG list is broadcast and that PLMN is forbidden (e.g. by use of a
PLMN ID for which all registration attempts are rejected such that the PLMN ID
becomes forbidden).
When the UE is configured with a CAG-only indication, only CAG Member Cells
can be suitable. A non-suitable cell can be acceptable though if the UE is
configured with a CAG-only indication for one of the PLMN broadcast by the
cell.
In addition, manual selection of CAG cell(s) is supported, for which an
HRNN(s) can be optionally provided.
The roaming and access restrictions applicable to PNI-NPN are described in
clause 9.4.
#### 16.7.2.2 Inactive Mode
The mobility of a UE in inactive mode builds on existing functionality
described in clause 9.2.2 according to the mobility restrictions received in
the UE context.
#### 16.7.2.3 Connected Mode
The source NG-RAN node is aware of the list of CAG IDs supported by the
candidate target cells which are CAG cells.
At the time of handover, the source NG-RAN node determines a target cell among
the candidates which is compatible with the received PNI-NPN restrictions.
At incoming handover, the target NG-RAN node receives the PNI-NPN mobility
restrictions and checks that the selected target cell is compatible with the
received mobility restrictions.
Mobility between PNI-NPN and PLMN cells is supported according to the mobility
restrictions in the UE context.
### 16.7.3 Self-Configuration for PNI-NPN
Self-configuration is described in clause 15.
In addition, each NG-RAN node informs the connected neighbour NG-RAN nodes of
the list of supported CAG ID(s) per CAG cell in the appropriate Xn interface
management procedures.
### 16.7.4 Access Control
During the establishment of the UE-associated logical NG-connection towards
the 5GC, the AMF checks whether the UE is allowed to access the cell as
specified in TS 23.501 [3].
If the check is successful, the AMF sets up the UE-associated logical NG-
connection and provides the NG-RAN node with the list of CAGs allowed for the
UE and, whether the UE is allowed to access non-CAG cells. This information is
used by the NG-RAN for access control of subsequent mobility.
If the check is not successful, the AMF shall reject setting up the UE-
associated NG connection and inform the NG-RAN node with an appropriate cause
value as specified in TS 23.501 [3].
### 16.7.5 Paging
The NG-RAN node may receive a paging message including the list of CAGs
allowed for the UE, and whether the UE is allowed to access non-CAG cells. The
NG-RAN node may use this information to avoid paging in cells on which the UE
is not allowed to camp.
For UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state, the NG-RAN node may page a neighbour NG-RAN
node including the list of CAGs allowed for the UE, and whether the UE is
allowed to access non-CAG cells. The neighbour NG-RAN node may use this
information to avoid paging in cells on which the UE is not allowed to camp.
## 16.8 Support for Time Sensitive Communications
Time Sensitive Communications (TSC), as defined in TS 23.501 [3], is a
communication service that supports deterministic communication and/or
isochronous communication with high reliability and availability. Examples of
such services are the ones in the area of Industrial Internet of Things, e.g.
related to cyber-physical control applications as described in TS 22.104 [39].
To support strict synchronization accuracy requirements of TSC applications,
the gNB may signal 5G system time reference information to the UE using
unicast or broadcast RRC signalling with a granularity of 10 ns. Uncertainty
parameter may be included in reference time information to indicate its
accuracy. The UE may indicate to the gNB a preference to be provisioned with
reference time information using UE Assistance Information procedure.
Propagation delay compensation (PDC) mechanisms may be applied based on RTT or
TA, and can be performed at the UE or gNB side. When performed at UE side, the
PDC mechanisms are controlled via RRC signalling by the gNB.
The RTT-based PDC mechanism is achieved by using Rx-Tx time difference
measurements of a single pair of configured TRS/PRS and SRS. The following
figure describes the signalling procedures of UE-side RTT-based PDC:
Figure 16.8-1: Signalling Procedure of UE-side RTT-based PDC
1\. The gNB provides measurement configurations to the UE;
2a/b. The gNB transmits TRS or PRS to the UE for measurements, and the UE
transmits SRS to the gNB for measurement;
3a/b. Both the UE and the gNB perform Rx-Tx time difference measurements;
4\. The gNB provides its Rx-Tx time difference measurement to the UE;
5\. The UE performs PDC based on Rx-Tx time difference measurements from
itself and the gNB.
The following figure describes the signalling procedures of gNB-side RTT-based
PDC:
Figure 16.8-2: Signalling Procedure of gNB-side RTT-based PDC
1\. The gNB provides measurement configurations to the UE;
2a/b. The gNB transmits TRS or PRS to the UE for measurements, and the UE
transmits SRS to the gNB for measurement;
3a/b. Both the UE and the gNB perform Rx-Tx time difference measurements;
4\. The UE reports its Rx-Tx time difference measurement to the gNB;
5\. The gNB performs PDC based on Rx-Tx time difference measurements from
itself and the UE.
The gNB may also receive TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI), see TS 23.501
[3], from the Core Network, e.g. during QoS flow establishment, or from
another gNB during handover. TSCAI contains additional information about the
traffic flow such as burst arrival time, burst periodicity, and survival time.
TSCAI knowledge may be leveraged in the gNB\'s scheduler to more efficiently
schedule periodic, deterministic traffic flows either via Configured Grants,
Semi-Persistent Scheduling or with dynamic grants, and/or to improve the
associated link reliability to meet the survival time requirement (see TS
22.104 [39]).
To support uplink periodic traffics of services with survival time
requirement, configured grant resources can be used such that the mapping
relation between the service and the configured grant is known to both gNB and
UE, thus allowing the gNB to use configured grant retransmission scheduling
(addressed by CS-RNTI) to trigger survival time state entry for the
corresponding DRB. Upon survival time state entry, all RLC entities configured
for the DRB are activated by the UE for duplication to prevent failure of
subsequent messages and hence fulfilling the survival time requirement. If CA
or DC duplication for the DRB is already activated, the DRB should enter
survival time state when any retransmission grant for any of its active LCHs
is received.
## 16.9 Sidelink
### 16.9.1 General
In this clause, an overview of NR sidelink communication and how NG-RAN
supports NR sidelink communication and V2X sidelink communication is given.
V2X sidelink communication is specified in TS 36.300 [2].
The NG-RAN architecture supports the PC5 interface as illustrated in Figure
16.9.1-1. Sidelink transmission and reception over the PC5 interface are
supported when the UE is inside NG-RAN coverage, irrespective of which RRC
state the UE is in, and when the UE is outside NG-RAN coverage.
Figure 16.9.1-1: NG-RAN Architecture supporting the PC5 interface
Support of V2X services via the PC5 interface can be provided by NR sidelink
communication and/or V2X sidelink communication. NR sidelink communication may
be used to support other services than V2X services.
NR sidelink communication can support one of three types of transmission modes
for a pair of a Source Layer-2 ID and a Destination Layer-2 ID in the AS:
\- **Unicast transmission** , characterized by:
\- Support of one PC5-RRC connection between peer UEs for the pair;
\- Transmission and reception of control information and user traffic between
peer UEs in sidelink;
\- Support of sidelink HARQ feedback;
> \- Support of sidelink transmit power control;
\- Support of RLC AM;
\- Detection of radio link failure for the PC5-RRC connection.
\- **Groupcast transmission** , characterized by:
\- Transmission and reception of user traffic among UEs belonging to a group
in sidelink;
\- Support of sidelink HARQ feedback.
\- **Broadcast transmission** , characterized by:
> \- Transmission and reception of user traffic among UEs in sidelink.
### 16.9.2 Radio Protocol Architecture for NR sidelink communication
#### 16.9.2.1 Overview
The AS protocol stack for the control plane for SCCH for RRC in the PC5
interface consists of RRC, PDCP, RLC and MAC sublayers, and the physical
layer. The protocol stack of control plane for SCCH for RRC is shown in Figure
16.9.2.1-1.
Figure 16.9.2.1-1: Control plane protocol stack for SCCH for RRC.
For support of PC5-S protocol specified in TS 23.287 [40], PC5-S is located on
top of PDCP, RLC and MAC sublayers, and the physical layer in the control
plane protocol stack for SCCH for PC5-S, as shown in Figure 16.9.2.1-2.
Figure 16.9.2.1-2: Control plane protocol stack for SCCH for PC5-S.
The AS protocol stack for SBCCH in the PC5 interface consists of RRC, RLC, MAC
sublayers, and the physical layer as shown below in Figure 16.9.2.1-3.
Figure 16.9.2.1-3: Control plane protocol stack for SBCCH.
The AS protocol stack for user plane in the PC5 interface consists of SDAP,
PDCP, RLC and MAC sublayers, and the physical layer. The protocol stack of
user plane is shown in Figure 16.9.2.1-4.
Figure 16.9.2.1-4: User plane protocol stack for STCH.
Sidelink Radio bearers (SLRB) are categorized into two groups: sidelink data
radio bearers (SL DRB) for user plane data and sidelink signalling radio
bearers (SL SRB) for control plane data. Separate SL SRBs using different
SCCHs are configured for PC5-RRC and PC5-S signalling respectively.
#### 16.9.2.2 MAC
The MAC sublayer provides the following services and functions over the PC5
interface in addition to the services and functions specified in clause 6.2.1:
\- Radio resource selection;
\- Packet filtering;
\- Priority handling between uplink and sidelink transmissions for a given UE;
\- Sidelink CSI reporting.
With LCP restrictions in MAC, only sidelink logical channels belonging to the
same destination can be multiplexed into a MAC PDU for every unicast,
groupcast and broadcast transmission which is associated to the destination.
NG-RAN can also control whether a sidelink logical channel can utilise the
resources allocated to a configured sidelink grant Type 1 (see clause
16.9.3.2). For transmissions to RX UE(s) using SL DRX operation, LCP ensures
that a TX UE transmits data in the active time of the RX UE(s).
For packet filtering, a SL-SCH MAC header including portions of both Source
Layer-2 ID and a Destination Layer-2 ID is added to each MAC PDU as specified
in clause 8.4. LCID included within a MAC subheader uniquely identifies a
logical channel within the scope of the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination
Layer-2 ID combination.
The following logical channels are used in sidelink:
\- Sidelink Control Channel (SCCH): a sidelink channel for transmitting
control information (i.e. PC5-RRC and PC5-S messages) and NR sidelink
discovery messages from one UE to other UE(s);
\- Sidelink Traffic Channel (STCH): a sidelink channel for transmitting user
information from one UE to other UE(s);
\- Sidelink Broadcast Control Channel (SBCCH): a sidelink channel for
broadcasting sidelink system information from one UE to other UE(s).
The following connections between logical channels and transport channels
exist:
\- SCCH can be mapped to SL-SCH;
\- STCH can be mapped to SL-SCH;
\- SBCCH can be mapped to SL-BCH.
#### 16.9.2.3 RLC
The services and functions of the RLC sublayer as specified in clause 6.3.2
are supported for sidelink. TM is used for SBCCH. Both UM and AM are used in
unicast transmission while only UM is used in groupcast or broadcast
transmission. For UM, only unidirectional transmission is supported for
groupcast and broadcast.
#### 16.9.2.4 PDCP
The services and functions of the PDCP sublayer as specified in clause 6.4.1
are supported for sidelink with some restrictions:
\- Out-of-order delivery is supported only for unicast transmission;
\- Duplication is not supported over the PC5 interface.
#### 16.9.2.5 SDAP
The SDAP sublayer provides the following service and function over the PC5
interface:
\- Mapping between a QoS flow and a sidelink data radio bearer.
There is one SDAP entity per destination for one of unicast, groupcast and
broadcast which is associated to the destination. Reflective QoS is not
supported over the PC5 interface.
#### 16.9.2.6 RRC
The RRC sublayer provides the following services and functions over the PC5
interface:
\- Transfer of a PC5-RRC message between peer UEs;
\- Maintenance and release of a PC5-RRC connection between two UEs;
\- Detection of sidelink radio link failure for a PC5-RRC connection;
\- Measurement configuration and reporting related to sidelink.
A PC5-RRC connection is a logical connection between two UEs for a pair of
Source and Destination Layer-2 IDs which is considered to be established after
a corresponding PC5 unicast link is established as specified in TS 23.287
[40]. There is one-to-one correspondence between the PC5-RRC connection and
the PC5 unicast link. A UE may have multiple PC5-RRC connections with one or
more UEs for different pairs of Source and Destination Layer-2 IDs.
Separate PC5-RRC procedures and messages are used for a UE to transfer UE
capability and sidelink configuration to the peer UE, as specified in TS
38.331 [3]. Both peer UEs can exchange their own UE capability and sidelink
configuration using separate bi-directional procedures in both sidelink
directions.
If it is not interested in sidelink transmission, if sidelink RLF on the
PC5-RRC connection is declared, or if the Layer-2 link release procedure is
completed as specified in TS 23.287 [40], UE releases the PC5-RRC connection.
### 16.9.3 Radio Resource Allocation
#### 16.9.3.1 General
For NR sidelink communication, the UE can operate in two modes as specified in
5.7.2 for resource allocation in sidelink:
\- Scheduled resource allocation, characterized by:
\- The UE needs to be RRC_CONNECTED in order to transmit data;
\- NG-RAN schedules transmission resources.
\- UE autonomous resource selection, characterized by:
\- The UE can transmit data when inside NG-RAN coverage, irrespective of which
RRC state the UE is in, and when outside NG-RAN coverage;
\- The UE autonomously selects transmission resources from resource pool(s).
For NR sidelink communication, the UE performs sidelink transmissions only on
a single carrier.
#### 16.9.3.2 Scheduled Resource Allocation
NG-RAN can dynamically allocate resources to the UE via the SL-RNTI on
PDCCH(s) for NR sidelink communication.
In addition, NG-RAN can allocate sidelink resources to a UE with two types of
configured sidelink grants:
\- With type 1, RRC directly provides the configured sidelink grant only for
NR sidelink communication;
\- With type 2, RRC defines the periodicity of the configured sidelink grant
while PDCCH can either signal and activate the configured sidelink grant, or
deactivate it. The PDCCH is addressed to SL-CS-RNTI for NR sidelink
communication.
Besides, NG-RAN can also semi-persistently allocate sidelink resources to the
UE via the SL Semi-Persistent Scheduling V-RNTI on PDCCH(s) for V2X sidelink
communication.
For the UE performing NR sidelink communication, there can be more than one
configured sidelink grant activated at a time on the carrier configured for
sidelink transmission.
When beam failure or physical layer problem occurs on MCG, the UE can continue
using the configured sidelink grant Type 1 until initiation of the RRC
connection re-establishment procedure as specified in TS 38.331 [12]. During
handover, the UE can be provided with configured sidelink grants via handover
command, regardless of the type. If provided, the UE activates the configured
sidelink grant Type 1 upon reception of the handover command or execution of
CHO.
The UE can send sidelink buffer status report to support scheduler operation
in NG-RAN. For NR sidelink communication, the sidelink buffer status reports
refer to the data that is buffered in for a group of logical channels (LCG)
per destination in the UE. Eight LCGs are used for reporting of the sidelink
buffer status reports. Two formats, which are SL BSR and truncated SL BSR, are
used.
#### 16.9.3.3 UE Autonomous Resource Selection
The UE autonomously selects sidelink resource(s) from resource pool(s)
provided by broadcast system information or dedicated signalling while inside
NG-RAN coverage or by pre-configuration while outside NG-RAN coverage.
For NR sidelink communication, the resource pool(s) can be provided for a
given validity area where the UE does not need to acquire a new pool of
resources while moving within the validity area, at least when this pool is
provided by SIB. The NR SIB area scope mechanism as specified in TS 38.331
[12] is reused to enable validity area for SL resource pool configured via
broadcasted system information.
The UE is allowed to temporarily use UE autonomous resource selection with
random selection for sidelink transmission based on configuration of the
exceptional transmission resource pool as specified in TS 38.331 [12].
### 16.9.4 Uu Control
#### 16.9.4.1 General
When a UE is inside NG-RAN coverage, NR sidelink communication and/or V2X
sidelink communication can be configured and controlled by NG-RAN via
dedicated signalling or system information:
\- The UE should support and be authorized to perform NR sidelink
communication and/or V2X sidelink communication in NG-RAN;
\- If configured, the UE performs V2X sidelink communication as specified in
TS 36.300 [2] unless otherwise specified, with the restriction that the
dynamic scheduling for V2X sidelink communication (i.e. based on SL-V-RNTI) is
not supported;
\- NG-RAN can provide the UE with intra-carrier sidelink configuration, inter-
carrier sidelink configuration and anchor carrier(s) which provide sidelink
configuration via a Uu carrier for NR sidelink communication and/or V2X
sidelink communication;
\- When the UE cannot simultaneously perform both NR sidelink transmission and
NR uplink transmission in time domain, prioritization between both
transmissions is done based on their priorities and thresholds configured by
the NG-RAN or pre-configured. When the UE cannot simultaneously perform both
V2X sidelink transmission and NR uplink transmission in time domain,
prioritization between both transmissions is done based on the priorities
(i.e. PPPP) of V2X sidelink communication and a threshold configured by the
NG-RAN or pre-configured.
When a UE is outside NG-RAN coverage, SL DRB configuration(s) are
preconfigured to the UE for NR sidelink communication. If UE changes the RRC
state but has not received the SL DRB configuration(s) for the new RRC state,
UE continues using the configuration obtained in the previous RRC state to
perform sidelink data transmissions and receptions until the configuration for
the new RRC state is received.
#### 16.9.4.2 Control of connected UEs
The UE in RRC_CONNECTED performs NR sidelink communication and/or V2X sidelink
communication, as configured by the upper layers. The UE sends Sidelink UE
Information to NG-RAN in order to request or release sidelink resources and
report QoS information for each destination.
NG-RAN provides _RRCReconfiguration_ to the UE in order to provide the UE with
dedicated sidelink configuration. The _RRCReconfiguration_ may include SL DRB
configuration(s) for NR sidelink communication as well as mode 1 resource
configuration and/or mode 2 resource configuration. If UE has received SL DRB
configuration via system information, UE should continue using the
configuration to perform sidelink data transmissions and receptions until a
new configuration is received via the _RRCReconfiguration_.
NG-RAN may also configure measurement and reporting of CBR for NR sidelink
communication and V2X sidelink communication, and reporting of location
information for V2X sidelink communication to the UE via _RRCReconfiguration_.
During handover, the UE performs sidelink transmission and reception based on
configuration of the exceptional transmission resource pool or configured
sidelink grant Type 1 and reception resource pool of the target cell as
provided in the handover command.
#### 16.9.4.3 Control of idle/inactive UEs
The UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE performs NR sidelink communication and/or
V2X sidelink communication, as configured by the upper layers. NG-RAN may
provide common sidelink configuration to the UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE
via system information for NR sidelink communication and/or V2X sidelink
communication. UE receives resource pool configuration and SL DRB
configuration via _SIB12_ for NR sidelink communication as specified in TS
38.331 [12], and/or resource pool configuration via _SIB13_ and _SIB14_ for
V2X sidelink communication as specified in TS 38.331 [12].
When the UE performs cell reselection, the UE interested in V2X service(s)
considers at least whether NR sidelink communication and/or V2X sidelink
communication are supported by the cell. The UE may consider the following
carrier frequency as the highest priority frequency, except for the carrier
only providing the anchor carrier:
\- the frequency providing both NR sidelink communication configuration and
V2X sidelink communication configuration, if configured to perform both NR
sidelink communication and V2X sidelink communication;
\- the frequency providing NR sidelink communication configuration, if
configured to perform only NR sidelink communication.
\- the frequency providing V2X sidelink communication configuration, if
configured to perform only V2X sidelink communication.
When the UE performs cell reselection, the UE interested in ProSe service(s)
considers at least whether NR sidelink communication/discovery is supported by
the cell. The UE may consider the carrier frequency providing NR sidelink
communication/discovery configuration as the highest priority frequency,
except for the carrier only providing the anchor carrier.
### 16.9.5 Sidelink Discovery
The UE may perform NR sidelink discovery while in-coverage or out-of-coverage
for non-relay operation.
The Relay discovery mechanism described in clause 16.12.3 (except the U2N
Relay specific threshold based discovery message transmission and U2N Relay
specific resource allocation mode restriction) is also applied to sidelink
discovery.
### 16.9.6 SL DRX
#### 16.9.6.1 General
Sidelink supports SL DRX for unicast, groupcast, and broadcast. Similar
parameters as defined in clause 11 for Uu (on-duration, inactivity-timer,
retransmission-timer, cycle) are defined for SL to determine the SL active
time for SL DRX. During the SL active time, the UE performs SCI monitoring for
data reception (i.e., PSCCH and 2^nd^ stage SCI on PSSCH). The UE may skip
monitoring of SCI for data reception during SL DRX inactive time.
The actual parameters supported for each cast type (unicast, groupcast,
broadcast) are specified in the following clauses.
The SL active time of the RX UE includes the time in which any of its
applicable SL on-duration timer(s), SL inactivity-timer(s) or SL HARQ
retransmission timer(s) (for any of unicast, groupcast, or broadcast) are
running. In addition, the slots associated with announced periodic
transmissions by the TX UE and the time in which a UE is expecting CSI report
following a CSI request (for unicast) are considered as SL active time of the
RX UE. The time for the unicast _link establishment procedure and the time for
the PC5 RRC reconfiguration with initial SL DRX configuration procedure_ as
specified in clause 5.28.2 of TS 38.321 [6] _are considered as SL active time
of the RX UE._
The TX UE maintains a set of timers corresponding to the SL DRX timers in the
RX UE(s) for each pair of source/destination L2 ID for unicast or destination
L2 ID for groupcast/broadcast. When data is available for transmission to one
or more RX UE(s) configured with SL DRX, the TX UE selects resources taking
into account the active time of the RX UE(s).
The UE can determine from SIB12 whether the gNB supports SL DRX or not.
#### 16.9.6.2 Unicast
For unicast, SL DRX is configured per pair of source L2 ID and destination L2
ID.
The UE maintains a set of SL DRX timers for each direction per pair of source
L2 ID and destination L2 ID. The SL DRX configuration for a pair of
source/destination L2 IDs for a direction may be negotiated between the UEs in
the AS layer. For SL DRX configuration of each direction, where one UE is the
TX UE and the other is the RX UE:
\- RX UE may send assistance information, which includes its desired SL on-
duration timer, SL DRX start offset, SL DRX slot offset, and SL DRX cycle, to
the TX UE and the TX UE using mode 2 resource allocation may use it to
determine the SL DRX configuration for the RX UE;
\- Regardless of whether assistance information is provided or not, the TX UE
in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE/OOC, or in RRC_CONNECTED and using mode 2 resource
allocation, determines the SL DRX Configuration for the RX UE. For a TX UE in
RRC_CONNECTED and using mode 1 resource allocation, the SL DRX configuration
for the RX UE is determined by the serving gNB of the TX UE;
\- TX UE sends the SL DRX configuration to be used by the RX UE to the RX UE;
\- The RX UE may accept or reject the SL DRX configuration.
When the TX UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and using mode 1 resource allocation, the
TX UE may report the received assistance information or the received SL DRX
configuration reject information to its serving gNB supporting SL DRX and
sends the SL DRX configuration to the RX UE upon receiving the SL DRX
configuration in dedicated RRC signalling from the gNB. When the RX UE is in
RRC_CONNECTED and using mode 1 resource allocation, the RX UE can report the
received SL DRX configuration to its serving gNB supporting SL DRX, e.g. for
alignment of the Uu and SL DRX configurations.
SL on-duration timer, SL inactivity-timer, SL HARQ RTT timer, and SL HARQ
retransmission timer are supported in unicast. SL HARQ RTT timer and SL HARQ
retransmission timer are maintained per SL process at the RX UE. In addition
to (pre)configured values for each of these timers, SL HARQ RTT timer value
can be derived from the retransmission resource timing when SCI indicates more
than one transmission resource. SL HARQ RTT timer can be set to different
values to support both HARQ enabled and HARQ disabled transmissions.
SL DRX MAC CE is introduced for SL DRX operation in unicast only.
#### 16.9.6.3 Groupcast/Broadcast
For groupcast/broadcast, SL DRX is configured commonly among multiple UEs
based on QoS profile and Destination L2 ID. Multiple SL DRX configurations can
be supported for each of groupcast/broadcast.
SL on-duration timer, SL inactivity-timer, SL HARQ RTT and SL HARQ
retransmission timers are supported for groupcast. Only SL on-duration timer
is supported for broadcast. SL DRX cycle, SL on-duration, and SL inactivity
timer (only for groupcast) are configured per QoS profile. The starting offset
and slot offset of the SL DRX cycle is determined based on the destination L2
ID. The SL HARQ RTT timer (only for groupcast) and SL HARQ retransmission
timer (only for groupcast) are not configured per QoS profile or per
destination L2 ID. For groupcast, the RX UE maintains a SL inactivity timer
for each destination L2 ID, and selects the largest SL inactivity timer value
if multiple SL inactivity timer values associated with different QoS profiles
are configured for that L2 ID. For groupcast and broadcast, the RX UE
maintains a single SL DRX cycle (selected as the smallest SL DRX cycle of any
QoS profile of that L2 ID) and single SL on-duration (selected as the largest
SL on-duration of any QoS profile of that L2 ID) for each destination L2 ID
when multiple QoS profiles are configured for that L2 ID.
For groupcast, SL HARQ RTT timer and SL HARQ retransmission timer are
maintained per SL process at the RX UE. SL HARQ RTT timer can be set to
different values to support both HARQ enabled and HARQ disabled transmissions.
A default SL DRX configuration, common between groupcast and broadcast, can be
used for a QoS profile which is not mapped onto any non-default SL DRX
configuration(s). The default SL DRX configuration for groupcast and broadcast
can also be used for discovery message in sidelink discovery in clause 16.9.5
and relay discovery messages in clause 16.12.3, for ProSe Direct Link
Establishment Request message as specified in TS 24.554 [55], and for Direct
Link Establishment Request message as specified in TS 24.587 [53].
In-coverage TX and RX UEs in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE obtain their SL DRX
configuration from SIB. UEs (TX or RX) in RRC_CONNECTED can obtain the SL DRX
configuration from SIB, or from dedicated RRC signalling during handover. For
the out of coverage case, the SL DRX configuration is obtained from pre-
configuration.
For groupcast, the TX UE restarts its timer corresponding to the SL inactivity
timer for the destination L2 ID (used for determining the allowable
transmission time) upon reception of new data with the same destination L2 ID.
TX profile is introduced to ensure compatibility for groupcast and broadcast
communication between UEs supporting/not-supporting SL DRX functionality. A TX
profile is provided by upper layers to AS layer and identifies one or more
sidelink feature group(s). Multiple TX profiles with the support of SL DRX and
without the support of SL DRX can be associated to a destination L2 ID. For a
given destination L2 ID, all TX and RX UEs should be configured with the same
set of TX profile(s). A UE only assumes SL DRX for the given destination L2 ID
when all the associated TX profiles correspond to support of SL DRX. A UE
assumes no SL DRX for the given destination L2 ID if there is no associated TX
profile. An RX UE determines that SL DRX is used if all destination L2 IDs of
interest are assumed to support SL DRX. For groupcast, when the UE is in
RRC_CONNECTED and using mode 1 resource allocation, the UE reports each
destination L2 ID and associated SL DRX on/off indication to the gNB
supporting SL DRX.
#### 16.9.6.4 Alignment between Uu DRX and SL DRX
Alignment of Uu DRX and SL DRX for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED is supported for
unicast, groupcast, and broadcast. Alignment of Uu DRX and SL DRX at the same
UE is supported. In addition, for mode 1 resource allocation, the alignment of
Uu DRX of the TX UE and SL DRX of the RX UE is supported.
Alignment may comprise of either full overlap or partial overlap in time
between Uu DRX and SL DRX. For SL RX UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, alignment is
achieved by the gNB.
### 16.9.7 Power Savings Resource Allocation
The SL UE in Mode 2 can support partial sensing-based resource allocation and
random resource selection as power saving resource allocation methods. A SL
mode 2 TX resource pool can be (pre)configured to allow full sensing only,
partial sensing only, random selection only, or any combination(s) thereof. A
UE decides which resource allocation scheme(s) can be used in the AS based on
its capability (for a UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE/OOC) and the allowed
resource schemes in the resource pool configuration.
Random resource selection is applicable to both periodic and aperiodic
traffic.
A UE capable for partial sensing can perform periodic-based partial sensing
and/or contiguous partial sensing for resource (re)selection. Periodic-based
partial sensing can only be performed if periodic resource reservation is
configured in the resource pool. In periodic-based partial sensing, the UE
monitors slots in periodic sensing occasion(s) for a given resource
reservation periodicity. Contiguous partial sensing is performed by a UE
capable of partial sensing when resource (re)selection is triggered by a UE in
a TX pool configured with partial sensing. In contiguous partial sensing, the
UE monitors slots in a contiguous sensing window which occur prior to the
selected transmission resource.
### 16.9.8 Inter-UE Coordination (IUC)
The SL UE can support inter-UE coordination (IUC) in Mode 2, whereby a UE
sends information about resources to a peer UE, which the peer UE then uses
for resource (re)selection. The following schemes of inter-UE coordination are
supported:
\- IUC scheme 1, where the IUC information sent from a UE to a peer UE is the
preferred or non-preferred resources for the peer UE\'s transmission, and
\- IUC scheme 2, where the IUC information sent from a UE to a peer UE is the
presence of expected/potential resource conflict on the resources indicated by
the peer UE\'s SCI.
In scheme 1, the transmission of IUC information from a UE can be triggered by
a condition at this UE, or by an explicit request from a peer UE. The UE
determines the set of resources reserved by other UEs or slots where the UE,
when it is the intended receiver of the peer UE, does not expect to perform SL
reception from the peer UE due to half-duplex operation. The UE uses these
resources as the set of non-preferred resources, or excludes these resources
to determine a set of preferred resources and sends the preferred/non-
preferred resources to the peer UE. Regarding the IUC information received
from the UE, the peer UE\'s resources for resource (re)selection can be based
on both the peer UE\'s sensing results (if available) and the IUC information,
or it can be based only on the IUC information. For scheme 1, MAC CE and
second-stage SCI or MAC CE only can be used to send IUC information. For IUC
information transmission triggered by an explicit request, both the explicit
request and the IUC information are transmitted in unicast manner. For IUC
information transmission triggered by a condition other than the explicit
request, the IUC information indicating preferred resource set is transmitted
in unicast manner, and the IUC information indicating non-preferred resource
set is transmitted in unicast, groupcast or broadcast manner.
In scheme 2, a UE determines the expected/potential resource conflict within
the resources indicated by a peer UE\'s SCI as either resources reserved by
other UEs and identified by the UE as fully/partially overlapping with the
resources indicated by the peer UE\'s SCI, or as slots where the UE is the
intended receiver of the peer UE and does not expect to perform SL reception
on those slots due to half-duplex operation. The peer UE uses the conflicting
resources to determine the resources to be reselected and exclude the
conflicting resources from the reselected resources. For scheme 2, PSFCH is
used to send IUC information.
## 16.10 Multicast and Broadcast Services
### 16.10.1 General
NR system enables resource efficient delivery of multicast/broadcast services
(MBS).
For broadcast communication service, the same service and the same specific
content data are provided simultaneously to all UEs in a geographical area
(i.e., all UEs in the broadcast service area as defined in TS 23.247 [45] are
authorized to receive the data). A broadcast communication service is
delivered to the UEs using a broadcast session. A UE can receive a broadcast
communication service in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED state.
For multicast communication service, the same service and the same specific
content data are provided simultaneously to a dedicated set of UEs (i.e., not
all UEs in the MBS service area as defined in TS 23.247 [45] are authorized to
receive the data). A multicast communication service is delivered to the UEs
using a multicast session. A UE can receive a multicast communication service
in RRC_CONNECTED state with mechanisms such as PTP and/or PTM delivery, as
defined in clause 16.10.5.4. HARQ feedback/retransmission can be applied to
both PTP and PTM transmission.
### 16.10.2 Network Architecture
The overall NG-RAN architecture specified in clause 4 applies for NR MBS. MBS
multicast can only be supported in MCG side in NE-DC and NR-DC scenarios,
i.e., only for MN-terminated MCG MRB. The configuration of MBS broadcast on
SCG is not supported for the UE.
The QoS model for NR MBS can be found in TS 23.247 [45].
### 16.10.3 Protocol Architecture
Figure 16.10.3-1 and 16.10.3-2 depict the downlink Layer 2 architecture for
multicast session and broadcast session respectively, where MBS protocol stack
comprises the same layer 2 sublayers as described in clause 6 with the
following differences:
\- SDAP sublayer provides only the following functionalities:
\- Mapping between an MBS QoS flow and an MRB;
\- Transfer of user plane data.
\- PDCP sublayer provides only the following functionalities:
\- Transfer of user plane data;
\- Maintenance of PDCP SNs;
\- Header compression and decompression using the ROHC protocol or EHC
protocol;
\- Reordering and in-order delivery;
\- Duplicate discarding.
\- For a multicast session, gNB provides one or more of the following
multicast MRB configuration(s) to the UE via dedicated RRC signalling:
\- Multicast MRB with DL only RLC-UM or bidirectional RLC-UM configuration for
PTP transmission;
\- Multicast MRB with RLC-AM entity configuration for PTP transmission;
\- Multicast MRB with DL only RLC-UM entity for PTM transmission;
\- Multicast MRB with two RLC-UM entities, one DL only RLC-UM entity for PTP
transmission and the other DL only RLC-UM entity for PTM transmission;
\- Multicast MRB with three RLC-UM entities, one DL RLC-UM entity and one UL
RLC-UM entity for PTP transmission and the other DL only RLC-UM entity for PTM
transmission;
\- Multicast MRB with two RLC entities, one RLC-AM entity for PTP transmission
and the other DL only RLC-UM entity for PTM transmission.
\- For a multicast session, gNB may change the MRB type using RRC signalling.
Figure 16.10.3-1: Downlink Layer 2 Architecture for Multicast Session
\- For broadcast session, gNB provides the following broadcast MRB
configuration to the UE using broadcast RRC signalling:
\- Broadcast MRB with one DL only RLC-UM entity for PTM transmission.
Figure 16.10.3-2: Downlink Layer 2 Architecture for Broadcast Session
### 16.10.4 Group Scheduling
The following logical channels are used for MBS delivery:
\- MTCH: A PTM downlink channel for transmitting MBS data of either multicast
session or broadcast session from the network to the UE;
\- DTCH: A PTP channel defined in clause 6.2.2 for transmitting MBS data of a
multicast session from the network to the UE;
\- MCCH: A PTM downlink channel used for transmitting MBS broadcast control
information associated to one or several MTCH(s) from the network to the UE.
The following connections between logical channels and transport channels for
PTM transmission exist:
\- MCCH can be mapped to DL-SCH;
\- MTCH can be mapped to DL-SCH.
The following depicts the usage of RNTI for PTM transmission:
\- A UE can receive different services using same or different G-RNTIs;
\- A UE can receive different services using same or different G-CS-RNTIs.
### 16.10.5 Multicast Handling
#### 16.10.5.1 Session Management
There are two delivery modes as specified in TS 23.247 [45]:
\- 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery;
\- 5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery.
As specified in TS 23.247 [45], if the gNB supports MBS, the network shall use
the 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery in which case an MBS Session Resource
context for a multicast session is setup in the gNB when the first UE joins
the multicast session.
For 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery mode, shared NG-U resources are used to
provide MBS user data to the gNB. The gNB initiates the Multicast Distribution
Setup procedure towards the 5GC, to allocate shared NG-U resources for a
multicast session. In case multiple MBS session areas as specified in TS
23.247 [45] are associated with the same multicast session for location
dependent MBS services, multiple NG-U shared resources are established for the
same multicast session per MBS Area Session ID served by the gNB.
A shared NG-U resource applies one of the following transport options:
\- unicast transport;
\- multicast transport.
For 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery an MBS Session Resource comprises one or
several MRBs. If minimisation of data loss is applied for a given MRB,
synchronisation of allocation of PDCP COUNT values is applied by either or a
combination of the following methods:
\- derivation of the PDCP COUNT values by means of a DL MBS QFI Sequence
Number provided on NG-U. Synchronisation in terms of MBS QoS flow to MRB
mapping and PDCP SN size of the corresponding MRB among gNBs are achieved by
means of network implementation.
\- deployment of a Shared NG-U Termination at NG-RAN, shared among gNBs, which
comprises a common entity for assignment of PDCP COUNT values. Synchronisation
in terms of MBS QoS flow to MRB mapping and PDCP SN size of the corresponding
MRB among gNBs may be achieved by means of network implementation.
If PDCP COUNT values are derived from a DL MBS QFI Sequence Number provided on
NG-U and only one QoS Flow is mapped to an MRB, the gNB shall set the PDCP
COUNT value of PDCP PDU to the value of the DL MBS QFI Sequence Number
provided with the received packet over NG-U. If PDCP COUNT values are derived
from a DL MBS QFI Sequence Number provided on NG-U and multiple QoS Flows are
mapped to an MRB, the gNB may derive the PDCP COUNT value of the PDCP PDU from
the sum of the DL MBS QFI Sequence Numbers of the QoS Flows mapped to this
MRB.
NOTE: Synchronisation of PDCP COUNT values in case user data for MBS QoS flows
mapped to the same MRB arrive over NG-U at different gNBs in different order
or in case of loss of data over NG-U, and related handling of minimisation of
data loss is left to implementation.
#### 16.10.5.2 Configuration
A UE can receive data of MBS multicast session only in RRC_CONNECTED state. If
the UE which joined a multicast session is in RRC_CONNECTED state and when the
multicast session is activated, the gNB may send _RRCReconfiguration_ message
with relevant MBS configuration for the multicast session to the UE.
When there is temporarily no data to be sent to the UEs for a multicast
session that is active, the gNB may move the UE to RRC_INACTIVE state. When an
MBS multicast session is deactivated, the gNB may move the UE to RRC_IDLE or
RRC_INACTIVE state. gNBs supporting MBS use a group notification mechanism to
notify the UEs in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE state when a multicast session has
been activated by the CN. gNBs supporting MBS use a group notification
mechanism to notify the UEs in RRC_INACTIVE state when the session is already
activated and the gNB has multicast session data to deliver. Upon reception of
the group notification, the UEs reconnect to the network or resume the
connection and transition to RRC_CONNECTED state. The group notification is
addressed with P-RNTI on PDCCH, and the paging channels are monitored by the
UE as described in clause 9.2.5. Paging message for group notification
contains MBS session ID which is utilized to page all UEs in RRC_IDLE and
RRC_INACTIVE states that joined the associated MBS multicast session, i.e.,
UEs are not paged individually. The UE stops monitoring for group
notifications related to a specific multicast session, i.e., stops checking
for the MBS session ID in the Paging message, when the UE enters RRC_CONNECTED
state. The UE does not monitor for group notifications for these cases, i.e.,
once this UE leaves this multicast session or the network requests the UE to
leave, or the network releases the multicast session.
If the UE in RRC_IDLE state that joined an MBS multicast session is camping on
the gNB not supporting MBS, the UE may be notified by CN-initiated paging
where CN pages each UE individually due to session activation or data
availability, as described in clause 9.2.5. If the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state
that joined MBS multicast session is camping on the gNB not supporting MBS,
the UE may be notified individually by RAN-initiated paging due to session
activation or data availability, as described in clause 9.2.5.
#### 16.10.5.3 Service Continuity
##### 16.10.5.3.1 General
Mobility principles build on existing functionality including functions
described in clause 9.2.
##### 16.10.5.3.2 Handover between Multicast supporting cells
Mobility procedures for multicast reception allow the UE to continue receiving
multicast service(s) via PTM or PTP in a new cell after handover.
During handover preparation phase, the source gNB transfers to the target gNB
about the MBS multicast sessions the UE has joined in the UE context
information. To support provision of local multicast service with location
dependent content as specified in TS 23.247 [45], for each active multicast
session, service area information per Area Session ID may be provided to the
target gNB.
The source gNB may propose data forwarding for some MRBs to minimize data loss
and may exchange the corresponding MRB PDCP Sequence Number with the target
gNB during the handover preparation:
\- The lossless handover for multicast service is supported for the handover
between MBS supporting cells if the UE is configured with PTP RLC AM entity in
target cell MRB of a UE, regardless of whether the UE is configured with PTP
RLC AM entity in the source cell or not.
\- In order to support lossless handover for multicast service, the network
has to ensure DL PDCP COUNT value synchronization and continuity between the
source cell and the target cell. Furthermore, data forwarding from the source
gNB to the target gNB and/or PDCP status report provided by a UE for an MRB
for multicast session can be used during lossless handover.
For each multicast session with ongoing user data transmission for which no
MBS Session Resources exist at the target gNB, the target gNB triggers the
setup of MBS user plane resources towards the 5GC using the NGAP Distribution
Setup procedure. If unicast transport is used, the target gNB provides the DL
tunnel endpoint to be used to the MB-SMF. If multicast transport is used, the
target gNB receives the IP multicast address from the MB-SMF.
During handover execution, the MBS configuration decided at target gNB is sent
to the UE via the source gNB within an RRC container as specified in TS 38.331
[12]. The PDCP entities for multicast MRBs in the UE can either be re-
established or remain as it is. When the UE connects to the target gNB, the
target gNB sends an indication that it is an MBS-supporting node to the SMF in
the Path Switch Request message (Xn handover) or Handover Request Acknowledge
message (NG handover).
Upon successful handover completion, the source gNB may trigger the release of
the MBS user plane resources towards the 5GC using the NGAP Distribution
Release procedure for any multicast session for which there is no remaining
joined UE in the gNB.
##### 16.10.5.3.3 Handover between Multicast-supporting cell and Multicast
non-supporting cell
During an MBS multicast session, at mobility from an MBS-supporting cell to an
MBS non-supporting cell, the target gNB sets up PDU Session Resources mapped
to the MBS multicast session. The 5GC infers from the absence of an \"MBS-
support\" indication from gNB in the Path Switch Request message (Xn handover)
or Handover Request Acknowledge message (NG handover) that MBS multicast data
packets delivery has to be switched to 5GC individual MBS traffic delivery as
specified in TS 23.247 [45]. If data forwarding is applied, the source gNB
infers from the handover preparation response message that the target gNB does
not support MBS and changes the QFI(s) in the forwarded packets to the
associated PDU Session QFI(s) if respective mapping information is available.
The source gNB may be aware that the target gNB is non-MBS supporting already
before Handover Preparation.
For mobility from MBS non-supporting cell to MBS-supporting cell, the existing
Xn/NG handover procedures apply. The 5GC infers from the presence of the
\"MBS-support\" indicator from gNB in the Path Switch Request message (Xn
handover) or in the Handover Request Acknowledge message (NG handover) that
MBS multicast data packets delivery can be switched from 5GC Individual MBS
traffic delivery to 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery. After Xn handover, the
SMF triggers switching MBS multicast data packets delivery from 5GC Individual
to 5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery by providing MBS Session IDs joined by the
UE to the target gNB by means of the PDU Session Resource Modification
procedure. For NG handover, the SMF provides the MBS Session IDs joined by the
UE to the target gNB by means of NGAP Handover Request. Minimization of data
loss and duplication avoidance may be applied by means of identical MBS QFI
SNs received over the shared NG-U tunnel against those received over unicast
NG-U tunnels or forwarding tunnels.
Mobility from a multicast-supporting cell to a multicast non-supporting cell
can be achieved by switching the MRB to a DRB in the source gNB before a
handover.
NOTE: A UE may be handed over to a target gNB not supporting MBS without prior
reconfiguration from MRB to the DRB in the source gNB. In this case, the AS
configuration may not be comprehended by the target gNB causing full
configuration.
##### 16.10.5.3.4 MRB reconfiguration
The gNB may use _RRCReconfiguration_ message to configure or reconfigure a
multicast MRB, e.g., add/release/modify the MRB\'s RLC entities as described
in clause 16.10.3. In order to minimize the data loss due to MRB
reconfiguration, gNB may configure UE to send a PDCP status report during
reconfiguration for MRB type change.
#### 16.10.5.4 Reception of MBS Multicast data
For multicast service, gNB may deliver MBS multicast data packets using the
following methods:
\- PTP Transmission: gNB individually delivers separate copies of MBS data
packets to each UEs independently, i.e., gNB uses UE-specific PDCCH with CRC
scrambled by UE-specific RNTI (e.g., C-RNTI) to schedule UE-specific PDSCH
which is scrambled with the same UE-specific RNTI.
\- PTM Transmission: gNB delivers a single copy of MBS data packets to a set
of UEs, e.g., gNB uses group-common PDCCH with CRC scrambled by group-common
RNTI to schedule group-common PDSCH which is scrambled with the same group-
common RNTI.
If a UE is configured with both PTM and PTP transmissions, a gNB dynamically
decides whether to deliver multicast data by PTM leg and/or PTP leg for a
given UE based on the protocol stack defined in clause 16.10.3, based on
information such as MBS Session QoS requirements, number of joined UEs, UE
individual feedback on reception quality, and other criteria. The same QoS
requirements apply regardless of the decision.
#### 16.10.5.5 Support of CA
UE can be configured to receive MBS multicast data either from a PCell or a
single SCell at a time.
#### 16.10.5.6 DRX
The following DRX configurations for PTM/PTP transmission are possible:
\- For PTM transmission, multicast DRX is configured per G-RNTI/G-CS-RNTI
which is independent of UE-specific DRX;
\- For PTP transmission, UE-specific DRX is reused, i.e., UE-specific DRX is
used for both unicast transmission and PTP transmission of MBS multicast. For
PTM retransmission via PTP, UE monitors PDCCH scrambled by C-RNTI/CS-RNTI
during UE-specific DRX\'s Active Time.
#### 16.10.5.7 Physical Layer
A CFR configured by _RRCReconfiguration_ message is defined for multicast
scheduling as an \'MBS frequency region\' with a number of contiguous PRBs
confined within and with the same numerology as the DL BWP, and multicast
scheduling may have specific characteristics (e.g., PDCCH, PDSCH and SPS
configurations).
Two HARQ-ACK reporting modes are defined for MBS:
\- For the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode, the UE generates HARQ-ACK
information with ACK value when a UE correctly decodes a transport block or
detects a DCI format indicating an SPS PDSCH release; otherwise, the UE
generates HARQ-ACK information with NACK value.
\- For the second HARQ-ACK reporting mode, the UE does not transmit a PUCCH
that would include only HARQ-ACK information with ACK values.
HARQ-ACK feedback for multicast can be enabled or disabled by higher layer
configuration per G-RNTI or per G-CS-RNTI and/or indication in the DCI
scheduling multicast transmission.
### 16.10.6 Broadcast Handling
#### 16.10.6.1 Session Management
For delivery of location dependent contents of a broadcast session, Area
Session ID is included in the NGAP broadcast session resource setup procedure
associated with MBS service area information and per Area Session ID NG-U
tunnels are established.
#### 16.10.6.2 Configuration
MBS broadcast can be received by UEs in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE and
RRC_CONNECTED state. A UE can receive the MBS configuration for broadcast
session (e.g., parameters needed for MTCH reception) via MCCH in RRC_IDLE,
RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED state. The parameters needed for the reception
of MCCH are provided via System Information.
The following principles govern the MCCH structure:
\- MCCH provides the list of all broadcast services with ongoing sessions
transmitted on MTCH(s) and the associated information for broadcast session
includes MBS session ID, associated G-RNTI scheduling information and
information about neighbouring cells providing certain service on MTCH(s).
MCCH content is transmitted within periodically occurring time domain windows,
referred to as MCCH transmission window defined by MCCH repetition period,
MCCH window duration and radio frame/slot offset;
\- MCCH uses a modification period and MCCH contents are only allowed to be
modified at each modification period boundary; a notification mechanism is
used to announce the change of MCCH contents due to broadcast session start,
modification or stop and due to neighbouring cell information modification;
NOTE: It is up to UE implementation to use the start and stop times in the USD
to determine when to start monitoring the MCCH for the session the UE is
interested in.
\- When the UE receives an MCCH change notification, it acquires the updated
MCCH in the same MCCH modification period where the change notification is
sent.
#### 16.10.6.3 Support of CA
UE can be configured to receive MBS broadcast data and MCCH either from a
PCell or a single SCell at a time. Meanwhile, dedicated RRC signalling is used
for providing SIB20 of the SCell i.e., while in RRC_CONNECTED state, UEs need
not acquire broadcast SIB20 directly from the SCells.
NOTE: The UE may be able to receive MBS broadcast also from a non-serving
cell, which is transparent to the network, e.g., it does not require UE
capability or MBS Interest Indication to be sent by the UE.
#### 16.10.6.4 DRX
Via MCCH, the UE can be configured with a PTM DRX configuration for G-RNTI
reception. One PTM DRX configuration can be mapped to more than one G-RNTI.
#### 16.10.6.5 Service Continuity
##### 16.10.6.5.0 General
Mobility principles build on existing functionality including functions
described in clause 9.2.
NR MBS supports MBS frequency layer prioritization for MBS broadcast sessions.
The gNBs may be configured with the MBS FSA ID(s) supported by each of their
cells. The gNBs may exchange this information with their neighbours within Xn
Setup messages and subsequent Xn Configuration Update messages to help with
frequency layer prioritization.
##### 16.10.6.5.1 Service Continuity in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE
Mobility procedures for MBS reception allow the UE to start or continue
receiving MBS service(s) when changing cells. The gNB may indicate in the MCCH
the list of neighbour cells providing the same MBS broadcast service(s) as
provided in the serving cell. This allows the UE, e.g., to request unicast
reception of the service before moving to a cell not providing the MBS
broadcast service(s) using PTM transmission. To avoid the need to read MBS
broadcast related system information and potentially MCCH on neighbour
frequencies, the UE is made aware of which frequency is providing which MBS
broadcast services via PTM, through User Service Description (USD), as defined
in TS 26.346 [46], or the combination of the following:
\- USD;
\- SIB21, as defined in clause 7.3.1.
NOTE: UE can request unicast reception of the service after moving to a cell
not providing the MBS broadcast service(s) using PTM transmission.
In RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE, the UE applies the normal cell reselection rules
with the following modifications:
\- the UE which is receiving or interested to receive MBS broadcast service(s)
via PTM and can only receive these MBS broadcast service(s) via PTM while
camping on the frequency providing these MBS broadcast service(s) is allowed
to make this frequency highest priority when the conditions described in TS
38.304 [10] are met;
\- when the MBS broadcast service(s) which the UE is interested in are no
longer available (after the end of the session) or the UE is no longer
interested in receiving the service(s), the UE no longer prioritises the
frequency providing these MBS broadcast service(s).
##### 16.10.6.5.2 Service Continuity in RRC_CONNECTED
To ensure service continuity of MBS broadcast, the UE in RRC_CONNECTED state
may send MBS Interest Indication to the gNB, consisting of the following
information:
\- List of MBS frequencies UE is receiving or interested to receive, sorted in
decreasing order of interest;
\- Priority between the reception of all listed MBS frequencies and the
reception of any unicast bearer and multicast MRB;
\- List of MBS broadcast services the UE is receiving or interested to
receive, in case SIB20 is provided for PCell or SCell.
MBS Interest Indication information reporting can be implicitly
enabled/disabled by the presence of SIB21.
The gNB may use this information, together with the information about the
UE\'s capabilities (e.g., supported band combinations), when providing an RRC
configuration and/or downlink assignments to the UE or to release
DRBs/multicast MRBs, to allow the UE to receive the MBS services the UE is
interested in. MBS Interest Indication information can be exchanged between
source gNB and target gNB during handover.
#### 16.10.6.5A Reception of MBS Broadcast data
For broadcast service, gNB may deliver Broadcast MBS data packets using the
following method:
\- PTM Transmission: gNB delivers a single copy of MBS data packets to a set
of UEs, e.g., gNB uses group-common PDCCH with CRC scrambled by group-common
RNTI to schedule group-common PDSCH which is scrambled with the same group-
common RNTI.
#### 16.10.6.6 Physical Layer
A CFR configured by SIB is defined for broadcast scheduling as an \'MBS
frequency region\' with a number of contiguous PRBs with a bandwidth equal to
or larger than CORESET0, with the same numerology as CORESET0, and broadcast
scheduling may have specific characteristics (e.g., PDCCH and PDSCH
configurations).
The maximum number of MIMO layers is one for MBS broadcast scheduling. RB-
level rate matching, and RE-level rate matching around LTE-CRS configured by
higher layer signalling are supported for MCCH and MTCH. Slot-level repetition
is supported for MTCH.
HARQ-ACK feedback is not supported for MBS broadcast.
Only dynamic scheduling is supported for MBS broadcast.
## 16.11 Minimization of Service Interruption
In case of a disaster, a radio access network can experience outage, which can
result in that UEs belonging to the network experience service interruptions.
For this scenario, another network not affected by the disaster, which during
non-disaster situations is considered by the UEs as a forbidden network, can
allow roaming of the UEs belonging to the network experiencing such disaster
service interruptions. Such roaming is referred to as disaster roaming. This
is further described in clause 5.40 of TS 23.501 [3] and 3.10 of TS 23.122
[47].
To allow such disaster roaming, a cell can broadcast a list of PLMNs with
disaster conditions for which disaster roaming is offered. Disaster roaming
service is provided only for the area that covers the area with disaster
condition.
Further, to be able to control the load that disaster roaming UEs put on a
cell, the cell can broadcast access control parameters applicable specifically
for disaster roaming UEs. Access attempts of disaster roaming UEs are based on
Access Identity 3. The network can for example set the access control
parameters for Access Identity 3 so that access attempts of disaster roaming
UEs are more likely to be barred compared to non-disaster roaming UEs.
## 16.12 Sidelink Relay
### 16.12.1 General
Sidelink relay is introduced to support 5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay (U2N
Relay) function (specified in TS 23.304 [48]) to provide connectivity to the
network for U2N Remote UE(s). Both L2 and L3 U2N Relay architectures are
supported. The L3 U2N Relay architecture is transparent to the serving NG-RAN
of the U2N Relay UE, except for controlling sidelink resources. The detailed
architecture and procedures for L3 U2N Relay can be found in TS 23.304 [48].
A U2N Relay UE shall be in RRC_CONNECTED to perform relaying of unicast data.
For L2 U2N Relay operation, the following RRC state combinations are
supported:
\- Both L2 U2N Relay UE and L2 U2N Remote UE shall be in RRC_CONNECTED to
perform transmission/reception of relayed unicast data; and
\- The L2 U2N Relay UE can be in RRC_IDLE, _RRC_INACTIVE_ or RRC_CONNECTED as
long as all the L2 U2N Remote UE(s) that are connected to the L2 U2N Relay UE
are either in _RRC_INACTIVE_ or in RRC_IDLE.
A single unicast link is established between one L2 U2N Relay UE and one L2
U2N Remote UE. The traffic to the NG-RAN of L2 U2N Remote UE via a given L2
U2N Relay UE and the traffic of the L2 U2N Relay UE shall be separated in
different Uu RLC channels.
For L2 U2N Relay, the L2 U2N Remote UE can only be configured to use resource
allocation mode 2 (as specified in 5.7.2 and 16.9.3.1) for data to be relayed.
### 16.12.2 Protocol Architecture
#### 16.12.2.1 L2 UE-to-Network Relay
The protocol stacks for the user plane and control plane of L2 U2N Relay
architecture are illustrated in Figure 16.12.2.1-1 and Figure 16.12.2.1-2. The
SRAP sublayer is placed above the RLC sublayer for both CP and UP at both PC5
interface and Uu interface. The Uu SDAP, PDCP and RRC are terminated between
L2 U2N Remote UE and gNB, while SRAP, RLC, MAC and PHY are terminated in each
hop (i.e., the link between L2 U2N Remote UE and the L2 U2N Relay UE and the
link between L2 U2N Relay UE and the gNB).
For L2 U2N Relay, the SRAP sublayer over PC5 hop is only for the purpose of
bearer mapping. The SRAP sublayer is not present over PC5 hop for relaying the
L2 U2N Remote UE\'s message on BCCH and PCCH. For L2 U2N Remote UE\'s message
on SRB0, the SRAP header is not present over PC5 hop, but the SRAP header is
present over Uu hop for both DL and UL.
Figure 16.12.2.1-1: User plane protocol stack for L2 UE-to-Network Relay
Figure 16.12.2.1-2: Control plane protocol stack for L2 UE-to-Network Relay
For L2 U2N Relay, for uplink:
\- The Uu SRAP sublayer performs UL bearer mapping between end-to-end Uu Radio
Bearers of L2 U2N remote UE (identified for the purposes of this mapping by
the local Remote UE ID and an associated bearer ID) and egress Uu Relay RLC
channels over the L2 U2N Relay UE Uu interface. For uplink relaying traffic,
the different end-to-end Uu Radio Bearers (SRBs or DRBs) of the same L2 U2N
Remote UE and/or different L2 U2N Remote UEs can be multiplexed over the same
egress Uu Relay RLC channel;
\- The Uu SRAP sublayer supports L2 U2N Remote UE identification for the UL
traffic. The identity information of L2 U2N Remote UE end-to-end Uu Radio
Bearer and a local Remote UE ID are included in the Uu SRAP header at UL in
order for gNB to correlate the received packets for the specific PDCP entity
associated with the right end-to-end Uu Radio Bearer of the L2 U2N Remote UE;
\- The PC5 SRAP sublayer at the L2 U2N Remote UE supports UL bearer mapping
between L2 U2N Remote UE end-to-end Uu Radio Bearers and egress PC5 Relay RLC
channels.
For L2 U2N Relay, for downlink:
\- The Uu SRAP sublayer performs DL bearer mapping at gNB to map end-to-end Uu
Radio Bearer (SRB, DRB) of L2 U2N Remote UE (identified for the purposes of
this mapping by the local Remote UE ID and an associated bearer ID) into Uu
Relay RLC channel. The Uu SRAP sublayer performs DL bearer mapping and data
multiplexing between multiple end-to-end Radio Bearers (SRBs or DRBs) of a L2
U2N Remote UE and/or different L2 U2N Remote UEs and one Uu Relay RLC channel
over the L2 U2N Relay UE Uu interface;
\- The Uu SRAP sublayer supports L2 U2N Remote UE identification for DL
traffic. The identity information of L2 U2N Remote UE end-to-end Uu Radio
Bearer and a local Remote UE ID are included into the Uu SRAP header by the
gNB at DL for the L2 U2N Relay UE to identify the corresponding end-to-end Uu
Radio Bearer(s) of L2 U2N Remote UE;
\- The PC5 SRAP sublayer at the L2 U2N Relay UE performs DL bearer mapping
between end-to-end Uu Radio Bearers of L2 U2N remote UE and egress PC5 Relay
RLC channels;
\- The PC5 SRAP sublayer at the L2 U2N Remote UE correlates the received
packets with the right PDCP entity associated with the given end-to-end Uu
Radio Bearer of the L2 U2N Remote UE based on the identity information
included in the PC5 SRAP header.
A local Remote UE ID is included in both PC5 SRAP header and Uu SRAP header.
L2 U2N Relay UE is configured by the gNB with the local Remote UE ID(s) to be
used in SRAP header. L2 U2N Remote UE obtains the local Remote ID from the gNB
via Uu RRC messages including _RRCSetup_ , _RRCReconfiguration_ , _RRCResume_
and _RRCReestablishment_.
The end-to-end DRB(s) or end-to-end SRB(s), except SRB0, of L2 U2N Remote UE
can be multiplexed to the PC5 Relay RLC channels and Uu Relay RLC channels in
both PC5 hop and Uu hop, but an end-to-end DRB and an end-to-end SRB can
neither be mapped into the same PC5 Relay RLC channel nor be mapped into the
same Uu Relay RLC channel.
It is the gNB responsibility to avoid collision on the usage of local Remote
UE ID. The gNB can update the local Remote UE ID by sending the updated local
Remote UE ID via _RRCReconfiguration_ message. The serving gNB can perform
local Remote UE ID update independent of the PC5 unicast link L2 ID update
procedure.
### 16.12.3 Relay Discovery
Model A and Model B discovery models as defined in TS 23.304 [48] are
supported for U2N Relay discovery. The protocol stack used for discovery is
illustrated in Figure 16.12.3-1.
Figure 16.12.3-1: Protocol Stack of Discovery Message for UE-to-Network Relay
The U2N Remote UE can perform Relay discovery message (i.e., as specified in
TS 23.304 [48]) transmission and may monitor the sidelink for Relay discovery
message while in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED. The network may
broadcast or configure via dedicated RRC signalling a Uu RSRP threshold, which
is used by the U2N Remote UE to determine if it can transmit Relay discovery
messages to U2N Relay UE(s).
The U2N Relay UE can perform Relay discovery message (i.e., as specified in TS
23.304 [48]) transmission and may monitor the sidelink for Relay discovery
message while in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED. The network may
broadcast or configure via dedicated RRC signalling a maximum Uu RSRP
threshold, a minimum Uu RSRP threshold, or both, which are used by the U2N
Relay UE to determine if it can transmit Relay discovery messages to U2N
Remote UE(s).
The network may provide the Relay discovery configuration using broadcast or
dedicated signalling. In addition, the U2N Remote UE and L3 U2N Relay UE may
use pre-configuration for Relay discovery.
The resource pool(s) used for NR sidelink communication can be used for Relay
discovery or the network may configure resource pool(s) dedicated for Relay
discovery. Resource pool(s) dedicated for Relay discovery can be configured
simultaneously with resource pool(s) for NR sidelink communication in system
information, dedicated signalling and/or pre-configuration. Whether dedicated
resource pool(s) for Relay discovery are configured is based on network
implementation. If resource pool(s) dedicated for Relay discovery are
configured, only those resource pool(s) dedicated for Relay discovery shall be
used for Relay discovery. If only resource pool(s) for NR sidelink
communication are configured, all the configured resource pool(s) can be used
for Relay discovery and NR sidelink communication.
For U2N Remote UE (including both in-coverage and out of coverage cases) that
has been connected to the network via a U2N Relay UE, only resource allocation
mode 2 is used for Relay discovery message transmission.
For in-coverage U2N Relay UE, and for both in-coverage and out of coverage U2N
Remote UEs, NR sidelink resource allocation principles are applied for Relay
discovery message transmission.
The sidelink power control for the transmission of Relay discovery messages is
same as for NR sidelink communication.
No ciphering or integrity protection in PDCP layer is applied for the Relay
discovery messages.
The U2N Remote UE and U2N Relay UE can determine from SIB12 whether the gNB
supports Relay discovery, or Non-Relay discovery, or both.
### 16.12.4 Relay Selection/Reselection
The U2N Remote UE performs radio measurements at PC5 interface and uses them
for U2N Relay selection and reselection along with higher layer criteria, as
specified in TS 23.304 [48]. When there is no unicast PC5 connection between
the U2N Relay UE and the U2N Remote UE, the U2N Remote UE uses SD-RSRP
measurements to evaluate whether PC5 link quality towards a U2N Relay UE
satisfies relay selection criterion.
For relay reselection, U2N Remote UE uses SL-RSRP measurements towards the
serving U2N Relay UE for relay reselection trigger evaluation when there is
data transmission from U2N Relay UE to U2N Remote UE, and it is left to UE
implementation whether to use SL-RSRP or SD-RSRP for relay reselection trigger
evaluation in case of no data transmission from U2N Relay UE to U2N Remote UE.
A U2N Relay UE is considered suitable by a U2N Remote UE in terms of radio
criteria if the PC5 link quality measured by U2N Remote UE towards the U2N
Relay UE exceeds configured threshold (pre-configured or provided by gNB). The
U2N Remote UE searches for suitable U2N Relay UE candidates that meet all AS
layer and higher layer criteria (see TS 23.304 [48]). If there are multiple
such suitable U2N Relay UEs, it is up to U2N Remote UE implementation to
choose one U2N Relay UE among them. For L2 U2N Relay (re)selection, the PLMN
ID and cell ID can be used as additional AS criteria.
The U2N Remote UE triggers U2N Relay selection in following cases:
\- Direct Uu signal strength of current serving cell of the U2N Remote UE is
below a configured signal strength threshold;
\- Indicated by upper layer of the U2N Remote UE.
The U2N Remote UE may trigger U2N Relay reselection in following cases:
\- PC5 signal strength of current U2N Relay UE is below a (pre)configured
signal strength threshold;
\- Cell reselection, handover, Uu RLF, or Uu RRC connection
establishment/resume failure has been indicated by U2N Relay UE via PC5-RRC
signalling;
\- When U2N Remote UE receives a PC5-S link release message from U2N Relay UE;
\- When U2N Remote UE detects PC5 RLF;
\- Indicated by upper layer.
For L2 U2N Remote UEs in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE and L3 U2N Remote UEs, the
cell (re)selection procedure and relay (re)selection procedure run
independently. If both suitable cells and suitable U2N Relay UEs are
available, it is up to the U2N Remote UE implementation to select either a
cell or a U2N Relay UE. A L3 U2N Remote UE may select a cell and a L3 U2N
Relay UE simultaneously and this is up to implementation of L3 U2N Remote UE.
For both L2 and L3 U2N Relay UEs in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, the PC5-RRC
message(s) are used to inform their connected U2N Remote UE(s) when U2N Relay
UEs select a new cell. The PC5-RRC message(s) are also used to inform their
connected L2 or L3 U2N Remote UE(s) when L2 or L3 U2N Relay UE performs
handover, detects Uu RLF, or its Uu RRC connection establishment/resume fails.
Upon reception of the PC5 RRC message for notification, it is up to U2N Remote
UE implementation whether to release or keep the unicast PC5 link. If U2N
Remote UE decides to release the unicast PC5 link, it triggers the PC5 release
procedure and may perform cell or relay reselection.
### 16.12.5 Control plane procedures for L2 U2N Relay
#### 16.12.5.1 RRC Connection Management
The L2 U2N Remote UE needs to establish its own PDU sessions/DRBs with the
network before user plane data transmission.
The NR sidelink PC5 unicast link establishment procedures can be used to setup
a secure unicast link between L2 U2N Remote UE and L2 U2N Relay UE before L2
U2N Remote UE establishes a Uu RRC connection with the network via L2 U2N
Relay UE.
The establishment of Uu SRB1/SRB2 and DRB of the L2 U2N Remote UE is subject
to Uu configuration procedures for L2 UE-to-Network Relay.
The following high level connection establishment procedure in Figure
16.12.5.1-1 applies to a L2 U2N Relay and L2 U2N Remote UE:
Figure 16.12.5.1-1: Procedure for L2 U2N Remote UE connection establishment
1\. The L2 U2N Remote and L2 U2N Relay UE perform discovery procedure, and
establish a PC5-RRC connection using the NR sidelink PC5 unicast link
establishment procedure.
2\. The L2 U2N Remote UE sends the first RRC message (i.e., _RRCSetupRequest_)
for its connection establishment with gNB via the L2 U2N Relay UE, using a
specified PC5 Relay RLC channel configuration. If the L2 U2N Relay UE is not
in RRC_CONNECTED, it needs to do its own Uu RRC connection establishment upon
reception of a message on the specified PC5 Relay RLC channel. After L2 U2N
Relay UE\'s RRC connection establishment procedure, gNB configures SRB0
relaying Uu Relay RLC channel to the U2N Relay UE. The gNB responds with an
_RRCSetup_ message to L2 U2N Remote UE. The _RRCSetup_ message is sent to the
L2 U2N Remote UE using SRB0 relaying Uu Relay RLC channel over Uu and a
specified PC5 Relay RLC channel over PC5.
NOTE 1: Void.
3\. The gNB and L2 U2N Relay UE perform relaying channel setup procedure over
Uu. According to the configuration from gNB, the L2 U2N Relay/Remote UE
establishes a PC5 Relay RLC channel for relaying of SRB1 towards the L2 U2N
Remote/Relay UE over PC5.
4\. The _RRCSetupComplete_ message is sent by the L2 U2N Remote UE to the gNB
via the L2 U2N Relay UE using SRB1 relaying channel over PC5 and SRB1 relaying
channel configured to the L2 U2N Relay UE over Uu. Then the L2 U2N Remote UE
is as in RRC_CONNECTED with the gNB.
5\. The L2 U2N Remote UE and gNB establish security following the Uu security
mode procedure and the security messages are forwarded through the L2 U2N
Relay UE.
6\. The gNB sends an _RRCReconfiguration_ message to the L2 U2N Remote UE via
the L2 U2N Relay UE, to setup the end-to-end SRB2/DRBs of the L2 U2N Remote
UE. The L2 U2N Remote UE sends an _RRCReconfigurationComplete_ message to the
gNB via the L2 U2N Relay UE as a response. In addition, the gNB may configure
additional Uu Relay RLC channels between the gNB and L2 U2N Relay UE, and PC5
Relay RLC channels between L2 U2N Relay UE and L2 U2N Remote UE for the
relaying traffic.
#### 16.12.5.2 Radio Link Failure
The L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED suspends Uu RLM (as described in clause
9.2.7) when connected to the gNB via a L2 U2N Relay UE.
The L2 U2N Relay UE declares Uu Radio Link Failure (RLF) following the same
criteria as described in clause 9.2.7.
After Uu RLF is declared, the L2 U2N Relay UE takes the following action on
top of the actions described in clause 9.2.7:
\- a PC5-RRC message can be used for sending an indication to its connected L2
U2N Remote UE(s), which may trigger RRC connection re-establishment for L2 U2N
Remote UE; or
\- indicating to upper layer to trigger PC5 unicast link release.
Upon detecting PC5 RLF, the L2 U2N Remote UE may trigger RRC connection re-
establishment.
#### 16.12.5.3 RRC Connection Re-establishment
The L2 U2N Remote UE may perform the following actions during the RRC
connection re-establishment procedure:
\- If only suitable cell(s) are available, the L2 U2N Remote UE initiates RRC
re-establishment procedure towards a suitable cell;
\- If only suitable L2 U2N Relay UE(s) are available, the L2 U2N Remote UE
initiates RRC re-establishment procedure towards a suitable relay UE\'s
serving cell via selected suitable L2 U2N Relay;
\- If both a suitable cell and a suitable relay are available, the L2 U2N
Remote UE can select either one to initiate RRC re-establishment procedure
based on implementation.
#### 16.12.5.4 RRC Connection Resume
The RRC connection resume procedure described in clause 9.2.2 is applied to L2
U2N Remote UE.
#### 16.12.5.5 System Information
The in-coverage L2 U2N Remote UE is allowed to acquire any necessary SIB(s)
over Uu interface irrespective of its PC5 connection to L2 U2N Relay UE. The
L2 U2N Remote UE can also receive the system information from the L2 U2N Relay
UE after PC5 connection establishment with L2 U2N Relay UE.
The L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED can use the on-demand SIB framework as
specified in TS 38.331 [12] to request the SIB(s) via L2 U2N Relay UE. The L2
U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE can inform L2 U2N Relay UE of its
requested SIB type(s) via PC5-RRC message. Then, L2 U2N Relay UE triggers on-
demand SI/SIB acquisition procedure as specified in TS38.331 [12] according to
its own RRC state (if needed) and sends the acquired SI(s)/SIB(s) to L2 U2N
Remote UE via PC5-RRC message.
Any SIB that the RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE L2 U2N Remote UE has a requirement
to use (e.g., for relay purpose) can be requested by the L2 U2N Remote UE
(from the L2 U2N Relay UE or the network). For SIBs that have been requested
by the L2 U2N Remote UE from the L2 U2N Relay UE, the L2 U2N Relay UE forwards
them again in case of any update for requested SIB(s). In case of
RRC_CONNECTED L2 U2N Remote UE(s), it is the responsibility of the network to
send updated SIB(s) to L2 U2N Remote UE(s) when they are updated. The L2 U2N
Remote UE de-configures SI request with L2 U2N Relay UE when entering into
RRC_CONNECTED state.
For SIB1 forwarding, for L2 U2N Remote UE, both request-based delivery (i.e.,
SIB1 request by the U2N Remote UE) and unsolicited forwarding are supported by
L2 U2N Relay UE, of which the usage is left to L2 U2N Relay UE implementation.
If SIB1 changes, for L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, the L2 U2N
Relay UE always forwards SIB1.
For the L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, the short message over
Uu interface is not forwarded by the L2 U2N Relay UE to the L2 U2N Remote UE.
The L2 U2N Relay UE can forward PWS SIBs to its connected L2 U2N Remote UE(s).
RAN sharing is supported for L2 U2N Relay UE. In particular, the L2 U2N Relay
UE may forward, via discovery message, cell access related information before
the establishment of a PC5-RRC connection.
#### 16.12.5.6 Paging
When both L2 U2N Relay UE and L2 U2N Remote UE are in RRC IDLE or RRC
INACTIVE, the L2 U2N Relay UE monitors paging occasions of its connected L2
U2N Remote UE(s). When a L2 U2N Relay UE needs to monitor paging for a L2 U2N
Remote UE, the L2 U2N Relay UE should monitor all POs of the L2 U2N Remote UE.
When L2 U2N Relay UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and L2 U2N Remote UE(s) is in
RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, there are two options for paging delivery:
\- The L2 U2N Relay UE monitors POs of its connected L2 U2N Remote UE(s) if
the active DL BWP of the L2 U2N Relay UE is configured with common search
space including paging search space;
\- The delivery of the L2 U2N Remote UE\'s paging can be performed through a
dedicated RRC message from the gNB to the L2 U2N Relay UE. The dedicated RRC
message for delivering L2 U2N Remote UE paging to the RRC_CONNECTED L2 U2N
Relay UE may contain one or more Remote UE IDs (5G-S-TMSI or I-RNTI).
It is up to network implementation to decide which of the above two options to
use. The L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_CONNECTED, if configured with paging search
space, can determine whether to monitor POs for a L2 U2N Remote UE based on
the indication within the PC5-RRC signalling received from the L2 U2N Remote
UE.
The L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE provides 5G-S-TMSI and UE specific DRX cycle
(if configured by upper layer) to the L2 U2N Relay UE for requesting to
perform PO monitoring. The L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_INACTIVE provides the
minimum value of two UE specific DRX cycles (if configured respectively by
upper layer and NG-RAN), 5G-S-TMSI and I-RNTI to the L2 U2N Relay UE for PO
monitoring. The L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_CONNECTED can notify the L2 U2N Remote
UE information (i.e. 5G-S-TMSI/I-RNTI) to the gNB via the
_SidelinkUEInformationNR_ message for paging delivery purpose. The L2 U2N
Relay UE receives paging messages to check the 5G-S-TMSI/I-RNTI and sends
relevant paging record to the L2 U2N Remote UE accordingly.
The L2 U2N Relay UE uses unicast signalling to send paging to the L2 U2N
Remote UE via PC5.
#### 16.12.5.7 Access Control
The L2 U2N Remote UE performs unified access control as defined in TS 38.331
[12]. The L2 U2N Relay UE does not perform UAC for L2 U2N Remote UE\'s data.
#### 16.12.5.8 Mobility Registration Update and RAN Area Update
The L2 U2N Remote UE performs Mobility Registration Update/RNAU based on the
L2 U2N Relay UE\'s serving cell when it is connected with the L2 U2N Relay UE.
A L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE initiates Mobility Registration
Update/RNAU procedure if the serving cell changes (due to cell change by the
L2 U2N Relay UE) and the new serving cell is outside of the L2 U2N Remote
UE\'s configured RNA/TA.
### 16.12.6 Service Continuity for L2 U2N relay
#### 16.12.6.0 General
The service continuity procedure is applicable only for the mobility cases of
path switch from indirect to direct path, and from direct to indirect path
when the L2 U2N Remote UE and L2 U2N Relay UE belong to the same gNB.
#### 16.12.6.1 Switching from indirect to direct path
For service continuity of L2 U2N Relay, the following procedure is used, in
case of L2 U2N Remote UE switching to direct path:
Figure 16.12.6.1-1: Procedure for L2 U2N Remote UE switching to direct Uu cell
1\. The Uu measurement configuration and measurement report signalling
procedures are performed to evaluate both relay link measurement and Uu link
measurement. The measurement results from L2 U2N Remote UE are reported when
configured measurement reporting criteria are met. The sidelink relay
measurement report shall include at least L2 U2N Relay UE\'s source L2 ID,
serving cell ID (i.e., NCGI/NCI), and sidelink measurement quantity result.
The sidelink measurement quantity can be SL-RSRP of the serving L2 U2N Relay
UE, and if SL-RSRP is not available, SD-RSRP is used.
2\. The gNB decides to switch the L2 U2N Remote UE onto direct Uu path.
3\. The gNB sends the _RRCReconfiguration_ message to the L2 U2N Remote UE.
The L2 U2N Remote UE stops User Plane and Control Plane transmission via the
L2 U2N Relay UE after reception of the _RRCReconfiguration_ message with the
path switch configuration.
4\. The L2 U2N Remote UE synchronizes with the gNB and performs Random Access.
5\. The UE (i.e., L2 U2N Remote UE in previous steps) sends the
_RRCReconfigurationComplete_ message to the gNB via the direct path, using the
configuration provided in the _RRCReconfiguration_ message. From this step,
the UE (i.e., L2 U2N Remote UE in previous steps) uses the RRC connection via
the direct path to the gNB.
6\. The gNB sends the _RRCReconfiguration_ message to the L2 U2N Relay UE to
reconfigure the connection between the L2 U2N Relay UE and the gNB. The
_RRCReconfiguration_ message to the L2 U2N Relay UE can be sent any time after
step 3 based on gNB implementation (e.g., to release Uu Relay RLC Channel and
PC5 Relay RLC channel configuration for relaying, and bearer mapping
configuration related to the L2 U2N Remote UE).
7\. Either L2 U2N Relay UE or L2 U2N Remote UE\'s AS layer indicates upper
layers to release PC5 unicast link after receiving the _RRCReconfiguration_
message from the gNB. The timing to execute link release is up to UE
implementation.
8\. The data path is switched from indirect path to direct path between the UE
(i.e., previous L2 U2N Remote UE) and the gNB. The PDCP re-establishment or
PDCP data recovery in uplink is performed by the UE (i.e., previous L2 U2N
Remote UE) for lossless delivery during path switch if gNB configures it.
NOTE: Step 8 can be executed any time after step 4. Step 8 is independent of
step 6 and step 7.
#### 16.12.6.2 Switching from direct to indirect path
The gNB can select a L2 U2N Relay UE in any RRC state i.e., RRC_IDLE,
RRC_INACTIVE, or RRC_CONNECTED, as a target L2 U2N Relay UE for direct to
indirect path switch.
For service continuity of L2 U2N Remote UE, the following procedure is used,
in case of the L2 U2N Remote UE switching to indirect path via a L2 U2N Relay
UE in RRC_CONNECTED:
Figure 16.12.6.2-1: Procedure for L2 U2N Remote UE switching to indirect path
via a L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_CONNECTED
1\. The L2 U2N Remote UE reports one or multiple candidate L2 U2N Relay UE(s)
and Uu measurements, after it measures/discovers the candidate L2 U2N Relay
UE(s):
\- The L2 U2N Remote UE filters the appropriate L2 U2N Relay UE(s) according
to relay selection criteria before reporting. The L2 U2N Remote UE shall
report only the L2 U2N Relay UE candidate(s) that fulfil the higher layer
criteria;
\- The reporting includes at least a L2 U2N Relay UE ID, a L2 U2N Relay UE\' s
serving cell ID, and a sidelink measurement quantity information. SD-RSRP is
used as sidelink measurement quantity.
2\. The gNB decides to switch the L2 U2N Remote UE to a target L2 U2N Relay
UE. Then the gNB sends an _RRCReconfiguration_ message to the target L2 U2N
Relay UE, which includes at least the L2 U2N Remote UE\'s local ID and L2 ID,
Uu Relay RLC channel and PC5 Relay RLC channel configuration for relaying, and
bearer mapping configuration.
3\. The gNB sends the _RRCReconfiguration_ message to the L2 U2N Remote UE.
The _RRCReconfiguration_ message includes at least the L2 U2N Relay UE ID,
Remote UE\'s local ID, PC5 Relay RLC channel configuration for relay traffic
and the associated end-to-end Uu radio bearer(s). The L2 U2N Remote UE stops
User Plane and Control Plane transmission over the direct path after reception
of the _RRCReconfiguration_ message from the gNB.
4\. The L2 U2N Remote UE establishes PC5 RRC connection with target L2 U2N
Relay UE.
5\. The L2 U2N Remote UE completes the path switch procedure by sending the
_RRCReconfigurationComplete_ message to the gNB via the L2 U2N Relay UE.
6\. The data path is switched from direct path to indirect path between the L2
U2N Remote UE and the gNB.
In case the selected L2 U2N Relay UE for direct to indirect path switch is in
RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, after receiving the path switch command, the L2 U2N
Remote UE establishes a PC5 link with the L2 U2N Relay UE and sends the
_RRCReconfigurationComplete_ message via the L2 U2N Relay UE, which triggers
the L2 U2N Relay UE to enter RRC_CONNECTED state. The procedure for L2 U2N
Remote UE switching to indirect path in Figure 16.12.6.2-1 can be also applied
for the case that the selected L2 U2N Relay UE for direct to indirect path
switch is in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE with the exception that the
_RRCReconfiguration_ message is sent from the gNB to the L2 U2N Relay UE after
the L2 U2N Relay UE enters RRC_CONNECTED state, which happens during step 5.
## 16.13 Support of Reduced Capability (RedCap) NR devices
### 16.13.1 Introduction
A RedCap UE has reduced capabilities with the intention to have lower
complexity with respect to non-RedCap UEs. It is mandatory for a RedCap UE to
support 20 MHz maximum UE channel bandwidth in FR1 and 100 MHz in FR2.
### 16.13.2 Capabilities
CA, MR-DC, DAPS, CPA, CPC and IAB related capabilities are not supported by
RedCap UEs, as defined together with other limitations in TS 38.306 [11]. It
is up to the network to prevent RedCap UEs from using radio capabilities not
intended for RedCap UEs.
### 16.13.3 Identification, access and camping restrictions
A RedCap UE can be identified by the network during Random Access procedure
via MSG3/MSGA from a RedCap specific LCID(s) and optionally via MSG1/MSGA
(PRACH occasion or PRACH preamble). For RedCap UE identification via
MSG1/MSGA, RedCap specific Random Access configuration may be configured by
the network. For MSG3/MSGA, a RedCap UE is identified by the dedicated LCID(s)
indicated for CCCH identification (CCCH or CCCH1) regardless whether RedCap
specific Random Access configuration is configured by the network.
RedCap UEs with 1 Rx branch and 2 Rx branches can be allowed separately via
system information. In addition, RedCap UEs in Half-Duplex FDD mode can be
allowed via system information. A RedCap specific IFRI can be provided in
SIB1, when absent, RedCap UEs access is not allowed. Information on which
frequencies RedCap UE access is allowed can be provided in system information.
A RedCap UE with 1 Rx branch applies the associated offset for broadcasted
cell specific RSRP thresholds for random access, SDT, cell edge condition and
cell (re)selection criterion as specified in TS 38.133 [13].
NOTE: It is up to the E-UTRA network, if possible, to avoid handover attempts
of a RedCap UE to a target NR cell not supporting RedCap. It is up to the
RedCap UE implementation, if possible, to recover from handover attempts to a
target NR cell not supporting RedCap.
### 16.13.4 RRM measurement relaxations
RRM measurement relaxation is enabled and disabled by the network. In RRC_IDLE
and RRC_INACTIVE a RedCap UE is allowed to relax neighbour cell RRM
measurements when the stationary criterion is met or when both stationary
criterion and not-at-cell-edge criterion are met. Network may configure
stationary criterion for a RedCap UE in RRC_CONNECTED and the UE reports its
RRM measurement relaxation fulfilment status using UE Assistance Information
when the stationarity criterion is met or no longer met.
### 16.13.5 BWP operation
A RedCap UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE monitors paging only in an initial BWP
(default or RedCap specific) associated with CD-SSB and performs cell
(re-)selection and related measurements on the CD-SSB. If a RedCap-specific
initial UL BWP is configured and NUL is selected, RedCap UEs shall use only
the RedCap-specific initial UL BWP to perform RACH procedure in RRC_IDLE and
RRC_INACTIVE or to perform CG-SDT procedure (as described in clause 18.0) in
RRC_INACTIVE.
A RedCap UE may be configured with multiple NCD-SSBs provided that each BWP is
configured with at most one SSB. NCD-SSB may be configured for a RedCap UE in
RRC_CONNECTED to perform RLM, BFD, and RRM measurements and RA resource
selection when the active BWP does not contain CD-SSB.
A RedCap UE may be configured with NCD-SSB for a RedCap-specific initial DL
BWP to perform SDT procedure in RRC_INACTIVE (as described in clause 18.0) in
case the RedCap-specific initial DL BWP does not contain CD-SSB.
## 16.14 Non-Terrestrial Networks
### 16.14.1 Overview
Figure 16.14.1-1 below illustrates an example of a Non-Terrestrial Network
(NTN) providing non-terrestrial NR access to the UE by means of an NTN payload
and an NTN Gateway, depicting a service link between the NTN payload and a UE,
and a feeder link between the NTN Gateway and the NTN payload.
Figure 16.14.1-1: Overall illustration of an NTN
NOTE 1: Figure 16.14.1-1 illustrates an NTN; RAN4 aspects are out of scope.
The NTN payload transparently forwards the radio protocol received from the UE
(via the service link) to the NTN Gateway (via the feeder link) and vice-
versa. The following connectivity is supported by the NTN payload:
\- An NTN gateway may serve multiple NTN payloads;
\- An NTN payload may be served by multiple NTN gateways.
NOTE 2: In this release, the NTN-payload may change the carrier frequency,
before re-transmitting it on the service link, and vice versa (respectively on
the feeder link).
For NTN, the following applies in addition to Network Identities as described
in clause 8.2:
\- A Tracking Area corresponds to a fixed geographical area. Any respective
mapping is configured in the RAN;
> \- A Mapped Cell ID as specified in clause 16.14.5.
Three types of service links are supported:
\- Earth-fixed: provisioned by beam(s) continuously covering the same
geographical areas all the time (e.g., the case of GSO satellites);
\- Quasi-Earth-fixed: provisioned by beam(s) covering one geographic area for
a limited period and a different geographic area during another period (e.g.,
the case of NGSO satellites generating steerable beams);
\- Earth-moving: provisioned by beam(s) whose coverage area slides over the
Earth surface (e.g., the case of NGSO satellites generating fixed or non-
steerable beams).
With NGSO satellites, the gNB can provide either quasi-Earth-fixed service
link or Earth-moving service link, while gNB operating with GSO satellite can
provide Earth fixed service link.
In this release, the UE supporting NTN is GNSS-capable.
### 16.14.2 Timing and Synchronization
#### 16.14.2.1 Scheduling and Timing
DL and UL are frame aligned at the uplink time synchronization reference point
(RP) with an offset given by N~TA,offset~ (see clause 4.2 of TS 38.213 [38]).
To accommodate the propagation delay in NTNs, several timing relationships are
enhanced by a Common Timing Advance (Common TA) and two offsets
$K_{\text{offset}}$ and $k_{\text{mac}}$:
\- $\text{Common\ TA}$ is a configured timing offset that is equal to the RTT
between the RP and the NTN payload.
\- $K_{\text{offset}}$ is a configured scheduling offset that needs to be
larger or equal to the sum of the service link RTT and the Common TA.
\- $k_{\text{mac}}\ $is a configured offset that is approximately equal to the
RTT between the RP and the gNB.
The scheduling offset $K_{\text{offset}}$ is used to allow the UE sufficient
processing time between a downlink reception and an uplink transmission, see
TS 38.213 [38].
The offset $k_{\text{mac}}$ is used to delay the application of a downlink
configuration indicated by a MAC CE command on PDSCH, see TS 38.213 [38], and
in estimation of UE-gNB RTT, see TS 38.321 [6]. It may be provided by the
network when downlink and uplink frame timing are not aligned at gNB. The
$k_{\text{mac}}$ is also used in the random access procedure, to determine the
start time of RAR window/MsgB window after a Msg1/MsgA transmission (see TS
38.213 [38]).
The Service link RTT, Feeder link RTT, RP, Common TA, $k_{\text{mac}}$ and
T~TA~ (see clause 16.14.2.2) are illustrated in Figure 16.14.2.1-1.
Figure 16.14.2.1-1: Illustration of timing relationship (for collocated gNB
and NTN Gateway)
The network may configure the HARQ operation as follows:
\- For downlink, HARQ feedback can be enabled or disabled per HARQ process (as
specified in clause 5.3.2.2 and clause 5.7 of TS 38.321 [6]). Disabling HARQ
feedback allows scheduling a HARQ process before one HARQ RTT has elapsed
since last scheduled.
\- For uplink, HARQ mode (i.e. HARQ mode A or HARQ mode B) can be configured
per HARQ process (as specified in clause 5.4.3.1 and clause 5.7 of TS 38.321
[6]). HARQ mode B allows scheduling a HARQ process before one HARQ RTT has
elapsed since last scheduled.
NOTE: For the HARQ processes configured with HARQ feedback enabled/disabled,
it is up to network implementation to ensure a proper configuration of HARQ
feedback (e.g., either all enabled or all disabled) for HARQ processes used by
an SPS configuration. For the HARQ processes configured with HARQ mode, it is
up to network implementation to ensure a proper configuration of HARQ mode
(e.g., either all HARQ mode A or all HARQ mode B) for HARQ processes used by a
CG configuration.
#### 16.14.2.2 Timing Advance and Frequency Pre-compensation
For the serving cell, the network broadcast valid ephemeris information and
Common TA parameters. The UE shall have valid GNSS position as well as
ephemeris and Common TA before connecting to an NTN cell. To achieve
synchronisation, before and during connection to an NTN cell, the UE shall
compute the RTT between UE and the RP based on the GNSS position, the
ephemeris, and the Common TA parameters (see clause 4.2 in TS 38.213 [38]),
and autonomously pre-compensate the T~TA~ for the RTT between the UE and the
RP as illustrated in Figure 16.14.2.1-1 (see clause 4.3 of TS 38.211 [52]).
The UE shall compute the frequency Doppler shift of the service link, and
autonomously pre-compensate for it in the uplink transmissions, by considering
UE position and the ephemeris. If the UE does not have a valid GNSS position
and/or valid ephemeris and Common TA, it shall not transmit until both are
regained.
In connected mode, the UE shall be able to continuously update the Timing
Advance and frequency pre-compensation.
The UE may be configured to report Timing Advance during Random Access
procedures or in connected mode. In connected mode, event-triggered reporting
of the Timing Advance is supported.
Figure 16.14.2.2-1: Void
While the pre-compensation of the instantaneous Doppler shift experienced on
the service link is to be performed by the UE, the management of Doppler shift
experienced over the feeder link and transponder frequency error is left to
the network implementation.
### 16.14.3 Mobility and State transition
#### 16.14.3.1 Mobility in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE
The same principles as described in 9.2.1 apply to mobility in RRC_IDLE for
NTN and the same principles as described in 9.2.2 apply to mobility in
RRC_INACTIVE for NTN unless hereunder specified.
The network may broadcast multiple Tracking Area Codes (TACs) per PLMN in an
NR NTN cell. A TAC change in the System Information is under network control,
i.e. it may not be exactly synchronised with real-time illumination of beams
on ground.
The UE can determine the network type (terrestrial or non-terrestrial)
implicitly by the existence of _cellBarredNTN_ in SIB1.
The NTN ephemeris is provided in SIB19. It includes serving cell\'s NTN
payload ephemeris and optionally neighbouring cell\'s NTN payload ephemeris.
#### 16.14.3.2 Mobility in RRC_CONNECTED
##### 16.14.3.2.1 Handover
The same principle as described in 9.2.3.2 applies unless hereunder specified:
During mobility between NTN and Terrestrial Network (TN), a UE is not required
to connect to both NTN and TN at the same time.
NOTE: NTN TN handover refers to mobility in both directions, i.e. from NTN to
TN (hand-in) and from TN to NTN (hand-out).
DAPS handover is not supported for NTN in this release of the specification.
UE may support mobility between gNBs operating with NTN payloads in different
orbits (e.g., GSO, NGSO at different altitudes).
##### 16.14.3.2.2 Conditional Handover
The same principle as described in 9.2.3.4 applies to NTN unless hereunder
specified.
NTN supports the following additional trigger conditions upon which UE may
execute CHO to a candidate cell, as defined in TS 38.331 [12]:
\- The RRM measurement-based event A4;
\- A time-based trigger condition;
\- A location-based trigger condition.
A time-based or a location-based trigger condition is always configured
together with one of the measurement-based trigger conditions (CHO events
A3/A4/A5) as defined in TS 38.331 [12].
It is up to UE implementation how the UE evaluates the time- or location-based
trigger condition together with the RRM measurement-based event.
#### 16.14.3.3 Measurements
The same principle as described in 9.2.4 applies to measurements in NTN unless
hereunder specified.
The network can configure:
\- multiple SMTCs in parallel per carrier and for a given set of cells
depending on UE capabilities;
\- measurement gaps based on multiple SMTCs;
\- assistance information (e.g., ephemeris, Common TA parameters,
$k_{\text{mac}}$) provided in SIB19 for UE to perform measurement on neighbour
cells in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE/RRC_CONNECTED.
NW-controlled adjustment of SMTCs can be based on UE assistance information
reported in RRC_CONNECTED. A UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE can adjust SMTCs
based on its location and assistance information in SIB19.
UE assistance information consists of the service link propagation delay
difference(s) between serving the cell and neighbour cell(s).
For a UE in Idle/Inactive mode it\'s up to UE implementation whether to
perform NTN neighbour cell measurements on a cell indicated in SIB3/SIB4 but
not included in SIB19.
For a UE in Connected mode, it\'s up to UE implementation whether to perform
NTN neighbour cell measurements on a cell included in the measurement
configuration but not included in SIB19.
In the quasi-earth fixed cell scenario, UE can perform time-based and
location-based measurements on neighbour cells in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE:
\- The timing and location information associated to the serving cell is
provided in SIB19;
\- Timing information refers to the UTC time when the serving cell stops
serving the current geographical area;
\- Location information refers to the reference location of the serving cell
and a distance threshold to the reference location.
Measurement rules for cell re-selection based on timing information and
location information are specified in clause 5.2.4.2 in TS 38.304 [10].
### 16.14.4 Switchover
#### 16.14.4.1 Definitions
A feeder link switchover is the procedure where the feeder link is changed
from a source NTN Gateway to a target NTN Gateway for a specific NTN payload.
The feeder link switchover is a Transport Network Layer procedure. Service
link switch refers to a change of the serving NTN payload.
Both hard and soft feeder link switchover are supported in NTN.
#### 16.14.4.2 Assumptions
A feeder link switch over may result in transferring the established
connection for the affected UEs between two gNBs.
For soft feeder link switch over, an NTN payload is able to connect to more
than one NTN Gateway during a given period, i.e. a temporary overlap can be
ensured during the transition between the feeder links.
For hard feeder link switch over, an NTN payload connects to only one NTN
Gateway at any given time, i.e. a radio link interruption may occur during the
transition between the feeder links.
#### 16.14.4.3 Procedures
The NTN Control function (see Annex B.4) determines the point in time when the
feeder link switch over between two gNBs is performed. The transfer of the
affected UE(s)\' context between the two gNBs at feeder link switch over is
performed by means of either NG based or Xn based handover, and it depends on
the gNBs\' implementation and configuration information provided to the gNBs
by the NTN Control function.
### 16.14.5 NG-RAN signalling
The Cell Identity, as defined in TS 38.413 [26] and TS 38.423 [50], used in
following cases corresponds to a Mapped Cell ID, irrespective of the orbit of
the NTN payload or the types of service links supported:
\- The Cell Identity indicated by the gNB to the Core Network as part of the
User Location Information;
\- The Cell Identity used for Paging Optimization in NG interface;
\- The Cell Identity used for Area of Interest;
\- The Cell Identity used for PWS.
The Cell Identity included within the target identification of the handover
messages allows identifying the correct target cell.
The Cell Identities used in the RAN Paging Area during Xn RAN paging allow the
identification of the correct target cells for RAN paging.
NOTE 1: The Cell Identity used for RAN Paging is assumed to typically
represent a Uu Cell ID.
The mapping between Mapped Cell IDs and geographical areas is configured in
the RAN and Core Network.
NOTE 2: A specific geographical location may be mapped to multiple Mapped Cell
ID(s), and such Mapped Cell IDs may be configured to indicate differerent
geographical areas (e.g. overlapping and/or with different dimensions).
The gNB is responsible for constructing the Mapped Cell ID based on the UE
location information received from the UE, if available. The mapping may be
pre-configured (e.g., up to operator\'s policy) or up to implementation.
NOTE 3: As described in TS 23.501 [3], the User Location Information may
enable the AMF to determine whether the UE is allowed to operate at its
present location. Special Mapped Cell IDs or TACs may be used to indicate
areas outside the serving PLMN\'s country.
The gNB reports the broadcasted TAC(s) of the selected PLMN to the AMF as part
of ULI. In case the gNB knows the UE\'s location information, the gNB may
determine the TAI the UE is currently located in and provide that TAI to the
AMF as part of ULI.
### 16.14.6 AMF (Re-)Selection
The gNB implements the NAS Node Selection Function specified in TS 38.410
[16].
For an RRC_CONNECTED UE, when the gNB is configured to ensure that the UE
connects to an AMF that serves the country in which the UE is located, if the
gNB detects that the UE is in a different country to that served by the
serving AMF, then it should perform an NG handover to change to an appropriate
AMF, or initiate an UE Context Release Request procedure towards the serving
AMF (in which case the AMF may decide to de-register the UE).
### 16.14.7 O&M Requirements
The following NTN related parameters shall be provided by O&M to the gNB
providing NTN access:
\- Ephemeris information describing the orbital trajectory information or
coordinates for the NTN payload. This information is provided on a regular
basis or upon demand to the gNB;
\- Two different sets of ephemeris format shall be supported:
\- Set 1: NTN payload position and velocity state vectors:
\- Position;
\- Velocity.
\- Set 2: At least the following parameters in orbital parameter ephemeris
format, as specified in NIMA TR 8350.2 [51]:
\- Semi-major axis;
\- Eccentricity;
\- Argument of periapsis;
\- Longitude of ascending node;
\- Inclination;
\- Mean anomaly at epoch time.
\- The explicit epoch time associated to ephemeris data;
\- The location of the NTN Gateways;
NOTE 1: The ephemeris of the NTN payloads and the location of the NTN
Gateways, are used at least for the Uplink timing and frequency
synchronization. It may also be used for the random access and the mobility
management purposes.
\- Additional information to enable gNB operation for feeder/service link
switch overs.
NOTE 2: The NTN related parameters provided by O&M to the gNB may depend on
the type of supported service links, i.e., Earth-fixed, quasi-Earth-fixed, or
Earth-moving.
### 16.14.8 Coarse UE location reporting
Upon network request, after AS security is established in connected mode, a UE
should report its coarse UE location information (most significant bits of the
GNSS coordinates, ensuring an accuracy in the order of 2 km) to the NG-RAN if
available.
# 17 Interference Management
## 17.1 Remote Interference Management
The atmospheric ducting phenomenon, caused by lower densities at higher
altitudes in the Earth\'s atmosphere, causes a reduced refractive index,
causing the signals to bend back towards the Earth. A signal trapped in the
atmospheric duct can reach distances far greater than normal. In TDD networks
with the same UL/DL slot configuration, and in the absence of atmospheric
ducting, a guard period is used to avoid the interference between UL and DL
transmissions in different cells. However, when the atmospheric ducting
phenomenon happens, radio signals can travel a relatively long distance, and
the propagation delay exceeds the guard period. Consequently, the DL signals
of an aggressor cell can interfere with the UL signals of a victim cell that
is far away from the aggressor. Such interference is termed as remote
interference. The further the aggressor is to the victim, the more UL symbols
of the victim will be impacted.
A remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor
cells, where the gNBs execute Remote Interference Management (RIM)
coordination on behalf of their respective cells. Aggressor and victim gNBs
can be grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is assigned a set ID,
and is configured with a RIM Reference Signal (RIM-RS) and the radio resources
associated with the set ID. Each aggressor gNB can be configured with multiple
set IDs and each victim gNB can be configured with multiple set IDs, whereas
each cell can have at most one victim set ID and one aggressor set ID.
Consequently, each gNB can be an aggressor and a victim at the same time.
To mitigate remote interference, the network enables RIM frameworks for
coordination between victim and aggressor gNBs. The coordination communication
in RIM frameworks can be wireless- or backhaul-based. The backhaul-based RIM
framework uses a combination of wireless and backhaul communication, while in
the wireless framework, the communication is purely wireless.
In both frameworks, all gNBs in a victim set simultaneously transmit an
identical RIM reference signal carrying the victim set ID over the air.
In the wireless framework, upon reception of the RIM reference signal from the
victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measures, and send back a RIM
reference signal carrying the aggressor set ID. The RIM reference signal sent
by the aggressor is able to provide information whether the atmospheric
ducting phenomenon exists. The victim gNBs realize the atmospheric ducting
phenomenon have ceased upon not receiving any reference signal sent from
aggressors.
In the RIM backhaul framework, upon reception of the RIM reference signal from
the victim set, aggressor gNBs undertake RIM measures, and establish backhaul
coordination towards the victim gNB set. The backhaul messages are sent from
individual aggressor gNBs to individual victim gNB, where the signalling is
transparent to the core network. The RIM backhaul messages from aggressor to
victim gNBs carry the indication about the detection or disappearance of RIM
reference signal. Based on the indication from the backhaul message, the
victim gNBs realize whether the atmospheric ducting and the consequent remote
interference have ceased.
In both frameworks, upon realizing that the atmospheric ducting has
disappeared, the victim gNBs stop transmitting the RIM reference signal.
## 17.2 Cross-Link Interference Management
When different TDD DL/UL patterns are used between neighbouring cells, UL
transmission in one cell may interfere with DL reception in another cell: this
is referred to as Cross Link Interference (CLI).
To mitigate CLI, gNBs can exchange and coordinate their intended TDD DL-UL
configurations over Xn and F1 interfaces; and the victim UEs can be configured
to perform CLI measurements. There are two types of CLI measurements:
\- SRS-RSRP measurement in which the UE measures SRS-RSRP over SRS resources
of aggressor UE(s);
\- CLI-RSSI measurement in which the UE measures the total received power
observed over RSSI resources.
Layer 3 filtering applies to CLI measurement results and both event triggered
and periodic reporting are supported.
# 18 Small Data Transmission
## 18.0 General
Small Data Transmission (SDT) is a procedure allowing data and/or signalling
transmission while remaining in RRC_INACTIVE state (i.e. without transitioning
to RRC_CONNECTED state). SDT is enabled on a radio bearer basis and is
initiated by the UE only if less than or equal to a configured amount of UL
data awaits transmission across all radio bearers for which SDT is enabled,
the DL RSRP is above a configured threshold, and a valid SDT resource is
available as specified in clause 5.27.1 of TS 38.321 [6]. Maximum duration the
SDT procedure can last is dictated by a SDT failure detection timer that is
configured by the network (see clause 6.2.2 of TS 38.331 [12]).
SDT procedure is initiated with either a transmission over RACH (configured
via system information) or over Type 1 CG resources (configured via dedicated
signalling in _RRCRelease_). The SDT resources can be configured on initial
BWP for both RACH and CG. RACH and CG resources for SDT can be configured on
either or both of NUL and SUL carriers. The CG resources for SDT are valid
only within the PCell of the UE when the _RRCRelease_ with suspend indication
is received. CG resources are associated with one or multiple SSB(s). For
RACH, the network can configure 2-step and/or 4-step RA resources for SDT.
When both 2-step and 4-step RA resources for SDT are configured, the UE
selects the RA type according to clause 9.2.6. CFRA is not supported for SDT
over RACH.
Once initiated, the SDT procedure is either:
\- successfully completed after the UE is directed to RRC_IDLE (via
_RRCRelease_) or to continue in RRC_INACTIVE (via _RRCRelease or RRCReject_)
or to RRC_CONNECTED (via _RRCResume or RRCSetup_); or
\- unsuccessfully completed upon cell re-selection, expiry of the SDT failure
detection timer, a MAC entity reaching a configured maximum PRACH preamble
transmission threshold, an RLC entity reaching a configured maximum
retransmission threshold, or integrity check failure while SDT procedure is
ongoing, or expiry of SDT-specific timing alignment timer or
_configuredGrantTimer_ while SDT procedure is ongoing over CG and the UE has
not received a response from the network after the initial PUSCH transmission.
Upon unsuccessful completion of the SDT procedure, the UE transitions to
RRC_IDLE.
For SDT, network should not send _RRCReject_ in response to
_RRCResumeRequest/RRCResumeRequest1_ if DL data over any radio bearer
configured for SDT is transmitted.
The initial PUSCH transmission during the SDT procedure includes at least the
CCCH message. When using CG resources for initial SDT transmission, the UE can
perform autonomous retransmission of the initial transmission if the UE does
not receive confirmation from the network (dynamic UL grant or DL assignment)
before a configured timer expires as specified in clause 5.4.1 of TS 38.321
[6]. After the initial PUSCH transmission, subsequent transmissions are
handled differently depending on the type of resource used to initiate the SDT
procedure:
\- When using CG resources, the network can schedule subsequent UL
transmissions using dynamic grants or they can take place on the following CG
resource occasions. The DL transmissions are scheduled using dynamic
assignments. The UE can initiate subsequent UL transmission only after
reception of confirmation (dynamic UL grant or DL assignment) for the initial
PUSCH transmission from the network. For subsequent UL transmission, the UE
cannot initiate re-transmission over a CG resource.
\- When using RACH resources, the network can schedule subsequent UL and DL
transmissions using dynamic UL grants and DL assignments, respectively, after
the completion of the RA procedure.
When SDT procedure is initiated, AS security is applied for all the radio
bearers enabled for SDT as specified in clause 5.3.13.3 of TS 38.331 [12].
While the SDT procedure is ongoing, if data appears in a buffer of any radio
bearer not enabled for SDT, the UE initiates a transmission of a non-SDT data
arrival indication using _UEAssistanceInformation_ message to the network and,
if available, includes the resume cause.
SDT procedure over CG resources can only be initiated with valid UL timing
alignment. The UL timing alignment is maintained by the UE based on a SDT-
specific timing alignment timer configured by the network via dedicated
signalling and, for initial CG-SDT transmission, also by DL RSRP of configured
number of highest ranked SSBs which are above a configured RSRP threshold.
Upon expiry of the SDT-specific timing alignment timer, the CG resources are
released while maintaining the CG resource configuration.
Logical channel restrictions configured by the network while in RRC_CONNECTED
state and/or in _RRCRelease_ message for radio bearers enabled for SDT, if
any, are applied by the UE during SDT procedure.
The network may configure UE to apply ROHC continuity for SDT either when the
UE initiates SDT in the PCell of the UE when the _RRCRelease_ with suspend
indication was received or when the UE initiates SDT in a cell of its RNA.
## 18.1 Support of SDT procedure over RACH
For SDT procedure over RACH, if the UE accesses a gNB other than the last
serving gNB, the UL SDT data/signalling is buffered at the receiving gNB, and
then the receiving gNB triggers the XnAP Retrieve UE Context procedure. The
receiving gNB indicates SDT to the last serving gNB and the last serving gNB
decides whether to relocate the UE context or not. Other SDT assistance
information (e.g., single packet, multiple packets) may also be provided by
the receiving gNB to help the decision of UE context relocation.
If the last serving gNB decides not to relocate the full UE context, it
transfers a partial UE context containing SDT RLC context information
necessary for the receiving gNB to handle SDT via the Partial UE Context
Transfer procedure.
Then, in case SDT is used for user data over DRBs, UL/DL tunnels are
established for DRBs configured for SDT between the receiving gNB and the last
serving gNB. The PDCP PDU of UL/DL data is transferred over the tunnels, until
the last serving gNB terminates the SDT session and directs the UE to continue
in RRC_INACTIVE by sending the _RRCRelease_ message.
Or in case SDT is used for signalling, SRB PDCP PDUs are transferred between
the receiving gNB and the last serving gNB via the XnAP RRC Transfer
procedure, until the last serving gNB terminates the SDT session and directs
the UE to continue in RRC_INACTIVE by sending the _RRCRelease_ message.
During the SDT session, in case the receiving gNB detects that no more packets
are to be transmitted, or radio link problem is detected, the receiving gNB
may also request to terminate the SDT session to the last serving gNB via the
UE Context Retrieve Confirmation procedure.
## 18.2 SDT with UE context relocation
The overall procedure for SDT procedure over RACH with UE context relocation
is illustrated in the figure 18.2-1.
Figure 18.2-1. RA-based SDT with UE context relocation
1\. The UE sends an _RRCResumeRequest_ as well as UL SDT data and/or UL SDT
signalling to the Receiving gNB.
2\. The Receiving gNB identifies the Last Serving gNB using the I-RNTI and
retrieves the UE context by means of Xn-AP Retrieve UE Context procedure. The
Receiving gNB indicates that the UE request is for an SDT and may also provide
SDT assistance information (e.g., single packet, multiple packets).
3\. The Last Serving gNB decides to relocate UE context and responds with the
RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT RESPONSE message. The UL SDT data, if any, is delivered
from the Receiving gNB to the UPF.
4-6. The Receiving gNB decides to keep UE in RRC_INACTIVE state for SDT. If
loss of DL user data buffered in the Last Serving gNB shall be prevented, the
Receiving gNB provides forwarding addresses via the Xn-U ADDRESS INDICATION
message. The Receiving gNB also initiates NGAP Path Switch Request procedure
to establish a NG UE-associated signalling connection to the AMF. After the
Path Switch Request procedure, the buffered UL NAS PDU, if any, is delivered
from the Receiving gNB to the AMF. And then, the subsequent UL/DL SDT data
and/or signalling are transferred between UE and core network via the
Receiving gNB.
NOTE 1: If the UP policy received from the Last Serving gNB is different from
that received in the PATH SWITCH REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message, the Receiving
gNB may either send the UE back to RRC_IDLE or move the UE to RRC_CONNECTED to
update the security configuration.
7\. After the SDT transmission is terminated, the Receiving gNB generates and
sends the _RRCRelease_ message including the suspend indication to the UE to
terminate the SDT procedure and continue in RRC_INACTIVE state.
NOTE 2: In case DL non-SDT data or DL non-SDT signalling arrives, or the UE
assistance information (i.e. UL non-SDT data arrival indication) is received
from the UE, the Receiving gNB may decide to directly send the UE to
RRC_CONNECTED state by sending the _RRCResume_ message.
NOTE 3: The Receiving gNB may decide to directly send the UE to RRC_CONNECTED
state by sending the _RRCResume_ message based on (e.g. large size of) DL SDT
data or DL SDT signalling.
8\. The Receiving gNB indicates to the Last Serving gNB to remove the UE
context by sending the XnAP UE CONTEXT RELEASE message. The XnAP UE CONTEXT
RELEASE message can be sent after step 6.
## 18.3 SDT without UE context relocation
The overall procedure for SDT procedure over RACH without UE context
relocation is illustrated in the figure 18.3-1.
Figure 18.3-1. RA-based SDT without UE context relocation
1/2. The steps 1/2 are as defined in steps 1/2 in Figure 18.2-1.
3\. The last serving gNB decides not to relocate the full UE context for SDT.
4\. The last serving gNB transfers a partial UE context including the SDT
related RLC context.
5\. The receiving gNB acknowledges receiving the partial UE context and
provides associated DL TNL address. The UE context is kept at the last serving
gNB and the SDT related RLC context is established at the receiving gNB. Then
UL/DL GTP-U tunnels are established for DRBs configured for SDT, if any, and
the UL SDT data and/or signalling, if any, are forwarded to the last serving
gNB, and then delivered to the core network.
NOTE 1: The DL signalling from the last serving gNB, if any, is forwarded to
the receiving gNB via the RRC TRANSFER message, for which the receiving gNB
delivers it to the UE.
NOTE 1a: In case DL non-SDT data or DL non-SDT signalling arrives, or UE
assistance information (i.e. UL non-SDT data arrival indication) is received
from the UE, the last serving gNB terminates the SDT procedure and directs the
UE to continue in RRC_INACTIVE state by sending the _RRCRelease_ message.
NOTE 1b: The last serving gNB may terminate the SDT procedure and direct the
UE to continue in RRC_INACTIVE state by sending the _RRCRelease_ message based
on (e.g. large size of) DL SDT data or DL SDT signalling.
6\. The receiving gNB detects the end of SDT session and sends the RETRIEVE UE
CONTEXT CONFIRM message including whether this is a \"normal\" end of SDT
transaction or a radio link problem.
7\. Upon receiving the RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT CONFIRM message and deciding to
terminate the SDT, the last serving gNB responds to the receiving gNB with the
RETRIEVE UE CONTEXT FAILURE message including an encapsulated _RRCRelease_
message. The receiving gNB shall release the established partial UE context.
NOTE 2: Void.
NOTE 3: Void.
8\. The receiving gNB sends the _RRCRelease_ message to the UE.
NOTE 4: Void.
9\. The UE moves to RRC_INACTIVE state if the suspend indication is included
in the _RRCRelease_ message. Or else, the UE moves to RRC_IDLE state.
# 19 Support for NR coverage enhancements
To improve NR uplink coverage for both FR1 and FR2, the following enhancements
on PUSCH, PUCCH and MSG3 PUSCH are supported:
\- Enhanced aggregation of multiple slots with TB repetition is supported for
both PUSCH transmission with dynamic and configured grant. In addition,
counting based on available slots is supported. The maximum number of
aggregated slots for counting based on available slots and counting based on
physical slots are both 32.
\- TB processing over multiple slots with and without repetition is supported
for both PUSCH transmission with dynamic grant and configured grant. For a
single transmission of TB processing over multiple slots PUSCH, the TB size is
determined based on multiple slots.
\- DMRS bundling where the UE maintains phase continuity and power consistency
across PUSCH transmissions or PUCCH repetitions to enable improved channel
estimation is supported. Inter-slot frequency hopping with DMRS bundling is
supported.
\- Dynamic PUCCH repetition factor indication configured per PUCCH resource is
introduced, applicable to all PUCCH formats.
\- Aggregation of multiple slots with TB repetition for MSG3 transmission is
supported on both NUL and SUL, applicable to CBRA with 4-step RA type. If
configured, the UE requests MSG3 repetition via separate RACH resources when
the RSRP of DL path-loss reference is lower than a configured threshold. BWP
configured with RACH resources solely for MSG3 repetition is also supported
without the need to consider the RSRP of DL path-loss reference by the UE.
# 20 Support for Multi-USIM devices
## 20.1 General
NG-RAN may support one or more of the following enhancements for MUSIM device
operation:
\- Paging Collision Avoidance, as described in clause 20.2;
\- UE notification on Network Switching, as described in clause 20.3;
## 20.2 Paging Collision Avoidance
The purpose of paging collision avoidance is to address the overlap of paging
occasions on both USIMs when a MUSIM device (e.g. dual USIM device) is in
RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE state in both the networks (e.g. Network A and Network
B) associated with respective **USIMs. Network A is NR and Network B is E-UTRA
or NR.**
A MUSIM device may determine potential paging collision on two networks and
may trigger actions to prevent potential paging collision on NR network as
specified in TS 23.501 [3].
NOTE: It is left to UE implementation as to how it selects one of the two
RATs/networks for paging collision avoidance.
## 20.3 UE notification on Network Switching
**For MUSIM operation, a MUSIM** device in RRC_CONNECTED state in Network A
may have to switch from Network A to Network B. **Network A is NR and Network
B can either be E-UTRA or NR. Before switching from Network A,** a MUSIM
device should notify Network A **to either leave RRC_CONNECTED state, or be
kept in RRC_CONNECTED state in Network A** while temporarily switching to
Network B**.**
When configured to do so, a MUSIM device can signal to the Network A a
preference to leave RRC_CONNECTED state by using RRC (see TS 38.331 [12]) or
NAS signalling (see TS 23.501 [3]). After sending a preference to leave
RRC_CONNECTED state by using RRC signalling, if the MUSIM device does not
receive an _RRCRelease_ message from the Network A within a certain time
period (configured by the Network A, see TS 38.331 [12]), the MUSIM device can
enter RRC_IDLE state in Network A.
When configured to do so, a MUSIM device can signal to the Network A a
preference to be temporarily switching to Network B while remaining in
RRC_CONNECTED state in Network. This is indicated by scheduling gaps
preference.This preference can include information for setup or release of
gap(s). The Network A can configure at most 4 gap patterns for MUSIM purpose:
three periodic gaps and a single aperiodic gap. The Network A should always
provide at least one of the requested gap pattern or no gaps. Network
providing an alternative gap pattern instead of the one requested by the UE is
not supported in this release.
# 21 Application Layer Measurement Collection
## 21.1 Overview
The QoE Measurement Collection function enables collection of application
layer measurements from the UE. The supported service types are:
\- QoE Measurement Collection for DASH streaming services;
\- QoE Measurement Collection for MTSI services;
\- QoE Measurement Collection for VR services.
The QoE measurement collection is supported in RRC_CONNECTED state only. Both
signalling based and management based QoE measurement collection are
supported.
NOTE: The naming QoE Measurement is used in NG, Xn, and interfaces between the
OAM and the gNB. In the Uu interface, the naming application layer measurement
is used and it is equal to QoE Measurement.
## 21.2 QoE Measurement Configuration
### 21.2.1 QoE Measurement Collection Activation and Reporting
The feature is activated in the gNB either by direct configuration from the
OAM system (management-based activation), or by signalling from the OAM via
the 5GC (signalling-based activation), containing UE-associated QoE
configuration. One or more QoE measurement collection jobs can be activated at
a UE per service type, and each QoE measurement configuration is uniquely
identified by a QoE reference. When the UE is configured with MR-DC, only the
MN can configure the QoE configuration.
For signalling-based QoE measurements, the OAM initiates the QoE measurement
activation for a specific UE via the 5GC, and the gNB receives one or more QoE
measurement configurations by means of UE-associated signalling. The QoE
measurement configuration for signalling-based activation includes an
application layer measurement configuration list and the corresponding
information for QoE measurement collection, e.g., QoE reference, service type,
MCE IP address, slice scope, area scope, MDT alignment information and the
indication of available RAN visible QoE metrics.
For management-based QoE measurement activation, the OAM sends one or more QoE
measurement configurations directly to the gNB. The QoE measurement
configuration for management-based activation also includes an application
layer measurement configuration list and the corresponding information for QoE
measurement collection. The gNB selects UE(s) that meet the required QoE
measurement capability, area scope and slice scope.
Application layer measurement configuration received by the gNB from OAM or CN
is encapsulated in a transparent container, which is forwarded to a UE as
Application layer configuration in the _RRCReconfiguration_ message (there can
be multiple configurations in the same message). Application layer measurement
reports received from UE\'s application layer are encapsulated in a
transparent container and sent to the network in the
_MeasurementReportAppLayer_ message, as specified in TS 38.331 [12]. The UE
can send multiple application layer measurement reports to the gNB in one
_MeasurementReportAppLayer_ message. In order to allow the transmission of
application layer measurement reports which exceed the maximum PDCP SDU size,
segmentation of the _MeasurementReportAppLayer_ message may be enabled by the
gNB. An RRC identifier conveyed in the RRC signalling is used to identify the
application layer measurement configuration and report between the gNB and the
UE. The RRC identifier is mapped to the QoE reference in the gNB, and the gNB
forwards the application layer measurement report to MCE together with the QoE
reference. The gNB can release one or multiple application layer measurement
configurations from the UE in one _RRCReconfiguration_ message at any time.
The UE may additionally be configured by the gNB to report when a QoE
measurement session starts or stops for a certain application layer
measurement configuration.
### 21.2.2 QoE Measurement Collection Deactivation
The QoE Measurement Collection deactivation permanently stops all or some of
the QoE measurement collection jobs towards a UE, resulting in the release of
the corresponding QoE measurement configuration(s) in the UE. The deactivation
of QoE measurement collection is supported by using UE-associated signalling.
A list of QoE references is used to deactivate the corresponding QoE
measurement collection job(s).
Upon reception of the QoE release message in an application layer measurement
configuration, the UE discards any unsent application layer measurement
reports corresponding to the released application layer configuration. The UE
discards the reports received from application layer when it has no associated
application layer measurement configuration configured.
The network can replace a QoE measurement configuration with another one by
deactivating an existing QoE measurement configuration and activating another
QoE measurement configuration of the same QoE measurement configuration type.
### 21.2.3 Handling of QMC during RAN Overload
The QoE measurement collection pause/resume procedure is used to pause/resume
reporting of one or multiple QoE measurement configurations in a UE in RAN
overload situation.
The gNB can use the _RRCReconfiguration_ message to temporarily stop the UE
from sending application layer measurement reports associated with one or
multiple application layer measurement configurations. When the UE receives
the QoE measurement collection pause indication, the UE temporarily stores
application layer measurement reports in AS layer. When the UE receives the
QoE measurement collection resume indication, the UE sends the stored
application layer measurement reports to the gNB.
### 21.2.4 QoE Measurement Handling in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE States
If the UE enters RRC_INACTIVE, the UE AS configuration for the QoE is stored
in the UE Inactive AS context.
If the UE enters RRC_IDLE state, the UE releases all application layer
measurement configurations.
### 21.2.5 Per-slice QoE Measurement
When a service is provided within a configured slice, the QoE Measurement for
this service type can also be configured together with the corresponding slice
scope, so that the user experience of this service can also be evaluated on a
per-slice basis. Multiple QoE measurement configurations can be configured for
the same service type, and each configuration can pertain to different slices,
where each QoE measurement configuration is identified with a QoE reference.
The UE includes the network slice identifier inside the QoE report container
when reporting QoE measurement reports.
## 21.3 QoE Measurement Continuity for Mobility
QoE measurement collection continuity for intra-system intra-RAT mobility is
supported, with the Area Scope parameters configured by the OAM, where the
network is responsible for keeping track of whether the UE is inside or
outside the area scope. A UE continues an ongoing QoE measurement even if it
leaves the area scope, unless the network indicates to the UE to release the
application layer measurement configuration.
For the RRC_CONNECTED state mobility, the source gNB may transmit the
information related to one or more application layer measurement
configurations of the UE to the target gNB via XnAP or NGAP. For signalling-
based QoE, the service type indication, QoE reference, and, optionally, the
MCE IP address, measurement configuration application layer ID, MDT alignment
information, area scope, slice support list for QMC, available RAN visible QoE
metrics and measurement status are passed to the target gNB. For management-
based QoE, the service type indication, measurement configuration application
layer ID, the MCE IP address and QoE measurement status are passed to the
target gNB. For RRC_INACTIVE state mobility, QoE measurement configuration(s)
of a specific UE can be retrieved from the gNB hosting the UE context when it
resumes to the RRC_CONNECTED state.
For signalling-based QoE, at handover to a target gNB that supports QoE
measurement collection, the target gNB decides which of the application layer
measurement configurations should be kept or released, e.g., based on
application layer measurement configuration information received from the
source gNB in Xn/NG signalling.
When the UE resumes the connection with a gNB that does not support QoE, the
UE releases all application layer measurement configurations.
## 21.4 RAN Visible QoE Measurements
RAN visible QoE measurements are configured at the UE by the gNB, where a
subset of configured QoE metrics is reported from the UE to the gNB as an
explicit IE readable by the gNB. The RAN visible QoE measurements can be used
by the gNB for network optimization. The RAN visible QoE measurements are
supported for the DASH streaming and VR services. The gNB configures the RAN
visible QoE measurement of all or some of the available RAN visible QoE
metrics, where the indication of metric availability is received by the gNB as
part of management-based or the signalling-based QoE configuration. The set of
available RAN visible QoE metrics is a subset of the metrics configured as
part of QoE measurement configuration encapsulated in the application layer
container. RAN visible QoE measurements and encapsulated QoE measurements can
be configured together or separately. RAN visible QoE measurements can only be
configured if there is a corresponding QoE measurement configuration for the
same service type configured at the UE. The gNB may modify a RAN visible QoE
configuration by releasing it and configuring the UE with a new RAN visible
QoE configuration pertaining to the same QoE reference. In this case, the new
RAN visible QoE configuration applies immediately, i.e., during the same
application session.
Multiple simultaneous RAN visible QoE measurement configurations and reports
can be supported for RAN visible QoE measurements, and each RAN visible QoE
measurement configuration and report is identified by the same measurement
configuration application layer ID as the corresponding QoE measurement
configuration and measurement report. After receiving the RAN visible QoE
measurement configuration, the UE RRC layer forwards the configuration to the
application layer, indicating the service type, the measurement configuration
application layer ID and, optionally, the reporting periodicity for RAN
visible QoE. The application layer sends the RAN visible QoE measurement
report associated with the measurement configuration application layer ID to
the UE\'s AS layer. The PDU session ID(s) corresponding to the service that is
subject to QoE measurements can also be reported by the UE along with the RAN
visible QoE measurement results.
If there is no reporting periodicity defined in the RAN visible QoE
configuration, the UE sends both RAN visible QoE measurement reports and the
QoE measurement reports to the gNB in the same _MeasurementReportAppLayer_
message, except when QoE measurement collection pause indication is received
(e.g., in case of RAN overload). When a QoE measurement collection is paused,
if there is no reporting periodicity defined in the RAN visible QoE
configuration, the encapsulated QoE reports are stored at the UE\'s RRC layer,
but the RAN visible QoE reports continue to be reported to the gNB with the
reporting periodicity configured for encapsulated QoE reporting. The RAN
visible QoE measurements can be reported with a reporting periodicity
different from the one of the corresponding encapsulated QoE measurements,
when a dedicated RAN visible QoE reporting periodicity is configured by the
gNB. The UE Application layer can measure the RAN visible QoE metrics based on
this reporting periodicity.
The gNB can release one or multiple RAN visible QoE measurement configurations
from the UE in one _RRCReconfiguration_ message at any time. If the
encapsulated QoE configuration is released, the corresponding RAN visible QoE
configuration shall be released as well.
The RAN visible QoE configuration can be transferred from the source gNB to
the target gNB upon mobility and from the old gNB to the new gNB during
context retrieval. The target gNB or the new gNB can generate a new RAN
visible QoE configuration based on the available RAN visible QoE metrics
received and can send the new RAN visible QoE configuration to the UE during
handover or the RRC resume procedure.
## 21.5 Alignment of MDT and QoE Measurements
The radio-related measurements may be collected via immediate MDT for all
types of supported services for the purpose of QoE analysis. The MCE/TCE
performs the correlation of the immediate MDT measurement results and the QoE
measurement results collected at the same UE.
The following is supported:
\- Alignment between a signalling-based QoE measurement and a signalling-based
MDT measurement. In this case, the signalling-based QoE configuration sent to
the gNB includes the NG-RAN Trace ID of the signalling-based MDT measurement.
\- Alignment between a management-based QoE measurement and a management-based
MDT measurement.
The UE configured with QoE measurements sends an indication to inform the gNB
about the start or the stop of a QoE measurement session of configured QoE
measurements. The gNB can activate the MDT measurements that are to be aligned
with the QoE measurements performed by the UE upon/after receiving the QoE
measurement session start indication from the UE. The gNB may activate the MDT
measurements upon/after receiving the MDT activation message from the OAM. The
gNB can deactivate the aligned MDT measurements according to an OAM command
which may, e.g., be triggered by the session stop indication.
The gNB includes time stamp information to the QoE measurement reports to
enable the correlation of corresponding measurement results of MDT and QoE at
the MCE/TCE. In addition, the gNB includes the MDT session identifiers (Trace
Reference and Trace Recording Session Reference) in the corresponding QoE
measurement report.
###### ## Annex A (informative): QoS Handling in RAN
# A.1 PDU Session Establishment
The following figure shows an example message flow for a PDU session
establishment. NAS procedures details between gNB and 5GC can be found in TS
23.501 [3], TS 23.502 [22] and TS 38.413 [26].
Figure A.1-1: PDU session establishment
1\. UE requests a PDU session establishment to AMF.
2\. AMF sends a PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message to gNB, which
includes the NAS message to be sent to the UE with NAS QoS related
information.
3\. gNB sends an _RRCReconfiguration_ message to UE including the
configuration of at least one DRB and the NAS message received at Step 2.
4\. UE establishes the DRB(s) for the new PDU session and creates the QFI to
DRB mapping rules.
5\. UE sends an _RRCReconfiguration_ _Complete_ message to gNB.
6\. gNB sends a PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message to AMF.
7\. User Plane Data can then be exchanged between UE and gNB over DRB(s)
according to the mapping rules and between UPF and gNB over the tunnel for the
PDU session. QFI marking over Uu is optional (see clause 12) while QFI marking
over NG-U is always present.
# A.2 New QoS Flow with RQoS
The following figure shows an example message flow when RQoS is used for a new
QoS flow. In this example, the gNB receives from UPF a first downlink packet
associated with a QFI for which the QoS parameters are known from the PDU
session establishment, but for which there is no association to any DRB yet in
AS.
Figure A.2-1: DL data with new QFI sent over existing DRB
0\. PDU session and DRB(s) have been already established.
1\. gNB receives a downlink packet with a new QFI from UPF.
2\. gNB decides to send the new QoS flow over an existing DRB.
NOTE: If gNB decides to send it over a new DRB, it needs to establish the DRB
first.
3\. gNB sends the DL packet over the selected DRB with the new QFI and RDI set
in the SDAP header.
4\. UE identifies the QFI and RDI in the received DL packet and the DRB on
which the packet was received. The AS mapping rules are then updated
accordingly.
5\. User Plane Data for the new QoS flow can then be exchanged between UE and
gNB over the DRB according to the updated mapping rules and between UPF and
gNB over the tunnel for the PDU session.
# A.3 New QoS Flow with Explicit RRC Signalling
The following figure shows an example message flow when explicit RRC
signalling is used for a new QoS flow. In this example, the gNB receives from
UPF a first downlink packet associated with a QFI, for which the QoS
parameters are already known from the PDU session establishment, but for which
there is no association to any DRB yet in AS.

gNB over the tunnel for the PDU session.
# A.4 New QoS Flow with Explicit NAS Signalling
The following figure shows an example message flow when the gNB receives a new
QoS flow establishment request from CN that involves NAS explicit signalling.
The QoS flow establishment request provides the gNB and UE with the QoS
parameters for the QFI. In this example, the gNB decides to establish a new
DRB (rather than re-use an existing one) for this QoS flow and provides the
mapping rule over RRC signalling. NAS procedures details between gNB and 5GC
can be found in TS 23.501 [3], TS 23.502 [22] and TS 38.413 [26].

establish a new DRB.
3\. gNB sends an _RRCReconfiguration_ message to UE including the DRB
configuration with the new QFI to DRB mapping rule and the NAS message
received at step 1.
4\. UE establishes the DRB for the new QoS flow associated with this PDU
session and updates the mapping rules.

according to the mapping rules and between UPF and gNB over the tunnel for the
PDU session.
# A.5 Release of QoS Flow with Explicit Signalling
The following figure shows an example message flow when the gNB receives a
request to release a QoS flow from CN that involves explicit NAS signalling.
NAS procedures details between gNB and 5GC can be found in TS 23.501 [3], TS
23.502 [22] and TS 38.413 [26].
Figure A.5-1: Release of QoS Flow with Explicit Signalling
0\. PDU session and DRB(s) have been already established.
1\. gNB receives a PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message from AMF to
release a QoS flow.
2\. The gNB decides to release corresponding the QFI to DRB mapping rule.
Since the DRB also carries other QoS flows, the DRB is not released.
3\. gNB sends an _RRCReconfiguration_ message to UE to release the QFI to DRB
mapping rule.
4\. UE updates the AS QFI to DRB mapping rules to release this QFI to DRB
mapping rule.
5\. UE sends an _RRCReconfigurationC_ omplete message to gNB.

The following figure shows an example message flow when the UE AS receives an
UL packet for a new QoS flow for which a QFI to DRB mapping rule does not
exist.
Figure A.6-1: UL packet with a new QoS flow for which a mapping does not exist
in UE
0\. PDU session and DRBs (including a default DRB) have been already
established.
1\. UE AS receives a packet with a new QFI from UE NAS.
2\. UE uses the QFI of the packet to map it to a DRB. If there is no mapping
of the QFI to a DRB in the AS mapping rules for this PDU session, then the
packet is assigned to the default DRB.
3\. UE sends the UL packet on the default DRB. The UE includes the QFI in the
SDAP header.
4\. gNB sends UL packets to UPF and includes the corresponding QFI.
5\. If gNB wants to use a new DRB for this QoS flow, it sets up one. It can
also choose to move the QoS flow to an existing DRB using RQoS or RRC
signalling (see clauses A.2 and A.3).
6\. User Plane Data for the new QoS flow can then be exchanged between UE and
gNB over the DRB according to the updated mapping rules and between UPF and
gNB over the tunnel for the PDU session.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Deployment Scenarios
# B.1 Supplementary Uplink
To improve UL coverage for high frequency scenarios, SUL can be configured
(see TS 38.101-1 [18]). With SUL, the UE is configured with 2 ULs for one DL
of the same cell as depicted on Figure B.1-1 below:
Figure B.1-1: Example of Supplementary Uplink
# B.2 Multiple SSBs in a carrier
For a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, the BWPs configured by a serving cell may overlap
in the frequency domain with the BWPs configured for other UEs by other cells
within a carrier. Multiple SSBs may also be transmitted within the frequency
span of a carrier used by the serving cell. However, from the UE perspective,
each serving cell is associated to at most a single SSB. Figure B.2-1 below
describes a scenario with multiple SSBs in a carrier, identifying two
different cells (NCGI = 5, associated to SSB1, and NCGI = 6, associated to
SSB3) with overlapping BWPs, and where RRM measurements can be configured to
be performed by the UE on each of the available SSBs, i.e. SSB1, SSB2, SSB3
and SSB4.

# B.3 NR Operation with Shared Spectrum
NR Radio Access operating with shared spectrum channel access can support the
following deployment scenarios:
\- Scenario A: Carrier aggregation between NR in licensed spectrum (SpCell)
and NR in shared spectrum (SCell);
\- Scenario A.1: SCell is not configured with uplink (DL only);
\- Scenario A.2: SCell is configured with uplink (DL+UL).
\- Scenario B: Dual connectivity between LTE in licensed spectrum and NR in
shared spectrum (PSCell);
\- Scenario C: NR in shared spectrum (PCell);
\- Scenario D: NR cell in shared spectrum and uplink in licensed spectrum;
\- Scenario E: Dual connectivity between NR in licensed spectrum (PCell) and
NR in shared spectrum (PSCell).
Carrier aggregation of cells in shared spectrum is applicable to all
deployment scenarios.
# B.4 Example implementation of Non-Terrestrial Networks
The following figure illustrates an example implementation of an Non-
Terrestrial Network for transparent NTN payload:
Figure B.4-1: NTN based NG-RAN
The gNB depicted in Figure B.4-1 may be subdivided into non-NTN infrastructure
gNB functions and the NTN Service Link provisioning system. The NTN
infrastructure may be thought of being subdivided into the NTN Service Link
provisioning system and the NTN Control function. The NTN Service Link
provisioning system may consist of one or more NTN payloads and NTN Gateways.
The NTN payload is embarked on a spaceborne (or airborne) vehicle, providing a
structure, power, commanding, telemetry, attitude control for the satellite
(resp. HAPS) and possibly an appropriate thermal environment, radiation
shielding.
The NTN Service Link provisioning system maps the NR-Uu radio protocol over
radio resources of the NTN infrastructure (e.g. beams, channels, Tx power).
The NTN control function controls the spaceborne (or airborne) vehicles as
well as the radio resources of the NTN infrastructure (NTN payload(s) & NTN
Gateway(s)). It provides control data, e.g. Ephemeris, to the non-NTN
infrastructure gNB functions of the gNB.
Provision of NTN control data to the gNB is out of 3GPP scope.
NOTE: The transport of NR-Uu protocol between the NTN Service Link
provisioning system and the non-NTN infrastructure gNB functions is out of
3GPP scope.
At least the following NTN related parameters are expected to be provided by
O&M to the gNB for its operation:
a) Earth-fixed beams: for each beam provided by a given NTN-payload:
\- The Cell identifier (NG and Uu) mapped to the beam;
\- The Cell\'s reference location (e.g. cell\'s center and range).
b) Quasi-Earth-fixed: for each beam provided by a given NTN payload:
> \- The Cell identifier (NG and Uu) and time window mapped to a beam;
>
> \- The Cell\'s/beam\'s reference location (e.g. cell\'s center and range);
\- The time window of the successive switch overs (feeder link, service link);
\- The identifier and time window of all serving satellites (resp. HAPS) and
NTN Gateways.
c) Earth moving beams: for each beam provided by a given NTN payload:
> \- The Uu Cell identifier mapped to a beam and mapping information to fixed
> geographical areas reported on NG, including information about the beams
> direction and motion of the beam\'s foot print on Earth;
\- Its elevation wrt NTN payload;
\- Schedule of successive serving NTN Gateways/gNBs;
> \- Schedule of successive switch overs (feeder link, service link).
###### ## Annex C (informative): I-RNTI Reference Profiles
The I-RNTI provides the new NG-RAN node a reference to the UE context in the
old NG-RAN node. How the new NG-RAN node is able to resolve the old NG-RAN ID
from the I-RNTI is a matter of proper configuration in the old and new NG-RAN
node.
Table C-1 below provides some typical partitioning of a 40bit I-RNTI, assuming
the following content:
\- **UE specific reference** : reference to the UE context within a logical
NG-RAN node;
\- **NG-RAN node address index** : information to identify the NG-RAN node
that has allocated the UE specific part;
NOTE: **RAT-specific information** may be introduced in a later release,
containing information to identify the RAT of the cell within which the UE was
sent to RRC_INACTIVE. This version of the specification only supports intra-
RAT mobility of UEs in RRC_INACTIVE.
\- **PLMN-specific information** : information supporting network sharing
deployments, providing an index to the PLMN ID part of the Global NG-RAN node
identifier.

###### ## Annex D (informative): SPID ranges and mapping of SPID values to
cell reselection and inter-RAT/inter frequency handover priorities
The SPID values are defined in Annex I of TS 36.300 [2].
From the SPID reference values, only the SPID=253 also applies for 5GC.
###### ## Annex E (informative): NG-RAN Architecture for Radio Access Network
Sharing with multiple cell ID broadcast
Each NG-RAN node serving a cell identified by a Cell Identity associated with
either a subset of PLMNs, or a subset of SNPNs, or a subset of PNI-NPNs is
connected to another NG-RAN node via a single Xn-C interface instance.
Each Xn-C interface instance is setup and removed individually.
Xn-C interface instances terminating at NG-RAN nodes which share the same
physical radio resources may share the same signalling transport resources. If
this option is applied:
\- Non-UE associated signalling is associated to an Xn-C interface instance by
including an Interface Instance Indication in the XnAP message;
\- Node related, non-UE associated Xn-C interface signalling may provide
information destined for multiple logical nodes in a single XnAP procedure
instance once the Xn-C interface instance is setup;
NOTE 1: If the Interface Instance Indication corresponds to more than one
interface instance, the respective XnAP message carries information destined
for multiple logical nodes.
\- A UE associated signalling connection is associated to an Xn-C interface
instance by allocating values for the corresponding NG-RAN node UE XnAP IDs so
that they can be mapped to that Xn-C interface instance.
NOTE 2: One possible implementation is to partition the value ranges of the
NG-RAN node UE XnAP IDs and associate each value range with an Xn-C interface
instance.
###### ## Annex F (normative): Use and structure of the I-RNTI
The I-RNTI provides an NG-RAN node with a reference to the UE context and a
reference to the NG-RAN node that allocated the UE context.
To support an NG-RAN node in resolving the Local NG-RAN ID of the NG-RAN node
that allocated the UE context, the I-RNTI structure is as follows:
\- the first part (starting from the MSB of the I-RNTI) identifies the I-RNTI
profile. It is 2 bits long for a Full I-RNTI or 1 bit long for a short I-RNTI,
and it indicates the length of a Local NG-RAN Node Identifier of the NG-RAN
Node that allocated the I-RNTI;
\- the second part, immediately following the first part, is a Local NG-RAN
Node Identifier;
\- the third part, immediately following the second part, identifies the UE
context stored in the NG-RAN node that allocated the I-RNTI.
In case a NG-RAN node takes an additional Local NG-RAN Node identifier into
use or removes a Local NG-RAN Node identifier currently in use it informs its
neighbor NG-RAN nodes about this change.
The I-RNTI profiles for Full I-RNTI are described in table F-1.
