# 4 Background
One of the aims of 5G is providing bandwidth flexibility. Although this is
achieved in general, but for some spectrum allocations the ability to achieve
such flexibility needs further study.
Solutions for the following spectrum allocations have been requested so far:
Table 4-1: Summary of operators' input for irregular channel bandwidth
Band (s) Channel Bandwidth(s)
* * *
n5 7, 11 MHz n12, n85 6, 12 MHz n26 7 MHz n28 13 MHz n29 6, 11 MHz
Some techniques have been suggested for re-using existing channel bandwidths
which can include but not limited to overlapping UE channel bandwidths, and/or
using larger bandwidths than operator licensed bandwidth. This Study Item is
needed to evaluate where existing techniques can be used to efficiently
utilize operator spectrum allocations, and whether and how new channel
bandwidths should be created. The Study shall also analyse if a proprietary
solution(s) is sufficient.
## 4.1 Objectives
The following objectives are listed in the SID [2]
1) Identify operator licensed channel bandwidths in FR1 that do not align with
existing NR channel bandwidths.
\- Only licensed spectrum wider than 5 MHz to be considered in this SID.
\- Spectrum block of 33MHz in n28 require further investigation since there is
dual duplexer assumption (2x30MHz) for this band.
2) Evaluate the potential use of larger channel bandwidths than operator
licensed bandwidth, including the impacts on regulatory emission
requirements/UE output power implications and UE ACS/blocking impacts
depending on the guard band and the SCS.
3) Study the use of overlapping UE channel bandwidths (from both UE and
network perspective) to cover operator's license spectrum for both UL and DL,
and if new gNB channel bandwidths are needed.
NOTE: For all considered solutions, new (dedicated) channel filters (e.g. non-
integer-multiples of 5MHz) are not considered for the UE and not prioritized
for the gNB.
4) Identify operator licensed bandwidths that are not compatible with the use
of techniques like overlapping UE channel bandwidths. Every proposed method
shall be summarized with respect to whether all considered spectrum scenarios
are supported or whether there are specific limitations. Some limitations for
a specific method shall not disqualify such method if there is a trade-off
between flexibility and implementation challenges.
5) Study the complexity and efficiency of adding new channel bandwidths vs.
using other including testing aspects.
6) Generic solution(s) should be intended as much as possible, with priority
should be given to approaches that avoid the introduction of new channel BWs
on the UE side. Proprietary solutions if proven relevant should not be
precluded. Spectrally efficient methods providing a fine channel bandwidth
granularity as well as low to moderate guard band width and signalling
overhead should be preferred
7) Impact on RAN1 and RAN2 should be considered and minimized
8) For any considered solution, UEs not supporting such solution (both legacy
and new UEs) should be able to use the next lower supported channel bandwidth
in the UL and DL without implications.
9) Impact (if any) on RAN4 requirements should be identified for the preferred
solutions.
# 5 General
## 5.1 UE channel bandwidth
The following text is copied from TS38.101-1 for information:
The UE channel bandwidth supports a single NR RF carrier in the uplink or
downlink at the UE. From a BS perspective, different UE channel bandwidths may
be supported within the same spectrum for transmitting to and receiving from
UEs connected to the BS. Transmission of multiple carriers to the same UE (CA)
or multiple carriers to different UEs within the BS channel bandwidth can be
supported.
From a UE perspective, the UE is configured with one or more BWP / carriers,
each with its own UE channel bandwidth. The UE does not need to be aware of
the BS channel bandwidth or how the BS allocates bandwidth to different UEs.
The placement of the UE channel bandwidth for each UE carrier is flexible but
can only be completely within the BS channel bandwidth.
# 6 Result, Analysis outcome
## 6.1 Study of larger Channel BW than licensed BW
### 6.1.1 General Aspects
This clause describes, in general terms, how to utilize an irregular Channel
Bandwidth by deploying the "larger channel Bandwidth" method.
The premise idea is that the system is configured with the larger channel
bandwidth, as indicated in the broadcast System Information, , but the actual
number of scheduled RBs is restricted so that it matches actual spectrum
allocation ensuring sufficiently large guard bands.
{width="1.4305555555555556in" height="0.7777777777777778in"}
**Figure 6.1.1-1: Using the next larger channel bandwidth (example for
7MHz).**
NOTE: It should be checked further whether it is possible to configure the
next larger channel so that it goes over the band edge and which implications
it has.
One of the first aspects for this approach is the size of guard bands and the
anticipated number of schedulable RBs. For the standard channel bandwidths,
both values are captured in the corresponding specification to avoid any
misinterpretation on how many RBs can be configured and scheduled. Following
the same principle for every irregular channel bandwidth would be feasible,
but would create the same amount of technical specification work as if the
corresponding irregular channel bandwidth were explicitly added to the
specifications. Thus, the number of \"available\" RBs can be calculated based
on certain assumptions.
The maximum number of \"available\" or \"schedulable\" RBs for a particular
irregular channel bandwidth can be calculated based on the assumption of using
larger guard bands from the next _larger_ channel bandwidth. As an example,
while considering the 7MHz channel bandwidth, the assumption is to consider
next larger 10MHz channel guard bands at both ends, from which number of
available RBs can be calculated.
NOTE: Since a UE will be configured with the channel bandwidth, which is
larger than the actual allocation, and it is not expected to provide the usual
stop-band attenuation at the edges of the irregular channel bandwidth, it is
necessary to verify the level of potential degradation of ACS/blocking. Sub-
clause 6.1.3 provides further information on UE filters and potential
performance.
NOTE: Similarly, the gNB operating with wider channel filters cannot be
expected to provide stop-band attenuation at the edges of the irregular
channel bandwidth to guarantee the co-existence. Further information on gNB
transmit channel filters and ACS/blocking should be provided to assess
resulting performance degradation and the gap to the RF performance
requirements. The gNB Tx transmitter filter assumption is FFS.
Table 6.1.1-1 below presents example maximum number of available RBs for
different irregular channel bandwidths considered in this study item.
NOTE: Number of available RBs and spectral utilisation are taken from
R4-2112365. The gNB transmitter filter assumption used to derive the RB
numbers is FFS.

bands (15kHz SCS).

Table 6.1.1-2 below presents similar calculations for 30kHz SCS, from which
one can see that combination of 30kHz SCS and the next larger channel is not
generally a good approach for small channel bandwidths. The main reason is
that 30kHz SCS has much larger guard bands, which immediately impacts number
of available RBs. As a small summary, assuming using guard band from the next
larger channel the resulting spectrum Utilization would range from 87 to 92.8%
for an SCS of 15kHz and 72 to 88.6% for an SCS of 30kHz.
NOTE: Number of available RBs and spectral utilisation are taken from
R4-2112365. The gNB transmitter filter assumption used to derive the RB
numbers is FFS.

### 6.1.2 Signalling and configuration aspects
In this section we provide further signaling details on how to support
irregular channels given the 7MHz allocation as an example.
The gNB broadcasts the DL carrier bandwidth and the bandwidth of the initial
BWP (BWP#0) in SIB1. For the 7MHz allocation, SIB1 can indicate DL next larger
standard channel bandwidth, i.e. 10 MHz, and that the initial DL BWP can be
set to 5 MHz:
\- SIB1-> servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon-> frequencyInfoDL->
scs-SpecificCarrierList-> carrierBandwidth = 52 PRBs / subcarrierSpacing = 15
kHz
\- SIB1-> servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon->
initialDownlinkBWP-> genericParameters-> locationAndBandwidth = 25 PRBs
Once the UE established the RRC connection, the gNB can account for the UE
capabilities and re-configure the UE accordingly. At this point the gNB may
override the carrier bandwidth value that the UE obtained from SIB1 and
configure a dedicated BWP with a bandwidth that differs from the bandwidth of
BWP#0. gNB may configure a larger bandwidth part that will cover the whole
7MHz allocation.
\- ServingCellConfig-> downlinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List-> carrierBandwidth = 52
PRBs, subcarrierSpacing = 15 kHz
\- ServingCellConfig-> downlinkBWP-ToAddModList-> bwp-Common->
genericParameters-> locationAndBandwidth = TBD PRBs
### 6.1.3 UE channel filters
A typical UE architecture utilises a number of filters of two major types --
analogue and digital -- and it is generally up to the UE implementation how
they are combined. Nevertheless, it is often the case that a UE uses first the
wideband analogue filter which typically covers a whole band. In addition to
that, a UE may use another NR channel bandwidth specific analogue filter,
premise function on which is to filter our non-adjacent blockers. However,
since even the NR channel bandwidth specific analogue filter cannot ensure
\"brick-wall\" like filtering, a UE also applies digital filter after ADC to
eliminate adjacent blockers. Depending on the UE implementation, the digital
filter is a combination of the hardware and software components that allow the
UE to apply the corresponding filter coefficients to support a wide range of
standard channels, e.g. from 5MHz to 100MHz in case of FR1.
Sub-clause 6.1.2 provides the example in which the carrier bandwidth is 10MHz
/ 52 RBs, but the actual allocation is limited to the smaller bandwidth
through the corresponding signalling of the bandwidth part. Current
specifications do not define how a UE configures its digital filter. So, in
the provided example a UE implementation may configure the digital filter in
accordance with the carrier bandwidth \"ignoring\" the actual bandwidth part
size. This is illustrated further in Figure 6.1.3-1 below the wanted signal is
smaller than 10MHz, but the UE filter is always set to 10MHz as signalled by
the network. As can be seen, if there an adjacent blocker, then it can
\"leak\" into the wanted signal region.

## 6.2 Study of overlapping UE channel bandwidths
### 6.2.1 Overlapping UE CBW
#### 6.2.1.1 General
One way to utilise the whole chunk of irregular spectrum of a particular size
is to combine several overlapping channels of next lower standard channel
bandwidth. As an example, Figure X-1 shows a case when two overlapping 10MHz
carriers cover 13MHz channel bandwidth. From an individual UE perspective,
each UE is configured with existing immediately lower channel bandwidth
following legacy procedures and signalling: one UE can use the first 10MHz
carrier, while another UE can use another carrier. In fact, both UEs can use
overlapping part of the spectrum provided that the BS takes care that the
overlapping region is allocated to one particular carrier at a time. It should
be also noted that from the UE perspective, an existing immediately lower
channel bandwidth will be always used, either for initial access (as the
channel bandwidth advertised by the network) or as a dedicated channel
bandwidth configured by RRC. From the network perspective, the BS will/can use
the whole irregular channel bandwidth.
{width="1.5833333333333333in" height="1.1979166666666667in"}
**Figure 6.2.1.1-1: Using overlapping carriers (example for 13MHz).**
It is worth noting that overall capacity of the cell will be according to the
irregular channel bandwidth because the BS can use the full bandwidth.
However, since a particular UE will use only one carrier of a smaller
bandwidth within the irregular channel bandwidth, the maximum throughput for a
single UE will be less than the theoretically possible within the spectrum in
case there is only a single UE in the cell. Nevertheless, since there will be
multiple UEs in the cell the overall system throughput will not decrease.
#### 6.2.1.2 Detailed description
One of the challenges associated with configuring overlapping carriers for the
same frequency allocation is that both carriers should have aligned grid so
that the BS can perform same FFT and schedule resources in the overlapping
region.
While aligning RB grids is not an issue for bands above 3GHz that have the SCS
based raster, it becomes more challenging for the sub-3GHz band that have
100kHz raster. As a result, carriers can be configured on raster points that
correspond to the least common multiple of the channel raster and the RB size.
As an example, the least common multiple will be 900kHz in case of the 15kHz
SCS, which corresponds to 5RBs. It effectively means that overlapping carriers
will not be able to address efficiently any irregular spectrum size and in
some case maybe will not be applicable at all. Of course one way to improve
spectrum utilisation is to allow shifting carriers in multiples of 1RB, but
that will require introduction of new raster points, which will not be
supported by legacy UEs.
Figure 6.2.1.2-2 presents an example for the 6MHz channel comprising two 5MHz
channels. As can be seen from the figure, centre frequency distance between
carriers is 900kHz, which is a multiple of 100kHz channel raster and 180kHz RB
size. From an individual UE perspective, it is just a normal 5MHz carrier
comprising 25RBs and having the 5MHz channel guard bands. From the BS
perspective, it is a 6MHz channel with 30RBs. Figure 6.2.1.2-3 exemplifies how
this approach can be used to support the 7MHz irregular channel bandwidth, in
which the distance between the carriers is 1800kHz. Finally, Figure 6.2.1.2-4
shows the 11MHz channel that is supported with two 10MHz channels.Referring to
Figure 6.2.1.2-2, 6.2.1.2-3 and 6.2.1.2-4, it should be noted that guard bands
will not necessarily be symmetrical and the exact guard band size will depend
on a particular spectrum allocation, its size, and how the overlapping
channels are placed.

carriers).**
Table 6.2.1.2-1 below summarises potential number of schedulable RBs for a
scenario when the next smaller overlapping channels are used. To calculate
them, it is assumed that distance between individual carriers is a multiple of
900kHz and that the resulting guard bands must meet at least next smaller
channel requirements. So, \"Channel Nrb\", and \"Utilisation\" represent the
network view, while from the UE perspective all the parameters are the same as
for the next smaller channel.
**Table 6.2.1.2-1: Exemplary number of RBs based on the next smaller
overlapping channel (15kHz SCS).**

band (kHz)** **Next smaller channel Nrb** **Channel Nrb** **Utilisation (%)**

Table 6.2.1.2-2 presents similar calculations for the number of available RBs
with overlapping carriers, but for the 30kHz SCS. As can be seen from the
table, a solution based on the 30kHz SCS overlapping carriers does not provide
a good spectral utilisation for certain non-standard channel bandwidths due to
the reason that the \"distance\" between carriers raster points must be a
multiple of 1800kHz. Because of that, channel bandwidths such as 7 and 12MHz
have more or less good utilisation, whereas 6 and 11MHz do not provide any
benefit at all.

To suppport two overlapping carriers, the network can consider using one or
two SSBs. To be more precise, since the the SSB bandwidth is 3.6MHz and the
CORESET#0 bandwidth is 4.32MHz, a single SSB/CORESET#0 can be placed into a
common part between two overlapping channels. However, this approach works
only if the overlapping part is at least 4.32MHz, e.g. it is not applicable to
7MHz irregular channels. So, some irregular channel bandwidth will needed two
SSB/CORESET#0. In this case, at least for irregular channel bandwidths \ servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon-> frequencyInfoDL->
scs-SpecificCarrierList-> carrierBandwidth = 25 PRBs / subcarrierSpacing = 15
kHz
\- SIB1-> servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon->
initialDownlinkBWP-> genericParameters-> locationAndBandwidth = 25 PRBs

received. The text above is current RAN4 understanding._
6.2.1.4 Compatiblity with legacy devices
Overlapping channels from the network perspective works with all the legacy
UEs. As presented in previous sub-clauses, from an individual UE perspective,
this is just a standard Rel-15 channel and no special UE side enhancements are
needed. Thus an operator can use this solution with the whole ecosystem of
available devices.
### 6.2.2 Combined UE CBW (one cell)
#### 6.2.2.1 General Aspects
\- Studied spectrum blocks covered by "main RF carrier" and "additional RF
carrier"
\- The "main RF carrier" is Rel-15 compatible and contains the SSB as well as
all necessary broadcast information, legacy UEs and UEs which do not support
this solution are able to camp on it and be connected without being aware of
the "additional RF carrier"
\- The "additional RF carrier" , which is partially overlapping with the "main
RF carrier", is aligned to the "main RF carrier" PRB grid and utilizes further
PRBs that fit in relevant spectrum block. UEs which support this solution
would be reconfigured (once UE capabilities are known) in RRC_CONNECTED to use
wider BWP than used for initial access.
\- The "main RF carrier" and the "additional RF carrier" treated as single
cell (one carrier from baseband perspective) to allow for a single BWP to
cover studied spectrum block in RRC_CONNECTED
\- Both the "main RF carrier" and the "additional RF carrier" would clearly
define the size and position of the guard band which allows for an unambiguous
placement of the overlapping channel filters and thus prevents problems with
OBUE, ACS or in-band blocking
\- From UE perspective, supported in downlink only
6.2.2.2 Signalling and configuration aspects
In this section we provide further signaling details on how to support
irregular channels given the 7MHz allocation as an example.
The gNB broadcasts the DL carrier bandwidth and the bandwidth of the initial
BWP (BWP#0) in SIB1. For the 7MHz allocation, SIB1 would indicate DL standard
channel bandwidth (i.e. 5 MHz), the initial DL BWP would be set to 5 MHz to
accommodate legacy and new UEs:
> \- SIB1-> servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon-> frequencyInfoDL->
> scs-SpecificCarrierList-> carrierBandwidth = 25 PRBs / subcarrierSpacing =
> 15 kHz
\- SIB1-> servingCellConfigCommon-> downlinkConfigCommon->
initialDownlinkBWP-> genericParameters-> locationAndBandwidth = 25 PRBs
Once the UE established the RRC connection, the gNB can account for the UE
capabilities and re-configure the UE accordingly. At this point the gNB may
override the carrier bandwidth value that the UE obtained from SIB1 and
configure a dedicated BWP with a bandwidth that differs from the bandwidth of
BWP#0. gNB may configure a larger bandwidth part that will cover the whole
7MHz allocation.
\- ServingCellConfig-> downlinkChannelBW-PerSCS-List-> carrierBandwidth = 36
PRBs, subcarrierSpacing = 15 kHz
\- ServingCellConfig-> downlinkBWP-ToAddModList-> bwp-Common->
genericParameters-> locationAndBandwidth = 36 PRBs
It should be noted that 36 PRBs do not correspond to any channel bandwidth
currently defined in TS 38.101-1.
_Editor's note: Signalling aspects to be updated once LS from RAN1/2 is
received. The text above is current RAN4 understanding._
6.2.2.3 UE architecture aspects
With respect to the UE architecture, the following assumptions are made
(according to SID objectives):
  * New (dedicated) channel filters (e.g. non-integer-multiples of 5 MHz) are not considered
  * UEs not supporting this solution (both legacy and new UEs) should be able to use the next lower supported channel bandwidth in the UL and DL without implications
Two different UE architecture scenarios are explained (legacy UEs using next
smaller bandwidth in Clause 6.6.2 and UEs supporting two receive chains for
reception described below:
This option is for new UEs that contain transceiver architectures and
configurations that have flexibility in local oscillator and receive chain
assignments. The flexibility in the configuration allows the UEs to configure
their receive paths (Antenna to FFT) similarly to non-contiguous carrier
aggregation, allowing the two LO and receive chains to down-convert the
spectrum of the irregular bandwidth as if it consisted of two separate
carriers on the UE side. Based on the channel center of the main RF carrier
and the configured irregular bandwidth the UE would know where to place the
center frequency of the additional RF carrier that follows the PRB grid (which
overlaps with the main RF carrier and includes the remaining agreed PRBs for
the irregular BW). The UE down-converts two different sets of PRBs, with an
overlapping segment and may use for irregular bandwidth below 15MHz the next
smaller bandwidth channel filtering on both of the receive chains as shown in
Figure 6.2.2.3-1 ("DigRF" serves as an example only and corresponds to the
interface between RF and baseband chipset). This allows the UE to benefit from
channel filtering designed for the specific bandwidth. Using the next smaller
bandwidth channel filtering on both of the two carrier parts, the baseband
signal processing following the FFTs must be modified such that the signals
from these two carrier parts are combined and processed as a single codeword
instead of being process separately. Since the LOs on the UE will operate at
different frequencies, there will be a phase difference of the two signals
contained in the two receive chains for the separate carriers.
In order to prevent problems in the channel estimation if there is an
averaging or interpolation across reference signals at different subcarriers,
the phases of the symbols in the frequency domain from both RF receive chains
caused by the UE's use of separate LOs should be aligned. This can be achieved
by a new function comparing the overlapping symbols from both FFT outputs and
phase shifting one FFT output accordingly before the FFT outputs are merged.

Depending on the receiver architecture and the distribution of the channel
filtering between the analogue and the digital domain, it is also possible to
A/D convert a frequency range that accommodates the entire irregular BW and to
split the signal afterwards by means of NCOs (instead of LOs) into the 2 RF
carriers with their individual channel filter positions as shown in Figure
6.2.2.3-2.

### 6.2.3 Overlapping CA (two cells)
#### 6.2.3.1 General Aspects
Using the Overlapping CA approach to support irregular spectrum is one of the
methods without the need of introduction of new dedicated channel bandwidths
for both UE and BS. Figure 6.2.3-1 shows overlapping CA from network
perspective, in which BS supports the intra-band overlapping CA, while UEs
only supports the single CC with the existing channel bandwidth. And figure
6.2.3-2 shows overlapping CA from UE perspective, in which both BS and UE
support the intra-band overlapping CA to use all RBs.
Even two CCs are overlapped in frequency domain, the network can configure
different CCs with non-overlapping BWP to avoid the conflict of physical
signals or channels.
**Figure 6.2.3-1** : Overlapping CA from network perspective
Figure 6.2.3-2: Overlapping CA from UE perspective
In summary,
\- No new gNB channel bandwidth is required
\- Legacy UE using existing lower regular NR channel bandwidth can operate in
either carrier
\- Overlapping CA approach needs to have PRB grid alignment between
overlapping CCs
\- UE perspective, overlapping CA is optional supported in DL only
\- Irregular bandwidth utilizing overlapping CA approach cannot be combined
with NR CA combinations
## 6.3 Complexity and efficiency study
#### 6.3.1 Combined UE CBW (one cell)
\- Does not require new channel filters for UE and gNB to be designed and
tested
\- Requires support of two RF carriers phase aligned on the Tx side to ensure
phase continuity on the Rx side
> \- Requires split of the irregular bandwidth into two sets of PRBs that may
> be filtered through the next smaller bandwidth after which the signal is
> combined at baseband as a single carrier. For such processing, UE may
> benefit from supporting intra-band non-contiguous CA.
>
> \- Requires UE architecture with capability to split LNA output signal to
> two separate LO paths for down-conversion. Also requires UE architecture
> with the ability to combine baseband signals.
\- For scenarios with less than 10 MHz, second SSB is not excluded but not
recommended due to significant additional overhead (duplicated SSB
transmission as well as other radio resources such as PDCCH, CSI-RS, PDSCH
(for SIB), CSI for Tracking, etc.). However, second SSB could enable or
improve the legacy UEs\' use of the further PRBs provided by the additional RF
carrier in spectrum scenarios with less than 10 MHz.
\- "Additional RF carrier" not to be on the channel raster to increase
spectrum utilization (up to 2 PRBs), it should be noted that the complete
"additional RF carrier" is used only by UEs which support this solution
"additional RF carrier" can be used partially (with up to 2 PRBs not
available) by legacy UEs which are on the channel raster.
\- Proposed BWPs size of the irregular spectrum chunk may have an impact on
performance requirements and additional testing
\- High spectrum utilization:
> \- due to low internal guard band. The spectrum utilization values in the
> table below use guard band values according to the minimum guard bands
> defined for the smallest possible channel bandwidths that could be
> theoretically considered as part of each combined UE CBW. The actual minimum
> guard band requirements for combined UE CBW configurations would require
> further discussion in any follow-up WI.
\- as well as no additional CA overhead (duplicated common channels and
signals such as SSB, PDCCH and CSI-RS configured both in Pcell and Scell, in
addition of the MAC processes associated with CA) due to single baseband
carrier usage:

#### 6.3.2 Overlapping CA (two cells)
From network perspective:
For gNB, no new filter for RF channel is needed. The CA implementation can be
reused. The only update is to allow the configuration that the two carriers
can be partially overlapped by adjusting the channel spacing. The network can
prevent collisions between the two component carriers.
For UE, there is no impact and fully backwards compatible.
From UE perspective:
For gNB, the two RF carriers aggregated by the UE would need to be time-
aligned by the gNB to at least [the same level required for existing intra-
band contiguous CA (TS 38.104 Timing Adjustment Error)] to allow UE reception.
It is FFS as to whether finer timing alignment would be required.
For UE, it is optional support in DL only. For the UE supports DL intra-band
non-contiguous CA with corresponding channel bandwidth(s), overlapping CA can
be considered by support the configuration with partially overlapping
carriers. And in the case no new channel filter for UE is needed.
For overlapping CA solution, the legacy channel bandwidth should be supported,
hence the minimum guardband should not be less than the minimum guardband of
lower UE channel bandwidth than operator licensed bandwidth. To support legacy
UEs, channel raster should be applied for each UE channels. And in order to
simplify the resource schedule and make the use of single SSB for CA
operation, RB alignment is required. Table 6.3.x-1 show the channel spacing
and spectrum utilization for the example channel bandwidths assuming symmetric
CA channel bandwidth.

## 6.4 Generic solutions guidance
NOTE: The 6^th^ objective is not an analysis/study but a guidance on
solutions. A comparison of the proposed solutions with respect to the criteria
in the 6^th^ objective should be included in this clause.
6.4.1 Overlapping UE CBW
This approach can be also be applied to all irregular channel bandwidths with
only consideration of different spectral utilization considerations. However
the single CORESET#0 and SSB is only applicable for bandwidths greater than 10
MHz. All irregular channel bandwidths two SSBs can be used (irregular channel
bandwidths \ **Figure 6.6.2-1** : Legacy UE may be configured for either of the two

## 6.7 RAN4 standard impact identification
#### 6.7.1 Combined UE CBW (one cell)
\- Very limited since both the "main RF carrier" and the "additional RF
carrier" would conform to existing 3GPP requirements, to guarantee co-
existence
#### 6.7.2 Overlapping CA (two cells)
The CA framework defines the transmitter emission and receiver blocking at the
edge of carriers. Limited impacted is expected to enable coexistence with
neighbouring channels for this scenario. Overlapping CA channel spacing need
to be updated to consider channel raster, minimum guard band and RB alignment.
For 15 KHz SCS and 100 KHz channel raster,
$$\text{Channel}\mspace{6mu}\text{spacing} = \left\lfloor
\frac{2*BW_{Ch\text{annel}} - (BW_{Ch\text{annel}\left( 1 \right)} +
BW_{Ch\text{annel}\left( 2 \right)})}{1.8} \right\rfloor
0.9\mspace{6mu}(\text{MHz)}$$
For NR _operating bands_ with 15 kHz channel raster,
$$\text{Channel}\mspace{6mu}\text{spacing} = \left\lfloor \frac{2
_BW_{Ch\text{annel}} - (BW_{Ch\text{annel}\left( 1 \right)} +
BW_{Ch\text{annel}\left( 2 \right)})}{0.18_ 2^{n + 1}} \right\rfloor
0.18*2^{n}\mspace{6mu}(\text{MHz)}$$
with
$n = \mu_{0}$
#### 6.7.y Overlapping UE CBW
If the irregular channel bandwidths are explicitly defined in the
specification, it will create huge technical specification work. For each
channel bandwidth, the guard band size and the transmission bandwidth
configuration need to be specified and used as a basis for defining
transmitter and receiver requirements. The identified impact to BS core
specification for a new channel BW is shown in following Table 6.7.y-1.
