# 1 Scope
The present document covers the assessment of NR repeater and ancillary
equipment in respect of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC).
The present document specifies the applicable requirements, procedures, test
conditions, performance assessment and performance criteria for NR repeater
and associated ancillary equipment in the following categories:
\- NR repeater equipped with antenna connectors which are possible to be
terminated during EMC testing, meeting the _repeater type 1-C_ RF requirements
of TS 38.106 [2], with conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 38.115-1
[3].
\- NR repeater not equipped with antenna connectors, i.e. with antenna
elements radiating during the EMC testing, meeting the _repeater type 2-O_ RF
requirements of TS 38.106 [2], with conformance demonstrated by compliance to
TS 38.115-2 [4].
The environment classification used in the present document refers to the
residential, commercial and light industrial environment classification used
in IEC 61000‑6-1 [6], IEC 61000-6-3 [7] and IEC 61000-6-8 [24].
The EMC requirements have been selected to ensure an adequate level of
compatibility for apparatus at residential, commercial and light industrial
environments. The levels, however, do not cover extreme cases which may occur
in any location but with low probability of occurrence.

**ancillary equipment: electrical or electronic equipment, that is intended to
be used with a receiver or transmitter**
NOTE: It is considered as an ancillary equipment if:
the equipment is intended for use with a receiver or transmitter to provide
additional operational and/or control features to the radio equipment, (e.g.
to extend control to another position or location); and
the equipment cannot be used on a stand alone basis to provide user functions
independently of a receiver or transmitter; and
the receiver or transmitter, to which it is connected, is capable of providing
some intended operation such as transmitting and/or receiving without the
ancillary equipment (i.e. it is not a sub-unit of the main equipment essential
to the main equipment basic functions).
**antenna port: for EMC purposes,** _port_ for connection of an antenna used
for intentional transmission and/or reception of radiated RF energy,
equivalent to an RF antenna connector.

that is defined with a specific set of technical requirements.
**passband edge** _:_ Frequency at the edge of the passband
**port:** A particular interface, of the specified equipment (apparatus), with
the electromagnetic environment. For example, any connection point on an
equipment intended for connection of cables to or from that equipment is
considered as a port (see Figure 3.1-1).

# 4 Test conditions
## 4.1 General
Requirements throughout the EMC specifications are in some cases defined
separately for different frequency ranges (FR). The frequency ranges FR1 and
FR2 are defined in clause 5.1 of TS 38.106 [x].
The equipment shall be tested in normal test environment defined in the
corresponding NR Repeater conformance testing specification TS 38.115-1 [x]
for _NR Repeater type 1-C_ or TS 38.115-2 [x] for _NR Repeater type 2-O._ The
test conditions shall be recorded in the test report.
For Repeater capable of multi-band operation, the requirements in the present
document apply for each supported _operating band_ unless otherwise stated.
_Operating bands_ shall be activated according to the test configuration in
clause 4.5. Tests shall be performed relating to each type of _port_ and all
_operating bands_ shall be assessed during the tests.
The manufacturer shall declare the supported _operating band(s)_ according to
the list of NR repeater _operating bands_ defined in TS 38.106 [x].
> NOTE 1: NR _operating bands_ for _repeater type 1-C_ , are declared by the
> manufacturer according to the declaration D.3 specified in TS 38.115-1 [x],
> table [x].
>
> NOTE 2: NR _operating bands_ for _repeater type 2-O,_ are declared by the
> manufacturer according to the declaration D.4 specified in TS 38.115-2 [x],
> table [x].
## 4.2 Arrangements for establishing a communication link
The wanted RF input signal nominal frequency shall be selected by setting the
NR Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) to an appropriate
number, as defined in TS 38.106 [x], clause 5.3.1.2.
A communication link shall be set up with a suitable test system capable of
evaluating the required performance criteria (hereafter called \"the test
system\") at the radio interface and _telecommunication port(s)_ (the BS
interface). The test system shall be located outside of the test environment.
When the EUT is required to be in the uplink/downlink operation, the following
conditions shall be met:
\- For the _repeater type 1-C_ , the EUT shall be commanded to operate at
maximum rated output power;
\- For the r _epeater type 2-O_ testing, the EUT output power shall be
configured as stated in clause 8.1 for emission test and clause 9.1 for
immunity test accordingly;
\- Adequate measures shall be taken to avoid the effect of the unwanted signal
on the measuring equipment;
For immunity tests clause 4.3 shall apply and the conditions shall be as
follows.
## 4.3 Narrow band responses
Responses on uplink or downlink occurring during the immunity test at discrete
frequencies which are narrow band responses (spurious responses), are
identified by the following method:
> \- if during an immunity test the quantity being monitored goes outside the
> specified tolerances (clause 6), it is necessary to establish whether the
> deviation is due to a narrow band response or to a wide band (EMC)
> phenomenon. Therefore, the test shall be repeated with the unwanted signal
> frequency increased, and then decreased by 2 x BW~Channel~ MHz, where
> BW~Channel~ is the channel bandwidth as defined in TS 38.106 [2], clause
> 5.3;
\- if the deviation disappears in either one or both of the above MHz offset
cases, then the response is considered as a narrow band response;
\- if the deviation does not disappear, this may be due to the fact that the
offset has made the frequency of the unwanted signal correspond to the
frequency of another narrow band response. Under these circumstances the
procedure is repeated with the increase and decrease of the frequency of the
unwanted signal set to 2.5 x BW~Channel~ MHz;
\- if the deviation does not disappear with the increased and/or decreased
frequency, the phenomenon is considered wide band and therefore an EMC problem
and the equipment fails the test.
For immunity test narrow band responses are disregarded.
For EUT capable of multi-band operation, all supported _operating bands_ shall
be considered for narrowband responses.
## 4.4 Exclusion bands
The _exclusion band_ for NR repeater is the frequency range over which no
tests of radiated immunity are made in UL or DL.
The _exclusion band_ for DL is defined as:
F~DL,low~ -- Δf~OBUE~ \1 m | | | | | | | (NOTE 2) | (NOTE 2) | +======================+======================+======================+ | Effective radiated | ±6 dB | ±6 dB | | RF power between 30 | | | | MHz and 180 MHz | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Effective radiated | ±4 dB | ±6 dB | | RF power between 180 | | | | MHz and 4 GHz | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Effective radiated | ±6 dB | ±9 dB (NOTE 1) | | RF power between 4 | | | | GHz and 12,75 GHz | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Effective radiated | ±6 dB | ±9 dB (NOTE 1) | | RF power between | | | | 12,75 GHz and 26 GHz | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Field strength | ±6 dB | ±6 dB | | between 30 MHz and | | | | 12,75 GHz | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | NOTE 1: This value | | | | may be reduced to ±6 | | | | dB when further | | | | information on the | | | | potential radiation | | | | characteristic of | | | | the EUT is | | | | available. | | | | | | | | NOTE 2: These MU | | | | values estimates and | | | | are not based on the | | | | MU budget | | | | calculations. For | | | | more background on | | | | MU derivation | | | | analyses refer to | | | | CISPR 16-4-2 [27] | | | | and ETSI TR 100 | | | | 028-1 [28]. | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
NOTE: If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in table 8.2.1.4-1, this equipment can still be
used, provided that an adjustment is made follows:
Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that specified in
table 8.2.1.4-1 is used to tighten the test requirements, i.e. making the test
harder to pass.
This procedure will ensure that a test system not compliant with table
8.2.1.4-1 does not increase the probability of passing an EUT that would
otherwise have failed a test if a test system compliant with table 8.2.1.4-1
had been used.

# 9 Immunity
## 9.1 Test configurations
This clause defines the configurations for immunity tests as follows:
\- the equipment shall be tested under normal test conditions as specified in
the functional standards;
\- during the test, the RF output power may be reduced to a power level
sufficient for establishing and maintaining the required communication link;
\- the test configuration shall be as close to normal intended use as
possible;
\- if the equipment is part of a system, or can be connected to _ancillary
equipment_ , then it shall be acceptable to test the equipment while connected
to the minimum configuration of _ancillary equipment_ necessary to exercise
the _port_ s;
\- if the equipment has a large number of _port_ s, then a sufficient number
shall be selected to simulate actual operation conditions and to ensure that
all the different types of termination are tested;
\- the test conditions, test configuration and mode of operation shall be
recorded in the test report;
\- _port_ s which in normal operation are connected shall be connected to an
_ancillary equipment_ or to a representative piece of cable correctly
terminated to simulate the input/output characteristics of the _ancillary
equipment_. In case of _repeater type 1-C_ , _antenna ports_ shall be
correctly terminated;
\- _port_ s which are not connected to cables during normal operation, shall
not be connected to any cables for the purpose of EMC testing. Where cables
have to be connected to these _port_ s, or interconnecting cables have to be
extended in length in order to exercise the EUT, precautions shall be taken to
ensure that the evaluation of the EUT is not affected by the addition or
extension of these cables;
\- immunity tests on the entire NR repeater shall be performed by establishing
communication links at the radio interface (e.g. with the mobile simulator)
and the BS interface (e.g. with a BS simulator) and evaluating the power
accuracy;
\- immunity tests shall be performed on both the uplink and downlink paths.
The tests shall also include both the radio interface and the BS interface.
Power accuracy evaluation may be carried out at either interface, where
appropriate, and the measurements for the uplink and downlink paths may be
carried out as a single path looped at either the radio interface or BS
interface. In case of looping is used care have to be taken that the power
accuracy doesn\'t change due to looping;
\- for NR repeater capable of multi-band operation, communication links shall
be established in such a way that all _operating band_(s) are activated during
the test according to the applicable test configurations in clause 4.5.
Performance assessment may be done separately for each _operating band_.
