# 4 General
## 4.1 General aspects
The PDU Session User Plane protocol is located in the User Plane of the Radio
Network Layer above the Transport Network Layer of the interface.
Each PDU session User Plane protocol instance is associated to one PDU
Session.
In this version of the present document, the PDU session user plane protocol
data is conveyed by GTP-U protocol means, more specifically, by means of the
\"PDU Session Container\" GTP-U Extension Header as defined in TS 29.281 [3].
# 5 PDU Session user plane protocol
## 5.1 General
The PDU session UP layer uses the services of the Transport Network Layer in
order to send its packets over the interface.
## 5.2 PDU Session user plane protocol layer services
The following functions are provided by the PDU Session User Plane protocol:
\- Provision of control information elements (e.g. QFI, RQI) associated with a
PDU session.
## 5.3 Services expected from the Transport Network Layer
The PDU session UP layer expects the following services from the Transport
Network Layer:
\- Transfer of PDU session User Plane PDUs.
## 5.4 Elementary procedures
### 5.4.1 Transfer of DL PDU Session Information
#### 5.4.1.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Transfer of DL PDU Session Information procedure is to send
control information elements related to the PDU Session from UPF to NG-RAN.
In the case of uplink and downlink data forwarding the DL PDU Session
Information procedure shall also be used to send control information elements
related to the PDU Session from NG-RAN node to UPF, or from UPF to NG-RAN
node, or between NG-RAN nodes.
A PDU Session user plane instance making use of the Transfer of DL PDU Session
Information procedure is associated to a single PDU Session. The Transfer of
DL PDU Session Information procedure may be invoked whenever packets for that
particular PDU Session need to be transferred across the related interface
instance.
The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame includes a QoS Flow Identifier (QFI)
field associated with the transferred packet. The NG-RAN shall use the
received QFI to determine the QoS flow and QoS profile which are associated
with the received packet.
The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame shall include the Reflective QoS
Indicator (RQI) field to indicate whether user plane Reflective QoS shall be
activated or not. The NG-RAN shall, if RQA has been configured for the
involved QoS flow as specified in TS 38.413 [7], take the RQI into account as
specified in TS 37.324 [4].
The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame may also include a Paging Policy
Indicator (PPI) field associated with the transferred packet. The NG-RAN shall
use the received PPI to determine the paging policy differentiation which is
associated with the received packet as described in TS 23.501 [5].
The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame may also include a QoS Monitoring Packet
(QMP) field and a DL sending time stamp field. The NG-RAN shall, if QoS
monitoring has been configured for the included QFI field, perform delay
measurement and QoS monitoring, as specified in TS 23.501 [5].
The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame may also include a DL QFI Sequence Number
field associated with the transferred packet. The NG-RAN shall, if the QoS
flow has been configured eligible for redundant transport bearer in TS 38.413
[6], use the received DL QFI Sequence Number field to determine and eliminate
duplicated packets for a given QoS flow as specified in TS 23.501 [5].
The DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame may also include a DL MBS QFI Sequence
Number field associated with the transferred packet. The NG-RAN shall use the
received DL MBS QFI Sequence Number field to determine the PDCP count that
should be used when transferring the packet over the radio as specified in TS
38.300 [2].
When needed, the NG-RAN shall propagate the DL PDU Session Information to a
peer NG-RAN.

### 5.4.2 Transfer of UL PDU Session Information
#### 5.4.2.1 Successful operation
The purpose of the Transfer of UL PDU Session Information procedure is to send
control information elements related to the PDU Session from NG-RAN to UPF.
An UL PDU Session user plane instance making use of the Transfer of UL PDU
Session Information procedure is associated to a single PDU Session. The
Transfer of UL PDU Session Information procedure may be invoked whenever
packets for that particular PDU Session need to be transferred across the
related interface instance.
The UL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame includes a QoS Flow Identifier (QFI)
field associated with the transferred packet.
If QoS monitoring has been requested for the included QFI field, the UL PDU
SESSION INFORMATION frame may include a QoS Monitoring Packet (QMP) field, a
DL Sending Time Stamp Repeated field, a DL Receiving Time Stamp field, a UL
Sending Time Stamp field, and/or Delay Result for UL or DL. If QoS monitoring
with N3/N9 delay reporting has been requested for the included QFI field, the
I-UPF may include in the UL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame a N3/N9 Delay Ind.
field, a N3/N9 Delay Result field and delay result for UL and DL if received
from the RAN. The UPF shall, if supported, use this information to calculate
UL, DL, or RTT delay as specified in TS 23.501 [5].
The UL PDU SESSION INFORMATION frame may also include a UL QFI Sequence Number
field associated with the transferred packet. The UPF shall, if the QoS flow
has been configured eligible for redundant transport bearer in TS 38.413 [6],
use the received UL QFI Sequence Number field to determine and eliminate
duplicated packets for a given QoS flow as specified in TS 23.501 [5].

## 5.5 Elements for the PDU Session user plane protocol
### 5.5.1 General
In the present document the structure of frames are specified by using figures
similar to figure 5.5.1-1.
Bits | 
> Number of Octets
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
7 | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | 0 |  |   
Field 1 | Field 2 | 1 | Octet 1 |  |  |  |  |  |   
Field 3 | Field 4 | 2 | Octet 2 |  |  |  |  |  |   
Field 4 continue | Spare |  | Octet 3 |  |  |  |  |  |   
Field 6 | 2 | Octet 4 Octet 5 |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Field 6 continue | Padding bits |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Future Extension | 0-m |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Padding | 0-3 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
Figure 5.5.1-1: Example frame format
Unless otherwise indicated, fields which consist of multiple bits within an
octet have the most significant bit located at the higher bit position
(indicated above frame in figure 5.5.1-1). In addition, if a field spans
several octets, most significant bits are located in lower numbered octets
(right of frame in figure 5.5.1-1).
On the NG interface, the frame is transmitted starting from the lowest
numbered octet. Within each octet, the bits are sent according to decreasing
bit position (bit position 7 first).
Spare bits should be set to \"0\" by the sender and should not be checked by
the receiver.
The header part of the frame is always an integer number of octets. The
payload part is octet aligned (by adding \'Padding Bits\' when needed).
The receiver should be able to remove an additional Future Extension field
that may be present.\ See description of Future Extension field in A.1.
Padding octets may be added at the end of the frame, see Padding in 5.5.3.5.
### 5.5.2 Frame format for the PDU Session user plane protocol
#### 5.5.2.1 DL PDU SESSION INFORMATION (PDU Type 0)
This frame format is defined to allow the NG-RAN to receive some control
information elements which are associated with the transfer of a packet over
the interface.

New IE 1 is present or not. New IE flag 1 indicates if the new IE 2 is present
or not.
## A.1.1 New IE Flags
**Description:** The _New IE Flags_ IE is only present if at least one new IE
is present. The _New IE Flags_ IE contains flags indicating which new IEs that
are present following the _New IE Flags_ IE. The last bit position of the _New
IE Flags_ IE is used as the Extension Flag to allow the extension of the _New
IE Flags_ IE in the future. Extension octets of the _New IE Flags_ IE shall
follow directly after the first octet of the _New IE Flags_ IE. When an
extension octet of the _New IE Flags_ IE is present, then all previous
extension octets of the _New IE Flags_ IE and the _New IE Flags_ IE shall also
be present, even if they have all their flag bits indicating no presence of
their respective new IEs.
