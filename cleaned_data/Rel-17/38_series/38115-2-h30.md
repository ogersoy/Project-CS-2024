# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for NR _Repeater_ _type 2-O_. These have been derived
from, and are consistent with the radiated requirements for _Repeater type
2-O_ in Repeater specification defined in TS 38.106 [2].
A _repeater type 1-C_ only has conducted requirements so it does not require
compliance to this specification.
_Repeater type 2-O_ have only radiated requirements so they require compliance
to this specification only.
# 2 References

text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 4 General radiated test conditions and declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 2 of
this specification, i.e. to all radiated tests defined for FR2. The FR2
frequency range is defined in clause 5.1 of TS 38.106 [2].
The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.106 [2]. Test Tolerances for the
radiated test requirements explicitly stated in the present document are given
in annex C of the present document.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances
are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
#### 4.1.2.1 General
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where appropriate.
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for test requirements
included by reference is defined in the respective referred test
specification.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
#### 4.1.2.2 Radiated characteristics measurements
The maximum OTA Test System uncertainty for radiated characteristics
measurements are given in tables 4.1.2.2-1. Details for derivation of OTA Test
System uncertainty are given in corresponding clauses in TR 37.941 [13].

### 6.5.3 OTA operating band unwanted emissions
#### 6.5.3.1 Definition and applicability
The requirements of either clause 6.5.3.4.1 (Category A limits) or clause
6.5.3.4.2 (Category B limits) shall apply. The application of either Category
A or Category B limits shall be the same as for General OTA transmitter
spurious emissions requirements (_repeater type 2-O_) in clause 6.5.4. In
addition, the limits in clause 6.5.3.4.3 may also apply.
Out-of-band emissions in FR2 are limited by OTA operating band unwanted
emission limits.
For _repeater type 2-O_ , unless otherwise stated, the OTA operating band
unwanted emission limits in FR2 are defined from Δf~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink _operating band_ up to Δf~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of each supported downlink _operating band_.
The values of Δf~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1-1 for the NR _operating
bands_.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification. For
a _RIB_ operating in contiguous CA, the requirements apply to the frequencies
(Δf~OBUE~) starting from the edge of the _passband._ In addition, for a _RIB_
operating in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , the requirements apply inside any
_gap between passbands_.
Emissions shall not exceed the maximum levels specified in the tables below,
where:
\- ∆f is the separation between the _passband_ edge frequency and the nominal
-3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the _passband_ edge.
\- f_offset is the separation between the _passband_ edge frequency and the
centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Δf~OBUE~ outside the downlink
_operating band_ , where Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table 6.5.1-1.
\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.
In addition, inside any _gap between passbands_ for a _RIB_ operating in _non-
contiguous spectrum_ , emissions shall not exceed the cumulative sum of the
_limits_ specified for the adjacent _sub-blocks_ on each side of the _gap
between passbands_. The _limit_ for each _sub-block_ is specified in clauses
6.5.3.4.1 and 6.5.3.4.2 below, where in this case:
\- ∆f is the separation between the _sub-block_ edge frequency and the nominal
-3 dB point of the measuring filter closest to the _sub-block_ edge.
\- f_offset is the separation between the _sub-block_ edge frequency and the
centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is equal to the _gap between passbands_ bandwidth minus half
of the bandwidth of the measuring filter.
\- ∆f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.
#### 6.5.3.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is defined in TS 38.106 [2], clause 7.5.3.2
#### 6.5.3.3 Test purpose
This test measures the emissions close to the assigned channel bandwidth of
the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.
#### 6.5.3.4 Method of test
##### 6.5.3.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see clause 4.9.1.
##### 6.5.3.4.2 Procedure
The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional power
measurements as described in annex I.
1) Place the repeater at the positioner.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2) of the
repeater with the test system.
3) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:
\- detection mode: true RMS.
\- As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result
should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
4a) Set the input signal at the RIB according to the applicable test
configuration and direction in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test models
RDL-FR2-TM1.1and RUL-FR2-TM1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at the input power intended to
produce the maximum rated output power, P~in,p,EIRP~ + 10dB.
4b) Verify measurement impact from feeding test signal by generating a signal
for repeater input with repeater to be turned off. Verify measured result is
enough below requirement limit.
5) Orient the positioner (and repeater and test signal source) in order that
the direction to be tested aligns with the test antenna such that measurements
to determine TRP can be performed (see annex G) whilst maintaining the correct
direction of arrival for the test signal.
6) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps and
measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges with the specified
measurement bandwidth. For connector under test declared to operate in non-
contiguous spectrum, the emission within the _sub-block gap_ shall be measured
using the specified measurement bandwidth from the closest sub block edge.
7) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement grid
needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see annex G).
8) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ using the measurements made in Step 7.

The procedure is as follows:
1) Follow steps described in annex G.5.1 for the first two mandatory cuts and

ensure overestimation with 95% confidence.

# G.6 Wave vector space grid
If EUT is mounted along the yz plane as shown in figure G.2.2-1, the reference
step in wave vector space can be determined by
$\Delta u_{\text{ref}} = \frac{\lambda}{D_{y}}$
$$\Delta v_{\text{ref}} = \frac{\lambda}{D_{z}}$$
where _D~y~_ is the length of radiating parts of EUT along y-axis, _D~z~_ is
the length of radiating parts of EUT along the z-axis.
According to the relationship between the normalized wave vector and spherical
coordinate, the wave vector can be represented as following:
$u = \sin\left( \theta \right)\sin\left( \phi \right),\ v = cos(\theta)$
The total radiated power (TRP) in the wave vector space is determined by:
$\text{TRP}_{\text{estimate}} = \frac{{\Delta u}_{\text{ref}}\Delta
v_{\text{ref}}}{4\pi}\left( \sum_{\begin{matrix} u^{2} + v^{2}  0 \ \end{matrix}}^{}{\frac{\text{EIRP}\left( \theta_{n},\phi_{m,n}
\right)}{\sin\theta_{n}\left| \cos\phi_{m,n} \right|}\ } +
\sum_{\begin{matrix} u^{2} + v^{2} < 1 \ \cos\phi < 0 \
\end{matrix}}^{}{\frac{\text{EIRP}\left( \theta_{n},\phi_{m,n}
\right)}{\sin\theta_{n}\left| \cos\phi_{m,n} \right|}\ } \right)$
For spurious Tx or Rx emissions and where due to practical reasons such as
time constraints or turn-table precision, measurement with the reference steps
is not practical, sparser grids can be used. Use of sparse grids can lead to
errors in TRP assessment. In order to characterize these errors, the SF
(sparsity factor) of the grid is defined as
$$\text{SF} = \max\left(
\frac{{\mathrm{\Delta}u}_{\text{grid}}}{\mathrm{\Delta}u_{\text{ref}}},\frac{{\mathrm{\Delta}v}_{\text{grid}}}{\mathrm{\Delta}v_{\text{ref}}}
\right)$$
Where $\mathrm{\Delta}u_{\text{grid}}$and ${\mathrm{\Delta}v}_{\text{grid}}$
are the actual steps used in the wave vector space in the measurement and the
upper bound of their value is 1/12, corresponding to 15 degree steps close to
boresight.
# G.7 Full sphere with sparse sampling
The procedure is as follows:
1) Set the angular grid:
a. Non-harmonic frequencies: choose the angular steps $\Delta\phi$ and
$\Delta\theta$ smaller than or equal to 15 degrees. Calculate the sparsity
factor (SF) as
$SF = \max\left(
\frac{\Delta\phi}{\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}},\frac{\Delta\theta}{\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}}
\right)$
and the correction factor as:
$\text{ΔTRP} = \frac{SF - 1}{SF_{\max} - 1} \cdot 1.0\ dB,$
where $SF_{\max}$ _corresponds to 15 degrees angular step._ If the sparsity
factor is smaller than 1, the correction factor ΔTRP is 0 dB.
Harmonic frequencies with fixed beam test signal: choose the angular steps
smaller than or equal to the reference angular steps $\Delta\phi_{\text{ref}}$
and $\Delta\theta_{\text{ref}}$. Correction factor ΔTRP is 0 dB.
Harmonic frequencies with beam sweeping test signal: set the angular steps to
15 degrees. Correction factor is ΔTRP 0 dB.
2) Apply a suitable numerical integration to calculate the preliminary
TRP~Estimate~.
3) Add the appropriate correction factor ΔTRP according to step 1 to ensure an
overestimation with 95 % confidence.
4) Compare the corrected TRP~Estimate~ (including ΔTRP) with the limit. If the
corrected TRP~Estimate~ is above the limit, choose a smaller angular step and
repeat steps 2-4. If the sparsity factor is less than one, no significant
improvement of accuracy is expected.
# G.8 Beam-based directions
Beam-based direction can be used in the base station _operating band_ only if
the directivity of the radiation pattern of the emssions being measured is
known. TRP~Estimate~ is defined as
$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} =
\frac{\text{EIRP}_{\text{peak}}}{D_{\text{EUT}}}$, where
$\text{EIRP}_{\text{peak}}$ is the maximum EIRP in the beam peak direction
within a particular beam direction pair and $D_{\text{EUT}}$ is the
directivity of the EUT.
# G.9 Peak method
The peak method can be used when frequencies with unwanted peak emissions are
identified during pre-scan. The method does not provide an estimate of TRP.
For each peak emission frequency identified during pre-scan, measure peak EIRP
or power density as follows:
1) Move EUT and test antenna to the same position where the peak emission is
recorded during the pre-scan.
2) Move the EUT around the position and test antenna orientation to find the
final peak EIRP or power density.
3) The measured peak power density or EIRP shall be used to demonstrate
conformance.
NOTE: Peak EIRP is the linear sum of two orthogonal polarized components.
# G.10 Equal sector with peak average
Equal sector with peak average can be performed on frequencies with unwanted
peak emission, which are considered by the peak method for further
measurements.
The spherical angle $\phi$ is divided into K equal sectors. If the largest
dimension of EUT is less than 60 cm, then each sector is a half quadrant of
45°.
For each peak emission frequency, measure peak EIRP of beams belonging to
different sectors of the sphere as follows:
1) Move EUT and test antenna to the same position where the emission peak is
recorded during the pre-scan.
2) Move EUT around the position and test antenna orientation to find the final
peak EIRP.
3) Repeat Steps 1 to 2 until all sectors are covered.
4) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ as
$\text{TRP}_{\text{Estimate}} = \frac{1}{K}\sum_{k = 1}^{K}\text{EIRP}_{k}$,
where $\text{EIRP}_{k}$ is the peak EIRP in the kth sector
NOTE: Peak EIRP is the linear sum of two orthogonal polarized components.
# G.11 Pre-scan
Pre-scan is used to identify frequencies with unwanted emission power levels
above a certain threshold. The pre-scan does not provide an estimate of TRP.
An emission frequency identified by a pre-scan may be further investigated by
any of the TRP measurement methods in this annex.
The procedure for pre-scan is as follows:
1) Scan the entire surface around EUT.
2) Rotate test antenna to cover all possible polarizations of emissions to
detect maximum emissions.
3) Record the list of frequencies and corresponding unwanted emission power
levels, EUT spatial positions, and test antenna polarization for which the
maximum emission levels occur.
4) Emissions which 20 dB or more below the specified limit shall not require
further measurements.
