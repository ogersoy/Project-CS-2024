# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document is a technical report for high power UE (power class 2)
for NR inter-band Carrier Aggregation or NR-NR DC with and without SUL with x
(6≥x>2) bands downlink and y (y=1, 2) bands uplink under Rel-17 time frame.
The purpose is to gather the relevant background information and studies in
order to address power class 2 NR inter-band CA/DC with and without SUL for
more than 2 bands DL and with up to 2 bands UL in Table 1-1.
**Table 1-1 Rel-17 power class 2 NR xBDL/yBUL inter-band CA and SUL**

Note 1: The UL carrier supports power class 2.
Note 2: The integers i and j satisfy: 1 ≤ i ≤ x, 1 ≤ j ≤ x, i ≠ j.
The allowed maximum output power by each of carrier for power class 2 cases is
listed in table 1-2.

# 4 Background
At 3GPP RAN4#91-e meeting, a basket Work Item on "Power class 2 UE for NR
inter-band CA and SUL configurations with x (x>2) bands DL and y (y=1, 2)
bands UL" [2] was approved for Rel-17, of which the objectives are as follows:
1 Specify the band-combination specific RF requirements for all listed power
class 2 NR inter-band UL CA and SUL configurations with power class 2 on NUL
and power class 3 on SUL (xDL/yUL, x>2, y=1, 2).
2 Analysing combinations that have self-desensitization, applicable ∆T~IB,\ c~
and ∆R~IB,\ c~ and reference sensitivity exceptions including MSD test cases.
3 Other additional impact to the requirements due to the high power on UL, if
necessary.
The present document is a technical report for this basket Work Item, and aims
to study the band-combination specific requirements for each of combinations
captured in table 1-1.
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band/band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the
band/band combination have been implemented.

According to PC3 CA_n1-n3-n78, the IMD2 of UL n1 and UL n78 may fall into the
Rx of the 3rd band n3. Due to higher Tx power, more MSD is required for PC2
CA. The additional MSD requirements are defined in Table 6.1.3.1-1.

According to the PC3 CA_n5A-n30A-n77A study captured in TR 38.717-03-02, the
following co-existence issues due to dual uplink were identified:
\- IMD3 products are produced by Band n5 and n30 that might fall in Rx of band
n77.
\- IMD3 products are produced by Band n5 and n77 that might fall in Rx of band
n30.
\- IMD3 and IMD5 products are produced by Band n30 and n77 might fall in Rx of
band n5.
For the IMD products produced by Band n5 and n30 UL, the MSD values of the

According to the PC3 CA_n5A-n14A-n77A study captured in TR 38.717-03-02, the
following co-existence issues due to dual uplink were identified:
\- IMD4 and IMD5 products are produced by Band n5 and n14 that might fall in
Rx of band n77.
\- IMD4 and IMD5 products are produced by Band n5 and n77 that might fall in
Rx of band n14.
\- IMD5 products are produced by Band n14 and n77 might fall in Rx of band n5.
For the IMD products produced by Band n5 and n14 UL, the MSD values of the
corresponding PC3 CA case can be applied since this uplink configuration does
not support PC2.

### 6.17.3 REFSENS requirements
The PC2 dual-uplink carrier co-existence analysis for CA_n2-n66-n77 can be re-
used from DC_2-66_n77 in TR 37.827. Based on this, it can be seen that:
\- IMD2, IMD4, and IMD5 products are produced by Band n2 and n77 that might
fall in Rx of band n66.
\- IMD2, IMD4, and IMD5 products are produced by Band n66 and n77 that might
fall in Rx of band n2
For the IMD products produced by Band n2 and n66 UL, the MSD values of the
corresponding PC3 CA case can be applied since this uplink configuration does
not support PC2.
#### 6.17.3.1 Power class 2 Case A
_The additional MSD due to intermodulation for PC2_ CA_n2-n66-n77 can be re-
used from PC2 _DC_29-66_n77 in TR 37.827 and are defined in Table 6.17.3.1-1._

### 6.18.3 REFSENS requirements
According to the PC3 CA_n5-n77 study captured in TR 38.716-02-00, the
following co-existence issues due to dual uplink can be identified as follows:
\- IMD5 products are produced by Band 5 and n77 that might fall in Rx of band
29.
There is no need to assess the IMD impact in other Rx bands since those cases
are covered in their corresponding fallbacks.

re-used from DC_29-66_n77 in TR 37.827. Based on this, it can be seen that:
\- IMD3 products are produced by Band n66 and n77 that might fall in Rx of
band n29.
#### 6.21.3.1 Power class 2 Case A
_The additional MSD due to intermodulation for PC2_ CA_n29-n66-n77 can be re-
used from PC2 _DC_29-66_n77 in TR 37.827 and are defined in Table 6.21.3.1-1._
