In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something

SRAP Sidelink Relay Adaptation Protocol
U2N UE-to-Network
# 4 General
## 4.1 Introduction
The objective is to describe the SRAP architecture and the SRAP entities from
a functional point of view.
## 4.2 SRAP architecture
### 4.2.1 General
This clause describes a model of the SRAP, i.e., it does not specify or
restrict implementations.
### 4.2.2 SRAP entities
Figure 4.2.2-1 represents one possible structure for the SRAP sublayer. The
figure is based on the radio interface protocol architecture defined in TS
38.300 [2].
Figure 4.2.2-1: SRAP structure overview
On the U2N Relay UE, the SRAP sublayer contains one SRAP entity at Uu
interface and a separate collocated SRAP entity at the PC5 interface. On the
U2N Remote UE, the SRAP sublayer contains only one SRAP entity at the PC5
interface.
Each SRAP entity has a transmitting part and a receiving part. Across the PC5
interface, the transmitting part of the SRAP entity at the U2N Remote UE has a
corresponding receiving part of an SRAP entity at the U2N Relay UE, and vice
versa. Across the Uu interface, the transmitting part of the SRAP entity at
the U2N Relay UE has a corresponding receiving part of an SRAP entity at the
gNB, and vice versa.
Figure 4.2.2-2 and Figure 4.2.2-3 represents the functional view of the SRAP
entity for the SRAP sublayer at PC5 interface and at Uu interface
respectively.
Figure 4.2.2-2: Example of functional view of SRAP sublayer at PC5 interface
Figure 4.2.2-3: Example of functional view of SRAP sublayer at Uu interface
In the example of Figure 4.2.2-2 and Figure 4.2.2-3, at relay UE:
\- For data packet not corresponding to SRB0, the receiving part on the SRAP
entity of Uu interface delivers SRAP Data PDUs to the transmitting part on the
collocated SRAP entity of PC5 interface, and the receiving part on the SRAP
entity of PC5 interface delivers SRAP Data PDUs to the transmitting part on
the collocated SRAP entity of Uu interface. As an alternative, the receiving
part may deliver SRAP SDUs to the transmitting part on the collocated SRAP
entity. When passing SRAP SDUs, the receiving part removes the SRAP header and
the transmitting part of the relay UE adds the SRAP header with the same SRAP
header content as carried on the SRAP Data PDU header prior to removal.
Passing SRAP SDUs in this manner is therefore functionally equivalent to
passing SRAP Data PDUs, in implementation. The following specification
therefore refers to the passing of SRAP data packets.
\- For UL data packet corresponding to SRB0, the receiving part on the SRAP
entity of PC5 interface delivers SRAP SDUs to the transmitting part on the
collocated SRAP entity of Uu interface, and the transmitting part on the SRAP
entity of Uu interface adds the SRAP header in accordance with clause 5.3.3.
\- For DL data packet corresponding to SRB0, the receiving part on the SRAP
entity of Uu interface delivers SRAP Data PDUs to the transmitting part on the
collocated SRAP entity of PC5 interface, and the transmitting part on the SRAP
entity of PC5 interface removes the SRAP header in accordance with clause
5.2.2. As an alternative for handling DL data packet corresponding to SRB0 not
shown in Figure 4.2.2-2 or Figure 4.2.2-3, the receiving part on the SRAP
entity of Uu interface removes the SRAP header and delivers SRAP SDUs to the
transmitting part on the collocated SRAP entity of PC5 interface.
## 4.3 Services
### 4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers
The following services are provided by the SRAP sublayer to upper layers:
\- Data transfer.
### 4.3.2 Services expected from lower layers
An SRAP sublayer expects the following services from lower layers per RLC
entity (for a detailed description see TS 38.322 [4]):
\- Acknowledged data transfer service;
\- Unacknowledged data transfer service.
## 4.4 Functions
The SRAP sublayer supports the following functions:
\- Data transfer;
\- Determination of UE ID field and BEARER ID field for data packets;
\- Determination of egress link;
\- Determination of egress RLC channel.
## 4.5 Configurations
The configuration of the SRAP entity for U2N Remote UE includes:
\- Mapping from a radio bearer identified by BEARER ID field to egress PC5
Relay RLC channel via RRC;
\- The local identity via RRC.
The configuration of the SRAP entity for U2N Relay UE includes:
\- The local identity for each U2N Remote UE via RRC;
\- Mapping from a radio bearer identified by UE ID field and BEARER ID field
to egress Uu Relay RLC channel for each U2N Remote UE via RRC;
