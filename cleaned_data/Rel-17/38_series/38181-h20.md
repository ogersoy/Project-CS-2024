# 4 General test conditions and declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in TS 38.181(the
present document), i.e. to all conducted tests defined in FR1 for _SAN type
1-H_ and radiated tests defined in FR1 for _SAN type 1-H_ and _SAN type 1-O_.
The frequency range FR1 is defined in clause 5.1 of TS 38.108 [2].
The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.108 [2]. Test Tolerances for the
conducted test requirements (TT) and test Tolerances for the radiated test
requirements (TT~OTA~) explicitly stated in the present document are given in
annex C of the present document.
The test tolerances for the radiated test requirements (TT~OTA~) for SAN were
reused from TR 37.941 [13]. Reuse of TR 37.941 [x] TT~OTA~ values for SAN LEO
radiated conformance testing is subject to the following conditions:
\- EUT suitability to fit OTA chambers considered in TR 37.941 [13], and
\- Environmental test conditions assumed for BS testing in TR 37.941 [13].
Reuse of TR 37.941 [13] TT~OTA~ values for SAN GEO radiated conformance
testing may not be justified for some products due to too large SAN GEO
antenna array dimensions, and required OTA RF chamber size.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. Test Tolerances are
used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.
The radiated requirements are classified according to spatial characteristics
as shown in table 4.1.1-1 and table 4.1.1-2.

### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
#### 4.1.2.1 General
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Conducted Test System and OTA Test
System are specified below for each test defined explicitly in the present
specification, where appropriate. The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the
Test System for test requirements included by reference is defined in the
respective referred test specification.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For conducted RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause
4.1.2 apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not
include system effects due to mismatch between the EUT and the Test System.
For details on measurement uncertainty budget calculation, measurement
methodology description (including calibration and measurement stage for each
test range), MU budget format and its contributions, refer to TR 37.941 [13],
where MU analyses for the BS radiated testing were captured. The maximum OTA
Test System uncertainty for FR1 OTA transmitter and receiver tests in tables
4.1.2.2-2 and 4.1.2.3-2 were reused from BS MU budgets in TR 37.941 [13].
Reuse of TR 37.941 [13] MU values for SAN LEO radiated conformance testing is
subject to the following conditions:
\- EUT suitability to fit OTA chambers considered in TR 37.941 [13], and
\- Environmental test conditions assumed for BS testing in TR 37.941 [13].
Reuse of TR 37.941 [13] TT~OTA~ values for SAN GEO radiated conformance
testing may not be justified for some products due to too large SAN GEO
antenna array dimensions, and required OTA RF chamber size.

The maximum conducted Test System uncertainty for conducted transmitter tests
minimum requirements is given in table 4.1.2.2-1. And the maximum OTA Test
System uncertainty for OTA transmitter tests minimum requirements is given in

Frequency error is the measure of the difference between the actual SAN
transmit frequency and the assigned frequency. The same source shall be used
for RF frequency and data clock generation.
It is not possible to verify by testing that the data clock is derived from
the same frequency source as used for RF generation. This may be confirmed by
the manufacturer\'s declaration.
For _SAN type 1-H_ this requirement shall be applied at each _TAB connector_
supporting transmission in the _operating band._
#### 6.5.2.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 [2], clause 6.5.1.2.
#### 6.5.2.3 Test purpose

### 6.5.3 Modulation quality
#### 6.5.3.1 Definition and applicability
Modulation quality is defined by the difference between the measured carrier
signal and an ideal signal. Modulation quality can e.g. be expressed as Error
Vector Magnitude (EVM). The Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the
difference between the ideal symbols and the measured symbols after the
equalization. This difference is called the error vector.
For _SAN type 1-H_ this requirement shall be applied at each _TAB connector_
supporting transmission in the _operating band._

supported by SAN with power back off, and NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.2 at maximum power,
or
\- NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.2 if highest modulation order supported by SAN is 16QAM, or
\- NR-SAN-FR1-TM3.3 if highest modulation order supported by SAN is QPSK.
For _TAB connector_ declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set the
_TAB connector_ under test to transmit according to the applicable test
configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses 4.7 and 4.8
using the corresponding test models on all carriers configured:

## 6.6 Unwanted emissions
### 6.6.1 General
Unwanted emissions consist of out-of-band emissions and spurious emissions
according to ITU definitions [4]. In ITU terminology, out of band emissions
are unwanted emissions immediately outside the _SAN channel bandwidth_
resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in the transmitter but
excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are emissions which are
caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics emission, parasitic
emission, intermodulation products and frequency conversion products, but
exclude out of band emissions.
The out-of-band emissions requirement for the SAN transmitter is specified
both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and out-of-band
emissions (OOBE). There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.
Table 6.6.1-1: Void
For _SAN type 1-H_ the unwanted emission requirements are applied to sum of
power over all _TAB connectors_ for all the configurations supported by the
SAN, except for occupied bandwidth in subclause 6.6.2.
### 6.6.2 Occupied bandwidth
#### 6.6.2.1 Definition and applicability
The occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below the
lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted are each
equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean transmitted power. See
also Recommendation ITU-R SM.328 [5].
The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.
The minimum requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also be
regional requirements to declare the occupied bandwidth according to the
definition in the present clause.
For SAN _type 1-H_ this requirement shall be applied at each _TAB connector_
supporting transmission in the _operating band._
#### 6.6.2.2 Minimum requirements
The minimum requirement for _SAN_ _type 1-H_ is defined in TS 38.108 [2]
clause 6.6.2.
#### 6.6.2.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify that the emission at the _TAB connector_ does
not occupy an excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided and is,
therefore, not likely to create interference to other users of the spectrum
beyond undue limits.
#### 6.6.2.4 Method of test
##### 6.6.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.
1) Connect the measurement device to the _TAB connector_ as shown in annex
D.1.1 for _SAN type 1-H_.
2) For a SAN declared to be capable of single carrier operation (D.39), start
transmission according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8
using the corresponding test model NR-SAN-FR1-TM1.1 at manufacturer\'s
declared _rated carrier output power per TAB connector_ (P~rated,c,TABC~,
D.34).
##### 6.6.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted signal using at least the
number of measurement points, and across a span, as listed in table
6.6.2.4.2-1. The selected resolution bandwidth (RBW) filter of the analyser
shall be 30 kHz or less.
Table 6.6.2.4.2-1: Span and number of measurement points for OBW measurements
+--------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----+-----+-----+ | Bandwidth | SAN channel bandwidth | | | | | | | | | | | | BW~Channel~ (MHz) | | | | +--------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----+-----+-----+ | | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | +--------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----+-----+-----+ | Span (MHz) | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | +--------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----+-----+-----+ | Minimum number of measurement points | 400 | 400 | 400 | 400 | +--------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----+-----+-----+
NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any effect on
the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW power are the same
as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected to have the Rayleigh
distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In any case where the
statistics are not the same, though, the detection mode must be power
responding. The analyser may be set to respond to the average of the power
(root-mean-square of the voltage) across the measurement cell.
2) Compute the total of the power, P0, (in power units, not decibel units) of
all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1, the power
outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the total power
outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied percentage)) of P0.
For the occupied percentage of 99 %, P1 is 0.005 times P0.
3) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds P1.
4) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all power in the
measurement cells from f2 to the end of the span exceeds P1.
5) Compute the occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.
#### 6.6.2.5 Test requirements
The occupied bandwidth for each carrier shall be less than the channel
bandwidth as defined in TS 38.108 [2], table 5.3.5-1 for _SAN type 1-H_.
### 6.6.3 Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)
#### 6.6.3.1 Definition and applicability
Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) is the ratio of the filtered mean
power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean power
centred on an adjacent channel frequency.
The requirements shall apply outside the Satellite Access Node RF Bandwidth or
Radio Bandwidth whatever the type of transmitter considered (e.g. single
carrier or multi-carrier) and for all transmission modes foreseen by the
manufacturer\'s specification.
#### 6.6.3.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement applies per _single-band connector_ supporting
transmission in the _operating band_.
The minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-H_ is defined in TS 38.108 [2], clause
6.6.3.4.
#### 6.6.3.3 Test purpose

tested one at a time or multiple _TAB connectors_ may be tested in parallel as
shown in annex D.1.1 for _SAN type 1-H_. Whichever method is used the
procedure is repeated until all _TAB connectors_ necessary to demonstrate
conformance have been tested.
1) Connect the _single-band connector_ or _multi-band connector_ under test to
measurement equipment as shown in annex D.1.1 for _SAN type 1-H_. All
connectors not under test shall be terminated.
The measurement device characteristics shall be:
\- Measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 6.6.3.5.
\- Detection mode: true RMS voltage or true average power.
> 2) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation only

> to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding
> test models NR-SAN-FR1‑TM 1.1 in clause 4.9.2 at _rated carrier output
> power_ P~rated,c,TABC~ for _SAN type 1-H_ (D.34).
For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation
set the connector under test to transmit on all carriers configured using the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in
clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models or set of physical
channels in clause 4.9.2.
3) Measure ACLR for the frequency offsets both side of channel frequency as
specified in table 6.6.3.5.2‑1. In multiple carrier case only offset
frequencies below the lowest and above the highest carrier frequency used
shall be measured.
4) Repeat the test with the channel set-up according to NR-SAN-FR1-TM 1.2 in
clause 4.9.2.
#### 6.6.3.5 Test requirements
##### 6.6.3.5.1 General requirements

transmission bandwidth configuration of the transmitted signal (BW~Config~)
centred on the assigned channel frequency and a filter centred on the adjacent
channel frequency according to the tables below.
The ACLR shall be higher than the value specified in Table 6.6.3.5.2-1/2.

### 6.6.4 Out-of-band emissions
#### 6.6.4.1 Definition and applicability
Unless otherwise stated, the out-of-band emission (OOBE) limits for SAN in FR1
are defined from BW~SAN~ channel edge up to frequencies separated from the
BW~SAN~ channel edge by 200% of the necessary bandwidth.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification.
_Basic limits_ are specified in the tables below, where:
\- ∆f is the separation between the BW~SAN~ _channel edge_ frequency and the
nominal -3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the _channel edge_ frequency and the
centre of the measuring filter.
\- PSD~Channel~ [dBm/4kHz] represents the Power Spectral Density of the
channel(s) operating in BW~SAN.~
\- BW~SAN~ [MHz] is the considered SAN transponder bandwidth.
\- $\Delta_{Sat_ Class}\left\lbrack \text{dB} \right\rbrack$ is the _SAN class
parameter_ in dB identified to characterize different SAN classes.
#### 6.6.4.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement applies per _single-band connector_ supporting
transmission in the _operating band_.
The minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-H_ is defined in TS 38.108 [2], clause
6.6.4.2.
#### 6.6.4.3 Test purpose
This test measures the emissions close to the assigned channel bandwidth of
the wanted signal, while the transmitter is in operation.
#### 6.6.4.4 Method of test
##### 6.6.4.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see clause 4.9.1.
_SAN RF Bandwidth_ positions to be tested for multi-carrier: B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation; see clause 4.9.1.
##### 6.6.4.4.2 Procedure
For _SAN type 1-H_ where there may be multiple _TAB connectors_ , they may be
tested one at a time or multiple _TAB connectors_ may be tested in parallel as
shown in annex D.1.1. Whichever method is used the procedure is repeated until
all _TAB connectors_ necessary to demonstrate conformance have been tested.
1) Connect the _single-band connector_ under test to measurement equipment as
shown in annex D.1.1. All connectors not under test shall be terminated.
As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should
be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result
should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
The measurement device characteristics shall be: Detection mode: True RMS.
The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to
ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in table
4.1.2.2-1.
2) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation only,
set the representative connectors under test to transmit according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at manufacturer\'s declared _rated
carrier output power per TAB connector_ (P~rated,c,TABC~, D.34). Channel set-
up shall be according to NR-SAN-FR1-TM 1.1.
For a connector under test declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation
set the connector under test to transmit on all carriers configured using the
applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in
clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models or set of physical
channels in clause 4.9.2.
3) Step the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps and
measure the emission within the specified frequency ranges with the specified
measurement bandwidth.
4) Repeat the test for the remaining test cases, with the channel set-up
according to NR-SAN-FR1-TM 1.2.
#### 6.6.4.5 Test requirements
For SAN operating in Bands n256, n255, the out-of-band emissions (OOBE)
requirements for GEO and LEO classes are defined as described in table
6.6.4.5‑1, in line with Annex 5 of ITU recommendation SM.1541-6 [6].

4.1.2.2-1.
3) For a connectors declared to be capable of single carrier operation only
(D.39), set the representative connectors under test to transmit according to
the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 at _rated carrier output
power_ (P~rated,c,TABC~, D.34). Channel set-up shall be according to NR-FR1-TM

### 8.2.3 Performance requirements for UL timing adjustment
#### 8.2.3.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of UL timing adjustment is determined by a minimum
required throughput measured for the moving UE at given SNR. The performance
requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.
In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one being
transmitted by a moving UE and the other being transmitted by a stationary UE.
The transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC parameters in Table A.3-1 are
applied for both UEs. The received power for both UEs is the same. The
resource blocks allocated for both UEs are consecutive.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.
#### 8.2.3.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 [2] clause 8.2.3.
#### 8.2.3.3 Test Purpose
The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput measured
for the moving UE at given SNR under moving propagation conditions.
#### 8.2.3.4 Method of test
##### 8.2.3.4.1 Initial Conditions
Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested: M; see clause 4.9.1.
##### 8.2.3.4.2 Procedure
1) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.6 for SAN _type 1-H_.
2) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to combination of SCS and channel
bandwidth defined in table 8.2.3.4.2-1.
Table 8.2.3.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the SAN input
Sub-carrier spacing (kHz) Channel bandwidth (MHz) AWGN power level
* * *
15 5 -86.5 dBm / 4.5MHz 30 10 -83.6 dBm / 8.64MHz NOTE: The AWGN power level
contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the
AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to
16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it
reduces the effective base band SNR level.
3) The characteristics of the wanted signals (transmitted by moving UE) shall
be configured according to the corresponding UL reference measurement channel

## 8.3 Performance requirements for PUCCH
### 8.3.1 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0
#### 8.3.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of single user PUCCH format 0 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection
of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The
probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.
The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.
The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 [12] clause 6.3.3 is not
taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping
is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.
#### 8.3.1.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirements are in TS 38.108 [2] clause 8.3.1 and 8.3.2.
#### 8.3.1.3 Test purpose
The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK under multipath
fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.
#### 8.3.1.4 Method of test

**Subcarrier spacing (kHz)** **Channel bandwidth (MHz)** **AWGN power level**
15 5 -83.5 dBm / 4.5 MHz 30 10 -80.6 dBm / 8.64 MHz NOTE: The AWGN power level
contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the
AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to
16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it
reduces the effective base band SNR level.
* * *

### 8.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1
#### 8.3.2.1 NACK to ACK detection
##### 8.3.2.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection is
determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK
and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection equal to 0.1% or
less. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular bit position when
input is only noise. Each false bit detection is counted as one error.
The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an ACK
bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK bit
erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously detected
NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are mapped from
DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be considered.
The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 [12] clause 6.3.3 is not
taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping
is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.
##### 8.3.2.1.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 [2] clause 8.3.3.
##### 8.3.2.1.3 Test purpose
The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK bits
as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test
purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the
range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the
test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.

#### 8.3.2.2 ACK missed detection
##### 8.3.2.2.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection is
determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK
and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of
false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.
The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.
The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 [12] clause 6.3.3 is not
taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping
is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.
##### 8.3.2.2.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 [2] clause 8.3.3.
##### 8.3.2.2.3 Test purpose
The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect ACK bits under
multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.
##### 8.3.2.2.4 Method of test
###### 8.3.2.2.4.1 Initial Conditions
Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.
###### 8.3.2.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.6 for _SAN type 1-H_.
2) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the subcarrier spacing and channel
bandwidth defined in table 8.3.2.2.4.2-1.

* * *
**Sub-carrier spacing (kHz)** **Channel bandwidth (MHz)** **AWGN power level**
15 kHz 5 -83.5 dBm / 4.5 MHz 30 kHz 10 -80.6 dBm / 8.64 MHz NOTE: The AWGN
power level contains an AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test
purposes, the AWGN level can be reduced from the default by any value in the
range 0dB to 16dB. Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the
test, as it reduces the effective base band SNR level.
* * *

6) The signal generator sends random codewords from applicable codebook, in
regular time periods. The following statistics are kept: the number of ACK
bits falsely detected in the idle periods and the number of missed ACK bits.
Each falsely detected ACK bit in the idle periods is accounted as one error
for the statistics of false ACK detection, and each missed ACK bit is
accounted as one error for the statistics of missed ACK detection.
Note that the procedure described in this clause for ACK missed detection has
the same condition as that described in clause 8.3.2.1.4.2 for NACK to ACK
detection. Both statistics are measured in the same testing.
##### 8.3.2.2.5 Test Requirement

### 8.3.6 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH
#### 8.3.6.1 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH format 1
##### 8.3.6.1.1 NACK to ACK detection
###### 8.3.6.1.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of multi-slot PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection
of the ACK and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection equal
to 0.1 % or less. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 1 %
or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular bit position when
input is only noise. Each false bit detection is counted as one error.
The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an ACK
bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK bit
erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously detected
NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are mapped from
DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be considered.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.
###### 8.3.6.1.1.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 [2] clause 8.3.7.
###### 8.3.6.1.1.3 Test purpose

##### 8.3.6.1.2 ACK missed detection
###### 8.3.6.1.2.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection is

and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of

1) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in annex D.6 for _SAN type 1-H_
respectively.
2) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the combinations of SCS and channel
bandwidth defined in table 8.3.6.1.2.4.2-1.

5) Adjusting the equipment so that the SNR specified in table 8.3.6.1.2.5-1
and table 8.3.6.1.2.5-2 is achieved at the SAN input during the transmissions.
6) The signal generator sends random codewords from applicable codebook, in
regular time periods. The following statistics are kept: the number of ACK
bits falsely detected in the idle periods and the number of missed ACK bits.
Each falsely detected ACK bit in the idle periods is accounted as one error
for the statistics of false ACK detection, and each missed ACK bit is
accounted as one error for the statistics of missed ACK detection.

## 8.4 Performance requirements for PRACH
### 8.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection
#### 8.4.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is determined by
the two parameters: total probability of false detection of the preamble (Pfa)
and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd). The performance is measured
by the required SNR at probability of detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1%
or less.
Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of
the preamble (i.e., erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only
noise.
Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble when the
signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several error cases --
detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that was sent, not detecting
any preamble at all, or detecting the correct preamble but with the out-of-
bounds timing estimation value.
For AWGN and NTN-TDLA100-200, a timing estimation error occurs if the
estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is larger than the time
error tolerance values given in table 8.4.1.1-1.
Table 8.4.1.1-1: Time error tolerance for AWGN and NTN-TDLA100-200

us 0.81 us 30 0.26 us 0.55 us
* * *
The test preambles for normal mode are listed in table A.4-1.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 8.1.2.
#### 8.4.1.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 [2] clause 8.4.1.2.
#### 8.4.1.3 Test purpose
The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect PRACH preamble under
static conditions and multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.
#### 8.4.1.4 Method of test
##### 8.4.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal, see Annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested: for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.
##### 8.4.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Connect the BS tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to all SAN TAB connectors for diversity
reception via a combining network as shown in D.6 for _SAN_ _type 1-H_.
2) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the SCS and channel bandwidth.
Table 8.4.1.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the SAN input
* * *
Sub-carrier spacing (kHz) Channel bandwidth (MHz) AWGN power level 15 5 -83.5
dBm / 4.5MHz 30 10 -80.6 dBm / 8.64MHz NOTE: The AWGN power level contains an
AWGN offset of 16dB by default. If needed for test purposes, the AWGN level
can be reduced from the default by any value in the range 0dB to 16dB.
Changing the AWGN level does not impact the validity of the test, as it
reduces the effective base band SNR level.
* * *
3) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to
the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A and the
test parameter _msg1-FrequencyStart_ is set to 0.
4) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex G.
5) Adjust the frequency offset of the test signal according to table 8.4.1.5-1
or 8.4.1.5-2 or 8.4.1.5-3.
6) Adjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in table 8.4.1.5-1 or
8.4.1.5-2 or 8.4.1.5-3 is achieved at the SAN input during the PRACH
preambles.
7) The test signal generator sends a preamble, and the receiver tries to
detect the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure
8.4.1.4.2-1. The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets as described
below. The following statistics are kept: the number of preambles detected in
the idle period and the number of missed preambles.
Figure 8.4.1.4.2-1: PRACH preamble test pattern
The timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format 0 is set to 50% of Ncs.
This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of
0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.9us. Then the loop is
being reset and the timing offset is set again to 50% of Ncs. The timing
offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 and format 2 is presented in figure
8.4.1.4.2-2.
Figure 8.4.1.4.2-2: Timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 and
format 2
The timing offset base value for PRACH preamble format B4 and C2 is set to 0.
This offset is increased within the loop, by adding in each step a value of
0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which is 0.8 us. Then the loop is
being reset and the timing offset is set again to 0. The timing offset scheme
for PRACH preamble format B4 and C2 is presented in figure 8.4.1.4.2-3.

# 9 Radiated transmitter characteristics
## 9.1 General
General test conditions for transmitter tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. SAN
configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.
If beams have been declared equivalent and parallel (D.13, D.14), only a
representative beam is necessary to be tested to demonstrate conformance.
## 9.2 Radiated transmit power
### 9.2.1 Definition and applicability
Radiated transmit power is defined as the EIRP level for a declared beam at a
specific _beam peak direction_.
For each declared beam, the requirement is based on declarations given in
clause 4.6 for a beam identifier (D.3), _reference beam direction pair_ (D.8),
_rated beam EIRP_ (D.11) at the beam\'s reference direction pair, _OTA peak
directions set_ (D.9), the _beam direction pairs_ at the maximum steering
directions (D.10) and their associated _rated beam EIRP_ and _beam width(s)_
for reference _beam direction pair_ and maximum steering directions (D.12).
For a declared beam identifier and _beam direction pair_ , the _rated beam
EIRP_ level is the maximum power that the SAN is declared to radiate at the
associated _beam peak direction._
For each _beam peak direction_ associated with a _beam direction pair_ within
the _OTA peak directions set_ , a specific _rated beam EIRP_ level may be
claimed. Any claimed value shall be met within the accuracy requirement as
described below. _Rated beam EIRP_ is only required to be declared for the
_beam direction pairs_ subject to conformance testing as detailed in clause
9.2.4.1.
NOTE 1: The _OTA peak directions set_ for a beam is the complete continuous or
discrete set of all _beam direction_ for which the EIRP requirement is
achieved for the beam.
NOTE 2: A beam direction pair consists of a beam centre direction and an
associated beam peak direction.
Radiated transmit power is directional requirement applicable to SAN type 1-H
and SAN type 1-O.
### 9.2.2 Minimum requirement
Radiated transmit power minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-H_ and _SAN type
1-O_ is defined in TS 38.108 [2], clause 9.2.2.
### 9.2.3 Test purpose

## 9.7 OTA unwanted emissions
### 9.7.1 General
Unwanted emissions consist of so-called out-of-band emissions and spurious
emissions according to ITU definitions ITU-R SM.329 [4]. In ITU terminology,
out of band emissions are unwanted emissions immediately outside the _SAN
channel bandwidth_ resulting from the modulation process and non-linearity in
the transmitter but excluding spurious emissions. Spurious emissions are
emissions which are caused by unwanted transmitter effects such as harmonics
emission, parasitic emission, intermodulation products and frequency
conversion products, but exclude out of band emissions.
The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for the _SAN type 1-O_ is specified
both in terms of Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (ACLR) and out-of-band
emissions (OOBE). The maximum offset of the operating band unwanted emissions
mask from the _operating band_ edge is Δf~OBUE~. The value of Δf~OBUE~ is
defined in table 9.7.1-1 for _SAN type 1-O_ for the SAN _operating bands_.
Table 9.7.1-1: Void
The unwanted emission requirements are applied per cell for all the
configurations. Requirements for OTA unwanted emissions are captured using
TRP, or _directional requirements_ as described per requirement.
For the OTA TRP measurement procedures, refer to TS 38.141-2 [18], annex I.
There is in addition a requirement for occupied bandwidth.
### 9.7.2 OTA occupied bandwidth
#### 9.7.2.1 General
The OTA occupied bandwidth is the width of a frequency band such that, below
the lower and above the upper frequency limits, the mean powers emitted are
each equal to a specified percentage β/2 of the total mean transmitted power.
See also recommendation ITU-R SM.328 [5].
The value of β/2 shall be taken as 0.5%.
The minimum requirement below may be applied regionally. There may also be
regional requirements to declare the OTA occupied bandwidth according to the
definition in the present clause.
The OTA occupied bandwidth is defined as a _directional requirement_ and shall
be met in the manufacturer\'s declared _OTA coverage range_ at the RIB.
#### 9.7.2.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-O_ is defined in TS 38.108 [2], clause
9.7.2.2.
#### 9.7.2.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify that the emission at the _RIB_ does not occupy
an excessive bandwidth for the service to be provided and is, therefore, not
likely to create interference to other users of the spectrum beyond undue
limits.
#### 9.7.2.4 Method of test
##### 9.7.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal, see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.
Directions to be tested: OTA coverage range reference direction (D.30).
Beams to be tested: Declared beam with the highest intended EIRP for the
narrowest intended beam corresponding to the smallest BeWθ, or for the
narrowest intended beam corresponding to the smallest BeWϕ (D.3, D.11).
For SAN declared to be capable of single carrier operation, start transmission
according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test model NR-SAN-FR1-TM1.1 for _SAN type 1-O_ in clause 4.9.2
at manufacturers declared rated carrier EIRP (P~rated,c,EIRP~, D.11).
##### 9.7.2.4.2 Procedure
1) Place the SAN at the positioner.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2) of the
SAN with the test system.
3) Orient the positioner (and SAN) in order that the direction to be tested
aligns with the test antenna.
4) Configure the beam peak direction of the SAN according to the declared beam
direction pair.
5) Set the SAN to transmit signal.
6) Measure the spectrum emission of the transmitted signal using at least the
number of measurement points, and across a span, as listed in table
9.7.2.4.2-1. The selected resolution bandwidth (RBW) filter of the analyser
shall be 30 kHz or less.
NOTE: The detection mode of the spectrum analyzer will not have any effect on
the result if the statistical properties of the out-of-OBW power are the same
as those of the inside-OBW power. Both are expected to have the Rayleigh
distribution of the amplitude of Gaussian noise. In any case where the
statistics are not the same, though, the detection mode is power responding.
There are at least two ways to be power responding. The spectrum analyser can
be set to \"sample\" detection, with its video bandwidth setting at least
three times its RBW setting. Or the analyser may be set to respond to the
average of the power (root-mean-square of the voltage) across the measurement
cell.
Table 9.7.2.4.2-1: Span and number of measurement points for OBW measurements
for FR1
+--------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----+-----+-----+ | Bandwidth | SAN channel bandwidth | | | | | | | | | | | | BW~Channel~ (MHz) | | | | +======================================+=======================+=====+=====+=====+ | | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | +--------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----+-----+-----+ | Span (MHz) | 10 | 20 | 30 | 40 | +--------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----+-----+-----+ | Minimum number of measurement points | 400 | 400 | 400 | 400 | +--------------------------------------+-----------------------+-----+-----+-----+
7) Compute the total of the EIRP, P0, (in power units, not decibel units) of
all the measurement cells in the measurement span. Compute P1, the EIRP
outside the occupied bandwidth on each side. P1 is half of the total EIRP
outside the bandwidth. P1 is half of (100 % - (occupied percentage)) of P0.
Measure the EIRP for any two orthogonal polarizations (denoted p1 and p2) and
calculate total radiated transmit power for particular _beam direction pair_
as EIRP = EIRP~p1~ + EIRP~p2~.
8) Determine the lowest frequency, f1, for which the sum of all EIRP in the
measurement cells from the beginning of the span to f1 exceeds P1.
9) Determine the highest frequency, f2, for which the sum of all EIRP in the
measurement cells from the end of the span to f2 exceeds P1.
10) Compute the OTA occupied bandwidth as f2 - f1.
#### 9.7.2.5 Test requirement
The OTA occupied bandwidth for each NR carrier shall be less than the channel
bandwidth as defined in TS 38.108 [2], table 5.3.5-1.
### 9.7.3 OTA Adjacent Channel Leakage Power Ratio (ACLR)
#### 9.7.3.1 Definition and applicability

mean power centred on the assigned channel frequency to the filtered mean
power centred on an adjacent channel frequency. The measured power is TRP.
The requirement shall be applied per RIB.
For a _RIB_ operating in multi-carrier, the OTA ACLR requirements in clause

T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1.
Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s) may be
set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see TS 38.141-2 [18], annex
I) as long as the required TRP level is achieved.
##### 9.7.3.4.2 Procedure
The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional power
measurements as described in TS 38.141-2 [18], annex I. An alternative method
to measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber
if so follow steps 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 10, and 11.
1) Place the SAN at the positioner.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2) of the
SAN with the test system.
3) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:
\- Measurement filter bandwidth: defined in clause 9.7.3.5.
\- Detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.
\- The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to
ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in table
4.1.2.2-2.
4) For single carrier operation, set the SAN to transmit according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test
model(s) in clause 4.9.2 at manufacturers declared _rated carrier TRP output
power_ declared per RIB (P~rated,c,TRP~).
For SAN declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation use the applicable
test signal configuration and corresponding power setting specified in clauses
4.7.2 and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in clause 4.9.2 on all
carriers configured.
5) Orient the positioner (and SAN) in order that the direction to be tested
aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP can be
performed (see TS 38.141-2 [18], annex I).

channel frequency and the absolute TRP of the adjacent frequency channel.
NOTE 2: For FR1 the measurement uncertainty of the reverberation chamber for
the relative ACLR is higher than the measurement uncertainty in clause 4.1.2

### 9.7.4 OTA out-of-band emissions
#### 9.7.4.1 Definition and applicability
The OTA limits for out-of-band emissions are specified as TRP per RIB unless
otherwise stated.
For a _RIB_ operating in multi-carrier, the requirements apply to  _SAN
channel bandwidths_ of the outermost carrier.
#### 9.7.4.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-O_ is defined in TS 38.108 [2], clause
9.7.4.2.
#### 9.7.4.3 Test purpose
This test measures the emissions of the SAN, close to the assigned channel
bandwidth of the wanted signal, while the SAN is in operation.
#### 9.7.4.4 Method of test
##### 9.7.4.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: B, M and T; see clause 4.9.1.
_SAN RF bandwidth_ positions to be tested for multi-carrier: B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~
and T~RFBW~ in single-band operation, see clause 4.9.1.
Directions to be tested: As the requirement is TRP the beam pattern(s) may be
set up to optimise the TRP measurement procedure (see TS 38.141-2 [18], annex
I) as long as the required TRP level is achieved.
##### 9.7.4.4.2 Procedure
The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on the directional power
measurements as described in TS 38.141-2 [18], annex I. An alternative method
to measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber
if so follow steps 1, 3, 4, 6.
1) Place the SAN at the positioner.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2) of the
SAN with the test system.
3) The measurement devices characteristics shall be:
\- Measurement filter bandwidth: as defined in clause 6.7.4.5.
\- Detection mode: true RMS voltage or true power averaging.
As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should
be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result
should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
The emission power should be averaged over an appropriate time duration to
ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in table
4.1.2.2-2.
4) For single carrier operation, set the SAN to transmit according to the
applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding test
model(s) in clause [4.9.2] at manufacturers declared _rated carrier TRP output
power_ declared per RIB (P~rated,c,TRP~).
For a SAN declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, use the
applicable test signal configuration and corresponding power setting specified
in clause [4.7.2] and 4.8 using the corresponding test model(s) in clause
4.9.2 on all carriers configured.
5) Orient the positioner (and SAN) in order that the direction to be tested
aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP can be
performed (see TS 38.141-2 [18], annex I).
6) Sweep the centre frequency of the measurement filter in contiguous steps
and measure emission power within the specified frequency ranges with the
specified measurement bandwidth.
7) Repeat step 5-6 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement grid
needed for TRP~Estimate~ (see TS 38.141-2 [18], annex I).
8) Calculate TRP~Estimate~ using the measurements made in step 6.
#### 9.7.4.5 Test requirements
The OTA out-of-band emissions requirement for _SAN type 1-O_ shall not exceed
each applicable limit in 9.7.4.2 of TS 38.108[2].
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification. For
a _RIB_ operating in multi-carrier, the requirements apply to  _SAN channel
bandwidths_ of the outermost carrier for the frequency ranges defined in
clause 6.6.4.1.
For a multi-carrier _single-band RIB_ the definitions above apply to the lower
edge of the carrier transmitted at the lowest carrier frequency and the upper
edge of the carrier transmitted at the highest carrier frequency within a
specified frequency band.
### 9.7.5 OTA transmitter spurious emissions
#### 9.7.5.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, all requirements are measured as mean power.
The OTA transmitter spurious emissions limits are specified as TRP per RIB,
unless otherwise stated.
The OTA transmitter spurious emission limits for FR1 shall apply from 30 MHz
to 11 GHz, excluding the _SAN transponder bandwidth_ BW~SAN~ and the frequency
range where the out-of-band emissions apply.
The lower limit and upper limit are as per ITU-R recommendation SM.329, Table
1: For systems operating within 600 MHz and 5.2 GHz, the lower limit is 30 MHz
and the upper limit is the 5^th^ harmonic of the higher frequency.
The lower limit of 30 MHz can be replaced as per ITU-R SM.329-12: Systems
having an integral antenna incorporating a waveguide section, or with an
antenna connection in such form, and of unperturbed length equal to at least
twice the cut-off wavelength, do not require spurious domain emission
measurements below 0.7 times the waveguide cut-off frequency.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered
(single carrier or multi-carrier). It applies for all transmission modes
foreseen by the manufacturer\'s specification.
_SAN type 1-O_ requirements consists of OTA transmitter spurious emission
requirements based on TRP.
#### 9.7.5.2 General OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements
##### 9.7.5.2.1 Definition and applicability
The general OTA transmitter spurious emissions requirements are specified as
TRP per RIB, per cell, unless otherwise specified.
##### 9.7.5.2.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for _SAN type 1-O_ is specified in TS 38.108 [2],
clause 9.7.5.2.2.
##### 9.7.5.2.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify if the radiated spurious emissions from the SAN
at the RIB are within the specified minimum requirements.

I) as long as the required TRP level is achieved.
###### 9.7.5.2.4.2 Procedure
The following procedure for measuring TRP is based on directional power
measurements as described in TS 38.141-2 [18], annex I. An alternative method
to measure TRP is to use a characterized and calibrated reverberation chamber
if so follow steps 1, 3, 4, 5, 7.
1) Place the SAN at the positioner.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation (D.2) of the

ensure the measurement is within the measurement uncertainty in Table
4.1.2.2-2.
5) Set the SAN to transmit:

RIB to transmit a signal according to the applicable test configuration in
clause 4.8 using the corresponding test model in clause 4.9.2 (i.e. NR-SAN-
FR1-TM1.1 for _SAN type 1-O_), at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power
P~rated,c,TRP~.
\- For a RIB declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation, set the RIB to
transmit according to the corresponding test model in clause 4.9.2 on all
carriers configured using the applicable test configuration and corresponding
power setting specified in clause 4.7.2 and 4.8.
6) Orient the positioner (and SAN) in order that the direction to be tested
aligns with the test antenna such that measurements to determine TRP can be
performed (see TS 38.141-2 [18], annex I).
7) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth.
8) Repeat step 6-7 for all directions in the appropriated TRP measurement grid
needed for full TRP estimation (see TS 38.141-2 [18], annex I).
NOTE 1: The TRP measurement grid may not be the same for all measurement
frequencies.
NOTE 2: The frequency sweep or the TRP measurement grid sweep may be done in
any order.
9) Calculate TRP at each specified frequency using the directional
measurements.

## 9.8 OTA transmitter intermodulation
The requirement is not applicable in this version of the specification.
# 10 Radiated receiver characteristic
## 10.1 General
General test conditions for receiver tests are given in clause 4, including
interpretation of measurement results and configurations for testing. SAN
configurations for the tests are defined in clause 4.5.
Radiated receiver characteristics are specified at RIB for _SAN type 1-H or_
_SAN type 1-O_ , with full complement of transceivers for the configuration in
normal operating condition.
Unless otherwise stated, the following arrangements apply for the radiated
receiver characteristics requirements in clause 10:
\- Requirements shall be met for any transmitter setting.
\- The requirements shall be met with the transmitter unit(s) ON.
\- Throughput requirements defined for the radiated receiver characteristics
do not assume HARQ retransmissions.
\- When SAN is configured to receive multiple carriers, all the throughput
requirements are applicable for each received carrier.
\- For ACS and blocking characteristics, the negative offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the lower _SAN RF Bandwidth_ edge, and
the positive offsets of the interfering signal apply relative to the upper
_SAN RF Bandwidth_ edge.
\- Each requirement shall be met over the RoAoA specified.
NOTE 1: In normal operating condition the SAN in FDD operation is configured
to transmit and receive at the same time.
For FR1 requirements which are to be met over the _OTA REFSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 44.1 - 10*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB for the
reference direction
and
Δ~OTAREFSENS~ = 41.1 - 10*log~10~(BeW~θ,REFSENS*~BeW~φ,REFSENS~) dB for all
other directions
For requirements which are to be met over the _minSENS RoAoA_ absolute
requirement values are offset by the following term:
Δ~minSENS~ = P~REFSENS~ -- EIS~minSENS~ (dB)
## 10.2 OTA sensitivity
### 10.2.1 Definition and applicability
The OTA sensitivity requirement is a _directional requirement_ based upon the
declaration of one or more _OTA sensitivity direction declarations_ (OSDD),
related to a _SAN type 1-H_ and _SAN type 1-O_ receiver.
The _SAN type 1-H_ and _SAN type 1-O_ may optionally be capable of
redirecting/changing the _receiver target_ by means of adjusting SAN settings
resulting in multiple _sensitivity RoAoA_. The _sensitivity RoAoA_ resulting
from the current SAN settings is the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
If the SAN is capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the OSDD
then the OSDD shall include:
\- _SAN channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level applicable to any
active _sensitivity RoAoA_ inside the _receiver target redirection range_ in
the OSDD.
\- A declared _receiver target redirection range_ , describing all the angles
of arrival that can be addressed for the OSDD through alternative settings in
the SAN.
\- Five declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ comprising the conformance testing
directions as detailed in TR 37. 941 [13].
> \- The _receiver target reference direction_.
NOTE 1: Some of the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ may coincide depending on the
redirection capability.
NOTE 2: In addition to the declared _sensitivity RoAoA_ , several _sensitivity
RoAoA_ may be implicitly defined by the _receiver target redirection range_
without being explicitly declared in the OSDD.
If the SAN is not capable of redirecting the _receiver target_ related to the
OSDD, then the OSDD includes only:
\- The set(s) of RAT, _SAN channel bandwidth_ and declared minimum EIS level
applicable to the _sensitivity RoAoA_ in the OSDD.
\- One declared active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
\- The _receiver target reference direction_.
> NOTE 4: For SAN without target redirection capability, the declared (fixed)
> _sensitivity RoAoA_ is always the active _sensitivity RoAoA_.
The OTA sensitivity EIS level declaration shall apply to each supported
polarization, under the assumption of _polarization match_.
### 10.2.2 Minimum requirement
For a received signal whose AoA of the incident wave is within the active
_sensitivity RoAoA_ of an OSDD, the error rate criterion as described in TS
38.108 [2] clause 10.2.2 shall be met when the level of the arriving signal is
equal to the minimum EIS level in the respective declared set of EIS level and
_SAN channel bandwidth_.

for a specified measurement channel at the EIS level and the range of angles
of arrival declared in the OSDD.

band as the OSDD being tested according to the appropriate test configuration
in clauses 4.7 and 4.8.
7) Start the signal generator for the wanted signal to transmit:
\- The test signal as specified in clause 10.2.5.
8) Set the test signal mean power so the calibrated radiated power at the SAN
Antenna Array coordinate system reference point is as specified in clause
10.2.5.
9) Measure the throughput according to annex A.1 for each supported
polarization.
10) Repeat steps 3 to 9 for all OSDD(s) declared for the SAN (D.19), and
supported polarizations.
### 10.2.5 Test requirements
#### 10.2.5.1 General
The minimum EIS level is a declared figure (D.23) for each OSDD (D.19). The
test requirement is calculated from the declared value offset by the EIS Test
Tolerance specified in clause 4.1.

, then radiated performance requirements can be tested for up to two
_demodulation branches_ (i.e. 1RX or 2RX test setups). When tested for two
_demodulation branches_ , each demodulation branch maps to one polarization.
If the _SAN type 1-O_ does not use polarization diversity then radiated
performance requirements can only be tested for a single _demodulation branch_
(i.e. 1RX test setup).

### 11.2.3 Performance requirements for UL timing adjustment
#### 11.2.3.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of UL timing adjustment is determined by a minimum
required throughput measured for the moving UE at given SNR. The performance
requirements assume HARQ retransmissions.
In the tests for UL timing adjustment, two signals are configured, one being
transmitted by a moving UE and the other being transmitted by a stationary UE.
The transmission of SRS from UE is optional. FRC parameters in Table A.3-3 are
applied for both UEs. The received power for both UEs is the same. The
resource blocks allocated for both UEs are consecutive.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.
#### 11.2.3.2 Minimum Requirement
For _SAN type 1-O_ , the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 [2] clause
11.2.3.
#### 11.2.3.3 Test Purpose
The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to achieve throughput measured
for the moving UE at given SNR under moving propagation conditions.

### 11.2.4 Performance requirements for PUSCH repetition Type A
#### 11.2.4.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUSCH with slot aggregation factor configured
is determined by a maximum target BLER for a given SNR. The required BLER is
defined as the probability of incorrectly decoding the PUSCH information when
the PUSCH information is sent for the FRCs listed in annex A. The performance
requirements assume HARQ re-transmissions.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.
#### 11.2.4.2 Minimum Requirement
For _SAN type 1-O_ , the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 [2] clause
11.2.4.

## 11.3 OTA performance requirements for PUCCH
### 11.3.1 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 0
#### 11.3.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of single user PUCCH format 0 for ACK missed
detection is determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection
of the ACK and the probability of detection of ACK. The performance is
measured by the required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The
probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.
The probability of detection of ACK is defined as conditional probability of
detection of the ACK when the signal is present.
The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 [12] clause 6.3.3 is not
taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping
is symmetric to the CC center, i.e. intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.
#### 11.3.1.2 Minimum Requirement
For _SAN type 1-O_ , the minimum requirements are in TS 38.108 [2] clause
11.3.1.1 and 11.3.1.2.
#### 11.3.1.3 Test purpose

### 11.3.2 Performance requirements for PUCCH format 1
#### 11.3.2.1 NACK to ACK detection
##### 11.3.2.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection is
determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK
and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection equal to 0.1% or
less. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular bit position when
input is only noise. Each false bit detection is counted as one error.
The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an ACK
bit when a NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK bit
erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously detected
NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are mapped from
DTX, i.e., NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be considered.
The transient period as specified in TS 38.101-5 [12] clause 6.3.3 is not
taken into account for performance requirement testing, where the RB hopping
is symmetric to the CC center, i.e., intra-slot frequency hopping is enabled.

### 11.3.6 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH format
#### 11.3.6.1 Performance requirements for multi-slot PUCCH format 1
##### 11.3.6.1.1 NACK to ACK detection
###### 11.3.6.1.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for NACK to ACK detection is
determined by the two parameters: probability of false detection of the ACK
and the NACK to ACK detection probability. The performance is measured by the
required SNR at probability of the NACK to ACK detection equal to 0.1% or
less. The probability of false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK at particular bit position when
input is only noise. Each false bit detection is counted as one error.
The NACK to ACK detection probability is the probability of detecting an ACK
bit when an NACK bit was sent on particular bit position. Each NACK bit
erroneously detected as ACK bit is counted as one error. Erroneously detected
NACK bits in the definition do not contain the NACK bits which are mapped from
DTX, i.e. NACK bits received when DTX is sent should not be considered.
Which specific test(s) are applicable to SAN is based on the test
applicability rules defined in clause 11.1.3.
###### 11.3.6.1.1.2 Minimum Requirement
For _SAN type 1-O_ , the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 [2], clause

###### 11.3.6.1.1.3 Test purpose
The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability not to falsely detect NACK bits
as ACK bits under multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.

###### 11.3.6.1.2.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PUCCH format 1 for ACK missed detection is

required SNR at probability of detection equal to 0.99. The probability of
false detection of the ACK shall be 0.01 or less.
The probability of false detection of the ACK is defined as a conditional
probability of erroneous detection of the ACK when input is only noise.

## 11.4 OTA performance requirements for PRACH
### 11.4.1 PRACH false alarm probability and missed detection
#### 11.4.1.1 Definition and applicability
The performance requirement of PRACH for preamble detection is determined by
the two parameters: total probability of false detection of the preamble (Pfa)
and the probability of detection of preamble (Pd). The performance is measured
by the required SNR at probability of detection, Pd of 99%. Pfa shall be 0.1%
or less.
Pfa is defined as a conditional total probability of erroneous detection of
the preamble (i.e. erroneous detection from any detector) when input is only
noise.
Pd is defined as conditional probability of detection of the preamble when the
signal is present. The erroneous detection consists of several error cases --
detecting only different preamble(s) than the one that was sent, not detecting
any preamble at all, or detecting the correct preamble but with the out-of-
bounds timing estimation value. For AWGN, and NTN-TDLA100, a timing estimation
error occurs if the estimation error of the timing of the strongest path is
larger than the time error tolerance values given in table 11.4.1.1-1.
Table 11.4.1.1-1: Time error tolerance for AWGN, NTN-TDLA100

us B4, C2 15 0.52 us 0.804 us 30 0.26 us 0.544 us
The test preambles are listed in table A.4. Which specific test(s) are
applicable to SAN is based on the test applicability rules defined in clause
11.1.3.
#### 11.4.1.2 Minimum requirement
For _SAN type 1-O_ , the minimum requirement is in TS 38.108 [2] clause
11.4.1.1 and 11.4.1.2.
#### 11.4.1.3 Test purpose
The test shall verify the receiver\'s ability to detect PRACH preamble under
static conditions and multipath fading propagation conditions for a given SNR.
#### 11.4.1.4 Method of test
##### 11.4.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal, see clause B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M, see clause 4.9.1.
Direction to be tested: OTA REFSENS _receiver target reference direction_ (see
D.44 in table 4.6-1).
##### 11.4.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Place the SAN with its manufacturer declared coordinate system reference
point in the same place as calibrated point in the test system, as shown in
annex D.7.
2) Align the manufacturer declared coordinate system orientation of the SAN
with the test system.
3) Set the SAN in the declared direction to be tested.
4) Connect the SAN tester generating the wanted signal, multipath fading
simulators and AWGN generators to a test antenna via a combining network in
OTA test setup, as shown in annex D.7. Each of the demodulation branch signals
should be transmitted on one polarization of the test antenna(s).
5) The characteristics of the wanted signal shall be configured according to
the corresponding UL reference measurement channel defined in annex A and the
test parameter _msg1-FrequencyStart_ is set to 0.
6) The multipath fading emulators shall be configured according to the
corresponding channel model defined in annex G.
7) Adjust the AWGN generator, according to the SCS and channel bandwidth. The
power level for the transmission may be set such that the AWGN level at the
RIB is equal to the AWGN level in table 11.4.1.4.2-1.
Table 11.4.1.4.2-1: AWGN power level at the SAN input
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Sub-carrier spacing | Channel bandwidth | AWGN power level | | (kHz) | (MHz) | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 15 | 5 | -83.5 - | | | | Δ~OTAREFSENS~ dBm / | | | | 4.5MHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | 30 | 10 | -80.6 - | | | | Δ~OTAREFSENS~ dBm / | | | | 8.64MHz | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | NOTE 1: | | | | Δ~OTAREFSENS~ as | | | | declared in D.43 in | | | | table 4.6-1 and | | | | clause 10.1. | | | | | | | | NOTE 2: The AWGN | | | | power level contains | | | | an AWGN offset of | | | | 16dB by default. If | | | | needed for test | | | | purposes, the AWGN | | | | level can be reduced | | | | from the default by | | | | any value in the | | | | range 0dB to 16dB. | | | | Changing the AWGN | | | | level does not | | | | impact the validity | | | | of the test, as it | | | | reduces the | | | | effective base band | | | | SNR level. | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
8) Adjust the frequency offset of the test signal according to table
11.4.1.5-1 or 11.4.1.5-2 or 11.4.1.5-3.
9) Adjust the equipment so that the SNR specified in table 11.4.1.5-1 or
11.4.1.5-2 or 11.4.1.5-3 is achieved at the SAN input during the PRACH
preambles.
10) The test signal generator sends a preamble and the receiver tries to
detect the preamble. This pattern is repeated as illustrated in figure
11.4.1.4.2-1. The preambles are sent with certain timing offsets as described
below. The following statistics are kept: the number of preambles detected in
the idle period and the number of missed preambles.
Figure 11.4.1.4.2-1: PRACH preamble test pattern
Unless otherwise stated, the timing offset base value for PRACH preamble
format 0 and 2 is set to 50% of Ncs. This offset is increased within the loop,
by adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range,
which is 0.9us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set
again to 50% of Ncs. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format 0 and
2 is presented in Figure 11.4.1.4.2-2.

Unless otherwise stated, the timing offset base value for PRACH preamble
format B4 and C2 is set to 0. This offset is increased within the loop, by
adding in each step a value of 0.1us, until the end of the tested range, which
is 0.8us. Then the loop is being reset and the timing offset is set again to
0. The timing offset scheme for PRACH preamble format B4 and C2 is presented
in Figure 11.4.1.4.2-3.

operational conditions is not tested in the present document. These may be
stated and tested separately.
## B.3.3 Extreme temperature
When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the minimum and maximum operating temperatures declared
by the manufacturer for the equipment under test.
NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational prior to
the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.
For SPRF:
The test at minimum and maximum temperatures shall be performed with the
environment test equipment and methods including the required environmental
phenomena into the equipment, conforming to the test procedures specific to
space equipment, as declared by the manufacturer.
For SAN terrestrial equipment:
The test at minimum temperature shall be performed with the environment test
equipment and methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 [14]. It is
allowed to exclude from this test condition the equipment which is difficult
to include due to size limitations. Such exclusion shall be recorded in the
test report.
The test at maximum temperature shall be performed with the environmental test
equipment and methods including the required environmental phenomena into the
equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 [15]. It is
allowed to exclude from this test condition the equipment which is difficult
to include due to size limitations. Such exclusion shall be recorded in the
test report.
## B.3.4 Extreme power supply
When extreme power supply conditions are specified for a test, the test shall
be performed at the standard upper and lower limits of operating voltage
defined by manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.Upper
voltage limit:
The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the upper limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment).
For SPRF the tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum and
maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, as
described in clause B.3.2.For SAN terrestrial equipment the tests shall be
carried out at the steady state minimum and maximum temperature limits
declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, to the methods described in
IEC 60 068-2-1 [14] Test Ab/Ad and IEC 60 068-2-2 [15] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat.
It is allowed to exclude from this test condition the equipment which is
difficult to include due to size limitations. Such exclusion shall be recorded
in the test report.
Lower voltage limit:
The equipment shall be supplied with a voltage equal to the lower limit
declared by the manufacturer (as measured at the input terminals to the
equipment).
For SPRF the tests shall be carried out at the steady state minimum and
maximum temperature limits declared by the manufacturer for the equipment, as

IEC 60 068-2-2 [15] Test Bb/Bd: Dry heat. It is allowed to exclude from this
test condition the equipment, which is difficult to include due to size
limitations. Such exclusion shall be recorded in the test report.
# B.4 Vibration
When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as defined
by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
For SPRF this shall use the environment test equipment and methods including
the required environmental phenomena into the equipment, conforming to the
test procedures specific to space equipment, as declared by the
manufacturer.For SAN terrestrial equipment this shall use the environmental
test equipment and methods of inducing the required environmental phenomena in
to the equipment, conforming to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-6 [16].
Other environmental conditions shall be within the ranges specified in annex
B.2. It is allowed to exclude from this test condition the equipment which is
difficult to include due to size limitations. Such exclusion shall be recorded
in the test report.
NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in to
equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should only
vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.
# B.5 Measurement of test environment
The measurement accuracy of the test environments defined in annex B shall be:
Pressure: ±5 kPa
Temperature: ±2 degrees
Relative humidity: ±5 %
DC voltage: ±1.0 %
AC voltage: ±1.5 %
Vibration: 10 %
Vibration frequency: 0.1 Hz
The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Test tolerances and derivation of test
requirements
The test requirements explicitly defined in this specification have been
calculated by relaxing the minimum requirements of the core specification TS
38.108 [2] using the test tolerances (TT) defined here. When the TT value is
zero, the test requirement will be the same as the minimum requirement. When
the TT value is non-zero, the test requirements will differ from the minimum
requirements, and the formula used for this relaxation is given in the
following tables.
The TT~OTA~ values are derived from OTA Test System uncertainties, regulatory
requirements and criticality to system performance. As a result, the TT~OTA~
values may sometimes be set to zero.
The TT~OTA~ values should not be modified for any reason e.g. to take account
of commonly known OTA Test System errors (such as mismatch, cable loss, etc.).
Note that a formula for applying TT~OTA~ values is provided for all OTA tests,
even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case where
the OTA Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in clause 4.1.2.
In this event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined TT~OTA~
value in order to generate the correct tightened test requirements as defined
in this annex.

###### ## Annex F (normative): Void
###### ## Annex G (normative): Propagation conditions
# G.1 Static propagation condition
The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist for this
propagation model.
# G.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
The multipath propagation conditions consist of several parts:
\- A delay profile in the form of a \"tapped delay-line\", characterized by a
number of taps at fixed positions on a sampling grid. The profile can be
further characterized by the r.m.s. delay spread and the maximum delay spanned
by the taps.
\- A combination of channel model parameters that include the Delay profile
and the Doppler spectrum that is characterized by a classical spectrum shape
and a maximum Doppler frequency.
## G.2.1 Delay profiles
The delay profiles are simplified from the TR 38.811 [17] TDL models. The
simplification steps are shown below for information. These steps are only
used when new delay profiles are created. Otherwise, the delay profiles
specified in G.2.1.1 can be used as such.
\- Step 1: Use the original TDL model from TR 38.811 [17].
\- Step 2: Re-order the taps in ascending delays
\- Step 3: Perform delay scaling according to the procedure described in
clause 7.7.2 in TR 38.901 [11].
\- Step 4: Apply the quantization to the delay resolution 5 ns. This is done
simply by rounding the tap delays to the nearest multiple of the delay
resolution.
\- Step 5: If multiple Rayleigh taps are rounded to the same delay bin, merge
them by calculating their linear power sum.
\- Step 6: If there is a LOS path in the model, the power for all paths could
be slightly adjusted to keep the RMS delay spread is close to target delay
spread and mean power is 0dB.
\- Step 7: Round the amplitudes of taps to one decimal (e.g. -8.78 dB -8.8 dB)
\- Step 8: If the delay spread has slightly changed due to the tap merge,
adjust the final delay spread by increasing or decreasing the power of the
last tap so that the delay spread is corrected.
\- Step 9: Re-normalize the highest Rayleigh tap to 0 dB when there is no LOS
path in the model.
Note 1: Some values of the delay profile created by the simplification steps
may differ from the values in tables G.2.1.1-2 and G.2.1.1-3 for the
corresponding model.
Note 2: For Step 5 and Step 6, the power values are expressed in the linear
domain using 6 digits of precision. The operations are in the linear domain.
### G.2.1.1 Delay profiles for FR1
The delay profiles for FR1 are selected to be representative of NLOS and LOS
scenarios. The resulting model parameters are specified in G.2.1.1-1 and the
tapped delay line models are specified in tables G.2.1.1-2 and table
G.2.1.1-3.

## G.2.2 Combinations of channel model parameters
The propagation conditions used for the performance measurements in multi-path
fading environment are indicated as a combination of a channel model name and
a maximum Doppler frequency, i.e., NTN-TDLA\-\ or NTN-

UL timing adjustment performance. The time difference between the reference
timing and the first tap is according to Equation (G.3-1). The timing
difference between moving UE and stationary UE is equal to Δτ - (_T~A~_
−31)×16×64 _T~c~_ for 15kHz SCS and Δτ - (_T~A~_ −31)×16×32 _T~c~_ for 30kHz
SCS. The relative timing among all taps is fixed. The parameters for the
moving propagation conditions are shown in Table G.3-1.

###### ## Annex H (normative): In-channel Tx test
# H.1 General
The in-channel TX test enables the measurement of all relevant parameters that
describe the in-channel quality of the output signal of the TX under test in a
single measurement process.
The parameters describing the in-channel quality of a transmitter, however,
are not necessarily independent. The algorithm chosen for description inside
this annex places particular emphasis on the exclusion of all
interdependencies among the parameters.
# H.2 Basic principles
The process is based on the comparison of the actual output signal of the TX
under test, received by an ideal receiver, with an ideal signal, that is
generated by the measuring equipment and represents an ideal error free
received signal. All signals are represented as equivalent (generally complex)
baseband signals.
The description below uses numbers and illustrations as examples only. These
numbers are taken from a FDD frame structure with normal CP length, 30 kHz SCS
and a transmission bandwidth configuration of 100 MHz (_N_ ~RB~ = 273). The
application of the text below, however, is not restricted to this parameter
set.
## H.2.1 Output signal of the TX under test
The output signal of the TX under test is acquired by the measuring equipment
and stored for further processsing. It is sampled at a sampling rate which is
the product of the SCS and the _FFT size_ , and it is named $z\left( \upsilon
\right)$. The _FFT size_ is determined by the transmission bandwidth in table
6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4
for 60 kHz SCS. In the time domain, it comprises at least 10 ms. It is
modelled as a signal with the following parameters:
\- demodulated data content,
\- carrier frequency,
\- amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.
For the example in the annex, the _FFT size_ is 4096 based on table 6.5.3.5-3.
The sampling rate of 122.88 Msps is the product of the _FFT size_ and SCS.
## H.2.2 Ideal signal
Two types of ideal signals are defined:
The first ideal signal $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by the
measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters:
\- demodulated data content,
\- nominal carrier frequency,
\- nominal amplitude and phase for each subcarrier.
It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate determined
from annex H.2.1 in the time domain. The structure of the signal is described
in the test models.
The second ideal signal $i_{2}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is constructed by the
measuring equipment according to the relevant TX specifications, using the
following parameters:
\- nominal demodulation reference signals (all other modulation symbols are
set to 0 V),
\- nominal carrier frequency,
\- nominal amplitude and phase for each applicable subcarrier,
\- nominal timing.
It is represented as a sequence of samples at the sampling rate determined
from annex H.2.1 in the time domain.
## H.2.3 Measurement results
The measurement results, achieved by the in-channel TX test are the following:
\- Carrier frequency error
\- EVM
\- Resource element TX power
\- OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP)
Other side results are: residual amplitude- and phase response of the TX chain
after equalisation.
## H.2.4 Measurement points
The resource element TX power is measured after the FFT box as described in
figure H.2.4-1. The EVM shall be measured at the point after the FFT and a
zero-forcing (ZF) equalizer in the receiver, as depicted for FR1 in figure
H.2.4-1. The FFT window of _FFT size_ samples out of (_FFT size_ \+ cyclic
prefix length) samples in the time domain is selected in the \"Remove CP\"
box. The _FFT size_ and the cyclic prefix length are obtained from table
6.5.3.5-2 for 15 kHz SCS, table 6.5.3.5-3 for 30 kHz SCS and table 6.5.3.5-4
for 60 kHz SCS.
In one subframe, there are two symbols with the length of the cyclic prefix
larger than the values listed in tables 6.5.3.5-2, 6.5.3.5-3 and 6.5.3.5-4.
Table H.2.4-1 lists the slot number and the symbol number and the formula how
to compute the length of cyclic prefix for those two symbols according to the
sampling rate.
Table H.2.4-1: Slot number and symbol number identifying the longer CP length
for normal CP
* * *
SCS (kHz) # slots in subframe Symbol # and slot # with longer CP Longer CP
length
* * *
15 1 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 128 (symbol 7, slot 0)
30 2 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 64 (symbol 0, slot 1)
60 4 (symbol 0, slot 0)\ CP length + _FFT size_ / 32 (symbol 0, slot 2)
* * *
For the example used in the annex, the \"Remove CP\" box selects 4096 samples
out of 4384 samples. Symbol 0 has 64 more samples in the cyclic prefix than
the other 13 symbols in the slot (the longer CP length = 352).
Figure H.2.4-1: Reference point for FR1 EVM measurements
# H.3 Pre-FFT minimization process
Sample Timing, Carrier Frequency in $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are varied in
order to minimise the difference between $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ and
$i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$, after the amplitude ratio of $z\left( \upsilon
\right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ has been scaled. Best fit (minimum
difference) is achieved when the RMS difference value between $z\left(
\upsilon \right)$ and $i_{1}\left( \upsilon \right)$ is an absolute minimum.
The carrier frequency variation is the measurement result: carrier frequency
error.
From the acquired samples, one value of carrier frequency error can be
derived.
Note 1: The minimisation process, to derive the RF error can be supported by
post-FFT operations. However the minimisation process defined in the pre-FFT
domain comprises all acquired samples (i.e. it does not exclude the samples
inbetween the FFT widths and it does not exclude the bandwidth outside the
transmission bandwidth configuration).
Note 2: The algorithm would allow to derive carrier frequency error and sample
frequency error of the TX under test separately. However there are no
requirements for sample frequeny error. Hence the algorithm models the RF and
the sample frequency commonly (not independently). It returns one error and
does not distinuish between both.
After this process, the samples $z\left( \upsilon \right)$ are called
$z^{0}\left( \upsilon \right)$.
# H.4 Timing of the FFT window
The FFT window length is _FFT size_ samples per OFDM symbol. For FDD, there
are $14N_{\text{dl}}$ FFTs performed where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of
slots in a 10 ms measurement interval, and the number of symbols in a slot for
normal CP is 14.
The position in time for the FFT shall be determined.
For the example used in the annex, the FFT window length is 4096 samples per
OFDM symbol. 280 FFTs (i.e. 1,146,880 samples) cover less than the acquired
number of samples (i.e. 1,228,800 samples in 10 ms).
In an ideal signal, the FFT may start at any instant within the cyclic prefix
without causing an error. The TX filter, however, reduces the window. The EVM
requirements shall be met within a window _W_ \ and
$$\varphi\left( f \right) = \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{N}{\varphi\left( t_{i},f
\right)}}{N}$$
> Where _N_ is the number of demodulation reference signals time-domain
> locations $t_{i}$ from $Z'\left( t,f \right)$ for each demodulation
> reference signal subcarrier _f_.
3\. The equalizer coefficients for amplitude and phase $\widehat{a}\left( f
\right)$ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ at the demodulation reference
signal subcarriers are obtained by computing the moving average in the
frequency domain of the time-averaged demodulation reference signal
subcarriers. The moving average window size is 19 and averaging is over the
DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or near the
edge of the channel, or when the number of available DM-RS subcarriers within
a set of contiguously allocated RBs is smaller than the moving average window
size, the window size is reduced accordingly as per figure H.6-1.
4\. Perform linear interpolation from the equalizer coefficients
$\widehat{a}\left( f \right)$ and $\widehat{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ to
compute coefficients$\widetilde{\text{\ a}}\left( f \right)$,
$\widetilde{\varphi}\left( f \right)$ for each subcarrier.

# H.7 EVM
## H.7.0 General
For EVM create two sets of $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$, according to
the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and $\left(
\mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$, using the equalizer coefficients from H.6.
The equivalent ideal samples are calculated from $i_{1}\left( \upsilon
\right)$ (annex H.2.2) and are called $I\left( t,f \right)$.
The EVM is the difference between the ideal signal and the equalized measured
signal.
$$\text{EVM} = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i
\right)}^{}\left| Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right) - I\left( t,f \right)
\right|^{2}}}{\sum_{\text{tϵT}}^{}{\sum_{\text{fϵF}\left( i \right)}^{}\left|
I\left( t,f \right) \right|^{2}}}}$$
Where:
\- T is the set of symbols with the considered modulation scheme being active
within the slot,
\- $F\left( t \right)$ is the set of subcarriers within the resource blocks
with the considered modulation scheme being active in symbol _t_ ,
\- $I\left( t,f \right)$ _is_ the ideal signal reconstructed by the
measurement equipment in accordance with relevant test models,
\- $Z_{\text{eq}}'\left( t,f \right)$ is the equalized signal under test.
NOTE: Although the basic unit of measurement is one slot, the equalizer is
calculated over the entire 10 ms measurement interval to reduce the impact of
noise in the reference signals.
## H.7.1 Averaged EVM (FDD)
EVM is averaged over all allocated downlink resource blocks with the
considered modulation scheme in the frequency domain, and a minimum of
$N_{\text{dl}}$ slots where $N_{\text{dl}}$ is the number of slots in a 10 ms
measurement interval. The averaging in the time domain equals the
$N_{\text{dl}}$ slot duration of the 10 ms measurement interval from the
equalizer estimation step.
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{\sum_{i =
1}^{N_{\text{dl}}}N_{i}}\sum_{i = 1}^{N_{\text{dl}}}{\sum_{j =
1}^{N_{i}}\text{EVM}_{i,j}^{2}}}$
_Where_ $N_{i}$ is the number of resource blocks with the considered
modulation scheme in slot _i_.
The EVM requirements shall be tested against the maximum of the RMS average at
the window _W_ extremities of the EVM measurements:
Thus ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{l}$ in the expressions above
and ${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}$ is calculated using
$\widetilde{t} = \mathrm{\Delta}{\widetilde{t}}_{h}$ in the
${\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame}}$ calculation where (_l_ and _h_ , low
and high; where low is the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c - W/2 \right)$ and
high is the timing $\left( \mathrm{\Delta}c + W/2 \right)$).
Thus:
$\overline{\text{EVM}} = \max_{}\left(
{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,l}},{\overline{\text{EVM}}}_{\text{frame,h}}
\right)$
The resulting $\overline{\text{EVM}}$ is compared against the limit.
