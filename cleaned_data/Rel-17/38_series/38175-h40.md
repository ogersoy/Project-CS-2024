In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document covers the assessment for NR Integrated access and
backhaul (IAB) node and associated ancillary equipment in respect of
Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC).
The present document specifies the applicable test conditions, performance
assessment and performance criteria for NR Integrated access and backhaul
(IAB) node and associated ancillary equipment.
Technical requirements related to the antenna and TAB connectors are not
included in the present document. These are found in the relevant product
standards [2, 24, 25].
The environment classification used in the present document refers to the
residential, commercial and light industrial environment classification used
in IEC 61000-6-1 [4], IEC 61000-6-3 [5] and IEC 61000-6-8 [26].
The EMC requirements have been selected to ensure an adequate level of
compatibility for apparatus at residential, commercial and light industrial
environments. The levels, however, do not cover extreme cases which may occur
in any location but with low probability of occurrence.

# 4 Test conditions
## 4.1 General
Requirements throughout the EMC specifications are in some cases defined
separately for different frequency ranges (FR). The frequency ranges FR1 and
FR2 are defined in subclause 5.1 of TS 38.174 [2].
The equipment shall be tested in normal test environment defined in the
corresponding IAB conformance testing specification TS38.176-1[24] and
TS38.176-2[25]. The test conditions shall be recorded in the test report.
For IAB Node capable of multi-band operation, the requirements in the present
document apply for each supported _operating band_ unless otherwise stated.
_Operating bands_ shall be activated according to the test configuration in
subclause 4.5. Tests shall be performed relating to each type of _port_ and
all _operating bands_ shall be assessed during the tests.
The manufacturer shall declare the supported _operating band(s)_ according to
the list of NR IAB _operating bands_ defined in TS 38.174 [2].
> NOTE 1: NR IAB _operating bands_ for IAB _type 1-H_ , are declared by the
> manufacturer according to the declarations specified in TS38.176-1[24],
> Table 4.6-1 and TS38.176-2[25],Table 4.6-1.
NOTE 2: NR IAB _operating bands_ for _IAB type 1-O_ and _IAB type 2-O,_ are
declared by the manufacturer according to the declarations specified in
TS38.176-2[25], Table 4.6-1.
## 4.2 Arrangements for establishing a communication link
The wanted RF input signal nominal frequency shall be selected by setting the
NR Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) to an appropriate
number.
A communication link shall be set up with a suitable test system capable of
evaluating the required performance criteria (hereafter called \"the test
system\") at the radio interface and _telecommunication port/ports_ (the NG
interface). The test system shall be located outside of the test environment.
When the EUT is required to be in the transmit/receive mode, the following
conditions shall be met:
\- For the _IAB type 1-H_ testing, the EUT shall be commanded to operate at
rated transmit power;
\- For the _IAB type 1-O_ and _IAB type 2-O_ testing, the EUT transmit power
shall be configured as stated in clause 8.1 for emission test and clause 9.1
for immunity test accordingly,
\- Adequate measures shall be taken to avoid the effect of the unwanted signal
on the measuring equipment;
\- The wanted input signal level shall be set to a level where the performance
is not limited by the receiver noise floor or strong signal effects.
NOTE: 15 dB above the conducted reference sensitivity level has been used as
an example of wanted input signal level in legacy 3GPP EMC specifications for
establishing a communication link.
For immunity tests clause 4.3 shall apply and the conditions shall be as
follows.
## 4.3 Narrow band responses on receivers
Responses on receivers or duplex transceivers occurring during the immunity
test at discrete frequencies which are narrow band responses (spurious
responses), are identified by the following method:
\- if during an immunity test the quantity being monitored goes outside the
specified tolerances (clause 6), it is necessary to establish whether the
deviation is due to a narrow band response or to a wide band (EMC) phenomenon.
Therefore, the test shall be repeated with the unwanted signal frequency
increased, and then decreased by 2 x BW~Channel~ MHz, where BW~Channel~ is the
channel bandwidth as defined in TS 38.174 [2], clause 5.3;
\- if the deviation disappears in either one or both of the above MHz offset
cases, then the response is considered as a narrow band response;
\- if the deviation does not disappear, this may be due to the fact that the
offset has made the frequency of the unwanted signal correspond to the
frequency of another narrow band response. Under these circumstances the
procedure is repeated with the increase and decrease of the frequency of the
unwanted signal set to 2.5 x BW~Channel~ MHz;
\- if the deviation does not disappear with the increased and/or decreased
frequency, the phenomenon is considered wide band and therefore an EMC problem
and the equipment fails the test.
For immunity test narrow band responses are disregarded.
## 4.4 Exclusion bands
### 4.4.1 Transmitter exclusion band
The _transmitter exclusion band_ for IAB is the frequency range over which no
tests of radiated immunity of a transmitter are made. As the IAB node may
operate its access and backhaul link in different NR IAB _operating band_ ,
the _transmitter exclusion band_ for IAB applies separately for the access and
backhaul link. The _transmitter exclusion band applies to IAB type 1-O._
The _transmitter exclusion band_ is defined as:
F~DL,low~ -- Δf~OBUE~ \ 90 % instead of throughput > 95 %). After each test case IAB node shall
operate as intended with no loss of user control function, stored data and the
communication link to both UE and donor test equipments shall be maintained.

## 6.2 Performance criteria for transient phenomena for IAB
At the conclusion of the total test (comprising the series of individual
exposures to transient phenomena) the IAB node shall operate as intended with
no user noticeable loss of control functions or stored data. At the conclusion
of each exposure the IAB node shall operate with no user noticeable loss of
the communication link to both UE and donor test equipments.
The channel bandwidth, sub-carrier spacing and bearer information data rate
should be chosen based on manufacturer's declaration and defined according to
table 6.1-1 and table 6.1-2.
## 6.3 Performance criteria for continuous phenomena for Ancillary equipment
The apparatus shall continue to operate as intended during and after the test.
No degradation of performance or loss of function is allowed below the
performance level specified by the manufacturer, when the apparatus is used as
intended. The performance level may be replaced by a permissible performance
loss. If the minimum performance level or the permissible performance loss is
not specified by the manufacturer, either of these may be derived from the
product description and documentation and what the user may reasonably expect
from the apparatus if used as intended.
## 6.4 Performance criteria for transient phenomena for Ancillary equipment
The apparatus shall continue to operate as intended after the test. No
degradation of performance or loss of function is allowed below the
performance level specified by the manufacturer, when the apparatus is used as
intended. The performance level may be replaced by a permissible performance
loss. During the test, degradation of performance is however allowed. If the
minimum performance level or the permissible performance loss is not specified
by the manufacturer, either of these may be derived from the product
description and documentation and what the user may reasonably expect from the
apparatus if used as intended.
# 7 Applicability overview
## 7.1 Emission
Throughout this specification, whenever the IAB requirement is referred, its
applicability shall be considered as applicable to the IAB node as a whole (MT
and DU), irrespective of its implementation. Performance assessment of an IAB
node with multiple enclosures may be done separately for each of them,

# 8 Emission
## 8.1 Test configurations
This clause defines the configurations for emission tests as follows:
\- The equipment shall be tested under normal test conditions as specified in
the functional standards;
\- The test configuration shall be as close to normal intended use as
possible;
\- If the equipment is part of a system, or can be connected to ancillary
equipment, then it shall be acceptable to test the equipment while connected
to the minimum configuration of _ancillary equipment_ necessary to exercise
the _port_ s;
\- If the equipment has a large number of _port_ s, then a sufficient number
shall be selected to simulate actual operation conditions and to ensure that
all the different types of termination are tested;
\- The test conditions, test configuration and mode of operation shall be
recorded in the test report;
\- _Port_ s which in normal operation are connected shall be connected to an
_ancillary equipment_ or to a representative piece of cable correctly
terminated to simulate the input/output characteristics of the _ancillary
equipment_ ; in case of _IAB type 1-H_ , _antenna port_ s shall be correctly
terminated;
\- For _IAB type 1-O_ and _IAB type 2-O_ without _antenna ports_ but
intentionally radiating through the _antenna array_ , the equipment shall be
placed in a test setup suitable for the radiated power;
\- _Port_ s which are not connected to cables during normal operation, e.g.
service connectors, programming connectors, temporary connectors etc. shall
not be connected to any cables for the purpose of EMC testing. Where cables
have to be connected to these _port_ s, or interconnecting cables have to be
extended in length in order to exercise the EUT, precautions shall be taken to
ensure that the evaluation of the EUT is not affected by the addition or
extension of these cables;
\- The test arrangements for transmitter and receiver clauses of the
transceiver are described separately for the sake of clarity. However, where
possible the test of the transmitter clause and receiver clause of the EUT may
be carried out simultaneously to reduce test time.
## 8.2 Radiated emission
### 8.2.1 Radiated emission, IAB
This test is applicable to _IAB type 1-H_. This test shall be performed on a
representative configuration of IAB node.
For _IAB type 1-O_ and _IAB type 2-O_ , the radiated emission is covered by
radiated spurious emission requirement in TS 38.174 [2], conforming to the
test requirement in TS 38.174[2].
#### 8.2.1.1 Definition
This test assesses the ability of IAB node to limit unwanted emission from the
_enclosure port_.
#### 8.2.1.2 Test method
a) A test site fulfilling the requirements of ITU-R SM.329 [20] shall be used.
The IAB node shall be placed on a non-conducting support and shall be operated
from a power source via a RF filter to avoid radiation from the power leads.
One of the following two alternative measurement methods shall be used:
1) Field strength method measurement
The test method shall be in accordance with CISPR 32 [6]. The field strength
measurements shall be performed on a test site that is validated according to
the methods and requirements of CISPR 16-1-4 [23].
Unless otherwise stated, measurements are conducted at 3 m or 10 m on an open
area test site (OATS) or semi anechoic chamber (SAC) for frequencies up to 1
GHz, or at 3 m on a free space open area test site (FSOATS) or fully-anechoic
room (FAR) for frequencies above 1 GHz. Unless otherwise stated, all
measurements are done with RMS detector and with the -3 dB bandwidth of the
measuring filter equal to the reference bandwidth in table 8.2.1.3-1.
NOTE 1: Test site validation methods for radiated emissions tests are defined
in CISPR 16-1-4 [23], clause 6 and 7. Examples of test site validation methods
are listed below:
\- 30 - 1000 MHz frequency range: Normalized Site Attenuation (NSA), Reference
Site Method (RSM).
\- 1 - 18 GHz frequency range: S~VSWR~ standard test procedure, S~VSWR~
reciprocal test procedure.
2) Substitution method measurement (also called a substitution method)
> Mean power of any spurious components shall be detected by the test antenna
> and measuring receiver (e.g. a spectrum analyser). At each frequency at
> which a component is detected, the IAB node shall be rotated and the height
> of the test antenna adjusted to obtain maximum response, and the effective
> radiated power (e.r.p.) of that component determined by a substitution
> measurement. The measurement shall be repeated with the test antenna in the
> orthogonal polarization plane.
NOTE: Effective radiated power (e.r.p.) refers to the radiation of a half wave
tuned dipole instead of an isotropic antenna. There is a constant difference
of 2.15 dB between e.i.r.p. and e.r.p, as defined in ITU-R SM.329 annex 1
[20].
e.r.p. (dBm) = e.i.r.p. (dBm) - 2.15
b) The IAB node shall transmit with maximum power declared by the manufacturer
with all transmitters active. Set the base station to transmit a signal as
stated in subclause 4.5.
c) For IAB-DU the received power shall be measured over the frequency range
from 30 MHz to F~DL,low~ - Δf~OBUE~ and from F~DL,high~ + Δf~OBUE~ up to 12750
MHz. The video bandwidth shall be approximately three times the resolution
bandwidth. If this video bandwidth is not available on the measuring receiver,
it shall be the maximum available and at least 1 MHz. For some _operating
bands_ , the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the
5^th^ harmonic limit of the downlink _operating band_ , as specified in ITU-R
recommendation SM.329 [20].Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are done
as mean power (RMS).
d) For IAB-MT the received power shall be measured over the frequency range
from 30 MHz to F~UL,low~ - Δf~OBUE~ and from F~UL,high~ + Δf~OBUE~ up to 12750
MHz. The video bandwidth shall be approximately three times the resolution
bandwidth. If this video bandwidth is not available on the measuring receiver,
it shall be the maximum available and at least 1 MHz. For some _operating
bands_ , the upper limit is higher than 12.75 GHz in order to comply with the
5^th^ harmonic limit of the uplink _operating band_ , as specified in ITU-R
recommendation SM.329 [20].Unless otherwise stated, all measurements are done
as mean power (RMS).
#### 8.2.1.3 Limits
The frequency boundary and reference bandwidths for the detailed transitions
of the limits between the requirements for out of band emissions and spurious
emissions are based on ITU-R Recommendations SM.329 [20] and SM.1539 [21]. The
_IAB type 1-H_ shall meet the limits below:

power between 4 GHz to 12,75 GHz ±6 dB ±9 dB (NOTE) Field strength between 30
MHz to 12,75 GHz ±6 dB ±6 dB NOTE: This value may be reduced to ±6 dB when
further information on the potential radiation characteristic of the EUT is
available.
NOTE: If the test system for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in table 8.2.1.4-1, this equipment can still be
used, provided that an adjustment is made follows:
Any additional uncertainty in the test system over and above that specified in
table 8.2.1.4-1 is used to tighten the test requirements - making the test
harder to pass.
This procedure will ensure that a test system not compliant with table
8.2.1.4-1 does not increase the probability of passing an EUT that would
otherwise have failed a test if a test system compliant with table 8.2.1.4-1
had been used.
### 8.2.2 Radiated emission, ancillary equipment
This test is only applicable to _ancillary equipment_ not incorporated in the
radio equipment and intended to be measured on a stand-alone basis, as
declared by the manufacturer. This test shall be performed on a representative
configuration of the _ancillary equipment_.
This test is not applicable for _ancillary equipment_ incorporated in the
radio equipment, or for _ancillary equipment_ intended to be measured in
combination with the radio equipment. In these cases, the requirements of the
