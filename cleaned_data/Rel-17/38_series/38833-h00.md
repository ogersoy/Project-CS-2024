# 4 Inter-user interference suppression for MU-MIMO
## 4.1 Scenario and interference modelling
### 4.1.1 Scenario
MU-MIMO allows gNB to transmit data to multiple UEs in the same time-frequency
resources through spatial multiplexing. The process of selecting paired UEs is
called 'pairing'. As illustrated in Figure 4.1.1-1, UE1 and UE2 are paired and
gNB transmits data to both UEs with suitable precoders through the same time-
frequency resources. However, the gNB cannot guarantee the perfect pairing of
multiple users in the real network. The paired UEs may not perfectly spatially
orthogonal to each other and this will induce the intra-cell interference
between paired UEs.

frequency resources
To evaluate the performance of UE with intra-cell interference induced by
spatial multiplexing, the following scenarios illustrated from Figure 4.1.1-2
to Figure 4.1.1-6 are considered for the case of number of paired UEs is 2.

>
> \- Scenario 1-3: Number of CDM group without data is 2
>

• Target UE with two DMRS antenna ports:

### 4.1.2 Interference model
The PDSCH and DMRS of the paired UEs are precoded prior to transmission. The
precoder for each user is denoted by $\mathbf{W}_{1}^{'}$ and
$\mathbf{W}_{2}^{'}$ respectively.
$\mathbf{W}_{i}\ $is the precoder matrix of i^th^ UE, of size N~TX~ x N~Li~
from Type I single panel codebook as described in [2]. Where, N~TX~ is the
number of TX antenna, N~Li~ is the number of layers from i^th^ UE. The
combined precoder $\mathbf{W\ = \ \lbrack W}_{1}\ \mathbf{W}_{2}\rbrack$, of
size N~TX~ x N~L~ where, N~L~ is the total number layers across all users.
The precoder of the target UE $\mathbf{W}_{1}$ is randomly selected. For the
co-scheduled UE, the precoder $\mathbf{W}_{2}$ is selected in one of the two
ways below.
> • Orthogonal precoder: $\mathbf{W}_{2}$ is randomly selected from the
> codebook with a constraint that the combined precoder **W** has orthogonal
> columns, i.e., the off-diagonal entries of **W^H^W** are zero.
>
> • Random precoder: $\mathbf{W}_{2}$ is randomly selected from the codebook
> ensuring any column of $\mathbf{W}_{2}$ is not identical to any column of
> $\mathbf{W}_{1}$
To maintain the average per UE signal power as N~Li~ /N~L,~ an additional
scaling is applied to the each precoder as:
$$\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{i}}^{\mathbf{'}} = \
\sqrt{\frac{N_{\text{Li}}}{N_{L}}}*\mathbf{W}_{\mathbf{i}}$$
## 4.2 Receiver structure
### 4.2.1 General
In this clause, we provide the system equations for evaluating the performance
of intra-cell inter-user interference mitigation.
The N~Rx~-dimensional received signal vector **r** of the $k$-th subcarrier
and the $l$-th OFDM symbol is assumed to be expressed as a sum of target's UE
own signal $\mathbf{H}_{1}\left( k,l \right)\mathbf{d}_{1}\left( k,l \right)$,
and co-scheduled UEs' interference signals $\mathbf{H}_{j}\left( k,l
\right)\mathbf{d}_{j}\left( k,l \right)$ (j>1) and the white noise
$\mathbf{n}(k,l)$;
$$\mathbf{r}\left( k,\ l \right) = \ \mathbf{H}_{1}\left( k,l
\right)\mathbf{d}_{1}\left( k,l \right) + \sum_{j =
2}^{N_{\text{UE}}}{\mathbf{H}_{j}\left( k,l \right)\mathbf{d}_{j}\left( k,l
\right)} + \mathbf{n}(k,l)$$
Where,
> $\mathbf{d}_{j}\left( k,l \right)$ and $\mathbf{H}_{j}\left( k,l \right),\ j
> = { 2,\ldots N_{\text{UE}}}$ represent the N~layer,j~ x1 transmitted signal
> vector and the (N~Rx~ x N~layer,j~) channel matrix between the _j_ -th co-
> scheduled UE's interference and the UE containing the contribution from
> receiver branches, with $\mathbf{H}_{j} = \begin{bmatrix}
> {(\mathbf{H}_{j,1})}^{H} \ {(\mathbf{H}_{j,2})}^{H} \ \end{bmatrix}$ for two
> receiver antennas and $\mathbf{H}_{j} = \begin{bmatrix} \begin{matrix}
> {(\mathbf{H}_{j,1})}^{H} \ {(\mathbf{H}_{j,2})}^{H} \ \end{matrix} \
> \begin{matrix} {(\mathbf{H}_{j,3})}^{H} \ {(\mathbf{H}_{j,4})}^{H} \
> \end{matrix} \ \end{bmatrix}$ for four receiver antennas, where,
> $\mathbf{H}_{j,i}$ channel-matrix of size N~layer,j~ x1 for the _i_ -th
> receiver antenna, respectively.
>
> $N_{\text{UE}}$ is the number of paired UEs plus one (the target UE), and
> $N_{\text{UE}} = 2$ in this technical report.
The recovered N~layer,1~ x 1 signal vector at the UE,
${\widehat{\mathbf{d}}}_{1}(k,l)$ is detected by using the (N~layer,1~ x
N~Rx~) receiver weight matrix $\mathbf{W}_{RX,1}\left( k,l \right)$ as
follows.
$${\widehat{\mathbf{d}}}_{1}\left( k,l \right) = \mathbf{W}_{RX,1}\left( k,l
\right)\mathbf{r}\left( k,\ l \right)$$
### 4.2.2 MMSE IRC receiver
To suppress the co-scheduled UE's interference, the candidate MMSE IRC
receiver type is captured in this subclause. The MMSE IRC receiver weight
matrix is expressed as follow:
$$\mathbf{W}_{RX,1}\left( k,l \right) =
{\widehat{\mathbf{H}}}_{1}^{H}(k,l)\mathbf{R}^{- 1}$$
$\mathbf{R = \ }P_{\mathbf{1}}{\widehat{\mathbf{H}}}_{1}\left( k,l
\right){\widehat{\mathbf{H}}}_{1}^{H}\left( k,l \right) +
\frac{1}{N_{\text{re}}}\sum_{k,l \in DMRS\ of\
N_{\text{UE}}}^{}{\widetilde{\mathbf{r}}(k,l){\widetilde{\mathbf{r}}(k,l)}^{H}}$,
$\widetilde{\mathbf{r}}\left( k,l \right) = \mathbf{r}\left( k,\ l \right) -
{\widehat{\mathbf{H}}}_{1}(k,l)\mathbf{d}_{1}\left( k,l \right)$ if co-
scheduled UE is in the same CDM group with target UE, and
$\widetilde{\mathbf{r}}\left( k,l \right) = \mathbf{r}\left( k,\ l \right)$,
if co-scheduled UE is in the different CDM group with target UE.
Where,
${\widehat{\mathbf{H}}}_{j}^{H}\left( k,l \right)$ and $\mathbf{d}_{1}(k,l)$
denote the estimated channel matrix and the transmit signal of target UE's
DMRS symbols, respectively, where the estimated channel matrix is also based
on DMRS.
$N_{\text{re}}$ is the number of sampling REs of intra-user's DMRS.
_P_ ~1~ is the transmission power of the serving cell and is equal to
$E\left\lbrack \left| \mathbf{d}_{1}\left( k,l \right) \right|^{2}
\right\rbrack$.

# 5 LTE CRS interference handling for NR UE
## 5.1 Scenario and interference modelling
### 5.1.1 Scenario
Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) provides a very useful migration path from LTE
to NR. To help faster 5G rollout, the network operators can deploy 5G using
their existing LTE frequency bands and base stations dynamically share the
resources based on the traffic load. As the time and frequency resources are
shared between NR UE and LTE UE, the core requirement for DSS is that existing
essential channels of LTE, such as CRS (cell-specific reference signal),
should be still transmitted for backward compatibility. In DSS scenario
(namely scenario 1), serving cell CRS rate matching is assumed to be
configured for NR PDSCH, but the always-on CRS signals from interference cells
will interfere NR UE.
Another scenario with overlapping spectrum for LTE and NR is that LTE and NR
are deployed in neighboring BSs/areas (namely scenario 2), when the refarming
progress is different in different areas. In scenario 2, the CRS is not
transmitted on the NR serving cell, and the CRS from neighboring LTE cell will
cause interference to NR UE in the overlapping spectrum.
To evaluate performance of different CRS interference handling schemes, the
two scenarios with overlapping spectrum for LTE and NR are considered below in
Figure 1.
• Scenario 1: Serving and interference cells are both operating in DSS
(NR+LTE) mode
• Scenario 2: Serving cell is operating in NR mode and interference cell is
operating in LTE mode
Scenario 1: Scenario 2:

Figure 5.1.1-1. Scenarios for CRS interference in overlapping spectrum for LTE
and NR
For the performance evaluation, 15 kHz SCS and synchronous network with 4 CRS
ports are assumed in the first phase.
### 5.1.2 LTE interference model
This subclause provides interference modelling for each explicitly modelled
LTE interfering cell in the simulation scenario. The interference modelling
methodology and interference profiles from LTE CRS interference mitigation
(CRS-IM) for homogenous deployments in [TR 36.863] are reused. INR-_i_ (signal
level of the _i_ -th dominant interference over Noc) is used as the
interference power measure, and two dominant interferers are explicitly
modelled in the simulation.
In each subframe, each interfering cell shall transmit randomly modulated data
over the entire PDSCH region and the full transmission bandwidth according to
the probabilities of occurrence. Transmitted physical channels shall include
PSS, SSS and PBCH. Probabilities of occurrence of LTE PDSCH in each subframe
are as specified in clause 5.3. If the probabilities of occurrence in each
subframe are not specified in clause 5.3, as default, they are equal to 1.
For each subframe and each CQI subband as defined in subclause 7.2 of [TS
36.213], a transmission rank shall be randomly determined independently from
other CQI subbands as well as other interfering cells. Probabilities of
occurrence of each possible transmission rank are as specified in clause 5.3.
For each subframe and CQI subband, a precoding matrix for the number of layers
associated to the selected rank shall be selected randomly from Table
6.3.4.2.3-1 of [TS 36.211]. Note that codebook index 0 shall be excluded from
random precoder selection when the number of layers is .
Precoding for spatial multiplexing with CRS for the number of antenna ports in
the simulation scenario shall be applied to 16QAM randomly modulated layer
symbols, as specified in subclause 6.3.4.2.1 of [TS 36.211] with the selected
precoding matrices for each subframe and each CQI subband.
For unallocated REs in the control region, precoding for transmit diversity
for the number of antenna ports in the simulation scenario shall be applied to
QPSK randomly modulated layer symbols, as specified in subclause 6.3.4.3 of
[TS 36.211]. The EPRE ratio for these REs shall be as defined for PDCCH in
Annex C.3.2 of [TS 36.101].
The EPRE ratio of LTE CRS of _i_ -th dominant interferer to NR SSS of serving
cell shall be defined as INR-_i_ /SNR, where Noc is same for serving cell and
all interfering cells.

with overlapping spectrum for LTE and NR is MMSE-IRC, which is used to define
the minimum demodulation performance requirements in NR. For CRS interference
handling, performance is evaluated with two categories of schemes:
> 1\. LTE CRS interference mitigation (CRS-IM)
>
> 2\. LTE CRS Rate matching (CRS-RM)
### 5.2.2 Reference receiver of LTE-CRS interference mitigation
For dealing with neighboring LTE CRS interference, two candidate receiver
types for CRS-IM are captured in this subclause, and the neighboring cell CRS-
IM is used together with LMMSE-IRC for demodulating NR PDSCH.
> • CRS interference cancellation (CRS-IC)
>
> \- Receiver may reconstruct neighboring LTE CRS interference based on
> detected neighboring LTE cell(s)' channel estimation and cancel the
> interference
>
> ∘ May have iteration for multiple strongest neighboring LTE interference
> cells
>
> • Log-likelihood ratio (LLR) weighting
>
> \- Receiver may estimate the power of neighboring LTE CRS interference and
> apply the weight to the estimated LLRs for REs which occupy with LTE CRS.
In particular, the following CRS-IM receiver assumptions are used for the
evaluation:
> • Synchronization network deployment is assumed in the first phase.
>
> • Single FFT processing for synchronized network.
>
> • UEs are not restricted to mitigate more than 1 LTE cell's interference,
> and this is left up to UE implementation.
>
> • UE with LLR weighting shall meet NR PDSCH processing procedure time
> requirement defined in TS 38.214 clause 5.3.
### 5.2.3 LTE cell configuration detection
The performance analysis in the technical report is provided under assumption
of with and without the knowledge of the interferer cell(s) CRS configuration.
When the information of the dominant interferer cell CRS is not signaled to
the UE by RRC signaling, the UE is expected to blindly detect the LTE cells
and decode MIB for LTE cell configuration of the interference cells for LTE
CRS-IM. Some UEs may not be capable of blindly detecting such information.

### 5.3.3 Summary of link level evaluation
According to the PDSCH link-level simulation results for 15 kHz SCS and
synchronous network in clause 5.3.2, RAN4 initial observations are as follows:
> • CRS-IC with the assumption of NW signaling can achieve better performance
> compared to RM scheme 1.
>
> • CRS-IC without NW assistant signaling achieve similar or lower performance
> compared to CRS-IC schemes with the assumption of NW signalling.
>
> • LLR weighting with the assumption of NW signaling can achieve better or
> similar performance compared to RM scheme 1.
>
> • LLR weighting without NW assistant signaling achieve similar or lower
> performance compared to LLR weighting with the assumption of NW signalling.
>
> • Note: RM scheme 1 is under the assumption that RM always applied for the
> strongest interference cell.
In addition, due to RM applied in interference cells, the CRS REs and data REs
under LTE cells will observe different interference level with SINR offset.
The interference mismatch among CRS REs and data REs may bring impact on LTE
cells considering the LTE CQI/RI/PMI reporting, PDSCH demodulation and
RSSI/RSRQ measurement. NW implementation solutions were provided by one
company to address LTE cell impact and the feasibility of such solutions from
network implementation perspective needs further discussion.
# 6 Conclusions
## 6.1 Conclusion on inter-user interference suppression for MU-MIMO scenario
This technical report has documented the RAN4 evaluation on techniques to cope
with downlink intra-cell inter-user interference. The major work includes the
determination of network scenario, interference modelling, interference
suppressing receiver structure, link-level simulation parameters and
performance evaluations.
MU-MIMO scenario with gNB transmits PDSCH to the paired UEs through the same
time-frequency resources is evaluated.
gNBs equipped with 2Tx and 4Tx antennas are considered in the RAN4 performance
evaluation. However, for the UEs capable of inter-user interference
suppression ability discussed in this TR, they can also be used in the
deployments with larger number of Tx ports configuration. 2 paired UEs are
considered, and both rank 1 and rank 2 for the target UE and co-scheduled UE
are covered in the evaluation.
Random precoder selection is applied for the target UE, and both orthogonal
and random co-scheduled UE precoder selection methods are considered.
Under the scenario that rank 1 transmission is scheduled to the target and the
co-scheduled UEs, both same and different CDM group configuration for the
target and the co-scheduled UEs' DMRS are considered.
Both TDLA30-10 and TDLC300-100 channel models with ULA Low antenna correlation
is considered as the propagation condition.
MMSE-IRC receiver without network assistance signalling is considered as the
reference receiver structure. DMRS based interference covariance estimation is
assumed.
For UE PDSCH parameters, 10 MHz CBW with 15kHz for FDD is included in the
evaluation.
Under the scenario that rank 1 transmission is scheduled to the target UE,
both MCS 4 and MCS 13 transmission is considered. Under the scenario that rank
2 transmission is scheduled to the target UE, both MCS 13 and MCS 19
transmission is considered.
PDSCH link-level simulations are performed to evaluate the performance gain of
MMSE-IRC processing over the baseline MMSE-MRC processing under intra-cell
inter-user interference scenario. 48 simulation cases with different antenna
and rank configurations for target and interference UEs, different antenna
correlation, different duplex modes and CBW configurations are included. The
simulation results can be summarized as follows:
> _•_ It is observed that MMSE-IRC receiver achieves performance gain over the
> baseline MMSE-MRC receiver, in the simulation with rank 1+1, 2T2R MIMO
> configuration.
>
> _•_ Except for the case with MCS 4 and DMRS with same CDM group, it is
> observed that MMSE-IRC receiver achieves performance gain over the baseline
> MMSE-MRC receiver, in the simulation with rank 1+1, 2T4R MIMO configuration.
>
> _•_ It is observed that MMSE-IRC receiver achieves performance gain over the
> baseline MMSE-MRC receiver, in the simulation with rank 2+1 and rank 2+2,
> under 4T4R MIMO configuration.
>
> _•_ For all test cases with rank 1+1, the average performance gain with the
> assumption of DMRS with different CDM group is similar with the average
> performance gain with the assumption of DMRS with same CDM group.
Based on the above evaluations, it is recommended to define NR PDSCH
demodulation requirements for inter-user interference suppression receiver for
MU-MIMO scenario in Rel-17.
## 6.2 Conclusion on CRS interference handling in scenarios with overlapping
spectrum for LTE and NR
This technical report has documented the RAN4 evaluation on techniques to cope
with CRS interference in scenarios with overlapping spectrum for LTE and NR.
The major work includes the determination of typical network scenarios,
interference models and interference profiles, definition of reference
receiver structures, and link-level performance evaluations.
Two typical network scenarios, including scenario 1 with LTE/NR DSS and
scenario 2 with NR/LTE deployed in neighbouring BSs/areas, are covered. 15 kHz
SCS and synchronous network are assumed in the phase I evaluation.
The inter-cell interference modelling methodology and interference profiles
from LTE CRS-IM receiver in homogenous deployments are reused. INR-_i_ (signal
level of the _i_ -th dominant interference over N~oc~) is used as the
interference power measure, and two dominant interferers are explicitly
modelled in the simulation.
The MMSE-IRC receiver is used to suppress the inter-cell interference for the
reference scheme without interference cell CRS handling and the CRS-RM
schemes. Three different CRS-RM schemes, including CRS-RM for 1 interference
cell always with the strongest interference, CRS-RM for 1 interference cell
not always with the strongest interference (optional), and CRS-RM for 2
strongest interference cells, are evaluated.
For CRS-IM schemes, interference cell CRS-IM is used together with MMSE-IRC
receiver, and CRS-IC and LLR weighting are considered as two different
implementations of CRS-IM.
PDSCH link-level simulations are performed to evaluate the performance gain of
CRS-RM and CRS-IM schemes over the reference scheme without interference cell
CRS handling. 8 simulation cases with different network scenarios, Rx antenna
numbers and MCS levels are included, and 7 CRS interference handling schemes
in addition to the reference scheme are evaluated for each simulation case.
RAN4 initial observations from link-level evaluation results for 15 kHz SCS
and synchronous network:
> • CRS-IC with the assumption of NW signaling can achieve better performance
> compared to RM scheme 1.
>
> • CRS-IC without NW assistant signaling achieve similar or lower performance
> compared to CRS-IC schemes with the assumption of NW signalling.
>
> • LLR weighting with the assumption of NW signaling can achieve better or
> similar performance compared to RM scheme 1.
>
> • LLR weighting without NW assistant signaling achieve similar or lower
> performance compared to LLR weighting with the assumption of NW signalling.
>
> • Note: RM scheme 1 is under the assumption that RM always applied for the
> strongest interference cell.
In addition, due to RM applied in interference cells, the CRS REs and data REs
under LTE cells will observe different interference level with SINR offset.
The interference mismatch among CRS REs and data REs may bring impact on LTE
cells considering the LTE CQI/RI/PMI reporting, PDSCH demodulation and
RSSI/RSRQ measurement. NW implementation solutions were provided by one
company to address LTE cell impact and the feasibility of such solutions from
network implementation perspective needs further discussion.
Based on these evaluations, it is recommended to define NR PDSCH demodulation
requirements for neighbouring cell LTE CRS-IM in scenarios with overlapping
spectrum for LTE and NR in Rel-17:
> • Use LLR weighting as baseline reference receiver, and further discuss the
> feasibility of CRS-IC receiver taking into account the UE complexity and
> PDSCH processing time.
>
> • Synchronous network scenario is prioritized. The asynchronous network
> scenario will be discussed after RAN #93e meeting.
>
> • 15 kHz SCS for NR is prioritized. The 30 kHz SCS scenario will be
> discussed after RAN #93e meeting.
>
> • RAN4 will further discuss the necessity of network assistance signaling
> and UE capability signaling during requirements definition phase.
