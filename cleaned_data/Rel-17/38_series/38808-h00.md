In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
In order to support wide range of services, 5G NR system aims to be flexible
enough to meet the connectivity requirements of a range of existing and future
(yet unknown) services to be deployable in an efficient manner. NR considers
supporting potential use of frequency range up to 100 GHz [1].
NR specifications that have been developed in Rel-15 and Rel-16 define
operation for frequencies up to 52.6 GHz, where all physical layer channels,
signals, procedures, and protocols are designed to be optimized for uses under
52.6 GHz.
However, frequencies above 52.6 GHz are faced with more difficult challenges,
such as higher phase noise, larger propagation loss due to high atmospheric
absorption, lower power amplifier efficiency, and strong power spectral
density regulatory requirements in unlicensed bands, compared to lower
frequency bands. Additionally, the frequency ranges above 52.6 GHz potentially
contain larger spectrum allocations and larger bandwidths that are not
available for bands lower than 52.6 GHz.
As an initial effort to enable and optimize 3GPP NR system for operation in
above 52.6 GHz, 3GPP RAN has studied requirements for NR beyond 52.6GHz up to
114.25GHz including global spectrum availability and regulatory requirements
(including channelization and licensing regimes), potential use cases and
deployment scenarios, and NR system design requirements and considerations on
top of regulatory requirements [2]. The potential use cases identified in the
study include high data rate eMBB, mobile data offloading, short range high-
data rate D2D communications, broadband distribution networks, integrated
access backhaul (IAB), factory automation, industrial IoT (IIoT), wireless
display transfer, augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) wearables,
intelligent transport systems (ITS) and V2X, data center inter-rack
connectivity, smart grid automation, private networks, and support of high
positioning accuracy. The use cases span over several deployment scenarios
identified in the study. The deployment scenarios include, but not limited to,
indoor hotspot, dense urban, urban micro, urban macro, rural, factor hall, and
indoor D2D scenarios. The study also identified several system design
requirements around waveform, MIMO operation, device power consumption,
channelization, bandwidth, range, availability, connectivity, spectrum regime
considerations, and others.
Among the frequencies of interest, frequencies between 52.6 GHz and 71 GHz are
especially interesting relatively in the short term because of their proximity
to sub-52.6 GHz for which the current NR system is optimized and the imminent
commercial opportunities for high data rate communications, e.g., unlicensed
spectrum but also licensed spectrum between 57 GHz and 71 GHz. Therefore, it
would be beneficial to make a study focused on feasibility of using existing
waveforms and required changes for frequencies between 52.6 GHz and 71 GHz, so
as to take advantage of imminent commercial opportunities for the specific
frequency regime by minimizing the specification burden and maximizing the
leverage of FR2 based implementations.

# 4 Study of required changes to NR
## 4.1 RAN1 Aspects
### 4.1.1 General description of study in RAN1
For supporting NR operation in both licensed and unlicensed bands in the
frequency range from 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz, FR2 numerologies and additional
numerologies beyond that are supported currently in NR are studied. The
existing framework for numerology scaling is considered i.e. 2^μ^ ×15
subcarrier spacing to select the candidates. For SSB transmissions, it is
investigated whether or not µ > 4 (larger than 240 kHz) is needed and the
corresponding impacts, if any, on aspects including at least SSB pattern,
multiplexing of other signal/channels, and transmission window, if supported.
For data and control channel transmissions, it is investigated if µ > 3
(larger than 120 kHz) is needed and the corresponding impacts, if any, on
aspects including at least processing timelines, PDCCH monitoring capability
(BD/CCE), scheduling enhancements, beam-management, and reference signal
design. For investigating the need for higher numerologies, some of the key
aspects that are studied are the impacts due to phase noise, delay spread,
TAE, analog beam switching delay, and impact to coverage, spectral efficiency,
peak data rates, and relative delay in intra-cell/inter-cell multi-TRP
operations.
For the study item, it is recommended to consider the study of at least the
following aspects, including the justification for the features and their
potential benefits, if applicable:
\- system overhead impact from TDD switching time for larger subcarrier
spacing,
\- coverage enhancement mechanisms for control channels and SSB, if larger SCS
is supported,
\- any potential modifications to HARQ processes including number of
processes, if supported,
\- impact from MAC buffering for larger subcarrier spacing, if any,
\- NR channelization/sub-channelization and any potential impact from RAN1
perspective,
\- additional RF impairments that impact evaluations,
\- impact on BWP switching procedure due to new higher SCS, if supported,
\- support of rank 2 transmission for DFT-s-OFDM in the uplink.
Other aspects and impacts due to introduction of higher SCS are not precluded.
### 4.1.2 Candidate numerology and bandwidth
#### 4.1.2.1 Subcarrier spacing and CP length
It was observed that amount of specification effort increases with the number
of new numerologies enabled and supported for 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz frequency.
In order to minimize specification effort while maximizing supported use cases
and deployment scenarios applicable for 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz frequency, it is
recommended to support 120 kHz subcarrier spacing with normal CP length, and
at least one more subcarrier spacing. It is recommended to consider supporting
at most up to three subcarrier spacings, including 120 kHz subcarrier spacing.
It is not recommended to consider support of only 240 kHz SCS for
PDCCH/PDSCH/PUCCH/PUSCH in addition to 120 kHz. Applicability of the supported
subcarrier spacing to particular signals and channels should be further
discussed in the corresponding WI phase.
It is recommended that numerologies 240 kHz, 480 kHz, and 960 kHz are
considered as candidates for additional numerologies in addition to 120 kHz,
and numerologies outside this range are not supported for any signals or
channels. It is also recommended that for subcarrier spacing 240 kHz or below,
normal CP length is utilized for candidate subcarrier spacings.
Selection of the additional subcarrier spacing (on top of 120 kHz) should
consider versatility of being able to support various applications and
deployment scenarios with all the subcarrier spacings that would be supported
by specification, accounting for what is already supported in Rel-15 and
Rel-16 specifications.
Some companies have noted that the ability for a deployed system to operate
with a single numerology for all channels and signals is beneficial, and some
companies have further noted benefit remains even if SSB numerology is
different. Some companies have noted mixed numerology operation is functional
and is supported in Rel-15 and Rel-16 specifications (e.g. 240 kHz SSB
subcarrier spacing with 120 kHz subcarrier spacing for
PDCCH/PDSCH/PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH in an initial BWP and activation of a dedicated
BWP with SCS different than the initial BWP) and consideration of single
numerology operation is not needed.
Overall implementation complexity for supporting a specific subcarrier spacing
may need to consider the following, but not limited to:
\- processing complexity for equalization including inter-carrier interference
mitigation (if required to support higher modulation orders) and compensation,
and FFT complexity per unit time for a given bandwidth,
\- complexity associated with supporting multiple component carriers to reach
a specific throughput,
\- complexity associated with supporting given reduced (in absolute time)
requirements on UE processing times (e.g. N1, N2, N3, Z1, Z2, Z3, etc) and UE
PDCCH processing budget as a function of subcarrier spacing, if scheduling and
monitoring unit is maintained to be one slot,
\- supported features indicated by UE capability signalling or implemented by
the gNB,
\- complexity associated with supporting required timing error tolerance which
may need to consider initial timing error, timing advance setting, TA
granularity, MIMO TAE (TAE value will be defined by RAN4), multi-TRP timing
alignment as a function of SCS, whether mixture or a single subcarrier spacing
for signals is configured, and deployment scenarios,
\- complexity associated with supporting higher sampling rates and with
channel bandwidth larger than 2 GHz.
It is observed that for a single carrier with the same number of transmitted
symbols, in general, smaller subcarrier spacing may potentially provide larger
coverage due to use of smaller bandwidth and gears towards (but not limited
to) coverage driven scenarios.
It is observed that for a single carrier, in general, larger subcarrier
spacing may potentially provide higher peak data rates due to use of larger
bandwidth and gears towards (but not limited to) peak data-rate driven
scenarios.
It is observed that in Rel-15 NR, absolute time for UE processing requirements
generally decrease as subcarrier spacing increases. Some companies noted that
introducing smaller UE processing time than Rel-15 and Rel-16, for larger
subcarrier spacing, may lead to a more complex UE implementation. Some
companies noted that per slot level monitoring for transmission and reception
may not likely be the only mode of operation for higher subcarrier spacing,
while some companies noted that per slot level monitoring for transmission and
reception may be used as a mode of operation in scenarios that require lower
latency.
It is observed that, in general, larger subcarrier spacing may have benefit of
short symbol/slot length to support lower latency requirements compared to
what was supported for Rel-15 and Rel-16 NR, assuming slot-level monitoring
subject to scheduling configurations and potentially UE processing
capabilities.
It is observed that, in general, channel access with shorter symbol duration
may access channel earlier when LBT is passed, assuming slot-level monitoring
and potentially subject to UE processing capabilities.
It is observed that, in general, larger subcarrier spacing has higher
resilience towards phase noise. Also, in general, the performance impact from
phase noise may depend on various properties of the transmission, such as
modulation order and coding rate, reception processing (e.g. CPE
compensation), and phase noise profile of the UE and gNB.
It is observed that, in general, maximum delay spread supported by a SCS is
proportional to its CP length and larger subcarrier spacing reduces the budget
for timing errors and beam switching, if beam switching delay within CP cannot
be avoided by gNB (e.g. by allocating a time gap), due to shorter CP. CP needs
to consider at least delay spread, timing errors (including Te), and timing
alignment errors applicable for a deployment scenario. Minimum requirements on
timing errors for new SCS values in > 52.6 GHz should be further studied in
RAN4 when specifications are developed.
Extended CP decreases the spectrum efficiency up to 14% compared to normal CP
of the same subcarrier spacing.
#### 4.1.2.2 Bandwidth and channelization
For the study item, it has been recommended to study single carrier and multi
carrier operations for achieving wide bandwidth utilization, while at least
considering aspects such as control signaling overhead, transceiver
complexity, spectral efficiency, etc.
In order to bound implementation complexity, it is recommended to limit the
maximum FFT size required to operate system in 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz frequency to
4096 and to limit the maximum number of RBs per carrier to 275 RBs. The
candidate supported maximum carrier bandwidth(s) for a cell should be between
400 MHz and 2160 MHz.
Some companies have noted support of channelization that are aligned with IEEE
802.11ad and 802.11ay channelization is beneficial for coexistence. While some
companies have noted alignment of channelization for coexistence is not
necessary. Alignment of channelization between a NR channel and IEEE 802.11ad
and 802.11ay channel in this context refers to a NR channel that is contained
within one of the channels defined for IEEE 802.11ad and 802.11ay and NR
channel bandwidth does not cross over channel boundaries of IEEE 802.11ad and
802.11ay.
One company has evaluated misaligned NR wideband channels with 1.6 GHz and 2
GHz without LBT and have not identified coexistence issues between NR and NR.
Some companies proposed that 2 GHz channel bandwidth should be supported and
have the raster points for 2 GHz channel bandwidth to be aligned with IEEE
802.11ad and 802.11ay channelization.
Some companies proposed that 1.6 GHz should be the maximum channel bandwidth
and channels do not necessarily need to be aligned with IEEE 802.11ad and
802.11ay channelizations.
Some companies observed that support of channel bandwidth such as 200 or 400
MHz may enable efficient usage of available spectrum by 3GPP technology. Some
companies observed that only supporting channelization that are aligned with
IEEE 802.11ad and 802.11ay channelization result in smaller number of
supported channels for some regions of the world.
Some companies have observed that channelization based on granularity of
minimum supported channel BW would be beneficial and could provide efficient
usage of available spectrum. Other companies have observed that support of
channel BW such as 1.6 GHz or 2.4GHz would enable efficient usage of 5 GHz
allocation in China and 5 GHz IMT allocation in Europe. Some companies have
observed that smaller bandwidth (e.g. 1.6 GHz) allows for more channels (e.g.,
with 1.6 GHz, 3 channels instead of two) in these regions, easing frequency
planning between operators at the cost of reduction in available channel
bandwidth per carrier.
Some companies proposed to support more than one channel bandwidths for a
given SCS.
Some companies observed that the relationship between channel bandwidth and
initial access aspects should be taken into account for the supported channel
bandwidth(s), especially for minimum channel bandwidth. Some companies
observed that a wider minimum channel bandwidth supported for a band may help
to limit the number of synchronization raster entries in the band, if the same
design principle for Rel-15 licensed bands applies. It should be noted that
minimum channel bandwidth and synchronization raster entries will be defined
by RAN4.
Available bandwidth within a given carrier for RMSI transmission for SSB and
CORESET multiplexing pattern 2 and 3 is smaller than available bandwidth for
multiplexing pattern 1. Some companies observed that the channel bandwidth
supported for a band should be wide enough to enable multiplexing e.g. between
SSB, CORESET0, and RMSI transmissions in multiplexing pattern 2 and 3. Some
companies observed that depending on the supported carrier bandwidth and
configured values of O and M, multiplexing pattern 1 can make available more
time/frequency resources for RMSI PDSCH in a slot than pattern 2 and 3. Some
companies observed that patterns 2 and 3 are more efficient than pattern 1 as
they may potentially minimize the broadcast overhead in time.
It is recommended that both single and multi-carrier operation are supported
to support higher data rates. Larger SCS may achieve larger aggregated
bandwidth with multi-carrier operation given a maximum number of CCs.
### 4.1.3 Investigation of physical layer impact from candidate numerology and
bandwidths
#### 4.1.3.1 General physical layer impacts
It is recommended to strive for maximum commonality for the system design for
licensed and unlicensed operation for NR from 52.6GHz to 71GHz, and maximize
re-use of the existing NR design.
Some companies noted that standardization effort to support 240 kHz, 480 kHz,
and 960 kHz numerologies are comparable. Some companies noted that
standardization effort for 240 kHz numerology could be relatively smaller
compared to 480 kHz or 960 kHz numerologies.
The following, which is not an exhaustive list, are some potential physical
layer impacts that are common to all numerologies:
\- supporting unlicensed operation,
\- if mixed numerology is supported, supporting mixed numerology operation,
\- SSB and CORESET#0 offsets needed for supported channelization.
The following, which is not an exhaustive list, are some potential physical
layer impact areas for each numerology:
\- For 120 kHz subcarrier spacing:
\- Potential consideration of PTRS enhancement for CP-OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM, if
needed.
\- For 240 kHz subcarrier spacing:
\- Potential consideration of PTRS enhancement for CP-OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM, if
needed,
\- If common SSB/CORESET#0 numerology (240/240) is supported, SSB patterns,
and CORESET#0 configuration,
\- RO configuration,
\- Timelines for scheduling, processing and HARQ,
\- Potential enhancement to DM-RS, if needed,
\- PDCCH monitoring.
\- For 480 kHz subcarrier spacing:
\- If 480 kHz SSB is supported, SSB patterns, and CORESET#0 configuration,
\- Timelines for scheduling, processing and HARQ,
\- RO configuration,
\- Potential enhancement to DM-RS, if needed,
\- PDCCH monitoring,
\- Potential consideration of PTRS enhancement for CP-OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM, if
needed.
\- For 960 kHz subcarrier spacing:
\- Potential consideration of ECP, if needed, depending on deployment
scenarios,
\- If 960 kHz SSB is supported, SSB patterns, and CORESET#0 configuration,
\- Timelines for scheduling, processing and HARQ,
\- RO configuration,
\- Potential enhancement to DM-RS, if needed,
\- PDCCH monitoring,
\- Potential updates to smallest time unit, Tc, used in specifications
depending on supported maximum carrier BW.
It was identified that support of the new subcarrier spacing, if agreed, will
at least require investigation on the need for enhancements and
standardization, of the following processing timelines:
\- processing capability for PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant,
\- dynamic SFI and SPS/CG cancellation timing,
\- timeline for HARQ-ACK information in response to a SPS PDSCH
release/dormancy,
\- minimum time gap for wake-up and Scell dormancy indication (DCI format
2_6),
\- BWP switch delay,
\- multi-beam operation timing (timeDurationForQCL, beamSwitchTiming, beam
switch gap, beamReportTiming, etc.),
\- timeline for multiplexing multiple UCI types,
\- minimum of P_switch for search space set group switching,
\- appropriate configuration(s) of k0 (PDSCH), k1 (HARQ), k2 (PUSCH),
\- PDSCH processing time (N1), PUSCH preparation time (N2), HARQ-ACK
multiplexing timeline (N3),
\- CSI processing time, Z1, Z2, and Z3, and CSI processing units,
\- any potential enhancements to CPU occupation calculation,
\- related UE capability(ies) for processing timelines,
\- minimum guard period between two SRS resources of an SRS resource set for
antenna switching.
#### 4.1.3.2 Physical layer impacts to synchronization and random access
For the study item, it is recommended to study on whether or not different SSB
patterns should be supported for licensed and unlicensed bands is needed. For
each licensed and unlicensed band, if issues are identified for reuse of
existing SSB, consider at least beam switching gap between SSB(s) and between
SSB and other signal(s)/channel(s), SSB pattern in time domain, and whether or
not it is needed to define a transmission window (such as DRS window), and if
needed, number of SSB transmission opportunities within a transmission window.
For each licensed and unlicensed band, if issues are identified for reuse of
all or some of the existing SSB and CORESET#0 multiplexing pattern, consider
at least the following aspects for SSB, CORESET#0, and other signal/channel
design:
\- Supported multiplexing pattern type(s) (Pattern 1, 2, and/or 3) for SSB and
CORESET#0 multiplexing,
\- Multiplexing of other signal/channels (e.g. RMSI, paging, CSI-RS) with SSB,
\- Configuration of Type0-PDCCH search space set.
For the study item, it is recommended to at least consider the following
aspects for determination of supported SSB subcarrier spacing:
\- detection performance of SSB (including PSS, SSS, PBCH DMRS, and PBCH) and
SSB coverage requirement,
\- impact on initial cell search complexity due to frequency errors (e.g.
carrier frequency offset, Doppler shift, etc),
\- timing detection accuracy and its relation to uplink transmission accuracy,
\- signaling design for supporting different subcarrier spacing for SSB and
CORESET#0 (if supported),
\- multi-TRP delay considerations,
\- consideration of SSB-based RRM/RLM and beam management if the SSB SCS is
significantly different from that of the active BWP (e.g., switching gap,
scheduling constraint, etc.).
For the study item, it is recommended to consider the at least following
aspects for PRACH design of NR operating in 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz:
\- PRACH coverage requirements,
\- applicable PRACH Sequence length(s) and subcarrier spacing(s) for PRACH,
including any impact on PRACH coverage and capacity from the applicable
sequence length(s),
\- RACH RO configurations with new SCS (if new SCS is supported),
\- LBT gap between RACH occasions (RO).
Some companies noted SSB SCS selection should consider SCS of data/control
channels and enablement of single subcarrier spacing operation.
Some companies noted support and use of (120 kHz,120kHz) or (240kHz,120kHz)
for the pair of SSB SCS and CORESET#0 SCS in initial BWP, and activation of
dedicated BWP with an SCS for data/control different than the initial BWP may
enable re-use of existing NR specification and minimize standardization
effort.
It was identified to further investigate considerations of SSB patterns, if
needed, considering:
\- unlicensed band operation if LBT is required for SSB, e.g. SSB cycling
transmission within a DRS transmission window,
\- beam switching time between SSB,
\- coverage of SSB,
\- multiplexing of SSB with CORESET and UL transmissions.
In order to benefit from higher transmit power, when maximum PSD regulatory
requirements exist, RAN1 recommends support of longer PRACH sequence lengths,
L=571 and L=1151, defined in Rel-16 NR specification, to be used for NR
operating in 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz.
It is recommended to not support interlace design for PRACH for NR operating
in 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz. It is recommended to further investigate whether or not
to support configurations that enable non-consecutive RACH occasions in time
domain to aid LBT processes if LBT is required.
Some companies noted that PRACH SCS selection should consider SCS of
data/control channels and enablement of single subcarrier spacing operation.
Some companies noted that 120 kHz SCS for PRACH (even if data/control channel
may have different SCS) may be sufficient to support NR operating in 52.6 GHz
to 71 GHz from coverage perspective.
It was identified that potential enhancements for PRACH should consider system
coverage for PRACH with subcarrier spacing larger than 120 kHz, if supported.
#### 4.1.3.3 Physical layer impacts to PDSCH and PUSCH
For the study item, it is recommended to study of frequency domain scheduling
enhancements/optimization for PDSCH/PUSCH, if needed, e.g. potential impact to
UL scheduling if frequency domain resource allocation with different
granularity than FR1/2 (e.g. sub-PRB, or more than one PRB) is supported, and
study of time domain scheduling enhancements for PDSCH/PUSCH, if needed, e.g.
increasing the minimum time-domain scheduling unit to be larger than one
symbol, supporting multi-PDSCH scheduled by one DCI, supporting one TB mapped
to multiple slots (i.e., TTI bundling).
Some companies have noted that interlace transmissions for PUSCH do not
provide benefit over non-interlaced uplink allocations currently supported by
NR for NR operating in 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz, while some companies have noted
support of sub-PRB or PRB interlace transmissions for PUSCH may improve
transmit power and possibly meets OCB requirements (some companies note OCB
requirements can be met without introducing interlacing) when necessary.
It was identified that new subcarrier spacing, if agreed, may require further
investigation of multi-PDSCH/PUSCH scheduling and standardization, if needed.
The following aspects should be at least investigated for multi-PDSCH/PUSCH
scheduling:
\- whether to support a single TB and/or multiple TBs scheduled over multiple
slots,
\- applicable DCI format(s) (including potential new formats, if needed) for
multi-PDSCH and multi-PUSCH scheduling,
\- enhancement on multiple beam indication and association with multiple
PDSCH/PUSCH scheduling,
\- DM-RS enhancements such as DM-RS bundling, or changes to the time-domain
pattern,
\- HARQ enhancements for multi-PDSCH,
\- applicability of Rel-16 multi-PUSCH scheduling.
#### 4.1.3.4 Physical layer impacts to PDCCH
For the study item, it is recommended to study the following aspects for new
SCS for PDCCH that are not supported in Rel-15/16 NR, if agreed:
\- investigate on the maximum number of BDs/CCEs for PDCCH monitoring per time
unit, e.g. slot as Rel-15, or new scheduling/monitoring unit,
\- any potential limitation to PDCCH monitoring configurations (e.g. search
spaces, DCI formats, overbooking/dropping, etc) to help with UE processing, if
needed, e.g. increased minimum PDCCH monitoring unit,
\- potential enhancements for CORESET, if needed,
\- related UE capability(ies) for PDCCH processing.
It was identified that the potential enhancements to PDCCH monitoring
including potential limitation to UE PDCCH configuration, multiple PDSCH/PUSCH
scheduling with a single DCI (using existing DCI formats or new DCI
format(s)), spatial relation management for GC-PDCCH, capability related to
PDCCH monitoring, and PDCCH coverage should be further investigated for higher
subcarrier spacings, including the need for such enhancements.
It was observed that PDCCH processing capabilities per multiple slots for
larger SCS (e.g. 480 or 960 kHz) can maintain scheduling framework same as for
smaller SCS (e.g. 120 kHz) when the UE is configured to monitor the PDCCH
every multiple slot.
#### 4.1.3.5 Physical layer impacts to PUCCH
It is recommended to further investigate potential enhancements to PUCCH to
enable higher transmission power when regulatory limits apply. Majority of the
sources have identified PUCCH format 0, 1, and 4 as potential candidates for
enhancement. Two sources have identified all PUCCH formats as potential
candidates for enhancement. Further potential enhancements to spatial relation
management for configured and/or semi-persistent UL signals/channels may be
considered.
#### 4.1.3.6 Physical layer impacts to reference signals
For the study item, it is recommended to consider at least the following
aspects of PT-RS design for a given SCS:
\- phase noise compensation performance of existing PT-RS design,
\- study of need of any modification/changes to existing PT-RS design,
including:
\- potential modification to the PT-RS pattern or configuration to aid
performance improvement for CP-OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM waveforms (if needed),
\- potential methods to aid ICI compensation at the receiver (if needed).
For the study item, it is recommended to consider at least the following
aspects of DM-RS design for a given SCS:
\- Channel estimation performance of existing DM-RS design with existing and
new SCSs (if any),
\- Study whether there is a need of any modification/changes to existing DM-RS
design, including potential modification or introduction of new DM-RS pattern,
and configuration or indication to aid performance improvement for CP-OFDM and
DFT-S OFDM waveforms (if needed).
It is recommended to further investigate the need for DL and UL PT-RS
enhancement for the subcarrier spacings to be supported in specifications. PT-
RS enhancements, if needed, can consider the following:
\- support of high MCS values,
\- applicability of ICI compensation techniques,
\- PT-RS sequence,
\- time and frequency resources for PT-RS with OFDM and DFT-s-OFDM waveforms.
It is recommended to further investigate the need for DL and UL DM-RS
enhancements for the subcarrier spacings to be supported in specifications.
DM-RS enhancements, if needed, can consider the following:
\- coherence bandwidth and its impact to orthogonal codes used for DM-RS,
\- frequency domain density and overhead,
\- maximum number of DM-RS ports.
Some companies noted LBT failure may prevent transmission of periodic
reference signals, such as P-TRS, and negatively impact performance. Some
companies noted deferral of periodic reference signals may be rare and may not
significantly impact system performance. Some companies noted aperiodic
reference signals could be used to negate the potential impact from LBT
failure.
#### 4.1.3.7 Physical layer impacts to beam management and CSI
For the study item, it is recommended to study potential enhancements or
alternatives to the scheduling request mechanism to reduce scheduling latency
due to beam sweeping, if needed.
For the study item, it is recommended to consider at least the following
aspects in system operations with beams:
\- study of BFR mechanism enhancements, if supported,
\- e.g., the use of aperiodic CSI-RS for BFR, increased number of RSs for
monitoring/candidates and efficient utilization of the increased number of
RSs, enhanced reliability to cope with narrower beamwidth,
\- study of UE capabilities on beam switch timing in beam management
procedure,
\- study of enhancements for beam management and corresponding RS(s) in DL and
UL are needed further considering at least the following aspects, if
supported:
\- beam switching time, beam alignment delay (including initial access), LBT
failure, and potential coverage loss (if large SCS is supported),
\- study of beam switching gap handling for signals/channels (e.g. CSI-RS,
PDSCH, SRS, PUSCH) for higher subcarriers spacing, if supported.
It is recommended to further investigate potential enhancements, if needed, to
beam management at least considering one or more of potentially narrower
beamwidths, CP duration, multiple beam indications for multi-PUSCH/PDSCH
scheduling, triggering of reference signals for beam management, enhancements
to beam management for random access procedure, intra- and/or inter-cell
mobility, and adaptation to LBT failures. Minimum requirement on beam
switching delay in > 52.6 GHz spectrum should be further studied by RAN4 when
specification is further developed.
It is recommended to investigate whether or not enhancements to CSI processing
unit (CPU) availability check is needed when the UE is required to process CSI
reports corresponding to multiple numerologies across active BWPs in different
component carriers.
## 4.2 RAN4 aspects
### 4.2.1 General description of study in RAN4
RAN4 and RAN1 had one common objective for the study on supporting NR from
52.6 GHz to 71 GHz, which is reproduced here from study item description.
\- Study of required changes to NR using existing DL/UL NR waveform to support
operation between 52.6 GHz and 71 GHz
\- Study of applicable numerology including subcarrier spacing, channel BW
(including maximum BW), and their impact to FR2 physical layer design to
support system functionality considering practical RF impairments [RAN1,
RAN4].
Aligned with this objective, RAN4 has studied practical RF impairments and
captured relevant technology status in this TR. On top of aspects impacting
FR2 physical layer design, aspects impacting RAN4 requirements have also been
considered and documented.
### 4.2.2 Timing considerations
#### 4.2.2.1 General aspects
During the study item timing aspects were evaluated with the goal of providing
observations and guidance on which technical topics need to be considered in
the work item phase when timing related requirements are agreed. The evaluated
topics were cell phase synchronization, base station timing alignment error,
analog beam switching delay, UE timing advance operation and transient
periods.
#### 4.2.2.2 Transient period
It was concluded during the SI, that improvements for transient period should
be evaluated and the final agreement for transient period requirements shall
be made during the work item.
For transient period, the existing FR2 transient periods, i.e., 5 uS for UE
and 3 uS for BS, might not applicable with higher subcarrier spacings, i.e.,
480 and 960 kHz. As an example, 5 uS transient period is corresponding to 240
% of an OFDM symbol duration with 480 kHz SCS. Considering a pair of ON-to-OFF
and OFF-to-ON, this 5 uS transient period means that the first 4 OFDM symbols
and 80 % of the fifth OFDM symbol are affected and cannot be used for data
transmission. This causes significant system throughput degradation with
higher SCS. In order to improve system performance, shorter transient period
needs to be investigated in 52.6 -- 71 GHz. Specification of transient periods
during WI has to consider not only the general ON/OFF mask at start and end
slot, during TDD DL/UL boundaries, used in guard period (GP) timing, but also
other use cases related to UE UL, like SRS time mask and PUSCH-PUCCH and SRS
time mask.
Table 4.2.2.2-1 Performance implication of transient for different subcarrier
spacings
**Subcarrier spacing (kHz)** **120** **480** **960**
* * *
Slot duration (uS) 125.00 31.25 15.63 OFDM symbol duration (uS) 8.33 2.08 1.04
CP duration (uS) 0.60 0.15 0.07 OFDM symbol + CP (uS) 8.93 2.23 1.12 Tp
portion in OFDM symbol - 5 uS 60.0% 240.0% 480.0% Tp portion in OFDM symbol -
3 uS 36.0% 144.0% 288.0% Tp portion in OFDM symbol - 1 uS 12.0% 48.0% 96.0%
#### 4.2.2.3 Cell synchronization
Guard-period is also related to cell phase synchronization and transient
period as for overlapping cells, cell synchronization error needs to be taken
into account as it contributes to the possibility of BS-to-BS and UE-to-UE
interference if guard period for DL-UL pattern is not configured
appropriately. Due to smaller cell sizes in the frequency range (and therefore
shorter propagation delays), the probability of such interference is reduced.
Higher SCS provides more opportunities to achieve optimal configuration for
with minimal overhead when compared to lower SCS due to the reduced symbol
duration. It should be noted that extremely low latencies are not required in
all use cases, e.g. if the optimization target is achieving high throughput.
High throughput made possible by extremely wide available bandwidths appears
as an attractive and feasible design target possibly to be prioritized over
improved latency. As the network has control over the guard period, a
motivation to re-visit cell-phase synchronization was not found during the SI.
#### 4.2.2.4 BS Analog beam switching
In FR2 beam switching is assumed to take place during CP. When the SCS
increases the CP duration decreases accordingly. There are two separate
scenarios for the beam switching. Firstly, in initial access specific
consideration is required since the SSB structure cannot be changed based on
the gNB scheduler decision. The bottom line is that the phase shifters can
change state in few ns when using the technology already available today,
however the complete radio system will require more time than this, to change
state. In Rel-15 it was captured in TR 38.817-02 [101] that GaAs switched
phase shifters react in approximately 10ns. In other cases, based on the need,
gNB can reserve a separate guard time (one or more full symbols) for beam
switching. Often, the beam switching can happen during the guard time reserved
for the link direction switching. It can be noted that the granularity to
adjust the switching gap increases with the increasing SCS. Based on that, a
high SCS has opportunities for smaller guard period (GP) overhead compared to
a low SCS.
TR 38.817-02 also has captured simulation results that to prevent degradation
to system performance, switching time must be less than 80% of the CP length.
For 960 kHz SCS this results in approximately 59 ns time window. Given that 10
ns is given for the phase shifter to react, there is still sufficient time
available that all the delays of the phase shifter control interface can be
accommodated and no explicit switching gap is needed between successive SSB
blocks.
Based on the discussion, both 480 kHz and 960 kHz SCS are feasible from beam
switching point of view.
#### 4.2.2.5 BS Time alignment error (TAE)
Another aspect of phase synchronization is MIMO operation and related TAE
requirements. The MIMO TAE requirement should be specified with the
consideration of the implementation/deployment scenarios.
Current BS OTA TAE requirements in clause 9.6.3 of TS 38.104 specify 65 ns for
MIMO transmission [99]. It has been discussed in [100] that the current
requirement has been in place since UMTS and is the same as quarter of the
UMTS chip rate time, i.e. 65 ns matches to 1/(4x3.84) Mcps rate. Improvement
in performance has taken place in the past 20 years, and therefore it would be
reasonable to consider improvements to TAE requirements.
#### 4.2.2.6 UE timing error
The existing PHY-layer specifications for UE timing advance are defined to be
scalable with SCS, i.e. the update granularity becomes more accurate when SCS
increases. Overall, for 52.6-71 GHz it is necessary to consider UE timing
advance requirements, including UE initial access timing error limit, BS
controlled timing advance, UE autonomous timing adjustment requirements, and
the aggregated adjustment rate during work item, taking into account the SCS
selection.
In order to analyze feasibility of new SCS and not to propose specific timing
requirements, example simulations were performed. The analysis of the UL
timing error sources can be performed by considering the combination of the
timing uncertainty due to the timing advance resolution TA_step = $16 \bullet
64 \bullet T_{c}/2^{\mu}$, the transmit timing accuracy Te given by Table
7.1.2-1 of 38.133 [98], and the TA command accuracy TTA e defined in Table
7.3.2.2-1 of 38.133 [98]. The requirements for Te and TTA e are not yet
specified, but they can be extrapolated considering the existing values in
38.133. One example of such extrapolations is represented in Table 4.2.2.6-1
and Table 4.2.2.6-2 and were used as simulation input, for the evaluation
shown here. However, the UE timing requirements proposed in the following
table would be revisited in the WI phase.
Table 4.2.2.6-1 Extrapolated timing error limit values based on Table 7.1.2-1
of 38.133 [98] used as the simulation input

**UE Timing Advance adjustment accuracy** ±8 T~c~ ±4 T~c~
Considering the extrapolated accuracy limits of Table 4.2.2.6-1 and 4.2.2.6-2,
it is possible to evaluate the composed UL timing error. Table 4.2.2.6-3
presents the results for this evaluation, considering 2 test scenarios. In the
first test scenario the timing advance accuracy T~TA\ e~ was considered. In
that case, the combined UL timing error is determined in the simulations
considering that a UE has a random initial timing which is corrected by the
timing advance command. Once the TA command is applied by the UE, the UE
transmits in UL with an error that is modelled as uniformly distributed in the
range ±T~TA\ e~. The resulting error is analysed in Table 4.2.2.6-3 using the
5^th^ and 95^th^ percentiles, which indicates the range where the UL transmit
errors would be contained. These results indicate that by using the
extrapolated requirements of Table 4.2.2.6-2, the UL error due to TA accuracy
requirement would be mostly contained within ±5.8% of the CP length for 480
kHz and 960 kHz, which is in within the same error ranges observed for the
existing SCSs from 15 kHz to 120 kHz.

The second scenario is considering the UE initial transmission timing error,
which applies for the first transmission in a DRX cycle, or for a PRACH or
msgA transmission. Just like in the analysis done for the TA errors, the
simulations consider a UE with random initial timing, which is corrected using
a TA command. On top of this initial error given by TA command resolution, the
UE is considered to transmit with an additional error given by a uniformly
distributed random error in the range ±Te. Table 4.2.2.6-3 presents the error
ranges for the resulting error for a several sub-carrier spacings. It can be
noted from Table 4.2.2.6-3 that the resulting UL error is contained on the
range ±20% of the CP length for 480 kHz and 960 kHz SCS. This error range is
in line with what is obtained with other SCS values, like for 60 kHz, which
has an error in the range ±25% for a 15 kHz SCS SSB.
### 4.2.3 Phase noise characteristics
The actual LO-architecture of an antenna array can vary ranging from a single
LO driving the whole antenna array up to small sub-arrays each having their
own LO. When multiple LOs are considered, the phase noise output of those can
have a varying degree of correlation. The LO-structure is an implementation
specific aspect and does not need to be considered in the standard.
In the SI additional technical background to consider have been identified.
Based on technical input following phase noise input sets have been identified
for analysis in RAN1 and RAN4:
1) Set based on BS and UE PN model presented in clause 4.2.3.1.
2) Set based on BS PN model based on TR 38.803 Ex-2 and UE PN model presented
in clause 4.2.3.2.
3) Set based on TR 38.803 Ex-2 PN model for both UE and BS
In addition, more information has been collected in clause 4.2.3.3.
None of the models have been agreed as the RAN4 phase noise model. It was
identified that the UE PN is higher compared to BS regardless of the model.
RAN4 was not able to agree on a single representative phase noise model during
the study item but concluded that both commercially available components and
scientific publications should be taken into account when the representative
phase noise performance is considered during the work item phase.
#### 4.2.3.1 Phase noise model set 1
To be able to derive an up-to-date phase noise model for 70 GHz many
references published in leading IEEE conferences, journals and other
conference papers from 2015 to 2020 have been investigated [76 to 90]. Figure
4.2.3.1-1 depicts all the published state-of-the-art phase noise
characteristics scaled to 70 GHz where references covered a large variety of
frequencies. The scaling is performed by adding a term 20*log(70GHz/_f_ ~0~)
dB to the phase published phase noise data, where _f_ ~0~ is the frequency of
operation where the phase noise was measured.

Figure 4.2.3.1-3 represents heat coloring with respect to PLL output
frequencies.

Note that the intention is not only to present the input data to derive a
relevant phase noise model but also to later demonstrate relevant published
high performing state-of-the-art PLL characteristics in comparison with
existing models as well as a new up-to-date model.
Using the input data described above and eq. 4.2.3.1-1 a parametrized phase
noise model (set 1) is defined. In figure 4.2.3.14 the design margin for BS
was set to 0 dB and design margin for UE was set to 5 dB.
$S\left( f_{o} \right) = \text{PSD}0\frac{\prod_{n = 1}^{N}\left( 1 +
{(\frac{f_{o}}{f_{z,n}})}^{\alpha_{z,n}} \right)}{\prod_{m = 1}^{M}\left( 1 +
{(\frac{f_{o}}{f_{p,m}})}^{\alpha_{p,m}} \right)}$ (Eq. 4.2.3.1-1)

The new proposed phase noise model matches the published low power consumption
state-of-the-art PLL performance very well where both the new parameterized
model as well as an average characteristics of input data is presented in
figure 4.2.3.1-5.

data
#### 4.2.3.2 Phase noise model set 2
Theoretically, PN model is an additive curve which dominates by different part
of PLL, Ex-2 in TR 38.803 provides the fabrication model with clearly
domination factor. When frequency offset \ LoopBW, the PN model is
dominated by VCO, and the PN model curve is further adjusted by divider noise,
etc. However, we can find that the PN model is not purely a curve of 2
sections but a complicated and additive issue.
From measurements/simulation on 70GHz UE PLL, PN model can be easily generated
by multi-pole/zero model with slight parameter revision. For lower frequency
offset(1000Hz), phase noise is about -61dBc, while for large offset phase
noise is constant at -140dBc. The LoopBW is lower than model Ex1 of TR 38.803,
and larger than model Ex2 of TR 38.803. The comparison can be seen as in
figure 4.2.3.2-1.

The phase noise profile in figure 4.2.3.2-1 can be parameterised using
multiple zero-pole equation (Eq. 4.2.3.2-1) and parameters are listed in Table
4.2.3.2-1.
$S\left( f_{o} \right) = \text{PSD}0\frac{\prod_{n = 1}^{N}{1 +

### 4.2.3.3 Additional information
Additionally, some data published in scientific forums and commercial
component data sheets have been provided in [88][89][90].When looking at the
data sources it should be taken into account that here the data includes
components from different cost and performance categories. For components in
[88] and [89] are high-cost and high performance. Various categories are
included to improve the understanding on how the performance can vary based on
design choices. Regarding UE performance, [90] would be the most appropriate
comparison point as it has also low current consumption.
Comparison of the phase noise characteristics is provided in Figure 4.2.3.3-1.
In the figure all models are scaled to operate at 70 GHz centre frequency by
using the well-known 20 dB per decade phase noise increase when frequency is
shifted.
{width="6.688195538057743in" height="4.391666666666667in"}
Figure 4.2.3.3-1: Comparison of various proposed phase noise models and some
example components
It can be also observed that the \"knee frequency\", i.e. the loop filter
bandwidth is lower in TR 38.803 models than seen in commercial components. It
appears that the 20 dB / dec slope begins at or slightly below 1 MHz offset
frequency in most cases. It also appears that the noise floor is rather high
in models presented in TR 38.803.
Overall, it is obvious that in reality the phase noise performance will vary
between implementations. Therefore, when representative performance is
evaluated, the results based on which the model is derived cannot be too
tightly filtered, for example selecting only sources showing worst
performance. As seen in Figure 4.2.3.3-1, commercial components tend to
exhibit better performance than scientifically published low-power
implementations.
When the models more suited for BS operation are taken and a curve is fitted
to them, the result is as shown by a bold black curve in Figure 4.2.3.3-2.
This PN model does not exhibit excessively high low frequency noise, has the
loop filter cut-off frequency just below 1 MHz and a reasonable noise floor at
very high frequency offsets. The pole-zero model used here is described next.
$S\left( f_{o} \right) = \text{PSD}0\frac{\prod_{n = 1}^{N}\left( 1 +
{(\frac{f_{o}}{f_{z,n}})}^{\alpha_{z,n}} \right)}{\prod_{m = 1}^{M}\left( 1 +
{(\frac{f_{o}}{f_{p,m}})}^{\alpha_{p,m}} \right)}$ (Eq. 4.2.3.3-1)
Where _S_ is the single sideband phase noise power spectral density, fo the
offset frequency, _f_ ~z,1~ .. _f_ ~z,N~ the zeros, _f_ ~p,1~ .. _f_ ~p,M~ the
poles, _α_ ~z,1~ .. _α_ ~z,N~ the order of the zeros, and _α_ ~p,1~ .. _α_

### 4.2.4 Power amplifiers trends
The PA technology trends are based on PA performance survey in [74]. The
referred PA survey captures a large power amplifier database consisting of
more than 3400 data points with over 1200 data points for CMOS, SiGe PAs and
over 1700 power amplifier data points has been collected for GaN, GaAs, InP.
This database covers published results, both from the open literature, as well
as commercial amplifiers from various vendors.
Based on the information in [74], the PA database information was summarized
for all the considered RF technologies in figure 4.2.4-1 and 4.2.4-2, where
the 52.6 -- 71 GHz frequency range was highlighted. It can be observed that
based on the available information, there is no data for the LDMOS technology
for the 52.6 -- 71 GHz range.
In order to derive more accurate PA trends data, figure 4.2.4-1 was plotted
with PA operating frequencies much wider than just 52.6 -- 71 GHz range. More
detailed technology-specific plots (e.g. PAE vs. Psat, or Psat vs. frequency)
can be found in the Excel spreadsheet capturing all the PA survey data in
[74].

Based on the analysis of the achievable Psat trends over the 52.6 -- 71 GHz
range, the saturated output power maximum trend values for 52.6 GHz and 71 GHz
from [74] were extracted in table 4.2.4-1.

The same dataset used for peak power trends was used to study the efficiency
of available semiconductor technologies. In Figure 4.2.4-3, a scatter diagram
of peak Power Added Efficiency (PAE) as function of operating frequency for
power amplifiers made using Silicon and semiconductor transistors (GaAs and
GaN). As expected, the efficiency is mainly dependent on the operating
frequency and not the transistor technology. The wide spread of data is mainly
due to different power levels and different amplifier architectures.

Figure 4.2.4-3: Peak power added efficiency versus frequency for power
amplifiers using Silicon transistors (left) and GaN and GaAs transistors
(right)
The trend analysis indicates that from a technological perspective the power
amplifier efficiency in the frequency range 52 to 71 GHz is worse compared to
FR2. The need for AAS type of products for this frequency range, as well as
high level of integration in limited space, requires care for thermal design
and considerations.
As shown, with the support from both empirical data and theoretically
established limits we know that that both power efficiency and RF saturated
output power capability decrease with increasing frequency. The choice of
process technology used in fabricating the PAs may offset the capabilities at
a given frequency but the trends versus frequency of operation remains.
### 4.2.5 BS aspects
#### 4.2.5.1 BS antenna arrays
More detailed antenna array modelling may be further considered in work item
if needed.
BS antenna array configurations were evaluated with respect to target output
power. It is assumed that each antenna array element has its own power
amplifier. The loss associated with the transmission between the power
amplifier and element is included in the element loss factor. The EIRP can be
calculated as shown in Table 4.2.5.1-1. The example in table 4.2.5.1-1 are
provided for 8x16, 16x16, 32x32 element arrays, and the same principle can be
used to evaluate the array sizes required to reach 40 dBm and 60 dBm EIRP,
which were set for targets for system evaluations according to annex A.2 The
result is that reaching 40 dBm EIRP per polarization requires at least an 4x8
element array whereas 60 dBm EIRP per polarization requires at least 16x16
element array.
It should be noted that the estimates are very conservative, given that the
power amplifier study [74] as captured in clause 4.2.4 outlines the saturated
power for CMOS technology between 22 and 23 dBm for 52.6 \-- 71 GHz frequency
range. Therefore, plenty of design margin for possible front-end losses have
been included.

example and may not include all aspects of real implementations, as not
identified during the study phase.
Total radiated power (TRP) is calculated in dBm as: $\mathbf{\text{TRP}} =
\mathbf{P} + \mathbf{3} - \mathbf{L}_{\mathbf{E}}$, where P is the total
conducted power per polarization in dBm, LE is the element loss factor in dB
and 3 is a factor accounting for two polarizations.
The BS antenna array examples in Table 4.2.5.1-1 are not restricted to the BS
antenna array configurations and antenna array patterns in annex A.2 (i.e.
System level simulations assumptions), which were defined for the purpose of
performance evaluations in RAN1 and are not intended to restrict
implementation freedom. The EIRP evaluations are based on an assumption that
the full array is used to form a single beam. It could be possible to use the
32x32 array as four 16x16 sub-arrays, each forming a separate beam and then
EIRP of each beam would be equivalent to the 16x16 array example. The examples
are not intended to form a baseline for possible co-existence evaluations.
The array sizes are similar to FR2 array in 24.25 -- 52.6 GHz frequency range,
and therefore also the beamwidths are similar. Therefore, no need was found to
start further studies on antenna array modelling and or other antenna
evaluations. If there is a need, BS antenna models from TR 38.803 [73] can be
re-used.
#### 4.2.5.2 Noise figure
Considering recent state-of-the-art LNA-only noise figure publications in [91
to 96], figure 4.2.5.2-1 presents the LNA-only noise figure for different
semi-conductor technologies over frequency based on published data.
{width="3.6083333333333334in" height="3.079861111111111in"}
Figure 4.2.5.2-1: LNA-only NF trend over frequency
It can be seen that when LNA-only noise figures are compared to the typical
noise figures in Table 4.2.5.2-1, there is a significant difference. This
difference implies significant pre- and post-LNA losses from routing and other
sources.
Referring to ETSI technical report TR 101 854 [75] on fixed radio point-to-
point systems, one can find information on typical NF and associated
industrial margins (IM~F~) values across wide range of frequencies. The IM~F~
considers various performance variations of system elements over e.g.
temperature extremes, voltage variations, or aging by capturing production
spread of RF circuits.
For the 52.6 -- 71 GHz range, the above NF values are in range of 10 -- 13 dB.
Table 4.2.5.2-1: Typical Noise Figures (NF) and associated Industrial Margins
(IM~F~)
+--------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | **Frequency band** | **Typical Noise |** Industrial margin | | | Figure (NF)**| (IM~F~)** | | **(GHz)** | | | | | **(dB)** | **(dB)** | +====================+=======================+=======================+ | 48 - 50 | \~9 | +3 | +--------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | 52 - 55 | \~10 | +3 | +--------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | 71 - 76 | \~13 | +4 | +--------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+ | 81 - 86 | \~13 | +4 | +--------------------+-----------------------+-----------------------+
NOTE: The above ETSI originated Industrial Margins (IM~F~) shall not be
confused with the Implementation Margins (IM) used in process of RAN4
conformance requirements derivation.
Referring to the system level evaluation assumptions in annex A, the BS NF was
assumed as 7 dB, while UE NF was assumed as 10 dB (13 dB optionally).
Link level and system level simulation assumptions in annex A are assuming UE
mobility (i.e. 3km/h), while the above referred ETRI TR treats about the fixed
point-to-point applications. Still one can observe good alignment of NF values
among the ETSI TR and those in this 52.6-71 GHz performance evaluation. This
can be interpreted that the RF technology to be used for both static and
mobile applications in 52.6-71 GHz frequency range will have similar and
comparable capabilities, making the ETSI TR 101 854 [75] a valid reference for
this technical report.
#### 4.2.5.3 Output power and ACLR dependencies
To initially investigate the dependencies between output power, linearity and
PAE, the empirical measurements of a 28 nm FD-SOI CMOS PA from a research
project was used to model the behavior at 70 GHz proxy frequency where the
non-linear characteristics is kept with the output power scaled as -20
dB/decade while PAE scaled as \~-5dB /decade. CP-OFDM waveform at 400 MHz
carrier bandwidth was used.
For 70 GHz proxy frequency, the example of relationship between ACLR and
output power is presented in Figure 4.2.5.3-1. It should be noted that the
output power is related to PA output (including package losses) and does not
consider losses such as routing, switch losses etc. implying that the
achievable power before the radiating elements could be lower.
As shown in Figure 4.2.5.3-1, the achievable output power decreases with
increased ACLR. Figure 4.2.5.3-1 depicts the example of relation between ACLR
and PAE. The examples in these figures should be considered as illustrative of
the general trends, while the absolute numbers should not be derived from
those examples, given that they are based on a single measurement of one

#### 4.2.5.4 BS architecture
Referring to the NR BS operating in FR2 (i.e. 24250 -- 52600 MHz), the BS type
2-O was defined based on the AAS architecture, only. The non-AAS architecture
was out-ruled for FR2 due to practical reasons of its implementation at high
frequencies, related complexity of connectorized antenna arrays, etc. For more
background information on the BS architecture for the NR operation in FR2,
refer to TR 38.817-02 [101].
Considering NR operation in 52.6 -- 71 GHz range, it is assumed that the BS
type 2-O architecture (i.e. the AAS BS architecture) will be considered as the
baseline.
Referring to deployment scenarios considered for 52.6 -- 71 GHz range, one can
notice that there may be need to consider BS products specifically targeting
indoor scenarios (e.g. for potential BS products optimized for low cost indoor
deployments). For such scenarios potential re-consideration of the BS
architecture assumptions is left for WI phase.
### 4.2.6 UE aspects
#### 4.2.6.1 UE power amplifiers
While Figure 4.2.4-1 shows saturated output power depending on carrier
frequency, it is useful to compare the PA efficiency and saturated power
between FR2 and the 52.6 to 71 GHz frequency range to provide different angle.
Figure 4.2.6.1-1 shows data between 20 and 50 GHz, and Figure 4.2.6.1-2 shows
above 50 GHz.

{width="6.7in" height="3.61in"}
Figure 4.2.6.1-2 >50 GHz PAs
Comparing the figures, we can see that both power efficiency and saturated
power tend to decrease for PAs in frequency above 52.6 GHz compared to FR2
which is aligned with the observation in clause 4.2.4.
### 4.2.7 Numerologies and Channel Bandwidths
During the study item phase analysis on RF impairments and co-existence were
discussed and studied in consideration of numerology and channel bandwidth
selection.
The following are minimum and maximum channel bandwidths for different
numerologies as described in Table 4.2.7-1. The values in Table 4.2.7-1 are
considered for both licensed and unlicensed conditions.
Table 4.2.7-1: Minimum and maximum channel bandwidths for supported
numerologies
**Subcarrier spacing [kHz]** **Minimum bandwidths [MHz]** **Maximum bandwidths
[MHz]**
* * *
120 50, 400 (Note) 400 480 200 1600 960 400, 2160 (Note) 1600, 2000, 2160,
3200 (Note) Note: for the cases where multiple values are listed as
candidates, there is no direct linking among min and max values in this table.
Other channel bandwidths between minimum channel bandwidth and maximum channel
bandwidth are not precluded from the NR operation in 52.6 -- 71 GHz frequency
range, and should be further investigated during WI phase, when RAN1 design
conclusions will be also considered. The maximum channel bandwidth should
account for the regulatory rules with agreed band plan and may be revised
accordingly
Carrier aggregation is considered to be used for NR operation in 52.6 -- 71
GHz range. Decision on CA configuration is discussed during WI phase.
# 5 Study of channel access mechanism for 60 GHz
## 5.1 Identification of regulatory aspects for consideration
The OCB requirement of draft version v2.1.20 of EN 302 567 [4] implies that
\- device supports one or multiple declared nominal channel bandwidths,
\- for each declared nominal channel bandwidth, RAN1 design should support at
least one physical layer signal/channel transmission that occupies at least
70% of the nominal channel bandwidth.
Mapping of nominal channel bandwidth to bandwidth definitions in NR should be
further studied when specifications are developed.
The understanding of the CCA check procedure in draft v2.1.20 of EN 302 567 is
as follows:
\- when performing CCA before initiating transmission, during count down, when
an observation slot fails ED, the counter freezes, and will continue count
down 8us after the interference is detected to be gone.
## 5.2 Channel access and interference mitigation techniques
### 5.2.1 Interference mitigation techniques
It is recommended to support both channel access with LBT mechanism(s) and a
channel access mechanism without LBT for gNB and UE to initiate a channel
occupancy. Further investigation of the following issues may be needed:
\- LBT mechanisms such as omni-directional LBT, directional LBT, and receiver
assisted LBT type of schemes when channel access with LBT is used,
\- whether operation restrictions for channel access without LBT are needed,
e.g. compliance with regulations, and/or in presence of ATPC, DFS, long term
sensing, or other interference mitigation mechanisms, and
\- the mechanism and condition(s) to switch between channel access with LBT
and channel access without LBT (if local regulation allows).
For operation where LBT is not required, the following can be further
discussed when specifications are developed:
\- whether to introduce additional conditions/mechanisms for no-LBT to be
used, or whether to leave it for gNB implementation,
\- when no-LBT mode is used, whether to introduce additional restrictions,
such as DFS needs to be applied, ATPC needs to be applied, long term sensing
needs to be applied, certain duty cycle limitation, certain transmit power
limitation, MCOT limits, etc, or leave the restriction for gNB implementation,
\- when no-LBT mode is used, whether to introduce mechanism for the system to
fallback to LBT mode, or whether to leave it for gNB implementation.
### 5.2.2 Listen before talk (LBT) design
Use the CCA check procedure in EN 302 567 as the baseline for channel access
for 60GHz band when LBT is applied. The following can be discussed further
during normative work:
\- whether CAPC and contention window adjustment mechanisms are introduced,
\- whether contention window range needs to be adjusted.
It can be further discussed when specifications are developed if and how the
ED threshold provided by the ETSI BRAN 302 567 should be modified to account
for aspects such as transmit power, LBT bandwidth, beamforming gain,
coexistence etc. It should be noted that there is no consensus that all of the
aspects above need to be considered.
For NR at least when operating with LBT, maximum channel occupancy time (MCOT)
duration is 5 msec, including all gaps inside the COT. Discussions related to
further reductions in MCOT due to potential definition of CAPC will be handled
separately
On the LBT bandwidth (bandwidth over which a single contiguous LBT is
performed) relative to channel bandwidth (as defined in RAN4), the following
alternatives have been discussed. Further down-selection of one or more of
these alternatives (if needed) should be further discussed when specifications
are developed.
\- Alt 1: LBT bandwidth equals channel bandwidth,
\- Alt 2: LBT bandwidth equals the minimum of channel bandwidth and the
transmission bandwidth (number of RBs for a given transmission),
\- Alt 3: LBT bandwidth can be wider than channel bandwidth,
\- Alt 4: LBT bandwidth can be narrower than the channel bandwidth, with
multiple LBT subband within a channel,
\- Alt 5: LBT bandwidth equals with minimum supported channel bandwidth or
multiples of the minimum supported channel bandwidth.
When LBT mode is used, it can be further discussed when specifications are
developed if a responding device should use a Cat 2 LBT to share the COT, and
if yes, how to define the Cat 2 LBT and if a maximum gap is to be introduced
between the initiating device and responding device transmissions.
Support contention-exempt short control signalling transmission in 60GHz band
for regions where LBT is required and short control signaling without LBT is
allowed. It should be noted that if regulations do not allow short control
signaling exemption in a region when operating with LBT, operation with LBT
for these short control signals should be supported. Restrictions to the
transmission, such as, on duty cycle (airtime measured over a relatively long
period of time), content, TX power, etc. can be discussed when specifications
are developed.
It can be further discussed when specifications are developed if 3GPP
specifications should define the relationship between the LBT beam and the
transmission beam or leave it as implementation. If such relationship is
defined, it can also be further discussed when specifications are developed if
ED threshold should be adjusted by the choice of LBT beam and transmission
beam.
When LBT mode is used, spatial domain multiplexing of different beams is
supported. The LBT requirement (if any) for spatial domain multiplexing of
multiple beams can be further discussed when specifications are developed. At
least the following can be considered while other LBT considerations are not
excluded:
\- leave the LBT behaviour for implementation,
\- one LBT beam covers all transmission beams,
\- multiple LBT beams cover multiple transmission beams.
When LBT mode is used, time domain multiplexing of DL/UL transmissions in
different beams in the same COT is supported. The LBT requirement (if any) for
time domain multiplexing of DL/UL transmissions in multiple beams can be
further discussed when specifications are developed. At least the following
can be considered while other LBT considerations are not excluded:
\- no additional LBT requirement defined and leave the LBT behaviour for
implementation,
\- perform directional or omni-directional LBT at the beginning of COT with
sensing beam(s) that covers all TDM beams and with no LBT before each beam
switching in the middle of COT,
\- perform directional or omni-directional LBT at the beginning of COT with
sensing beam(s) that covers all TDM beams or the first transmission beam, and
additional directional LBT with sensing beam that covers the next transmission
beam for each beam switching in the middle of COT.
### 5.2.3 Receiver assisted channel access and interference management
The following receiver assisted channel access and interference management
schemes have been considered and can be further investigated when
specifications are developed.
\- Class A) Receiver provides assistance information (signalling) to
transmitter only. The following aspects of Class A can be further discussed
when specifications are developed.
\- Applicability in the following potential channel access modes:
\- LBT is performed prior to transmission,
\- No LBT is performed prior to transmission.
\- Details of assistance information (e.g., type, timing, content, how the
assistance information is obtained etc.).
\- Whether the assistance information can be obtained by LBT performed at the
receiver prior to transmission.
\- Whether the assistance information can be obtained by existing layer 1 and
layer 3 measurements with enhancements if needed.
\- If any specification changes are needed to support Class A.
Also, the following receiver assisted channel access schemes have been
considered, and considering the system performance and complexity tradeoff,
these schemes will not be further investigated in Rel-17
\- Class B) Receiver provides assistance information (signalling) to other NR
nodes, including non-serving nodes.
\- In this case, cross RAT coexistence is based on ED.
\- Class B1) Intra-operator only.
\- Class B2) Also including inter-operator signalling.
\- In this case, cross operator coexistence is based on ED.
\- Class C) Receiver provides assistance information (signalling) to other NR
nodes and nodes from other RAT.
# 6 Summary of evaluation study
## 6.1 Summary of link level evaluations
### 6.1.1 Observations on PDSCH/PUSCH
Key findings from the results of PDSCH/PUSCH evaluations in Annex B.1.1 are
summarized below.
