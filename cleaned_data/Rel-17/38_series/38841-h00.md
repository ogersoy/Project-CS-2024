In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 Background
At 3GPP RAN #89-e meeting, a basket Work Item on "High power UE (power class
2) for NR inter-band Carrier Aggregation with 2 bands downlink and 2 bands
uplink" was approved for Rel-17, of which the objectives are as follows:
> Specify the band-combination specific RF requirements for all listed power
> class 2 NR inter-band UL CA, the requirements that need to analyse and
> specify include
>
> \- Maximum output power, configured transmitted power.
>
> \- Analysing combinations that have self-desensitization, applicable ∆TIB, c
> and ∆RIB, c and reference sensitivity exceptions including MSD test cases.
>
> \- Other additional impact to the requirements due to the high power on UL,
> if necessary
The present document is a technical report for this basket Work Item, and aims
to study the band-combination specific requirements for each of combinations
captured in table 1-1.
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band/band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the
band/band combination have been implemented.

_The tolerance +2/-3 dB is applied. Also when the transmission bandwidths
confined within F~UL_low~ and F~UL_low~ + 4 MHz or F~UL_high~ -- 4 MHz and
F~UL_high~, the maximum output power requirement is relaxed by reducing the
lower tolerance limit by 1.5 dB._
### 5.5.3 REFSENS requirements
According to the PC3 CA_n2A-n77A study, the 2^nd^ harmonic mixing products
from band 2 may fall into band n77 UL frequency range. And, the 2^nd^, 4^th^
and 5^th^ order IMD products generated by dual uplink from both band 2 and
band n77 may fall into band 2 Rx frequency range. Thus additional MSD should
be considered to mitigate the impact of the interference **for** PC2
CA_n2A-n77A combination.
#### 5.5.3.1 Power class 2 Case A
_The MSD due to receiver harmonic mixing for PC2 Case A are same as PC3_
CA_n2A-n77A.

F~UL_high~, the maximum output power requirement is relaxed by reducing the
lower tolerance limit by 1.5 dB._
### 5.7.3 REFSENS requirements
According to the PC3 CA_n66A-n77A study, the 2^nd^ and 5^th^ order IMD
products generated from dual uplinks of band 66 and n77 may fall into band 66
Rx frequency range. Thus additional MSD should be considered to mitigate the
impact of the interference for **the** PC2 CA_n66A-n77A combination.
#### 5.7.3.1 Power class 2 Case A
_The additional MSD due to intermodulation for PC2 CA_n66A-n77A are defined in
table 5.7.3.1-1._

#### 5.7.3.2 Power class 2 Case B
_The additional MSD due to intermodulation for PC2 Case B CA_n66A-n77A are
same as the Case A defined in table 5.7.3.1-1._
Although no cross-band isolation MSD was identified for PC3 n77 into n66, it
was suggested that for PC2 n77 cross band isolation into n41 be considered and
de-rated.
PC3 n77 into n41: MSD=4.5dB (note that there is 4.5dB for n78 into n40 too) =>
UL noise \~3dB above REFSENS
PC3 n77 into n66: MSD\ UL noise \ 9 dB
below noise in n41
PC2 n77 into n41: MSD=6.5dB => UL noise \~5.5dB above REFSENS
PC2 n77 into n66 => UL noise at 5.5-9=-3.5dB => \~1dB MSD

isolation for PC2 n77 single band uplink into n66**

#### 5.7.3.3 Single uplink n77 Power class 1.5
There was intermodulation MSD identified for PC2 for CA_n66A-n77A. However,
PC1.5 is only for single band uplink so it will not impact intermodulation
MSD.
Although no cross-band isolation MSD was identified for PC3 n77 into n66, it
was suggested that for PC2 and PC1.5 n77 cross band isolation into n41 be
considered and de-rated. _The PC1.5 cross-band isolation MSD was calculated by
starting with the 1.0 dB cross-band isolation MSD for PC2 from 5.7.3.2 and
calculating the PC1.5 MSD using this equation, where X is set to 3 due to the
3dB increase in interference._
The result is 1.8 dB.
Therefore, the following is proposed

isolation for PC1.5 n77 single band uplink into n66**

### 5.9.3 REFSENS requirements
According to the PC3 CA_n25A-n41A study, there is n25 MSD due to cross band
isolation from the n41 UL. For PC3 the MSD is 3.5 dB.
#### 5.9.3.1 Power class 2 case a
For power class 2 case a MSD due to cross band isolation is the same as for
PC3 because the n41 power is limited to 23 dBm.
#### 5.9.3.2 Power class 2 case b
For power class 2 case b there is up to 3 dB more power in n41 with dual or
single uplink carrier, so the MSD was calculated by calculating the interferer
power for 0.6 dB MSD for PC3, adding 3 dB to the interferer power and
calculating MSD of 1.1 dB.

### 5.10.3 REFSENS requirements
According to the PC3 CA_n41A_n66A study, there is a an IMD4 that falls into
n41. However, since n41 UL is TDD this is irrelevant.
There is also n66 MSD due to cross band isolation from the n41 UL. For PC3 the
MSD is 3.5 dB.
#### 5.10.3.1 Power class 2 case a
For power class 2 case a MSD due to cross band isolation is the same as for
PC3 because the n41 power is limited to 23 dBm so no change to MSD.
#### 5.10.3.2 Power class 2 case c
For power class 2 case b there is up to 3 dB more power in n41 with dual or
single uplink carrier, so the MSD was calculated by calculating the interferer
power for 3.5 dB MSD for PC3, adding 3 dB to the interferer power and
calculating MSD of 5.4 dB.

### 5.11.3 REFSENS requirements
According to the PC3 CA_n41A_n71A study, there is a 4^th^ harmonic of n71 that
falls in n41, but since n71 is only PC3 in this combination, the MSD due to
harmonic interference is already captured in 38.101-1.
There is also an IMD4 that falls into n71. The PC3 MSD is 11 dB.
#### 5.11.3.1 Power class 2 case a
The power class 2 case a MSD is calculated by calculating the interference
power for 11 dB MSD, increasing the interference by 3 dB, and then calculating
the resulting MSD of 13.8 dB.

### 5.12.3 REFSENS requirements
_According to the PC3 CA_n41A-n79A, band n41 and band 79 are asynchronous
operation. Also in current TS38.101-1, there are no harmonic, IMD issues for
PC3 CA_n41A-n79A, also there are no MSD values for cross band isolation._
_However, according to the table 5.12.2, the maximum output power for band n41
and band n79 are increased up to 26dBm, therefore, the MSD caused by cross
band isolation should be re-evaluated for case b, case c and case d. For case
a, it is the same with PC3, hence no MSD values for cross band isolation._
_Due to the MSD caused by cross band isolation aims to illustrate the
interference the total Tx noise including PA noise from one band to another
bands in the cases of lack of the attenuation of diplexer. Therefore for the
cross band isolation MSD:_
_\- For the case b, MSD for 26dBm of band n79 to 23dBm of band n41 needs to
re-evaluation._
_\- For the case c, MSD for 26dBm of band n41 to 23dBm of band n79 needs to
re-evaluation._
_\- For the case d, MSD for 26dBm of band n79 to 26dBm of band n41, and 26dBm
of band n41 to 26dBm of band n79 needs to re-evaluation. However, it can be
incorporated by combined case b and case c_

### 5.15.3 REFSENS requirements
According to the PC3 CA_n25A-n77A study, the 2^nd^ harmonic mixing products
from band 2 may fall into band n77 UL frequency range. And, the 2^nd^, 4^th^
and 5^th^ order IMD products generated by dual uplink from both band 2 and
band n77 may fall into band 2 Rx frequency range. Thus additional MSD should
be considered to mitigate the impact of the interference **for** PC2
CA_n25A-n77A combination.
#### 5.15.3.1 Power class 2 Case A
_The MSD due to receiver harmonic mixing for PC2 Case A are same as PC3_
CA_n25A-n77A. However, for PC3, the n25 victim bandwidths greater than 20 MHz
are missing. The highlighted values for 25, 30 and 40 MHz have been proposed
by Qualcomm for 25, 30 and 40 MHz.

#### 5.15.3.2 Power class 2 Case B
_The additional MSD due to receiver harmonic mixing for Case B are defined in
table 5.15.3.2-1. Initially, the MSD due to harmonic mixing for Case B was
copied from n2:_
Table 5.15.3.2-1: Reference sensitivity exceptions (MSD) due to receiver
harmonic mixing for NR CA in NR FR1 (based on n77UL, n2DL)
| NR Band / Channel bandwidth of the affected DL band / MSD |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
UL band | DL band | 5 MHz (dB) | 10 MHz (dB) | 15 MHz (dB) | 20 MHz (dB) | 25 MHz (dB) | 30 MHz (dB) | 40 MHz (dB) | 50 MHz (dB) | 60 MHz (dB) | 70 MHz (dB) | 80 MHz (dB) | 90 MHz (dB) | 100 MHz (dB)  
n77 | n25 | 9.1 | 8.0 | 7.0 | 6.7 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
_However, for 10, 15 and 20 MHz it appears as if the PC2 MSDs were calculated
by adding 3dB to the PC3 MSDs. The problem with that approach is that is that
the sensitivity after MSD is based not only on I, but on N+I, where initial
sensitivity is based on N alone. For PC3 MSD we have N+I~PC3~. For PC2 MSD we
have N+I~PC2~. So for PC2 compared to PC3, I increases by 3 dB; I+N does not
increase by 3dB. For our other PC2 and PC1.5 MSD analysis we have been using
the following approach:_
_MSD due to interference power I is given by:_
where _N_ is the noise spectral density and BW is the bandwidth of the
carrier. If the initial MSD is known,
then we have:
_If I is increased by X dB, then MSD(X) is given by_
_Using that approach, the following is proposed as a revision for PC2 harmonic
Mixing MSD:_
Table 5.15.3.2-2: Reference sensitivity exceptions (MSD) due to receiver
harmonic mixing for NR CA in NR FR1 with PC2 n77 (revised)
| NR Band / Channel bandwidth of the affected DL band / MSD |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
UL band | DL band | 5 MHz (dB) | 10 MHz (dB) | 15 MHz (dB) | 20 MHz (dB) | 25 MHz (dB) | 30 MHz (dB) | 40 MHz (dB) | 50 MHz (dB) | 60 MHz (dB) | 70 MHz (dB) | 80 MHz (dB) | 90 MHz (dB) | 100 MHz (dB)  
n77 | n25 | 9.2 | 7.3 | 6.0 | 5.7 | 5.3 | 3.9 | 2.0 |  |  |  |  |  |   
_The additional MSD due to intermodulation for PC2 Case B CA_n25A-n77A are
same as the Case A defined in table 5.15.3.1-1._
Although no cross-band isolation MSD was identified for PC3 n77 into n25, it
was suggested that for PC2 n77 cross band isolation into n41 be considered and
de-rated.
PC3 n77 into n41: MSD=4.5dB (note that there is 4.5dB for n78 into n40 too) =>
UL noise \~3dB above REFSENS
PC3 n77 into n25: MSD\ UL noise \ 9 dB
below noise in n41
PC2 n77 into n41: MSD=6.5dB => UL noise \~5.5dB above REFSENS
PC2 n77 into n25 => UL noise at 5.5-9=-3.5dB => \~1dB MSD

#### 5.15.3.3 Single uplink power Class 1.5
_Comparing with PC2 CA_25A-n77A, additional MSD is expected for PC1.5 n77A
single uplink due to higher Tx power in n77._ _The MSD was calculated by
starting with MSD for PC3 and calculating the PC1.5 MSD using this equation,
where X is set to 6 due to the 6dB increase in interference._
_The additional MSD due to receiver harmonic mixing for single uplink PC1.5
n77 are defined in table 5.15.3.3-1._
Table 5.15.3.3-1: Reference sensitivity exceptions (MSD) due to receiver
harmonic mixing for NR CA in NR FR1 with PC1.5 single band UL
| NR Band / Channel bandwidth of the affected DL band / MSD |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---  
UL band | DL band | 5 MHz (dB) | 10 MHz (dB) | 15 MHz (dB) | 20 MHz (dB) | 25 MHz (dB) | 30 MHz (dB) | 40 MHz (dB) | 50 MHz (dB) | 60 MHz (dB) | 70 MHz (dB) | 80 MHz (dB) | 90 MHz (dB) | 100 MHz (dB)  
n77 | n25 | 11.9 | 9.8 | 8.5 | 8.0 | 7.6 | 6.0 | 3.3 |  |  |  |  |  |   
Although no cross-band isolation MSD was identified for PC3 n77 into n25, it
was suggested that for PC2 and PC1.5 n77 cross band isolation into n41 be
considered and de-rated. _The PC1.5 cross-band isolation MSD was calculated by
starting with the 1.0 dB cross-band isolation MSD for PC2 from 5.15.3.2 and
calculating the PC1.5 MSD using this equation, where X is set to 3 due to the
3dB increase in interference._
The result is 1.8 dB.
Therefore, the following is proposed

isolation for PC1.5 n77 single band uplink into n25**

following co-existence issues were identified:
\- 5^th^ order harmonic of band n14 UL may fall into own Rx frequencies of
band n77.
\- band n77 UL might affect band n14 DL via 5^th^ order harmonic mixing
\- 5^th^ order IMD products may fall into own Rx frequencies of band n14.
Therefore, additional MSD values for IMD5 and for 5th order harmonic mixing
need to be defined for PC2 CA_n14A-n77A.
For the 5th order harmonic of band n14 UL, the MSD values due to 5th order
harmonic product of the corresponding PC3 CA case can be applied since the
maximum output power of band n14 is unchanged for case A and case B.
#### 5.16.3.1 Power class 2 Case A
_The MSD due to receiver harmonic mixing for PC2 Case A are same as PC3_
CA_n14A-n77A.

Although no cross-band isolation MSD was identified for PC3 n77 into n30, PC2
n77 cross band isolation into n41 can be considered as a baseline and de-rated
accordingly.
PC3 n77 into n41: MSD=4.5dB (note that there is 4.5dB for n78 into n40 too) =>
UL noise \~3dB above REFSENS
PC3 n77 into n30: MSD\ UL noise \ 9 dB
below noise in n41
PC2 n77 into n41: MSD=6.5dB => UL noise \~5.5dB above REFSENS
PC2 n77 into n30 => UL noise at 5.5-9=-3.5dB => \~1dB MSD

Although no cross-band isolation MSD was identified for PC3 n77 into n30, it
was suggested that for PC2 and PC1.5 n77 cross band isolation into n41 be
considered and de-rated. _The PC1.5 cross-band isolation MSD was calculated by

### 5.19.2 Maximum output power
The combination CA_n29-n77 does not have an uplink CA configuration since n29
is an SDL operating band. The power class would be defined by the single
uplink carrier requirements with appropriate ∆T~IB~ applied. Concerning the
co-existence analysis, CA_n29-n77 is similar to Case b as shown below
Table 5.19.2-1 UE Power Class 2 for uplink inter-band CA (two bands)

_The tolerance for single uplink carrier is applied._
### 5.19.3 REFSENS requirements
According to PC3 DC_29A-30A_n77A in TR 37.717-21-11, 5th order harmonic mixing
is produced from band n77 UL that might fall in Rx of band 29.
Therefore, additional MSD values for 5th order harmonic mixing need to be
defined for PC2 CA_n29-n77.
#### 5.19.3.1 Power class 2 Case A
Power Class 2 Case A is not applicable for CA_n29-n77.
#### 5.19.3.2 Power class 2 Case B
_Using a similar approach as CA_n25-n77 to calculate the PC2 harmonic mixing
MSD based on the PC3 case, the MSD was calculated by starting with MSD for PC3
and calculating the PC2 MSD using this equation, where X is set to 3 due to
the 3dB increase in interference._
_The additional MSD due to receiver harmonic mixing for Case B are defined in
Table 5.19.3.2-1._

NOTE 2: For a UE which supports this band combination only when the Band n77 frequency range restriction defined in NOTE 12 of Table 5.2-1 from TS 38.101-1 applies, the MSD test point(s) cannot be verified for the band combination and the test point(s) can be skipped. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
_The additional MSD due to intermodulation for PC2 Case B CA_n29-n77 is not
applicable._
#### 5.19.3.3 Single uplink n77 Power Class 1.5
_Comparing with PC2 CA_n29-n77, additional MSD is expected for PC1.5 n77
single uplink due to higher Tx power in n77. The MSD was calculated by
starting with MSD for PC3 and calculating the PC1.5 MSD using this equation,
where X is set to 6 due to the 6dB increase in interference._
_The additional MSD due to receiver harmonic mixing for single uplink PC1.5
n77 are defined in Table 5.19.3.3-1._

### 5.20.3 REFSENS requirements
According to the PC3 CA_n5A-n78A study, the 4^th^ IMD products from dual
