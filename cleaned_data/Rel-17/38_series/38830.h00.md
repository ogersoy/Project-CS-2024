# 4 Evaluation methodology
For this study item, the basic evaluation methodology is based on link-level
simulation and articulated in 2 steps. Simulation assumptions for step 1 are
provided in Annex A.1 for FR1 and A.2 for FR2, respectively. Link budget
template for step 2 is provided in Annex A.3.
\- Step 1: Obtain the required SINR for the physical channels under target
scenarios and service/reliability requirements. Simulations have been
conducted neglecting:
\- Constraints imposed by certain beamforming implementation, such as the
possibility to simultaneously receive or transmit with maximum gain in more
than one direction;
\- PTRS overhead and compensation algorithms.
\- Step 2: Obtain the baseline performance based on required SINR and link
budget template.
The evaluation methodology based on system-level simulation is optional and
the simulation assumptions for system-level simulation are up to companies\'
reports.
## 4.1 Antenna gain modelling
### 4.1.1 gNB antenna gain modelling
For link level simulation, two options for TDL channel model are considered:
\- TDL channel model option 1: 2 or 4 gNB RF chains in LLS
\- TDL channel model option 2 (optional): number of gNB RF chains in LLS =
number of TXRUs
For TDL channel model option 1, the complexity of link level simulation can be
simplified, while the practical gNB architecture can be reflected in TDL
channel model option 2.
Figure 4.1-1 and Figure 4.1-2 depict gNB antenna gain modelling for TDL
channel model option 1, and TDL channel model option 2 and CDL channel model
respectively. _M_ is the number of antenna elements, _N_ is the number of
TXRUs, _k_ is the number of RF chains considered in LLS. For TDL channel model
option 1, gNB antenna gains include 4 components, i.e., antenna gain component
1/2/3/4. For TDL channel model option 2 and CDL channel model, gNB antenna
gains include 3 components, i.e., antenna gain component 1/3/4. The antenna
gain component 1 is included in LLS, while the antenna gain component 2/3/4
are included in link budget template.

Figure 4.1-1: gNB antenna gain modelling for TDL channel model option 1
{width="5.258333333333334in" height="2.5in"}
Figure 4.1-2: gNB antenna gain modelling for TDL channel model option 2 and
CDL channel model
For TDL channel model option 1, the gain of antenna gain component 2 is
expressed by:
Antenna gain component 2 = 10 * log 10(_N_ /_k_)-âˆ†1,
where âˆ†1 is a correction factor to account for various non-idealities
impacting the actual gain of antenna gain component 2, and reported by
companies.
For TDL channel model option 2 and CDL channel model, antenna gain component 2
= 0.
For TDL channel model option 1, option 2 and CDL channel model, the gain of
antenna gain components 3 and 4 is expressed by:
Antenna gain component 3 + Antenna gain component 4 = Antenna Element Gain +
10 * log 10(_M_ /_N_) -âˆ†2.
where âˆ†2 is a correction factor to account for various non-idealities
impacting the actual gain of antenna gain component 3, and reported by
companies.
### 4.1.2 UE antenna gain modelling
UE antenna gain is expressed by:
UE antenna gain = Antenna Element Gain + 10 * log 10(_M_ /_k_) -âˆ†3.
For FR1, antenna element gain = 0dBi; while for FR2, antenna element gain =
5dBi.
where _k_ is the number of Tx/Rx chains, e.g., number of SRS/CSI-RS ports to
be simulated in LLS and _M_ is the number of antenna elements used for both
transmission and reception, i.e., _M/_ 2 xpol antenna elements.
For FR1, _k_ = _M_ is assumed for the simulations, and _k_ =1 for Tx (optional
_k_ = 2), while _k_ âˆˆ{2,4} for Rx.
For FR2, there are two options for simulations:
\- Option 1: _k_ âˆˆ{1,2}for Tx and _k_ = 2 for Rx,
\- Option 2: _k_ = _M_ .
âˆ†3 is a correction factor to account for various non-idealities impacting the
actual antenna array gain. For FR1, âˆ†3=0; while for FR2, âˆ†3 is
channel/procedure dependent and reported by companies.
## 4.2 Performance metrics
For LLS based methodology, coverage bottleneck(s) identification is performed
using at least MIL or MCL (assuming the set of simulation assumptions). Even
when SLS is used to obtain some components of MIL or MCL, it is categorized as
LLS based methodology. MCL values can also be used to identify the coverage
bottleneck(s). MPL can be used as supplemental information for coverage
bottleneck(s) identification.
The targets are in the form of the following:
**1\. Scenario dependent targets defined by MPL, which is calculated from
target ISD;**
\- For each scenario, multiple target ISD values can be used to draw
observations, and a single target ISD value can be used to identify
bottlenecks. Target ISD values for each scenario are as follows
\- For FR1,
\- Urban 4GHz TDD -- 400, 500m for observation and 400m for bottleneck
identification
\- Urban 2.6GHz TDD -- 400, 500m for observation and 400m for bottleneck
identification
\- Rural 4GHz TDD NLOS O2I -- 1732 and 3000 m for observation and 1732m with
33dBm/MHz BS transmit power for bottleneck identification
\- Rural 2.6 GHz TDD NLOS O2I -- 1732 m for observation and bottleneck
identification
\- Rural 2 GHz FDD NLOS O2I -- 1732 m for observation and bottleneck
identification
\- Rural 700MHz FDD NLOS O2I -- 3000 m, 4000 m for observation and 4000m for
bottleneck identification
\- Rural with long distance 4GHz TDD LOS O2O -- 12 km for observation and
bottleneck identification
\- For FR2,
\- Urban 28GHz TDD -- 200m for observation and bottleneck identification
\- Indoor 28 GHz TDD -- 20m for observation and bottleneck identification
\- The following formula is used to convert an ISD value to a target MPL
value:

NLOS model in [3]),

\log_{10}\left( W \right) + 7.5 \bullet \log_{10}\left( h \right) - \left(

$h_{\text{UT}} = 1.5m$ and $d_{3D}$ is the target range calculated by
ISD/sqrt(3).
\- For rural with long distance scenarios (based on RMa_A LOS model in [3]),

Seven sources (R1-2008874, R1-2007905, R1-2007954, R1-2008626, R1-2009583,
R1-2009792, R1-2007930) evaluate the performance of TB processing over multi-
slot PUSCH.
\- Two sources (R1-2008874, R1-2008626) show 0.6\~2 dB SNR gain when TBS
determined based on multiple slots and transmitted over multiple slots for
VoIP at 2% rBLER for FR1, compared to TB is determined based on single slot
with repetition in Rel-16. HARQ is not used. If HARQ is enabled, legacy
transmissions incur increased frequency domain resource use and a fair
comparison cannot be made. Different redundancy version {0, 2, 3, 1} is used
for repetitions in R1-2008874. The same redundancy version is used for

(MAC/RLC/PDCP) headers is not reflected in R1-2008626.
\- Two sources (R1-2008874, R1-2008626) show 1.0\~2.7 dB SNR gain when TBS

### 6.1.2 Frequency-domain based solutions
Frequency domain based solutions are studied, including enhancements on inter-
slot/intra-slot frequency hopping, enhancements on frequency hopping for PUSCH
repetition type B, sub-PRB transmission for VoIP.
Enhancements on inter-slot frequency hopping were studied from several
aspects, including more frequency offsets, e.g. 4 for BWP less than 50 PRBs, 8
for BWP greater than 50 PRBs, and more frequency hopping positions, e.g. 4.
Potential specification impacts of enhancements on inter-slot frequency
hopping include: frequency domain hopping offsets/positions.
Enhancements on intra-slot frequency hopping were studied from several
aspects, including more frequency offsets, e.g. 4 for BWP less than 50 PRBs, 8
for BWP greater than 50 PRBs, more frequency hopping positions, e.g. 3, more
time-domain hop positions within a slot, e.g. 3, and DM-RS sharing among
multiple PUSCH transmissions with the same frequency position between two
consecutive slots [related to clause 6.1.3]. Potential specification impacts
of enhancements on intra-slot frequency hopping include: Frequency domain
hopping offsets, DM-RS pattern, TBS determination, power consistency and phase
continuity for DM-RS sharing among multiple PUSCH transmissions.
Sub-PRB transmission for VoIP was studied from several aspects, including
number of tones, sub-PRB transmission with single slot and sub-PRB
transmission with multi-slot aggregation. Potential specification impacts of
sub-PRB transmission with single slot include: frequency domain resource
allocation, TBS determination, DM-RS pattern, hopping pattern within/between
the PRBs, PUSCH signal generation for DFT-s-OFDM waveform, RF requirement.
Potential specification impacts of sub-PRB transmission with multi-slot
aggregation include: frequency domain resource allocation, time domain
resource allocation, TBS determination, DM-RS pattern, RV determination,
hopping pattern within/between the PRBs, PUSCH signal generation for DFT-s-
OFDM waveform, RF requirement.

offsets/ more frequency hopping positions for eMBB at 10% iBLER for FR1,
compared to Rel-16 inter frequency hopping. **Cross-slot channel estimation is
not used, 2 RX is assumed for gains higher than 0.3dB, 300ns is assumed for
gains higher than 0.3dB.**

with more frequency offsets/ more frequency hopping positions for eMBB at 10%
iBLER for FR1, compared to Rel-16 inter frequency hopping.
\- One source (R1-2008419) shows no gain for inter-slot frequency hopping with
more frequency offsets/ more frequency hopping positions and joint channel
estimation over multiple slots is implemented for eMBB at 10% iBLER for FR1,
compared to Rel-16 inter frequency hopping with joint channel estimation over
multiple slots.

### 6.1.3 DM-RS enhancements
DM-RS enhancements are studied, including joint channel estimation or DM-RS
bundling, enhancements on DM-RS density, adaptive configuration, and DM-RS
balancing among frequency hops.
Joint channel estimation or DM-RS bundling with/without optimization of DMRS
location/granularity was studied from several aspects, including cross-slot
channel estimation over consecutive slots, cross-slot channel estimation over
non-consecutive slots, cross-repetition channel estimation within one slot,
and inter-slot frequency hopping with inter-slot bundling to enable cross-slot
channel estimation. Potential specification impacts of joint channel
estimation or DM-RS bundling include: power consistency and phase continuity,
DM-RS placement in special slot and DM-RS configuration, Time domain hopping
interval for inter-slot frequency hopping with inter-slot bundling.
Enhancements on DM-RS density were studied from several aspects, including
lower DM-RS density in time domain, DM-RS sharing among multiple PUSCH
transmissions in the time domain, lower DMRS density in frequency domain,
1-comb DM-RS, e.g., DM-RS with single port spans to occupy the whole DM-RS
symbol, and additional DM-RS symbol position in a slot. Potential
specification impacts of lower DM-RS density in time domain, and DM-RS sharing
among multiple PUSCH transmissions include: DM-RS pattern and configuration,
power consistency, phase continuity, and TBS determination. Potential
specification impacts of lower DMRS density in the frequency domain include:
DM-RS design, DM-RS pattern and configuration. Potential specification impacts
of 1-comb DM-RS include: DM-RS design, and TBS determination. Potential
specification impacts of additional DM-RS symbol position in a slot include:
DM-RS position.
Adaptive DM-RS configuration was studied. Potential specification impacts
include: related signaling design.
DM-RS balancing among frequency hops was studied. Potential specification
impacts include: related signaling design, DMRS configuration and pattern.

One source (R1-2008626) evaluates the performance of adaptive DM-RS
configuration and shows 1.7 dB SNR gain for eMBB at 10% iBLER for FR1,
compared to Rel-16 semi-static DM-RS configuration. For low SNR such as -10 to
-12 dB, it shows that adaptive DM-RS configuration can bring 10-100% increase
in throughput compared to an ill-suited DMRS configuration depending on
factors such as UE speed, DMRS bundling, and PUSCH repetition.

### 6.1.4 Power-domain based solutions
Power domain based solutions are studied, including waveform design to
optimize MPR/A-MPR, FDD high power UE, and power boosting for pi/2 BPSK.
UE transmit waveform design to reduce MPR was studied from several aspects,
including tone reservation, FDSS (Frequency Domain Spectral Shaping) without
spectral extension for pi/2 BPSK, and FDSS with and without spectral extension
for QPSK. Potential specification impacts include: related signalling, design
for spectral extension, RF requirements. Note: For tone reservation, a
fraction of tones allocated to a UE are reserved for the UE to shape its
waveform; no data is transmitted on these tones.
Power boosting for pi/2 BPSK was studied, including beyond 26 dBm as a
function of the UL duty cycle. Potential specification impacts include: UE
behavior for power boosting based on the UL time domain resource allocation,
explicit or implicit signaling, RF requirement.
One source (R1-2008626) evaluates the performance of UE transmit waveform
design to reduce MPR and shows 1 \~1.5 dB gain, compared to Rel-16 DFT-S-OFDM
and CP-OFDM.
One source (R1-2007905) evaluates the performance of power boosting for pi/2
BPSK and shows around 3 dB gain for UL duty cycle less than 50% and around 6
dB gain for UL duty cycle less than 25%.
