# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**ACL functionality:** as defined in TS 36.413 [16].
**CAG cell:** as defined in TS 38.300 [8].
**DAPS Handover** : as defined in TS 38.300 [8].
**Elementary Procedure:** NGAP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An
Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between the NG-RAN node and the
AMF. These Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to be
used to build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence
between some EPs is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP
description. Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs may be
invoked independently of each other as standalone procedures, which can be
active in parallel. The usage of several NGAP EPs together or together with
EPs from other interfaces is specified in stage 2 specifications (e.g., TS
38.401 [2], TS 38.410 [3] and TS 38.300 [8]).
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two
kinds of EPs are used:
\- **Class 1:** Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).
\- **Class 2:** Elementary Procedures without response.
For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful:
\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure
successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful:
\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
\- On time supervision expiry (i.e., absence of expected response).
Successful and Unsuccessful:
\- One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for
the different included requests. The response message used is the one defined
for successful outcome.
Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.
**en-gNB** : as defined in TS 37.340 [32].
**gNB:** as defined in TS 38.300 [8].
**MBS session resource** : as defined in TS 38.401 [2].
**NB-IoT:** as defined in TS 36.300 [17].
**ng-eNB:** as defined in TS 38.300 [8].
**NG-RAN node:** as defined in TS 38.300 [8].
**Non-CAG cell:** as defined in TS 38.300 [8].
**PDU session resource:** as defined in TS 38.401 [2].
**Public Network Integrated NPN:** as defined in TS 23.501 [9].
**Stand-alone Non-Public Network:** as defined in TS 23.501 [9].

# 4 General
## 4.1 Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional
behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any rule that
specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be possible to be
verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure
text in clause 8:
\- The procedure text discriminates between:
1) Functionality which \"shall\" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall\" perform a
certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports
procedure X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST
message of a Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message
used to report unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an
appropriate cause value.
2) Functionality which \"shall, if supported\" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node \"shall, if supported,\"
perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node
supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node
shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting
node about the not supported functionality.
\- Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is
explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not
explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response
message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including
_Criticality Diagnostics_ IE, see clause 10.
## 4.2 Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by
mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related
IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format
that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded
regardless of the standard version.
## 4.3 Specification Notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the
Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case
characters followed by the word \"procedure\", e.g., Procedure Name procedure.
Message When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is
written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word
\"message\", e.g., MESSAGE NAME message.
IE When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the
_Information Element Name_ is written with the first letters in each word in
upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the
abbreviation \"IE\", e.g., _Information Element_ IE.
Value of an IE When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in
the specification the \"Value\" is written as it is specified in subclause 9.2
enclosed by quotation marks, e.g., \"Value\".
# 5 NGAP Services
NGAP provides the signalling service between the NG-RAN node and the AMF that
is required to fulfil the NGAP functions described in TS 38.410 [3]. NGAP
services are divided into two groups:
> Non UE-associated services: They are related to the whole NG interface
> instance between the NG-RAN node and AMF utilising a non UE-associated
> signalling connection.
>
> UE-associated services: They are related to one UE. NGAP functions that
> provide these services are associated with a UE-associated signalling
> connection that is maintained for the UE in question.
# 6 Services Expected from Signalling Transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of NGAP messages.
NGAP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
# 7 Functions of NGAP
The functions of NGAP are described in TS 38.410 [3].
# 8 NGAP Procedures
## 8.1 List of NGAP Elementary Procedures
In the following tables, all EPs are divided into Class 1 and Class 2 EPs (see
subclause 3.1 for explanation of the different classes):

## 8.2 PDU Session Management Procedures
### 8.2.1 PDU Session Resource Setup
#### 8.2.1.1 General
The purpose of the PDU Session Resource Setup procedure is to assign resources
on Uu and NG-U for one or several PDU sessions and the corresponding QoS
flows, and to setup corresponding DRBs for a given UE. The procedure uses UE-
associated signalling.
#### 8.2.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.1.2-1: PDU session resource setup: successful operation
The AMF initiates the procedure by sending a PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP
REQUEST message to the NG-RAN node.
The PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message shall contain the information
required by the NG-RAN node to setup the PDU session related NG-RAN
configuration consisting of at least one PDU session resource and include each
PDU session resource to setup in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request List_
IE.
Upon reception of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, if resources
are available for the requested configuration, the NG-RAN node shall execute
the requested NG-RAN configuration and allocate associated resources over NG
and over Uu for each PDU session listed in the _PDU Session Resource Setup
Request List_ IE.
If the _RAN Paging Priority_ IE is included in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP
REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node may use it to determine a priority for paging
the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state.
For each requested PDU session, if resources are available for the requested
configuration, the NG-RAN node shall establish at least one DRB and associate
each accepted QoS flow of the PDU session which is not associated with an MBS
QoS flow to a DRB established.
For each PDU session successfully established the NG-RAN node shall pass to
the UE the _PDU Session_ _NAS-PDU_ IE, if included. The NG-RAN node shall not
send to the UE the PDU Session NAS PDUs associated to the failed PDU sessions.
If the _NAS-PDU_ IE is included in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST
message, the NG-RAN node shall pass it to the UE.
For each PDU session the NG-RAN node shall store the _UL NG-U UP TNL
Information_ IE included in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_
IE contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message and use it as
the uplink termination point for the user plane data for this PDU session.
For each PDU session, if the _Additional UL NG-U UP TNL Information_ IE is
included in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE contained in
the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node may allocate
for this split PDU session resources for an additional NG-U transport bearer
for some or all of the QoS flows present in the _QoS Flow Setup Request List_
IE and it shall indicate these QoS flows in the _Additional DL QoS Flow per
TNL Information_ IE in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Response Transfer_ IE.
In case the _Additional DL QoS Flow per TNL Information_ IE is not included
the SMF shall consider the proposed additional UL NG-U UP TNL information as
available again.
For each PDU session, if the _Network Instance_ IE is included in the _PDU
Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE contained in the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message and the _Common Network Instance_ IE is not
present, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it when selecting transport
network resource as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
For each PDU session, if the _Common Network Instance_ IE is included in the
_PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE or in the _Additional UL NG-U
UP TNL Information_ IE, or in the _Additional Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL
Information_ IE contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message,
the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it when selecting transport network
resource for the concerned NG-U transport bearer as specified in TS 23.501
[9].
For each PDU session, if the _Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL Information_ IE is
included in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE of the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported,
use it as the uplink termination point for the user plane data for this PDU
session for the redundant transmission and it shall include the _Redundant QoS
Flow per TNL Information_ IE in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Response
Transfer_ IE as described in TS 23.501 [9].
For each PDU session, if the _Additional Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL Information_
IE is included in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE
contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node
may allocate for this split PDU session resources for an additional redundant
NG-U transport bearer for some or all of the QoS flows present in the _QoS
Flow Setup Request List_ IE and it shall indicate these QoS flows in the
_Additional Redundant DL QoS Flow per TNL Information_ IE in the _PDU Session
Resource Setup Response Transfer_ IE. In case the _Additional_ _Redundant DL
QoS Flow per TNL Information_ IE is not included the SMF shall consider the
proposed additional Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL information as available again.
For each PDU session, if the _Redundant Common Network Instance_ IE is
included in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE contained in
the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if
supported, use it when selecting transport network resource for the redundant
transmission as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
For each PDU session, if the _TSC Traffic Characteristics_ IE is included in
the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE contained in the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported,
store it and use it as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
For each PDU session, if the _PDU Session Type_ IE included in the _PDU
Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP
REQUEST message is set to \"ethernet\", the NG-RAN node may perform
appropriate header compression for the concerned PDU session, or if it is set
to \"unstructured\", the NG-RAN node shall not perform header compression for
the concerned PDU session.
For each PDU session for which the _Security Indication_ IE is included in the
_PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
SETUP REQUEST message, and the _Integrity Protection Indication_ IE or
_Confidentiality Protection Indication_ IE is set to \"required\", then the
NG-RAN node shall perform user plane integrity protection or ciphering,
respectively, for the concerned PDU session. If the NG-RAN node cannot perform
the user plane integrity protection or ciphering, it shall reject the setup of
the PDU session resources with an appropriate cause value.
If the NG-RAN node is an ng-eNB, it shall behave as specified in TS 33.501
[13].
For each PDU session for which the _Security Indication_ IE is included in the
_PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
SETUP REQUEST message, and the _Integrity Protection Indication_ IE or
_Confidentiality Protection Indication_ IE is set to \"preferred\", then the
NG-RAN node should, if supported, perform user plane integrity protection or
ciphering, respectively, for the concerned PDU session and shall notify
whether it performed the user plane integrity protection or ciphering by
including the _Integrity Protection Result_ IE or _Confidentiality Protection
Result_ IE, respectively, in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Response
Transfer_ IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message.
For each PDU session for which the _Maximum Integrity Protected Data Rate
Downlink_ IE or the _Maximum Integrity Protected Data Rate Uplink_ IE are
included in the _Security Indication_ IE in the _PDU Session Resource Setup
Request Transfer_ IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the
NG-RAN node shall store the respective information and, if integrity
protection is to be performed for the PDU session, it shall enforce the
traffic limits corresponding to the received values, for the concerned PDU
session and concerned UE, as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
For each PDU session for which the _Security Indication_ IE is included in the
_PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
SETUP REQUEST message:
\- if the _Integrity Protection Indication_ IE is set to \"not needed\", then
the NG-RAN node shall not perform user plane integrity protection for the
concerned PDU session;
\- if the _Confidentiality Protection Indication_ IE is set to \"not needed\",
then the NG-RAN node shall not perform user plane ciphering for the concerned
PDU session.
For each PDU session for which the _PDU Session Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE
is included in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE of the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall store the
received value in the UE context and use it when enforcing traffic policing
for Non-GBR QoS flows for the concerned UE as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
For each PDU session in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, if the
_Additional QoS_ _Flow Information_ IE is included in the _QoS Flow Level QoS
Parameters_ IE in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE of the
PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node may consider it
for the DRB allocation process. It is up to NG-RAN node implementation to
decide whether and how to use it.
For each PDU session in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, if the
_Alternative QoS Parameters Set List_ IE is included in the _GBR QoS Flow
Information_ IE in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE of the
PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node may accept the
setup of the QoS flow when notification control has been enabled if the
requested QoS parameters or at least one of the alternative QoS parameters
sets can be fulfilled at the time of setup. In case the NG-RAN node accepts
the setup fulfilling one of the alternative QoS parameters it shall indicate
the alternative QoS parameters set which it currently fulfils in the _Current
QoS Parameters Set Index_ IE within the _PDU Session Resource Setup Response
Transfer_ IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message.
For each QoS flow which has been successfully established, the NG-RAN node
shall, if supported, store the _Redundant QoS_ _Flow Indicator_ IE if included
in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE contained in the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message and consider it for the redundant
transmission as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
For each QoS flow which has been successfully established, if the _QoS
Monitoring Request_ IE was included in the _QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters_ IE
contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node
shall store this information, and, if supported, perform delay measurement and
QoS monitoring, as specified in TS 23.501 [9]. If the _QoS Monitoring
Reporting Frequency_ IE was included in the _QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters_ IE
contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node
shall store this information and, if supported, use it for RAN part delay
reporting.
For each QoS flow requested to be setup the NG-RAN node shall take into
account the received _QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters_ IE. For each QoS flow the
NG-RAN node shall establish or modify the resources according to the values of
the _Allocation and Retention Priority_ IE (priority level and pre-emption
indicators) and the resource situation as follows:
\- The NG-RAN node shall consider the priority level of the requested QoS
flow, when deciding on the resource allocation.
\- The priority levels and the pre-emption indicators may (individually or in
combination) be used to determine whether the QoS flow setup has to be
performed unconditionally and immediately. If the requested QoS flow is marked
as \"may trigger pre-emption\" and the resource situation requires so, the NG-
RAN node may trigger the pre-emption procedure which may then cause the forced
release of a lower priority QoS flow which is marked as \"pre-emptable\".
Whilst the process and the extent of the pre-emption procedure are operator-
dependent, the pre-emption indicators shall be treated as follows:
1\. The values of the last received _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE and
_Priority Level_ IE shall prevail.
2\. If the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE is set to \"may trigger pre-emption\",
then this allocation request may trigger the pre-emption procedure.
3\. If the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE is set to \"shall not trigger pre-
emption\", then this allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption
procedure.
4\. If the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE is set to \"pre-emptable\", then
this QoS flow shall be included in the pre-emption process.
5\. If the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE is set to \"not pre-emptable\", then
this QoS flow shall not be included in the pre-emption process.
\- The NG-RAN node pre-emption process shall keep the following rules:
1\. The NG-RAN node shall only preâ€‘empt QoS flows with lower priority, in
ascending order of priority.
2\. The pre-emption may be done for QoS flows belonging to the same UE or to
other UEs.
For each QoS flow which has been successfully established, the NG-RAN node
shall store the mapped E-RAB ID if included in the _PDU Session Resource Setup
Request Transfer_ IE contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST
message and use it as specified in TS 38.300 [8].
For each PDU session, if the _Redundant PDU Session Information_ IE is
included in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE contained in
the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if
supported, store the received information in the UE context and setup the
redundant user plane for the redundant PDU session as specified in TS38.300
[8] and TS 23.501 [9]. If the _PDU Session Type_ IE is set to "ethernet" and
the redundancy requirement is fulfilled using a secondary NG-RAN node, the NG-
RAN node shall, if supported, include the _Global RAN Node ID of Secondary NG-
RAN Node_ IE in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Response Transfer_ IE of the
PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message. If the _PDU Session Pair ID_ IE
is included in the _Redundant PDU Session Information_ IE, the NG-RAN node may
use it to identify the paired PDU sessions.
The NG-RAN node shall report to the AMF in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP
RESPONSE message the result for each PDU session resource requested to be
setup:
\- For each PDU session resource successfully setup, the _PDU Session Resource
Setup Response Transfer_ IE shall be included containing:
1\. The NG-U UP transport layer information to be used for the PDU session and
associated list of QoS flows which have been successfully established, in the
_QoS Flow per TNL Information_ IE.
2\. The list of QoS flows which failed to be established, if any, in the _QoS
Flow Failed to Setup List_ IE. When the NG-RAN node reports unsuccessful
establishment of a QoS flow, the cause value should be precise enough to
enable the SMF to know the reason for the unsuccessful establishment.
\- For each PDU session resource which failed to be setup, the _PDU Session
Resource Setup Unsuccessful Transfer_ IE shall be included containing a cause
value that should be precise enough to enable the SMF to know the reason for
the unsuccessful establishment.
Upon reception of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message the AMF
shall, for each PDU session indicated in the _PDU Session ID_ IE, transfer
transparently the _PDU Session Resource Setup Response Transfer_ IE or _PDU
Session Resource Setup Unsuccessful Transfer_ IE to the SMF associated with
the concerned PDU session.
Upon reception of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message to setup a
QoS flow for IMS voice, if the NG-RAN node is not able to support IMS voice,
the NG-RAN node shall initiate EPS fallback or RAT fallback for IMS voice
procedure as specified in TS 23.501 [9] and report unsuccessful establishment
of the QoS flow in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Response Transfer_ IE or in
the _PDU Session Resource Setup Unsuccessful Transfer_ IE with cause value
\"IMS voice EPS fallback or RAT fallback triggered\".
For each PDU session for which the _Global RAN Node ID of Secondary NG-RAN
Node_ IE is included in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Response Transfer_ IE
of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message, the SMF shall, if
supported, handle this information as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
The _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE should be sent to the NG-RAN node if
the AMF has not sent it previously. If it is included in the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall store the UE Aggregate
Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context, and use the received UE Aggregate Maximum
Bit Rate for all Non-GBR QoS flows for the concerned UE as specified in TS
23.501 [9].
For each PDU session, if the _PDU Session Expected UE Activity Behaviour_ IE
is included in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node
shall, if supported, handle this information as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
If the _UE Slice Maximum Bit Rate List_ IE is included in the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store the
UE Slice Maximum Bit Rate List in the UE context, and use it for each S-NSSAI
for the concerned UE as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, report in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP
RESPONSE message location information of the UE in the _User Location
Information_ IE.
If the _User Location Information_ IE is included in the PDU _SESSION_
RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message, the AMF shall handle this information as
specified in TS 23.501 [9].
**Interactions with Handover Preparation procedure:**
If a handover becomes necessary during the PDU Session Resource Setup
procedure, the NG-RAN node may interrupt the ongoing PDU Session Resource
Setup procedure and initiate the Handover Preparation procedure as follows:
1\. The NG-RAN node shall send the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message
in which the NG-RAN node shall indicate, if necessary, all the PDU session
resources which failed to be setup with an appropriate cause value, e.g. \"NG
intra-system handover triggered\", \"NG inter-system handover triggered\" or
\"Xn handover triggered\".
2\. The NG-RAN node shall trigger the handover procedure.
#### 8.2.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation
The unsuccessful operation is specified in the successful operation section.
#### 8.2.1.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the NG-RAN node receives a PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message
containing several _PDU Session ID_ IEs (in the _PDU Session Resource Setup
Request List_ IE) set to the same value, the NG-RAN node shall report the
establishment of the corresponding PDU sessions as failed in the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message with an appropriate cause value.
If the NG-RAN node receives a PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message
containing a _PDU Session ID_ IE (in the _PDU Session Resource Setup Request
List_ IE) set to a value that identifies an active PDU session (established
before the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message was received), the NG-
RAN node shall report the establishment of the new PDU session as failed in
the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message with an appropriate cause
value.
If the NG-RAN node receives a PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message
containing a _QoS Flow Setup Request List_ IE in the _PDU Session Resource
Setup Request Transfer_ IE including at least one Non-GBR QoS flow but the
_PDU Session Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is not present, the NG-RAN node
shall report the establishment of the corresponding PDU session as failed in
the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message with an appropriate cause
value.
If the NG-RAN node receives a PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message
containing a _QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters_ IE in the _PDU Session Resource
Setup Request Transfer_ IE for a GBR QoS flow but the _GBR QoS Flow
Information_ IE is not present, the NG-RAN node shall report the establishment
of the corresponding QoS flow as failed in the _PDU Session Resource Setup
Response Transfer_ IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP RESPONSE message with
an appropriate cause value.If the NG-RAN node receives a PDU SESSION RESOURCE
SETUP REQUEST message containing the _Delay Critical_ IE in the _Dynamic 5QI
Descriptor_ IE of the _QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters_ IE of the _PDU Session
Resource Setup Request Transfer_ IE set to the value "delay critical" but the
_Maximum Data Burst Volume_ IE is not present, the NG-RAN node shall report
the establishment of the corresponding QoS flow as failed in the _PDU Session
Resource Setup Response Transfer_ IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP
RESPONSE message with an appropriate cause value.
### 8.2.2 PDU Session Resource Release
#### 8.2.2.1 General
The purpose of the PDU Session Resource Release procedure is to enable the
release of already established PDU session resources for a given UE. The
procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.2.2-1: PDU session resource release: successful operation
The AMF initiates the procedure by sending a PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE
COMMAND message.
The PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE COMMAND message shall contain the information
required by the NG-RAN node to release at least one PDU session resource, and
include each PDU session resource to release in the _PDU Session Resource to
Release List_ IE.
If a _NAS-PDU_ IE is contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE COMMAND
message, the NG-RAN node shall pass it to the UE.
Upon reception of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE COMMAND message the NG-RAN
node shall execute the release of the requested PDU sessions. For each PDU
session to be released the NG-RAN node shall release the corresponding
resources over Uu and over NG, if any.
If the _RAN Paging Priority_ IE is included in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
RELEASE COMMAND message, the NG-RAN node may use it to determine a priority
for paging the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state.
The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, report in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
RELEASE RESPONSE message location information of the UE in the _User Location
Information_ IE.
After sending a PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE RESPONSE message, the NG-RAN node
shall be prepared to receive a PDU SESSION RESOURCE SETUP REQUEST message
requesting establishment of a PDU session with a PDU Session ID corresponding
to one of the PDU Session IDs that was present in the _PDU Session Resource to
Release List_ IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE COMMAND message.
If the _User Location Information_ IE is included in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE
RELEASE RESPONSE message, the AMF shall handle this information as specified
in TS 23.501 [9].
For each PDU session for which the _Secondary RAT Usage Information_ IE is
included in the _PDU Session Resource Release Response Transfer_ IE, the SMF
shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.502 [10].
#### 8.2.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation
The unsuccessful operation is specified in the successful operation section.
#### 8.2.2.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the NG-RAN node receives a PDU SESSION RESOURCE RELEASE COMMAND message
containing multiple _PDU Session ID_ IEs (in the _PDU Session Resource to
Release List_ IE) set to the same value, the NG-RAN node shall initiate the
release of one corresponding PDU session and ignore the duplication of the
instances of the selected corresponding PDU sessions.
### 8.2.3 PDU Session Resource Modify
#### 8.2.3.1 General
The purpose of the PDU Session Resource Modify procedure is to enable
configuration modifications of already established PDU session(s) for a given
UE. It is also to enable the setup, modification and release of the QoS flow
for already established PDU session(s). The procedure uses UE-associated
signalling.
#### 8.2.3.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.3.2-1: PDU session resource modify: successful operation
The AMF initiates the procedure by sending a PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY
REQUEST message to the NG-RAN node.
The PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message shall contain the information
required by the NG-RAN node, which may trigger the NG-RAN configuration
modification for the existing PDU sessions listed in the _PDU Session Resource
Modify Request List_ IE.
Upon reception of the PDU _SESSION_ RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message, if the
NG-RAN configuration is triggered to be modified and if resources are
available for the modified NG-RAN configuration, the NG-RAN node shall execute
the configuration modification for the requested PDU session.
If the _RAN Paging Priority_ IE is included in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY
REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node may use it to determine a priority for paging
the UE in RRC_INACTIVE state.
For each PDU session, if the _S-NSSAI_ IE is included in the _PDU Session
Resource Modify Request Item_ IE contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY
REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall replace the previously provided S-NSSAI
by the received S-NSSAI for the concerned PDU session and use it as specified
in TS 23.502 [10].

included in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer_ IE contained in
the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if
supported, use it for the redundant transmission as specified in TS 23.501
[9].
For each PDU session, if the _TSC Traffic Characteristics_ IE is included in
the _PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer_ IE contained in the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported,
store it and use it as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
For each PDU session, if the _Redundant QoS Flow Indicator_ IE is included and
set to "false" for all QoS flows, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, stop
the redundant transmission and release the redundant tunnel for the concerned
PDU session as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
For each PDU session in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message, if
the _Alternative QoS Parameters Set List_ IE is included in the _GBR QoS Flow
Information_ IE in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer_ IE of
the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node may accept
the setup of the QoS flow when notification control has been enabled if the
requested QoS parameters or at least one of the alternative QoS parameters
sets can be fulfilled at the time of setup. In case the NG-RAN node accepts
the setup fulfilling one of the alternative QoS parameters it shall indicate
the alternative QoS parameters set which it currently fulfils in the _Current
QoS Parameters Set Index_ IE within the _PDU Session Resource Setup Response
Transfer_ IE of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message.
For each PDU session included in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Request
List_ IE:
\- For each QoS flow included in the _QoS Flow Add or Modify Request List_ IE,
based on the _QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters_ IE, the NG-RAN node may
establish, modify or release the DRB configuration and may change allocation
of resources on NG or Uu accordingly. The NG-RAN node shall associate each QoS
flow accepted to setup or modify which is not associated with an MBS QoS flow
with a DRB of the PDU session. The associated DRB for the QoS flow accepted to
modify may not change.
\- For each QoS flow, if the _Redundant QoS Flow Indicator_ IE is included,
the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store it and consider it for the
redundant transmission as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
\- For each QoS flow included in the _QoS Flow Add or Modify Request List_ IE,
if the _QoS Flow Add or Modify Request Item_ IE is included for an existing
_QoS Flow Identifier_ IE, the NG-RAN node shall overwrite the content of the
full _QoS Flow Add or Modify Request Item_ IE.
\- For each QoS flow included in the _QoS Flow to Release List_ IE, the NG-RAN
node shall de-associate the QoS flow with the previously associated DRB.
\- If the _NAS-PDU_ IE is received for the PDU session, the NG-RAN node shall
pass it to the UE only if at least one of the requests included in the _PDU
Session Resource Modify Request Transfer_ IE is successful (i.e. the PDU
session is included in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Response Item_ IE of
the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message).
\- The NG-RAN node may change allocation of resources on NG according to the
requested target configuration.
\- If the _PDU Session Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is included in the _PDU
Session Resource Modify Request Transfer_ IE, the NG-RAN node shall store and
use the received PDU Session Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate value when enforcing
traffic policing for Non-GBR QoS flows for the concerned UE as specified in TS
23.501 [9].
\- If the _UL NG-U UP TNL Information_ IE in the _UL NG-U UP TNL Modify List_
IE is included in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer_ IE, the
NG-RAN node shall update the transport layer information for the uplink data
accordingly for the concerned transport bearers identified by the _DL NG-U UP
TNL Information_ IE included in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Request
Transfer_ IE for the concerned PDU session.
\- If the _Additional UL NG-U UP TNL Information_ IE is included in the _PDU
Session Resource Modify Request Transfer_ IE, the NG-RAN node may allocate
resources for an additional NG-U transport bearer for some or all of the QoS
flows present in the _QoS Flow Add or Modify Request List_ IE and it shall
indicate these QoS flows in the _Additional DL QoS Flow per TNL Information_
IE in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Response Transfer_ IE. In case the
_Additional DL QoS Flow per TNL Information_ IE is not included the SMF shall
consider the proposed additional UL NG-U UP TNL information as available
again.
\- In case more than one NG-U transport bearers have been set up for the PDU
session, if all the QoS flows associated to one existing NG-U transport bearer
are included in the _QoS Flow to Release List_ IE in the _PDU Session Resource
Modify Request Transfer_ IE, the NG-RAN node and 5GC shall consider that the
concerned NG-U transport bearer is removed for the PDU session, and both NG-
RAN node and 5GC shall therefore consider the related NG-U UP TNL information
as available again.
\- If the _Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL Information_ IE within the _UL NG-U UP TNL
Modify List_ IE is included in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Request
Transfer_ IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, update the transport layer
information for the uplink data accordingly for the concerned transport bearer
identified by the _Redundant DL NG-U UP TNL Information_ IE included in the
_PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer_ IE for the concerned PDU
session.
\- If the _Additional Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL Information_ IE is included in
the _PDU Session Resource Modify Request Transfer_ IE, the NG-RAN node may
allocate resources for an additional redundant NG-U transport bearer for some
or all of the QoS flows present in the _QoS Flow Add or Modify Request List_
IE and it shall, if supported, indicate these QoS flows in the _Additional
Redundant DL QoS Flow per TNL Information_ IE in the _PDU Session Resource
Modify Response Transfer_ IE. In case the _Additional Redundant DL QoS Flow
per TNL Information_ IE is not included the SMF shall consider the proposed
additional Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL information as available again.
\- If the _Redundant UL NG-U UP TNL Information_ IE is included in the _PDU
Session Resource Modify Request Transfer_ IE, the NG-RAN node may allocate
resources for a redundant NG-U transport bearer for some or all of the QoS
flows present in the _QoS Flow Add or Modify Request List_ IE and it shall, if
supported, indicate the corresponding NG-RAN endpoint of this NG-U transport
bearer in the _Redundant DL NG-U UP TNL Information_ IE in the _PDU Session
Resource Modify Response Transfer_ IE.
\- If the _Security Indication_ IE is included in the _PDU Session Resource
Modify Request Transfer_ IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, only update
the maximum integrity protected data rate uplink and/or the maximum integrity
protected data rate downlink, and take them into account as defined in the PDU
Session Resource Setup procedure.
For each QoS flow which has been successfully added or modified, if the _QoS
Monitoring Request_ IE was included in the _QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters_ IE
contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node
shall store this information, and, if supported, perform delay measurement and
QoS monitoring, as specified in TS 23.501 [9]. If the _QoS Monitoring
Reporting Frequency_ IE was included in the _QoS Flow Level QoS Parameters_ IE
contained in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node
shall store this information and, if supported, use it for RAN part delay
reporting.

Resource Modify Response Transfer_ IE _shall_ be included containing:
1\. The list of QoS flows which have been successfully setup or modified, if
any, in the _QoS Flow Add or Modify Response List_ IE in case the PDU Session
Resource Modify procedure is triggered by QoS flow setup or modification.
2\. The list of QoS flows which have failed to be setup or modified, if any,
in the _QoS Flow Failed to Add or Modify List_ IE in case the PDU Session
Resource Modify procedure is triggered by QoS flow setup or modification.
\- For each PDU session which failed to be modified, the _PDU Session Resource
Modify Unsuccessful Transfer_ IE shall be included **_containing the failure
cause._**
\- For each PDU session, if the _DL NG-U UP TNL Information_ IE is included in
the _PDU Session Resource Modify Response Transfer_ IE in the PDU SESSION
RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message, it shall be considered by the SMF as the new
DL transport layer address for the PDU session. The NG-RAN also may indicate
the mapping between each new DL transport layer address and the corresponding
UL transport layer address assigned by the 5GC.
\- For each PDU session, if the _Additional NG-U UP TNL Information_ IE is
included in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Response Transfer_ IE in the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message, it shall, if supported, be
considered by the SMF as the new DL transport layer address(es) for the PDU
session. The NG-RAN also may indicate the mapping between each new DL
transport layer address and the corresponding UL transport layer address
assigned by the 5GC.
\- For each PDU session, if the _Additional Redundant NG-U UP TNL Information_
IE is included in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Response Transfer_ IE in
the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message, it shall, if supported, be
considered by the SMF as the new DL transport layer address(es) for the PDU
session for the redundant transmission. The NG-RAN also may indicate the
mapping between each new redundant DL transport layer address and the
corresponding redundant UL transport layer address assigned by the 5GC.
Upon reception of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message the AMF
shall, for each PDU session indicated in the _PDU Session ID_ IE, transfer
transparently the _PDU Session Resource Modify Response Transfer_ IE or _PDU
Session Resource Modify Unsuccessful Transfer_ IE to each SMF associated with
the concerned PDU session.
The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, report in the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY
RESPONSE message location information of the UE in the _User Location
Information_ IE.
For a PDU session or a QoS flow which failed to be modified, the NG-RAN node
shall fall back to the configuration of the PDU session or the QoS flow as it
was configured prior to the reception of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY
REQUEST message.
Upon reception of the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY REQUEST message to setup a
QoS flow for IMS voice, if the NG-RAN node is not able to support IMS voice,
the NG-RAN node shall initiate EPS fallback or RAT fallback for IMS voice
procedure as specified in TS 23.501 [9] and report unsuccessful establishment
of the QoS flow in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Response Transfer_ IE or
in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Unsuccessful Transfer_ IE with cause value
\"IMS voice EPS fallback or RAT fallback triggered\".

shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.502 [10].
**Interactions with Handover Preparation procedure:**
If a handover becomes necessary during the PDU Session Resource Modify
procedure, the NG-RAN node may interrupt the ongoing PDU Session Resource
Modify procedure and initiate the Handover Preparation procedure as follows:
1\. The NG-RAN node shall send the PDU SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE
message in which the NG-RAN node shall indicate, if necessary, all the PDU
sessions failed with an appropriate cause value, e.g. \"NG intra-system
handover triggered\", \"NG inter-system handover triggered\" or \"Xn handover
triggered\".
2\. The NG-RAN node shall trigger the handover procedure.

containing a PDU session in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Request List_ IE
with the same QoS flow included both in the _QoS Flow Add or Modify Request
List_ IE and the _QoS Flow to Release List_ IE, the NG-RAN node shall report
the corresponding QoS flow as failed in the _QoS Flow Failed to Add or Modify
List_ IE in the _PDU Session Resource Modify Response Transfer_ IE of the PDU
SESSION RESOURCE MODIFY RESPONSE message with an appropriate cause value if
the PDU session is modified successfully. The NG-RAN node shall not release
the QoS flow when the corresponding QoS flow already exists.
### 8.2.4 PDU Session Resource Notify
#### 8.2.4.1 General
The purpose of the PDU Session Resource Notify procedure is to notify that the
already established QoS flow(s) or PDU session(s) for a given UE are released
or not fulfilled anymore or fulfilled again by the NG-RAN node for which
notification control is requested. It is also used to notify that the updated
QoS parameters during the Path Switch Request procedure are not successfully
accepted by the NG-RAN node. The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.4.2 Successful Operation

In case of intra-system handover, if the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the
_DL Forwarding UP TNL Information_ IE for a given DRB within the _Data
Forwarding Response DRB List_ IE in the _Handover Command Transfer_ IE, the
source NG-RAN node shall consider that the forwarding of downlink data for
this DRB is accepted by the target NG-RAN node. If the HANDOVER COMMAND
message contains the _UL Forwarding UP TNL Information_ IE for a given DRB in
the _Data Forwarding Response DRB List_ IE within the _Handover Command
Transfer_ IE, it means the target NG-RAN node has requested the forwarding of
uplink data for this DRB.
In case direct data forwarding is applied for inter-system handover, if the
_Data Forwarding Response E-RAB List_ IE in the _Handover Command Transfer_ IE
is included in the HANDOVER COMMAND message, the source NG-RAN node shall
consider that forwarding of downlink data for this E-RAB is accepted by the
target eNB.
If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the _UL Forwarding UP TNL
Information_ IE for a given PDU session within the _Handover Command Transfer_
IE, the source NG-RAN node shall consider that the forwarding of uplink data
of the QoS flows is accepted by the target NG-RAN node.
In case of inter-system handover to LTE, the information in the _Source to
Target Transparent Container_ IE shall be encoded according to the _Source eNB
to Target eNB Transparent Container_ IE definition as specified in TS 36.413
[16].
If the _Direct Forwarding Path Availability_ IE is included in the HANDOVER
REQUIRED message the AMF shall handle it as specified in TS 23.502 [10].
If the _Direct Forwarding Path Availability_ IE is included within the
_Handover Required Transfer_ IE of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message the SMF shall
handle it as specified in TS 23.502 [10].
When the preparation, including the reservation of resources at the target
side is ready, the AMF responds with the HANDOVER COMMAND message to the
source NG-RAN node. In case of intra-system handover, the AMF shall include
the _PDU Session Resource Handover List_ IE in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.
Upon reception of the HANDOVER COMMAND message the source NG-RAN node shall
stop the timer TNG~RELOCprep~ and start the timer TNG~RELOCoverall~.
If there are any PDU sessions that could not be admitted in the target, they
shall be indicated in the _PDU Session Resource to Release List_ IE.
NOTE: As an exception in case of inter-system handover to LTE, the AMF
generates the _Handover Preparation Unsuccessful Transfer_ IE in the _PDU
Session Resource to Release List_ IE.
If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the **_QoS Flow to be Forwarded
List_** _IE_ _and/or Data Forwarding Response DRB List IE_ within the
_Handover Command Transfer_ IE for a given PDU session _,_ then the source NG-
RAN node should initiate data forwarding for the QoS flows _as specified in TS
38.300 [8]_.
If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the _Additional DL Forwarding UP TNL
Information_ IE within the _Handover Command Transfer_ IE, the source NG-RAN
node should initiate data forwarding of the PDU session split in different
tunnel and shall use the received UP transport layer information for the
forwarding QoS flows associated to it.
If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the _Additional UL Forwarding UP TNL
Information_ IE within the _Handover Command Transfer_ IE, the source NG-RAN
node should initiate data forwarding of the PDU session split in different
tunnels using the received UP transport layer information.
If the _NAS Security Parameters from NG-RAN_ IE is included in the HANDOVER
COMMAND message the NG-RAN node shall use it as specified in TS 33.501 [13].
If the _Target to Source Transparent Container_ IE has been received by the
AMF from the handover target then the transparent container shall be included
in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.
If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the _QoS Flow Failed to Setup List_
IE within the _Handover Command Transfer_ IE, the source NG-RAN node shall
consider that the listed QoS flows are failed to be handed over.
In case of inter-system handover to LTE, the information in the _Target to
Source Transparent Container_ IE shall be encoded according to the definition
of the _Target eNB to Source eNB Transparent Container_ IE as specified in TS
36.413 [16].
If the _Index to RAT/Frequency Selection Priority_ IE is contained in the
_Source NG-RAN Node to Target NG-RAN Node Transparent Container_ IE, the
target NG-RAN node shall store the content of the received _Index to
RAT/Frequency Selection Priority_ IE in the UE context and use it as defined
in TS 23.501 [9].
If the _DAPS Request Information_ IE is included for a DRB in the _Source NG-
RAN Node to Target NG-RAN Node Transparent Container_ IE within the HANDOVER
REQUIRED message, it indicates that the request concerns a DAPS Handover for
that DRB, as described in TS 38.300 [8].
**Interactions with other NGAP procedures:**
If, after a HANDOVER REQUIRED message is sent and before the Handover
Preparation procedure is terminated, the source NG-RAN node receives an AMF
initiated PDU Session Management procedure on the same UE-associated
signalling connection, the source NG-RAN node shall either:
1\. Cancel the Handover Preparation procedure by executing the Handover
Cancellation procedure with an appropriate cause value. After successful
completion of the Handover Cancellation procedure, the source NG-RAN node
shall continue the AMF initiated PDU Session Management procedure.
or
2\. Terminate the AMF initiated PDU Session Management procedure by sending
the appropriate response message with an appropriate cause value, e.g. \"NG
intra-system handover triggered\" or \"NG inter-system handover triggered\" to
the AMF and then the source NG-RAN node shall continue with the handover
procedure.
#### 8.4.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.4.1.3-1: Handover preparation: unsuccessful operation
If the 5GC or the target side is not able to accept any of the PDU session
resources or a failure occurs during the Handover Preparation, the AMF sends
the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value to
the source NG-RAN node.
If the _Target to Source Failure Transparent Container_ IE has been received
by the AMF from the handover target then the transparent container shall be
included in the HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message.
If the _Target to Source Failure Transparent Container_ IE is received in the
HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message including the _Cell CAG Information_ IE,
the source NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store and replace the PNI-NPN
information associated with the indicated cell.
**Interaction with Handover Cancel procedure:**
If there is no response from the AMF to the HANDOVER REQUIRED message before
timer TNG~RELOCprep~ expires in the source NG-RAN node, the source NG-RAN node
should cancel the Handover Preparation procedure by initiating the Handover
Cancel procedure with the appropriate value for the _Cause_ IE. The source NG-
RAN node shall ignore any HANDOVER COMMAND message or HANDOVER PREPARATION
FAILURE message received after the initiation of the Handover Cancel
procedure.
#### 8.4.1.4 Abnormal Conditions
In case of inter-system handover, if the NG-RAN node receives at least one PDU
Session ID included in the _**PDU Session Resource Handover List** IE without
at least one valid associated GTP tunnel address pair (in either UL or DL),
then the NG-RAN node shall consider it as a logical error and act as described
in subclause 10.4. A GTP tunnel address pair is considered valid if both the
GTP-TEID IE and the Endpoint IP Address IE are present._
### 8.4.2 Handover Resource Allocation
#### 8.4.2.1 General
The purpose of the Handover Resource Allocation procedure is to reserve
resources at the target NG-RAN node for the handover of a UE. The procedure
uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.4.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.4.2.2-1: Handover resource allocation: successful operation

long as the UE stays in one of its cells, and store the collected information
to be used for future handover preparations.
Upon receiving the _PDU Session Resource Setup List_ IE contained in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message, the target NG-RAN node shall behave the same as
defined in the PDU Session Resource Setup procedure. The target NG-RAN node
shall report to the AMF in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message the result
for each PDU session resource requested to be setup. In particular, for each
PDU session resource successfully setup, it shall include the _Handover
Request Acknowledge Transfer_ IE containing the following information:

REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.
In case of intra-system handover, for each PDU session for which the
_Additional DL UP TNL Information for HO List_ IE is included in the _Handover
Request Acknowledge Transfer_ IE of the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message,
the SMF shall consider the included _Additional DL NG-U UP TNL Information_ IE
as the downlink termination point for the associated flows indicated in the
_Additional QoS Flow Setup Response List_ IE for this PDU session split in
different tunnels and shall consider the _Additional DL Forwarding UP TNL
Information_ IE, if included, as the forwarding tunnel associated to these QoS
flows.
In case of intra-system handover, for each PDU session for which the
_Additional UL Forwarding UP TNL Information_ IE is included in the _Handover

message to the AMF. The NG-RAN node shall allocate a unique RAN UE NGAP ID to
be used for the UE and the NG-RAN node shall include this identity in the
INITIAL UE MESSAGE message.
The _NAS-PDU_ IE contains a UE -- AMF message that is transferred without
interpretation in the NG-RAN node.
In case of network sharing, the selected PLMN is indicated by the _PLMN
Identity_ IE within the _TAI_ IE included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message.
When the NG-RAN node has received from the radio interface the _5G-S-TMSI_ IE,
it shall include it in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message.
If the _AMF Set ID_ IE is included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message this
indicates that the message is a rerouted message and the AMF shall, if
supported, use the IE as described in TS 23.502 [10].
If the _UE Context Request_ IE is included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message
the AMF shall trigger an Initial Context Setup procedure towards the NG-RAN
node.
If the _Allowed NSSAI_ IE is included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message the
AMF shall use the IE as defined in TS 23.502 [10].
If the _Source to Target AMF Information Reroute_ IE is included in the
INITIAL UE MESSAGE message the AMF shall use the IE as defined in TS 23.502
[10].
If the _IAB Node Indication_ IE is included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message,
the AMF shall **consider that the message is related to an IAB node**.
If the _CE-mode-B Support Indicator_ IE is included in the INITIAL UE MESSAGE
message and set to \"supported\", the AMF shall, if supported, use the

whereas expected, the AMF shall consider the procedure as failed.
### 8.6.2 Downlink NAS Transport
#### 8.6.2.1 General
The Downlink NAS Transport procedure is used when the AMF only needs to send a
NAS message transparently via the NG-RAN node to the UE, and a UE-associated
logical NG-connection exists for the UE or the AMF has received the _RAN UE
NGAP ID_ IE in an INITIAL UE MESSAGE message or if the NG-RAN node has already
initiated a UE-associated logical NG-connection by sending an INITIAL UE
MESSAGE message via another NG interface instance.
#### 8.6.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.6.2.2-1: Downlink NAS transport
The AMF initiates the procedure by sending a DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message to
the NG-RAN node. If the UE-associated logical NG-connection is not
established, the AMF shall allocate a unique **AMF UE NGAP ID** to be used for
the UE and include that in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message; _by receiving
the_ _AMF UE NGAP ID_ ** IE in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN
node establishes the UE-associated logical NG-connection.
If the _RAN Paging Priority_ IE is included in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT
message, the NG-RAN node may use it to determine a priority for paging the UE
in RRC_INACTIVE state.
The _NAS-PDU_ IE contains an AMF -- UE message that is transferred without
interpretation in the NG-RAN node.
If the _Mobility Restriction List_ IE is contained in the DOWNLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN node shall overwrite any previously stored
mobility restriction information in the UE context. The NG-RAN node shall use
the information in the _Mobility Restriction List_ IE if present in the
DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message to:
\- determine a target for subsequent mobility action for which the NG-RAN node
provides information about the target of the mobility action towards the UE;
\- select a proper SCG during dual connectivity operation;
\- assign proper RNA(s) for the UE when moving the UE to RRC_INACTIVE state.
If the _Mobility Restriction List_ IE is not contained in the DOWNLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message and there is no previously stored mobility restriction
information, the NG-RAN node shall consider that no roaming and no access
restriction apply to the UE except for the PNI NPN mobility as described in TS
23.501 [9].
The NG-RAN node shall consider that roaming or access to CAG cells is only
allowed if the _Allowed PNI-NPN List_ IE is contained in the DOWNLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message, as described in TS 23.501 [9].
If the _Index to RAT/Frequency Selection Priority_ IE is included in the
DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it as
defined in TS 23.501 [9].
The _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE should be sent to the NG-RAN node if
the AMF has not sent it previously. If it is included in the DOWNLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN node shall store the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit
Rate in the UE context, and use the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for
all Non-GBR QoS flows for the concerned UE as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
If the _Old AMF_ IE is included in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message, the NG-
RAN node shall consider that this UE-associated logical NG-connection was
redirected to this AMF from another AMF identified by the _Old AMF_ IE.
If the _SRVCC Operation Possible_ IE is included in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT
message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store the content of the
received _SRVCC Operation Possible_ IE in the UE context and use it as defined
in TS 23.216 [31].
If the _Extended Connected Time_ IE is included in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT
message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it as described in TS 23.501

TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store this information
in the UE context for further use according to TS 23.501 [9].
If the _CE-mode-B Restricted_ IE is included in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT
message and the _Enhanced Coverage Restriction_ IE is not set to
\"_restricted_ \" and the Enhanced Coverage Restricted information stored in
the UE context is not set to \"_restricted_ \", the NG-RAN node shall, if
supported, store this information in the UE context and use it as defined in
TS 23.501 [9].
If the _UE Radio Capability_ IE is included in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT
message, the NG-RAN node shall store this information in the UE context, and
use it as defined in TS 38.300 [8].
If the _End Indication_ IE is included in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message
and set to \"no further data\", the NG-RAN node shall consider that besides
the included NAS PDU in this message, there are no further NAS PDUs to be
transmitted for this UE.
If the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message contains the _UE Radio Capability ID_
IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it as specified in TS 23.501 [9]
and TS 23.502 [10].
If the _Target NSSAI Information_ IE is contained in the DOWNLINK NAS
TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN node may use this information as specified in TS
23.501 [9].
If the _Masked IMEISV_ IE is included in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message,
the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it to determine the characteristics
of the UE for subsequent handling.
**Interactions with Initial UE Message procedure:**
The NG-RAN node shall use the _AMF UE NGAP ID_ IE and _RAN UE NGAP ID_ IE
received in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message as identification of the
logical connection even if the _RAN UE NGAP ID_ IE had been allocated in an
INITIAL UE MESSAGE message sent over a different NG interface instance.
**Interaction with the UE Radio Capability Info Indication procedure:**
**If the _UE Capability Info Request_ IE set to** \"**requested** \" **is
included in the DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message, the NG-RAN node shall trigger
the UE Radio Capability Info Indication procedure if UE capability related
information was successfully retrieved from the UE.**

UE-associated logical NG-connection for the UE exists.
#### 8.6.3.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.6.3.2-1: Uplink NAS transport
The NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending an UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT
message to the AMF.
The _NAS-PDU_ IE contains a UE -- AMF message that is transferred without
interpretation in the NG-RAN node.
#### 8.6.3.3 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
### 8.6.4 NAS Non Delivery Indication
#### 8.6.4.1 General
The NAS Non Delivery Indication procedure is used when the NG-RAN node decides
not to start the delivery of a NAS message that has been received over a UE-
associated logical NG-connection or the NG-RAN node is unable to ensure that
the message has been received by the UE.
#### 8.6.4.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.6.4.2-1: NAS non delivery indication
The NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending a NAS NON DELIVERY
INDICATION message to the AMF. The NG-RAN node shall report the non-delivery
of a NAS message by including the non-delivered NAS message within the _NAS-
PDU_ IE and an appropriate cause value within the _Cause_ IE, e.g., \"NG intra
system handover triggered\", \"NG inter system handover triggered\" or \"Xn
handover triggered\".
#### 8.6.4.3 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
### 8.6.5 Reroute NAS Request
#### 8.6.5.1 General
The purpose of the Reroute NAS Request procedure is to enable the AMF to
request for a rerouting of the INITIAL UE MESSAGE message to another AMF.
#### 8.6.5.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.6.5.2-1: Reroute NAS request
The AMF initiates the procedure by sending a REROUTE NAS REQUEST message to
the NG-RAN node. The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, reroute the INITIAL UE
MESSAGE message to an AMF indicated by the _AMF Set ID_ IE as described in TS
23.501 [9].
If the _Allowed NSSAI_ IE is included in the REROUTE NAS REQUEST message, then
the NG-RAN node shall propagate it in the rerouted INITIAL UE MESSAGE message
as defined in TS 23.502 [10].
If the _Source to Target AMF Information Reroute_ IE is included in the
REROUTE NAS REQUEST message, then the NG-RAN node shall propagate it in the
rerouted INITIAL UE MESSAGE message as defined in TS 23.502 [10].
#### 8.6.5.3 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
## 8.7 Interface Management Procedures
### 8.7.1 NG Setup
#### 8.7.1.1 General
The purpose of the NG Setup procedure is to exchange application level data
needed for the NG-RAN node and the AMF to correctly interoperate on the NG-C
interface. This procedure shall be the first NGAP procedure triggered after
the TNL association has become operational. The procedure uses non-UE
associated signalling.
This procedure erases any existing application level configuration data in the
two nodes, replaces it by the one received and clears AMF overload state
information at the NG-RAN node. If the NG-RAN node and AMF do not agree on
retaining the UE contexts this procedure also re-initialises the NGAP UE-
related contexts (if any) and erases all related signalling connections in the
two nodes like an NG Reset procedure would do.
#### 8.7.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.7.1.2-1: NG setup: successful operation
The NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending an NG SETUP REQUEST message
including the appropriate data to the AMF. The AMF responds with an NG SETUP
RESPONSE message including the appropriate data.
If the _Configured TAC Indication_ IE set to \"true" is included for a
Tracking Area contained in the _Supported TA List_ IE in the NG SETUP REQUEST
message, the AMF may take it into account to optimise NG-C signalling towards
this NG-RAN node.
If the _UE Retention Information_ IE set to "ues-retained" is included in the
NG SETUP REQUEST message, the AMF may accept the proposal to retain the
existing UE related contexts and signalling connections by including the _UE
Retention Information_ IE set to "ues-retained" in the NG SETUP RESPONSE
message.
If the AMF supports IAB, the AMF shall include the _IAB Supported_ IE in the
NG SETUP RESPONSE message. If the _IAB Supported_ IE is included in the NG
SETUP RESPONSE message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, store this
information and use it for further AMF selection for the IAB-MT.
The AMF shall include the _Backup AMF Name_ IE, if available, in the _Served
GUAMI List_ IE in the NG SETUP RESPONSE message. The NG-RAN node shall, if
supported, consider the AMF as indicated by the _Backup AMF Name_ IE when
performing AMF reselection, as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
If the _GUAMI Type_ IE is included in the NG SETUP RESPONSE message, the NG-
RAN node shall store the received value and use it for further AMF selection
as defined in TS 23.501 [9].
If the _RAN Node Name_ IE is included in the NG SETUP REQUEST message, the AMF
may use this IE as a human readable name of the NG-RAN node. If the _Extended
RAN Node Name_ IE is included in the NG SETUP REQUEST message, the AMF may use
this IE as a human readable name of the NG-RAN node and shall ignore the _RAN
Node Name_ IE if also included.
If the _AMF Name_ IE is included in the NG SETUP RESPONSE message, the NG-RAN
node may use this IE as a human readable name of the AMF. If the _Extended AMF
Name_ IE is included in the NG SETUP RESPONSE message, the NG-RAN node may use
this IE as a human readable name of the AMF and shall ignore the _AMF Name_ IE
if also included.
If the _NB-IoT Default Paging DRX_ IE is included in the NG SETUP REQUEST
message, the AMF shall take it into account for paging.
If the _RAT Information_ IE is included in the NG SETUP REQUEST message, the
AMF shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.502 [10].
If the _NID_ IE within the _NPN Support_ IE is included within a _Broadcast
PLMN Item_ IE in the NG SETUP REQUEST message, the AMF shall consider that the
NG-RAN node supports the indicated S-NSSAI(s) for the corresponding tracking
area code for the SNPN identified by the _PLMN Identity_ IE and the _NID_ IE.
If the _NID_ IE within the _NPN Support_ IE is included within a _PLMN Support
Item_ IE in the NG SETUP RESPONSE message, the NG-RAN node shall consider that
the AMF supports the SNPN identified by the _PLMN Identity_ IE and the _NID_
IE.
If the _Onboarding Support_ IE is also included within the same _PLMN Support
Item_ IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, consider that the AMF supports
UE onboarding for the identified SNPN, as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
If the _TAI NSAG Support List_ IE is included in the _Broadcast PLMN Item_ IE
in the NG SETUP REQUEST message, the AMF shall, if supported, use this
information as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
#### 8.7.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.7.1.3-1: NG setup: unsuccessful operation
If the AMF cannot accept the setup, it should respond with an NG SETUP FAILURE
message and appropriate cause value.
If the NG SETUP FAILURE message includes the _Time to Wait_ IE, the NG-RAN
node shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the NG
Setup procedure towards the same AMF.
#### 8.7.1.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the AMF does not identify any of the PLMNs/SNPNs indicated in the NG SETUP
REQUEST message, it shall reject the NG Setup procedure with an appropriate
cause value.
If none of the RATs indicated by the NG-RAN node in the NG SETUP REQUEST
message is supported by the AMF, then the AMF shall fail the NG Setup
procedure with an appropriate cause value.
### 8.7.2 RAN Configuration Update
#### 8.7.2.1 General
The purpose of the RAN Configuration Update procedure is to update application
level configuration data needed for the NG-RAN node and the AMF to
interoperate correctly on the NG-C interface. This procedure does not affect
existing UE-related contexts, if any. The procedure uses non UE-associated
signalling.
#### 8.7.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.7.2.2-1: RAN configuration update: successful operation
The NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending a RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message to the AMF including an appropriate set of updated configuration data
that it has just taken into operational use. The AMF responds with a RAN
CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to acknowledge that it successfully
updated the configuration data. If an information element is not included in
the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the AMF shall interpret that the
corresponding configuration data is not changed and shall continue to operate
the NG-C interface with the existing related configuration data.
If the _Supported TA List_ IE is included in the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, the AMF shall overwrite the whole list of supported TAs and the
corresponding list of supported slices for each TA, and use them for
subsequent registration area management of the UE.
If the _Configured TAC Indication_ IE set to \"true" is included for a
Tracking Area contained in the _Supported TA List_ IE in the RAN CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, the AMF may take it into account to optimise NG-C signalling
towards this NG-RAN node.
If the _Global RAN Node ID_ IE is included in the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, the AMF shall associate the TNLA to the NG-C interface instance using
the Global RAN Node ID.
If the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE message includes the _NG-RAN TNL Association
to Remove List_ IE, the AMF shall, if supported, initiate removal of the TNL
association(s) indicated by NG-RAN TNL endpoint(s) and AMF TNL endpoint(s) if
the _TNL Association Transport Layer Address at AMF_ IE is present, or the TNL
association(s) indicated by NG-RAN TNL endpoint(s) if the _TNL Association
Transport Layer Address at AMF_ IE is absent:
\- if the received _TNL Association Transport Layer Address_ IE includes the
_Port Number_ IE, the NG-RAN TNL endpoint is identified by the _Endpoint IP
Address_ IE and the _Port Number_ IE. Otherwise, the NG-RAN TNL endpoints
correspond to all NG-RAN TNL endpoints identified by the _Endpoint IP Address_
IE and any port number(s).
\- if the received _TNL Association Transport Layer Address at AMF_ IE
includes the _Port Number_ IE, the AMF TNL endpoint is identified by the
_Endpoint IP Address_ IE and the _Port Number_ IE. Otherwise, the AMF TNL
endpoints correspond to all AMF TNL endpoints identified by the _Endpoint IP
Address_ IE and any port number(s).
If the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE message includes the _RAN Node Name_ IE, the
AMF may store it or update this IE value if already stored, and use it as a
human readable name of the NG-RAN node. If the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message includes the _Extended RAN Node Name_ IE, the AMF may store it or
update this IE value if already stored, and use it as a human readable name of
the NG-RAN node and shall ignore the _RAN Node Name_ IE if also included.
If the _NB-IoT Default Paging DRX_ IE is included in the RAN CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, the AMF shall overwrite any previously stored NB-IoT default
paging DRX value for the NG-RAN node.
If the _RAT Information_ IE is included in the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, the AMF shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.502 [10].
If the _NID_ IE within the _NPN Support_ IE is included within a _Broadcast
PLMN Item_ IE in the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the AMF shall consider
that the NG-RAN node supports the indicated S-NSSAI(s) for the corresponding
tracking area code for the SNPN identified by the _PLMN Identity_ IE and the
_NID_ IE.
If the _TAI NSAG Support List_ IE is included in the _Broadcast PLMN Item_ IE
in the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the AMF shall, if supported, use this
information as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
#### 8.7.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.7.2.3-1: RAN configuration update: unsuccessful operation
If the AMF cannot accept the update, it shall respond with a RAN CONFIGURATION
UPDATE FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.
If the _Time to Wait_ IE is included in the RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE
message, the NG-RAN node shall wait at least for the indicated time before
reinitiating the RAN Configuration Update procedure towards the same AMF.
#### 8.7.2.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the NG-RAN node, after initiating the RAN Configuration Update procedure,
receives neither a RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKOWLEDGE nor a RAN CONFIGURATION
UPDATE FAILURE message, the NG-RAN node may reinitiate a further RAN
Configuration Update procedure towards the same AMF, provided that the content
of the new RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is identical to the content of the
previously unacknowledged RAN CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.
### 8.7.3 AMF Configuration Update
#### 8.7.3.1 General
The purpose of the AMF Configuration Update procedure is to update application
level configuration data needed for the NG-RAN node and AMF to interoperate
correctly on the NG-C interface. This procedure does not affect existing UE-
related contexts, if any. The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.7.3.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.7.3.2-1: AMF configuration update: successful operation
The AMF initiates the procedure by sending an AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message
including the appropriate updated configuration data to the NG-RAN node. The
NG-RAN node responds with an AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to
acknowledge that it successfully updated the configuration data. Unless stated
otherwise, if an information element is not included in the AMF CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, the NG-RAN node shall interpret that the corresponding
configuration data is not changed and shall continue to operate the NG-C
interface with the existing related configuration data.
If the _PLMN Support List_ IE is included in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, the NG-RAN node shall overwrite the whole list of supported PLMN/SNPN
Identities and the corresponding list of AMF slices and, if present, other
associated information for each PLMN/SNPN Identity and use the received values
for further network slice selection and AMF selection.
If the _AMF TNL Association to Add List_ IE is included in the AMF
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, use it to
establish the TNL association(s) with the AMF. If the _AMF TNL Association to
Add List_ IE is included in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, and if the
_AMF TNL Association Address_ IE does not include the _Port Number_ IE, the
NG-RAN node shall assume that port number value 38412 is used for the
endpoint. The NG-RAN node shall report to the AMF, in the AMF CONFIGURATION
UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message, the successful establishment of the TNL
association(s) with the AMF as follows:
\- A list of successfully established TNL associations shall be included in
the _AMF TNL Association Setup List_ IE;
\- A list of TNL associations that failed to be established shall be included
in the _AMF TNL Association Failed to Setup List_ IE.
If the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message includes the _AMF TNL Association to
Remove List_ IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, initiate removal of the
TNL association(s) indicated by AMF TNL endpoint(s) and NG-RAN node TNL
endpoint(s) if the _TNL Association Transport Layer Address NG-RAN_ IE is
present, or the TNL association(s) indicated by AMF TNL endpoint(s) if the
_TNL Association Transport Layer Address NG-RAN IE_ is absent:
\- if the received _AMF TNL Association Address_ IE includes the _Port Number_
IE, the AMF TNL endpoint is identified by the _Endpoint IP Address_ IE and the
_Port Number_ IE. Otherwise, the AMF TNL endpoints correspond to all AMF TNL
endpoints identified by the _Endpoint IP Address_ IE and any port number(s).
\- if the received _TNL Association Transport Layer Address NG-RAN_ IE
includes the _Port Number_ IE, the NG-RAN node TNL endpoint is identified by
the _Endpoint IP Address_ IE and the _Port Number_ IE. Otherwise, the NG-RAN
node TNL endpoints correspond to all NG-RAN node TNL endpoints identified by
the _Endpoint IP Address_ IE and any port number(s).
If the _AMF Name_ IE is included in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the
NG-RAN node shall overwrite the previously stored AMF name and use it to
identify the AMF.
If the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message includes the _AMF Name_ IE, the NG-RAN
node may store it or update this IE value if already stored, and use it as a
human readable name of the AMF. If the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message
includes the _Extended AMF Name_ IE, the NG-RAN node may store it or update
this IE value if already stored, and use it as a human readable name of the
AMF and shall ignore the _AMF Name_ IE if also included.
If the _Served GUAMI List_ IE is included in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, the NG-RAN node shall overwrite the whole list of GUAMIs served by
the AMF by the new list and use the received values for further AMF management
and AMF selection as defined in TS 23.501 [9].
If the _Relative AMF Capacity_ IE is included in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE
message, the NG-RAN node may use it as defined in TS 23.501 [9].
If the _AMF TNL Association to Update List_ IE is included in the AMF
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, update the
TNL association(s) indicated by the received AMF Transport Layer information
towards the AMF:
\- if the received _AMF TNL Association Address_ IE includes the _Port Number_
IE, the AMF TNL endpoint is identified by the _Endpoint IP Address_ IE and the
_Port Number_ IE. Otherwise, the AMF TNL endpoints correspond to all AMF TNL
endpoints identified by the _Endpoint IP Address_ IE and any port number(s).
If the _TNL Association Usage_ IE or the _TNL Address Weight Factor_ IE is
included in the _AMF TNL Association to Add List_ IE or the _AMF TNL
Association to Update List_ IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, consider
it as defined in TS 23.502 [10].
If the _NID_ IE within the _NPN Support_ IE is included within a _PLMN Support
Item_ IE in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the NG-RAN node shall
consider that the AMF supports the SNPN identified by the _PLMN Identity_ IE
and the _NID_ IE.
If the _Onboarding Support_ IE is also included within the same _PLMN Support
Item_ IE, the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, consider that the AMF supports
UE onboarding for the identified SNPN, as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
#### 8.7.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.7.3.3-1: AMF configuration update: unsuccessful operation
If the NG-RAN node cannot accept the update, it shall respond with an AMF
CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.
If the _Time to Wait_ IE is included in the AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE
message, the AMF shall wait at least for the indicated time before
reinitiating the AMF Configuration Update procedure towards the same NG-RAN
node.
#### 8.7.3.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the AMF receives neither an AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKOWLEDGE nor an AMF
CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message, the AMF may reinitiate the AMF
Configuration Update procedure towards the same NG-RAN node provided that the
content of the new AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is identical to the
content of the previously unacknowledged AMF CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.
### 8.7.4 NG Reset
#### 8.7.4.1 General
The purpose of the NG Reset procedure is to initialise or re-initialise the
RAN, or part of RAN NGAP UE-related contexts, in the event of a failure in the
5GC or vice versa. This procedure does not affect the application level
configuration data exchanged during, e.g., the NG Setup procedure. The
procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
#### 8.7.4.2 Successful Operation
##### 8.7.4.2.1 NG Reset initiated by the AMF
Figure 8.7.4.2.1-1: NG reset initiated by the AMF: successful operation
In the event of a failure at the AMF which has resulted in the loss of some or
all transaction reference information, an NG RESET message shall be sent to
the NG-RAN node.
At reception of the NG RESET message the NG-RAN node shall release all
allocated resources on NG and Uu related to the UE association(s) indicated
explicitly or implicitly in the NG RESET message and remove the indicated UE
contexts including NGAP ID.
After the NG-RAN node has released all assigned NG resources and the UE NGAP
IDs for all indicated UE associations which can be used for new UE-associated
logical NG-connections over the NG interface, the NG-RAN node shall respond
with the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message. The NG-RAN node does not need to wait
for the release of radio resources to be completed before returning the NG
RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
_If the NG RESET message contains the UE-associated Logical NG-connection List
IE, then:_
_\- The NG-RAN node shall use the AMF UE NGAP ID_ IE and/or the _RAN UE NGAP
ID_ IE to explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.
\- The NG-RAN node shall include in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message, for each
UE association to be reset, the _UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item_ IE
in the _UE-associated Logical NG-connection List_ IE. The _UE-associated
Logical NG-connection Item_ IEs shall be in the same order as received in the
NG RESET message and shall include also unknown UE-associated logical NG-
connections. Empty _UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item_ IEs, received in
the NG RESET message, may be omitted in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
\- If the _AMF UE NGAP ID_ IE is included in the _UE-associated Logical NG-
connection Item_ IE for a UE association, the NG-RAN node shall include the
_AMF UE NGAP ID_ IE in the corresponding _UE-associated Logical NG-connection
Item_ IE in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
\- If the **_RAN UE NGAP ID_** IE is included in the _UE-associated Logical
NG-connection Item_ IE for a UE association, the NG-RAN node shall include the
_RAN UE NGAP ID_ IE in the corresponding _UE-associated Logical NG-connection
Item_ IE in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
**Interactions with other procedures:**
If the NG RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except for
another NG Reset procedure) on the same NG interface related to a UE
association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the NG RESET message, shall
be aborted.
##### 8.7.4.2.2 NG Reset initiated by the NG-RAN node
Figure 8.7.4.2.2-1: NG reset initiated by the NG-RAN node: successful
operation
In the event of a failure at the NG-RAN node which has resulted in the loss of
some or all transaction reference information, an NG RESET message shall be
sent to the AMF.
At reception of the NG RESET message the AMF shall release all allocated
resources on NG related to the UE association(s) indicated explicitly or
implicitly in the NG RESET message and remove the NGAP ID for the indicated UE
associations.
After the AMF has released all assigned NG resources and the UE NGAP IDs for
all indicated UE associations which can be used for new UE-associated logical
NG-connections over the NG interface, the AMF shall respond with the NG RESET
ACKNOWLEDGE message.
_If the NG RESET message contains the UE-associated Logical NG-connection List
IE, then:_
_\- The AMF shall use the AMF UE NGAP ID_ IE and/or the _RAN UE NGAP ID_ IE to
explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.
\- The AMF shall include in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message, for each UE
association to be reset, the _UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item_ IE in
the _UE-associated Logical NG-connection List_ IE. The _UE-associated Logical
NG-connection Item_ IEs shall be in the same order as received in the NG RESET
message and shall include also unknown UE-associated logical NG-connections.
Empty _UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item_ IEs, received in the NG RESET
message, may be omitted in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
\- If the _AMF UE NGAP ID_ IE is included in the _UE-associated Logical NG-
connection Item_ IE for a UE association, the AMF shall include the _AMF UE
NGAP ID_ IE in the corresponding _UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item_ IE
in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
\- If the **_RAN UE NGAP ID_** IE is included in a _UE-associated Logical NG-
connection Item_ IE for a UE association, the AMF shall include the _RAN UE
NGAP ID_ IE in the corresponding _UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item_ IE
in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
**Interactions with other procedures:**
If the NG RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except for
another NG Reset procedure) on the same NG interface related to a UE
association, indicated explicitly or implicitly in the NG RESET message, shall
be aborted.
#### 8.7.4.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
#### 8.7.4.4 Abnormal Conditions
##### 8.7.4.4.1 Abnormal Condition at the 5GC
If the NG RESET message includes the _UE-associated Logical NG-connection List
IE, but_ neither the _AMF UE NGAP ID_ IE nor the _RAN UE NGAP ID_ IE is
present for a _UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item_ IE, then the AMF
shall ignore the _UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item_ IE. The AMF may
return the empty _UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item_ IE in the _UE-
associated Logical NG-connection List IE in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message._
##### 8.7.4.4.2 Abnormal Condition at the NG-RAN
If the NG RESET message includes the _UE-associated Logical NG-connection List
IE, but_ neither the _AMF UE NGAP ID_ IE nor the _RAN UE NGAP ID_ IE is
present for a _UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item_ IE, then the NG-RAN
node shall ignore the _UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item_ IE. The NG-
RAN node may return the empty _UE-associated Logical NG-connection Item_ IE in
the _UE-associated Logical NG-connection List IE in the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE
message._
##### 8.7.4.4.3 Crossing of NG RESET Messages
If an NG Reset procedure is ongoing in the NG-RAN node and the NG-RAN node
receives an NG RESET message from the peer entity on the same NG interface
related to one or several UE associations previously requested to be reset,
indicated explicitly or implicitly in the received NG RESET message, the NG-
RAN node shall respond with the NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in
8.7.4.2.1.
If an NG Reset procedure is ongoing in the AMF and the AMF receives an NG
RESET message from the peer entity on the same NG interface related to one or
several UE associations previously requested to be reset, indicated explicitly
or implicitly in the received NG RESET message, the AMF shall respond with the
NG RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in 8.7.4.2.2.
### 8.7.5 Error Indication
#### 8.7.5.1 General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node in order to report
detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by
an appropriate failure message.
If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising UE-
associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses UE-associated
signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
#### 8.7.5.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.7.5.2-1: Error indication initiated by the AMF
Figure 8.7.5.2-2: Error indication initiated by the NG-RAN node
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication
procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving
node.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the _Cause_ IE or
the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE. In case the Error Indication procedure is
triggered by utilising UE-associated signalling the _AMF UE NGAP ID_ IE and
the _RAN UE NGAP ID_ IE shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. If
one or both of the _AMF UE NGAP ID_ IE and the _RAN UE NGAP ID_ IE are not
correct, the cause shall be set to an appropriate value, e.g., \"Unknown local
UE NGAP ID\" or \"Inconsistent remote UE NGAP ID\".
#### 8.7.5.3 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
### 8.7.6 AMF Status Indication
#### 8.7.6.1 General
The purpose of the AMF Status Indication procedure is to support AMF
management functions. The procedure uses non UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.7.6.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.7.6.2-1: AMF status indication
The AMF initiates the procedure by sending an AMF STATUS INDICATION message to
the NG-RAN node.
Upon receipt of the AMF STATUS INDICATION message, the NG-RAN node shall
consider the indicated GUAMI(s) will be unavailable and perform AMF
reselection as defined in TS 23.501 [9].
The NG-RAN node shall, if supported, act accordingly as specified in TS 23.501
[9], based on the presence or absence of the _Timer Approach for GUAMI
Removal_ IE.
If the _Backup AMF Name_ IE is included in the AMF STATUS INDICATION message,
the NG-RAN node shall, if supported, perform AMF reselection considering the
AMF as indicated by the _Backup AMF Name_ IE as specified in TS 23.501 [9].
#### 8.7.6.3 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
### 8.7.7 Overload Start
#### 8.7.7.1 General
The purpose of the Overload Start procedure is to inform an NG-RAN node to
reduce the signalling load towards the concerned AMF. The procedure uses non-
UE associated signalling.
#### 8.7.7.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.7.7.2-1: Overload start
The NG-RAN node receiving the OVERLOAD START message shall assume the AMF from
which it receives the message as being in an overloaded state.
If the _Overload Action_ IE is included the _AMF_ _Overload Response_ IE
within the OVERLOAD START message, the NG-RAN node shall use it to identify
the related signalling traffic. When the _Overload Action_ IE is set to
\- \"reject RRC connection establishments for non-emergency mobile originated
data transfer\" (i.e., reject traffic corresponding to RRC cause \"mo-data\",
\"mo-SMS\", \"mo-VideoCall\" and \"mo-VoiceCall\" in TS 38.331 [18] or \"mo-
data\" and \"mo-VoiceCall\" in TS 36.331 [21]), or
\- \"reject RRC connection establishments for signalling\" (i.e., reject
traffic corresponding to RRC cause \"mo-data\", \"mo-SMS\", \"mo-signalling\",
\"mo-VideoCall\" and \"mo-VoiceCall\" in TS 38.331 [18] or \"mo-data\", \"mo-
signalling\" and \"mo-VoiceCall\" in TS 36.331 [21]), or
\- \"only permit RRC connection establishments for emergency sessions and
mobile terminated services\" (i.e., only permit traffic corresponding to RRC
cause \"emergency\" and \"mt-Access\" in TS 38.331 [18] or in TS 36.331 [21]),
or
\- \"only permit RRC connection establishments for high priority sessions and
mobile terminated services\" (i.e., only permit traffic corresponding to RRC
cause \"highPriorityAccess\", \"mps-PriorityAccess\", \"mcs-PriorityAccess\"
and \"mt-Access\" in TS 38.331 [18] or \"highPriorityAccess\", \"mo-
ExceptionData\" and \"mt-Access\" in TS 36.331 [21]),
the NG-RAN node shall:
\- if the _AMF Traffic Load Reduction Indication_ IE is included in the
OVERLOAD START message, reduce the signalling traffic by the indicated
percentage,
\- otherwise ensure that only the signalling traffic not indicated as to be
rejected is sent to the AMF.
If the _Overload Start NSSAI List_ IE is included in the OVERLOAD START
message, the NG-RAN node shall:
\- if the _Slice Traffic Load Reduction Indication_ IE is present, reduce the
signalling traffic by the indicated percentage for the UE(s) whose requested
NSSAI only include S-NSSAI(s) contained in the _Overload Start NSSAI List_ IE,
and the signalling traffic indicated as to be reduced by the _Overload Action_
IE in the _Slice Overload Response_ IE if the IE is present,
\- otherwise ensure that only the signalling traffic from UE(s) whose
requested NSSAI includes S-NSSAI(s) other than the ones contained in the
_Overload Start NSSAI List_ IE, or the signalling traffic not indicated as to
be reduced by the _Overload Action_ IE in the _Slice Overload Response_ IE for
the UE(s) if the requested NSSAI matched, is sent to the AMF.
If an overload control is ongoing and the NG-RAN node receives a further
OVERLOAD START message, the NG-RAN node shall replace the contents of the
previously received information with the new one.
#### 8.7.7.3 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
### 8.7.8 Overload Stop
#### 8.7.8.1 General
The purpose of the Overload Stop procedure is to signal to an NG-RAN node the
AMF is connected to that the overload situation at the AMF has ended and
normal operation shall resume. The procedure uses non-UE associated
signalling.
#### 8.7.8.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.7.8.2-1: Overload stop
The NG-RAN node receiving the OVERLOAD STOP message shall assume that the
overload situation at the AMF from which it receives the message has ended and
shall resume normal operation for the applicable traffic towards this AMF.
#### 8.7.8.3 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
## 8.8 Configuration Transfer Procedures
### 8.8.1 Uplink RAN Configuration Transfer
#### 8.8.1.1 General
The purpose of the Uplink RAN Configuration Transfer procedure is to transfer
RAN configuration information from the NG-RAN node to the AMF. The AMF does
not interpret the transferred RAN configuration information. This procedure
uses non-UE associated signalling.
#### 8.8.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.8.1.2-1: Uplink RAN configuration transfer
The NG-RAN node initiates the procedure by sending the UPLINK RAN
CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message to the AMF.
If the AMF receives the _SON Configuration Transfer_ IE, it shall
transparently transfer the _SON Configuration Transfer_ IE towards the NG-RAN
node indicated in the _Target RAN Node ID_ IE which is included in the _SON
Configuration Transfer_ IE. If the _NR CGI_ IE is included within the _Target
RAN Node ID_ IE, the AMF shall, if supported, ignore the _Global RAN Node ID_
IE within the _Target RAN Node ID_ IE, and use it to identify the target gNB
as described in TS 38.300 [8].
If the AMF receives the _EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer_ IE, it shall
transparently transfer the _EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer_ IE towards an
MME serving the eNB indicated in the _Target eNB-ID_ IE which is included in
the _EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer_ IE.
If the AMF receives the _Inter-system SON Configuration Transfer_ IE, it shall
transparently transfer the _Inter-system SON Configuration Transfer_ IE
towards an MME serving the eNB indicated in the _Target eNB-ID_ IE which is
included in the _Inter-system SON Configuration Transfer_ IE.
#### 8.8.1.3 Abnormal Conditions
Void.
### 8.8.2 Downlink RAN Configuration Transfer
#### 8.8.2.1 General
The purpose of the Downlink RAN Configuration Transfer procedure is to
transfer RAN configuration information from the AMF to the NG-RAN node. This
procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
#### 8.8.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.8.2.2-1: Downlink RAN configuration transfer
The procedure is initiated with an DOWNLINK RAN CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message
sent from the AMF to the NG-RAN node.
If the NG-RAN node receives, in the _SON Configuration Transfer_ IE or in the
_EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer_ IE, the _SON Information_ IE containing the
_SON Information Request_ IE, it may transfer back the requested information
either towards the NG-RAN node indicated in the _Source RAN Node ID_ IE of the
_SON Configuration Transfer_ IE or towards an eNB indicated in the _Source
eNB-ID_ IE of the _EN-DC SON Configuration Transfer_ IE by initiating the
Uplink RAN Configuration Transfer procedure.
If the NG-RAN node receives, in the _SON Configuration Transfer_ IE, the _Xn
TNL Configuration Info_ IE containing the _Xn Extended Transport Layer
Addresses_ IE, it may use it as part of its ACL functionality configuration
actions, if such ACL functionality is deployed.
If the NG-RAN node receives, in the _SON Configuration Transfer_ IE, the _SON
Information_ IE containing the _SON Information Reply_ IE including the _Xn
TNL Configuration Info_ IE as an answer to a former request, it may use it to
initiate the Xn TNL establishment.
In case the _IP-Sec Transport Layer Address_ IE is present and the _GTP
Transport Layer Addresses_ IE within the _Xn Extended Transport Layer
Addresses_ IE is not empty, GTP traffic is conveyed within an IP-Sec tunnel
terminated at the IP-Sec tunnel endpoint given in the _IP-Sec Transport Layer
Address_ IE.
In case the _IP-Sec Transport Layer Address_ IE is not present, GTP traffic is
terminated at the endpoints given by the list of addresses in the _Xn_ _GTP
Transport Layer Addresses_ IE within the _Xn Extended Transport Layer
Addresses_ IE.
In case the _Xn_ _GTP Transport Layer Addresses_ IE is empty and the _IP-Sec
Transport Layer Address_ IE is present, SCTP traffic is conveyed within an IP-
Sec tunnel terminated at the IP-Sec tunnel endpoint given in the _IP-Sec
Transport Layer Address_ IE, within the _Xn Extended Transport Layer
Addresses_ IE.
In case the _Xn SCTP Transport Layer Addresses_ IE is present and the _IP-Sec
Transport Layer Address_ IE is also present, the concerned SCTP traffic is
conveyed within an IP-Sec tunnel terminated at the IP-Sec tunnel endpoint
given in this _IP-Sec Transport Layer Address_ IE, within the _Xn Extended
Transport Layer Addresses_ IE.
If the NG-RAN node receives the _SON Information_ IE containing the _SON
Information Report_ IE it may use it as specified in TS 38.300 [8].
If the NG-RAN node receives the _Inter-system_ _SON Information_ IE containing
the _Inter-system SON Information Report_ IE it may use it as specified in TS
38.300 [8].
If the NG-RAN node receives the _Inter-system_ _SON Information_ IE containing
the _Inter-system SON Information Request_ IE or the _Inter-system SON
Information Reply_ IE, it may use it as specified in TS 38.300 [8]. If the
_Reporting System_ IE in the _Inter-system SON Information Request_ IE is set
to 'No Reporting', the DOWNLINK RAN CONFIGURATION TRANSFER message shall be
ignored.
If the NG-RAN node is configured to use one IPsec tunnel for all NG and Xn
traffic (IPsec star topology) then the traffic to the peer NG-RAN node shall
be routed through this IPsec tunnel and the _IP-Sec Transport Layer Address_
IE shall be ignored.

Void.
## 8.9 Warning Message Transmission Procedures
### 8.9.1 Write-Replace Warning
#### 8.9.1.1 General
The purpose of Write-Replace Warning procedure is to start or overwrite the
broadcasting of warning messages. The procedure uses non UE-associated
signalling.
#### 8.9.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.9.1.2-1: Write-Replace Warning procedure: successful operation
The AMF initiates the procedure by sending a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST
message to the NG-RAN node.
Upon receipt of the WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node
shall prioritise its resources to process the warning message.
If, in a certain area, broadcast of a warning message is already ongoing and
the NG-RAN node receives a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message with _Message
Identifier_ IE and/or _Serial Number_ IE which are different from those in the
warning message being broadcast, and if the _Concurrent Warning Message
Indicator_ IE is not present, the NG-RAN node shall replace the warning
message being broadcast with the newly received one for that area.
If the NG-RAN node receives a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message with a
warning message identified by the _Message Identifier_ IE and _Serial Number_
IE and if there are no prior warning messages being broadcast in any of the
warning areas indicated in the _Warning Area List_ IE, the NG-RAN node shall
broadcast the received warning message for those area(s).
If, in a certain area, broadcast of one or more warning messages are already
ongoing and the NG-RAN node receives a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message
with a _Message Identifier_ IE and/or _Serial Number_ IE which are different
from those in any of the warning messages being broadcast, and if the
_Concurrent Warning Message Indictor_ IE is present, the NG-RAN node shall
schedule the received warning message for broadcast, for that area.
If the _Concurrent Warning Message Indicator_ IE is present and if a value
\"0\" is received in the _Number of Broadcasts Requested_ IE, the NG-RAN node
shall broadcast the received warning message indefinitely until requested
otherwise to stop broadcasting, except if the _Repetition Period_ IE is set to
\"0\".
If, in a certain area, broadcast of one or more warning messages are already
ongoing and the NG-RAN node receives a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST message
with _Message Identifier_ IE and _Serial Number_ IE which correspond to one of
the warning messages already being broadcast in that area, the NG-RAN node
shall not start a new broadcast or replace an existing one but it shall still
reply by sending a WRITE-REPLACE WARNING RESPONSE message which includes the
_Broadcast Completed Area List_ IE set according to the ongoing broadcast.
If the _Warning Area_ _List_ IE is not included in the WRITE-REPLACE WARNING
REQUEST message, the NG-RAN node shall broadcast the indicated message in all
of the cells within the NG-RAN node.
If the _Warning Type_ IE is included in the WRITE-REPLACE WARNING REQUEST
message, the NG-RAN node shall broadcast the Primary Notification irrespective
of the setting of the _Repetition Period_ IE and the _Number of Broadcasts
Requested_ IE, and process the Primary Notification according to TS 36.331
[21] and TS 38.331 [18].
If the _Data Coding Scheme_ IE and the _Warning Message Contents_ IE are both

# 9 Elements for NGAP Communication
## 9.0 General
Subclauses 9.2 and 9.3 present the NGAP message and IE definitions in tabular
format. The corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in subclause 9.4. In
case there is contradiction between the tabular format and the ASN.1
definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of
conditions for the presence of conditional IEs, where the tabular format shall
take precedence.
The messages have been defined in accordance to the guidelines specified in TR
25.921 [7].
When specifying IEs which are to be represented by bitstrings, if not
otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description of the concerned IE
or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards to the ordering of
bits:
\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
\- When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the
bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;
## 9.1 Tabular Format Contents
### 9.1.1 Presence
All IEs are marked mandatory, optional or conditional according to table
9.1.1-1.
Table 9.1.1-1: Meaning of content within \"Presence\" column
* * *
Abbreviation Meaning M IEs marked as Mandatory (M) shall always be included in
the message. O IEs marked as Optional (O) may or may not be included in the
message. C IEs marked as Conditional (C) shall be included in a message only
if the condition is satisfied. Otherwise the IE shall not be included.
* * *
### 9.1.2 Criticality
Each IE or group of IEs may have criticality information applied to it
according to table 9.1.2-1.
Table 9.1.2-1: Meaning of content within \"Criticality\" column
* * *
Abbreviation Meaning \-- No criticality information is applied explicitly. YES
Criticality information is applied. This is usable only for non-repeatable IEs
GLOBAL The IE and all its repetitions together have one common criticality
information. This is usable only for repeatable IEs. EACH Each repetition of
the IE has its own criticality information. It is not allowed to assign
different criticality values to the repetitions. This is usable only for
repeatable IEs.
* * *
### 9.1.3 Range
The Range column indicates the allowed number of copies of repetitive IEs/IE
groups.
### 9.1.4 Assigned Criticality
The Assigned Criticality column provides the actual criticality information as
defined in subclause 10.3.2, if applicable.
## 9.2 Message Functional Definition and Content

capability is missing. On the other hand, \"not available\" cause values
indicate that the related capability is present, but insufficient resources
were available to perform the requested action.
* * *
Radio Network Layer cause Meaning Unspecified Sent for radio network layer
cause when none of the specified cause values applies. TXnRELOCOverall expiry
The timer guarding the handover that takes place over Xn has abnormally
expired. Successful handover Successful handover. Release due to NG-RAN
generated reason Release is initiated due to NG-RAN generated reason. Release
due to 5GC generated reason Release is initiated due to 5GC generated reason.
Handover cancelled The reason for the action is cancellation of Handover.
Partial handover Provides a reason for the handover cancellation. The HANDOVER
COMMAND message from AMF contained _PDU Session Resource to Release List_ IE
or _QoS flow to Release List_ and the source NG-RAN node estimated service
continuity for the UE would be better by not proceeding with handover towards
this particular target NG-RAN node. Handover failure in target 5GC/ NG-RAN
node or target system The handover failed due to a failure in target 5GC/NG-
RAN node or target system. Handover target not allowed Handover to the
indicated target cell is not allowed for the UE in question. TNG~RELOCoverall~
expiry The reason for the action is expiry of timer TNG~RELOCoverall~.
TNG~RELOCprep~ expiry Handover Preparation procedure is cancelled when timer
TNG~RELOCprep~ expires. Cell not available The concerned cell is not
available. Unknown target ID Handover rejected because the target ID is not
known to the AMF. No radio resources available in target cell Load on target
cell is too high. Unknown local UE NGAP ID The action failed because the
receiving node does not recognise the local UE NGAP ID. Inconsistent remote UE
NGAP ID The action failed because the receiving node considers that the
received remote UE NGAP ID is inconsistent. Handover desirable for radio
reasons The reason for requesting handover is radio related. Time critical
handover Handover is requested for time critical reason i.e., this cause value
is reserved to represent all critical cases where the connection is likely to
be dropped if handover is not performed. Resource optimisation handover The
reason for requesting handover is to improve the load distribution with the
neighbour cells. Reduce load in serving cell Load on serving cell needs to be
reduced. When applied to handover preparation, it indicates the handover is
triggered due to load balancing. User inactivity The action is requested due
to inactivity on all user data radio bearers (i.e., DRBs and, if applicable,
MRBs as per section 16.10.5.2 in TS 38.300 [8]), e.g., NG is requested to be
released in order to optimise the radio resources. For L2 U2N Relay UE, this
action is requested due to user inactivity on all PDU sessions of L2 U2N Relay
UE and its served remote UE(s). Radio connection with UE lost The action is
requested due to losing the radio connection to the UE. Radio resources not
available No requested radio resources are available. Invalid QoS combination
The action was failed because of invalid QoS combination. Failure in the radio
interface procedure Radio interface procedure has failed. Interaction with
other procedure The action is due to an ongoing interaction with another
procedure. Unknown PDU Session ID The action failed because the PDU Session ID
is unknown in the NG-RAN node. Unknown QoS Flow ID The action failed because
the QoS Flow ID is unknown in the NG-RAN node. Multiple PDU Session ID
instances The action failed because multiple instance of the same PDU Session
had been provided to/from the NG-RAN node. Multiple QoS Flow ID instances The
action failed because multiple instances of the same QoS flow had been
provided to the NG-RAN node. Encryption and/or integrity protection algorithms
not supported The NG-RAN node is unable to support any of the encryption
and/or integrity protection algorithms supported by the UE. NG intra-system
handover triggered The action is due to a NG intra-system handover that has
been triggered. NG inter-system handover triggered The action is due to a NG
inter-system handover that has been triggered. Xn handover triggered The
action is due to an Xn handover that has been triggered. Not supported 5QI
value The QoS flow setup failed because the requested 5QI is not supported. UE
context transfer The action is due to a UE resumes from the NG-RAN node
different from the one which sent the UE into RRC_INACTIVE state. IMS voice
EPS fallback or RAT fallback triggered The setup of QoS flow is failed due to
EPS fallback or RAT fallback for IMS voice using handover or redirection. UP
integrity protection not possible The PDU session cannot be accepted according
to the required user plane integrity protection policy. UP confidentiality
protection not possible The PDU session cannot be accepted according to the
required user plane confidentiality protection policy. Slice(s) not supported
Slice(s) not supported. UE in RRC_INACTIVE state not reachable The action is
requested due to RAN paging failure. Redirection The release is requested due
to inter-system redirection or intra-system redirection. Resources not
available for the slice(s) The requested resources are not available for the
slice(s). UE maximum integrity protected data rate reason The request is not
accepted in order to comply with the maximum data rate for integrity
protection supported by the UE. Release due to CN-detected mobility The
context release is requested by the AMF because the UE is already served by
another CN node (same or different system), or another NG interface of the
same CN node. N26 interface not available The action failed due to a temporary
failure of the N26 interface. Release due to pre-emption Release is initiated
due to pre-emption. Multiple Location Reporting Reference ID Instances The
action failed because multiple areas of interest are set with the same
Location Reporting Reference ID. RSN not available for the UP The redundant
user plane resources indicated by RSN are not available. NPN access denied
Access was denied, or release is requested, for NPN reasons. CAG only access
denied Access was denied because the cell is a non-CAG cell and UE is only
allowed to access CAG cells. Insufficient UE Capabilities The procedure can't
proceed due to insufficient UE capabilities. RedCap UE not supported The
action failed because target NG-RAN node does not support RedCap UE. Unknown
MBS Session ID The action failed because the MBS Session ID is unknown.
Indicated MBS Session Area Information not served by the gNB The action failed
because the none of the cells in indicacted MBS Session Area Infomration
served by the NG-RAN node. Inconsistent slice info for the session The action
failed because the slice info of the multicast session is inconsistent.
Misaligned association for the multicast and unicast sessions or flows The
action failed because the Associated Unicast QoS Flow ID has already been
used, or the Associated Unicast QoS Flow ID is not defined, or the Associated
Unicast QoS Flow ID is not released, or multiple MBS QoS flows associated to
the same unicast QoS flow, or same multicast session associated to multiple
PDU Sessions.

transport resources are not available. Unspecified Sent when none of the above
cause values applies but still the cause is Transport Network Layer related.
* * *
* * *
NAS cause Meaning Normal release The release is normal. Authentication failure
The action is due to authentication failure. Deregister The action is due to
deregister. Unspecified Sent when none of the above other cause values applies
but still the cause is NAS related. UE not in PLMN serving area The release is
due to the UE not being within the serving area of its current PLMN (for NTN).
* * *

## 9.4 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
### 9.4.1 General
NGAP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.691 [4], ITU-T Rec. X.680 [5]
and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [6].
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of NGAP messages.
NGAP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for
that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by
ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall
construct an NGAP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the
following additional rules:
\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.
\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall
appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format there
is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e., an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements
reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears
as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may
contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE: In the above \"IE\" means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID.
If one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different
occurrences will have different IE IDs.
If an NGAP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this
shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled
as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.
### 9.4.2 Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
\- for special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to
be part of the basic functionality, i.e., the functionality required for a
complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor
interoperability;
\- by vendors for research purposes, e.g., to implement and evaluate new
algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such
functionality shall be standardised.

procedure in the source NG-RAN node.
TXn~RELOCOverall~
\- Specified in TS 38.423 [24].
# 10 Handling of Unknown, Unforeseen and Erroneous Protocol Data
## 10.1 General
Protocol Error cases can be divided into three classes:
\- Transfer Syntax Error.
\- Abstract Syntax Error.
\- Logical Error.
Protocol errors can occur in the following functions within a receiving node:
Figure 10.1-1: Protocol Errors in NGAP.
The information stated in subclauses 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, to be included in
the message used when reporting an error, is what at minimum shall be
included. Other optional information elements within the message may also be
included, if available. This is also valid for the case when the reporting is
done with a response message. The latter is an exception to what is stated in
subclause 4.1.
## 10.2 Transfer Syntax Error
A Transfer Syntax Error occurs when the receiver is not able to decode the
received physical message. Transfer syntax errors are always detected in the
process of ASN.1 decoding. If a Transfer Syntax Error occurs, the receiver
should initiate Error Indication procedure with appropriate cause value for
the Transfer Syntax protocol error.
Examples for Transfer Syntax Errors are:
\- Violation of value ranges in ASN.1 definition of messages. E.g., if an IE
has a defined value range of 0 to 10 (ASN.1: INTEGER (0..10)), and 12 will be
received, then this will be treated as a transfer syntax error.
\- Violation in list element constraints. E.g., if a list is defined as
containing 1 to 10 elements, and 12 elements will be received, then this case
will be handled as a transfer syntax error.
\- Missing mandatory elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the
originator of the message).
\- Wrong order of elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the
originator of the message).
## 10.3 Abstract Syntax Error
### 10.3.1 General
An Abstract Syntax Error occurs when the receiving functional NGAP entity:
1\. receives IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE ID);
2\. receives IEs for which the logical range is violated (e.g., ASN.1
definition: 0 to 15, the logical range is 0 to 10, while values 11 to 15 are
undefined), and 12 will be received; this case will be handled as an abstract
syntax error using criticality information sent by the originator of the
message);
3\. does not receive IEs or IE groups but according to the specified presence
of the concerning object, the IEs or IE groups should have been present in the
received message.
4\. receives IEs or IE groups that are defined to be part of that message in
wrong order or with too many occurrences of the same IE or IE group;
5\. receives IEs or IE groups but according to the conditional presence of the
concerning object and the specified condition, the IEs or IE groups should not
have been present in the received message.
6\. receives IEs or IE groups for a functionality that is not supported.
Cases 1, 2 and 6 (not comprehended IE/IE group) are handled based on received
Criticality information. Case 3 (missing IE/IE group) is handled based on
Criticality information and Presence information for the missing IE/IE group
specified in the version of the specification used by the receiver. Case 4
(IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences) and Case 5
(erroneously present conditional IEs or IE groups) result in rejecting the
procedure.
If an Abstract Syntax Error occurs, the receiver shall read the remaining
message and shall then for each detected Abstract Syntax Error that belong to
cases 1-3 and 6 act according to the Criticality Information and Presence
Information for the IE/IE group due to which Abstract Syntax Error occurred in
accordance with subclauses 10.3.4 and 10.3.5. The handling of cases 4 and 5 is
specified in subclause 10.3.6.
### 10.3.2 Criticality Information
In the NGAP messages there is criticality information set for individual IEs
and/or IE groups. This criticality information instructs the receiver how to
act when receiving an IE or an IE group that is not comprehended, i.e., the
entire item (IE or IE group) which is not (fully or partially) comprehended
shall be treated in accordance with its own criticality information as
specified in subclause 10.3.4.
In addition, the criticality information is used in case of the missing IE/IE
group abstract syntax error (see subclause 10.3.5).
The receiving node shall take different actions depending on the value of the
Criticality Information. The three possible values of the Criticality
Information for an IE/IE group are:
\- Reject IE.
\- Ignore IE and Notify Sender.
\- Ignore IE.
The comprehension of different IEs or IE groups within a standard version or
between standard versions is not mandated. Any IE or IE group that is not
supported shall be considered not comprehended, even if another IE or IE group
for that EP from that standard version is comprehended, and action based on
criticality shall be applied.
The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or between
different standard versions is not mandated. Any EP that is not supported
shall be considered not comprehended, even if another EP from that standard
version is comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be applied.
### 10.3.3 Presence Information
For many IEs/IE groups which are optional according to the ASN.1 transfer
syntax, NGAP specifies separately if the presence of these IEs/IE groups is
optional or mandatory with respect to RNS application by means of the presence
field of the concerning object of class NGAP-PROTOCOL-IES, NGAP-PROTOCOL-IES-
PAIR, NGAP-PROTOCOL-EXTENSION or NGAP-PRIVATE-IES.
The presence field of the indicated classes supports three values:
1\. Optional;
2\. Conditional;
3\. Mandatory.
If an IE/IE group is not included in a received message and the presence of
the IE/IE group is mandatory or the presence is conditional and the condition
is true according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an
abstract syntax error occurs due to a missing IE/IE group.
If an IE/IE group is included in a received message and the presence of the
IE/IE group is conditional and the condition is false according to the version
of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due
to this erroneously present conditional IE/IE group.
### 10.3.4 Not comprehended IE/IE group
#### 10.3.4.1 Procedure Code
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality
information of the _Procedure Code_ IE according to the following:
**Reject IE:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure Code_ IE marked with \"_Reject
IE_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall
reject the procedure using the Error Indication procedure.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure Code_ IE marked with \"_Ignore
IE and Notify Sender_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall ignore the procedure and initiate the Error Indication
procedure.
**Ignore IE:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure Code_ IE marked with \"_Ignore
IE_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall
ignore the procedure.
When using the Error Indication procedure to reject a procedure or to report
an ignored procedure it shall include the _Procedure Code_ IE, the _Triggering
Message_ IE, and the _Procedure Criticality_ IE in the _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE.
#### 10.3.4.1A Type of Message
When the receiving node cannot decode the _Type of Message_ IE, the Error
Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value.
#### 10.3.4.2 IEs other than the Procedure Code and Type of Message
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality
information of an IE/IE group other than the _Procedure Code_ IE and _Type of
Message_ IE according to the following:
**Reject IE:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE group marked with \"_Reject IE_ \" which the receiving node does not
comprehend; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed.
The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the rejection of one
or more IEs/IE group using the message normally used to report unsuccessful
outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating
message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to
be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the
procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and
initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
report unsuccessful outcome is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with \"_Reject IE_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication
procedure.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs marked with
\"_Reject IE_ \", that the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving
node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate
local error handling.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" which the
receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the
content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as
if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the
reporting) using the understood IEs/IE groups, and report in the response
message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored. In
case the information received in the initiating message was insufficient to
determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response
message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate
the Error Indication procedure.
\- if a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
report the outcome of the procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE
groups marked with \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" which the receiving node
does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using
the understood IEs/IE groups, and initiate the Error Indication procedure to
report that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" which the receiving node does
not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using
the understood IEs/IE groups and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
**Ignore IE:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Ignore IE_ \" which the receiving node does not
comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE
groups.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with \"_Ignore IE_ \" which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups
and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were
not received using the understood IEs/IE groups.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Reject IE_ \" or
\"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" using a response message defined for the
procedure, the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be
included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with \"_Reject IE_ \" or
\"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" using the Error Indication procedure, the
_Procedure Code_ IE, the _Triggering Message_ IE, _Procedure Criticality_ IE,
and the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be included in
the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group.
### 10.3.5 Missing IE or IE group
The receiving node shall treat the missing IE/IE group according to the
criticality information for the missing IE/IE group in the received message
specified in the version of this specification used by the receiver:
**Reject IE:**
\- if a received message _initiating_ a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Reject IE_ \"; none of the
functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall
reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message
normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the
information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a
value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to
report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall
instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- if a received message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message
to report unsuccessful outcome is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality \"_Reject IE_ \", the receiving node shall terminate the
procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- if a received _response_ message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality \"_Reject IE_ , the receiving node shall consider the
procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- if a received message _initiating_ a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \",
the receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with
the procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and
report in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups
were missing. In case the information received in the initiating message was
insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present
in the response message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the
procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- if a received message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message
to report the outcome of the procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups
with specified criticality \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \", the receiving
node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure
based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error
Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
\- if a received _response_ message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \", the receiving node
shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based
on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error
Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
**Ignore IE:**
\- if a received message _initiating_ a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Ignore IE_ \", the receiving node
shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based
on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
\- if a received _response_ message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality \"_Ignore IE_ \", the receiving node shall ignore that
those IEs/IE groups are missing and continue with the procedure based on the
other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Reject IE_
\" or \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" using a response message defined for
the procedure, the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be
included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality \"_Reject IE_
\" or \"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ \" using the Error Indication procedure,
the _Procedure Code_ IE, the _Triggering Message_ IE, _Procedure Criticality_
IE, and the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be included
in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group.
### 10.3.6 IEs or IE groups received in wrong order or with too many
occurrences or erroneously present
If a message with IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences
is received or if IEs or IE groups with a conditional presence are present
when the condition is not met (i.e., erroneously present), the receiving node
shall behave according to the following:
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing IEs or IE
groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present,
none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The
receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the cause value
\"Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)\" using the message
normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the
information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a
value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to
report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall
instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
report unsuccessful outcome is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong
order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node
shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure, and
use cause value \"Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)\".
\- If a _response_ message is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong
order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node
shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local
error handling.
When determining the correct order only the IEs specified in the specification
version used by the receiver shall be considered.
## 10.4 Logical Error
Logical error situations occur when a message is comprehended correctly, but
the information contained within the message is not valid (i.e., semantic
error), or describes a procedure which is not compatible with the state of the
receiver. In these conditions, the following behaviour shall be performed
(unless otherwise specified) as defined by the class of the elementary
procedure, irrespective of the criticality information of the IEs/IE groups
containing the erroneous values.
**Class 1:**
Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 1 procedure,
and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, this
message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value. Typical cause values
are:
\- Semantic Error.
\- Message not compatible with receiver state.
Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 1
procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this
unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error
Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The
_Procedure Code_ IE and the _Triggering Message_ IE within the _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE shall then be included in order to identify the message
containing the logical error.
Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 1 procedure,
the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error
handling shall be initiated.
**Class 2:**
Where the logical error occurs in a message of a class 2 procedure, the
procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall be
initiated with an appropriate cause value. The _Procedure Code_ IE and the
_Triggering Message_ IE within the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall then be
included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
## 10.5 Exceptions
The error handling for all the cases described hereafter shall take precedence
over any other error handling described in the other subclauses of clause 10.
\- If any type of error (Transfer Syntax Error, Abstract Syntax Error or
Logical Error) is detected in the ERROR INDICATION message, it shall not
trigger the Error Indication procedure in the receiving Node but local error
handling.
\- In case a response message or Error Indication message needs to be
returned, but the information necessary to determine the receiver of that
message is missing, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully
terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
\- If an error that terminates a procedure occurs, the returned cause value
shall reflect the error that caused the termination of the procedure even if
one or more abstract syntax errors with criticality \"ignore and notify\" have
earlier occurred within the same procedure.
\- If an AP ID error is detected, the error handling as described in subclause
10.6 shall be applied.
## 10.6 Handling of AP ID
NOTE: **The \"first message\", the \"first returned message\" and the \"last
message\" as used below correspond to messages for a UE-associated logical
connection. The \"first message\" has a new AP ID from the sending node and
the \"first returned message\" is the first response message, which has a new
AP ID from the node sending the \"first returned message\". Thereafter the two
AP IDs are included in all messages over the** UE-associated logical
connection unless otherwise allowed by the specification. The \"last message\"
is a message sent by a node in order to complete the termination of a given
UE-associated logical connection, such that no other messages for the same
connection are expected in either direction. The nodes should ensure as far as
possible that previously allocated AP ID are not immediately reused.
**If a node receives a first returned message that includes an unknown local
AP ID, the receiving node shall initiate an Error Indication procedure with
inclusion of the received AP IDs from the peer node and an appropriate cause
value. Both nodes shall initiate a local release of any established UE-
associated logical connection (for the same NG interface) having these AP IDs
as local or remote identifier.**
**If a node receives a message (other than the first or first returned
messages) including an erroneous AP ID that is either an unknown local AP ID,
or an inconsistent remote AP ID (i.e. it is different to the remote AP ID
stored previously for this UE-associated logical connection) for the same NG
interface:**
\- if this message is not the last message for this UE-associated logical
connection, the node shall initiate an Error Indication procedure with
inclusion of the received AP ID(s) from the peer node and an appropriate cause
value. Both nodes shall initiate a local release of any established UE-
associated logical connection (for the same NG interface) having the erroneous
AP ID as either the local or remote identifier.
\- if this message is the last message for this UE-associated logical
connection, the receiving node shall initiate a local release of any
established UE-associated logical connection (for the same NG interface)
having the erroneous AP ID as either the local or remote identifier.
