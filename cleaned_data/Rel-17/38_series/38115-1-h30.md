In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Radio Frequency (RF) test methods and
conformance requirements for NR repeater _type 1-C_. These have been derived
from, and are consistent with the conducted requirements for _repeater type
1-C_ in NR repeater specification defined in TS 38.106 [2].
A _repeater type 1-C_ only has conducted requirements so it requires
compliance to this specification only.
_Arepeater type 2-O_ has only radiated requirements so it requires compliance
to TS 38.115-2 [3] only.

# 4 General conducted test conditions and declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in part 1 of
this specification, i.e. to all conducted tests defined for FR1. The frequency
ranges FR1 and FR2 are defined in clause 5.1 of TS 38.106 [2].
The minimum requirements are given in TS 38.106 [2]. Test Tolerances for the
conducted test requirements explicitly stated in the present document are
given in annex C of the present document.
Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The Test Tolerances
are used to relax the minimum requirements to create test requirements.
When a test requirement differs from the corresponding minimum requirement,
then the Test Tolerance applied for the test is non-zero. The Test Tolerance
for the test and the explanation of how the minimum requirement has been
relaxed by the Test Tolerance are given in annex C.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
#### 4.1.2.1 General
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test defined explicitly in the present specification, where appropriate.
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System for test requirements
included by reference is defined in the respective referred test
specification.
The Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the test case to be
adjusted to within the specified tolerance and the equipment under test to be
measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the specified values. All
tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and are valid for a
confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95 % is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95 % of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests, it should be noted that the uncertainties in clause 4.1.2 apply
to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load and do not include
system effects due to mismatch between the DUT and the Test System.
#### 4.1.2.2 Conducted characteristics measurements
Table 4.1.2.2-1: Maximum Test System uncertainty for conducted characteristics
tests
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Clause | Maximum Test System | Derivation of Test | | | Uncertainty | System Uncertainty | +======================+======================+======================+ | 6.2 Repeater output | Â±0.7 dB, f â‰¤ 3 GHz | | | power | | | | | Â±1.0 dB, 3 GHz \ 20MHz: Â±1.2 dB | | | | | | | | Absolute power Â±2.0 | | | | dB, f â‰¤ 3 GHz | | | | | | | | Absolute power Â±2.5 | | | | dB, 3 GHz \ -60 | | | | dBm Â±2,0 dB\ | | | | for results \ -60 | | | | dBm Â±2,0 dB\ | | | | for results \ \- Declared maximum repeater RF Bandwidth supported shall be used (D.18);
\- Select the carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2 and place it adjacent to
the lower _passband_ edge. If the width of the _passband_ is at least twice
the bandwidth of the signal to be tested then place a second signal adjacent
to the upper _passband_ edge. Otherwise reposition the carrier to be tested
according to the single carrier test frequencies described in section 4.9.1.
The test configuration should be constructed sequentially on a per band basis
using the same _antenna connector_. All configured component carriers are
transmitted simultaneously in the tests where the repeater should be ON.
#### 4.7.3.2 RTC1 power allocation
Set the power spectral density of each carrier to the same level so that the
sum of the carrier powers equals the expected input power to the repeater for
the test (i.e., either P~rated,in~ or P~rated,in~ + 10dB) according to the
manufacturer\'s declaration in clause 4.6.
### 4.7.5 RTC2: Non-contiguous spectrum operation
The purpose of RTC2 is to test all repeater requirements that need an input
signal in the _passband_ when there is more than one _passband_ per _operating
band_.
#### 4.7.5.1 RTC2 generation
RTC2 is constructed on a per band basis using the following method:
\- The repeater _passband_ bandwidths shall be the declared maximum repeater
RF Bandwidth supported for multiple passbands (D.18). The repeater RF
Bandwidth consists of one sub-block gap and the two highest and lowest
declared _passbands_ .
\- For each _passband_ , select the carrier to be tested according to 4.7.2.
If the the width of the _passband_ is at least twice that of the carrier to be
tested then place a carrier adjacent to the upper _passband_ edge and another
carrier (as described in 4.7.2) adjacent to the lower _passband_ edge.
Otherwise, tests shall be applied with one carrier adjacent to the lower sub-
block edge and one carrier adjacent to the upper sub-block edge for each sub-
block gap.
\- The sub-block edges adjacent to the sub-block gap shall be determined using
the specified F~offset_high~ and F~offset_low~ for the carriers adjacent to
the sub-block gap.
#### 4.7.5.2 RTC2 power allocation
Set the power of each carrier to the same level so that the sum of the carrier
powers equals the expected input power to the repeater for the test (i.e.,
either P~rated,in~ or P~rated,in~ + 10dB) according to the manufacturer\'s
declaration in clause 4.6.
### 4.7.6 RTC3: Multi-band test configuration for full carrier allocation
The purpose of RTC3 is to test multi-band operation aspects.
#### 4.7.6.1 RTC3 generation
RTC3 is based on re-using the previously specified test configurations
applicable per band involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed using
the following method:
\- The repeater RF Bandwidth of each supported operating band shall be the
declared maximum repeater RF Bandwidth in multi-band operation (D.19).
\- The number of carriers of each supported _operating band_ shall be
sufficient to fill all of the _passbands_ with one or two carriers (depending
on the passband bandwidth). Carriers shall be selected according to 4.7.2 and
shall first be placed at the outermost edges of the declared repeater Radio
Bandwidth. Additional carriers shall next be placed at the repeater RF
Bandwidths edges, if possible.
\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and the
carrier placement in each band shall be according to RTC1, where the declared
parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. The mirror image of the
single-band test configuration shall be used in each alternate band(s) and in
the highest band.
\- If the bandwidth of any _passband_ is insufficient to accommodate two
carriers then tests shall be repeated with the test carriers positioned such
that there is a carrier adjacent to the lower edge of a sub-block gap or
inter-band gap and a carrier adjacent to the upper edge of the sub-block gap
or inter-band gap, for each sub-block gap or inter-block gap.
#### 4.7.6.2 RTC3 power allocation
Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
_operating bands_ to the same level so that the sum of the carrier powers
equals the expected input power to the repeater for the test (i.e., either
P~rated,in~ or P~rated,in~ + 10dB) according to the manufacturer\'s
declaration in clause 4.6.
### 4.7.7 RTC4: Multi-band test configuration with high PSD per carrier
The purpose of RTC4 is to test multi-band operation aspects considering higher
PSD cases with reduced number of carriers and non-contiguous operation (if
supported) in multi-band mode.
#### 4.7.7.1 RTC4 generation
RTC4 is based on re-using the existing test configuration applicable per band
involved in multi-band operation. It is constructed using the following
method:
\- The repeater RF Bandwidth of each supported _operating band_ shall be the
declared maximum repeater RF Bandwidth in multi-band operation (D.19).
\- The allocated repeater RF Bandwidth of the outermost bands shall be located
at the outermost edges of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth.
\- The maximum number of carriers is limited to two per band. Carriers shall
be selected according to 4.7.2 and shall first be placed at the outermost
edges of the declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth for outermost bands and at the
Repeater RF Bandwidths edges for middle band(s) if any. Additional carriers
shall next be placed at the Repeater RF Bandwidths edges, if possible.
\- Each concerned band shall be considered as an independent band and the
carrier placement in each band shall be according to RTC3, where the declared
parameters for multi-band operation shall apply. Narrowest supported NR
channel bandwidth and smallest subcarrier spacing shall be used in the test
configuration.
\- If only one carrier can be placed for the concerned band(s), the carrier(s)
shall be placed at the outermost edges of the declared maximum radio bandwidth
for outermost band(s) and at one of the outermost edges of the supported
frequency range within the Base Station RF Bandwidths for middle band(s) if
any.
#### 4.7.7.2 RTC4 power allocation
Unless otherwise stated, set the power of each carrier in all supported
operating bands to the same level so that the sum of the carrier powers equals
the expected input power to the repeater for the test (i.e., either
P~rated,in~ or P~rated,in~ + 10dB) according to the manufacturer\'s
declaration in clause 4.6.
## 4.8 Applicability of requirements
### 4.8.1 General
### 4.8.2 Applicability of test configurations for single-band operation
The applicable test configurations are specified in the tables below for each
the supported RF configuration, which shall be declared according to clause
4.6. The generation and power allocation for each test configuration is
defined in clause 4.7. This clause contains the test configurations for a
repeater capable of single carrier, and/or multi-carrier operation in both
contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum in single band.
For a repeater declared to support a single _passband_ within a single band
(D.2), the test configurations in the second column of table 4.8.3-1 shall be
used for testing.

band (D.2) and where the parameters in the manufacture\'s declaration
according to clause 4.6 are identical for all passbands, the test
configurations in the third column of table 4.8.3-1 shall be used for testing.
For a repeater declared to support more than one _passband_ within a single
band (D.2) and where the parameters in the manufacture\'s declaration

## 4.9 RF channels and test models
### 4.9.1 RF channels
For the single passband testing many tests in this TS are performed with
appropriate frequencies in the bottom, middle and top channels of the
supported frequency range of the repeater. These are denoted as RF channels B
(bottom), M (middle) and T (top).
Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed with a single passband at
each of the RF channels B, M and T.
Many tests in this TS are performed with the maximum repeater RF Bandwidth
located at the bottom, middle and top of the supported frequency range in the
operating band. These are denoted as B~RFBW~ (bottom), M~RFBW~ (middle) and
T~RFBW~ (top).
Unless otherwise stated, the test shall be performed at B~RFBW~, M~RFBW~ and
T~RFBW~ defined as following:
\- B~RFBW~: maximum repeater RF Bandwidth located at the bottom of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.
\- M~RFBW~: maximum repeater RF Bandwidth located in the middle of the
supported frequency range in the operating band.
\- T~RFBW~: maximum repeater RF Bandwidth located at the top of the supported
frequency range in the operating band.
For repeater capable of multi-band operation, unless otherwise stated, the
test shall be performed at B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ defined as
following:
\- B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~: the _repeater RF Bandwidths_ located at the bottom of
the supported frequency range in the lowest operating band and at the highest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum Radio Bandwidth,
in the highest operating band.
\- B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW:~ the _repeater RF Bandwidths_ located at the top of the
supported frequency range in the highest operating band and at the lowest
possible simultaneous frequency position, within the Maximum Radio Bandwidth,
in the lowest operating band.
NOTE: B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ = B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ = B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ when the
declared Maximum Radio Bandwidth spans all operating bands. B~RFBW~_T~RFBW~
means the _repeater RF Bandwidths_ are located at the bottom of the supported
frequency range in the lower operating band and at the top of the supported

## 4.10 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
A spectrum allocation where a repeater operates can either be contiguous or
non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for repeater configured for both contiguous spectrum
operation and non-contiguous spectrum operation.
For repeater operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply
both at the repeater _passband_ edges and inside the sub-block gaps. For each
such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply relative to the repeater
_passband_ edges and the sub-block edges respectively.
## 4.11 Requirements for repeater capable of multi-band operation
For _multi-band connector_ the conducted test requirements in clause 6 and 7
apply separately to each supported _operating band_ unless otherwise stated.
For some conducted test requirements, it is explicitly stated that specific
additions or exclusions to the requirement apply at _multi-band connector(s)_
as detailed in the requirement clause. For repeater capable of multi-band
operation, various structures in terms of combinations of different
transceivers in downlink and transceivers in uplink implementations (multi-
band or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more _antenna_
_connectors_ for _repeater type 1-C_ in different ways are possible. For
_multi-band connector(s)_ the exclusions or provisions for multi-band apply.
For _single-band connector(s)_ , the following applies:
\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, _operating band_ unwanted
emissions, ACLR, output intermodulation, ACRR and receiver spurious emissions
requirements apply to this _connector_ that is mapped to single-band.
\- If the repeater is configured for single-band operation, _single-band
requirements_ shall apply to this connector configured for single-band
operation and no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable repeater are
applicable. _Single-band requirements_ are tested separately at the connector
configured for single-band operation, with all other connectors terminated.
For _multi-band connectors_ supporting the bands for TDD, the RF requirements
in the present specification assume no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur
between the bands.
NOTE 1: The conducted test requirements for multi-band connectors supporting
bands for both FDD and TDD are not covered by the present release of this
specification.

For the NR operation in NR operating bands specification, their channel
bandwidth configurations, channel spacing and raster, as well as
synchronization raster specification, refer to TS 38.106 [2], clause 5 and its
relevant clauses.
For the conducted testing purposes in this specification, only FR1 operating
bands are considered.
# 6 Conducted characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the conducted transmitter characteristics are
specified at the _antenna connector_ for _repeater type 1-C_ configuration in
normal operating conditions.

The Cumulative Adjacent Channel Leakage power Ratio (CACLR) in a _gap between
passband_ or the _inter-passband gap_ is the ratio of:

frequencies for the two carriers adjacent to each side of the _gap between
passband_ or the _inter-passband gap_ , and
b) the filtered mean power centred on a frequency channel adjacent to one of
the respective _repeater type 1-C passband edges_.

### 6.5.3 Operating band unwanted emissions
#### 6.5.3.1 Definition and applicability
Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE) limits
for _repeater type 1-C_ DL are defined from Î”f~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported downlink _operating band_ up to Î”f~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of each supported downlink _operating band_. The values of
Î”f~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1â€‘1 for the NR _operating bands_.
Unless otherwise stated, the operating band unwanted emission (OBUE) limits
for _repeater type 1-C_ UL are defined from Î”f~OBUE~ below the lowest
frequency of each supported uplink _operating band_ up to Î”f~OBUE~ above the
highest frequency of each supported uplink _operating band_. The values of
Î”f~OBUE~ are defined in table 6.5.1â€‘2 for the NR _operating bands_.
The requirements shall apply whatever the type of transmitter considered and
for all transmission modes foreseen by the manufacturer's specification. In
addition, for _repeater type 1-C_ operating in _non-contiguous spectrum_ , the
requirements apply inside any _gap between passband_. In addition, for a
_repeater type 1-C_ operating in multiple bands, the requirements apply inside
any _inter-passband_ _gap_.
_Limits_ are specified in the tables below, where:
\- âˆ†f is the separation between the _passband edge_ frequency and the nominal
-3dB point of the measuring filter closest to the carrier frequency.
\- f_offset is the separation between the _passband edge_ frequency and the
centre of the measuring filter.
\- f_offset~max~ is the offset to the frequency Î”f~OBUE~ outside the downlink
_operating band of repeater type 1-C DL and uplink operating band of repeater
type 1-C UL_ , where Î”f~OBUE~ is defined in tables 6.5.1-1 and 6.5.1-2.
\- âˆ†f~max~ is equal to f_offset~max~ minus half of the bandwidth of the
measuring filter.

The following requirement may be applied for the protection of PHS. This
requirement is also applicable at specified frequencies falling between
Î”f~OBUE~ below the lowest repeater transmitter frequency of the downlink
_operating band_ and Î”f~OBUE~ above the highest repeater transmitter frequency
of the downlink _operating band_. Î”f~OBUE~ is defined in clause 6.5.1.

NOTE: The resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should be equal to
the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement accuracy,
sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the
measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than the
measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the measurement
bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement
bandwidth.
NOTE: The regional requirement, included in [14], is defined in terms of EIRP,
which is dependent on both the repeater emissions at the _antenna connector_
and the deployment (including antenna gain and feeder loss). The requirement
defined above provides the characteristics of the base station needed to
verify compliance with the regional requirement. The assessment of the EIRP
level is described in Annex F.

##### 6.5.4.5.3 Co-location with base stations and _repeater type 1-C_ Nodes
These requirements may be applied for the protection of other BS, IAB-DU, IAB-
MT and _repeater type 1-C_ receivers when GSM900, DCS1800, PCS1900, GSM850,
CDMA850, UTRA FDD, UTRA TDD, E-UTRA, NR BS, IAB-DU, IAB-MT, or _repeater type
1-C_ are co-located with _repeater type 1-C_.
The requirements assume a 30 dB coupling loss between transmitter and receiver
and are based on co-location with same class.
The _minimum requirements_ are in table 6.5.4.5.3-1 for a _repeater type 1-C_.
Requirements for co-location with a system listed in the first column apply,
depending on the declared _repeater type 1-C_ class. For a _multi-band
connector_ , the exclusions and conditions in the Note column of table
6.5.4.5.3-1 shall apply for each supported _operating band_.

NOTE 1: As defined in the scope for spurious emissions in this clause, the co-
location requirements in table 6.5.4.5.3-1 do not apply for the frequency
range extending Î”f~OBUE~ immediately outside the transmit frequency range of a
_repeater type 1-C_. The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a
single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent
frequencies for 30dB antenna to antenna minimum coupling loss. However, there
are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are
addressed in TR 25.942 [15].
NOTE 2: Table 6.5.4.5.3-1 assumes that two _operating bands_ , where the
corresponding transmit and receive frequency ranges would be overlapping, are
not deployed in the same geographical area. For such a case of operation with
overlapping frequency arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-
location requirements may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP
specifications.
### 6.5.5 Receiver spurious emissions
#### 6.5.5.1 Definition and applicability
The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver unit that appear at the _antenna connector_. The
requirements only apply to _repeater type 1-C_ for TDD operation.
For each a _ntenna connectors_ on BS-side and UE-side supporting both RX and
TX in TDD, the requirements apply during the _transmitter OFF state_. For
_antenna connectors_ both BS-side and UE-side in FDD, the RX spurious
emissions requirements are superseded by the TX spurious emissions
requirements, as specified in clause 6.5.4.5.
For _multi-band_ _connectors_ that both transmit and receive in _operating
band_ supporting TDD, RX spurious emissions requirements are applicable during
the _TX OFF state_ , and are subject to exclusion zones in each supported
_operating band_.
For Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, the sum of receiver spurious
emissions requirements over all _antenna connectors_ for _repeater type 1-C_
shall not exceed _minimum requirements_ defined in clause 6.5.5.5.
#### 6.5.5.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirements are in TS 38.106 [2], clause 6.5.5.2.
#### 6.5.5.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the repeater to limit the
interference caused by receiver spurious emissions to other systems.
#### 6.5.5.4 Method of test
##### 6.5.5.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: Normal; see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier: M; see clause 4.9.1.
##### 6.5.5.4.2 Procedure
The minimum requirement is applied to all connectors under test,
1) Connect the connector under test to measurement equipment as shown in annex
D.9.
2) Ensure the transmitter is OFF.
3) Set the measurement equipment parameters as specified in table 6.5.5.5-1.
4) Measure the spurious emissions over each frequency range described in table
6.5.5.5-1.
In addition, for a _multi-band_ _connector_ , the following steps shall apply:
5) For _multi-band_ _connector_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
#### 6.5.5.5 Test requirements
The receiver spurious emissions requirements for _repeater type 1-C_ are that
for each _antenna connector,_ the power of emissions shall not exceed the
value specified in table 6.5.5.5-1.

## 6.6 Repeater Error Vector Magnitude
### 6.6.1 Downlink repeater error vector magnitude
#### 6.6.1.1 General
The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude (EVM) is a measure of the difference
between the symbols provided at the input of repeater and the measured signal
symbols at the output of the repeater after the equalization by the
measurement equipment. This difference is called the error vector. Details
about how the repeater EVM is determined are the same as specified in TS
38.104 Annex B for FR1. The repeater EVM result is defined as the square root
of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power
expressed in percent. The accuracy of the input symbols is counted in the
measurement uncertainty.
The repeater EVM requirement is applicable for a repeater operating at an
input power in the range from what is required to reach the maximum output
power to the minimum power level in table 6.6.1.1-1.

\- B~RFBW~_T\'~RFBW~ and B\'~RFBW~_T~RFBW~ in multi-band operation, see clause
4.9.1.
##### 6.6.1.4.2 Procedure
The minimum requirement is applied to all _antenna connectors_ , they may be
tested one at a time or multiple _antenna connectors_ may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.1.1 for _repeater type 1-C_. Whichever method is
used the procedure is repeated until all _antenna connectors_ necessary to
demonstrate conformance have been tested.
1) For an _antenna connector_ declared to be capable of single carrier
operation only (D.16), set the _antenna connector_ under test to transmit a
signal according to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the
corresponding test models:
\- RDL-FR1-TM3.1a if 256QAM is supported by repeater without power back off,
or
\- RDL-FR1-TM3.1a at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power if 256QAM is
supported by repeater with power back off, and RDL-FR1-TM3.1 at maximum power,
or
\- RDL-FR1-TM3.1 if highest modulation order supported by repeater is 64QAM,
or
\- RDL-FR1-TM3.2 if highest modulation order supported by repeater is 16QAM,
or
\- RDL-FR1-TM3.3 if highest modulation order supported by repeater is QPSK.
For an _antenna connector_ declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation
(D.15-D.16), set the _antenna connector_ under test to transmit according to
the applicable test configuration and corresponding power setting specified in
clauses 4.7 and 4.8 using the corresponding test models on all carriers
configured:
\- RDL-FR1-TM3.1a if 256QAM is supported by repeater without power back off,
or
\- RDL-FR1-TM3.1a at manufacturer\'s declared rated output power if 256QAM is
supported by repeater with power back off, and RDL-FR1-TM3.1 at maximum power,
or
\- RDL-FR1-TM3.1 if highest modulation order supported by repeater is 64QAM,
or
\- RDL-FR1-TM3.2 if highest modulation order supported by repeater is 16QAM,
or
\- RDL-FR1-TM3.3 if highest modulation order supported by repeater is QPSK.
For RDL-FR1-TM3.1a, power back-off shall be applied if it is declared.
2) Measure the repeater EVM and frequency error as defined in annex H.
3) Repeat steps 1 and 2 for RDL-FR1-TM2 if 256QAM is not supported by repeater
or for RDL-FR1-TM2a if 256QAM is supported by repeater . For RDL-FR1-TM2 and
RDL-FR1-TM2a, the OFDM symbol TX power (OSTP) shall be at the lower limit of
the dynamic range according to the test procedure in clause 6.3.3.4 and test
requirements in clause 6.3.3.5.
In addition, for _multi-band connector(s)_ , the following steps shall apply:
4) For _multi-band connectors_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band.

### 6.6.2 Uplink repeater error vector magnitude
#### 6.6.2.1 General
The Repeater Error Vector Magnitude is a measure of the difference between the
reference waveform provided at the input of the repeater and the measured
waveform at the output of the repeater. This difference is called the error
vector. Details about how the repeater EVM is determined are the same as
specified in TS 38.101-1[9] Annex F. Before calculating the repeater EVM the
measured waveform is corrected by the sample timing offset and RF frequency
offset. Then the carrier leakage shall be removed from the measured waveform
before calculating the repeater EVM.
The measured waveform is further equalised using the channel estimates
subjected to the repeater EVM equaliser spectrum flatness requirement
specified in TS 38.101-1[9] clause 6.4.2.4. For DFT-s-OFDM waveforms, the
repeater EVM result is defined after the front-end FFT and IDFT as the square
root of the ratio of the mean error vector power to the mean reference power
expressed as a %. For CP-OFDM waveforms, the repeater EVM result is defined
after the front-end FFT as the square root of the ratio of the mean error
vector power to the mean reference power expressed as a %. The accuracy of the
input waveform is counted in the measurement uncertainty.
The basic repeater EVM measurement interval in one slot in the time domain.
The repeater EVM measurement interval is reduced by any symbols that contains
an allowable power transient in the measurement interval, as defined in TS
38.101-1 [9] clause 6.3.3 for EVM for UE.
The repeater EVM requirement is applicable for a repeater operating at an
input power in the range from what is required to reach the maximum output
power to the minimum power level in table 6.6.2.1-1.

supported by repeater with power back off, and RUL-FR1-TM3.1 at maximum power,
or
\- RUL-FR1-TM3.1 with highest modulation order supported by repeater.
For an _antenna connector_ declared to be capable of multi-carrier operation
(D.15-D.16), set the _antenna connector_ under test to transmit according to

## 6.7 Input intermodulation
### 6.7.1 Definition and applicability
#### 6.7.1.1 General
The input intermodulation is a measure of the capability of the Repeater to
inhibit the generation of interference in the passband, in the presence of
interfering signals on frequencies other than the passband.
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the Repeater to maintain
the wanted frequency free of internally created interference.
The measurements shall apply to both uplink and downlink paths of the
Repeater, during the _transmitter ON state_ at maximum gain.
#### 6.7.1.2 Minimum requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 38.106 [2] clauses 6.7.1.2, 6.7.2.2 and
6.7.3.2.
#### 6.7.1.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to verify that the Repeater meets the
intermodulation characteristics requirements as specified by the minimum
requirements.
#### 6.7.1.4 Method of test
##### 6.7.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex A.2
A measurement system set-up is shown in Annex D.
1) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.
2) Connect two signal generators with a combining circuit or one signal
generator with the ability to generate several CW carriers to the input.
3) Connect a spectrum analyser to the output of the Repeater.
##### 6.7.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Adjust the frequency of the input signals, either below or above the
passband, so that one carrier, f~1~, is 1 MHz outside the channel edge
frequency of the first or last channel in the passband, and the lowest order
intermodulation product from the two carriers is positioned in the centre of
the passband.
2) Measure the increase in output power in the passband when the interferer is
applied.
3) Repeat the measurement for the opposite path of the Repeater.
#### 6.7.1.5 Test requirements
##### 6.7.1.5.1 General requirement
The intermodulation performance should be met when the following signals are
applied to the NR Repeater:
Table 6.7.1.5.1-1: Input intermodulation requirement
f~1~ offset Interfering Signal Levels Type of signals Measurement bandwidth
* * *
1,0 MHz -40 dBm 2 CW carriers 1 MHz
f~1~ offset is the offset from the channel edge frequency of the first or last
channel in the passband of the closer carrier.
For the parameters specified in Table 6.7.1.5.1-1, the power in the pass band
shall not increase by more than [10+TT] dB at the output of the Repeater as
measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained
without interfering signals applied.
##### 6.7.1.5.2 Co-location with BS/Repeater in other systems
This additional input intermodulation requirement may be applied for the
protection of NR repeater receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS or
repeater operating in a different frequency band are co-located with a NR
repeater.
The following requirement applies for interfering signals depending on the
repeaters _passband_.
This requirement applies to the uplink and downlink of the repeater. If the BS
side is declared to meet co-location requirements, then it should meet input
intermodulation co-location requirements for the downlink. If the UE side is
declared to meet co-location requirements, then it should meet input
intermodulation co-location requirements for the uplink.

NOTE 1: The co-location requirements in Table 6.7.1.5.2-1 and 6.7.1.5.2-2 do
not apply when the Repeaters passband frequency range is adjacent to the
frequency range of the co-location requirement in the Table 6.7.1.5.2-1 or
Table 6.7.1.5.2-2. The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a
single generic solution for co-location with other system on adjacent
frequencies for 30dB Repeater-BS minimum coupling loss. However, there are
certain site-engineering solutions that can be used. These techniques are
addressed in TR 25.942 [15].
NOTE 2: The Table 6.7.1.5.2-1 and Table 6.7.1.5.2-2 assumes that two operating
bands, where the corresponding BS or Repeater transmit and receive frequency
ranges would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same geographical area.
For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency arrangements in the
same geographical area, special co-location requirements may apply that are
not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
For the parameters specified in table Table 6.7.1.5.2-1 and 6.7.1.5.2-2, the
power in the passband shall not increase with more than [10 + TT] dB B at the
output of the repeater as measured in the centre of the passband, compared to
the level obtained without interfering signals applied.
##### 6.7.1.5.3 Co-existence with other systems
This input intermodulation existence requirement may be applied for the
protection of NR repeater receivers when GSM, CDMA, UTRA, E-UTRA, NR BS or
repeater operating in another frequency band co-exist with a NR repeater.
The intermodulation performance should be met when the signals in Table
6.7.1.5.3-1 are applied to the Repeater:
Table 6.7.1.5.3-1: input intermodulation requirement for NR repeater when co-
exist with BS/repeater in other non-overlapping frequency bands
Frequency range of interfering signal Interfering signal mean power (dBm) Type

* * *
Frequency range of co-existence system _operating band_ -15 2 CW carriers 1MHz
NOTE 1: All the interfering signals should be limited into the frequency
ranges that are either X MHz higher than F~UL,high~ or X MHz lower than
F~UL,low~, where X equals to 20MHz when F~UL,high~ - F~UL,low~ is not larger
than 200MHz, otherwise X equals to 60MHz
NOTE 1: The co-existence requirements in Table 6.7.1.5.3-1 do not apply when
the repeaters pass band frequency range is adjacent to the frequency range of
the co-existence requirement in the Table 6.7.1.5.3-1. The current state-of-
the-art technology does not allow a single generic solution for co-existence.
NOTE 2: The Table 6.7.1.5.3-1 assumes that two operating bands, where the
frequency ranges would be overlapping, are not deployed in the same
geographical area. For such a case of operation with overlapping frequency
arrangements in the same geographical area, special co-existence requirements
may apply that are not covered by the 3GPP specifications.
For the parameters specified in Table 6.7.1.5.3-1, the power in the pass band
shall not increase with more than [10 + TT] dB at the output of the repeater
as measured in the centre of the pass band, compared to the level obtained
without interfering signals applied.
## 6.8 Output intermodulation
### 6.8.1 Definition and applicability
#### 6.8.1.1 General
The output intermodulation requirement is a measure of the capability of the
repeater to inhibit the generation of signals in its non-linear elements
caused by presence of the wanted signal and an interfering signal reaching the
repeater via the output port. The requirement shall apply during the
_transmitter ON period_ and the _transmitter transient period_.
The requirement shall apply to the uplink and downlink of the Repeater.
For _repeater type 1-C_ , the output intermodulation level is the power of the
intermodulation products when an interfering signal is injected into the
_antenna connector_.
#### 6.8.1.2 Minimum requirements
The minimum requirement is in TS 38.106 [2] clause 6.8.2.
#### 6.8.1.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the repeater to restrict the
generation of intermodulation products in the presence of a subject signal on
the repeater input and output ports, and an interfering signal applied at the
repeater output port.
#### 6.8.1.4 Method of test
##### 6.8.1.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see Annex A.2
A measurement system set-up is shown in Annex D.
1) Connect a signal generator to the input port of the Repeater (wanted
signal). Connect a signal generator to the output port (interfering signal)
and make sure the signal generator power is directed to the repeater output
port.
> 2) Detection mode: True RMS.
##### 6.8.1.4.2 Procedure
1) Set the Repeater to maximum gain.
2) Set the signal generator at the repeater input port (wanted signal) to
generate a signal in accordance to test model R-FR1-TM1.1, with a bandwidth as
defined in Table 6.8.1.5.1-1, at the level which produce the manufacturer
specified maximum output power at maximum gain.
3) Set the signal generator at the repeater output port (interference signal)
to generate a signal in accordance to test model R-FR1-TM1.1, with a
bandwidth, level and frequency offset as defined in Table 6.8.1.5.1-1.
4) Measure the emission at the specified frequencies with specified
measurement bandwidth as described in the test requirements and note that the
measured value does not exceed the specified value. Measurements in the band
of the interfering signal shall be excluded. The measurements can be limited
to the power of all third and fifth order intermodulation products.
5) Repeat the test from step 3 on until all interfering signal centre
frequency offsets in Table 6.8.1.5.1-1 has been tested, but exclude
interfering signal frequencies that are outside of the allocated frequency
band for NR downlink.
6) For repeater supporting Band n41 and n90 operation in Japan, repeat the
test using wanted and interfering signal parameters as defined in Table
6.8.1.5.2-1.
NOTE: As a general rule the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment
should be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity and efficiency, the resolution bandwidth can be smaller
than the measurement bandwidth. When the resolution bandwidth is smaller than
the measurement bandwidth, the result should be integrated over the
measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the equivalent noise bandwidth of the
measurement bandwidth.

## 6.9 Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR)
### 6.9.1 Definitions and applicability
Adjacent Channel Rejection Ratio (ACRR) is the ratio of the average gain over
a carrier of the repeater in the _passband_ to the average gain of the
repeater over an adjacent channel outside the repeater _passband_. The carrier
in the _passband_ and in the adjacent channel shall be of the same type
(reference carrier) with bandwidths as defined by _nominal channel bandwidth_.
In case of Local Area repeater above 2496 MHz, the channel within the
_passband_ and the adjacent channel are assumed to have a bandwidth of 10 MHz
The requirement is differentiated between uplink and downlink.
The requirement shall apply during the _transmitter ON period_.

signals in geographic areas in which NR Repeater, NR BS, E-UTRA BS and UTRA BS
are deployed so that they serve adjacent channels. The reference carrier is a
NR carrier.
#### 6.9.2.1 Minimum requirements

## 6.10 Transmit ON/OFF power
### 6.10.1 Transmitter OFF power
#### 6.10.1.1 Definition and applicability
Transmit OFF power requirements apply only to TDD operation of the repeater.
The requirement applies to both downlink and uplink of the repeater.
Transmitter OFF power is defined as the mean power measured over 70/N us
filtered with a square filter of bandwidth equal to the _passband bandwidth_
of the repeater (BW~passband~) centred on the assigned channel frequency
during the _transmitter OFF state_. N = SCS/15, where SCS is Sub Carrier
Spacing in kHz of the input signal.
For _multi-band connectors_ and for _single band connectors_ supporting
transmission in multiple _operating bands_ , the requirement is only
applicable during the _transmitter OFF state_ in all supported _operating
bands_.
#### 6.10.1.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for _repeater type 1-C_ is in TS 38.106 [2], clause
6.10.1.2.
#### 6.10.1.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to verify the transmitter OFF power is within the
limits of the minimum requirements.
#### 6.10.1.4 Method of test
Requirement is tested together with transmitter transient period, as described
in clause 6.10.2.4.
#### 6.10.1.5 Test requirements
The conformance testing of transmit OFF power is included in the conformance
testing of transmitter transient period; therefore, see clause 6.10.2.5 for
test requirements.
### 6.10.2 Transmitter transient period
#### 6.10.2.1 Definition and applicability
_Transmitter transient period_ requirements apply only to TDD operation of the
repeater. The requirement applies to both downlink and uplink of the repeater.
The _transmitter transient state_ is the time period during which the
transmitter is changing from the _transmitter OFF state_ to the _transmitter
ON state_ or vice versa. The _transmitter transient period_ is illustrated in
figure 6.10.2.1-1.
Figure 6.10.2.1-1: Example of relations between transmitter _ON state_ ,
transmitter _OFF state_ and _transmitter transient period_
For _repeater type 1-C_ this requirement shall be applied at the _antenna
connector_ supporting transmission in the _operating ban_ d.
For a repeater that is not declared to be a long delay repeater (D.15), the
beginning and end point of downlink and uplink bursts are referenced to the
slot timing at the input.
For a repeater that is declared to be a long delay repeater (D.15), the
beginning and end point of downlink and uplink bursts are referenced to the
slot timing at the input plus the declared repeater delay.
#### 6.10.2.2 Minimum requirement
The minimum requirement for _repeater type 1-C_ is in TS 38.106 [2], clause
6.10.2.2.
#### 6.10.2.3 Test purpose
The purpose of this test is to verify the transmitter transient periods are
within the limits of the minimum requirements.
#### 6.10.2.4 Method of test
##### 6.10.2.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment:
\- normal; see annex B.2.
RF channels to be tested for single carrier:
\- M; see clause 4.9.1.
##### 6.10.2.4.2 Procedure
The minimum requirement is applied to all _antenna connectors_ , they may be
tested one at a time or multiple _antenna connectors_ may be tested in
parallel as shown in annex D.1.1. Whichever method is used the procedure is
repeated until all _antenna connectors_ necessary to demonstrate conformance
have been tested.
1) Connect _antenna connector_ for input and output signals to measurement
equipment as shown in annex D.1.1. All _antenna connectors_ not under test
shall be terminated.
As a general rule, the resolution bandwidth of the measuring equipment should
be equal to the measurement bandwidth. However, to improve measurement
accuracy, sensitivity, efficiency and avoiding e.g. carrier leakage, the
resolution bandwidth may be smaller than the measurement bandwidth. When the
resolution bandwidth is smaller than the measurement bandwidth, the result
should be integrated over the measurement bandwidth in order to obtain the
equivalent noise bandwidth of the measurement bandwidth.
2) Set the input signal to the representative connectors under test according
to the applicable test configuration in clause 4.8 using the corresponding
test models in clause 4.9.2 at the input power intended to produce the maximum
rated output power, P~rated,in,\ AC~ + 10dB.
3) Measure the mean power spectral density over 70/N Î¼s filtered with a square
filter of bandwidth equal to the RF bandwidth of the _antenna connector_
centred on the central frequency of the RF bandwidth. 70/N Î¼s average window
centre is set from 35/N Î¼s after end of one transmitter ON period + 10 Î¼s to
35/N Î¼s before start of next transmitter ON period \-- 10 Î¼s. N = SCS/15,
where SCS is Sub Carrier Spacing in kHz.
In addition, for _multi-band connector(s)_ , the following steps shall apply:
4) For _multi-band connectors_ and single band tests, repeat the steps above
per involved band where single band test configurations and test models shall
apply with no carrier activated in the other band.
6.10.2.5 Test requirements
For _repeater type 1-C downlink_ , the requirements for transmitter OFF power
spectral density shall be less than -83 dBm/MHz per _antenna connector_ for
carrier frequency f â‰¤ 3.0 GHz.
For _repeater type 1-C downlink_ , the requirements for transmitter OFF power
spectral density shall be less than -82.5 dBm/MHz per _antenna connector_ for
carrier frequency 3.0 GHz \20MHz

reference signal subcarriers are obtained by computing the moving average in
the frequency domain of the time-averaged demodulation reference signal
subcarriers. The moving average window size is 19 and averaging is over the
DM-RS subcarriers in the allocated RBs. For DM-RS subcarriers at or near the
edge of the channel, or when the number of available DM-RS subcarriers within
