takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Dormant BWP:** The dormant BWP is one of downlink BWPs configured by the
network via dedicated RRC signaling. In the dormant BWP, the UE stop
monitoring PDCCH on/for the SCell, but continues performing CSI measurements,
Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and beam management, if configured.
**DRX group:** **A group of Serving Cells that is configured by RRC and that
have the same DRX Active Time.**
**HARQ information:** HARQ information for DL-SCH, for UL-SCH, or for SL-SCH

identification information including cast type indicator, Source Layer-1 ID
and Destination Layer-1 ID, and Sidelink other information including CSI
request, a priority, a communication range requirement and Zone ID.
**Special Cell:** For Dual Connectivity operation the term Special Cell refers
to the PCell of the MCG or the PSCell of the SCG depending on if the MAC
entity is associated to the MCG or the SCG, respectively. Otherwise the term
Special Cell refers to the PCell. A Special Cell supports PUCCH transmission
and contention-based Random Access, and is always activated.

not traversing any network node.
NOTE 1: A timer is running once it is started, until it is stopped or until it
expires; otherwise it is not running. A timer can be started if it is not
running or restarted if it is running. A Timer is always started or restarted
from its initial value. The duration of a timer is not updated until it is
stopped or expires (e.g. due to BWP switching). When the MAC entity applies
zero value for a timer, the timer shall be started and immediately expire
unless explicitly stated otherwise.

description includes Positioning SRS except for the Positioning SRS for
transmission in RRC_INACTIVE as in clause 5.26. Positioning SRS except for the
Positioning SRS for transmission in RRC_INACTIVE is treated the same as SRS by
the UE unless explicitly stated otherwise.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Introduction
The objective of this clause is to describe the MAC architecture and the MAC
entity of the UE from a functional point of view.
## 4.2 MAC architecture
### 4.2.1 General
This clause describes a model of the MAC i.e. it does not specify or restrict
implementations.
RRC is in control of the MAC configuration.
### 4.2.2 MAC Entities
The MAC entity of the UE handles the following transport channels:
\- Broadcast Channel (BCH);
\- Downlink Shared Channel(s) (DL-SCH);
\- Paging Channel (PCH);
\- Uplink Shared Channel(s) (UL-SCH);
\- Random Access Channel(s) (RACH).
When the UE is configured with SCG, two MAC entities are configured to the UE:
one for the MCG and one for the SCG.
When the UE is configured with DAPS handover, two MAC entities are used by the
UE: one for the source cell (source MAC entity) and one for the target cell
(target MAC entity).
The functions of the different MAC entities in the UE operate independently
unless otherwise specified. The timers and parameters used in each MAC entity
are configured independently unless otherwise specified. The Serving Cells,
C-RNTI, radio bearers, logical channels, upper and lower layer entities, LCGs,
and HARQ entities considered by each MAC entity refer to those mapped to that
MAC entity unless otherwise specified.
If the MAC entity is configured with one or more SCells, there are multiple
DL-SCH and there may be multiple UL-SCH as well as multiple RACH per MAC
entity; one DL-SCH, one UL-SCH, and one RACH on the SpCell, one DL-SCH, zero
or one UL-SCH and zero or one RACH for each SCell.
If the MAC entity is not configured with any SCell, there is one DL-SCH, one
UL-SCH, and one RACH per MAC entity.
Figure 4.2.2-1 illustrates one possible structure of the MAC entity when SCG
is not configured and for each MAC entity during DAPS handover.
Figure 4.2.2-1: MAC structure overview
Figure 4.2.2-2 illustrates one possible structure for the MAC entities when
MCG and SCG are configured.
Figure 4.2.2-2: MAC structure overview with two MAC entities
In addition, the MAC entity of the UE handles the following transport channel
for sidelink:
\- Sidelink Shared Channel (SL-SCH);
\- Sidelink Broadcast Channel (SL-BCH).
Figure 4.2.2-3 illustrates one possible structure for the MAC entity when
sidelink is configured.
Figure 4.2.2-3: MAC structure overview for sidelink
## 4.3 Services
### 4.3.1 Services provided to upper layers
The MAC sublayer provides the following services to upper layers:
\- data transfer;
\- radio resource allocation.
### 4.3.2 Services expected from physical layer
The MAC sublayer expects the following services from the physical layer:
\- data transfer services;
\- signalling of HARQ feedback;
\- signalling of Scheduling Request;
\- measurements (e.g. Channel Quality Indication (CQI)).
## 4.4 Functions
The MAC sublayer supports the following functions:
\- mapping between logical channels and transport channels;
\- multiplexing of MAC SDUs from one or different logical channels onto
transport blocks (TB) to be delivered to the physical layer on transport
channels;
\- demultiplexing of MAC SDUs to one or different logical channels from
transport blocks (TB) delivered from the physical layer on transport channels;
\- scheduling information reporting;
\- error correction through HARQ;
\- logical channel prioritization;
\- priority handling between overlapping resources of one UE;
\- radio resource selection.
The relevance of MAC functions for uplink, downlink, and sidelink is indicated
in Table 4.4-1.

## 4.5 Channel structure
### 4.5.1 General
The MAC sublayer operates on the channels defined below; transport channels
are SAPs between MAC and Layer 1, logical channels are SAPs between MAC and
RLC.
### 4.5.2 Transport Channels
The MAC sublayer uses the transport channels listed in Table 4.5.2-1 below.

### 4.5.3 Logical Channels
The MAC sublayer provides data transfer services on logical channels. To
accommodate different kinds of data transfer services, multiple types of
logical channels are defined i.e. each supporting transfer of a particular
type of information.
Each logical channel type is defined by what type of information is
transferred.
The MAC sublayer provides the control and traffic channels listed in Table
4.5.3-1 below.

# 5 MAC procedures
## 5.1 Random Access procedure
### 5.1.1 Random Access procedure initialization
The Random Access procedure described in this clause is initiated by a PDCCH
order, by the MAC entity itself, or by RRC for the events in accordance with
TS 38.300 [2]. There is only one Random Access procedure ongoing at any point
in time in a MAC entity. The Random Access procedure on an SCell shall only be
initiated by a PDCCH order with _ra-PreambleIndex_ different from 0b000000.
NOTE 1: If a new Random Access procedure is triggered while another is already
ongoing in the MAC entity, it is up to UE implementation whether to continue
with the ongoing procedure or start with the new procedure (e.g. for SI
request).
NOTE 2: If there was an ongoing Random Access procedure that is triggered by a
PDCCH order while the UE receives another PDCCH order indicating the same
Random Access Preamble, PRACH mask index and uplink carrier, the Random Access
procedure is considered as the same Random Access procedure as the ongoing one
and not initialized again.
When a Random Access procedure is initiated, UE selects a set of Random Access
resources as specified in clause 5.1.1b and initialises the following
parameters for the Random Access procedure according to the values configured
by RRC for the selected set of Random Access resources:
\- _prach-ConfigurationIndex_ : the available set of PRACH occasions for the
transmission of the Random Access Preamble for Msg1. These are also applicable
to the MSGA PRACH if the PRACH occasions are shared between 2-step and 4-step

## 5.2 Maintenance of Uplink Time Alignment
RRC configures the following parameters for the maintenance of UL time
alignment:
\- _timeAlignmentTimer_ (per TAG) which controls how long the MAC entity
considers the Serving Cells belonging to the associated TAG to be uplink time
aligned;
\- _inactivePosSRS-TimeAlignmentTimer_ which controls how long the MAC entity
considers the Positioning SRS transmission in RRC_INACTIVE in clause 5.26 to
be uplink time aligned;
\- _cg-SDT-TimeAlignmentTimer_ which controls how long the MAC entity
considers the uplink transmission for CG-SDT to be uplink time aligned.
The MAC entity shall:

clause 5.26:
3> start or restart the _inactivePosSRS-TimeAlignmentTimer_ associated with
the indicated TAG.
2> if CG-SDT procedure is ongoing:
3> start or restart the _cg-SDT-TimeAlignmentTimer_ associated with PTAG.

2> flush all HARQ buffers;
2> maintain N~TA~ (defined in TS 38.211 [8]) of this TAG.
When the MAC entity stops uplink transmissions for an SCell due to the fact
that the maximum uplink transmission timing difference between TAGs of the MAC
entity or the maximum uplink transmission timing difference between TAGs of
any MAC entity of the UE is exceeded, the MAC entity considers the
_timeAlignmentTimer_ associated with the SCell as expired.
The MAC entity shall not perform any uplink transmission on a Serving Cell
except the Random Access Preamble and MSGA transmission when the
_timeAlignmentTimer_ associated with the TAG to which this Serving Cell
belongs is not running, CG-SDT procedure is not ongoing and SRS transmission
in RRC_INACTIVE as in clause 5.26 is not on-going. Furthermore, when the
_timeAlignmentTimer_ associated with the PTAG is not running, CG-SDT procedure
is not ongoing and SRS transmission in RRC_INACTIVE as in clause 5.26 is not
ongoing, the MAC entity shall not perform any uplink transmission on any
Serving Cell except the Random Access Preamble and MSGA transmission on the
SpCell. The MAC entity shall not perform any uplink transmission except the
Random Access Preamble and MSGA transmission when the _cg-SDT-
TimeAlignmentTimer_ is not running during the ongoing CG-SDT procedure as
triggered in clause 5.27 and the _inactivePosSRS-TimeAlignmentTimer_ is not
running.
## 5.2a Maintenance of UL Synchronization
The MAC entity shall for each Serving Cell:
1> if an indication of uplink synchronization has been received from upper
layers (see clause 5.2.2.6 of TS 38.331 [5]):
2> allow uplink transmission on the Serving Cell.
1> if an indication of uplink synchronization loss is received from upper
layers (see clause 5.2.2.6 of TS 38.331 [5]):
2> flush all HARQ buffers;
2> not perform any uplink transmission on the Serving Cell.
NOTE: The MAC entity suspends all UL operations (e.g. stop RACH, SR, and UL
HARQ operation) after receiving the indication of an uplink synchronization
loss and resumes the operation when receiving an indication of uplink
synchronization.
## 5.3 DL-SCH data transfer
### 5.3.1 DL Assignment reception
Downlink assignments received on the PDCCH both indicate that there is a
transmission on a DL-SCH for a particular MAC entity and provide the relevant
HARQ information.
When the MAC entity has a C-RNTI, Temporary C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, G-RNTI or G-CS-
RNTI, the MAC entity shall for each PDCCH occasion during which it monitors
PDCCH and for each Serving Cell:
1> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion and this Serving Cell has
been received on the PDCCH for the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI, or Temporary Câ€‘RNTI,
or G-RNTI configured for multicast MTCH:
2> if this is the first downlink assignment for this Temporary C-RNTI:
3> consider the NDI to have been toggled.
2> if the downlink assignment is for the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI, and if the
previous downlink assignment indicated to the HARQ entity of the same HARQ
process was either a downlink assignment received for the MAC entity\'s CS-
RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, or a configured downlink assignment for unicast or MBS
multicast; or
2> if the downlink assignment is for the MAC entity\'s G-RNTI configured for
multicast MTCH, and if the previous downlink assignment indicated to the HARQ
entity of the same HARQ process was either a downlink assignment received for
the MAC entity\'s CS-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, or other G-RNTI, or C-RNTI, or a
configured downlink assignment for unicast or MBS multicast:
3> consider the NDI to have been toggled regardless of the value of the NDI.
2> stop the _cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer_ , if it is running, for the
corresponding HARQ process for initial transmission with CCCH message;
2> stop the _configuredGrantTimer_ , if it is running, for the corresponding
HARQ process for initial transmission with CCCH message;
2> indicate the presence of a downlink assignment and deliver the associated
HARQ information to the HARQ entity.
1> else if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion has been received for
this Serving Cell on the PDCCH for the MAC entity\'s CS-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI:
2> if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 1:
3> consider the NDI for the corresponding HARQ process not to have been
toggled;
3> indicate the presence of a downlink assignment for this Serving Cell and
deliver the associated HARQ information to the HARQ entity.
2> if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 0:
3> if PDCCH contents indicate SPS deactivation:
4> clear the configured downlink assignment for this Serving Cell (if any);
4> if the _timeAlignmentTimer_ , associated with the TAG containing the
Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is running:
5> indicate a positive acknowledgement for the SPS deactivation to the
physical layer.
3> else if PDCCH content indicates SPS activation:
4> store the downlink assignment for this Serving Cell and the associated HARQ
information as configured downlink assignment;
4> initialise or re-initialise the configured downlink assignment for this
Serving Cell to start in the associated PDSCH duration and to recur according
to rules in clause 5.8.1 or in clause 5.8.1a;
For each Serving Cell and each configured downlink assignment, if configured
and activated, the MAC entity shall:
1> if the PDSCH duration of the configured downlink assignment does not
overlap with the PDSCH duration of a downlink assignment received on the PDCCH
for this Serving Cell:
2> instruct the physical layer to receive, in this PDSCH duration, transport
block on the DL-SCH according to the configured downlink assignment and to
deliver it to the HARQ entity;
2> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this PDSCH
duration;
2> consider the NDI bit for the corresponding HARQ process to have been
toggled;
2> indicate the presence of a configured downlink assignment and deliver the
stored HARQ information to the HARQ entity.
For configured downlink assignments without _harq-ProcID-Offset_ , the HARQ
Process ID associated with the slot where the DL transmission starts is
derived from the following equation:
HARQ Process ID = [floor (CURRENT_slot Ã— 10 / (_numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã—
_periodicity_))]\ modulo _nrofHARQ-Processes_
where CURRENT_slot = [(SFN Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_) + slot number in the
frame] and _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ refers to the number of consecutive slots
per frame as specified in TS 38.211 [8].
For configured downlink assignments with _harq-ProcID-Offset_ , the HARQ
Process ID associated with the slot where the DL transmission starts is
derived from the following equation:
HARQ Process ID = [floor (CURRENT_slot Ã— 10 / (_numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã—
_periodicity)_)]\ modulo _nrofHARQ-Processes_ \+ _harq-ProcID-Offset_
where CURRENT_slot = [(SFN Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_) + slot number in the
frame] and _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ refers to the number of consecutive slots
per frame as specified in TS 38.211 [8].
NOTE 1: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of
the concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the HARQ Process ID used for
configured downlink assignments.
NOTE 2: CURRENT_slot refers to the slot index of the first transmission
occasion of a bundle of configured downlink assignment.
When the MAC entity needs to read BCCH, the MAC entity may, based on the
scheduling information from RRC:
1> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion has been received on the
PDCCH for the SI-RNTI;
2> indicate a downlink assignment and redundancy version for the dedicated
broadcast HARQ process to the HARQ entity.
When the MAC entity needs to read MCCH, the MAC entity may, based on the
scheduling information from RRC:
1> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion has been received on the
PDCCH for the MCCH-RNTI:
2> indicate a downlink assignment and redundancy version for the selected HARQ
process to the HARQ entity.
When the MAC entity needs to read broadcast MTCH, the MAC entity may, based on
the scheduling information from RRC and DCI:
1> if a downlink assignment for this PDCCH occasion has been received on the
PDCCH for the G-RNTI configured for broadcast MTCH:
2> indicate the presence of a downlink assignment and deliver the associated
HARQ information for the selected HARQ process to the HARQ entity.
### 5.3.2 HARQ operation
#### 5.3.2.1 HARQ Entity
The MAC entity includes a HARQ entity for each Serving Cell, which maintains a
number of parallel HARQ processes. Each HARQ process is associated with a HARQ
process identifier. The HARQ entity directs HARQ information and associated
TBs received on the DL-SCH to the corresponding HARQ processes (see clause
5.3.2.2).
The number of parallel DL HARQ processes per HARQ entity is specified in TS
38.214 [7]. The dedicated broadcast HARQ process is used for BCCH.
The HARQ process supports one TB when the physical layer is not configured for
downlink spatial multiplexing. The HARQ process supports one or two TBs when
the physical layer is configured for downlink spatial multiplexing.
When the MAC entity is configured with _pdsch-AggregationFactor_ > 1, the
parameter _pdsch-AggregationFactor_ provides the number of transmissions of a
TB within a bundle of the downlink assignment. Bundling operation relies on
the HARQ entity for invoking the same HARQ process for each transmission that
is part of the same bundle. After the initial transmission, _pdsch-
AggregationFactor_ \-- 1 HARQ retransmissions follow within a bundle.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if a downlink assignment has been indicated:
2> allocate the TB(s) received from the physical layer and the associated HARQ
information to the HARQ process indicated by the associated HARQ information.
1> if a downlink assignment has been indicated for the broadcast HARQ process:
2> allocate the received TB to the broadcast HARQ process.
NOTE: It is up to UE implementation to allocate the received TB for MCCH or
broadcast MTCH to one HARQ process.
#### 5.3.2.2 HARQ process
When a transmission takes place for the HARQ process, one or two (in case of
downlink spatial multiplexing) TBs and the associated HARQ information are
received from the HARQ entity.
For each received TB and associated HARQ information, the HARQ process shall:
1> if the NDI, when provided, has been toggled compared to the value of the
previous received transmission corresponding to this TB; or
1> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process, and this is the
first received transmission for the TB according to the system information
schedule indicated by RRC; or
1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a
MCCH-RNTI for MBS broadcast, and this is the first received transmission for
the TB according to the MCCH schedule indicated by RRC; or
1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a
G-RNTI for MBS broadcast, and this is the first received transmission for the
TB according to the MTCH schedule indicated by RRC or according to the
scheduling indicated by DCI as specified in TS 38.214 [7]; or
1> if this is the very first received transmission for this TB (i.e. there is
no previous NDI for this TB):
2> consider this transmission to be a new transmission.
1> else:
2> consider this transmission to be a retransmission.
The MAC entity then shall:
1> if this is a new transmission:
2> attempt to decode the received data.
1> else if this is a retransmission:
2> if the data for this TB has not yet been successfully decoded:
3> instruct the physical layer to combine the received data with the data
currently in the soft buffer for this TB and attempt to decode the combined
data.
1> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was successfully
decoded for this TB; or
1> if the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:
2> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process:
3> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.
2> else if this is the first successful decoding of the data for this TB:
3> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing entity.
1> else:
2> instruct the physical layer to replace the data in the soft buffer for this
TB with the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode.
1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a
Temporary C-RNTI and the Contention Resolution is not yet successful (see
clause 5.1.5); or
1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a
MSGB-RNTI and the Random Access procedure is not yet successfully completed
(see clause 5.1.4a); or
1> if the HARQ process is equal to the broadcast process; or
1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a
MCCH-RNTI or a G-RNTI for MBS broadcast; or
1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a
G-RNTI or a G-CS-RNTI or a configured downlink assignment for MBS multicast
and HARQ feedback is disabled for this G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, as specified in
clause 18 of TS 38.213 [6]; or
1> if the HARQ process is associated with a transmission indicated with a
G-RNTI or a G-CS-RNTI or a configured downlink assignment for MBS multicast
and NACK only HARQ feedback is configured for this G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI and the
data for this TB is successfully decoded and the transmission is not the first
transmission of PDSCH where the configured downlink assignment was
(re-)initialised; or
1> if the _timeAlignmentTimer_ , associated with the TAG containing the
Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is stopped or
expired and if the _cg-SDT-TimeAlignmentTimer_ , if configured, is not
running; or
1> if the HARQ process is configured with disabled HARQ feedback:
2> if _harq-FeedbackEnablingforSPSactive_ is configured with value _true_ and
the transmission is the first transmission on the configured downlink
assignment after activation of the configured downlink assignment:
3> instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data in
this TB.
2> else:
3> not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data
in this TB.
1> else:
2> instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data in
this TB.
The MAC entity shall ignore NDI received in all downlink assignments on PDCCH
for its Temporary C-RNTI when determining if NDI on PDCCH for its C-RNTI has
been toggled compared to the value in the previous transmission.
NOTE: If the MAC entity receives a retransmission with a TB size different
from the last TB size signalled for this TB, the UE behavior is left up to UE
implementation.
### 5.3.3 Disassembly and demultiplexing
The MAC entity shall disassemble and demultiplex a MAC PDU as defined in
clauses 6.1.2 and 6.1.5a.
When a MAC entity receives a MAC PDU for MAC entity\'s G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, or
by the configured downlink assignment for MBS multicast containing an LCID or
eLCID which is not configured, the MAC entity shall at least:
1> discard the received subPDU.
## 5.4 UL-SCH data transfer
### 5.4.1 UL Grant reception
Uplink grant is either received dynamically on the PDCCH, in a Random Access
Response, configured semi-persistently by RRC or determined to be associated
with the PUSCH resource of MSGA as specified in clause 5.1.2a. The MAC entity
shall have an uplink grant to transmit on the UL-SCH. To perform the requested
transmissions, the MAC layer receives HARQ information from lower layers. An
uplink grant addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI = 0 is considered as a configured
uplink grant. An uplink grant addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI = 1 is considered
as a dynamic uplink grant.
If the MAC entity has a C-RNTI, a Temporary C-RNTI, or CS-RNTI, the MAC entity
shall for each PDCCH occasion and for each Serving Cell belonging to a TAG
that has a running _timeAlignmentTimer_ or a running _cg-SDT-
TimeAlignmentTimer_ and for each grant received for this PDCCH occasion:
1> if an uplink grant for this Serving Cell has been received on the PDCCH for
the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI or Temporary C-RNTI; or
1> if an uplink grant has been received in a Random Access Response:
2> if the uplink grant is for MAC entity\'s C-RNTI and if the previous uplink
grant delivered to the HARQ entity for the same HARQ process was either an
uplink grant received for the MAC entity\'s CS-RNTI or a configured uplink
grant:
3> consider the NDI to have been toggled for the corresponding HARQ process
regardless of the value of the NDI.
2> if the uplink grant is for MAC entity\'s C-RNTI, and the identified HARQ
process is configured for a configured uplink grant:
3> start or restart the _configuredGrantTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ
process, if configured;
3> stop the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process, if
running.
2> stop the _cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer for the corresponding HARQ process_ ,
if running.
2> deliver the uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ
entity.
1> else if an uplink grant for this PDCCH occasion has been received for this
Serving Cell on the PDCCH for the MAC entity\'s CS-RNTI:
2> if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 1:
3> consider the NDI for the corresponding HARQ process not to have been
toggled;
3> start or restart the _configuredGrantTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ
process, if configured;
3> stop the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process, if
running;
3> stop the _cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process,
if running;
3> deliver the uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to the HARQ
entity;
3> if a logical channel associated with a DRB configured with
_survivalTimeStateSupport_ is multiplexed in the MAC PDU stored in the HARQ
buffer for the corresponding HARQ process:
4> trigger activation of PDCP duplication for all configured RLC entities of
the DRB.
2> else if the NDI in the received HARQ information is 0:
3> if PDCCH contents indicate configured grant Type 2 deactivation:
4> trigger configured uplink grant confirmation.
3> else if PDCCH contents indicate configured grant Type 2 activation:
4> trigger configured uplink grant confirmation;
4> store the uplink grant for this Serving Cell and the associated HARQ
information as configured uplink grant;
4> initialise or re-initialise the configured uplink grant for this Serving
Cell to start in the associated PUSCH duration and to recur according to rules
in clause 5.8.2;
4> stop the _configuredGrantTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process, if
running;
4> stop the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process, if
running.
For each Serving Cell and each configured uplink grant, if configured and
activated, the MAC entity shall:
1> if the MAC entity is configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ , and the
PUSCH duration of the configured uplink grant does not overlap with the PUSCH
duration of an uplink grant received in a Random Access Response or with the
PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to Temporary C-RNTI or the PUSCH
duration of a MSGA payload for this Serving Cell; or
1> if the MAC entity is not configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ , and
the PUSCH duration of the configured uplink grant does not overlap with the
PUSCH duration of an uplink grant received on the PDCCH or in a Random Access
Response or the PUSCH duration of a MSGA payload for this Serving Cell:
2> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this PUSCH
duration;
2> if, for the corresponding HARQ process, the _configuredGrantTimer_ is not
running and _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ is not configured and _cg-SDT-
RetransmissionTimer_ is not configured (i.e. new transmission):
3> if there is an on-going CG-SDT procedure and PDCCH addressed to the MAC
entity\'s C-RNTI has been received; or
3> if there is no on-going CG-SDT procedure:
4> consider the NDI bit for the corresponding HARQ process to have been
toggled;
4> deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to
the HARQ entity.
2> else if the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process is
configured and not running, then for the corresponding HARQ process:
3> if the _configuredGrantTimer_ is not running, and the HARQ process is not
pending (i.e. new transmission):
4> consider the NDI bit to have been toggled;
4> deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to
the HARQ entity.
3> else if the previous uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity for the same
HARQ process was a configured uplink grant (i.e. retransmission on configured
grant):
4> deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to
the HARQ entity.
2> else if the _cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer_ is configured and not running for
the corresponding HARQ process;
3> if the configured uplink grant is for the initial transmission for the CG-
SDT with CCCH message (i.e., initial new transmission); or
3> if the _configuredGrantTimer_ is not running or not configured, and PDCCH
addressed to the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI has been received after the initial
transmission of the CG-SDT with CCCH message (i.e., subsequent new
transmission):
4> consider the NDI bit to have been toggled;
4> deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to
the HARQ entity.
3> else if the previous uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity for the same
HARQ process was a configured uplink grant for initial transmission of CG-SDT
with CCCH message or for its retransmission; and
3> if PDCCH addressed to the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI has not been received (i.e.,
retransmission for initial CG-SDT transmission):
4> consider the NDI bit to have not been toggled;
4> deliver the configured uplink grant and the associated HARQ information to
the HARQ entity.
For configured uplink grants neither configured with _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ nor
with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ , the HARQ Process ID associated with the first
symbol of a UL transmission is derived from the following equation:
HARQ Process ID = [floor(CURRENT_symbol/_periodicity_)] modulo _nrofHARQ-
Processes_
For configured uplink grants with _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ , the HARQ Process ID
associated with the first symbol of a UL transmission is derived from the
following equation:
HARQ Process ID = [floor(CURRENT_symbol / _periodicity_)] modulo _nrofHARQ-
Processes_ \+ _harq-ProcID-Offset2_
where CURRENT_symbol = (SFN Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã—
_numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ \+ slot number in the frame Ã—
_numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ \+ symbol number in the slot), and
_numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ and _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ refer to the number of
consecutive slots per frame and the number of consecutive symbols per slot,
respectively as specified in TS 38.211 [8].
For configured uplink grants configured with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ , the UE
implementation selects an HARQ Process ID among the HARQ process IDs available
for the configured grant configuration. If the MAC entity is configured with
_intraCG-Prioritization_ , for HARQ Process ID selection, the UE shall
prioritize the HARQ Process ID with the highest priority, where the priority
of HARQ process is determined by the highest priority among priorities of the
logical channels that are multiplexed (i.e. the MAC PDU to transmit is already
stored in the HARQ buffer) or have data available that can be multiplexed
(i.e. the MAC PDU to transmit is not stored in the HARQ buffer) in the MAC
PDU, according to the mapping restrictions as described in clause 5.4.3.1.2.
If the MAC entity is configured with _intraCG-Prioritization_ , for HARQ
Process ID selection among initial transmission and retransmission with equal
priority, the UE shall prioritize retransmissions before initial
transmissions. The priority of a HARQ Process for which no data for logical
channels is multiplexed or can be multiplexed in the MAC PDU is lower than the
priority of a HARQ Process for which data for any logical channels is
multiplexed or can be multiplexed in the MAC PDU. If the MAC entity is not
configured with _intraCG-Prioritization_ , for HARQ Process ID selection, the
UE shall prioritize retransmissions before initial transmissions. The UE shall
toggle the NDI in the CG-UCI for new transmissions and not toggle the NDI in
the CG-UCI in retransmissions.
NOTE 1: CURRENT_symbol refers to the symbol index of the first transmission
occasion of a bundle of configured uplink grant.
NOTE 2: A HARQ process is configured for a configured uplink grant where
neither _harq-ProcID-Offset_ nor _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ is configured, if the
configured uplink grant is activated and the associated HARQ process ID is
less than _nrofHARQ-Processes_. A HARQ process is configured for a configured
uplink grant where _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ is configured, if the configured
uplink grant is activated and the associated HARQ process ID is greater than
or equal to _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ and less than sum of _harq-ProcID-Offset2_
and _nrofHARQ-Processes_ for the configured grant configuration.
NOTE 3: If the MAC entity receives a grant in a Random Access Response (i.e.
MAC RAR or fallbackRAR), or addressed to Temporary C-RNTI or determines a
grant as specified in clause 5.1.2a for MSGA payload and if the MAC entity
also receives an overlapping grant for its C-RNTI or CS-RNTI, requiring
concurrent transmissions on the SpCell, the MAC entity may choose to continue
with either the grant for its RA-RNTI/Temporary C-RNTI/MSGB-RNTI/the MSGA
payload transmission or the grant for its C-RNTI or CS-RNTI.
NOTE 4: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of
the concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the HARQ Process ID used for
configured uplink grants.
> NOTE 5: If _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ is not configured, a HARQ process is not
> shared between different configured grant configurations in the same BWP.
For the MAC entity configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ , priority of an
uplink grant is determined by the highest priority among priorities of the
logical channels that are multiplexed (i.e. the MAC PDU to transmit is already
stored in the HARQ buffer) or have data available that can be multiplexed
(i.e. the MAC PDU to transmit is not stored in the HARQ buffer) in the MAC
PDU, according to the mapping restrictions as described in clause 5.4.3.1.2.
The priority of an uplink grant for which no data for logical channels is
multiplexed or can be multiplexed in the MAC PDU is lower than either the
priority of an uplink grant for which data for any logical channels is
multiplexed or can be multiplexed in the MAC PDU or the priority of the
logical channel triggering an SR.
For the MAC entity configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ , if the
corresponding PUSCH transmission of a configured uplink grant is cancelled by
CI-RNTI as specified in clause 11.2A of TS 38.213 [6] or cancelled by a high
PHY-priority PUCCH transmission as specified in clause 9 of TS 38.213 [6],
this configured uplink grant is considered as a de-prioritized uplink grant.
If this de-prioritized uplink grant is configured with _autonomousTx_ , the
_configuredGrantTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process of this de-
prioritized uplink grant shall be stopped if it is running. If this de-
prioritized uplink grant is configured with _autonomousTx_ , the _cg-
RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process of this de-prioritized
uplink grant shall be stopped if it is running.
When the MAC entity is configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ , for each
uplink grant delivered to the HARQ entity and whose associated PUSCH can be
transmitted by lower layers, the MAC entity shall:
1> if this uplink grant is received in a Random Access Response (i.e. in a MAC
RAR or fallback RAR), or addressed to Temporary C-RNTI, or is determined as
specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload:
2> consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant.
1> else if this uplink grant is addressed to CS-RNTI with NDI = 1 or C-RNTI:
2> if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of a configured uplink grant
which was not already de-prioritized, in the same BWP, whose priority is
higher than the priority of the uplink grant; and
2> if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was
not already de-prioritized and the simultaneous transmission of the SR and the
uplink grant is not allowed by configuration of _simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH_ or
_simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup_ or _simultaneousSR-PUSCH-
diffPUCCH-Groups_ , and the priority of the logical channel that triggered the
SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant:
3> consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant;
3> consider the other overlapping uplink grant(s), if any, as a de-prioritized
uplink grant(s);
3> consider the other overlapping SR transmission(s), if any, as a de-
prioritized SR transmission(s), except for the SR transmission(s) whose
simultaneous transmission is allowed by configuration of _simultaneousPUCCH-
PUSCH_ or _simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup_ or _simultaneousSR-
PUSCH-diffPUCCH-Groups_ ;
3> if the de-prioritized uplink grant(s) is a configured uplink grant
configured with _autonomousTx_ whose PUSCH has already started:
4> stop the _configuredGrantTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process of the
de-prioritized uplink grant(s);
4> stop the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process of the
de-prioritized uplink grant(s).
1> else if this uplink grant is a configured uplink grant:
2> if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of another configured uplink
grant which was not already de-prioritized, in the same BWP, whose priority is
higher than the priority of the uplink grant; and
2> if there is no overlapping PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to
CS-RNTI with NDI = 1 or C-RNTI which was not already de-prioritized, in the
same BWP, whose priority is higher than or equal to the priority of the uplink
grant; and
2> if there is no overlapping PUCCH resource with an SR transmission which was
not already de-prioritized and the simultaneous transmission of the SR and the
uplink grant is not allowed by configuration of _simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH_ or
_simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup_ or _simultaneousSR-PUSCH-
diffPUCCH-Groups_ , and the priority of the logical channel that triggered the
SR is higher than the priority of the uplink grant:
3> consider this uplink grant as a prioritized uplink grant;
3> consider the other overlapping uplink grant(s), if any, as a de-prioritized
uplink grant(s);
3> if the de-prioritized uplink grant(s) is a configured uplink grant
configured with _autonomousTx_ whose PUSCH has already started:
4> stop the _configuredGrantTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process of the
de-prioritized uplink grant(s);
4> stop the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process of the
de-prioritized uplink grant(s).
3> consider the other overlapping SR transmission(s), if any, as a de-
prioritized SR transmission(s), except for the SR transmission(s) whose
simultaneous transmission is allowed by configuration of _simultaneousPUCCH-
PUSCH_ or _simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup_ or _simultaneousSR-
PUSCH-diffPUCCH-Groups_.
NOTE 6: If the MAC entity is configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ and if
there is overlapping PUSCH duration of at least two configured uplink grants
whose priorities are equal, the prioritized uplink grant is determined by UE
implementation.
NOTE 7: If the MAC entity is not configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ and
if there is overlapping PUSCH duration of at least two configured uplink
grants, it is up to UE implementation to choose one of the configured uplink
grants.
NOTE 8: If the MAC entity is configured with _lch-basedPrioritization,_ the
MAC entity does not take UCI multiplexing according to the procedure specified
in TS 38.213 [6] into account when determining whether the PUSCH duration of
an uplink grant overlaps with the PUCCH resource for an SR transmission.
### 5.4.2 HARQ operation
#### 5.4.2.1 HARQ Entity
The MAC entity includes a HARQ entity for each Serving Cell with configured
uplink (including the case when it is configured with _supplementaryUplink_),
which maintains a number of parallel HARQ processes.
The number of parallel UL HARQ processes per HARQ entity is specified in TS
38.214 [7].
Each HARQ process supports one TB.
Each HARQ process is associated with a HARQ process identifier. For UL
transmission with UL grant in RA Response or for UL transmission for MSGA
payload, HARQ process identifier 0 is used.
NOTE: When a single DCI is used to schedule multiple PUSCH, the UE is allowed
to map generated TB(s) internally to different HARQ processes in case of LBT
failure(s), i.e. UE may transmit a new TB on any HARQ process in the grants
that have the same TBS, the same RV and the NDIs indicate new transmission.
The maximum number of transmissions of a TB within a bundle of the dynamic
grant or configured grant or the uplink grant received in a MAC RAR is given
by _REPETITION_NUMBER_ as follows:
\- For a dynamic grant, _REPETITION_NUMBER_ is set to a value provided by
lower layers, as specified in clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 38.214 [7];
\- For a configured grant, _REPETITION_NUMBER_ is set to a value provided by
lower layers, as specified in clause 6.1.2.3 of TS 38.214 [7];
\- For an uplink grant received in a MAC RAR, REPETITION_NUMBER is set to a
value provided by lower layers, as specified in clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 38.214
[7].
If _REPETITION_NUMBER_ > 1, after the first transmission within a bundle, at
most _REPETITION_NUMBER_ \-- 1 HARQ retransmissions follow within the bundle.
For both dynamic grant and configured uplink grant, and uplink grant received
in a MAC RAR bundling operation relies on the HARQ entity for invoking the
same HARQ process for each transmission that is part of the same bundle.
Within a bundle, HARQ retransmissions are triggered without waiting for
feedback from previous transmission according to _REPETITION_NUMBER_ for a
dynamic grant or configured uplink grant or uplink grant received in a MAC RAR
unless they are terminated as specified in clause 6.1 of TS 38.214 [7]. Each
transmission within a bundle is a separate uplink grant delivered to the HARQ
entity.
For each transmission within a bundle of the dynamic grant or uplink grant
received in a MAC RAR, the sequence of redundancy versions is determined
according to clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 38.214 [7]. For each transmission within a
bundle of the configured uplink grant, the sequence of redundancy versions is
determined according to clause 6.1.2.3 of TS 38.214 [7].
For each uplink grant, the HARQ entity shall:
1> identify the HARQ process associated with this grant, and for each
identified HARQ process:
2> if the received grant was not addressed to a Temporary C-RNTI on PDCCH, and
the NDI provided in the associated HARQ information has been toggled compared
to the value in the previous transmission of this TB of this HARQ process; or
2> if the uplink grant was received on PDCCH for the C-RNTI and the HARQ
buffer of the identified process is empty; or
2> if the uplink grant was received in a Random Access Response (i.e. in a MAC
RAR or a fallback RAR); or
2> if the uplink grant was determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for the
transmission of the MSGA payload; or
2> if the uplink grant was received on PDCCH for the C-RNTI in _ra-
ResponseWindow_ and this PDCCH successfully completed the Random Access
procedure initiated for beam failure recovery; or
2> if the uplink grant is part of a bundle of the configured uplink grant, and
may be used for initial transmission according to clause 6.1.2.3 of TS 38.214
[7], and if no MAC PDU has been obtained for this bundle:
3> if there is a MAC PDU in the MSGA buffer and the uplink grant determined as
specified in clause 5.1.2a for the transmission of the MSGA payload was
selected; or
3> if there is a MAC PDU in the MSGA buffer and the uplink grant was received
in a fallbackRAR and this fallbackRAR successfully completed the Random Access
procedure:
4> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the MSGA buffer.
3> else if there is a MAC PDU in the Msg3 buffer and the uplink grant was
received in a fallbackRAR:
4> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Msg3 buffer.
3> else if there is a MAC PDU in the Msg3 buffer and the uplink grant was
received in a MAC RAR; or
3> if there is a MAC PDU in the Msg3 buffer and the uplink grant was received
on PDCCH for the C-RNTI in _ra-ResponseWindow_ and this PDCCH successfully
completed the Random Access procedure initiated for beam failure recovery:
4> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Msg3 buffer.
4> if the uplink grant size does not match with size of the obtained MAC PDU;
and
4> if the Random Access procedure was successfully completed upon receiving
the uplink grant:
5> indicate to the Multiplexing and assembly entity to include MAC subPDU(s)
carrying MAC SDU from the obtained MAC PDU in the subsequent uplink
transmission;
5> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Multiplexing and assembly entity.
3> else if this uplink grant is a configured grant configured with
_autonomousTx_ ; and
3> if the previous configured uplink grant, in the BWP, for this HARQ process
was not prioritized; and
3> if a MAC PDU had already been obtained for this HARQ process; and
3> if the uplink grant size matches with size of the obtained MAC PDU; and
3> if none of PUSCH transmission(s) of the obtained MAC PDU has been
completely performed:
4> consider the MAC PDU has been obtained.
3> else if the MAC entity is not configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ ;
or
3> if this uplink grant is a prioritized uplink grant:
4> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Multiplexing and assembly entity,

corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed if LBT failure
indication is not received from lower layers.

indication is not received from lower layers.
5> if _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ is configured for the identified HARQ process;
and

from lower layers:
6> consider the identified HARQ process as pending.
3> else:
4> flush the HARQ buffer of the identified HARQ process.
2> else (i.e. retransmission):
3> if the uplink grant received on PDCCH was addressed to CS-RNTI and if the
HARQ buffer of the identified process is empty; or
3> if the uplink grant is part of a bundle and if no MAC PDU has been obtained
for this bundle; or
3> if the uplink grant is part of a bundle of the configured uplink grant, and
the PUSCH duration of the uplink grant overlaps with an uplink grant received
in a Random Access Response (i.e. MAC RAR or fallbackRAR) or an uplink grant
determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a for MSGA payload for this Serving
Cell; or
3> if the MAC entity is not configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ and this
uplink grant is part of a bundle of the configured uplink grant, and the PUSCH

3> if the MAC entity is configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ and this
uplink grant is not a prioritized uplink grant:
4> ignore the uplink grant.
3> else:
4> deliver the uplink grant and the HARQ information (redundancy version) of
the TB to the identified HARQ process;
4> instruct the identified HARQ process to trigger a retransmission;
4> if the uplink grant is addressed to CS-RNTI; or
4> if the uplink grant is addressed to C-RNTI, and the identified HARQ process
is configured for a configured uplink grant:
5> start or restart the _configuredGrantTimer_ , if configured, for the
corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed if LBT failure
indication is not received from lower layers.
4> if the uplink grant is a configured uplink grant:
5> if the identified HARQ process is pending:
6> start or restart the _configuredGrantTimer, if configured,_ for the
corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed if LBT failure
indication is not received from lower layers;
5> start or restart the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ , if configured, for the
corresponding HARQ process when the transmission is performed if LBT failure
indication is not received from lower layers.
5> if the configured uplink grant is for the retransmission of the initial
transmission of the CG-SDT with CCCH message:
6> start or restart the _cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding
HARQ process when transmission is performed.
4> if the identified HARQ process is pending and the transmission is performed
and LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers:
5> consider the identified HARQ process as not pending.
When determining if NDI has been toggled compared to the value in the previous
transmission the MAC entity shall ignore NDI received in all uplink grants on
PDCCH for its Temporary C-RNTI.
When _configuredGrantTimer_ or _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ or _cg-SDT-
RetransmissionTimer_ is started or restarted by a PUSCH transmission, it shall
be started at the beginning of the first symbol of the PUSCH transmission.
#### 5.4.2.2 HARQ process
Each HARQ process is associated with a HARQ buffer.
New transmissions are performed on the resource and with the MCS indicated on
PDCCH or indicated in the Random Access Response (i.e. MAC RAR or
fallbackRAR), or signalled in RRC or determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a
for MSGA payload. Retransmissions are performed on the resource and, if
provided, with the MCS indicated on PDCCH, or on the same resource and with
the same MCS as was used for last made transmission attempt within a bundle,
or on stored configured uplink grant resources and stored MCS when _cg-
RetransmissionTimer_ or _cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer_ is configured. If _cg-
RetransmissionTimer_ is configured, retransmissions with the same HARQ process
may be performed on any configured grant configuration if the configured grant
configurations have the same TBS. If _cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer_ is
configured, retransmission for the initial CG-SDT transmission with the same
HARQ process may be performed on any configured grant configuration if the
configured grant configurations have the same TBS.
When _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ is configured and the HARQ entity obtains a MAC
PDU to transmit and LBT failure indication is received from lower layer, the
corresponding HARQ process is considered to be pending. For a configured
uplink grant, configured with _cg-RetransmissionTimer,_ each associated HARQ
process is considered as not pending when:
\- a transmission is performed on that HARQ process and LBT failure indication
is not received from lower layers; or
\- the configured uplink grant is initialised and this HARQ process is not
associated with another active configured uplink grant; or
\- the HARQ buffer for this HARQ process is flushed.
If the HARQ entity requests a new transmission for a TB, the HARQ process
shall:
1> store the MAC PDU in the associated HARQ buffer;
1> store the uplink grant received from the HARQ entity;
1> generate a transmission as described below.
If the HARQ entity requests a retransmission for a TB, the HARQ process shall:
1> store the uplink grant received from the HARQ entity;
1> generate a transmission as described below.
To generate a transmission for a TB, the HARQ process shall:
1> if the MAC PDU was obtained from the Msg3 buffer; or
1> if the MAC PDU was obtained from the MSGA buffer; or
1> if there is no measurement gap at the time of the transmission and, in case
of retransmission, the retransmission does not collide with a transmission for
a MAC PDU obtained from the Msg3 buffer or the MSGA buffer:
2> if there are neither NR sidelink transmission nor transmission of V2X
sidelink communication at the time of the transmission; or
2> if the transmission of the MAC PDU is prioritized over sidelink
transmission or can be simultaneously performed with sidelink transmission:
3> instruct the physical layer to generate a transmission according to the
stored uplink grant.
If a HARQ process receives downlink feedback information, the HARQ process
shall:
1> stop the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ , if running;
1> if acknowledgement is indicated:
2> stop the _configuredGrantTimer_ , if running.
If the _configuredGrantTimer_ expires for a HARQ process, the HARQ process
shall:
1> stop the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ , if running;
1> stop the _cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer_ , if running.
1> if a PDCCH addressed to the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI has not been received
after initial transmission for the CG-SDT with CCCH message to which the
_configuredGrantTimer_ corresponds:
2> indicate failure to perform SDT procedure to the upper layer.
The transmission of the MAC PDU is prioritized over sidelink transmission or
can be performed simultaneously with sidelink transmission if one of the
following conditions is met:
\- if there are both a sidelink grant for NR sidelink transmissionand
configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH
as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] at the time of the
transmission, and neither the NR sidelink transmission is prioritized as
determined in clause 5.22.1.3.1a nor the transmission(s) of V2X sidelink
communication is prioritized as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321
[22]; or
\- if there are both a sidelink grant NR sidelink transmission and configured
grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH as
determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] at the time of the
transmission, and the MAC entity is able to perform this UL transmission
simultaneously with the NR sidelink transmission and/or the transmission(s) of
V2X sidelink communication; or
\- if there is only configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink
communication on SL-SCH as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22]
at the time of the transmission, and either none of the transmission(s) of V2X
sidelink communication is prioritized as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS
36.321 [22] or the MAC entity is able to perform this UL transmission
simultaneously with the transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication; or
\- if there is only a sidelink grant for NR sidelink transmission at the time
of the transmission, and if the NR sidelink transmission is not prioritized as
determined in clause 5.22.1.3.1a, or there is a sidelink grant for NR sidelink
transmission at the time of the transmission and the MAC entity is able to
perform this UL transmission simultaneously with the NR sidelink transmission;
or
\- if there are both a sidelink grant for NR sidelink transmission and
configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink communication on SL-SCH
as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22] at the time of the
transmission, and either only the of NR sidelink transmission is prioritized
as determined in clause 5.22.1.3.1a or only the transmission(s) of V2X
sidelink communication is prioritized as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS
36.321 [22] and the MAC entity is able to perform this UL transmission
simultaneously with the prioritized NR sidelink transmission or the
transmission of V2X sidelink communication:
NOTE 1: Among the UL transmissions where the MAC entity is able to perform the
transmission of NR sidelink communication prioritized simultaneously, if there
are more than one UL transmission which the MAC entity is not able to perform
simultaneously, it is up to UE implementation whether this UL transmission is
performed.
NOTE 2: Among the UL transmissions that the MAC entity is able to perform
simultaneously with all transmission(s) of V2X sidelink communication
prioritized, if there are more than one UL transmission which the MAC entity
is not able to perform simultaneously, it is up to UE implementation whether
this UL transmission is performed.
NOTE 3: Among the UL transmissions where the MAC entity is able to perform the
NR sidelink transmission prioritized simultaneously with all transmission(s)
of V2X sidelink communication prioritized, if there are more than one UL
transmission which the MAC entity is not able to perform simultaneously, it is
up to UE implementation whether this UL transmission is performed.
NOTE 4: If there is configured grant(s) for transmission of V2X sidelink
communication on SL-SCH as determined in clause 5.14.1.2.2 of TS 36.321 [22]
at the time of the transmission, and the MAC entity is not able to perform
this UL transmission simultaneously with the transmission(s) of V2X sidelink
communication, and prioritization-related information is not available prior
to the time of the transmission due to processing time restriction, it is up
to UE implementation whether this UL transmission is performed.
### 5.4.3 Multiplexing and assembly
#### 5.4.3.1 Logical Channel Prioritization
##### 5.4.3.1.1 General
The Logical Channel Prioritization (LCP) procedure is applied whenever a new
transmission is performed.
RRC controls the scheduling of uplink data by signalling for each logical
channel per MAC entity:
\- _priority_ where an increasing priority value indicates a lower priority
level;
\- _prioritisedBitRate_ which sets the Prioritized Bit Rate (PBR);
\- _bucketSizeDuration_ which sets the Bucket Size Duration (BSD).
RRC additionally controls the LCP procedure by configuring mapping
restrictions for each logical channel:
\- _allowedSCS-List_ which sets the allowed Subcarrier Spacing(s) for
transmission;
\- _maxPUSCH-Duration_ which sets the maximum PUSCH duration allowed for
transmission;
\- _configuredGrantType1Allowed_ which sets whether a configured grant Type 1
can be used for transmission;
\- _allowedServingCells_ which sets the allowed cell(s) for transmission;
\- _allowedCG-List_ which sets the allowed configured grant(s) for
transmission;
\- _allowedPHY-PriorityIndex_ which sets the allowed PHY priority index(es) of
a dynamic grant for transmission;
\- _allowedHARQ-mode_ which sets the allowed UL HARQ mode for transmission.
The following UE variable is used for the Logical channel prioritization
procedure:
\- _Bj_ which is maintained for each logical channel _j_.
The MAC entity shall initialize _Bj_ of the logical channel to zero when the
logical channel is established.
For each logical channel _j_ , the MAC entity shall:
1> increment _Bj_ by the product PBR Ã— T before every instance of the LCP
procedure, where T is the time elapsed since _Bj_ was last incremented;
1> if the value of _Bj_ is greater than the bucket size (i.e. PBR Ã— BSD):
2> set _Bj_ to the bucket size.
NOTE: The exact moment(s) when the UE updates _Bj_ between LCP procedures is
up to UE implementation, as long as _Bj_ is up to date at the time when a
grant is processed by LCP.
##### 5.4.3.1.2 Selection of logical channels
The MAC entity shall, when a new transmission is performed:
1> select the logical channels for each UL grant that satisfy all the
following conditions:
2> the set of allowed Subcarrier Spacing index values in _allowedSCS-List_ ,
if configured, includes the Subcarrier Spacing index associated to the UL
grant; and
2> _maxPUSCH-Duration_ , if configured, is larger than or equal to the PUSCH
transmission duration associated to the UL grant; and
2> _configuredGrantType1Allowed_ , if configured, is set to _true_ in case the
UL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and
2> _allowedServingCells_ , if configured, includes the Cell information
associated to the UL grant. Does not apply to logical channels associated with
a DRB configured with PDCP duplication within the same MAC entity (i.e. CA
duplication) when CA duplication is deactivated for this DRB in this MAC
entity; and
2> _allowedCG-List_ , if configured, includes the configured grant index
associated to the UL grant; and
2> _allowedPHY-PriorityIndex_ , if configured, includes the priority index (as
specified in clause 9 of TS 38.213 [6]) associated to the dynamic UL grant;
and
2> _allowedHARQ-mode_ , if configured, includes the allowed UL HARQ mode for
the HARQ process associated to the UL grant.
NOTE: The Subcarrier Spacing index, PUSCH transmission duration, Cell
information, and priority index are included in Uplink transmission
information received from lower layers for the corresponding scheduled uplink
transmission.
##### 5.4.3.1.3 Allocation of resources
Before the successful completion of the Random Access procedure initiated for
DAPS handover, the target MAC entity shall not select the logical channel(s)
corresponding to non-DAPS DRB(s) for the uplink grant received in a Random
Access Response or the uplink grant for the transmission of the MSGA payload.
The source MAC entity shall select only the logical channel(s) corresponding
to DAPS DRB(s) during DAPS handover.
The MAC entity shall, when a new transmission is performed:
1> allocate resources to the logical channels as follows:
2> logical channels selected in clause 5.4.3.1.2 for the UL grant with _Bj_ >
0 are allocated resources in a decreasing priority order. If the PBR of a
logical channel is set to _infinity_ , the MAC entity shall allocate resources
for all the data that is available for transmission on the logical channel
before meeting the PBR of the lower priority logical channel(s);
2> decrement _Bj_ by the total size of MAC SDUs served to logical channel _j_
above;
2> if any resources remain, all the logical channels selected in clause
5.4.3.1.2 are served in a strict decreasing priority order (regardless of the
value of _Bj_) until either the data for that logical channel or the UL grant
is exhausted, whichever comes first. Logical channels configured with equal
priority should be served equally.
NOTE 1: The value of _Bj_ can be negative.
If the MAC entity is requested to simultaneously transmit multiple MAC PDUs,
or if the MAC entity receives the multiple UL grants within one or more
coinciding PDCCH occasions (i.e. on different Serving Cells), it is up to UE
implementation in which order the grants are processed.
The UE shall also follow the rules below during the scheduling procedures
above:
\- the UE should not segment an RLC SDU (or partially transmitted SDU or
retransmitted RLC PDU) if the whole SDU (or partially transmitted SDU or
retransmitted RLC PDU) fits into the remaining resources of the associated MAC
entity;
\- if the UE segments an RLC SDU from the logical channel, it shall maximize
the size of the segment to fill the grant of the associated MAC entity as much
as possible;
\- the UE should maximise the transmission of data;
\- if the MAC entity is given a UL grant size that is equal to or larger than
8 bytes (when eLCID is not used) or 10 bytes (when eLCID is used) while having
data available and allowed (according to clause 5.4.3.1) for transmission, the
MAC entity shall not transmit only padding BSR and/or padding.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if the MAC entity is configured with _enhancedSkipUplinkTxDynamic_ with
value _true_ and the grant indicated to the HARQ entity was addressed to a
C-RNTI, or if the MAC entity is configured with
_enhancedSkipUplinkTxConfigured_ with value _true_ and the grant indicated to
the HARQ entity is a configured uplink grant:
2> if there is no UCI to be multiplexed on this PUSCH transmission as
specified in TS 38.213 [6]; and
2> if there is no aperiodic CSI requested for this PUSCH transmission as
specified in TS 38.212 [9]; and
2> if the MAC PDU includes zero MAC SDUs; and
2> if the MAC PDU includes only the periodic BSR and there is no data
available for any LCG, or the MAC PDU includes only the padding BSR:
3> not generate a MAC PDU for the HARQ entity.
1> else if the MAC entity is configured with _skipUplinkTxDynamic_ with value
_true_ and the grant indicated to the HARQ entity was addressed to a C-RNTI,
or the grant indicated to the HARQ entity is a configured uplink grant:
2> if there is no aperiodic CSI requested for this PUSCH transmission as
specified in TS 38.212 [9]; and
2> if the MAC PDU includes zero MAC SDUs; and
2> if the MAC PDU includes only the periodic BSR and there is no data
available for any LCG, or the MAC PDU includes only the padding BSR:
3> not generate a MAC PDU for the HARQ entity.
Logical channels shall be prioritised in accordance with the following order
(highest priority listed first):
\- MAC CE for C-RNTI, or data from UL-CCCH;
\- MAC CE for (Enhanced) BFR, or MAC CE for Configured Grant Confirmation, or
MAC CE for Multiple Entry Configured Grant Confirmation;
\- MAC CE for Sidelink Configured Grant Confirmation;
\- MAC CE for LBT failure;
\- MAC CE for Timing Advance Report;
\- MAC CE for SL-BSR prioritized according to clause 5.22.1.6;
\- MAC CE for (Extended) BSR, with exception of BSR included for padding;
\- MAC CE for (Enhanced) Single Entry PHR, or MAC CE for (Enhanced) Multiple
Entry PHR;
\- MAC CE for Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request;
\- MAC CE for the number of Desired Guard Symbols;
\- MAC CE for Case-6 Timing Request;
\- MAC CE for (Extended) Pre-emptive BSR;
\- MAC CE for SL-BSR, with exception of SL-BSR prioritized according to clause
5.22.1.6 and SL-BSR included for padding;
\- MAC CE for IAB-MT Recommended Beam Indication, or MAC CE for Desired IAB-MT
PSD range, or MAC CE for Desired DL Tx Power Adjustment;
\- data from any Logical Channel, except data from UL-CCCH;
\- MAC CE for Recommended bit rate query;
\- MAC CE for BSR included for padding;
\- MAC CE for SL-BSR included for padding.
NOTE 2: Prioritization among MAC CEs of same priority is up to UE
implementation.
The MAC entity shall prioritize any MAC CE listed in a higher order than
\'data from any Logical Channel, except data from UL-CCCH\' over NR sidelink
transmission.
#### 5.4.3.2 Multiplexing of MAC Control Elements and MAC SDUs
The MAC entity shall multiplex MAC CEs and MAC SDUs in a MAC PDU according to
clauses 5.4.3.1 and 6.1.2.
NOTE: Content of a MAC PDU does not change after being built for transmission
on a dynamic uplink grant, regardless of LBT outcome.
### 5.4.4 Scheduling Request
The Scheduling Request (SR) is used for requesting UL-SCH resources for new
transmission.
The MAC entity may be configured with zero, one, or more SR configurations. An
SR configuration consists of a set of PUCCH resources for SR across different
BWPs and cells. For a logical channel or for SCell beam failure recovery (see
clause 5.17) and for consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause 5.21), at
most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per BWP. For a logical channel
serving a radio bearer configured with SDT, PUCCH resource for SR is not
configured for SDT. For beam failure recovery of BFD-RS set(s) of Serving
Cell, up to two PUCCH resources for SR is configured per BWP. For positioning
measurement gap activation/deactivation request, a dedicated SR configuration
is configured.
Each SR configuration corresponds to one or more logical channels and/or to
SCell beam failure recovery and/or to consistent LBT failure recovery and/or
to beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set and/or to positioning measurement gap
activation/deactivation request. Each logical channel, SCell beam failure
recovery, beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set and consistent LBT failure
recovery, may be mapped to zero or one SR configuration, which is configured
by RRC. The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered a BSR
(clause 5.4.5) or the SCell beam failure recovery or the beam failure recovery
of a BFD-RS set or the consistent LBT failure recovery (clause 5.21) (if such
a configuration exists) or positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation
request (clause 5.25) is considered as corresponding SR configuration for the
triggered SR. Any SR configuration may be used for an SR triggered by Pre-
emptive BSR (clause 5.4.7) or Timing Advance reporting (clause 5.4.8).
RRC configures the following parameters for the scheduling request procedure:
\- _sr-ProhibitTimer_ (per SR configuration);
\- _sr-TransMax_ (per SR configuration).
The following UE variables are used for the scheduling request procedure:
\- _SR_COUNTER_ (per SR configuration).
If an SR is triggered and there are no other SRs pending corresponding to the
same SR configuration, the MAC entity shall set the _SR_COUNTER_ of the
corresponding SR configuration to 0.
When an SR is triggered, it shall be considered as pending until it is
cancelled.
All pending SR(s) for BSR triggered according to the BSR procedure (clause
5.4.5) prior to the MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled and each respective
_sr-ProhibitTimer_ shall be stopped when the MAC PDU is transmitted and this
PDU includes a Long or Short BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to
(and including) the last event that triggered a BSR (see clause 5.4.5) prior
to the MAC PDU assembly. All pending SR(s) for BSR triggered according to the
BSR procedure (clause 5.4.5) shall be cancelled and each respective _sr-
ProhibitTimer_ shall be stopped when the UL grant(s) can accommodate all
pending data available for transmission.
The MAC entity shall for each pending SR not triggered according to the BSR
procedure (clause 5.4.5) for a Serving Cell:
1> if this SR was triggered by Pre-emptive BSR procedure (see clause 5.4.7)
prior to the MAC PDU assembly and a MAC PDU containing the relevant Pre-
emptive BSR MAC CE is transmitted; or
1> if this SR was triggered by beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) of an
SCell and a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU includes a MAC CE for BFR
which contains beam failure recovery information for this SCell; or
1> if this SR was triggered by beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) for a
BFD-RS set of a Serving Cell and a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU
includes an Enhanced BFR MAC CE or a Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE which
contains beam failure recovery information for this BFD-RS set of the Serving
Cell; or
1> if this SR was triggered by beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) of an
SCell and this SCell is deactivated (see clause 5.9); or
1> if this SR was triggered by beam failure recovery (see clause 5.17) for a
BFD-RS set of an SCell and this SCell is deactivated (see clause 5.9); or
1> if the SR is triggered by positioning measurement gap
activation/deactivation request (see clause 5.25) and the Positioning
Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request MAC CE that triggers the SR
has already been cancelled; or
1> if this SR was triggered by consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause
5.21) of an SCell and a MAC PDU is transmitted and the MAC PDU includes an LBT
failure MAC CE that indicates consistent LBT failure for this SCell; or
1> if this SR was triggered by consistent LBT failure recovery (see clause
5.21) of an SCell and all the triggered consistent LBT failure(s) for this
SCell are cancelled; or
1> if this SR was triggered by Timing Advance reporting (see clause 5.4.8) and
all the triggered Timing Advance reports are cancelled:
2> cancel the pending SR and stop the corresponding _sr-ProhibitTimer, if
running_.
Only PUCCH resources on a BWP which is active at the time of SR transmission
occasion are considered valid.
As long as at least one SR is pending, the MAC entity shall for each pending
SR:
1> if the MAC entity has no valid PUCCH resource configured for the pending
SR:
2> initiate a Random Access procedure (see clause 5.1) on the SpCell and
cancel the pending SR.
1> else, for the SR configuration corresponding to the pending SR:
2> when the MAC entity has an SR transmission occasion on the valid PUCCH
resource for SR configured; and
2> if _sr-ProhibitTimer_ is not running at the time of the SR transmission
occasion; and
2> if the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion does not overlap
with a measurement gap:
3> if the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion overlaps with
neither a UL-SCH resource whose simultaneous transmission with the SR is not
allowed by configuration of _simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH_ or _simultaneousPUCCH-
PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup_ or _simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCH-Groups_ nor an
SL-SCH resource; or
3> if the MAC entity is able to perform this SR transmission simultaneously
with the transmission of the SL-SCH resource; or
3> if the MAC entity is configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ , and the
PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion does not overlap with the
PUSCH duration of an uplink grant received in a Random Access Response or with
the PUSCH duration of an uplink grant addressed to Temporary C-RNTI or with
the PUSCH duration of a MSGA payload, and the PUCCH resource for the SR
transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause
5.4.5 overlaps with any other UL-SCH resource(s), and the physical layer can
signal the SR on one valid PUCCH resource for SR, and the priority of the
logical channel that triggered SR is higher than the priority of the uplink
grant(s) for any UL-SCH resource(s) where the uplink grant was not already de-
prioritized and its simultaneous transmission with the SR is not allowed by
configuration of _simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH_ or _simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-
SecondaryPUCCHgroup_ or _simultaneousSR-PUSCH-diffPUCCHgroups_ , and the
priority of the uplink grant is determined as specified in clause 5.4.1; or
3> if both _sl-PrioritizationThres_ and _ul-PrioritizationThres_ are
configured and the PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion for the
pending SR triggered as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 overlaps with any UL-SCH
resource(s) carrying a MAC PDU, and the value of the priority of the triggered
SR determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 is lower than _sl-
PrioritizationThres_ and the value of the highest priority of the logical
channel(s) in the MAC PDU is higher than or equal to _ul-PrioritizationThres_
and any MAC CE prioritized as described in clause 5.4.3.1.3 is not included in
the MAC PDU and the MAC PDU is not prioritized by upper layer according to TS
23.287 [19]; or
3> if an SL-SCH resource overlaps with the PUCCH resource for the SR
transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause
5.4.5, and the MAC entity is not able to perform this SR transmission
simultaneously with the transmission of the SL-SCH resource, and either
transmission on the SL-SCH resource is not prioritized as described in clause
5.22.1.3.1a or the priority value of the logical channel that triggered SR is
lower than _ul-PrioritizationThres_ , if configured; or
3> if an SL-SCH resource overlaps with the PUCCH resource for the SR
transmission occasion for the pending SR triggered as specified in clause
5.22.1.5, and the MAC entity is not able to perform this SR transmission
simultaneously with the transmission of the SL-SCH resource, and the priority
of the triggered SR determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.5 is higher than
the priority of the MAC PDU determined as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.1a for
the SL-SCH resource:
4> consider the SR transmission as a prioritized SR transmission.
4> consider the other overlapping uplink grant(s), if any, as a de-prioritized
uplink grant(s), except for the overlapping uplink grant(s) whose simultaneous
transmission is allowed by configuration of _simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH_ or
_simultaneousPUCCH-PUSCH-SecondaryPUCCHgroup_ or _simultaneousSR-PUSCH-
diffPUCCH-Groups_ ;
4> if the de-prioritized uplink grant(s) is a configured uplink grant
configured with _autonomousTx_ whose PUSCH has already started:
5> stop the _configuredGrantTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process of the
de-prioritized uplink grant(s);
5> stop the _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ for the corresponding HARQ process of the
de-prioritized uplink grant(s).
4> if _SR_COUNTER_ \ instruct the physical layer to signal the SR on one valid PUCCH resource
for SR;
5> if LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers:
6> increment _SR_COUNTER_ by 1;
6> start the _sr-ProhibitTimer_.
5> else if _lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig_ is not configured:
6> increment _SR_COUNTER_ by 1.
4> else:
5> notify RRC to release PUCCH for all Serving Cells;
5> notify RRC to release SRS for all Serving Cells;
5> clear any configured downlink assignments and uplink grants;
5> clear any PUSCH resources for semi-persistent CSI reporting;
5> initiate a Random Access procedure (see clause 5.1) on the SpCell and
cancel all pending SRs.
3> else:
4> consider the SR transmission as a de-prioritized SR transmission.
NOTE 1: Except for SR for SCell beam failure recovery, the selection of which
valid PUCCH resource for SR to signal SR on when the MAC entity has more than
one overlapping valid PUCCH resource for the SR transmission occasion is left
to UE implementation.
NOTE 2: If more than one individual SR triggers an instruction from the MAC
entity to the PHY layer to signal the SR on the same valid PUCCH resource, the
_SR_COUNTER_ for the relevant SR configuration is incremented only once.
NOTE 3: When the MAC entity has pending SR for SCell beam failure recovery and
the MAC entity has one or more PUCCH resources (other than PUCCH resources of
pending SR for beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set) overlapping with PUCCH
resource for SCell beam failure recovery for the SR transmission occasion, the
MAC entity considers only the PUCCH resource for SCell beam failure recovery
as valid. When the MAC entity has pending SR for beam failure recovery of a
BFD-RS set of Serving Cell and the MAC entity has one or more PUCCH resources
(other than PUCCH resources of pending SR for beam failure recovery)
overlapping with PUCCH resource for beam failure recovery of that BFD-RS set
for the SR transmission occasion, the MAC entity considers only the PUCCH
resource for beam failure recovery of that BFD-RS set as valid.
NOTE 4: For a UE operating in a semi-static channel access mode as described
in TS 37.213 [18], PUCCH resources overlapping with the set of consecutive
symbols where the UE does not transmit before the start of a next channel
occupancy time are not considered valid.
NOTE 5: If the MAC entity is configured with _lch-basedPrioritization_ , the
MAC entity does not take UCI multiplexing according to the procedure specified
in TS 38.213 [6] into account when determining whether the valid PUCCH
resource for the SR transmission can be signalled by the physical layer and
the SR transmission occasion overlaps with the PUSCH duration of an uplink
grant of a MSGA payload.
NOTE 6: When the MAC entity has PUCCH resource for pending SR for SCell beam
failure recovery overlapping with PUCCH resource for pending SR for beam
failure recovery of a BFD-RS set for the SR transmission occasion, it\'s up to
UE implementation to select PUCCH resource for SCell beam failure recovery or
PUCCH resource for beam failure recovery of a BFD-RS set.
The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a
pending SR for BSR, which was initiated by the MAC entity prior to the MAC PDU
assembly and which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
\- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by
Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a
for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes a BSR MAC CE
which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that
triggered a BSR (see clause 5.4.5) prior to the MAC PDU assembly; or
\- the UL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for
transmission.
The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a
pending SR for SL-BSR and/or SL-CSI reporting and/or SL-DRX command
indication, which was initiated by the MAC entity prior to the sidelink MAC
PDU assembly and which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
\- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by
Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a
for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes an SL-BSR MAC
CE which contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that
triggered an SL-BSR (see clause 5.22.1.6) prior to the MAC PDU assembly; or
\- the SL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available and/or SL-CSI
reporting MAC CE and/or SL-DRX command indication for transmission.
The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a
pending SR for BFR of an SCell, which has no valid PUCCH resources configured,
if:
\- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by
Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a
for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU contains a MAC CE for
BFR which includes beam failure recovery information of that SCell; or
\- the SCell is deactivated (as specified in clause 5.9) and all triggered
BFRs for SCells are cancelled.
The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a
pending SR for BFR of a BFD-RS set of a Serving Cell, which has no valid PUCCH
resources configured, if:
\- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by
Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a
for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU contains an Enhanced
BFR MAC CE or a Truncated Enhanced BFR MAC CE which includes beam failure
recovery information of that BFD-RS set of the Serving Cell.
The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a
pending SR for consistent LBT failure recovery, which has no valid PUCCH
resources configured, if:
\- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by
Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a
for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes an LBT failure
MAC CE that indicates consistent LBT failure for all the SCells that triggered
consistent LBT failure; or
\- all the SCells that triggered consistent LBT failure recovery are
deactivated (see clause 5.9).
The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a
pending SR for positioning measurement gap activation/deactivation request,
which has no valid PUCCH resources configured, if:
\- the Positioning Measurement Gap Activation/Deactivation Request MAC CE that
triggers the SR corresponding to the Random Access procedure has already been
cancelled.
The MAC entity may stop, if any, ongoing Random Access procedure due to a
pending SR for Timing Advance report, which has no valid PUCCH resources
configured, if:
\- a MAC PDU is transmitted using a UL grant other than a UL grant provided by
Random Access Response or a UL grant determined as specified in clause 5.1.2a
for the transmission of the MSGA payload, and this PDU includes a Timing
Advance Report MAC CE (see clause 5.4.8).
### 5.4.5 Buffer Status Reporting
The Buffer Status reporting (BSR) procedure is used to provide the serving gNB
with information about UL data volume in the MAC entity.
RRC configures the following parameters to control the BSR:
\- _periodicBSR-Timer_ ;
\- _retxBSR-Timer_ ;
\- _logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied_ ;
\- _logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_ ;
\- _logicalChannelSR-Mask_ ;
\- _logicalChannelGroup, logicalChannelGroupIAB-Ext_ ;
\- _sdt-LogicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_.
Each logical channel may be allocated to an LCG using the
_logicalChannelGroup_. The maximum number of LCGs is eight except for IAB-MTs
configured with _logicalChannelGroupIAB-Ext_ , for which the maximum number of
LCGs is 256.
The MAC entity determines the amount of UL data available for a logical
channel according to the data volume calculation procedure in TSs 38.322 [3]
and 38.323 [4].
A BSR shall be triggered if any of the following events occur for activated
cell group:
\- UL data, for a logical channel which belongs to an LCG, becomes available
to the MAC entity; and either
\- this UL data belongs to a logical channel with higher priority than the
priority of any logical channel containing available UL data which belong to
any LCG; or
\- none of the logical channels which belong to an LCG contains any available
UL data.
in which case the BSR is referred below to as \'Regular BSR\';
\- UL resources are allocated and number of padding bits is equal to or larger
than the size of the Buffer Status Report MAC CE plus its subheader, in which
case the BSR is referred below to as \'Padding BSR\';
\- _retxBSR-Timer_ expires, and at least one of the logical channels which
belong to an LCG contains UL data, in which case the BSR is referred below to
as \'Regular BSR\';
\- _periodicBSR-Timer_ expires, in which case the BSR is referred below to as
\'Periodic BSR\'.
NOTE 1: When Regular BSR triggering events occur for multiple logical channels
simultaneously, each logical channel triggers one separate Regular BSR.
For Regular BSR, the MAC entity shall:
1> if the BSR is triggered for a logical channel for which _logicalChannelSR-
DelayTimerApplied_ with value _true_ is configured by upper layers and SDT
procedure is not on-going according to clause 5.27:
2> start or restart the _logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_.
1> else if BSR is triggered for a logical channel for which _logicalChannelSR-
DelayTimerApplied_ with value _true_ is configured by upper layers and SDT
procedure is on-going according to clause 5.27:
2> start or restart _logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_ with the value as configured
by the _sdt-LogicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_.
1> else:
2> if running, stop the _logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_.
For Regular and Periodic BSR, the MAC entity for which
_logicalChannelGroupIAB-Ext_ is not configured by upper layers shall:
1> if more than one LCG has data available for transmission when the MAC PDU
containing the BSR is to be built:
2> report Long BSR for all LCGs which have data available for transmission.
1> else:
2> report Short BSR.
For Regular and Periodic BSR, the MAC entity for which
_logicalChannelGroupIAB-Ext_ is configured by upper layers shall:
1> if more than one LCG has data available for transmission when the MAC PDU
containing the BSR is to be built:
2> if the maximum LCG ID among the configured LCGs is 7 or lower:
3> report Long BSR for all LCGs which have data available for transmission.
2> else:
3> report Extended Long BSR for all LCGs which have data available for
transmission.
1> else:
2> report Extended Short BSR.
For Padding BSR, the MAC entity for which _logicalChannelGroupIAB-Ext_ is not
configured by upper layers shall:
1> if the number of padding bits is equal to or larger than the size of the
Short BSR plus its subheader but smaller than the size of the Long BSR plus
its subheader:
2> if more than one LCG has data available for transmission when the BSR is to
be built:
3> if the number of padding bits is equal to the size of the Short BSR plus
its subheader:
4> report Short Truncated BSR of the LCG with the highest priority logical
channel with data available for transmission.
3> else:
4> report Long Truncated BSR of the LCG(s) with the logical channels having
data available for transmission following a decreasing order of the highest
priority logical channel (with or without data available for transmission) in
each of these LCG(s), and in case of equal priority, in increasing order of
LCGID.
2> else:
3> report Short BSR.
1> else if the number of padding bits is equal to or larger than the size of
the Long BSR plus its subheader:
2> report Long BSR for all LCGs which have data available for transmission.
For Padding BSR, the MAC entity for which _logicalChannelGroupIAB-Ext_ is
configured by upper layers shall:
1> if the number of padding bits is equal to or larger than the size of the
Extended Short BSR plus its subheader but smaller than the size of the
Extended Long BSR plus its subheader:
2> if more than one LCG has data available for transmission when the BSR is to
be built:
3> if the number of padding bits is smaller than the size of the Extended Long
Truncated BSR with zero Buffer Size field plus its subheader:
4> report Extended Short Truncated BSR of the LCG with the highest priority
logical channel with data available for transmission.
3> else:
4> report Extended Long Truncated BSR of the LCG(s) with the logical channels
having data available for transmission following a decreasing order of the
highest priority logical channel (with or without data available for
transmission) in each of these LCG(s), and in case of equal priority, in
increasing order of LCGID.
2> else:
3> report Extended Short BSR.
1> else if the number of padding bits is equal to or larger than the size of
the Extended Long BSR plus its subheader:
2> report Extended Long BSR for all LCGs which have data available for
transmission.
For BSR triggered by _retxBSR-Timer_ expiry, the MAC entity considers that the
logical channel that triggered the BSR is the highest priority logical channel
that has data available for transmission at the time the BSR is triggered.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if the Buffer Status reporting procedure determines that at least one BSR
has been triggered and not cancelled:
2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH
resources can accommodate the BSR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of
logical channel prioritization:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the BSR MAC
CE(s) as defined in clause 6.1.3.1;
3> start or restart _periodicBSR-Timer_ except when all the generated BSRs are
long or short Truncated or Extended long or short Truncated BSRs;
3> start or restart _retxBSR-Timer_.
2> if a Regular BSR has been triggered and _logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_ is
not running:
3> if there is no UL-SCH resource available for a new transmission; or
3> if the MAC entity is configured with configured uplink grant(s) and the
Regular BSR was triggered for a logical channel for which _logicalChannelSR-
Mask_ is set to _false_ ; or
3> if the UL-SCH resources available for a new transmission do not meet the
LCP mapping restrictions (see clause 5.4.3.1) configured for the logical
channel that triggered the BSR:
4> trigger a Scheduling Request.
NOTE 2: UL-SCH resources are considered available if the MAC entity has been
configured with, receives, or determines an uplink grant. If the MAC entity
has determined at a given point in time that UL-SCH resources are available,
this need not imply that UL-SCH resources are available for use at that point
in time.
A MAC PDU shall contain at most one BSR MAC CE, even when multiple events have
triggered a BSR. The Regular BSR and the Periodic BSR shall have precedence
over the padding BSR.
The MAC entity shall restart _retxBSR-Timer_ upon reception of a grant for
transmission of new data on any UL-SCH.
All triggered BSRs may be cancelled when the UL grant(s) can accommodate all
pending data available for transmission but is not sufficient to additionally
accommodate the BSR MAC CE plus its subheader. All BSRs triggered prior to MAC
PDU assembly shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU
includes a Long, Extended Long, Short, or Extended Short BSR MAC CE which
contains buffer status up to (and including) the last event that triggered a
BSR prior to the MAC PDU assembly.
NOTE 3: MAC PDU assembly can happen at any point in time between uplink grant
reception and actual transmission of the corresponding MAC PDU. BSR and SR can
be triggered after the assembly of a MAC PDU which contains a BSR MAC CE, but
before the transmission of this MAC PDU. In addition, BSR and SR can be
triggered during MAC PDU assembly.
NOTE 4: Void
NOTE 5: If a HARQ process is configured with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ and if
the BSR is already included in a MAC PDU for transmission on configured grant
by this HARQ process, but not yet transmitted by lower layers, it is up to UE
implementation how to handle the BSR content.
### 5.4.6 Power Headroom Reporting
The Power Headroom reporting procedure is used to provide the serving gNB with
the following information:
\- Type 1 power headroom: the difference between the nominal UE maximum
transmit power and the estimated power for UL-SCH transmission per activated
Serving Cell;
\- Type 2 power headroom: the difference between the nominal UE maximum
transmit power and the estimated power for UL-SCH and PUCCH transmission on
SpCell of the other MAC entity (i.e. E-UTRA MAC entity in EN-DC, NE-DC, and
NGEN-DC cases);
\- Type 3 power headroom: the difference between the nominal UE maximum
transmit power and the estimated power for SRS transmission per activated
Serving Cell;
\- MPE P-MPR: the power backoff to meet the MPE FR2 requirements for a Serving
Cell operating on FR2.
RRC controls Power Headroom reporting by configuring the following parameters:
\- _phr-PeriodicTimer_ ;
\- _phr-ProhibitTimer_ ;
\- _phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange_ ;
\- _phr-Type2OtherCell_ ;
\- _phr-ModeOtherCG_ ;
\- _multiplePHR_ ;
\- _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ ;
\- _mpe-ProhibitTimer_ ;
\- _mpe-Threshold_ ;
\- _numberOfN_ ;
\- _mpe-ResourcePoolToAddModList_ ;
\- _twoPHRMode_.
A Power Headroom Report (PHR) shall be triggered if any of the following
events occur:
\- _phr-ProhibitTimer_ expires or has expired and the path loss has changed
more than _phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange_ dB for at least one RS used as pathloss
reference for one activated Serving Cell of any MAC entity of which the active
DL BWP is not dormant BWP since the last transmission of a PHR in this MAC
entity when the MAC entity has UL resources for new transmission;
NOTE 1: The path loss variation for one cell assessed above is between the
pathloss measured at present time on the current pathloss reference and the
pathloss measured at the transmission time of the last transmission of PHR on
the pathloss reference in use at that time, irrespective of whether the
pathloss reference has changed in between. The current pathloss reference for
this purpose does not include any pathloss reference configured using
_pathlossReferenceRS-Pos_ in TS 38.331 [5].
\- _phr-PeriodicTimer_ expires;
\- upon configuration or reconfiguration of the power headroom reporting
functionality by upper layers, which is not used to disable the function;
\- activation of an SCell of any MAC entity with configured uplink of which
_firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ is not set to dormant BWP;
\- activation of an SCG;
\- addition of the PSCell except if the SCG is deactivated (i.e. PSCell is
newly added or changed);
\- _phr-ProhibitTimer_ expires or has expired, when the MAC entity has UL
resources for new transmission, and the following is true for any of the
activated Serving Cells of any MAC entity with configured uplink:
\- there are UL resources allocated for transmission or there is a PUCCH
transmission on this cell, and the required power backoff due to power
management (as allowed by P-MPR~c~ as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14], TS
38.101-2 [15], and TS 38.101-3 [16]) for this cell has changed more than _phr-
Tx-PowerFactorChange_ dB since the last transmission of a PHR when the MAC
entity had UL resources allocated for transmission or PUCCH transmission on
this cell.
\- Upon switching of activated BWP from dormant BWP to non-dormant DL BWP of
an SCell of any MAC entity with configured uplink;
\- if _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ is configured, and _mpe-ProhibitTimer_ is not
running:
\- the measured P-MPR applied to meet FR2 MPE requirements as specified in TS
38.101-2 [15] is equal to or larger than _mpe-Threshold_ for at least one
activated FR2 Serving Cell since the last transmission of a PHR in this MAC
entity; or
\- the measured P-MPR applied to meet FR2 MPE requirements as specified in TS
38.101-2 [15] has changed more than _phr-Tx-PowerFactorChange_ dB for at least
one activated FR2 Serving Cell since the last transmission of a PHR due to the
measured P-MPR applied to meet MPE requirements being equal to or larger than
_mpe-Threshold_ in this MAC entity.
in which case the PHR is referred below to as \'MPE P-MPR report\'.
NOTE 2: The MAC entity should avoid triggering a PHR when the required power
backoff due to power management decreases only temporarily (e.g. for up to a
few tens of milliseconds) and it should avoid reflecting such temporary
decrease in the values of P~CMAX,f,c~/PH when a PHR is triggered by other
triggering conditions.
NOTE 3: If a HARQ process is configured with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ and if
the PHR is already included in a MAC PDU for transmission on configured grant
by this HARQ process, but not yet transmitted by lower layers, it is up to UE
implementation how to handle the PHR content.
If the MAC entity has UL resources allocated for a new transmission the MAC
entity shall:
1> if it is the first UL resource allocated for a new transmission since the
last MAC reset:
2> start _phr-PeriodicTimer_.
1> if the Power Headroom reporting procedure determines that at least one PHR
has been triggered and not cancelled; and
1> if the allocated UL resources can accommodate the MAC CE for PHR which the
MAC entity is configured to transmit, plus its subheader, as a result of LCP
as defined in clause 5.4.3.1:
2> if _multiplePHR_ with value _true_ is configured:
3> for each activated Serving Cell with configured uplink associated with any
MAC entity of which the active DL BWP is not dormant BWP; and
3> for each activated Serving Cell with configured uplink associated with
E-UTRA MAC entity:
4> if this MAC entity is configured with _twoPHRMode_ :
5> if this Serving Cell is configured with multiple TRP PUSCH repetition and
the MAC entity this Serving Cell belongs to is configured with _twoPHRMode_ :
> 6> obtain two values of the Type 1 or the value of Type 3 power headroom for
> the corresponding uplink carrier as specified in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6]
> for NR Serving Cell.
5> else:
> 6> obtain the value of the Type 1 or Type 3 power headroom for the
> corresponding uplink carrier as specified in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6] for
> NR Serving Cell and clause 5.1.1.2 of TS 36.213 [17] for E-UTRA Serving

4> else (i.e. this MAC entity is not configured with _twoPHRMode)_ :
5> if this Serving Cell is configured with multiple TRP PUSCH repetition and
the MAC entity this Serving Cell belongs to is configured with _twoPHRMode_ :
6> if there is at least one real PUSCH transmission at the slot where the PHR
MAC CE is transmitted:
> 7> obtain the value of the Type 1 power headroom of the first real
> transmission of the corresponding uplink carrier as specified in clause 7.7
> of TS 38.213[6] for NR Serving Cell.
6> else if there is no real PUSCH transmission at the slot where the PHR MAC
CE is transmitted:
> 7> obtain the value of the type 1 power headroom of the reference PUSCH
> transmission associated with the _SRS-ResourceSet_ with a lower _SRS-
> resourceSetID_ or the value of the type 3 power headroom for the
> corresponding uplink carrier as specified in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213[6] for
> NR Serving Cell.
5> else:
6> obtain the value of the Type 1 or Type 3 power headroom for the
corresponding uplink carrier as specified in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6] for
NR Serving Cell and clause 5.1.1.2 of TS 36.213 [17] for E-UTRA Serving Cell.
4> if this MAC entity has UL resources allocated for transmission on this
Serving Cell; or
4> if the other MAC entity, if configured, has UL resources allocated for
transmission on this Serving Cell and _phr-ModeOtherCG_ is set to _real_ by
upper layers:
5> obtain the value for the corresponding P~CMAX,f,c~ field from the physical
layer.
5> if _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ is configured and this Serving Cell operates on FR2
and this Serving Cell is associated to this MAC entity:
6> obtain the value for the corresponding MPE field from the physical layer.
5> if _mpe-Reporting-FR2-r17 is configured_ and this Serving Cell operates on
FR2 and this Serving Cell is associated to this MAC entity:
6> obtain the value for the corresponding MPE~i~ field from the physical
layer;
6> obtain the value for the corresponding Resource~i~ field from the physical
layer.
3> if _phr-Type2OtherCell_ with value _true_ is configured:
4> if the other MAC entity is E-UTRA MAC entity:
5> obtain the value of the Type 2 power headroom for the SpCell of the other
MAC entity (i.e. E-UTRA MAC entity);
5> if _phr-ModeOtherCG_ is set to _real_ by upper layers:
6> obtain the value for the corresponding P~CMAX,f,c~ field for the SpCell of
the other MAC entity (i.e. E-UTRA MAC entity) from the physical layer.
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate and transmit
the Enhanced Multiple entry PHR as defined in clause 6.1.3.49 if this MAC
entity is configured with _mpe-Reporting-FR2-r17_ or the Enhanced Multiple
Entry PHR for multiple TRP MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.51 if this MAC
entity is configured with _twoPHRMode_ or the Multiple Entry PHR MAC CE as
defined in clause 6.1.3.9 otherwise based on the values reported by the
physical layer.
2> else (i.e. Single Entry PHR format is used):
3> if this MAC entity is configured with _twoPHRMode_ :
4> obtain two values of the Type 1 power headroom from the physical layer for
the corresponding uplink carrier of the PCell.
3> else:
4> obtain the value of the Type 1 power headroom from the physical layer for
the corresponding uplink carrier of the PCell.
3> obtain the value for the corresponding P~CMAX,f,c~ field from the physical
layer;
3> if _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ is configured and this Serving Cell operates on FR2:
4> obtain the value for the corresponding MPE field from the physical layer.
3> if _mpe-Reporting-FR2-r17 is configured_ and this Serving Cell operates on
FR2 and this Serving Cell is associated to this MAC entity:
4> obtain the value for the corresponding MPE~i~ field from the physical
layer;
4> obtain the value for the corresponding Resource~i~ field from the physical
layer.
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate and transmit
the Enhanced Single entry PHR as defined in clause 6.1.3.48 if this MAC entity
is configured with _mpe-Reporting-FR2-r17_ or the Enhanced Single Entry PHR
for multiple TRP MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.50 if this MAC entity is
configured with _twoPHRMode_ or the Single Entry PHR MAC CE as defined in
clause 6.1.3.8 otherwise based on the values reported by the physical layer.
2> if this PHR report is an MPE P-MPR report:
3> start or restart the _mpe-ProhibitTimer_ ;
3> cancel triggered MPE P-MPR reporting for Serving Cells included in the PHR
MAC CE.
2> start or restart _phr-PeriodicTimer_ ;
2> start or restart _phr-ProhibitTimer_ ;
2> cancel all triggered PHR(s).
All triggered PHRs shall be cancelled when there is an ongoing SDT procedure
as in clause 5.27 and the UL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data
available for transmission but is not sufficient to additionally accommodate
the PHR MAC CE plus its subheader.
### 5.4.7 Pre-emptive Buffer Status Reporting
The Pre-emptive Buffer Status reporting (Pre-emptive BSR) procedure is used by
an IAB-MT to provide its parent IAB-DU(s) or IAB-donor-DU(s) with the
information about the amount of the data expected to arrive at the IAB-MT from
its child node(s) and/or UE(s) connected to it.
If configured, Pre-emptive BSR may be triggered for the specific case of an
IAB-MT if any of the following events occur:
\- UL grant is provided to child IAB node or UE;
\- BSR is received from child IAB node or UE.
IAB-MT may report Extended Pre-emptive BSR (as defined in clause 6.1.3.1) if
the MAC entity of the IAB-MT is configured with _logicalChannelGroupIAB-Ext_
by upper layers. Otherwise IAB-MT may report Pre-emptive BSR (as defined in
clause 6.1.3.1).
The MAC entity shall:
1> if the Pre-emptive Buffer Status reporting procedure determines that at
least one Pre-emptive BSR has been triggered and not cancelled:
2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH
resources can accommodate the Extended Pre-emptive BSR or Pre-emptive BSR MAC
CE plus its subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the Extended
Pre-emptive BSR or Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.1.
2> else:
3> trigger a Scheduling Request.
A MAC PDU shall contain at most one Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE or Extended Pre-
emptive BSR MAC CE, even when multiple events have triggered a Pre-emptive
BSR.
All triggered Pre-emptive BSR(s) shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is
transmitted and this PDU includes the corresponding Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE or
Extended Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE.
NOTE: Pre-emptive BSR may be used for the case of dual-connected IAB node. It
is up to network implementation to work out the associated MAC entity or
entities which report the Pre-emptive BSR, and the associated expected amount
of data reported by any such entity or entities. For the case of dual-
connected IAB node, if two ingress BH RLC channels belonging to the same
ingress LCG are mapped to two different egress Cell Groups (corresponding to
different parent nodes), there may be ambiguity in Pre-emptive BSR
calculations and interpretation by the receiving parent node(s) and the IAB
node reporting pre-emptive BSR.
### 5.4.8 Timing Advance Reporting
The Timing Advance reporting procedure is used in a non-terrestrial network to
provide the gNB with an estimate of the UE\'s Timing Advance value (i.e., _T_
~TA~ as defined in the UE\'s TA formula, see TS 38.211 [8] clause 4.3.1).
RRC controls Timing Advance reporting by configuring the following parameters:
_\- offsetThresholdTA_ ;
_\- timingAdvanceSR_.
A Timing Advance report (TAR) shall be triggered if any of the following
events occur:
\- upon indication from upper layers to trigger a Timing Advance report;
\- upon configuration of _offsetThresholdTA_ by upper layers, if the UE has
not previously reported Timing Advance value to current Serving Cell;
\- if the variation between the current estimate of the Timing Advance value
and the last reported Timing Advance value is equal to or larger than
_offsetThresholdTA_ , if configured.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if the Timing Advance reporting procedure determines that at least one TAR
has been triggered and not cancelled:
2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH
resources can accommodate the Timing Advance Report MAC CE plus its subheader
as a result of logical channel prioritization:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the Timing
Advance Report MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.56.
2> else
3> if _timingAdvanceSR_ is configured with value _enabled_ :
4> trigger a Scheduling Request.
NOTE: UL-SCH resources are considered available if the MAC entity has been
configured with, receives, or determines an uplink grant. If the MAC entity
has determined at a given point in time that UL-SCH resources are available,
this need not imply that UL-SCH resources are available for use at that point
in time.
A MAC PDU shall contain at most one Timing Advance Report MAC CE, even when
multiple events have triggered a Timing Advance report. The Timing Advance
Report MAC CE shall be generated based on the latest available estimate of the
UE\'s Timing Advance value prior to the MAC PDU assembly.
All triggered Timing Advance reports shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is
transmitted and this PDU includes a Timing Advance Report MAC CE.
## 5.5 PCH reception
When the MAC entity needs to receive PCH, the MAC entity shall:
1> if a PCH assignment has been received on the PDCCH for the P-RNTI:
2> attempt to decode the TB on the PCH as indicated by the PDCCH information;
2> if the TB on the PCH has been successfully decoded:
3> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.
## 5.6 BCH reception
When the MAC entity needs to receive BCH, the MAC entity shall:
1> receive and attempt to decode the BCH;
1> if a TB on the BCH has been successfully decoded:
2> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to upper layers.
## 5.7 Discontinuous Reception (DRX)
The MAC entity may be configured by RRC with a DRX functionality that controls
the UE\'s PDCCH monitoring activity for the MAC entity\'s C-RNTI, CI-RNTI, CS-
RNTI, INT-RNTI, SFI-RNTI, SP-CSI-RNTI, TPC-PUCCH-RNTI, TPC-PUSCH-RNTI, TPC-
SRS-RNTI, AI-RNTI, SL-RNTI, SL-CS-RNTI and SL Semi-Persistent Scheduling
V-RNTI. When using DRX operation, the MAC entity shall also monitor PDCCH
according to requirements found in other clauses of this specification. When
in RRC_CONNECTED, if DRX is configured, for all the activated Serving Cells,
the MAC entity may monitor the PDCCH discontinuously using the DRX operation
specified in this clause; otherwise the MAC entity shall monitor the PDCCH as
specified in TS 38.213 [6].

Serving Cells of a MAC entity may be configured by RRC in two DRX groups with
separate DRX parameters. W _hen RRC does not configure a secondary DRX group,
there is only one DRX group_ _and all Serving Cells belong to that one DRX
group. When two DRX groups are configured, e_ ach Serving Cell is uniquely
assigned to either of the two groups. The DRX parameters that are separately
configured for each DRX group are: _drx-onDurationTimer_ , _drx-
InactivityTimer. The DRX parameters that are common to the DRX groups are:
drx-SlotOffset_ , _drx-RetransmissionTimerDL_ , _drx-RetransmissionTimerUL_ ,
_drx-LongCycleStartOffset_ , _drx-ShortCycle_ (optional), _drx-
ShortCycleTimer_ (optional), _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL_ , and _drx-HARQ-RTT-
TimerUL_.
When DRX is configured, the Active Time for Serving Cells in a DRX group
includes the time while:
\- _drx-onDurationTimer_ or _drx-InactivityTimer_ configured for the DRX group
is running; or
_\- drx-RetransmissionTimerDL,_ _drx-RetransmissionTimerUL or drx-
RetransmissionTimerSL_ is running on any Serving Cell in the DRX group; or
\- _ra-ContentionResolutionTimer_ (as described in clause 5.1.5) or _msgB-
ResponseWindow_ (as described in clause 5.1.4a) is running; or
\- a Scheduling Request is sent on PUCCH and is pending (as described in
clause 5.4.4 or 5.22.1.5). If this Serving Cell is part of a non-terrestrial
network, the Active Time is started after the Scheduling Request transmission
that is performed when the _SR_COUNTER_ is 0 for all the SR configurations
with pending SR(s) plus the UE-gNB RTT; or
\- a PDCCH indicating a new transmission addressed to the C-RNTI of the MAC
entity has not been received after successful reception of a Random Access
Response for the Random Access Preamble not selected by the MAC entity among
the contention-based Random Access Preamble (as described in clauses 5.1.4 and
5.1.4a).
The following MAC timers are used for DRX operation in a non-terrestrial
network:
\- _HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-NTN_ (per DL HARQ process configured with HARQ feedback
enabled): the minimum duration before a DL assignment for HARQ retransmission
is expected by the MAC entity;
\- _HARQ-RTT-TimerUL-NTN_ (per UL HARQ process configured with _HARQModeA_):
the minimum duration before a UL HARQ retransmission grant is expected by the
MAC entity.
When DRX is not configured and multicast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI or
G-CS-RNTI, the MAC entity shall:
1> monitor the PDCCH as specified in TS 38.213 [6];
1> if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink assignment for unicast;
or

either outside DRX Active Time of the DRX group in which this PUCCH is

PUCCH is configured if CSI masking is setup by upper layers, it is up to UE
implementation whether to report this CSI multiplexed with other UCI(s).
Regardless of whether the MAC entity is monitoring PDCCH or not on the Serving
Cells in a DRX group, the MAC entity transmits HARQ feedback, aperiodic CSI on
PUSCH, and aperiodic SRS defined in TS 38.214 [7] on the Serving Cells in the
DRX group when such is expected.
The MAC entity needs not to monitor the PDCCH if it is not a complete PDCCH
occasion (e.g. the Active Time starts or ends in the middle of a PDCCH
occasion).
## 5.7a Discontinuous Reception (DRX) for MBS Broadcast
For MBS broadcast, the MAC entity may be configured by RRC with a DRX
functionality per G-RNTI that controls the UE\'s PDCCH monitoring activity for
the MAC entity\'s G-RNTI(s) as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. When in RRC_IDLE or
RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED, if broadcast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI,
the MAC entity is allowed to monitor the PDCCH for this G-RNTI discontinuously
using the broadcast DRX operation specified in this clause; otherwise the MAC
entity monitors each PDCCH for this G-RNTI as specified in TS 38.213 [6]. The
broadcast DRX operation specified in this clause is performed independently
for each G-RNTI and independently from the DRX operation specified in clauses
5.7 and 5.7b.
RRC controls broadcast DRX operation by configuring the following parameters:
\- _drx-onDurationTimerPTM_ : the duration at the beginning of a DRX cycle;
\- _drx-SlotOffsetPTM_ : the delay before starting the _drx-
onDurationTimerPTM_ ;
\- _drx-InactivityTimerPTM_ : the duration after the PDCCH occasion in which a
PDCCH indicates a new DL broadcast transmission for the MAC entity;
\- _drx-LongCycleStartOffsetPTM_ : the long DRX cycle _drx-LongCycle-PTM_ and
_drx-StartOffset-PTM_ which defines the subframe where the DRX cycle starts.
When broadcast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI, the Active Time includes the
time while:
_\- drx-onDurationTimerPTM_ or _drx-InactivityTimerPTM_ for this G-RNTI is
running.
When broadcast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI, the MAC entity shall for this
G-RNTI:
1> if [(SFN Ã— 10) + subframe number] modulo (_drx-LongCycle-PTM_) = _drx-
StartOffset-PTM_ :
2> start _drx-onDurationTimerPTM_ after _drx-SlotOffsetPTM_ from the beginning
of the subframe.
1> if the MAC entity is in Active Time for this G-RNTI:
2> monitor the PDCCH for this G-RNTI as specified in TS 38.213 [6];
2> if the PDCCH indicates a DL transmission for MBS broadcast:
3> start or restart _drx-InactivityTimerPTM_ in the first symbol after the end
of the PDCCH reception.
NOTE: If a cell is configured for MBS broadcast reception, the SFN of this
cell is used to calculate the DRX duration of MBS broadcast on this cell.
## 5.7b Discontinuous Reception (DRX) for MBS Multicast
For MBS multicast, the MAC entity may be configured by RRC with a DRX
functionality per G-RNTI or per G-CS-RNTI that controls the UE\'s PDCCH
monitoring activity for the MAC entity\'s G-RNTI(s) and G-CS-RNTI(s) as
specified in TS 38.331 [5]. When in RRC_CONNECTED, if multicast DRX is
configured for a G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, the MAC entity is allowed to monitor the
PDCCH for this G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI discontinuously using the multicast DRX
operation specified in this clause; otherwise the MAC entity monitors the
PDCCH for this G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI as specified in TS 38.213 [6]. The
multicast DRX operation specified in this clause is performed independently
for each G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI and independently from the DRX operation
specified in clauses 5.7 and 5.7a.
RRC controls multicast DRX operation per G-RNTI or per G-CS-RNTI by
configuring the following parameters:
\- _drx-onDurationTimerPTM_ : the duration at the beginning of a DRX cycle;
\- _drx-SlotOffsetPTM_ : the delay before starting the _drx-
onDurationTimerPTM_ ;
\- _drx-InactivityTimerPTM_ : the duration after the PDCCH occasion in which a
PDCCH indicates a new DL multicast transmission for the MAC entity;
\- _drx-LongCycleStartOffsetPTM_ : the long DRX cycle _drx-LongCycle-PTM_ and
_drx-StartOffset-PTM_ which defines the subframe where the long DRX cycle
starts;
\- _drx-RetransmissionTimerDL-PTM_ (per DL HARQ process for MBS multicast):
the maximum duration until a DL multicast retransmission is received;
\- _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM_ (per DL HARQ process for MBS multicast): the
minimum duration before a DL multicast assignment for HARQ retransmission is
expected by the MAC entity.
When multicast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, the Active Time
includes the time while:

When multicast DRX is not configured for a G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, and the _cfr-
ConfigMulticast_ is configured for at least one of the active BWP(s) of the
Serving Cell(s), and unicast DRX is configured, the MAC entity shall for this
G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI:
1> monitor the PDCCH as specified in TS 38.213 [6];
1> if the PDCCH addressed to G-RNTI indicates a DL multicast transmission; or
1> if the PDCCH addressed to G-CS-RNTI indicates a DL multicast transmission
and CS-RNTI is configured; or
1> if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink multicast assignment and
CS-RNTI is configured:

first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the DL
HARQ feedback.
2> stop the _drx-RetransmissionTimerDL_ for the corresponding HARQ process.
When multicast DRX is configured for a G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI, and the _cfr-
ConfigMulticast_ is configured for at least one of the active BWP(s) of the
Serving Cell(s), the MAC entity shall for this G-RNTI or G-CS-RNTI:
1> if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink multicast assignment:
2> if HARQ feedback is enabled:
3> start the _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL-PTM_ for the corresponding HARQ process in
the first symbol after the end of the corresponding transmission carrying the
DL HARQ feedback;
3> if the first HARQ-ACK reporting mode (i.e. ack-nack) is used as specified
in TS 38.213 [6]; and
3> if CS-RNTI is configured:

2> if the PDCCH indicates a new multicast transmission for this G-RNTI or
G-CS-RNTI:
3> start or restart _drx-InactivityTimerPTM_ in the first symbol after the end
of the PDCCH reception.
NOTE 1: A PDCCH indicating activation of multicast SPS is considered to
indicate a new transmission.
NOTE 2: The UE may start the _drx-HARQ-RTT-TimerDL_ after receiving a PTM
transmission only if _ptp-Retx-Multicast_ or _ptp-Retx-SPS-Multicast_ was
included in the _UECapabilityInformation_ message to network.
The MAC entity needs not to monitor the PDCCH for a G-RNTI or a G-CS-RNTI if
it is not a complete PDCCH occasion (e.g. the Active Time for a G-RNTI or a
G-CS-RNTI starts or ends in the middle of a PDCCH occasion).
## 5.8 Transmission and reception without dynamic scheduling
### 5.8.1 Downlink
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) is configured by RRC for a Serving Cell per
BWP. Multiple assignments can be active simultaneously in the same BWP.
Activation and deactivation of the DL SPS are independent among the Serving
Cells.
For the DL SPS, a DL assignment is provided by PDCCH, and stored or cleared
based on L1 signalling indicating SPS activation or deactivation.
RRC configures the following parameters when the SPS is configured:
\- _cs-RNTI_ : CS-RNTI for activation, deactivation, and retransmission;
\- _nrofHARQ-Processes_ : the number of configured HARQ processes for SPS;
\- _harq-ProcID-Offset_ : Offset of HARQ process for SPS;
\- _periodicity_ : periodicity of configured downlink assignment for SPS.
When the SPS is released by upper layers, all the corresponding configurations
shall be released.
After a downlink assignment is configured for SPS, the MAC entity shall
consider sequentially that the N^th^ downlink assignment occurs in the slot
for which:
> (_numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— SFN + slot number in the frame) =\
> [(_numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— SFN~start\ time~ + slot~start\ time~) + N Ã—
> _periodicity_ Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ / 10]\ modulo (1024 Ã—
> _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_)
where SFN~start\ time~ and slot~start\ time~ are the SFN and slot,
respectively, of the first transmission of PDSCH where the configured downlink
assignment was (re-)initialised.
NOTE: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of the
concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the occurrences of configured
downlink assignments.
### 5.8.1a Downlink for Multicast
MBS Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) is configured by RRC on one Serving Cell
per BWP. Multiple assignments can be active simultaneously in the same BWP.
For the DL MBS SPS, a DL assignment is provided by PDCCH, and stored or
cleared based on L1 signalling indicating SPS activation or deactivation.
RRC configures the following parameters when the MBS SPS is configured:
\- _cs-RNTI_ : CS-RNTI for MBS SPS deactivation, PTP for PTM retransmission if
configured;
\- _g-cs-RNTI_ : G-CS-RNTI for activation, deactivation, and retransmission;
\- _nrofHARQ-Processes_ : the number of configured HARQ processes for MBS SPS;
\- _harq-ProcID-Offset_ : Offset of HARQ process for MBS SPS;
\- _periodicity_ : periodicity of configured downlink assignment for MBS SPS.
When the MBS SPS is released by upper layers, all the corresponding
configurations shall be released.
After a downlink assignment is configured for MBS SPS, the MAC entity shall
consider sequentially that the N^th^ downlink assignment occurs in the slot
for which:
> (_numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— SFN + slot number in the frame) =\
> [(_numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— SFN~start\ time~ + slot~start\ time~) + N Ã—
> _periodicity_ Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ / 10]\ modulo (1024 Ã—
> _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_)
where SFN~start\ time~ and slot~start\ time~ are the SFN and slot,
respectively, of the first transmission of PDSCH where the configured downlink
assignment was (re-)initialised.
### 5.8.2 Uplink
There are two types of transmission without dynamic grant:
\- configured grant Type 1 where an uplink grant is provided by RRC, and
stored as configured uplink grant;
\- configured grant Type 2 where an uplink grant is provided by PDCCH, and
stored or cleared as configured uplink grant based on L1 signalling indicating
configured uplink grant activation or deactivation.
Type 1 and Type 2 are configured by RRC for a Serving Cell per BWP. Multiple
configurations can be active simultaneously in the same BWP. For Type 2,
activation and deactivation are independent among the Serving Cells. For the
same BWP, the MAC entity can be configured with both Type 1 and Type 2.
Only configured grant Type 1 can be configured for CG-SDT. CG-SDT can only be
configured on initial BWP.
RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 1 is
configured:
\- _cs-RNTI_ : CS-RNTI for retransmission;
\- _cg-SDT-CS-RNTI_ : CS-RNTI for CG-SDT retransmission;
\- _cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB_ : an RSRP threshold configured for SSB selection
for CG-SDT;
\- _periodicity_ : periodicity of the configured grant Type 1;
\- _timeDomainOffset_ : Offset of a resource with respect to SFN =
_timeReferenceSFN_ in time domain;
\- _timeDomainAllocation_ : Allocation of configured uplink grant in time
domain which contains _startSymbolAndLength_ (i.e. _SLIV_ in TS 38.214 [7]) or
_startSymbol_ (i.e. _S_ in TS 38.214 [7]);
\- _nrofHARQ-Processes_ : the number of HARQ processes for configured grant;
\- _harq-ProcID-Offset_ : offset of HARQ process for configured grant
configured with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ for operation with shared spectrum
channel access;
\- _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ : offset of HARQ process for configured grant not
configured with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ ;
\- _timeReferenceSFN_ : SFN used for determination of the offset of a resource
in time domain. The UE uses the closest SFN with the indicated number
preceding the reception of the configured grant configuration.
RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 2 is
configured:
\- _cs-RNTI_ : CS-RNTI for activation, deactivation, and retransmission;
\- _periodicity_ : periodicity of the configured grant Type 2;
\- _nrofHARQ-Processes_ : the number of HARQ processes for configured grant;
\- _harq-ProcID-Offset_ : offset of HARQ process for configured grant
configured with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ for operation with shared spectrum
channel access;
\- _harq-ProcID-Offset2_ : offset of HARQ process for configured grant not
configured with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_.
RRC configures the following parameter when retransmissions on configured
uplink grant is configured:
\- _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ : the duration after a configured grant
(re)transmission of a HARQ process when the UE shall not autonomously
retransmit that HARQ process;
\- _cg-SDT-RetransmissionTimer_ : the duration after a configured grant
(re)transmission of a HARQ process of the initial CG-SDT transmission with
CCCH message when the UE shall not autonomously retransmit the HARQ process.
Upon configuration of a configured grant Type 1 for a BWP of a Serving Cell by
upper layers, the MAC entity shall:
1> store the uplink grant provided by upper layers as a configured uplink
grant for the indicated BWP of the Serving Cell;
1> initialise or re-initialise the configured uplink grant to start in the
symbol according to _timeDomainOffset_ , _timeReferenceSFN_ , and _S_ (derived
from _SLIV_ or provided by _startSymbol_ as specified in TS 38.214 [7]), and
to reoccur with _periodicity_.
After an uplink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 1, the MAC
entity shall consider sequentially that the N^th^ (N >= 0) uplink grant occurs
in the symbol for which:
[(SFN Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_)\ \+ (slot number
in the frame Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_) + symbol number in the slot] =\
(_timeReferenceSFN_ Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ \ \+
_timeDomainOffset_ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ \+ S + N Ã— _periodicity_)\
modulo (1024 Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_)
For an uplink grant configured for configured grant Type 1 for CG-SDT on the
selected uplink carrier as in clause 5.27, when CG-SDT is triggered and not
terminated, for each configured uplink grant valid according to TS 38.214 [7]
for which the above formula is satisfied, the MAC entity shall:
1> if, after initial transmission for CG-SDT with CCCH message has been
performed according to clause 5.4.1, PDCCH addressed to the MAC entity\'s
C-RNTI has not been received:
2> if the SSB corresponding to the configured UL grant has the same SSB index
as the SSB selected for initial transmission for CG-SDT with CCCH message
(i.e., retransmission of initial transmission of CG-SDT):
3> select this SSB;
3> indicate the SSB index corresponding to the configured uplink grant to the
lower layer;
3> consider this configured uplink grant as valid.
1> else if at least one SSB configured for CG-SDT with SS-RSRP above _cg-SDT-
RSRP-ThresholdSSB_ is available:
2> if at least one SSB corresponding to the configured uplink grant with SS-
RSRP above the _cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB is available_ :
3> if this is the initial transmission of CG-SDT with CCCH message after the
CG-SDT procedure is initiated as in clause 5.27 (i.e., initial transmission
for CG-SDT):
4> select an SSB with SS-RSRP above _cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB_ amongst the
SSB(s) associated with the configured uplink grant.
3> else if PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI has been received after the initial
transmission of CG-SDT with CCCH message (i.e., subsequent new transmission
for CG-SDT):
4> if SS-RSRP of the SSB selected for the previous transmission for CG-SDT is
above _cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB_ and this SSB is associated with this
configured uplink grant:
5> select this SSB.
4> else if SS-RSRP of the SSB selected for the previous transmission for CG-
SDT is not above _cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB_ :
5> select an SSB with SS-RSRP above _cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB_ amongst the
SSB(s) associated with the configured uplink grant.
3> if SSB is selected above:
4> indicate the SSB index to the lower layer;
4> consider this configured uplink grant as valid.
1> else:
2> consider this configured uplink grant as not valid.
2> if PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI after the initial transmission of the CG-SDT
with CCCH message has been received:
3> if there is data available for transmission for at least one RB configured
for SDT:
4> initiate Random Access procedure in clause 5.1.
NOTE 1: When the UE determines if there is an SSB with SS-RSRP above _cg-SDT-
RSRP-ThresholdSSB_ , the UE uses the latest unfiltered L1-RSRP measurement.
After an uplink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 2, the MAC
entity shall consider sequentially that the N^th^ (N >= 0) uplink grant occurs
in the symbol for which:
[(SFN Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_)\ \+ (slot number
in the frame Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_) + symbol number in the slot] =\
[(SFN~start\ time~ Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ \ \+
slot~start\ time~ Ã— _numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_ \+ symbol~start\ time~) + N Ã—
_periodicity_]\ modulo (1024 Ã— _numberOfSlotsPerFrame_ Ã—
_numberOfSymbolsPerSlot_)
where SFN~start\ time~, slot~start\ time~, and symbol~start\ time~ are the
SFN, slot, and symbol, respectively, of the first transmission opportunity of
PUSCH where the configured uplink grant was (re-)initialised.
If _cg-nrofPUSCH-InSlot_ or _cg-nrofSlots_ is configured for a configured
grant Type 1 or Type 2, the MAC entity shall consider the uplink grants occur
in those additional PUSCH allocations as specified in clause 6.1.2.3 of TS
38.214 [7].
NOTE 2: In case of unaligned SFN across carriers in a cell group, the SFN of
the concerned Serving Cell is used to calculate the occurrences of configured
uplink grants.
When the configured uplink grant is released by upper layers, all the
corresponding configurations shall be released and all corresponding uplink
grants shall be cleared.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if at least one configured uplink grant confirmation has been triggered and
not cancelled; and
1> if the MAC entity has UL resources allocated for new transmission:
2> if, in this MAC entity, at least one configured uplink grant is configured
by _configuredGrantConfigToAddModList_ :
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Multiple
Entry Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.31.
2> else:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Configured
Grant Confirmation MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.7.
2> cancel all triggered configured uplink grant confirmation(s).
For a configured grant Type 2, the MAC entity shall clear the configured
uplink grant(s) immediately after first transmission of Configured Grant
Confirmation MAC CE or Multiple Entry Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE
which confirms the configured uplink grant deactivation.
Retransmissions use:
\- repetition of configured uplink grants; or
\- received uplink grants addressed to CS-RNTI; or
\- configured uplink grants with _cg-RetransmissionTimer_ or _cg-SDT-
RetransmissionTimer_ configured.
### 5.8.3 Sidelink
There are two types of transmission without dynamic sidelink grant:
\- configured grant Type 1 where an sidelink grant is provided by RRC, and
stored as configured sidelink grant;
\- configured grant Type 2 where an sidelink grant is provided by PDCCH, and
stored or cleared as configured sidelink grant based on L1 signalling
indicating configured sidelink grant activation or deactivation.
Type 1 and/or Type 2 are configured with a single BWP. Multiple configurations
of up to 8 configured grants (including both Type 1 and Type 2, if configured)
can be active simultaneously on the BWP.
RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 1 is
configured, as specified in TS 38.331 [5] or TS 36.331 [21]:
\- _sl-ConfigIndexCG_ : the identifier of a configured grant for sidelink;
\- _sl-CS-RNTI_ : SL-CS-RNTI for retransmission;
\- _sl-NrOfHARQ-Processes_ : the number of HARQ processes for configured
grant;
\- _sl-PeriodCG_ : periodicity of the configured grant Type 1;
\- _sl-TimeOffsetCG-Type1_ : Offset of a resource with respect to reference
logical slot defined by _sl-TimeReferenceSFN-Type1_ in time domain, referring
to the number of logical slots in a resource pool;
\- _sl-TimeResourceCG-Type1_ : time resource location of the configured grant
Type 1;
\- _sl-CG-MaxTransNumList_ : the maximum number of times that a TB can be
transmitted using the configured grant;
_\- sl-HARQ-ProcID-offset_ : offset of HARQ process for configured grant Type
1;
\- _sl-TimeReferenceSFN-Type1_ : SFN used for determination of the offset of a
resource in time domain. If it is present, the UE uses the first logical slot
of associated resource pool after the starting time of the closest SFN with
the indicated number preceding the reception of the sidelink configured grant
configuration Type 1 as reference logical slot. If it is absent, the indicated
reference SFN is zero.
RRC configures the following parameters when the configured grant Type 2 is
configured, as specified in TS 38.331 [5]:
\- _sl-ConfigIndexCG_ : the identifier of a configured grant for sidelink;
\- _sl-CS-RNTI_ : SL-CS-RNTI for activation, deactivation, and retransmission;
\- _sl-NrOfHARQ-Processes_ : the number of HARQ processes for configured
grant;
\- _sl-PeriodCG_ : periodicity of the configured grant Type 2;
\- _sl-CG-MaxTransNumList_ : the maximum number of times that a TB can be
transmitted using the configured grant;
_\- sl-HARQ-ProcID-offset_ : offset of HARQ process for configured grant Type
2.
Upon configuration of a configured grant Type 1, the MAC entity shall for each
configured sidelink grant:
1> store the sidelink grant provided by RRC as a configured sidelink grant;
1> initialise or re-initialise the configured sidelink grant to determine
PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) according to _sl-TimeOffsetCG-Type1_
and _sl-TimeResourceCG-Type1_ , and to reoccur with _sl-periodCG_ for
transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs according to clause 8.1.2 of TS 38.214 [7].
NOTE 1: If the MAC entity is configured with multiple configured sidelink
grants, collision among the configured sidelink grants may occur. How to
handle the collision is left to UE implementation.
After a sidelink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 1, the MAC
entity shall consider sequentially that the first slot of the S^th^ sidelink
grant occurs in the logical slot for which:
_CURRENT_slot_ = (_sl-ReferenceSlotCG-Type1_ \+ _sl-TimeOffsetCG-Type1 +_ S Ã—
_PeriodicitySL)_ modulo _T\'~max~_
where CURRENT_slot refers to current logical slot in the associated resource
pool,$\ PeriodicitySL = \left\lceil \frac{{T'}_{\max}\ }{10240\ ms} \times
sl\text{-}P\text{eriodCG} \right\rceil$ and T\'~max~ is the number of slots
that belongs to the associated resource pool as defined in clause 8 of TS
38.214[7]. _sl-ReferenceSlotCG-Type1_ refers to reference logical slot defined
by _sl-TimeReferenceSFN-Type1_.
After a sidelink grant is configured for a configured grant Type 2, the MAC
entity shall consider sequentially that the first slot of S^th^ sidelink grant
occurs in the logical slot for which:
_CURRENT_slot = (sl-StartSlotCG-Type2 +_ S Ã— _PeriodicitySL)_ modulo
_T\'~max~_
where _sl-StartSlotCG-Type2_ refers to the logical slot of the first
transmission opportunity of PSSCH where the configured sidelink grant was
(re)initialised.
When a configured sidelink grant is released by RRC, all the corresponding
configurations shall be released and all corresponding sidelink grants shall
be cleared.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if the configured sidelink grant confirmation has been triggered and not
cancelled; and
1> if the MAC entity has UL resources allocated for new transmission:
2> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Sidelink
Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.34;
2> cancel the triggered configured sidelink grant confirmation.
For a configured grant Type 2, the MAC entity shall clear the corresponding
configured sidelink grant immediately after first transmission of Sidelink
Configured Grant Confirmation MAC CE triggered by the configured sidelink
grant deactivation.
## 5.9 Activation/Deactivation of SCells
If the MAC entity is configured with one or more SCells, the network may
activate and deactivate the configured SCells. Upon configuration of an SCell,
the SCell is deactivated unless the parameter _sCellState_ is set to
_activated_ for the SCell by upper layers.
The configured SCell(s) is activated and deactivated by:
\- receiving the SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in clause
6.1.3.10;
\- receiving the Enhanced SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE described in
clause 6.1.3.55;
\- configuring _sCellDeactivationTimer_ timer per configured SCell (except the
SCell configured with PUCCH, if any): the associated SCell is deactivated upon
its expiry;
\- configuring _sCellState_ per configured SCell: if configured, the
associated SCell is activated upon SCell configuration;
\- receiving _scg-State_ : the SCells of SCG are deactivated.
The MAC entity shall for each configured SCell:
1> if an SCell is configured with _sCellState_ set to _activated_ upon SCell
configuration, or an SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE or an Enhanced SCell
Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received activating the SCell:
2> if the SCell was deactivated prior to receiving this Enhanced SCell
Activation/Deactivation MAC CE and a TRS is indicated for this SCell:
> 3> indicate to lower layers the information regarding the TRS.
2> if the SCell was deactivated prior to receiving this SCell
Activation/Deactivation MAC CE or this Enhanced SCell Activation/Deactivation
MAC CE; or
2> if the SCell is configured with _sCellState_ set to _activated_ upon SCell
configuration:
3> if _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ is not set to dormant BWP:
4> activate the SCell according to the timing defined in TS 38.213 [6] for MAC
CE activation and according to the timing defined in TS 38.133 [11] for direct
SCell activation; i.e. apply normal SCell operation including:
5> SRS transmissions on the SCell;
5> CSI reporting for the SCell;
5> PDCCH monitoring on the SCell;
5> PDCCH monitoring for the SCell;
5> PUCCH transmissions on the SCell, if configured.
3> else (i.e. _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ is set to dormant BWP):
4> stop the _bwp-InactivityTimer_ of this Serving Cell, if running.
3> activate the DL BWP and UL BWP indicated by _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ and
_firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id_ respectively.
2> start or restart the _sCellDeactivationTimer_ associated with the SCell
according to the timing defined in TS 38.213 [6] for MAC CE activation and
according to the timing defined in TS 38.133 [11] for direct SCell activation;
2> if the active DL BWP is not the dormant BWP:
3> (re-)initialize any suspended configured uplink grants of configured grant
Type 1 associated with this SCell according to the stored configuration, if
any, and to start in the symbol according to rules in clause 5.8.2;
3> trigger PHR according to clause 5.4.6.
1> else if an SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE or an Enhanced SCell
Activation/Deactivation MAC CE is received deactivating the SCell; or
1> if the _sCellDeactivationTimer_ associated with the activated SCell
expires; or
1> if the SCG associated with the activated SCell is deactivated:
2> deactivate the SCell according to the timing defined in TS 38.213 [6];
2> stop the _sCellDeactivationTimer_ associated with the SCell;
2> stop the _bwp-InactivityTimer_ associated with the SCell;
2> deactivate any active BWP associated with the SCell;
2> clear any configured downlink assignment and any configured uplink grant
Type 2 associated with the SCell respectively;
2> clear any PUSCH resource for semi-persistent CSI reporting associated with
the SCell;
2> suspend any configured uplink grant Type 1 associated with the SCell;
2> flush all HARQ buffers associated with the SCell;
2> cancel, if any, triggered consistent LBT failure for the SCell.
1> if PDCCH on the activated SCell indicates an uplink grant or downlink
assignment; or
1> if PDCCH on the Serving Cell scheduling the activated SCell indicates an
uplink grant or a downlink assignment for the activated SCell; or
1> if a MAC PDU is transmitted in a configured uplink grant and LBT failure
indication is not received from lower layers; or
1> if a MAC PDU is received in a configured downlink assignment:
2> restart the _sCellDeactivationTimer_ associated with the SCell.
1> if the SCell is deactivated:
2> not transmit SRS on the SCell;
2> not report CSI for the SCell;
2> not transmit on UL-SCH on the SCell;
2> not transmit on RACH on the SCell;
2> not monitor the PDCCH on the SCell;
2> not monitor the PDCCH for the SCell;
2> not transmit PUCCH on the SCell.
HARQ feedback for the MAC PDU containing SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE
or Enhanced SCell Activation/Deactivation MAC CE shall not be impacted by
PCell, PSCell and PUCCH SCell interruptions due to SCell
activation/deactivation in TS 38.133 [11].
When SCell is deactivated, the ongoing Random Access procedure on the SCell,
if any, is aborted.
## 5.10 Activation/Deactivation of PDCP duplication

## 5.15 Bandwidth Part (BWP) operation
### 5.15.1 Downlink and Uplink
In addition to clause 12 of TS 38.213 [6], this clause specifies requirements
on BWP operation.
A Serving Cell may be configured with one or multiple BWPs, and the maximum
number of BWP per Serving Cell is specified in TS 38.213 [6].
The BWP switching for a Serving Cell is used to activate an inactive BWP and
deactivate an active BWP at a time. The BWP switching is controlled by the
PDCCH indicating a downlink assignment or an uplink grant, by the _bwp-
InactivityTimer_ , by RRC signalling, or by the MAC entity itself upon
initiation of Random Access procedure or upon detection of consistent LBT
failure on SpCell. Upon RRC (re-)configuration of _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_
and/or _firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id_ for SpCell except for PSCell when SCG is
deactivated (see clause 5.29) or activation of an SCell, the DL BWP and/or UL
BWP indicated by _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ and/or _firstActiveUplinkBWP-Id_
respectively (as specified in TS 38.331 [5]) is active without receiving PDCCH
indicating a downlink assignment or an uplink grant. Upon RRC
(re-)configuration of _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ for PSCell when SCG is
deactivated, the DL BWP is switched to the _firstActiveDownlinkBWP-Id_ as
specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The active BWP for a Serving Cell is indicated by
either RRC or PDCCH (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]). For unpaired spectrum, a
DL BWP is paired with a UL BWP, and BWP switching is common for both UL and
DL.
For each SCell a dormant BWP may be configured with _dormantBWP-Id_ _by_ RRC
signalling as described in TS 38.331 [5]_._ Entering or leaving dormant BWP
for SCells is done by BWP switching per SCell or per dormancy SCell group
based on instruction from PDCCH (as specified in TS 38.213 [6]). The dormancy
SCell group configurations are configured by RRC signalling as described in TS
38.331 [5]. Upon reception of the PDCCH indicating leaving dormant BWP, the DL
BWP indicated by _firstOutsideActiveTimeBWP-Id_ or by
_firstWithinActiveTimeBWP-Id_ (as specified in TS 38.331 [5] and TS 38.213
[6]) is activated. Upon reception of the PDCCH indicating entering dormant
BWP, the DL BWP indicated by _dormantBWP-Id_ (as specified in TS 38.331 [5])
is activated. The dormant BWP configuration for SpCell or PUCCH SCell is not
supported.
For each activated Serving Cell configured with a BWP, the MAC entity shall:
1> if a BWP is activated and the active DL BWP for the Serving Cell is not the
dormant BWP and the Serving Cell is not the PSCell of deactivated SCG:
2> transmit on UL-SCH on the BWP;
2> transmit on RACH on the BWP, if PRACH occasions are configured;
2> monitor the PDCCH on the BWP;
2> transmit PUCCH on the BWP, if configured;
2> report CSI for the BWP;
2> transmit SRS on the BWP, if configured;
2> receive DL-SCH on the BWP;
2> (re-)initialize any suspended configured uplink grants of configured grant
Type 1 on the active BWP according to the stored configuration, if any, and to
start in the symbol according to rules in clause 5.8.2;
2> if _lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig_ is configured:
3> stop the _lbt-FailureDetectionTimer_ , if running;
3> set _LBT_COUNTER_ to 0;
3> monitor LBT failure indications from lower layers as specified in clause
5.21.2.
1> if a BWP is activated and the active DL BWP for the Serving Cell is dormant
BWP:
2> stop the _bwp-InactivityTimer_ of this Serving Cell, if running.
2> not monitor the PDCCH on the BWP;
2> not monitor the PDCCH for the BWP;
2> not receive DL-SCH on the BWP;
2> not report CSI on the BWP, report CSI except aperiodic CSI for the BWP;
2> not transmit SRS on the BWP;
2> not transmit on UL-SCH on the BWP;
2> not transmit on RACH on the BWP;
2> not transmit PUCCH on the BWP;
2> clear any configured downlink assignment and any configured uplink grant
Type 2 associated with the SCell respectively;
2> suspend any configured uplink grant Type 1 associated with the SCell;
2> if configured, perform beam failure detection and beam failure recovery for
the SCell if beam failure is detected.
1> if a BWP is deactivated or the Serving Cell is PSCell of deactivated SCG:
2> not transmit on UL-SCH on the BWP;
2> not transmit on RACH on the BWP;
2> not monitor the PDCCH on the BWP;
2> not transmit PUCCH on the BWP;
2> not report CSI for the BWP;
2> not transmit SRS on the BWP;
2> not receive DL-SCH on the BWP;
2> clear any configured downlink assignment and configured uplink grant of
configured grant Type 2 on the BWP;
2> suspend any configured uplink grant of configured grant Type 1 on the
inactive BWP.
Upon initiation of the Random Access procedure on a Serving Cell, after the
selection of carrier for performing Random Access procedure as specified in
clause 5.1.1, the MAC entity shall for the selected carrier of this Serving
Cell:
1> if PRACH occasions are not configured for the active UL BWP:
2> if the UE is a RedCap UE; and
2> if _initialUplinkBWP-RedCap_ is configured:
3> switch the active UL BWP to BWP indicated by _initialUplinkBWP-RedCap_.
2> else:
3> switch the active UL BWP to BWP indicated by _initialUplinkBWP_.
2> if the Serving Cell is an SpCell:
3> if the UE is a RedCap UE; and
3> if _initialDownlinkBWP-RedCap_ is configured:
4> switch the active DL BWP to BWP indicated by _initialDownlinkBWP-RedCap_.
3> else:
4> switch the active DL BWP to BWP indicated by _initialDownlinkBWP_.
1> else:
2> if the Serving Cell is an SpCell:
3> if the active DL BWP does not have the same _bwp-Id_ as the active UL BWP:
4> switch the active DL BWP to the DL BWP with the same _bwp-Id_ as the active
UL BWP.

2> stop the _bwp-InactivityTimer_ associated with the active DL BWP of SpCell,
if running.
1> perform the Random Access procedure on the active DL BWP of SpCell and
active UL BWP of this Serving Cell.

Cell; or
1> if the ongoing Random Access procedure associated with this Serving Cell is
successfully completed upon reception of this PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI (as
specified in clauses 5.1.4, 5.1.4a, and 5.1.5):
2> cancel, if any, triggered consistent LBT failure for this Serving Cell;
2> perform BWP switching to a BWP indicated by the PDCCH.
If the MAC entity receives a PDCCH for BWP switching for a Serving Cell(s) or
a dormancy SCell group(s) while a Random Access procedure associated with that
Serving Cell is ongoing in the MAC entity, it is up to UE implementation
whether to switch BWP or ignore the PDCCH for BWP switching, except for the
PDCCH reception for BWP switching addressed to the C-RNTI for successful
Random Access procedure completion (as specified in clauses 5.1.4, 5.1.4a, and
5.1.5) in which case the UE shall perform BWP switching to a BWP indicated by
the PDCCH. Upon reception of the PDCCH for BWP switching other than successful
contention resolution, if the MAC entity decides to perform BWP switching, the
MAC entity shall stop the ongoing Random Access procedure and initiate a
Random Access procedure after performing the BWP switching; if the MAC decides
to ignore the PDCCH for BWP switching, the MAC entity shall continue with the
ongoing Random Access procedure on the Serving Cell.
Upon reception of RRC (re-)configuration for BWP switching for a Serving Cell
while a Random Access procedure associated with that Serving Cell is ongoing
in the MAC entity, the MAC entity shall stop the ongoing Random Access
procedure and initiate a Random Access procedure after performing the BWP
switching.
Upon reception of RRC (re-)configuration for BWP switching for a Serving Cell,
cancel any triggered consistent LBT failure in this Serving Cell.
The MAC entity shall for each activated Serving Cell configured with _bwp-

## 5.16 SUL operation
The Supplementary UL (SUL) carrier can be configured as a complement to the
normal UL (NUL) carrier. Switching between the NUL carrier and the SUL carrier
means that the UL transmissions move from one carrier to the other carrier,
which is done by:
\- an indication in DCI;
\- the Random Access procedure as specified in clause 5.1.1;
\- the SDT procedure as specified in clause 5.27.
If the MAC entity receives a UL grant indicating an SUL switch while a Random
Access procedure is ongoing, the MAC entity shall ignore the UL grant.
The Serving Cell configured with _supplementaryUplink_ belongs to a single
TAG.
## 5.17 Beam Failure Detection and Recovery procedure
The MAC entity may be configured by RRC per Serving Cell or per BFD-RS set
with a beam failure recovery procedure which is used for indicating to the
serving gNB of a new SSB or CSI-RS when beam failure is detected on the
serving SSB(s)/CSI-RS(s). Beam failure is detected by counting beam failure
instance indication from the lower layers to the MAC entity. If
_beamFailureRecoveryConfig_ is reconfigured by upper layers during an ongoing
Random Access procedure for beam failure recovery for SpCell, the MAC entity
shall stop the ongoing Random Access procedure and initiate a Random Access
procedure using the new configuration. The Serving Cell is configured with two
BFD-RS sets if and only if _failureDetectionSet1_ and _failureDetectionSet2_
are configured for the active DL BWP of the Serving Cell. When the SCG is
deactivated, the UE performs beam failure detection on the PSCell if _bfd-and-
RLM_ is set to _true._
RRC configures the following parameters in the _beamFailureRecoveryConfig_ ,
_beamFailureRecoverySpCellConfig_ , _beamFailureRecoverySCellConfig_ and the
_radioLinkMonitoringConfig_ for the Beam Failure Detection and Recovery
procedure:
\- _beamFailureInstanceMaxCount_ for the beam failure detection (per Serving
Cell or per BFD-RS set of Serving Cell configured with two BFD-RS sets);
\- _beamFailureDetectionTimer_ for the beam failure detection (per Serving
Cell or per BFD-RS set of Serving Cell configured with two BFD-RS sets);
\- _beamFailureRecoveryTimer_ for the beam failure recovery procedure for
SpCell;
\- _rsrp-ThresholdSSB_ : an RSRP threshold for the SpCell beam failure
recovery;
\- _rsrp-ThresholdBFR_ : an RSRP threshold for the SCell beam failure recovery
or for the beam failure recovery of BFD-RS set of Serving Cell;
\- _powerRampingStep_ : _powerRampingStep_ for the SpCell beam failure
recovery;
\- _powerRampingStepHighPriority_ : _powerRampingStepHighPriority_ for the
SpCell beam failure recovery;
\- _preambleReceivedTargetPower_ : _preambleReceivedTargetPower_ for the
SpCell beam failure recovery;
\- _preambleTransMax_ : _preambleTransMax_ for the SpCell beam failure
recovery;
\- _scalingFactorBI_ : _scalingFactorBI_ for the SpCell beam failure recovery;
\- _ssb-perRACH-Occasion_ : _ssb-perRACH-Occasion_ for the SpCell beam failure
recovery using contention-free Random Access Resources;
\- _ra-ResponseWindow_ : the time window to monitor response(s) for the SpCell
beam failure recovery using contention-free Random Access Resources;
\- _prach-ConfigurationIndex_ : _prach-ConfigurationIndex_ for the SpCell beam
failure recovery using contention-free Random Access Resources;
\- _ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex_ : _ra-ssb-OccasionMaskIndex_ for the SpCell beam
failure recovery using contention-free Random Access Resources;
\- _ra-OccasionList_ : _ra-OccasionList_ for the SpCell beam failure recovery
using contention-free Random Access Resources;
\- _candidateBeamRSList_ : list of candidate beams for SpCell beam failure
recovery;
\- _candidateBeamRS-List-r16_ : list of candidate beams for SCell beam failure
recovery or list of candidate beams for beam failure recovery of a Serving
Cell for BFD-RS set one;
\- _candidateBeamRS-List2-r17_ : list of candidate beams for beam failure

### 5.21.1 General
The lower layer may perform an LBT procedure, see TS 37.213 [18], according to
which a transmission is not performed by lower layers if the channel is
identified as being occupied. When lower layer performs an LBT procedure
before a transmission and the transmission is not performed, an LBT failure
indication is sent to the MAC entity from lower layers. Unless otherwise
specified, when LBT procedure is performed for a transmission, actions as
specified in this specification are performed regardless of if an LBT failure
indication is received from lower layers. When LBT is not performed by the
lower layers, LBT failure indication is not received from lower layers.
### 5.21.2 LBT failure detection and recovery procedure
The MAC entity may be configured by RRC with a consistent LBT failure recovery
procedure. Consistent LBT failure is detected per UL BWP by counting LBT
failure indications, for all UL transmissions, from the lower layers to the
MAC entity.
RRC configures the following parameters in the _lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig_ :
\- _lbt-FailureInstanceMaxCount_ for the consistent LBT failure detection;
\- _lbt-FailureDetectionTimer_ for the consistent LBT failure detection;
The following UE variable is used for the consistent LBT failure detection
procedure:
\- _LBT_COUNTER (per Serving Cell)_ : counter for LBT failure indication which
is initially set to 0.
For each activated Serving Cell configured with _lbt-FailureRecoveryConfig_ ,
the MAC entity shall:
1> if LBT failure indication has been received from lower layers:
2> start or restart the _lbt-FailureDetectionTimer_ ;
2> increment _LBT_COUNTER_ by 1;
2> if _LBT_COUNTER_ >= _lbt-FailureInstanceMaxCount_ :
3> trigger consistent LBT failure for the active UL BWP in this Serving Cell;
3> if this Serving Cell is the SpCell:
4> if consistent LBT failure has been triggered in all UL BWPs configured with
PRACH occasions on same carrier in this Serving Cell:
5> indicate consistent LBT failure to upper layers.
4> else:
5> stop any ongoing Random Access procedure in this Serving Cell;
5> switch the active UL BWP to a UL BWP, on same carrier in this Serving Cell,
configured with PRACH occasion and for which consistent LBT failure has not
been triggered;
5> initiate a Random Access Procedure (as specified in clause 5.1.1).
1> if _all triggered consistent_ LBT failures are cancelled in this Serving
Cell; or

subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:
2> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the LBT
failure MAC CE.

resources can accommodate the LBT failure MAC CE plus its subheader as a
result of logical channel prioritization:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate the LBT
failure MAC CE.
2> else:
3> trigger a Scheduling Request for LBT failure MAC CE.

lower layers and this PDU includes the LBT failure MAC CE:
2> cancel all the triggered consistent LBT failure(s) in SCell(s) for which
consistent LBT failure was indicated in the transmitted LBT failure MAC CE.
1> if consistent LBT failure is triggered and not cancelled in the SpCell; and
1> if the Random Access procedure is considered successfully completed (see
clause 5.1) in the SpCell:
2> cancel all the triggered consistent LBT failure(s) in the SpCell.

NOTE 3A1: If _sl-InterUE-CoordinationScheme1_ enabling reception/transmission
of preferred resource set and non-preferred resource set is configured by RRC
and if multiple preferred resource sets are received from the same UE, it is
up to UE implementation to use one or multiple of them in its resource
(re)selection.
NOTE 3B1: If retransmission resource(s) cannot be selected by ensuring that
the resource(s) can be indicated by the time resource assignment of a prior
SCI, how to select the time and frequency resources for one or more
transmission opportunities from the available resources is left for UE
implementation by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected
â€Žresources in case that PSFCH is configured for this pool of â€Žresources.
NOTE 3B2: When the UE receives both a single preferred resource set and a
single non-preferred resource set from the same peer UE or different peer UEs,
when the UE has own sensing results, it is up to the UE implementation to use
the preferred resource set in its resource (re)selection for transmissions to
the peer UE providing the preferred resource set.
NOTE 3B3: The UE is not required to use any resource from the preferred
resource set in its resource (re-)selection if that resource is earlier than
($T_{proc,0}^{\text{SL}}$+$T_{proc,1}^{\text{SL}}$+$T_{proc,2}^{\text{SL}}$)
after the resource of Inter-UE Coordination Information transmission, where

for inter-UE Coordination Information transmission, or
$T_{proc,2}^{\text{SL}}$ is equal to $T_{proc,0}^{\text{SL}}$ when MAC CE and
SCI format 2-C are both used for Inter-UE Coordination Information
transmission. The case when $T_{proc,2}^{\text{SL}}$ is equal to
$T_{proc,0}^{\text{SL}}$ is assuming that SCI format 2-C is received. ${\
T}_{proc,0}^{\text{SL}}$ and $T_{proc,1}^{\text{SL}}$ are specified in clause
8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7].
NOTE 3B4: For Inter-UE Coordination Information triggered by an explicit
Inter-UE Coordination Request in Scheme 1, whether or not to transmit the
Inter-UE Coordination Information upon the Inter-UE Coordination Request
reception is determined by UE-A\'s implementation subject to Release-16
procedure of UL/SL prioritization, LTE SL/NR SL prioritization, and congestion
control.
NOTE 3B5**:** If configured by RRC, _sl-IUC-Explicit_ set to _enabled_ and an
SL-IUC request is received for the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2
ID pair of a unicast, MAC layer indicates to physical layer the resource
selection window, resource set type (i.e., preferred resource set), L1
priority, the number of sub-channels to be used for the PSSCH/PSCCH
transmission and the resource reservation period for preferred resource set.
If configured by RRC, _sl-IUC-Explicit_ set to _enabled_ and an SL-IUC request
is received for the Source Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID pair of a
unicast, MAC layer indicates to physical layer resource set type (i.e., non-
preferred resource set) and the resource selection window for non-preferred
resource set.
NOTE 3B6**:** If either _sl-IUC-Explicit_ or _sl-IUC-Condition_ is configured
as _enabled,_ UE considers the reception of preferred and non-preferred
resource is enabled.
NOTE 3B7: When _sl-TriggerConditionCoordInfo_ is set to value 0, for groupcast
or broadcast of Inter-UE Coordination Information triggered by a condition in
Scheme 1, which Destination Layer-2 ID (and the corresponding cast-type) a UE
selects among Destination Layer-2 IDs that are already used or interested in
NR sidelink transmission is up to the UE implementation.

retransmission(s) of the MAC PDU from the selected sidelink grant.
NOTE 3C: How the MAC entity determines the remaining PDB of SL data is left to
UE implementation.
For a selected sidelink grant, the minimum time gap between any two selected
resources comprises:
\- a time gap between the end of the last symbol of a PSSCH transmission of
the first resource and the start of the first symbol of the corresponding
PSFCH reception determined by _sl-MinTimeGapPSFCH_ and _sl-PSFCH-Period_ for
the pool of resources; and
\- a time required for PSFCH reception and processing plus sidelink
retransmission preparation including multiplexing of necessary physical
channels and any TX-RX/RX-TX switching time.
NOTE 4: How to determine the time required for PSFCH reception and processing
plus sidelink retransmission preparation is left to UE implementation.
The MAC entity shall for each PSSCH duration:
1> for each sidelink grant occurring in this PSSCH duration:
2> select a MCS table allowed in the pool of resource which is associated with
the sidelink grant;
NOTE 4a: MCS table selection is up to UE implementation if more than one MCS
table is configured.
2> if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation
mode 1:
3> select a MCS which is, if configured, within the range that is configured
by RRC between _sl-MinMCS-PSSCH_ and _sl-MaxMCS-PSSCH_ associated with the
selected MCS table included in _sl-ConfigDedicatedNR_ ;

RRC, overlapped between _sl-MinMCS-PSSCH_ and _sl-MaxMCS-PSSCH_ associated
with the selected MCS table indicated in _sl-CBR-PriorityTxConfigList_ for the
highest priority of the sidelink logical channel(s) in the MAC PDU and the CBR
measured by lower layers according to clause 5.1.27 of TS 38.215 [24] if CBR
measurement results are available or the corresponding _sl-
defaultTxConfigIndex_ configured by RRC if CBR measurement results are not
available or the corresponding _sl-DefaultCBR-PartialSensing_ configured by
RRC if partial sensing is selected and CBR measurement results are not
available, or the corresponding _sl-DefaultCBR-RandomSelection_ configured by
RRC if random selection is selected and CBR measurement results are not
available in case the _sl-TxPoolExceptional_ is not used;
3> if the MAC entity decides not to use the selected sidelink grant for the
next PSSCH duration corresponding to an initial transmission opportunity:
4> set the resource reservation interval to 0ms.
3> else:
4> set the resource reservation interval to the selected value.
NOTE 5: MCS selection is up to UE implementation if the MCS or the
corresponding range is not configured by RRC.
2> if the configured sidelink grant has been activated and this PSSCH duration
corresponds to the first PSSCH transmission opportunity within this _sl-
PeriodCG_ of the configured sidelink grant:
3> set the HARQ Process ID to the HARQ Process ID associated with this PSSCH
duration and, if available, all subsequent PSSCH duration(s) occuring in this
_sl-PeriodCG_ for the configured sidelink grant;
3> determine that this PSSCH duration is used for initial transmission;
3> flush the HARQ buffer of Sidelink process associated with the HARQ Process
ID.
2> deliver the sidelink grant, the selected MCS, and the associated HARQ
information to the Sidelink HARQ Entity for this PSSCH duration.
For configured sidelink grants, the HARQ Process ID associated with the first
slot of an SL transmission is derived from the following equation:
HARQ Process ID = [floor(CURRENT_slot / _PeriodicitySL_)] modulo _sl-NrOfHARQ-
Processes_ \ \+ _sl-HARQ-ProcID-offset_
where CURRENT_slot refers to current logical slot in the associated resource
pool, and _PeriodicitySL_ is defined in clause 5.8.3.
#### 5.22.1.2 TX resource (re-)selection check
If the TX resource (re-)selection check procedure is triggered on the selected
pool of resources for a Sidelink process according to clause 5.22.1.1, the MAC
entity shall for the Sidelink process:

a MAC PDU of any selected sidelink grant(s) are not in SL DRX Active time as
specified in clause 5.28.3 of the destination that has data to be sent; or
1> if _SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER_ = 0 and when
_SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER_ was equal to 1 the MAC entity randomly
selected, with equal probability, a value in the interval [0, 1] which is
above the probability configured by RRC in _sl-ProbResourceKeep_ ; or
1> if the pool of resources is configured or reconfigured by RRC; or
1> if there is no selected sidelink grant on the selected pool of resources;
or
1> if neither transmission nor retransmission has been performed by the MAC
entity on any resource indicated in the selected sidelink grant during the
last second; or
1> if _sl-ReselectAfter_ is configured and the number of consecutive unused
transmission opportunities on resources indicated in the selected sidelink
grant, _which is incremented by 1 when none of the resource_ s _of the
selected sidelink grant within a resource reservation interval is used,_ is
equal to _sl-ReselectAfter_ ; or
1> if the selected sidelink grant cannot accommodate a RLC SDU by using the
maximum allowed MCS configured by RRC in _sl-MaxMCS-PSSCH_ associated with the
selected MCS table and the UE selects not to segment the RLC SDU; or
NOTE 1: If the selected sidelink grant cannot accommodate the RLC SDU, it is
left for UE implementation whether to perform segmentation or sidelink
resource reselection.
1> if transmission(s) with the selected sidelink grant cannot fulfil the
remaining PDB of the data in a logical channel, and the MAC entity selects not
to perform transmission(s) corresponding to a single MAC PDU:
NOTE 2: If the remaining PDB is not met, it is left for UE implementation
whether to perform transmission(s) corresponding to single MAC PDU or sidelink
resource reselection.
NOTE 3: It is left for UE implementation whether to trigger the TX resource
(re-)selection due to the latency requirement of the MAC CE triggered
according to clause 5.22.1.7.
2> clear the selected sidelink grant associated to the Sidelink process, if
available;
2> trigger the TX resource (re-)selection.
NOTE 4: Void.
NOTE 5: Void.
#### 5.22.1.2a Re-evaluation and Pre-emption
A resource(s) of the selected sidelink grant for a MAC PDU to transmit from
multiplexing and assembly entity is re-evaluated by physical layer at _T~3~_
before the slot where the SCI indicating the resource(s) is signalled at first
time as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7].
A resource(s) of the selected sidelink grant which has been indicated by a
prior SCI for a MAC PDU to transmit from multiplexing and assembly entity
could be checked for pre-emption by physical layer at _T~3~_ before the slot
where the resource(s) is located as specified in clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214
[7].
NOTE 1: It is up to UE implementation to re-evaluate or pre-empt before \'m --
_T~3~_ \' or after \'m -- _T~3~_ \' but before \'m\'. For re-evaluation, m is

retransmissions and the remaining PDB of either SL data available in the
logical channel(s) by ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected
resources of the selected sidelink grant in case that PSFCH is configured for
this pool of resources, and that a resource can be indicated by the time
resource assignment of an SCI for a retransmission according to clause 8.3.1.1

how to select the time and frequency resources for one or more transmission
opportunities from the available resources is left for UE implementation by
ensuring the minimum time gap between any two selected â€Žresources in case that
PSFCH is configured for this pool of â€Žresources.
2> replace the removed or dropped resource(s) by the selected resource(s) for
the selected sidelink grant.

#### 5.22.1.3 Sidelink HARQ operation
##### 5.22.1.3.1 Sidelink HARQ Entity
The MAC entity includes at most one Sidelink HARQ entity for transmission on
SL-SCH, which maintains a number of parallel Sidelink processes.
The maximum number of transmitting Sidelink processes associated with the
Sidelink HARQ Entity is 16. A sidelink process may be configured for
transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs. For transmissions of multiple MAC PDUs
with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2, the maximum number of transmitting
Sidelink processes associated with the Sidelink HARQ Entity is 4.
A delivered sidelink grant and its associated Sidelink transmission
information are associated with a Sidelink process. Each Sidelink process
supports one TB.
For each sidelink grant, the Sidelink HARQ Entity shall:
1> if the MAC entity determines that the sidelink grant is used for initial
transmission as specified in clause 5.22.1.1; or
1> if the sidelink grant is a configured sidelink grant and no MAC PDU has
been obtained in an _sl-PeriodCG_ of the configured sidelink grant; or
1> if the sidelink grant is a dynamic sidelink grant or selected sidelink
grant and no MAC PDU has been obtained in the previous sidelink grant when
PSCCH duration(s) and 2^nd^ stage SCI on PSSCH of the previous sidelink grant
is not in SL DRX Active time as specified in clause 5.28.3 of any destination
that has data to be sent:
NOTE 1: Void.
2> (re-)associate a Sidelink process to this grant, and for the associated
Sidelink process:
2> if all PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) for initial transmission of
a MAC PDU of the dynamic sidelink grant or the configured sidelink grant is
not in SL DRX Active time as specified in clause 5.28.3 of the destination
that has data to be sent:
3> ignore the sidelink grant.
NOTE 1A: The Sidelink HARQ Entity will associate the selected sidelink grant
to the Sidelink process determined by the MAC entity.
2> else:
3> obtain the MAC PDU to transmit from the Multiplexing and assembly entity,
if any;
3> if a MAC PDU to transmit has been obtained:
4> if a HARQ Process ID has been set for the sidelink grant:
5> (re-)associate the HARQ Process ID corresponding to the sidelink grant to
the Sidelink process.
NOTE 1a: There is one-to-one mapping between a HARQ Process ID and a Sidelink
process in the MAC entity configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 1.
4> determines Sidelink transmission information of the TB for the source and
destination pair of the MAC PDU as follows:
5> set the Source Layer-1 ID to the 8 LSB of the Source Layer-2 ID of the MAC
PDU;
5> set the Destination Layer-1 ID to the 16 LSB of the Destination Layer-2 ID
of the MAC PDU;
5> (re-)associate the Sidelink process to a Sidelink process ID;
NOTE 1b: How UE determine Sidelink process ID in SCI is left to UE
implementation for NR sidelink.
5> consider the NDI to have been toggled compared to the value of the previous
transmission corresponding to the Sidelink identification information and the
Sidelink process ID of the MAC PDU and set the NDI to the toggled value;
NOTE 2: The initial value of the NDI set to the very first transmission for
the associated Sidelink process is left to UE implementation.
NOTE 3: Void.
5> if the MAC PDU is for NR sidelink discovery:
6> set the cast type indicator to broadcast.
5> else:
6> set the cast type indicator to one of broadcast, groupcast and unicast as
indicated by upper layers.
5> if HARQ feedback has been enabled for the MAC PDU according to clause
5.22.1.4.2;
6> set the HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator to _enabled_.
5> else:
6> set the HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator to _disabled_.
5> set the priority to the value of the highest priority of the logical
channel(s), if any, and MAC CE(s), if included, in the MAC PDU;
NOTE 3A: When determining Sidelink transmission information, the priority of
the Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information MAC CE is the value configured
in RRC parameters _sl-PriorityCoordInfoCondition_ when triggered by a
condition, or _sl-PriorityCoordInfoExplicit_ when triggered by an explicit
request. When determining Sidelink transmission information, the priority of
the Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE is the value configured in
RRC parameter _sl-PriorityRequest_. When determining Sidelink transmission
information, the priority of the Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information
MAC CE is the value indicated in Priority field in the Sidelink Inter-UE
Coordination Request MAC CE provided by the UE when triggered by an explicit
request, if _sl-PriorityCoordInfoExplicit-r17_ is not configured. When
determining Sidelink transmission information for performing sensing and
candidate resource selections in PHY, the priority value of the Sidelink
Inter-UE Coordination Information MAC CE triggered under a condition is up to
UE implementation, if _sl-PriorityCoordInfoCondition-r17_ is not configured.
When determining Sidelink transmission information for performing sensing and
candidate resource selections in PHY, the priority value of Sidelink Inter-UE
Coordination Request MAC CE is the same as that of a TB to be transmitted by
the UE, if _sl-PriorityRequest-r17_ is not configured.
5> if HARQ feedback is enabled for groupcast:
6> if both a group size and a member ID are provided by upper layers and the
group size is not greater than the number of candidate PSFCH resources
associated with this sidelink grant:

5> set the Redundancy version to the selected value.
4> deliver the MAC PDU, the sidelink grant and the Sidelink transmission
information of the TB to the associated Sidelink process;
4> instruct the associated Sidelink process to trigger a new transmission.
3> else:
4> flush the HARQ buffer of the associated Sidelink process.
1> else (i.e. retransmission):
2> if the HARQ Process ID corresponding to the sidelink grant received on
PDCCH, the configured sidelink grant or the selected sidelink grant is
associated to a Sidelink process of which HARQ buffer is empty; or
2> if the HARQ Process ID corresponding to the sidelink grant received on
PDCCH is not associated to any Sidelink process; or
2> if PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) for one or more retransmissions
of a MAC PDU of the dynamic sidelink grant or the configured sidelink grant is
not in SL DRX Active time as specified in clause 5.28.3 of the destination
that has data to be sent:
3> ignore the sidelink grant.
2> else:
3> identify the Sidelink process associated with this grant, and for the
associated Sidelink process:
4> deliver the sidelink grant of the MAC PDU to the associated Sidelink
process;
4> instruct the associated Sidelink process to trigger a retransmission.
##### 5.22.1.3.1a Sidelink process
The Sidelink process is associated with a HARQ buffer.
New transmissions and retransmissions are performed on the resource indicated
in the sidelink grant as specified in clause 5.22.1.1 and with the MCS
selected as specified in clause 8.1.3.1 of TS 38.214 [7] and clause 5.22.1.1.
If the Sidelink process is configured to perform transmissions of multiple MAC
PDUs with Sidelink resource allocation mode 2, the process maintains a counter
_SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER_. For other configurations of the Sidelink
process, this counter is not available.
Priority of a MAC PDU is determined by the highest priority of the logical
channel(s) or MAC CE(s) in the MAC PDU.
If the Sidelink HARQ Entity requests a new transmission, the Sidelink process
shall:
1> store the MAC PDU in the associated HARQ buffer;
1> store the sidelink grant received from the Sidelink HARQ Entity;
1> generate a transmission as described below.
If the Sidelink HARQ Entity requests a retransmission, the Sidelink process
shall:
1> store the sidelink grant received from the Sidelink HARQ Entity;
1> generate a transmission as described below.
To generate a transmission, the Sidelink process shall:
1> if there is no uplink transmission; or
1> if the MAC entity is able to simultaneously perform uplink transmission(s)
and sidelink transmission at the time of the transmission; or
1> if the other MAC entity and the MAC entity are able to simultaneously
perform uplink transmission(s) and sidelink transmission at the time of the
transmission respectively; or
1> if there is a MAC PDU to be transmitted for this duration in uplink, except
a MAC PDU obtained from the Msg3 buffer, the MSGA buffer, or prioritized as
specified in clause 5.4.2.2, and the sidelink transmission is prioritized over
uplink transmission:
2> instruct the physical layer to transmit SCI according to the stored
sidelink grant with the associated Sidelink transmission information;
2> instruct the physical layer to generate a transmission according to the
stored sidelink grant;
2> if HARQ feedback has been enabled for the MAC PDU according to clause
5.22.1.4.2:
3> instruct the physical layer to monitor PSFCH for the transmission and
perform PSFCH reception as specified in clause 5.22.1.3.2.
2> if _sl-PUCCH-Config_ is configured by RRC for the stored sidelink grant:
3> determine transmission of an acknowledgement on the PUCCH as specified in
clause 5.22.1.3.2.
1> if this transmission corresponds to the last transmission of the MAC PDU:
2> decrement _SL_RESOURCE_RESELECTION_COUNTER_ by 1, if available.
NOTE 1: If the number of HARQ retransmissions selected by the MAC entity has
been reached, or if a positive acknowledgement to a transmission of the MAC
PDU has been received, or if a negative-only acknowledgement was enabled in
the SCI and no negative acknowledgement was received for the transmission of
the MAC PDU, the MAC entity determines this transmission corresponds to the
last transmission of the MAC PDU for Sidelink resource allocation mode 2. How
to determine the last transmission in other cases is up to UE implementation.
1> if _sl-MaxTransNum_ corresponding to the highest priority of the logical
channel(s) in the MAC PDU has been configured in _sl-CG-MaxTransNumList_ for
the sidelink grant by RRC and the number of transmissions of the MAC PDU has
been reached to _sl-MaxTransNum_ ; or
1> if a positive acknowledgement to this transmission of the MAC PDU was
received according to clause 5.22.1.3.2; or
1> if negative-only acknowledgement was enabled in the SCI and no negative
acknowledgement was received for this transmission of the MAC PDU according to
clause 5.22.1.3.2:
2> flush the HARQ buffer of the associated Sidelink process.
The transmission of the MAC PDU is prioritized over uplink transmission(s) of
the MAC entity or the other MAC entity if the following conditions are met:
1> if the MAC entity is not able to perform this sidelink transmission
simultaneously with all uplink transmission(s) at the time of the
transmission, and
1> if none of the uplink transmission(s) is prioritized by upper layer
according to TS 23.287 [19], and
1> if none of the NR uplink MAC PDU(s) includes any MAC CE prioritized as
described in clause 5.4.3.1.3, and
1> if _ul-PrioritizationThres_ is configured and if the value of the highest
priority of logical channel(s) of all the NR uplink transmission(s) is not
lower than _ul-PrioritizationThres_ , and
1> if _sl-PrioritizationThres_ is configured and if the value of the highest
priority of logical channel(s) or MAC CE(s) in the MAC PDU is lower than _sl-
PrioritizationThres_.
NOTE 2: If the MAC entity is not able to perform this sidelink transmission
simultaneously with all uplink transmissions as specified in clause 5.4.2.2 of
TS 36.321 [22] at the time of the transmission, and prioritization-related
information is not available prior to the time of this sidelink transmission
due to processing time restriction, it is up to UE implementation whether this
sidelink transmission is performed.
##### 5.22.1.3.2 PSFCH reception
The MAC entity shall for each PSSCH transmission:
1> if an acknowledgement corresponding to the PSSCH transmission in clause
5.22.1.3.1a is obtained from the physical layer:
2> deliver the acknowledgement to the corresponding Sidelink HARQ entity for
the Sidelink process;
1> else:
2> deliver a negative acknowledgement to the corresponding Sidelink HARQ
entity for the Sidelink process;
1> if the PSSCH transmission occurs for a pair of Source Layer-2 ID and
Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to a PC5-RRC connection which has been
established by upper layers:
2> perform the HARQ-Based Sidelink RLF Detection procedure as specified in
clause 5.22.1.3.3.
If _sl-PUCCH-Config_ is configured by RRC, the MAC entity shall for a PUCCH
transmission occasion:
1> if the _timeAlignmentTimer_ , associated with the TAG containing the
Serving Cell on which the HARQ feedback is to be transmitted, is stopped or
expired:
2> not instruct the physical layer to generate acknowledgement(s) of the data
in this TB.
1> else if a MAC PDU has been obtained for a sidelink grant associated to the
PUCCH transmission occasion in clause 5.22.1.3.1, the MAC entity shall:
2> if the most recent transmission of the MAC PDU was not prioritized as
specified in clause 5.22.1.3.1a:
3> instruct the physical layer to signal a negative acknowledgement on the
PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [6].
2> else if HARQ feedback has been disabled for the MAC PDU and next
retransmission(s) of the MAC PDU is not required; or
2> else if all PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) for initial
transmission of a MAC PDU of the dynamic sidelink grant or the configured
sidelink grant is not in SL DRX Active time as specified in clause 5.28.3 of
any destination that has data to be sent:
3> instruct the physical layer to signal a positive acknowledgement
corresponding to the transmission on the PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS
38.213 [6].
2> else if HARQ feedback has been disabled for the MAC PDU, and no sidelink
grant is available for next retransmission(s) of the MAC PDU (including
immediately after all PSSCH duration(s) in an _sl-PeriodCG_ for the sidelink
grant, the number of transmissions of the MAC PDU has not reached _sl-
MaxTransNum_ corresponding to the highest priority of the logical channel(s)
in the MAC PDU, if configured in _sl-CG-MaxTransNumList_ for the sidelink
grant by RRC), if any; or
2> else if PSCCH duration(s) and PSSCH duration(s) for one or more
retransmissions of a MAC PDU of the dynamic sidelink grant or the configured
sidelink grant is not in SL DRX Active time as specified in clause 5.28.3 of
the destination that has data to be sent:

PUCCH according to clause 16.5 of TS 38.213 [6].
##### 5.22.1.3.3 HARQ-based Sidelink RLF detection
The HARQ-based Sidelink RLF detection procedure is used to detect Sidelink RLF
based on a number of consecutive DTX on PSFCH reception occasions for a
PC5-RRC connection.
RRC configures the following parameter to control HARQ-based Sidelink RLF
detection:
\- _sl-maxNumConsecutiveDTX_.
The following UE variable is used for HARQ-based Sidelink RLF detection.
\- _numConsecutiveDTX_ , which is maintained for each PC5-RRC connection.
The Sidelink HARQ Entity shall (re-)initialize _numConsecutiveDTX_ to zero for
each PC5-RRC connection which has been established by upper layers, if any,
upon establishment of the PC5-RRC connection or (re)configuration of _sl-
maxNumConsecutiveDTX_.
The Sidelink HARQ Entity shall for each PSFCH reception occasion associated to
the PSSCH transmission:
1> if **PSFCH reception is absent on the PSFCH reception occasion** :
2> increment _numConsecutiveDTX_ by 1;
2> if _numConsecutiveDTX_ reaches _sl-maxNumConsecutiveDTX_ :
3> indicate HARQ-based Sidelink RLF detection to RRC.
1> else:
2> re-initialize _numConsecutiveDTX_ to zero.
#### 5.22.1.4 Multiplexing and assembly
##### 5.22.1.4.0 General
For PDU(s) associated with one SCI, MAC shall consider only logical channels
with the same Source Layer-2 ID-Destination Layer-2 ID pair for one of
unicast, groupcast and broadcast which is associated with the pair. Multiple
transmissions for different Sidelink processes are allowed to be independently
performed in different PSSCH durations.
> NOTE: Sidelink data for discovery and sidelink data for non-discovery
> transmitted by a UE cannot be multiplexed into the same TB because they are
> always associated with different destination L2 IDs (see TS 23.304 [26]).
##### 5.22.1.4.1 Logical channel prioritization
###### 5.22.1.4.1.1 General
The sidelink Logical Channel Prioritization procedure is applied whenever a
new transmission is performed.
RRC controls the scheduling of sidelink data by signalling for each logical
channel:
\- _sl-Priority_ where an increasing priority value indicates a lower priority
level;
\- _sl-PrioritisedBitRate_ which sets the sidelink Prioritized Bit Rate
(sPBR);
\- _sl-BucketSizeDuration_ which sets the sidelink Bucket Size Duration
(sBSD).
RRC additionally controls the LCP procedure by configuring mapping
restrictions for each logical channel:
\- _sl-configuredGrantType1Allowed_ which sets whether a configured grant Type
1 can be used for sidelink transmission;
\- _sl-AllowedCG-List_ which sets the allowed configured grant(s) for sidelink
transmission;
\- _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ which sets whether the logical channel is allowed
to be multiplexed with logical channel(s) with _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ set
to _enabled_ or _disabled_.
The following UE variable is used for the Logical channel prioritization
procedure:
\- _SBj_ which is maintained for each logical channel _j_.
The MAC entity shall initialize _SBj_ of the logical channel to zero when the
logical channel is established.
For each logical channel _j_ , the MAC entity shall:
1> increment _SBj_ by the product sPBR Ã— T before every instance of the LCP
procedure, where T is the time elapsed since _SBj_ was last incremented;
1> if the value of _SBj_ is greater than the sidelink bucket size (i.e. sPBR Ã—
sBSD):
2> set _SBj_ to the sidelink bucket size.
NOTE: The exact moment(s) when the UE updates _SBj_ between LCP procedures is
up to UE implementation, as long as _SBj_ is up to date at the time when a
grant is processed by LCP.
###### 5.22.1.4.1.2 Selection of logical channels
The MAC entity shall for each SCI corresponding to a new transmission:
1> if _sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfig_ or _sl-BWP-DiscPoolConfigCommon_ is configured
according to TS 38.331 [5]:
2> if the new transmission is associated to a sidelink grant in _sl-
DiscTxPoolSelected or sl-DiscTxPoolScheduling_ configured in _sl-BWP-

least one of the MAC CE and the logical channel with the highest priority,
among the logical channels that satisfy all the following conditions and MAC
CE(s), if any, for the SL grant associated to the SCI:

3> _SBj_ > 0, in case there is any logical channel having _SBj_ > 0; and
3> _sl-configuredGrantType1Allowed_ , if configured, is set to _true_ in case
the SL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and
3> _sl-AllowedCG-List_ , if configured, includes the configured grant index
associated to the SL grant; and
3> _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ is set to _disabled_ , if PSFCH is not configured
for the SL grant associated to the SCI.
NOTE 1: If multiple Destinations have the logical channels satisfying all
conditions above with the same highest priority or if multiple Destinations
have either the MAC CE and/or the logical channels satisfying all conditions
above with the same priority as the MAC CE, which Destination is selected
among them is up to UE implementation.
1> select the logical channels satisfying all the following conditions among
the logical channels belonging to the selected Destination:
2> SL data is available for transmission; and
2> _sl-configuredGrantType1Allowed_ , if configured, is set to _true_ in case
the SL grant is a Configured Grant Type 1; and.
2> _sl-AllowedCG-List_ , if configured, includes the configured grant index
associated to the SL grant; and
2> _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ is set to the value that satisfies the following
conditions:
3> if PSFCH is configured for the sidelink grant associated to the SCI and the
UE is capable of PSFCH reception:
4> _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ is set to _enabled_ , if _sl-HARQ-
FeedbackEnabled_ is set to _enabled_ for the highest priority logical channel
satisfying the above conditions; or
4> _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ is set to _disabled_ , if _sl-HARQ-
FeedbackEnabled_ is set to _disabled_ for the highest priority logical channel
satisfying the above conditions.
3> else:
4> _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ is set to disabled.
NOTE 2: HARQ feedback enabled/disabled indicator is set to disabled for the
transmission of a MAC PDU only carrying CSI reporting MAC CE or Sidelink DRX
Command MAC CE or Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE or Sidelink
Inter-UE Coordination Information MAC CE.
###### 5.22.1.4.1.3 Allocation of sidelink resources
The MAC entity shall for each SCI corresponding to a new transmission:
1> allocate resources to the logical channels as follows:
2> logical channels selected in clause 5.22.1.4.1.2 for the SL grant with
_SBj_ > 0 are allocated resources in a decreasing priority order. If the sPBR
of a logical channel is set to _infinity_ , the MAC entity shall allocate
resources for all the data that is available for transmission on the logical
channel before meeting the sPBR of the lower priority logical channel(s);
2> decrement _SBj_ by the total size of MAC SDUs served to logical channel _j_
above;
2> if any resources remain, all the logical channels selected in clause
5.22.1.4.1.2 are served in a strict decreasing priority order (regardless of
the value of _SBj_) until either the data for that logical channel or the SL
grant is exhausted, whichever comes first. Logical channels configured with
equal priority should be served equally.
NOTE 1: The value of _SBj_ can be negative.
The UE shall also follow the rules below during the SL scheduling procedures
above:
\- the UE should not segment an RLC SDU (or partially transmitted SDU or
retransmitted RLC PDU) if the whole SDU (or partially transmitted SDU or
retransmitted RLC PDU) fits into the remaining resources of the associated MAC
entity;
\- if the UE segments an RLC SDU from the logical channel, it shall maximize
the size of the segment to fill the grant of the associated MAC entity as much
as possible;
\- the UE should maximise the transmission of data;
\- if the MAC entity is given a sidelink grant size that is equal to or larger
than 12 bytes while having data available and allowed (according to clause
5.22.1.4.1) for transmission, the MAC entity shall not transmit only padding;
\- A logical channel configured with _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ set to
_enabled_ and a logical channel configured with _sl-HARQ-FeedbackEnabled_ set
to _disabled_ cannot be multiplexed into the same MAC PDU.
The MAC entity shall not generate a MAC PDU for the HARQ entity if the
following conditions are satisfied:
\- there is no Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE generated for this PSSCH
transmission as specified in clause 5.22.1.7; and
\- there is no Sidelink DRX Command MAC CE generated for this PSSCH
transmission as specified in clause 5.22.1.8; and
\- there is no Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE generated for
this PSSCH transmission as specified in clause 5.22.1.9; and
\- there is no Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information MAC CE generated for
this PSSCH transmission as specified in clause 5.22.1.10; and
\- the MAC PDU includes zero MAC SDUs.
Logical channels shall be prioritised in accordance with the following order
(highest priority listed first):
\- data from SCCH;
\- Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE;
\- Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE and Sidelink Inter-UE
Coordination Information MAC CE;
\- Sidelink DRX Command MAC CE;
\- data from any STCH.
NOTE 2: The priority order between Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC
CE and Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information MAC CE is up to UE
implementation.
##### 5.22.1.4.2 Multiplexing of MAC Control Elements and MAC SDUs
The MAC entity shall multiplex MAC CEs and MAC SDUs in a MAC PDU according to
clauses 5.22.1.4.1 and 6.1.6.
#### 5.22.1.5 Scheduling Request
In addition to clause 5.4.4, the Scheduling Request (SR) is also used for
requesting SL-SCH resources for new transmission when triggered by the
Sidelink BSR (clause 5.22.1.6) or the SL-CSI reporting (clause 5.22.1.7) or
SL-DRX Command indication. If configured, the MAC entity performs the SR
procedure as specified in this clause unless otherwise specified in clause
5.4.4. For a sidelink logical channel or for SL-CSI reporting or for SL-DRX
Command indication, at most one PUCCH resource for SR is configured per UL
BWP.
The SR configuration of the logical channel that triggered the Sidelink BSR
(clause 5.22.1.6) is also considered as corresponding SR configuration for the
triggered SR (clause 5.4.4). The value of the priority of the triggered SR
corresponds to the value of priority of the logical channel that triggered the
SR.
Each sidelink logical channel may be mapped to zero or one SR configuration,
which is configured by RRC. If the SL-CSI reporting procedure is enabled by
RRC, the SL-CSI reporting is mapped to one SR configuration for all PC5-RRC
connections. The SR configuration of the SL-CSI reporting triggered according
to 5.22.1.7 is considered as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered
SR (clause 5.4.4). The value of the priority of the triggered SR triggered by
SL-CSI reporting corresponds to the value of the priority of the Sidelink CSI
Reporting MAC CE. The SR configuration of the SL-CSI reporting is considered
as corresponding SR configuration for the triggered SR of SL-DRX Command
indication triggered according to 5.28.3. The value of the priority of the
triggered SR triggered by SL-DRX Command indication corresponds to the value
of the priority of the Sidelink DRX Command MAC CE.
All pending SR(s) triggered according to the Sidelink BSR procedure (clause
5.22.1.6) prior to the MAC PDU assembly shall be cancelled and each respective
_sr-ProhibitTimer_ shall be stopped when the MAC PDU is transmitted and this
PDU includes an SL-BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and
including) the last event that triggered a Sidelink BSR (see clause 5.22.1.4)
prior to the MAC PDU assembly.
All pending SR(s) triggered according to the Sidelink BSR procedure (clause
5.22.1.6) shall be cancelled and each respective _sr-ProhibitTimer_ shall be
stopped when the SL grant(s) can accommodate all pending data available for
transmission in sidelink.
The pending SR triggered according to the SL-CSI reporting for a destination
shall be cancelled and each respective _sr-ProhibitTimer_ shall be stopped
when the SL grant(s) can accommodate the Sidelink CSI Reporting MAC CE when
the SL-CSI reporting that has been triggered but not cancelled or when the
triggered SL-CSI reporting is cancelled due to latency non-fulfilment as
specified in 5.22.1.7. The pending SR triggered according to the SL-DRX
Command indication for a destination shall be cancelled and each respective
_sr-ProhibitTimer_ shall be stopped when the SL grant(s) can accommodate the
Sidelink DRX Command MAC CE when the SL-DRX Command indication that has been
triggered but not cancelled. All pending SR(s) triggered by either Sidelink
BSR or Sidelink CSI report or Sidelink DRX Command indication shall be
cancelled, when RRC configures Sidelink resource allocation mode 2.
#### 5.22.1.6 Buffer Status Reporting
The Sidelink Buffer Status reporting (SL-BSR) procedure is used to provide the
serving gNB with information about SL data volume in the MAC entity.
RRC configures the following parameters to control the SL-BSR:
\- _sl-periodicBSR-Timer_ , configured by _periodicBSR-Timer_ in _sl-BSR-
Config_ ;
\- _sl-retxBSR-Timer_ , configured by _retxBSR-Timer_ in _sl-BSR-Config_ ;
\- _sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied_ ;
\- _sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_ , configured by _logicalChannelSR-
DelayTimer_ in _sl-BSR-Config_ ;
\- _sl-logicalChannelGroup_.
Each logical channel which belongs to a Destination is allocated to an LCG as
specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The maximum number of LCGs is eight.
The MAC entity determines the amount of SL data available for a logical
channel according to the data volume calculation procedure in TSs 38.322 [3]
and 38.323 [4].
An SL-BSR shall be triggered if any of the following events occur:
1> if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource allocation
mode 1:
2> SL data, for a logical channel which belongs to an LCG of a Destination,
becomes available to the MAC entity; and either
3> this SL data belongs to a logical channel with higher priority than the
priorities of the logical channels containing available SL data which belong
to any LCG belonging to the same Destination; or
3> none of the logical channels which belong to an LCG belonging to the same
Destination contains any available SL data.
in which case the SL-BSR is referred below to as \'Regular SL-BSR\';
2> UL resources are allocated and number of padding bits remaining after a
Padding BSR has been triggered is equal to or larger than the size of the SL-
BSR MAC CE plus its subheader, in which case the SL-BSR is referred below to
as \'Padding SL-BSR\';
2> _sl-retxBSR-Timer_ expires, and at least one of the logical channels which
belong to an LCG contains SL data, in which case the SL-BSR is referred below
to as \'Regular SL-BSR\';
2> _sl-periodicBSR-Timer_ expires, in which case the SL-BSR is referred below
to as \'Periodic SL-BSR\'.
1> else:
2> Sidelink resource allocation mode 1 is configured by RRC and SL data is
available for transmission in the RLC entity or in the PDCP entity, in which
case the Sidelink BSR is referred below to as \'Regular SL-BSR\'.
For Regular SL-BSR, the MAC entity shall:
1> if the SL-BSR is triggered for a logical channel for which _sl-
logicalChannelSR-DelayTimerApplied_ with value _true_ is configured by RRC:
2> start or restart the _sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_.
1> else:
2> if running, stop the _sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_.
For Regular and Periodic SL-BSR, the MAC entity shall:
1> if _sl-PrioritizationThres_ is configured and the value of the highest
priority of the logical channels that belong to any LCG and contain SL data
for any Destination is lower than _sl-PrioritizationThres_ ; and
1> if _ul-PrioritizationThres_ is configured and the value of the highest
priority of the logical channels that belong to any LCG and contain UL data is
equal to or higher than _ul-PrioritizationThres_ according to clause 5.4.5:
2> prioritize the LCG(s) for the Destination(s).
1> if the Buffer Status reporting procedure determines that at least one BSR
has been triggered and not cancelled according to clause 5.4.5 and the UL
grant cannot accommodate an SL-BSR MAC CE containing buffer status only for
all prioritized LCGs having data available for transmission plus the subheader
of the SL-BSR according to clause 5.4.3.1.3, in case the SL-BSR is considered
as not prioritized:
2> prioritize the SL-BSR for logical channel prioritization specified in
clause 5.4.3.1;
2> report Truncated SL-BSR containing buffer status for as many prioritized
LCGs having data available for transmission as possible, taking the number of
bits in the UL grant into consideration.
1> else if the number of bits in the UL grant is expected to be equal to or
larger than the size of an SL-BSR containing buffer status for all LCGs having
data available for transmission plus the subheader of the SL-BSR according to
clause 5.4.3.1.3:
2> report SL-BSR containing buffer status for all LCGs having data available
for transmission.
1> else:
2> report Truncated SL-BSR containing buffer status for as many LCGs having
data available for transmission as possible, taking the number of bits in the
UL grant into consideration.
For Padding SL-BSR:
1> if the number of padding bits remaining after a Padding BSR has been
triggered is equal to or larger than the size of an SL-BSR containing buffer
status for all LCGs having data available for transmission plus its subheader:
2> report SL-BSR containing buffer status for all LCGs having data available
for transmission;
1> else:
2> report Truncated SL-BSR containing buffer status for as many LCGs having
data available for transmission as possible, taking the number of bits in the
UL grant into consideration.
For SL-BSR triggered by _sl-retxBSR-Timer_ expiry, the MAC entity considers
that the logical channel that triggered the SL-BSR is the highest priority
logical channel that has data available for transmission at the time the SL-
BSR is triggered.
The MAC entity shall:
1> if the sidelink Buffer Status reporting procedure determines that at least
one SL-BSR has been triggered and not cancelled:
2> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH
resources can accommodate the SL-BSR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result of
logical channel prioritization according to clause 5.4.3.1:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure in clause 5.4.3 to
generate the SL-BSR MAC CE(s);
3> start or restart _sl-periodicBSR-Timer_ except when all the generated SL-
BSRs are Truncated SL-BSRs;
3> start or restart _sl-retxBSR-Timer_.
2> if a Regular SL-BSR has been triggered and _sl-logicalChannelSR-DelayTimer_
is not running:
3> if there is no UL-SCH resource available for a new transmission; or
3> if UL-SCH resources are available for a new transmission and the UL-SCH
resources cannot accommodate the SL-BSR MAC CE plus its subheader as a result
of logical channel prioritization according to clause 5.4.3.1; or
3> if the set of Subcarrier Spacing index values in _sl-AllowedSCS-List_ , if
configured for the logical channel that triggered the SL-BSR, does not include
the Subcarrier Spacing index associated to the UL-SCH resources available for
a new transmission; or
3> if _sl-MaxPUSCH-Duration_ , if configured for the logical channel that
triggered the SL-BSR, is smaller than the PUSCH transmission duration
associated to the UL-SCH resources available for a new transmission:
4> trigger a Scheduling Request.
NOTE 1: UL-SCH resources are considered available if the MAC entity has been
configured with, receives, or determines an uplink grant. If the MAC entity
has determined at a given point in time that UL-SCH resources are available,
this need not imply that UL-SCH resources are available for use at that point
in time.
A MAC PDU shall contain at most one SL-BSR MAC CE, even when multiple events
have triggered an SL-BSR. The Regular SL-BSR and the Periodic SL-BSR shall
have precedence over the padding SL-BSR.
The MAC entity shall restart _sl-retxBSR-Timer_ upon reception of an SL grant
for transmission of new data on any SL-SCH.
All triggered SL-BSRs may be cancelled when the SL grant(s) can accommodate
all pending data available for transmission. All BSRs triggered prior to MAC
PDU assembly shall be cancelled when a MAC PDU is transmitted and this PDU
includes an SL-BSR MAC CE which contains buffer status up to (and including)
the last event that triggered an SL-BSR prior to the MAC PDU assembly. All
triggered SL-BSRs shall be cancelled, and _sl-retx-BSR-Timer_ and _sl-
periodic-BSR-Timer_ shall be stopped, when RRC configures Sidelink resource
allocation mode 2.
NOTE 2: MAC PDU assembly can happen at any point in time between uplink grant
reception and actual transmission of the corresponding MAC PDU. SL-BSR and SR
can be triggered after the assembly of a MAC PDU which contains an SL-BSR MAC
CE, but before the transmission of this MAC PDU. In addition, SL-BSR and SR
can be triggered during MAC PDU assembly.
#### 5.22.1.7 CSI Reporting
The Sidelink Channel State Information (SL-CSI) reporting procedure is used to
provide a peer UE with sidelink channel state information as specified in
clause 8.5 of TS 38.214 [7].
RRC configures the following parameters to control the SL-CSI reporting
procedure:
\- _sl-LatencyBoundCSI-Report_ , which is maintained for each PC5-RRC
connection.
The MAC entity maintains an _sl-CSI-ReportTimer_ for each pair of the Source
Layer-2 ID and the Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to a PC5-RRC
connection. _sl-CSI-ReportTimer_ is used for an SL-CSI reporting UE to follow
the latency requirement signalled from a CSI triggering UE. The value of _sl-
CSI-ReportTimer_ is the same as theâ€Ž latency requirement of the SL-CSI
reporting in _sl-LatencyBoundCSI-Report_ configured by RRC.
The MAC entity shall for each pair of the Source Layer-2 ID and the
Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to a PC5-RRC connection which has been
established by upper layers:
1> if the SL-CSI reporting has been triggered by an SCI and not cancelled:
2> if the _sl-CSI-ReportTimer_ for the triggered SL-CSI reporting is not
running:
3> start the _sl-CSI-ReportTimer_.
2> if the _sl-CSI-ReportTimer_ for the triggered SL-CSI reporting expires:
3> cancel the triggered SL-CSI reporting.
2> else if the MAC entity has SL resources allocated for new transmission and
the SL-SCH resources can accommodate the SL-CSI reporting MAC CE and its
subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Sidelink CSI
Reporting MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.35;
3> stop the _sl-CSI-ReportTimer_ for the triggered SL-CSI reporting;
3> cancel the triggered SL-CSI reporting.
2> else if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource
allocation mode 1:
3> trigger a Scheduling Request.
NOTE: The MAC entity configured with Sidelink resource allocation mode 1 may
trigger a Scheduling Request if transmission of a pending SL-CSI reporting
with the sidelink grant(s) cannot fulfil the latency requirement associated to
the SL-CSI reporting.
#### 5.22.1.8 Void
#### 5.22.1.9 IUC-Request transmission
The Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Request transmission procedure is used to
trigger a peer UE to transmit Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information as
specified in clause 8.4.1.3 of TS 38.212 [9].
#### 5.22.1.10 IUC-Information Reporting
##### 5.22.1.10.1 General
The Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Information reporting procedure is used to
provide a peer UE with inter-UE coordination information as specified in
clause 8.1.4 of TS 38.214 [7]. The Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination reporting
procedure can be triggered by Sidelink Inter-UE Coordination Request MAC CE or
condition (See TS 38.331 [5] and TS 38.214 [7]). Unicast for preferred
resource set and non-preferred resource set and Groupcast/Broadcast for non-
preferred resource set are supported for inter-UE coordination information
transmission triggered by a condition other than explicit request reception.
RRC configures the following parameter to control the SL-IUC Information
reporting procedure:
\- _sl-LatencyBoundIUC-Report_ , which is maintained for each PC5-RRC
connection.
The MAC entity maintains an _sl-IUC-ReportTimer_ for each pair of the Source
Layer-2 ID and the Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to a PC5-RRC
connection. _sl-IUC-ReportTimer_ is used for an SL-IUC Information reporting
UE to follow the latency requirement signalled from an IUC-Information
triggering UE. The value of _sl-IUC-ReportTimer_ is the same as theâ€Ž latency
requirement of the SL-IUC Information in _sl-LatencyBoundIUC-Report_
configured by RRC.
The MAC entity shall for each pair of the Source Layer-2 ID and the
Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to a PC5-RRC connection which has been
established by upper layers:
1> if the SL-IUC Information reporting has been triggered by an SL-IUC Request
MAC CE (and/or an SCI) and not cancelled:
2> if the _sl-IUC-ReportTimer_ for the triggered SL-IUC Information reporting
is not running:
3> start the _sl-IUC-ReportTimer_.
2> if the _sl-IUC-ReportTimer_ for the triggered SL-IUC Information reporting
expires:
3> cancel the triggered SL-IUC Information reporting.
2> else if the MAC entity has SL resources allocated for new transmission and
the SL-SCH resources can accommodate the SL-IUC Information MAC CE and its
subheader as a result of logical channel prioritization:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Sidelink
Inter-UE Coordination Information MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.53;
3> stop the _sl-IUC-ReportTimer_ for the triggered SL-IUC Information
reporting;
3> cancel the triggered SL-IUC Information reporting.
##### 5.22.1.10.2 Reception of IUC-Information Reporting
Upon the reception of SL-IUC Information MAC CE from another UE, the MAC
entity shall:
1> if _sl-InterUE-CoordinationScheme1_ enabling reception/transmission of
preferred resource set and non-preferred resource set is configured by RRC:
2> if the SL-IUC Information MAC CE contains a non-preferred resource set and
if the UE is configured to use full sensing or partial sensing in the resource
pool where the non-preferred resource set is located:
3> indicate the received non-preferred resource set to physical layer.
### 5.22.2 SL-SCH Data reception
#### 5.22.2.1 SCI reception
SCI indicates if there is a transmission on SL-SCH and provide the relevant
HARQ information. An SCI consists of two parts: the 1^st^ stage SCI on PSCCH
and the 2^nd^ stage SCI on PSSCH as specified in clause 8.1 of TS 38.214 [7].
The MAC entity shall:
1> for each PSCCH duration during which the MAC entity monitors PSCCH:
2> if a 1^st^ stage SCI has been received on the PSCCH:
3> determine the set of PSSCH durations in which reception of a 2^nd^ stage
SCI and the transport block occur using the received part of the SCI;
3> if the 2^nd^ stage SCI for this PSSCH duration has been received on the
PSSCH:
4> store the SCI as a valid SCI for the PSSCH durations corresponding to
transmission(s) of the transport block and the associated HARQ information and
QoS information;
1> for each PSSCH duration for which the MAC entity has a valid SCI:
2> deliver the SCI and the associated Sidelink transmission information to the
Sidelink HARQ Entity.
#### 5.22.2.2 Sidelink HARQ operation
##### 5.22.2.2.1 Sidelink HARQ Entity
There is at most one Sidelink HARQ Entity at the MAC entity for reception of
the SL-SCH, which maintains a number of parallel Sidelink processes.
Each Sidelink process is associated with SCI in which the MAC entity is
interested. This interest is determined by the Sidelink identification
information of the SCI. The Sidelink HARQ Entity directs Sidelink transmission
information and associated TBs received on the SL-SCH to the corresponding
Sidelink processes.
The number of Receiving Sidelink processes associated with the Sidelink HARQ
Entity is defined in TS 38.306 [5].
For each PSSCH duration, the Sidelink HARQ Entity shall:
1> for each SCI valid for this PSSCH duration:
2> if the NDI has been toggled compared to the value of the previous received
transmission corresponding to the Sidelink identification information and the
Sidelink process ID of the SCI or this is the very first received transmission
for the pair of the Sidelink identification information and the Sidelink
process ID of the SCI:
3> if there is a Sidelink process associated with the Sidelink identification
information and the Sidelink process ID of the SCI:
4> consider the Sidelink process as unoccupied;
4> flush the soft buffer for the Sidelink process.
3> allocate the TB received from the physical layer and the associated
Sidelink identification information and Sidelink process ID to an unoccupied
Sidelink process;
3> associate the Sidelink process with the Sidelink identification information
and the Sidelink process ID of this SCI and consider this transmission to be a
new transmission.
NOTE 1: When a new TB arrives, the Sidelink HARQ Entity allocates the TB to
any unoccupied Sidelink process. If there is no unoccupied Sidelink process in
the Sidelink HARQ entity, how to manage receiving Sidelink processes is up to
UE implementation.
NOTE 1a: If the NDI has not been toggled compared to the value of the previous
received transmission corresponding to the Sidelink identification information
and the Sidelink process ID of the SCI, and if there is no Sidelink process
associated with the Sidelink identification information and the Sidelink
process ID of the SCI, it is up to UE implementation to handle the
corresponding TB.
1> for each Sidelink process:
2> if the NDI has not been toggled compared to the value of the previous
received transmission corresponding to the Sidelink identification information
and the Sidelink process ID of the SCI for the Sidelink process according to
its associated SCI:
3> allocate the TB received from the physical layer to the Sidelink process
and consider this transmission to be a retransmission.
NOTE 2: A single sidelink process can only be (re-)associated to a single
combination of Sidelink identification information and Sidelink process ID at
a time and a single combination of Sidelink identification information and
Sidelink process ID can only be (re-)associated to a single sidelink process
at a time.
##### 5.22.2.2.2 Sidelink process
For each PSSCH duration where a transmission takes place for the Sidelink
process, one TB and the associated HARQ information is received from the
Sidelink HARQ Entity.
For each received TB and associated Sidelink transmission information, the
Sidelink process shall:
1> if this is a new transmission:
2> attempt to decode the received data.
1> else if this is a retransmission:
2> if the data for this TB has not yet been successfully decoded:
3> instruct the physical layer to combine the received data with the data
currently in the soft buffer for this TB and attempt to decode the combined
data.
1> if the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode was successfully
decoded for this TB; or
1> if the data for this TB was successfully decoded before:
2> if this is the first successful decoding of the data for this TB:
3> if this TB is associated to unicast and the DST field of the decoded MAC
PDU subheader is equal to the 8 MSB of any of the Source Layer-2 ID(s) of the
UE for which the 16 LSB are equal to the Destination ID in the corresponding
SCI:
4> if the SRC field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 16 MSB of
any of the Destination Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 8 LSB are equal
to the Source ID in the corresponding SCI; or
4> if this TB is corresponding to the logical channel with LCID equal to 0 or
1 and determined to be the first TB:
5> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing entity.
3> if this TB is associated to groupcast or broadcast:
4> if the DST field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 8 MSB of
any of the Destination Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 16 LSB are equal
to the Destination ID in the corresponding SCI; or
4> if this TB is corresponding to the logical channel with LCID equal to 58,
and the DST field of the decoded MAC PDU subheader is equal to the 8 MSB of
any of the Source Layer-2 ID(s) of the UE for which the 16 LSB are equal to
the Destination ID in the corresponding SCI:
5> deliver the decoded MAC PDU to the disassembly and demultiplexing entity.
NOTE: Whether the TB is the first TB can be determined based on the Source
Layer-2 ID and Destination Layer-2 ID pair.
2> consider the Sidelink process as unoccupied.
1> else:
2> instruct the physical layer to replace the data in the soft buffer for this
TB with the data which the MAC entity attempted to decode.
1> if HARQ feedback is enabled by the SCI:
2> if negative-only acknowledgement is indicated by the SCI according to
clause 8.4.1 of TS 38.212 [9]:
3> if UE\'s location information is available and distance beteween UE\'s
location and the central location of the nearest zone that is calculated based
on the _Zone_id_ in the SCI and the value of _sl-ZoneLength_ corresponding to
the communication range requirement in the SCI as specified in TS 38.331 [5]

more than _inactivePosSRS-RSRP-ChangeThreshold_ , if configured; and
1> _inactivePosSRS-TimeAlignmentTimer_ is running.
## 5.27 Small Data Transmission
### 5.27.1 General
The MAC entity may be configured by RRC with SDT and the SDT procedure may be
initiated by RRC layer. The SDT procedure can be performed either by Random
Access procedure with 2-step RA type or 4-step RA type (i.e., RA-SDT) or by
configured grant Type 1 (i.e., CG-SDT).
RRC configures the following parameters for SDT procedure:
\- _sdt-DataVolumeThreshold_ : data volume threshold for the UE to determine
whether to perform SDT procedure;
\- _sdt-RSRP-Threshold_ : RSRP threshold for UE to determine whether to
perform SDT procedure;
\- _cg-SDT-RSRP-ThresholdSSB_ : an RSRP threshold configured for SSB selection
for CG-SDT.
The MAC entity shall, if initiated by the upper layers for SDT procedure:
1> if the data volume of the pending UL data across all RBs configured for SDT
is less than or equal to _sdt-DataVolumeThreshold_ ; and
NOTE 1: For SDT procedure, the MAC entity also considers the suspended RBs
configured with SDT for data volume calculation. It is up to the UE\'s
implementation how the UE calculates the data volume for the suspended RBs.
Size of the CCCH message is not considered for data volume calculation
1> if the RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference is higher than _sdt-RSRP-
Threshold_ or if _sdt-RSRP-Threshold_ is not configured:
2> if the Serving Cell is configured with supplementary uplink as specified in
TS 38.331 [5]; and
2> if the RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference is less than _rsrp-
ThresholdSSB-SUL_ :
3> select the SUL carrier.
2> else:
3> select the NUL carrier.
2> if CG-SDT is configured on the selected UL carrier, and TA for CG-SDT is
valid according to clause 5.27.2 in the first available CG occasion for
initial CG-SDT transmission with CCCH message according to clause 5.8.2; and
2> if, for each RB having data available for transmission,
_configuredGrantType1Allowed, if configured for CG-SDT,_ is configured with
value _true_ for the corresponding logical channel; and
2> if at least one SSB configured for CG-SDT with SS-RSRP above _cg-SDT-RSRP-
ThresholdSSB_ is available:
3> indicate to the upper layers that the conditions for initiating SDT
procedure are fulfilled;
3> perform CG-SDT procedure on the selected UL carrier according to clause
5.8.2.
2> else if a set of Random Access resources for RA-SDT is configured and can
be selected according to clause 5.1.1b on the selected UL carrier on the BWP
configured by _initialUplinkBWP-RedCap_ , if configured for a RedCap UE;
otherwise, on the BWP configured by _initialUplinkBWP_ :
3> if _cg-SDT-TimeAlignmentTimer_ is running, consider _cg-SDT-
TimeAlignmentTimer_ as expired and perform the corresponding actions in clause
5.2;
3> indicate to the upper layers that the conditions for initiating SDT
procedure are fulfilled.
2> else:
3> indicate to the upper layers that the conditions for initiating SDT
procedure are not fulfilled.
1> else:
2> indicate to the upper layers that the conditions for initiating SDT
procedure are not fulfilled.
If RA-SDT is selected above and after the Random Access procedure is
successfully completed (see clause 5.1.6), the UE monitors PDCCH addressed to
C-RNTI received in random access response until the RA-SDT procedure is
terminated. If CG-SDT is selected above and after the initial transmission for
CG-SDT is performed, the UE monitors PDCCH addressed to C-RNTI as stored in UE
Inactive AS context as specified in TS 38.331 [5] and CS-RNTI until the CG-SDT
procedure is terminated.
NOTE 2: When the UE determines if there is an SSB with SS-RSRP above _cg-SDT-
RSRP-ThresholdSSB_ , the UE uses the latest unfiltered L1-RSRP measurement.
### 5.27.2 TA Validation for CG-SDT
RRC configures the following parameters for TA validation for CG-SDT:
_\- cg-SDT-RSRP-ChangeThreshold_ : RSRP threshold for the increase/decrease of
RSRP for time alignment validation.

1> store the current RSRP of the downlink pathloss reference for TA validation
as defined in TS 38.331 [5] clause 5.7.17.
The MAC entity shall consider the TA of the initial CG-SDT transmission with
CCCH message to be valid when the following conditions are fulfilled:
1> The RSRP values for the stored downlink pathloss reference and the current
downlink pathloss reference are valid according to TS 38.133 [11]; and
1> Compared to the stored downlink pathloss reference RSRP value, the current
RSRP value of the downlink pathloss reference calculated as specified in TS
38.133 [11] has not increased/decreased by more than _cg-SDT-RSRP-
ChangeThreshold_ , if configured; and
1> _cg-SDT-TimeAlignmentTimer_ is running.
## 5.28 Sidelink Discontinuous Reception (DRX)
### 5.28.1 General
The MAC entity may be configured by RRC with an SL DRX functionality that
controls the UE\'s SCI (i.e., 1^st^ stage SCI and 2^nd^ stage SCI) monitoring
activity for unicast, groupcast and broadcast. When using SL DRX operation,
the MAC entity shall also monitor SCI (i.e., 1^st^ stage SCI and 2^nd^ stage
SCI) according to requirements found in other clauses of this specification.
RRC controls Sidelink DRX operation by configuring the following parameters:
\- _sl-drx-onDurationTimer_ /_sl-DRX-GC-BC-OndurationTimer_ : the duration at
the beginning of an SL DRX cycle;
\- _sl-drx-SlotOffset_ : the delay before starting the _sl-drx-
onDurationTimer_ /_sl-DRX-GC-BC-OndurationTimer_ ;
\- _sl-drx-InactivityTimer_ /_sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer_ (except for the SL
broadcast communication): the duration after the first slot of SCI (i.e.,
1^st^ stage SCI and 2^nd^ stage SCI) reception in which an SCI indicates a new
SL transmission for the MAC entity;
\- _sl-drx-RetransmissionTimer_ /_sl-DRX-GC-RetransmissionTimer_ (per Sidelink
process except for the SL broadcast process): the maximum duration until an SL
retransmission is received;
\- _sl-drx-StartOffset_ : the slot where the SL DRX cycle starts;
\- _sl-drx-Cycle_ /_sl-DRX-GC-BC-Cycle_ : the Sidelink DRX cycle;
\- _sl-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer_ /_sl-DRX-GC-HARQ-RTT-Timer_ (per Sidelink process
except for the SL broadcast process): the minimum duration before an SL HARQ
retransmission is expected by the MAC entity.
### 5.28.2 Behaviour of UE receiving SL-SCH Data
When SL DRX is configured, the Active Time includes the time while:
\- _sl-drx-onDurationTimer_ /_sl-DRX-GC-BC-OndurationTimer_ or _sl-drx-
InactivityTimer_ /_sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer_ is running; or
_\- sl-drx-RetransmissionTimer_ /_sl-DRX-GC-RetransmissionTimer is running_ ;
or
\- _period of sl-LatencyBoundCSI-Report configured by RRC in case SL-CSI
reporting MAC CE is not received; or_
_\- the time between the transmission of the request of SL-CSI reporting and
the reception of the SL-CSI reporting MAC CE in case SL-CSI reporting MAC CE
is received; or_
_\- Slot(s) associated with the announced periodic transmission(s) by the UE
transmitting SL-SCH Data; or_
_\- the time between transmission/reception of Direct Link Establishment
Request message (TS 24.587 [28]) or ProSe Direct Link Establishment Request
message (TS 24.554 [29]) and reception of RRCReconfigurationSidelink message
including initial DRX configuration or the link establishment procedure being
aborted by upper layer; or_
_\- the time between transmission of RRCReconfigurationSidelink message
including initial DRX configuration and reception of corresponding
RRCReconfigurationCompleteSidelink or RRCReconfigurationFailureSidelink
message._
When one or multiple SL DRX is configured, the MAC entity shall:

QoS-Profile_ is associated to a Destination and interested cast type is
associated to groupcast or broadcast:

_SL-QoS-Profile_ associated with the Destination:
1> else if multiple _sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer_ that are mapped with multiple
_SL-QoS-Profile_ of a Destination Layer-2 ID and interested cast type is
associated to groupcast:
2> select _sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer_ whose length is the longest one among
multiple _sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer_ that are mapped with multiple _SL-QoS-
Profile_ associated with the Destination Layer-2 ID.
1> if an _sl-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer_ expires:
2> if the data of the corresponding Sidelink process was not successfully
decoded or if the HARQ feedback (i.e., negative acknowledgement) is not
transmitted for unicast due to UL/SL prioritization:

> for the corresponding Sidelink process in the first slot after the expiry of
> _sl-drx-HARQ-RTT-Timer_.
When the cast type is groupcast or broadcast as indicated by upper layer, or
the cast type is unicast for the reception of _Direct Link Establishment
Request message [28] or ProSe Direct Link Establishment Request message [29]
as indicated by upper layer_ , or for the reception of discovery message [26],
the _sl-drx-StartOffset_ and _sl-drx-SlotOffset_ are derived from the
following equations:
> _sl-drx-StartOffset_ (ms) = Destination Layer-2 ID modulo _sl-DRX-GC-BC-
> Cycle_ (ms).
>
> _sl-drx-SlotOffset_ (ms) = (Destination Layer-2 ID modulo the number of

### 5.28.3 Behaviour of UE transmitting SL-SCH Data
The UE transmitting SL-SCH Data should keep aligned with its intended UE
receiving the SL-SCH Data regarding the SL DRX Active time as specified in
clause 5.28.2.
Furthermore, the UE transmitting SL-SCH Data determines the SL DRX Active time
based on SL DRX timers that are running (e.g., _sl-drx-onDurationTimer/sl-DRX-
GC-BC-OndurationTimer_ , _sl-drx-InactivityTimer/sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer_ ,
_sl-drx-RetransmissionTimer/sl-DRX-GC-RetransmissionTimer_) or will be running
in the future (e.g., _sl-drx-onDurationTimer/sl-DRX-GC-BC-OndurationTimer,_
_sl-drx-InactivityTimer/sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer_ , _sl-drx-
RetransmissionTimer/sl-DRX-GC-RetransmissionTimer_) at the UE(s) receiving SL-
SCH data. The UE may select resource for the initial transmission of groupcast
within the time when _sl-DRX-GC-BC-OndurationTimer_ or _sl-DRX-GC-
InactivityTimer_ of the destination is running.
NOTE 1: A UE may assume that a resource for retransmission is in the Active
time if an initial transmission causes the _sl-drx-RetransmissionTimer_ to be
started at the receiving UE.
NOTE 2: A UE may send SL DRX Command MAC CE to receiving UE for unicast and
when to send SL DRX Command MAC CE is up to UE implementation.
1> if the SCI indicates a new transmission where the cast type is set to
groupcast is transmitted:
2> start or restart _sl-DRX-GC-InactivityTimer_ for the corresponding
Destination Layer-2 ID in the first slot after SCI transmission.
The MAC entity shall for each pair of the Source Layer-2 ID and the
Destination Layer-2 ID corresponding to each PC5-RRC connection which has been
established by upper layers:
1> if the SL DRX Command indication has been triggered by the UE:
2> if the MAC entity has SL resources allocated for new transmission and the
SL-SCH resources can accommodate the SL DRX Command MAC CE and its subheader
as a result of logical channel prioritization:
3> instruct the Multiplexing and Assembly procedure to generate a Sidelink DRX
Command MAC CE as defined in clause 6.1.3.52;
3> cancel the triggered SL DRX Command indication.
2> else if the MAC entity has been configured with Sidelink resource
allocation mode 1:
3> trigger a Scheduling Request.
## 5.29 Activation/Deactivation of SCG
The network may activate and deactivate the configured SCG.
The MAC entity shall for the configured SCG:

_timeAlignmentTimer_ associated with PTAG is not running:
3> indicate to upper layers that a Random Access Procedure (as specified in
clause 5.1.1) is needed for SCG activation.
2> activate the SCG according to the timing defined in TS 38.133 [11].
2> (re-)initialize any suspended configured uplink grants of configured grant
Type 1 associated with this PSCell according to the stored configuration, if
any, and to start in the symbol according to rules in clause 5.8.2.2;
2> apply normal SCG operation including:
3> SRS transmissions on the PSCell;
3> CSI reporting for the PSCell;
3> PDCCH monitoring on the PSCell;
3> PUCCH transmissions on the PSCell;
3> transmit on RACH on the PSCell;
3> initialize _Bj_ for each logical channel to zero.
1> else if upper layers indicate that the SCG is deactivated:
2> deactivate all the SCells of the SCG according to clause 5.9;
2> deactivate SCG according to the timing defined in TS 38.133 [11];
> 2> clear any configured downlink assignment and any configured uplink grant
> Type 2 associated with the PSCell respectively;
2> suspend any configured uplink grant Type 1 associated with the PSCell;
2> reset MAC according to clause 5.12.
1> if the SCG is deactivated:
2> not transmit SRS on the PSCell;
2> not report CSI for the PSCell;
2> not transmit on UL-SCH on the PSCell;
2> not transmit PUCCH on the PSCell;
2> not transmit on RACH on the PSCell;
2> not monitor the PDCCH on the PSCell.
## 5.30 Handling of FR2 UL gap
During the FR2 UL gap configured by _ul-GapFR2-Config_ as specified in TS
38.331 [5], the MAC entity shall, on the Serving Cell(s) of FR2 single CC and
intra-band CA, or on the Serving Cell(s) of FR2 inter-band CA where UE does
not support _tx-Support-UL-GapFR2_ :
1> only perform transmission of:
2> PRACH preamble as specified in clause 5.1.2 and 5.1.2a;
2> UL-SCH for Msg3 or the MSGA payload as specified in clause 5.4.2.2;
2> UL-SCH for configured grant;
2> the valid CSI report during SCell activation procedure where the valid CSI
report is valid CQI with non-zero CQI index defined in TS 38.214 [7], clause
5.2.2.1, when the time period between UL gap colliding with CSI report of non-
zero CQI and the slot where the SCell activation MAC CE or CSI report
activation command is received is no less than 10 ms;
2> the valid L1 RSRP report during SCell activation procedure, where the valid
L1 RSRP report is non lowest L1 RSRP defined in TS 38.133 [11], clause 10.1.6,
when the time period between UL gap colliding with L1 RSRP reporting and the
slot where the SCell activation MAC CE or CSI report activation command is
received is no less than 10 ms;

## 6.1 Protocol Data Units
### 6.1.1 General
A MAC PDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in
length. In the figures in clause 6, bit strings are represented by tables in
which the most significant bit is the leftmost bit of the first line of the
table, the least significant bit is the rightmost bit on the last line of the
table, and more generally the bit string is to be read from left to right and
then in the reading order of the lines. The bit order of each parameter field
within a MAC PDU is represented with the first and most significant bit in the
leftmost bit and the last and least significant bit in the rightmost bit.
A MAC SDU is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in
length. A MAC SDU is included into a MAC PDU from the first bit onward.
A MAC CE is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits) in
length.
A MAC subheader is a bit string that is byte aligned (i.e. multiple of 8 bits)
in length. Each MAC subheader is placed immediately in front of the
corresponding MAC SDU, MAC CE, or padding.
The MAC entity shall ignore the value of the Reserved bits in downlink MAC
PDUs.
### 6.1.2 MAC PDU (DL-SCH and UL-SCH except transparent MAC and Random Access
Response)
A MAC PDU consists of one or more MAC subPDUs. Each MAC subPDU consists of one
of the following:
\- A MAC subheader only (including padding);
\- A MAC subheader and a MAC SDU;
\- A MAC subheader and a MAC CE;
\- A MAC subheader and padding.
The MAC SDUs are of variable sizes.
Each MAC subheader corresponds to either a MAC SDU, a MAC CE, or padding.
A MAC subheader except for fixed sized MAC CE, padding, and a MAC SDU
containing UL CCCH consists of the header fields R/F/LCID/(eLCID)/L. A MAC
subheader for fixed sized MAC CE, padding, and a MAC SDU containing UL CCCH
consists of the two header fields R/LCID/(eLCID).

Figure 6.1.2-2: R/F/LCID/(eLCID)/L MAC subheader with 16-bit L field
Figure 6.1.2-3: R/LCID/(eLCID) MAC subheader
MAC CEs are placed together. DL MAC subPDU(s) with MAC CE(s) is placed before
any MAC subPDU with MAC SDU and MAC subPDU with padding as depicted in Figure
6.1.2-4. UL MAC subPDU(s) with MAC CE(s) is placed after all the MAC subPDU(s)
with MAC SDU and before the MAC subPDU with padding in the MAC PDU as depicted
in Figure 6.1.2-5. The size of padding can be zero.

A maximum of one MAC PDU can be transmitted per TB per MAC entity.
### 6.1.3 MAC Control Elements (CEs)
#### 6.1.3.1 Buffer Status Report MAC CEs
Buffer Status Report (BSR) MAC CEs consist of either:
\- Short BSR format (fixed size); or
\- Extended Short BSR format (fixed size); or
\- Long BSR format (variable size); or
\- Extended Long BSR format (variable size); or
\- Short Truncated BSR format (fixed size); or
\- Extended Short Truncated BSR format (fixed size); or
\- Long Truncated BSR format (variable size); or
\- Extended Long Truncated BSR format (variable size).
Pre-emptive BSR MAC CE consists of:
\- Pre-emptive BSR format (variable size); or
\- Extended Pre-emptive BSR format (variable size).
The BSR formats are identified by MAC subheaders with LCIDs as specified in
Table 6.2.1-2.
The Extended BSR formats and Pre-emptive BSR format are identified by MAC
subheaders with eLCIDs as specified in Table 6.2.1-2b.
The fields in the BSR MAC CE are defined as follows:
\- LCG ID: The Logical Channel Group ID field identifies the group of logical
channel(s) whose buffer status is being reported. The length of the field is 3
bits for the case of Short BSR and Short Truncated BSR formats, and 8 bits for
the case of Extended Short BSR and Extended Short Truncated BSR formats;
\- LCG~i~: For the Long BSR format, Extended Long BSR format, Pre-emptive BSR
format, and Extended Pre-emptive BSR format, this field indicates the presence
of the Buffer Size field for the logical channel group i. The LCG~i~ field set
to 1 indicates that the Buffer Size field for the logical channel group i is
reported. The LCG~i~ field set to 0 indicates that the Buffer Size field for
the logical channel group i is not reported. For the Long Truncated BSR format
and the Extended Long Truncated BSR format, this field indicates whether
logical channel group i has data available. The LCG~i~ field set to 1
indicates that logical channel group i has data available. The LCG~i~ field
set to 0 indicates that logical channel group i does not have data available;
\- Buffer Size: The Buffer Size field identifies the total amount of data
available according to the data volume calculation procedure in TSs 38.322 [3]
and 38.323 [4] across all logical channels of a logical channel group after
the MAC PDU has been built (i.e. after the logical channel prioritization
procedure, which may result the value of the Buffer Size field to zero). The
amount of data is indicated in number of bytes. The size of the RLC headers
and MAC subheaders are not considered in the buffer size computation. The
length of this field for the Short BSR format and the Short Truncated BSR
format is 5 bits. The length of this field for the Extended Short BSR format
and the Extended Short Truncated BSR format is 8 bits. The length of this
field for the Long BSR format, the Long Truncated BSR format, the Extended
Long BSR format, and the Extended Long Truncated format is 8 bits. The values
for the 5-bit and 8-bit Buffer Size fields are shown in Tables 6.1.3.1-1 and
6.1.3.1-2, respectively. For the Long BSR format, the Long Truncated BSR
format, the Extended Long BSR format, and the Extended Long Truncated format,
the Buffer Size fields are included in ascending order based on the LCG~i~.
For the Long Truncated BSR format and the Extended Long Truncated format the
number of Buffer Size fields included is maximised, while not exceeding the
number of padding bits. For the Pre-emptive BSR format and the Extended Pre-
emptive BSR format, the Buffer Size field identifies the total amount of the
data expected to arrive at the IAB-MT of the node where the Pre-emptive
BSR/Extended Pre-emptive BSR is triggered and does not include the volume of
data currently available in the IAB-MT. Pre-emptive BSR format is identical to
the Long BSR format. Extended Pre-emptive BSR format is identical to the
Extended Long BSR format.
NOTE 1: For the Pre-emptive BSR, if configured, the LCGs to be reported, the
expected data volume calculation, the exact time to report Pre-emptive BSR and
the associated LCH are left to implementation.
NOTE 2: The mapping of LCGs between the ingress and egress links of an IAB
node for purposes of determining expected change in occupancy of IAB-MT
buffers (to be reported as Pre-emptive BSR) is left to implementation.
NOTE 3: The number of the Buffer Size fields in the Long BSR, Extended Long
BSR, Long Truncated BSR, and Extended Long Truncated BSR format can be zero.
NOTE 4: The Extended versions of the BSR formats can only be used by IAB
nodes.

A single octet bitmap is used for indicating the presence of PH per Serving
Cell when the highest _ServCellIndex_ of Serving Cell with configured uplink
is less than 8, otherwise four octets are used.
The MAC entity determines whether PH value for an activated Serving Cell is
based on real transmission or a reference format by considering the configured
grant(s) and downlink control information which has been received until and
including the PDCCH occasion in which the first UL grant for a new
transmission that can accommodate the MAC CE for PHR as a result of LCP as
defined in clause 5.4.3.1 is received since a PHR has been triggered if the
PHR MAC CE is reported on an uplink grant received on the PDCCH or until the
first uplink symbol of PUSCH transmission minus PUSCH preparation time as
defined in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6] if the PHR MAC CE is reported on a
configured grant.
For a band combination in which the UE does not support dynamic power sharing,
the UE may omit the octets containing Power Headroom field and P~CMAX,f,c~
field for Serving Cells in the other MAC entity except for the PCell in the
other MAC entity and the reported values of Power Headroom and P~CMAX,f,c~ for
the PCell are up to UE implementation.
The PHR MAC CEs are defined as follows:
\- C~i~: This field indicates the presence of a PH field for the Serving Cell
with _ServCellIndex_ i as specified in TS 38.331 [5]. The C~i~ field set to 1
indicates that a PH field for the Serving Cell with _ServCellIndex_ i is
reported. The C~i~ field set to 0 indicates that a PH field for the Serving
Cell with _ServCellIndex_ i is not reported;
\- R: Reserved bit, set to 0;
\- V: This field indicates if the PH value is based on a real transmission or
a reference format. For Type 1 PH, the V field set to 0 indicates real
transmission on PUSCH and the V field set to 1 indicates that a PUSCH
reference format is used. For Type 2 PH, the V field set to 0 indicates real
transmission on PUCCH and the V field set to 1 indicates that a PUCCH
reference format is used. For Type 3 PH, the V field set to 0 indicates real
transmission on SRS and the V field set to 1 indicates that an SRS reference
format is used. Furthermore, for Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 PH, the V field
set to 0 indicates the presence of the octet containing the associated
P~CMAX,f,c~ field and the MPE field, and the V field set to 1 indicates that
the octet containing the associated P~CMAX,f,c~ field and the MPE field is
omitted;

values in dB for the NR Serving Cell are specified in TS 38.133 [11] while the
corresponding measured values in dB for the E-UTRA Serving Cell are specified
in TS 36.133 [12]);
\- P: If _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ is configured and the Serving Cell operates on
FR2, the MAC entity shall set this field to 0 if the applied P-MPR value, to
meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15], is less than P-MPR_00
as specified in TS 38.133 [11] and to 1 otherwise. If _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ is
not configured or the Serving Cell operates on FR1, this field indicates
whether power backoff is applied due to power management (as allowed by
P-MPR~c~ as specified in TS 38.101-1 [14], TS 38.101-2 [15], and TS 38.101-3
[16]). The MAC entity shall set the P field to 1 if the corresponding
P~CMAX,f,c~ field would have had a different value if no power backoff due to
power management had been applied;
\- P~CMAX,f,c~: If present, this field indicates the P~CMAX,f,c~ (as specified
in TS 38.213 [6]) for the NR Serving Cell and the P~CMAX,c~ or PÌƒ~CMAX,c~ (as
specified in TS 36.213 [17]) for the E-UTRA Serving Cell used for calculation
of the preceding PH field. The reported P~CMAX,f,c~ and the corresponding
nominal UE transmit power levels are shown in Table 6.1.3.8-2 (the
corresponding measured values in dBm for the NR Serving Cell are specified in
TS 38.133 [11] while the corresponding measured values in dBm for the E-UTRA
Serving Cell are specified in TS 36.133 [12]);
\- MPE: If _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ is configured, and the Serving Cell operates on
FR2, and if the P field is set to 1, this field indicates the applied power
backoff to meet MPE requirements, as specified in TS 38.101-2 [15]. This field
indicates an index to Table 6.1.3.8-3 and the corresponding measured values of
P-MPR levels in dB are specified in TS 38.133 [11]. The length of the field is
2 bits. If _mpe-Reporting-FR2_ is not configured, or if the Serving Cell
operates on FR1, or if the P field is set to 0, R bits are present instead.

Figure 6.1.3.50-1: Enhanced Single Entry PHR for multiple TRP MAC CE
#### 6.1.3.51 Enhanced Multiple Entry PHR for multiple TRP MAC CE
The Enhanced Multiple Entry PHR for multiple TRP MAC CE is identified by a MAC
subheader with eLCID as specified in Table 6.2.1-2b.
It has a variable size, and includes the bitmaps, a Type 2 PH field and an
octet containing the associated P~CMAX,f,c~ field (if reported) for SpCell of
the other MAC entity, a Type 1 PH field and an octet containing the associated
P~CMAX,f,c~ field (if reported) for the PCell. It further includes, in
ascending order based on the _ServCellIndex_ , one or multiple of Type X PH
fields and octets containing the associated P~CMAX,f,c~ fields (if reported)
for Serving Cells other than PCell indicated in the bitmap for indicating the
presence of PH(s). X is either 1 or 3 according to TS 38.213 [6] and TS 36.213
[17].
The presence of Type 2 PH field for SpCell of the other MAC entity is
configured by _phr-Type2OtherCell_ with value _true_.
A single octet bitmap is used for indicating the presence of PH(s) per Serving
Cell when the highest _ServCellIndex_ of Serving Cell with configured uplink
is less than 8, otherwise four octets are used.
The MAC entity determines whether PH value for an activated Serving Cell is
based on real transmission or a reference format by considering the configured
grant(s) and downlink control information which has been received until and
including the PDCCH occasion in which the first UL grant for a new
transmission that can accommodate the MAC CE for PHR as a result of LCP as
defined in clause 5.4.3.1 is received since a PHR has been triggered if the
PHR MAC CE is reported on an uplink grant received on the PDCCH or until the
first uplink symbol of PUSCH transmission minus PUSCH preparation time as
defined in clause 7.7 of TS 38.213 [6] if the PHR MAC CE is reported on a
configured grant.
For a band combination in which the UE does not support dynamic power sharing,
the UE may omit the octets containing Power Headroom field and P~CMAX,f,c~
field for Serving Cells in the other MAC entity except for the PCell in the
other MAC entity and the reported values of Power Headroom and P~CMAX,f,c~ for
the PCell are up to UE implementation.
