## 4.1 General
All the per DRB per cell measurements and per DRB per UE measurements can be
aggregated into per QoS level per cell and per PLMN ID per cell by network
implementation. All the performance measurements for gNB defined in TS 28.552
[2] 5.1 can be calculated into per PLMN ID level by network implementation.
Per QoS level refers to per mapped 5QI for NR SA or per QCI for EN-DC.

#### 4.2.1.2 Packet delay
##### 4.2.1.2.1 General
Packet delay includes RAN part of delay and CN part of delay.
The RAN part of DL packet delay measurement comprises:
\- D1 (DL delay in over-the-air interface), referring to Average delay DL air-
interface in TS 28.552 [2] 5.1.1.1.1.
\- D2 (DL delay on gNB-DU), referring to Average delay in RLC sublayer of gNB-
DU in TS 28.552 [2] 5.1.3.3.3.
\- D3 (DL delay on F1-U), referring to Average delay on F1-U in TS 28.552 [2]
5.1.3.3.2.
\- D4 (DL delay in CU-UP), referring to Average delay DL in CU-UP in TS 28.552
[2] 5.1.3.3.1.
The DL packet delay measurements, i.e. D1 (the DL delay in over-the-air
interface ), D2 (the DL delay in gNB-DU), D3 (the DL delay on F1-U) and D4
(the DL delay in CU-UP), should be measured per DRB per UE.
NOTE: The delay measurements D1, D2 and D4 are also applicable for EUTRA in
case of EN-DC related DL delay measurements on the MN side.
The RAN part (including UE) of UL packet delay measurement comprises:
\- D1 (UL PDCP packet average delay, as defined in clause 4.3.1.1).
\- D2.1 (average over-the-air interface packet delay, as defined in
4.2.1.2.2).
\- D2.2 (average RLC packet delay, as defined in 4.2.1.2.3).
\- D2.3 (average delay UL on F1-U, it is measured using the same metric as the
average delay DL on F1-U defined in TS 28.552 [2] clause 5.1.3.3.2).
\- D2.4 (average PDCP re-ordering delay, as defined in 4.2.1.2.4).
The UL packet delay measurements, i.e. D1(UL PDCP packet average delay),
D2.1(average over-the-air interface packet delay), D2.2(average RLC packet
delay), D2.3(average delay UL on F1-U) and D2.4(average PDCP re-ordering
delay), should be measured per DRB per UE. The unit of D1, D2.1, D2.2, D2.3
and D2.4 is 0.1ms.
NOTE: The delay measurements D1, D2.1, D2.2 and D2.4 are also applicable for
EUTRA in case of EN-DC related UL delay measurements on the MN side.
For non CU-UP and DU split case, RAN part of packet delay excludes the delay
at FI-U interface, i.e. D2.3 and D3.
If network disables the PDCP re-ordering function, the value of Average PDCP
re-ordering delay i.e. D2.4 should be set to 0.
For the QoS monitoring in TS 23.501 [4], RAN informs the RAN part of UL packet
delay measurement, or the RAN part of DL packet delay measurement, or both to
the CN.
##### 4.2.1.2.2 Average over-the-air interface packet delay in the UL per DRB

The objective of this measurement is to measure air interface UL packet delay
for OAM performance observability or for QoS verification of MDT or for the

#### 4.3.1.2 UL PDCP Excess Packet Delay per DRB
The objective of this measurement performed by UE is to measure Excess Packet
Delay in Layer PDCP for QoS verification of MDT.
Protocol Layer: PDCP
Table 4.3.1.2-1: Definition for UL PDCP Excess Packet Delay per DRB
+------------+--------------------------------------------------------+ | Definition | PDCP Excess Packet Delay in the UL per DRB. It | | | represents the ratio of packets in UL per DRB | | | exceeding the configured delay threshold among the UL | | | PDCP SDUs received. The delay for each packet is | | | calculated from packet arrival at PDCP upper SAP until | | | the UL grant to transmit the packet is available, | | | which has included the delay the UE gets resources | | | granted (from sending SR/RACH to get the first grant). | | | The measurement is done separately per DRB. | | | | | | Detailed Definition: | | | | | | $$M | | | (T,drbid) = \frac{nExcess(T,drbid)}{nTotal(T,drbid)}$$ | | | | | | $tULdelay | | | (i,drbid) = tDeliv(i,drbid) - tArrival(i,drbid)$,where | | | | | | explanations can be found in the table 4.3.1.2-1 | | | below. | +------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
Table 4.3.1.2-2
$$M(T,drbid)$$ Ratio of packets in UL per DRB exceeding the configured delay
threshold among the UL PDCP SDUs for which the UL MAC PDU including the first
part of UL PDCP SDU is scheduled for transmission during the time period T.
* * *
$$nExcess(T,drbid)$$ Number of PDCP SDUs of a data radio bearer with DRB
Identity = $\text{drbid}$,for which ULdelay $\text{tULdelay}(i,drbid)$
exceeded the configured _delayThreshold_ as defined in TS 38.331 [3] during
the time period T. $$nTotal(T,drbid)$$ Number of PDCP SDUs of a data radio
bearer with DRB Identity = $\text{drbid}$, for which the UL MAC PDU including
the first part of UL PDCP SDU is scheduled for transmission during the time
period T. $$\text{tULdelay}(i,drbid)$$ Queuing delay observed at the UE PDCP
layer from the UL PDCP SDU i belonging to a data radio bearer with DRB
Identity = $\text{drbid}$ arrival at PDCP upper SAP until the UL MAC PDU k
including the first part of UL PDCP SDU i is scheduled for transmission during
the time period T. $$tDeliv(i,drbid)$$ The point in time when the UL MAC PDU k
including the first part of UL PDCP SDU i is scheduled for transmission.
$$tArrival(i,drbid)$$ The point in time when the UL PDCP SDU i arrivals at
PDCP upper SAP. $$i$$ Index of PDCP SDU that arrives at the PDCP upper SAP
during time period $T$. $$T$$ Time period during which the measurement is
performed.
##### 4.3.1.2.1 Measurement report mapping for PDCP Excess Packet Delay
UL PDCP excess packet delay shall be measured according to configuration as
defined in TS 38.331 [3].
The UE shall report UL PDCP excess packet delay as the ratio of SDUs exceeding
the configured delay threshold and the total number of SDUs received by the UE
during the measurement period.
The reported PDCP excess packet delay ratio is mapped to 32 levels with the
quantities in the range of 0 \< nExcess ≤ 100% with uniform quantization in
the log domain.
The mapping of measured quantity is defined in Table 4.3.1.2.1-1.
