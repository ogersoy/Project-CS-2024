## 4.2 Architecture
### 4.2.1 UE states and state transitions including inter RAT
A UE is either in RRC_CONNECTED state or in RRC_INACTIVE state when an RRC
connection has been established. If this is not the case, i.e. no RRC
connection is established, the UE is in RRC_IDLE state. The RRC states can
further be characterised as follows:
**\- RRC_IDLE** :
\- A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers;
\- At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a DRX for PTM transmission
of MBS broadcast;
\- UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;
\- The UE:
\- Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5);
\- Monitors a Paging channel for CN paging using 5G-S-TMSI, except if the UE
is acting as a L2 U2N Remote UE;
\- If configured by upper layers for MBS multicast reception, monitors a
Paging channel for CN paging using TMGI;
\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
\- Acquires system information and can send SI request (if configured);
\- Performs logging of available measurements together with location and time
for logged measurement configured UEs;
\- Performs idle/inactive measurements for idle/inactive measurement
configured UEs;
\- If configured by upper layers for MBS broadcast reception, acquires MCCH
change notification and MBS broadcast control information and data.
**\- RRC_INACTIVE** :
\- A UE specific DRX may be configured by upper layers or by RRC layer;
\- At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a DRX for PTM transmission
of MBS broadcast;
\- UE controlled mobility based on network configuration;
\- The UE stores the UE Inactive AS context;
\- A RAN-based notification area is configured by RRC layer;
\- Transfer of unicast data and/or signalling to/from UE over radio bearers
configured for SDT.
\- The UE:
\- Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5);
\- During SDT procedure, monitors control channels associated with the shared
data channel to determine if data is scheduled for it;
\- While SDT procedure is not ongoing, monitors a Paging channel for CN paging
using 5G-S-TMSI and RAN paging using fullI-RNTI, except if the UE is acting as
a L2 U2N Remote UE;
\- If configured by upper layers for MBS multicast reception, while SDT
procedure is not ongoing, monitors a Paging channel for paging using TMGI;
\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and cell (re-)selection;
\- Performs RAN-based notification area updates periodically and when moving
outside the configured RAN-based notification area;
\- Acquires system information and, while SDT procedure is not ongoing, can
send SI request (if configured);
\- While SDT procedure is not ongoing, performs logging of available
measurements together with location and time for logged measurement configured
UEs;
\- While SDT procedure is not ongoing, performs idle/inactive measurements for
idle/inactive measurement configured UEs;
\- If configured by upper layers for MBS broadcast reception, acquires MCCH
change notification and MBS broadcast control information and data;
\- Transmits SRS for Positioning.
**\- RRC_CONNECTED:**
\- The UE stores the AS context;
\- Transfer of unicast data to/from UE;
\- Transfer of MBS multicast data to UE;
\- At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a UE specific DRX;
\- At lower layers, the UE may be configured with a DRX for PTM transmission
of MBS broadcast and/or a DRX for MBS multicast;
\- For UEs supporting CA, use of one or more SCells, aggregated with the
SpCell, for increased bandwidth;
\- For UEs supporting DC, use of one SCG, aggregated with the MCG, for
increased bandwidth;
\- Network controlled mobility within NR, to/from E-UTRA, and to UTRA-FDD;
\- Network controlled mobility (path switch) between a serving cell and a L2
U2N Relay UE, or vice versa.
\- The UE:
\- Monitors Short Messages transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5),
if configured;
\- Monitors control channels associated with the shared data channel to
determine if data is scheduled for it;
\- Provides channel quality and feedback information;
\- Performs neighbouring cell measurements and measurement reporting;
\- Acquires system information;
\- Performs immediate MDT measurement together with available location
reporting;
\- If configured by upper layers for MBS broadcast reception, acquires MCCH
change notification and MBS broadcast control information and data.

### 4.2.2 Signalling radio bearers
\"Signalling Radio Bearers\" (SRBs) are defined as Radio Bearers (RBs) that
are used only for the transmission of RRC and NAS messages. More specifically,
the following SRBs are defined:
\- SRB0 is for RRC messages using the CCCH logical channel;
\- SRB1 is for RRC messages (which may include a piggybacked NAS message) as
well as for NAS messages prior to the establishment of SRB2, all using DCCH
logical channel;
\- SRB2 is for NAS messages and for RRC messages which include logged
measurement information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB2 has a lower
priority than SRB1 and may be configured by the network after AS security
activation;
\- SRB3 is for specific RRC messages when UE is in (NG)EN-DC or NR-DC, all
using DCCH logical channel;
\- SRB4 is for RRC messages which include application layer measurement report
information, all using DCCH logical channel. SRB4 has a lower priority than
SRB1 and can only be configured by the network after AS security activation.
In downlink, piggybacking of NAS messages is used only for one dependant (i.e.
with joint success/failure) procedure: bearer
establishment/modification/release. In uplink piggybacking of NAS message is
used only for transferring the initial NAS message during connection setup and
connection resume.
NOTE 1: The NAS messages transferred via SRB2 are also contained in RRC
messages, which however do not include any RRC protocol control information.
Once AS security is activated, all RRC messages on SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 and SRB4,
including those containing NAS messages, are integrity protected and ciphered
by PDCP. NAS independently applies integrity protection and ciphering to the
NAS messages, see TS 24.501 [23].
Split SRB is supported for all the MR-DC options in both SRB1 and SRB2 (split
SRB is not supported for SRB0, SRB3 and SRB4).
For operation with shared spectrum channel access in FR1, SRB0, SRB1 and SRB3
are assigned with the highest priority Channel Access Priority Class (CAPC),
(i.e. CAPC = 1) while CAPC for SRB2 is configurable.

# 5 Procedures
## 5.1 General
### 5.1.1 Introduction
This clause covers the general requirements.
### 5.1.2 General requirements
The UE shall:
1> process the received messages in order of reception by RRC, i.e. the
processing of a message shall be completed before starting the processing of a
subsequent message;
NOTE: Network may initiate a subsequent procedure prior to receiving the UE\'s
response of a previously initiated procedure.
1> within a clause execute the steps according to the order specified in the
procedural description;
1> consider the term \'radio bearer\' (RB) to cover SRBs, DRBs and MRBs unless
explicitly stated otherwise;
1> set the _rrc-TransactionIdentifier_ in the response message, if included,
to the same value as included in the message received from the network that
triggered the response message;
1> upon receiving a choice value set to _setup_ :
2> apply the corresponding received configuration and start using the
associated resources, unless explicitly specified otherwise;
1> upon receiving a choice value set to _release_ :
2> clear the corresponding configuration and stop using the associated
resources;
1> in case the size of a list is extended, upon receiving an extension field
comprising the entries in addition to the ones carried by the original field
(regardless of whether the network signals more entries in total); apply the
following generic behaviour unless explicitly stated otherwise:
2> create a combined list by concatenating the additional entries included in
the extension field to the original field while maintaining the order among
both the original and the additional entries;
2> for the combined list, created according to the previous, apply the same
behaviour as defined for the original field.
### 5.1.3 Requirements for UE in MR-DC
In this specification, the UE considers itself to be in:
\- EN-DC, if and only if it is configured with _nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig_
according to TS 36.331[10], and it is connected to EPC,
\- NGEN-DC, if and only if it is configured with _nr-SecondaryCellGroupConfig_
according to TS 36.331[10], and it is connected to 5GC,
\- NE-DC, if and only if it is configured with _mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup_ set
to _eutra-SCG_ ,
\- NR-DC, if and only if it is configured with _mrdc-SecondaryCellGroup_ set
to _nr-SCG_ ,
\- MR-DC, if and only if it is in (NG)EN-DC, NE-DC or NR-DC.
NOTE: This use of these terms deviates from the definition in TS 37.340 [41]
and other specifications. In TS 37.340, these terms include also the case
where the UE is configured with E-UTRA or NR MCG only (i.e. no NR or E-UTRA
SCG) but with one or more bearers terminated in a secondary node (i.e. using
NR PDCP).
The UE in (NG)EN-DC only executes a subclause of clause 5 in this
specification when the subclause:
\- is referred to from a subclause under execution, either in this
specification or in TS 36.331 [10]; or
\- applies to a message received on SRB3 (if SRB3 is established); or
\- applies to field(s), IE(s), UE variable(s) or timer(s) in this
specification that the UE is configured with.
When executing a subclause of clause 5 in this specification, the UE follows
the requirements in clause 5.1.2 and in all subclauses of this specification
applicable to the messages (including processing time requirements), fields,
IEs, timers and UE variables indicated in the subclause under execution.
## 5.2 System information
### 5.2.1 Introduction
System Information (SI) is divided into the _MIB_ and a number of SIBs and
posSIBs where:
\- the _MIB_ is always transmitted on the BCH with a periodicity of 80 ms and
repetitions made within 80 ms (TS 38.212 [17], clause 7.1) and it includes
parameters that are needed to acquire _SIB1_ from the cell. The first
transmission of the _MIB_ is scheduled in subframes as defined in TS 38.213
[13], clause 4.1 and repetitions are scheduled according to the period of SSB;
NOTE 1: If the period of SSB is larger than 80 ms, the MIB is transmitted with
the same periodicity as that of SSB.
\- the _SIB1_ is transmitted on the DL-SCH with a periodicity of 160 ms and
variable transmission repetition periodicity within 160 ms as specified in TS
38.213 [13], clause 13. The default transmission repetition periodicity of
_SIB1_ is 20 ms but the actual transmission repetition periodicity is up to
network implementation. For SSB and CORESET multiplexing pattern 1, _SIB1_
repetition transmission period is 20 ms. For SSB and CORESET multiplexing
pattern 2/3, _SIB1_ transmission repetition period is the same as the SSB
period (TS 38.213 [13], clause 13). _SIB1_ includes information regarding the
availability and scheduling (e.g. mapping of SIBs to SI message, periodicity,
SI-window size) of other SIBs with an indication whether one or more SIBs are
only provided on-demand and, in that case, the configuration needed by the UE
to perform the SI request. _SIB1_ is cell-specific SIB;
\- SIBs other than _SIB1_ and posSIBs are carried in _SystemInformation_ (SI)
messages, which are transmitted on the DL-SCH. Only SIBs or posSIBs having the
same periodicity can be mapped to the same SI message. SIBs and posSIBs are
mapped to different SI messages, _i.e. an SI message contains either only SIBs
or only posSIBs_. Each SI message is transmitted within periodically occurring
time domain windows (referred to as SI-windows with same length for all SI
messages). Each SI message is associated with an SI-window and the SI-windows
of different SI messages do not overlap. That is, within one SI-window only
the corresponding SI message is transmitted. An _SI message may be repeated
with the same content a number of times within the SI-window._ Any SIB or
posSIB except _SIB1_ can be configured to be cell specific or area specific,
using an indication in _SIB1_. The cell specific SIB is applicable only within
a cell that provides the SIB while the area specific SIB is applicable within
an area referred to as SI area, which consists of one or several cells and is
identified by s _ystemInformationAreaID_ ;
\- The mapping of SIBs to SI messages is configured in _schedulingInfoList_
and _schedulingInfoList2_ , while the mapping of posSIBs to SI messages is
configured in _posSchedulingInfoList_ and _schedulingInfoList2.\_ Each SIB and
each posSIB is mapped to a single SI message. posSIBs of the same _posSibType_
carrying GNSS Generic Assistance Data for different GNSS/SBAS (identified by
_gnss-id/sbas-id_ , see **TS 37.355** [49]) are mapped to different SI
messages.\ Each SIB and posSIB is contained at most once in an SI message.\
For SIBs and posSIBs with segments, the segments contained in SI messages are
transmitted according to the SI message periodicity, with one segment of a
particular _sibType_ /_posSibType_ in each SI message;
\- For a UE in RRC_CONNECTED, the network can provide system information
through dedicated signalling using the **_RRCReconfiguration message, e.g. if
the UE has an active BWP with no common search space configured to monitor
system information, paging, or upon request from the UE_**.
\- For PSCell and SCells, the network provides the required SI by dedicated
signalling, i.e. within an **_RRCReconfiguration message_**. Nevertheless, the
UE shall acquire _MIB_ of the PSCell to get SFN timing of the SCG (which may
be different from MCG). Upon change of relevant SI for SCell, the network
releases and adds the concerned SCell. For PSCell, the required SI can only be
changed with Reconfiguration with Sync.
NOTE 2: The physical layer imposes a limit to the maximum size a SIB can take.
The maximum _SIB1_ or _SI message_ size is 2976 bits.
### 5.2.2 System information acquisition
#### 5.2.2.1 General UE requirements
Figure 5.2.2.1-1: System information acquisition
The UE applies the SI acquisition procedure to acquire the AS, NAS- and
positioning assistance data information. The procedure applies to UEs in
RRC_IDLE, in RRC_INACTIVE and in RRC_CONNECTED.
The UE in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE shall ensure having a valid version of (at
least) the _MIB_ , _SIB1_ through _SIB4,_ _SIB5_ (if the UE supports E-UTRA),
_SIB11_ (if the UE is configured for idle/inactive measurements), _SIB12_ (if
UE is capable of NR sidelink communication/discovery and is configured by
upper layers to receive or transmit NR sidelink communication/discovery), and
_SIB13_ , _SIB14_ (if UE is capable of V2X sidelink communication and is
configured by upper layers to receive or transmit V2X sidelink communication),
_SIB15_ (if UE is configured by upper layers to report disaster roaming
related information), _SIB16_ (if the UE is capable of slice-based cell
reselection and the UE receives NSAG information for cell reselection from
upper layer), _SIB17_ (if the UE is using TRS resources for power saving in
RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE) and _SIB19_ (if UE is accessing NR via NTN access).
The UE capable of MBS broadcast which is receiving or interested to receive
MBS broadcast service(s) via a broadcast MRB shall ensure having a valid
version of _SIB20_ , regardless of the RRC state the UE is in.
The UE shall ensure having a valid version of the posSIB requested by upper
layers.
#### 5.2.2.2 SIB validity and need to (re)-acquire SIB
##### 5.2.2.2.1 SIB validity
The UE shall apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3
upon cell selection (e.g. upon power on), cell-reselection, return from out of
coverage, after reconfiguration with sync completion, after entering the
network from another RAT, upon receiving an indication that the system
information has changed, upon receiving a PWS notification, upon receiving
request (e.g., a positioning request) from upper layers; and whenever the UE
does not have a valid version of a stored SIB or posSIB or a valid version of
a requested SIB.
When the UE acquires a _MIB_ or a _SIB1_ or an SI message in a serving cell as
described in clause 5.2.2.3, and if the UE stores the acquired SIB, then the
UE shall store the associated _areaScope_ , if present, the first _PLMN-
Identity_ in the _PLMN-IdentityInfoList for non-NPN-only cells or the first
NPN identity (SNPN identity in case of SNPN, or PNI-NPN identity in case of
PNI-NPN) in the NPN-IdentityInfoList for NPN-only cells_ , the _cellIdentity_
, the _systemInformationAreaID_ , if present, and the _valueTag_ , if present,
as indicated in the _si-SchedulingInfo_ for the SIB. If the UE stores the
acquired posSIB, then the UE shall store the associated _areaScope_ , if
present, the _cellIdentity_ , the _systemInformationAreaID_ , if present, the
_valueTag_ , if provided in _assistanceDataSIB-Element_ , and the
_expirationTime_ if provided in _assistanceDataSIB-Element_. The UE may use a
valid stored version of the SI except _MIB_ , _SIB1_ , _SIB6_ , _SIB7_ or
_SIB8_ e.g. after cell re-selection, upon return from out of coverage or after
the reception of SI change indication. The _valueTag_ and _expirationTime_ for
posSIB is optionally provided in _assistanceDataSIB-Element_ , as specified in
TS 37.355 [49].
A L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE can inform the interested
SIB(s) to the connected L2 U2N Relay UE as defined in clause 5.8.9.8.2 and
receive the SIB(s) from the L2 U2N Relay UE as defined in clause 5.8.9.9.3. A
L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_CONNECTED receives SIB1 and other SIB(s) in
_RRCReconfiguration_ message and performs on-demand SI request if required, as
defined in clause 5.2.2.3.5 and 5.2.2.3.6. The L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or
RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED is not required to obtain SI over Uu interface,
but it may decide to perform the SI acquisition procedure over Uu interface as
defined in clause 5.2.2.3 by UE implementation.
NOTE: The storage and management of the stored SIBs in addition to the SIBs
valid for the current serving cell is left to UE implementation.
The UE shall:
1> delete any stored version of a SIB after 3 hours from the moment it was
successfully confirmed as valid;
1> for each stored version of a SIB:
2> if the _areaScope_ is associated and its value for the stored version of
the SIB is the same as the value received in the _si-SchedulingInfo_ for that
SIB from the serving cell:
3> if the UE is NPN capable and the cell is an NPN-only cell:
4> if the first NPN identity included in the _NPN-IdentityInfoList_ , the
_systemInformationAreaID_ and the v _alueTag_ that are included in the _si-
SchedulingInfo_ for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to
the NPN identity, the _systemInformationAreaID_ and the _valueTag_ associated
with the stored version of that SIB:
5> consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
3> else if the first _PLMN-Identity_ included in the _PLMN-IdentityInfoList_ ,
the _systemInformationAreaID_ and the v _alueTag_ that are included in the
_si-SchedulingInfo_ for the SIB received from the serving cell are identical
to the _PLMN-Identity_ , the _systemInformationAreaID_ and the _valueTag_
associated with the stored version of that SIB:
4> consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
2> if the _areaScope_ is not present for the stored version of the SIB and the
_areaScope_ value is not included in the _si-SchedulingInfo_ for that SIB from
the serving cell:
3> if the UE is NPN capable and the cell is an NPN-only cell:
4> if the first NPN identity in the _NPN-IdentityInfoList,_ the _cellIdentity_
and _valueTag_ that are included in the _si-SchedulingInfo_ for the SIB
received from the serving cell are identical to the NPN identity _,_ the
_cellIdentity_ and the _valueTag_ associated with the stored version of that
SIB:
5> consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
3> else if the first _PLMN-Identity_ in the _PLMN-IdentityInfoList,_ the
_cellIdentity_ and _valueTag_ that are included in the _si-SchedulingInfo_ for
the SIB received from the serving cell are identical to the _PLMN-Identity,_
the _cellIdentity_ and the _valueTag_ associated with the stored version of
that SIB:
4> consider the stored SIB as valid for the cell;
1> for each stored version of a posSIB:
2> if the _areaScope_ is associated and its value for the stored version of
the posSIB is the same as the value received in the _posSIB-MappingInfo_ for
that posSIB from the serving cell and the _systemInformationAreaID_ included
in the _si-SchedulingInfo_ is identical to the _systemInformationAreaID_
associated with the stored version of that posSIB:
3> if the _valueTag_ (see TS 37.355 [49]) for the posSIB received from the
serving cell is identical to the _valueTag_ associated with the stored version
of that posSIB; or if the _expirationTime_ (see TS 37.355 [49]) associated
with the stored posSIB has not been expired:
4> consider the stored posSIB as valid for the cell;
2> if the _areaScope_ is not present for the stored version of the posSIB and
the _areaScope_ value is not included in the _posSIB-MappingInfo_ for that
posSIB from the serving cell and the _cellIdentity_ for the posSIB received
from the serving cell is identical to the _cellIdentity_ associated with the
stored version of that posSIB:
3> if the _valueTag_ (see TS 37.355 [49]) for the posSIB received from the
serving cell is identical to the _valueTag_ associated with the stored version
of that posSIB; or if the _expirationTime_ (see TS 37.355 [49]) associated
with the stored posSIB has not been expired:
4> consider the stored posSIB as valid for the cell;
##### 5.2.2.2.2 SI change indication and PWS notification
A modification period is used, i.e. updated SI message (other than SI message
for ETWS, CMAS, positioning assistance data, and some NTN-specific information
as specified in the field descriptions ) is broadcasted in the modification
period following the one where SI change indication is transmitted. The
modification period boundaries are defined by SFN values for which SFN mod m =
0, where m is the number of radio frames comprising the modification period.
The modification period is configured by system information. If H-SFN is
provided in _SIB1_ , and UE is configured with eDRX, modification period
boundaries are defined by SFN values for which (H-SFN * 1024 + SFN) mod _m_ =
0.
For UEs in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE configured to use an IDLE eDRX cycle
longer than the modification period, an eDRX acquisition period is defined.
The boundaries of the eDRX acquisition period are determined by H-SFN values
for which H-SFN mod 1024 = 0.
The UE receives indications about SI modifications and/or PWS notifications
using Short Message transmitted with P-RNTI over DCI (see clause 6.5).
Repetitions of SI change indication may occur within preceding modification
period or within preceding eDRX acquisition period. SI change indication is
not applicable for SI messages containing posSIBs.
UEs in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is not ongoing shall
monitor for SI change indication in its own paging occasion(s) that the UE
monitors as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall monitor
for SI change indication in any paging occasion at least once per modification
period if the UE is provided with common search space, including
_pagingSearchSpace_ , _searchSpaceSIB1_ and
_searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ , on the active BWP to monitor paging, as
specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 13.
UEs in RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is ongoing shall monitor for SI change
indication in any paging occasion at least once per modification period, if
the initial downlink BWP on which the SDT procedure is ongoing is associated
with a CD-SSB.
During a modification period where ETWS or CMAS transmission is started or
stopped, the SI messages carrying the posSIBs scheduled in
_posSchedulingInfoList_ may change, so the UE might not be able to
successfully receive those posSIBs in the remainder of the current
modification period and next modification period according to the scheduling
information received prior to the change.
ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is
not ongoing shall monitor for indications about PWS notification in its own
paging occasion(s) that the UE monitors as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. ETWS
or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_CONNECTED shall monitor for indication about PWS
notification in any paging occasion at least once every _defaultPagingCycle_
if the UE is provided with common search space, including _pagingSearchSpace_
, _searchSpaceSIB1_ and _searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation,_ on the active BWP
to monitor paging.
ETWS or CMAS capable UEs in RRC_INACTIVE while SDT procedure is ongoing shall
monitor for indication about PWS notification in any paging occasion at least
once every _defaultPagingCycle_ , if the initial downlink BWP on which the SDT
procedure is ongoing is associated with a CD-SSB _._
For Short Message reception in a paging occasion, the UE monitors the PDCCH
monitoring occasion(s) for paging as specified in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 38.213
[13].
A L2 U2N Remote UE is not required to monitor paging occasion for SI
modifications and/or PWS notifications. It obtains the updated system
information and SIB6/7/8 from the connected L2 U2N Relay UE as defined in
clause 5.8.9.9.3.
If the UE receives a Short Message, the UE shall:
1> if the UE is ETWS capable or CMAS capable, the _etwsAndCmasIndication_ bit
of Short Message is set, and the UE is provided with _searchSpaceSIB1_ and
_searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ on the active BWP or the initial BWP:
2> immediately re-acquire the _SIB1_ ;
2> if the UE is ETWS capable and _si-SchedulingInfo_ includes scheduling
information for _SIB6_ :
3> acquire _SIB6_ , as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
2> if the UE is ETWS capable and _si-SchedulingInfo_ includes scheduling
information for _SIB7_ :
3> acquire _SIB7_ , as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
2> if the UE is CMAS capable and _si-SchedulingInfo_ includes scheduling
information for _SIB8_ :
3> acquire _SIB8_ , as specified in clause 5.2.2.3.2, immediately;
NOTE: In case _SIB6_ , _SIB7_ , or _SIB8_ overlap with a measurement gap it is
left to UE implementation how to immediately acquire _SIB6_ , _SIB7_ , or
_SIB8_.
1> if the UE does not operate an IDLE eDRX cycle longer than the modification
period and the _systemInfoModification_ bit of Short Message is set:
2> apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 from the
start of the next modification period;
1> if the UE operates an IDLE eDRX cycle longer than the modification period
and the _systemInfoModification-eDRX_ bit of Short Message is set:
2> apply the SI acquisition procedure as defined in clause 5.2.2.3 from the
start of the next eDRX acquisition period boundary.
#### 5.2.2.3 Acquisition of System Information
##### 5.2.2.3.1 Acquisition of _MIB_ and _SIB1_
The UE shall:
1> apply the specified BCCH configuration defined in 9.1.1.1;
1> if the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE; or
1> if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
2> acquire the _MIB,_ which is scheduled as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2> if the UE is unable to acquire the _MIB_ ;
3> perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;
2> else:
3> perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.1.
1> if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space
configured by _searchSpaceSIB1_ and _pagingSearchSpace_ and has received an
indication about change of system information; or
1> if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space
configured by _searchSpaceSIB1_ and the UE has not stored a valid version of a
SIB or posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several required
SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1, and, UE has not
acquired SIB1 in current modification period; or
1> if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with common search space
configured by _searchSpaceSIB1_ , and, the UE has not stored a valid version
of a SIB or posSIB, in accordance with clause 5.2.2.2.1, of one or several
required SIB(s) or posSIB(s) in accordance with clause 5.2.2.1, and, _si-
BroadcastStatus_ for the required SIB(s) or _posSI-BroadcastStatus_ for the
required posSIB(s) is set to _notbroadcasting_ in acquired _SIB1_ in current
modification period; or
1> if the UE is in RRC_IDLE or in RRC_INACTIVE; or
1> if the UE is in RRC_CONNECTED while T311 is running:
2> if _ssb-SubcarrierOffset_ indicates _SIB1_ is transmitted in the cell (TS
38.213 [13]) and if _SIB1_ acquisition is required for the UE:

3> if the UE is unable to acquire the _SIB1_ :
4> perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5;
3> else:
4> upon acquiring _SIB1_ , perform the actions specified in clause 5.2.2.4.2.
2> else if _SIB1_ acquisition is required for the UE and _ssb-
SubcarrierOffset_ indicates that _SIB1_ is not scheduled in the cell:
3> perform the actions as specified in clause 5.2.2.5.
NOTE 1: The UE in RRC_CONNECTED is only required to acquire broadcasted _SIB1_
and MBS broadcast if the UE can acquire it without disrupting unicast or MBS
multicast data reception, i.e., the broadcast and unicast/MBS multicast beams
are quasi co-located. The UE in RRC_INACTIVE state while SDT procedure is
ongoing, is only required to acquire broadcasted _SIB1_ and _MIB_ if the UE
can acquire them without disrupting unicast data reception, i.e. the broadcast
and unicast beams are quasi co-located.
NOTE 2: UE in RRC_INACTIVE that does not support _inactiveStateNTN-r17_ enters
RRC_IDLE upon cell reselection between TN cell and NTN cell, and initiates the
NAS signalling connection recovery (see TS 24.501 [23]).
##### 5.2.2.3.2 Acquisition of an SI message
For SI message acquisition PDCCH monitoring occasion(s) are determined
according to _searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_. If
_searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ is set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions
for SI message reception in SI-window are same as PDCCH monitoring occasions
for _SIB1_ where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is
specified in TS 38.213[13]. If _searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ is not set
to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for SI message are determined based on
search space indicated by _searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_. PDCCH
monitoring occasions for SI message which are not overlapping with UL symbols
(determined according to _tdd-UL-DL-ConfigurationCommon_) are sequentially
numbered from one in the SI window. The [x×N+K]^th^ PDCCH monitoring occasion
(s) for SI message in SI-window corresponds to the K^th^ transmitted SSB,
where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, ...N, N is the number of actual transmitted
SSBs determined according to _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _SIB1_ and X is equal
to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in SI-window/N). The actual
transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending order of
their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the SI window, PDCCH for an SI
message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH monitoring occasion corresponding
to each transmitted SSB and thus the selection of SSB for the reception SI
messages is up to UE implementation.
When acquiring an SI message, the UE shall:
1> determine the start of the SI-window for the concerned SI message as
follows:
2> if the concerned SI message is configured in the _schedulingInfoList_ :
3> for the concerned SI message, determine the number _n_ which corresponds to
the order of entry in the list of SI messages configured by
_schedulingInfoList_ in _si-SchedulingInfo_ in _SIB1_ ;
3> determine the integer value _x = (n -- 1) × w_ , where _w_ is the _si-
WindowLength_ ;
3> the SI-window starts at the slot #_a_ , where _a_ = _x_ mod N, in the radio
frame for which SFN mod _T_ = FLOOR(_x_ /N), where _T_ is the _si-Periodicity_
of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as
specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2> else if the concerned SI message is configured in the _schedulingInfoList2_
;
3> determine the integer value _x = (si-WindowPosition -1) × w_ , where _w_ is
the _si-WindowLength_ ;
3> the SI-window starts at the slot #_a_ , where _a_ = _x_ mod N, in the radio
frame for which SFN mod _T_ = FLOOR(_x_ /N), where _T_ is the _si-Periodicity_
of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a radio frame as
specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2> else if the concerned SI message is configured in the
_posSchedulingInfoList_ and _offsetToSI-Used_ is not configured:
3> create a concatenated list of SI messages by appending the
_posSchedulingInfoList_ in _posSI-SchedulingInfo_ in _SIB1 to
schedulingInfoList_ in _si-SchedulingInfo_ in _SIB1;_
3> for the concerned SI message, determine the number _n_ which corresponds to
the order of entry in the concatenated list;
3> determine the integer value _x = (n -- 1) × w_ , where _w_ is the _si-
WindowLength_ ;
3> the SI-window starts at the slot #_a_ , where _a_ = _x_ mod N, in the radio
frame for which SFN mod _T_ = FLOOR(_x_ /N), where _T_ is the _posSI-
Periodicity_ of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a
radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
2> else if the concerned SI message is configured by the
_posSchedulingInfoList_ and _offsetToSI-Used_ is configured:
3> determine the number _m_ which corresponds to the number of SI messages
with an associated _si-Periodicity_ of 8 radio frames (80 ms), configured by
_schedulingInfoList_ in _SIB1_ ;
3> for the concerned SI message, determine the number _n_ which corresponds to
the order of entry in the list of SI messages configured by
_posSchedulingInfoList_ in _SIB1_ ;
3> determine the integer value _x_ = _m_ _× w +_ (_n_ \-- 1 _)_ _× w_ , where
_w_ is the _si-WindowLength;_
3> the SI-window starts at the slot #_a_ , where _a_ = _x_ mod N, in the radio
frame for which SFN mod _T_ = FLOOR(_x_ /N) +8, where _T_ is the _posSI-
Periodicity_ of the concerned SI message and N is the number of slots in a
radio frame as specified in TS 38.213 [13];
1> receive the PDCCH containing the scheduling RNTI, i.e. SI-RNTI in the PDCCH
monitoring occasion(s) for SI message acquisition, from the start of the SI-
window and continue until the end of the SI-window whose absolute length in
time is given by _si-WindowLength_ , or until the SI message was received;
1> if the SI message was not received by the end of the SI-window, repeat
reception at the next SI-window occasion for the concerned SI message in the
current modification period;
1> if all the SIB(s) and/or posSIB(s) requested in _DedicatedSIBRequest_
message have been acquired:
2> stop timer T350, if running;
NOTE 1: The UE is only required to acquire broadcasted SI message if the UE
can acquire it without disrupting unicast or MBS multicast data reception,
i.e. the broadcast and unicast/MBS multicast beams are quasi co-located.
NOTE 2: The UE is not required to monitor PDCCH monitoring occasion(s)
corresponding to each transmitted SSB in SI-window.
NOTE 3: If the concerned SI message was not received in the current
modification period, handling of SI message acquisition is left to UE
implementation.
NOTE 4: A UE in RRC_CONNECTED may stop the PDCCH monitoring during the SI
window for the concerned SI message when the requested SIB(s) are acquired.
NOTE 5: A UE capable of NR sidelink communication/discovery and configured by
upper layers to perform NR sidelink communication/discovery on a frequency,
may acquire _SIB12_ or _SystemInformationBlockType28_ from a cell other than
current serving cell (for RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_IDLE) or current PCell (for
RRC_CONNECTED), if _SIB12_ of current serving cell (for RRC_INACTIVE or
RRC_IDLE) or current PCell (for RRC_CONNECTED) does not provide configuration
for NR sidelink communication/discovery for the frequency, and if the other
cell providing configuration for NR sidelink communication/discovery for the
frequency meets the S-criteria as defined in TS 38.304 [20] or TS 36.304 [27].

## 5.3 Connection control
### 5.3.1 Introduction
#### 5.3.1.1 RRC connection control
RRC connection establishment involves the establishment of SRB1. The network
completes RRC connection establishment prior to completing the establishment
of the NG connection, i.e. prior to receiving the UE context information from
the 5GC. Consequently, AS security is not activated during the initial phase
of the RRC connection. During this initial phase of the RRC connection, the
network may configure the UE to perform measurement reporting, but the UE only
sends the corresponding measurement reports after successful AS security
activation. However, the UE only accepts a re-configuration with sync message
when AS security has been activated.
Upon receiving the UE context from the 5GC, the RAN activates AS security
(both ciphering and integrity protection) using the initial AS security
activation procedure. The RRC messages to activate AS security (command and
successful response) are integrity protected, while ciphering is started only
after completion of the procedure. That is, the response to the message used
to activate AS security is not ciphered, while the subsequent messages (e.g.
used to establish SRB2, DRBs and multicast MRBs) are both integrity protected
and ciphered. After having initiated the initial AS security activation
procedure, the network may initiate the establishment of SRB2 and DRBs and/or
multicast MRBs, i.e. the network may do this prior to receiving the
confirmation of the initial AS security activation from the UE. In any case,
the network will apply both ciphering and integrity protection for the RRC
reconfiguration messages used to establish SRB2, DRBs and/or multicast MRBs.
The network should release the RRC connection if the initial AS security
activation and/ or the radio bearer establishment fails. A configuration with
SRB2 without DRB or multicast MRB, or with DRB or multicast MRB without SRB2
is not supported (i.e., SRB2 and at least one DRB or multicast MRB must be
configured in the same RRC Reconfiguration message, and it is not allowed to
release all the DRBs and multicast MRBs without releasing the RRC Connection).
For IAB-MT, a configuration with SRB2 without any DRB/MRB is supported.
The release of the RRC connection normally is initiated by the network. The
procedure may be used to re-direct the UE to an NR frequency or an E-UTRA
carrier frequency.
The suspension of the RRC connection is initiated by the network. When the RRC
connection is suspended, the UE stores the UE Inactive AS context and any
configuration received from the network, and transits to RRC_INACTIVE state.
The RRC message to suspend the RRC connection is integrity protected and
ciphered.
The resumption of a suspended RRC connection is initiated by upper layers when
the UE needs to transit from RRC_INACTIVE state to RRC_CONNECTED state or by
RRC layer to perform a RNA update or by RAN paging from NG-RAN or for SDT.
When the RRC connection is resumed, network configures the UE according to the
RRC connection resume procedure based on the stored UE Inactive AS context and
any RRC configuration received from the network. The RRC connection resume
procedure re-activates AS security and re-establishes SRB(s) and DRB(s) and/or
multicast MRB(s), if configured.
Upon initiating the resume procedure for SDT, AS security (both ciphering and
integrity protection) is re-activated for SRB2 (if configured for SDT) and for
SRB1. In addition, AS security is also re-activated (if security is
configured) for all the DRBs configured for SDT. Further, the PDCP entities of
SRB1 and PDCP entities of the radio bearers configured for SDT are re-
established and resumed whilst the UE remains in RRC_INACTIVE state.
Transmission and reception of data and/or signalling messages over radio
bearers configured for SDT can happen whilst the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE state
and SDT procedure is ongoing.
In response to a request to resume the RRC connection or in response to a
resume procedure initiated for SDT, the network may resume the suspended RRC
connection and send UE to RRC_CONNECTED, or reject the request to resume and
send UE to RRC_INACTIVE (with a wait timer), or directly re-suspend the RRC
connection and send UE to RRC_INACTIVE, or directly release the RRC connection
and send UE to RRC_IDLE, or instruct the UE to initiate NAS level recovery (in
this case the network sends an RRC setup message).
NOTE: In case the UE receives the configurations for NR sidelink communication
via the E-UTRA, the configurations for NR sidelink communication in _SIB12_
and _sl-ConfigDedicatedNR_ within _RRCReconfiguration_ used in clause 5.3 are
provided by the configurations in _SystemInformationBlockType28_ and _sl-
ConfigDedicatedForNR_ within _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ as specified in TS
36.331[10], respectively.
#### 5.3.1.2 AS Security
AS security comprises of the integrity protection and ciphering of RRC
signalling (SRBs) and user data (DRBs).
RRC handles the configuration of the AS security parameters which are part of
the AS configuration: the integrity protection algorithm, the ciphering
algorithm, if integrity protection and/or ciphering is enabled for a DRB and
two parameters, namely the _keySetChangeIndicator_ and the
_nextHopChainingCount_ , which are used by the UE to determine the AS security
keys upon reconfiguration with sync (with key change), connection re-
establishment and/or connection resume.
The integrity protection algorithm is common for SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 (if
configured), SRB4 (if configured) and DRBs configured with integrity
protection, with the same _keyToUse_ value. The ciphering algorithm is common
for SRB1, SRB2, SRB3 (if configured), SRB4 (if configured) and DRBs configured
with the same _keyToUse_ value. Neither integrity protection nor ciphering
applies for SRB0.
NOTE 0: All DRBs related to the same PDU session have the same enable/disable
setting for ciphering and the same enable/disable setting for integrity
protection, as specified in TS 33.501 [11].
RRC integrity protection and ciphering are always activated together, i.e. in
one message/procedure. RRC integrity protection and ciphering for SRBs are
never de-activated. However, it is possible to switch to a \'_NULL_ \'
ciphering algorithm (_nea0_).
The \'_NULL_ \' integrity protection algorithm (_nia0_) is used only for SRBs
and for the UE in limited service mode, see TS 33.501 [11] and when used for
SRBs, integrity protection is disabled for DRBs. In case the ′ _NULL_ \'
integrity protection algorithm is used, \'_NULL_ \' ciphering algorithm is
also used.
NOTE 1: Lower layers discard RRC messages for which the integrity protection
check has failed and indicate the integrity protection verification check
failure to RRC.
The AS applies four different security keys: one for the integrity protection
of RRC signalling (K~RRCint~), one for the ciphering of RRC signalling
(K~RRCenc~), one for integrity protection of user data (K~UPint~) and one for
the ciphering of user data (K~UPenc~). All four AS keys are derived from the
K~gNB~ key. The K~gNB~ key is based on the K~AMF~ key (as specified in TS
33.501 [11]), which is handled by upper layers.
The integrity protection and ciphering algorithms can only be changed with
reconfiguration with sync. The AS keys (K~gNB~, K~RRCint~, K~RRCenc~, K~UPint~
and K~UPenc~) change upon reconfiguration with sync (if _masterKeyUpdate_ is
included), and upon connection re-establishment and connection resume.
For each radio bearer an independent counter (_COUNT_ , as specified in TS
38.323 [5]) is maintained for each direction. For each radio bearer, the
_COUNT_ is used as input for ciphering and integrity protection.
It is not allowed to use the same _COUNT_ value more than once for a given
security key. As specified in TS 33.501 clause 6.9.4.1 [11], the network is
responsible for avoiding reuse of the _COUNT_ with the same RB identity and
with the same key, e.g. due to the transfer of large volumes of data, release
and establishment of new RBs, and multiple termination point changes for RLC-
UM bearers and multiple termination point changes for RLC-AM bearer with SN
terminated PDCP re-establishment (COUNT reset) due to SN only full
configuration whilst the key stream inputs (i.e. bearer ID, security key) at
MN have not been updated. In order to avoid such re-use, the network may e.g.
use different RB identities for RB establishments, change the AS security key,
or an RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE and then to RRC_CONNECTED
transition.
In order to limit the signalling overhead, individual messages/ packets
include a short sequence number (PDCP SN, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]). In
addition, an overflow counter mechanism is used: the hyper frame number (_HFN_
, as specified in TS 38.323 [5]). The HFN needs to be synchronized between the
UE and the network.
For each SRB, the value provided by RRC to lower layers to derive the 5-bit
BEARER parameter used as input for ciphering and for integrity protection is
the value of the corresponding _srb-Identity_ with the MSBs padded with
zeroes.
For a UE provided with an _sk-counter_ , _keyToUse_ indicates whether the UE
uses the master key (K~gNB~) or the secondary key (S-K~eNB~ or S-K~gNB~) for a
particular DRB. The secondary key is derived from the master key and _sk-
Counter_ , as defined in TS 33.501[11]. Whenever there is a need to refresh
the secondary key, e.g. upon change of MN with K~gNB~ change or to avoid COUNT
reuse, the security key update is used (see 5.3.5.7). When the UE is in NR-DC,
the network may provide a UE configured with an SCG with an _sk-Counter_ even
when no DRB is setup using the secondary key (S-K~gNB~) in order to allow the
configuration of SRB3. The network can also provide the UE with an _sk-
Counter_ , even if no SCG is configured, when using SN terminated MCG bearers.
### 5.3.2 Paging
#### 5.3.2.1 General
Figure 5.3.2.1-1: Paging
The purpose of this procedure is:
\- to transmit paging information to a UE in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE.
\- to transmit paging information for a L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE or
RRC_INACTIVE to its serving L2 U2N Relay UE in any RRC state.
#### 5.3.2.2 Initiation
The network initiates the paging procedure by transmitting the _Paging_
message at the UE\'s paging occasion as specified in TS 38.304 [20]. The
network may address multiple UEs within a _Paging_ message by including one
_PagingRecord_ for each UE. The network may also include one or multiple
TMGI(s) in the _Paging_ message to page UEs for specific MBS multicast
session(s).
#### 5.3.2.3 Reception of the _Paging_ _message_ by the UE or _PagingRecord_
by the L2 U2N Remote UE
Upon receiving the _Paging_ message by the UE or receiving _PagingRecord_ from
its connected L2 U2N Relay UE by a L2 U2N Remote UE, the UE shall:

### 5.3.3 RRC connection establishment
#### 5.3.3.1 General
Figure 5.3.3.1-1: RRC connection establishment, successful
Figure 5.3.3.1-2: RRC connection establishment, network reject
The purpose of this procedure is to establish an RRC connection. RRC
connection establishment involves SRB1 establishment. The procedure is also
used to transfer the initial NAS dedicated information/ message from the UE to
the network.
The network applies the procedure e.g.as follows:
\- When establishing an RRC connection;
\- When UE is resuming or re-establishing an RRC connection, and the network
is not able to retrieve or verify the UE context. In this case, UE receives
_RRCSetup_ and responds with _RRCSetupComplete_.
#### 5.3.3.1a Conditions for establishing RRC Connection for NR sidelink
communication/discovery/V2X sidelink communication
For NR sidelink communication/discovery, an RRC connection establishment is
initiated only in the following cases:
1> if configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink communication and
related data is available for transmission:
2> if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink
communication is included in _sl-FreqInfoList_ within _SIB12_ provided by the
cell on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of _SIB12_ does not
include _sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal_ for the concerned frequency;
1> if configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink discovery and related
data is available for transmission:
2> if the UE is configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink L2 U2N
relay discovery messages and _sl-L2U2N-Relay_ is included in _SIB12_ ; or
2> if the UE is configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink L3 U2N
relay discovery messages and _sl-L3U2N-RelayDiscovery_ is included in _SIB12_
; or
2> if the UE is configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink non-relay
discovery messages and _sl-NonRelayDiscovery_ is included in _SIB12_ :
3> if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink
discovery is included in _sl-FreqInfoList_ within _SIB12_ provided by the cell
on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of _SIB12_ includes neither
_sl-DiscTxPoolSelected_ nor _sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal_ for the concerned
frequency;
For L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_IDLE, an RRC connection establishment is initiated
in the following cases:
1> if any message is received from a L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 as specified
in 9.1.1.4 or SL-RLC1 as specified in 9.2.4;
For V2X sidelink communication, an RRC connection is initiated only when the
conditions specified for V2X sidelink communication in clause 5.3.3.1a of TS
36.331 [10] are met.
NOTE: Upper layers initiate an RRC connection (except if the RRC connection is
initiated at the L2 U2N Relay UE upon reception of a message from a L2 U2N
Remote UE via SL-RLC0 or SL-RLC1). The interaction with NAS is left to UE
implementation.
#### 5.3.3.2 Initiation
The UE initiates the procedure when upper layers request establishment of an
RRC connection while the UE is in RRC_IDLE and it has acquired essential
system information, or for sidelink communication as specified in clause
5.3.3.1a.
The UE shall ensure having valid and up to date essential system information
as specified in clause 5.2.2.2 before initiating this procedure.
Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:
1> if the upper layers provide an Access Category and one or more Access
Identities upon requesting establishment of an RRC connection:
2> perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14 using
the Access Category and Access Identities provided by upper layers;
3> if the access attempt is barred, the procedure ends;
1> if the upper layers provide NSAG information and one or more S-NSSAI(s)
triggering the access attempt (TS 23.501 [32] and TS 24.501 [23]):
2> apply the NSAG with highest NSAG priority among the NSAGs that are included
in _SIB1 (_ i.e., in _FeatureCombination and/or_ in _RA-
PrioritizationSliceInfo),_ and that are associated with the S-NSSAI(s)
triggering the access attempt, in the Random Access procedure (TS 38.321 [3],
clause 5.1);
_NOTE:_ If there are multiple NSAGs with the same highest NAS-provided NSAG
priority identified for access attempt as above _, it_ is left to UE
implementation to select the NSAG to be applied in the Random Access
procedure.
1> if the UE is acting as L2 U2N Remote UE:
2> establish a SRAP entity as specified in TS 38.351 [66], if no SRAP entity
has been established;
2> apply the specified configuration of SL-RLC0 as specified in 9.1.1.4;
2> apply the SDAP configuration and PDCP configuration as specified in 9.1.1.2
for SRB0;

2> apply the CCCH configuration as specified in 9.1.1.2;
2> apply the _timeAlignmentTimerCommon_ included in _SIB1_ ;
1> start timer T300;
1> initiate transmission of the _RRCSetupRequest_ message in accordance with
5.3.3.3;
#### 5.3.3.3 Actions related to transmission of _RRCSetupRequest_ message
The UE shall set the contents of _RRCSetupRequest_ message as follows:
1> set the _ue-Identity_ as follows:
2> if upper layers provide a 5G-S-TMSI:
3> set the _ue-Identity_ to _ng-5G-S-TMSI-Part1_ ;
2> else:
3> draw a 39-bit random value in the range 0..2^39^-1 and set the _ue-
Identity_ to this value;
NOTE 1: Upper layers provide the _5G-S-TMSI_ if the UE is registered in the TA
of the current cell.
1> if the establishment of the RRC connection is the result of release with
redirect with _mpsPriorityIndication_ (either in NR or E-UTRAN):
2> set the _establishmentCause_ to _mps-PriorityAccess_ ;
1> else:
2> set the _establishmentCause_ in accordance with the information received
from upper layers;
NOTE 2: In case the L2 U2N Relay UE initiates RRC connection establishment
triggered by reception of message from a L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 or SL-
RLC1 as specified in 5.3.3.1a, the L2 U2N Relay UE sets the
_establishmentCause_ by implementation, but it can only set the _emergency_ ,
_mps-PriorityAccess_ , or _mcs-PriorityAccess_ as _establishmentCause_ if the
same cause value is in the message received from the L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-
RLC0.
1> if _ta-Report_ is configured with value _enabled_ and the UE supports TA
reporting:
2> indicate TA report initiation to lower layers;
The UE shall submit the _RRCSetupRequest_ message to lower layers for
transmission.
If the UE is a RedCap UE and the RedCap-specific initial downlink BWP is not
associated with CD-SSB, the UE may continue cell re-selection related
measurements as well as cell re-selection evaluation, otherwise the UE shall
continue cell re-selection related measurements as well as cell re-selection
evaluation. If the conditions for cell re-selection are fulfilled, the UE
shall perform cell re-selection as specified in 5.3.3.6.
NOTE 3: For L2 U2N Remote UE in RRC_IDLE, the cell (re)selection procedure as
specified in TS 38.304 [20] and relay (re)selection procedure as specified in
5.8.15.3 are performed independently and up to UE implementation to select
either a cell or a L2 U2N Relay UE.
#### 5.3.3.4 Reception of the _RRCSetup_ by the UE
The UE shall perform the following actions upon reception of the _RRCSetup_ :
1> if the _RRCSetup_ is received in response to an _RRCReestablishmentRequest_
; or
1> if the _RRCSetup_ is received in response to an _RRCResumeRequest_ or

#### 5.3.4.1 General
Figure 5.3.4.1-1: Security mode command, successful
Figure 5.3.4.1-2: Security mode command, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to activate AS security upon RRC connection
establishment.
#### 5.3.4.2 Initiation
The network initiates the security mode command procedure to a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED. Moreover, the network applies the procedure as follows:
\- when only SRB1 is established, i.e. prior to establishment of SRB2,
multicast MRBs and/ or DRBs.

indicated algorithm and the K~RRCint~ key immediately, i.e. integrity
protection shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent by
the UE, including the _SecurityModeComplete_ message;
2> configure lower layers to apply SRB ciphering using the indicated
algorithm, the K~RRCenc~ keyafter completing the procedure, i.e. ciphering
shall be applied to all subsequent messages received and sent by the UE,
except for the _SecurityModeComplete_ message which is sent unciphered;
2> consider AS security to be activated;
2> submit the _SecurityModeComplete_ message to lower layers for transmission,

### 5.3.5 RRC reconfiguration
#### 5.3.5.1 General
Figure 5.3.5.1-1: RRC reconfiguration, successful
Figure 5.3.5.1-2: RRC reconfiguration, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to modify an RRC connection, e.g. to
establish/modify/release RBs/BH RLC channels/Uu Relay RLC channels/PC5 Relay
RLC channels, to perform reconfiguration with sync, to setup/modify/release
measurements, to add/modify/release SCells and cell groups, to
add/modify/release conditional handover configuration, to add/modify/release
conditional PSCell change or conditional PSCell addition configuration. As
part of the procedure, NAS dedicated information may be transferred from the
Network to the UE.
RRC reconfiguration to perform reconfiguration with sync includes, but is not
limited to, the following cases:
\- reconfiguration with sync and security key refresh, involving RA to the
PCell/PSCell, MAC reset, refresh of security and re-establishment of RLC and
PDCP triggered by explicit indicators;
\- reconfiguration with sync but without security key refresh, involving RA to
the PCell/PSCell, MAC reset and RLC re-establishment and PDCP data recovery
(for AM DRB or AM MRB) triggered by explicit indicators.
\- reconfiguration with sync for DAPS and security key refresh, involving RA
to the target PCell, establishment of target MAC, and
\- for non-DAPS bearer: refresh of security and re-establishment of RLC and
PDCP triggered by explicit indicators;
\- for DAPS bearer: establishment of RLC for the target PCell, refresh of
security and reconfiguration of PDCP to add the ciphering function, the
integrity protection function and ROHC function of the target PCell;
\- for SRB: refresh of security and establishment of RLC and PDCP for the
target PCell;
\- reconfiguration with sync for DAPS but without security key refresh,
involving RA to the target PCell, establishment of target MAC, and
\- for non-DAPS bearer: RLC re-establishment and PDCP data recovery (for AM
DRB or AM MRB) triggered by explicit indicators.
\- for DAPS bearer: establishment of RLC for target PCell, reconfiguration of
PDCP to add the ciphering function, the integrity protection function and ROHC
function of the target PCell;
\- for SRB: establishment of RLC and PDCP for the target PCell.
\- reconfiguration with sync for direct-to-indirect path switch, not involving
RA at target side, involving re-establishment of PDCP /PDCP data recovery (for
AM DRB) triggered by explicit indicators.
In (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, SRB3 can be used for measurement configuration and
reporting, for UE assistance (re-)configuration and reporting for power
savings, for IP address (re-)configuration and reporting for IAB-nodes, to
(re-)configure MAC, RLC, BAP, physical layer and RLF timers and constants of
the SCG configuration, and to reconfigure PDCP for DRBs associated with the
S-K~gNB~ or SRB3, and to reconfigure SDAP for DRBs associated with S-K~gNB~ in
NGEN-DC and NR-DC, and to add/modify/release conditional PSCell change
configuration, provided that the (re-)configuration does not require any MN
involvement, and to transmit RRC messages between the MN and the UE during
fast MCG link recovery. In (NG)EN-DC and NR-DC, only _measConfig_ ,
_radioBearerConfig, conditionalReconfiguration, bap-Config_ , _iab-IP-
AddressConfigurationList, otherConfig_ and/or _secondaryCellGroup_ are
included in _RRCReconfiguration_ received via SRB3, except when
_RRCReconfiguration_ is received within _DLInformationTransferMRDC_.
#### 5.3.5.2 Initiation
The Network may initiate the RRC reconfiguration procedure to a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED. The Network applies the procedure as follows:
\- the establishment of RBs (other than SRB1, that is established during RRC
connection establishment) is performed only when AS security has been
activated;
\- the establishment of BH RLC Channels for IAB is performed only when AS
security has been activated;
\- the establishment of Uu Relay RLC channels and PC5 Relay RLC channels
(other than SL-RLC0 and SL-RLC1) for L2 U2N Relay UE is performed only when AS
security has been activated, and the establishment of PC5 Relay RLC channels
for L2 U2N Remote UE (other than SL-RLC0 and SL-RLC1) is performed only when
AS security has been activated;
\- the addition of Secondary Cell Group and SCells is performed only when AS
security has been activated;
\- the _reconfigurationWithSync_ is included in _secondaryCellGroup_ only when
at least one RLC bearer or BH RLC channel is setup in SCG;
\- the _reconfigurationWithSync_ is included in _masterCellGroup_ only when AS
security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB or multicast MRB
or, for IAB, SRB2, are setup and not suspended;
\- the _conditionalReconfiguration_ for CPC is included only when at least one
RLC bearer is setup in SCG;
\- the _conditionalReconfiguration_ for CHO or CPA is included only when AS
security has been activated, and SRB2 with at least one DRB or multicast MRB
or, for IAB, SRB2, are setup and not suspended.

NOTE 1: The UE should perform the reconfiguration with sync as soon as
possible following the reception of the RRC message triggering the
reconfiguration with sync, which could be before confirming successful
reception (HARQ and ARQ) of this message.
NOTE 2: The UE may omit reading the _MIB_ if the UE already has the required
timing information, or the timing information is not needed for random access.

2> release the corresponding logical channel.
##### 5.3.5.5.4 RLC bearer addition/modification
For each _RLC-BearerConfig_ received in the _rlc-BearerToAddModList_ IE the UE
shall:
1> if the UE\'s current configuration contains an RLC bearer with the received
_logicalChannelIdentity/LogicalChannelIdentityExt_ within the same cell group:

LogicalChannelConfig_ ;
3> if _servedMBS-RadioBearer_ is received:
4> associate this logical channel with the PDCP entity identified by
_servedMBS-RadioBearer_ ;
NOTE 1: For DRB and SRB, the network does not re-associate an already
configured logical channel with another radio bearer. Hence,
_servedRadioBearer_ is not present in this case. For MRB, the network does not
re-associate an already configured logical channel with DRB or SRB or another
MRB (i.e. MRB with another PDCP entity). Hence _multicastRLC-BearerConfig_ is
not present in this case. If a radio bearer is released and another is added
with the same radio bearer identity, it is considered as a new (different)
radio bearer. Hence, the network also releases the RLC bearer(s) associated
with the released radio bearer.
NOTE 2: In DAPS handover, the UE may perform RLC entity re-establishment (if
_reestablishRLC_ is set) for an RLC bearer associated with a non-DAPS bearer
when indication of successful completion of random access towards target cell
is received from lower layers as specified in TS 38.321 [3].

NOTE 1: Void.
NOTE 2: When determining whether a _drb-Identity_ value is part of the current
UE configuration, the UE does not distinguish which _RadioBearerConfig_ and
_DRB-ToAddModList_ that DRB was originally configured in. To re-associate a
DRB with a different key (K~eNB~ to S-K~gNB~, K~gNB~ to S-K~eNB~, K~gNB~ to
S-K~gNB~, or vice versa), the network provides the _drb-Identity_ value in the
(target) _drb-ToAddModList_ and sets the _reestablishPDCP_ flag. The network
does not list the _drb-Identity_ in the (source) _drb-ToReleaseList_.
NOTE 3: When setting the _reestablishPDCP_ flag for a radio bearer, the
network ensures that the RLC receiver entities do not deliver old PDCP PDUs to
the re-established PDCP entity. It does that e.g. by triggering a
reconfiguration with sync of the cell group hosting the old RLC entity or by
releasing the old RLC entity.
NOTE 4: In this specification, UE configuration refers to the parameters
configured by NR RRC unless otherwise stated.
NOTE 5: Ciphering and integrity protection can be enabled or disabled for a
DRB. The enabling/disabling of ciphering or integrity protection can be
changed only by releasing and adding the DRB.
NOTE 6: In DAPS handover, the UE may perform PDCP entity re-establishment (if
_reestablishPDCP_ is set) or the PDCP data recovery (if _recoverPDCP_ is set)
for a non-DAPS bearer when indication of successful completion of random
access towards target cell is received from lower layers as specified in TS
38.321 [3]. In this case, the UE suspends data transmission and reception for
all non-DAPS bearers in the source MCG for duration of the DAPS handover.
##### 5.3.5.6.6 Multicast MRB release
The UE shall:
1> for each _mrb-Identity_ value included in the _mrb-ToReleaseList_ that is
part of the current UE configuration; or
1> for each _mrb-Identity_ value that is to be released as the result of full
configuration according to 5.3.5.11:
2> release the PDCP entity and the _mrb-Identity_ ;
NOTE 1: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the _mrb-
ToReleaseList_ includes any _mrb-Identity_ value that is not part of the
current UE configuration.
NOTE 2: Whether or not the RLC and MAC entities associated with this PDCP
entity are reset or released is determined by the _CellGroupConfig_.
##### 5.3.5.6.7 Multicast MRB addition/modification
The UE shall for each element in the order of entry in the list _mrb-
ToAddModList_ :
1> if _mrb-Identity_ value included in the _mrb-ToAddModList_ is part of the
UE configuration:
2> if _mrb-Identity_ value included in the _mrb-ToAddModList_ for which _mrb-
IdentityNew_ is included (i.e., multicast MRB ID change):
3> update the _mrb-Identity_ to the value _mrb-IdentityNew_ ;
2> if the _reestablishPDCP_ is set:
3> if _drb-ContinueROHC_ is included in _pdcp-Config_ :
4> indicate to lower layer that _drb-ContinueROHC_ is configured;
3> if _drb-ContinueEHC-DL_ is included in _pdcp-Config_ :
4> indicate to lower layer that _drb-ContinueEHC-DL_ is configured;
3> re-establish the PDCP entity of this multicast MRB as specified in TS
38.323 [5], clause 5.1.2;
2> else, if the _recoverPDCP_ is set:
3> trigger the PDCP entity of this MRB to perform data recovery as specified
in TS 38.323 [5];
2> if the _pdcp-Config_ is included:
3> reconfigure the PDCP entity in accordance with the received _pdcp-Config_ ;
1> else if _mrb-Identity_ value included in the _mrb-ToAddModList_ is not part
of the UE configuration (i.e., multicast MRB establishment including the case
when full configuration option is used):
2> establish a PDCP entity and configure it in accordance with the received
_pdcp-Config_ ;
2> associate the established multicast MRB with the corresponding _mbs-
SessionId_ ;
2> if an SDAP entity with the received _mbs-SessionId_ does not exist:
3> establish an SDAP entity as specified in TS 37.324 [24] clause 5.1.1;
3> if an SDAP entity with the received _mbs-SessionId_ did not exist prior to
receiving this reconfiguration:
4> indicate the establishment of the user plane resources for the _mbs-
SessionId_ to upper layers.
NOTE 1: When setting the _reestablishPDCP_ flag for a radio bearer, the
network ensures that the RLC receiver entities do not deliver old PDCP PDUs to
the re-established PDCP entity. The network does that e.g. by triggering a
reconfiguration with sync of the cell group hosting the old RLC entity or by
releasing the old RLC entity.
NOTE 2: In this specification, UE configuration refers to the parameters
configured by NR RRC unless otherwise stated.
NOTE 3: When updating the _mrb-Identity_ , the network ensures new MRBs are
listed at the end of the _mrb-ToAddModList_ if they have the same MRB ID as in
the existing UE configuration.
#### 5.3.5.7 AS Security key update
The UE shall:
1> if UE is connected to E-UTRA/EPC or E-UTRA/5GC:
2> upon reception of _sk-Counter_ as specified in TS 36.331 [10]:
3> update the S-K~gNB~ key based on the K~eNB~ key and using the received _sk-
Counter_ value, as specified in TS 33.401 [30] for EN-DC, or TS 33.501 [11]
for NGEN-DC;

2> if the _keySetChangeIndicator_ is set to _true_ :
3> derive or update the K~gNB~ key based on the K~AMF~ key, as specified in TS
33.501 [11];
2> else:
3> derive or update the K~gNB~ key based on the current K~gNB~ key or the NH,
using the _nextHopChainingCount_ value indicated in the received
_masterKeyUpdate_ , as specified in TS 33.501 [11];
2> store the _nextHopChainingCount_ value;
2> derive the keys associated with the K~gNB~ key as follows:
3> if the _securityAlgorithmConfig_ is included in _SecurityConfig_ :
4> derive the K~RRCenc~ and K~UPenc~ keys associated with the
_cipheringAlgorithm_ indicated in the _securityAlgorithmConfig,_ as specified
in TS 33.501 [11];
4> derive the K~RRCint~ and K~UPint~ keys associated with the
_integrityProtAlgorithm_ indicated in the _securityAlgorithmConfig,_ as
specified in TS 33.501 [11];
3> else:
4> derive the K~RRCenc~ and K~UPenc~ keys associated with the current
_cipheringAlgorithm,_ as specified in TS 33.501 [11];
4> derive the K~RRCint~ and K~UPint~ keys associated with the current
_integrityProtAlgorithm,_ as specified in TS 33.501 [11].
NOTE 1: Ciphering and integrity protection are optional to configure for the
DRBs.
1> else if this procedure was initiated due to reception of the _sk-Counter_
(UE is in NE-DC, or NR-DC, or is configured with SN terminated bearer(s)):
2> derive or update the secondary key (S-K~gNB~ or S-KeNB) based on the KgNB
key and using the received _sk-Counter_ value, as specified in TS 33.501 [11];
2> derive the K~RRCenc~ key and the K~UPenc~ key as specified in TS 33.501
[11] using the ciphering algorithms indicated in the _RadioBearerConfig_
associated with the secondary key (S-K~gNB~ or S-KeNB) as indicated by
_keyToUse_ ;
2> derive the K~RRCint~ key and the K~UPint~ key as specified in TS 33.501
[11] using the integrity protection algorithms indicated in the
_RadioBearerConfig_ associated with the secondary key (S-K~gNB~ or S-KeNB) as
indicated by _keyToUse_ ;
NOTE 2: If the UE has no radio bearer configured with _keyToUse_ set to
_secondary_ and receives the _sk-Counter_ without any _RadioBearerConfig_ with
_keyToUse_ set to _secondary_ , the UE does not consider it as an invalid
reconfiguration.

includes other configurations like _MeasConfig_. Radio configuration also
includes the RLC bearer configurations as configured by _RLC-BearerConfig_ ,
PC5 Relay RLC channel as configured by _SL-RLC-ChannelConfig_ , and Uu Relay
RLC channel as configured by _Uu-RelayRLC-ChannelConfig_. In case NR-DC or NE-
DC is configured, this also includes the entire NR or E-UTRA SCG configuration
which are released according to the MR-DC release procedure as specified in
5.3.5.10.
NOTE 1a: For NR sidelink communication/discovery, the radio configuration
includes the sidelink RRC configuration received from the network, but does
not include the sidelink RRC reconfiguration and sidelink UE capability
received from other UEs via PC5-RRC. In addition, the UE considers the new NR
sidelink configurations as full configuration, in case of state transition and
change of system information used for NR sidelink communication/discovery.
NOTE 1b: To establish the RLC bearer of SRB(s) after release due to
_fullConfig_ , the network can include the _srb-Identity_ within _srb-

identity_ of these bearers from the current UE configuration. Setup of the
DRBs within the AS is described in clause 5.3.5.6.5 using the new
configuration. The _pdu-Session_ acts as the anchor for associating the
released and re-setup DRB. In the AS the DRB re-setup is equivalent with a new
DRB setup (including new PDCP and logical channel configurations).

including _mrb-identity_ of these bearers from the current UE configuration.
Setup of the multicast MRBs within the AS is described in clause 5.3.5.6.7
using the new configuration. The _mbs-SessionId_ acts as the anchor for
associating the released and re-setup multicast MRB. In the AS the multicast
MRB re-setup is equivalent with a new multicast MRB setup (including new PDCP
and logical channel configurations).
1> for each _pdu-Session_ that is part of the current UE configuration but not
added with same _pdu-Session_ in the _drb-ToAddModList_ :
2> if the procedure was triggered due to reconfiguration with sync:
3> indicate the release of the user plane resources for the _pdu-Session_ to
upper layers after successful reconfiguration with sync;
2> else:
3> indicate the release of the user plane resources for the _pdu-Session_ to
upper layers immediately;
1> for each _mbs-SessionId_ that is part of the current UE configuration but
not added with the same _mbs-SessionId_ in the _mrb-ToAddModList_ :

#### 5.3.5.13 Conditional Reconfiguration
##### 5.3.5.13.1 General
The network configures the UE with one or more candidate target SpCells in the
conditional reconfiguration. The UE evaluates the condition of each configured
candidate target SpCell. The UE applies the conditional reconfiguration
associated with one of the target SpCells which fulfils associated execution
condition. The network provides the configuration parameters for the target
SpCell in the _condRRCReconfig_.
In NR-DC, the UE may receive two independent _conditionalReconfiguration_ :
\- a _conditionalReconfiguration_ associated with MCG, that is included in the
_RRCReconfiguration_ message received via SRB1; and
\- a _conditionalReconfiguration_ , associated with SCG, that is included in
the _RRCReconfiguration_ message received via SRB3, or, alternatively,
included within a _RRCReconfiguration_ message embedded in a
_RRCReconfiguration_ message received via SRB1.
In this case:
\- the UE maintains two independent _VarConditionalReconfig_ , one associated
with each _conditionalReconfiguration_ ;
\- the UE independently performs all the procedures in clause 5.3.5.13 for
each _conditionalReconfiguration_ and the associated _VarConditionalReconfig_
, unless explicitly stated otherwise;
\- the UE performs the procedures in clause 5.5 for the
_VarConditionalReconfig_ associated with the same cell group like the
_measConfig_.
In EN-DC, the _VarConditionalReconfig_ is associated with the SCG.
In NE-DC and when no SCG is configured, the _VarConditionalReconfig_ is
associated with the MCG.
The UE performs the following actions based on a received
_ConditionalReconfiguration_ IE:
1> if the _ConditionalReconfiguration_ contains the _condReconfigToRemoveList_
:
2> perform conditional reconfiguration removal procedure as specified in
5.3.5.13.2;
1> if the _ConditionalReconfiguration_ contains the _condReconfigToAddModList_
:
2> perform conditional reconfiguration addition/modification as specified in
5.3.5.13.3;
##### 5.3.5.13.2 Conditional reconfiguration removal
The UE shall:
1> for each _condReconfigId_ value included in the _condReconfigToRemoveList_
that is part of the current UE conditional reconfiguration in
_VarConditionalReconfig_ :
2> remove the entry with the matching _condReconfigId_ from the
_VarConditionalReconfig_ ;
NOTE: The UE does not consider the message as erroneous if the
_condReconfigToRemoveList_ includes any cond _ReconfigId_ value that is not
part of the current UE configuration.
##### 5.3.5.13.3 Conditional reconfiguration addition/modification
For each _condReconfigId_ received in the _condReconfigToAddModList_ IE the UE
shall:
1> if an entry with the matching _condReconfigId_ exists in the
_condReconfigToAddModList_ within the _VarConditionalReconfig_ :
2> if the entry in _condReconfigToAddModList_ includes an _condExecutionCond
or condExecutionCondSCG_ ;
3> replace _condExecutionCond_ or _condExecutionCondSCG_ within the
_VarConditionalReconfig_ with the value received for this _condReconfigId_ ;
2> if the entry in _condReconfigToAddModList_ includes an _condRRCReconfig_ ;
3> replace _condRRCReconfig_ within the _VarConditionalReconfig_ with the
value received for this _condReconfigId_ ;
1> else:
2> add a new entry for this _condReconfigId_ within the
_VarConditionalReconfig_ ;
1> perform conditional reconfiguration evaluation as specified in 5.3.5.13.4;
##### 5.3.5.13.4 Conditional reconfiguration evaluation
The UE shall:
1> for each _condReconfigId_ within the _VarConditionalReconfig_ :
2> if the _RRCReconfiguration_ within _condRRCReconfig_ includes the
_masterCellGroup_ including the _reconfigurationWithSync_ :
3> consider the cell which has a physical cell identity matching the value
indicated in the _ServingCellConfigCommon_ included in the
_reconfigurationWithSync_ within the _masterCellGroup_ in the received
_condRRCReconfig_ to be applicable cell;
2> else if the _RRCReconfiguration_ within _condRRCReconfig_ includes the
_secondaryCellGroup_ including the _reconfigurationWithSync_ :
3> consider the cell which has a physical cell identity matching the value
indicated in the _ServingCellConfigCommon_ included in the
_reconfigurationWithSync_ within the _secondaryCellGroup_ within the received
_condRRCReconfig_ to be applicable cell;

### 5.3.6 Counter check
#### 5.3.6.1 General
Figure 5.3.6.1-1: Counter check procedure
The counter check procedure is used by the network to request the UE to verify
the amount of data sent/ received on each DRB. More specifically, the UE is
requested to check if, for each DRB, the most significant bits of the COUNT
match with the values indicated by the network.
NOTE: The procedure enables the network to detect packet insertion by an
intruder (a \'man in the middle\').
#### 5.3.6.2 Initiation
The network initiates the procedure by sending a _CounterCheck_ message.
NOTE: The network may initiate the procedure when any of the COUNT values
reaches a specific value.
#### 5.3.6.3 Reception of the _CounterCheck_ message by the UE
Upon receiving the _CounterCheck_ message, the UE shall:
1> for each DRB that is established:
2> if no COUNT exists for a given direction (uplink or downlink) because it is
a uni-directional bearer configured only for the other direction:
3> assume the COUNT value to be 0 for the unused direction;
2> if the _drb-Identity_ is not included in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ :
3> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ set to the value of TX_NEXT -- 1 and RX_NEXT -- 1 (specified in TS
38.323 [5]), respectively;
2> else if, for at least one direction, the most significant bits of the COUNT
are different from the value indicated in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ :
3> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ set to the value of TX_NEXT -- 1 and RX_NEXT -- 1 (specified in TS
38.323 [5]), respectively;
1> for each DRB that is included in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ in the
_CounterCheck_ message that is not established:
2> include the DRB in the _drb-CountInfoList_ in the _CounterCheckResponse_
message by including the _drb-Identity_ , the _count-Uplink_ and the _count-
Downlink_ with the most significant bits set identical to the corresponding
values in the _drb-CountMSB-InfoList_ and the least significant bits set to
zero;

upon which the procedure ends.
### 5.3.7 RRC connection re-establishment
#### 5.3.7.1 General
Figure 5.3.7.1-1: RRC connection re-establishment, successful
Figure 5.3.7.1-2: RRC re-establishment, fallback to RRC establishment,
successful
The purpose of this procedure is to re-establish the RRC connection. A UE in
RRC_CONNECTED, for which AS security has been activated with SRB2 and at least
one DRB/multicast MRB setup or, for IAB, SRB2, may initiate the procedure in
order to continue the RRC connection. The connection re-establishment succeeds
if the network is able to find and verify a valid UE context or, if the UE
context cannot be retrieved, and the network responds with an _RRCSetup_
according to clause 5.3.3.4.
The network applies the procedure e.g as follows:
\- When AS security has been activated and the network retrieves or verifies
the UE context:
\- to re-activate AS security without changing algorithms;
\- to re-establish and resume the SRB1;
\- When UE is re-establishing an RRC connection, and the network is not able
to retrieve or verify the UE context:
\- to discard the stored AS Context and release all RBs and BH RLC channels
and Uu Relay RLC channels;
\- to fallback to establish a new RRC connection.
If AS security has not been activated, the UE shall not initiate the procedure

### 5.3.8 RRC connection release
#### 5.3.8.1 General
Figure 5.3.8.1-1: RRC connection release, successful
The purpose of this procedure is:
\- to release the RRC connection, which includes the release of the
established radio bearers (except for broadcast MRBs), BH RLC channels, Uu
Relay RLC channels, PC5 Relay RLC channels as well as all radio resources; or
\- to suspend the RRC connection only if SRB2 and at least one DRB or
multicast MRB or, for IAB, SRB2, are setup, which includes the suspension of
the established radio bearers (except for broadcast MRBs).
#### 5.3.8.2 Initiation
The network initiates the RRC connection release procedure to transit a UE in
RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_IDLE; or to transit a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to RRC_INACTIVE
only if SRB2 and at least one DRB or multicast MRB or, for IAB, SRB2, is setup
in RRC_CONNECTED; or to transit a UE in RRC_INACTIVE back to RRC_INACTIVE when
the UE tries to resume (for resuming a suspended RRC connection or for
initiating SDT); or to transit a UE in RRC_INACTIVE to RRC_IDLE when the UE
tries to resume (for resuming of a suspended RRC connection or for initiating
SDT). The procedure can also be used to release and redirect a UE to another
frequency.
#### 5.3.8.3 Reception of the _RRCRelease_ by the UE
The UE shall:

3> after the cell selection, indicate the available CN Type(s) and the
received _cnType_ to upper layers;
NOTE 1: Handling the case if the E-UTRA cell selected after the redirection
does not support the core network type specified by the _cnType,_ is up to UE
implementation.

successful
Figure 5.3.13.1-4: RRC connection resume followed by network suspend,
successful
Figure 5.3.13.1-5: RRC connection resume, network reject
The purpose of this procedure is to resume a suspended RRC connection,
including resuming SRB(s), DRB(s) and multicast MRB(s) or perform an RNA
update. This procedure is also used to initiate SDT in RRC_INACTIVE.
#### 5.3.13.1a Conditions for resuming RRC Connection for NR sidelink
communication/discovery/V2X sidelink communication
For NR sidelink communication/discovery an RRC connection is resumed only in
the following cases:
1> if configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink communication and
related data is available for transmission:
> 2> if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink
> communication is included in _sl-FreqInfoList_ within _SIB12_ provided by
> the cell on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of _SIB12_ does not
> include _sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal_ for the concerned frequency;
1> if configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink discovery and related
data is available for transmission:
2> if the UE is configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink L2 U2N
relay discovery messages and _sl-L2U2N-Relay_ is included in _SIB12_ ; or
2> if the UE is configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink L3 U2N
relay discovery messages and _sl-L3U2N-RelayDiscovery_ is included in _SIB12_
; or
2> if the UE is configured by upper layers to transmit NR sidelink non-relay
discovery messages and _sl-NonRelayDiscovery_ is included in _SIB12_ :
3> if the frequency on which the UE is configured to transmit NR sidelink
discovery is included in _sl-FreqInfoList_ within _SIB12_ provided by the cell
on which the UE camps; and if the valid version of _SIB12_ does not include
_sl-DiscTxPoolSelected_ or _sl-TxPoolSelectedNormal_ for the concerned
frequency;
For L2 U2N Relay UE in RRC_INACTIVE, an RRC connection establishment is
resumed in the following cases:
1> if any message is received from the L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 as
specified in 9.1.1.4 or SL-RLC1 as specified in 9.2.4;
For V2X sidelink communication an RRC connection resume is initiated only when
the conditions specified for V2X sidelink communication in clause 5.3.3.1a of
TS 36.331 [10] are met.
NOTE: Upper layers initiate an RRC connection resume (except if the RRC
connection resume is initiated at the L2 U2N Relay UE upon reception of a
message from a L2 U2N Remote UE via SL-RLC0 or SL-RLC1). The interaction with
NAS is left to UE implementation.
#### 5.3.13.1b Conditions for initiating SDT
A UE in RRC_INACTIVE initiates the resume procedure for SDT when all of the
following conditions are fulfilled:
1> the upper layers request resumption of RRC connection; and
1> _SIB1_ includes _sdt-ConfigCommon_ ; and
1> _sdt-Config_ is configured; and
1> all the pending data in UL is mapped to the radio bearers configured for
SDT; and

SSB, _ncd-SSB-RedCapInitialBWP-SDT_ is configured; and
1> lower layers indicate that conditions for initiating SDT as specified in TS
38.321 [3] are fulfilled.
NOTE: How the UE determines that all pending data in UL is mapped to radio
bearers configured for SDT is left to UE implementation.
#### 5.3.13.2 Initiation
The UE initiates the procedure when upper layers or AS (when responding to RAN
paging, upon triggering RNA updates while the UE is in RRC_INACTIVE, for NR
sidelink communication/discovery/V2X sidelink communication as specified in
clause 5.3.13.1a) requests the resume of a suspended RRC connection or
requests the resume for initiating SDT as specified in clause 5.3.13.1b.
The UE shall ensure having valid and up to date essential system information
as specified in clause 5.2.2.2 before initiating this procedure.
Upon initiation of the procedure, the UE shall:

paging:
2> select \'0\' as the Access Category;
2> perform the unified access control procedure as specified in 5.3.14 using
the selected Access Category and one or more Access Identities provided by
upper layers;

triggering the access attempt, in the Random Access procedure (TS 38.321 [3],
clause 5.1);
_NOTE:_ If there are multiple NSAGs with the same highest NAS-provided NSAG
priority identified for access attempt as above _, it_ is left to UE
implementation to select the NSAG to be applied in the Random Access
procedure.

_mpsPriorityIndication_ :
3> set the _resumeCause_ to _mps-PriorityAccess_ ;
2> else:
3> set the _resumeCause_ in accordance with the information received from
upper layers;
1> else if the resumption of the RRC connection is triggered due to an RNA
update as specified in 5.3.13.8:

## 5.4 Inter-RAT mobility
### 5.4.1 Introduction
Network controlled inter-RAT mobility between NR and E-UTRA, where E-UTRA can
be connected to either EPC or 5GC, and from NR to UTRA-FDD is supported.
### 5.4.2 Handover to NR
#### 5.4.2.1 General
Figure 5.4.2.1-1: Handover to NR, successful
The purpose of this procedure is to, under the control of the network,
transfer a connection between the UE and another Radio Access Network (e.g.
E-UTRAN) to NR.
The handover to NR procedure applies when SRBs, possibly in combination with
DRBs, are established in another RAT. Handover from E-UTRA to NR applies only
after integrity has been activated in E-UTRA.
#### 5.4.2.2 Initiation
The RAN using another RAT initiates the handover to NR procedure, in
accordance with the specifications applicable for the other RAT, by sending
the _RRCReconfiguration_ message via the radio access technology from which
the inter-RAT handover is performed.
The network applies the procedure as follows:
\- to activate ciphering, possibly using NULL algorithm, if not yet activated
in the other RAT;
\- to re-establish SRBs and one or more DRBs;
#### 5.4.2.3 Reception of the _RRCReconfiguration_ by the UE
The UE shall:
1> apply the default L1 parameter values as specified in corresponding
physical layer specifications except for the parameters for which values are
provided in _SIB1_ ;
1> apply the default MAC Cell Group configuration as specified in 9.2.2;
1> perform RRC reconfiguration procedure as specified in 5.3.5;
NOTE: If the UE is connected to 5GC of the source E-UTRA cell, the delta
configuration for PDCP and SDAP can be used for intra-system inter-RAT
handover. For other cases, source RAT configuration is not considered when the
UE applies the reconfiguration message of target RAT.
### 5.4.3 Mobility from NR
#### 5.4.3.1 General
Figure 5.4.3.1-1: Mobility from NR, successful
Figure 5.4.3.1-2: Mobility from NR, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to move a UE in RRC_CONNECTED to a cell using
other RAT, e.g. E-UTRA, UTRA-FDD. The mobility from NR procedure covers the
following type of mobility:
\- handover, i.e. the _MobilityFromNRCommand_ message includes radio resources
that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell;
#### 5.4.3.2 Initiation
The network initiates the mobility from NR procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED,
possibly in response to a _MeasurementReport_ or an _MCGFailureInformation_
message, by sending a _MobilityFromNRCommand_ message. The network applies the
procedure as follows:
\- the procedure is initiated only when AS security has been activated, and
SRB2 with at least one DRB or multicast MRB are setup and not suspended;
\- the procedure is not initiated if any DAPS bearer is configured;
#### 5.4.3.3 Reception of the _MobilityFromNRCommand_ by the UE
The UE shall:
1> stop timer T310, if running;
1> stop timer T312, if running;
1> if T316 is running:
2> stop timer T316;
2> clear the information included in _VarRLF-Report_ , if any;
1> if T390 is running:
2> stop timer T390 for all access categories;
2> perform the actions as specified in 5.3.14.4;
1> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _eutra_ :
2> consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards E-UTRA;
2> forward the _nas-SecurityParamFromNR_ to the upper layers, if included;
1> else if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _utra-fdd_ :
2> consider inter-RAT mobility as initiated towards UTRA-FDD;
2> forward the _nas-SecurityParamFromNR_ to the upper layers, if included;
1> access the target cell indicated in the inter-RAT message in accordance
with the specifications of the target RAT.
#### 5.4.3.4 Successful completion of the mobility from NR
Upon successfully completing the handover, at the source side the UE shall:
1> reset MAC;
1> stop all timers that are running except T325, T330 and T400;
1> release _ran-NotificationAreaInfo_ , if stored;
1> release the AS security context including the K~RRCenc~ key, the K~RRCint~
key, the K~UPint~ key and the K~UPenc~ key, if stored;
1> release all radio resources, including release of the RLC entity and the
MAC configuration;
1> release the associated PDCP entity and SDAP entity for all established RBs;
NOTE : PDCP and SDAP configured by the source RAT prior to the handover that
are reconfigured and re-used by target RAT when delta signalling (i.e., during
inter-RAT intra-system handover when _fullConfig_ is not present) is used, are
not released as part of this procedure.
1> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _eutra_ and the _nas-SecurityParamFromNR_
is included: or
1> if the _targetRAT-Type_ is set to _utra-fdd_ :
2> indicate the release of the RRC connection to upper layers together with
the release cause \'other\'.
#### 5.4.3.5 Mobility from NR failure
The UE shall:
1> if the UE does not succeed in establishing the connection to the target
radio access technology:
2> if the _targetRAT-Type_ in the received _MobilityFromNRCommand_ is set to
_eutra_ and the UE supports Radio Link Failure Report for Inter-RAT MRO EUTRA:
3> store handover failure information in _VarRLF-Report according to
5.3.10.5;_
2> if _voiceFallbackIndication_ is included in the _MobilityFromNRCommand_
_message; or_
2> if the mobility from NR procedure is for emergency services fallback as
specified in TS 23.502 [43]:
3> attempt to select an E-UTRA cell:
4> if a suitable E-UTRA cell is selected; or
4> if no suitable E-UTRA cell is available and an acceptable E-UTRA cell
supporting emergency call is selected when the UE has an ongoing emergency
call:
5> perform the actions upon going to RRC_IDLE as specified in 5.3.11, with
release cause \'RRC connection failure\';
4> else:
5> revert back to the configuration used in the source PCell;
5> initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in clause
5.3.7;
NOTE: It is left to UE implementation to determine whether the mobility from
NR procedure is for emergency services fallback as specified in TS 23.502
[43].
2> else:
3> revert back to the configuration used in the source PCell;
3> initiate the connection re-establishment procedure as specified in clause
5.3.7;
1> else if the UE is unable to comply with any part of the configuration
included in the _MobilityFromNRCommand_ message; or
1> if there is a protocol error in the inter RAT information included in the
_MobilityFromNRCommand_ message, causing the UE to fail the procedure
according to the specifications applicable for the target RAT:
2> if the _targetRAT-Type_ in the received _MobilityFromNRCommand_ is set to
_eutra_ and the UE supports Radio Link Failure Report for Inter-RAT MRO EUTRA:

## 5.5 Measurements
### 5.5.1 Introduction
The network may configure an RRC_CONNECTED UE to perform measurements. The
network may configure the UE to report them in accordance with the measurement
configuration or perform conditional reconfiguration evaluation in accordance
with the conditional reconfiguration. The measurement configuration is
provided by means of dedicated signalling i.e. using the _RRCReconfiguration_
or _RRCResume._
The network may configure the UE to perform the following types of
measurements:
\- NR measurements;
\- Inter-RAT measurements of E-UTRA frequencies;
\- Inter-RAT measurements of UTRA-FDD frequencies;
\- NR sidelink measurements of L2 U2N Relay UEs.
The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement
information based on SS/PBCH block(s):
\- Measurement results per SS/PBCH block;
\- Measurement results per cell based on SS/PBCH block(s);
\- SS/PBCH block(s) indexes.
The network may configure the UE to report the following measurement
information based on CSI-RS resources:
\- Measurement results per CSI-RS resource;
\- Measurement results per cell based on CSI-RS resource(s);
\- CSI-RS resource measurement identifiers.
The network may configure the UE to perform the following types of
measurements for NR sidelink and V2X sidelink:
\- CBR measurements.
The network may configure the UE to report the following CLI measurement
information based on SRS resources:
\- Measurement results per SRS resource;
\- SRS resource(s) indexes.
The network may configure the UE to report the following CLI measurement
information based on CLI-RSSI resources:
\- Measurement results per CLI-RSSI resource;
\- CLI-RSSI resource(s) indexes.
The network may configure the UE to report the following Rx-Tx time difference
measurement information based on CSI-RS for tracking or PRS:
\- UE Rx-Tx time difference measurement result.
The measurement configuration includes the following parameters:
**1\. Measurement objects:** A list of objects on which the UE shall perform
the measurements.
\- For intra-frequency and inter-frequency measurements a measurement object
indicates the frequency/time location and subcarrier spacing of reference
signals to be measured. Associated with this measurement object, the network
may configure a list of cell specific offsets, a list of \'exclude-listed\'
cells and a list of \'allow-listed\' cells. Exclude-listed cells are not
applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting. Allow-listed cells
are the only ones applicable in event evaluation or measurement reporting.
\- The _measObjectId_ of the MO which corresponds to each serving cell is
indicated by _servingCellMO_ within the serving cell configuration.
\- For inter-RAT E-UTRA measurements a measurement object is a single E-UTRA
carrier frequency. Associated with this E-UTRA carrier frequency, the network
can configure a list of cell specific offsets and a list of \'exclude-listed\'
cells. Exclude-listed cells are not applicable in event evaluation or
measurement reporting.
\- For inter-RAT UTRA-FDD measurements a measurement object is a set of cells
on a single UTRA-FDD carrier frequency.
\- For NR sidelink measurements of L2 U2N Relay UEs, a measurement object is a
single NR sidelink frequency to be measured.
\- For CBR measurement of NR sidelink communication, a measurement object is a
set of transmission resource pool(s) on a single carrier frequency for NR
sidelink communication.
\- For CBR measurement of NR sidelink discovery, a measurement object is a set
of discovery dedicated resource pool(s) or transmission resource pool(s) also
used for NR sidelink discovery on a single carrier frequency for NR sidelink
discovery.
\- For CLI measurements a measurement object indicates the frequency/time
location of SRS resources and/or CLI-RSSI resources, and subcarrier spacing of
SRS resources to be measured.
**2\. Reporting configurations:** A list of reporting configurations where
there can be one or multiple reporting configurations per measurement object.
Each measurement reporting configuration consists of the following:
\- Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a
measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event
description.
\- RS type: The RS that the UE uses for beam and cell measurement results
(SS/PBCH block or CSI-RS).
\- Reporting format: The quantities per cell and per beam that the UE includes
in the measurement report (e.g. RSRP) and other associated information such as
the maximum number of cells and the maximum number beams per cell to report.
In case of conditional reconfiguration, each configuration consists of the
following:
\- Execution criteria: The criteria the UE uses for conditional
reconfiguration execution.
\- RS type: The RS that the UE uses for obtaining beam and cell measurement
results (SS/PBCH block-based or CSI-RS-based), used for evaluating conditional
reconfiguration execution condition.
**3\. Measurement identities:** For measurement reporting, a list of
measurement identities where each measurement identity links one measurement
object with one reporting configuration. By configuring multiple measurement
identities, it is possible to link more than one measurement object to the
same reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one reporting
configuration to the same measurement object. The measurement identity is also
included in the measurement report that triggered the reporting, serving as a
reference to the network. For conditional reconfiguration triggering, one
measurement identity links to exactly one conditional reconfiguration trigger
configuration. And up to 2 measurement identities can be linked to one
conditional reconfiguration execution condition.
**4\. Quantity configurations:** The quantity configuration defines the
measurement filtering configuration used for all event evaluation and related
reporting, and for periodical reporting of that measurement. For NR
measurements, the network may configure up to 2 quantity configurations with a
reference in the NR measurement object to the configuration that is to be
used. In each configuration, different filter coefficients can be configured
for different measurement quantities, for different RS types, and for
measurements per cell and per beam.
**5\. Measurement gaps:** Periods that the UE may use to perform measurements.
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED maintains a measurement object list, a reporting
configuration list, and a measurement identities list according to signalling
and procedures in this specification. The measurement object list possibly
includes NR measurement object(s), CLI measurement object(s), inter-RAT
objects, and L2 U2N Relay objects. Similarly, the reporting configuration list
includes NR, inter-RAT, and L2 U2N Relay reporting configurations. Any
measurement object can be linked to any reporting configuration of the same
RAT type. Some reporting configurations may not be linked to a measurement
object. Likewise, some measurement objects may not be linked to a reporting
configuration.
The measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:
1\. The NR serving cell(s) -- these are the SpCell and one or more SCells.
2\. Listed cells -- these are cells listed within the measurement object(s).
3\. Detected cells -- these are cells that are not listed within the
measurement object(s) but are detected by the UE on the SSB frequency(ies) and
subcarrier spacing(s) indicated by the measurement object(s).
For NR measurement object(s), the UE measures and reports on the serving
cell(s)/serving Relay UE (for L2 U2N Remote UE), listed cells and/or detected
cells. For inter-RAT measurements object(s) of E-UTRA, the UE measures and
reports on listed cells and detected cells and, for RSSI and channel occupancy
measurements, the UE measures and reports on the configured resources on the
indicated frequency. For inter-RAT measurements object(s) of UTRA-FDD, the UE
measures and reports on listed cells. For CLI measurement object(s), the UE
measures and reports on configured measurement resources (i.e. SRS resources
and/or CLI-RSSI resources). For L2 U2N Relay object(s), the UE measures and
reports on the serving NR cell(s), as well as the discovered L2 U2N Relay UEs.
Whenever the procedural specification, other than contained in clause 5.5.2,
refers to a field it concerns a field included in the _VarMeasConfig_ unless
explicitly stated otherwise i.e. only the measurement configuration procedure
covers the direct UE action related to the received _measConfig_.
In NR-DC, the UE may receive two independent _measConfig_ :
\- a _measConfig_ , associated with MCG, that is included in the
_RRCReconfiguration_ message received via SRB1; and
\- a _measConfig_ , associated with SCG, that is included in the
_RRCReconfiguration_ message received via SRB3, or, alternatively, included
within a _RRCReconfiguration_ message embedded in a _RRCReconfiguration_
message received via SRB1.
In this case, the UE maintains two independent _VarMeasConfig_ and
_VarMeasReportList_ , one associated with each _measConfig_ , and
independently performs all the procedures in clause 5.5 for each _measConfig_
and the associated _VarMeasConfig_ and _VarMeasReportList_ , unless explicitly
stated otherwise.
The configurations related to CBR measurements are only included in the
_measConfig_ associated with MCG.
The configurations related to Rx-Tx time difference measurement are only
included in the _measConfig_ associated with MCG.
### 5.5.2 Measurement configuration
#### 5.5.2.1 General
The network applies the procedure as follows:
\- to ensure that, whenever the UE has a _measConfig associated with a CG_ ,
it includes a _measObject_ for the SpCell and for each NR SCell of the CG to
be measured;
\- to configure at most one measurement identity across all CGs using a
reporting configuration with the _reportType_ set to _reportCGI;_
\- to configure at most one measurement identity per the node hosting PDCP
entity using a reporting configuration with the _ul-DelayValueConfig;_
\- to configure at most one measurement identity per the node hosting PDCP
entity using a reporting configuration with the _ul-ExcessDelayConfig;_
_-_ to ensure that, in the _measConfig_ associated with a CG:
\- for all SSB based measurements there is at most one measurement object with
the same _ssbFrequency_ ;
_\- an smtc1_ included in any measurement object with the same _ssbFrequency_
has the same value and that an _smtc2_ included in any measurement object with
the same _ssbFrequency_ has the same value and that an _smtc3list_ included in
any measurement object with the same _ssbFrequency_ has the same value and
that an _smtc4list_ included in any measurement object with the same
_ssbFrequency_ has the same value;
\- to ensure that all measurement objects configured in this specification and
in TS 36.331 [10] with the same _ssbFrequency_ have the same
_ssbSubcarrierSpacing_ ;
\- to ensure that, if a measurement object associated with the MCG has the
same _ssbFrequency_ as a measurement object associated with the SCG:
\- for that _ssbFrequency_ , the measurement window according to the _smtc1_
configured by the MCG includes the measurement window according to the _smtc1_
configured by the SCG, or vice-versa, with an accuracy of the maximum receive
timing difference specified in TS 38.133 [14].
\- if both measurement objects are used for RSSI measurements, bits in
_measurementSlots_ in both objects corresponding to the same slot are set to
the same value. Also, the _endSymbol_ is the same in both objects.
\- to ensure that, if a measurement object has the same _ssbFrequency_ as a
measurement object configured in TS 36.331 [10]:
\- for that _ssbFrequency_ , the measurement window according to the _smtc_
configured in TS 36.331 [10] includes the measurement window according to the
_smtc1_ configured in TS 38.331, or vice-versa, with an accuracy of the
maximum receive timing difference specified in TS 38.133 [14].
\- if both measurement objects are used for RSSI measurements, bits in
_measurementSlots_ in both objects corresponding to the same slot are set to
the same value. Also, the _endSymbol_ is the same in both objects.
\- when the UE is in NE-DC, NR-DC, or NR standalone, to configure at most one
measurement identity across all CGs using a reporting configuration with the
_reportType_ set to _reportSFTD_ ;
For CSI-RS resources, the network applies the procedure as follows:
> \- to ensure that all CSI-RS resources configured in each measurement object
> have the same center frequency, (_startPRB_ +floor(_nrofPRBs_ /2))
\- to ensure that the total number of CSI-RS resources configured in each
measurement object does not exceed the maximum number specified in TS 38.214
[19].

MeasureConfig_ within _VarMeasConfig_ to the threshold value of the RSRP
indicated by the received value of _s-MeasureConfig_ which is derived as
specified in 6.3.2 _;_
2> else, set parameter _csi-RSRP_ of _s-MeasureConfig_ within _VarMeasConfig_
to the threshold value of the RSRP indicated by the received value of _s-
MeasureConfig_ which is derived as specified in 6.3.2.

The UE shall:
1> for each _measId_ included in the received _measIdToRemoveList_ that is
part of the current UE configuration in _VarMeasConfig_ :

_measIdToRemoveList_ includes any _measId_ value that is not part of the
current UE configuration.
#### 5.5.2.3 Measurement identity addition/modification
The network applies the procedure as follows:
\- configure a _measId_ only if the corresponding measurement object, the
corresponding reporting configuration and the corresponding quantity
configuration, are configured.
The UE shall:

the _smtc1_ configuration. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at
an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell meeting the following condition:
SFN mod _T_ = (FLOOR (_Offset_ /10));
if the _Periodicity_ is larger than _sf5_ :
subframe = _Offset_ mod 10;
else:
subframe = _Offset_ or (_Offset_ +5);
with _T_ = CEIL(_Periodicity_ /10).
If _smtc2_ is present, for cells indicated in the _pci-List_ parameter in
_smtc2_ in the same _MeasObjectNR_ , the UE shall setup an additional SS/PBCH
block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in accordance with the received
_periodicity_ parameter in the _smtc2_ configuration and use the _Offset_
(derived from parameter _periodicityAndOffset_) and _duration_ parameter from
the _smtc1_ configuration. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at
an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell meeting the above condition.
If _smtc2-LP_ is present, for cells indicated in the _pci-List_ parameter in
_smtc2-LP_ in the same frequency (for intra frequency cell reselection) or
different frequency (for inter frequency cell reselection), the UE shall setup
an additional SS/PBCH block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in
accordance with the received _periodicity_ parameter in the _smtc2-LP_
configuration and use the _Offset_ (derived from parameter
_periodicityAndOffset_) and _duration_ parameter from the _smtc_ configuration
for that frequency. The first subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at an SFN
and subframe of the NR SpCell or serving cell (for cell reselection) meeting
the above condition.
If _smtc3list_ is present, for cells indicated in the _pci-List_ parameter in
each _SSB-MTC3_ element of the list in the same _MeasObjectNR_ , the IAB-MT
shall setup an additional SS block measurement timing configuration in
accordance with the received _periodicityAndOffset_ parameter (using same
condition as _smtc1_ to identify the SFN and the subframe for SMTC occasion)
in each SSB-MTC3 configuration and use the duration and _ssb-ToMeasure_
parameters from each SSB-MTC3 configuration.
If _smtc4list_ is present, for cells indicated in the _pci-List_ parameter in
each _SSB-MTC4_ element of the list in the same _MeasObjectNR_ , the UE shall
setup an additional SS/PBCH block measurement timing configuration (SMTC) in
accordance with the received _offset_ parameter in each _SSB-MTC4_
configuration and use the _duration_ parameter and _periodicity_ (derived from
parameter _periodicityAndOffset_) from the _smtc1_ configuration. The first
subframe of each SMTC occasion occurs at an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell
meeting the above condition.
On the indicated _ssbFrequency_ , the UE shall not consider SS/PBCH block
transmission in subframes outside the SMTC occasion for RRM measurements based
on SS/PBCH blocks and for RRM measurements based on CSI-RS except for SFTD
measurement (see TS 38.133 [14], clause 9.3.8).
#### 5.5.2.10a RSSI measurement timing configuration
The UE shall setup the RSSI measurement timing configuration (RMTC) in
accordance with the received _rmtc-Periodicity_ and, if configured, with
_rmtc-SubframeOffset_ i.e. the first symbol of each RMTC occasion occurs at
first symbol of an SFN and subframe of the NR SpCell meeting the following
condition:
SFN mod _T_ = FLOOR(_rmtc-SubframeOffset_ /10);
subframe = _rmtc-SubframeOffset_ mod 10;
with _T_ = _rmtc-Periodicity_ /10;
On the frequency configured by _rmtc-Frequency_ , the UE shall not consider
RSSI measurements outside the configured RMTC occasion which lasts for
_measDurationSymbols_ for RSSI and channel occupancy measurements.
_The UE derives the RSSI measurement duration from a combination of
measDurationSymbols and ref-SCS-CP. At least for RSSI measurement confined
within the active DL BWP, the UE performs RSSI measurement using the
numerology of the active DL BWP during the derived measurement duration.
Otherwise, the numerology used by the UE for measurements is up to UE
implementation. If configured, the UE performs RSSI measurements on a
bandwidth in accordance with the received rmtc-Bandwidth._ If configured, the
UE performs RSSI measurements according to the TCI state configured by _tci-
StateId_ in the reference BWP configured by _ref-BWPId_ of the reference
serving cell configured by _ref-ServCellId_ (see TS 38.133 [14], clause 9.2A.7
and clause 9.3A.8).If the UE has no serving cell in FR2-2 and configured with
inter-frequency RSSI measurement in FR2-2, it is up to the UE implementation
how to determine the spatial domain filter for the inter-frequency RSSI
measurement in FR2-2.

### 5.5.3 Performing measurements
#### 5.5.3.1 General
An RRC_CONNECTED UE shall derive cell measurement results by measuring one or
multiple beams associated per cell as configured by the network, as described
in 5.5.3.3. For all cell measurement results, except for RSSI, and CLI
measurement results in RRC_CONNECTED, the UE applies the layer 3 filtering as
specified in 5.5.3.2, before using the measured results for evaluation of
reporting criteria, measurement reporting or the criteria to trigger
conditional reconfiguration execution. For cell measurements, the network can
configure RSRP, RSRQ, SINR, RSCP or EcN0 as trigger quantity. For CLI
measurements, the network can configure SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI as trigger
quantity. For cell and beam measurements, reporting quantities can be any
combination of quantities (i.e. only RSRP; only RSRQ; only SINR; RSRP and
RSRQ; RSRP and SINR; RSRQ and SINR; RSRP, RSRQ and SINR; only RSCP; only EcN0;
RSCP and EcN0), irrespective of the trigger quantity, and for CLI
measurements, reporting quantities can be either SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI. For
conditional reconfiguration execution, the network can configure up to 2
quantities, both using same RS type. The UE does not apply the layer 3
filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2 to derive the CBR measurements. The UE does
not apply the layer 3 filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2 to derive the Rx-Tx
time difference measurements.
The network may also configure the UE to report measurement information per
beam (which can either be measurement results per beam with respective beam
identifier(s) or only beam identifier(s)), derived as described in 5.5.3.3a.
If beam measurement information is configured to be included in measurement
reports, the UE applies the layer 3 beam filtering as specified in 5.5.3.2. On
the other hand, the exact L1 filtering of beam measurements used to derive
cell measurement results is implementation dependent.
The UE shall:
1> whenever the UE has a _measConfig_ , perform RSRP and RSRQ measurements for
each serving cell for which _servingCellMO_ is configured as follows:
2> if the _reportConfig_ associated with at least one _measId_ included in the

_servingCellMO_ :
3> if the _reportConfig_ associated with at least one _measId_ included in the
_measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ contains a _reportQuantityRS-Indexes_ and
_maxNrofRS-IndexesToReport_ and contains an _rsType_ set to _ssb_ :

_CSI-RS-ResourceConfigMobility_ is configured in the _measObject_ indicated by
the _servingCellMO_ :
3> if the _reportConfig_ associated with at least one _measId_ included in the
_measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ contains a _reportQuantityRS-Indexes_ and
_maxNrofRS-IndexesToReport_ and contains an _rsType_ set to _csi-rs_ :
4> derive layer 3 filtered RSRP and RSRQ per beam for the serving cell based
on CSI-RS, as described in 5.5.3.3a;
3> derive serving cell measurement results based on CSI-RS, as described in
5.5.3.3;
1> for each serving cell for which _servingCellMO_ is configured, if the
_reportConfig_ associated with at least one _measId_ included in the
_measIdList_ within _VarMeasConfig_ contains SINR as trigger quantity and/or

#### 5.5.3.2 Layer 3 filtering
The UE shall:
1> for each cell measurement quantity, each beam measurement quantity, each
sidelink measurement quantity as needed in clause 5.8.10, for each CLI
measurement quantity that the UE performs measurements according to 5.5.3.1,
for each candidate L2 U2N Relay UE measurement quantity according to 5.5.3.4,
and for evaluating the detected NR sidelink U2N Relay UEs according to
5.8.15.3:
2> filter the measured result, before using for evaluation of reporting
criteria, for measurement reporting or for U2N Relay (re)selection evaluation,
by the following formula:
**_F_ ~n~ = (1 -- _a_)*_F_ ~n-1~ + _a_ *_M_ ~n~**
where
**_M~n~_** is the latest received measurement result from the physical layer;
**_F~n~_** is the updated filtered measurement result, that is used for
evaluation of reporting criteria, for measurement reporting or for U2N Relay
(re)selection evaluation;
**_F~n-1~_** is the old filtered measurement result, where **_F~0~_** is set
to **_M~1~_** when the first measurement result from the physical layer is
received; and for _MeasObjectNR_ , **_a_** = 1/2^(**_ki_** /4)^, where
**_k~i~_** is the _filterCoefficient_ for the corresponding measurement
quantity of the i:th _QuantityConfigNR_ in _quantityConfigNR-List_ , and _i_
is indicated by _quantityConfigIndex_ in _MeasObjectNR;_ for _other
measurements_ , **_a_** = 1/2^(**_k_** /4)^, where **_k_** is the
_filterCoefficient_ for the corresponding measurement quantity received by the
_quantityConfig; for UTRA-FDD, a = 1/2^(k/4),^ where k is the
filterCoefficient for the corresponding measurement quantity received by
quantityConfigUTRA-FDD in the QuantityConfig;_
2> adapt the filter such that the time characteristics of the filter are
preserved at different input rates, observing that the _filterCoefficient k_
assumes a sample rate equal to X ms; The value of X is equivalent to one
intra-frequency L1 measurement period as defined in TS 38.133 [14] assuming
non-DRX operation, and depends on frequency range.
NOTE 1: If **_k_** is set to 0, no layer 3 filtering is applicable.
NOTE 2: The filtering is performed in the same domain as used for evaluation
of reporting criteria, for measurement reporting or for U2N Relay
(re)selection evaluation, i.e., logarithmic filtering for logarithmic
measurements.
NOTE 3: The filter input rate is implementation dependent, to fulfil the
performance requirements set in TS 38.133 [14]. For further details about the
physical layer measurements, see TS 38.133 [14].
NOTE 4: For CLI-RSSI measurement, it is up to UE implementation whether to
reset filtering upon BWP switch.

scale average of the highest beam measurement quantity values above

### 5.5.6 Location measurement indication
#### 5.5.6.1 General
Figure 5.5.5.1-1: Location measurement indication
The purpose of this procedure is to indicate to the network that the UE is
going to start/stop location related measurements towards E-UTRA or NR
(_eutra-RSTD, nr-RSTD, nr-UE-RxTxTimeDiff, nr-PRS-RSRP_) which require
measurement gaps or start/stop detection of subframe and slot timing towards
E-UTRA (_eutra-FineTimingDetection)_ which requires measurement gaps. UE shall
initiate this procedure only after successful AS security activation.
NOTE: It is a network decision to configure the measurement gap.
#### 5.5.6.2 Initiation
The UE shall:
1> if and only if upper layers indicate to start performing location
measurements towards E-UTRA or NR or start subframe and slot timing detection
towards E-UTRA, and the UE requires measurement gaps for these operations
while measurement gaps are either not configured or not sufficient:
2> if preconfigured measurement gaps for positioning and _posMG-Request_ are
configured and the UE considers that at least one of the preconfigured
measurement gaps for positioning is sufficient for the location measurement
when activated:
3> trigger the lower layers to initiate the measurement gap activation request
using UL MAC CE as specified in TS 38.321 [3];
2> else:
3> initiate the procedure to indicate start as specified in clause 5.5.6.3;
NOTE 1: The UE verifies the measurement gap situation only upon receiving the
indication from upper layers. If at this point in time sufficient gaps are
available, the UE does not initiate the procedure. Unless it receives a new
indication from upper layers, the UE is only allowed to further repeat the
procedure in the same PCell once per frequency of the target RAT if the
provided measurement gaps are insufficient.
NOTE 1a: When indication is received from upper layers for performing location
measurement and there is pre-configured measurement gap configured (not
preconfigured measurement gap for positioning), the UE considers this
preconfigured measurement gap to be not sufficient if the measurement gap is
not considered to be always activated according to clause 9.1.7.2 of TS 38.133
[14].
1> if and only if upper layers indicate to stop performing location
measurements towards E-UTRA or NR or stop subframe and slot timing detection
towards E-UTRA:
2> if there is no activated preconfigured measurement gap for positioning:
3> if there is previously triggered UL MAC CE transmission for the measurement
gap activation for positioning:

previously initiate the procedure to indicate start.
#### 5.5.6.3 Actions related to transmission of
_LocationMeasurementIndication_ message
The UE shall set the contents of _LocationMeasurementIndication_ message as
follows:
1> if the procedure is initiated to indicate start of location related
measurements:

## 5.6 UE capabilities
### 5.6.1 UE capability transfer
#### 5.6.1.1 General
This clause describes how the UE compiles and transfers its UE capability
information upon receiving a UECapabilityEnquiry from the network.
Figure 5.6.1.1-1: UE capability transfer
#### 5.6.1.2 Initiation
The network initiates the procedure to a UE in RRC_CONNECTED when it needs
(additional) UE radio access capability information. The network should
retrieve UE capabilities only after AS security activation. Network does not
forward UE capabilities that were retrieved before AS security activation to
the CN.
#### 5.6.1.3 Reception of the _UECapabilityEnquiry_ by the UE
The UE shall set the contents of _UECapabilityInformation_ message as follows:
1> if the _ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList_ contains a _UE-CapabilityRAT-Request_
with _rat-Type_ set to _nr_ :
2> include in the _ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList_ a _UE-CapabilityRAT-
Container_ of the type _UE-NR-Capability_ and with the _rat-Type_ set to _nr_
;
2> include the _supportedBandCombinationList, featureSets_ and
_featureSetCombinations_ as specified in clause 5.6.1.4;
1> if the _ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestLis_ t contains a _UE-CapabilityRAT-
Request_ with _rat-Type_ set to _eutra-nr_ :
2> if the UE supports (NG)EN-DC or NE-DC:
3> include in the _ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList_ a _UE-CapabilityRAT-
Container_ of the type _UE-MRDC-Capability_ and with the _rat-Type_ set to
_eutra-nr_ ;
3> include the _supportedBandCombinationList_ and _featureSetCombinations_ as
specified in clause 5.6.1.4;
1> if the _ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList_ contains a _UE-CapabilityRAT-Request_
with _rat-Type_ set to _eutra_ :
2> if the UE supports E-UTRA:
3> include in the _ue-CapabilityRAT-ContainerList_ a _ue-CapabilityRAT-
Container_ of the type _UE-EUTRA-Capability_ associated with the terrestrial
network and with the _rat-Type_ set to _eutra_ as specified in TS 36.331 [10],
clause 5.6.3.3, according to the _capabilityRequestFilter_ , if received;
1> if the _ue-CapabilityRAT-RequestList_ contains a _UE-CapabilityRAT-Request_
with _rat-Type_ set to _utra-fdd_ :
2> if the UE supports UTRA-FDD:
3> include the UE radio access capabilities for UTRA-FDD within a _ue-
CapabilityRAT-Container_ and with the _rat-Type_ set to _utra-fdd_ ;
1> if the RRC message segmentation is enabled based on the field _rrc-
SegAllowed_ received, and the encoded RRC message is larger than the maximum
supported size of a PDCP SDU specified in TS 38.323 [5]:
2> initiate the _UL message segment transfer procedure as specified in clause
5.7.7;_
1> else:
2> submit the _UECapabilityInformation_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
#### 5.6.1.4 Setting band combinations, feature set combinations and feature
sets supported by the UE
The UE invokes the procedures in this clause if the NR or E-UTRA network
requests UE capabilities for _nr_ , _eutra-nr_ or _eutra_. This procedure is
invoked once per requested _rat-Type_ (see clause 5.6.1.3 for capability
enquiry by the NR network; see TS 36.331 [10], clause 5.6.3.3 for capability
enquiry by the E-UTRA network). The UE shall ensure that the feature set IDs
are consistent across feature sets, feature set combinations and band
combinations in all three UE capability containers that the network queries
with the same fields with the same values, i.e. _UE-
CapabilityRequestFilterNR,_ _UE-CapabilityRequestFilterCommon_ and fields in
_UECapabilityEnquiry_ message (i.e. _requestedFreqBandsNR-MRDC,
requestedCapabilityNR, eutra-nr-only_ flag, and _requestedCapabilityCommon_)
as defined in TS 36.331, where applicable.
NOTE 1: Capability enquiry without _frequencyBandListFilter_ is not supported.
NOTE 2: In (NG)EN-DC, the gNB needs the capabilities for RAT types _nr_ and
_eutra-nr_ and it uses the _featureSets_ in the _UE-NR-Capability_ together
with the _featureSetCombinations_ in the _UE-MRDC-Capability_ to determine the
NR UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Similarly, the
eNB needs the capabilities for RAT types _eutra_ and _eutra-nr_ and it uses
the _featureSetsEUTRA_ in the _UE-EUTRA-Capability_ together with the
_featureSetCombinations_ in the _UE-MRDC-Capability_ to determine the E-UTRA
UE capabilities for the supported MRDC band combinations. Hence, the IDs used
in the _featureSets_ must match the IDs referred to in
_featureSetCombinations_ across all three containers. The requirement on
consistency implies that there are no undefined feature sets and feature set
combinations.
NOTE 3: If the UE cannot include all feature sets and feature set combinations
due to message size or list size constraints, it is up to UE implementation
which feature sets and feature set combinations it prioritizes.
The UE shall:
1> compile a list of \"candidate band combinations\" according to the filter
criteria in _capabilityRequestFilterCommon_ (if included), only consisting of
bands included in _frequencyBandListFilter_ , and prioritized in the order of
_frequencyBandListFilter_ (i.e. first include band combinations containing the
first-listed band, then include remaining band combinations containing the
second-listed band, and so on), where for each band in the band combination,
the parameters of the band do not exceed _maxBandwidthRequestedDL_ ,
_maxBandwidthRequestedUL_ , _maxCarriersRequestedDL_ ,
_maxCarriersRequestedUL_ , _ca-BandwidthClassDL-EUTRA_ or _ca-
BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA_ , whichever are received;
1> for each band combination included in the list of \"candidate band
combinations\":
2> if the network (E-UTRA) included the _eutra-nr-only_ field, or
2> if the requested _rat-Type_ is _eutra_ :
3> remove the NR-only band combination from the list of \"candidate band
combinations\";
NOTE 4: The (E-UTRA) network may request capabilities for _nr_ but indicate
with the _eutra-nr-only_ flag that the UE shall not include any NR band
combinations in the _UE-NR-Capability_. In this case the procedural text above
removes all NR-only band combinations from the candidate list and thereby also
avoids inclusion of corresponding feature set combinations and feature sets
below.
2> if it is regarded as a fallback band combination with the same capabilities
of another band combination included in the list of \"candidate band
combinations\", and
2> if this fallback band combination is generated by releasing at least one
SCell or uplink configuration of SCell or SUL according to TS 38.306 [26]:
3> remove the band combination from the list of \"candidate band
combinations\";
NOTE 5: Even if the network requests (only) capabilities for _nr_ , it may
include E-UTRA band numbers in the _frequencyBandListFilter_ to ensure that
the UE includes all necessary feature sets needed for subsequently requested
_eutra-nr_ capabilities. At this point of the procedure the list of
\"candidate band combinations\" contains all NR- and/or E-UTRA-NR band
combinations that match the filter (_frequencyBandListFilter_) provided by the
NW and that match the _eutra-nr-only_ flag (if RAT-Type _nr_ is requested by
E-UTRA). In the following, this candidate list is used to derive the band
combinations, feature set combinations and feature sets to be reported in the
requested capability container.
1> if the requested _rat-Type_ is _nr_ :
2> include into _supportedBandCombinationList_ as many NR-only band
combinations as possible from the list of \"candidate band combinations\",
starting from the first entry;
3> if _srs-SwitchingTimeRequest_ is received:
4> if SRS carrier switching is supported;
5> include _srs-SwitchingTimesListNR_ and _srs-SwitchingAffectedBandsListNR_

2> include, into _featureSetCombinations_ , the feature set combinations
referenced from the supported band combinations as included in
_supportedBandCombinationList_ according to the previous;
2> compile a list of \"candidate feature set combinations\" referenced from
the list of \"candidate band combinations\" excluding entries (rows in feature
set combinations) with same or lower capabilities;
2> if _uplinkTxSwitchRequest_ is received:
3> include into _supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch_ as many NR-only

3> include, into _featureSetCombinations_ , the feature set combinations
referenced from the supported band combinations as included in s
_upportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch_ according to the previous;
NOTE 6: This list of \"candidate feature set combinations\" contains the
feature set combinations used for NR-only as well as E-UTRA-NR band
combinations. It is used to derive a list of NR feature sets referred to from
the feature set combinations in the _UE-NR-Capability_ and from the feature
set combinations in a _UE-MRDC-Capability_ container.
2> if _sidelinkRequest_ is received:
3> for a sidelink band combination the UE included in
_supportedBandCombinationListSidelinkEUTRA-NR_ ,
_supportedBandCombinationListSL-RelayDiscovery_ or
_supportedBandCombinationListSL-NonRelayDiscovery_ :
4> if the UE supports partial sensing for a band of the sidelink band
combination, include the partial sensing capabilities for the band using the
_sl-TransmissionMode2-PartialSensing-r17_ ;
3> set _sidelinkRequested_ to _true_ ;
2> include into _featureSets_ the feature sets referenced from the \"candidate
feature set combinations\" and may exclude the feature sets with the
parameters that exceed any of _maxBandwidthRequestedDL_ ,
_maxBandwidthRequestedUL_ , _maxCarriersRequestedDL_ or
_maxCarriersRequestedUL_ , whichever are received;
1> else, if the requested _rat-Type_ is _eutra-nr_ :
2> include into _supportedBandCombinationList_ and/or
_supportedBandCombinationListNEDC-Only_ as many E-UTRA-NR band combinations as
possible from the list of \"candidate band combinations\", starting from the
first entry;
3> if _srs-SwitchingTimeRequest_ is received:
4> if SRS carrier switching is supported;
5> include _srs-SwitchingTimesListNR,_ _srs-SwitchingTimesListEUTRA_ and _srs-
SwitchingAffectedBandsListNR_ for each band combination;
4> set _srs-SwitchingTimeRequested_ to _true_ ;
2> include, into _featureSetCombinations_ , the feature set combinations
referenced from the supported band combinations as included in
_supportedBandCombinationList_ according to the previous;
2> if _uplinkTxSwitchRequest_ is received:
3> include into _supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch_ as many E-UTRA-
NR band combinations that supported UL TX switching as possible from the list
of \"candidate band combinations\", starting from the first entry;
4> if _srs-SwitchingTimeRequest_ is received:
5> if SRS carrier switching is supported;
6> include _srs-SwitchingTimesListNR_ , _srs-SwitchingTimesListEUTRA_ and
_srs-SwitchingAffectedBandsListNR_ for each band combination;
5> set _srs-SwitchingTimeRequested_ to _true_ ;
3> include, into _featureSetCombinations_ , the feature set combinations
referenced from the supported band combinations as included in
_supportedBandCombinationList-UplinkTxSwitch_ according to the previous;
1> else (if the requested _rat-Type_ is _eutra_):
2> compile a list of \"candidate feature set combinations\" referenced from
the list of \"candidate band combinations\" excluding entries (rows in feature
set combinations) with same or lower capabilities;
NOTE 7: This list of \"candidate feature set combinations\" contains the
feature set combinations used for E-UTRA-NR band combinations. It is used to
derive a list of E-UTRA feature sets referred to from the feature set
combinations in a _UE-MRDC-Capability_ container.
2> include into _featureSetsEUTRA_ (in the _UE-EUTRA-Capability)_ the feature
sets referenced from the \"candidate feature set combinations\" and may
exclude the feature sets with the parameters that exceed _ca-BandwidthClassDL-
EUTRA_ or _ca-BandwidthClassUL-EUTRA_ , whichever are received;
1> include the received _frequencyBandListFilter_ in the field
_appliedFreqBandListFilter_ of the requested UE capability, except if the
requested _rat-Type_ is _nr_ and the network included the _eutra-nr-only_
field;

Figure 5.7.2.1-1: UL information transfer
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer NAS dedicated information from
the UE to the network in RRC_CONNECTED or in RRC_INACTIVE during SDT, or to
transfer F1-C related information from IAB-DU to IAB Donor-CU via the
collocated IAB-MT in RRC_CONNECTED.
#### 5.7.2.2 Initiation
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED or a UE in RRC_INACTIVE during SDT initiates the UL
information transfer procedure whenever there is a need to transfer NAS
dedicated information. The UE initiates the UL information transfer procedure
by sending the ULInformationTransfer message. In addition, an IAB-MT in
RRC_CONNECTED initiates the UL information transfer procedure whenever there
is a need to transfer F1-C related information. When F1-C related information
has to be transferred, the IAB-MT shall initiate the procedure only if SRB2 or
split SRB2 is established.
#### 5.7.2.3 Actions related to transmission of _ULInformationTransfer_
message
The UE shall set the contents of the _ULInformationTransfer_ message as
follows:
1> if the upper layer provides NAS PDU:
2> set the _dedicatedNAS-Message_ to include the information received from
upper layers;
1> for the IAB-MT, if there is a need to transfer F1-C related information:
2> include the _dedicatedInfoF1c_ ;
1> submit the _ULInformationTransfer_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
#### 5.7.2.4 Failure to deliver _ULInformationTransfer_ message
The UE shall:
1> if AS security is not started and radio link failure occurs before the
successful delivery of _ULInformationTransfer_ messages has been confirmed by
lower layers; or
1> if PDCP re-establishment or release/addition (e.g due to key refresh upon
PCell or PSCell change, or RRC connection re-establishment, or failure of
resume procedure initiated for SDT) occurs on an SRB on which
_ULInformationTransfer_ messages were submitted for transmission but
successful delivery of these messages was not confirmed by lower layers:
2> inform upper layers about the possible failure to deliver the information
contained in the concerned _ULInformationTransfer_ messages, unless the
messages only include _dedicatedInfoF1c_.
### 5.7.2a UL information transfer for MR-DC
#### 5.7.2a.1 General
Figure 5.7.2a.1-1: UL information transfer MR-DC
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer MR-DC dedicated information from
the UE to the network e.g. the NR or E-UTRA RRC _MeasurementReport,_
_FailureInformation, UEAssistanceInformation, RRCReconfigurationComplete,_
_MCGFailureInformation, or IABOtherInformation_ message.
#### 5.7.2a.2 Initiation
A UE in RRC_CONNECTED initiates the UL information transfer for MR-DC
procedure whenever there is a need to transfer MR-DC dedicated information.
I.e. the procedure is not used during an RRC connection reconfiguration
involving NR or E-UTRA connection reconfiguration, in which case the MR DC
information is piggybacked to the _RRCReconfigurationComplete_ message, except
in the case the UE executes an intra-SN CPC.
#### 5.7.2a.3 Actions related to transmission of _ULInformationTransferMRDC_
message
The UE shall set the contents of the _ULInformationTransferMRDC_ message as
follows:
1> if there is a need to transfer MR-DC dedicated information related to NR:
2> set the _ul-DCCH-MessageNR_ to include the NR MR-DC dedicated information
to be transferred (e.g., NR RRC _MeasurementReport,_ _UEAssistanceInformation_
, _FailureInformation, RRCReconfigurationComplete,_ _MCGFailureInformation, or
IABOtherInformation_ message);
1> else if there is a need to transfer MR-DC dedicated information related to
E-UTRA:
2> set the _ul-DCCH-MessageEUTRA_ to include the E-UTRA MR-DC dedicated
information to be transferred (e.g., E-UTRA RRC _MeasurementReport,_ or
_MCGFailureInformation_ message);
1> submit the _ULInformationTransferMRDC_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
### 5.7.2b UL transfer of IRAT information
#### 5.7.2b.1 General
Figure 5.7.2b.1-1: UL transfer of IRAT information
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer from the UE to NR MCG dedicated
information terminated at the NR MCG but specified by another RAT e.g. the
E-UTRA _MeasurementReport_ message, the E-UTRA _SidelinkUEInformation_ message
or the E-UTRA _UEAssistanceInformation_ message. The specific information
transferred in this message is set in accordance with:
\- the procedure specified in 5.6.10 of TS 36.331 [10] for E-UTRA
_UEAssistanceInformation_ message;
\- the procedure specified in 5.10.2 of TS 36.331 [10] for E-UTRA
_SidelinkUEInformation_ message;
\- the procedure specified in 5.5.5 of TS 36.331 [10] for E-UTRA
_MeasurementReport_ Message.
#### 5.7.2b.2 Initiation

there is a need to transfer dedicated inter-RAT information as specified in TS
36.331 [10].
#### 5.7.2b.3 Actions related to transmission of _ULInformationTransferIRAT_
message
The UE shall set the contents of the _ULInformationTransferIRAT_ message as
follows:
1> if there is a need to transfer dedicated LTE information related to V2X
sidelink communications:
2> set the _ul-DCCH-MessageEUTRA_ to include the V2X sidelink communication
information to be transferred (e.g. the E-UTRA RRC _MeasurementReport_
message, the E-UTRA RRC _SidelinkUEInformation_ message, or the E-UTRA RRC
_UEAssistanceInformation_ message);
1> submit the _ULInformationTransferIRAT_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends;

across several subframes/slots where not necessarily all the subframes/slots
are affected.
NOTE 2: For the frequencies on which a serving cell or serving cells is
configured that is activated, IDC problems consist of interference issues that
the UE cannot solve by itself, during either active data exchange or upcoming
data activity which is expected in up to a few hundred milliseconds.\ For
frequencies on which a SCell or SCells is configured that is deactivated,
reporting IDC problems indicates an anticipation that the activation of the

able to solve by itself.\ For a non-serving frequency, reporting IDC problems
indicates an anticipation that if the non-serving frequency or frequencies
became a serving frequency or serving frequencies then this would result in
interference issues that the UE would not be able to solve by itself.

This procedure specifies the measurements to be performed and stored by a UE
in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE when it has an idle/inactive measurement

The purpose of this procedure is to update the idle/inactive measurement
configuration.
The UE initiates this procedure while T331 is running and SDT procedure is not
ongoing and one of the following conditions is met:

_measIdleCarrierListNR_ within _VarMeasIdleConfig_ , if stored;
1> perform measurements according to 5.7.8.2a.
#### 5.7.8.2 Void
#### 5.7.8.2a Performing measurements
When performing measurements on NR carriers according to this clause, the UE
shall derive the cell quality as specified in 5.5.3.3 and consider the beam
quality to be the value of the measurement results of the concerned beam,
where each result is averaged as described in TS 38.215 [9].
While in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, and T331 is running and SDT procedure is
not ongoing, the UE shall:

in decreasing order of the sorting quantity,_ i.e. the best cell is included
first, as follows:

7> include the measurement results from the cells applicable for idle/inactive
measurement reporting whose RSRP/RSRQ measurement results are above the
value(s) provided in _qualityThresholdEUTRA;_

reporting;
5> for all cells applicable for idle/inactive measurement reporting, derive
cell measurement results for the measurement quantities indicated by

_reportQuantities_ for cells applicable for idle/inactive measurement
reporting within _measResultsPerCarrierListIdleNR_ in the _measReportIdleNR_
in _VarMeasIdleReport_ in decreasing order of the cell sorting quantity, i.e.
the best cell is included first, as follows:
6> if _qualityThreshold_ is configured:

measurement reporting whose RSRP/RSRQ measurement results are above the
value(s) provided in _qualityThreshold;_
6> else:

frequency:
4> if _beamMeasConfigIdle_ is included in that entry, and if the UE supports
_idleInactiveNR- MeasBeamReport_ for the FR of the serving cell:
5> derive beam measurements based on SS/PBCH block for each measurement
quantity indicated in _reportQuantityRS-Indexes_ , as described in TS 38.215

6> include the beam measurement results as indicated by _reportQuantityRS-
Indexes_ ;
NOTE 1: How the UE performs idle/inactive measurements is up to UE
implementation as long as the requirements in TS 38.133 [14] are met for
measurement reporting.
NOTE 2: The UE is not required to perform idle/inactive measurements on a
given carrier if the SSB configuration of that carrier provided via dedicated
signaling is different from the SSB configuration broadcasted in the serving
cell, if any.
NOTE 3: How the UE prioritizes which frequencies to measure or report (in case
it is configured with more frequencies than it can measure or report) is left
to UE implementation.
NOTE 4: When _idleModeMeasVoiceFallback_ is included in SIB5, UE may decide to
measure and report idle/inactive measurements for EUTRA carrier frequencies
included in SIB5 even if it does not support NE-DC between the serving carrier
and the EUTRA carrier frequencies.
#### 5.7.8.3 T331 expiry or stop
The UE shall:
1> if T331 expires or is stopped:
2> release the _VarMeasIdleConfig_.
NOTE: It is up to UE implementation whether to continue idle/inactive
measurements according to SIB11 and SIB4 configurations or according to E-UTRA
SIB5 and E-UTRA SIB24 configurations as specified in TS 36.331 [10] upon
inter-RAT cell reselection to E-UTRA, after T331 has expired or stopped.
#### 5.7.8.4 Cell re-selection or cell selection while T331 is running

3> if the serving frequency matches with the _carrierFreq_ of an entry in the
_validityAreaList_ , the _validityCellList_ is included in that entry, and the
physical cell identity of the serving cell does not match with any entry in
_validityCellList_ :
4> stop timer T331;
4> perform the actions as specified in 5.7.8.3, upon which the procedure ends.
1> else if inter-RAT cell selection or reselection occurs while T331 is
running:

## 5.8 Sidelink
### 5.8.1 General
NR sidelink communication consists of unicast, groupcast and broadcast. For
unicast, the PC5-RRC connection is a logical connection between a pair of a
Source Layer-2 ID and a Destination Layer-2 ID in the AS. The PC5-RRC
signalling, as specified in clause 5.8.9, can be initiated after its
corresponding PC5 unicast link establishment (TS 23.287 [55]). The PC5-RRC
connection and the corresponding sidelink SRBs and sidelink DRB(s) are
released when the PC5 unicast link is released as indicated by upper layers.
For each PC5-RRC connection of unicast, one sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB0) is
used to transmit the PC5-S message(s) before the PC5-S security has been
established. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB1) is used to transmit the PC5-S
messages to establish the PC5-S security. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB2) is
used to transmit the PC5-S messages after the PC5-S security has been
established, which is protected. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB3) is used to
transmit the PC5-RRC signalling, which is protected and only sent after the
PC5-S security has been established. One sidelink SRB (i.e. SL-SRB4) is used
to transmit/receive the NR sidelink discovery messages.
For unicast of NR sidelink communication, AS security comprises of integrity
protection of PC5 signalling (SL-SRB1, SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3) and user data (SL-
DRBs), and it further comprises of ciphering of PC5 signaling (SL-SRB1 only
for the Direct Link Security Mode Complete message as specified in TS 24.587
[57] for V2X service or TS 24.554 [72] for Proximity-services, SL-SRB2 and SL-
SRB3) and user data (SL-DRBs). The ciphering and integrity protection
algorithms and parameters for a PC5 unicast link are exchanged by PC5-S
messages in the upper layers as specified in TS 33.536 [60], and applied to
the corresponding PC5-RRC connection in the AS. Once AS security is activated
for a PC5 unicast link in the upper layers as specified in TS 33.536 [60], all
messages on SL-SRB2 and SL-SRB3 and/or user data on SL-DRBs of the
corresponding PC5-RRC connection are integrity protected and/or ciphered by
the PDCP.
For unicast of NR sidelink communication, if the change of the key is
indicated by the upper layers as specified in TS 24.587 [57] or TS 24.554
[72], UE re-establishes the PDCP entity of the SL-SRB1, SL-SRB2, SL-SRB3 and
SL-DRBs on the corresponding PC5-RRC connection.
NOTE 1: In case the configurations for NR sidelink communication are acquired
via the E-UTRA, the configurations for NR sidelink communication in _SIB12_
and _sl-ConfigDedicatedNR_ within _RRCReconfiguration_ used in clause 5.8 are
provided by the configurations in _SystemInformationBlockType28_ and _sl-
ConfigDedicatedForNR_ within _RRCConnectionReconfiguration_ as specified in TS
36.331 [10], respectively.
NOTE 2: In this release, there is one-to-one correspondence between the
PC5-RRC connection and the PC5 unicast link as specified in TS 38.300[2].
NOTE 3: All SL-DRBs related to the same PC5-RRC connection have the same
activation/deactivation setting for ciphering and the same
activation/deactivation setting for integrity protection as specified in TS
33.536 [60].
NOTE 4: When integrity check failure concerning SL-SRB1 for a specific
destination is detected, the UE sends an indication to the upper layers [57].
NOTE 5: The selection of NULL algorithms means that the PC5 messages are
considered protected for the purposes of being allowed to be sent or received.
### 5.8.2 Conditions for NR sidelink communication/discovery operation
The UE shall perform NR sidelink communication operation only if the
conditions defined in this clause are met:
1> if the UE\'s serving cell is suitable (RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE or
RRC_CONNECTED); and if either the selected cell on the frequency used for NR
sidelink communication/discovery operation belongs to the registered or
equivalent PLMN as specified in TS 24.587 [57] or TS 24.554 [72] or the UE is
out of coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication/discovery
operation as defined in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 36.304 [27]; or
1> if the UE\'s serving cell (RRC_IDLE or RRC_CONNECTED) fulfils the
conditions to support NR sidelink communication/discovery in limited service
state as specified in TS 23.287 [55]; and if either the serving cell is on the
frequency used for NR sidelink communication/discovery operation or the UE is
out of coverage on the frequency used for NR sidelink communication/discovery
operation as defined in TS 38.304 [20] and TS 36.304 [27]; or
1> if the UE has no serving cell (RRC_IDLE).

### 5.8.9 Sidelink RRC procedure
#### 5.8.9.1 Sidelink RRC reconfiguration
##### 5.8.9.1.1 General
Figure 5.8.9.1.1-1: Sidelink RRC reconfiguration, successful
Figure 5.8.9.1.1-2: Sidelink RRC reconfiguration, failure
The purpose of this procedure is to modify a PC5-RRC connection, e.g. to
establish/modify/release sidelink DRBs or PC5 Relay RLC channels, to
(re-)configure NR sidelink measurement and reporting, to (re-)configure
sidelink CSI reference signal resources, to (re)configure CSI reporting
latency bound, to (re)configure sidelink DRX, and to (re-)configure the
latency bound of SL Inter-UE coordination report.
The UE may initiate the sidelink RRC reconfiguration procedure and perform the
operation in clause 5.8.9.1.2 on the corresponding PC5-RRC connection in
following cases:
\- the release of sidelink DRBs associated with the peer UE, as specified in
clause 5.8.9.1a.1;
\- the establishment of sidelink DRBs associated with the peer UE, as
specified in clause 5.8.9.1a.2;
\- the modification for the parameters included in _SLRB-Config_ of sidelink
DRBs associated with the peer UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.1a.2;
\- the release of PC5 Relay RLC channels for L2 U2N Relay UE and Remote UE, as
specified in clause 5.8.9.7.1;
\- the establishment of PC5 Relay RLC channels for L2 U2N Relay UE and Remote
UE, as specified in clause 5.8.9.7.2;
\- the modification for the parameters included in _SL-RLC-ChannelConfigPC5_
of PC5 Relay RLC channels for L2 U2N Relay UE and Remote UE, as specified in
clause 5.8.9.7.2;
\- the (re-)configuration of the peer UE to perform NR sidelink measurement
and report.
\- the (re-)configuration of the sidelink CSI reference signal resources and
CSI reporting latency bound;
\- the (re-)configuration of the peer UE to perform sidelink DRX;
\- the (re-)configuration of the latency bound of SL Inter-UE coordination
report.
In RRC_CONNECTED, the UE applies the NR sidelink communications parameters
provided in _RRCReconfiguration_ (if any). In RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE, the UE
applies the NR sidelink communications parameters provided in system
information (if any). For other cases, UEs apply the NR sidelink
communications parameters provided in _SidelinkPreconfigNR_ (if any). When UE
performs state transition between above three cases, the UE applies the NR
sidelink communications parameters provided in the new state, after
acquisition of the new configurations. Before acquisition of the new
configurations, UE continues applying the NR sidelink communications
parameters provided in the old state.

#### 5.8.9.6 Sidelink UE assistance information
##### 5.8.9.6.1 General
Figure 5.8.9.6.1-1: Sidelink UE assistance information
The purpose of this procedure is for a UE to inform its peer UE of the
sidelink DRX assistance information used to determine the sidelink DRX
configuration for unicast communication.
For sidelink unicast, a UE may include its desired sidelink DRX configurations
in the _UEAssistanceInformationSidelink_ as the sidelink DRX assistance
information which is transmitted to its peer UE.
NOTE: It is up to UE implementation to determine its desired sidelink DRX
configurations for unicast communication.
##### 5.8.9.6.2 Initiation
For sidelink unicast, if both a RX UE and its peer TX UE for a direction of
sidelink communication are capable of sidelink DRX, the RX UE that is
interested in sending the sidelink DRX assistance information may send the
_UEAssistanceInformationSidelink_ as the sidelink DRX assistance information
to its peer UE when the sidelink DRX assistance information has not been sent
previously or when the previously transmitted sidelink DRX assistance
information has changed.
##### 5.8.9.6.3 Actions related to reception of
_UEAssistanceInformationSidelink_ message
For sidelink unicast, when a UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and is performing sidelink
operation with resource allocation mode 1, it may report the sidelink DRX
assistance information received within the _UEAssistanceInformationSidelink_
from its peer UE to the network as specified in 5.8.3. For sidelink unicast,
when a UE is in RRC_CONNECTED and is performing sidelink operation with
resource allocation mode 2 or is in RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE or out of
coverage, regardless of whether the UE has obtained the sidelink DRX
assistance information from the _UEAssistanceInformationSidelink transmitted_
from its peer UE or not, it may determine the sidelink DRX configuration _SL-
DRX-ConfigUC for its peer UE_.
NOTE: When UE determines the sidelink DRX configuration for its peer UE, it
may take the sidelink DRX assistance information received from its peer UE
into account.

### 5.8.10 Sidelink measurement
#### 5.8.10.1 Introduction
The UE may configure the associated peer UE to perform NR sidelink measurement
and report on the corresponding PC5-RRC connection in accordance with the NR
sidelink measurement configuration for unicast by _RRCReconfigurationSidelink_
message.
The NR sidelink measurement configuration includes the following parameters
for a PC5-RRC connection:
**1\. NR sidelink measurement objects:** Object(s) on which the associated
peer UE shall perform the NR sidelink measurements.
\- For NR sidelink measurement, a NR sidelink measurement object indicates the
NR sidelink frequency of reference signals to be measured.
**2\. NR sidelink reporting configurations:** NR sidelink measurement
reporting configuration(s) where there can be one or multiple NR sidelink
reporting configurations per NR sidelink measurement object. Each NR sidelink
reporting configuration consists of the following:
\- Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a NR
sidelink measurement report. This can either be periodical or a single event
description.
\- RS type: The RS that the UE uses for NR sidelink measurement results. In
this release, only DMRS is supported for NR sidelink measurement.
\- Reporting format: The quantities that the UE includes in the measurement
report. In this release, only RSRP measurement is supported.
**3\. NR sidelink measurement identities:** A list of NR sidelink measurement
identities where each NR sidelink measurement identity links one NR sidelink
measurement object with one NR sidelink reporting configuration. By
configuring multiple NR sidelink measurement identities, it is possible to
link more than one NR sidelink measurement object to the same NR sidelink
reporting configuration, as well as to link more than one NR sidelink
reporting configuration to the same NR sidelink measurement object. The NR
sidelink measurement identity is also included in the NR sidelink measurement
report that triggered the reporting, serving as a reference to the network.
**4\. NR sidelink quantity configurations:** The NR sidelink quantity
configuration defines the NR sidelink measurement filtering configuration used
for all event evaluation and related reporting, and for periodical reporting
of that NR sidelink measurement. In each configuration, different filter
coefficients can be configured for different NR sidelink measurement
quantities.
Both UEs of the PC5-RRC connection maintains a NR sidelink measurement object
list, a NR sidelink reporting configuration list, and a NR sidelink
measurement identities list according to signalling and procedures in this
specification.

condition S1-2, as specified below, is fulfilled;
1> for this NR sidelink measurement, consider the NR sidelink frequency
corresponding to the associated _sl-MeasObject_ associated with this event.
Inequality S1-1 (Entering condition)
_Ms -- Hys > Thresh_
Inequality S1-2 (Leaving condition)
_Ms + Hys \  consider the entering condition for this event to be satisfied when
condition S2-1, as specified below, is fulfilled;

Inequality S2-1 (Entering condition)
_Ms + Hys \  Thresh_
The variables in the formula are defined as follows:
**_Ms_** is the NR sidelink measurement result of the NR sidelink frequency,
not taking into account any offsets.
**_Hys_** is the hysteresis parameter for this event (i.e. _sl-Hysteresis_ as
defined within _sl-ReportConfig_ for this event).
**_Thresh_** is the threshold parameter for this event (i.e. _s2-Threshold_ as
defined within _sl-ReportConfig_ for this event).
**_Ms_** is expressed in dBm in case of RSRP.
**_Hys_** is expressed in dB.
**_Thresh_** is expressed in the same unit as **_Ms_**.
#### 5.8.10.5 Sidelink measurement reporting
##### 5.8.10.5.1 General
Figure 5.8.10.5.1-1: NR sidelink measurement reporting
The purpose of this procedure is to transfer measurement results from the UE
to the peer UE associated.
For the _sl-MeasId_ for which the NR sidelink measurement reporting procedure
was triggered, the UE shall set the _sl-MeasResults_ within the
_MeasurementReportSidelink_ message as follows:
1> set the _sl-MeasId_ to the measurement identity that triggered the NR
sidelink measurement reporting;
1> if the _sl-ReportConfig_ associated with the _sl-MeasId_ that triggered the
NR sidelink measurement reporting is set to _sl-EventTriggered_ or _sl-
Periodical_ :
2> set _sl-ResultDMRS_ within _sl-MeasResult_ to include the NR sidelink DMRS
based quantity indicated in the _sl-ReportQuantity_ within the concerned _sl-
ReportConfig_ ;
1> increment the _sl-NumberOfReportsSent_ as defined within the
_VarMeasReportListSL_ for this _sl-MeasId_ by 1;
1> stop the periodical reporting timer, if running;
1> if the _sl-NumberOfReportsSent_ as defined within the _VarMeasReportListSL_
for this _sl-MeasId_ is less than the _sl-ReportAmount_ as defined within the
corresponding _sl-ReportConfig_ for this _sl-MeasId_ :
2> start the periodical reporting timer with the value of _sl-ReportInterval_
as defined within the corresponding _sl-ReportConfig_ for this _sl-MeasId_ ;
1> else:
2> if the _sl-ReportType_ is set to _sl-Periodical_ :
3> remove the entry within the _VarMeasReportListSL_ for this _sl-MeasId_ ;
3> remove this _sl-MeasId_ from the _sl-MeasIdList_ within _VarMeasConfigSL_ ;
1> submit the _MeasurementReportSidelink_ message to lower layers for
transmission, upon which the procedure ends.
### 5.8.11 Zone identity calculation
The UE shall determine an identity of the zone (i.e. Zone_id) in which it is
located using the following formulae, if _sl-ZoneConfig_ is configured:
_x_ ~1~= Floor (_x_ / _L_) Mod 64;
_y_ ~1~= Floor (_y_ / _L_) Mod 64;
Zone_id = _y_ ~1~ * 64 + _x_ ~1~.
The parameters in the formulae are defined as follows:
**L** is the value of _sl-ZoneLength_ included in _sl-ZoneConfig_ ;
**x** is the geodesic distance in longitude between UE\'s current location and
geographical coordinates (0, 0) according to WGS84 model [58] and it is
expressed in meters;
**y** is the geodesic distance in latitude between UE\'s current location and
geographical coordinates (0, 0) according to WGS84 model [58] and it is
expressed in meters.
NOTE: How the calculated zone_id is used is specified in TS 38.321 [3].
### 5.8.12 DFN derivation from GNSS
When the UE selects GNSS as the synchronization reference source, the DFN, the
subframe number within a frame and slot number within a frame used for NR
sidelink communication/discovery are derived from the current UTC time, by the
following formulae:
_DFN_ = Floor (0.1*(_Tcurrent_ \--_Tref--OffsetDFN_)) mod 1024
_SubframeNumber_ = Floor (_Tcurrent_ \--_Tref--OffsetDFN_) mod 10
_SlotNumber_ = Floor ((_Tcurrent_ \--Tref--_OffsetDFN_)*2^μ^) mod (10*2^μ^)
Where:
**_Tcurrent_** is the current UTC time obtained from GNSS. This value is
expressed in milliseconds;
**_Tref_** is the reference UTC time 00:00:00 on Gregorian calendar date 1
January, 1900 (midnight between Thursday, December 31, 1899 and Friday,
January 1, 1900). This value is expressed in milliseconds;
**_OffsetDFN_** is the value _sl-OffsetDFN_ if configured, otherwise it is
zero. This value is expressed in milliseconds.
μ=0/1/2/3 corresponding to the 15/30/60/120 kHz of SCS for SL, respectively.
NOTE 1: In case of leap second change event, how UE obtains the scheduled time
of leap second change to adjust _Tcurrent_ correspondingly is left to UE
implementation. How UE handles to avoid the sudden discontinuity of DFN is
left to UE implementation.
NOTE 2: Void.

NOTE 2: A candidate NR sidelink U2N Relay UE which meets all AS layer criteria
defined in 5.8.15.3 and higher layer criteria defined in TS 23.304 [65] can be
regarded as suitable NR sidelink U2N Relay UE by the NR sidelink U2N Remote
UE. If multiple suitable NR sidelink U2N Relay UEs are available, it is up to
Remote UE implementation to choose one NR sidelink U2N Relay UE. The details
of the interaction with upper layers are up to UE implementation.

## 5.9 MBS Broadcast
### 5.9.1 Introduction
#### 5.9.1.1 General
UE receiving or interested to receive MBS broadcast service(s) applies MBS
broadcast procedures described in this clause as well as the MBS Interest
Indication procedure as specified in clause 5.9.4.
MBS broadcast configuration information, except CFR configuration for
MCCH/MTCH, is provided on MCCH logical channel. MCCH carries the
_MBSBroadcastConfiguration_ message which indicates the MBS broadcast sessions
that are provided in the cell as well as the corresponding scheduling related
information for these sessions. Optionally, the _MBSBroadcastConfiguration_
message may also contain a list of neighbour cells providing the same
broadcast MBS service(s) as provided in the current cell. The configuration
information required by the UE to receive MCCH is provided in _SIB1_ and
_SIB20_. Additionally, System Information may provide information related to
service continuity of MBS broadcast in _SIB21_.
#### 5.9.1.2 MCCH scheduling
The MCCH information (i.e. information transmitted in messages sent over MCCH)
is transmitted periodically, using a configurable repetition period and within
a configured transmission window. MCCH transmissions (and the associated radio
resources and MCS) are indicated via the PDCCH addressed to MCCH-RNTI. PDCCH
monitoring occasion(s) for MCCH transmission are determined according to the
common search space indicated by _searchspaceMCCH_. If _searchspaceMCCH_ is
set to zero, PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message reception in the MCCH
transmission window are the same as PDCCH monitoring occasions for _SIB1_
where the mapping between PDCCH monitoring occasions and SSBs is specified in
TS 38.213[13]. If _searchspaceMCCH_ is not set to zero, PDCCH monitoring
occasions for MCCH message are determined based on search space indicated by
_searchspaceMCCH_. PDCCH monitoring occasions for MCCH message which are not
overlapping with UL symbols (determined according to _tdd-UL-DL-
ConfigurationCommon_) are sequentially numbered from one in the MCCH
transmission window. The [x×N+K]^th^ PDCCH monitoring occasion for MCCH
message in MCCH transmission window corresponds to the K^th^ transmitted SSB,
where x = 0, 1, ...X-1, K = 1, 2, ...N, N is the number of actual transmitted
SSBs determined according to _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ in _SIB1_ and X is equal
to CEIL(number of PDCCH monitoring occasions in MCCH transmission window/N).
The actual transmitted SSBs are sequentially numbered from one in ascending
order of their SSB indexes. The UE assumes that, in the MCCH transmission
window, PDCCH for an MCCH message is transmitted in at least one PDCCH
monitoring occasion corresponding to each transmitted SSB and thus the
selection of SSB for the reception MCCH messages is up to UE implementation.
#### 5.9.1.3 MCCH information validity and notification of changes
Change of MCCH information only occurs at specific radio frames, i.e. the
concept of a modification period is used. Within a modification period, the
same MCCH information may be transmitted a number of times, as defined by its
scheduling (which is based on a repetition period).
When the network changes (some of) the MCCH information, it notifies the UEs
about the change starting from the beginning of the MCCH modification period
via PDCCH which schedules the MCCH in every repetition in that modification
period.
Upon receiving a change notification, a UE receiving or interested to receive
MBS services transmitted using MBS broadcast acquires the new MCCH information
starting from the same slot. The UE applies the previously acquired MCCH
information until the UE acquires the new MCCH information. The notification
is transmitted with a 2-bit bitmap, see TS 38.212 [17] clause 7.3.1.5.1. The
MSB in the 2-bit bitmap, when set to \'1\', indicates the start of new MBS
service(s). The LSB in the 2-bit bitmap, when set to \'1\', indicates
modification of MCCH information other than the change caused by start of new
MBS service(s), e.g. modification of a configuration of an on-going MBS
session(s), MBS session(s) stop or neighbouring cell information modification.
### 5.9.2 MCCH information acquisition
#### 5.9.2.1 General
Figure 5.9.2.1-1: MCCH information acquisition
The UE applies the MCCH information acquisition procedure to acquire the MBS
broadcast configuration information broadcasted by the network. The procedure
applies to MBS capable UEs interested to receive or that are receiving MBS
broadcast services that are in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED with an
active BWP with common search space configured by _searchSpaceMCCH_.
#### 5.9.2.2 Initiation
A UE shall apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure upon becoming
interested to receive MBS broadcast services. A UE interested to receive MBS
broadcast services shall apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure upon
entering the cell providing _SIB20_ (e.g. upon power on, following UE
mobility), upon receiving _SIB20_ of an SCell via dedicated signalling and
upon receiving a notification that the MCCH information has changed due to the
start of new MBS service(s). A UE that is receiving data via broadcast MRB
shall apply the MCCH information acquisition procedure upon receiving a
notification that the MCCH information has changed due to MCCH information
modification other than the change caused by the start of new MBS service(s).
NOTE 1: It is up to UE implementation how to address a possibility of the UE
missing an MCCH change notification.
NOTE 2: It is up to UE implementation to use the cell/tracking area list in
the USD to avoid acquiring the MCCH when the UE is outside the MBS service
area of the MBS broadcast service.
Unless explicitly stated otherwise in the procedural specification, the MCCH
information acquisition procedure overwrites any stored MCCH information, i.e.
delta configuration is not applicable for MCCH information and the UE
discontinues using a field if it is absent in MCCH information.
#### 5.9.2.3 MCCH information acquisition by the UE
An MBS capable UE interested to receive or receiving an MBS broadcast service
shall:
1> if the procedure is triggered by an MCCH information change notification:
2> start acquiring the _MBSBroadcastConfiguration_ message on MCCH in the
concerned cell from the slot in which the change notification was received;
1> if the UE enters a cell providing _SIB20_ ; or
1> if the UE receives _sCellSIB20_ :
2> acquire the _MBSBroadcastConfiguration_ message on MCCH in the concerned
cell at the next repetition period.
#### 5.9.2.4 Actions upon reception of the _MBSBroadcastConfiguration_ message
No UE requirements related to the contents of the _MBSBroadcastConfiguration_
message apply other than those specified elsewhere e.g. within the
corresponding field descriptions.
### 5.9.3 Broadcast MRB configuration
#### 5.9.3.1 General
The broadcast MRB configuration procedure is used by the UE to configure PDCP,
RLC, MAC and the physical layer upon starting and/or stopping to receive a
broadcast MRB transmitted on MTCH, or upon modification of a configuration of
a broadcast MRB received by the UE. The procedure applies to MBS capable UEs
that are interested to receive or that are receiving an MBS broadcast service
that are in RRC_IDLE, RRC_INACTIVE or RRC_CONNECTED with an active BWP with
common search space configured by _searchSpaceMTCH_ or _searchSpaceMCCH_.
NOTE: How to perform a modification of a broadcast MRB which is already
configured in the UE is left to UE implementation.
#### 5.9.3.2 Initiation
The UE applies the broadcast MRB establishment procedure to start receiving an
MBS session of an MBS broadcast service it is interested in. The procedure may
be initiated e.g. upon start of the MBS session, upon entering a cell
providing an MBS broadcast service the UE is interested in, upon becoming
interested in the ongoing MBS broadcast service, upon removal of the UE
capability limitations inhibiting reception of the ongoing MBS broadcast
service UE is interested in.
The UE applies the broadcast MRB release procedure to stop receiving a session
of an MBS broadcast service. The procedure may be initiated e.g. upon stop of
the MBS session, upon leaving the cell broadcasting the MBS service the UE is
interested in, upon losing interest in the MBS service, when capability
limitations start inhibiting reception of the concerned service.
#### 5.9.3.3 Broadcast MRB establishment
Upon a broadcast MRB establishment, the UE shall:
1> establish a PDCP entity and an RLC entity in accordance with _MRB-
InfoBroadcast_ for this broadcast MRB included in the
_MBSBroadcastConfiguration_ message and the configuration specified in
9.1.1.7;
1> configure the MAC layer in accordance with the _mtch-SchedulingInfo_ (if
included);
1> configure the physical layer in accordance with the _mbs-SessionInfoList_ ,
_searchSpaceMTCH,_ and _pdsch-ConfigMTCH_ , applicable for the broadcast MRB;
1> if an SDAP entity with the received _mbs-SessionId_ does not exist:
2> establish an SDAP entity as specified in TS 37.324 [24] clause 5.1.1;
2> indicate the establishment of the user plane resources for the _mbs-
SessionId_ to upper layers;
1> receive DL-SCH on the cell where the _MBSBroadcastConfiguration_ message
was received for the established broadcast MRB using _g-RNTI_ and _mtch-
SchedulingInfo_ (if included) in this message for this MBS broadcast service.
#### 5.9.3.4 Broadcast MRB release
Upon broadcast MRB release for MBS broadcast service, the UE shall:
1> release the PDCP entity, RLC entity as well as the related MAC and physical
layer configuration;
1> if the SDAP entity associated with the corresponding _mbs-SessionId_ has no
associated MRB:
2> release the SDAP entity, as specified in TS 37.324 [24] clause 5.1.2;
2> indicate the release of the user plane resources for the _mbs-SessionId_ to
upper layers.
### 5.9.4 MBS Interest Indication
#### 5.9.4.1 General
Figure 5.9.4.1-1: MBS Interest Indication
The purpose of this procedure is to inform the network that the UE in
RRC_CONNECTED is receiving or is interested to receive MBS broadcast
service(s) and to inform the network about the priority of MBS broadcast
versus unicast and multicast MRB reception. MBS Interest Indication can only
be sent after AS security activation.
#### 5.9.4.2 Initiation
An MBS capable UE in RRC_CONNECTED may initiate the procedure in several cases
including upon successful connection establishment/resume, upon entering or
leaving the broadcast service area, upon MBS broadcast session start or stop,
upon change of interest, upon change of priority between MBS broadcast
reception and unicast/multicast reception, upon change to a PCell providing
_SIB21_ (i.e. where the _SIB1_ scheduling information contains _SIB21_), upon
receiving _SIB20_ of an SCell via dedicated signalling, upon handover, and
upon RRC connection re-establishment.
Upon initiating the procedure, the UE shall:
1> if _SIB21_ is provided by the PCell:
2> ensure having a valid version of _SIB21_ for the PCell;
2> if the UE did not transmit MBS Interest Indication since last entering
RRC_CONNECTED state; or
2> if since the last time the UE transmitted an MBS Interest Indication, the
UE connected to a PCell not providing _SIB21_ :
3> if the set of MBS broadcast frequencies of interest, determined in
accordance with 5.9.4.3, is not empty:
4> set the contents of MBS Interest Indication according to 5.9.4.5 and
initiate transmission of the _MBSInterestIndication_ message;
2> else:
3> if the set of MBS broadcast frequencies of interest, determined in
accordance with 5.9.4.3, is different from _mbs-FreqList_ included in the last
transmission of the MBS Interest Indication; or
3> if the prioritisation of reception of all indicated MBS broadcast
frequencies compared to reception of any of the established unicast bearers
and multicast MRBs has changed since the last transmission of the MBS Interest
Indication:
4> set the contents of MBS Interest Indication according to 5.9.4.5 and
initiate transmission of the _MBSInterestIndication_ message;
NOTE: The UE may send MBS Interest Indication even when it is able to receive
the MBS services it is interested in, i.e. to avoid that the network allocates
a configuration inhibiting MBS broadcast reception.
3> else if _SIB20_ is provided for the PCell or for the SCell:
4> if since the last time the UE transmitted the MBS Interest Indication, the
UE connected to a PCell not providing _SIB20_ and the UE was not provided with
_SIB20_ for an SCell; or
4> if the set of MBS broadcast services of interest determined in accordance
with 5.9.4.4 is different from _mbs-ServiceList_ included in the last
transmission of the MBS Interest Indication:
5> set the contents of MBS Interest Indication according to 5.9.4.5 and
initiate the transmission of _MBSInterestIndication_ message.
#### 5.9.4.3 MBS frequencies of interest determination
The UE shall:
1> consider a frequency to be part of the MBS frequencies of interest if the
following conditions are met:
2> at least one MBS session the UE is receiving or interested to receive via a
broadcast MRB is ongoing or about to start; and
NOTE 1: The UE may determine whether the session is ongoing from the start and
stop time indicated in the User Service Description (USD), see TS 38.300 [2]
or TS 23.247 [67].
2> for at least one of these MBS sessions, _SIB21_ acquired from the PCell
includes mapping between the concerned frequency and one or more MBS FSAIs
indicated in the USD for this session, or for at least one of these MBS
sessions, the concerned frequency is not included in _SIB21_ but is indicated
in the USD for this session; and
NOTE 2: The UE considers a frequency to be part of the MBS frequencies of
interest even though NG-RAN may (temporarily) not employ a broadcast MRB for
the concerned session, i.e., the UE does not verify if the session is
indicated on MCCH.
2> the _supportedBandCombinationList_ the UE included in _UE-NR-Capability_
contains at least one band combination including the concerned MBS frequency.
NOTE 3: When evaluating which frequencies the UE is capable of receiving, the
UE does not take into account whether they are currently configured as serving
frequencies.
#### 5.9.4.4 MBS services of interest determination
The UE shall:
1> consider an MBS service to be part of the MBS services of interest if the
following conditions are met:
2> the UE is receiving or interested to receive this service via a broadcast
MRB; and
2> the session of this service is ongoing or about to start; and
2> one or more MBS FSAIs in the USD for this service is included in _SIB21_
acquired from the PCell for a frequency belonging to the set of MBS
frequencies of interest, determined according to 5.9.4.3 or _SIB21_ acquired
from the PCell does not provide the frequency mapping for the concerned
service but that frequency is included in the USD of this service.
NOTE: The UE may determine whether the session is ongoing from the start and
stop time indicated in the User Service Description (USD), see TS 38.300 [2]
or TS 23.247 [67].
#### 5.9.4.5 Setting of the contents of MBS Interest Indication
The UE shall set the contents of the MBS Interest Indication as follows:
1> if the set of MBS frequencies of interest, determined in accordance with
5.9.4.3, is not empty:
2> include _mbs-FreqList_ and set it to include the MBS frequencies of
interest sorted by decreasing order of interest, using the
_absoluteFrequencySSB for serving frequency_ , if applicable, and the _ARFCN-
ValueNR_(s) as included in _SIB21 or in USD (for neighbouring frequencies)_ ;
2> include _mbs-Priority_ if the UE prioritises reception of all indicated MBS
frequencies above reception of any of the unicast bearers and multicast MRBs;
NOTE 1: If the UE prioritises MBS broadcast reception and unicast/multicast
data cannot be supported because of congestion on the MBS carrier(s), NG-RAN
may for example initiate release of unicast bearers/multicast MRBs.
2> if _SIB20_ is provided for the PCell or for the SCell:
3> include _mbs-ServiceList_ and set it to indicate the set of MBS services of
interest sorted by decreasing order of interest determined in accordance with
5.9.4.4.
NOTE 2: The _mbs-ServiceList_ is not required to be used by the NG-RAN to
determine the frequency on which to enable MBS broadcast reception for the UE.
# 6 Protocol data units, formats and parameters (ASN.1)
## 6.1 General
### 6.1.1 Introduction
The contents of each RRC message is specified in clause 6.2 using ASN.1 to
specify the message syntax and using tables when needed to provide further
detailed information about the fields specified in the message syntax. The
syntax of the information elements that are defined as stand-alone abstract
types is further specified in a similar manner in clause 6.3.
Usage of the text \"Network always configures the UE with a value for this
field\" in the field description indicates that the network has to provide a
value for the field in this or in a previous message based on delta
configuration (for an optional field with Need M). It does not imply a
mandatory presence of the field.
### 6.1.2 Need codes and conditions for optional fields
The need for fields to be present in a message or an abstract type, i.e., the
ASN.1 fields that are specified as OPTIONAL in the abstract notation (ASN.1),
is specified by means of comment text tags attached to the OPTIONAL statement
in the abstract syntax. All comment text tags are available for use in the
downlink direction for RRC message and in the sidelink for PC5 RRC message.
The meaning of each tag is specified in table 6.1.2-1.
If conditions are used, a conditional presence table is provided for the
message or information element specifying the need of the field for each
condition case. The table also specifies whether UE maintains or releases the
value in case the field is absent. The conditions clarify what the UE may
expect regarding the setting of the message by the network for the RRC message
or by the peer UE in the sidelink RRC message. Violation of conditions is
regarded as invalid network behaviour when transmitting downlink RRC message
or invalid UE behavior when transmitting PC5 RRC message, which the UE is not
required to cope with. Hence the general error handling defined in 10.4 does
not apply in case a field is absent although it is mandatory according to the
CondC or CondM condition.
For guidelines on the use of need codes and conditions, see Annex A.6 and A.7.
Table 6.1.2-1: Meaning of abbreviations used to specify the need for fields to
be present
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | Abbreviation | Meaning | +====================+================================================+ | Cond conditionTag | _Conditionally present_ | | | | | | Presence of the field is specified in a | | | tabular form following the ASN.1 segment. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | CondC conditionTag | _Configuration condition_ | | | | | | Presence of the field is conditional to other | | | configuration settings. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | CondM conditionTag | _Message condition_ | | | | | | Presence of the field is conditional to other | | | fields included in the message. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | Need S | _Specified_ | | | | | | Used for (configuration) fields, whose field | | | description or procedure **specifies** the UE | | | behavior performed upon receiving a message | | | with the field absent (and not if field | | | description or procedure specifies the UE | | | behavior when field is not configured). | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | Need M | _Maintain_ | | | | | | Used for (configuration) fields that are | | | stored by the UE i.e. not one-shot. Upon | | | receiving a message with the field absent, the | | | UE maintains the current value. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | Need N | _No action (one-shot configuration that is not | | | maintained)_ | | | | | | Used for (configuration) fields that are not | | | stored and whose presence causes a one-time | | | action by the UE. Upon receiving message with | | | the field absent, the UE takes no action. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | Need R | _Release_ | | | | | | Used for (configuration) fields that are | | | stored by the UE i.e. not one-shot. Upon | | | receiving a message with the field absent, the | | | UE releases the current value. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
NOTE: In this version of the specification, the condition tags CondC and CondM
are not used.
Any field with Need M or Need N in system information shall be interpreted as
Need R.
The need code used within a CondX definition only applies for the case (part
of the condition) where it is defined: A condition may have different need
codes for different parts of the condition. In particular, the CondX
definition may contain the following \"otherwise the field is absent\" parts:
\- \"Otherwise, the field is absent\": The field is not relevant or should not
be configured when this part of the condition applies. In particular, the UE
behaviour is not defined when the field is configured via another part of the
condition and is reconfigured to this part of the condition. A need code is
not provided when the transition from another part of the condition to this
part of the condition is not supported, when the field clearly is a one-shot
or there is no difference whether UE maintains or releases the value (e.g., in
case the field is mandatory present according to the other part of the
condition).
\- \"Otherwise, the field is absent, Need R\": The field is released if absent
when this part of the condition applies. This handles UE behaviour in case the
field is configured via another part of the condition and this part of the
condition applies (which means that network when transmitting downlink RRC
message or peer UE transmitting PC5 RRC message can assume UE releases the
field if this part of the condition is valid).
\- \"Otherwise, the field is absent, Need M\": The UE retains the field if it
was already configured when this part of the condition applies. This means the
network when transmitting downlink RRC message or the peer UE when
transmitting PC5 RRC message cannot release the field, but UE retains the
previously configured value.
Use of different Need codes in different parts of a condition should be
avoided.
For downlink RRC message and sidelink PC5 RRC messages, the need codes,
conditions and ASN.1 defaults specified for a particular (child) field only
apply in case the (parent) field including the particular field is present.
Thus, if the parent is absent the UE shall not release the field unless the
absence of the parent field implies that.
For (parent) fields without need codes in downlink RRC messages or sidelink
PC5 RRC message, if the parent field is absent, UE shall follow the need codes
of the child fields. Thus, if parent field is absent, the need code of each
child field is followed (i.e. Need R child fields are released, Need M child
fields are not modified and the actions for Need S child fields depend on the
specified conditions of each field). Examples of (parent) fields in downlink
RRC messages and sidelink PC5 RRC message without need codes where this rule
applies are:
\- _nonCriticalExtension_ fields at the end of a message using empty SEQUENCE
extension mechanism,
\- groups of non-critical extensions using double brackets (referred to as
extension groups), and
\- non-critical extensions at the end of a message or at the end of a
structure, contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING (referred to as parent
extension fields).
The handling of need codes as specified in the previous is illustrated by
means of an example, as shown in the following ASN.1.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 InformationElement1 OPTIONAL, -- Need M
field2 InformationElement2 OPTIONAL, -- Need R
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v1570-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-1570-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field3 InformationElement3 OPTIONAL, -- Need M
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v1640-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-v1640-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field4 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, -- Need R
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
InformationElement1 ::= SEQUENCE {
field10 InformationElement10 OPTIONAL, -- Need N
field11 InformationElement11 OPTIONAL, -- Need M
field12 InformationElement12 OPTIONAL, -- Need R
...,
[[
field13 InformationElement13 OPTIONAL, -- Need R
field14 InformationElement14 OPTIONAL -- Need M
]]
}
InformationElement2 ::= SEQUENCE {
field21 InformationElement11 OPTIONAL, -- Need M
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The handling of need codes as specified in the previous implies that:
\- if _field1_ in _RRCMessage-IEs_ is absent, UE does not modify or take
action on any child fields configured within _field1_ (regardless of their
need codes);
\- if _field2_ in _RRCMessage-IEs_ is absent, UE releases the _field2_ (and
also its child field _field21_);
\- if _field1_ or _field2_ in _RRCMessage-IEs_ is present, UE retains or
releases their child fields according to the child field presence conditions;
\- if _field1_ in _RRCMessage-IEs_ is present but the extension group
containing _field13_ and _field14_ is absent, the UE releases _field13_ but
does not modify _field14_ ;
\- if _nonCriticalExtension_ defined by IE _RRCMessage-v1570-IEs_ is absent,
the UE does not modify _field3_ but releases _field4_ ;
### 6.1.3 General rules
In the ASN.1 of this specification, the first bit of a bit string refers to
the leftmost bit, unless stated otherwise.
Upon reception of a list not using ToAddModList and ToReleaseList structure,
the UE shall delete all entries of the list currently in the UE configuration
before applying the received list and shall consider each entry as newly
created. This applies also to lists whose size is extended (i.e. with a second
list structure in the ASN.1 comprising additional entries), unless otherwise
specified. This implies that Need M should not be used for fields in the
entries of these lists; if used, UE will handle such fields equivalent to a
Need R.

The IE _BWP_ is used to configure generic parameters of a bandwidth part as
defined in TS 38.211 [16], clause 4.5, and TS 38.213 [13], clause 12.
For each serving cell the network configures at least an initial downlink
bandwidth part and one (if the serving cell is configured with an uplink) or
two (if using supplementary uplink (SUL)) initial uplink bandwidth parts.
Furthermore, the network may configure additional uplink and downlink
bandwidth parts for a serving cell.
The uplink and downlink bandwidth part configurations are divided into common
and dedicated parameters.

If | | _drx-ConfigSecondaryGroup_ is configured, the field is optionally | | present. The network always includes the field if the field was | | previously configured for this SCell and the SCell remains in the | | secondary DRX group. Removal of an individual SCell from the | | secondary DRX group is supported by using an SCell release and | | addition. Otherwise, if _drx-ConfigSecondaryGroup_ is not | | configured, the field is absent and the UE shall release the field. | | The UE shall also release the field if _drx-ConfigSecondaryGroup_ is | | released without including _sCellToAddModList_. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_smtc_** | | | | The SSB periodicity/offset/duration configuration of target cell for | | NR SCell addition. The network sets the _periodicityAndOffset_ to | | indicate the same periodicity as _ssb-periodicityServingCell_ in | | _sCellConfigCommon_. The _smtc_ is based on the timing of the SpCell | | of associated cell group. In case of inter-RAT handover to NR, the | | timing reference is the NR PCell. In case of intra-NR PCell change | | (standalone NR) or NR PSCell change (EN-DC), the timing reference is | | the target SpCell. If the field is absent, the UE uses the SMTC in | | the _measObjectNR_ having the same SSB frequency and subcarrier | | spacing, as configured before the reception of the RRC message. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

+----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | _PDCCH-ConfigCommon_ field descriptions | +======================================================================+ | **_commonControlResourceSet_** | | | | An additional common control resource set which may be configured | | and used for any common or UE-specific search space. If the network | | configures this field, it uses a _ControlResourceSetId_ other than 0 | | for this _ControlResourceSet_. The network configures the | | _commonControlResourceSet_ in _SIB1_ so that it is contained in the | | bandwidth of CORESET#0. If the RedCap-specific initial downlink BWP | | does not contain the entire CORESET#0, the network configures the | | _commonControlResourceSet_ in the RedCap-specific initial downlink | | BWP in _SIB1_ for RedCap such that it does not have to be contained | | in the bandwidth of CORESET#0. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_commonSearchSpaceList, commonSearchSpaceListExt,_** | | **_commonSearchSpaceListExt2_** | | | | A list of additional common search spaces. If the network configures | | this field, it uses the _SearchSpaceId_ s other than 0. If the field | | is included, it replaces any previous list, i.e. all the entries of | | the list are replaced and each of the _SearchSpace_ entries is | | considered to be newly created and the conditions and Need codes for | | setup of the entry apply.

Conditional Presence Explanation
* * *
_InitialBWP-Only_ If _SIB1_ is broadcast the field is mandatory present in the
_PDCCH-ConfigCommon_ of the initial BWP (BWP#0) in _ServingCellConfigCommon
except it is the RedCap-specific initial BWP not including CD-SSB and the
entire CORESET#0_ ; it is absent in other BWPs and when sent in system
information. If SIB1 is not broadcast and there is an SSB associated to the
cell, the field is optionally present, Need M, in the _PDCCH-ConfigCommon_ of
the initial BWP (BWP#0) in _ServingCellConfigCommon_ (still with the same
setting for all UEs). In other cases, the field is absent. _OtherBWP_ This
field is optionally present, Need R, if this BWP is not the
_initialDownlinkBWP_ and _pagingSearchSpace_ is configured in this BWP.
Otherwise this field is absent. _InitialBWP-Paging_ This field is optionally
present, Need R, if this BWP is the _initialDownlinkBWP_ or
_initialDownlinkBWP-RedCap_ including CD-SSB and the entire CORESET#0, and
_pei-Config_ is configured in _DownlinkConfigCommonSIB_. Otherwise, this field
is absent.

The field may | | only be included if the UE is connected to 5GC. Otherwise the field | | is absent. The network configures all DRBs with the same PDU-session | | ID with same value for this field. The value for this field cannot | | be changed after the DRB is set up. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_discardTimer_** | | | | Value in ms of _discardTimer_ specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value | | _ms10_ corresponds to 10 ms, value _ms20_ corresponds to 20 ms and | | so on. The value for this field cannot be changed in case of | | reconfiguration with sync, if the bearer is configured as DAPS | | bearer. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_discardTimerExt_** | | | | Value in ms of _discardTimer_ specified in TS 38.323 [5]. Value | | _ms0dot5_ corresponds to 0.5 ms, value _ms1_ corresponds to 1ms and | | so on.

This field can be configured for both | | DRB and multicast MRB. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_duplicationState_** | | | | This field indicates the uplink PDCP duplication state for the | | associated RLC entities at the time of receiving this IE. If set to | | _true,_ the PDCP duplication state is activated for the associated | | RLC entity. The index for the indication is determined by ascending | | order of logical channel ID of all RLC entities other than the | | primary RLC entity indicated by _primaryPath_ in the order of MCG | | and SCG, as in clause 6.1.3.32 of TS 38.321 [3]. If the number of | | associated RLC entities other than the primary RLC entity is two, UE | | ignores the value in the largest index of this field. If the field | | is absent, the PDCP duplication states are deactivated for all | | associated RLC entities. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_ethernetHeaderCompression_** | | | | **_This fields configures Ethernet Header Compression. This field | | can only be configured for a bi-directional DRB or a bi-directional | | multicast MRB._** The network reconfigures | | _ethernetHeaderCompression_ only upon reconfiguration involving PDCP | | re-establishment and with neither _drb-ContinueEHC-DL_ nor | | _drb-ContinueEHC-UL_ configured.

If _uplinkOnlyROHC_ is | | configured, the UE shall apply the configured ROHC profile(s) in | | uplink (there is no header compression in downlink). ROHC can be | | configured for any bearer type. ROHC and EHC can be both configured | | simultaneously for a DRB or a multicast MRB. The network | | reconfigures _headerCompression_ only upon reconfiguration involving | | PDCP re-establishment or involving PDCP entity reconfiguration to | | configure DAPS bearer(s), and without any _drb-ContinueROHC_. | | Network configures _headerCompression_ to _notUsed_ when | | _outOfOrderDelivery_ is configured.

This field should be either always | | present or always absent, after the radio bearer is established. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_pdcp-Duplication_** | | | | Indicates whether or not uplink duplication status at the time of | | receiving this IE is configured and activated as specified in TS | | 38.323 [5]. The presence of this field indicates that duplication | | is configured. PDCP duplication is not configured for CA packet | | duplication of LTE RLC bearer. The value of this field, when the | | field is present, indicates the state of the duplication at the time | | of receiving this IE. If set to _true_ , duplication is activated. | | The value of this field is always _true_ , when configured for a SRB. | | For PDCP entity with more than two associated RLC entities for UL | | transmission, this field is always present.

Conditional Presence Explanation
* * *
_SCellAddOnly_ It is optionally present, Need S, for (non-PUCCH) SCells when
adding a new SCell. The field is absent, Need M, when reconfiguring SCells.
The field is also absent for the SpCells as well as for a PUCCH SCell.
#### \-- _PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList_
The IE _PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocation_ is used to configure a time domain
relation between PDCCH and PDSCH. The _PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocationList_
contains one or more of such _PDSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocations_. The
network indicates in the DL assignment which of the configured time domain
allocations the UE shall apply for that DL assignment. The UE determines the
bit width of the DCI field based on the number of entries in the _PDSCH-
TimeDomainResourceAllocationList_. Value 0 in the DCI field refers to the
first element in this list, value 1 in the DCI field refers to the second
element in this list, and so on.

contains one or more of such _PUSCH-TimeDomainResourceAllocations_. The
network indicates in the UL grant which of the configured time domain
allocations the UE shall apply for that UL grant. The UE determines the bit
width of the DCI field based on the number of entries in the _PUSCH-
TimeDomainResourceAllocationList_. Value 0 in the DCI field refers to the
first element in this list, value 1 in the DCI field refers to the second
element in this list, and so on.

#### \-- _ReportConfigNR_
The IE _ReportConfigNR_ specifies criteria for triggering of an NR measurement
reporting event or of a CHO, CPA or CPC event or of an L2 U2N relay
measurement reporting event. For events labelled AN with N equal to 1, 2 and
so on, measurement reporting events and CHO, CPA or CPC events are based on
cell measurement results, which can either be derived based on SS/PBCH block
or CSI-RS.
Event A1: Serving becomes better than absolute threshold;
Event A2: Serving becomes worse than absolute threshold;
Event A3: Neighbour becomes amount of offset better than PCell/PSCell;
Event A4: Neighbour becomes better than absolute threshold;
Event A5: PCell/PSCell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND
Neighbour/SCell becomes better than another absolute threshold2;
Event A6: Neighbour becomes amount of offset better than SCell;
Event D1: Distance between UE and a reference location _referenceLocation1_
becomes larger than configured threshold _distanceThreshFromReference1_ and
distance between UE and a reference location _referenceLocation2_ becomes
shorter than configured threshold _distanceThreshFromReference2_ ;
CondEvent A3: Conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes amount of offset
better than PCell/PSCell;
CondEvent A4: Conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes better than
absolute threshold;
CondEvent A5: PCell/PSCell becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND
Conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes better than another absolute
threshold2;
CondEvent D1: Distance between UE and a reference location
_referenceLocation1_ becomes larger than configured threshold
_distanceThreshFromReference1_ and distance between UE and a reference
location _referenceLocation2_ of conditional reconfiguration candidate becomes
shorter than configured threshold _distanceThreshFromReference2_ ;
CondEvent T1: Time measured at UE becomes more than configured threshold
_t1-Threshold_ but is less than _t1-Threshold + duration_ ;
Event X1: Serving L2 U2N Relay UE becomes worse than absolute threshold1 AND
NR Cell becomes better than another absolute threshold2;
Event X2: Serving L2 U2N Relay UE becomes worse than absolute threshold;
For event I1, measurement reporting event is based on CLI measurement results,
which can either be derived based on SRS-RSRP or CLI-RSSI.
Event I1: Interference becomes higher than absolute threshold.

The bit(s) set to one identify the first OFDM | | symbol(s) of the control resource set within a slot. If the cyclic | | prefix of the BWP is set to extended CP, the last two bits within | | the bit string shall be ignored by the UE or IAB-MT. | | | | For DCI format 2_0, the first one symbol applies if the _duration_ | | of CORESET (in the IE _ControlResourceSet_) identified by | | _controlResourceSetId_ indicates 3 symbols, the first two symbols | | apply if the _duration_ of CORESET identified by | | _controlResourceSetId_ indicates 2 symbols, and the first three | | symbols apply if the _duration_ of CORESET identified by | | _controlResourceSetId_ indicates 1 symbol. | | | | See TS 38.213 [13], clause 10. | | | | For IAB-MT: For DCI format 2_0 or DCI format 2_5, the first one | | symbol applies if the duration of CORESET (in the IE | | _ControlResourceSet_) identified by _controlResourceSetId_ indicates | | 3 symbols, the first two symbols apply if the _duration_ of CORESET | | identified by _controlResourceSetId_ indicates 2 symbols, and the | | first three symbols apply if the _duration_ of CORESET identified by | | _controlResourceSetId_ indicates 1 symbol. | | | | See TS 38.213 [13], clause 10. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_nrofCandidates-CI_** | | | | The number of PDCCH candidates specifically for format 2-4 for the | | configured aggregation level. If an aggregation level is absent, the | | UE does not search for any candidates with that aggregation level. | | The network configures only one aggregationLevel and the | | corresponding number of candidates (see TS 38.213 [13], clause | | 10.1). | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_nrofCandidates-PEI_** | | | | The number of PDCCH candidates specifically for format 2-7 for the | | configured aggregation level. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_nrofCandidates-SFI_** | | | | The number of PDCCH candidates specifically for format 2-0 for the | | configured aggregation level. If an aggregation level is absent, the | | UE does not search for any candidates with that aggregation level. | | The network configures only one aggregationLevel and the | | corresponding number of candidates (see TS 38.213 [13], clause | | 11.1.1). For a search space configured with | | _freqMonitorLocations-r16_ , only value ′n1′ is valid. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_nrofCandidates_** | | | | Number of PDCCH candidates per aggregation level. The number of | | candidates and aggregation levels configured here applies to all | | formats unless a particular value is specified or a format-specific | | value is provided (see inside _searchSpaceType_). If configured in | | the _SearchSpace_ of a cross carrier scheduled cell, this field | | determines the number of candidates and aggregation levels to be | | used on the linked scheduling cell (see TS 38.213 [13], clause | | 10). | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_searchSpaceGroupIdList-r16, searchSpaceGroupIdList-r17_** | | | | List of search space group IDs which the search space is associated | | with. The network configures at most 2 search space groups per BWP | | where the group ID is either 0 or 1 if _searchSpaceGroupIdList-r16_ | | is included. The network configures at most 3 search space groups | | per BWP where the group ID is either 0, 1 or 2 if | | _searchSpaceGroupIdList-r17_ is included. And if | | _searchSpaceGroupIdList-r17_ is included, | | _searchSpaceGroupIdList-r16_ is ignored. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_searchSpaceId_** | | | | Identity of the search space. SearchSpaceId = 0 identifies the | | _searchSpaceZero_ configured via PBCH (MIB) or | | _ServingCellConfigCommon_ and may hence not be used in the | | _SearchSpace_ IE. The _searchSpaceId_ is unique among the BWPs of a | | Serving Cell. In case of cross carrier scheduling, search spaces | | with the same _searchSpaceId_ in scheduled cell and scheduling cell | | are linked to each other. The UE applies the search space for the | | scheduled cell only if the DL BWPs in which the linked search spaces | | are configured in scheduling cell and scheduled cell are both | | active. | | | | For an IAB-MT, the search space defines how/where to search for | | PDCCH candidates for an IAB-MT where each search space is associated | | with one ControlResearchSet and for a scheduled cell in the case of | | cross carrier scheduling, except for nrofCandidates, all the | | optional fields are absent. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_SearchSpaceLinkingId_** | | | | **_This parameter is used to link two search spaces of same type in | | the same BWP. If two search spaces have the same_** | | SearchSpaceLinkingId UE assumes these search spaces are linked to | | PDCCH repetition REF. When PDCCH repetition is monitored in two | | linked search space (SS) sets, the UE does not expect a third | | monitored SS set to be linked with any of the two linked SS sets. | | The two linked SS sets have the same SS set type (USS/CSS). The two | | linked SS sets have the same DCI formats to monitor. For intra-slot | | PDCCH repetition: The two SS sets should have the same periodicity | | and offset (monitoringSlotPeriodicityAndOffset), and the same | | duration. For linking monitoring occasions across the two SS sets | | that exist in the same slot: The two SS sets have the same number of | | monitoring occasions within a slot and n-th monitoring occasion of | | one SS set is linked to n-th monitoring occasion of the other SS | | set. The following SS sets cannot be linked with another SS set for | | PDCCH repetition: SS set 0, _searchSpaceSIB1_ , | | _searchSpaceOtherSystemInformation_ , _pagingSearchSpace_ , | | _ra-SearchSpace_ , _searchSpaceMCCH_ , _searchSpaceMTCH_ , | | _peiSearchSpace_ , and _sdt-SearchSpace_. SS set configured by | | _recoverySearchSpaceId_ cannot be linked to another SS set for PDCCH | | repetition. When a scheduled serving cell is configured to be | | cross-carrier scheduled by a scheduling serving cell, two PDCCH | | candidates (with the same AL and candidate index associated with the | | scheduled serving cell) are linked only if the corresponding two SS | | sets in the scheduling serving cell are linked and two SS sets in | | the scheduled serving cell with the same SS set IDs are also linked. | | | | This parameter is not applicable to search space configured with | | _dci-FormatsSL_ for monitoring format 3-0 or format 3-1 or for | | monitoring formats 3-0 and format 3-1. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_searchSpaceType_** | | | | Indicates whether this is a common search space (present) or a UE | | specific search space as well as DCI formats to monitor for. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_ue-Specific_** | | | | Configures this search space as UE specific search space (USS). The | | UE monitors the DCI format with CRC scrambled by C-RNTI, CS-RNTI (if | | configured), and SP-CSI-RNTI (if configured) | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+

#### \-- _ServCellIndex_
The IE _ServCellIndex_ concerns a short identity, used to uniquely identify a
serving cell (i.e. the PCell, the PSCell or an SCell) across the cell groups.
Value 0 applies for the PCell, while the _SCellIndex_ that has previously been
assigned applies for SCells.

#### \-- _ServingCellConfig_
The IE _ServingCellConfig_ is used to configure (add or modify) the UE with a
serving cell, which may be the SpCell or an SCell of an MCG or SCG. The
parameters herein are mostly UE specific but partly also cell specific (e.g.
in additionally configured bandwidth parts). Reconfiguration between a PUCCH
and PUCCHless SCell is only supported using an SCell release and add.

#### \-- _ServingCellConfigCommon_
The IE _ServingCellConfigCommon_ is used to configure cell specific parameters
of a UE\'s serving cell. The IE contains parameters which a UE would typically
acquire from SSB, MIB or SIBs when accessing the cell from IDLE. With this IE,
the network provides this information in dedicated signalling when configuring
a UE with a SCells or with an additional cell group (SCG). It also provides it
for SpCells (MCG and SCG) upon reconfiguration with sync.

The network always configures | | this field if channel access procedures are required for the serving | | cell within this region by regulations. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_dmrs-TypeA-Position_** | | | | Position of (first) DM-RS for downlink (see TS 38.211 [16], clause | | 7.4.1.1.1) and uplink (TS 38.211 [16], clause 6.4.1.1.3). | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_downlinkConfigCommon_** | | | | The common downlink configuration of the serving cell, including the | | frequency information configuration and the initial downlink BWP | | common configuration. The parameters provided herein should match | | the parameters configured by MIB and SIB1 (if provided) of the | | serving cell, with the exception of _controlResourceSetZero_ and | | _searchSpaceZero_ which can be configured in | | _ServingCellConfigCommon_ even if MIB indicates that they are | | absent. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_discoveryBurstWindowLength_** | | | | Indicates the window length of the discovery burst in ms (see TS | | 37.213 [48]). The field _discoveryBurstWindowLength-r17_ is | | applicable to SCS 480 kHz and SCS 960 kHz. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_featurePriorities_** | | | | Indicates priorities for features, such as RedCap, Slicing, SDT and | | MSG3-Repetitions for Coverage Enhancements. These priorities are | | used to determine which _FeatureCombinationPreambles_ the UE shall | | use when a feature maps to more than one | | _FeatureCombinationPreambles_ , as specified in TS 38.321 [3]. A | | lower value means a higher priority. The network does not signal the | | same priority for more than one feature.

If the field is absent, the UE applies the value | | defined for the duplex mode and frequency range of this serving | | cell. See TS 38.133 [14], table 7.1.2-2. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_ra-ChannelAccess_** | | | | If present, this field indicates that the UE shall apply channel | | access procedures before msg1/msgA transmission for operation with | | shared spectrum channel access in accordance with TS 37.213 [48], | | clause 4.4.5 for FR2-2. | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_rateMatchPatternToAddModList_** | | | | Resources patterns which the UE should rate match PDSCH around.

(see TS 38.213 | | [13], clause 4.1) | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_ssb-PositionQCL_** | | | | **Indicates the QCL relation between SSB positions for this serving | | cell as specified in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1.** | +----------------------------------------------------------------------+ | **_ssb-PositionsInBurst_** | | | | For operation in licensed spectrum, indicates the time domain | | positions of the transmitted SS-blocks in a half frame with SS/PBCH | | blocks as defined in TS 38.213 [13], clause 4.1. The | | first/leftmost bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 0, the second | | bit corresponds to SS/PBCH block index 1, and so on. Value 0 in the | | bitmap indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH block is not | | transmitted while value 1 indicates that the corresponding SS/PBCH | | block is transmitted. The network configures the same pattern in | | this field as in the corresponding field in | | ServingCellConfigCommonSIB. | | | | For operation with shared spectrum channel access, the UE assumes | | that one or more SS/PBCH blocks indicated by _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ | | may be transmitted within the discovery burst transmission window | | and have candidate SS/PBCH blocks indexes corresponding to SS/PBCH | | block indexes provided by _ssb-PositionsInBurst_ (see TS 38.213 | | [13], clause 4.1).

#### \-- _FeatureSetCombination_
The IE _FeatureSetCombination_ is a two-dimensional matrix of _FeatureSet_
entries.
Each _FeatureSetsPerBand_ contains a list of feature sets applicable to the
carrier(s) of one band entry of the associated band combination. Across the
associated bands, the UE shall support the combination of _FeatureSets_ at the
same position in the _FeatureSetsPerBand_. All _FeatureSetsPerBand_ in one
_FeatureSetCombination_ must have the same number of entries.
The number of _FeatureSetsPerBand_ in the _FeatureSetCombination_ must be
equal to the number of band entries in an associated band combination. The
first _FeatureSetPerBand_ applies to the first band entry of the band
combination, and so on.
Each _FeatureSet_ contains either a pair of NR or E-UTRA feature set IDs for
UL and DL.
In case of NR, the actual feature sets for UL and DL are defined in the
_FeatureSets_ IE and referred to from here by their ID, i.e., their position
in the _featureSetsUplink_ / _featureSetsDownlink_ list in the FeatureSet IE.
In case of E-UTRA, the feature sets referred to from this list are defined in
TS 36.331 [10] and conveyed as part of the _UE-EUTRA-Capability_ container.
The _FeatureSetUplink_ and _FeatureSetDownlink_ referred to from the
_FeatureSet_ comprise, among other information, a set of
_FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Ids_ and _FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC-Ids_. The number of
these per-CC IDs determines the number of carriers that the UE is able to
aggregate contiguously in frequency domain in the corresponding band. The
number of carriers supported by the UE is also restricted by the bandwidth
class indicated in the associated _BandCombination_ , if present.
In feature set combinations the UE shall exclude entries with same or lower
capabilities, since the network may anyway assume that the UE supports those.
NOTE 1: The UE may advertise fallback band-combinations in which it supports
additional functionality explicitly in two ways: Either by setting FeatureSet
IDs to zero (inter-band and intra-band non-contiguous fallback) and by
reducing the number of FeatureSet-PerCC Ids in a Feature Set (intra-band
contiguous fallback). Or by separate _BandCombination_ entries with associated
_FeatureSetCombinations_.
NOTE 2: The UE may advertise a _FeatureSetCombination_ containing only
fallback band combinations. That means, in a _FeatureSetCombination,_ each
group of _FeatureSets_ across the bands may contain at least one pair of
_FeatureSetUplinkId_ and _FeatureSetDownlinkId_ which is set to 0/0.
NOTE 3: The Network configures serving cell(s) and BWP(s) configuration to
comply with capabilities derived from the combination of FeatureSets at the
same position in the FeatureSetsPerBand, regardless of activated/deactivated
serving cell(s) and BWP(s).

The IE _FeatureSetCombinationId_ identifies a _FeatureSetCombination_. The
_FeatureSetCombinationId_ of a _FeatureSetCombination_ is the position of the
_FeatureSetCombination_ in the featureSetCombinations list (in _UE-NR-
Capability_ or _UE-MRDC-Capability_). The _FeatureSetCombinationId_ = 0 refers
to the first entry in the _featureSetCombinations_ list (in _UE-NR-Capability_
or _UE-MRDC-Capability_).
NOTE: The _FeatureSetCombinationId_ = 1024 is not used due to the maximum
entry number of _featureSetCombinations_.

#### \-- _FeatureSetDownlinkId_
The IE _FeatureSetDownlinkId_ identifies a downlink feature set. The
_FeatureSetDownlinkId_ of a _FeatureSetDownlink_ is the index position of the
_FeatureSetDownlink_ in the _featureSetsDownlink_ list in the _FeatureSets_
IE. The first element in that list is referred to by _FeatureSetDownlinkId_ =
1. The _FeatureSetDownlinkId=0_ is not used by an actual _FeatureSetDownlink_
but means that the UE does not support a carrier in this band of a band
combination.

#### \-- _FeatureSets_
The IE _FeatureSets_ is used to provide pools of downlink and uplink features
sets. A _FeatureSetCombination_ refers to the IDs of the feature set(s) that
the UE supports in that _FeatureSetCombination_. The _BandCombination_ entries
in the _BandCombinationList_ then indicate the ID of the
_FeatureSetCombination_ that the UE supports for that band combination.
The entries in the lists in this IE are identified by their index position.
For example, the _FeatureSetUplinkPerCC-Id_ = 4 identifies the 4^th^ element
in the _featureSetsUplinkPerCC_ list.
NOTE: When feature sets (per CC) IEs require extension in future versions of
the specification, new versions of the _FeatureSetDownlink_ ,
_FeatureSetUplink_ , _FeatureSets_ , _FeatureSetDownlinkPerCC_ and/or
_FeatureSetUplinkPerCC_ will be created and instantiated in corresponding new
lists in the _FeatureSets_ IE. For example, if new capability bits are to be
added to the _FeatureSetDownlink_ , they will instead be defined in a new
_FeatureSetDownlink-rxy_ which will be instantiated in a new
_featureSetDownlinkList-rxy_ list. If a UE indicates in a
_FeatureSetCombination_ that it supports the _FeatureSetDownlink_ with ID #5,
it implies that it supports both the features in _FeatureSetDownlink_ #5 and
_FeatureSetDownlink-rxy_ #5 (if present). The number of entries in the new
list(s) shall be the same as in the original list(s).

## 7.4 UE variables
NOTE: To facilitate the specification of the UE behavioural requirements, UE
variables are represented using ASN.1. Unless explicitly specified otherwise,
it is however up to UE implementation how to store the variables. The
optionality of the IEs in ASN.1 is used only to indicate that the values may
not always be available.

# 8 Protocol data unit abstract syntax
## 8.1 General
The RRC PDU contents in clause 6 and clause 10 are described using abstract
syntax notation one (ASN.1) as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.680 [6] and X.681
[7]. Transfer syntax for RRC PDUs is derived from their ASN.1 definitions by
use of Packed Encoding Rules, unaligned as specified in ITU-T Rec. X.691 [8].
The following encoding rules apply in addition to what has been specified in
X.691:
\- When a bit string value is placed in a bit-field as specified in 15.6 to
15.11 in X.691, the leading bit of the bit string value shall be placed in the
leading bit of the bit-field, and the trailing bit of the bit string value
shall be placed in the trailing bit of the bit-field;
NOTE: The terms \'leading bit\' and \'trailing bit\' are defined in ITU-T Rec.
X.680. When using the \'bstring\' notation, the leading bit of the bit string
value is on the left, and the trailing bit of the bit string value is on the
right.
\- When decoding types constrained with the ASN.1 Contents Constraint
(\"CONTAINING\"), automatic decoding of the contained type should not be
performed because errors in the decoding of the contained type should not
cause the decoding of the entire RRC message PDU to fail. It is recommended
that the decoder first decodes the outer PDU type that contains the OCTET
STRING or BIT STRING with the Contents Constraint, and then decodes the
contained type that is nested within the OCTET STRING or BIT STRING as a
separate step;
\- When decoding a) RRC message PDUs, b) BIT STRING constrained with a
Contents Constraint, or c) OCTET STRING constrained with a Contents
Constraint, PER decoders are required to never report an error if there are
extraneous zero or non-zero bits at the end of the encoded RRC message PDU,
BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.
## 8.2 Structure of encoded RRC messages
An RRC PDU, which is the bit string that is exchanged between peer
entities/across the radio interface contains the basic production as defined
in X.691.
RRC PDUs shall be mapped to and from PDCP SDUs (in case of DCCH) or RLC SDUs
(in case of PCCH, BCCH or CCCH) upon transmission and reception as follows:
\- when delivering an RRC PDU as an PDCP SDU to the PDCP layer for
transmission, the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first
bit in the PDCP SDU and onwards; and
\- when delivering an RRC PDU as an RLC SDU to the RLC layer for transmission,
the first bit of the RRC PDU shall be represented as the first bit in the RLC
SDU and onwards; and
\- upon reception of an PDCP SDU from the PDCP layer, the first bit of the
PDCP SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards; and
\- upon reception of an RLC SDU from the RLC layer, the first bit of the RLC
SDU shall represent the first bit of the RRC PDU and onwards.
## 8.3 Basic production
The \'basic production\' is obtained by applying UNALIGNED PER to the abstract
syntax value (the ASN.1 description) as specified in X.691. It always contains
a multiple of 8 bits.
## 8.4 Extension
The following rules apply with respect to the use of protocol extensions:
\- A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall,
unless explicitly indicated otherwise on a PDU type basis, set the extension
part empty. Transmitters compliant with a later version may send non-empty
extensions;
\- A transmitter compliant with this version of the specification shall set
spare bits to zero.
## 8.5 Padding
If the encoded RRC message does not fill a transport block, the RRC layer
shall add padding bits. This applies to PCCH and BCCH.
Padding bits shall be set to 0 and the number of padding bits is a multiple of
8.
Figure 8.5-1: RRC level padding
# 9 Specified and default radio configurations
Specified and default configurations are configurations of which the details
are specified in the standard. Specified configurations are fixed while
default configurations can be modified using dedicated signalling. The default
value for the parameters not listed in following clauses shall be set such as
the corresponding features are not configured, i.e. _release_ or _false_
unless explicitly stated otherwise.
NOTE: The UE applies the default values specified in the field description of
ASN.1 parameters only when the parent IE is present. Hence, the UE does not
apply all default values in field descriptions when it applies the \"default
radio configuration\" in accordance with this clause.

### 9.1.2 Void
## 9.2 Default radio configurations
The following clauses only list default values for REL-15 parameters included
in protocol version v15.3.0. For all fields introduced in a later protocol
version, the default value is \"released\" or \"false\" unless explicitly
specified otherwise. If the UE is to apply default configuration while it is
configured with some critically extended fields, the UE shall apply the
original version of those fields with only default values.
NOTE 1: In general, the signalling should preferably support a \"release\"
option for fields introduced after v15.3.0. The \"value not applicable\"
should be used restrictively, mainly limited to for fields which value is
relevant only if another field is set to a value other than its default.
NOTE 2: For parameters in _ServingCellConfig_ , the default values are
specified in the corresponding specification.

# 10 Generic error handling
## 10.1 General
The generic error handling defined in the subsequent clauses applies unless
explicitly specified otherwise e.g. within the procedure specific error
handling.
The UE shall consider a value as not comprehended when it is set:
\- to an extended value that is not defined in the version of the transfer
syntax supported by the UE;
\- to a spare or reserved value unless the specification defines specific
behaviour that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/reserved
value.
The UE shall consider a field as not comprehended when it is defined:
\- as spare or reserved unless the specification defines specific behaviour
that the UE shall apply upon receiving the concerned spare/reserved field.
## 10.2 ASN.1 violation or encoding error
The UE shall:
1> when receiving an RRC message on the BCCH, CCCH, PCCH, MCCH or a PC5 RRC
message on SBCCH for which the abstract syntax is invalid [6]:
2> ignore the message.
NOTE: This clause applies in case one or more fields is set to a value, other
than a spare, reserved or extended value, not defined in this version of the
transfer syntax. E.g. in the case the UE receives value 12 for a field defined
as INTEGER (1..11). In cases like this, it may not be possible to reliably
detect which field is in the error hence the error handling is at the message
level.
## 10.3 Field set to a not comprehended value
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message or PC5 RRC message on any logical
channel:
1> if the message includes a field that has a value that the UE does not
comprehend:
2> if a default value is defined for this field:
3> treat the message while using the default value defined for this field;
2> else if the concerned field is optional:
3> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with the
need code for absence of the concerned field;
2> else:
3> treat the message as if the field were absent and in accordance with clause
10.4.
## 10.4 Mandatory field missing
The UE shall:
1> if the message includes a field that is mandatory to include in the message
(e.g. because conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) and that field
is absent or treated as absent:
2> if the RRC message was not received on DCCH or CCCH; or
2> if the PC5 RRC message was not received on SCCH:
3> if the field concerns a (sub-field of) an entry of a list (i.e. a SEQUENCE
OF):
4> treat the list as if the entry including the missing or not comprehended
field was absent;
3> else if the field concerns a sub-field of another field, referred to as the
\'parent\' field i.e. the field that is one nesting level up compared to the
erroneous field:
4> consider the \'parent\' field to be set to a not comprehended value;
4> apply the generic error handling to the subsequent \'parent\' field(s),
until reaching the top nesting level i.e. the message level;
3> else (field at message level):
4> ignore the message.
NOTE 1: The error handling defined in these clauses implies that the UE
ignores a message with the message type or version set to a not comprehended
value.
NOTE 2: The nested error handling for messages received on logical channels
other than DCCH, CCCH and SCCH applies for errors in extensions also, even for
errors that can be regarded as invalid network operation e.g. the network not
observing conditional presence.
NOTE 3: UE behaviour on receipt of an RRC message on DCCH or CCCH or a PC5 RRC
message on SCCH that does not include a field that is mandatory (e.g. because
conditions for mandatory presence are fulfilled) is unspecified.
The following ASN.1 further clarifies the levels applicable in case of nested
error handling for errors in extension fields.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
\-- Example with extension addition group
ItemInfoList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..max)) OFItemInfo
ItemInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
itemIdentity INTEGER (1..max),
field1 Field1,
field2 Field2 OPTIONAL, -- Need N
...
[[
field3-r9 Field3-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Cond Cond1
field4-r9 Field4-r9 OPTIONAL -- Need N
]]
}
\-- Example with traditional non-critical extension (empty sequence)
BroadcastInfoBlock1 ::= SEQUENCE {
itemIdentity INTEGER (1..max),
field1 Field1,
field2 Field2 OPTIONAL, -- Need N
nonCriticalExtension BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs OPTIONAL
}
BroadcastInfoBlock1-v940-IEs::= SEQUENCE {
field3-r9 Field3-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Cond Cond1
field4-r9 Field4-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Need N
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL -- Need S
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The UE shall, apply the following principles regarding the levels applicable
in case of nested error handling:
\- an extension addition group is not regarded as a level on its own. E.g. in
the ASN.1 extract in the previous, a error regarding the conditionality of
_field3_ would result in the entire itemInfo entry to be ignored (rather than
just the extension addition group containing _field3_ and _field4_);
\- a traditional _nonCriticalExtension_ is not regarded as a level on its own.
E.g. in the ASN.1 extract in the previous, an error regarding the
conditionality of _field3_ would result in the entire _BroadcastInfoBlock1_ to
be ignored (rather than just the non-critical extension containing _field3_
and _field4_).
## 10.5 Not comprehended field
The UE shall, when receiving an RRC message on any logical channel:
1> if the message includes a field that the UE does not comprehend:
2> treat the rest of the message as if the field was absent.
NOTE: This clause does not apply to the case of an extension to the value
range of a field. Such cases are addressed instead by the requirements in
clause 10.3.
# 11 Radio information related interactions between network nodes
## 11.1 General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are transferred between network nodes.
These RRC messages may be transferred to or from the UE via another Radio
Access Technology. Consequently, these messages have similar characteristics
as the RRC messages that are transferred across the NR radio interface, i.e.
the same transfer syntax and protocol extension mechanisms apply.
## 11.2 Inter-node RRC messages
### 11.2.1 General
This clause specifies RRC messages that are sent either across the X2-, Xn- or
the NG-interface, either to or from the gNB, i.e. a single \'logical channel\'
is used for all RRC messages transferred across network nodes. The information
could originate from or be destined for another RAT.

### 11.2.3 Mandatory information in inter-node RRC messages
For the _AS-Config_ transferred within the _HandoverPreparationInformation_ :
\- The source node shall include all fields necessary to reflect the current
AS configuration of the UE, except for the fields _sourceSCG-NR-Config_ ,
_sourceSCG-EUTRA-Config_ and _sourceRB-SN-Config_ , which can be omitted in
case the source MN did not receive the latest configuration from the source
SN. For _RRCReconfiguration_ included in the field _rrcReconfiguration_ ,
_ReconfigurationWithSync_ is included with only the mandatory subfields (e.g.
_newUE-Identity_ and _t304_) and _ServingCellConfigCommon_ ;
\- Need codes or conditions specified for subfields according to IEs defined
in clause 6 do not apply. I.e. some fields shall be included regardless of the
\"Need\" or \"Cond\" e.g. _discardTimer_ ;
\- Based on the received AS configuration, the target node can indicate the
delta (difference) to the current AS configuration (as included in
_HandoverCommand_)to the UE. The fields _newUE-Identity_ and _t304_ included
in _ReconfigurationWithSync_ are not used for delta configuration purpose.
The _candidateCellInfoListSN_(-_EUTRA_) in _CG-Config_ and the
_candidateCellInfoListMN_(_-EUTRA_)/_candidateCellInfoListSN_(-_EUTRA_) in
_CG-ConfigInfo_ need not be included in procedures that do not involve a
change of node.
For fields _scg-CellGroupConfig, scg-CellGroupConfigEUTRA and scg-RB-Config_
in _CG-Config (sent upon SN initiated SN change or_ other conditions as
specified in field descriptions _)_ and fields _mcg-RB-Config_ , _scg-RB-
Config_ and _sourceConfigSCG_ in _CG-ConfigInfo_ (_sent_ upon change of SN):
\- The source node shall include all fields necessary to reflect the current
AS configuration of the UE, unless stated otherwise in the field description.
For _RRCReconfiguration_ included in the field _scg-CellGroupConfig in CG-
Config_ , _ReconfigurationWithSync_ is included with only the mandatory
subfields (e.g. _newUE-Identity_ and _t304_) and _ServingCellConfigCommon_ ;
\- Need codes or conditions specified for subfields according to IEs defined
in clause 6 do not apply;
\- Based on the received AS configuration, the target node can indicate the
delta (difference) as compared to the current AS configuration to the UE. The
fields _newUE-Identity_ and _t304_ in _ReconfigurationWithSync_ are always
included by the target node, i.e. they are not used for delta configuration
purpose to UE.
For fields in _CG-Config_ and _CG-ConfigInfo_ listed below, absence of the
field means that the receiver maintains the values informed via the previous
message. Note that every time there is a change in the configuration covered
by a listed field, the MN or SN shall include the field and it shall provide
the full configuration provided by that field unless stated otherwise.
Otherwise, if there is no change, the field can be omitted:
\- _configRestrictInfo_ ;
\- _gapPurpose;_
\- _measGapConfig_ (for which delta signaling applies);
_\- measGapConfigFR2_ (for which delta signaling applies);
\- _measResultCellListSFTD_ ;

# 12 Processing delay requirements for RRC procedures
The UE performance requirements for RRC procedures are specified in the
following tables. The performance requirement is expressed as the time in [ms]
from the end of reception of the network -> UE message on the UE physical
layer up to when the UE shall be ready for the reception of uplink grant for
the UE -> network response message with no access delay other than the TTI-
alignment (e.g. excluding delays caused by scheduling, the random access
procedure or physical layer synchronisation). In case the RRC procedure
triggers BWP switching, the RRC procedure delay is the value defined in the
following table plus the BWP switching delay defined in TS 38.133 [14], clause
8.6.3.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Guidelines, mainly on use of ASN.1
# A.1 Introduction
The following clauses contain guidelines for the specification of RRC protocol
data units (PDUs) with ASN.1.
# A.2 Procedural specification
## A.2.1 General principles
The procedural specification provides an overall high level description
regarding the UE behaviour in a particular scenario.
It should be noted that most of the UE behaviour associated with the reception
of a particular field is covered by the applicable parts of the PDU
specification. The procedural specification may also include specific details
of the UE behaviour upon reception of a field, but typically this should be
done only for cases that are not easy to capture in the PDU clause e.g.
general actions, more complicated actions depending on the value of multiple
fields.
Likewise, the procedural specification need not specify the UE requirements
regarding the setting of fields within the messages that are sent to the
network i.e. this may also be covered by the PDU specification.
## A.2.2 More detailed aspects
The following more detailed conventions should be used:
\- Bullets:
\- Capitals should be used in the same manner as in other parts of the
procedural text i.e. in most cases no capital applies since the bullets are
part of the sentence starting with \'The UE shall:\'
\- All bullets, including the last one in a clause, should end with a semi-
colon i.e. an \';.
\- Conditions:
\- Whenever multiple conditions apply, a semi-colon should be used at the end
of each conditions with the exception of the last one, i.e. as in \'if cond1,
or cond2.
# A.3 PDU specification
## A.3.1 General principles
### A.3.1.1 ASN.1 clauses
The RRC PDU contents are formally and completely described using abstract
syntax notation (ASN.1), see X.680 [6], X.681 [7].
The complete ASN.1 code is divided into a number of ASN.1 clauses in the
specifications. In order to facilitate the extraction of the complete ASN.1
code from the specification, each ASN.1 clause begins with the following:
\- a first text paragraph consisting entirely of an _ASN.1 start tag_ , which
consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string
\"ASN1START\" (in all upper case letters);
\- a second text paragraph consisting entirely of a _block start tag_ is
included, which consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the
text string \"TAG-NAME-START\" (in all upper case letters), where the \"NAME\"
refers to the main name of the paragraph (in all upper-case letters).
Similarly, each ASN.1 clause ends with the following:
\- a first text paragraph consisting entirely of a _blockstop tag_ , which
consists of a double hyphen followed by a single space and the text string
\"TAG-NAME-STOP\" (in all upper-case letters), where the \"NAME\" refers to
the main name of the paragraph (in all upper-case letters);
\- a second text paragraph consisting entirely of an _ASN.1 stop tag_ , which
consists of a double hyphen followed by a singlespace and the text
\"ASN1STOP\" (in all upper case letters).
This results in the following tags:
\-- ASN1START
\-- TAG-NAME-START
\-- TAG-NAME-STOP
\-- ASN1STOP
The text paragraphs containing either of the start and stop tags should not
contain any ASN.1 code significant for the complete description of the RRC PDU
contents. The complete ASN.1 code may be extracted by copying all the text
paragraphs between an ASN.1 start tag and the following ASN.1 stop tag in the
order they appear, throughout the specification.
NOTE: A typical procedure for extraction of the complete ASN.1 code consists
of a first step where the entire RRC PDU contents description (ultimately the
entire specification) is saved into a plain text (ASCII) file format, followed
by a second step where the actual extraction takes place, based on the
occurrence of the ASN.1 start and stop tags.
### A.3.1.2 ASN.1 identifier naming conventions
The naming of identifiers (i.e., the ASN.1 field and type identifiers) should
be based on the following guidelines:
\- Message (PDU) identifiers should be ordinary mixed case without
hyphenation. These identifiers, _e.g._ , the
_RRCConnectionModificationCommand_ , should be used for reference in the
procedure text. Abbreviations should be avoided in these identifiers and
abbreviated forms of these identifiers should not be used.
\- Type identifiers other than PDU identifiers should be ordinary mixed case,
with hyphenation used to set off acronyms only where an adjacent letter is a
capital, _e.g._ , _EstablishmentCause, SelectedPLMN (not Selected-PLMN, since
the \"d\" in \"Selected\" is lowercase), InitialUE-Identity and MeasSFN-SFN-
TimeDifference_.
\- Field identifiers shall start with a lowercase letter and use mixed case
thereafter, _e.g._ , _establishmentCause_. If a field identifier begins with
an acronym (which would normally be in upper case), the entire acronym is
lowercase (_plmn-Identity_ , not _pLMN-Identity_). The acronym is set off with
a hyphen (_ue-Identity_ , not _ueIdentity), in order to facilitate a
consistent search pattern with corresponding type identifiers_.
\- Identifiers should convey the meaning of the identifier and should avoid
adding unnecessary postfixes (e.g. abstractions like \'Info\') for the name.
\- Identifiers that are likely to be keywords of some language, especially
widely used languages, such as C++ or Java, should be avoided to the extent
possible.
\- Identifiers, other than PDU identifiers, longer than 25 characters should
be avoided where possible. It is recommended to use abbreviations, which
should be done in a consistent manner i.e. use \'Meas\' instead of
\'Measurement\' for all occurrences. Examples of typical abbreviations are
given in table A.3.1.2.1-1 below.
\- _For future extension:_ When an extension is introduced a suffix is added
to the identifier of the concerned ASN.1 field and/or type. A suffix of the
form \"‑rX\" is used, with X indicating the release, for ASN.1 fields or types
introduced in a later release (i.e. a release later than the original/first
release of the protocol) as well as for ASN.1 fields or types for which a
revision is introduced in a later release replacing a previous version, _e.g._
, _Foo-r9_ for the Rel-9 version of the ASN.1 type _Foo_. A suffix of the form
\"‑rXb\" is used for the first revision of a field that it appears in the same
release (X) as the original version of the field, \"‑rXc\" for a second intra-
release revision and so on. A suffix of the form \"‑vXYZ\" is used for ASN.1
fields or types that only are an extension of a corresponding earlier field or
type (see clause A.4), e.g., _AnElement-v10b0_ for the extension of the ASN.1
type _AnElement_ introduced in version 10.11.0 of the specification. A number
_0...9, 10, 11, etc._ is used to represent the first part of the version
number, indicating the release of the protocol. Lower case letters _a, b, c,
etc._ are used to represent the second (and third) part of the version number
if they are greater than 9\. In the procedural specification, in field
descriptions as well as in headings suffices are not used, unless there is a
clear need to distinguish the extension from the original field.
\- More generally, in case there is a need to distinguish different variants
of an ASN.1 field or IE, a suffix should be added at the end of the
identifiers e.g. _MeasObjectUTRA_ , _ConfigCommon_. When there is no
particular need to distinguish the fields (e.g. because the field is included
in different IEs), a common field identifier name may be used. This may be
attractive e.g. in case the procedural specification is the same for the
different variants.
\- It should be avoided to use field identifiers with the same name within the
elements of a CHOICE, including using a CHOICE inside a SEQUENCE (to avoid
certain compiler errors).
Table A.3.1.2-1: Examples of typical abbreviations used in ASN.1 identifiers
Abbreviation Abbreviated word
* * *
Config Configuration DL Downlink Ext Extension Freq Frequency Id Identity Ind
Indication Meas Measurement MIB MasterInformationBlock Neigh Neighbour(ing)
Param(s) Parameter(s) Phys Physical PCI Physical Cell Id Proc Process Reconfig

Scheduling SIB SystemInformationBlock Sync Synchronisation Thr Threshold Tx
Transmission UL Uplink
NOTE: The table A.3.1.2.1-1 is not exhaustive. Additional abbreviations may be
used in ASN.1 identifiers when needed.
### A.3.1.3 Text references using ASN.1 identifiers
A text reference into the RRC PDU contents description from other parts of the
specification is made using the ASN.1 field identifier of the referenced type.
The ASN.1 field and type identifiers used in text references should be in the
_italic font style_. The \"do not check spelling and grammar\" attribute in
Word should be set. Quotation marks (i.e., \"\") should not be used around the
ASN.1 field or type identifier.
A reference to an RRC PDU should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field
identifier followed by the word \"message\", e.g., a reference to the
_RRCRelease_ message.
A reference to a specific part of an RRC PDU, or to a specific part of any
other ASN.1 type, should be made using the corresponding ASN.1 field
identifier followed by the word \"field\", e.g., a reference to the
_prioritisedBitRate_ field in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
LogicalChannelConfig ::= SEQUENCE {
ul-SpecificParameters SEQUENCE {
priority Priority,
prioritisedBitRate PrioritisedBitRate,
bucketSizeDuration BucketSizeDuration,
logicalChannelGroup INTEGER (0..3)
} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
NOTE: All the ASN.1 start tags in the ASN.1 clauses, used as examples in this
annex to the specification, are deliberately distorted, in order not to
include them when the ASN.1 description of the RRC PDU contents is extracted
from the specification.
A reference to a specific type of information element should be made using the
corresponding ASN.1 type identifier preceded by the acronym \"IE\", e.g., a
reference to the IE _LogicalChannelConfig_ in the example above.
References to a specific type of information element should only be used when
those are generic, i.e., without regard to the particular context wherein the
specific type of information element is used. If the reference is related to a
particular context, e.g., an RRC PDU type (message) wherein the information
element is used, the corresponding field identifier in that context should be
used in the text reference.
A reference to a specific value of an ASN.1 field should be made using the
corresponding ASN.1 value without using quotation marks around the ASN.1
value, e.g., \'if the _status_ field is set to value _true_ \'.
## A.3.2 High-level message structure
Within each logical channel type, the associated RRC PDU (message) types are
alternatives within a CHOICE, as shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
DL-DCCH-Message ::= SEQUENCE {
message DL-DCCH-MessageType
}
DL-DCCH-MessageType ::= CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE {
dlInformationTransfer DLInformationTransfer,
handoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest HandoverFromEUTRAPreparationRequest,
mobilityFromEUTRACommand MobilityFromEUTRACommand,
rrcConnectionReconfiguration RRCConnectionReconfiguration,
rrcConnectionRelease RRCConnectionRelease,
securityModeCommand SecurityModeCommand,
ueCapabilityEnquiry UECapabilityEnquiry,
spare1 NULL
},
messageClassExtension SEQUENCE {}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
A nested two-level CHOICE structure is used, where the alternative PDU types
are alternatives within the inner level _c1_ CHOICE.
Spare alternatives (i.e., _spare1_ in this case) may be included within the
_c1_ CHOICE to facilitate future extension. The number of such spare
alternatives should not extend the total number of alternatives beyond an
integer-power-of-two number of alternatives (i.e., eight in this case).
Further extension of the number of alternative PDU types is facilitated using
the _messageClassExtension_ alternative in the outer level CHOICE.
## A.3.3 Message definition
Each PDU (message) type is specified in an ASN.1 clause similar to the one
shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCConnectionReconfiguration ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE{
rrcConnectionReconfiguration-r8 RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs,
spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Enter the IEs here.
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Hooks for _critical_ and _non-critical_ extension should normally be included
in the PDU type specification. How these hooks are used is further described
in clause A.4.
Critical extensions are characterised by a redefinition of the PDU contents
and need to be governed by a mechanism for protocol version agreement between
the encoder and the decoder of the PDU, such that the encoder is prevented
from sending a critically extended version of the PDU type, which is not
comprehended by the decoder.
Critical extension of a PDU type is facilitated by a two-level CHOICE
structure, where the alternative PDU contents are alternatives within the
inner level _c1_ CHOICE. Spare alternatives (i.e., _spare3_ down to _spare1_
in this case) may be included within the _c1_ CHOICE. The number of spare
alternatives to be included in the original PDU specification should be
decided case by case, based on the expected rate of critical extension in the
future releases of the protocol.
Further critical extension, when the spare alternatives from the original
specifications are used up, is facilitated using the
_criticalExtensionsFuture_ in the outer level CHOICE.
In PDU types where critical extension is not expected in the future releases
of the protocol, the inner level _c1_ CHOICE and the spare alternatives may be
excluded, as shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
rrcConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs,
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
RRCConnectionReconfigurationComplete-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Enter the fields here.
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Non-critical extensions are characterised by the addition of new information
to the original specification of the PDU type. If not comprehended, a non-
critical extension may be skipped by the decoder, whilst the decoder is still
able to complete the decoding of the comprehended parts of the PDU contents.
Non-critical extensions at locations other than the end of the message or
other than at the end of a field contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING are
facilitated by use of the ASN.1 extension marker \"...\". The original
specification of a PDU type should normally include the extension marker at
the end of the sequence of information elements contained.
Non-critical extensions at the end of the message or at the end of a field
that is contained in a BIT or OCTET STRING may be facilitated by use of an
empty sequence that is marked OPTIONAL e.g. as shown in the following example:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 InformationElement1,
field2 InformationElement2,
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The ASN.1 clause specifying the contents of a PDU type may be followed by a
_field description_ table where a further description of, e.g., the semantic
properties of the fields may be included. The general format of this table is
shown in the example below. The field description table is absent in case
there are no fields for which further description needs to be provided e.g.
because the PDU does not include any fields, or because an IE is defined for
each field while there is nothing specific regarding the use of this IE that
needs to be specified.
+-------------------------------------------+ | _%PDU-TypeIdentifier%_ field descriptions | +===========================================+ | **_%field identifier%_** | | | | Field description. | +-------------------------------------------+ | **_%field identifier%_** | | | | Field description. | +-------------------------------------------+
The field description table has one column. The header row shall contain the
ASN.1 type identifier of the PDU type.
The following rows are used to provide field descriptions. Each row shall
include a first paragraph with a _field identifier_ (in **_bold and italic_**
font style) referring to the part of the PDU to which it applies. The
following paragraphs at the same row may include (in regular font style),
e.g., semantic description, references to other specifications and/or
specification of value units, which are relevant for the particular part of
the PDU.
The parts of the PDU contents that do not require a field description shall be
omitted from the field description table.
## A.3.4 Information elements
Each IE (information element) type is specified in an ASN.1 clause similar to
the one shown in the example below.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PRACH-ConfigSIB ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo
}
PRACH-Config ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo OPTIONAL -- Need N
}
PRACH-ConfigInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
prach-ConfigIndex ENUMERATED {ffs},
highSpeedFlag ENUMERATED {ffs},
zeroCorrelationZoneConfig ENUMERATED {ffs}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
IEs should be introduced whenever there are multiple fields for which the same
set of values apply. IEs may also be defined for other reasons e.g. to break
down a ASN.1 definition in to smaller pieces.
A group of closely related IE type definitions, like the IEs _PRACH-ConfigSIB_
and _PRACH-Config_ in this example, are preferably placed together in a common
ASN.1 clause. The IE type identifiers should in this case have a common base,
defined as the _generic type identifier_. It may be complemented by a suffix
to distinguish the different variants. The \"_PRACH-Config_ \" is the generic
type identifier in this example, and the \"_SIB_ \" suffix is added to
distinguish the variant. The clause heading and generic references to a group
of closely related IEs defined in this way should use the generic type
identifier.
The same principle should apply if a new version, or an extension version, of
an existing IE is created for _critical_ or _non-critical_ extension of the
protocol (see clause A.4). The new version, or the extension version, of the
IE is included in the same ASN.1 clause defining the original. A suffix is
added to the type identifier, using the naming conventions defined in clause
A.3.1.2, indicating the release or version of the where the new version, or
extension version, was introduced.
Local IE type definitions, like the IE _PRACH-ConfigInfo_ in the example
above, may be included in the ASN.1 clause and be referenced in the other IE
types defined in the same ASN.1 clause. The use of locally defined IE types
should be encouraged, as a tool to break up large and complex IE type
definitions. It can improve the readability of the code. There may also be a
benefit for the software implementation of the protocol end-points, as these
IE types are typically provided by the ASN.1 compiler as independent data
elements, to be used in the software implementation.
An IE type defined in a local context, like the IE _PRACH-ConfigInfo_ , should
not be referenced directly from other ASN.1 clauses in the RRC specification.
An IE type which is referenced in more than one ASN.1 clause should be defined
in a separate clause, with a separate heading and a separate ASN.1 clause
(possibly as one in a set of closely related IE types, like the IEs _PRACH-
ConfigSIB_ and _PRACH-Config_ in the example above). Such IE types are also
referred to as \'global IEs\'.
NOTE: Referring to an IE type, that is defined as a local IE type in the
context of another ASN.1 clause, does not generate an ASN.1 compilation error.
Nevertheless, using a locally defined IE type in that way makes the IE type
definition difficult to find, as it would not be visible at an outline level
of the specification. It should be avoided.
The ASN.1 clause specifying the contents of one or more IE types, like in the
example above, may be followed by a _field description_ table, where a further
description of, e.g., the semantic properties of the fields of the information
elements may be included. This table may be absent, similar as indicated in
clause A.3.3 for the specification of the PDU type. The general format of the
_field description_ table is the same as shown in clause A.3.3 for the
specification of the PDU type.
## A.3.5 Fields with optional presence
A field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword DEFAULT. It
identifies a default value to be assumed, if the sender does not include a
value for that field in the encoding:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PreambleInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
numberOfRA-Preambles INTEGER (1..64) DEFAULT 1,
...
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Alternatively, a field with optional presence may be declared with the keyword
OPTIONAL. It identifies a field for which a value can be omitted. The omission
carries semantics, which is different from any normal value of the field:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PRACH-Config ::= SEQUENCE {
rootSequenceIndex INTEGER (0..1023),
prach-ConfigInfo PRACH-ConfigInfo OPTIONAL -- Need N
}
\-- ASN1STOP
The semantics of an optionally present field, in the case it is omitted,
should be indicated at the end of the paragraph including the keyword
OPTIONAL, using a short comment text with a need code. The need code includes
the keyword \"Need\", followed by one of the predefined semantics tags (S, M,
N or R) defined in clause 6.1. If the semantics tag S is used, the semantics
of the absent field are further specified either in the field description
table following the ASN.1 clause, or in procedure text.
The addition of OPTIONAL keywords for capability groups is based on the
following guideline. If there is more than one field in the lower level IE,
then OPTIONAL keyword is added at the group level. If there is only one field
in the lower level IE, OPTIONAL keyword is not added at the group level.
## A.3.6 Fields with conditional presence
A field with conditional presence is declared with the keyword OPTIONAL. In
addition, a short comment text shall be included at the end of the paragraph
including the keyword OPTIONAL. The comment text includes the keyword
\"Cond\", followed by a condition tag associated with the field (\"UL\" in
this example):
\-- /example/ ASN1START
LogicalChannelConfig ::= SEQUENCE {
ul-SpecificParameters SEQUENCE {
priority INTEGER (0),
...
} OPTIONAL -- Cond UL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
When conditionally present fields are included in an ASN.1 clause, the field
description table after the ASN.1 clause shall be followed by a _conditional
presence_ table. The conditional presence table specifies the conditions for
including the fields with conditional presence in the particular ASN.1 clause.
Conditional presence Explanation
* * *
UL Specification of the conditions for including the field associated with the
condition tag = \"UL\". Semantics in case of optional presence under certain
conditions may also be specified.
The conditional presence table has two columns. The first column (heading:
\"Conditional presence\") contains the condition tag (in _italic_ font style),
which links the fields with a condition tag in the ASN.1 clause to an entry in
the table. The second column (heading: \"Explanation\") contains a text
specification of the conditions and requirements for the presence of the
field. The second column may also include semantics, in case of an optional
presence of the field, under certain conditions i.e. using the same predefined
tags as defined for optional fields in A.3.5.
Conditional presence should primarily be used when presence of a field depends
on the presence and/or value of other fields within the same message. If the
presence of a field depends on whether another feature/function has been
configured, while this function can be configured independently e.g. by
another message and/or at another point in time, the relation is best
reflected by means of a statement in the field description table.
If the ASN.1 clause does not include any fields with conditional presence, the
conditional presence table shall not be included.
Whenever a field is only applicable in specific cases e.g. TDD, use of
conditional presence should be considered.
## A.3.7 Guidelines on use of lists with elements of SEQUENCE type
Where an information element has the form of a list (the SEQUENCE OF construct
in ASN.1) with the type of the list elements being a SEQUENCE data type, an
information element shall be defined for the list elements even if it would
not otherwise be needed.
For example, a list of PLMN identities with reservation flags is defined as in
the following example:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
PLMN-IdentityInfoList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF PLMN-IdentityInfo
PLMN-IdentityInfo ::= SEQUENCE {
plmn-Identity PLMN-Identity,
cellReservedForOperatorUse ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
rather than as in the following (bad) example, which may cause generated code
to contain types with unpredictable names:
\-- /bad example/ ASN1START
PLMN-IdentityList ::= SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..6)) OF SEQUENCE {
plmn-Identity PLMN-Identity,
cellReservedForOperatorUse ENUMERATED {reserved, notReserved}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
## A.3.8 Guidelines on use of parameterised SetupRelease type
The usage of the parameterised _SetupRelease_ type is like a function call in
programming languages where the element type parameter is passed as a
parameter. The parameterised type only implies a textual change in abstract
syntax where all references to the parameterised type are replaced by the
compiler with the release/setup choice. Two examples of the usage are shown
below:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field-rX SetupRelease { IE-rX } OPTIONAL, -- Need M
...
}
RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field-rX SetupRelease { Element-rX }
} OPTIONAL, -- Need M
Element-rX ::= SEQUENCE {
field1-rX IE1-rX,
field2-rX IE2-rX OPTIONAL -- Need N
} OPTIONAL, -- Need M
\-- /example/ ASN1STOP
The _SetupRelease_ is always be used with only named IEs, i.e. the example
below is not allowed:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-rX-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field-rX SetupRelease { SEQUENCE { -- Unnamed SEQUENCEs are not allowed!
field1-rX IE1-rX,
field2-rX IE2-rX OPTIONAL -- Need N
}
} OPTIONAL, -- Need M
}
\-- /example/ ASN1STOP
If a field defined using the parameterized SetupRelease type requires
procedural text, the field is referred to using the values defined for the
type itself, namely, \"setup\" and \"release\". For example, procedural text
for field-rX above could be as follows:
1> if _field-rX_ is set to \"setup\":
2> do something;
1> else (_field-rX_ is set to \"release\"):
2> release _field-rX_ (if appropriate).
## A.3.9 Guidelines on use of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList
In order to benefit from delta signalling when modifying lists with many
and/or large elements, so-called add/mod- and release- lists should be used.
Instead of a single list containing all elements of the list, the ASN.1
provides two lists. One list is used to convey the actual elements that are to
be added to the list or modified in the list. The second list conveys only the
identities (IDs) of the list elements that are to be released from the list.
In other words, the ASN.1 defines only means to signal modifications to a list
maintained in the receiver (typically the UE). An example is provided below:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
AnExampleIE ::= SEQUENCE {
elementsToAddModList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF Element OPTIONAL,
-- Need N
elementsToReleaseList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF ElementId
OPTIONAL, -- Need N
...
}
Element ::= SEQUENCE {
elementId ElementId,
aField INTEG ER (0..16777215),
anotherField OCTET STRING,
...
}
ElementId ::= INTEGER (0..maxNrofElements-1)
maxNrofElements INTEGER ::= 50
maxNrofElements-1 INTEGER ::= 49
\-- /example/ ASN1STOP
As can be seen, the elements of the list must contain an identity (INTEGER)
that identifies the elements unambiguously upon addition, modification and
removal. It is recommended to define an IE for that identifier (here
ElementId) so that it can be used both for a field inside the element as well
as in the _elementsToReleaseList_.
Both lists should be made OPTIONAL and flagged as \"Need N\". The need code
reflects that the UE does not maintain the received lists as such but rather
updates its configuration using the information therein. In other words, it is
not possible to provide via delta signalling an update to a previously
signalled _elementsToAddModList_ or elementsToReleaseList (which Need M would
imply). The update is always in relation to the UE\'s internal configuration.
Note that the release of a field (a list element as well as any other field)
releases all its sub-fields (sub-fields configured by elementsToAddModList and
any other sub-field).
If no procedural text is provided for a set of ToAddModList and ToReleaseList,
the following generic procedure applies:
The UE shall:
1> for each _ElementId_ in the _elementsToReleaseList_ ,:
2> if the current UE configuration includes an _Element_ with the given
_ElementId_ :
3> release the _Element_ from the current UE configuration;
1> for each _Element_ in the _elementsToAddModList_ :
2> if the current UE configuration includes an _Element_ with the given
_ElementId_ :
3> modify the configured _Element_ in accordance with the received _Element_ ;
2> else:
3> add received _Element_ to the UE configuration.
## A.3.10 Guidelines on use of lists (without ToAddModList and ToReleaseList)
As per clause 6.1.3, when using lists without the ToAddModList and
ToReleaseList structure, the contents of the lists are always replaced. To
illustrate this, an example is provided below:
\-- /example/ ASN1START
\-- TAG_EXAMPLE_LISTS_START
AnExampleIE ::= SEQUENCE {
elementList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElements)) OF Element OPTIONAL, \-- Need
M
...,
[[
elementListExt-v2030 SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofElementsExt)) OF Element
OPTIONAL, -- Need M
]]
}
Element ::= SEQUENCE {
useFeatureX BOOLEAN,
aField INTEGER (0..127) OPTIONAL, -- Need M
anotherField INTEGER (0..127) OPTIONAL, -- Need R
...
}
maxNrofElements INTEGER ::= 8
maxNrofElements-1 INTEGER ::= 7
maxNrofElementsExt INTEGER ::= 8
maxNrofElementsExt-1 INTEGER ::= 7
\-- TAG_EXAMPLE_LISTS_STOP
\-- /example/ ASN1STOP
As can be seen, the _elementList_ list itself uses Need M, but each list entry
_Element_ contains mandatory, Need M and Need R fields. If the list is first
signalled to UE with 3 entries, and subsequently again with 2 entries, UE
shall retain only the latter list, i.e. the list with 2 elements will
completely replace the list with 3 elements. That also means that the field
_aField_ will be treated as if it was newly created, i.e. network must include
it if it wishes UE to utilize the field even if it was previously signalled.
This also implies that the Need M field (_aField_) will be treated in the same
way as the Need R field (_anotherField_), i.e. delta signalling is not applied
and the network has to signal the field to ensure UE does not release the
value (which is why Need M should not normally be used in the entries of these
lists).
# A.4 Extension of the PDU specifications
## A.4.1 General principles to ensure compatibility
It is essential that extension of the protocol does not affect
interoperability i.e. it is essential that implementations based on different
versions of the RRC protocol are able to interoperate. In particular, this
requirement applies for the following kind of protocol extensions:
\- Introduction of new PDU types (i.e. these should not cause unexpected
behaviour or damage).
\- Introduction of additional fields in an extensible PDUs (i.e. it should be
possible to ignore uncomprehended extensions without affecting the handling of
the other parts of the message).
\- Introduction of additional values of an extensible field of PDUs. If used,
the behaviour upon reception of an uncomprehended value should be defined.
It should be noted that the PDU extension mechanism may depend on the logical
channel used to transfer the message e.g. for some PDUs an implementation may
be aware of the protocol version of the peer in which case selective ignoring
of extensions may not be required.
The non-critical extension mechanism is the primary mechanism for introducing
protocol extensions i.e. the critical extension mechanism is used merely when
there is a need to introduce a \'clean\' message version. Such a need appears
when the last message version includes a large number of non-critical
extensions, which results in issues like readability, overhead associated with
the extension markers. The critical extension mechanism may also be considered
when it is complicated to accommodate the extensions by means of non-critical
extension mechanisms.
## A.4.2 Critical extension of messages and fields
The mechanisms to critically extend a message are defined in A.3.3. There are
both \"outer branch\" and \"inner branch\" mechanisms available. The \"outer
branch\" consists of a CHOICE having the name _criticalExtensions_ , with two
values, _c1_ and _criticalExtensionsFuture_. The _criticalExtensionsFuture_
branch consists of an empty SEQUENCE, while the c1 branch contains the \"inner
branch\" mechanism.
The \"inner branch\" structure is a CHOICE with values of the form
\"_MessageName-rX-IEs_ \" (e.g., \"_RRCConnectionReconfiguration-r8-IEs_ \")
or \"_spareX_ \", with the spare values having type NULL. The \"-rX-IEs\"
structures contain the _complete_ structure of the message IEs for the
appropriate release; i.e., the critical extension branch for the Rel-10
version of a message includes all Rel-8 and Rel-9 fields (that are not
obviated in the later version), rather than containing only the additional
Rel-10 fields.
The following guidelines may be used when deciding which mechanism to
introduce for a particular message, i.e. only an \'outer branch\', or an
\'outer branch\' in combination with an \'inner branch\' including a certain
number of spares:
\- For certain messages, e.g. initial uplink messages, messages transmitted on
a broadcast channel, critical extension may not be applicable.
\- An outer branch may be sufficient for messages not including any fields.
\- The number of spares within inner branch should reflect the likelihood that
the message will be critically extended in future releases (since each release
with a critical extension for the message consumes one of the spare values).
The estimation of the critical extension likelihood may be based on the
number, size and changeability of the fields included in the message.
\- In messages where an inner branch extension mechanism is available, all
spare values of the inner branch should be used before any critical extensions
are added using the outer branch.
The following example illustrates the use of the critical extension mechanism
by showing the ASN.1 of the original and of a later release
\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Original release
RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE{
rrcMessage-r8 RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Later release
RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE{
rrcMessage-r8 RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
rrcMessage-r10 RRCMessage-r10-IEs,
rrcMessage-r11 RRCMessage-r11-IEs,
rrcMessage-r14 RRCMessage-r14-IEs
},
later CHOICE {
c2 CHOICE{
rrcMessage-r16 RRCMessage-r16-IEs,
spare7 NULL, spare6 NULL, spare5 NULL, spare4 NULL,
spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
}
\-- ASN1STOP
It is important to note that critical extensions may also be used at the level
of individual fields i.e. a field may be replaced by a critically extended
version. When sending the extended version, the original version may also be
included (e.g. original field is mandatory, E-UTRAN is unaware if UE supports
the extended version). In such cases, a UE supporting both versions may be
required to ignore the original field. The following example illustrates the
use of the critical extension mechanism by showing the ASN.1 of the original
and of a later release.
\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Original release
RRCMessage ::= SEQUENCE {
rrc-TransactionIdentifier RRC-TransactionIdentifier,
criticalExtensions CHOICE {
c1 CHOICE{
rrcMessage-r8 RRCMessage-r8-IEs,
spare3 NULL, spare2 NULL, spare1 NULL
},
criticalExtensionsFuture SEQUENCE {}
}
}
RRCMessage-rN-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1-rN ENUMERATED {
value1, value2, value3, value4} OPTIONAL, -- Need N
field2-rN InformationElement2-rN OPTIONAL, -- Need N
nonCriticalExtension RRCConnectionReconfiguration-vMxy-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCConnectionReconfiguration-vMxy-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field2-rM InformationElement2-rM OPTIONAL, -- Cond NoField2rN
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Conditional presence Explanation
* * *
_NoField2rN_ The field is optionally present, need N, if field2-rN is absent.
Otherwise the field is absent
Finally, it is noted that a critical extension may be introduced in the same
release as the one in which the original field was introduced e.g. to correct
an essential ASN.1 error. In such cases a UE capability may be introduced, to
assist the network in deciding whether or not to use the critical extension.
In the case of list fields (SEQUENCE OF types in ASN.1) using the
ToAddMod/ToRelease construction, the use of critical extensions to increase
the size of a list should be avoided; that is, replacing the original list
field by a new field also used to signal entries previously covered by the
original field (i.e. extensions done according to the following example)
should be avoided:
\-- /example/ ASN1START -- Discouraged example
ContainingStructure ::= SEQUENCE {
listElementToAddModList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElement OPTIONAL, -- Need N
...,
[[
listElementToAddModList-rN SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements-rN)) OF
ListElement OPTIONAL -- Need N
]]
}-- ASN1STOP
Instead, a non-critical list extension mechanism should typically be used,
such that the extension field only adds the new entries of the list. This
approach is further described in clause A.4.3.6.
If the critical extension mechanism for a list is used, it should be clarified
in the field description that the two versions of the list are not configured
together, and that the network should release the contents of the original
version when configuring the replacement version.
## A.4.3 Non-critical extension of messages
### A.4.3.1 General principles
The mechanisms to extend a message in a non-critical manner are defined in
A.3.3. W.r.t. the use of extension markers, the following additional
guidelines apply:
\- When further non-critical extensions are added to a message that has been
critically extended, the inclusion of these non-critical extensions in earlier
critical branches of the message should be avoided when possible.
\- The extension marker (\"...\") is the primary non-critical extension
mechanism that is used but empty sequences may be used if length determinant
is not required. Examples of cases where a length determinant is not required:
\- at the end of a message;
\- at the end of a structure contained in a BIT STRING or OCTET STRING.
\- When an extension marker is available, non-critical extensions are
preferably placed at the location (e.g. the IE) where the concerned parameter
belongs from a logical/ functional perspective (referred to as the \'_default
extension location_ \').
\- It is desirable to aggregate extensions of the same release or version of
the specification into a group, which should be placed at the lowest possible
level.
\- In specific cases it may be preferable to place extensions elsewhere
(referred to as the \'_actual extension location_ \') e.g. when it is possible
to aggregate several extensions in a group. In such a case, the group should
be placed at the lowest suitable level in the message.
\- In case placement at the default extension location affects earlier
critical branches of the message, locating the extension at a following higher
level in the message should be considered.
\- In case an extension is not placed at the default extension location, an IE
should be defined. The IE\'s ASN.1 definition should be placed in the same
ASN.1 clause as the default extension location. In case there are intermediate
levels in-between the actual and the default extension location, an IE may be
defined for each level. Intermediate levels are primarily introduced for
readability and overview. Hence intermediate levels need not always be
introduced e.g. they may not be needed when the default and the actual
extension location are within the same ASN.1 clause.
### A.4.3.2 Further guidelines
Further to the general principles defined in the previous clause, the
following additional guidelines apply regarding the use of extension markers:
\- Extension markers within SEQUENCE:
\- Extension markers are primarily, but not exclusively, introduced at the
higher nesting levels.
\- Extension markers are introduced for a SEQUENCE comprising several fields
as well as for information elements whose extension would result in complex
structures without it (e.g. re-introducing another list).
\- Extension markers are introduced to make it possible to maintain important
information structures e.g. parameters relevant for one particular RAT.
\- Extension markers are also used for size critical messages (i.e. messages
on BCCH, BR-BCCH, PCCH and CCCH), although introduced somewhat more carefully.
\- The extension fields introduced (or frozen) in a specific version of the
specification are grouped together using double brackets.
\- Extension markers within ENUMERATED:
\- Spare values may be used until the number of values reaches the next power
of 2, while the extension marker caters for extension beyond that limit, given
that the use of spare values in a later Release is possible without any error
cases.
\- A suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new value,
e.g. \"value-vXYZ\".
\- Extension markers within CHOICE:
\- Extension markers are introduced when extension is foreseen and when
comprehension is not required by the receiver i.e. behaviour is defined for
the case where the receiver cannot comprehend the extended value (e.g.
ignoring an optional CHOICE field). It should be noted that defining the
behaviour of a receiver upon receiving a not comprehended choice value is not
required if the sender is aware whether or not the receiver supports the
extended value.
\- A suffix of the form \"vXYZ\" is used for the identifier of each new choice
value, e.g. \"choice-vXYZ\".
Non-critical extensions at the end of a message/ of a field contained in an
OCTET or BIT STRING:
\- When a nonCriticalExtension is actually used, a \"Need\" code should not be
provided for the field, which always is a group including at least one
extension and a field facilitating further possible extensions. For
simplicity, it is recommended not to provide a \"Need\" code when the field is
not actually used either.
Further, more general, guidelines:
\- In case a need code is not provided for a group, a \"Need\" code is
provided for all individual extension fields within the group i.e. including
for fields that are not marked as OPTIONAL. The latter is to clarify the
action upon absence of the whole group.
### A.4.3.3 Typical example of evolution of IE with local extensions
The following example illustrates the use of the extension marker for a number
of elementary cases (sequence, enumerated, choice). The example also
illustrates how the IE may be revised in case the critical extension mechanism
is used.
NOTE In case there is a need to support further extensions of release n while
the ASN.1 of release (n+1) has been frozen, without requiring the release n
receiver to support decoding of release (n+1) extensions, more advanced
mechanisms are needed e.g. including multiple extension markers.

field3-v1170 InformationElement3-v1170 OPTIONAL -- Need R

}
\-- ASN1STOP
Some remarks regarding the extensions of _InformationElement1_ as shown in the
above example:
\-- The _InformationElement1_ is initially extended with a number of non-
critical extensions. In release 10 however, a critical extension is introduced
for the message using this IE. Consequently, a new version of the IE
_InformationElement1_ (i.e. _InformationElement1-r10_) is defined in which the
earlier non-critical extensions are incorporated by means of a revision of the
original field.
\-- The _value4-v880_ is replacing a spare value defined in the original
protocol version for _field1_. Likewise _value6-v1170_ replaces _spare3_ that
was originally defined in the r10 version of _field1._
\-- Within the critically extended release 10 version of _InformationElement1_
, the names of the original fields/IEs are not changed, unless there is a real
need to distinguish them from other fields/IEs. E.g. the _field1_ and
_InformationElement4_ were defined in the original protocol version (release
8) and hence not tagged. Moreover, the _field3-r9_ is introduced in release 9
and not re-tagged; although, the _InformationElement3_ is also critically
extended and therefore tagged _InformationElement3-r10_ in the release 10
version of InformationElement1.
### A.4.3.4 Typical examples of non critical extension at the end of a message
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions at the
end of the message or at the end of a field that is contained in a BIT or
OCTET STRING i.e. when an empty sequence is used.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-r8-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field1 InformationElement1,
field2 InformationElement2,
field3 InformationElement3 OPTIONAL, -- Need N
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v860-IEs OPTIONAL

RRCMessage-v860-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field4-v860 InformationElement4 OPTIONAL, -- Need S
field5-v860 BOOLEAN OPTIONAL, -- Cond C54
nonCriticalExtension RRCMessage-v940-IEs OPTIONAL
}
RRCMessage-v940-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
field6-v940 InformationElement6-r9 OPTIONAL, -- Need R
nonCriticalExtensions SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
\-- The _InformationElement4_ is introduced in the original version of the
protocol (release 8) and hence no suffix is used.
### A.4.3.5 Examples of non-critical extensions not placed at the default
extension location
The following example illustrates the use of non-critical extensions in case
an extension is not placed at the default extension location.
#### \-- _ParentIE-WithEM_
The IE _ParentIE-WithEM_ is an example of a high level IE including the
extension marker (EM). The root encoding of this IE includes two lower level
IEs _ChildIE1-WithoutEM_ and _ChildIE2-WithoutEM_ which not include the
extension marker. Consequently, non-critical extensions of the Child-IEs have
to be included at the level of the Parent-IE.
The example illustrates how the two extension IEs _ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0_
and _ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0_ (both in release N) are used to connect non-
critical extensions with a default extension location in the lower level IEs
to the actual extension location in this IE.
**_ParentIE-WithEM_** information element
\-- /example/ ASN1START
ParentIE-WithEM ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Root encoding, including:
childIE1-WithoutEM ChildIE1-WithoutEM OPTIONAL, -- Need N
childIE2-WithoutEM ChildIE2-WithoutEM OPTIONAL, -- Need N
...,
[[
childIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 ChildIE1-WithoutEM-vNx0 OPTIONAL, -- Need N
childIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 ChildIE2-WithoutEM-vNx0 OPTIONAL -- Need N
]]
}
\-- ASN1STOP
Some remarks regarding the extensions shown in the above example:
\-- The fields _childIEx-WithoutEM-vNx0_ may not really need to be optional
(depends on what is defined at the next lower level).
\-- In general, especially when there are several nesting levels, fields
should be marked as optional only when there is a clear reason.
#### _\-- ChildIE1-WithoutEM_
The IE _ChildIE1-WithoutEM_ is an example of a lower level IE, used to control
certain radio configurations including a configurable feature which can be
setup or released using the local IE _ChIE1-ConfigurableFeature_. The example
illustrates how the new field _chIE1-NewField_ is added in release N to the
configuration of the configurable feature. The example is based on the
following assumptions:
\-- When initially configuring as well as when modifying the new field, the
original fields of the configurable feature have to be provided also i.e. as
if the extended ones were present within the setup branch of this feature.
\-- When the configurable feature is released, the new field should be
released also.
\-- When omitting the original fields of the configurable feature the UE
continues using the existing values (which is used to optimise the signalling
for features that typically continue unchanged upon handover).
\-- When omitting the new field of the configurable feature the UE releases
the existing values and discontinues the associated functionality (which may
be used to support release of unsupported functionality upon handover to an
eNB supporting an earlier protocol version).
The above assumptions, which affect the use of conditions and need codes, may
not always apply. Hence, the example should not be re-used blindly.

#### _\-- ChildIE2-WithoutEM_
The IE _ChildIE2-WithoutEM_ is an example of a lower level IE, typically used
to control certain radio configurations. The example illustrates how the new
field _chIE1-NewField_ is added in release N to the configuration of the
configurable feature.
**_ChildIE2-WithoutEM_** information element
\-- /example/ ASN1START

A.4.3.6 Non-critical extensions of lists with ToAddMod/ToRelease
When the size of a list using the ToAddMod/ToRelease construction is extended
and/or fields are added to the list element structure, the list should be non-
critically extended in accordance with the following general principles:
\-- When only the size of the list is extended, this extension is reflected in
a non-critical extension of the list, with a \"SizeExt\" suffix added to the
end of the field name (before the -vNxy suffix). The differential size of the
extended list uses the suffix \"Diff\". A new ToRelease list is needed, and
its range should include only the increase in list size. In many cases,
extending the list size will also require an extended list element ID type to
account for the increased size of the list; in these cases the element type
will need to be extended to include the extended element ID, resulting in a
more complex extension (see example 3 for further discussion of this case).
The field description table should indicate that the UE considers the original
list and the extension list as a single list; thus entries added with the
original list can be modified by the extension list (or removed by the
extension of the ToRelease list), or vice versa. The result is as shown in the
following example:
\-- /example 1/ ASN1START
ContainingStructure ::= SEQUENCE {
listElementToAddModList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElement OPTIONAL, -- Need N
listElementToReleaseList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElementId OPTIONAL, -- Need N
...,
[[
\-- Non-critical extension lists
listElementToAddModListSizeExt-vNxy SEQUENCE (SIZE
(1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElement OPTIONAL, -- Need N
listElementToReleaseListSizeExt-vNxy SEQUENCE (SIZE
(1..maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN)) OF ListElementId OPTIONAL -- Need N
]]
}
\-- ASN1STOP
\-- When fields are added to the list element structure, an extension marker
should normally be used if available. If no extension marker is available or
if overhead or other considerations prevent using the extension marker, an
extension structure should be created for the new fields, with the suffix
\"Ext\" added to the end of the field name and the element structure type name
(before the -vNxy suffix), and a parallel ToAddMod list introduced to hold the
new structures, also with the \"Ext\" suffix. The field description table
should indicate that the parallel list contains the same number of entries,
and in the same order, as the original list. No new ToRelease list is
typically needed (unless the list element ID type changes). It should
typically be ensured that the contained fields in the \"Ext\" elements are
releasable without release and add of the entire list element; this can, for
instance, be ensured by having the new fields be OPTIONAL Need R. If multiple
extensions of the same list are needed, the version suffix should distinguish
the lists (e.g. _listElementToAddModListExt-vNwz_ added after
_listElementToAddModListExt-vNxy_). The result is as shown in the following
example:
\-- /example 2/ ASN1START
ContainingStructure ::= SEQUENCE {
listElementToAddModList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElement OPTIONAL, -- Need N
listElementToReleaseList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElementId OPTIONAL, -- Need N
...,
[[
\-- Parallel list
listElementToAddModListExt-vNxy SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElementExt-vNxy OPTIONAL -- Need N
]],
[[
\-- Second parallel list from a later spec version
listElementToAddModListExt-vNwz SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElementExt-vNwz OPTIONAL -- Need N
]]
}
ListElement ::= SEQUENCE {
elementId ListElementId,
field1 INTEGER (0..3),
field2 ENUMERATED { value1, value2, value3 }
}
ListElementExt-vNxy ::= SEQUENCE {
field3-rN BIT STRING (SIZE (8)) OPTIONAL -- Need R
}
ListElementExt-vNwz ::= SEQUENCE {
field4-rN INTEGER (0..255) OPTIONAL -- Need R
}
\-- ASN1STOP
\-- When the size of a list is extended and fields are added to the list
element structure, an extension marker should normally be used for the added
fields if available, and the list extended with the non-critical mechanism as
described in example 1 above _._ Note that if the list element ID type changes
in this case, the new ID can be added after the extension marker, and the
entries of the size-extended ToRelease list should have the type of the new ID
(e.g. _ListElementId-vNxy_). If no extension marker is available or if
overhead or other considerations prevent using the extension marker, an
extension structure should be created for the new fields and a parallel list
with ToAddMod introduced to hold the extension structures, as in the second
example above, for entries of the original list and for entries of the
extension list holding new entries. The field description table should
indicate that the parallel list contains the same number of entries, and in
the same order, as the concatenation of the original list and the extension
list. An extended ToRelease list is needed, but no additional parallel
ToRelease list is needed (i.e. there is no _listElementToReleaseListExt-vNxy_
in the example below), as the original and extended ToRelease lists suffice to
release any element of the combined list. The extended element ID type should
be captured as a non-critical extension of the original element ID type, with
the field description indicating that if the extended ID is present, the
original ID is ignored. The result is as shown in the following example:
\-- /example 3/ ASN1START
ContainingStructure ::= SEQUENCE {
listElementToAddModList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF
ListElement OPTIONAL, -- Need N
listElementToReleaseList SEQUENCE (SIZE (1..maxNrofListElements)) OF

\-- Parallel list with maxNrofListElements-rN = maxNrofListElements +
maxNrofListElementsDiff-rN

}
ListElement ::= SEQUENCE {
elementId ListElementId,
field1 INTEGER (0..3),
field2 ENUMERATED { value1, value2, value3 }

ListElementExt-vNxy ::= SEQUENCE {
\-- Field description should indicate that if the elementId-vNxy is present,
the elementId (without suffix) is ignored
elementId-vNxy ListElementId-vNxy OPTIONAL, -- Need S
field3-rN BIT STRING (SIZE (8)) OPTIONAL -- Need R
}
ListElementId ::= INTEGER (0..maxNrofListElements-1)
ListElementId-vNxy ::= INTEGER (maxNrofListElements..maxNrofListElements-1-rN)
\-- ASN1STOP
\-- When different extensions are made to a list in separate releases, the
extension mechanisms described above may interact. In case fields are added in
Rel-M (_listElementToAddModListExt-vMxy_) and later the list size is extended
in Rel-N (_listElementToAddModListSizeExt-vNwz_), the size-extended list in
Rel-N should be a single list extending the combination of
_listElementToAddModList_ and _listElementToAddModListExt-vMxy_. This requires
creating a new type (_ListElement-rN_) to contain the combined fields of
_ListElement_ and _ListElementExt-vMxy_. A corresponding ToRelease list is
needed. The result is as shown in the following example:
\-- /example 4/ ASN1START
ContainingStructure ::= SEQUENCE {

# A.5 Guidelines regarding inclusion of transaction identifiers in RRC
messages
The following rules provide guidance on which messages should include a
Transaction identifier
1: DL messages on CCCH that move UE to RRC-Idle should not include the RRC
transaction identifier.
2: All network initiated DL messages by default should include the RRC
transaction identifier.
3: All UL messages that are direct response to a DL message with an RRC
Transaction identifier should include the RRC Transaction identifier.
4: All UL messages that require a direct DL response message should include an
RRC transaction identifier.
5: All UL messages that are not in response to a DL message nor require a
corresponding response from the network should not include the RRC Transaction
identifier.
# A.6 Guidelines regarding use of need codes
The following rule provides guidance for determining need codes for optional
downlink fields:
\- if the field needs to be stored by the UE (i.e. maintained) when absent:
\- use Need M (=Maintain);
\- else, if the field needs to be released by the UE when absent:
\- use Need R (=Release);
\- else, if UE shall take no action when the field is absent (i.e. UE does not
even need to maintain any existing value of the field):
\- use Need N (=None);
\- else (UE behaviour upon absence does not fit any of the above conditions):
\- use Need S (=Specified);
\- specify the UE behaviour upon absence of the field in the procedural text
or in the field description table.
# A.7 Guidelines regarding use of conditions
Conditions are primarily used to specify network restrictions, for which the
following types can be distinguished:
\- Message Contents related constraints e.g. that a field B is mandatory
present if the same message includes field A and when it is set value X.
\- Configuration Constraints e.g. that a field D can only be signalled if
field C is configured and set to value Y. (i.e. regardless of whether field C
is present in the same message or previously configured).
The use of these conditions is illustrated by an example.
\-- /example/ ASN1START
RRCMessage-IEs ::= SEQUENCE {
fieldA FieldA OPTIONAL, -- Need M
fieldB FieldB OPTIONAL, -- Cond FieldAsetToX
fieldC FieldC OPTIONAL, -- Need M
fieldD FieldD OPTIONAL, -- Cond FieldCsetToY
nonCriticalExtension SEQUENCE {} OPTIONAL
}
\-- /example/ ASN1STOP
_Conditional presence_ _Explanation_
* * *
_FieldAsetToX_ The field is mandatory present if fieldA is included and set to
valueX. Otherwise the field is optionally present, need R. _FieldCsetToY_ The
field is optionally present, need M, if fieldC is configured and set to
valueY. Otherwise the field is absent and the UE does not maintain the value
# A.8 Miscellaneous
The following miscellaneous convention should be used:
\- UE capabilities: TS 38.306 [26] specifies that the network should in
general respect the UE\'s capabilities. Hence there is no need to include
statement clarifying that the network, when setting the value of a certain
configuration field, shall respect the related UE capabilities unless there is
a particular need e.g. particularly complicated cases.

# B.2 Description of BWP configuration options
There are two possible ways to configure BWP#0 (i.e. the initial BWP) for a
UE:
1) Configure _BWP-DownlinkCommon_ and _BWP-UplinkCommon_ in
_ServingCellConfigCommon_ , but do not configure dedicated configurations in
_BWP-DownlinkDedicated_ or _BWP-UplinkDedicated_ in _ServingCellConfig_.
2) Configure both _BWP-DownlinkCommon_ and _BWP-UplinkCommon_ in
_ServingCellConfigCommon_ and configure dedicated configurations in at least
one of _BWP-DownlinkDedicated_ or _BWP-UplinkDedicated_ in
_ServingCellConfig_.
The same way of configuration is used for UL BWP#0 and DL BWP#0 if both are
configured.
With the first option (illustrated by figure B2-1 below), the BWP#0 is not
considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e., UE only supporting one BWP can
still be configured with BWP#1 in addition to BWP#0 when using this
configuration. The BWP#0 can still be used even if it does not have the
dedicated configuration, albeit in a more limited manner since only the
SIB1-defined configurations are available. For example, only DCI format 1_0
can be used with BWP#0 without dedicated configuration, so changing to another
BWP requires RRCReconfiguration since DCI format 1_0 doesn\'t support DCI-
based switching.
Figure B2-1: BWP#0 configuration without dedicated configuration
With the second option (illustrated by figure B2-2 below), the BWP#0 is
considered to be an RRC-configured BWP, i.e. UE only supporting one BWP cannot
be configured with BWP#1 in addition to BWP#0 when using this configuration.
However, UE supporting more than one BWP can still switch to and from BWP#0
e.g. via DCI normally, and there are no explicit limitations to using the
BWP#0 (compared to the first option).
Figure B2-2: BWP#0 configuration with dedicated configuration
For BWP#0, the _BWP-DownlinkCommon_ and _BWP-UplinkCommon_ in
_ServingCellConfigCommon_ should match the parameters configured by MIB and
SIB1 (if provided) in the corresponding serving cell.
If a RedCap-specific initial UL/DL BWP is configured, for BWP switching, the
BWP #0 always maps to the RedCap-specific initial UL/DL BWP.
###### ## Annex C (normative): List of CRs Containing Early Implementable
Features and Corrections
This annex lists the Change Requests (CRs) whose changes may be implemented by
a UE of an earlier release than which the CR was approved in (i.e. CRs that
contain on their coversheets the sentence \"Implementation of this CR from
Rel-N will not cause interoperability issues\").

###### ## Annex D (normative): UE requirements on ASN.1 comprehension
This clause specifies UE requirements regarding the ASN.1 transfer syntax
support, i.e. the ASN.1 definitions to be comprehended by the UE.
A UE that indicates release X in field _accessStratumRelease_ shall comprehend
the entire transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release X, in particular at least the
first version upon ASN.1 freeze. The UE is however not required to support
dedicated signalling related transfer syntax associated with optional features
it does not support.
In case a UE that indicates release X in field _accessStratumRelease_ supports
a feature specified in release Y, which is later than release X, (i.e. early
UE implementation) additional requirements apply. The UE obviously also has to
support the ASN.1 parts related to indicating support of the feature (in UE
capabilities).
**Critical extensions (dedicated signaling)**
If the early implemented feature involves one or more critical extensions in
dedicated signalling, the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax
(ASN.1) of release Y that are related to the feature implemented early. This,
in particular, concerns the ASN.1 parts related to configuration of the
feature.
If configuration of an early implemented feature introduced in release Y
involves a message or field that has been critically extended, the UE shall
support configuration of all features supported by the UE that are associated
with sub-fields of this critical extension. Apart from the early implemented
feature(s), the UE needs, however, not to support functionality beyond what is
defined in the release the UE indicates in access stratum release.
Let\'s consider the example of a UE indicating value X in field
_accessStratumRelease_ that supports the features A1, A3, and A5, associated
with fields _fieldA1_ , _fieldA3_ and _fieldA5_ of _InformationElementA_ (see
ASN.1 below).
The feature A5 implemented early is associated with _fieldA5_ , and can only
be configured by the --rY version of _InformationElementA_. In such case, the
UE should support configuration of all the features A1, A3 and A5 associated
with fields _fieldA1_ , _fieldA3_ and _fieldA5_ by the --rY version of
_InformationElementA_.
If, however, one of the features was modified, e.g. the feature A3 associated
with _fieldA3_ , the network should assume the UE only supports the feature A3
according to the release it indicated in field _accessStratumRelease_ (i.e.
X).
The UE is neither required to support the additional code-point (_n80-vY0_)
nor the additional sub-field (_fieldA3c-rY_).
InformationElementA-rX ::= SEQUENCE {
fieldA1-rX InformationElementA1-rX OPTIONAL, -- Need N
fieldA2-rX InformationElementA2-rX OPTIONAL, -- Need R
fieldA3-rX InformationElementA3-rX OPTIONAL -- Need R

InformationElementA-rY ::= SEQUENCE {

fieldA2-rY InformationElementA2-rX OPTIONAL, -- Need R
fieldA3-rY InformationElementA3-rY OPTIONAL, -- Need R
fieldA4-rY InformationElementA4-rY OPTIONAL, -- Need R
fieldA5-rY InformationElementA5-rY OPTIONAL -- Need R
}
InformationElementA3-rX ::= SEQUENCE {
fieldA3a-rX InformationElementA3a-rX OPTIONAL, -- Need N
fieldA3b-rX ENUMERATED {n10, n20, n40} OPTIONAL -- Need R
}
InformationElementA3-rY ::= SEQUENCE {
fieldA3a-rY InformationElementA3a-rX OPTIONAL, -- Need N
fieldA3b-rY ENUMERATED {n10, n20, n40, n80-vY0} OPTIONAL, -- Need R
fieldA3c-rY InformationElementA3c-rY OPTIONAL -- Need R
}
**Non-critical extensions (dedicated and broadcast signaling)**
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions,
the UE shall comprehend the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) of release Y
that are related to the feature implemented early.
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions
in dedicated signaling, the network does not include extensions introduced
after the release X that are not the parts related to the feature which the UE
indicates early support of in UE capabilities. The UE shall anyway comprehend
the parts of the transfer syntax (ASN.1) which indicate absence of such
extensions.
If the early implemented feature involves one or more non-critical extensions
in system information, the SIB(s) containing the release Y fields related to
the early implemented features may also include other extensions introduced
after the release X that are not the parts related to the feature which the UE
supports. The UE shall comprehend such intermediate fields (but again is not
required to support the functionality associated with these intermediate
fields, in case this concerns optional features not supported by the UE).
