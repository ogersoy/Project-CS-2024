# Introduction
FFS
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies a general method used to derive Measurement
Uncertainties and Test Tolerances for UE conformance tests. The acceptable
uncertainties for each test case are documented and establish a system for
relating the Test Tolerances to the measurement uncertainties of the Test
System.
For UE radio transmitting and reception tests, only FR2 is considered in this
document. For UE RRM and Demodulation tests, both FR1 and FR2 are considered
in this document.
The test cases which have been analysed to determine Test Tolerances are
included as .zip files.
The present document is applicable from Release 15 up to the release indicated
on the front page of the present Terminal conformance specifications.

# 4 General Principles
## 4.1 Principle of Superposition
For multi-cell tests there are several cells each generating various Physical
channels. In general cells are combined along with AWGN, so the signal and
noise seen by the UE may be determined by more than one cell.
Since several cells may contribute towards the overall power applied to the
UE, a number of test system uncertainties affect the signal and noise seen by
the UE. The aim of the superposition method is to vary each controllable
parameter of the test system separately, and to establish its effect on the
critical parameters as seen by the UE receiver. The superposition principle
then allows the effect of each test system uncertainty to be added, to
calculate the overall effect.
The contributing test system uncertainties shall form a minimum set for the
superposition principle to be applicable.
## 4.2 Sensitivity analysis
A change in any one channel level or channel ratio generated at source does
not necessarily have a 1:1 effect at the UE. The effect of each controllable
parameter of the test system on the critical parameters as seen by the UE
receiver shall therefore be established. As a consequence of the sensitivity
scaling factors not necessarily being unity, the test system uncertainties
cannot be directly applied as test tolerances to the critical parameters as
seen by the UE.
EXAMPLE: In many of the tests described, the Ês / I~ot~ is one of the critical
parameters at the UE. Scaling factors are used to model the sensitivity of the
Ês / I~ot~ to each test system uncertainty. When the scaling factors have been
determined, the superposition principle then allows the effect of each test
system uncertainty to be added, to give the overall variability in the
critical parameters as seen at the UE.
There are often constraints on several parameters at the UE. The aim of the
sensitivity analysis, together with the acceptable test system uncertainties,
is to ensure that the variability in each of these parameters is controlled
within the limits necessary for the specification to apply. The test has then
been conducted under valid conditions.
## 4.3 Statistical combination of uncertainties
The acceptable uncertainties of the test system are specified as the
measurement uncertainty tolerance interval for a specific measurement that
contains 95 % of the performance of a population of test equipment. In the RRM
and UE radio transmission and reception conformance tests covered by the
present document, the Test System shall enable the stimulus signals in the
test case to be adjusted to within the specified range, with an uncertainty
not exceeding the specified values.
The method given in the present document combines the acceptable uncertainties
of the test system, to give the overall variability in the critical parameters
as seen at the UE. Since the process does not add any new uncertainties, the
method of combination should be chosen to maintain the same tolerance interval
for the combined uncertainty as is already specified for the contributing test
system uncertainties.
The basic principle for combining uncertainties is in accordance with ETR
273-1-2 [4]. In summary, the process requires 3 steps:
a) Express the value of each contributing uncertainty as a one standard
deviation figure, from knowledge of its numeric value and its distribution.
b) Combine all the one standard deviation figures as root-sum-squares, to give
the one standard deviation value for the combined uncertainty.
c) Expand the combined uncertainty by a coverage factor, according to the
tolerance interval required.
Provided that the contributing uncertainties have already been obtained using
this method, using a coverage factor of 2, further stages of combination can
be achieved by performing step b) alone, since steps a) and c) simply divide
by 2 and multiply by 2 respectively.
The root-sum-squares method is therefore used to maintain the same tolerance
interval for the combined uncertainty as is already specified for the
contributing test system uncertainties. In some cases where correlation
between contributing uncertainties has an adverse effect, the method is
modified in accordance with clause 4.4.5 of the present document.
In each analysis, the uncertainties are assumed to be uncorrelated, and are
added result root-sum-square unless otherwise stated.
The combination of uncertainties is performed using dB values for simplicity.
It has been shown that using dB uncertainty values gives a slightly worse
combined uncertainty result than using linear values for the uncertainties.
The analysis method therefore errs on the safe side.
## 4.4 Correlation between uncertainties
The statistical (root-sum-square) addition of uncertainties is based on the
assumption that the uncertainties are independent of each other. For
realisable test systems, the uncertainties may not be fully independent. The
validity of the method used to add uncertainties depends on both the type of
correlation and on the way in which the uncertainties affect the test
requirements.
Clauses 4.4.1 to 4.4.3 give examples to illustrate different types of
correlation.
Clauses 4.4.4 to 4.4.7 show how the scenarios applicable to multi-cell RRM
tests are treated.
### 4.4.1 Uncorrelated uncertainties
The graph shows an example of two test system uncertainties, A and B, which
affect a test requirement. Each sample from a population of test systems has a
specific value of error in parameter A, and a specific value of error in
parameter B. Each dot on the graph represents a sample from a population of
test systems, and is plotted according to its error values for parameters A
and B.
Figure 4.4.1-1: Example of two test system uncertainties affecting a test
requirement
It can be seen that a positive value of error in parameter A, for example, is
equally likely to occur with either a positive or a negative value of error in
parameter B. This is expected when two parameters are uncorrelated, such as
two uncertainties which arise from different and unrelated parts of the test
system.
### 4.4.2 Positively correlated uncertainties
The graph shows an example of two test system uncertainties, A and B, which
affect a test requirement. Each sample from a population of test systems has a
specific value of error in parameter A, and a specific value of error in
parameter B. Each dot on the graph represents a sample from a population of
test systems, and is plotted according to its error values for parameters A
and B.
Figure 4.4.2-1: Example of two test system uncertainties affecting a test
requirement
It can be seen that a positive value of error in parameter A, for example, is
more likely to occur with a positive value of error in parameter B and less
likely to occur with a negative value of error in parameter B. This can occur
when the two uncertainties arise from similar parts of the test system, or
when one component of the uncertainty affects both parameters in a similar
way.
In an extreme case, if the error in parameter A and the error in parameter B
came from the same sources of uncertainty, and no others, the dots would lie
on a straight line of slope +1.
### 4.4.3 Negatively correlated uncertainties
The graph shows an example of two test system uncertainties, A and B, which
affect a test condition. Each sample from a population of test systems has a
specific value of error in parameter A, and a specific value of error in
parameter B. Each dot on the graph represents a sample from a population of
test systems, and is plotted according to its error values for parameters A
and B.
Figure 4.4.3-1: Example of two test system uncertainties affecting a test
condition
It can be seen that a positive value of error in parameter A, for example, is
more likely to occur with a negative value of error in parameter B and less
likely to occur with a positive value of error in parameter B. This effect can
theoretically occur, and is included for completeness, but is unlikely in a
practical test system.
### 4.4.4 Treatment of uncorrelated uncertainties
If two uncertainties are uncorrelated, they are added statistically in the
analysis. Provided that each uncertainty is already expressed as an expanded
uncertainty with coverage factor 2, the contributing uncertainties are added
root-sum-squares to give a combined uncertainty which also has coverage factor
2, and the 95% tolerance interval is maintained.
This is the default assumption.
### 4.4.5 Treatment of positively correlated uncertainties with adverse effect
If two test system uncertainties are positively correlated, and if they affect
the value of a critical parameter in the same direction, the combined effect
may be greater than predicted by adding the contributing uncertainties root-
sum-squares.
In this scenario the two uncertainties are added worst-case in the analysis.
Provided that each uncertainty is already expressed as an expanded uncertainty
with coverage factor 2, the combined uncertainty will cover a 95% tolerance
interval even when the two contributing uncertainties are fully correlated. If
the two contributing uncertainties are less than fully correlated, the
combined uncertainty will cover a tolerance interval greater than 95%.
### 4.4.6 Treatment of positively correlated uncertainties with beneficial
effect
If two test system uncertainties are positively correlated, and if they affect
the value of a critical parameter in opposite directions, the combined effect
will be less than predicted by adding the contributing uncertainties root-sum-
squares.
In this scenario the two uncertainties are added statistically in the
analysis. Provided that each uncertainty is already expressed as an expanded
uncertainty with coverage factor 2, the combined uncertainty will cover a 95%
tolerance interval when the two contributing uncertainties are uncorrelated.
If the two contributing uncertainties are positively correlated, the combined
uncertainty will cover a tolerance interval greater than 95%.
### 4.4.7 Treatment of negatively correlated uncertainties
Negatively correlated uncertainties are excluded by the assumptions. This has
been agreed as an acceptable restriction on practical test systems, as the
mechanisms which produce correlation generally arise from similarities between
two parts of the test system, and therefore produce positive correlation.
# 5 Determination of Test System Uncertainties
## 5.1 General
The uncertainty of a test system when making measurements reduces the ability
of the test system to distinguish between conformant and non-conformant test
subjects. The aim is therefore to minimise uncertainty, subject to a number of
practical constraints:
a) A vendor\'s test system should be reproducible in the required quantities.
b) A choice of test systems should be available from different vendors.
c) The uncertainties should allow reasonable freedom of test system
implementation
d) The test system can be run automatically
e) The test system may include several radio access technologies
f) It should be possible to maintain calibration of deployed test systems over
reasonable spans of time and environmental conditions
In practice therefore within 3GPP the acceptable uncertainty of the test
system is the smallest value that can be agreed between the test system
vendors represented, consistent with the above constraints. The uncertainty
will not therefore be as low as could be achieved, for example, by a national
standards laboratory.
## 5.2 Uncertainty figures
The actual figures for the acceptable uncertainty of a test system are defined
in Annex F of 38.521-1, Annex F of 38.521-2, Annex F of 38.521-3, Annex F of
TS 38.521-4, Annex F of TS 38.533 and Annex C of 37.571-1. To avoid
maintenance issues with figures in separate specifications, the uncertainties
are not formally defined within the present document, but informative
guidelines are provided in Annex B to Annex E of the present document.
# 6 Determination of Test Tolerances

###### ## Annex A: Derivation documents for test tolerance
The documents (and spreadsheets where applicable) used to derive the test
tolerances for each test case are included in the present document as zip
files.
The aim is to provide a reference to completed test cases, so that test
tolerances for similar test cases can be derived on a common basis. The
information on test case grouping in clauses 7 and 8 can be used to identify
similarities.
# A.1 Void
# A.2 Handling of common Test Tolerance topics for radiated test cases defined
in TS 38.533
The basic principles of Test Tolerance analysis are the same for conducted
testing and radiated testing, but for radiated testing additional topics are
taken into account. This annex contains methods to handle common additional
topics, to allow re-use and to avoid the need for each test case analysis to
repeat the same detail.
Individual test case analyses are expected to follow the methods contained
here where applicable, and to refer to relevant clauses in this Annex.
## A.2.1 Angles of Arrival
### A.2.1.1 Relevant core requirements
In FR2, the performance of the UE depends on the downlink signal angle of
arrival, and is characterised by two parameters:
\- Refsens: lowest signal level for a given demodulation performance in the UE
Rx beam peak direction, specified in TS 38.101-2 [16] clause 7.3.2 according
to UE Power class, Channel bandwidth and operating band
\- EIS spherical coverage: lowest signal level for a given demodulation
performance in a specified percentile of other directions, specified in TS
38.101-2 [16] clause 7.3.4 according to UE Power class, Channel bandwidth and
operating band
As both of these requirements are defined in the context of a throughput
requirement, the UE is assumed to be using fine beams. Note that for
directions outside the specified percentile of spherical coverage directions,
there are no requirements. Testing must therefore be carried out within the
spherical coverage directions. For testing, direction is 3-dimensional, but
the principle can be illustrated in a 2-dimensional diagram:
Figure A.2.1.1-1: UE Rx Beam-peak and spherical coverage directions, Fine
beams
### A.2.1.2 Modelling of variation within spherical coverage directions
Within the spherical coverage directions, a signal may be anywhere from near
Rx Beam Peak (high gain direction, close to Refsens) to the worst of the
allowed percentile (low gain direction, close to EIS spherical coverage
requirement value). This is modelled by taking the midpoint of the Spherical
coverage range as the nominal value, and then adding a variation of ±(half the
difference between Refsens and Spherical coverage).
UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint in dB is derived as (UE Refsens - UE
Spherical coverage)/2
Figure A.2.1.2-1 shows an example for UE Power class 3, Channel bandwidth
100MHz and operating band n257. In this example the UE Spherical coverage gain
midpoint would be -5.45dB, as the gain is lower than in the Rx Beam peak
direction. Variation about the midpoint is handled as a UE uncertainty.
Figure A.2.1.2-1: Example modelling of variation within spherical coverage
directions, Fine beams
### A.2.1.3 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis
The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:
\- The Angle of Arrival for each downlink signal shall be defined: either from
UE Rx beam peak direction or from a direction within the EIS spherical
coverage
\- Variations over the EIS spherical coverage directions shall be included,
using the method shown in A.2.1.2.
Variations over the EIS spherical coverage directions do not directly affect
signals applied to the UE, but they do affect the SS-RSRP level measured by
the UE, and the Es/Iot at UE baseband. Where the test case has requirements on
UE baseband Es/Iot~BB~, UE internal noise calculation is given in clause
A.2.3, and calculation of Es/Iot at UE baseband is given in clauses A.2.4 and
A.2.7.
## A.2.2 UE Fine beams and Rough beams
### A.2.2.1 Relevant core requirements
UE requirements such as Refsens in TS 38.101-2 [16], assume that the UE is
using a fine beam which has higher antenna gain to give good demodulation
performance. However, in some RRM scenarios where the UE is for example
searching for or measuring other cells, the UE uses rough beams which have
lower antenna gain. The difference in gain is specified depending on the Angle
of Arrival:
\- The Gain difference Y between fine and rough beams in the UE Rx beam peak
direction is specified in TS 38.133 [17] Table B.2.1.3.1-1 according to UE
Power class
\- The Gain difference Z between fine and rough beams in the UE Spherical
coverage directions is specified in TS 38.133 [17] Table B.2.1.3.2-1 according
to UE Power class
The Gain differences Y and Z are not dependent on Channel bandwidth or
operating band. The concept is illustrated in Figures A.2.2.1-1 and A.2.2.1-2.
Figure A.2.2.1-1: Fine and rough beams, Rx Beam peak direction
Figure A.2.2.1-2: Fine and rough beams, spherical coverage directions
### A.2.2.2 Modelling of Fine beams and Rough beams
Where the UE is assumed to use fine beams, the scenario is already covered in
the Refsens and EIS spherical coverage requirements, and no further
modifications are needed.
Where the UE is assumed to use rough beams, the effect is modelled as a
reduction in gain of YdB or ZdB, according to the Angle of Arrival of each
downlink signal. The reduction in gain translates to a higher UE internal
noise seen at the Reference point where the downlink signals are applied. UE
noise calculated from Refsens or from EIS spherical coverage requirements is
increased by YdB or ZdB respectively. UE internal noise calculation is given
in clause A.2.3.
### A.2.2.3 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis
The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:
\- The Type of beam assumed to be used by the UE for each downlink signal
shall be defined: either Fine Beam or Rough Beam
\- Where UE internal noise is relevant, and the UE is assumed to be using
Rough Beams, it is increased by the value of Y or Z, selected according to UE
Power class and Angle of Arrival.
UE internal noise calculation is given in clause A.2.3.
## A.2.3 UE internal noise
### A.2.3.1 Relevant core requirements
The relevant Core requirements are:
\- Refsens or EIS spherical coverage, specified in TS 38.101-2 [16] clauses
7.3.2 and 7.3.4 respectively
\- UE baseband SNR at which Refsens or EIS spherical coverage is specified, in
TS 38.133 [17] clause B.2.1.3
\- N~RB~ in channel BW at which Refsens or EIS spherical coverage is
specified, in TS 38.101-2 [16] Table 5.3.2-1
\- Gain difference between fine and rough beams, in TS 38.133 [17] clause
B.2.1.3
\- UE multi-band relaxation factors, in TS 38.101-2 [16] Table 6.2.1.3-4
### A.2.3.2 Calculation method
For signals arriving from Rx Beam Peak direction:
Noise in dBm/SCS = Refsens ~PC,\ band,\ Ch\ BW~ -- SNR~Refsens~ -10Log~10~
(N~RB_Ch\ BW,\ SCS~ x 12) +Y ~PC~ + ΣMB~P~
_where:_
Refsens ~PC,\ band,\ Ch\ BW~ is the reference sensitivity value in dBm
specified in TS 38.101-2 [16] clause 7.3.2 according to Power Class, Operating
band and Channel bandwidth
SNR~Refsens~ is the SNR used for simulation of Refsens and EIS spherical
coverage, and is -1 dB
N~RB_Ch\ BW,\ SCS~ is the number of PRBs specified in TS 38.101-2 [16] Table
5.3.2-1 according to Channel bandwidth and subcarrier spacing (not necessarily
equal to the number of PRBs used in the test case)
12 is the number of subcarriers in a PRB
Y ~PC~ is the gain difference in dB specified in TS 38.133 [17] Table
B.2.1.3.1-1, according to Power Class, and is only applied when the UE is
assumed to be using rough beams. Otherwise, use 0dB
ΣMB~P~ is the UE multi-band relaxation factor value in dB specified in TS
38.101-2 [16] clause 6.2.1
For signals arriving from Spherical coverage directions:
Noise in dBm/SCS = EIS spherical coverage ~PC,\ band,\ Ch\ BW~ -- SNR~Refsens~
-10Log~10~ (N~RB_Ch\ BW,\ SCS~ x 12) +Z ~PC~ + ΣMB~S~
_where:_
EIS spherical coverage ~PC,\ band,\ Ch\ BW~ is the EIS spherical coverage
value in dBm specified in TS 38.101-2 [16] clause 7.3.4 according to Power
Class, Operating band and Channel bandwidth
SNR~Refsens~ is the SNR used for simulation of Refsens and EIS spherical
coverage, and is -1 dB
N~RB_Ch\ BW,\ SCS~ is the number of PRBs specified in TS 38.101-2 [16] Table
5.3.2-1 according to Channel bandwidth and subcarrier spacing (not necessarily
equal to the number of PRBs used in the test case)
12 is the number of subcarriers in a PRB
Z ~PC~ is the gain difference in dB specified in TS 38.133 [17] Table
B.2.1.3.2-1, according to Power Class, and is only applied when the UE is
assumed to be using rough beams. Otherwise, use 0dB
ΣMB~S~ is the UE multi-band relaxation factor value in dB specified in TS
38.101-2 [16] clause 6.2.1
The analysis spreadsheet converts dBm/SCS to linear power in pW/SCS for ease
of further calculations.
### A.2.3.3 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis
The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:
\- Where the test case has requirements on UE baseband Es/Iot~BB~, the Test
Tolerance analysis should include UE internal noise in the calculation
\- UE internal noise is calculated using the method in A.2.3.2
## A.2.4 Calculation of Es/Iot at UE baseband
### A.2.4.1 Relevant core requirements
Core requirements applicable to RRM test cases depend on the test purpose, and
should be selected for each test case. For test cases where the UE makes a
measurement, the following are relevant:
\- Measurement Performance requirements are specified in TS 38.133 [17] clause
10, and side conditions such as Es/Iot are included in the core requirements
for each measurement. For FR2, notes in tables clarify that Es/Iot is at UE
baseband.
\- Operating band specific conditions for RRM requirements are specified in TS
38.133 [17] Annex B, and side conditions such as Es/Iot are included for each
measurement. For FR2, notes in tables clarify that Es/Iot is at UE baseband.
Other UE core requirements may also have conditions on Es/Iot.
### A.2.4.2 Calculation method
An example is provided here for a scenario with applied AWGN and two intra-
frequency cells. SSB Es/Iot at UE baseband is calculated for Cell 1\.
Interference to Cell 1 comes from the applied AWGN, from the UE internal
noise, and from Cell 2. The values are chosen for illustration, and not taken
from any specific test case.
Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ = 10Log~10~ ((Cell 1 SSB power) / (Applied AWGN power +
UE internal noise + Cell 2 SSB power))
_Where_ Applied AWGN power, UE internal noise, Cell 1 power and Cell 2 power
are linear powers in W, per subcarrier.
Figure A.2.4.2-1: Example Es/Iot~BB~ scenario, applied AWGN and two intra-
frequency cells
_In this case, the calculation gives_ Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ = 10Log~10~ (0.139
/ (0.055 + 0.037 + 0.070)) = **-0.67dB**
The main point is that the Es/Iot at UE baseband is lower than the applied
Es/Iot, because the UE internal noise adds to the interference, and can be a
significant contribution for the parameters used in some test cases.
The presence of UE internal noise also affects the calculation of Es/Iot
sensitivity factors in the Test Tolerance analysis. The UE internal noise is a
fixed (worst) value, being based on the UE minimum requirement, and is taken
into account in the scaling which uses linear powers:
\- Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity to applied AWGN absolute power = UE
internal noise /(Applied AWGN power + UE internal noise + Cell 2 SSB power).
In this example, (0.037 / (0.055 + 0.037 + 0.070)) = **+0.230**
\- Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity to Cell 1 Es/Noc = **+1.000**
\- Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity to Cell 2 Es/Noc = -Cell 2 SSB power
/(Applied AWGN power + UE internal noise + Cell 2 SSB power). In this example,
(0.070 / (0.055 + 0.037 + 0.070)) = -**0.429**
A positive sensitivity factor is used where an increase in the quantity
produces an increase in Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~, for example increasing Cell 1
Es/Noc. A negative sensitivity factor is used where an increase in the
quantity produces a decrease in Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~, for example increasing
Cell 2 Es/Noc. The sensitivity factors are used to scale the uncertainties.
Where the uncertainties are uncorrelated, as here, they are added root-sum-
square so the sign of the sensitivity factor does not have any effect. In
special cases where the uncertainties are correlated, they may be added
arithmetically and the sign affects the result, as in clause A.2.7.
### A.2.4.3 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis
The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:
\- UE internal noise is included in the interference when calculating
Es/Iot~BB~
\- Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity factors are calculated using the method in A.2.4.2
## A.2.5 Calculation of Applied Io
### A.2.5.1 Relevant core requirements
Core requirements applicable to RRM test cases depend on the test purpose, and
should be selected for each test case. For test cases where the UE makes a
measurement, the following are relevant:
\- Measurement Performance requirements are specified in TS 38.133 [17] clause
10, and side conditions such as Io are included in the core requirements for
each measurement. Normally the maximum Io condition is specified in the
channel bandwidth, whereas the minimum Io condition is specified as a power
density per subcarrier.
### A.2.5.2 Calculation method
An example is provided here for a scenario with applied AWGN and two intra-
frequency cells. Io applied to the UE is the arithmetic sum of linear powers
in the channel bandwidth. UE internal noise is not counted, as it is not
applied to the UE. The values are chosen for illustration, and not taken from
any specific test case.
Channel Io = 10Log~10~ (Applied AWGN power + Cell 1 power + Cell 2 power) +
10Log~10~ (N~RB_TC~ x 12)
_where:_
AWGN, Cell 1 power and Cell 2 power are linear powers in W, per subcarrier
N~RB_TC~ is the number of PRBs allocated in the test case (not necessarily
equal to the number of PRBs in the channel bandwidth)
12 is the number of subcarriers in a PRB
Figure A.2.5.2-1: Example Io scenario, applied AWGN and two intra-frequency
cells
_With 24 PRBs allocated, the example gives_ Io = 10Log~10~ ((0.055 +0.139
+0.070) x10^-9^)+10Log~10~ (24 x 12) = **-71.2dBm**
Io sensitivity factors in the Test Tolerance analysis are based on linear
powers:
\- Io sensitivity to applied AWGN absolute power = **+1.000**
\- Io sensitivity to Cell 1 Es/Noc = Cell 1 power / (Applied AWGN power \+
Cell 1 power + Cell 2 power). In this example, (0.139 / (0.055 + 0.139 \+
0.070)) = **+0.527**
\- Io sensitivity to Cell 2 Es/Noc = Cell 2 power / (Applied AWGN power \+
Cell 1 power + Cell 2 power). In this example, (0.070 / (0.055 + 0.139 \+
0.070)) = +**0.264**
All the sensitivity factors are positive, as an increase in the quantity
produces an increase in Io. The sensitivity factors are used to scale the
uncertainties.
### A.2.5.3 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis
The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:
\- Io is calculated using the method in A.2.5.2
\- Io sensitivity factors are calculated using the method in A.2.5.2
## A.2.6 UE Reported RSRP and UE gain
### A.2.6.1 Relevant core requirements
_SS-RSRP is defined to be measured based on the combined signal from antenna
elements corresponding to a given receiver branch._ The reference point for
requirement parameters from the UE perspective is the input of the UE antenna
array. The UE gain "G" relates the _combined signal from antenna elements
corresponding to a given receiver branch to the_ reference point for
requirement parameters.
For test cases where the UE reports a measured value, or compares a measured
value to a signalled threshold, the UE Gain "G" affects the SS-RSRP level
measured by the UE
\- The UE Gain from the reference point (where test case parameters are
specified) to the SS-RSRP measurement point is specified in TS 38.133 [17]
clause B.2.1.5. As the UE gain "G" is specified for Rx Beam Peak angle of
arrival, it does not include effects related to spherical coverage.
\- Measurement Performance requirements are specified in TS 38.133 [17] clause
10, and include accuracy requirements as +/-dB values. For FR2, the accuracy
is considered to apply at the _combined signal from antenna elements
corresponding to a given receiver branch, and_ does not include the UE gain
"G".
The specified range of UE Gain "G" allows the UE to use either Rough beams or
Fine beams, so no further allowance is required for the parameters Y or Z in
A.2.2.
### A.2.6.2 Absolute RSRP
An example is provided here for a scenario where the UE reports SS-RSRP for a
signal arriving from a direction within the UE spherical coverage, to
illustrate variation from both UE spherical coverage and variation from UE
gain "G".
UE-measured SS-RSRP~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP + UE Spherical coverage gain
midpoint + UE gain G midpoint
_where:_
Applied SSB_RP is specified in the test case, either directly as Es or derived
from Noc and Es/Noc, and is in dBm per subcarrier
UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint in dB is derived as (UE Refsens - UE
Spherical coverage)/2
UE gain G midpoint in dB is derived as (Min value of G + Max value of G)/2
_As an example for a UE power class 3 in band n257, measuring SS_RSRP from a
spherical coverage direction,_ UE-measured SS-RSRP~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP
-5.45dB +5.0dB.
Figure A.2.1.2-1 shows the derivation of UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint.
Variation about the midpoint is handled as a UE uncertainty. For signals
arriving from Rx Beam Peak direction, this gain is 0dB and does not vary.
Figure A.2.6.2-1 shows the derivation of UE gain G midpoint. Variation about
the midpoint is handled as a UE uncertainty.
Figure A.2.6.2-1: Example modelling of UE Gain "G" variation
To calculate the range of valid SS-RSRP values that can be reported by the UE,
contributions from Spherical coverage gain variation, UE gain variation and UE
reporting accuracy are considered:
Figure A.2.6.2-2: modelling of contributions affecting SS-RSRP reported values
Reported SS-RSRP = UE measured SS-RSRP~nom~ ±Spherical coverage gain variation
±UE gain variation ±UE accuracy
_where:_
UE measured SS-RSRP~nom~ is the nominal value derived from Applied SSB_RP, UE
Spherical coverage gain midpoint and UE gain G midpoint
Spherical coverage gain variation is derived from Refsens and Spherical
coverage, as shown in Figure A.2.1.2-1
UE gain variation is derived from Minimum and maximum values of G, as shown in
Figure A.2.6.2-1
UE accuracy is the absolute accuracy from the core requirement referred to in
A.2.6.1
_As an example for a UE power class 3 in band n257, measuring SS_RSRP from a
spherical coverage direction with applied Io > -70dBm, the variation would be
(_±5.45dB ±15dB ±8dB) = **±28.45dB**
These variations are added arithmetically in the test case analysis, as each
could be systematic and not random. For signals arriving from Rx Beam Peak
direction, spherical coverage gain variation is 0dB.
### A.2.6.3 Relative RSRP, 2 levels on same cell, same Angle of Arrival
An example is provided here for a scenario where the test case require the UE
to report SS-RSRP for the same cell at two different levels, with the signal
arriving from the same direction. The Angle of Arrival may be within the UE
spherical coverage, or from Rx Beam peak direction.
UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP1 + UE Spherical coverage gain
midpoint + UE gain G midpoint
UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP2 + UE Spherical coverage gain
midpoint + UE gain G midpoint
UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ - UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP2 \-
Applied SSB_RP1
_where:_
Applied SSB_RP1 and Applied SSB_RP2 are specified in the test case, either
directly as Es or derived from Noc and Es/Noc, and are in dBm per subcarrier
_It can be seen that_ UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint and UE gain G
midpoint cancel out for this relative measurement, as they remain the same for
a signal from the same Angle of Arrival.
Reported SS-RSRP2 - Reported SS-RSRP1 = UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ - UE-
measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ ±UE accuracy
_where:_
UE accuracy is the relative accuracy from the core requirement referred to in
A.2.6.1
### A.2.6.4 Relative RSRP, 2 intra-frequency cells, same Angle of Arrival
An example is provided here for a scenario where the test case require the UE
to report SS-RSRP for two different cells, with the signals arriving from the
same direction. The Angle of Arrival may be within the UE spherical coverage,
or from Rx Beam peak direction.
UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP1 + UE Spherical coverage gain
midpoint + UE gain G midpoint
UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP2 + UE Spherical coverage gain
midpoint + UE gain G midpoint
UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ - UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP2 \-
Applied SSB_RP1
_where:_
Applied SSB_RP1 and Applied SSB_RP2 are specified in the test case, either
directly as Es or derived from Noc and Es/Noc, and are in dBm per subcarrier
_It can be seen that_ UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint and UE gain G
midpoint cancel out for this relative measurement, as they are the same for
signals from the same Angle of Arrival.
Reported SS-RSRP2 - Reported SS-RSRP1 = UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ - UE-
measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ ±UE accuracy
_where:_
UE accuracy is the relative accuracy from the core requirement referred to in
A.2.6.1
### A.2.6.5 Relative RSRP, 2 inter-frequency cells, same Angle of Arrival
[FFS]
### A.2.6.6 Relative RSRP, 2 cells, different Angles of Arrival
Examples are provided here for scenarios where the test case requires the UE
to report SS-RSRP for two different cells, with the signals arriving from
different directions.
For both Angles of Arrival from UE spherical coverage directions:
UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP1 + UE Spherical coverage gain
midpoint + UE gain G midpoint
UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP2 + UE Spherical coverage gain
midpoint + UE gain G midpoint
UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ - UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP2 \-
Applied SSB_RP1
_where:_
> Applied SSB_RP1 and Applied SSB_RP2 are specified in the test case, either
> directly as Es or derived from Noc and Es/Noc, and are in dBm per subcarrier
_For the nominal values,_ UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint and UE gain G
midpoint cancel out for this relative measurement. For the variations, UE gain
variation cancels out as the same value affects both cells, but Spherical
coverage gain variation applies separately to each Angle of Arrival.
Reported SS-RSRP2 - Reported SS-RSRP1 = UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ - UE-
measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ ±Spherical coverage gain variation~AoA1~ ±Spherical
coverage gain variation~AoA2~ ±UE accuracy
_where:_
Spherical coverage gain variation~AoA1~ is derived from Refsens and Spherical
coverage, as in Figure A.2.1.2-1
Spherical coverage gain variation~AoA2~ is derived from Refsens and Spherical
coverage, as in Figure A.2.1.2-1
UE accuracy is the relative accuracy from the core requirement referred to in
A.2.6.1
For one Angle of Arrival from UE spherical coverage directions, and one from
Rx Beam peak direction:
UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP1 + UE Spherical coverage gain
midpoint + UE gain G midpoint
UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP2 + UE gain G midpoint
UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ - UE-measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ = Applied SSB_RP2 \-
Applied SSB_RP1 - UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint
_where:_
Applied SSB_RP1 and Applied SSB_RP2 are specified in the test case, either
directly as Es or derived from Noc and Es/Noc, and are in dBm per subcarrier
UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint in dB is derived as (UE Refsens - UE
Spherical coverage)/2
_For the nominal values,_ UE gain G midpoint cancels out for this relative
measurement, but UE Spherical coverage gain midpoint applies to one Angle of
Arrival. For the variations, UE gain variation cancels out as the same value
affects both cells, but Spherical coverage gain variation applies to one Angle
of Arrival.
Reported SS-RSRP2 - Reported SS-RSRP1 = UE-measured SS-RSRP2~nom~ - UE-
measured SS-RSRP1~nom~ ±Spherical coverage gain variation~AoA1~ ±UE accuracy
_where:_
Spherical coverage gain variation~AoA1~ is derived from Refsens and Spherical
coverage, as in Figure A.2.1.2-1
UE accuracy is the relative accuracy from the core requirement referred to in
A.2.6.1
### A.2.6.7 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis
The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:
\- UE-measured SS-RSRP~nom~ is calculated using the relevant method in A.2.6.2
to A.2.6.6
\- The range of SS-RSRP reported values is calculated using the relevant
methods in A.2.6.2 to A.2.6.6
## A.2.7 Intra-frequency cells without AWGN, same Angle of Arrival
### A.2.7.1 Test system
In a practical test system running a test case where Intra-frequency cells
come from the same Angle of Arrival, the level uncertainties for all cells
will be highly correlated. If the test case has applied AWGN, it will specify
Noc and Es/Noc, and the absolute uncertainty for applied AWGN will be the
dominant contribution to the overall Es uncertainty for each cell. As AWGN is
common to all cells on that frequency, the correlation is already included.
If the test case does not have applied AWGN, it will specify Es for each cell,
with an absolute Es uncertainty for each cell. The method of handling the
effect of correlation in the Test Tolerance analysis is given in A.2.7.2 and
A.2.7.3.
### A.2.7.2 Calculation method for Es/Iot at UE baseband
An example is provided here for a scenario with two intra-frequency cells,
without applied AWGN. SSB Es/Iot at UE baseband is calculated for Cell 1.
Interference to Cell 1 comes from the UE internal noise and from Cell 2. The
values are chosen for illustration, and not taken from any specific test case.
Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ = 10Log~10~ ((Cell 1 SSB power) / (UE internal noise +
Cell 2 SSB power))
_Where_ UE internal noise, Cell 1 power and Cell 2 power are linear powers in
W, per subcarrier.
Figure A.2.7.2-1: Example Es/Iot~BB~ scenario, two intra-frequency cells
_In this case, the calculation gives_ Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ = 10Log~10~ (0.139
/ (0.037 + 0.070)) = **1.14dB**
The presence of UE internal noise also affects the calculation of Es/Iot
sensitivity factors in the Test Tolerance analysis. The UE internal noise is a
fixed (worst) value, being based on the UE minimum requirement, and is taken
into account in the scaling which uses linear powers:
\- Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity to Cell 1 Es = **+1.000**
\- Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity to Cell 2 Es = -Cell 2 SSB power /(UE
internal noise + Cell 2 SSB power). In this example, (0.070 / (0.037 + 0.070))
= -**0.651**
A positive sensitivity factor is used where an increase in the quantity
produces an increase in Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~, for example increasing Cell 1
Es. A negative sensitivity factor is used where an increase in the quantity
produces a decrease in Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~, for example increasing Cell 2
Es. The sensitivity factors are used to scale the uncertainties.
Where the uncertainties are correlated, as here, they are added arithmetically
and the sign affects the result. In this example, increasing Cell 1 Es
increases the Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~, but the correlated increase in Cell 2 Es
decreases the Cell 1 SSB Es/Iot~BB~. The overall effect is smaller, and
depends on the ratios of linear powers.
### A.2.7.3 Calculation method for Applied Io
An example is provided here for a scenario with two intra-frequency cells,
without applied AWGN. Io applied to the UE is the arithmetic sum of linear
powers in the channel bandwidth. UE internal noise is not counted, as it is
not applied to the UE. The values are chosen for illustration, and not taken
from any specific test case.
Channel Io = 10Log~10~ (Cell 1 power + Cell 2 power) + 10Log~10~ (N~RB_TC~ x
12)
_where:_
Cell 1 power and Cell 2 power are linear powers in W, per subcarrier
N~RB_TC~ is the number of PRBs allocated in the test case (not necessarily
equal to the number of PRBs in the channel bandwidth)
12 is the number of subcarriers in a PRB
Figure A.2.7.3-1: Example Io scenario, two intra-frequency cells
_With 24 PRBs allocated, the example gives_ Io = 10Log~10~ ((0.139 +0.070)
x10^-9^) +10Log~10~ (24 x 12) = **-72.2dBm**
Io sensitivity factors in the Test Tolerance analysis are based on linear
powers:
\- Io sensitivity to Cell 1 Es = Cell 1 power / (Cell 1 power + Cell 2 power).
In this example, (0.139 / (0.139 + 0.070)) = **+0.667**
\- Io sensitivity to Cell 2 Es = Cell 2 power / (Cell 1 power + Cell 2 power).
In this example, (0.070 / (0.139 + 0.070)) = +**0.333**
All the sensitivity factors are positive, as an increase in the quantity
produces an increase in Io. The sensitivity factors are used to scale the
uncertainties.
Where the uncertainties are correlated, as here, they are added
arithmetically, and the sign affects the result. In this example increasing
Cell 1 Es increases Io, and the correlated increase in Cell 2 Es also
increases Io. The overall effect of scaling adds up to 1, as expected.
### A.2.7.4 Principles for Test Tolerance analysis
The following principles shall be followed in the test case analysis:
\- For Intra-frequency cells from the same Angle of Arrival without AWGN,
Es/Iot~BB~ is calculated using the method in A.2.7.2.
\- For Intra-frequency cells from the same Angle of Arrival without AWGN,
Es/Iot~BB~ sensitivity factors are calculated using the method in A.2.7.2.
\- For Intra-frequency cells from the same Angle of Arrival without AWGN, Io
is calculated using the method in A.2.7.3.
\- For Intra-frequency cells from the same Angle of Arrival without AWGN, Io
sensitivity factors are calculated using the method in A.2.7.3.

# A.4 Design of radiated test cases defined in TS 38.533
The design of radiated test cases defined in TS 38.533 is more challenging
than for conducted test cases, because the over-the-air path loss reduces the
downlink power seen by the UE, and reduces the uplink power received by the
test system.
The achievable downlink power in a practical test system is restricted, and
there is less dB range between the lowest and highest power that can be
applied within the UE Core requirement side conditions.
The range of uplink power that can be measured by a practical test system is
also restricted, by signal-to-noise ratio considerations at the low end, and
by the UE output power at the high end.
For both downlink and uplink, the achievable dB range is most restricted when
the signal arrives from the UE Spherical coverage direction. In a test case it
is further restricted by downlink power level uncertainty or uplink power
measurement uncertainty, which are both larger for radiated signals than for
conducted signals. This Annex considers the effect of restricted dB range on
radiated RRM test case design.
## A.4.1 Downlink considerations
### A.4.1.1 Side conditions for Rx Beam Peak angle of arrival
Side conditions for Rx Beam Peak angle of arrival are less stringent than for
Spherical Coverage angle of arrival. They are not directly analysed here, but
the same principles apply as for Spherical Coverage in clause A.4.1.2.
### A.4.1.2 Side conditions for Spherical Coverage angle of arrival
As an example, consider a test case where the UE makes measurements on the
downlink signal, for example in Event-triggered reporting. Some side condition
values are band-dependent, and also depend on whether the cell being measured
is intra-frequency or inter-frequency. An adverse case is chosen for
illustration:
\- Spherical Coverage angle of arrival
\- Inter-frequency
\- UE Power Class 3
\- Band n259
\- Maximum multi-band relaxation
\- Full RB allocation
\- UE is required to make measurements, so side conditions apply
The scenario is however best case on two points:
\- Applied Es only, without Noc (only UE internal noise)
\- Only one cell on the frequency (no other intra-frequency cells)
Figure A.4.1.2-1: Example side conditions when UE is making measurements
It can be seen that when uncertainties are taken into account (an indicative
value of ±6dB is used), the applied level range can be from -87dBm/SCS to
-85dBm/SCS, a range of only 2dB. This is very restrictive for the test case
design.
### A.4.1.3 Test case design options to increase downlink dB range
A number of options are available to increase the dB range of the applied
downlink signal, if necessary. For a specific test case, only some may be
available, for example in a test case such as Radio Link Monitoring, it would
not be possible to use applied Es only, because the test case relies on a
well-defined SNR at the UE baseband.
Table A.4.1.3-1: Options to increase downlink dB range
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Option | Applicability | Comments | +======================+======================+======================+ | Reduce number of | All Test cases | 120kHz SSB SCS, use | | allocated RBs | | 24RBs | | | | | | | | 240kHz SSB SCS, use | | | | 48RBs Allocated RBs | | | | must include CORESET | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Use applied Es only, | Test cases where | Maximises Es | | without applied Noc | Es/Iot~BB~ | contribution to Io. | | | requirement is to be | | | | ≥ defined value | Not suitable for | | | | test cases where | | | | Es/Iot~BB~ is | | | | intended as | | | | well-defined SNR. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | If applied Noc is | Test cases where | Not suitable for | | used, reduce margin | Es/Iot~BB~ | test cases where | | above UE internal | requirement is to be | Es/Iot~BB~ is | | noise | ≥ defined value | intended as | | | | well-defined SNR. | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Use time-division | Test cases using | Avoids | | multiplexing with | SSB#0, SSB#1 | intra-frequency | | SSB#0, SSB#1 | | interference and | | | | degradation of | | | | Es/Iot~BB~ | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Use Rx Beam Peak AoA | Test cases where | Adequate test | | instead of Spherical | using Rx Beam Peak | coverage may be | | Coverage | for one or both AoA, | achievable across | | | instead of Spherical | several Test cases | | | Coverage, would | | | | provide adequate | | | | test coverage | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Allow Io > -50dBm | Test cases where | Test system may not | | | measurement side | be able to deliver | | | conditions are not | >-50dBm | | | applicable | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Restrict to 120kHz | Test cases with a | Adequate test | | SSB SCS | 240kHz SSB SCS | coverage of 120kHz | | | Configuration | and 240kHz SSB SCS | | | | may be achievable | | | | across several Test | | | | cases | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+

###### ## Annex B: Acceptable uncertainty of test system for test cases
defined in TS 38.521-2 for radiative testing
This annex contains suggested uncertainties for each test case in TS 38.521-2.
# B.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle
Three permitted test methodologies, DFF, IFF and NFTF, have been identified
for UE RF FR2 test cases defined in TS 38.521-2.
This Annex is deriving Total expanded Measurement Uncertainties per test case
for each test methodology.
Threshold MU is equivalent to Total expanded uncertainty of the reference
methodology which has been defined as IFF.
If the Total expanded Measurement Uncertainty per test case of a permitted
test method is lower than or equal to the threshold MU, then that test method
is applicable to the respective test cases defined in TS 38.521-2.
## B.1.1 Uncertainty budget calculation principle for DFF
The uncertainty tables should be presented with two stages:
\- Stage 1: the calibration of the absolute level of the DUT measurement
results is performed by means of using a calibration antenna whose absolute
gain is known at the frequencies of measurement
\- Stage 2: the actual measurement with the DUT as either the transmitter or
receiver is performed.
The MU budget should comprise the following headings:
1) The uncertainty source. Compile a complete list of the individual
measurement uncertainty elements that contribute to a measurement
2) Determine the maximum value of each uncertainty
3) Determine the distribution of each uncertainty (rectangular, U-shaped,
etc.),
4) Calculate (if necessary) the standard deviation of each uncertainty, _u~i~_
, (NOTE 1) for each uncertainty element,
5) Convert the units (if necessary) of each uncertainty element into the
chosen unit, i.e., dB,
6) Combine ALL the standard uncertainties by the root-sum-squares method to
derive the \'combined standard uncertainty\',
7) Multiply the resulting combined standard uncertainty by an expansion factor
\'_k_ \' to derive the \'expanded uncertainty\' for a given confidence level.
All expanded uncertainties are quoted to 95% confidence level, so _k_ is taken
as 1.96. This gives 95% confidence that the true value is within 1.96 times
the combined standard uncertainty of the measured value to derive the
\'expanded uncertainty\'.
8) Any systematic errors are added to the expanded uncertainty to derive the
'total expanded uncertainty', i.e.,
NOTE 1: The standard deviation from a data set of _N_ samples is defined as
where _s~k~_ are the respective sample results and the mean of all _N_
samples. For an uncertainty _u~i~_ in dB, the dB values (instead of the linear
powers) of _s~k~_ and are used.
## B.1.2 Uncertainty budget calculation principle for IFF
The same as defined in B.1.1.
## B.1.3 Uncertainty budget calculation principle for NFTF
The same as defined in B.1.1 with the exception of Stage 2, only the
measurement of the DUT transmitter is performed.
# B.2 Measurement error contribution descriptions
## B.2.1 Measurement error contribution descriptions for DFF
### B.2.1.1 Positioning misalignment
This contribution originates from the misalignment of the testing direction
and the beam peak direction of the measurement antenna due to imperfect
rotation operation. The pointing misalignment may happen in both azimuth and
vertical directions and the effect of the misalignment depends highly on the
beam width of the beam under test. The same level of misalignment results in a
larger measurement error for a narrower beam.
### B.2.1.2 Measure distance uncertainty
The cause of this uncertainty contributor is due to the reduction of distance
between the measurement antenna and the DUT. If the distance of separation is
2D^2^/lambda based on D being the entire device size, then the phase variation
is 22.5deg. Whether this is the minimum acceptable criteria of phase taper
over the entire DUT is FFS and shall be assessed during final MU definition
for the test method. Any reduction in the distance of separation increases the
phase variation and creates an error which is DUT dependant. Determination of
limit of the error shall be done during final MU definition for the test
method.
### B.2.1.3 Quality of quiet zone
The quality of the quiet zone procedure characterizes the quiet zone
performance of the anechoic chamber, specifically the effect of reflections
within the anechoic chamber including any positioners and support structures.
The MU term additionally includes the amplitude variations effect of
offsetting the directive antenna array inside a DUT from the centre of the
quiet zone as well as the directivity MU, i.e., the variation of antenna gains
in the different direct line-of-sight links. An additional MU term related to
phase variation and phase ripple effects which depends on measurement distance
is FFS, and shall be assessed during final MU definition for the test method.
This might require an augmentation of the quality of the quiet zone validation
procedure.
### B.2.1.4 Mismatch
Mismatch uncertainty occurs when;
\- Changing the signal path between the measurement and calibration procedure
\- Evaluating the insertion loss of a signal path
The mismatch uncertainty for a system consisting of a generator, a load and a
component in between is defined as
,
Where denotes the reflection coefficient and is the transmission coefficient,
both in linear voltage ratios.
For a cascade of several components, the interactions between all components
have to be evaluated. For example, for four devices in a row (shown in Figure
B.2.1.4-1) the following contributions have to be accounted for: AB, BC, CD,
ABC, BCD, ABCD. The term ABCD represents the interaction between A and D
(generator and load) with the components B and C in between.
Figure B.2.1.4-1: Cascade of components
The combined mismatch uncertainty is given by the root sum square of the
individual contributions:
In an optimized test procedure, the overall mismatch uncertainty is smaller
when matching pairs of mismatches exist in the calibration and measurement
stage since these pairs cancel each other out. Figure B.2.1.4-2 displays a
calibration setup, where device D is replaced by device F. The mismatch
contributions for this path are AB, BC, CE, ABC, BCE and ABCE. For a result
based on the measurement and calibration stage, the mismatch contributions AB,
BC, and ABC are matching pairs as they occur both in the measurement and
calibration stage. Thus, they can be eliminated [11], and the system mismatch
uncertainty is obtained as
Figure B.2.1.4-2: Sketch of a calibration path
In the following, an example mismatch uncertainty calculation for a TX/RX
patch from the measurement equipment to the measurement antenna is performed
for a frequency of 43.5GHz. The example path under investigation consists of
four SPDT switches, one SP6T switch and one DPDT switch and microwave cable
interconnects with PC2.4 mm connectors. The attenuation and reflectance of
typical components suitable for frequencies ranging up to 43.5 GHz have been
considered in the calculation of the mismatch uncertainty.
Figure B1.1.4.4-3 shows a sample system setup for an EIRP/EIS test case with
rather simple complexity of the switch box similar to a current sub 6GHz test
setup. It should be noted that the switch unit is significantly less complex
than a state-of-the-art switch unit currently used for conformance tests.

The calculation of the overall mismatch uncertainty for a frequency of 43.5
GHz results in a value of 2.7 dB for the standard deviation, i.e., the
expanded uncertainty is 5.3 dB.
Figure B.2.1.4-4 depicts a possible calibration for a part of the setup.
Figure B.2.1.4-4: Block Diagram of the calibration stage
For the VNA a return loss of 30 dB is assumed after a full two-port
calibration. The calculation of the system mismatch uncertainty applying the
elimination of matching pairs results in a value of 1.0 dB (standard
deviation) with an expanded value of 1.9 dB.
Since the overall mismatch uncertainty value is already a standard deviation,
which is RSS of values divided by the divisor (√2), the overall mismatch
uncertainty value should be divided by actual divisor 1 when calculating total
mismatch.
### B.2.1.5 Standing Wave Between the DUT and measurement antenna
This uncertainty term is related to the amplitude ripple coming from the
standing waves between the DUT and measurement antenna. If this term is not
considered to be negligible one method to obtain this value is to slide the
DUT lambda/4 towards the measurement antenna while measuring the amplitude.
The uncertainty term can be derived by performing the standard deviation on
the results.
### B.2.1.6 Uncertainty of the RF power measurement equipment
The receiving device is used to measure the received signal level in the EIRP
tests as an absolute level. These receiving devices are spectrum analysers,
communication analysers, or power meters. The uncertainty value will be
indicated in the manufacturer\'s data sheet. It needs to be ensured that
appropriate manufacturer\'s uncertainty contributions are specified for the
settings used such as bandwidth and absolute level. If a power meter is used
zero offset, zero drift and measurement noise need to be included.
### B.2.1.7 Phase curvature
This contribution originates from the finite far field measurement distance,
which causes phase curvature across the antenna of UE/reference antenna. At a
measurement distance of 2D^2^/lambda the phase curvature is 22.5 degrees. The
impact of this factor shall be assessed during final MU definition for the
test method.
### B.2.1.8 Amplifier uncertainties
Any components in the setup can potentially introduce measurement uncertainty.
It is then needed to determine the uncertainty contributors associated with
the use of such components. For the case of external amplifiers, the following
uncertainties should be considered but the applicability is contingent to the
measurement implementation and calibration procedure.
\- Stability
\- An uncertainty contribution comes from the output level stability of the
amplifier. Even if the amplifier is part of the system for both measurement
and calibration, the uncertainty due to the stability shall be considered.
This uncertainty can be either measured or determined by the manufacturers'
data sheet for the operating conditions in which the system will be required
to operate.
\- Linearity
\- An uncertainty contribution comes from the linearity of the amplifier since
in most cases calibration and measurements are performed at two different
input/output power levels. This uncertainty can be either measured or
determined by the manufacturers' data sheet.
\- Noise Figure
\- When the signal goes into an amplifier, noise is added so that the SNR at
the output is reduced with regard to the SNR of the signal at the input. This
added noise introduces error on the signal which affects the Error Rate of the
receiver thus the EVM (Error Vector Magnitude). An uncertainty can be
calculated through the following formula:
\- Where SNR is the signal to noise ratio in dB at the signal level used
during the sensitivity measurement.
\- Mismatch
\- If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be considered
systematic and constant -> 0dB. If it is not the case, the mismatch
uncertainty at its input and output shall be either measured or determined by
the method described in [12].
\- Gain
\- If the external amplifier is used for both stages, measurement and
calibration the uncertainty contribution associated with it can be considered
systematic and constant -> 0dB. If it is not the case, this uncertainty shall
be considered.
### B.2.1.9 Random uncertainty
This contribution is used to account for all the unknown, unquantifiable, etc.
uncertainties associated with the measurements.
Random uncertainty MU contributions are normally distributed.
The random uncertainty term, by definition, cannot be measured, or even
isolated completely. However, past system definitions provide an empirical
basis for a value. Current LTE SISO OTA measurements have random uncertainty
contributions of \~0.2dB. A value of 0.5dB is suggested due to increased
sensitivity to random effects in more complex, higher frequency NR test
systems.
### B.2.1.10 Influence of the XPD
This factor takes into account the uncertainty caused due to the finite cross
polar discrimination (XPD) between the two polarization ports of the
measurement probe. The XPD of the probe antenna shall be take into account
during final MU definition for the test method.
A typical probe antenna can have XPD of 30dB.
A transmission matrix and calibration setup as shown in Figure B.2.1.10-1 is
considered here. Typically, a single-polarized reference antenna with known
gain is placed at the centre of the quiet zone and the total attenuation, L,
between the reference antenna terminal and the feed antenna terminals is
determined as part of the range reference calibration procedure.
Figure B.2.1.10-1: Calibration Setup
Since the reference antenna is considered a single-polarized antenna, the XPD
effect is negligible. Since the measurement probe is assumed to be a dual-
linearly polarized antenna, leakage from one terminal/polarization to the
other, i.e., XPD, needs to be considered.
The dual-linearly polarized measurement probe has two terminals corresponding
to a set of orthogonal polarizations, θ and φ which match the orientations of
the reference antenna. The most thorough calibration procedure would determine
the path losses between the four different combinations of signal paths: θθ,
θφ, φθ, and φφ, e.g., the power received by the measurement probe at the θ
polarization/terminal, P~Feed,θ~, is attenuated by L~φθ~ with respect to the
power delivered to the reference antenna oriented in the φ polarization and
placed in the centre of quiet zone, P~QZ,φ~.
The most common calibration approach, however, is based on calibrating the
polarization matched paths in Figure B.2.1.10-1 (thick solid lines), i.e., θθ
and φφ. In this case, as illustrated in Figure B.2.1.10-2, the normalized
pathlosses L~θθ~ and L~φφ~ are 1 and the pathlosses of the crossed components
become the XPD terms of the measurement probe:
(1.1)
and
(1.2)
Figure B.2.1.10-2: Common calibration approach based on calibrating the
polarization matched signal paths
In the remainder of this analysis, it is assumed that the leakage between the
two polarization ports of the measurement probe is assumed to be the same,
i.e., XPD = XPD~θφ~ = XPD~φθ~ and α = α~θφ~ = α~φθ~.
The normalized powers at the measurement probe terminals can then be written
as
(1.3)
(1.4)
The normalized ratio of total powers at measurement probe and the centre of
the quiet zone is therefore
(1.5)
This simple analysis shows that the XPD of the measurement probe introduces a
small error of the total power measured by the measurement probe and that the
conservation of [measured]{.underline} powers is not guaranteed, i.e., the MU
based on the XPD can be expressed as
(1.6)
This XPD MU is tabulated for different levels of XPD in Table B.2.1.10-1.
Table B.2.1.10-1: XPD MU for different XPD values

* * *
-20 0.043 -25 0.014 -30 0.004 -35 0.001 -40 0.000
When the range reference calibration is based on a full matrix-based approach,
i.e., all signal paths are calibrated, the conservation of measured powers is
guaranteed. As shown in Figure B.2.1.10-3, the polarization-matched signal
paths take into account the leakage of power into the cross paths.
Figure B.2.1.10-3: Calibration approach based on calibrating all signal paths
The powers at the measurement probe can now be written as
(1.7)
(1.8)
The normalized ratio of total powers at measurement probe and the centre of
the quiet zone is then
(1.9)
This simple analysis now shows that for a matrix-based calibration of all
signal paths the XPD of the measurement probe no longer introduces any error
and that the conservation of [measured]{.underline} powers is guaranteed,
i.e., the MU based on the XPD is 0dB.
The derivation of the XPD MU based on powers is a more straightforward and
less complex approach than with electric fields as attempted in [2]. This
annex shows that the same XPU MU result as derived in (1.5) can be derived
using electric fields.
The corresponding signal paths are illustrated in Figure B.2.1.10-4.
Figure B.2.1.10-4: Signal paths for electric fields (based on calibrating the
polarization matched signal paths)
The normalized fields at the measurement probe terminals can then be written
as
(1.10)
(1.11)
The transmission matrix can be defined as H
(1.12)
(1.13)
The total magnitude component of the electric field including
coherence/interference terms at the probe is
(1.14)
When it is assumed that leakage between the two polarization ports of the
measurement probe is assumed to be the same, then _a=c=_ 10^XPD/20^ in (1.14).
Additionally, it has to be assumed that _d_ =_b_ +π which guarantees the
orthogonality between the two field vectors, i.e., the dot product between the
vectors has to be zero. With these assumptions, Equation (1.14) will become
(1.15)
The normalized ratio of total powers at measurement probe and the centre of
the quiet zone is therefore
(1.16)
The derived XPD MU based on electric fields which included the
coherence/interference terms in (1.16) is the same as in (1.6).
The XPD of the measurement system shall be determined from the quality of
quiet zone measurements, see clause O.2 of [7], at the 7 reference points, P1
through P7, specifically with reference AUT orientations γ=β=0^o^ for
distributed axes systems, Section O.2.6.1 [7], or reference AUT orientations
β=α=0^o^ for combined-axes systems, Section O.2.6.2 [7]. Alternatively, it can
be determined using a reference antenna optimized for XPD measurements and
with the corresponding alignment to achieve optimal polarization matching
between the reference and the measurement antenna.
The XPD for each reference point shall be calculated as the ratio of cross-
polarized to co-polarized measured powers and the largest XPD from the 7
different reference points shall be used to determine the XPD MU, i.e.,
(1-17)
where
(1-18)
### B.2.1.11 Insertion loss Variation
This uncertainty contribution comes from introducing an additional cable which
is not present for both the calibration and DUT measurement. If the cables
remain the same for the calibration and DUT measurement, then the contribution
should be set to zero.
If an additional cable is added for one part of the test, the insertion loss
must be accounted for in the measurement results. If the insertion loss is
measured the uncertainty contribution will be the combined uncertainty related
to the insertion loss measurement. The insertion loss can also be taken from
the datasheet and assumed to have a rectangular distribution.
### B.2.1.12 RF leakage (from measurement antenna to receiver/transmitter)
This contribution denotes noise leaking in to connector and cable(s) between
measurement antenna and receiving/transmitting equipment. The contribution
also includes the noise leakage between the connector and cable(s) between
reference antenna and transmitting equipment for the calibration phase. This
uncertainty contributor is contained in the contributor quality of quiet zone
described in clause B.2.1.3 and its value therefore is set to zero.
### B.2.1.13 Misalignment of positioning System
This contribution originates from uncertainty in sliding position and turn
table angle/tilt accuracy. If the calibration antenna is aligned to the beam
peak this contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
### B.2.1.14 Uncertainty of the Network Analyzer
This contribution originates from all uncertainties involved transmission
magnitude measurement with a network analyser, for example: drift, frequency
flatness, temperature variation from kit calibration to path losses
measurement as well as interpolation of calibration data if test frequencies
were not calibrated during path loss characterization. The uncertainty value
will be indicated in the manufacturer\'s data sheet. It needs to be ensured
that appropriate manufacturer\'s uncertainty contribution is specified for the
absolute levels measured.
When an end-to-end system calibration approach is used, the absolute levels
are related to the total system losses of the measurement path. When a split
calibration approach is used, separate MU contributions need to be determined
\- u_cond: transmission magnitude uncertainty for the conducted portion of the
calibration; the absolute levels are related to the total system losses for
the portion of the system calibrated
\- u_rad: transmission magnitude uncertainty for the radiated portion of the
calibration; the absolute levels are related to the total system losses for
the portion of the system calibrated
The total MU of the network analyser for the split calibration is the RSS'ed
value of u_cond and u_rad.
### B.2.1.15 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the calibration antenna
The calibration antenna only appears in Stage 2. Therefore, the gain
uncertainty has to be taken into account. This uncertainty will come from a
calibration report with traceability to a National Metrology Institute with
measurement uncertainty budgets generated following the guidelines outlined in
internationally accepted standards.
### B.2.1.16 Positioning and pointing misalignment between the reference
antenna and the measurement antenna
This contribution originates from reference antenna alignment and pointing
error. In this measurement if the maximum gain direction of the reference
antenna and the transmitting antenna are aligned to each other, this
contribution can be considered negligible and therefore set to zero.
### B.2.1.17 gNB emulator uncertainty
gNB emulator is used to drive a signal to the horn antenna (via multiple
external components such as a switch box, an amplifier and a circulator, etc.)
in sensitivity tests either as an absolute level or as a relative level.
Receiving device used is typically a UE/phablet/tablet/FWA. Generally there
occurs uncertainty contribution from absolute level accuracy, non-linearity
and frequency characteristic of the gNB emulator.
For practical reasons, in a case that a VNA is used as calibration equipment,
gNB emulator is connected to the system after the calibration measurement
(Stage 2) is performed by the VNA. Hence, the uncertainty on the absolute
level of gNB emulator (transmitter device) cannot be assumed as systematic.
This uncertainty should be calculated from the manufacturer's data in logs
with a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise informed. Furthermore, the
uncertainty of the non-linearity is included in the absolute level
uncertainty.
### B.2.1.18 Phase centre offset of calibration
Gain is defined at the phase centre of the antenna. If the phase centre of the
calibration antenna is not aligned at the centre of the set up during the
calibration, then there will be uncertainty related to the measurement
distance.
The phase centre of a horn antenna moves with frequency along the taper length
of the antenna therefore during the calibration the phase centre of all
frequencies will not be aligned with the setup centre. The associated
uncertainty term can be estimated using the following formula [14]:
+/-20log((measurement distance -- d)/measurement distance) [14]
Where d~m~ is the measurement distance and d~p~ is the maximum positional
uncertainty. For a Horn antenna this is equal to 0.5 the length of the taper.
This uncertainty is considered to have a rectangular distribution so the
standard uncertainty is calculated by dividing the uncertainty by √3.
The same equation applies to log periodic antennas with d~m~ being 0.5 the
length of the boom.
For a dipole antenna, given that the phase centre of the antenna is easily
aligned with the centre of the set up the measurement uncertainty is zero.
If the calibration antenna (i.e. horn) is adjusted during the calibration to
align the phase centre to the setup centre then this uncertainty term can be
considered to be zero.
As an example a horn with a taper length of 50 mm, at 43.5 GHz and a
measurement distance of 72.55 cm the uncertainty term is 0.62, with a
rectangular distribution the standard uncertainty is 0.358 dB.
For DFF systems this uncertainty contribution must be included.
### B.2.1.19 Quality of quiet zone for calibration process
During the calibration process the calibration antenna will be placed at the
centre of the quiet zone. Therefore, only point P1 from the procedure outlined
in B.2.1.3 needs to be considered for the quality of the quiet zone validation
measurement.
For gain calibrations, the standard uncertainty of the EIRP results obtained
following the method outlined in 2.10 shall be used. For efficiency
calibrations, the standard uncertainty of the TRP result obtained following
the method outlined in 2.9 shall be used.
### B.2.1.20 Standing wave between reference calibration antenna and
measurement antenna
This term comes from the amplitude ripple caused by the standing waves between
the reference antenna and measurement antenna. This value can be captured by
sliding (lambda/4) the reference antenna towards the measurement antenna as
the standing waves go in and out of phase causing a ripple in amplitude. The
uncertainty term can be derived by performing the standard deviation on the
results.
### B.2.1.21 Influence of the calibration antenna feed cable (Flexing cables,
adapters, attenuators, connector repeatability)
During the calibration measurement a cable (adapters, attenuators) is used to
feed the calibration antenna. This uncertainty captures any influence the
cable may have on the measurements result. This term can be assessed by
repeating measurements while flexing the cables and rotary joints and using
the largest difference between the results as the uncertainty. For some
calibration test configurations this uncertainty can be considered to be zero.
### B.2.1.22 Influence of TRP measurement grid
This contributor describes the uncertainty of the measured TRP value due to
the finite number of measurement grid points.
### B.2.1.23 Influence of beam peak search grid
This contributor describes the uncertainty of absolute TX power beam peak
measurements, e.g., EIRP in beam peak direction, due to the finite number of
measurement points in the beam peak search grid.
### B.2.1.24 Systematic error due to TRP calculation/quadrature
When calculating TRP using different quadrature of constant step size data, a
mean error shall be taken into account. The value of this contributor depends
on the number of measurement grid points and the quadrature technique used.
No mean error has to be taken into account for constant density approach
(using the charged particle or the golden spiral implementation) for non-
sparse antenna arrays.
This measurement uncertainty contributor represents a systematic uncertainty
and must not be root sum squared with contributors described by standard
deviation.
### B.2.1.25 Multiple measurement antenna uncertainty
This contributor describes the uncertainty caused by switching multiple
measurement antennas either by mechanically or electrically to measure TRx
spurious emission.
A frequency range of spurious tests (e.g. general spurious emission) is
defined from 6 GHz to second harmonic of FR2 bands such as 80 GHz. Since that
frequency range is quite wide, it is impossible to cover the whole range only
by one measurement antenna. Therefore to provide a feature of the spurious
emission measurement by FR2 test system, the system has to equip a capability
to switch corresponding measurement antennas in an anechoic chamber. One of
the mechanical antenna switching methods can be a structure of a slider. Then
a repeatability of a bending loss of a feeder cable which is connected to the
measurement antennas shall be taken into account. On the other hand for
electrical antenna switching, since multiple antennas need to be aligned in a
chamber with a different position, the quiet zone characteristics might
receive an influence by a displacement from the ideal focal point. In a case
of electrical switching system, if the measurement antenna configuration is
the same for the quality of the quiet zone measurement and the DUT
measurement, then this uncertainty term is encompassed in the quality of the
quiet zone results.
### B.2.1.26 DUT repositioning
This contributor describes the uncertainty due to a displacement of a DUT. The
DUT may need to be re-positioned between measurements, for instance when the
battery runs low in charge.
### B.2.1.27 Influence of noise
This contributor describes an offset uncertainty factor caused by a noise
floor especially in a case of low SNR. This contributor works as a bias to
measured results only to a direction to increase values and thus this shall be
included in the uncertainty budget table as a systematic uncertainty. The
uncertainty value can be derived by the following equation.
### B.2.1.28 Systematic error related to beam peak search
When calculating beam peak search a systematic error shall be taken into
account. The value of this contributor depends on the number of measurement
grid points.
This measurement uncertainty contributor represents a systematic uncertainty
and must not be root sum squared with contributors described by standard
deviation.
### B.2.1.29 Influence of spherical coverage grid
This contributor describes the uncertainty of spherical measurements, due to
the finite number of measurement points in the spherical coverage grid.
### B.2.1.30 Systematic error related to EIS spherical coverage
When calculating EIS spherical coverage, a mean error shall be taken into
account. The value of this contributor depends on the DL power step size used
for the EIS search and then number of measurement grid points.
This measurement uncertainty contributor represents a systematic uncertainty
and must not be root sum squared with contributors described by standard
deviation.
### B.2.1.31 Misalignment of DUT due to change of DUT orientation
This contributor describes the uncertainty due to a mis-alignment of a DUT
after a change of DUT orientations described in Tables J.2-1 through J.2-3 in
[3] during spurious emission and spherical coverage measurements. This
contribution is negligible with spherical coverage TC as far as the
misalignment is within the accuracy of DUT re-positioning.
### B.2.1.32 Additional Impact of Interferer ACLR
This contribution describes the effect of the interferer ACLR over the wanted
signal channel when testing ACS and in-band blocking. Even if power is set
perfectly in the configured transmission bandwidth, interferer power will leak
in the wanted signal channel due to its ACLR.
### B.2.1.33 Modulated Interferer uncertainty
Modulated Interferer is used to drive a signal to the horn antenna (via
multiple external components such as a switch box, an amplifier and a
circulator, etc.) in ACS and In-band Blocking tests either as an absolute
level or as a relative level. Receiving device used is typically a
UE/phablet/tablet/FWA. Generally, there occurs uncertainty contribution from
absolute level accuracy, non-linearity and frequency characteristic of the
interferer generator.
For practical reasons, in a case that a VNA is used as calibration equipment,
Modulated Interferer is connected to the system after the calibration
measurement (Stage 2) is performed by the VNA. Hence, the uncertainty on the
absolute level of Modulated Interferer (transmitter device) cannot be assumed
as systematic. This uncertainty should be calculated from the manufacturer's
data in logs with a rectangular distribution, unless otherwise informed.
Furthermore, the uncertainty of the non-linearity is included in the absolute
level uncertainty.
### B.2.1.34 Void
### B.2.1.35 Influence of offset antenna for blocker signal
This MU term describes the additional uncertainty caused by using offset
antenna for blocker signal for FR2 blocking test cases. The cause of
additional MU using offset antenna is the difference of UE antenna's gain
between beam peak direction and offset beam peak direction, which will cause
the error for the ACS or IBB performance requirement which is given by the
power ratio of the wanted signal power and blocker signal power. Such
difference of the UE antenna gain can be compensated by increasing the blocker
signal power by the measured EIS difference at beam peak direction and at
offset beam peak. Despite this compensation, there still is a residual error
corresponding to the antenna gain difference due to different frequency of
wanted and blocker signal. Table B.2.1.35-1 summarizes the residual error
after compensation for various offset angle assumption.

### B.2.1.36 Uncertainty of the RF relative power measurement equipment
The receiving device is used to measure the received signal level in the EIRP

communication analysers, or power meters. The uncertainty value will be
indicated in the manufacturer\'s data sheet. Basically, the linearity and
impact of the averaging time needs to be considered in this MU term.

See B.2.1.2.
### B.2.3.3 Quality of the Quiet Zone
See B.2.1.3.
### B.2.3.4 Mismatch
See B.2.1.4.
### B.2.3.5 Multiple Reflections: Coupling Measurement Antenna and DUT
The multiple reflections occur when a portion of the transmitted signal is
reflected form the receiving antenna back to the transmitting antenna and re-
reflected by the transmitting antenna back to the receiving antenna. This
uncertainty can be determined by multiple measurements of the DUT when at
different distance from the probes. This uncertainty is assumed to have a
U-shaped distribution.
### B.2.3.6 Uncertainty of the RF power measurement equipment
See B.2.1.6.
### B.2.3.7 Phase curvature
See B.2.1.7.
### B.2.3.8 Amplifier uncertainties
See B.2.1.8.
### B.2.3.9 Random uncertainty
See B.2.1.9.
### B.2.3.10 Influence of the XPD
Refer to B.2.1.10. If the Probe Polarization Amplitude and Phase is measured
and corrected for then this uncertainty term can be considered to be zero.
### B.2.3.11 NF to FF truncation
The measured near field is expanded using a finite set of spherical modes. The
number of modes is linked to number of samples. The filtering effect generated
by the finite number of modes can improve measurement results by removing
signals from outside the physical area of the DUT. Care must be taken in order
to make sure the removed signals are not from the DUT itself. This term also
includes the uncertainty related to the scan area truncation. This uncertainty
is usually negligible. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal
distribution.
### B.2.3.12 Probe Polarization Amplitude and Phase
The amplitude and phase of the probe polarization coefficients should be
measured. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution.
### B.2.3.13 Probe Array Uniformity (for multi-probe systems only)
This is the uncertainty due to the fact that different probes are used for
each physical position. Different probes have different radiation patterns.
Generally, the probe array is calibrated so that the uniformity of the probes
is achieved. This uncertainty term must be considered if the amplitude and
phase of each probe is not identical or corrected for. This uncertainty is
assumed to have a normal distribution
### B.2.3.14 Uncertainty of the Network Analyzer
See B.2.1.14.
### B.2.3.15 Uncertainty of the absolute gain of the calibration antenna
See B.2.1.15.
### B.2.3.16 Phase Recovery Non-Linearity over signal bandwidth
This uncertainty originates from the non-linearity of the phase recovery for
wide band signal. The phase recovery can be due to either phase non-linearity
of the receiver and/or the DUT itself. The method to quantify the non-
linarites is not defined.
### B.2.3.17 Probe Pattern Effect
The probe/s pattern/s is assumed to be known so that the DUT measurement in
near field can be corrected when performing the near field to far field
transform. If the probe pattern is known, then the uncertainty term is zero.
There is no direct dependence between the DUT pattern and the probe pattern in
near field measurements. This uncertainty is assumed to have a normal
distribution.
### B.2.3.18 Phase centre offset of calibration
See B.2.1.18.
### B.2.3.19 Quality of the Quiet Zone for Calibration Process
See B.2.1.19.
### B.2.3.20 Phase Drift and Noise
This uncertainty is due to the noise level and drift of the test range and
should be determined or measured at the DUT location. The noise level is
usually measured with a Spectrum Analyzer. This uncertainty is assumed to have
a normal distribution.
### B.2.3.21 Mismatch in the connection of the calibration antenna
See B.2.1.4.
### B.2.3.22 Influence of TRP measurement grid
See B.2.1.22.
### B.2.3.23
### B.2.3.24
### B.2.3.25 Leakage and Crosstalk
This uncertainty can be addressed by measurements on the actual system setup.
The leakage and crosstalk cannot be separated from the random amplitude and
phase errors so that the relative importance should be determined. This
uncertainty is assumed to have a normal distribution.
### B.2.3.26 Systematic error due to TRP calculation/quadrature
See B.2.1.24.

Test procedure of general spurious emission comprises 2 stages: coarse TRP
measurement and fine TRP measurement BW. Coarse TRP measurement is introduced
to reduce the measurement time by applying sparser grids and/or wider
measurement BW than fine TRP measurement while having offset dB more stringent
test requirement in order not to cause additional misjudgement risk. For the
frequency ranges for which coarse TRP measurement does not PASS, the
measurement is continued with fine TRP measurement procedure.
Tables B.18-1, B.18-1a, B.18-1b summarizes the MU threshold for fine TRP
measurements for General spurious emissions, spurious emission band UE co-
existence and additional spurious emission, respectively. The origin MU values
for fine TRP measurement for different test setups can be found in following
subclauses.

Test procedure of general spurious emission comprises 2 stages: coarse TRP
measurement and fine TRP measurement BW. Coarse TRP measurement is introduced
to reduce the measurement time by applying sparser grids and/or wider
measurement BW than fine TRP measurement while having offset dB more stringent
test requirement in order not to cause additional misjudgement risk. For the
frequency ranges for which coarse TRP measurement does not PASS, the
measurement is continued with fine TRP measurement procedure.
Table B.25-1 summarizes the MU threshold for fine TRP measurements for General
spurious emissions. The origin MU values for fine TRP measurement for
different test setups can be found in following subclauses.

The uncertainty assessment tables are organized as follows:
\- For the purpose of uncertainty assessment, the radiating antenna aperture
of the DUT is denoted as D
\- The uncertainty assessment has been derived for the case of Quiet Zone size
≤ 30 cm, f = {6 GHz to 80 GHz}, P =Receiver Spurious Core Requirement Level +
Relaxation(For n257, 10.2dB for 6GHz ≤ f \ \- The maximum device size ranges/limits follow the currently defined quiet
> zone sizes, i.e., 20cm, 30cm, 40cm, and 55cm [7], [18]
>
> \- The applicable MTSU follows the max device size, e.g., a max device size
> of 30cm to 40cm yields an MTSU of MTSU~40cm~
>
> \- The applicable MTSU is the same regardless of whether a grey-box or
> black-box approach [7], [18] is selected to simplify the mapping and to
> prevent different test requirements for the same device depending on whether

>
> \- A maximum device size exceeding 55cm but with antenna separations of
