# 4 Background
## 4.1 Justification
Coverage enhancement is a study item led by RAN1 for Rel-17. It has been
identified that uplink channels are the bottleneck in many of the evaluated
scenarios in terms of the coverage achieved. Given a fixed number of antennas
and fixed MCS choices, an improvement in the uplink link budget is only
possible through an increase in the UE's UL power.
The current MPR tables may not fully exploit spectrum shaping of pi/2 BPSK
waveforms. Meaningful reduction in MPR for certain waveforms could be achieved
if UEs exclusively rely on 'strong' shaping. Increase in maximum achievable
power may also be feasible relative to the MPR0 power level. For PC2 devices
MPR1 is the output power level at which the ACLR=31 dBc obtained with a QPSK
full RB DFT-S_OFDM waveform. The output power MPR0 is defined as,
MPR0=MPR1+1dB.
Using precedent in Rel-15 and Rel-16 for high power transmissions, duty cycle
restrictions will help maintain average power levels at 23 dBm for compliance
with SAR requirements.
In this study item, we propose to exploit strong spectrum shaping to realize
UL power gains for pi2BPSK waveforms.
## 4.2 Objective
The objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of increasing the
UE's uplink power in TDD bands for pi/2 BPSK modulation assuming use of
existing UE power classes as indicated per band or band combination. The
objectives are applicable to FR1 TDD bands n34, n39, n40, n41, n77, n78 and
n79.
> 1\. Identify achievable UE Tx power for pi/2 BPSK with the filter studied in

Note: whether or not a new UE power class will be introduced for the
identified achievable UE Tx power for pi/2 BPSK will be decided at the
drafting stage of the following WI.

Based on company results the maximum degradation due to pulse shaping is seen
to be up to 0.87dB for all 3 channel models.
##### 5.3.2 Spectral shaping known to gNB receiver
The [0.335, 1.0, 0.335] spectral shaping filter used in this paper is the most
aggressive 3-tap filter that meets the current spectral flatness requirements
as shown in our paper from RAN4#99e [R4-2109742]. Less aggressive 3-tap
filters are included too. 3-tap filter is implemented in frequency domain due
to lower complexity. Simulation parameters are shown in Table 5.3.2.1 and the
link simulation results for 2-64 PRB bandwidths in Figure 5.3.2.1. Simulation
parameters are according to agreed way forward [R4-2108018].

The Bler curves for different configuration parameters of three-tap filter are
shown is figure 5.6.2.
The frequency domain characteristic curves are shown in figure 5.6.1. It can
be observed that for the more aggressive spectral shape filter, the curve is
narrower in the frequency domain. And it also shows that the correlation
between time-domain data would be greater and the PAPR would be smaller.
Therefore, it is helpful to boost the power of UE output.
However, for the spectral shape filter, the receive demodulation performance
would also be reduced compared with no filter since the FDSS would cause non-
uniform distribution of SNR on each subcarrier and impact the channel
equalization.

Figure 5.6.2: Bler performance of different spectrum shape filters
It can be observed that for all channel model (e.g., TDL-A, TDL-C, TDL-D) and
RBs (2RB and 8RB), for the more aggressive spectral shape filter (e.g., [0.33
1 0.33]), the Bler performance would be worse. In addition, the maximum SNR
difference between no-filter and FDSS filter when the Bler is 10% is about is
1dB.
Observation 2: For all channel model (e.g., TDL-A, TDL-C, TDL-D) and RBs (2RB
and 8RB), for the more aggressive spectral shape filter (e.g., [0.33 1 0.33]),
the Bler performance would be worse.
Observation 3: The maximum SNR difference between no-filter and FDSS filter
when the Bler is 10% is about 1dB.
Based on the above analyse, we can see that it is very necessary to select the
appropriate filter, PAPR performance and Bler performance must be taken into
consideration at the same time.
Observation 4: PAPR performance and Bler performance must be taken into
consideration at the same time for FDSS filter selection.

0.335 is the most aggressive 3-tap filter that meets the current spectral
flatness requirements, less aggressive 3-tap filters are included too (0.2 and
0.28). Triang A is the most aggressive triangular window that meets the
current spectral flatness requirements, and Triang B is a less aggressive
triangular window, with similar frequency shape as the 0.2 3-tap filter.
A subset of the results for the evaluation of the pulse shaping filters from
the transmitter point of view from [3] is shown in the following figures,
where the filter that provides the highest output power is selected for each
allocation configuration.

Conclusions of the simulations (all available results are not included here
due to vast amount of them but they can be found in [3],):
For all the tested channel bandwidth, and allocation configurations, there are
filters that conform to 38.101-1 Rel-16 requirements that offer larger or same
output power than the [1+D] filter when the DMRS are shaped.

#### 6.2 Net gain analysis of combined Tx and Rx impacts
##### 6.2.1 Nokia simulation results for net gain analysis of combined Tx and
Rx impacts (w.r.t 1+D) DMRS not shaped
Note: The LS from RAN to RAN4 [RP-213655] states that both the data and DMRS
should be filtered. The results in this section were generated prior to this
decision and therefore do not conform to the instruction provided in this LS
In order to characterize the filters, it is needed to consider both the
transmitter performance (i.e., the achievable output power) from our paper
[3], and the link level performance obtained in [4]. With that information, it
is possible to compute the net gain with respect to a reference filter as:
$$\text{Net~Gain~}\left\lbrack \text{dB} \right\rbrack = \left(
\text{Pou}t_{\text{Filter~i}} - Pout_{\text{Ref.~filter}} \right) + \left(
SNR10\%_{\text{Ref.~filter}} - SNR10\%_{\text{Filter~i}} \right)\ $$
Where $\text{Pou}t_{\text{Filter~i}}$ is the output power of the filter being
compared against the reference filter, $\text{Pou}t_{\text{Ref.~filter}}$ is
the output power of the reference filter, $SNR10\%_{\text{Ref.~filter}}$ is
the required SNR to achieve 10% BLER of the reference filter, and
$SNR10\%_{\text{Filter~i}}$ is the required SNR to achieve 10% BLER of the
filter being compared against the reference filter.
The following slides show the net gain of the filters with respect to the
[1+D] filter with DMRS not shaped, for pi/2 BPSK considering the transmitter
[3] and link level [4] performance for the following allocations and channels:
2, 4, 8, 16 and 64 PRB
TDL-C 300 ns, TDL-A 30 ns and TDL-D 30 ns
Filters tested:
[-0.2 1 -0.2], [-0.28 1 -0.28], [-0.335 1 -0.335], Triang A [6 14] and Triang
B [6 8]
The tested filters assume that the filter is transparent to the gNB, and the
DMRS are shaped. For the [1+D], matched filter is used in reception.
###### 6.2.1.1 Net gain simulation results for TDL-C300ns
For 2 and 4 PRB, [1+D] without DMRS shaped performs better than all the
filters in center allocations (0.1-0.2 dB better than the 0.2 filter and 0-0.1
dB better than Triang B).
For 8 and 16 PRB, [1+D] without DMRS shaped is never the best for any
allocation. Triang B is the best filter, providing gain for most of the
possible allocations within the channel.
For 64 PRB, in central allocations, the performance is the same as Triang B.
In edge band allocations, the 0.335 filter provides up to 0.9 dB gain.
For small allocation sizes, it must be noted that less aggressive filters
perform better than aggressive filters in central band allocations.
There is not a single best solution for all the evaluated cases. Depending on
the allocation configuration, different filters (i.e., more or less
aggressive) perform differently.

##### 6.2.2 Nokia simulation results for net gain analysis of combined Tx and
Rx impacts (w.r.t [0.2 1 0.2])
The most aggressive filters have up to 0.6-0.8 dB loss with respect to the
less aggressive filters in the small allocations (2, 4, 8 PRB in the
evaluation) and central band allocations. These results suggest that following
the agreements on the WF after RAN4#101e [R4-2120057], and the SI objectives
[RP-213535] (objective 3. c) there is a need for different spectral flatness
requirements for the filters based on the allocation within the channel band.
It would be beneficial to have tighter spectral flatness requirements for
small allocations band to optimize the net gain.
**Observation 1** : The most aggressive filters have up to 0.6-0.8 dB loss
with respect to the less aggressive filters in the small allocations
**Observation 2** : For allocation sizes â‰¤ 16 PRB, less aggressive filters
perform better than aggressive filters in terms of achievable output power and
link performance.
**Observation 3** : There is not a single solution for all the evaluated
cases. Depending on the allocation configuration, different filters (i.e.,
more or less aggressive) perform differently.
**Observation 4:** Based on the previous agreement in RAN4#101bis-e
[R4-2202386], if spectrum flatness requirements are not tightened for small
allocations, net gain cannot be guaranteed.
###### 6.2.2.1 Net gain simulation results for TDL-C300ns
For 2 and 4 PRB, the two less aggressive filters tested (Triang B and 0.2)

possible allocations within the channel, except in the edge allocations, where
more aggressive filters offer gains of up to 1 dB.

### 6.2.3 Intel Tx + Rx link margin analysis
Table 6.2.3.1 provides a summary of link-level simulation assumptions. NR
design assumes that pi/2 BPSK spectral shaping on UE side is performed on both
data and DMRS symbols and, hence, the filtering is transparent to the gNB
receiver. Three filters [0.2 1 0.2], [0.28 1 0.28], and [1+D] were used as
example of least, moderate and most aggressive filtering respectively based on
frequency roll-off. A single PC2 PA was used in the Tx chain and was
calibrated to 1dB MPR for DFT-s-OFDM, QPSK, BW=20MHz, 100RB with 4 dB post PA
loss in order to be comparable with other simulation results in this study
item. TDLC300 and TDLA30 channel models were used for evaluations and SNR @
10% BLER was used as a test metric.

In order to have good comparison between the different filters and channel
models it is necessary to clearly define Net Tx + Rx Gain. One way to evaluate
Tx+Rx link margin is to compare delta of performance with a filter against the
same setup using no filter. This is done in the clause 6.2.3.1 and allows for
comparison in filter performance. However, it is also useful to analyse
absolute performance of the achievable link budget. This is done in clause
6.2.3.2.
#### 6.2.3.1 Tx + Rx combined link margin
In this section we evaluate the Tx + Rx combined link margin delta of using a
filter to no filter. The three pulse shaping filters used are again [0.20 1
0.2], [0.28 1 0.28] and [1+D]. Two different channel models, _TDLC300 and
TDLA30 are used to highlight the effect of the channel on pulse shaping filter
behavior. In the three following figures, simulation results using the pulse
shaping filter are compared with the same exact setup to no pulse shaping
filter and the performance difference is measured in dB. The formula for link
margin delta used was:_
$$\text{Link\ Margin\ delta~}\left\lbrack \text{dB} \right\rbrack = \left(
\text{Tx\ Pou}t_{\text{Filter~i}} - Tx\ Pout_{\text{no~filter}} \right) +
\left( Rx\ SNR10\%_{\text{no~filter}} - Rx\ SNR10\%_{\text{Filter~i}}
\right)$$
_Positive dB represent a combination of higher Tx power and better Rx SNR
whereas negative dB represent lower Tx power and lower SNR. It is noted that
in all cases, adding a pulse shaping filter is done with the performance
tradeoff of slightly lower SNR due to the blind Rx equalization process._

Figure 6.2.3.1.1: Tx + Rx Link Margin filter delta for [0.2 1 0.2]. (a)
TDL-C300ns case, (b) TDL-A30ns case
Figure 6.2.3.1.1 shows the Tx + Rx link margin delta for [0.2 1 0.2]. For this
filter, it can be seen that link margin performance is improved by up to 2.5dB
for all outer RB locations. For inner RB locations, pulse filtering provides
little benefit to Tx performance, yet does reduce Rx performance as the
equalizer must blindly accommodate the filtering. Thus, for the TDL-C300nS
channel model, the RBs mostly represent negative link margin delta of (-0.1dB
to -0.2dB) (blueish shades). For the TDL-A30nS case, there are fewer negative
link margin locations as the Rx equalizer performance is less degraded by this
channel model.

Figure 6.2.3.1.2: Tx + Rx Link Margin filter delta for [0.28 1 0.28]. (a)
TDL-C300ns case, (b) TDL-A30ns case
In Figure 6.2.3.1.2, the Tx + Rx link margin delta for [0.28 1 0.28] is seen.
For this filter, outer RBs achieve slightly higher link margin delta. This is
because the sharper filter improves ACLR for outer RBs compared to the [0.2 1
0.2] case. However, for inner RBs the filtering does not improve the Tx
performance, while the Rx performance is more negatively impacted by the more
aggressive filter. For the TDL-A30nS case, there are fewer negative link
margin locations than for the TDL-C300nS case as the Rx equalizer performance
is less degraded by the channel model.

Figure 6.2.3.1.3: Tx + Rx Link Margin filter delta for [1+D]. (a) TDL-C300ns
case, (b) TDL-A30ns case
In Figure 6.2.3.1.3, the Tx + Rx link margin delta for [1+D] is seen. For this
more aggressive filter, outer RBs achieve link margin delta nearly as high as
the [0.28 1 0.28] case and better than the [0.2 1 0.2] case. This also is
because the sharper filter improves ACLR for outer RBs compared to the [0.2 1
0.2] case. However, for inner RBs, where the filtering does not improve the Tx
performance, this filter shows the lowest Rx performance and has the most
negative link margin delta compared to no filter.
#### 6.2.3.2 Tx + Rx combined link margin (relative to MPR0 and maximum SNR)
In this analysis, we are interested in evaluating the regions of operation on
the 2D MPR figures to understand which operating regions have the highest
combined Tx + Rx link performance. Tx output may range between 23dBm to 28dBm,
Rx SNR for Pi/2BPSK may range from -13 to -5dB and there is also the path
loss. SNR varies with LCRB and tends to be best for large LCRBs and degrade
for small LCRBs. For this analysis, we normalize to zero value for MPR0
(26dBm) Tx power and we normalize Rx SNR for the highest achievable value
(LCRB=50) with no filter. By normalizing the Rx with the largest LCRB case
with no filter which is the best case, we can see the small trade-offs between
filter performance.
$$\text{Link\ Margin\ ~}\left\lbrack \text{dB} \right\rbrack = \left(
\text{Tx\ Pou}t_{\text{Filter~i}} - MPR0\ (26dBm) \right) + \left( Rx\
SNR10\%_{\text{max\ with\ no~filter}} - Rx\ SNR10\%_{\text{Filter~i}}
\right)$$
In the following figures Tx + Rx combined link margin is represented; positive
dB represent better performance in terms of higher Tx power and/or better SNR.

All six of the plots in Figure 6.2.3.2.1 - 6.2.3.2.3 have some common trends.
In all cases the lower 12% of LCRB cases (LCRB _â‰¤_ 6 for CBW=20MHz) have at
least some negative link margins. For these small LCRBs, the degradation in
equalization performance exceeds any gains in Tx output power had by using
Pi/2BPSK.
Observation 1: In all cases simulated, the lower 12% of LCRB cases (LCRB â‰¤ 5
for CBW=20MHz) have at least some negative link margins for the channel models
evaluated.
This is due to fact that small RBs are more easily impacted by sharp fades
from the channel models. It can also be observed that this effect is more
severe for the TLD-C300nS channel model than the TLD-A30nS model.
The largest 12% of LCRBs cases (LCRB â‰¥ 45 for CBW=20MHz) have slightly lower
link performance than the middle LCRBs, but only by 0.5dB to 1.0dB less link
margin. This is due to ACLR/SEM limitation on the Tx side.
Observation 2: The link margin is the highest for a small triangle of middle
LRCBs above and below 12% of the top and bottom edges, and with the peak
values in the centre at LCRB near 40% of LCRBmax.
It is also noted that the left and right edge RBs within 8% of LCRBmax also
have degraded link margin due to ACLR/SEM limitations on the Tx side.
Table 6.2.3.2.1: Selected Link Margin values from the TDL-A30ns case for
comparison

2.9 **[0.28 1 0.28]** 2.6 2.6 2.0 2.7 **[1+D]** 2.5 2.5 1.8 2.6
Next, we compare between the three filters. Table 6.2.3.2.1 shows some
specific values selected from the Figures 6.2.3.2.1 -- 6.2.3.2.3. The first
observation is that there isn't a significant difference in Tx + Rx link
performance between the three filters. There is only 0.3dB difference between
the least aggressive and the most aggressive filter.
For max Link margin the [0.2 1 0.2] filter achieves the highest value. This is
because the Rx equalization is simplest with the flattest, least aggressive
filter.

comparison
{width="6.69375in" height="0.7638888888888888in"}
In Table 6.2.3.2.2, values are shown for each filter for the LCRB = 40 case.
This represents the upper region of the 2D plot. In the table it is seen that
the [0.28 1 0.28] filter has the highest value and the widest region of high
values. This phenomenon can also be seen comparing Figure 6.2.3.2.2 to Figure
6.2.3.2.1, 6.2.3.2.3. The inner triangle region is largest for the [0.28 1
0.28] filter.
Observation 3: The [0.2 1 0.2] filter achieves the highest value for link
margin. However, the [0.28 1 0.28] filter has the largest inner triangle
region of high values, making it the best compromise filter. The overall
difference in performance of different filters is rather limited and as stated
in the updated SI objectives the actual filter design can be transparent to
the network.
In summary, two methods of evaluating Tx + Rx link margin were presented. The
first, Tx + Rx absolute link margin shows the RB regions with highest combined
performance. All of the RBs within the region 12% from top or bottom and 8%
from the edges. The middle aggressive [0.28 1 0.28] filter gives the highest
overall link margin for the widest range of RBs. The second Tx + Rx link
margin delta compares the filter performance. In this case, we see that the
middle aggressive [0.28 1 0.28] filter also gives the highest performance for
outer RB locations. However, for inner RB locations no filter or the least
aggressive [0.2 1 0.2] filter is best for avoiding Rx performance degradation
due to filtering.

##### 6.2.4 Qualcomm Net link margin analysis
The below table shows the average output power above MPR0 observed for various
filter shapes for edge, inner and outer PRB allocations using a DFT-S-OFDM
pi/2 BPSK waveform with pi/2 BPSK DMRS. Results indicate that the output power
above MPR0 increases with the aggressiveness of the shaping filter and this
increase in output power is not limited to less aggressive filters. This table
also gives the delta increase in output power between no filtering i.e. [0 1
0] and a filter with [X 1 X] coefficients where X=0.1, 0.2 and 0.3.
Measurements indicated that the worst-case output power increase above MPR0
for filter coefficients [0.28 0.91 0.28] was 0.9 dB. This difference can be
attributed to a more conservative PA model compared to the actual measured
hardware.

The table below shows the SNR \@0.1 BLER as a function of the #PRBs and the
filter coefficient X for TDLA 30ns. Results indicate that for a given #PRB the
SNR \@0.1BLER changes at most by 0.2 dB as the aggressiveness of the shaping
filter is increased. Results do not show any significant benefit with less
aggressive shaping filter profiles for narrow RBs.

Net gain is defined as:
$$\text{Net~Gain~}\left\lbrack \text{dB} \right\rbrack = \left(
\text{Pou}t_{\text{Filter~i}} - Pout_{\text{Ref.~filter}} \right) + \left(
SNR10\%_{\text{Ref.~filter}} - SNR10\%_{\text{Filter~i}} \right)$$
Taking the reference filter as the no filtering case of [0 1 0] the net gain
can be calculated for all other filter coefficients in comparison to this
reference. The results of this comparison is given below:

Observation 4: Results indicate that the net gain increase is not larger for
less aggressive filters.
Observation 5: Based on results it is seen that the net gain increase is
marginal for all filter shapes
Observation 6: Results indicate that there is no significant net gain increase
for narrow RBs for less aggressive filters.
# 7 SAR mitigation solutions
To guarantee SAR compliance and to reduce strain on the PA it was agreed that
for a 1dB power boost above PC2 the UL duty cycle would be limited to a
maximum value of 25%. It is anticipated that for higher power boosts the
maximum duty cycle would have to be reduced further.
# 8 Feasibility analysis of power enhancement
#### 8.1 Qualcomm results for power enhancement
Investigations were done at f=3450MHz using the parameters given in the
following table.

30 kHz
Each Pi/2 BPSK waveform was filtered using a 3-tap filter given in table 1\.
This filter was selected to give waveforms with PAPRs around 2dB which is was
thought to be a good compromise between achieving higher output power and
limiting excessive filtering of the signal. For each start RB/LCRB combination
the PA output was analyzed for IBE, EVM, ACLR, SEM and output power. The table
below gives the measured results based on one PA sample. The increase in
output power for various pi/2 BPSK waveforms above the PC2 MPR0 power level is
given along with the SEM and IBE margins. The pi/2 BPSK output power is
constrained by practical implementation considerations.

DFT-s-OFDM waveform with Pi/2 BPSK with spectrum shaping using a 2-tap 1+D

Figure 8.3.2: The left figure shows the ACLR for the upper end of the spectrum
and the right figure shows the ACLR fort the lower end of the spectrum.
Observations:
\- For the ACLR limit of 31 dB, we see that the maximum output power of QPSK
CP-OFDM is about 25.5 dBm.
\- For the ACLR limit of 31 dB, we see that the maximum output power of QPSK
DFT-s-OFDM is about 29.2 dBm.
\- For the ACLR limit of 31 dB, we see that the maximum output power of Pi/2
BPSK with 2-tap (1+D) spectrum shaping is about 31.8 dBm.
\- MPR0=30.2 dBm and maximum output power is 31.8 dBm for an ACLR=-31 dB.
Therefore, gain boost =1.6 dB. MPR0 is defined in section 4.1.
#### 8.4 Intel results for power enhancement
The following figures shows the MPR power enhancement for different filtering

Figure 8.4.1: MPR results above MPR0=26dBm for [0.2 1 0.2] filter and [0.28 1
0.28] filter
The MPR power enhancement shown in Figure 8.4.1 shows that highest power
enhancement is for the [0.28 1 0.28] filter. This is because the more
aggressive [0.28 1 0.28] filter reduces ACLR impacts more than less aggressive
filters.

Figure 8.4.2: MPR results above MPR0=26dBm for no filter and [1+D] filter
The MPR power enhancement shown in Figure 8.4.2 shows the MPR for the 'no
filter' case and [1+D]. For the 'no filter' case the output power is lowest in
the outer RBs whereas for the inner most RBs, the output power is the same as
for the other filter cases. For the [1+D] filter, the output power similar to
the [0.28 1 0.28] filter but with slightly lower performance at the edge RBs

Figure 8.4.3: Comparison between filters for MPR using BW = 20MHz, LCRB = 16
In Figure 8.4.3, a horizontal cross section of the previous MPR figures is
compared for the LCRB = 16 within the 2D figures. In addition, MPR curves for
QPSK with no pulse shaping filter and [0.335 1 0.335] filter are shown. In the
inner region the advantage of Pi/2BPSK can be seen over QPSK. Near the outer
edges, the impact of filtering can be seen. The Pi/2QPSK case with no
filtering is only slightly better than QPSK. However all of the cases with
filtering show MPR improvement over the no filtering case. The [0.335 1 0.335]
case is more aggressive than the [0.28 1 0.28] case but shows little MPR
improvement.
Observation 1: For Inner RBs, the MPR is nearly identical for the four filters
considered [0.2 1 0.2], [0.28 1 0.28], [1+D] and [0.335 1 0.335].
Observation 2: For Inner RBs, the MPR for filtered Pi/2BPSK represents 0.8dB
additional power that the UE PA can deliver compared to QPSK.
Observation 3: More aggressive roll-off filters improve UE PA output power for
the RBs near the edge. [0.28 1 0.28] is the least aggressive filter that
yields most of the benefits of filtering.

From the above figures, it can be observed that:
Observation 2: For the majority of the inner region, the power capability is
not affected much by the spectral shaping filters.
Observation 3: Increasing the filter attenuation might boost the power for the
outer region, but the power capability of the inner region, especially the
small RB allocations near the channel edges could be reduced.
Observation 4: The MPR performance difference caused by different spectral
filters is small, no more than around 1 dB.
##### 8.5.2 Optimization of RB regions for MPR specifications
In [R4-2202029] and [R4-2117968], the "V-shaped" lines were reported on the
MPR plots for large CBWs, where a sudden increase of MPR is required. Using
our PA model, we also observe the same phenomenon for large CBWs. For example,
Figure 8.5.2.1 shows the V-shaped lines on the MPR plot for 100MHz CBW.
{width="4.385416666666667in" height="3.3125in"}
Figure 8.5.2.1: MPR for CBW 100MHz SCS 30kHz Pi/2 BPSK DFT-s-OFDM. The
V-shaped lines are shown.
Apart from simulations, the existence of such V-shaped lines were verified by
measurements in [R4-2202029]. It's reasonable to avoid power boosting at those
RB allocations.
So far numerous simulation/measurement results have been provided by various
companies, which are largely captured in the latest TR[TR38.868]. Based on
those results, the following can be observed.
**Observation 2: For the inner centred region, the Tx power can be boosted
with no/moderate filtering, while moderate/aggressive filtering is needed for
other regions.**
**Observation 3: The loss of Rx performance (e.g. Rx SNR\@10%BLER) increases
with the aggressiveness of the filter. More than 1 dB loss was reported for
the aggressive 3-tap filter [0.335, 1, 0.335].**
**Observation 4: The net gain for the inner centred region should be the most
and it diminishes in other regions.**
**Observation 5: The study of power boosting has been focused on small number
of RBs such as 2/4/8/16/64, which are the typical use cases for cell edge
UEs.**
**Based on the above observations, we believe that the** power boost should be
focused on the inner centred region. We tend to support simpler classification
schemes, and the exact definitions of the new regions can be left for the WI
stage to allow more time for refinement as well as verification. An example
scheme is illustrated in Figure 8.5.2.2 below.

#### 8.6 Skyworks results for power enhancement
##### 8.6.1 Power enhancement results1
Measured PA current consumption increase vs consumption at PC2 0dB MPR and
gain compression for 1,2,3 dB boosting above the PC2 0dB MPR reference level
is given in Table 8.6.1.
Table 8.6.1.1: Measured PA current consumption
Boosting level(dB) **1** **2** **3**
* * *
Current consumption increase (mA) 12% 27% 61% Gain compression (dB) 0.0 -0.4
-2.9
PA consumption increases from 12% for 1dB boost to 61% for 3dB boost. Its gain
drops by 2.9dB when operated at 3dB boost.
[From a PMU/PA thermal management perspective:]{.underline}
It may be assumed that 12% current consumption increase could be supported
without impacting current technology. However, at 2dB boost, 27% increase
represents a challenge, and at 3dB boost, it is considered impractical, if not
impossible to support a 61% increase in current consumption and maintain
economy of scale with UEs designed to support PC2. At 3dB boost, it is also
considered impractical to drive the PA at such high levels of compression due
to thermal runaway considerations that may impact the component lifetime and
reliability. We were unable to monitor PA temperature for this measurement
campaign, but as an indication of the severity of the thermal issues, we've
had to attach heatsinks to the PA evaluation board to stabilize the PA
behaviour on one of our test benches. Beyond the thermal issue, a 3dB power
boosting at 3dB gain compression, creates potential reliability issues
(breakdown) but also questions the design robustness against worst-case
process, temperature and voltage (PVT conditions) and becomes very sensitive
to load line design and antenna VSWR.
[From a transceiver perspective:]{.underline}
The tested band n41 PA represents somehow a best-case scenario since the
tested part exhibits a high small signal gain. From an RF transceiver
perspective, band n77 or n79 represents a worst-case scenario since these PA
typically deliver 6dB lower small signal gain than the part tested in this
campaign. Based on gain compression data and if we put aside the PA heavy
compression operation, we estimate that, in order to deliver 3dB boost with
4dB post PA losses, the RF transceiver would have to deliver approximately
+9dBm rms output power level; and this does not consider worst case PVT
corners. At such output levels, the RF transceiver performance and impact on
overall system performance should be carefully evaluated. Note that the PA
gain reported here is for APT PAs and the issue may be exacerbated when
operated in Envelope-Tracking mode. It may also be further problematic for
operation in band n79 where PA small-signal gain may be further reduced.
[From an RF-FE component technology perspective]{.underline}:
As previously mentioned in [4], metrics observed in Table 1 at 3dB boosting
level present two types of challenges for RF-FE components: thermal runway
situations and component reliability. Unstable thermal runaway situations may
occur due to the PA higher current consumption which leads to higher operating
temperatures, which, in turn, may shift the filters cut-off frequencies; which
may increase the filter's insertion loss; which may require driving the PA
further into compression; which may further increase the current consumption
and therefore further increase the device temperature etc. As for component
reliability, we have serious concerns regarding how components directly
interfacing with the antenna ports where the VSWR presented to these
components may result in very high voltages that may lead to component
destruction. In any case for the RF FE components between the PA and the
antenna, the increased power will lead to larger designs and thus impair the
possibility to build on the PC2 ecosystem.
For all these reasons, we consider that 3dB power boosting may not be
sustained and we consider a maximum of 2dB boost at best. For restrictions on
uplink transmission slots, we propose to adopt a restriction of 25% at 2dB
boost above PC2 0dB MPR since this is equivalent to the agreed power-class 3
restriction of 40% at 0.2dB MPR referenced to 26dBm 0dB MPR (Inner RB
allocations Table 6.2.2-1).
Key results are highlighted and mapped onto simulation results reproduced from
[R4-2117473] in Figure 8.6.1.1 and in Figure 8.6.1.2 below for 50MHz CBW,
SCS30kHz. Figure 8.6.1.3 shows the results for 50MHz CBW SCS15kHz. The
simulated V-shaped lines for which simulation data indicates a drop in
boosting levels are highlighted with overlaid orange lines. Power boosting is
explored by varying RB~start~ for allocations with L~CRB~ equal to
1,2,4,20,50,100,120,125,128 RBs for 50MHz SCS30, and with L~CRB~
=1,2,4,20,180,200,216,250,270 for 50MHz SCS15. For each RB allocation, ACLR,
SEM, EVM and IBE is verified for 0,1,2,3 dB boosting above the PC2 0dB MPR
power level. Red boxes and red arrows indicate RB allocations where the SEM
margin suddenly drops. In Figure 8.6.1.1, the blue boxes are used to show the
measured ACLR and SEM margins at L~CRB~ =50RB on each side of the V-shaped
line for 1 and 2dB boost, while in Figure 2 and in Figure 3 they indicate RB
allocations for which up to 2dB boosting may be achieved considering solely
3GPP gating factors, and no practical PA/PMU considerations/limitations.

The measurement results confirm the presence of sudden drops in power boosting
capability as simulated in [R4-2117473, R4-2117968]. For example, Figure
8.6.1.1 shows that at 2dB boost, the worst-case SEM margin for L~CRB~ =50
RB~start~ 15,16,17,20 is approximately 3dB, but at RB~start~ 18 and 19 SEM is
failed by -4.8dB, meaning that for 50RB18 and 50RB19 a maximum of 1dB boost
may be achieved only. Measurements also confirm that for small L~CRB~ (\2dB
The typical 3GPP calibration and the agreed waveform configuration from
[R4-210818] was used. The simulation setup is summarized below:
\- Single Tx with power class 2
\- Calibration: 1dB MPR: DFT-s-OFDM QPSK 20MHz, 100RB with 4 dB post PA loss
\- Carrier Leakage: 28dBc
\- Image: 28dBc
\- CIM3: 60dBc
\- CIM5: 70dBc
\- Modulation: pi/2 BPSK with Rel-16 DMRS
\- Number of DMRS symbols/slot set to 2
Simulations have been conducted for several CBW from 10MHz to 100MHz. Selected
simulation results can be found in the Table 8.7.1.1 with SCS of 30kHz and a
shaping filter with the coefficients [0.28 1 0.28]. The results are displayed
in a quantitative manner. Dark colours indicate large power boost capability
while bright colours imply low to no power enhancement. The assigned dark and
bright colour association was chosen as it simply allows to slightly better
identify the new RB regions compared to the case where the association is
inverted.
With observing Table 8.7.1.1 the aim is to identify features which exist for
all channel bandwidth. Most prominent is the dark patch located in the middle
indicating high power boost. The patch overlaps with the conventional inner
and outer MPR regions. The limiting factor is either EVM/IBE (most likely
belonging to inner allocations), SEM/ACLR (most likely belonging to outer
allocations) or the power limitation of the calibrated PC2 power amplifier.
The second distinct feature consists of a region with low LCRB number located
at the lower and upper third of RB_Start. The intermodulation products are
falling into the mask region and SEM is strongly limiting the power
enhancement. For this region the power boost is very low for small LCRB but
tends to rise with increasing LCRB number. The third feature typically appears
for

channel bandwidth of 50 MHz and above. The locations resemble V-shaped lines
with the root starting at LCRB of one. The lines thickness is typically one or
two adjacent RB_start positions with 30kHz SCS. The lines are created by
intermodulation products falling into the very first SEM bin directly adjacent
to the channel.
In general, the available power boost of an individual RB allocation is
dependent on the applied shaping filter. In most cases this means that with
increasing the aggressiveness of the shaping filter the power boost for
certain RB allocations increases. For example, several allocations with LCRB
sizes above NRB/2 benefit from more aggressive shaping. This can be observed
in table 8.7.1.2 where the power enhancement is displayed for different filter
setups. However, there are certain RB allocations which do not benefit from
applying more aggressive shaping filter. Those are mostly RB allocations with
small number of LCRB located at the lower and upper third of RB_start. This is
due to the intermodulation products falling into the mask region are not
affected by the spectral shaping and the SEM remains a limiting factor.

Observing the behaviour regarding different CBW (Table 8.7.1.1) and the effect
of the shaping filter setup (Table 8.7.1.2) we identified several distinctive
regions. Those regions are mimicked by abstract shapes efficiently covering
the diverse needs of power boosting. The selected shapes can be described by a
certain set of conditions while keeping the complexity in a reasonable range.
The proposed shapes for classifying the different regions are displayed in
figure 8.7.1.1.
{width="4.052083333333333in" height="3.3305555555555557in"}
Fig. 8.7.1.1: Visualizing regions featuring different properties for power
enhancement
The RB allocations with highest power boost are located inside region A3. The
RB regions A1, A2 and A4 include allocations which only feature small boost or
even no boost at all. The V-shaped lines are summarised with A4. Further
region is A5 which shall provide the possibility to define specific MPR for
the top part. The remaining allocations which are not part of A1 to A5 are
considered to belong to A6.
The proposed shapes are chosen to allow efficient coverage while still having
reasonable complexity for setting up the conditions. The goal is to have a
description which fits for all channel bandwidths and subcarrier spacings so
that one set of parameters is sufficient. Table 8.7.1.3 contains the proposed
conditions for each region. The conditions are parameterised to allow easy
tuning to explore different setups. A set of parameters is provided in the
table 8.7.1.4. The parameters have been tested for several channel bandwidths
and subcarrier spacings. The targeted shaping filter coefficients are [0.28 1
0.28].

### 8.7.2 Results for power boost between 1dB to 2dB
We conducted simulations in band n77 and deployed PC2 power amplifier model.
The typical 3GPP calibration and the agreed waveform configuration from
[R4-2108018] was used. The simulation setup is summarized below:
\- Single Tx with power class 2
\- Calibration: 1dB MPR: DFT-s-OFDM QPSK 20MHz, 100RB with 4 dB post PA loss
\- Carrier Leakage: 28dBc
\- Image: 28dBc
\- CIM3: 60dBc
\- CIM5: 70dBc
\- Modulation: pi/2 BPSK with Rel-16 DMRS
\- Number of DMRS symbols/slot set to 2
This contribution proposes one set of RB regions suited for a power boost of
1dB and another set of RB regions for the range 1.5 to 2dB.
Quantitative plots for power backoff are provided in Tables 8.7.2.1 to
8.7.2.3. Please note that the visualization of the plots is optimised for
identifying allocation regions and not for providing data on MPR. Comparing
the plots with those found in our previous contribution [R4-2200443] one can
observe that less RB regions are required. Therefore, the updated proposal
removes unnecessary regions and rescales the remaining regions accordingly.
One benefit of the new proposal is that it offers lower complexity.

are suited for other filter coefficients as well.

#### 9.2 Conclusions
In this SI the power boost capability of 1Tx PC2 PAs were investigated. PC2
PAs for UE handhelds was the primary focus of this work. Investigations
revealed that with existing hardware the output power obtained through
boosting was less than PC1 values. Therefore, it was decided that the PC2 ACLR
requirements need not be modified for this level of boosting in PC2 PAs. If in
the future higher boosting is possible whereby PC1 levels are exceeded, then
the issue of modifying the ACLR values can be revisited.
The concept of 'Net gain' was used to evaluate candidate filter types. It was
agreed that both data and DMRS would be filtered, and that the choice of
filter is up to UE implementation and transparent to the network as it was in
Rel-16. Also, companies agreed to maintain the spectral flatness
specifications established in Rel-16.
Discussions related to modifying the MPRs for boosted PAs either by updating
existing MPR tables or defining new MPR regions was deprioritized in the SI.
It was agreed that regarding maximum power boost for 1Tx PC2 PAs the MPR
relative to 29 dBm should be less than or equal to 2 dB for limited set of RB
allocations and that the UL duty cycle for 1 dB power boost should be limited
to a maximum value of 25%.
It was also decided that power boosting for dual Tx architectures should be
deprioritized in the SI
