# 4 Positioning use cases and requirements
## 4.1 Introduction
This clause summarizes the positioning use cases and requirements defined for
V2X and public safety in 3GPP specifications and input from other
organizations. Sources used in this summary are provided in Annex A for
information.
## 4.2 V2X
In 3GPP specifications, V2X positioning requirements can be found in TS 22.261
[3] and TS 22.186 [4]. TS 22.261 [3] specifies the high accuracy positioning
requirements for the 5G system and these requirements are summarized in its
Clause 7.3.2.2 with a note that these requirements include V2X. Seven
different positioning service levels are defined in Table 7.3.2.2-1 [3] in
terms of the horizontal and vertical accuracy, positioning service
availability, and positioning service latency. TS 22.186 [4] specifies the
relative lateral positioning requirement for general V2X use cases and the
relative longitudinal positioning requirement for the platooning use case in
its Clause 5.1 and 5.2.
5GAA provides positioning requirements for 58 V2X services that were
summarized into three groups [5]; the first group with tens of meters
accuracy, the second with lane level accuracy, and the third with sub-meter
level accuracy. The positioning requirements can be on the 3D/2D coordinates
(absolute position) or on the distance and/or angle (relative position) to a
reference point, e.g. another UE.
SAE AA TC informs that it is necessary to have a 3GPP positioning technology
which supports advanced V2X applications working even in various out-of-
coverage scenarios [6].
It is observed that the positioning requirements in V2X depend on the service
the UE operates. Also, the requirements are applicable to relative and
absolute positioning depending on the use case or the positioning service
level. In terms of the horizontal or lateral/longitudinal accuracy, the
requirements for the absolute position or relative position can be categorised
into three sets as follows by incorporating the requirements from the sources
mentioned above:
\- Set 1: 10 -- 50 m with 68 -- 95 % confidence level. This includes Group 1
in [5] and Service level 1 in [3].
\- Set 2: 1 -- 3 m with 95 -- 99 % confidence level. This includes Group 2 in
[5], Service level 2, 3, 4 in [3].
\- Set 3: 0.1 -- 0.5 m with 95 -- 99 % confidence level. This includes Group 3
in [5], Service level 5, 6, 7 in [3], the requirements in [4].
It is noted that all the three sets are applicable for absolute positioning
and relative positioning.
Requirements for other performance metrics are also defined in a range
depending on the positioning service level in TS 22.261 [3]; 2 -- 3 m
(absolute) or 0.2 m (relative) vertical accuracy, 95 -- 99.9% positioning
service availability, 10 ms -- 1 s positioning service latency.
Positioning service should be provided in indoor, outdoor, tunnel areas. The
UE velocity up to 250 km/h needs to be supported for outdoor and tunnel areas.
As long as the UE operates a V2X use case having the corresponding positioning
requirements, the requirements should be fulfilled when the UE is inside the
network coverage as well as when it is outside the network coverage. The
requirements should be also fulfilled when the GNSS-based positioning is not
available or not accurate enough.
## 4.3 Public safety
Public safety positioning requirements are defined in TS 22.261 [3] and TS
22.280 [7]. TS 22.261 [3] provides numerical positioning requirements for the
\"1st responders\" use case in Table B.1-1 in TS 22.261 [3]; 1 m horizontal
accuracy, 2 m (absolute) or 0.3 m (relative) vertical accuracy, 95 -- 98 %
positioning service availability. TS 22.280 [7] specifies some qualitative
positioning requirements in its Clause 5.11, 6.12, and 7.8. These requirements
are applicable to both relative and absolute positioning.
Positioning service should be provided both in indoor and outdoor areas. As
long as the UE operates a public safety use case having the corresponding
positioning requirements, the requirements should be fulfilled when the UE is
inside the network coverage as well as when it is outside the network
coverage. The requirements should be also fulfilled when the GNSS-based
positioning is not available or not accurate enough.
# 5 Potential deployment and operation scenarios
## 5.1 Network coverage
Three network coverage scenarios can be considered when at least two UEs are
involved in positioning for V2X and public safety use cases. Taking the case
of two UEs as an example, in-coverage scenario refers to the case where both
UEs are inside the network. Partial coverage means that one UE remains inside
the network coverage but the other UE is outside the network coverage. Out-of-
coverage scenario refers to the case where both UEs are outside the network
coverage. A UE may transit between in-coverage, partial coverage and out-of-
coverage scenarios.
There are V2X and public safety use cases that require positioning when there
is no network and no GNSS coverage.
Figures 5.1-1, 5.1-2, and 5.1-3 illustrate the in-coverage, partial coverage
and out-of-coverage scenarios, respectively.

Figure 5.1-3: Out-of-coverage scenario
## 5.2 Radio link
Uu interface (uplink and downlink), PC5 interface (sidelink), and their
combinations can be considered as the radio link for positioning.
Uu interface is available for UEs under in-coverage scenario, and also for UEs
under network coverage in partial coverage scenario, while PC5 interface is
available for UEs under in-coverage, partial coverage, out-of-coverage
scenarios.
A positioning operation can be called a Uu-based solution if it uses only
measurements on Uu interface (i.e., measurements on uplink and/or downlink).
An operation can be called a PC5-based solution if it uses only measurements
on PC5 interface (i.e., measurements on sidelink). An operation can be called
a hybrid solution if it uses measurements on both Uu and PC5 interfaces. In
addition to these RAT-dependent solutions, RAT-independent solutions (e.g.,
GNSS, sensors, etc.) can be used, where various technologies can complement
each other, where it is available and applicable.
The necessary information for positioning and the measurements for positioning
can be sent via Uu and/or PC5 interface.
## 5.3 Position calculation entity
Positioning solutions can be categorized by the entity performing the
positioning estimation. Network-based positioning refers to the solutions
where UE position is calculated by a network node. For this network-based
positioning, the UE may report necessary information to the network for the
calculation. UE-based positioning refers to the solution where UE position is
calculated by a UE.
The type of the position calculation entity does not limit which interface(s)
can be used for the radio link(s) in clause 5.2.
## 5.4 UE types
For V2X use cases, a UE involved in positioning can be installed in a vehicle,
a road side unit, or a device of a vulnerable road user.
A UE in a vehicle or a road side unit can be equipped with a distributed
antenna system where multiple antenna panels of a UE are installed in
different locations. A relevant antenna model for evaluation can be found in
[9].
For public safety use cases, a relevant antenna model for evaluation can be
found in [10].
Different UE types may have different power supply limitations, for example, a
UE used by a vulnerable road user may have limited battery capacity compared
to other types of UE, e.g., a UE installed in a vehicle or a road side unit.
## 5.5 Spectrum
For V2X use case, the ITS-dedicated spectrum can be considered for PC5
interface, and the spectrum licensed to mobile network operators (including
FR2) and the unlicensed spectrum can be considered for both Uu and PC5
interfaces. Note that there is no mechanism corresponding to regulatory
requirements to use unlicensed spectrum in Rel-17 NR sidelink.
For public safety use case, the spectrum licensed to mobile network operators
(including FR2) can be considered for both Uu and PC5 interfaces.
# 6 Conclusions
This technical report summarizes the positioning use cases and requirements
for V2X and public safety use cases. The V2X and PS requirements in this TR
are applicable to absolute and relative positioning. The positioning
requirements in V2X depend on the service the UE operates, and this TR
categorized the requirements into three sets as summarized in Clause 4.
The main aspects of potential deployment and operation scenarios are provided
in Clause 5 including:
\- Network coverage:
\- In-coverage, partial coverage, out of network coverage scenarios
\- When the UE operates a use case having the corresponding positioning
requirements, the requirements should be fulfilled when the UE is inside the
network coverage as well as when it is outside the network coverage.
\- Radio link:
\- Measurements on Uu interface (downlink/uplink), PC5 interface (sidelink)
and their combinations for UE positioning
\- Use of RAT-dependent and RAT-independent solutions
\- Position calculation entity:
\- Network-based and UE-based positioning solutions
\- UE types:
\- V2X: installed in a vehicle, a road-side unit or a device used by a
vulnerable road user, where different UE types may have different UE antenna
configurations and power supply limitations
\- Spectrum:
\- V2X: licensed, unlicensed spectrum for both Uu and PC5 air-interfaces and
ITS for PC5 air-interface. NOTE: There is no mechanism corresponding to
regulatory requirements to use unlicensed spectrum in Rel-17 NR sidelink.
\- Public safety: licensed spectrum for both Uu and PC5 air-interfaces.

mechanisms to provide a TTFF less than 10 s.NOTE 1: In some services, a TTFF
of less than 10s may only be achievable at the expense of a relaxation of some
other performances (e.g. horizontal accuracy may be 1 m or 3 m after 10 s
TTFF, and reach a steady state accuracy of 0,3 m after 30 s)._
_The 5G system shall support a mechanism to determine the UE\'s velocity with

_The 5G system shall support positioning technologies that allow the UE to
operate at Service Level 1 for at least 12 years using less than 1800 mWh of
battery capacity, assuming multiple position updates per hour._
_NOTE 2: This requirement aims energy-efficient positioning technologies
draining a minimal energy on the UE battery. It derives from use cases, such
as asset tracking, with a small form-factor battery representative of an IoT
device. This requirement may translate into an energy consumption for the
UE\'s positioning functions in the order of 20 mJ per fix._

consumption to fulfil higher position update rates than the one above, or
other KPIs than those of Service Level 1 (e.g. more accurate service levels)._
