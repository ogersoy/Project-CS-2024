follows:
\- the F1 interface is open;
\- the F1 interface supports the exchange of signalling information between
the endpoints, in addition the interface supports data transmission to the
respective endpoints;
\- from a logical standpoint, the F1 is a point-to-point interface between the

# 5 Functions of the F1 interface
## 5.1 General
The following clauses describe the functions supported over F1-C and F1-U.
## 5.2 F1-C functions
### 5.2.1 F1 interface management function
The error indication function is used by the gNB-DU or gNB-CU to indicate to
the gNB-CU or gNB-DU that an error has occurred.
The reset function is used to initialize the peer entity after node setup and
after a failure event occurred. This procedure can be used by both the gNB-DU
and the gNB-CU.
The F1 setup function allows to exchange application level data needed for the
gNB-DU and gNB-CU to interoperate correctly on the F1 interface, and exchange
the intended TDD DL-UL configuration originating from the gNB-DU or destined
to the gNB-DU. The F1 setup is initiated by the gNB-DU.
The gNB-CU Configuration Update and gNB-DU Configuration Update functions
allow to update application level configuration data needed between gNB-CU and
gNB-DU to interoperate correctly over the F1 interface, and may activate or
deactivate cells. For cross-link interference mitigation, the gNB-CU may
coordinate the exchange of intended TDD DL-UL configuration by merging,
forwarding and selective forwarding of intended TDD DL-UL configuration(s)
between its gNB-DUs, or between its gNB-DUs and other gNBs, gNB-CUs. With the
gNB-CU Configuration Update function, energy saving with cell
activation/deactivation can be supported as defined in TS 38.300 [8].
The F1 setup and gNB-DU Configuration Update functions allow to inform the
S-NSSAI(s), NSAG(s), CAG ID(s) and NID(s) supported by the gNB-DU.
The F1 setup and gNB-DU Configuration Update functions allow to provide
information on RedCap access configuration at the gNB-DU.
The F1 setup and gNB-CU Configuration Update functions allow to inform the
NID(s) available at the gNB-CU.
The F1 resource coordination function is used to transfer information about
frequency resource sharing between gNB-CU and gNB-DU. In case of split gNB
architecture, the gNB-CU may consolidate the outgoing messages from multiple
gNB-DUs and distribute the incoming messages to the involved gNB-DUs, to
perform resource coordination.
The gNB-DU status indication function allows the gNB-DU to indicate overload
status to gNB-CU. In case of IAB, the IAB-donor-DU or IAB-DU can indicate the
downlink congestion status to the IAB-donor-CU.
The network access rate reduction function is used to indicate to the gNB-DU
that the rate at which UEs are accessing the network need to be reduced.
The F1 removal function is used to remove the interface instance and all
related resources between the gNB-DU and the gNB-CU in a controlled manner.
### 5.2.2 System Information management function
Scheduling of system broadcast information is carried out in the gNB-DU. The
gNB-DU is responsible for transmitting the system information according to the
scheduling parameters available.
The gNB-DU is responsible for the encoding of the NR-MIB message. In case
broadcast of SIB1 and other SIBs is needed, the gNB-DU is responsible for the
encoding of the SIB1 message, SIB10, SIB12, SIB13, SIB14, SIB15, SIB17, SIB18
and SIB20, and the gNB-CU is responsible for the encoding of other SIBs. The
gNB-DU may re-encode SIB9. The gNB-DU is responsible for the generation of the
SystemInformation message.
NOTE: The SIB19 is generated by the gNB-DU.
The gNB-CU is responsible for receiving the positioning assistance information
from LMF, e.g the positioning related SIBs. The gNB-CU transparently sends the
positioning assistance information to the gNB-DU. The gNB-DU is responsible
for broadcasting the positioning assistance information in Positioning SI
message(s).
To support Msg3 based on-demand SI and RRC Dedicated SIB Request as described
in TS 38.331 [11], the gNB-CU can confirm the received SI request from the UE
by including the UE identity, and command the gNB-DU to broadcast the
requested _SystemInformation_ messages including the other SI.
To support UE RRC Positioning SI acquisition mechanism, as described in TS
38.331 [11], the gNB-CU can confirm the received positioning SI request from
the UE by including the UE identity, and command the gNB-DU to broadcast the
requested positioning SI messages.
### 5.2.3 F1 UE context management function
The F1 UE context management function supports the establishment and
modification of the necessary overall UE context.
The establishment of the F1 UE context is initiated by the gNB-CU and accepted
or rejected by the gNB-DU based on admission control criteria (e.g., resource
not available).
The modification of the F1 UE context can be initiated by either gNB-CU or
gNB-DU. The receiving node can accept or reject the modification. The F1 UE
context management function also supports the release of the context
previously established in the gNB-DU. The release of the context is triggered
by the gNB-CU either directly or following a request received from the gNB-DU.
The gNB-CU request the gNB-DU to release the UE Context when the UE enters
RRC_IDLE or RRC_INACTIVE. In case of configured grant small data transmission,
this function allows the gNB-CU to request the gNB-DU to keep part of the UE
context, including at least the lower layer configuration for SDT
DRB(s)/SRB(s), C-RNTI, CS-RNTI, F1AP association, and F1 tunnel information,
when the gNB-CU sends the UE into RRC_INACTIVE state. In case of positioning
when the gNB-CU sends the UE into RRC_INACTIVE state, this function allows the
gNB-CU to request the gNB-DU to keep part of the positioning context,
including the SRS configuration for the UE.
This function can be also used to manage DRBs, SRBs and SL DRBs, i.e.,
establishing, modifying and releasing DRB, SRB and SL DRB resources. The
establishment and modification of DRB, or SL DRB resources are triggered by
the gNB-CU and accepted/rejected by the gNB-DU based on resource reservation
information and QoS information to be provided to the gNB-DU. For each DRB to
be setup or modified, the S-NSSAI may be provided by gNB-CU to the gNB-DU in
the UE Context Setup procedure and the UE Context Modification procedure. In
case of NG-RAN sharing, the gNB-CU includes the serving PLMN ID (for SNPNs the
serving SNPN ID) in the UE Context Setup procedure.
This function is also used to manage a UE\'s configuration with multicast
resources and to provide information about the multicast MRBs which are
established for the multicast MBS Sessions the UE has joined.
For Uu, the mapping between QoS flows and radio bearers is performed by gNB-CU
and the granularity of bearer related management over F1 is radio bearer
level. For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU decides an aggregated DRB QoS profile for each
radio bearer based on received QoS flow profile, and provides both aggregated
DRB QoS profile and QoS flow profile to the gNB-DU, and the gNB-DU either
accepts the request or rejects it with appropriate cause value. With this
function, gNB-DU could also notify gNB-CU whether the QoS for already
established DRBs is not fulfilled any longer or it is fulfilled again. The
function can be also used to inform the gNB-DU the alternative QoS Parameters
Sets when available for a QoS flow. To support packet duplication for intra-
gNB-DU CA as described in TS 38.300 [8], one data radio bearer should be
configured with at least two GTP-U tunnels between gNB-CU and a gNB-DU.
For SL, the mapping between QoS flows and radio bearers is performed by gNB-CU
and the granularity of bearer related management over F1 is radio bearer
level. For NG-RAN, the gNB-CU decides an aggregated SL DRB QoS profile for
each radio bearer based on received QoS flow profile, and provides both
aggregated SL DRB QoS profile and QoS flow profile to the gNB-DU, and the gNB-
DU either accepts the request or rejects it with appropriate cause value.
With this function, gNB-CU requests the gNB-DU to setup or change of the
SpCell (as defined in TS 38.321 [10]) for the UE, and the gNB-DU either
accepts or rejects the request with appropriate cause value. This function
also enables the gNB-DU to inform the gNB-CU of which cell the UE has
successfully accessed during conditional mobility.
With this function, the gNB-CU requests the setup of the SCell(s) at the gNB-
DU side, and the gNB-DU accepts all, some or none of the SCell(s) and replies
to the gNB-CU. The gNB-CU requests the removal of the SCell(s) for the UE.
With this function, the gNB-CU indicates the UL UE AMBR limit to the gNB-DU,
and the gNB-DU enforces the indicated limit.
With this function, the gNB-DU indicates that a bearer, or a UE is inactive or
active. The gNB-CU consolidates all the serving gNB-DUs for the UE and takes
further action.
With this function, the gNB-CU indicates the gNB-DU that the UE context
concerns mobility enhancement operation, and the gNB-DU takes corresponding
actions.
In addition, for IAB-nodes and IAB-donors:
\- The F1 UE context management function is used for managing BH RLC channels,
i.e. establishing, modifying and releasing BH RLC channel resources. The
establishment of BH RLC channels is triggered by the IAB-donor-CU. The
establishment and modification is accepted/rejected by the IAB-node's parent,
based on e.g. resource reservation information and QoS information provided to
the IAB-node's parent.
\- The DRB QoS profile framework is reused for BH RLC channels carrying DRBs.
Prioritization of traffic on the F1-C interface is based on traffic type (e.g.
UE-associated F1AP signalling, non-UE-associated F1AP signalling) and is
enforced in the IAB-donor-DU and in IAB-nodes, considering that the traffic on
the F1-C interface has higher priority than other traffic; in-sequence
delivery over the signaling connection is always ensured.
\- The IAB-donor-CU associates each BH RLC channel carrying control plane
traffic with one of the signaled control plane traffic type values.
For L2 U2N Relay:
\- The F1 UE context management function is used for managing Uu Relay RLC
channels and PC5 Relay RLC channels for L2 U2N relay, i.e. establishing,
modifying and releasing Uu Relay RLC channel and PC5 Relay RLC channel
resources. The establishment of Uu Relay RLC channels and PC5 Relay RLC
channels are triggered by the gNB-CU. The establishment and modification is
accepted/rejected by the gNB-DU based on resource reservation information and
QoS information provided to the gNB-DU. The modification of Uu/PC5 Relay RLC
channels can be triggered by the gNB-CU or the gNB-DU.
\- The gNB-CU determines the QoS for the PC5 Relay RLC channel and the QoS for
the Uu Relay RLC channel based on the received QoS profile for the L2 U2N
Remote UE, and provides the QoS information to the gNB-DU.
\- The gNB-CU configures the gNB-DU about the SRB(s)/DRB(s) to Uu Relay RLC
channel(s) mapping, which is used by the gNB-DU to perform data transfer of L2
U2N Remote UE. The mapping between DRB and Uu Relay RLC channel is configured
at the granularity of GTP-U tunnel.
\- The gNB-CU is responsible for the local ID allocation and update for L2 U2N
Remote UE.
### 5.2.4 RRC message transfer function
This function allows to transfer RRC messages between gNB-CU and gNB-DU. RRC
messages are transferred over F1-C. The gNB-CU is responsible for the encoding
of the dedicated RRC message with assistance information provided by gNB-DU.
This function also allows gNB-DU to report to gNB-CU if the downlink RRC
message has been successfully delivered to UE or not. The function also allows
the gNB-DU to report to the gNB-CU if the accessing UE is a Reduced Capability
UE as defined in TS 38.300 [8]. This function also allows the gNB-DU to
duplicate the downlink RRC message according to the duplication information
provided by gNB-CU.
For IAB-nodes, this function allows to transfer RRC messages for setting up
and configuring the IAB-MT side of the BH RLC channel. These RRC messages are
carried on F1-C between the IAB-donor-CU and the parent IAB-DU, i.e. the gNB-
DU side of the BH RLC channel.
### 5.2.5 Paging function
The gNB-CU is responsible for filtering target cells for paging based on the
UE Radio Capability for Paging.
The gNB-DU is responsible for transmitting the paging information according to
the scheduling parameters provided. The gNB-DU also takes the UE paging
capability into account for paging when provided by the gNB-CU.
The gNB-CU provides paging information to enable the gNB-DU to calculate the
exact PH, if the eDRX is configured, PO and PF. The gNB-CU determines the PA.
The gNB-DU consolidates all the paging records for a particular PH, PO, PF and
PA, and encodes the final RRC message and broadcasts the paging message on the
respective PH, PO, PF in the PA.
The paging function also supports CN controlled subgrouping paging for UE
Power Saving.
### 5.2.6 Warning messages information transfer function
This function allows to cooperate with the warning message transmission
procedures over NG interface. The gNB-CU is responsible for encoding the
warning related SI message and sending it together with other warning related
information for the gNB-DU to broadcast over the radio interface.
### 5.2.7 Remote Interference Management (RIM) message transfer function
This function enables the transfer of Remote Interference Management (RIM)
backhaul messages between the gNB-CU and the gNB-DU. RIM messages are
transferred over F1-C. The gNB-CU acts as a coordinator on behalf of its
affiliated gNB-DUs, by merging the RIM information received from its gNB-DUs
and forwarding the merged information to the target gNBs or gNB-CUs,
transparently via the core network. Similarly, a gNB-CU distributes an
incoming RIM backhaul message to all its concerned gNB-DUs.
### 5.2.8 Trace function
The Trace function provides means to control trace sessions for a UE over F1
interface.
### 5.2.9 Load management function
The load management function allows a gNB-CU to request the reporting of load
measurements to gNB-DU and is used by gNB-DU to report the result of
measurements admitted by gNB-DU.
### 5.2.10 Self-optimisation support function
This function allows the gNB-CU to provide information to the gNB-DU in order
to support self-optimization functionality.
### 5.2.11 Positioning function
This function allows to transfer location management messages between gNB-CU
and gNB-DU. With this function, gNB-CU request TRP information from gNB-DU,
and gNB-DU response to gNB-CU with the TRP information. With this function,
gNB-CU request positioning measurements from gNB-DU, and gNB-DU response to
gNB-CU with the positioning measurements.
The function allows the gNB-CU to
\- transfer the positioning assistance data to gNB-DU. The gNB-DU is
responsible for broadcasting the positioning assistance data according to the
scheduling parameters available.
\- request the gNB-DU to configure SRS transmissions for UE.

\- request the gNB-DU to configure measurement gap or PRS processing window.
\- request the gNB-DU to activate or deactivate preconfigured measurement gap
or PRS processing window.
\- request the gNB-DU to broadcast positioning system information.
### 5.2.12 IAB support function
The support for IAB comprises several functions.
The BAP mapping configuration function allows the IAB-donor-CU to provide BAP
mapping which includes the backhaul routing configuration and/or BH RLC
channel mapping information for IAB-donor-DU or IAB-DU. This function also
enables the IAB-donor-CU to provide the BAP header rewriting configuration, or
other BAP related configurations to the IAB-DU. This function also enables the
IAB-donor-CU to provide the BAP related configurations to the IAB-donor-DU.
The gNB-DU resource configuration function is used by the IAB-donor-CU to
provide cell resource configuration for an IAB-donor-DU or an IAB-DU, and/or
NA resource configuration of a parent node IAB-DU or IAB-donor-DU serving the
co-located IAB-MT for an IAB-DU, and/or information about the child node's
cell resource configuration and other periodic configurations to a parent IAB-
node or an IAB-donor-DU. This function also allows the IAB-donor-CU to provide
the semi-static cell resource configuration of a neighbour node or a peer
parent-node of a child node, whereas this neighbor node or a peer parent can
be an IAB-donor-DU or an IAB-DU.
The IAB TNL address configuration function enables the IAB-donor-CU to request
IP address(es) to be used for IAB-node(s) from an IAB-donor-DU, or to request
from an IAB-donor-DU the removal of IP address(es) used for IAB-node(s). This
function is also used by the IAB-donor-CU to provide an IAB-donor-DU with the
IP address information of the traffic to be transferred to a peer IAB-donor-DU
via an inter-donor-DU tunnel.
The IAB UP configuration update function allows the update of BH information
or the UP TNL information between the IAB-donor-CU and an IAB-DU.
### 5.2.13 NR MBS function
