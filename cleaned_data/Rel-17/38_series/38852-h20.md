In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 7 RF requirements
## 7.1 BS specific requirements
### 7.1.1 General
According to ECC Decision (20)02 [1], the BS RF work for RMR1900 is limited to
the Wide Area Base Stations, determined by the use along railway lines and
their corresponding characteristics defined by 3GPP TS 38.104 [4].
In accordance to ECC Decision 20(02) [1], the related studies were done for
the non-AAS BS architectures, defined in 3GPP TS 38.104 [4]. Therefore the
RAN4 requirements derivation was limited to the BS type 1-C requirements,
only.
As the EIRP limits were defined in the ECC Decision (20)02 [1], consideration
of non-AAS BS architecture required to convert those EIRP limits into the
conducted requirements assuming a maximum antenna gain that can vary depending
on the used antenna and related antenna gain as well as the potential losses,
e.g., feeder. In the present consideration an antenna gain of 18 dBi and 4 dB
losses in accordance to ECC Report 318 [6] resulting to a maximum gain value
of G~maxRMR1900~ = 14 dBi. Other assumptions may lead to other maximum gain
values and conducted requirements. Also, one antenna connector was assumed. If
the BS has more than one antenna connector, the limits shall be re-calculated
considering the intended number of antenna connectors serving a cell.
### 7.1.2 Transmitter characteristics
#### 7.1.2.1 BS maximum output power
Based on ECC Decision (20)02 [1], the BS maximum output power for BS operating
in band n101 applicable for [uncoordinated deployment], should not exceed the
P~rated,c,AC~ derived based on table 4.3.1-1 EIRP limits, with the assumption
of a maximum value of the BS G~maxRMR1900~ , and assuming one antenna
connector,as:
(65 -- G~maxRMR1900~) dBm / 10 MHz = 51 dBm / 10 MHz,
(62 -- GantRMR1900) dBm / 5 MHz = 48 dBm / 5 MHz,
where G~maxRMR1900~ is the maximum gain (antenna gain and losses) of the RMR
1900 BS consideration.
Note: 5 MHz channel bandwidth support was not considered in ECC Decision
(20)02 [1] and was added on request of RMR operators. The above limit for 5
MHz channel bandwidth was then specified based on the limit for 10 MHz,
keeping constant PSD.
#### 7.1.2.2 Unwanted emissions
##### 7.1.2.2.1 General
Only Category B emission requirements are applicable to NR operation in
RMR1900 band.
##### 7.1.2.2.2 Tx spurious emissions
Additional Tx spurious emission requirements are considered for **band n101**
in 3GPP TS 38.104 [4], based on conversion of the EIRP limits from ECC
Decision (20)02 [1], as summarized in table 7.1.2.2.2-1. The requirement is
derived based on table 4.3.1-5, with the assumption of maximum gain value of
the BS G~maxRMR1900~:
Table 7.1.2.2.2-1: Additional Tx spurious emissions requirement derivation for
n101
Spurious frequency range _Basic limit_ _Measurement bandwidth_
* * *
1920 MHz -- 1980 MHz - 43 - GmaxRMR1900 = -57 dBm (NOTE) 5 MHz NOTE: Assuming
a 14dBi maximum gain (antenna gain and losses) for G~maxRMR1900~, and assuming
one antenna connector.
### 7.1.3 Receiver characteristics
RAN4 will not specify requirements related to the CEPT assumptions for BS
enhanced selectivity operating adjacent to band n1 and deployed close by the
corresponding railway infrastructure.
#### 7.1.3.2 Rx blocking
Rx blocking requirements applicable for band n101 in 3GPP TS 38.104 [4], based
on conversion of the EIRP limits from ECC Decision (20)02 [1], are summarized
in table 7.1.3.2-1. Interfering signal characteristic is 5 MHz LTE signal, as
specified in ECC Decision (20)02) [1].

# 8 Performance requirements
The High Speed Train (HST) BS demodulation requirements are to be
transparently applied for the NR operation in the RMR1900 operating band.
# 9 Deployment aspects
In general, network deployment aspects are out of scope of the RAN4 work. For
the derivation of the BS RF requirements it was assumed that the RMR and MFCN
base stations are not co-located, and no coordination is necessary for RMR BS
deployment.
Co-location of a MFCN BS and a RMR BS require coordination among the involved
parties. The use of spectrum and its related conditions, e.g., E.I.R.P, in
accordance to ECC Decision (20)02 Part B [1], are in the responsibility of
national regulation and coordination among involved parties.
# 10 Conclusion
The study dealt with how the 1900-1910MHz spectrum block (RMR1900) can be used
for rail communication using 5G NR applicable in Europe. The subject-areas 5G
NR system, BS RF and UE RF were examined in detail.
General: The focus was on the use of RMR1900 under uncoordinated conditions,
assuming that RMR BS operates independently of other operators e.g. MFCN. Co-
location with other operators and resulting coordination is subject to
national regulation and will be not further detailed by 3GPP RAN4.
System Parameter: The RMR1900 spectrum block can be used by either a 10MHz CBW
or a 5MHz CBW. The corresponding system parameters are to be transferred to
3GPP TS 38.101-1 [2] and 3GPP TS 38.104 [4].
BS RF: The ECC Decision (20)02 [1], i.e. EIRP limits were analysed accordingly
and the necessary conclusions for an uncoordinated operational approach were
derived. These include the BS rated output power using corresponding
assumptions, the resulting emission values of the transmitter and the
specifications of the receiver. The agreed parameters are to be transferred to
3GPP TS 38.104 [4]. Furthermore, the coexistence with other 3GPP radio
technologies has been included. These are to be captured in the corresponding
normative 3GPP technical specifications.
UE RF: The ECC Decision (20)02 [1], i.e. EIRP limits were analysed
accordingly, and the necessary conclusions were derived for the use of Power
Class 3 (23dBm). The agreed parameters in the present TR are to be transferred
to 3GPP TS 38.101-1 [2].
