# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

#### 4.2.2.2 LOS probability
The Line-Of-Sight (LOS) probabilities are given in Table 4.2.2.2-1.

> actual performance because BS has better capability of steering its receive
> antennas to suppress interference.
1 user scheduling is baseline assumption for coexistence evaluation and the
two step ACLR model shown in Table 4.2.6-1 could be used for 3 uplink user
scheduling simulation, where a UE occupies a smaller bandwidth than the
channel bandwidth for transmission, to avoid overly estimating interference,
similar as done in E-UTRA coexistence study (as recorded in TR 36.942).
Table 4.2.6-1: Uplink ACIR value
Frequency offset between aggressor (91RBs) and victim (91RBs) ACIR value
* * *
0 - 90 RBs 30 + X 91 - 181RBs 43 + X > 181RBs 43+ X
Therefore, it is assumed that both ACLR (or the adjacent channel interference)
and ACS are flat in both space and frequency. The ACIR model can be express
as:
(assuming ACLR, ACS and ACIR to be linear).
### 4.2.7 Link level performance for 5G NR coexistence
The throughput of a modem with link adaptation can be approximated by an
attenuated and truncated form of the Shannon bound. (The Shannon bound
represents the maximum theoretical throughput than can be achieved over an
AWGN channel for a given SNIR). The following equations approximate the
throughput over a channel with a given SNIR, when using link adaptation:
$\text{\ Throughput\ }\left( \text{SNIR} \right),\ bps/Hz\ = \left{
\begin{matrix} 0\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ \ for\ SNIR < \ SNIR_{\text{MIN}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } \ \propto \bullet S\left(
\text{SNIR} \right)\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ for\
SNI}R_{\text{MIN}} \leq SNIR < SNIR_{\text{MAX}}\ \ \propto \bullet S\left(
\text{SNI}R_{\text{MAX}} \right)\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ for\ SNIR\ \geq
\ SNIR_{\text{MAX}}\text{\ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ } \
\end{matrix} \right.\ $
Where:
\- S(SNIR) Shannon bound, S(SNIR) =log~2~(1+SNIR) bps/Hz
\- α Attenuation factor, representing implementation losses
\- SNIR~MIN~ Minimum SNIR of the code set, dB
\- SNIR~MAX~ Maximum SNIR of the code set, dB
The parameters α, SNIR~MIN~ and SNIR~MAX~ can be chosen to represent different
modem implementations and link conditions. The parameters proposed in Table

### 4.2.9 Co-existence simulation methodology
Adopt following simulation steps.
1\. Aggressor and victim network are generated.
\- UEs are distributed randomly across the network.
2\. UE associations: UEs are associated to base station based on coupling
loss.
\- Associations are made assuming a single element at BS and UE with isotropic
antenna.
3\. Once association is done, round robin scheduling is used. BF weights are
adjusted to point to the LOS direction between BS-UE. This is done for both
victim and aggressor networks.
4\. Throughput is computed in the victim systems without considering ACI as
below:
\- $\text{Thput}_{\text{NO~ACI}}\left\lbrack \text{bpshz} \right\rbrack =
f\left( \text{SINR}_{\text{ICI}} \right) = f\left( \frac{S}{N +
I_{\text{ICI}}} \right)$, where $I_{\text{ICI}}$ is the inter-cell
interference.
5\. Throughput is computed considering ACI as below:
\- $\text{Thput}_{\text{ACI}}\left\lbrack \text{bpshz} \right\rbrack = f\left(
\text{SINR}_{ICI + ACI} \right) = f\left( \frac{S}{N + I_{\text{ICI}} +
I_{\text{ACI}}} \right)$, where $I_{\text{ACI}}$ is the adjacent channel
interference.
6\. RF parameters are determined based on the degradation cause by ACI as
below:
\- $\text{Los}s_{\text{ACI}} = 1 -
\frac{\text{Thput}_{\text{ACI}}}{\text{Thput}_{\text{SINGLE}}}$.

# 5 General parameters
## 5.1 Duplex mode
For both frequency ranges, even if FDD is not precluded, it's most likely that
TDD should be used in these frequency ranges.
## 5.2 Channel Bandwidth
A pragmatic, simple and non-ambiguous answers should be provided to ITU-R.
While a number of channel bandwidth would be specified for these frequency
ranges, 100 MHz has been considered as a representative channel bandwidth that
will be used.
## 5.3 Signal Bandwidth
The signal bandwidth for a 100 MHz channel bandwidth signal is calculated
based on the NR spectrum utilization for 30 kHz SCS:
Signal bandwidth = NRB x SCS x 12
with N~RB~: Number of Resource block for 100 MHz channel bandwidth and 30kHz
SCS, as specified in TS 38.104 [3].
# 6 BS parameters
## 6.1 Transmitter characteristics
### 6.1.1 Power dynamic range
There is no power control in downlink and fixed power per resource block is
assumed in the co-existence simulation. Hence 0 dB power dynamic range was

### 6.1.2 Spectral mask
Existing FR1 operating band unwanted emission mask is the same as for LTE (5
MHz \~ 20 MHz CBW). For both 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 10.0 - 10.5 GHz band, it is
foreseen the smaller channel bandwidth such as less than 50 MHz CBW is less
attractive. Hence the basic limits for OOB emission mask should be updated as
below. It is agreed that it does not mean that 50 MHz will be the minimum
channel bandwidth when RAN4 specified the channel bandwidth and emission
requirements.

### 6.1.3 ACLR
According to the simulation results in clause 4.3, it is agreed to specify 38
dB ACLR for 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 37 dB ACLR for 10.0 - 10.5 GHz.
For 6425 -- 7125 MHz and 10 - 10.5 GHz, the ACLR should be higher than the
value specified in table 6.1.3‑1.

### 6.1.4 Spurious emissions
From the Rel-15 discussion, the offset Δf~OBUE~ for the boundary between OBUE
and spurious emissions is the most demanding parameters for OTA or Hybrid
limits AAS BS. Based on the implementation evaluation and regulatory
consideration, it is agreed to adopt **Δf** ~OBUE~ = 100 MHz for both 6.425 -
7.125 GHz and 10.0 - 10.5 GHz.
Regarding spurious emission requirements for 6.425 - 7.125 GHz, as this
frequency range is still within FR1 band definition, it is agreed to reuse the
existing spurious emission requirements defined in TS 38.104 [3] and further
update needed are to define upper frequency of Tx spurious emission to be 26
GHz instead of 5^th^ harmonic of DL frequency according to ITU-R SM 329-10 [5]
recommendation. The general spurious emissions for 6.425-7.125 GHz is defined
in Table 6.1.4-1 and Table 6.1.4-3.
Regarding spurious emission requirements for 10-10.5 GHz, according to ERC
74-01 report [6], the lower frequency limit could be defined as 30 MHz.
Without any specified spurious limit for AAS BS in between 6 and 24 GHz in ERC
74-01 [6], in relation to the existing frequency ranges specified, with
observations of the foreseen implementation of AAS BS and how they are to be
deployed and used, the spurious limits specified for above 24 GHz with upper
frequency limited to 26 GHz will be used for 10.0-10.5 GHz as defined in Table
6.1.4-2 and Table 6.1.4-4.

### 6.1.5 Maximum output power
The maximum output power will be provided in the antenna parameter table. It
was agreed to be aligned with antenna characteristics.
The Total Radiated Power for two polarizations was agreed as shown in table
6.1.5-1 below.

## 6.2 Receiver characteristics
### 6.2.1 Noise figure
From the TR 38.820 for 7 - 24 GHz, the typical Noise Figure for a Wide Area BS
operating at 10 GHz is 7 dB (12 dB for Medium Range BS and 15 dB for Local
Area BS).

Example frequency (GHz) Typical NF values for NR BS (dB) Typical NF values for
NR UE (dB)
* * *
10 7 9 15 8 10 20 9 10
For 6.425 - 7.125 GHz, the typical Noise Figure for a Wide Area BS operating
at 7 GHz was agreed to be 6 dB (11 dB for Medium Range BS and 14 dB for Local
Area BS).
### 6.2.2 Sensitivity
As it is not clear if it will have a conducted sensitivity requirement for
both frequency ranges, however the OTA sensitivity requirement will be needed
either way and will be based on the NF and the antenna gain:
$\ \text{EIS}_{\text{REFSENS}} = P_{\text{kT}} + 10*\log_{10}\left( \text{BW}
\right) + NF + IM + SNR - G\ \ \ \ (dBm)$
Where:
\- BW is the configured bandwidth of the FRC,
\- NF is the noise figure,
\- IM is implementation margin not related to antenna array,
\- SNR is the required SNR to reach 95% throughput, and
\- G is the antenna gain including RF losses and 3dB off peak margin.
However, the sensitivity is not a critical parameter for sharing and
compatibility studies. It was agreed to not mention any value for this
parameter.
### 6.2.3 Blocking response
The in-band blocking requirement should apply from F~UL,low~ - Δf~OOB~ to
F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~, excluding the downlink frequency range of the FDD
_operating band_. It is agreed to adopt Δf~OOB~ = 100 MHz for both 6.425 -
7.125 GHz and 10.0 - 10.5 GHz. The in-band blocking levels are reused from
existing FR1 requirements.

and from F~UL,high~ + Δf~OOB~ up to 12750 MHz for FR1 bands. -15 dBm CW
interfering signal is reused for out-of-band blocking for both 6.425-7.125GHz
and 10.0-10.5GHz.
### 6.2.4 ACS
According to the simulation results in clause 4.3, it is agreed to specify 42
dB ACS for 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 40 dB ACLR for 10.0 - 10.5 GHz.

### 7.1.1 Power dynamic range
The minimum controlled output power of the UE is defined as the power in the
channel bandwidth for all transmit bandwidth configurations (resource blocks),
when the power is set to a minimum value. For existing FR1 bands, the minimum
output power is -33 dBm for 100 MHz channel bandwidth. The minimum output
power can be reused for both frequency ranges, 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 10.0 -
10.5 GHz, i.e. power dynamic range is 56 dB for 100 MHz channel bandwidth.

For the last 5 MHz of UE SEM, it is agreed that we might revisit the value
pending MRP definition in WI phase.
### 7.1.3 ACLR
According to the simulation results in clause 4.3, it is agreed to specify 26
dB ACLR for 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 24 dB ACLR for 10.0 - 10.5 GHz.
### 7.1.4 Spurious emissions
The general spurious emissions defined in TS 38.101-1 [4] clause 6.5.3.1 can
apply to both frequency ranges, 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 10.0 - 10.5 GHz.
\- 30 MHz ≤ f ≤ 1 GHz: - 36 dBm / 100 kHz
\- 1 GHz ≤ f ≤ 26 GHz: - 30 dBm / 1 MHz
### 7.1.5 Maximum output power
TR 38.820 indicates that 23 dBm is feasible at 10 - 10.5 GHz and this is an
assumption for co-existence analysis. Hence the UE maximum output power for
the considered frequency ranges could be 23 dBm. Other UE power classes are
not precluded for both frequency ranges, 6.425 - 7.125 GHz and 10.0 - 10.5
GHz.

assumption for co-existence study for 6425 -- 7125 MHz and 10 - 10.5 GHz.
A noise figure in the [9, 13] dB interval was finally agreed for reporting to
ITU WP5D sharing studies. Note that the noise figure value in [9, 13] dB
interval should be used only for WP5D response. The actual noise figure to be
used to define RF requirements should be further studied in the WI phase.
### 7.2.2. Sensitivity
The sensitivity is not a critical parameter for sharing and compatibility
studies. It was agreed to not mention any value for this parameter.
### 7.2.3 Blocking response
The blocking characteristic specified in clause 7.6 of TS 38.101-1 [4] for
frequency larger than 3300 MHz could be applied for 6425 -- 7125 MHz and 10 -
10.5 GHz.
### 7.2.4 ACS

In Table 8.1.2-1, base station array antenna parameters for different
deployment scenarios is listed. Element parameters have been selected to
produce correct element peak gain _determined by calculating the directivity
from a given geometry including beam widths._ The element directivity can be
calculated based on the pattern described by Table 8.1.2-1 in dBi as:
$G_{E,\max} = D_{E,\max} - L_{E}$ (8.1.2-1)
, where the peak directivity _D~E,max~_ is calculated from given values on
_ϕ~3dB,~ θ~3dB,~ d~h~ and d~v~_ as:
$D_{E,\max} = 10\log_{10}\left( \frac{4\pi\left\lbrack A_{\text{lin}}\left(

\pi}^{\pi}{\int_{0}^{\pi}{A_{\text{lin}}\left( \theta,\varphi
\right)\sin\left( \theta \right)d\theta d\varphi}}} \right)$ (8.1.2-2)
, where _A~lin~(θ,ϕ)_ is defined in linear scale as:
$A_{\text{lin}}\left( \theta,\varphi \right) = 10^{\frac{A\left(

Based on the array parameters sets fundamental characteristics such as peak
EIRP can be derived. For radiated power considerations peak Equivalent
Isotropic Radiated Power (EIRP) is calculated in logarithmical scale
calculated as:
$EIRP = P_{\text{tx}} + G_{E,max} + 20\log_{10}\left( \text{MN} \right) +
10\log_{10}\left( P \right)$ (Eq. 8.1.2-4)
, where _P_ , _M_ , _N_ , _P~tx~_ , _G~E,max~_ is given by Table 8.1.2-1.
## 8.2 UE antenna characteristics
The outcome of the RAN4 study for collecting technical background information
relevant for the frequency range 7 to 24 GHz indicated that the frequency
range 7.25-[10-13] GHz would have "FR1 like" requirements, and as such we can
assume that in the 10 - 10.5 GHz range this applies. The UE will most likely
therefore have a conducted interface with an assumed isotropic radiation
pattern antenna and no beamforming.
# 9 Other information relevant for the sharing and compatibility studies
## 9.1 Spatial emission
Traditionally, antenna data sheets provide information on not only the antenna
peak gain in the intended direction but also the gain in unwanted directions.
To describe characteristics in unintended directions the following metrics are
used:
1\. The antenna front-to-back ratio, which is the power ratio of radiative
power in the main beam directions to the power radiated in the backward
direction.
2\. The antenna side lobe ratio, which is the power ratio between the main
beam direction and the power of the strongest side lobe.
However, for an AAS base station it is clear that these traditional metrics of
antenna characteristics are not directly relevant, since an AAS base station
has the ability to adaptively shape the spatial characteristics to maintain
optimum network throughput. Therefore, additional declarations were defined in
TS 38.141-2 [x], Annex G. The additional declarations include information on
how much power is radiated outside the intended coverage region in relation to
the power radiated with in the intended coverage region.
## 9.2 Interference management
### 9.2.0 General
Given an antenna array with _M_ multiplied by _N_ identical elements, the
radiation pattern of the array antenna can be described according to the
pattern multiplication theorem as:
$R\left( \theta,\varphi \right) = R_{E}\left( \theta,\varphi
\right)R_{A}\left( \theta,\varphi \right)$ (Eq. 9.2.0-1)
, where _R~E~_ is the radiation pattern for the array elements and _R~A~_ is
the radiation pattern associated to the array factor. The element patten,
_R~E~(θ,ϕ)_ is based on a parameterized Gaussian shaped element, with floors
to model for side-lobe levels and front-to-back ratio. The element peak gain
is directivity normalized, hence the peak element gain _G~E,max~_ , element
loss _L~E~_ and half power beam widths _θ~3dB~ and ϕ~3dB\ ~_ should be
selected carefully to maintain correct antenna gain, as described in subclause
8.1.2.
It can be noticed that both the element factor and the array factor can be
used to shape the composite radiation pattern. The element pattern can be used
to suppress side-lobe characteristics. For a limited steering range, a sub-
array element can be used to suppress side-lobes better than a single element
configuration. Typically for an AAS base station implementation the element
radiation pattern and the array factor are customized to optimize the coverage
within a specific coverage range for a given deployment scenario.
For a general array antenna, the array factor radiation pattern for
transmitting array antenna with _MN_ element per polarization can be expressed
as:
$R_{A}\left( \theta,\varphi \right) = \left| \sum_{n =
1}^{\text{MN}}{w_{n}e^{j\mathbf{\text{kr}}}} \right|^{2}$ (Eq. 9.2.0-2)
, where
_-_ _w~n~_ is the complex array excitation,
**\- k** is the wave vector of the transmitted wave, and
**\- r** is the element location matrix.
From Eq. 9.2.0-1 it can be noticed that both the element factor and the array
factor can be used to shape the composite radiation pattern, which will be
further described later. The element pattern can be used to suppress side-lobe
characteristics. Typically for an AAS base station implementation the element
radiation pattern and the array factor are customized to optimize the coverage
within a specific coverage range and coexistence with other services for a
given deployment scenario.
For an array antenna with element separation 0.5λ or less the first side-lobe
is the strongest. For uniform amplitude excitation the first side lobe power
level is approximately 13 dB below the main beam power level. For array
antenna with element separation larger than 0.5λ folding effects will create
grating lobes in the side lobe region. The angular location of the grating
lobe is determined by the element separation and steering angle and the power
level of the grating lobes is determined by the element factor. As an example,
in Figure 9.2.0-1, the impact of element separation is visualised for an 8x8
element Uniform Rectangular Array (URA) where the vertical beam steering
directions is set to 130 degrees.

**Figure 9.2.0-1:** Impact of element separation on vertical radiation pattern
The array factor described by Eq. 9.2.0-2 will produce maximum directivity for
the wanted carrier for which the system is calibrated minimizing the
excitation error. For unwanted emission outside the carrier the directivity
will roll-off gradually to a point where the array factor directivity is lost.
The relation between array excitation correlation and directivity can be
modelled as described in TR 37.840, subclause 5.4.4.1.4. The average radiation
pattern for different correlation values is plotted in Figure 9.2.0-2. The
maximum directivity is achieved for correlation equal to 1 and the minimum
directivity equal to the element directivity is achieved for correlation equal
to 0.
{width="2.934768153980752in" height="2.378582677165354in"}
**Figure 9.2.0-2:** Relation between excitation correlation and directivity
To be able to conduct accurate coexistence analysis the unwanted emission
directivity roll-off characteristics is required. The decorrelation effect in
an array antenna will together with traditional filters provide suppression of
unwanted emission EIRP levels required to guarantee coexistence with other
adjacent services.
There is no single general solution available to mitigate all possible
interference situations. Depending on situation one or more mitigation
techniques described in following section can be used to guarantee coexistence
between AAS base stations and other services operating in adjacent spectrum.
### 9.2.1 Beam nulling
Beam nulling technology is used to suppress the unwanted spatial emission by
inserting nulls in the radiation pattern for the direction of the
interference. One typical applicable scenario is multiple beams transmission.
As shown in Figure 2 as one example, Beam 1 is the serving beam of UE 1 but
the side lobe of beam 1 would interfere the UE2. The SINR for UE2 will be
affected. In order to support high order modulation scheme such as DL 256 QAM,
using beam nulling technology, a null can be placed at the direction to UE2
for beam 1. The weight of each antenna array of beam 1 can be obtained by
specific algorithms so that SINR of beam1 is maximized in the direction to UE1
and the transmission power in the main lobe is maintained, and the side lobe
are suppressed in the direction to UE2. Beam nulling can also be used in the
inter-cell or inter system scenarios as long as the location or direction of
the protected station is known.

### 9.2.2 Amplitude weighting/tapering
AAS offer a wide range of opportunities on optimizing the directivity patterns
through amplitude and phase control. High directivity antenna array also has
side lobes which are often undesirable since they may cause intra-cell or
inter-cell interference. Side lobe levels can be reduced via tailoring the
amplitude across the antenna array which is often referred as amplitude
weighting technology. Whilst amplitude weighting/tapering reduces the side
lobes it also makes the main lobe wider and hence reduces gain. It needs
tradeoff between antenna gain and side lobe suppression. For example:
{width="3.029861111111111in" height="2.26875in"}{width="2.9923611111111112in"
height="2.238888888888889in"}
Figure 9.2.2-1: Examples for amplitude weighting/tapering: left: Kaiser (a=3),
right: Chebwin (R=35dB)
Applying tapering electrically for the complete array will results in a main
beam peak EIRP drop due to the amplitude window itself. In addition, the
directivity will also reduce as an effect of a wider beam, as seen in Figure
9.2.2-1.
If tapering is applied at sub-array level the power can be redistributed
between elements in the sub-array, hence no power loss due to tapering will be
introduced.
### 9.2.3 Asymmetric side lobe shaping
In addition to beam tapering, it is possible to manipulate the amplitude and
the phase of the window (for example using modified Taylor series) to modify
the side lobe levels asymmetrically. This technique is widely used with
passive BS arrays to make the ground side lobes larger to fill in the angles
between the main beam and the antenna. The same technique can be used to
minimise radiation in specified unwanted directions. For example:
{width="3.029861111111111in" height="2.26875in"}
Figure 9.2.3-1: Example for modified Taylor window
### 9.2.4 Beam restrictions
Depending on base station implementation and intended deployment scenario
different types of beamforming schemes can be considered. For AAS base
stations operating within FR1 (410 to 7125 MHz) typically codebook or
reciprocity-based beamforming will be used for transmitted down link beams,
while for AAS base stations operating within FR2 (24250 to 52600 MHz)
typically grid of beams beamforming concepts will be used for transmitted
downlink beams. By restricting the angular range for which the beams can be
transmitted, interference power in unintended directions can be limited. For
codebook-based beamforming codes in the codebook associated to large beam
steering angles can be disabled and prohibited from being used for
transmission. The same principle can be adopted for grid of beams systems. For
reciprocity-based beam forming, modification to the applied excitations needs
to be carried out to avoid steering directions associated to generation of
unintended interference in the side lobe region.
By limiting the vertical beam steering range within a certain interval, it is
possible to control the level of the grating lobe to a level similar to other
sidelobes. Not using specific beams with large down tilts angles does not
affect the network performance since, other beams can be used by proving
sufficient power using sidelobes close to the base station. The vertical range
in which the side lobe level is guaranteed will depend on the array antenna
geometry used by a specific base station. As an example (4x8 array, with 3x1
sub-array), in Figure 9.2.4-1 the results of beam restrictions are visualised.
In the left figure all beams are plotted, while in the right figure beams
causing interference towards the sky have been disabled.

**Figure 9.2.4-1:** Controlling interference using beam restrictions
### 9.2.5 Irregular array geometries
Instead of using uniform array geometries where all the elements are assumed
to be equal and the elements are located in a rectangular lattice with given
vertical and horizontal element spacing, irregular array geometries can be
used to suppress unintended radiation in the side lobe region. One example is
when the grating lobe response is suppressed by shifting the columns with a
vertical column offset. The offset can be selected in a way so that the
grating lobe reduces. Instead of concentrating the power in one specific
direction the grating lobe power is spread out in the sidelobe region. The
penalty is that the array antenna aperture size slightly growth compared to
the non-shifted case, as showed in Figure 9.2.5-1. Other examples on irregular
array structures are where different element factor is used for different
locations in the array.
{width="3.085191382327209in" height="2.4804932195975504in"}
**Figure 9.2.5-1:** Offset applied to columns
As an example (4x8 array, 3x1 sub-array), in Figure 9.2.5-2 the vertical
radiation pattern for 0 degrees down tilt (reference direction) and 12 degrees
down tilt (maximum down-tilt direction) is visualized for uniform structure
and irregular structure. For the irregular structure elements columns have
been shifted up and down by an offset vector equal to [0, -0.5, 0, -1, 0, 0.5,
0, 1] wavelengths.
{width="6.268055555555556in" height="2.723611111111111in"}
**Figure 9.2.5-2:** Irregular array geometries
It can be noticed that by applying the offset vector the grating lobe is
spread out spatially suppressing the interference in a specific direction.
