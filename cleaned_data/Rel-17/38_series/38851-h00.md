# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 Inter-band DL CA
## 4.1 Applicability of CBM/IBM for different CA configurations
Following agreements have been reached concerning applicability of CBM/IBM for
different CA configurations.
IBM UE capability is applicable for all CA configurations R4-2016915
On "frequency group" R4-2016915
"frequency group" term shall not be defined in specification
If either CBM or IBM is concluded as infeasible for certain band combinations,
it is reasonable to clearly state in the spec that only the requirements of
feasible BM apply to these band combinations. If both CBM and IBM are
concluded as feasible for certain band combinations, IBM/CBM is up to UE's
capability. R4-2016915
Typical inter-band CA deployment between bands in the same frequency group
cannot be limited to co-located deployments **R4-2007813**
It is agreed that RAN4 will not label CBM or IBM as a default BM method for
any band combination. Used beam management is based on UE capability. This
issue is not discussed anymore in RAN4 R4-2103111
There are no deployment restrictions (Non-co-located/co-located) for network
to configure inter-band DL CA for CBM UEs. R4-2103399
\- UE RF requirements for CBM shall be derived based on co-located deployment
scenario only. R4-2103399
## 4.2 Feasibility study for CA configurations within same frequency group
### 4.2.1 CA configurations within same frequency group using IBM
Following agreements have been made for CA configurations within same
frequency group using IBM.

## 4.3 Feasibility study for CA configurations between different frequency
groups based on CBM
Following agreements have been made for CBM UE for CA configurations between
the frequency groups.
From R4-2103399
> \- CBM: (Common Beam Management) A UE that supports inter-band CA with CBM
> selects its DL Rx beam(s) for all CCs in all configured bands based on DL
> measurements made in the only CC configured with the reference signal for
> beam management. In FR2 CA cases, requirements apply when the BM RS is

### 4.4.3 Reference sensitivity for inter-band CA
The inter-band requirement applies for all active component carriers. The
throughput for each component carrier shall be â‰¥ 95 % of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channels as specified in Annexes
A.2.3.2 of TS 38.101-2 and A.3.3.2 of TS 38.101-2 (with one sided dynamic OCNG
Pattern OP.1 TDD for the DL-signal as described in Annex A.5.2.1) with peak
reference sensitivity for each carrier specified in section 7.3.2 of TS
38.101-2, and relaxation **Î”R~IB,P,n~** applied to peak reference sensitivity
requirement. **Î”R~IB,P,n~** is specified in Table 4.4.3-1. The requirement on
each component carrier shall be met when the power in the component carrier in
the other band is set to its EIS spherical coverage requirement for inter-band
CA specified in sub-clause 4.4.4.
For the combination of intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation, the
intra-band CA relaxation, Î”R~IB~, is also applied according to the clause
7.3A.2.1 and 7.3A.2.2 of TS 38.101-2.

**3.5** **n260** **3.5**
### 4.4.4 EIS spherical coverage for inter-band CA
The inter-band CA requirement applies per operating band, for all active
component carriers with UL assigned to one band and one DL component carrier
per band. The requirement on each component carrier shall be met when the
power in the component carrier in the other band is set to its EIS spherical
coverage requirement for inter-band CA specified in this sub-clause.
The inter-band CA spherical coverage requirement for each power class will be
satisfied if the intersection set of spherical coverage areas exceeds the
common coverage requirement. Intersection set of spherical coverage areas is
defined as a fraction of area of full sphere measured around the UE where both
bands meet their defined individual EIS spherical coverage requirements for
inter-band CA operation. The common coverage requirement is determined as
\ %, where 'percentile rank' is the percentile value in
the specification of spherical coverage for that power class from clause 7.3.4
of TS 38.101-2. The requirement is verified with the test metric of EIS
(Link=Beam peak search grids, Meas=Link angle).
The reference measurement channels and throughput criterion shall be as
specified in clause 7.3A.2.3 of TS 38.101-2. The requirement shall be met for
an uplink transmission using QPSK DFT-s-OFDM waveforms and for uplink
transmission bandwidth less than or equal to that specified in clause 7.3.2 of
TS 38.101-2.
Unless otherwise specified, the minimum requirements for reference sensitivity
shall be verified with the network signalling value NS_200 (Table 6.2.3.1-1 of
TS 38.101-2) configured.
The required spherical coverage EIS for each band in inter-band CA operation
is given in clause 7.3.4 of TS 38.101-2 and modified by Î”R~IB,S,n~. The value
of âˆ†R~IB,S,n~ is defined in Table 4.4.4-1.

### 4.4.5 Other receiver characteristics
For the FR2 inter-band DL CA configurations in Table 4.4.2-1, maximum input
level, ACS, and in-band blocking requirement are band combination agnostic and
the existing requirements in clause 7.4A.3, 7.5A.3, and 7.6A.2.3 of TS
38.101-2 shall be reused.
### 4.4.6 Release independence
Table 4.4.6-1 described the release independence of FR2 inter-band DL CA to be
specified in clause 6.2 of TS 38.307.
