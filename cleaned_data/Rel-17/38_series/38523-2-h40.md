takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[5].
**Implementation Conformance Statement (ICS):** statement made by the supplier
of an implementation or system claimed to conform to a given specification,
stating which capabilities have been implemented

completed for an implementation or system becomes an ICS
**Implementation extra Information for Testing (IXIT):** A statement made by a
supplier or implementer of an UEUT which contains or references all of the
information (in addition to that given in the ICS) related to the UEUT and its
testing environment, which will enable the test laboratory to run an
appropriate test suite against the UEUT

completed for an UEUT becomes an IXIT

related to testing for conformance to a given protocol specification
**Static conformance review** : A review of the extent to which the static
conformance requirements are claimed to be supported by the UEUT, by comparing

# 4 Recommended Test Case Applicability
## 4.0 Introduction
The applicability of each individual test is identified in subclause 4.1. This
is just a recommendation based on the purpose for which the test case was
written.
The applicability of every test is formally expressed by the use of Boolean
expressions that are based on parameters (ICS). The parameters (ICS) included
in TS 38.508-2 [5] are used in the test case applicability condition without
reference. Parameters (ICS) specified in 3GPP TS 36.523-2 [10] and 3GPP TS
34.229-2 [9] shall be referred with proper reference. The parameters (ICS)
shall be set according to the capabilities of the UE on the operating band /
band combination under test.
Additional information related to the Test Case (TC), e.g. affecting its
dynamic behaviour or its execution may be provided as well
The columns in subclause 4.1 have the following meaning:
##### Clause {#clause .H6}
The clause column indicates the clause number in TS 38.523-1 [2] that contains
the test body.
##### Title {#title .H6}
The title column describes the name of the test and contains the clause title
of the clause in TS 38.523-1 [2] that contains the test body.
##### Release {#release .H6}
The release column indicates the earliest release from which the test case is
applicable. In some specific cases it may indicate the release(s) for which
the TC is **only** applicable.
Note: Some exceptions to this interpretation may be indicated in Notes in
column \'Number of TC Executions\'.
##### Applicability - Condition {#applicability---condition .H6}
The following notations are used for the applicability column:
R recommended - the test case is recommended
O optional -- the test case is optional
N/A not applicable - in the given context, the test case is not recommended.
Ci conditional - the test is recommended (\"R\") or not (\"N/A\") depending on
the support of other items. \"i\" is an integer identifying a unique
conditional status expression which is defined immediately following the
table. For nested conditional expressions, the syntax \"IF ... THEN (IF ...
THEN ... ELSE...) ELSE ...\" is used to avoid ambiguities.
NOTE: The conditions are defined in subclause 4.2.
##### Applicability - Comments {#applicability---comments .H6}
This column contains a verbal description of the condition.
##### Additional Information - Specific ICS {#additional-information---
specific-ics .H6}
This column contains the mnemonics of ICS(s) affecting the dynamic behaviour
of the TC.
##### Additional Information - Specific IXIT {#additional-information---
specific-ixit .H6}
This column contains the mnemonics of IXIT(s) affecting the dynamic behaviour
of the TC.
##### Additional Information - Number of TC Executions {#additional-
information---number-of-tc-executions .H6}
This column contains, wherever applicable, the recommended for certification
purposes number of TC executions. It may contain also other information e.g.
exceptions to the release applicable to the test. Clarifying notes are listed
at the end of the same Table.
##### Additional Information - Release other RAT {#additional-information---
release-other-rat .H6}
In regard to a particular test case, this column provides information on the
release which is used by the simulated network in the other (i.e. non 5GS)
RAT(s) where applicable. For each applicable RAT the release shall be
indicated in the format \'Rel-X RAT\'. When multiple RATs are applicable the
entries per RAT shall be separated by a comma. When a value for a 3GPP RAT is
not provided but the RAT is in the scope of the test case then for this RAT
the release indicated in the Release column applies (per default).
Note: Currently for RedCap UEs that set the PICS complying with TS 38.508-2
[5] clause A.4.3.12, Rel-15 test cases and Rel-17 RedCap specific test cases
are applicable. Applicability of other Rel-16 and Rel-17 test cases are under
further study.
