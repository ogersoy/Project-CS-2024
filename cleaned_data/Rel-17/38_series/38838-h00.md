# 4 Introduction
**[XR Applications]{.underline}**
eXtended Reality[(]{.underline}XR) is a term for different types of realities
and refers to all real-and-virtual combined environments and human-machine
interactions generated by computer technology and wearables. It includes
following representative forms and the areas interpolated among them.
\- Augmented Reality (AR)
\- Mixed Reality (MR)
\- Virtual Reality (VR)
XR and Cloud Gaming (CG) are currently one of the most important 5G media
applications under consideration in the industry [2].
**[System Architecture]{.underline}**
One specific aspect to be considered is the role of Edge Computing as a
network architecture to enable XR and Cloud Gaming. Edge Computing is a
concept that enables cloud computing capabilities and service environments to
be deployed close to the cellular network. It promises several benefits such
as lower latency, higher bandwidth, reduced backhaul traffic and prospects for
several new services as indicated in the SA6 Study on application architecture
for enabling Edge Applications (TR 23.758). Edge Applications are expected to
take advantage of the low latencies enabled by 5G and the Edge network
architecture to reduce the end-to-end Application-level latencies. Edge
Computing is a valuable enabler which should be considered to help 5G systems
achieve the required performance to enable XR and Cloud Gaming [2].
**[Traffic Characteristics]{.underline}**
5G NR is designed to support applications demanding high throughput and low
latency in line with the requirements posed by the support of XR and Edge
Computing applications in NR networks. XR and Edge Computing are services
enabled by Rel-15 NR networks [2].
**[Objectives]{.underline}**
The objectives of this study are as follows.
\- Confirm XR and Cloud Gaming applications of interest
\- Identify the traffic model for each application of interest taking outcome
of SA WG4 work as input, including considering different upper layer
assumptions, e.g. rendering latency, codec compression capability etc.
\- Identify evaluation methodology to assess XR and CG performance along with
identification of KPIs of interest for relevant deployment scenarios
\- Once traffic model and evaluation methodologies are agreed, carry out
performance evaluations towards characterization of identified KPIs
# 5 Traffic models
In this clause, we provide the DL and UL traffic models for VR, CG, and AR
applications. Since DL/UL traffic models for these applications share similar
characteristics, we first define a generic and parameterized DL / UL traffic
model, which could be later used in defining VR, CG, AR applications.
The traffic model defined in this clause is statistical traffic model, where
packet size and packet arrival process are characterized by certain random
variables. The described model is based on the input XR traffic study from SA4
[7][3][4].
## 5.1 Generic DL traffic model
### 5.1.1 Single stream DL traffic model
This clause provides a parameterized generic single stream DL traffic model.
In this model, as shown in Figure 5.1-1, the XR DL traffic is modelled as a
sequence of video frames arriving at gNB according to the considered video
frame rates and random jitter. The size of each frame is also random according
to a certain distribution.
{width="5.709027777777778in" height="1.6979166666666667in"}
Figure 5.1.1-1: Single stream DL traffic model
#### 5.1.1.1 Packet Size
In this model, a packet models the set of IP packets belong to the same video
frame. The video frame includes both left and right eye frame sharing the same
buffer, which is referred to as \'single stream for dual eye buffer\' or
\'single eye buffer\' throughout this document.
The size of a packet is determined by the given data rates and frame rates,
which is modelled as a random variable following truncated Gaussian
distribution with following statistical parameters.
Table 5.1.1.1-1: Statistical parameters for packet size following truncated
Gaussian distribution
+-------------------+------+-------------------+-------------------+ | Parameter | unit | Baseline values | Optional values | | | | for evaluation | for evaluation | | | | | for single eye | | | | | buffer | +===================+======+===================+===================+ | Mean: M | byte | R×1e6 / F / 8 | R×1e6 / F / 8 | +-------------------+------+-------------------+-------------------+ | STD | byte | 10.5% of M | 3 % of M | +-------------------+------+-------------------+-------------------+ | Max | byte | 150% of M | 109% of M | +-------------------+------+-------------------+-------------------+ | Min | byte | 50% of M | 91% of M | +-------------------+------+-------------------+-------------------+ | R: data rate of | | | | | the flow in Mbps. | | | | | | | | | | F: frame | | | | | generation rate | | | | | of the flow in | | | | | fps. | | | | | | | | | | Note that the | | | | | mean and STD | | | | | apply before | | | | | truncation | | | | | applies. | | | | | | | | | | Note that the | | | | | value of R, F | | | | | depend on | | | | | application. | | | | +-------------------+------+-------------------+-------------------+
Exploration to other distributions for packet size are left up to each company
and could be reported with the modelling details.
#### 5.1.1.2 Packet arrival
In this model, the packet arrival rate is determined by the frame generation
rate, e.g., 60fps. Accordingly, the average packet arrival periodicity is
given by the inverse of the frame rate, e.g., 16.6667ms = 1/60fps. The
periodic arrival without jitter gives the arrival time at gNB for packet with
index k (=1,2,3....) as
k/F*1000 [ms],
where F is the given frame generation rates (per second).
Note that this periodic packet arrival implicitly assumes fixed delay
contributed from network side including fixed video encoding time, fixed
network transfer delay, etc.
However, in a real system, the varying frame encoding delay and network
transfer time introduces **jitter** in packet arrival time at gNB which. In
this model, the jitter is modelled as a random variable added on top of
periodic arrivals. The jitter follows truncated Gaussian distribution with
following statistical parameters shown in Table 5.1-2.
Table 5.1.1.2-1: Statistical parameters for jitter
Parameter unit Baseline value for evaluation Optional value for evaluation
* * *
Mean ms 0  
STD ms 2  
Truncation range ms [-4, 4] [-5, 5]
Note that the given parameter values and considered frame generation rates (60
or 120 in this model) ensure that packet arrivals are in order (i.e., arrival
time of a next packet is always larger than that of the previous packet).
Thus, the periodic arrival with jitter gives the arrival time for packet with
index k (=1,2,3....) as
offset + k/F*1000 + J [ms],
where F is the given frame generation rates (per second) and J is a random
variable capturing jitter. Note that actual traffic arrival timing of traffic
for each UE could be shifted by the UE specific arbitrary _offset_.
#### 5.1.1.3 Packet delay budget
The latency requirement of XR traffic in RAN side (i.e., air interface) is
modelled as packet delay budget (PDB). The PDB is a limited time budget for a
packet to be transmitted over the air from a gNB to a UE.
For a given packet, the delay of the packet incurred in air interface is
measured from the time that the packet arrives at the gNB to the time that it
is successfully transferred to the UE. If the delay is larger than a given PDB
for the packet, then, the packet is said to violate PDB, otherwise the packet
is said to be successfully delivered.
The value of PDB may vary for different applications and traffic types.
#### 5.1.1.4 Packet success rate requirement
The performance requirement in terms of packet success rate is given as X (%).
If packet delivery delay exceed a given PDB, then, the packet is counted as
failure. Following values for packet success rate X are considered.
Table 5.1.1.4-1: Packet Success Rate Requirement
Parameter unit Baseline values for evaluation Optional values for evaluation
* * *
Packet success rate requirement X for DL single stream \% 99 95, 99.99, etc.
Note that the Packet error rate (PER) in percentage is given as PER = 100 --
X.
#### 5.1.1.5 Dual eye buffer model
This clause describes optional modification of packet size and frame rates for
separate packet arrival for dual-eye buffer.
In single eye buffer model, the frame for both eyes arrive at the same time as
a single packet. Thus, mean packet size M is given as R×1e6 / F, where R is
frame generation rate in Mbps and F is frame generation rate.
Whereas, in dual eye buffer model of data rate R, the left and right eye frame
arrive separately with a time offset, which makes the arrival process
effectively equivalent to have two times of frame rates and half mean packet
size of that of single eye buffer model. Accordingly, we have mean packet size
M of dual eye buffer model is given as R×1e6 / (2×F) for dual eye buffer
model.

+-------------------+------+-------------------+-------------------+ | Parameter | unit | values for | Optional values | | | | evaluation | for evaluation | +===================+======+===================+===================+ | Mean: M | byte | R×1e6 / (2×F) /8 | R×1e6 / (2×F) / 8 | +-------------------+------+-------------------+-------------------+ | STD | byte | 10.5% of M | 4% of M | +-------------------+------+-------------------+-------------------+ | Max | byte | 150% of M | 112% of M | +-------------------+------+-------------------+-------------------+ | Min | byte | 50% of M | 88% of M | +-------------------+------+-------------------+-------------------+ | R: data rate of | | | | | the flow in Mbps | | | | | | | | | | F: frame | | | | | generation rate | | | | | of the flow in | | | | | fps | | | | +-------------------+------+-------------------+-------------------+
### 5.1.2 Multi-streams DL traffic model
This clause provides optional multi-streams model for XR DL traffic.
\- Option 1: I-frame + P-frame
\- Option 1A: slice-based traffic model
\- Option 1B: Group-Of-Picture (GOP) based traffic model
\- Option 2: video + audio/data
\- Option 3: FOV + omnidirectional stream
#### 5.1.2.1 Option 1 (I+P)
For Option 1, two streams (I-stream and P-stream) are modelled according to
Table 5.1-5.
\- Stream 1: I stream
\- Stream 2: P stream
Depending on the video encoding scheme, two additional sub models -- slice
based, and Group of Picture (GOP)-based models are defined.
\- Slice-based: In this encoding scheme, a single video frame is divided into
N slices. Out of N, one slice is I slice and remaining N-1 slices are P
slices. N packets (one I and N-1 P) packets corresponds to one video frame
arriving at the same time.
\- GOP-based: In this encoding scheme, a single video frame is either I frame
or P frame. I frame is transmitted every K frames, where K is the GOP size,
i.e., every group of picture. One video frame arrives at a time as a packet.

In Model 3B, three streams are considered
\- Stream 1: pose/control
\- Traffic model/requirement for stream 1 follows clause 5.2.
\- Stream 2: I-stream for video
\- Stream 3: P-stream for video

Packet Success rate X for I stream \% 99 Other values can be optionally
evaluated. Packet Success rate X for P stream \% 99 Other values can be
optionally evaluated. PDB for I stream ms 30 Other values can be optionally
evaluated. PDB for P stream ms 30 Other values can be optionally evaluated.
Note: For stream 2 and stream 3, the I/P-stream model for DL video can be
reused for UL video. Companies should report detailed assumptions in their
simulations on packet size distribution for each stream, packet arrival
interval (or fps) for each stream, PDB for each stream, PER requirement for
each stream, criteria to be satisfied UE.
# 6 Deployment scenarios
We consider following three different deployment scenarios for XR.
\- Dense Urban (: In this scenario, XR UEs are in urban area where gNBs are
deployed densely with inter site distance (ISD) of 200m. User playing cloud
gaming (CG), users experiencing VR/AR indoor and outdoor are considered. For
FR1, 80/20% of UEs are assumed in indoor/outdoor. For FR2, 100% UEs are
assumed to be outdoor.
\- Indoor Hotspot: In this scenario, only indoor XR users are considered. VR
or CG applications is more likely for indoor for work and gaming. Indoor AR
application is also considered. This applies to both FR1 and FR2.
\- Urban Macro: In this scenario, larger ISD of 500ms is considered, where XR
users are distributed over larger area. Due to large ISD deployment, XR
applications with lower rate would be more relevant to this scenario. Urban
Macro scenario is evaluated for FR1 only.
# 7 XR capacity evaluation
## 7.1 Purpose of study
In this clause, we describe the KPI for capacity evaluations and provide
evaluation results for capacity based on baseline parameters and optional
parameters/modelling methods.
The purpose of capacity study is to understand the performance of NR systems
for XR applications, and identify any issues and performance gaps, which could
be useful for understanding the limitation of current NR systems in supporting
XR applications and the potential directions for future necessary enhancements
to better support XR.
## 7.2 KPI
### 7.2.1 UE satisfaction
A UE is declared as a **satisfied UE** if **all** the considered streams meet
their own PER and PDB requirements, i.e., more than a certain percentage of
packets are successfully transmitted within a given air interface PDB.
Specifically, we have followings depending on the evaluation directions
considered.
\- In DL-only evaluation, only DL streams are considered when identifying UE
satisfaction.
\- In UL-only evaluation, only UL streams are considered when identifying UE
satisfaction**.**
### 7.2.2 System capacity
System capacity is identified as KPI for capacity study, which is defined as
the maximum number of users per cell with at least Y % of UEs being satisfied.
\- Y=90 (baseline) or 95 (optional)
\- Other values of Y can also be evaluated optionally.
For details on how to evaluate capacity, see capacity evaluation clause 7.
## 7.3 Capacity results
This clause is to capture the evaluation results and the corresponding
observations for capacity. The detailed evaluation results can be found in
Annex B.

### 7.3.3 Potential capacity enhancements
There have been no RAN1 discussion on aligning the implementation details of
the proposed enhancement schemes presented in this clause, or aligning the
evaluation methodologies to comprehensively model them. The simulation results
presented in this clause are primarily results from individual sources that
may have certain discrepancies in the details of the proposed enhancement
schemes and/or additional assumptions made for evaluation purposes.
#### 7.3.3.1 Staggering of packet arrivals at gNB among UEs
This clause captures the capacity performance evaluation results of staggering
packet arrival time among UEs.
Compared to the case that all UEs have the same packet arrival time (Zero
offset), the capacity performance is evaluated when the packet arrival times
of UEs are evenly spaced within the multimedia periodicity (Equal offset).
Meanwhile, the capacity performance is also evaluated when the packet arrival
time of UEs is random (Random offset).
a) Random offset: the packet arrival times of UEs are randomly generated.
b) Equal offset: the Traffic arrival offset among different UEs are equal or
the same, which means that the packet arrival times of UEs are evenly spaced
within the multimedia periodicity, i.e. (Evenly Spaced).
c) Zero offset: the interval of packet arrival among UEs are zero, i.e., all
UEs have the same packet arrival time (All synchronized).

#### 7.3.3.4 Cooperative MIMO/precoding via bi-directional training (BiT)
This clause captures the capacity evaluation results of bi-directional
training (BiT) precoding relative to zero-forcing precoding for XR
applications.
Bi-directional Training (BiT) is a spatial-domain interference avoidance
scheme in a TDD Cooperative MIMO system. In BiT, DL interference probing is
performed on uplink sounding resources semi-statically coordinated among gNBs.
On the sounding resources, each gNB triggers SRS transmissions with parameters
associated with corresponding DL transmissions. Then DL interference
mitigation in spatial domain is performed by each gNB for its DL transmissions
based on the interference probing outcome.

#### 7.3.3.5 Network coding (NC)/outer coding (OC)
This clause captures the capacity evaluation results of network/outer coding
for XR applications. The network/outer coding scheme is based on introducing
the NC/OC sublayer below PDCP. PDCP packets are segmented into a suitable
number of sub-packets, network encoded with desirable redundancy, and handed
to RLC, MAC, and PHY layer for OTA transmission. The placement for NC/OC
sublayer is as a part of the RLC layer. In network/outer coding scheme
provides additional redundancy reducing the overall latency of packet
transmission by reducing HARQ retransmissions. In this evaluation, the
baseline scheme is HARQ.

#### 7.3.3.6 gNB scheduling awareness UE playout buffer
This clause captures the evaluation results of gNB Scheduling Awareness UE
Playout Buffer. The XR application layer at UE would have the XR packet
playout buffer to battle the delay jitter and out-of sequence XR packet
arrival. The playout buffer at UE would ensure the in-sequence and time
interval alignment of XR video frames when it plays out to the user. The
proposed scheme is for UE to feedback not only the XR-application type (XR-
application awareness) but also the implemented playout buffer at application
layer to the gNB. In the evaluation, the size of playout buffer is feedback
from UE and known at gNB. Then, gNB can have additional PDB, which could give
gNB more time to schedule UE within the delay budget requirements of the XR
service and more likely to successfully transmit packets with link adaptation
gain. gNB knowing the size of playout buffer can preferentially schedule UE
with packet delay close to deadline and better channel conditions.

awareness UE playout buffer can be summarized as follows.

#### 7.3.3.9 Adaptive inter-UE/intra-UE multiplexing techniques
This clause describes the capacity performance with adaptive inter-UE/intra-UE
multiplexing technique. In the evaluation, enhanced preemption mechanism with
finer granularity preemption area indication is evaluated. For simulation of
XR traffic and uRLLC traffic, uRLLC traffic and XR traffic are considered as
the two types of traffic to be transmitted in the system, where uRLLC traffic
has higher priority (HP) while XR traffic has a relatively low priority (LP).
In simulation of audio/data + video multi stream traffic model, audio/data
streams and video streams are also considered as the two types of streams to
be transmitted in the system, where audio/data streams have higher priority
while video streams have a relatively low priority. Besides, in simulation of
sliced-based multi stream traffic model and single stream video traffic model,
I-slices, P-slices and video streams are considered as the three types of
streams to be transmitted in the system, where I-slices streams have higher
priority while video streams and P-slices have a relatively low priority.

DG scheduling. In the evaluation, soft HARQ-ACK is used, where the UE provides
enhanced HARQ-ACK feedback beyond the baseline single bit ACK/NACK status in
the form of a Delta MCS based on PDSCH decoding. This additional information
provided by the UE based on reception of a transport block is used for gNodeB
to adapt the scheduling of retransmissions.

HARQ-Ack (gNodeB processing delay from HARQ feedback to retransmission = 4/6/8
slots) to 4.6/2.8/2 UEs per cell with Soft HARQ-Ack with (gNodeB processing
delay from HARQ feedback to retransmission = 4/6/8 slots).

# 8 XR UE power consumption evaluation
## 8.1 Purpose of study
The purpose of power study is to understand the NR UE power consumption
performance for XR applications, and identify any issues and performance gaps,
which could be useful for understanding i) the limitation of current NR
systems in supporting XR applications and ii) the potential directions for
future necessary enhancements to improve power efficiency.
## 8.2 KPI
The KPI for power evaluation is the UE power consumption, which is UE specific
metric. The detailed method for estimating UE power consumption is given in
evaluation methodology clause.
The power saving gain (PSG) is determined from A: the power consumption of a
power saving scheme and B: the power consumption of baseline (AlwaysOn) case;
PSG = (B-A)/B×100%.
Since UE power saving gain typically comes with the loss in capacity (i.e.,
more precisely, the loss in the satisfied UE ratio), it also needs to be
considered jointly with power consumption/power saving gain.
## 8.3 UE power consumption evaluation
### 8.3.1 Baseline power evaluation results
This clause includes the baseline power consumption results. PS schemes
considered in this clause includes AlwaysOn, R15/16/17 power saving schemes
such as CDRX, cross slot scheduling and MIMO layer adaptation by BWP
switching, PDCCH monitoring adaptation.
\- AlwaysOn: In this scheme, UE is always available for scheduling (i.e., no
DRX off period). When UE is not receiving/transmitting DL/UL data, UE is
assumed to keep monitoring PDCCH.
\- R15/16 CDRX: Connected mode DRX scheme is assumed. (Note that no R16 wake
up signal is considered.)
\- Cross slot scheduling and MIMO layer adaptation by BWP switching: R16
dynamic BWP switching across different BWP with different configuration of
minimum K0 and maximum MIMO layers.
\- R17 PDCCH monitoring adaptation: UE skipping PDCCH monitoring based on a
dynamically indicated PDCCH skipping indication and/or search space set group
switching (SSSG) indication. In this scheme, it is assumed that network will
send PDCCH skipping command with skipping duration(s). Note that, in details,
the described operation may or may not be fully compliant to R17 PDCCH
monitoring adaptation scheme which is currently still being discussed in R17
UE PS session as of 107-e.
\- Genie: In this scheme, UE is assumed to be in a sleep state (e.g.,
micro/light/deep sleep as defined in TR38.840) whenever there is neither DL
data reception nor UL transmission.

#### 8.3.3.2 Jitter Handling
This clause provides the performance impact of potential jitter handling
mechanisms.
XR DL traffic arrival has jitter which makes exact frame arrival timing random
due to random delay contributed from frame encoders in Edge server, network
transfer time in core network, etc. If traffic arrives too early, then packets
should be delayed until UE wakes up from CDRX off state, which increases the
latency for the packet transmission. This can potentially negatively affect
the capacity given the tight PDB in DL. DL burst arrives later than the
expected time of arrival (where DRX On duration start offset is configured),
the UE should wait for DL burst arrival while performing unnecessary PDCCH
monitoring. The unnecessary PDCCH monitoring increases UE power consumption.
Jitter handling mechanisms address these issues. In this clause, following
potential jitter handling schemes have been captured.
\- eCDRX with jitter handling
\- Enhanced PDCCH monitoring adaption with jitter handling
\- Enhanced CDRX with additional active time
\- Fast/dense WUS for jitter handling with eCDRX
The general idea for jitter handling is to make DRX On duration start
offset/PDCCH skipping end duration/new Active Time be aligned with actual DL
traffic arrival time as much as possible by L1 indication or prediction based
on traffic arrival statistics. This power saving gain captured in this clause
show the potential performance gain when jitter can be properly handled by
such schemes.

#### 8.3.3.3 XR dedicated PDCCH monitoring window
In this clause, we capture the evaluation results for dynamic scheduling of XR
specific dedicated PDCCH monitoring window scheme with PDCCH skipping and go-
to-sleep. In this scheme, XR dedicated PDCCH monitoring window/cycle is
defined, which is disassociated with the DRX configuration, but aligned with
XR traffic pattern. Dynamic scheduling with XR specific dedicated PDCCH
monitoring window scheme would have UE monitor PDCCH in the given window in
both within Active time and outside Active Time when DRX is configured.

#### 8.3.3.4 Additional packet delay budget with playout buffer
This clause captures the evaluation results of the impact of additional PDB
(APDB) on UE power consumption. The XR application layer at UE would have the
XR packet playout buffer to battle the delay jitter and out-of sequence XR
packet arrival. The playout buffer at UE would ensure the in-sequence and time
interval alignment of XR video frames when it plays out to the user. The
proposed scheme is for UE to feedback not only the XR-application type (XR-
application awareness) but also the implemented playout buffer at application
layer to the gNB. If the size of playout buffer is fed back from UE and known
at gNB, then, additional PDB could be used for packet scheduling, which could
give gNB more time to schedule UE within the delay budget requirements of the
XR service and more likely to successfully transmit packets with link
adaptation gain. The addition of the power saving techniques, such as PDCCH
skipping and go-to-sleep, could help UE in achieving power saving by reducing
PDCCH monitoring during extended scheduling period by additional PDB.
Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.3.4-1, the following observations
can be made.
[Observation]{.underline}
\- In FR1, DL evaluation, DU, VR30, it was observed from Source 3 that
additional packet delay budget with play out buffer provides the mean power

#### 8.3.3.5 Traffic arrival offset staggering
This clause captures the evaluation results of the impact of different traffic
arrival offsets across different UEs. The XR DL traffic arrival offsets
potentially determines the time UE wakes up and how long the UE need to be
awake. When the frame arrivals are aligned with each other, the XR traffic of
the UEs contend for resources, decreasing the capacity and increasing power
consumption due to the increased UE awake time. If the frame arrivals of UEs
are staggered relative to each other, the cell can serve UEs minimizing the
overlap of scheduling durations of each UE, which consequently reduce UEs\'
awake time and make UEs stay longer in sleep state.

#### 8.3.3.6 SR group switching
This clause captures the evaluation results of the SR group switching and
baseline. The XR UL traffic arrives frequently, especially for pose/control.
For dynamic scheduling, UE transmits a SR if UE has data to be transmitted. UE
will monitor PDCCH for potential UL grant after the transmission of SR.
Frequent SR transmission will increase both UL and DL power consumption.
Switching between a dense SR periodicity and a sparse SR periodicity can
achieve a tradeoff between latency of UL data transmission and UE power
consumption.
Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.3.6-1, the following observations
can be made.
[Observation]{.underline}
\- In FR1, UL evaluation, InH, ULPose with 250FPS, it was observed from Source

#### 8.3.3.7 UL active time
This clause captures the evaluation results of the UL active time and
baseline. Various signals/data needs to be transmitted in UL. UE needs to wake
up frequently to transmit signals/data which requires more power for warm-up
and ramp-down. The independent transmission occasion of each signals/data
shall also split sleep time of the UE. If the transmission of UL signals/data
can be confined within an UL active time, UE is more likely to go to a deeper
sleep. UL active time is defined by a periodic cycle and a duration, where UE
only transmits UL signals/data during the duration time of the cycle, and UE
doesn\'t transmit UL signals/data outside the duration of the cycle. In this
clause, UL active time with configurations of (cycle, duration) = (8ms, 4ms),
(8ms, 3ms) is evaluated.
Based on the evaluation results in Table 8.3.3.7-1, the following observations
can be made.

# 9 XR coverage evaluation
## 9.1 Purpose of study
The coverage study is for understanding the DL and UL coverage performance of
XR applications. Note that the coverage depends on the evaluation
assumptions/setup such as considered link direction (DL vs UL), bit rate, PDB,
PER requirement, gNB/UE tx power, etc. Thus, the metric should be understood
as a conditional metric for the given assumption. Through this study, we can
identify the coverage of XR applications in terms of coupling gain and
bottleneck direction of the considered applications.
## 9.2 KPI
The KPI of the coverage evaluation is _XR coverage_ which is defined as the 5%
point of CDF of coupling gains for the satisfied UEs.
In this study, we consider two slightly different evaluation methodologies.
The details of the two coverage evaluation methodologies are found in Annex
A.3.

**[XR Coverage]{.underline}**
The AR, VR, and CG coverage was evaluated based on the agreed traffic model
and two methodologies for coverage evaluation. Note that these two
methodologies are different from the traditional methodology based on link
budget for coverage evaluation. The results are collected in Clause 10.3.
According to the evaluation results, it is observed that for deployment
scenarios of dense urban and urban macro, UL coverage is worse than DL
coverage.
**[XR Mobility]{.underline}**
The performance of mobility for AR, VR, and CG applications was studied. The
study considers two mobility KPIs given in Clause 11.2: number of consecutive
XR packets lost due to a handover event and minimum target time between
handover events. The evaluation methodology of mobility performance is a
simplified analytical approach given in Clause A.4, and the evaluation results
are collected in Clause 11.3. The following is observed from the results:
\- Higher PDB leads to lower (better) mobility KPIs.
\- Higher frame rate leads to higher (worse) number of consecutive XR packets
lost:
\- When varying the handover interruption time, the lower (better) mobility
KPIs are achieved when handover interruption time is lower than PDB.
\- Higher handover interruption time leads to higher (worse) mobility KPIs.
Based on the study, it is recommended to further study and enhance at least
the capacity and UE power consumption performance of 5G NR for XR and CG
applications.
###### ### Annex A: Evaluation methodology
# A.1 Evaluation methodology for capacity
**[System Level Simulation Parameters for Capacity Evaluation]{.underline}**
For Capacity evaluation, system level simulation (SLS) is carried out based on
the simulation parameters presented in Table A.1-1 (for FR1) and Table A-1-2
(for FR2) should be used.
The gNB and UEs in the simulation are configured base on simulation parameters
presented in Table A.1-1 (for FR1) and Table A-1-2 (for FR2) and the traffic
model used for the simulation is selected from the XR/CG traffic models
presented in Clause 5.
**[DL-only and UL-only Evaluation]{.underline}**
In capacity evaluation, the DL and UL evaluation is done separately and
independently.
**[UE Dropping]{.underline}**
For a given number of UEs per cell, _N_ , the _N_ UEs are randomly dropped in
the network using the UE distribution specified in Table A.1-1 (for FR1) and
Table A-1-2 (for FR2) for the chosen deployment scenario. Either exactly equal
number of UEs per cell could be assumed or on average N UEs per cell could be
assumed. Either approach is accepted, and companies are to report the method
used for their evaluation.
**[Packet Discarding]{.underline}**
Once communication commence between the UE and gNB, an XR/CG packet is deemed
in error (i.e., lost) when it has exceeded the PDB, such that it will be added
to the PER counting. It is up to company to report the details for the
handling of packet which has exceeded the PDB, e.g.
**\- Option 1:** The packet exceeding the delay is still delivered to the
other side
**\- Option 2:** The packet (including the non-transmitted part) is discarded
at the transmitter (at the gNB for DL packets and at the UE for UL packets)
\- Other options are not precluded
**[Satisfied UE and Capacity]{.underline}**
For a given UE, the achieved PER for all packets communicated during the
session is determined. Using the achieved PER per UE, the percentage of the
satisfied UEs can be determined for this simulation.
Multiple runs of the SLS are required to sweep the number of UEs per cell,
_N,_ in order to determine the capacity C (i.e., the maximum value of _N_
satisfying at least 90% of the UEs are satisfied (see Clause 7.2.2 for
definition of capacity)).
The system capacity for DL and UL are identified separately though independent
evaluation.
**[Additional Metrics]{.underline}**
In addition to the KPIs discussed in Clause 7.2, following performance metrics
can be optionally reported.
\- Percentage of satisfied UEs
\- CDF of packet error ratio
\- CDF of packet latency
\- CDF of user-perceived throughput
\- Resource utilization

# A.2 Evaluation methodology for power
**[Baseline UE Power Model]{.underline}**
For XR UE power evaluation, the power model presented in [6] is used with
additional modifications presented in this clause.
**[System Level Power Evaluation]{.underline}**
In this study, UE power consumption evaluation system is done in _system
level_ setup; UE are distributed across multiple cells are their dynamic DL rx
and UL tx activities are considered in each UE\'s power consumption evaluation
including time varying channel conditions, and dynamic scheduling for DL and
UL with HARQ operations, power control, etc. With system level setup, the
study allows to capture distribution of UE power consumptions across different
locations in the cell showing different power consumption distributions across
different rx/tx physical channel activities (e.g., PDCCH, PDSCH, PUSCH, PUCCH,
...).
More importantly, the system level power evaluation allows the joint
evaluation of capacity and power -- allowing to capture the interaction
between scheduler and power saving mechanism (e.g., CDRX) revealing capacity
and power tradeoff. Due to the power of system level power evaluation
framework, one can compare different power saving mechanisms with capacity in
consideration, i.e., making the comparison fair by making it subject to
limited capacity loss.
**[Power Saving Schemes]{.underline}**
To evaluate the power saving impact of different power saving schemes for
XR/CG, companies are encouraged to evaluate UE power consumption as described
below:
As a baseline, UE is always ON, i.e., UE is always available for gNB
scheduling of XR/CG traffic, is considered. The power consumption of AlwaysOn
could be reference for power saving gain calculation.
Optionally following power saving mechanisms can be further considered.
**\- Release 15/16 CDRX** mechanism can be optionally evaluated. The CDRX
configuration can be reported with the evaluation results.
**\- Release 15/16/17 Connected mode** **power saving techniques** such as BWP
switching, PDCCH skipping and search space switching can also be evaluated.
**\- Genie** scheme can be studied. The Genie power saving scheme works such
that UE is in a sleep state (e.g., micro/light/deep sleep as defined in
TR38.840) whenever there is neither DL data reception nor UL transmission.
From the gNB scheduling perspective, it is assumed that UE is always available
for scheduling, i.e., there is no difference from Baseline in gNB scheduling
and corresponding UE transmission/reception availability. Note that the Genie
approach is expected to provide an _upper bound of power savings_ gain since
the UE is able to take advantage of all the unscheduled slot duration by
entering sleep state whenever possible.
\- Other schemes not listed here could be also evaluated.
**[DL and UL Power Saving Evaluation]{.underline}**
For XR/CG power consumption evaluation, DL and UL power consumption can be
evaluated based on following methods.
**\- DL-only Evaluation, UL-only Evaluation:** DL and UL power are evaluated
separately and independently, and the DL and UL power consumption results are
collected separately.
**\- DL+UL Joint Evaluation:** DL and UL performances are evaluated together,
and DL and UL power consumption are counted to obtain the total power
consumption.
Note that adding DL-only power number and UL-only power will not give the
equal power number as DL+UL joint power number due to duplicate power cost
counted in DL / UL-only method such as PDCCH monitoring.
**[System-level Simulation Flow]{.underline}**
For XR UE power consumption evaluation, SLS is carried out using the capacity
evaluation methodology for the baseline and power saving scheme under
investigation. The details are presented below:
\- Step 1. Determine a scenario/application/configurations/power saving
schemes for evaluation.
\- Step 2. Determination of the number of UEs per cell N for power evaluation.
\- N is set to floor(C), where C is the XR capacity for the given
scenario/application/configuration and floor() is flooring operation.
\- Note that N=floor(C) corresponds to the high system load case.
\- Optionally, N could be set to smaller than C (N\ where $P_{E,\text{op}}$ is packet error rate during time outside of handover
