# 4 Background
## 4.1 Justification
Increasing the transmit power of UE has significant benefits on extending cell
coverage area and improving the experience of cell edge users. In rel-16 one
study item and two work items related to HPUE have been proposed and worked on
to standardize the requirements for EN-DC scenarios.
However, extension of cell coverage for lower-frequency NR SA FDD band is also
important for some operators considering data throughput for cell edge users
is not satisfactory even in FDD bands, and further increasing the UE transmit
power would be beneficial for improving the performance of cell edge users.
Increasing the transmission power will be beneficial for extending uplink
coverage. SAR compliance schemes should be considered (e.g. Existing duty
cycle based solution could be taken into consideration for this study, other
solutions are not precluded.).
This Study Item is proposed to solve SAR issues, and potentially enable Power
Class 2 UE for one FDD band with 26 dBm maximum output power (UE types include
smart phone, FWA, etc.). NR band n1 and n3 shall be used as example band for
this study.
## 4.2 Objective
The objectives of the SI are as follows:
1 Study the applicable scheme(s) for new power class 2 UE for one NR FDD band
to comply with the SAR limits with 26dBm UE Tx power, the example band for
this study is NR band n1 and n3.
a. Study candidate SAR solutions, e.g. P-MPR, duty cycle capability, etc.
b. Study regulatory requirements related to 26dBm Tx power in FDD bands
including SAR.
> Note: Prioritize studies for the existing SAR solutions.
2 Study interference issues (e.g. self-desense, cross device coexistence...).
a. Study RF requirements for PC2 UE in FDD band, including self-desense
requirements, Tx requirements such as A-MPR, and so on.
b. Study adjacent channel co-existence for FDD band.
c. Investigate issues related to in-device interference, if identified.
3 Study UE implementation related issues such as RF component feasibility to
support 26dBm output power in band n1 and n3 at first. Other example FDD bands
are not precluded, if needed.
Evaluate system performance gains on spectrum efficiency, and other metrics if
needed could also be taken into account, to support NR FDD HPUE.
# 5 SAR Scheme
To accommodate the SAR limits of the NR PC2 FDD High Power UE, both UE-based
and network-based solutions are considered in the study phase. For UE-based
solution, the UE implementation based mechanism is used to ensure SAR
compliance. In addition to UE-based solution, an optional method of reporting
duty-cycle capability was also intensively discussed, but there is no
conclusion reached.

## 6.1 Receiver sensitivity degradation evaluation
Based on following agreement, RAN4 need to evaluate the receiver sensitivity
degradation impact in NR band n1 and n3.
\- Agreement: RAN4 can study receiver sensitivity degradation due to high max.
out power and Tx/Rx isolation levels according to RF component performance in
both n1 and n3 FDD bands.
\- Companies are encouraged to bring analyses on receiver sensitivity
degradation in next meeting.
### 6.1.1 Sensitivity degradation results for normal CBW in n1/n3
To derive sensitivity degradation in n1/n3, RAN4 assumed the current RFIC
characteristics and Duplexer & PA characteristics in each NR band.
In Table 6.1.1-1, the current RF component characterics are summaried
according to each NR band.
Table 6.1.1-1. RF parameters according to each NR band
parameters NR n1 band NR n3 band

isolation (dB) 53 49 RF Front-End Loss (dB) 4 4 Diversity gain (dB) 3 3
Antenna isolation (dB) 10 10
The receiver sensitivity will be impacted by duplexer isolation levels and
increasing noise level by RFIC and PA for Rx band at antenna connector based
on PC3 REFSENS requirements in each FDD bands.
Hence, the receiver sensitivity degradation will be derived based on the
increasing noise level in Rx band by duplexer isolation and RFIC/PA noise for
PC2 transmission in FDD band.
The following REFSENS is for PC3 UE in n3 FDD NR band as reference point.

#### 6.1.1.1 Dominant factor by Duplexer Tx/Rx isolation in each FDD band
Basically, the existing PA for FDD band need to improve the linearity of
maximum output power at least 3dB higher than current PA characteristics based
on section 7. Also duplexer aspect, filter vendor need to enhanced the Tx/Rx
isolation level to guarantee the existing REFSENS or to relax desense impact.
But it is also challenge to filter vendors for small Tx/Rx frequency gap such
as Band 3 or NR band n3.
So, just asumed 2dB Tx/Rx isolation levels by 3dB Transmission power
increasing would be impacted the sensitivity degradation compare to PC3
duplexer in n3.
In Table 6.1.1.1-1, the expected sensitivity degradation levels by decreasing
2dB duplexer isolation level are shown.
**Table 6.1.1.1-1. Sensitivity degradation by duplexer isolation 2dB

-94.5 dBm 0.9dB MSD is needed
**Observation: In n3 FDD band, the 0.9 dB MSD is needed when Duplexer
isolation charateristic is decreased 2dB compare to current filter
characteristics.**
**Observation: In n1 FDD band, the 0.4dB MSD is needed when Duplexer isolation
charateristic is decreased 2dB compare to current filter characteristics.**
#### 6.1.1.2 Dominant factor by RFIC/PA noise levles in Rx band
In this section, we consider the increased noise level in Rx band by RFIC/PA
operation in FDD band. Eventhough filter vendor try to keep or enhance the the
current Tx/Rx isolation level in duplexer for each FDD band, the raised
leakage problem in Rx band also shall be considered.
**Observation: Eventhough duplexer isolation level keep or enhance the Tx/Rx
isolation level, the raised leakage problem in Rx band by RFIC/PA operation in
FDD band will be impacted to the sensitivity degradation in FDD band.**
When we consider 3dB Tx power boosting, the noise level could be increased by
RFIC/PA operation in Rx band. So we assumed about 1.5dB noise level increasing
in Rx band to derive the expected MSD level according to each FDD band.
Table 6.1.1.2-1. Sensitivity degradation by increasing noise level (1.5dB) by
RFIC/PA in Rx band
                                                             NR n1 band                      NR n3 band

*10MHz BW -93.4 -95.7 -87.4 -93.9 After MRC -97.7 dBm 0.3dB MSD is needed
-94.7 dBm 0.7dB MSD is needed
The expected MSD degradations are almost same as Duplexer isolation
degradation as shown in Table 6.1.1.1.
**Observation: In n3 FDD band, the 0.7 dB MSD is needed when assume noise
level might be increased about 1.5dB in Rx band by RFIC/PA operation.**
**Observation: In n1 FDD band, the 0.3dB MSD is needed when assume noise level
might be increased about 1.5dB in Rx band by RFIC/PA operation.**
#### 6.1.1.3 Dominant factor by Duplexer and RFIC/PA noise levles in Rx band
In here we consider worst case for MSD analysis that means the duplexer
isolation could not keep and enhanced such as in n3 FDD band due to small
Tx/Rx frequency gap.
Then, above Duplexer performance decreasing and the noise level in Rx band
will be increased in RFIC by 3dB Tx power increasing for PC2 UE in FDD band.
So, the above two factor will be impacted in the receiver sensitivity
degradation in FDD band.
In Table 6.1.1.3-1, we provided the expected sensitivity degradation by
considering the duplexer characteristics and incresed noise level in Rx band
by RFIC/PA operation.

relaxation) & incresed noise level (1.5dB) in Rx band by RFIC/PA operation

Based on the expected RF component degradation, observations are provided as
follow
**Observation: In n3 FDD band, the 1.7 dB MSD is needed when both Duplexer
isolation charateristic (2dB relaxation) and increased noise level (1.5dB) in
Rx band by RFIC/PA operation for PC2 FDD UE.**
**Observation: In n1 FDD band, the 0.8dB MSD is needed when both duplexer
isolation charateristic (2dB relaxation) and increased noise level (1.5dB) in
Rx band by RFFIC/PA operation for PC2 FDD UE.**
### 6.1.2 Wide channel bandwidth sensitivity analysis in n3
For the wide channel bandwidth (CBW) in n3 NR band, RAN4 need study the
sensitivity degradation to consider the counter IMD problem such as CIM5
impact in n3 received frequency band as shown in Figure 6.1.2-1.
{width="3.6770833333333335in" height="1.65625in"}
Figure 6.1.2-1 Impact on the CIMD5 problem in n3 NR band
#### 6.1.2.1 LGE sensitivity analysis results in n3
To derive sensitivity degradation in n3 with wide CBW, we assumed the
following as shown in Table 6.1.2.1-1.
Table 6.1.2.1-1. RF parameters according to each NR band
parameters NR n3 band
* * *
Total NF (dB) 9.00 counter-intermodulation products CIM5 (dBc) -60 RFIC Noise

band (dB) 28 Duplexer Tx/Rx isolation (dB) 47 RF Front-End Loss (dB) 4
Diversity gain (dB) 3 Antenna isolation (dB) 10
The receiver sensitivity will be impacted by duplexer isolation levels and
increasing noise level by RFIC and PA for Rx band at antenna connector based
on PC3 REFSENS requirements in each CBW.
Hence, the receiver sensitivity degradation will be derived based on the
increasing noise level in Rx band by duplexer isolation and RFIC/PA noise due
to CIM5 from PC2 transmission in FDD band.
The following REFSENS analysis is for PC3 UE in n3 FDD NR band with 40Mhz and
50MHz CBW as reference point.

**Observation: In 40M CBW, the 2.1 dB MSD by CIMD5 is needed when PC2
transmission in n3 FDD band.**
**Observation: In 50M CBW, the 2.4 dB MSD by CIMD5 is needed when PC2
transmission in n3 FDD band.**
Hence, RAN4 recommand as follow
To reduce the sensitivity degradation in n3/n1 band, filter vendor shall keep
or enhance the duplexer Tx/Rx isolation level for FDD bands to support PC2 UE.
Based on RF component improvement, RAN4 can further study for sensitivity
degradation requirements when RF component vendor provide these commercial
Duplexer, PAs and RFICs for PC2 UE in FDD band in WI phase.
#### 6.1.2.2 SKW sensitivity analysis results in n3
To derive the sensitivity degradation in n3 band, we use the same UL RB
allocations than those agreed for PC3 NR UE in n3 band.
The PA noise levels in the receiver band and corresponding MSD levels can be
found in Figure 6.1.2.2-1 as below.
{width="7.260416666666667in" height="1.6770833333333333in"}
Figure 6.1.2.2-1 Measured Tx noise and corresponding MSD levels for all CBW.
The estimated MSD levels for in 35MHz, 40MHz, 45MHz and 50MHz CBW lead to
REFSENS levels that are lower than those agreed for PC3 operation. For these
CBW, we tentatively propose to use the same approach as in [3], i.e. we
propose PC2 REFSENS levels by evaluating the MSD level difference between PC3
and PC2 and apply this MSD difference to PC3 REFSENS levels. We observe the
following MSD difference vs CBW:
\- 3.1dB for 50MHz CBW: PC2 MSD of 7.2dB vs PC3 MSD of 4.1dB [3],
\- 2.5dB for 45MHz CBW: PC2 MSD of 4.5dB vs PC3 MSD 2dB [3],
\- 0.6dB for 40MHz CBW: PC2 MSD of 2.0 dB vs PC3 MSD of 1.5dB [3],
\- 0.2dB for 35MHz CBW: PC2 MSD of 0.9 dB vs PC3 MSD of 0.7 dB [3].
For CBW less than or equal to 30MHz, the PC2 MSD can be neglected.
n3 PC2 REFSENS levels and UL configurations are proposed in Table 6.1.2.2-1

#### 6.1.2.3 ZTE sensitivity analysis results in n3
For band n3, the situation is more complicated since CIM5 may need to be
considered for some larger CBWs such as 35MHz, 40MHz 45MHz and 50MHz, shown in
Table 6.1.2.3-1. We can see from Table 6.1.2.3-1, there are CIM5 problem for
40MHz, 45MHz and 50MHz with the same UL configurations of 50RB, which will
further degrade the REFSEN requirements. Therefore, when the maximum output
power increase 3dB, CIM5 value will become large which will cause REFSEN
degradation more severe.

Similar with band n1, we cite some measurement results in [3] as follow:
The measured TX noise levels in RX band are:
\- 35 MHz: -45 dBm,
\- 40 MHz: -40.4 dBm,
\- 45 MHz: -38 dBm,
\- 50 MHz: -32.3 dBm
In addition, 50 dB Tx to RX and Tx to Antenna duplexer rejection in Rx band,
as a worst case assumption. With the above measurement, the MSD levels for
CBW>35MHz channel bandwidths are larger than 0.5dB, which means the REFENS
requirements cannot be scaled by the channel bandwidth since CIM5 interference
needs to be considered.
To roughly simulate the PC2 case, here we increase the additional Tx noise
(i.e. delta P from 0\~6dB) on top of the above measured Tx noise levels in Rx
band , where 0dB means no additional measured Tx noise, i.e. same with PC3
case. The MSD levels are shown in Figure 6.1.2.3-1 as follow:
{width="5.03125in" height="1.90625in"}
**Figure 6.1.2.3-1 Expected MSD levels in n3 according to delta P**
In can be seen that the MSD levels are increased by the delta P due to the
total Tx noise levels in RX band increased. The slope for larger CBW is
steeper than the small CBW. Assuming additional 6dB total Tx noise on top of
the existing measured ones, then to guarantee the same REFSEN requirements as
PC3 for PC2, \~5dB additional duplexer rejections on top of the existing one
would be needed.
**Observation: For band n3, assuming additional 6dB total noise caused by
increasing 3dB MOP, then \~5dB additional duplexer rejections on top of the
existing one could be needed to guarantee the existing PC3 REFSEN requirements
for PC2.**
The duplexers filter can achieve better isolation than what was used as an
assumption (i.e. 50dB) for LTE FDD bands and copied to NR considering the
today's duplexer state-of-the-art. Therefore, to reduce the PC2 REFSEN
requirements for band n1 or band n3, better duplexer Tx/Rx (more than 50dB
such as 55dB) could be needed.
From the above sensitivity degradation simulation results, RAN4 summarize the
required sentitivity degradation levels as shown in Table 6.1-1 and Table
6.1-2. The reference points are PC3 REFSENS requirements in TS38.101-1 to
decide the required sensitivity level for PC2 UE.

The above two tables will be considered as starting point to determine the
exact REFSENS levels for FDD PC2 UE in WI phase.
# 7 UE implementations
In this section, we take a look at the RF component performance in FDD band
such as n1/n3.
## 7.1 Current RF component characteristics in FDD band
Generally, RAN4 considered RF front-end loss as 4dB for smart phone form
facter for PC3 and PC2 UE. Then, to support PC2 UE in FDD band, both PA and
Duplexer shall support the allowed max. output with at least 30 dBm power to
support PC2 UE.
### 7.1.1 Power Amplifier characteristics
The following characteristics of PA are shown in Table 7.1.1.1 and Table

Based on above PA performance information in FDD band, we can see that current
PA need to improve the linearity of maximum output power at least 3dB higher
than current PA characteristics.
### 7.1.2 Duplexer characteristics
The following characteristics of Duplexer are shown in Table 7.1.2.1 and Table
7.1.2.2
\- Duplexer characteristic for the allowed max. input power in n3

â€»Condition : SC-FDMA, MPR 0dB
Based on above Duplexer performance information in FDD band, we can see that
current Duplexer also need to improve the maximum power rating at least 2\~3dB
higher than the current Duplexer characteristics.
Therefore, RAN4 can study on high power UE (power class 2) for one NR FDD band
when RF component vendor are ready to support the RF component performance to
support PC2 UE in FDD band.
From the above current RF component characteristics, we share our observation
and proposal as follow
**Observation : In FDD band, the PA/Duplexer charateristic is not support PC2
maximum output power since PA linearity and Duplexer allowed maximum power
rating shall improve the performance at least 3dB higher than current
component charateristics.**
# 8 System Performance Evaluation
## 8.1 Dynamic system level simulation
### 8.1.1 General
The dynamic system level simulation is usually used to evaluate the system
performance gain, which can simulate the behavior of system in more detail.
The HPUE feature can improve UL coverage but at the same time increase the
interference of the neighboring cells, and the final system performance gain
is evaluated by the average cell uplink throughput and 5%-tile cell-edge
uplink throughput.
In addition, the SAR issue is also a practical factor that limits HPUE
performance. Restricting duty-cycle is a commonly used method to avoid SAR
issue, and it is widely used in TDD systems. However, there are some
difficulties in compatibility between duty-cycle and FDD systems, but in order
to include the potential impact of scheduling constraints on system
performance due to the SAR issues, the 50% duty-cycle restriction should also
be evaluated.

For alpha = 0.6, The proportion of UEs working at high power is relatively
small, and the performance gain of PC2 UE is reflected in edge users which is
also in line with the expected purpose. However, the 50% duty-cycle will
significantly reduce the performance gain because high-power users are mainly
distributed at the edge of the cell at this time.

When the alpha rises to 0.8, the proportion of high-power users will increase.
PC2 UEs will significantly improve cell average and edge performance. Since
high-power users are not only distributed at the 5% edge of the cell at this
time, the performance gain reduction caused by the 50% duty-cycle is
relatively small. It is worth noting that the alpha change has caused the
power of most UEs to rise, which increases the overall interference level, and
the absolute value of the cell throughput decreases relative to the case of
alpha=0.6.

Resource utilization is at a relatively low level which may cause some
potential simulation vulnerabilities. Low resource utilization may mean that
high-power users at the edge complete data transmission quickly, and there
will be no scheduling conflicts between different UEs. This will cause the
interference increase caused by high power to be hidden. To remedy this
problem, some simulation results of higher resource utilization are provided
as Table 8.1.3.5.1-2 and Table 8.1.3.5.1-3.

The result shows that when the resource utilization increase, the system
performance gain of cell average still considerable. However, the performance
of cell edge will be tiny when the RU rise to about 50%. Note that under the
same traffic model, the RU of PC2 UE will be slightly larger than that of PC3.
This is caused by the decrease in SINR due to increased interference at high
power.
Company 3 (R4-2111446)
Figure 8.1.3.5-1 shows the CDF curve of the UE. From Figure 1, although the
interference increases with the increase of transmit power of PC2 UE, there is
still 1dB gain compared with the PC3 UE. And Figure 8.1.3.5-2 shows the actual
number of scheduled RB for the PC2 UE and PC3 UE sorted by UE throughput. For
the cell edge UE (5% UPT UE), the number of the scheduled RB for PC2 UE is
more than twice of the PC3 UE. Therefore, even though the PC2 UE has 50%
restriction, due to the gain of the SINR and the more scheduled RB for PC2 UE,
the average and cell edge cases could have an obvious performance gain.

## 8.2 Monte Carlo simulation
8.2.1 Simulation methodology
The Monte Carlo based static system level simulation is typical simulation
method used in the coexistence study and can also be used for the simplified
system performance evaluation. The sub-snapshot method is agreed as one of
possible methods to simulate the HPUE feature.
The difference for UL duty cycle is emulated by assuming there are N sub-
snapshots within one snapshot. For example, we can set N=2 for the case of 50%
duty cycle for FDD HPUE. Similarly, we can set N=4 for the case of 25% duty
cycle. In each snapshot, UEs are randomly placed in a predefined deployment
scenario. But within one snapshot, the UEs' locations for N sub-snapshots are
fixed. Table 8.2.1-1 illustrates the sub-snapshot concept and the simulation
method. When the simulation performance is assumed to be measured within one
frame (e.g., 10ms) and only 50% time can be used for UL transmission within
one frame assuming 50% duty cycle. Then each sub-snapshot can be considered as
5ms in the Monte-Carlo simulation.

DC)

Non-full buffer and full buffer scenarios are both considered in the
simulation. For the non-full buffer scenario, the resource will not be used in
the sub-snapshot which there is no transmission for the UE with >23dBm Tx
power. For the full buffer scenario, a new user will be scheduled in one of
the two sub-snapshots when the UE with >23dBm Tx power will not transmit in
that correspondent sub-snapshot due to 50% duty cycle.
There are also other evaluation methods can be implemented to stimulate the
duty cycle in the Monte Carlo simulation, such as drawing a random number in
each snapshot. If the random number is larger than the duty cycle, then the
HPUE will be replaced with another UE; If the random number is less than the
duty cycle, then the HPUE will transmit normally with Tx power up to 26 dBm.

8.2.3 Simulation results
8.2.3.1 Simulation results for power control set 4A
The ratio of UL Tx power > 23dBm is about 4.9% for power control set 4A.
In a more realistic situation, for example, considering a relatively long-time
duration, the time restriction for UE duty cycle can be relaxed assuming that
UE can keep transmit with >23dBm power in its scheduled duration. After the UE
finishes its transmission, another UE will be scheduled. In this scenario, the
UE can naturally realize the 50% duty cycle by the scheduling time since the
UE will not be always scheduled. The duty cycle then does not need to be
considered in the result processing. Therefore, the system performances are
shown in Table 8.2.3.1-1 and Table 8.2.3.1-2.

As shown in Table 8.2.3.1-1 and Table 8.2.3.1-2:
\- When 50% duty cycle can be realized in a longer duration, performance gain
can be observed for the 5% throughput. The gain's value depends on the PC2 UE
ratio and the traffic loading.
\- When 50% duty cycle can be realized in a longer duration, performance gain
can be observed for the average cell throughput. The gain's value depends on
the PC2 UE ratio and the traffic loading.
\- When 50% duty cycle can be realized in a longer duration, higher PC2 UE
ratio will bring higher 5%-throughput gain as well as the average cell
throughput gain. The system performance gain is highly related with PC2 UE
ratio.
8.2.3.2 Simulation results for power control set 4B
The Tx power ratio UL Tx power > 23dBm is about 17.8% for power control set
4B.
Similar consideration is applied, when 50% duty cycle can be realized in a
longer duration, the 50% duty cycle need not be considered in the performance
processing. Therefore, the system performance is shown in Table 8.2.3.2-1 and
Table 8.2.3.2-2.

**From the simulation results shown in chapter 8.2.3.2, the similar
performance variance trend can be observed for the power control set 4B,
compared with power control set 4A.**
8.2.3.3 Simulation observations
The system performance is sensitive to the power control set parameters. In
realistic situation, where several UEs are multiplexed in the same cell, non-
negligible gain in UL performance can be observed in both mean and 5%-tile
throughput.
# 9 SI Conclusion
In this study item, different aspects of enabling PC2 in NR FDD band n1 and n3
are thoroughly studied. The contents of the study include the applicable
schemes to comply with SAR limits with 26dBm UE Tx power, the interference
issues raised by FDD PC2, UE implementation and RF architectures, as well as
system performance evaluation to support NR FDD HPUE.
Several SAR compliance solutions are studied and discussed in RAN4, including
UE-implementation based methods, reusing of existing duty-cycle reporting
method, and half-duplex operation method. After careful studies and thorough
discussions, the UE-implementation based methods are considered feasible to
make sure SAR regulation is not violated. In addition, optional feature of
applying duty cycle is also considered, as a standardized solution, to solve
SAR compliance issue.
Regarding the interference issues, it was identified by the group that both
MSD and UL configuration are possible alternatives to handle REFSENS
degradation in FDD PC2, and the MSD method will be adopted for the cases of n1
and n3 PC2. MSD values can first be calculated based on available RF
components and existing assumptions. If there are new components available in
the future with better performance, new assumptions can also be considered for
MSD calculations.
In order to support 26dBm UE Tx power, two RF architectures (i.e. 2TxÃ—23dBm
and 1TxÃ—26dBm) are considered and agreed during the study. It is found out
that FDD HPUE with 2Tx architecture is feasible and can reuse existing RF
components targeted for PC3, while 1Tx may need to use newly designed
components. So further analyses of 1Tx architecture could be carried out when
the new components become available.
To fully evaluate the impacts of FDD HPUE to the system performance, Dynamic
system level simulations and Monte Carlo simulations are carried out. In
dynamic system level simulation, performance gain for both cell average and
cell edge cases are verified under various power control parameters. On the
other hand, performance gain can be observed for the 5%-tile throughput and
average cell throughput under Monte Carlo simulation. The potential DL
degradation due to Tx/Rx de-sense does not lead to substantial performance
degradation in typical interference limited scenarios.
In conclusion, it is shown in this SI that high power UE (power class 2) for
NR FDD band brings positive system performance gain to the network, and it is
feasible to reuse existing RF components to support 26dBm UE Tx power, while
new components with performance improvement are also expected to be available
in the future. UE implementation based solution (P-MPR) is used for SAR
compliance. There is no consensus on the optional report of duty cycle
capability, but duty cycle used as an UE implementation method is not
precluded. Specific MSD values and other specification impact(s) will be
determined in the Work Item phase.
