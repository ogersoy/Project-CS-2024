# Foreword
This Technical Specification (TS) has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies a profile of AT commands and recommends that
this profile be used for controlling Mobile Termination (MT) functions and
network services from a Terminal Equipment (TE) through Terminal Adaptor (TA).
The command prefix +C is reserved for Digital Cellular in ITU‑T Recommendation
V.250 [14]. The present document has also the syntax details used to construct
extended commands. Commands from ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14] and existing
digital cellular standards (TIA IS‑99 [15] and TIA IS‑135 [16]) are used
whenever applicable. Some of the new commands are defined such way that they
can be easily applied to MT of other networks.
NOTE: The terms GSM and GSM/UMTS are used whenever appropriate for SIM/UICC
GSM applications or GSM/UMTS bearer services or to represent specific mobile
accesses covered by the present specification.
ITU‑T Recommendation T.31 [11] and ITU-T Recommendation T.32 [12] fax AT
commands may be used for GSM/UMTS fax transmission from TE. Short Message
Service AT commands are defined in 3GPP TS 27.005 [24]. AT commands for packet
systems are defined in clause 10 of this specification. The present document
assumes an abstract architecture comprising a TE (e.g. a computer) and a MT
interfaced by a TA (see figure 1). The span of control of the defined commands
should allow handling of any physical implementation that this abstract
architecture may lead to:
‑ TA, MT and TE as three separate entities;
‑ TA integrated under the MT cover, and the TE implemented as a separate
entity;
‑ TA integrated under the TE cover, and the MT implemented as a separate
entity; and
‑ TA and MT integrated under the TE cover as a single entity.
The commands described in the present document may be observed on the link
between the TE and the TA. However, most of the commands retrieve information
about the MT, not about the TA.
{width="4.801388888888889in" height="1.6472222222222221in"}
Figure 1: Setup
Interface between TE and TA is intended to operate over existing serial (ITU‑T
Recommendation V.24) cables, infrared link, and all link types with similar
behaviour. For correct operation many of the defined commands require eight
bit data and therefore it is recommended that TE‑TA link is set to eight bits/
byte mode. (For infrared operation implementation, refer informative
references IrDA. For embedding AT commands and data during on-line data state,
refer TIA‑617/ITU-T V.80.) Interface between TA and MT is dependent on the
interface in the MT.
The functional blocks shown in figure 1, using AT commands, shall follow the
principles described in the interactions handling framework 3GPP TS 23.227
[63].

## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following syntactical
definitions apply (refer also clause 4):
**\ ** Carriage return character, which value is specified with command
S3.
**\ ** Linefeed character, which value is specified with command S4.
**\ ** Name enclosed in angle brackets is a syntactical element. Brackets
themselves do not appear in the command line.
**[...]** Optional subparameter of a command or an optional part of TA
information response is enclosed in square brackets. Brackets themselves do
not appear in the command line. When subparameter is not given in _parameter
type_ commands, new value equals to its previous value. In _action type_
commands, action should be done on the basis of the recommended default
setting of the subparameter.
**[underline]{.underline}** Underlined defined subparameter value is the
recommended default setting of this subparameter. In _parameter type_
commands, this value should be used in factory settings which are configured
by ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14] command &F0. In _action type_ commands,
this value should be used when subparameter is not given.

# 4 AT command syntax
## 4.0 General
This clause summarizes general aspects on AT commands and issues related to
them.
TE software implementors must take into account that future versions of this
specification may include additional parameters beyond what is expected in any
(final or intermediate) response to an AT set command, read command or test
command, and beyond what is expected in any unsolicited result code.
Implementations must therefore analyse all parameters provided from the TA and
discard (ignore) any parameters received following the parameters expected by
the TE software.
For further information refer ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14].
In the tables for the commands syntaxes, the possible response(s) are outlined
as follows:
\- the responses from ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14] (like _OK_ and _ERROR_)
are normally not shown; and
\- the final response _+CME ERROR_ is shown when a final result code in clause
9.2 can be provided.
In certain implementations, AT commands are used as an internal interface
within the physical handset, e.g. between the application and the radio
interface layer 3 stack implemented on different processors. Certain AT
commands transfer information in the clear that can be regarded as sensitive
with regards to security or privacy. Care must be exercised in AT commands
that:
\- transfer passwords (e.g. +CLCK, +CPWD or +CPBS);
\- transfer identities (e.g. IMSI) or details of a call (e.g. +COLP);
\- transfer the current location of the phone (e.g. +CMOLR);
\- reveal the IMEI (e.g. +CGSN);
\- allow the TE to take unintentionally control over the SIM-MT interface
(e.g. +CSIM);
\- enable/disable access to commands protected by security mechanism (e.g.
+CSCC); or
\- exchange security related parameters and keys with the UICC (e.g. +CEAP and
+CERP).
The above mentioned AT commands and parameters are examples to illustrate the
concerns and is not meant to be a comprehensive list.
## 4.1 Command line
See figure 2 for general structure of a command line. Standardized _basic_
commands are found only in ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14]. The commands in
this specification use syntax rules of _extended_ commands. Every extended
command has a _test command_ (trailing =?) to test the existence of the
command and to give information about the type of its subparameters.
_Parameter type_ commands also have a _read command_ (trailing ?) to check the
current values of subparameters. _Action type_ commands do not store the
values of any of their possible subparameters, and therefore do not have a
read command.
Figure 2: Basic structure of a command line
If verbose responses are enabled with command V1 and all commands in a command
line has been performed successfully, result code \\OK\\ is
sent from the TA to the TE. If numeric responses are enabled with command V0,
result code 0\ is sent instead.
If verbose responses are enabled with command V1 and subparameter values of a
command are not accepted by the TA (or command itself is invalid, or command
cannot be performed for some reason), result code \\ERROR\\ is
sent to the TE and no subsequent commands in the command line are processed.
If numeric responses are enabled with command V0, result code 4\ is sent
instead. ERROR (or 4) response may be replaced by +CME ERROR: \ (refer
clause 9) when command was not processed due to an error related to MT
operation.
## 4.2 Information responses and result codes
The TA response for the example command line of figure 2 could be as shown in
figure 3. Here, verbose response format is enabled with command V1. If numeric
format V0 would have been used, \\ headers of _information response_ s
would have been left out and _final result code_ changed to 0\.
Figure 3: Response to a command line
So called _intermediate result code_ s inform about progress of TA operation
(e.g. connection establishment CONNECT), and so called _unsolicited result
code_ s indicate occurrence of an event not directly associated with issuance
of a command from TE (e.g. ring indication RING).

**Description**
Set command informs TA which character set \ is used by the TE. TA is
then able to convert character strings correctly between TE and MT character
sets.
When TA‑TE interface is set to 8‑bit operation and used TE alphabet is 7‑bit,
the highest bit shall be set to zero.
NOTE: It is manufacturer specific how the internal alphabet of MT is converted
to/from the TE alphabet.
Read command shows current setting and test command displays conversion
schemes implemented in the TA.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.
**Defined values**
\: character set as a string type (conversion schemes not listed here
can be defined by manufacturers).
> \"GSM\" GSM 7 bit default alphabet (3GPP TS 23.038 [25]); this setting
> causes easily software flow control (XON/XOFF) problems.
>
> \"HEX\" Character strings consist only of hexadecimal numbers from 00 to FF;
> e.g. \"032FE6\" equals three 8-bit characters with decimal values 3, 47 and
> 230; no conversions to the original MT character set shall be done.
If MT is using GSM 7 bit default alphabet, its characters shall be padded with
8th bit (zero) before converting them to hexadecimal numbers (i.e. no
SMS‑style packing of 7‑bit alphabet).

**Description**
This command is used to enable/disable the 3GPP TS 27.010 [45] multiplexing
protocol control channel. Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values. The AT
command sets parameters for the Control Channel. If the parameters are left
out, the default value is used.
Read command returns the current settings.
Test command returns the supported parameters as compound values.
It is recommended that the MT/TA/TE should autobaud to the +CMUX command up to
and including an interface speed of 9600 bits/s.
The OK or +CME ERROR: \ response is returned at the speed of the +CMUX
command prior to entering \.
It is recommended that whenever the multiplexer control channel is released
the MT/TA/TE should assume an interface rate of up to and including 9600
bits/s for auto bauding purposes irrespective of any previous higher speed
having been selected.
If a +CMUX command is issued whilst in any multiplexer mode then that +CMUX
command shall be ignored and the MT/TA shall return a +CME ERROR: \
response.

## 5.12 Informative examples
When beginning to build a communication link, a general TE application
controlling a TA needs to determine the TA and the MT to which it is
connected. ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14] has seven commands for TA
identification from which four are mandatory to be implemented in a TA. An
example of this command sequence requesting manufacturer (+GMI), model (+GMM),
revision (+GMR) and serial number (+GSN) information would be:
AT+GMI
Manufacturer ABC
OK
AT+GMM
GSM Ultimate Data Device
OK
AT+GMR
1.00
OK
AT+GSN
987612345‑123
OK
The maximum lengths of the information responses are defined to be 2048
characters, but it is recommended that they are kept as simple as in the
example. The serial number command is defined as optional. Another optional
command is Global Object Identification command (+GOI) which should return the
object identifiers of ITU‑T Recommendation X.208 as numeric strings delimited
by periods. The Complete Capabilities List command (+GCAP) indicates the major
capability areas of the TA. The support of different areas is presented in the
response of +GCAP command. Each area can be presented by the selection command
name of a specific capability area (e.g. +FCLASS for fax support) or some
other predefined response. For instance, a GSM TA with fax capabilities could
respond as follows:
AT+GCAP
+GCAP: +CGSM,+FCLASS,+W
OK
The first supported area in the response is presented with +CGSM. It is the
response text to show that some or all GSM commands of the present document
are supported. Second response text (+FCLASS) informs that some fax or voice
capabilities are present, and the third text (+W) about the presence of
wireless commands as specified by PCCA STD‑101 [17]. Command +FCLASS=? (refer
e.g. ITU‑T Recommendation T.31 [11] and ITU‑T Recommendation T.32 [12]) can be
used to query the supported fax capabilities and +WS46=? to query the wireless
data services available:
AT+FCLASS=?;+WS46=?
0,1,2,2.0
(12)
OK
The TA of this example supports GSM data services, and fax service class 1
(TIA‑578‑A), 2 (manufacturer specific) and 2.0 (ITU‑T Recommendation T.32 [12]
/ TIA‑592).
The present document defines commands for MT identification which are similar
to those for TA identification in ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14], for an
example:
AT+CGMI
Mobile Manufacturer XYZ
OK
AT+CGMM
GSM Phone 1234
OK
AT+CGMR
1.00
OK
AT+CGSN
123456121234561
OK
Manufacturer, model and version commands work similarly as for TA, except that
the serial number query returns the International Mobile Station Equipment
Identity (IMEI) number. IMEI is fifteen digits long and consists of a type
approval code, a final assembly code, a serial number and a spare digit (refer
3GPP TS 23.003 [7]). When the TA is implemented inside MT, the responses for
both TA and MT queries will most likely follow the responses of MT
identification.
# 6 Call control commands and methods
## 6.0 General
This clause describes the control of calls. Normal data and fax call control
is done as in ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14], ITU‑T Recommendation T.31 [11]
and ITU‑T Recommendation T.32 [12]. For voice call originating, refer clause
\"ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 dial command D\" and clause \"Commands for
enhanced support of dialling\".
## 6.1 Select type of address +CSTA
Table 11: +CSTA parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Possible response(s) +CSTA=[\]  
+CSTA? +CSTA: \ +CSTA=? +CSTA: (list of supported \s)
* * *
**Description**
Set command selects the type of number for further dialling commands (D)
according to 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
Read command returns the current value of \.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.
**Defined values**
\: type of address octet in integer format (refer 3GPP TS 24.008 [8]
clause 10.5.4.7); default 145 when dialling string includes international
access code character \"+\", otherwise 129.
**Implementation**
Mandatory when other than default value allowed.
## 6.2 ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14] dial command D
ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14] dial command D lists characters that may be
used in a dialling string for making a call or controlling supplementary
services in accordance with 3GPP TS 22.030 [19]. Their use is listed in this
clause, as well as new dial modifiers are introduced. For an MT supporting AT
commands only, it is mandatory to support the control of supplementary
services in accordance with 3GPP TS 22.030 [19] through the dial command or
through the specific supplementary service commands (+CCFC, +CLCK, etc.),
where 3GPP TS 22.030 [19] identifies the supplementary services as mandatory.
See also the AT commands for enhanced support of dialling as well as +CMCCS
and +CLCCS.
**V.250 dialling digits**
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 * # + A B C (implementation of these characters is
mandatory)
D (implementation of this character is optional, and it is ignored)
**V.250 modifier characters**
, (implementation of this character is mandatory, but it may be ignored)
T P (implementation of these characters is mandatory, but they are ignored)
! W @ (implementation of these characters is optional, and they are ignored)
**V.250 semicolon character**
When semicolon character is given after dialling digits (or modifiers), a
voice call originated to the given address. TA returns to command state
immediately (or after possible +COLP result code; refer clause \"Connected
line identification presentation +COLP\"). Refer Annex G for a detailed
example.
**Modifier characters**
> (refer clause \"Direct dialling from phonebooks\")
I or i (override the CLIR supplementary service subscription default value for
this call; I = invocation (restrict CLI presentation) and i = suppression
(allow CLI presentation); refer clause \"Calling line identification
restriction +CLIR\").
G or g (control the CUG supplementary service information for this call; uses
index and info values set with command +CCUG or +CECUG; refer clause \"Closed
user group +CCUG\" and clause \"Enhanced closed user group +CECUG\").
## 6.3 Direct dialling from phonebooks
MT and SIM/UICC can contain phonebooks which have a phone number and an
alphanumeric field for each phonebook entry location. The use of ITU‑T
Recommendation V.250 [14] dialling command ensures that direct dialling from
MT and SIM/UICC phonebook is possible through ordinary communications software
which just gives the phone number field to be filled and then use the D
command to originate the call. Available memories may be queried with Select
Phonebook Storage test command +CPBS=?, and location range for example with
Read Phonebook Entries test command +CPBR=?.
**Execute commands**
1\. D>\[I][G][;] originate call to phone number which corresponding
alphanumeric field is \ (if possible, all available memories should be
searched for the correct entry).
2\. D>_mem_ \[I][G][;] originate call to phone number in memory _mem_ entry
location \ (available memories may be queried with Select Phonebook Storage
test command +CPBS=?; _mem_ could be e.g. ME).
3\. D>\[I][G][;] originate call to phone number in entry location \ (it
is manufacturer specific which memory storage of MT, SIM/UICC in the currently
selected card slot and TA is used; command Select Phonebook Memory Storage
+CPBS setting is recommended to be used).
Semicolon character shall be added when voice call is originated. CLIR and CUG
per call base modifiers may also be present.
**Responses**
Possible error responses include +CME ERROR: \ when error is related to
MT functionality. Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values. Otherwise TA
responses can have values defined by ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14] and
commands Service Reporting Control +CR and Connected Line Identification
Presentation +COLP. Detailed error report of an unsuccessful originated call
failed in the network error can be obtained with command Extended Error Report
+CEER (if implemented).
**Defined values**
\: string type value, which should equal to an alphanumeric field in at
least one phonebook entry in the searched memories; used character set should
be the one selected with command select TE character set +CSCS.
\: integer type memory location should be in the range of locations
available in the memory used.
**Implementation**
Mandatory when direct dialling is implemented. Also phonebook commands
implementation is required.
## 6.4 Call mode +CMOD
Table 12: +CMOD parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Possible response(s) +CMOD=[\]  
+CMOD? +CMOD: \ +CMOD=? +CMOD: (list of supported \s)
* * *
**Description**
Set command selects the call mode of further dialling commands (D) or for next
answering command (A). Mode can be either single or alternating (in the
present document, terms \"alternating mode\" and \"alternating call\" refer to
all GSM/UMTS bearer and teleservices that incorporate more than one basic
service (voice, data, fax) within one call). When single mode is selected the
call originating and hangup procedures are similar to procedures specified in
ITU‑T Recommendations V.250 [14], T.31 [11] and T.32 [12]. In GSM/UMTS there
can be voice followed by data (refer 3GPP TS 22.002 [1]), alternating
voice/data (refer 3GPP TS 22.002 [1]) and alternating voice/fax calls (refer
3GPP TS 22.003 [2]). See following clauses for alternating call control
methods.
Read command returns the current value of \.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.
NOTE: +CMOD shall be set to zero after a successfully completed alternating
mode call. It shall be set to zero also after a failed answering. The
power‑up, factory (&F) and user resets (Z) shall also set the value to zero.
This reduces the possibility that alternating mode calls are originated or
answered accidentally.
**Defined values**
\: integer type
[0]{.underline} single mode
1 alternating voice/fax (teleservice 61)
2 alternating voice/data (bearer service 61)
3 voice followed by data (bearer service 81)
all other values below 128 are reserved by the present document.
**Implementation**
Mandatory when alternating mode calls are implemented in the TA.
## 6.4A Voice call mode +CVMOD
Table 13: +CVMOD parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Possible response(s) +CVMOD=[\]  
+CVMOD? +CVMOD:  _\ _ +CVMOD=? +CVMOD: (list of supported
\s)
* * *
**Description**
Set command selects the voice call mode for making a Mobile Originated voice
call from the UE. The voice call mode can be CS_ONLY, VOIP_ONLY, CS_PREFERRED
or VOIP_PREFERRED. Type of VoIP session preferred (e.g. SIP VoIP, IMS VoIP) is
manufacturer specific issue.
NOTE 1: If the Call Mode is set to CS_ONLY, then the ATD command will make a
call in CS mode.
If the Call Mode is set to VOIP_ONLY, then the ATD command will make a call in
VoIP mode.
If the Call Mode is set to CS_PREFERRED, then the ATD command gives preference
for CS based voice call.
If the Call Mode is set to VOIP_PREFERRED, then the ATD command gives
preference for VoIP based voice call
NOTE 2: As an alternative to the ATD command, the command Dial URI +CDU can be
used if supported.
NOTE 3: The preferences are not applicable for the emergency call.
NOTE 4: The preferences are not applicable if operator has set preferences for
UE originated calls/sessions, 3GPP TS 24.216 [75] clause 5.6.
Read command returns the current value of \.
Test command returns the values supported by the UE as a compound value.
**Defined values**
\: integer type. The default value is manufacturer specific.
0 CS_ONLY
1 VOIP_ONLY
2 CS_PREFERRED
3 VOIP_PREFERRED
**Implementation**
Optional.
## 6.5 Hangup call +CHUP
Table 13a: +CHUP action command syntax
* * *
Command Possible response(s) +CHUP  
+CHUP=?
* * *
**Description**
Execution command causes the TA to hangup the current call of the MT.
NOTE: The purpose of this command is not to replace the ITU‑T Recommendation
V.250 [14] command H, but to give an assured procedure to terminate an
alternating mode call. Refer next clause.
**Implementation**
Mandatory when alternating mode calls implemented in the TA.
## 6.6 Alternating mode call control method
This clause describes the procedure to handle alternating mode calls with AT
commands. Procedures are mandatory when alternating mode calls are implemented
in the TA.
NOTE 1: ATH and drop DTR will not necessarily cause a hangup from voice mode.
If the +CVHU is implemented the behaviour shall be controlled by its setting.
**Voice followed by data call (bearer service 81)**
Figure 4 shows commands to start the call, to switch from voice to data
(In‑Call Modification) and to hang up the call. +CMOD and +FCLASS commands
indicate the current settings before dialling or answering command, not that
they shall be given just before D or A command. Refer clause \"Cellular result
codes +CRC\" for possible +CRING result code values. Refer Annex F for a
detailed example.
Figure 4: Voice followed by data call
**Voice/ data call (bearer service number 61)**
Figure 5 shows the commands to start the call, to switch between modes
(In‑Call Modification) and to hang up the call. +CMOD and +FCLASS commands
indicate the current settings before dialling or answering command, not that
they shall be given just before D or A command. Refer clause \"Cellular result
codes +CRC\" for possible +CRING result code values. Refer Annex E for a

**Description**
Radio link protocol (RLP) parameters used when non-transparent data calls are
originated may be altered with set command. Available command subparameters
depend on the RLP versions implemented by the device (e.g. \ may not be
available if device supports only versions 0 and 1).
NOTE 1: If radio link protocol is not used, but some other error correcting
protocol (for transparent data calls), ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14] Error
Control Selection test command +ES=? may be used to indicate the presence of
the protocol.
Read command returns current settings for each supported RLP version \. Only RLP parameters applicable to the corresponding \ are
returned.
Test command returns values supported as compound values. If MT/TA supports
several RLP versions \, the RLP parameter value ranges for each
\ are returned on a separate line.
**Defined values**
\, \: RLP version number in integer format; when version
indication is not present it shall equal 0
NOTE 2: Versions 0 and 1 share the same parameter set. Read and test commands
shall return only one line for this set (where \ is not present).
\, \, \, \, \: IWF to MS window size, MS to IWF window
size, acknowledgement timer T1, retransmission attempts N2, re-sequencing
period T4 in integer format (default values and value ranges depend on RLP
version; refer 3GPP TS 24.022 [18]): T1 and T4 are in units of 10 ms.
**Implementation**

* * *
**Description**
Enabled command returns intermediate result code +CHSR: \ from the TA to
the TE when an HSCSD call is being set up. The result code represents the
current (negotiated or renegotiated) HSCSD parameters. If enabled, the
intermediate result code is transmitted at the point of the call setup
negotiation where the TA has determined what type of an HSCSD connection will
be used. Result code transmission is done after possible service (+CR), error
control (+ER), and/or compression (+DR) reporting but before possible TE-TA
rate (+ILRR) reporting and before the intermediate result code CONNECT is
transmitted. The format of the intermediate result code is:
+CHSR: \,\,\,\
For the value definitions, refer to +CHSN and +CHSC commands. For instance,
for a non-transparent HSCSD call, result code \'+CHSR: 2,2,4,8\' means that
the call has two timeslots in both up- and downlink, the air interface user
rate is 28800 bps, and the used channel coding TCH/F14.4.
For HSCSD in UTRAN, all non-applicable parameters returned shall be equal to
zero.
Read command returns the current value of \.
Test command returns the values supported by the UE as a compound value.

**Description**
Set command controls whether or not automatic user initiated service level
upgrading shall be used for non-transparent HSCSD calls. \"Automatic\" means
that, if enabled, the ME/TA shall use the UP bit in the received RLP frames to
determine when to initiate user initiated service level upgrading (i.e. when
to modify the +CHSN parameters \ and/or \ for the current call).
Refer to 3GPP TS 27.001 [41] for details on the interpretation of the UP
bit(s).
Read command returns the current value of \.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.
NOTE 1: The validity of the UP bit in the RLP frames depends on the result of
the RLP negotiations. The UP bit shall only be used if the result of the RLP
negotiations were successful with respect to the UP bit.
NOTE 2: This command is only applicable in GERAN.

## 6.29 Informative examples
The alternating mode call handling (voice and fax, or voice and data) and the
data call setup commands are defined such that the dialling command of ITU‑T
Recommendation V.250 [14] (D) still always originates a call. The purpose is
to support all current TE applications using the dialling command as default.
Fax calls are controlled following the rules of ITU‑T Recommendation T.31 [11]
and ITU‑T Recommendation T.32 [12] standards.
An example where a voice call is originated:
ATD+1 812 555673I; (type of address defaults to 145, CLI presentation is
restricted for this call)
OK (call setup was successful)
An example where a voice call is attempted from a phonebook:
ATD>\"Doe Joe\"G; (enable CUG control for this call)
+CME ERROR: 22 (entry \"Doe Joe\" is not found)
Also supplementary services can be controlled using dial command according to
3GPP TS 22.030 [19]. An example of call forwarding on no reply for telephony
with the adjustment of the no reply condition timer on 25 seconds:
ATD**61*+1812555673*11*25#
OK (modification was successful)
Two new commands are created for controlling the alternating mode calls. First
one, Call Mode (+CMOD), selects between single and alternating mode. Because
this is a crucial command, it is defined that the value is set back to zero
(single mode) after every successfully originated alternating mode call. Also
on power‑up and factory or user resets, the value is set to zero. The second
new command, Hangup Call (+CHUP), is not a replacement of ITU‑T Recommendation
V.250 [14] command H, but a command which reliably disconnects the call in
GSM/UMTS network. This is defined because the H command is used to switch from
fax or data mode to voice mode.
The setting of GSM/UMTS bearer service (data circuit duplex asynchronous and
synchronous, PAD access circuit asynchronous, or data packet duplex
synchronous), is done with Select Bearer Service Type (+CBST). It chooses one
of the four mentioned bearer services, the data rate of the service (or
actually the modulation when modem IWFs are used), and enables or disables
RLP. Command Radio Link Protocol (+CRLP) is used to set the RLP parameters in
the radio path.
Service Reporting Control command (+CR) is defined similarly as the reporting
of modulation, V.18, error control, and data compression which are ITU‑T
Recommendation V.250 [14] features used to show information about the type of
the established connection before the CONNECT intermediate result code. +CR
command has one subparameter which specifies whether the intermediate result
code +CR: \ is returned or not. The result code is typically returned
before any ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14] reporting result codes. An example
of setting up an asynchronous 9600 bit/s modem connection with service
reporting:
AT+CBST=7,0,1 (asynchronous modem 9600 bit/s and RLP)
OK
AT+CR=1 (enable reporting)
OK
ATD1234567890
+CR: REL ASYNC
CONNECT 9600
As GSM/UMTS network offers more information about the reason of the failure in
call originating and answering than normal PSTN, it is useful to add an extra
command to return this information to the TE. This information should not be
returned always after unsuccessful call originating or answering, because many
TE applications look for just the regular NO CARRIER, BUSY, NO ANSWER and
CONNECT messages. Action command Extended Error Report (+CEER) does not have
any subparameters, and it returns the cause of the latest call setup failure.
This information can be the textual presentation of the GSM/UMTS network
failure code (refer 3GPP TS 24.008 [8] Annex H), or some other information
defined by the TA manufacturer.

**Description**
Set command forces an attempt to select and register to the GSM/UMTS/EPS/5GS
network operator using the SIM/USIM card installed in the currently selected
card slot. \ is used to select whether the selection is done
automatically by the MT or is forced by this command to operator \ (it
shall be given in format \) to a certain access technology, indicated
in \. \ indicates if the registration procedure shall be
performed for disaster roaming service (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [161]). If
\ is not included then the UE performs a normal registration i.e. a
registration not for disaster roaming service (see 3GPP TS 24.501 [161]). If
the selected operator is not available, no other operator shall be selected
(except \=4). If the selected access technology is not available, then
the same operator shall be selected in other access technology. The selected
operator name format shall apply to further read commands (+COPS?) also.
\=2 forces an attempt to deregister from the network. The selected mode
affects to all further network registration (e.g. after \=2, MT shall be
unregistered until \=0 or 1 is selected). Refer clause 9.2 for possible
\ values. This command should be abortable when
registration/deregistration attempt is made.
Read command returns the current mode, the currently selected operator and the
current Access Technology. If no operator is selected, \, \ and
\ are omitted.
Test command returns a set of five parameters, each representing an operator
present in the network. A set consists of an integer indicating the
availability of the operator \, long and short alphanumeric format of
the name of the operator, numeric format representation of the operator and
access technology. Any of the formats may be unavailable and should then be an
empty field. The list of operators shall be in order: home network, networks
referenced in SIM or active application in the UICC (GSM or USIM) in the
following order: HPLMN selector, User controlled PLMN selector, Operator
controlled PLMN selector and PLMN selector (in the SIM or GSM application),
and other networks.
It is recommended (although optional) that after the operator list TA returns
lists of supported \s and \s. These lists shall be delimited
from the operator list by two commas.
The access technology selected parameters, \, should only be used in
terminals capable to register to more than one access technology. Selection of
\ does not limit the capability to cell reselections, even though an
attempt is made to select an access technology, the phone may still re-select
a cell in another access technology.

* * *
Command Possible response(s) +CUSD=[\[,\[,\]]] _+CME ERROR: \
_ +CUSD? +CUSD: \ +CUSD=? +CUSD: (list of supported \s)
* * *
**Description**
This command allows control of the Unstructured Supplementary Service Data
(USSD) according to 3GPP TS 22.090 [23], 3GPP TS 24.090 [148] and 3GPP TS
24.390 [131]. Both network and mobile initiated operations are supported.
Parameter \ is used to disable/enable the presentation of an unsolicited
result code. The value \=2 is used to cancel an ongoing USSD session. For
an USSD response from the network, or a network initiated operation, the
format is: +CUSD: \[,\,\].
NOTE 1: If the MT supports USSD according to 3GPP TS 24.090 [148] and USSD
according to 3GPP TS 24.390 [131] then the MT decides which to invoke. The
decision is out of scope of this specification.
When \ is given, a mobile initiated USSD‑string or a response USSD‑string
to a network initiated operation is sent to the network. The response
USSD‑string from the network is returned in a subsequent unsolicited +CUSD
result code. Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
NOTE 2: In case of successful mobile initiated operation, TA implemented
according to a version prior to 6 of this standard, waits the USSD response
from the network and sends it to the TE before the final result code. This
will block the AT command interface for the period of the operation. Such TA
does not support \ value 2.
The interaction of this command with other commands based on other
supplementary services is described in the specification of the relevant
supplementary service.
Read command returns the current value of \.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.
**Defined values**
\: integer type (sets/shows the result code presentation status to the TE).
[0]{.underline} disable the result code presentation to the TE
1 enable the result code presentation to the TE
2 cancel session (not applicable to read command response)
\: string type USSD‑string (when \ parameter is not given, network
is not interrogated):
‑ if \ indicates that 3GPP TS 23.038 [25] 7 bit default alphabet is used:
‑ if TE character set other than \"HEX\" (refer command select TE character
set +CSCS): MT/TA converts GSM alphabet into current TE character set
according to rules of 3GPP TS 27.005 [24] Annex A
‑ if TE character set is \"HEX\": MT/TA converts each 7‑bit character of GSM
alphabet into two IRA character long hexadecimal number (e.g. character Π (GSM
23) is presented as 17 (IRA 49 and 55))
‑ if \ indicates that 8‑bit data coding scheme is used: MT/TA converts
each 8‑bit octet into two IRA character long hexadecimal number (e.g. octet
with integer value 42 is presented to TE as two characters 2A (IRA 50 and 65))
\- if \ indicates that 16-bit data coding scheme (UCS2) is used: MT/TA
splits the 16 bits into two 8-bit octets. Each of those octets are converted
as per the 8-bit data coding scheme, with the most significant octet first
(e.g. decimal value 4906 is presented to TE as four characters 132A (IRA 49,
51, 50 and 65))
\: integer type (shows Cell Broadcast Data Coding Scheme, see 3GPP TS
23.038 [25]). Default value is 0.
\: integer type (shows the USSD response from the network or the network
initiated operation).
0 no further user action required (network initiated USSD‑Notify, or no
further information needed after mobile initiated operation)

**Description**
This refers to Advice of Charge supplementary service (3GPP TS 22.024 [26] and
3GPP TS 22.086 [27]) that enables subscriber to get information about the cost
of calls. With \=0, the execute command returns the current call meter
value from the MT.
The command also includes the possibility to enable/disable reporting of the
CCM information with unsolicited result code +CCCM: \. When enabled, this
unsolicited result code is sent when the CCM value changes, but not more
frequently than at every 10 seconds.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
NOTE: Advice of Charge values stored in the SIM card or in the active
application in the UICC (GSM or USIM) (ACM, ACMmax, PUCT) can be accessed with
generic or restricted SIM access command (+CSIM or +CRSM)). Those values can
be more readily accessed with commands +CACM, +CAMM and +CPUC.

**Description**
This command refers to supplementary service related network initiated
notifications. The set command enables/disables the presentation of
notification result codes from TA to TE.
When \=1 and a supplementary service notification is received after a
mobile originated call setup, intermediate result code +CSSI:
\[,[\][,\]] is sent to TE before any other MO call
setup result codes presented in the present document or in ITU‑T
Recommendation V.250 [14]. When several different \s are received from
the network, each of them shall have its own +CSSI result code.
NOTE: If the supplemenary service notification is available in the TE after
reception of the final response to the call setup, +CSSI is not returned as an
intermediate result code but as an unsolicited result code.
When \=1 and a supplementary service notification is received during a
mobile terminated call setup or during a call, or when a forward check
supplementary service notification is received, unsolicited result code +CSSU:
\[,\[,[\],[\][,[\],[\]][,\]]]
is sent to TE. In case of MT call setup, result code is sent after every +CLIP
result code (refer command Calling line identification presentation +CLIP) and
when several different \s are received from the network, each of them
shall have its own +CSSU result code. \=5 does not reflect any
supplementary service, and the parameter \ will not be provided.
The supplementary service notification can also be reported in unsolicited
result codes +CMCCSS\_ / +CMCCSSEND, enabled with +CMCCS=3 (see AT
command monitor of current calls +CMCCS). The unsolicited result codes
+CMCCSS\_ / +CMCCSSEND support numbers of the SIP URI format.

**Description**
This command is used to edit the PLMN selector with Access Technology lists in
the SIM card or active application in the UICC (GSM or USIM).
Execute command writes an entry in the SIM/USIM list of preferred PLMNs,
previously selected by the command +CPLS. If no list has been previously
selected, the User controlled PLMN selector with Access Technology,
EF~PLMNwAcT,~ is the one accessed by default. If \ is given but \
is left out, entry is deleted. If \ is given but \ is left out,
\ is put in the next free location. If only \ is given, the
format of the \ in the read command is changed. The Access Technology
selection parameters, \, \, \,
\ and \ are required when writing User controlled
PLMN selector with Access Technology, EF~PLMNwAcT~, Operator controlled PLMN
selector with Access Technology EF~OPLMNwAcT~ and HPLMN selector with Access
Technology EF~HPLMNwAcT~, see 3GPP TS 31.102 [59]. Refer clause 9.2 for
possible \ values.
NOTE 1: MT can also update the User controlled PLMN selector with Access
Technology, EF~PLMNwAcT~, automatically when new networks are selected.
NOTE 2: The Operator controlled PLMN selector with Access Technology
EF~OPLMNwAcT~, can only be written if the write access condition in the
SIM/USIM has been previously verified.
Read command returns all used entries from the SIM/USIM list of preferred

**Description**
This command allows control of the Closed User Group supplementary service
(refer 3GPP TS 22.085 [21] and 3GPP TS 24.654 [121]). Set command enables the
served subscriber to create a number of \s that each define a
\ and a \ to define how the preferential CUG and the
Outgoing Access (OA) is handled for outgoing calls.
Set command with \=0 disable settings in the MT and use the subscribed
settings, while \=1 enables to control the CUG information on the air
interface as adjustments for outgoing calls according to the settings defined
by the parameters \s, \ and \. For calls
initated using the dial command D, the dial string modifiers \'G\' or \'g\'
can not indicate a \ and the \ and \ as
defined for \=1 shall be used.
NOTE 1: On a per call basis CUG functionality is explained in the clauses
\"ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14] dial command D\" and \"Dial URI +CDU\".
A special form of the set command, +CECUG=\,\ causes the value
of \ and \ for the CUG pointer \ to become
undefined. The set command, +CECUG=0 that can be used to disable the CUG
temporary mode will not make previously defined CUG pointers and the
corresponding defined \ and \ undefined.
The read command returns the current settings for each defined CUG pointer.
The test command returns values supported as compound values.
**Defined values**
\: integer type. This parameter sets CUG activation on a per call basis.
0 disable CUG temporary mode. All calls initiated using the dial command D or
+CDU use the subscribed CUG settings. The parameters \ and
\ are ignored at call initiation. For calls initated using the dial
command D, the dial string modifiers \'G\' or \'g\' have no effect (see clause
\"ITU T Recommendation V.250 [14] dial command D\"). For calls initated using
+CDU, the parameter \ has no effect (see clause \"Dial URI
+CDU\").
1 enable CUG temporary mode. Values for \ and \ are
applied for:
\- all calls initiated using the dial command D where the dial modifier \'G\'
or \'g\' (see clause \"ITU T Recommendation V.250 [14] dial command D\") is
present as part of the dial string.
\- all calls initated using +CDU where parameter \ is set to 1
(see clause \"Dial URI +CDU\")
If \'G\' or \'g\' is not applied (for the dial command D) or \ is
set to 0 (for +CDU) \ and \ are ignored. In that case
only the subscribed CUG settings apply.
\: integer type. A numeric parameter which specifies a particular
set of CUG data. The \ is local to the TE-MT interface and
identifies a particular \ and \ which indicates per call
basis changes provided to the supplementary service closed user group. The
range of permitted values is from 1-n. The maximum value of n is
implementation specific.
NOTE 2: 3GPP TS 22.085 [21] indicates that each individual subscriber can be a
member of a maximum of 10 CUGs.
\: string type. The parameter sets the CUG index for this
\.
\"0\" ... \"32767\" CUG index
\"\" no CUG index, indicated by empty string. Preferential CUG taken from
subscriber data.
\: integer type. The parameter sets the CUG information for this

**Description**
Set command forces an attempt to select and register to the CSG Cell in
UMTS/EPS network. \ is used to determine whether the selection is done
automatically by the MT or is forced by this command to select CSG Cell in
CSGinfo \ (it shall be given in format \) to a certain access
technology, indicated in \. If the selected access technology is not
available, then the same CSG id and associated PLMN shall be selected in other
access technology. If the selected CSG cell is not available in all supported
RATs, then MT shall follow the procedures described in 3GPP TS 23.122 clause
4.4.3.1.3. The selected CSG info format shall apply to further read commands
(+CCSGS?) also. \=0 forces an attempt to register to the CSG cell in
UMTS/EPS network. \=1 forces an attempt to do manual CSG selection to a
CSG cell as per information in CGSinfo \.\.
This command is used when the ME performs successfully registered to a PLMN
i.e. the UE executed Operator Selection (+COPS) command successfully.
Read command returns the current CSG selection mode, the currently selected
CSG Cell information \ and the current Access Technology. If ME is
not camped on CSG Cell when read command is issued, +CME ERROR: XX (Not camped
on CSG Cell) shall be issued.
Test command returns a set of four parameters. A set consists of an integer
indicating the availability of the CSG in Operator CSG list or Allowed CSG
list \, alphanumeric format of the CSG Type, HNB name, CSG ID and
Associated PLMN MCC MNC\, numeric format representation of the CSG ID
and Asssociated PLMN MCC MNC \ and access technology \.
\ consist of CSGType (if available from SIM), HNB name, CSG ID each
delimited by comma. CSG Type shall provide the type of a CSG identity in a
human readable form. See 3GPP TS 22.011 [170], 3GPP TS 23.003 [7] for details
of CSG Type, HNB name and CSG ID representation. Any of the formats may be
unavailable and should then be an empty field. The list of found CSG\'s shall
be in order: CSG\'s in the Operator CSG list, CSG\'s in the Allowed CSG list,
other CSG\'s.
It is recommended (although optional) that after the CSG list TA returns lists
of supported \s and \s. These lists shall be delimited from the
CSG list by two commas.
The access technology selected parameters, \, should only be used in
terminals capable to support CSG selection in more than one access technology.
Selection of \ does not limit the capability to cell reselections, even

## 7.45 Informative examples
This clause includes all the GSM/UMTS supplementary service related commands,
additional commands to lock MT and SIM/UICC capabilities, and commands to
check the network registration status.
An example where MSISDNs of a MT are queried, calls are forwarded to different
numbers when mobile is busy (CFB) or when it does not answer (CFNRy). The
status of CFNRy is read:
AT+CNUM
+CNUM: ,\"+358501234567\",145,,4 (voice number)
OK
AT+CCFC=1,1,\"931123456\" (enable CFB)
OK
AT+CCFC=2,1,\"921654321\" (enable CFNRy)
OK
AT+CCFC=1,2 (query CFNRy)
+CCFC: 1,7,\"+35821654321\",145,,,20 (forward after 20 seconds)
OK
An example of Call Waiting (+CCWA), Call Related Supplementary Services
(+CHLD), and Connected Line Identification Presentation (+COLP) usage:
AT+CCWA=1,1;+COLP=1 (enable call waiting and COLP result codes)
OK
ATD9311234567; (originate a voice call)
+COLP: \"+358311234567\",145
OK
...conversation...
+CCWA: \"+358317654321\",145 (another call is waiting)
AT+CHLD=2 (put first call on hold and answer the second one)
OK
...conversation...
AT+CHLD=1 (release the second (active) call and recover the first (held) call)
OK
ATH (release the first call)
OK
Call barring supplementary services are combined in one command, Facility Lock
(+CLCK), which is also used to restrict MT and SIM/UICC functionality Some of
the facilities require a password when enabled or disabled. An additional
command, Change Password (+CPWD), is defined for changing the password of
different barring and restriction facilities. An example where locking status
of outgoing international calls is interrogated and then barred, and the
password of the SIM/UICC card lock (Personal Identity Number, PIN) is changed:
AT+CLCK=\"OI\",2
+CLCK: 0,7
OK
AT+CLCK=\"OI\",1,\"1234\"
OK
AT+CPWD=\"SC\",\"4321\",\"1234\"
OK
Operator Selection (+COPS) command is used for querying the status of all
GSM/UMTS operators detected in the area, and switching between operators.
Following example illustrates a network selection sequence in Finland. Two
operators are found, the status of Tele is unknown and Radiolinja is currently
selected. Read command shows that automatic selection mode is on and that
Radiolinja is selected. Then an attempt is made to access Tele, but it is
denied (shown by +CME ERROR).
AT+COPS=?
+COPS: (2,\"RADIOLINJA\",\"RL\",\"24405\"),(0,\"TELE\",\"TELE\",\"24491\")
OK
AT+COPS?
+COPS: 0,0,\"RADIOLINJA\"
OK
AT+COPS=1,0,\"TELE\"
+CME ERROR: 3
When a terminal wanders between countries (i.e. networks), an application may
follow this e.g. with the following scenario:
AT+CREG=1 (enable +CREG: \ unsolicited result code)
OK
AT+CREG?
+CREG: 1,1 (MT is registered in home PLMN)
OK
AT+COPS=3,2;+COPS?;+COPS=3,0;+COPS?
+COPS: 0,2,\"24405\" (get the country...
+COPS: 0,0,\"RADIOLINJA\" ...and operator name)
OK
...user wanders to another PLMN...
+CREG: 2 (deregistered, roaming ongoing)
+CREG: 5 (registered again, not home PLMN)
AT+COPS=3,2;+COPS?;+COPS=3,0;+COPS?
+COPS: 0,2,\"24001\" (get the country...
+COPS: 0,0,\"TELIA MOBITEL\" ...and operator name)
OK
...user loses connection, no other PLMNs around...
+CREG: 0
An example of eMLPP Supplementary Service usage for a ptp voice call:
ATD*752#+436644101453; (originate a voice call with the priority level 2, see
for priority level definitions GSM 02.30)
OK (call setup was successful)
# 8 Mobile termination control and status commands
## 8.0 General
This clause includes commands for MT power, keypad, touch screen, display and
indicator handling. Also commands for selecting, reading and writing of
phonebooks, and setting real‑time clock facilities are specified. Two commands
are specified for accessing SIM/UICC database records in a general way.
Figure 7 illustrates the effect of these commands. Command Phone Activity
Status +CPAS indicates the current general activity status of the MT. Command
Set Phone Functionality +CFUN is used to set the MT to different power
consumption states. Command Enter PIN +CPIN is used to enter MT passwords
which are needed before any other functionality of the MT can be used (e.g.
SIM PIN, PUK). Commands Generic SIM Access +CSIM and Restricted SIM Access
+CRSM can be used to access all data in SIM/UICC. Commands Battery Charge +CBC
and Signal Quality +CSQ are same as in TIA IS‑135 [16] and they are used to
query the battery charge of the MT and the current RSSI of the MT. Command
Mobile Termination Control Mode +CMEC is used to select the controlling unit
of MT keypad, display touch screen, and indicators. Controlling commands for
the TE are Keypad Emulation +CKPD, Display Control +CDIS, Touch Screen
Emulation +CTSA, and Indicator Control +CIND. If corresponding event reporting
is enabled with command Mobile Termination Event Reporting +CMER, +CKEV is the
result code of a keypad event, +CDEV is the result code of a display event,
+CTEV is the result code of a touch screen event, +COEV is the result code of
a display orientation event, and +CIEV is the result code of an indicator
event. Phonebook commands are Select Phonebook Memory Storage +CPBS, Read
Phonebook Entries +CPBR, Find Phonebook Entries +CPBF and Write Phonebook
Entry +CPBW. Additional command Clock +CCLK can be used to control the
real‑time clock of the MT if available. Command Alarm +CALA sets possible
alarm clock facilities of the MT.

**Description**
Set command sends to the MT a password which is necessary before it can be
operated (SIM PIN, SIM PUK, PH‑SIM PIN, etc.). If the PIN is to be entered
twice, the TA shall automatically repeat the PIN. If no PIN request is
pending, no action is taken towards MT and an error message, +CME ERROR, is
returned to TE. Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
NOTE 1: SIM PIN, SIM PUK, PH-SIM PIN, PH-FSIM PIN, PH-FSIM PUK, SIM PIN2 and
SIM PUK2 refer to the PIN of the selected application on the UICC. For
example, in an UTRAN context, the selected application on the currently
selected UICC should be a USIM and the SIM PIN then represents the PIN of the
selected USIM. See 3GPP TS 31.101 [65] for further details on application
selection on the UICC.
If the PIN required is SIM PUK or SIM PUK2, the second pin is required. This
second pin, \, is used to replace the old pin in the SIM.
NOTE 2: Commands which interact with MT that are accepted when MT is pending
SIM PIN, SIM PUK, or PH‑SIM are: +CGMI, +CGMM, +CGMR, +CGSN, D112; (emergency
call), +CPAS, +CFUN, +CPIN, +CPINR, +CDIS (read and test command only), and
+CIND (read and test command only). It is implementation specific whether
additional commands can be accepted when MT is pending SIM PIN, SIM PUK, or
PH‑SIM.

**Description**
Set command is used to write the contents of MT text type display elements. An
element can consist of one character or several characters. The order of
element parameters \ should follow the rule: first is the element in
upper left corner, second is the next element to the right and so on. The last
element is the element in lower right corner. The number of elements is MT
specific. If MT does not allow writing to its display or MT is not currently
reachable, +CME ERROR: \ is returned. Refer clause 9.2 for possible
\ values. If certain element is not writable, setting of it should be
ignored. If element parameter is empty field, element shall remain in the
previous value.
NOTE 1: This command cannot be used to write to a display which sum of element
lengths exceed the length of the command line buffer of the TA.
Read command returns the contents of MT display elements. If \ field is
empty (not empty string), MT does not allow the reading of corresponding
element. If MT is not currently reachable, +CME ERROR: \ is returned.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
Test command returns maximum length of each display element. If MT does not
offer the length of elements, \ fields should be empty. If MT is not
currently reachable, +CME ERROR: \ is returned. Refer clause 9.2 for
possible \ values.
NOTE 2: MT manufacturer should offer the order and maximum length of elements.

**Description**
Set command transmits to the MT the \ it then shall send as it is to
the SIM. In the same manner, the SIM \ shall be sent back by the MT
to the TA as it is. Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
This command allows a direct control of the SIM that is installed in the
currently selected card slot, by a distant application on the TE. The TE shall
then take care of processing SIM information within the frame specified by
GSM/UMTS.
NOTE: Compared to Restricted SIM Access command +CRSM, the definition of +CSIM
allows TE to take more control over the SIM‑MT interface. The locking and
unlocking of the interface may be done by a special \ value or
automatically by TA/MT (by interpreting \ parameter). In case that TE
application does not use the unlock command (or does not send a \
causing automatic unlock) in a certain timeout value, MT may release the
locking.
**Defined values**
\: integer type; length of the characters that are sent to TE in
\ or \ (two times the actual length of the command or
response)
\: command passed on by the MT to the SIM in the format as described
in 3GPP TS 51.011 [28] (hexadecimal character format; refer +CSCS)

**Description**
By using this command instead of Generic SIM Access +CSIM TE application has
easier but more limited access to the SIM database. Set command transmits to
the MT the SIM \ and its required parameters. If a SIM installed in
the currently selected card slot, the MT handles internally all SIM‑MT
interface locking and file selection routines. As response to the command, MT
sends the actual SIM information parameters and response data. MT error result
code +CME ERROR may be returned when the command cannot be passed to the SIM,
but failure in the execution of the command in the SIM is reported in \
and \ parameters. Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
Coordination of command requests to SIM and the ones issued by GSM/UMTS
application inside the MT is implementation dependent. However the TE should
be aware of the precedence of the GSM/UMTS application commands to the TE
commands.

\"7F205F70\" in SIM and UICC case). The \ shall only be used in the
mode \"select by path from MF\" as defined in ETSI TS 102 221 [60].
NOTE 3: Since valid elementary file identifiers may not be unique over all
valid dedicated file identifiers the \ indicates the targeted UICC/SIM
directory path in case of ambiguous file identifiers. For earlier versions of
this specification or if \ is omitted, it could be implementation
specific which one will be selected.
\, \: integer type; information from the SIM about the execution of
the actual command. These parameters are delivered to the TE in both cases, on
successful or failed execution of the command.
\: response of a successful completion of the command previously
issued (hexadecimal character format; refer +CSCS). STATUS and GET RESPONSE
return data, which gives information about the current elementary datafield.
This information includes the type of file and its size (refer 3GPP TS 51.011
[28]). After READ BINARY, READ RECORD or RETRIEVE DATA command the requested
data will be returned. \ is not returned after a successful UPDATE

**Description**
Set command informs TA that TE wants to establish a peer-to-peer protocol
\ or upper layer connection (indicating by the \s setting) with
the MT on the link from which the command was received. This command can be
used in case the link between TE and MT does not provide itself such a
mechanism.
If MT has succeeded in establishing a logical link between application
protocols and external interface, it will send CONNECT message to the TE.
Otherwise, the NO CARRIER response will be returned.
If the CONNECT response is received, TE can start sending \ or upper
layer frames.
The connection shall always return for \ mode when the protocol session
is ended. When the MT receives a disconnect request from its peer entity, it
will process it and send OK response to the TE indicating its capability for
receiving new AT commands. Since \ or upper layers can be accessed in
other ways, TA must have pre-knowledge of the fact that connection is
initiated with AT+CPROT command. This means that switch to \ mode must
include some sort of notification to the protocol entity.
This command can be aborted by sending a \ or upper layer disconnection
frame. In that case, MT will return in command mode by sending the OK
response.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
Test command returns values supported as compound values.

## 8.43 Generic UICC logical channel access +CGLA
Table 103: +CGLA action command syntax

**Description**
Set command transmits to the MT the \ it then shall send as it is to
the selected UICC. In the same manner the UICC \ shall be sent back
by the MT to the TA as it is. Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
This command allows a direct control of the currently selected UICC by a
distant application on the TE. The TE shall then take care of processing UICC
information within the frame specified by GSM/UMTS.
Although Generic UICC Logical Channel Access command +CGLA allows TE to take
control over the UICC‑MT interface, there are some functions of the UICC-MT
interface that logically do not need to be accessed from outside the TA/MT.
Moreover, for security reason the GSM network authentication should not be
handled outside the TA/MT. Therefore it shall not be allowed to execute a Run
GSM Algorithm command or an Authenticate command in GSM context from the TE
using +CGLA at all time whether the +CGLA is locked or unlocked. This shall
not forbid the TE to send Authenticate commands in other security contexts
(e.g. EAP security context).
For example, the TA/MT shall forbid the transfer of the Authenticate command
to a USIM application when parameters P2 = 0 (GSM security context). See 3GPP
TS 31.102 [59] for USIM authenticate command definition.
NOTE: Compared to Restricted UICC Access command +CRLA, the definition of
+CGLA allows TE to take more control over the UICC‑MT interface. The locking
and unlocking of the interface may be done by a special \ value or
automatically by TA/MT (by interpreting \ parameter). In case that TE
application does not use the unlock command (or does not send a \
causing automatic unlock) in a certain timeout value, MT may release the
locking.
**Defined values**
\: integer type; this is the identifier of the session to be used
in order to send the APDU commands to the UICC. It is manadatory in order to
send commands to the UICC when targeting applications on the smart card using
a logical channel other than the default channel (channel \"0\").
\: integer type; length of the characters that are sent to TE in
\ or \ (two times the actual length of the command or
response).
\: command passed on by the MT to the UICC in the format as described
in 3GPP TS 31.101 [65] (hexadecimal character format; refer +CSCS).
\: response to the command passed on by the UICC to the MT in the
format as described in 3GPP TS 31.101 [65] (hexadecimal character format;

**Description**
By using this command instead of Generic UICC Access +CGLA TE application has
easier but more limited access to the UICC database. Set command transmits to
the MT the UICC \ and its required parameters. MT handles internally,
for the selected UICC, all UICC‑MT interface locking and file selection
routines. As response to the command, MT sends the actual UICC information
parameters and response data. MT error result code +CME ERROR may be returned
when the command cannot be passed to the UICC, but failure in the execution of
the command in the UICC is reported in \ and \ parameters. Refer
clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
Coordination of command requests to UICC and the ones issued by GSM/UMTS
application inside the MT is implementation dependent. However the TE should
be aware of the precedence of the GSM/UMTS application commands to the TE
commands.
**Defined values**
\: integer type; this is the identifier of the session to be used
in order to send the APDU commands to the UICC. It is mandatory in order to
send commands to the UICC when targeting applications on the smart card using

the actual command. These parameters are delivered to the TE in both cases, on
successful or failed execution of the command.
\: response of a successful completion of the command previously
issued (hexadecimal character format; refer +CSCS). STATUS and GET RESPONSE
return data, which gives information about the current elementary datafield.
This information includes the type of file and its size (refer 3GPP TS 31.101
[65]). After READ BINARY, READ RECORD or RETRIEVE DATA command the requested
data will be returned. \ is not returned after a successful UPDATE

**Description**
Execution of the command causes the MT to return \ to allow the TE
to identify a channel that is being allocated by the currently selected UICC,
which is attached to ME. The currently selected UICC will open a new logical
channel; select the application identified by the \ received with this
command and return a session Id as the response. The ME shall restrict the
communication between the TE and the UICC to this logical channel.
This \ is to be used when sending commands with Restricted UICC
Logical Channel access +CRLA or Generic UICC Logical Channel access +CGLA
commands.
NOTE: The logical channel number is contained in the CLASS byte of an APDU
command, thus implicitly contained in all APDU commands sent to a UICC. In
this case it will be up to the MT to manage the logical channel part of the
APDU CLASS byte and to ensure that the chosen logical channel is relevant to
the \ indicated in the AT command. See 3GPP TS 31.101 [65] for
further information on logical channels in APDU commands protocol.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
**Defined values**

**Description**
This command allows a TE to exchange EAP packets with the UICC or the ME.
Prior to the execution of this command, the TE shall retrieve the available
AIDs using the +CUAD command. The TE shall select one appropriate AID to be
addressed. Selection may include asking the user, and considering EAP methods
supported by the AIDs. The TE shall set the \ value using the selected
AID and shall set the \ value to the requested EAP method. The TE
may set the \ value to the directory file identifier that is applicable
to the \; which is derived from the discretionary data returned by
+CUAD. The parameter is mandatory for EAP terminated in UICC.
If the targeted application on the UICC does support the requested EAP method,
the MT shall use the value provided in \, and it shall transmit the
\ to the UICC application using the Authenticate APDU command
as defined in ETSI TS 102 310 [66]. The appropriate DF~EAP~ in the ADF must be
selected prior to the submission of an EAP Authenticate command with the \. Then the EAP Response data sent by the UICC application in its
response to the Authenticate command shall be provided to the TE in \.
If the targeted application on the UICC does not support the requested EAP
method and if the MT does support this method then the \
shall be handled by the MT. During the handling of the EAP method, the MT
shall run the authentication algorithm on the SIM or USIM, respectively.
Also the MT has to allocate an \ in order to identify an EAP
session and its corresponding keys and parameters.
If neither the MT nor the appropriate UICC application support the requested
EAP method, the MT shall respond with +CME ERROR: 49 (EAP method not
supported).

SRVCC provides the ability to have a seamless handover of a voice call between
the PS domain and the CS domain for calls that are anchored in IMS, when the
UE is capable of transmitting/receiving on only one of those access networks
(PS or CS) at a given time, see 3GPP TS 23.221 [90] clause 7.2a, annex A.1 and
annex A.2. The SRVCC support also includes the support of 5G-SRVCC from NG-RAN
to UTRAN as specified in 3GPP TS 23.216 [171] clause 6.5.4.
Set command informs MT about the SRVCC Support. MT normally updates the
network when changing this parameter. Refer clause 9.2 for possible \
values.
Read command returns the status of the MT stored SRVCC Support.
Test command returns supported values as a compound value.
**Defined values**

**Description**
This command activates or deactivates a call monitoring function in the ME.
When this function is activated in the ME, the ME informs about events for
calls with unsolicited result codes.
The purpose of the call monitoring function is to:
1) gather relevant information for the detected calls in a TE; and
2) make it possible for the TE to display call state information for ongoing
calls.
The unsolicited result code+CMCCSI is used for basic call information.
+CMCCSI: \,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\
The unsolicited result code +CMCCSI is provided when \=2. For an
originating call, the parameters \, \ and \ in
+CMCCSI provide the number (line identity) information which has been dialled
with +CDU or ATD. For a terminating call, the parameters \, \
and \ in +CMCCSI provide the number (line identity) information of the
calling user.
The unsolicited result codes +CMCCSS\ / +CMCCSSEND are used for
supplementary service related information.
+CMCCSS1: \,\,\\ [+CMCCSS2:
\,\,\]\ [+CMCCSS3: \]\ [+CMCCSS4:
\]\ [+CMCCSS5: \,\]\ [+CMCCSS6: \]\
[+CMCCSS7: \]\ [+CMCCSS8: \]\ +CMCCSSEND
The unsolicited result codes +CMCCSS\ / +CMCCSSEND are used for
supplementary service related information and are reported when \=3. For
every supplementary service related event, the unsolicited result codes
+CMCCSS\ shall be given in consecutive order, and the sequence of
unsolicited result codes shall be terminated by +CMCCSSEND. It is manufacturer
specific when and if this additional service reporting will be issued.
Whenever a service event is to be reported using these unsolicited result
codes, the codes +CMCCSS1 and +CMCCSSEND are mandatory. +CMCCSS1 contains
essential information that is always needed (for example \) and
+CMCCSSEND indicates the end of this particular set of unsolicited result
codes. The other unsolicited result codes (+CMCCSS2 to +CMCCSSn) are optional,
intended to provide information related to a given service. E.g. for the
supplementary service CNAP, the unsolicited result code +CMCCSS4 (containing
\) may be issued. It is implementation specific which of the unsolicited
result codes +CMCCSS\_ / +CMCCSSEND that are supported and provided to
the TE. The unsolicited result codes should be provided to the TE as soon as
the information is available in the ME. The parameters \, \
and \ in +CMCCSS2 are, if applicable, normally the line identity
information that is related to the parameter \.
NOTE 1: For situations where ringing is applicable, the unsolicited result
codes +CMCCSS\ / +CMCCSSEND are typically returned after the first RING
(or +CRING: \; refer clause \"Cellular result codes +CRC\") result code
sent from TA to TE.
A subset of the information provided by the call monitoring function can be
provided by the command +CLCCS.
When the unsolicited result code +CMCCSI report that the \=1 (Idle),
the call identification number is reset and the call identification number
\ can be used by new calls. The logic for reuse of the parameter
\ is implementation specific.
Read command returns the current value of \.
Test command returns the values supported as a compound value.

**Description**
Set command is used to configure the availability of the radio accesses
inherently supported by the MT. E.g. in a GSM-only environment, other radio
access technologies could be disabled to reduce power-consumption. Settings
are persistent over a power-cycle. It is not supported to set all parameters
to indicate \"Radio access is disabled\", this will cause the MT to return
ERROR. +CSRA only configures the requested parameters; no change in the
transmit and receive RF circuits takes place by using +CSRA. The actual
execution of the configuration is obtained by using +CFUN=128.
Read command returns two lines of information text with two distinct prefixes:
\- a line prefixed with +CSRAC: displaying the currently configured +CSRA
settings. These values are not activated until +CFUN=128 is executed, and this
line does therefore not necessarily reflect the RATs currently activated on
the radio interface; and
\- a line prefixed with +CSRAA: displaying the RATs currently activ on the
radio interface.
Read command returns the current settings in the MT.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
Test command returns values supported by the MT as compound values. The
returned values do not reflect network capabilities.

## 8.83 Informative examples
Phone Activity Status (+CPAS) is a general command used to detect the presence
of the MT, if there is an incoming call, or if there is a call in progress.
This command is normally used before trying to operate the MT from the TE.
Note that the activity status can change at any time after the execution of
+CPAS, and hence the returned value can be obsolete. Detachment of the MT from
the TA is indicated with a special final result code that indicates all errors
related to the operation of the MT. Result code is +CME ERROR: \, where
\ is an integer or verbose value giving useful information about the
reason for the command failure (refer clause \"Mobile termination error result
code +CME ERROR\").
Set Phone Functionality (+CFUN) can be used to reset the MT or set the power
consumption level of the MT by disabling certain parts of the MT (e.g. the
transmit and receive RF circuits). Mobile Termination Control Mode (+CMEC) is
a command which manages access sharing between the MT and the TE to operate
the user interface of the MT. It has four subparameters which describe the
access to keypad, display, indicators, and touch screen. Each subparameter has
values for restricting the operation of the corresponding user interface part
only to the MT or only to the TE, or to give the access for both of them.
Keypad Control command (+CKPD) is used to operate the keypad of the MT. Here
lies the problem of different keypad types between manufacturers, and also
between their MT models. The keypresses are sent to the MT as a string type
subparameter of this command. Each character in that string represents a key
which will be logically pressed. A special character (colon) followed by any
character can be used by manufacturers (or TE application programmers) to
represent a key which is not defined in this profile. An escape character
(semicolon) for direct string entering is also defined. All text between
single semicolon characters is treated as an alphanumeric entry and is not
converted to keypressings. All semicolon characters inside the text is
duplicated in the TE and stripped back to one before entering them to the MT.
Command has also optional second and third parameters which can be used to
alter the time to strike each key, and the pause to wait between keystrokes
(in tenths of a second). A special pause character (W or w) can be added in
the string type subparameter for an extra pause of the same length as given by
the third subparameter. In the following example alphanumeric mode is entered
and a person predefined in the MT phonebook, \"Ilkka\", is called; each key is
struck for half a second and pauses between strokes are a tenth of a second:
AT+CKPD=\"@:Ilkka:S\",5,1
OK
Display Control command (+CDIS) is used both for writing to the display text
fields and for reading the current status of the fields. Mobile Termination
usually has a character set of its own, so the TA will do a conversion between
the TE and the MT character sets. TE can have several character sets and the
TA must be informed of the character set in use before starting to write or
read the display. Character set is set with general command select TE
character set +CSCS. The +CDIS=? query command is a way to get information
about the length of the fields. In the following example an MT is first
queried about the supported conversions and the lengths of the fields. The
response shows there are three ten character long and two six character long
fields. Then the TE character set is set to be IRA and the current status of
the display is read. The last command writes the text \"Hello, I\'m writing to
display\" in the three fields, and keeps the contents of the two other fields
same (the last two commas could also be left out).
AT+CSCS=?;+CDIS=?
+CSCS: (\"IRA\",\"PCCP850\",\"8859‑1\")
+CDIS: 10,10,10,6,6
OK
AT+CSCS=\"IRA\"
OK
AT+CDIS?
+CDIS: \"RADIOLINJA\",\"\",\"\",\"Menu\",\"Memory\"
OK
AT+CDIS=\"IRA\",\"Hello, I\'m\",\"writing to\",\"display\",,
OK
The writing is possible only when it is permitted by the Mobile Termination
Control Mode command (and by the manufacturer). If a certain field is not
writable (but is readable), writing to it is ignored. The order of the text
fields is determined by manufacturers and follow the rule: first field is in
the upper left corner, second in the next field to the right, and so on, until
to the last field in the lower right corner.
Touch screen action Control command (+CTSA) is used to operate the touch
screen of the MT. The x, y coordinates of the phone are fixed even if the
device\'s orientation is changed. In the following example commands are sent
to the MT to emulate a user drawing on the ME\'s touch screen; it is relevant
that the gesture starts from the top of the touch screen. A gesture is
emulated, starting at location 10,10 in a non-display area of the ME\'s
(touch) screen, then dragged to 50,50 (during which the gesture crosses the
boundary between the non-display area and a display area), then dragged to
100,100 and finally the touch screen is released at location 100,100.
AT+CSO=? obtain the touch screen orientation
+CSO=2,0
AT+CSS=? obtain the touch screen size\ +CSS=200,600\ AT+CDSB=? determine if a
boundary between the non-display area and a display area exists, and its
location\ +CDSB=20,20,180,580\ AT+CTSA=1,10,10 start emulating a gesture\
AT+CTSA=1,50,50 emulate that the gesture crosses the boundary between non-
display area and a display area\ +CTSA=0,100,100 end emulating the gesture
Indicators can be handled with Indicator Control command (+CIND). Its query
command returns a short description (abbreviation) of the purpose of the
indicators and the supported values for each indicator. The setting and
reading is done similarly as with Display Control command. In the following
example the indicators of a phone are queried, their current value is read,
and the value of message indicator is tried to set (but it is forbidden):
AT+CIND=?
+CIND: (\"memory\",(0‑2)),(\"call\",(0,1)),(\"data\",(0,1)),(\"roam\",(0,1)),
(\"alpha\",(0,1)),(\"message\",(0,1)),(\"index1\",(0‑11)),(\"index2\",(0‑11)),
(\"index3\",(0‑11)),(\"signal\",(0‑5)),(\"service\",(0,1)),(\"sel1\",(0,1)),
(\"sel2\",(0,1)),(\"sel3\",(0,1)),(\"battchg\",(0‑5))
OK
AT+CIND?
+CIND: 1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,5
OK
AT+CIND=,,,,,0
+CME ERROR: 10
The subparameter order in the command is defined by the query command order,
not by the actual display order. The zero value of an indicator means that it
is off (or in state which can be identified as \"off\"‑state), value one means
that the indicator is on (or in a state which is more substantial than
\"off\"‑state), value two is more substantial than one, and so on.
To this point, only operating through the TE is covered. But when MT can be
operated also through its keypad, or touch screen, or there are changes in the
status of the display elements, the information about these actions is given
to the TE also. This can be solved only with unsolicited result codes which
return keypad, display text and indicator, and touch screen events. Each event
group has a result code of its own: +CKEV returns the key code and if the key
pressed (1) or released (0), +CDEV returns the display text field running
number (as specified by command +CDIS) and the new status of the field, and
+CIEV returns the running number of the indicator (refer +CIND) and the new
value of it, and +CTEV returns the location of the action performed on the
touch screen. In the following example number key 1 is pressed, updated on the
display, released, and signal strength changes its state to five, the touch
screen is pressed at coordinates 10,10, and it is released at the same
coordinates, 3 seconds after initially pressing the screen:
+CKEV: 49,1
+CDEV: 1,\"1\"
+CKEV: 49,0
+CIND: 10,5
+CTEV: 1,10,10,0;
+CTEV: 0,10,10,0,3000
Mobile Termination Event Reporting command (+CMER) has been specified for the
purpose of controlling the sending of these unsolicited result codes to the
TE. Four ways are provided to handle the buffering of the result codes (see
figure 8). The first is to buffer them always. The second possibility is to
discard them when in on‑line data mode and otherwise forward them directly to
the TE. The third possibility is to buffer them in data mode and otherwise
forward them to the TE. The last possibility is to send them always to the TE
(some inband technique - e.g. V.80 - is used in data mode to send the result
codes within the data). This is the first subparameter of +CMER command. Next
three subparameters are used to enable or disable each of the keypad, text
field and indicator result codes. Sending codes can be enabled either so that
only events generated from the MT user interface are returned, or so that also
events caused by Keypad, Display and Indicator Control commands are returned.
The fifth subparameter controls the flushing of the buffer when the value of
the first subparameter is changed to a value from one to three.

An example of complete setup of the TA where TE takes the control of keypad,
but does not want to write to display nor control the indicators (in the start
MT is powered off):
AT+CMEE=2;+CREG=1 (use verbose \ values; report registration)

(\"sel2\",(0,1)),(\"sel3\",(0,1)),(\"battchg\",(0‑5))
OK
AT+CSCS=\"IRA\" (set TE character set for display text results)
OK
AT+CMER=1,0,2,2,0 (return display text and indicator result codes when
OK in command state, in data mode discard them)
AT+CDIS?;+CIND? (read current state of display texts and indicators)
+CDIS: \"\",\"\",\" 12345\",\"Menu\",\"Memory\" (user had pressed number
buttons before
+CIND: 1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,3,1,0,0,0,5 TE took control with +CMEC)
OK
AT+CKPD=\"C\",20 (clear main display text \'12345\' by holding the
OK \'clear\' button down two seconds)
+CDEV: 3,\"1234\" (first only one character deleted)
+CDEV: 3,\"\" (while holding continues, whole display is cleared)
+CDEV: 1,\"RADIOLINJA\" (operator name comes to the display)
The start of the previous example could go as follows when MT has already been
powered on but is waiting for the PIN:
AT+CMEE=2;+CREG=1 (use verbose \ values; report registration)
OK
AT+CPAS (query MT status)
+CPAS: 0 (MT is ready to receive commands)
OK
AT+CPIN? (is MT asking passwords?)
+CPIN: SIM PIN (yes, SIM PIN required)
AT+CPIN=\"4321\"
OK (correct PIN)
One of the most regular operations done through the MT user interface is
phonebook control. To lessen the workload of the TE, some direct commands for
phonebook reading and writing are practical. Command Select Phonebook Memory
Storage +CPBS query version returns supported phonebook memories, read version
returns current settings, and set version selects the memory. For GSM, the
normal storages are SIM, MT and TA.
Read Phonebook Entries (+CPBR) can be used to read either one or many
phonebook locations at the same time. A regular phonebook entry consists of
three elements: memory index number, the phone number and its alphanumeric
equivalent given by the user. Query version of this returns supported index
values of the selected memory, and the maximum lengths of the number and
alphanumeric elements. The query version of the Write Phonebook Entry command
(+CPBW) is similar, but the action version sets or clears an entry in the
phonebook. Find Phonebook Entries (+CPBF) can be used to search alphanumeric
entries starting with specific string. An example where the whole phonebook of
the MT is read, index number four is cleared, and number three is written:
AT+CPBS=?
+CPBS: (\"ME\",\"SM\") (MT and SIM have phonebooks)
OK
AT+CPBS=\"ME\" (select MT memory)
OK
AT+CPBR=? (read index range and element lengths)
+CPBR: (1‑99),30,30
OK
AT+CPBR=1,99 (read all entries but only the ones set are returned)
+CPBR: 1,\"931123456\",129,\"Ilkka\"
+CPBR: 2,\"9501234567\",129,\"\"
+CPBR: 4,\"901234567\",129,\"Hesari\"
OK
AT+CPBW=4;+CPBW=3,\"921123456\",,\"TS\" (clear index 4 and write index 3)
OK
Circuit switched fallback (+CCSFB) can be used to control circuit switched
fallback operation. Reporting of CSFB related CS paging requests can be
switched on or off by +CCSFB=1 and +CCSFB=0. CSFB related CS paging requests
are reported with unsolicited result code +CCSFBU. CSFB calls can be
automatically accepted or rejected by +CCSFB=2, +CCSFB=3, +CCSFB=4 and
+CCSFB=5. CSFB calls can be manually accepted or rejected by +CCSFB=6 and
+CCSFB=7. In the example the ME interrogates the current CSFB settings,
enables reporting and accepts a CSFB call:
AT+CCSFB=?
+CCSFB: 0 (reporting and automatic acceptance/rejection disabled)
OK
AT+CCSFB=1 (enable reporting)
OK
+CCSFBU: 2,1,12345678,17 (incoming CSFB paging request with clip supplementary
service)
AT+CCSFB=6 (accept CSFB call)
OK

>
> \- +CNEC_GMM: \ GPRS Mobility Management
>
> \- +CNEC_GSM: \[,\] GPRS Session Management
>
> \- +CNEC_EMM: \[,\] EPS Mobility Management
>
> \- +CNEC_ESM: \[,\] EPS Session Management
>
> \- +CNEC_5GMM: \[,\] 5GS Mobility Management
>
> \- +CNEC_5GSM: \[,\] 5GS Session Management
The parameter \ is specified as a sum of integers, each representing the
category of error codes that the MT is interested in receiving.
The read command returns the current setting of \.
Test command returns the supported values as a compound value.
**Parameters**
\: integer type. The parameter is a sum of integers each representing a
certain category of error codes. The value consists of the sum of the
individual values for \ for the required unsolicited result codes.

management errors coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.501 [161] Table 9.11.4.2.1
NOTE: The sequence of entering +CNEC=1, followed by +CNEC=4 does not yield the
same result as +CNEC=5, as +CNEC=4 overwrites the previous setting.
Example: If the MT wants to receive only CS mobility management errors, then
\=1 must be specified.
AT+CNEC=1
If the MT wants to receive CS mobility management errors and GPRS session
management errors, then \=5 must be specified (1 for enabling CS mobility
management error and 4 for enabling GPRS session management error).

## 9.2 Mobile termination error result code +CME ERROR
### 9.2.0 General
The operation of +CME ERROR: \ final result code is similar to the
regular ERROR result code: if +CME ERROR: \ is the result code for any of
the commands in a command line, none of the following commands in the same
command line is executed (neither ERROR nor OK result code shall be returned
as a result of a completed command line execution). The format of \ can
be either numeric or verbose. This is set with command +CMEE (refer clause
9.1).
NOTE: ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14] command V does not affect the format of
this result code.
\ values (numeric format followed by verbose format):
All values below 256 are reserved.
Values in the range 0 - 100 are reserved for general errors.
Values in the range 101 - 150 are reserved for use by CS, GPRS, EPS and 5GS.
Values in the range 151 - 170 are reserved for use by VBS/VGCS and eMLPP.
Values in the range 171 - 256 can be used by GPRS, EPS and 5GS.

# 10 Commands for packet domain
## 10.0 General
This clause defines commands that a TE can use to control a MT supporting
packet switched services.
Packet Domain MTs vary widely in functionality. At one extreme, an advanced MT
can support multiple PDP types, and use multiple external networks and QoS
profiles. At the other extreme, an MT can support only a single PDP type using
a single external network, and rely on the HLR to contain the PDP context
definition.
A comprehensive set of Packet Domain-specific commands is defined in clause
10.1 to provide the flexibility needed by the more complex MT. The commands
are designed to be expandable to accommodate new PDP types and interface
protocols, merely by defining new values for many of the parameters. Multiple
contexts can be activated if the interface link-layer protocol is able to
support them. The commands use the extended information and error message
capabilities described in this specification.
For MTs of intermediate complexity, most commands have simplified forms where
certain parameters can be omitted.
For certain simple MTs, and for backwards compatibility with existing
communications software as defined in 3GPP TS 23.060 [47], it is possible to
control access to the Packet Domain using existing modem-compatible commands.
A special dial-string syntax is defined for use with the D command. This
\"modem compatible\" mode of operation is described in clause 10.2.
A discussion on the interaction of the AT commands, Packet Domain Management

## 10.1 Commands specific to MTs supporting the packet domain
### 10.1.0 General remark about EPS bearer contexts and PDP contexts
According to 3GPP TS 23.401 [82], there is a 1 to 1 mapping between active EPS
bearer context and active PDP context:
\- An active default EPS bearer context is associated with an active non
secondary PDP context.
\- An active dedicated EPS bearer context is associated with an active
secondary PDP context.
In consequence to the implicit logical relation between EPS PDN connection and
its associated Default EPS Bearer, hereafter a same non secondary PDP context
identifier \ can be used to refer either an EPS PDN connection context
or its associated Default EPS Bearer context.
As dedicated EPS bearer contexts are activated by the network, the network can
then activate a new dedicated EPS bearer or modify an existing one to fulfil
the request. For bearer resources activated by the network a context
identifier is allocated by the MT/TA.
For easy reading the term PDP context is used for PDP contexts in UMTS/GPRS as
well as PDN/default EPS bearers and traffic flows in EPS.
The feature \"initial PDP context\" may be supported and is a manufacturer
specific option. For this option, the context with \=0 (context number 0)
is defined upon startup and does not need to be created with the +CGDCONT
command. The initial PDP context has particular manufacturer specific default
settings disassociated with any other default settings of +CGDCONT. When in
E-UTRAN or according to the AT-command +CIPCA in GERAN and UTRAN, the initial
PDP context is automatically activated by the MT following a successful
registration to the network. If all active contexts are deactivated, the
initial PDP context can be (re)established. This is manufacturer specific and
depends on the current RAT as well as how the active contexts are deactivated.
NOTE 1: Care must be taken to secure that repetitive PDP context activations /
deactivations are not performed and that PDP contexts are not activated in
situations where it is a determined choice by the terminal or the network to
discontinue connectivity. Examples of such deliberate discontinuation of
connectivity are the AT-commands +CGATT=0 or +CGACT=0, receipt of a detach
request from the network with \"re-attach not required\" or when all PDP
contexts are deactivated by the network.

### 10.1.00 General remark about 5GS PDU sessions and EPS PDN connections
According to 3GPP TS 23.501 [165] and 3GPP TS 24.501 [161] there exists a one
to one mapping between a 5GS PDU session and an EPS PDN connection. A 5GS PDU
session is a set of QoS flows consisting of one QoS flow of the default QoS
rule and optionally one or more QoS flows of non-default QoS rule. A PDN
connection is set of EPS bearer contexts and consists of at least one default
EPS bearer context and optionally one or more dedicated EPS bearer contexts. A
PDU session can be mapped to one default EPS bearer context and zero or more
dedicated bearer EPS bearer contexts. An EPS bearer context can be mapped to
one or more QoS flows. The mapping between a QoS flow and an EPS bearer
context is not always one to one.

**Description**
The set command specifies PDP context parameter values for a PDP context
identified by the (local) context identification parameter, \ and also
allows the TE to specify whether security protected transmission of ESM
information is requested, because the PCO can include information that
requires ciphering. There can be other reasons for the UE to use security
protected transmission of ESM information, e.g. if the UE needs to transfer an
APN. The number of PDP contexts that may be in a defined state at the same
time is given by the range returned by the test command.
For EPS the PDN connection and its associated EPS default bearer is identified
herewith.
For 5GS the PDU session and its associated QoS flow of the default QoS rule is
identified herewith.
A special form of the set command, +CGDCONT=\ causes the values for
context number \ to become undefined.
If the initial PDP context is supported, the context with \=0 is
automatically defined at startup, see clause 10.1.0. As all other contexts,
the parameters for \=0 can be modified with +CGDCONT. If the initial PDP
context is supported, +CGDCONT=0 resets context number 0 to its particular
default settings.
The read command returns the current settings for each defined context.
The test command returns values supported as compound values. If the MT
supports several PDP types, \, the parameter value ranges for each
\ are returned on a separate line.
**Defined values**
\: integer type; specifies a particular PDP context definition. The
parameter is local to the TE-MT interface and is used in other PDP context-
related commands. The range of permitted values (minimum value = 1 or if the
initial PDP context is supported (see clause 10.1.0), minimum value = 0) is
returned by the test form of the command.
NOTE 1: The \s for network-initiated PDP contexts will have values
outside the ranges indicated for the \ in the test form of the commands
+CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT.
\: string type; specifies the type of packet data protocol. The
default value is manufacturer specific.

**Description**
This command allows the TE to specify a Packet Filter - PF for a Traffic Flow
Template - TFT that is used in the GGSN and in the Packet GW for routing of
packets onto different QoS flows towards the TE. The concept is further
described in the 3GPP TS 23.060 [47], 3GPP TS 23.501 [165] and 3GPP TS 24.501
[161]. A TFT consists of from one and up to 16 Packet Filters, each identified
by a unique \. A Packet Filter also has an
\ that is unique within all TFTs associated with
all PDP contexts that are associated with the same PDP address.
The set command specifies a Packet Filter that is to be added to the TFT
stored in the MT and used for the context identified by the (local) context
identification parameter, \. The specified TFT will be stored in the
GGSN, the Packet GW and UPF only at activation or MS-initiated modification of
the related context. Since this is the same parameter that is used in the
+CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands, the +CGTFT command is effectively an
extension to these commands. The Packet Filters consist of a number of
parameters, each of which may be set to a separate value.
A special form of the set command, +CGTFT=\ causes all of the Packet
Filters in the TFT for context number \ to become undefined. At any time
there may exist only one PDP context with no associated TFT amongst all PDP
contexts associated to one PDP address. At an attempt to delete a TFT, which
would violate this rule, an ERROR or +CME ERROR response is returned. Extended
error responses are enabled by the +CMEE command. Refer clause 9.2 for
possible \ values.
The read command returns the current settings for all Packet Filters for each
defined context.
The test command returns values supported as compound values. If the MT
supports several PDP types, the parameter value ranges for each PDP type are
returned on a separate line. TFTs shall be used for PDP-type IP and PPP only.
For PDP-type PPP a TFT is applicable only when IP traffic is carried over PPP.
If PPP carries header-compressed IP packets, then a TFT cannot be used.

**Description**
This command allows the TE to specify a minimum acceptable profile, which is
checked by the MT against the negotiated profile returned in the PDP context
establishment and PDP contect modification procedures.
The set command specifies a profile for the context identified by the (local)
context identification parameter, \. The specified profile will be stored
in the MT and checked against the negotiated profile only at activation or MS-
initiated modification of the related context. Since this is the same
parameter that is used in the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands, the +CGEQMIN
command is effectively an extension to these commands. The QoS profile
consists of a number of parameters, each of which may be set to a separate
value.
A special form of the set command, +CGEQMIN=\ causes the minimum
acceptable profile for context number \ to become undefined. In this case
no check is made against the negotiated profile.
The read command returns the current settings for each defined context.
The test command returns values supported as compound values. If the MT

* * *
Command Possible Response(s) +CGATT=\ _+CME ERROR: \ _ +CGATT?
+CGATT: \ +CGATT=? +CGATT: (list of supported \s)
* * *
**Description**
The execution command is used to attach the MT to, or detach the MT from, the
Packet Domain service. After the command has completed, the MT remains in
V.250 command state. If the MT is already in the requested state, the command
is ignored and the OK response is returned. If the requested state cannot be
achieved, an ERROR or +CME ERROR response is returned. Extended error
responses are enabled by the +CMEE command. Refer clause 9.2 for possible
\ values.
NOTE 1: If the initial PDP context is supported, the context with \=0 is
automatically defined at startup, see clause 10.1.0.
Any active PDP contexts will be automatically deactivated when the attachment
state changes to detached.
The read command returns the current Packet Domain service state.
The test command is used for requesting information on the supported Packet
Domain service states.
NOTE 2: This command has the characteristics of both the V.250 action and
parameter commands. Hence it has the read form in addition to the
execution/set and test forms.
**Defined values**
\: integer type; indicates the state of PS attachment
0 detached
1 attached
**Implementation**
Optional.
### 10.1.10 PDP context activate or deactivate +CGACT

**Description**
The execution command is used to activate or deactivate the specified PDP
context (s). After the command has completed, the MT remains in V.250 command
state. If any PDP context is already in the requested state, the state for
that context remains unchanged. If the requested state for any specified
context cannot be achieved, an ERROR or +CME ERROR response is returned.
Extended error responses are enabled by the +CMEE command. If the MT is not PS
attached when the activation form of the command is executed, the MT first
performs a PS attach and then attempts to activate the specified contexts. If
the attach fails then the MT responds with ERROR or, if extended error
responses are enabled, with the appropriate failure-to-attach error message.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
For EPS, if an attempt is made to disconnect the last PDN connection, then the
MT responds with ERROR or, if extended error responses are enabled, a +CME
ERROR.
NOTE: If the initial PDP context is supported, the context with \=0 is
automatically defined at startup, see clause 10.1.0.
For EPS, the activation request for an EPS bearer resource will be answered by
the network by either an EPS dedicated bearer activation or EPS bearer
modification request. The request must be accepted by the MT before the PDP
context can be set in to established state.
For 5GS, the command is used to request or delete the specified QoS flow. The
request for a specific QoS flow will be answered by the network by a PDU
session establishment accept message or a PDU session modification command
message. The PDU session establishment accept message or a PDU session
modification command message must be accepted by the MT before the QoS flow
can be set to active state.
If no \s are specified the activation form of the command activates all
defined non-emergency contexts.
If no \s are specified the deactivation form of the command deactivates
all active contexts.
The read command returns the current activation states for all the defined PDP
contexts.
The test command is used for requesting information on the supported PDP
context activation states.
NOTE. This command has the characteristics of both the V.250 action and
parameter commands. Hence it has the read form in addition to the
execution/set and test forms.
**Defined values**
\: integer type; indicates the state of PDP context activation. The
default value is manufacturer specific.
0 deactivated
1 activated
\: integer type; specifies a particular PDP context definition (see the
+CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).

NOTE: The syntax of the AT Set Command is corrected to be according to ITU‑T
Recommendation V.250 [14]. Older versions of the specification specify
incorrect syntax +CGCMOD=[\[,\[,...]]].
* * *
**Description**
The execution command is used to modify the specified PDP context (s) with
repect to QoS profiles and TFTs. After the command has completed, the MT
returns to V.250 online data state. If the requested modification for any
specified context cannot be achieved, an ERROR or +CME ERROR response is
returned. Extended error responses are enabled by the +CMEE command. Refer
clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
For EPS, the modification request for an EPS bearer resource will be answered
by the network by an EPS bearer modification request. The request must be
accepted by the MT before the PDP context is effectively changed.
For 5GS, the command is used to modify the specified QoS flow. The
modification request for a QoS flow resource will be answered by the network
by a PDU session modification command. The command must be accepted by the MT
before the QoS flow is effectively changed.
If no \s are specified the activation form of the command modifies all
active contexts.
The test command returns a list of \s associated with active contexts.
**Defined values**
\: integer type; specifies a particular PDP context definition (see the

**Description**
The execution command causes the MT to perform whatever actions are necessary
to establish communication between the TE and the network using one or more
Packet Domain PDP types. This may include performing a PS attach and one or
more PDP context activations. If the \ parameter value is unacceptable to
the MT, the MT shall return an ERROR or +CME ERROR response. Refer clause 9.2
for possible \ values. Otherwise, the MT issues the intermediate result
code CONNECT and enters V.250 online data state.
NOTE: If the initial PDP context is supported, the context with \=0 is
automatically defined at startup, see clause 10.1.0.
Commands following +CGDATA command in the AT command line shall not be
processed by the MT.
The detailed behaviour after the online data state has been entered is
dependent on the PDP type. It is described briefly in 3GPP TS 27.060 [34] and
in more detail in 3GPP TS 29.061 [39] and the specifications for the relevant
PDPs. PS attachment and PDP context activation procedures may take place prior
to or during the PDP startup if they have not already been performed using the
+CGATT and +CGACT commands.
If context activation takes place during the PDP startup, one or more \s
may be specified in order to provide the information needed for the context
activation request(s).
During each PDP startup procedure the MT may have access to some or all of the
following information -
The MT may have a priori knowledge, for example, it may implement only one PDP
type.
The command may have provided an \ parameter value.
The TE may provide a PDP type and/or PDP address to the MT during in the PDP
startup procedure.
If any of this information is in conflict, the command will fail.
Any PDP type and/or PDP address present in the above information shall be
compared with the PDP type and/or PDP address in any context definitions
specified in the command in the order in which their \s appear. For a
context definition to match:
The PDP type must match exactly.
The PDP addresses are considered to match if they are identical or if either
or both addresses are unspecified. For example, a PPP NCP request specifying
PDP type = IP and no PDP address would cause the MT to search through the
specified context definitions for one with PDP type = IP and any PDP address.
The context shall be activated using the matched value for PDP type and a
static PDP address if available, together with the other information found in
the PDP context definition. If a static PDP address is not available then a
dynamic address is requested.
If no \ is given or if there is no matching context definition, the MT
shall attempt to activate the context with whatever information is available
to the MT. The other context parameters shall be set to their default values.
If the activation is successful, data transfer may proceed.
After data transfer is complete, and the layer 2 protocol termination
procedure has completed successfully, the V.250 command state is re-entered
and the MT returns the final result code OK.
In the event of an erroneous termination or a failure to start up, the V.250
command state is re-entered and the MT returns the final result code NO
CARRIER or, if enabled, +CME ERROR. Refer clause 9.2 for possible \
values. Attach, activate and other errors may be reported.
The test command is used for requesting information on the supported layer 2
protocols.
This command may be used in both normal and modem compatibility modes.
**Defined values**
\: string type; indicates the layer 2 protocol to be used between the TE
and MT

If the value is omitted, the layer 2 protocol is unspecified. Other values are
reserved and will result in an ERROR response.

**Description**
The execution command returns a list of PDP addresses for the specified
context identifiers. If no \ is specified, the addresses for all defined
contexts are returned.
The test command returns a list of defined \s.
**Defined values**
\: integer type; specifies a particular PDP context definition (see the
+CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).
\ and \: each is a string type that identifies the MT
in the address space applicable to the PDP. The address may be static or
dynamic. For a static address, it will be the one set by the +CGDCONT and
+CGDSCONT commands when the context was defined. For a dynamic address it will
be the one assigned during the last PDP context activation that used the
context definition referred to by \. Both \ and
\are omitted if none is available. Both \ and
\ are included when both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are assigned,
with \ containing the IPv4 address and \ containing
the IPv6 address.
The string is given as dot-separated numeric (0-255) parameter of the form:\
a1.a2.a3.a4 for IPv4 and\
a1.a2.a3.a4.a5.a6.a7.a8.a9.a10.a11.a12.a13.a14.a15.a16 for IPv6.
When +CGPIAF is supported, its settings can influence the format of the IPv6
address in parameter \ or \ returned with the execute
form of +CGPADDR.
NOTE: In dual-stack terminals (\ IPV4V6), the IPv6 address will be
provided in \. For terminals with a single IPv6 stack (\
IPV6) or due to backwards compatibility, the IPv6 address can be provided in
parameter \.

Command Possible response(s) +CGAUTO=[\] _+CME ERROR: \ _ +CGAUTO?
+CGAUTO: \ +CGAUTO=? +CGAUTO: (list of supported \s)
* * *
**Description**
The set command disables or enables an automatic positive or negative response
(auto-answer) to the receipt of a NW-initiated Request PDP Context Activation
message, NW-initiated Request EPS Bearer Activation/ Modification Request
messages and a NW-initiated PDU Session Modification Command message. It also
provides control over the use of the V.250 basic commands \'S0\', \'A\' and
\'H\' for handling network requests for PDP context activation. The setting
does not affect the issuing of the unsolicited result code RING or +CRING.
When the +CGAUTO=0 command is received for GERAN, UTRAN or E-UTRAN RATs, the
MT shall not perform a PS detach if it is attached. Subsequently, when the MT
announces a network request for PDP context activation by issuing the
unsolicited result code RING or +CRING, the TE may manually accept or reject
the request by issuing the +CGANS command or may simply ignore the network
request.
When the +CGAUTO=1 command is received for GERAN, UTRAN or E-UTRAN RATs, the
MT shall attempt to perform a PS attach if it is not already attached. Failure
will result in ERROR or, if enabled, +CME ERROR being returned to the TE.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values. Subsequently, when the MT
announces a network request for PDP context activation by issuing the
unsolicited result code RING or +CRING to the TE, this is followed by the
intermediate result code CONNECT. The MT then enters V.250 online data state
and follows the same procedure as it would after having received a +CGANS=1
with no \ or \ values specified.
The read command returns the current value of \.
The test command returns the values of \ supported by the MT as a compound
value.
**Defined values**
\: integer type
0 turn off automatic response for Packet Domain only
1 turn on automatic response for Packet Domain only
2 modem compatibility mode, Packet Domain only
[3]{.underline} modem compatibility mode, Packet Domain and circuit switched
calls
4 turn on automatic negative response for Packet Domain only
For \=0 Packet Domain network requests are manually accepted or rejected by
the +CGANS command.
For \=1 Packet Domain network requests are automatically accepted according
to the description above.
For \=2, automatic acceptance of Packet Domain network requests is
controlled by the \'S0\' command. Manual control uses the \'A\' and \'H\'
commands, respectively, to accept and reject Packet Domain requests. (+CGANS
may also be used.) Incoming circuit switched calls can be neither manually nor
automatically answered.
For \=3, automatic acceptance of both Packet Domain network requests and
incoming circuit switched calls is controlled by the \'S0\' command. Manual
control uses the \'A\' and \'H\' commands, respectively, to accept and reject
Packet Domain requests. (+CGANS may also be used.) Circuit switched calls are
handled as described elsewhere in this specification.
For \=4, Packet Domain network requests are automatically rejected.
**Implementation**
Optional. If not implemented, the MT shall behave according to the case of
\=3.

according to ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14]. Older versions of the
specification specify incorrect syntax +CGANS=[\,[\,[\]]]
* * *
**Description**
The execution command requests the MT to respond to a network request for
Packet Domain PDP context activation which has been signalled to the TE by the
RING, +CRING or +CGEV unsolicited result code. The \ parameter
allows the TE to accept or reject the request.
If \ is 0, the request is rejected and the MT returns OK to the TE.
If \ is 1, the following procedure is followed by the MT.
Commands following the +CGANS command in the AT command line shall not be
processed by the MT.
If the \ parameter value is unacceptable to the MT, the MT shall return
an ERROR or +CME ERROR response. Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
Otherwise, the MT issues the intermediate result code CONNECT and enters V.250
online data state.
The detailed behaviour after the online data state has been entered is
dependent on the PDP type. It is described briefly in 3GPP TS 27.060 [34] and
in more detail in 3GPP TS 29.061 [39] and the specifications for the relevant
PDPs. PDP context activation procedures shall take place prior to or during
the PDP startup.
One or more \s may be specified in order to provide the values needed for
the context activation request.
During the PDP startup procedure the MT has the PDP type and the PDP address
provided by the network in the Request PDP Context Activation message. The MT
may also have some or all of the following information:
The MT may have a priori knowledge, for example, it may implement only one PDP
type.
The command may have provided an \ parameter value.
The TE may provide one or both of PDP type and PDP address to the MT in the
PDP startup.
If any of this information is in conflict, the command will fail.
If one or more \ is given then an attempt shall be made to identify an
appropriate context definition by matching the PDP type and PDP address in the
network request with the PDP type and PDP address in each of the specified
context definitions (in the order in which their \s appear in the
command) as follows:
The PDP type must match exactly.
The PDP addresses are considered to match if they are identical or if the
address in the context definition is unspecified.
The context shall be activated using the values for PDP type and PDP address
provided by the network, together with the other information found in the PDP
context definition. An APN may or may not re required, depending on the
application.
If no \ is given or if there is no matching context definition, the MT
will attempt to activate the context using the values for PDP type and PDP
address provided by the network, together with any other relevant information
known to the MT. The other context parameters will be set to their default
values.
If the activation is successful, data transfer may proceed.
After data transfer is complete, and the layer 2 protocol termination
procedure has completed successfully, the V.250 command state is re-entered
and the MT returns the final result code OK
In the event of an erroneous termination or a failure to startup, the V.250
command state is re-entered and the MT returns the final result code NO
CARRIER or, if enabled, +CME ERROR. Refer clause 9.2 for possible \
values. Attach, activate and other errors may be reported. It is also an error
to issue the +CGANS command when there is no outstanding network request.
NOTE: This is not the same as if the MT issues a +CGDATA (or +CGACT) command
after receiving a +CRING unsolicited result code. A +CGDATA (or +CGACT) does
not command the MT to acknowledge the network request but rather to make a new
request for context activation. The network request would be ignored.
The test command returns the values of \ and \ supported by the
MT as compound values.
This command may be used in both normal and modem compatibility modes.
**Defined values**
\: integer type; specifies how the request should be responded to.
0 reject the request
1 accept and request that the PDP context be activated
If \ is omitted it is assumed to be 0.
\: string type; indicates the layer 2 protocol to be used (see +CGDATA
command).
\: integer type; specifies a particular PDP context definition (see the

**Description**
The execution command +CGDEL=\ removes the indicated PDP context and
removes all associated data related to the indicated PDP contexts that are not
activated. The AT command will not delete or remove information for activated
PDP contexts. The removed PDP context is listed by the +CGDEL: \
intermediate result code. If the initial PDP context is supported (see clause
10.1.0), +CGDEL=0 will return ERROR and the context will not be removed.
If \ points to a primary PDP context, the PDP context will be deleted
together with all linked secondary PDP contexts if none of the PDP contexts
are activated.
If \ points to a secondary PDP context, the PDP context will be deleted
if it is not activated.
A special form of the command can be given as +CGDEL (with the =\
omitted). In this form, all primary PDP contexts that are not activated or
have any activated secondary PDP contexts will be removed and all secondary
PDP contexts that are not activated will be removed. The associated data of
all the deleted PDP contexts will be removed, and the removed PDP context are
listed by the +CGDEL: \[,\[,...]] intermediate result code.

**Description**
Set command allows the TE to specify authentication parameters for a PDP
context identified by the (local) context identification parameter \ used
during the PDP context activation and the PDP context modification procedures.
Since the \ is the same parameter that is used in the +CGDCONT and
+CGDSCONT commands, +CGAUTH is effectively as an extension to these commands.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
A special form of the set command, +CGAUTH=\ causes the authentication
parameters for context number \ to become undefined.
The read command returns the current settings for each defined context.
The test command returns values supported as compound values.
**Defined values**
\: integer type. Specifies a particular PDP context definition (see the
+CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).

**Description**
The set command controls whether an initial PDP context (see clause 10.1.0)
shall be established automatically following an attach procedure when the UE
is attached to GERAN or UTRAN RATs and whether the UE is attached to E-UTRAN
with or without a PDN connection.
For 5GS, the command controls whether an initial PDU session shall be
established automatically following initial registration.
For \≠0, deactivating the last (active) PDP context can lead to a
(re)establishment of the initial PDP context. Changing setting of \ from 0
to 1 will cause an immediate attempt to (re)establish the initial PDP context
if no PDP context is active. Changing \ from 0 to 2 will if not roaming
cause an immediate attempt to (re)establish the initial PDP context if no
other PDP context is active. The value of \=3 applies to E-UTRAN or NG-RAN
RATs and does not change the setting of PDP context activation in GERAN or
UTRAN RATs. Changing \ will never cause a PDP context deactivation.
For \=1, the EPS Attach is performed without a PDN
connection.
NOTE: For this command, the term roaming corresponds to being registered to a
VPLMN which is not equivalent to HPLMN or EHPLMN.
The read command returns the current setting of the command.
The test command returns values supported as a compound value.
**Defined values**
\: integer type. Activation of PDP context upon attach.

**Description**
The set command allows the TE to specify the 5GS Quality of Service parameters
\, \, [\ and \] and [\ and \]
for a QoS flow (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [165] and 3GPP TS 24.501 [161]). Refer
clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
A special form of the set command, +C5GQOS= \ causes the values for
context number \ to become undefined.
The read command returns the current settings for each defined QoS.
The test command returns the ranges of the supported parameters as compound
values.
**Defined values**
\: integer type; specifies a particular QoS flow definition, EPS Traffic
Flows definition and a PDP Context definition (see the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT
commands).
\: integer type; specifies a class of 5GS QoS (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [165]

**Description**
The execution command is used to activate the specified PDP context(s) or to
request for the specified QoS flow. The command is also used to deactivate the
context or to delete the QoS flow. The command returns with the response
depending upon whether the request is successfully sent to the lower layers or
not.
The actual result for the PDU session establishment from the network will be
displayed through the unsolicited result code +CCSTATEREQU: \, \
once the indication is received from the network.
The request for a specific QoS flow will be answered by the network by a PDU
session establishment accept message or a PDU session modification command
message. This PDU establishment procedure may require several sessions of
request-response of EAP authentication messages between the MT and the network
to complete the procedure (see the +C5GPDUAUTHR and +C5GPDUAUTHS commands),
see 3GPP TS 24.501 [161] clause 6.3.1.
For EPS, if an attempt is made to disconnect the last PDN connection, then the
MT responds with ERROR or, if extended error responses are enabled, a +CME
ERROR.
For EPS, the activation request for an EPS bearer resource will be answered by
the network by either an EPS dedicated bearer activation or EPS bearer
modification request. The request must be accepted by the MT before the PDP
context can be set in to established state.
If the MT is not PS attached when the request for QoS flow command is
executed, the MT first performs a PS attach and then attempts to activate the
context or request the specific QoS flow.
If no \s are specified, the activation form of the command activates all
defined non-emergency contexts.
If no \s are specified, the deactivation form of the command deactivates
all active contexts.
The read command returns the current activation states for all the defined PDP
contexts. The state displayed for each context is the previous state until the
next state is completely accespted by the MT.
The test command is used for requesting information on the supported PDP
context activation states.
**Defined values**
\: integer type; specifies a particular QoS flow definition (see the
+CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).
\: integer type; indicates the state of PDP context activation.
0 deactivated
1 activated
\: integer type; indicates the final result for PDU session
establishment procedure.

**Description**
The set command controls the presentation of an unsolicited result code
+C5GPDUAUTHU: \, \, \ which will be displayed on receiving
an authentication message in the form of Extensible Authentication Protocol
(EAP) message from network during or after a UE-requested non-emergency PDU
establishment request has been sent. The purpose of the PDU session
authentication and authorization is to enable the data network (DN) to
authenticate and authorize the upper layers of UE. This procedure happens
through EAP as specified in IETF RFC 3748 [32] and 3GPP TS 24.501 [161] clause
6.3.1.
There can be several sessions of exchange of an EAP-request and EAP-response
message for the DN to complete the authentication and authorization of the
request for a PDU session. The network shall start a timer (T3590) once the
EAP-request message has been sent and expects the EAP-response message from UE
to stop the timer. On expiry of the timer, network shall re-transmit the
message after restarting the timer. This can be retransmitted for four times.
Read command returns the current setting of value \.

## 10.2 Modem compatibility commands
### 10.2.0 General
This clause describes how existing AT commands, designed for use with a modem,
may be used to control a Packet Domain MT. This is to provide backwards
compatibility with existing communications software. For new applications it
is recommended that the Packet Domain-specific commands, described in previous
clauses, be used.
### 10.2.1 MT originated PDP context activation
#### 10.2.1.0 General
In this mode of operation, the MT behaves like an originating modem and
accepts the normal V.250 commands associated with placing and clearing a call.
If Packet Domain-specific configuration commands are required, they may be
sent to the MT as part of the modem initialization commands.
#### 10.2.1.1 Request packet domain service \'D\'
Table 130: D command syntax
+----------------------------------------------+----------------------+ | Command | Possible Response(s) | +----------------------------------------------+----------------------+ | D*\[*[\][*[\] | | | [*[\[,\[,...]]]]]]# | ERROR | +----------------------------------------------+----------------------+
**Description**
This command causes the MT to perform whatever actions are necessary to
establish communication between the TE and the external PDN.
The V.250 \'D\' (Dial) command causes the MT to enter the V.250 online data
state and, with the TE, to start the specified layer 2 protocol. The MT shall
return CONNECT to confirm acceptance of the command prior to entering the
V.250 online data state. No further commands may follow on the AT command
line.
The detailed behaviour after the online data state has been entered is
dependent on the PDP type. It is described briefly in clause 9 (for IP) of
3GPP TS 27.060 [34]. PS attachment and PDP context activation procedures may
take place prior to or during the PDP startup if they have not already been
performed using the +CGATT and +CGACT commands.
When the layer 2 protocol has terminated, either as a result of an orderly
shut down of the PDP or an error, the MT shall enter V.250 command state and
return the NO CARRIER final result code.
If \ is supported and provided, the MT shall automatically set
up a virtual call to the specified address after the PDP context has been
activated.
If \ and \ are supported, their usage shall be the same as in the
+CGDATA command. The +CGDCONT, +CGQREQ, etc. commands may be used in the modem
initialization AT command string to set values for for PDP type, APN, QoS
etc..
If \ is not supported or is supported but omitted, the MT shall use a
layer 2 protocol appropriate to the PDP type.
If \ is not supported or is supported but omitted, the MT shall attempt
to activate the context using:
(a) any information provided by the TE during the PDP startup procedure, e.g.
the TE may provide a PDP type and/or PDP address to the MT;
(b) a priori knowledge, e.g. the MT may implement only one PDP type; or
> (c) using the \'Empty PDP type\' (3GPP TS 24.008 [8]). (No PDP address or
> APN shall be sent in this case and only one PDP context subscription record
> shall be present in the HLR for this subscriber.)
This command may be used in both normal and modem compatibility modes.
NOTE: The dial string conforms to the syntax specified in 3GPP TS 22.030 [19].
**Defined values**
\: (GPRS Service Code) a string of digits (value 99) which identifies
a request to use the Packet Domain service.
\: a string that identifies the called party in the address
space applicable to the PDP. For communications software that does not support
arbitrary characters in the dial string, a numeric equivalent may be used.
Also, the character comma \',\' may be used as a substitute for the character
period \'.\'.
\: a string which indicates the layer 2 protocol to be used (see +CGDATA
command). For communications software that does not support arbitrary
characters in the dial string, the following numeric equivalents shall be
used:
> 0 NULL (Obsolete)
>
> 1 PPP
>
> 2 PAD (Obsolete)
>
> 3 X25 (Obsolete)
>
> 9yyyy M-xxxx
>
> Other values are reserved and will result in an ERROR response
\: a string of digits which specifies a particular PDP context definition
(see the +CGDCONT and +CGDSCONT commands).
**Implementation**
Optional if the +CGDATA command is supported. If the D command is provided,
then support for \, \ and \ are optional. If they
are not supported but values are provided by the TE, the values shall be
ignored and this shall not constitute an error.
#### 10.2.1.2 Request packet domain IP service \'D\'
Table 131: D command syntax
+----------------------------------------------+----------------------+ | Command | Possible Response(s) | +----------------------------------------------+----------------------+ | D*\[*\[,\[,...]]]# | | | | ERROR | +----------------------------------------------+----------------------+
**Description**
This command causes the MT to perform whatever actions are necessary to
establish communication between the TE and the external PDN.
The V.250 \'D\' (Dial) command causes the MT to enter the V.250 online data
state and, with the TE, to start the specified layer 2 protocol. The MT shall
return CONNECT to confirm acceptance of the command prior to entering the
V.250 online data state. No further commands may follow on the AT command
line.
The detailed behaviour after the online data state has been entered is
described briefly in clause 9, for IP, of 3GPP TS 27.060 [34]. GPRS attachment
and PDP context activation procedures may take place prior to or during the
PDP startup if they have not already been performed using the +CGATT and
+CGACT commands.
When the layer 2 protocol has terminated, either as a result of an orderly
shut down of the PDP or an error, the MT shall enter V.250 command state and
return the NO CARRIER final result code.
If \ is supported, its usage shall be the same as in the +CGDATA command.
The +CGDCONT, +CGQREQ, etc. commands may be used in the modem initialization
AT command string to set values for for PDP type, APN, QoS etc.
If \ is not supported or is supported but omitted, the MT shall attempt
to activate the context using:
(a) any information provided by the TE during the PDP startup procedure, e.g.
the TE may provide a PDP type and/or PDP address to the MT;
(b) a priori knowledge, e.g. the MT may implement only one PDP type; or

> APN shall be sent in this case and only one PDP context subscription record
> shall be present in the HLR for this subscriber.)
This command may be used in both normal and modem compatibility modes.
NOTE. The dial string conforms to the syntax specified in 3GPP TS 22.030 [19].
**Defined values**
\: (GPRS Service Code for IP) a string of digits (value 98) which
identifies a request to use the GPRS with IP (PDP types IP and PPP).
\: a string of digits which specifies a particular PDP context definition
(see +CGDCONT command).
**Implementation**
Optional if the +CGDATA command is supported. If the D command is provided,
then support for \ is optional. If it is not supported but a value is
provided by the TE, the value shall be ignored and this shall not constitute
an error.
### 10.2.2 Network requested PDP context activation
#### 10.2.2.0 General
In this mode of operation, the MT behaves like an answering modem and accepts
the normal V.250 commands associated with answering a call. If Packet Domain-
specific configuration commands are required, they may be sent to the MT as
part of the modem initialization commands.
The +CGAUTO command is used to select modem compatibility mode.
#### 10.2.2.1 Automatic response to a network request for PDP context
activation \'S0\'
The V.250 \'S0=n\' (Automatic answer) command may be used to turn off (n=0)
and on (n>0) the automatic response to a network request for a PDP context
activation.
When the \'S0=n\' (n>0) command is received, the MT shall attempt to perform a
PS attach if it is not already attached. Failure will result in ERROR being
returned to the TE. Subsequently, the MT will announce a network request for
PDP context activation by issuing the unsolicited result code RING to the TE,
followed by the intermediate result code CONNECT. The MT then enters V.250
online data state and follows the same procedure as it would after having
received a +CGANS=1 with no \ or \ values specified.
NOTE: The \'S0=n\' (n=0) command does not perform an automatic PS detach.
**Implementation**
Optional.
#### 10.2.2.2 Manual acceptance of a network request for PDP context
activation \'A\'
The V.250 \'A\' (Answer) command may be used to accept a network request for a
PDP context activation announced by the unsolicited result code RING. The MT
responds with CONNECT, enters V.250 online data state and follows the same
procedure as it would after having received a +CGANS=1 with no \ or
\ values specified. It is an error to issue the \'A\' command when there
is no outstanding network request.
**Implementation**
Optional.
#### 10.2.2.3 Manual rejection of a network request for PDP context activation
\'H\'
The V.250 \'H\' or \'H0\' (On-hook) command may be used to reject a network
request for PDP context activation announced by the unsolicited result code
RING. The MT responds with OK. It is an error to issue the \'H\' command when
there is no outstanding network request.
NOTE: This is an extension to the usage of the \'H\' command that is described
in ITU-T Recommendation V.250 [14].
**Implementation**
Optional.
# 11 Commands for VGCS and VBS
## 11.0 General
This clause defines commands that a TE may use to control a VGCS or VBS
supporting MT. The requirements for the VGCS and VBS are included in the
following specifications:
\- Voice Group Call service (VGCS): 3GPP TS 42.068 [55], 3GPP TS 43.068 [49]
and 3GPP TS 44.068 [52];
\- Voice Broadcast Service (VBS): 3GPP TS 42.069 [56], 3GPP TS 43.069 [50] and
3GPP TS 44.069 [53].
It is anticipated that VGCS or VBS supporting MTs will vary widely in
functionality.
A comprehensive set of VGCS and VBS-specific commands is defined in clause
11.1 to provide the flexibility needed by the more complex MT. The commands
use the extended information and error message capabilities described in this
specification.
For the simplest MTs, and for backwards compatibility with existing
communications software, it is possible to control access to the VGCS and VBS
using existing modem-compatible commands. A special dial-string syntax is
defined for use with the D command. This \"modem compatible\" mode of
operation is described in clause 11.2.
## 11.1 Commands specific to MTs supporting the VGCS and VBS

ERROR: \ _
* * *
**Description**
This Dial command extension is a service request application according to 3GPP
TS 22.030 [19]. No further commands may follow on the AT command line.
Responses
When the call has terminated, either as a result of an orderly termination or
an error, the MT shall return the NO CARRIER final result code.
Possible error responses include +CME ERROR: \ when error is related to
MT functionality. The requested service, GId and priority level are checked
against the subscriptions of the user and the status of the GId stored on the
SIM. In case if no subscription is available for this service, GId or priority
level or the GId is deactivated an ERROR or +CME ERROR result code is
returned. The requested Group Id prefix is not checked against susbscription.
The Group Id prefixes are not stored in the SIM/USIM card. If Service Code for
Group Id prefix is used, but is not managed by MT, an ERROR or +CME ERROR
result code is returned. See +CME ERROR extensions for VGCS, VBS and eMLPP in
clause 9.2.3.
Detailed error report of an unsuccessful originated call can be obtained with
command Extended Error Report +CEER (if implemented).
NOTE 1: The dial string conforms to the syntax specified in 3GPP TS 22.030
[19].
**Defined values**
\: Service Code is a string of digits which identifies a request to
use.
17 Voice Group Call Service
18 Voice Broadcast Service
\: Service Code is a string of digits which identifies a request to use
eMLPP priority. Service Code values for different priority levels are
specified in 3GPP TS 22.030 [19].

party as specified in 3GPP TS 43.068 [49].
\: a digit that specifies a Group Id prefix as specified in 3GPP TS
43.068 [49].
NOTE 2: \ is only applicable when \ defines Voice Group Call
Service.
**Implementation**
Mandatory for a MT supporting AT commands only and VGCS or VBS is implemented.
### 11.2.2 Termination of an voice group or voice broadcast call \'H\'
The V.250 \'H\' or \'H0\' (On-hook) command may be used to terminate an
ongoing voice group or voice broadcast call. The MT responds with OK. It is an
error to issue the \'H\' command when there is no outstanding network request.
It is an error to issue the \'H\' command if the user is in group receive mode
or the user is not the originator of the call and a ERROR or +CME ERROR result
code is returned to the TE. Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
NOTE: This is an extension to the usage of the \'H\' command that is described
in ITU-T Recommendation V.250 [14].

# 12 Commands for USIM application toolkit
## 12.1 General
If a UICC connected to an MT uses USIM Application Toolkit (USAT), some USAT
features can be provided by the MT itself, whereas other features can be
implemented in the TE. This applies especially to MTs with limited
capabilities, where the user interface could be provided by the TE.
If there are multiple entities inside the TE providing USAT services, for the
purpose of this specification, the TE is visible as one entity handling AT
commands and responses on the interface to the TA/MT, see figure 12.1-1.
Figure 12.1-1: Overview of the interfaces between TE, TA/MT and UICC for USAT
The AT commands for definition of the USAT profiles and transmission of USAT
proactive commands, USAT terminal responses and USAT envelope commands between
the TE and UICC are specified in the subsequent clauses.
Compared to APDUs, where the MT is the initiator, USAT defines logic where the
UICC is the initiator of the USAT proactive commands and the MT sends
responses to these commands. Due to that, USAT proactive commands are sent in
unsolicited result codes, whereas the associated responses are transported in
subsequent AT commands.
## 12.2 Commands specific to MTs supporting USAT
### 12.2.1 Read USAT profile +CUSATR
Table 12.2.1-1: +CUSATR action command syntax
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Command | Possible response(s) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | +CUSATR[=\] | [+CUSATR: \,\] | | | | | | [\\+CUSATR: | | | \,\ | | | | | | [...]] | | | | | | _+CME ERROR: \ _ | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | +CUSATR=? | +CUSATR: (list of supported | | | \s) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
Execution command +CUSATR=\ returns the profile specified by
\. Execution command issued without parameter; +CUSATR,
returns all profiles.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
**Defined values**
\: integer type.
0 TE profile that can be set with +CUSATW.
1 MT profile that can be set with +CUSATW.
2 MT default profile that reflects the inherent, default supported facilities
of the MT.
3 UICC profile that reflects the currently active UICC profile that was sent
to the UICC in the last TERMINAL PROFILE command.
4 UICC EF~UST~. The elementary file that indicates services available in the
USIM.
5 List of MT only facilities (facilities that are not allowed to be assigned
to the TE, see 3GPP TS 31.111 [92]).
\: string type in hexadecimal character format. The profile
describing the supported facilities of the referenced \ as
specified for the Terminal Profile in 3GPP TS 31.111 [92] or for the related
EF in 3GPP TS 31.102 [59].
**Implementation**
Optional.
### 12.2.2 Write USAT profile +CUSATW
Table 12.2.2-1: +CUSATW action command syntax
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Command | Possible response(s) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | +CUSATW[=\[,\]] | _storage>,\ | | | | | | _+CME ERROR: \ _ | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | +CUSATW=? | +CUSATW: (list of supported | | | \s) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
**Description**
**Execution command without parameters resets stored TE and MT profiles to
their default values. Adding parameter** \ **to the AT
command resets only the referred storage to its default value. Execution
command issued with accompanied parameter** \**, stores the given**
\ **to non-volatile memory in the MT.**
Upon an attempt to store or reset a profile that conflicts with an already
stored profile or the list of MT only facilities, the operation fails and the
profile referred to by command parameter \ remains unchanged.
The MT responds with +CUSATW: \,\ where
\ refers the conflicting profile followed by the final result
code _+CME ERROR: 3_ (Operation not allowed)_._ If there is a conflict with
the MT only facilities, \ is set to 5; otherwise
\ indicates the profile already stored for the TE or for the
MT. The rules for detecting conflicts are defined in 3GPP TS 31.111 [92].
Successful execution of the command does not result in any information
response.
Test command returns supported values as a compound value.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
**Defined values**
\: integer type.
0 TE. Refers profile storage for the facilities supported by the TE. Default
value is a blank profile with all bits set to zero. This value is applicable
both in the execution command and in the information response.
1 MT. Refers profile storage for the facilities to be supported by MT, which
can be a subset of the default MT facilities. The TE can choose to register a
subset of the MT default profile, typically omitting facilities also supported
by the TE profile. Default value is the MT default profile. This value is
applicable both in the execution command and in the information response.
5 Refers to a conflict between the TE profile and the list of MT only
facilities. This value is not applicable in the execution command.
\: string type in hexadecimal character format. The profile
describing the supported USAT facilities of the referenced \
as specified for the Terminal Profile in 3GPP TS 31.111 [92].
\: string type in hexadecimal character format. A bitwise
AND of two profiles, showing the conflicts, that is, USAT facilities supported
by both profiles. See description of Terminal Profile in 3GPP TS 31.111 [92].
**Implementation**
Optional.
### 12.2.3 Profile download upon start-up +CUSATD
Table 12.2.3-1: +CUSATD parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Possible response(s) +CUSATD=[\[,\]] _+CME ERROR:
\ _ +CUSATD? +CUSATD: \,\ +CUSATD=? +CUSATD: (list
of supported \s),(list of supported \s)
* * *
**Description**
This command determines if, and optionally which profile should be downloaded
to the UICC automatically upon start-up. If, prior to a restart/start-up, the
+CUSATD settings have not been altered, then the default settings determine
the behaviour upon start-up. However, if the parameters of +CUSATD has been
set to other than default and then a restart is performed (e.g. by +CFUN),
these values determine the behaviour. This is true for one restart only after
altering +CUSATD parameters as they are always reset to default at the end of
the next UICC start-up (i.e. when the USIM initialisation as specified in 3GPP
TS 31.102 [98] has been completed).
The command without parameters resets the parameters to their default values.
The command can only be used if the UICC is already in active state
(\ 4, e.g. upon +CUSATA) or in download completed state
(\ 2) and the UICC does not support the \"Additional TERMINAL
PROFILE after UICC activation\" feature (see 3GPP TS 31.111 [92]). In all
other cases the command responds with +CME ERROR: 14 (SIM busy).
+CUSATD=\,1 also enables the unsolicited result code +CUSATS:
\. The MT uses this unsolicited result code to indicate that a
profile download is performed (setting +CUSATD=0,1 or +CUSATD=1,1) or that it
is ready for profile download (setting +CUSATD=2,1). In both cases, the MT
also indicates the end of UICC start-up by the unsolicited result code
+CUSATS: 4. If the UICC is awaiting PIN verification during start-up, this is
also reported.
When using +CUSATD=1, the +CUSATA=1 command has to be used to enable TE
profile facility handling after restart. In the time between profile download
and issuance of +CUSATA=1, the UICC may already attempt to issue proactive
commands. The MT will not send these to the TE, but rather give the UICC the
response \"terminal currently unable to process command\" autonomously. The
UICC may implement only a limited number of retries, which can potentially
leave USAT in an unwanted state if the +CUSATA=1 command arrives late.
NOTE: Care has to be taken when using +CUSATD=2. If no +CUSATA=2 or +CUSATA=3
is sent during start-up, USAT is also blocked for the MT.
Test command returns supported values as compound values.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
**Defined values**
\: integer type. Parameter decides when/if to perform a profile
download to UICC and which profile to download. The default value is
implementation specific.
0 Download MT default profile automatically during next start-up.
1 Download the combined TE and MT profile (merger of the profiles written by
+CUSATW) automatically during next start-up. The rules for merging profiles
are defined in 3GPP TS 31.111 [92].
2 Halt next UICC start-up when ready for profile download. Profile to download
will be selected and download will be triggered by +CUSATA.
\: integer type. Parameter enables unsolicited result code +CUSATS:
\ to notify the TE about a new state during start-up.
[0]{.underline} Disable +CUSATS, i.e. no notification.
1 Enable +CUSATS, i.e. notify TE.
\: integer type. Parameter reports that the UICC entered a new
state during start-up or that the UICC ended startup and entered active state.
0 UICC start-up in progress, before profile download.
1 UICC start-up halted and ready for profile download. This state is reached
if +CUSATD=2 was issued before restart. UICC start-up will continue upon
+CUSATA=2 or +CUSATA=3.
2 Profile download completed, UICC startup continuing.
3 UICC awaiting PIN verification.
4 UICC active.
**Implementation**
Optional.
### 12.2.4 Activate USAT profile +CUSATA
Table 12.2.4-1: +CUSATA action command syntax
+----------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | Command | Possible response(s) | +----------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | +CUSATA[=\] | +CUSATA: \[,\] | | | | | | _+CME ERROR: \ _ | +----------------------------+----------------------------------------+ | +CUSATA=? | +CUSATA: (list of supported | | | \s) | +----------------------------+----------------------------------------+
**Description**
Execution command +CUSATA retrieves the current UICC state or downloads a
profile to the UICC and/or activates handling of the TE profile facilities.
A positive result upon a +CUSATA=1 or +CUSATA=3 command (also) enables TE
profile facility handling via unsolicited result codes +CUSATP:
\ and +CUSATEND. The MT uses the unsolicited result code
+CUSATP: \ to forward to the TE proactive commands issued
by the UICC. The unsolicited result code +CUSATEND is issued by the MT when
the UICC indicates that the proactive command session is terminated, i.e. in
response to a USAT terminal response, the UICC indicates that no other USAT
proactive command is pending. Lastly, terminal responses to the proactive
commands can now be issued with +CUSATT=\ and envelope
commands can be issued with +CUSATE=\.
If the action requested by the +CUSATA command can not be performed, the
information response +CUSATA: \,[\] is
returned with appropriate values, followed by the final result code _+CME
ERROR: 4_ (Operation not supported) _in case the UICC does not support USAT at
all, or_ the final result code _+CME ERROR: 3 (_ Operation not allowed _) in
all other cases_.
If the UICC is already in active state and the UICC does not support the
\"Additional TERMINAL PROFILE after UICC activation\" feature (see 3GPP TS
31.111 [92]), the TE has the option to perform a reset of the UICC or use
+CFUN to get back to an initial non-active UICC state. The +CUSATD command can
be used to set profile handling upon the next restart.
All USAT proactive commands that the MT does not process itself and all
terminal responses from the TE are transparently forwarded by the MT. The
routing mechanism for USAT commands supported by both entities is specified in
3GPP TS 31.111 [92].
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
**Defined values**
\: integer type.
[0]{.underline} Return status information only, in information response:
+CUSATA: \[,\].

can only be used if the combined TE and MT profile was downloaded during
start-up (setting +CUSATD=1).
2 Download MT default profile.
3 Download the combined TE and MT profile (merger of the profiles written by
+CUSATW) an enable TE profile facility handling. The rules for merging
profiles are defined in 3GPP TS 31.111 [92].
\: integer type. Parameter reports that the UICC entered a new
state during start-up or that the UICC ended startup and entered active state.
0 UICC start-up in progress, before profile download.
1 UICC start-up halted and ready for profile download. This state is reached
if +CUSATD=2 was issued before restart. UICC start-up will continue upon
+CUSATA=2 or +CUSATA=3.
2 Profile download completed, UICC startup continuing.
3 UICC awaiting PIN verification.
4 UICC active.
\: integer type. Indicates whether the UICC
supports the \"Additional TERMINAL PROFILE after UICC activation\" feature
(see 3GPP TS 31.111 [92]). The value may not be available during early phases
of start-up.

## 12.3 Informative examples
These examples provide a sequence of interactions where USAT commands and
responses are transmitted in AT commands. As it would make the examples
unreadable, USAT data is not given in its hexadecimal representation (which is
found in 3GPP TS 31.111 [92]), but in abstract textual form. For readability,
only a subset of USAT facilities typically provided in a profile is given in
the examples. Resulting or triggering actions on the MT-UICC interface are
also indicated in the examples.
First, the TE reads the MT default profile:
AT+CUSATR=2
+CUSATR: 2,\
OK
The TE removes some USAT facilities in the MT by writing a new MT profile,
which contains those facilities that are to be handled by the MT:
AT+CUSATW=1,\
OK
Now the TE tries to write a TE profile that conflicts with the MT profile. The
MT responds with the conflict information and rejects the command.
AT+CUSATW=0,\
+CUSATW: 1,\
+CME ERROR: 3
The next attempt to write a TE profile is successful and the TE activates the
profiles.
AT+CUSATW=0,\
OK
AT+CUSATA=3
_MT - > UICC: TERMINAL PROFILE_
_UICC - > ME: proactive command pending_
OK
The UICC sends a SET UP MENU proactive command, resulting in the command being
transferred to the TE and the latter confirming it with a terminal response;
thereafter the proactive session ends.
_UICC - > MT: SET UP MENU_
+CUSATP: \
AT+CUSATT=\
_MT - > UICC: TERMINAL RESPONSE: OK_
_UICC - > ME: no proactive command pending_
OK
+CUSATEND
A selection by the subscriber in the menu results in an ENVELOPE being sent to
the MT and forwarded to the UICC. The UICC responds with the next proactive
command DISPLAY TEXT. After the terminal response, the proactive session ends.
AT+CUSATE=\
_MT - > UICC: ENVELOPE(MENU SELECTION, item=1)_
_UICC - > ME: proactive command pending_
OK
_UICC - > MT: DISPLAY TEXT_
+CUSATP: \
AT+CUSATT=\
_MT - > UICC: TERMINAL RESPONSE: OK_
_UICC - > ME: no proactive command pending_
OK
+CUSATEND
The TE defines UICC profile download options. The definition is effective for
the next UICC start-up.
AT+CUSATD=1,1
OK
The UICC restarts. The MT reports the start-up. During start-up the profile
download definition cannot be altered and the MT responds error code 14 (SIM
busy).
+CUSATS: 0
AT+CUSATD=2,1
+CME ERROR: 14
The UICC is awaiting PIN verification. During PIN verification the profile
download definition cannot be altered and the MT responds error code 14 (SIM
busy).
+CUSATS: 3
AT+CUSATD=2,1
+CME ERROR: 14
The UICC becomes active and the profile download definition can be changed.
+CUSATS: 4
AT+CUSATD=2,1
OK
The TE enables the downloaded profile.
AT+CUSATA=1
OK
The TE reads the TE profile:
AT+CUSATR=0
+CUSATR: 0,\
OK
Now the TE tries to write a MT profile that conflicts with the TE profile. The
MT responds with the conflict information and rejects the command.
AT+CUSATW=1,\
+CUSATW: 0,\
+CME ERROR: 3
The next attempt to write a MT profile is successful.
AT+CUSATW=1,\
OK
The TE reads the List of MT only facilities:
AT+CUSATR=5
+CUSATR: 5,\
OK
Now the TE tries to write a TE profile that conflicts with the MT only
facilities. The MT responds with the conflict information and rejects the
command.
AT+CUSATW=0,\
+CUSATW: 5,\
+CME ERROR: 3
The next attempt to write a TE profile is successful.
AT+CUSATW=0,\
OK

+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Command | Possible response(s) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | +CDU=\[,\[,\[,\[,\ | | | [,\\ | __when \ =0 and command | | [,\]]]]]] | successful:__| | | | | | [+CDUT | | | : \ [,\] | | | | | | [\\+CDUT: | | | \[,\]] | | | | | | [...]] | | | | | | __when \ =1 and command | | | successful:__| | | | | | [+CDU: \ ] | | | | | | __when \ =1 and command | | | unsuccessful:_* | | | | | | [+CDUI: \] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | +CDU=? | +CDU: (list of supported | | | \s) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
**Description**
Execution command can be used to dial a URI (with \=1) for initiating
communication using the specified communication client with the specified
media profile. With \=0 the command can query which clients are
supported for the URI types supported.
When the command is used to query the supported URI types (i.e. \=0),
the URI types are provided by +CDUT: \. When the command is used
to dial a URI (i.e. \=1) and the dialling succeeds the command is
terminated by +CDU: \ and OK. The parameters \ and
\ are used to set the per call basis values of the supplementary
services CLIR / OIR and CUG.
The unsolicited result code +CDUU: \,\ can be subsequently
provided to give further basic information about the call as it progresses.
The value of the \ is kept until the call is released. See command
+CMCCS and unsolicited result code +CMCCSI for provision of additional
information about the call setup.
If \"Call control by USIM\" see 3GPP TS 31.111 [92] clause 4.5 is activated by
the USIM, it is the responsibility of the communication client to perform any
required call control verification according to the procedures defined in 3GPP
TS 31.111 [92] clause 7.3 prior to the execution of the call setup.
When call control by USIM is applicable, the communication client shall
perform the call control (for example by using the Commands for USIM
application toolkit, see clause 12) and act upon the result of the call
control as follows:
\- if call control by USIM performs no modifications to the call request, the
call setup shall be executed without any changes to the data;
\- if call control by USIM modifies the call request, the call setup shall be
executed using the modified data as provided by the call control;
\- if call control by USIM modifies the call request to a different service,
the appropriate AT command(s) for that service shall be executed; and
\- if call control by USIM rejects the call request, the call setup shall not
be executed.
If the attempt to dial does not succeed, the command is terminated by ERROR /
+CME ERROR or +CDUI: \ and OK. Refer clause 9.2 for possible \
values.
Test command returns values supported as a compound value.

**Description**
Execution command dials a URI for initiating communication using the specified
communication client with the specified media profile by referencing either
the alphanumeric phonebook field, or the index or entry-number in the
phonebook. Supported clients URI schemes are those returned with +CDU=0. If
parameter \ is not included, the relevant phonebook is specified by
the current +CPBS setting. If the referenced URI is not found, OK is returned
and nothing is dialled.
+CDUP=0,\ originates a call to the first URI found in the selected
phonebook which has a partial or full match to \. The mechanism to search
for the first match through a phonebook is implementation specific. Upon no
match in the selected phonebook, it is manufacturer specific if and what
further phonebook memories are searched.
+CDUP=1,\ originates a call to the URI in memory location \, where
\ must contain a decimal number. The index or entry-number in the
phonebook is expressed by \.
How the string of digits or the index or entry-number is associated with
entries is implementation specific.
The command is terminated by +CDUP: \ and OK or ERROR / +CME ERROR.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
**Defined values**
\: integer type
0 Refers alphanumeric field of the phonebook. \ may contain valid
characters for alphanumeric field of the selected phonebook.

**Description**
Execution command causes the TA to initiate hangup and subsequently perform
call clearing of the call for which a \ was provided when the call
was detected in the MT. The parameter \ can be added to indicate
particular information on the cause for call clearing. Setting the parameter
\ to values 2 or 3 is typically relevant for call clearing before a
call has been established (e.g. an incoming or waiting call). The parameter
\ is ignored by the lower layers if it is not according to the
signalling procedures in question.
A special form of the execution command, +CHCCS=0, causes the TA to initiate
hangup and subsequently perform call clearing of all calls for which a \ was provided when the call was detected in the MT. The parameter
\ will be ignored if \=0.
The information text +CHCCSI: \ is provided for each call where a
successful hangup is initiated as result of the +CHCCS. If no hangup is
initiated, no information text is provided before OK is returned.
NOTE 1: The command +CHCCS=0 will initiate hangup of all calls with a \.
This also applies to calls on hold and call waiting calls.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
**Defined values**
\: integer type. Call identification number as described in 3GPP TS
22.030 [19] clause 6.5.5.1. This number can be used in +CHLD command
operations. Value range is from 1 to N. N, the maximum number of simultaneous
call control processes is implementation specific.
NOTE 2: When +CMCCS is supported, the call identification number is not reset
until the unsolicited result code +CMCCSI has indicated that the \=1

### 13.2.4 Define media profile +CDEFMP
Table 13.2.4-1: +CDEFMP parameter command syntax
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Command | Possible response(s) | +==================================+==================================+ | +CDEFMP | _+CME ERROR: \ _ | | =[\][,\] | | | | **When no \  but | | | \ provided and command | | | successful:** | | | | | | [+CDEFMP: \] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | +CDEFMP? | [ | | | +CDEFMP: \,\ | | | | | | [\\ | | | +CDEFMP: \,\ | | | | | | [...]]] | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | +CDEFMP=? | +CDEFMP: (range of supported | | | \s) | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
**Description**
A media profile is identified by its media profile identification number. A
media profile defines an SDP media description to be used in SDP offers and
SDP answers. Media profiles can be used with +CDU and +CDUP when dialling
URIs.
The set command specifies the SDP media description for a media profile
identified by the (local) media profile identification number, \.
When no \ value is provided then a new SDP media description is
defined and the media profile\'s identification number is returned by the
command\'s response. When an \ value is provided, the definition of
the SDP media description identified by the media profile identification
number \ is replaced with the SDP media description provided by the
command.
A special form of the set command, +CDEFMP=\ causes the SDP media
description for the indicated media profile to become undefined. Further,
+CDEFMP= causes the SDP media description for all defined media profiles to
become undefined.
The read command returns a list of all defined media profiles.
The test command returns values supported as a compound value.
Refer clause 9.2 for possible \ values.
**Defined values**
\: integer type. Media profile identification number. The parameter
is local to the TE-MT interface. The range of permitted values (minimum value
= 1) is returned by the test form of the command. The MT shall use the
indicated SDP media description for the \ in the initial SDP offer
for a call setup.
\: string type represented with IRA characters. SDP media description
including media level SDP lines. This parameter shall not be subject to
conventional character conversion as per +CSCS.
This parameter can contain the following types of SDP lines: SDP m-lines, SDP
a-lines and partial SDP m-lines.
The communication client in the MT shall take into account SDP a-line rtpmap
and fmtp attributes when negotiating media. Which other attributes in media
level SDP a-lines are taken into account by the communication client is
implementation specific.
Partial SDP m-lines include nothing but a media type.
For every media either an SDP m-line or a partial SDP m-line must be provided.
SDP m-lines indicate that the described media is encoded/decoded outside the
MT.
Partial SDP m-lines indicate that the described media is encoded/decoded by
the MT. When negotiating media the MT adds payload information to the partial
SDP m-line.
The communication client in the MT shall use the provided SDP line information
when negotiating media. The communication client shall add other SDP lines
required for negotiating media.
**Informative examples**
The MT handles encoding and decoding of audio media, and the TE supports two
types of video media, as described by the following SDP lines:
m=audio\ m=video 99 98\ a=rtpmap:99 H264/90000\ a=fmtp:99 profile-level-
id=4D4033\ a=rtpmap:98 MP4V-ES/90000\ a=fmtp:98 profile-level-id=1
To indicate its support for both audio and video media for an incoming or
outgoing call, the TE uses the following \:
\"m=audio\0D\0Am=video 99 98\0D\0Aa=rtpmap:99 H264/90000\0D\0Aa=fmtp:99
profile-level-id=4D4033\0D\0Aa=rtpmap:98 MP4V-ES/90000\0D\0Aa=fmtp:98 profile-
level-id=1\"
The TE intends to offer a file transfer over MSRP, as described by the
following SDP lines:
m=message 7654 TCP/MSRP *\ i=This is my latest picture\ a=sendonly\ a=accept-
types:message/cpim\ a=accept-wrapped-types:*\
a=path:msrp://atlanta.example.com:7654/jshA7we;tcp\ a=file-selector:name:\"My
cool picture.jpg\" type:image/jpeg
When proposing the MSRP file transfer to the remote party, the TE uses the
following \:
\"m=message 7654 TCP/MSRP *\0D\0Aa=sendonly\0D\0Aa=accept-
types:message/cpim\0D\0Aa=accept-wrapped-
types:*\0D\0Aa=path:msrp://atlanta.example.com:7654/jshA7we;tcp\0D\0Aa=file-
selector:name:\22My cool picture.jpg\22 type:image/jpeg\"
NOTE: The SDP i-line is not provided as part of the \ value.

Optional.
### 13.2.5 Control and modify media description +CCMMD
Table 13.2.5-1: +CCMMD parameter command syntax
Command Possible response(s)
* * *
+CCMMD=\,\[,\]  
+CCMMD?  
+CCMMD=?
**Description**
This command allows control of the media used in a multimedia call. The
command can be used to initiate modification of the media of an ongoing call,
to accept, modify or reject incoming changes in media or to accept, modify or
reject the media for an incoming call. Supported media types are typically
audio, video and messaging (MSRP).
When \ matches the index of an ongoing call, the TA/MT will attempt
to add or remove media to the call by triggering an SDP renegotiation over the
SIP protocol.
When \=1, the set command requests an unconditional change the
media of the call to that described by \.
When \=2, the set command proposes a change of media to that
described by \, to which the remote party has to respond before the
media of the call is changed. The response from the remote party will be
indicated in a +CMCCSI unsolicited result code. If the remote party accepts
the change of media, the \ value in +CMCCSI will be set to 3. If
the remote party rejects the change of media, \ will be set to 4.
In both cases the \ value in +CMCCSI will describe the currently
active media of the call (if any).
If the remote party unconditionally changes the media of the call, this will
be indicated in a +CMCCSI unsolicited result code, with \=1 and
\ containing the updated (and now active) media description.
If the remote party proposes to change the media of an ongoing call, this will
be indicated in a +CMCCSI unsolicited result code, with \=2. The
set command is used to respond to the proposal, either by accepting it by
setting \=3, by rejecting it by setting \=4, or
indicate that a subset of the incoming proposal is accepted by setting the
\=3 along with the \ containing the subset of the incoming
proposal is acceptable.
When the MT receives an incoming call from a remote party, the +CMCCSI
unsolicited result code will be sent to the TE with \=2. This
proposed media for the new call is either accepted, modified or rejected as
described above.
**Defined values**
\: integer type. Call identification number as defined in the
+CMCCS and +CLCCS commands.
\: integer type
> 1 The \ parameter describes the desired set of media for the call.
>
> 2 The \ parameter describes a proposal for a new set of media for
> the call.
>
> 3 Accept the most recently received media proposal. The \ parameter
> describes the accepted media for the call.
>
> 4 Reject the most recently received media proposal.
>
> \: string type represented with IRA characters. Media description as
> per the +CDEFMP command. This parameter shall not be subject to conventional
> character conversion as per +CSCS.
**Implementation**
Optional.

# 14 Commands for eMBMS configuration
## 14.1 General
This clause defines AT commands that a TE may use to control MT supporting
evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service (eMBMS). eMBMS is a
unidirectional point-to-multipoint service in which data is transmitted from a
single source entity to a group of users in a specific area. eMBMS services
are transmitted on the same carrier frequencies used by mobile operators to
provide other typical services such as voice calls and internet. There are
various types of eMBMS services that can be provided to the end user such as
Mobile TV, streaming, file download, etc.
eMBMS information is sent over SystemInformationBlockType13 information
element (SIB-13) according to 3GPP TS 36.331 [86] clause 6.3.1. Information on
eMBMS parameters can be found in 3GPP TS 36.443 [150] and 3GPP TS 29.061 [39].
A comprehensive set of eMBMS-specific commands is defined to provide the
flexibility needed by the more complex MT. The commands are designed to be
expandable to accommodate new eMBMS feature options and interface protocols,
merely by defining new values for many of the parameters. The commands use the
extended information and error message capabilities described in this
specification.
The +CEMBMSCFG command enables or disables the eMBMS support in the MT. Once
the eMBMS service is enabled then the status of the eMBMS session can be
received by enabling the URC using the +CEMBSR command. The +CEMBSR command
also provides information about the TMGI and eMBMS session being used by the
MT. The +CEMBMSDATA command can be used by the MT to configure the data
channel to use for receiving eMBMS services. The +CEMBMSSRV command is used to
configure and activate the eMBMS service for a specific TMGI and listen for
any service change indications. The +CEMBMSCNT command can be used to set the
list of TMGIs from which the MT can receive eMBMS services.

## 15.1 General
This clause defines AT commands that a TE can use to control MT test loop
function for UE test loop and UTC time reset as specified in 3GPP TS 36.509
[142].
The UE test loop function provides access to isolated functions of the UE via
the radio interface without introducing new physical interfaces just for the
reason of conformance testing. The UE test loop function is activated by
transmitting the appropriate TC message to the UE. The +CATM command activates
and deactivates the UE test mode procedure and sets the UE into test loop
mode. The +CCUTLE command opens and closes the UE test loop mode E function in
the UE for either transmitting or receiving of V2X communication packets. Only
UE test loop mode E is supported by AT commands.
The +CUSPCREQ command requests the UE to report the counter of successful
reception of sidelink PSCCH transport blocks, STCH PDCP SDU packets and PSSCH
transport blocks.
The +CUTCR command resets the UTC time previously calculated from GNSS in the
UE.
The +CCBRREQ command requests the UE to report the channel busy ratio (CBR).
The +CV2XDTS command triggers the UE to start or stop sending V2X data over
E-UTRA or NR PC5.

## 16.1 General
This clause defines AT commands that a TE may use to control MT supporting VAE
layer. The VAE layer supports V2X communication over LTE-Uu as defined in 3GPP
TS 24.486 [172].
A comprehensive set of VAE layer-specific commands is defined to provide the
flexibility needed by the more complex MT. The commands are designed to be
expandable to accommodate new VAE layer feature options and interface
protocols, merely by defining new values for many of the parameters. The
commands use the extended information and error message capabilities described
in the present specification.
The +CVAEACT command activate or deactivate the VAE layer support in the MT by
performing the V2X service discovery procedure according to 3GPP TS 24.486
[172] clause 6.6. Once the VAE layer is enabled, then the MT can request the
registration of V2X service identifier(s) by performing the V2X UE
registration procedure according to 3GPP TS 24.486 [172] clause 6.2 using the
+CVAEREG command.

+----------------+----------------+--------------+----------------+
NOTE: The table B.1 is as an overview of the result codes, hence the complete
syntax of the result codes is not shown.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Commands from TIA IS‑101
# C.1 Introduction
The \"Voice Control Interim Standard for Asynchronous DCE\", TIA IS‑101,
contains some commands that are useful when passing audio \"data\" (that is,
data which represents audio information) between the computer and the TA.
Some of the following clauses describe commands from IS‑101 which are central
to this TA application. However, with the exception of necessary extensions,
these descriptions are not intended to replace the definitions found in
IS‑101. Other novel commands from the interim standard are not included
because they are peripheral to TA operation.
NOTE 1: IS‑101 also uses ITU‑T Recommendation V.250 [14] AT commands, but
these are not mentioned here.
The standard specifies the following modes:
‑ command mode, where there is no transfer of audio \"data\" between the TA
and the computer. In command mode, the computer is neither sending audio data
to the TA nor receiving audio data from the TA.
‑ transmit mode, where audio \"data\" is being transferred from the computer
to the TA. No audio \"data\" is transferred from the TA to the computer in
this state. A transition back to command mode occurs when an embedded command
indicates \"end of play\" or \"flush data\", or an inactivity timer times out.
‑ receive mode, where audio \"data\" is being transferred from the TA to the
computer. No audio \"data\" is transferred from the computer to the TA in this
state. A transition back to command mode occurs when any command is sent from
the computer, or an inactivity timer times out. During the receive mode, the
TA embeds result codes into the audio \"data\". These result codes indicate
pertanent events such as \"silence detected\", \"busy detected\", and so on.
Strictly, the standard specifies another mode (translation), but this is not
directly of interest here.
NOTE 2: The TA \"knows\" the type of an incoming call (whether it is voice,
data, fax, whatever), and certain POTS events cannot occur. Hence some
standard result codes for indication of events and discrimination of call type
are unnecessary.
There are three possible levels of service:
‑ a TA supporting level A performs the following operations and detects the
following events: audio transmit, audio receive, DTMF detection, DTMF
generation and single tone generation. The following indications are
supported:
Event Description Handset state
3 ring idle
4 DTMF received idle
5 receive buffer overrun receive
6 unsolicited fax request idle
8 phone on/off hook idle
9 presumed hangup receive
10 presumed end of message receive
18 ringback idle
19 busy idle
23 playback buffer underrun transmit
25 fax or data request acknowledged idle
‑ a TA supporting level B performs the operations and events of level A, and
also supports DTMF detection while in the transmit state.
‑ a TA supporting level C performs the operations and events of level B, and
also supports double DTMF tone generation.
Since DTMF detection and generation cannot be guaranteed over current digital
networks, it follows that none of the three levels of service can be
supported.
# C.2 Commands
## C.2.1 Select mode +FCLASS
This command puts the TA into a particular mode of operation (data, fax, voice
etc.). This causes the TA to process information in a manner suitable for that
type of information (rather than for other types of information). The values
and meanings of parameter \ are specified in the following table.
\ Mode
0 data
1 fax class 1 (TIA‑578‑A)
1.0 fax class 1 (ITU‑T Recommendation T.31 [11])
2 fax (manufacturer specific)
2.0 fax class 2 (ITU‑T Recommendation T.32 [12] and TIA‑592)
3...7 reserved for other fax modes
8 voice
9...15 reserved for other voice modes
16..79 reserved
80 VoiceView (Radish)
81..255 reserved
Table C.1: +FCLASS parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Return +FCLASS=\  
+FCLASS? \ +FCLASS=? (list of supported \s)
* * *
Voice mode is of particular interest here, and has an additional result code
+VCON. Specifically, +VCON indicates that the TA is entering the voice command
mode and there is a voice connection to at least one audio input or output.
This presupposes that some mechanism has previously initiated a connection to
that audio I/O.
## C.2.2 Buffer threshold setting +VBT
This refers to integers \ and \ that indicate levels within the TA
transmit buffer at which flow control is asserted and deasserted. The buffer
is used for averaging out the irregular timing of data from the computer, so
that the data becomes synchronous and may be sent to some audio device.
Table C.2: +VBT parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Return +VBT=\,\  
+VBT? \,\ +VBT=? (list of supported \s),(list of supported
\s),(buffer size)
* * *
## C.2.3 Calling number ID presentation +VCID
The command refers to an integer that allows a called party to enable or
disable (\=0) the reporting of the ID of calling parties, and specifies the
method of presentation of the ID. This is basically the same as the
supplementary service CLIP (Calling Line Identification Presentation). The
presentation may be either formatted (\=1) or unformatted (\=2):
‑ Formatted presentation: data items are reported in the form of
\=\ pairs.
\ \
DATE MMDD (month, day)
TIME HHMM (hour, minute)
NMBR calling number or P or O (P = number is private, O = number is
unavailable)
NAME subscription listing name
MESG data from other (unknown) tags
‑ Unformatted presentation: the data is presented in ASCII hex as printable
numbers.
Table C.3: +VCID parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Return +VCID=\  
+VCID? \ +VCID=? (0‑2)
* * *
## C.2.4 Receive gain selection +VGR
This refers to the amplification by the TA of audio samples sent from the TA
to the computer. The command operates on an integer \, range 0...255.
Values larger than 128 indicate a larger gain than nominal. Values less than
128 indicate a smaller gain than nominal. The entire range of 0...255 does not
have to be provided. A value of zero implies the use of automatic gain control
by the TA.
Table C.4: +VGR parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Return +VGR=\  
+VGR? \ +VGR=? (list of supported \s)
* * *
## C.2.5 Transmit gain selection +VGT
This refers to the amplification by the TA of audio samples sent from the
computer to the TA. The command operates on an integer \, range 0...255.
Values larger than 128 indicate a larger gain than nominal. Values less than
128 indicate a smaller gain than nominal. The entire range of 0...255 does not
have to be provided. A value of zero implies the uses of automatic gain
control by the TA.
Table C.5: +VGT parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Return +VGT=\  
+VGT? \ +VGT=? (list of supported \s)
* * *
## C.2.6 Initialise voice parameters +VIP
This recalls manufacturer determined settings \ of voice parameters. The
command is write only. The effect of the command is manufacturer specific.
Table C.6: +VIP action command syntax
* * *
Command Return +VIP=\  
+VIP=? (list of supported \s)
* * *
## C.2.7 Inactivity timer +VIT
This refers to the value of the inactivity timer in the TA. It is used to
monitor activity on the connection between the computer and the TA when the
computer is in \"transmit\" mode and sending audio data to the TA. When the
connection has been inactive for the time set by this command, the TA leaves
\"transmit\" mode and reverts to command mode. An integer \ different than
zero implies a time of \/10 seconds. A value of zero disables the timer.
Table C.7: +VIT parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Return +VIT=\  
+VIT? \ +VIT=? (list of supported \s)
* * *
## C.2.8 Line selection +VLS
This determines the selection of sources and destinations of audio samples. An
integer is used to label a particular combination of sources and destinations.
The integer is defined in an entry in IS‑101 which assumes as a model a TA, a
local phone and a phone line. Two additional \"manufacturer specific\"
configurations (16,17) are defined.
‑ label=0: this is the idle state ‑ the phone is not connected to the radio
network and no audio paths are used.
‑ label=1: the phone is connected to the radio network and no audio paths
involving the internal microphone or internal loudspeaker are selected. This
allows the computer to transmit audio data over the radio transmitter by
selecting \"transmit mode\":

* * *
‑ label=7: the phone is connected to the radio network. The internal
microphone is connected to the radio transmitter. The radio receiver is
connected to the internal loudspeaker. This allows the computer to enable
normal phone operation (a human holding a conversation) by selecting command
mode.

* * *
+VCON is returned if an audio path is established or if a connection is made
to the radio network.
**Manufacturer specific extension (reserved as such by IS‑101)**
‑ label=16: the phone is connected to the radio network. There is a path to
the internal microphone, which is also connected to the radio transmitter.
There is a path to the radio receiver, which is also connected to the internal
loudspeaker. This allows the computer to record the sum of transmitted and
received audio by selecting \"receive mode\".

* * *
‑ label=17: the phone is connected to the radio system and there is a path to
the internal loudspeaker and to the radio transmitter. This allows the
computer to simultaneously play sound and send audio over the radio by
selecting \"transmit mode\".

## C.2.9 Receive data state +VRX
This action command causes the TA to get audio data from a source determined
by the +VLS command, and send it to the computer. Once the datastream has
started, any result codes will be embedded in the data and shielded using the
normal \ methods. The receive process is terminated when the computer
sends any command to the TA, or by time‑out of the inactivity timer. The
command is write only.

## C.2.10 Select compression method +VSM
This selects the voice compression method \, the voice sampling rate
\, the silence compression sensitivity \, and a parameter related to
silence expansion \. There are several choices of compression method.
IS‑101 does not specify methods, but here is a list of some usual compression
methods:
Name Communications system
GSM/full‑rate GSM
GSM/half‑rate GSM
ADPCM/G.721 DECT, CT2
ADPCM/G.723 DECT, CT2
ADPCM/G.726 DECT, CT2
ADPCM/G.727 DECT, CT2
SIGNED PCM POTS
Table C.17: +VSM parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Return +VSM=\,\,\,\  
+VSM? \,\,\,\ +VSM=? _complex; refer IS‑101_
* * *
NOTE: A value of \=0 implies no silence compression sensitivity. A value
of \=0 implies no silence expansion.
## C.2.11 DTMF and tone generation +VTS
This command allows the transmission of DTMF tones and arbitrary tones (see
NOTE 1). These tones may be used (for example) when announcing the start of a
recording period. The command is write only. In this profile of commands, this
command does not operate in data or fax modes of operation (+FCLASS=0,1,2‑7).
NOTE 1: D is used only for dialling.
The string parameter of the command consists of combinations of the following
separated by commas:
1\. \. A single ASCII character in the set 0‑9, #,*,A‑D. This is
interpreted as a single ACSII character whose duration is set by the +VTD
command.
NOTE 2: In GSM this operates only in voice mode.
2\. [\,\,\]. This is interpreted as a dual tone of
frequencies \ and \, lasting for a time \ (in 10 ms
multiples).
NOTE 3: This does not operate in GSM.
3\. {\,\}. This is interpreted as a DTMF tone of different
duration from that mandated by the +VTD command.
NOTE 4: In GSM this operates only in voice mode.
Table C.18: +VTS action command syntax
* * *
Command Return +VTS=_as above_  
+VTS=? (list of supported \s),(list of supported \s),(list of
supported \s)
* * *
## C.2.12 Tone duration +VTD
This refers to an integer \ that defines the length of tones emitted as a
result of the +VTS command. This does not affect the D command. A value
different than zero causes a tone of duration \/10 seconds. The value zero
causes a \"manufacturer specific\" value.
Table C.19: +VTD parameter command syntax
* * *
Command Return +VTD=\  
+VTD? \ +VTD=? (list of supported \s)
* * *
NOTE: In GSM/UMTS the value of tone duration is preset and cannot be altered.
## C.2.13 Transmit data state +VTX
This action command causes the TA to receive audio data from the computer and
send it to a destination determined by the +VLS command. Once the audio
datastream has started, commands to the TA shall be embedded in the data
stream, and shielded using the normal \ methods. The transmit process is
terminated by the use of embedded commands or by the time‑out of an inactivity
timer. It is recommended that the TA has a buffer to allow the TA to convert
potentially bursty data from the computer into synchronous data for
\"transmission\". The command is write only.

Command Return +VTX CONNECT
