KPI Key Performance Indicator
Rel 3GPP Release
# 4 Rel-17 Executive Summary
Release 17 is dedicated to consolidate and enhance the concepts and
functionalities introduced in the previous Releases, while introducing a small
number of brand new Features.
The improvements relate to all the key areas of the previous Releases:
services to the industry (the \"verticals\"), including positioning, private
network, etc.; improvements for several aspects of 5G supporting Internet of
Things (IoT), both in the Core Network and in the Access Network, of proximity
(direct) communications between mobiles, in particular in the context of
autonomous driving (V2X), in several media aspects of the user plane related
to the entertainment industry (codec, streaming, broadcasting) and also of the
support of Mission Critical communications. Furthermore, a number of network
functionalities have been improved, e.g. for slicing, traffic steering and
Edge-computing.
The Radio interface and the Access Network have been significantly improved
too (MIMO, Repeaters, 1024QAM modulation for downlink, etc.). While most of
the improvements target 5G/NR radio access (or are access-agnostic), some
improvements are dedicated to 4G/LTE access. Such improvements are clearly
identified in the title and in the chapters where they appear.
Note: To avoid terminology such as \"even further improvements of...\", the
successive enhancements are now referred to as \"Phase n\": \"phase 2\" refers
to the first series of enhancements, \"Phase 3\" to the enhancements of the
enhancements, etc. In this transition Release, the \"Phase n\" way of
referring to successive enhancements has not always been used consistently nor
enforced.
As for the new Features, the main new Feature of this Release is the support
of satellite access, and a dedicated chapter covers this topic.
Note that the classifications, groupings and order of appearance of the
Features in this document reflect a number of choices by the editor as there
is no \"3GPP endorsement\" for classification/order. This Executive Summary
has also been written by the editor and represents his view.

Network aspects\".
**[Introduction]{.underline}**
The \" Integration of satellite components in the 5G architecture" work item
adds or enhances a number of features in 5GCore architecture in order to
support Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), for several use cases:
  * Coverage extension: Many commercial activities, such as agriculture, mining, forestry take place outside inhabited areas. Coverage extension with satellite networks is useful to enable e.g. voice communication, video monitoring, and remote control in uncovered or under-covered areas.
  * Internet of Things: many Internet-of-Things applications relate to monitoring of assets (e.g. ships, trains, trucks), infrastructure (e.g. bridges, pipelines, railway track), or the environment (e.g. agriculture sensors). In many IoT applications, only small amounts of data are exchanged and communication is optimized for low power usage. Satellite communication should also be able to address these requirements.
  * Disaster communication: Public safety authorities have a responsibility to provide assistance in case of natural disasters. This requires communication, also in cases where because of that disaster the cellular infrastructure is damaged. Satellite communication can be used as fall back for these cases. Ideally the user equipment (UE) and way of working when cellular networks are available should also be usable with satellite access.
  * Global roaming: Applications like tracking and tracing of containers need to be available globally across satellite and terrestrial networks. When a container is in a harbour or transported on a truck, using a terrestrial cellular network is probably most efficient. However, when the container is on a ship in the middle of an ocean, only satellite communication is possible.
  * Broadcasting: Satellite communication is particularly suitable to broadcast the same information over a very wide area. This can also be used in context of 5G mobile edge applications (e.g. mobile gaming), where application content needs to be available in many different edge locations.
To address such use cases, 3GPP has set Key Performance Indicator (KPI)
targets for satellite in TS 22.261 [1].
At 5G Core Network architecture level, in SA2, a dedicated study on
architecture aspects for using satellite access in 5G (FS_5GSAT_ARCH) was
conducted to select the solutions able to cope with satellite specific key
issues. The outcome of the study (TR 23.737 [2]) identifies the impacts of
satellite integration in the 5GS and solutions to adjust the 5G system
accordingly.
The 5GSAT_ARCH work item, following the study, updated architecture
specifications (TS 23.501 [4], TS 23.502 [5], TS 23.503 [6]) to implement the
solutions identified.
In CT1, TR 24.821 [3] studied \"Non-Terrestrial Impact of PLMN selection
procedure\" and, following 5GSAT_ARCH_CT, led to update TS 23.122 [7] and TS
24.501 [8].
Furthermore, RAN has defined \"3GPP defined radio access networks supporting
non-Terrestrial Networks\" [10], described in the next clause.
**[Architectural/general aspects]{.underline}**
A PLMN core network can be connected to a satellite NG-RAN. A satellite NG-RAN
can be shared between more than one core networks.
Satellite NG-RAN can be used as a new RAN 3GPP access but also as backhaul
between the core and terrestrial access network, providing a transport for the
N1/N2/N3 reference points.
Multi-connectivity and URLLC over satellite are not considered in Rel-17.
Basic assumptions are that UEs are equipped with GNSS, and transparent mode:
satellites (LEO/MEO/GEO) are relaying the Uu interface only at physical layer
level.
_[Impacts on 5GC of Satellite NG-RAN used as new RAN 3GPP access]{.underline}_
In Rel-17, only direct access with transparent satellite is considered, as
shown in following figure:
Figure 1: Direct access with transparent satellite
Impacts of satellites onto 5GS are linked to the size of the cells (larger
than the terrestrial ones), the fact that the satellite cells can be fix on
earth, when beam is steerable, but also moving on earth, when beam is not
steerable. This characteristics impacts 5GS mobility management, i.e. the
management of the handover of radio bearer between nodes and the management of
the reachability of a UE for downlink services (paging), that need to be
adapted to take into account both the satellite beam size and fix or moving
cells configuration.
A basic assumption in Re-17 is that tracking areas (TAs) and cell identities
(cell IDs) refer to specific geographical areas, so that 5G services can use
these identifiers as representation of a UE location.
To avoid Tracking Area Codes (TAC) fluctuations, in the moving cells case, it
has been decided that the Radio Access Network will broadcast in the cell the
list of Tracking Area Codes, corresponding to tracking areas that have been
define on the earth surface through network planning, for the zone currently
enlighten by the radio cell.
New Radio Access Technology types are introduced in the 5GC to distinguish
between different satellite configurations (LEO, MEO, GEO, other).
The distance earth -- satellite also introduces higher delay values than for
terrestrial cells and new 5QI is also introduced in TR 23.501 [4] to cope with
this delay, depending on the satellite RAT type.
_[Impacts on 5GC of Satellite NG-RAN used as backhaul]{.underline}_
Rel-17 only considers backhauling with constant delay. Here, the satellite
operator is able to mask any delay changes in service/feeder links by
exploiting the knowledge of the satellite position to calculate how much
variable delay should be added to keep the overall delay constant. Connecting
gNBs to 5GC via, e.g., a single GEO satellite or a single NGSO satellite
without ISLs are examples of such backhauling as shown in following figure.
{width="3.6569444444444446in" height="0.7166666666666667in"}
Figure 2: satellite backhauling with constant delay
Backhauling with constant delay minimizes the impact on the 3GPP network
architecture. However, there are following new features introduced in TR
23.501 [4] related to the QoS aspects of satellite backhauling:
o Reporting of satellite backhaul category to the 5G Core Network.
o New 5G QoS Indicator (5QI) defined for satellite backhaul and satellite
access.
**[Terminal and Core Network aspects]{.underline}**
PLMN selection procedure is updated for satellite integration in 5GS. Then, in
the continuity of the study done in TR 24.821 [3], the following aspects of UE
impact at the NAS layer (including PLMN selection) have ben specified by CT1:
\- New "NG-RAN satellite" RAT type in USIM
\- Extension of the NAS supervision timers over satellite access for GEO and
MEO RAT types (LEO uses legacy timers)
\- Modification of the higher priority PLMN selection procedure to include
shared MCC 9xx
\- New minimum periodic search timer for higher priority PLMN search over
satellite access when PLMN uses shared MCC
\- New trigger for PLMN selection upon transition in/out international areas
(based on UE implementation)
\- New Forbidden List of PLMNs not allowed to operate at UE location and its
handling
\- New 5GMM cause value#78 and its handling (related to the list in the
previous bullet)
\- Support for multiple TACs for the same PLMN broadcast in the radio cell,
including corresponding logic for determining the "Current TAI" and impact on
ME-USIM procedures
There are corresponding network impacts.

**[Introduction]{.underline}**
This Rel-17 RAN WI \"Solutions for NR to support Non-Terrestrial Networks
(NTN)\" introduces support of non-terrestrial networks into the NR protocol
and NG-RAN architecture. NTN refers to networks, or segments of networks,
using a spaceborne vehicle or an airborne vehicle for transmission, defined as
follows:
â€¢ Spaceborne vehicles: Geosynchronous (GSO) and Non-Geosynchronous (NGSO)
orbiting satellites. NGSO includes Low Earth Orbit at altitude approximately
between 300 km and 1500 km and Medium Earth Orbit at altitude approximately
between 7000 km and 25000 km.
â€¢ Airborne vehicles: High Altitude Platforms (HAPs) encompassing Unmanned
Aircraft Systems (UAS) including Lighter than Air UAS (LTA), Heavier than Air
UAS (HTA), all operating in altitudes typically between 8 and 50 km, quasi-
stationary.
This clause present the RAN aspects while the System and core network aspects
(\"5GSAT_ARCH\") are covered in the next clause.
The addressed radio specifics of NTN compared to 5G terrestrial networks
include
â€¢ Delay variation, Doppler variation as well as possible Earth moving radio
cells, due to the motion of space/airborne vehicles
â€¢ Long latency due to the altitude of the space/airborne vehicles
â€¢ Differential delay and possible multi country cell coverage due to larger
radio cell size
â€¢ Different propagation channel model (See 3GPP 38.811)
â€¢ Different radio unit performance due to specific payload performance
**[Overall architecture and general aspects]{.underline}**
As illustrated in Figure 1, non-terrestrial access is provided by means of an
NTN payload, i.e. a network node on-board a satellite or HAPS, and an NTN
Gateway interconnected by a feeder link, the UE accessing NTN network services
through the NTN payload via a service link.
Figure 1: Overall illustration of an NTN (from TS 38.300 [4])
The NTN payload transparently forwards the radio protocol received from the UE
(via the service link) to the NTN Gateway (via the feeder link) and vice-
versa. A gNB may serve multiple NTN payloads while an NTN payload may be
served by multiple gNBs.
Three types of service links are supported:
\- Earth-fixed: provisioned by beam(s) continuously covering the same
geographical areas all the time (e.g., the case of GSO satellites);
\- Quasi-Earth-fixed: provisioned by beam(s) covering one geographic area for
a limited period and a different geographic area during another period (e.g.,
the case of NGSO satellites generating steerable beams);
\- Earth-moving: provisioned by beam(s) whose coverage area slides over the
Earth surface (e.g., the case of NGSO satellites generating fixed or non-
steerable beams).
With NGSO satellites, the NTN gNB can provide either quasi-Earth-fixed cell
coverage or Earth-moving cell coverage, while gNB operating with GSO satellite
can provide Earth fixed cell coverage.
_[Timing, Synchronization and HARQ enhancements (RAN1)]{.underline}_
The network broadcast ephemeris information and common Timing Advance (common
TA) parameters in each NTN cell. Since NTN capable UE are expected to be all
GNSS-capable, they shall acquire a valid GNSS position as well as the
satellite ephemeris and common TA before connecting to an NTN cell.
To achieve uplink synchronisation, before performing random access, the UE
shall autonomously pre-compensate the Timing Advance, as well as the frequency
Doppler shift by considering the common TA (information from the gNB), the UE
position, the satellite position and satellite velocity through the satellite
ephemeris. In connected mode, the UE shall continuously update the Timing
Advance and frequency pre-compensation. If the UE does not have a valid GNSS
position and/or valid satellite ephemeris, it does not communicate with the
network until both are regained. The UEs may be configured to report Timing
Advance at initial access or in connected mode. In connected mode triggered
reporting of the Timing Advance is supported.
While the pre-compensation of the instantaneous Doppler shift experienced on
the service link is to be performed by the UE for the uplink, the management
of Doppler shift experienced over the feeder link is left to the network
implementation.
To accommodate the propagation delay in NTNs, several timing relationships are
enhanced by a Common Timing Advance (Common TA) and two scheduling offsets and
. is a configured offset that corresponds to the Round Trip Time (RTT) between
the Reference Point (RP) and the NTN payload. is a configured scheduling
offset that approximately corresponds to the sum of the service link RTT and
the common TA. is a configured offset that approximately corresponds to the
RTT between the RP and the gNB.
To mitigate the impact of HARQ stalling in NTN the HARQ feedback can be
disabled in the presence of ARQ re-transmissions at the RLC layer (e.g., in
GSO satellite systems) and/or the number of HARQ processes for re-
transmissions at the MAC layer can be increased to 32 (e.g., in NGSO satellite
systems).
_[Mobility Management (RAN2)]{.underline}_
To enable mobility in NTN, the network provides serving cell\'s and
neighbouring cell\'s satellite ephemeris needed to access the target serving
NTN cell in the handover command.
UE supports mobility between NTN and Terrestrial Network (i.e. from NTN to
Terrestrial Network (hand-in) and from Terrestrial Network to NTN (hand-out)),
but is not required to connect to both NTN and Terrestrial Network at the same
time. It may also support mobility between radio access technologies based on
different orbit (GSO, NGSO at different altitude).
Triggering conditions upon which UE may execute Conditional Hand-Over (CHO) to
a candidate cell, have been introduced: event A4, time-based trigger
condition, location-based trigger condition. The two last conditions are
configured together with one of the measurement-based trigger conditions.
Location is defined by the distance between UE and a reference location. Time
is defined by the time between T1 and T2, where T1 is an absolute time value
and T2 is a duration started at T1.
For the measurements the network can configure multiple SS/PBCH Block
Measurement Timing Configuration (SMTCs) in parallel per carrier and for a
given set of cells depending on UE capabilities using propagation delay
difference and ephemeris information. It can also configure measurement gaps
based on multiple SMTC.
The adjustment of SMTCs is possible under network control based on UE
assistance information if available for connected mode and under UE control
based on UE location and satellite assistance information (e.g., ephemeris,
common TA parameters) for idle/inactive modes.
In the quasi-earth fixed cell scenario, UE can perform time-based and
location-based measurement in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE. The timing and location
information associated to a cell are provided via system information. They
refer respectively to the time when the serving cell is going to stop serving
a geographical area and to the reference location of serving cell.
A Tracking Area corresponds to a fixed geographical area. Any respective
mapping is configured in the RAN. The network may broadcast multiple Tracking
Area Codes (TAC) per PLMN in a NR NTN cell in order to reduce the signalling
load at cell edge, in particular for Earth-moving cell coverage. A TAC change
in the System Information is under network control and may not be exactly
synchronised with real-time illumination of beams on ground.
Regarding the UE location aspects, upon network request, after AS security is
established in connected mode, a UE should report its coarse UE location
information (most significant bits of the GNSS coordinates, ensuring an
accuracy in the order of 2 km) to the NG-RAN if available.
_[Switch-over (RAN3)]{.underline}_
A service link switch refers to a change of serving satellite.
A feeder link switch over is the procedure where the feeder link is changed
from a source NTN Gateway to a target NTN Gateway for a specific NTN payload.
The feeder link switch over is a Transport Network Layer procedure. Both hard
and soft feeder link switch over are applicable to NTN.
Service and feeder link switch overs apply mostly for the case of NGSO.
_[NG-RAN signalling (RAN3)]{.underline}_
The Cell Identity, indicated by the gNB to the Core Network as part of the
User Location Information corresponds to a Mapped Cell ID, irrespective of the
orbit of the NTN payload or the types of service links supported. It is used
for Paging Optimization in NG interface, Area of Interest and Public Warning
Services.
The Cell Identity included within the target identification of the handover
messages allows identifying the correct target radio cell as well as for RAN
paging.
The mapping between Mapped Cell IDs and geographical areas is configured in
the RAN and Core Network. The gNB is responsible for constructing the Mapped
Cell ID based on the UE location info received from the UE, if available. The
mapping may be pre-configured (e.g., up to operator\'s policy) or up to
implementation.
The gNB reports the broadcasted TAC(s) of the selected Public Land Mobile
Network (PLMN) to the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) as part of
UE Location Information (ULI). In case the gNB knows the UE\'s location
information, the gNB may determine the Tracking Area Indicator (TAI) the UE is
currently located in and provide that TAI to the AMF as part of ULI.
_[AMF (Re-)Selection by gNB (RAN3)]{.underline}_
For a RRC_CONNECTED UE, when the gNB is configured to ensure that the UE
connects to an AMF that serves the country in which the UE is located. If the
gNB detects that the UE is in a different country to that served by the
serving AMF, then it should perform an NG handover to change to an appropriate
AMF, or initiate an UE Context Release Request procedure towards the serving
AMF (in which case the AMF may decide to de-register the UE).
_[O &M Requirements (RAN3)]{.underline}_
The NTN related parameters, as listed in clause 16.14.7 of TS 38.300, shall be
provided by O&M to the gNB providing non-terrestrial access. Additional NTN
related parameters in Annex B4 of TS 38.300 may be provided by O&M to the gNB
for its operation.
_[RF performances and RRM requirements (RAN4)]{.underline}_
Based on coexistence studies captured in TR 38.863, the minimum RF and
performance requirements in FR1 for respectively NR User Equipment (UE)
supporting satellite access operation and NR Satellite Access Node (SAN) are
defined in TS 38.101-5 and TS 38.108.
Figure 2 illustrate the satellite access node which encompass on ground non-
NTN infrastructure gNB functions, gateway and feeder link and the RF functions
of the NTN payload.

Figure 2: Satellite Access Node (SAN) (from TS 38.108 [16])
The considered operating bands in frequency range FR1 are defined in Table 1:
Table 1: Satellite operating bands [16]
+-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------+ | Satellite | Uplink (UL) | Downlink (DL) | Duplex mode | | _operating |_ operating | _operating | | | band_ | band _\ | band_ \ | | | | SAN receive / | SAN transmit / | | | | UE transmit | UE receive | | | | | | | | | F~UL,low~ -- | F~DL,low~ -- | | | | F~UL,high~ | F~DL,high~ | | +=================+=================+=================+=============+ | n256 | 1980 MHz -- | 2170 MHz -- | FDD | | | 2010 MHz | 2200 MHz | | +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------+ | n255 | 1626.5 MHz -- | 1525 MHz -- | FDD | | | 1660.5 MHz | 1559 MHz | | +-----------------+-----------------+-----------------+-------------+
RF requirements of an NTN capable UE (as defined in TS 38.101-5) requires the
same RF performance as UE operating with terrestrial network. This allows
connectivity to both NTN or Terrestrial Network.
Note that RF requirements of the SAN as defined in TS 38.108 [16] are lower
compared to the BS RF requirements of a terrestrial network as defined in TS
38.104 [19].
Specific requirements for radio resource management in NTN are defined in TS
38.133. They mostly relate to specific delay as well as timing and frequency
errors in the different procedures.
In addition to SAN, RF requirements of HAPS were defined in TS 38.104 [19] as
HAPS BS class which refers to Wide Area BS class without additional changes.
NR operating band n1 can be applied for HAPS operation, as defined in TS
38.104 [19].
NR UEs as defined by current TS 38.101-1 can support HAPS deployments with no
additional changes needed in TS 38.101-1.

Summary based on the input provided by MediaTek Inc. in SP-220455 (merge of
RP-221547 and CP-221272).
The \"NB-IoT/eMTC support for Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN)\" work item
specifies enhanced features necessary for the support of Bandwidth reduced Low
complexity (BL) UEs, UEs in enhanced coverage and NB-IoT UEs by Non-
Terrestrial Networks (NTN).
SA and CT aspects of NB-IoT/eMTC Non-Terrestrial Networks in EPS provide
minimum essential functionality for the Rel-17 UE and the network to support
satellite E-UTRAN access in WB-S1 mode or NB-S1 mode with CIoT EPS
optimization. The functionality is largely aligned with that of Rel-17 NR Non-
Terrestrial Networks in 5GS, with the exception of discontinuous coverage that
is addressed only within the present work item in Rel-17.
**[Overall architecture and general aspects:]{.underline}**
E-UTRAN supports radio access over non-terrestrial networks for BL UEs, UEs in
enhanced coverage and NB-IoT UEs. Non-terrestrial networks encompasses
platforms that provide radio access through satellites in Geosynchronous
orbits (GSO) as well as Non-Geosynchronous Orbit (NGSO), which includes Low-
Earth Orbit (LEO) and Medium Earth Orbit (MEO).
As illustrated in Figure 1, non-terrestrial access is provided by means of an
NTN payload, i.e. a network node on-board a satellite, and an NTN Gateway
interconnected by a feeder link, the UE accessing NTN network services through
the NTN payload via a service link.
Figure 1: Overall illustration of an NTN
Three types of service links are supported:
\- Earth-fixed: provisioned by beam(s) continuously covering the same
geographical areas all the time (e.g., the case of GSO satellites);
\- Quasi-Earth-fixed: provisioned by beam(s) covering one geographic area for
a limited period of time and a different geographic area during another period
of time (e.g., the case of NGSO satellites generating steerable beams);
\- Earth-moving: provisioned by beam(s) whose coverage area slides over the
Earth surface (e.g., the case of NGSO satellites generating fixed or non-
steerable beams).
With NGSO satellites, the eNB can provide either quasi-Earth-fixed cell
coverage or Earth-moving cell coverage, while eNB operating with GSO
satellites can provide Earth fixed cell coverage or quasi-Earth-fixed cell
coverage.
Support for BL UEs, UEs in enhanced coverage and NB-IoT UEs over NTN is only
applicable to E-UTRA connected to EPC.
Only BL UEs, UEs in enhanced coverage and NB-IoT UEs with GNSS capability are
supported.
**[Timing and Synchronization:]{.underline}**
The network broadcasts ephemeris information and common Timing Advance (common
TA) parameters in each NTN cell. A UE shall acquire its GNSS position as well
as the satellite ephemeris and common TA before connecting to an NTN cell. To
achieve uplink synchronisation, before performing random access, the UE shall
autonomously pre-compensate the Timing Advance, as well as the frequency
doppler shift by considering the common TA, the UE position and the satellite
position through the satellite ephemeris. In connected mode, the UE shall
continuously update the Timing Advance and frequency pre-compensation, but the
UE is not expected to perform GNSS acquisition. The UE does not perform any
transmissions due to outdated satellite ephemeris, common TA or GNSS position
based on timers. In connected mode, upon outdated satellite ephemeris and
common Timing Advance, the UE re-acquires the broadcasted parameters and upon
outdated GNSS position the UE moves to idle mode. The UEs may be configured to
report Timing Advance at initial access or in connected mode. In connected
mode triggered reporting of the Timing Advance is supported.
For downlink synchronization in case of NB-IoT, the two LSB of the ARFCN is
signalled in MIB for bands for which a 200 kHz channel raster is not
supported, and the legacy 100 kHz raster is used. Otherwise, for bands for
which a 200 kHz channel raster is supported, there is no signalling of ARFCN
information in MIB.
Downlink and uplink timings are frame aligned at the uplink time
synchronization reference point (RP). To accommodate the long propagation
delays in NTN, the timing relationships are enhanced by the support of two
scheduling offsets: and as illustrated in Figure 2:
Figure 2: Timing relationship parameters
Uplink segmented transmission is supported for uplink transmission with
repetitions. The UE shall apply UE pre-compensation per segment of UL
transmission of PUSCH/PUCCH/PRACH for BL UEs and UEs in enhanced coverage and
NPUSCH/NPRACH for NB-IoT from one segment to the next segment. The
configuration of uplink transmission segment is indicated on SIB for initial
access and can be re-configured by RRC signalling.
**[Discontinuous coverage and assistance information:]{.underline}**
As a satellite moves on a specified orbit, for example in case of a NGSO
satellite, the satellite beam(s) coverage area may move and cover different
portions of a geographical area due to the orbital movement of the satellite.
As a consequence, a UE located in the concerned geographical area may
experience a situation of discontinuous coverage, due to e.g., a sparse
satellite constellation deployment.
The network may broadcast assistance information relating to the serving
satellite and other satellites of the constellation to enable UEs to predict
upcoming satellites fly-over periods and save power during periods of no
coverage. The broadcast assistance information includes SGP4 ephemeris
elements based on the TLE (Two-Line Elements) sets industry standard.
Additional assistance information, such as coverage footprint parameters and
cell radius, may also be optionally broadcast by the network.
Predicting out of coverage and in coverage periods is up to UE implementation.
When out of coverage, the UE is not required to perform Access Stratum (AS)
functions.
In the Core Network, discontinuous coverage is handled by means of Tracking
Area- or RAT-specific configuration of the MME such that the MME is able, via
existing functionality (namely periodic TAU timer, mobile reachable timer,
implicit detach timer and high latency communication), to ensure that when the
UE is unreachable, a) the UE does not trigger NAS transaction or detach from
the network and b) mobile-terminated data destined to the UE can be stored in
the network.
**[Mobility Management:]{.underline}**
The network may broadcast more than one Tracking Area Code (TAC) per PLMN in a
cell in order to reduce the signalling load at cell edge in NTN, in particular
for Earth-moving cell coverage. The AS layer indicates all received TACs for
the selected PLMN to the NAS layer. The network may update the UEs upon TAC
removal. UEs may by UE implementation also check whether a TAC has been
removed from the TACs broadcast by the network.
At the NAS layer, the UE need not trigger a Tracking Area Update due to
mobility reason, if any of the broadcast TAC(s) in the cell where the UE is
located is part of the UE's Tracking Area List.
For quasi-Earth-fixed cells, timing information on when the cell is going to
stop serving the area may be broadcast by the network. This may be used by the
UE to start measurements on neighbour cells before the broadcast stop time of
the serving cell, while the exact start of the measurements is up to UE
implementation.
Radio link failure and RRC connection re-establishment are supported in NTN.
To enable mobility in NTN, the network provides target cell satellite
parameters needed to access the NTN cell in the handover command. Conditional
handover is supported for BL UEs and UEs in enhanced coverage.
Different RAT types are introduced that allow distinction by the Core Network
between existing terrestrial accesses and new non-terrestrial accesses as well
as, among non-terrestrial accesses, between the different types of satellite
constellations (LEO, MEO, GEO, OTHERSAT) and radio access type (i.e. WB-
EUTRAN, NB-IoT and LTE-M). This allows the Core Network nodes and the HSS to
identify the access a UE is using such that they are able to adjust their
behavior and that of the UE accordingly (e.g. setting of NAS timers,
determination and enforcement of access restrictions, etc.).
**[Feeder-link switch-over:]{.underline}**
The NTN Control function determines the point in time when a feeder link
switch over between two eNBs is performed. For BL UEs and UEs in enhanced
coverage, the transfer of the affected UE(s)\' context between the two eNBs at
feeder link switch over is performed by means of either S1 based or X2 based
handover, and it depends on the eNBs\' implementation and configuration
information provided to the eNBs by the NTN Control function.
**[Network-interfaces signalling aspects:]{.underline}**
The Cell Identity in NTN corresponds to a fixed geographical area identified
by a Mapped Cell ID, irrespective of the orbit of the NTN payload or of the
type of the service link. For a BL UE or a UE in enhanced coverage, the Cell
Identity included within the target identification of the handover messages
allows identifying the correct target cell. The mapping between Mapped Cell
IDs and geographical areas is configured in the RAN and the Core Network (e.g.
pre-configured depending on operator\'s policy, or based on implementation).
For a BL UE or a UE in enhanced coverage or a NB-IoT UE that supports S1-U
data transfer or User Plane CIoT EPS optimisation, the eNB is responsible for
constructing the Mapped Cell ID based on the UE location information received
from the UE, if available. The User Location Information may enable the MME to
determine whether the UE is allowed to operate at its present location. Pre-
configuration of special mapped cell identifiers may be used to indicate areas
outside the serving PLMN\'s country.
The eNB reports the broadcasted TAC(s) of the selected PLMN to the MME. In
case the eNB knows the UE\'s location information, the eNB may determine the
TAI the UE is currently located in and provide that TAI to the MME.
**[MME(Re-)Selection by eNB:]{.underline}**
For an RRC_CONNECTED UE, when the eNB is configured to ensure that the BL UE
or the UE in enhanced coverage is using an MME that serves the country in
which the UE is located. If the eNB detects that a BL UE or a UE in enhanced
coverage is in a different country from that served by the serving MME, it
should perform an S1 handover to change to an appropriate MME or initiate a UE
Context Release Request procedure towards the serving MME (in which case the
MME may decide to detach the UE).
For an RRC_CONNECTED NB-IoT UE, when the eNB is configured to ensure that the
NB-IoT UE is using an MME that serves the country in which the UE is located.
If the eNB detects that the UE is in a different country to that served by the
serving MME, it should initiate a UE Context Release Request procedure towards
the serving MME (in which case the MME may decide to detach the UE).
**[Verification of UE location:]{.underline}**
The network may, according to regulatory requirements, need to enforce that
the PLMN selected by the UE is allowed to operate in the geographical location
where the UE is located. To this end, the MME may invoke the ULI (User
Location Information) procedure during Mobility Management and Session
Management procedures in order to determine the UE location. If the MME is
able to determine with sufficient accuracy that it is not allowed to operate
in the UE location it may reject and/or detach the UE.
**[O &M Requirements:]{.underline}**
The NTN related parameters shall be provided by O&M to the eNB providing non-
terrestrial access, as specified in TS 38.300 for NR NTN.
**[Support for E-UTRAN:]{.underline}**
For S1 and X2 interfaces, codepoints in the RAT Restriction Information IE (in
the Handover Restriction List) allow the selection of different constellation
types, i.e., \"LEO\", \"MEO\", \"GEO\", \"OTHERSAT\" for satellite access.
For S1 interface, additional codepoints are added to the RAT Type IE
associated with a TAC, i.e., \"NBIoT-LEO\", \"NBIoT-MEO\", \"NBIoT-GEO\",
\"NBIoT-OTHERSAT\", \"EUTRAN-LEO\", \"EUTRAN-MEO\", \"EUTRAN-GEO\", \"EUTRAN-
OTHERSAT\".
For S1 interface, the UE Context Reference at Source IE (eNB UE S1AP ID) is
introduced in the Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container.
For S1 interface, a new cause value is added signalling that a UE is not
within the serving area of its current PLMN.
For TAC reporting over S1, the LTE NTN TAI Information IE and the semantics
description for the TAI IE are added in the User Location Information IE; the
LTE NTN TAI Information IE and the semantics description for the TAI IE are
added to the eNB CP RELOCATION INDICATION, HANDOVER NOTIFY, PATH SWITCH
REQUEST, INITIAL UE MESSAGE, UPLINK NAS TRANSPORT, and LOCATION REPORT
messages.
**[Other NAS protocol Aspects:]{.underline}**
Enhancements to NAS signalling allow the UE to register to EPS core network
using satellite E-UTRAN radio access technology. UICC-ME interface is extended
to support network selection over satellite access and allowing to prioritize
networks offering satellite access. EPS NAS re-transmission timers are
extended to support longer propagation delays and response times due to
extended distance between peer entities when satellite access is used. The UE
supporting satellite E-UTRAN access supports also GNSS and potential uplink
signalling delays to be considered in UE and network NAS implementations.

# 6 Services to \"verticals\"
## 6.1 Introduction
A key segment of the Rel-17 improvements of the 5G System (5GS) refers to the
services provided by 5GS to segments of the industry other than
telecommunications, e.g. factory automation, agriculture, electricity
distribution, etc. These segments are referred to as \"verticals\", as
explained in TR 21.915 [1].
The boundary of \"verticals\" is unclear, in the sense that whether a Feature
can be classified as offered to verticals or not can be arguable \-- besides,
a Feature can be usable both for verticals and for the wide audience.

eCAV S1 SP-191043 Bahr, Michael, Siemens AG
Summary based on the input provided by Siemens in SP-220458.
Cyber-physical control applications in vertical domains (CAV) was introduced
in Rel-16 [2]. As a reminder, \"cyber-physical control applications\" refers
to applications that control physical processes over a network, using
algorithms. Communication for cyber-physical control applications supports
operation in various vertical domains, for instance industrial automation,
Smart Grid. CAV requires very high levels of communication service
availability and some of them also require a very low end-to-end latency as
well as real-time capabilities.
Rel-17's enhancements for CAV (eCAV) refines the service requirements for CAV
and specifies new service requirements for specific aspects (Stage 1):
additional service performance requirements (KPIs, influencing parameters)
have been provided for enhanced and new use cases of cyber-physical control
applications: control-to-control communication, wired-to-wireless link
replacement (100 Mbit/s, 1 Gbit/s), cooperative carrying, mobile operation
panels, and industrial wireless sensors.
eCAV addresses further and enhanced service requirements for industrial
Ethernet integration, which includes time synchronization, clock
synchronization performance requirements, different time domains, integration
scenarios, and support for time-sensitive networking (TSN).
An essential requirement specifies: \"The 5G system shall support clock
synchronization (e.g. IEEE 802.1AS) through the 5G network if the sync master
and the sync devices are served by different UEs\". See Figure 1. The flow of
clock synchronization messages is in either direction, UL and DL, and can
contain two wireless links on its path. {width="6.695138888888889in"
height="2.497916666666667in"}
Figure 1: 5G network on path of synchronization messages with two wireless
links (both, UL and DL) [1]
Service requirements on direct device communication (ProSe communication) for
cyber-physical control applications are provided (general, network
performance, clock synchronization, service continuity, aspects of indirect
communication), many of them supporting the use case of cooperative carrying.
Furthermore, high-level requirements for enhancements in network operation and
maintenance in 5G non-public networks for cyber-physical control applications
in vertical domains and enhancements and clarifications for positioning have
been provided.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in CP-220394.
The 3GPP Northbound Interfaces and APIs are specified as to enable external
entities and third party Application Servers/Functions to access a set of
exposed 3GPP network services and capabilities in a secure and controlled
manner. The 3GPP application layer APIs are defined by 3GPP as to allow the
support of various applications/services (e.g. V2X, UAS, EDGE, etc.) over 3GPP
networks and to ensure the efficient use and deployment of these
applications/services over 3GPP systems via an optimized application layer
framework. 3GPP northbound interfaces/APIs as well as application layer APIs
are used and supported by various external entities including third party
Application Servers/Functions.
This work relates to the introduction of pure stage 3 (i.e. there are no
related stage 1 nor stage 2 requirements) technical improvements and
enhancements, i.e. improvement of the overall efficiency, reliability and
flexibility, enhancement of the signalling efficiency, consolidation of the
common protocol aspects, alignment with the 5GC service based principles and
guidelines when relevant, corrections/changes missed in the previous 3GPP
Releases, etc., especially that such enhancements may not be covered by the
other more dedicated and functionality-driven work items.

Summary based on the input provided by Intel in RP-220919.
This Work Item specifies solutions for NR Positioning enhancements, including
improvement of positioning accuracy and latency of Rel-16 NR positioning
methods, improvements of network efficiency (On-Demand PRS transmission),
improvement of device efficiency (positioning in RRC_INACTIVE), providing high
integrity and reliability requirements (GNSS integrity) and enhancements of
A-GNSS positioning (BDS B2a,/B3I and NavIC to NR).
All these aspects are detailed below.
**_[Improvement of positioning accuracy]{.underline}_**
To improve positioning accuracy, several solutions were considered:
[Mitigation of gNB/UE Tx/Rx timing delay errors:]{.underline} For mitigation
of gNB/UE Tx/Rx timing delay errors, multiple enhancements are introduced in
Rel-17:
â€¢ For DL-TDOA, a UE can be requested to provide the Rx TEG IDs together with
RSTD measurements and a TRP can be requested to provide TRP Tx TEG association
information of DL PRS resources to mitigate UE Rx timing errors and TRP Tx
timing errors. A UE can also be requested to measure the same DL PRS resource
of a TRP with different UE Rx TEGs and report the corresponding multiple RSTD
measurements to mitigate UE Rx timing errors.
â€¢ For UL-TDOA, Rel-17 supports a TRP to provide the Rx TEG IDs together with
RTOA measurements and a UE to provide UE Tx TEG association information of UL
positioning SRS resources to mitigate TRP Rx timing errors and UE Tx timing
errors. A TRP can also be requested to measure the same UL SRS resource of a
UE with different TRP Rx TEGs and report the corresponding multiple RTOA
measurements to mitigate TRP Rx timing errors.
â€¢ Multi-RTT, Rel-17 supports a UE/TRP to provide the RxTx TEG IDs, or
combination of {Rx TEG ID, Tx TEG ID} together with UE/gNB Rx-Tx time
difference measurements and a UE/gNB to provide its Tx TEG association
information for mitigating UE/TRP Rx/Tx timing errors;
In addition, Rel-17 supports a UE to report more than one measurement instance
of RSTD, DL RSRP, and/or UE Rx-Tx time difference measurements in a single
measurement report, and support a TRP to report more than one measurement
instance of RTOA, UL RSRP, and/or gNB Rx-Tx time difference measurements in a
single measurement report. Each measurement instance is reported with its own
timestamp;
[UL-AOA enhancements:]{.underline} The new assistance information (expected
UL-AOA value and uncertainty range) can be provided by the LMF to facilitate
gNB measurements for NR UL-AOA, UL-TDOA and Multi-RTT positioning methods.
Support of the first arrival path UL-AOA/ZOA measurement pair per SRS resource
were introduced, including reporting of multiple per path AOA value pairs
(including additional paths) to cope with possible ambiguity of angle
measurements in antenna arrays with larger spacing than a half wavelength, and
reporting ZoA only to cope with angle measurements in linear antenna arrays.
The per path UL SRS receive reference signal power (UL SRS-RSRPP) measurement
definition was introduced.
The antenna reference point (ARP) location can be associated with UL
measurements for NR Positioning (UL AOA, UL-RTOA, UL SRS-RSRP, UL SRS-RSRPP
and gNB Rx-Tx time difference measurements).
Finally, to facilitate hybrid RAT dependent positioning, gNB can report to LMF
the following set of measurements {one SRS-RSRP, multiple UL-AOAs (AOA/ZoA
pairs), one UL-RTOA or one-gNB Rx-Tx time difference}.
[DL-AOD enhancements:]{.underline} The enhancements of assistance data (a
subset of PRS resources for each PRS resource for the purpose of
prioritization of DL-AOD reporting or the boresight direction information for
each PRS resource) were defined to improve DL-AOD estimation. In addition, the
assistance information on DL-AOD/DL-AOA expected value and uncertainty range
can be provided by LMF to UE. In Rel-17, for more accurate DL-AOD
measurements, the gNB can provide the beam/antenna information to LMF (and LMF
can further share it to UE for UE-based positioning). The per path DL PRS
reference signal received power (DL PRS RSRPP) for the first path measurements
were defined for DL-AOD estimation, and the maximum number of DL PRS RSRPP for
the first path measurements was 24. Finally, the maximum number of DL PRS RSRP
measurements per TRP was increased up to 24 compared to 8 in Rel.16.
[Multi-path and NLOS mitigation:]{.underline} In Rel-17, multi-path
(additional path) report enhancements and LOS/NLOS indication were introduced
for NR positioning solutions. The maximum number of additional paths that can
be reported is increased (up to 8) with per path RSRP measurements and
associated relative timing supported. Multiple UL-AOAs (up to 8) per
additional path reporting is supported for the UL-TDOA and Multi-RTT
positioning methods. The LOS/NLOS indicator was introduced that can be
associated with specific measurements, DL/UL reference signals / resources for
positioning.
**_[Improvement of positioning latency]{.underline}_**
To improve the positioning latency, following solutions were considered:
[Preconfigured measurement gap:]{.underline} To reduce latency of procedures
for DL PRS processing with measurement gaps, the set of measurement gap
patterns can be pre-configured to UE and activated/deactivated by gNB using
new DL MAC CE signalling designed to control DL PRS measurement by UE. The UE
can request activation and deactivation of the pre-configured MG using new UL
MAC CE signalling introduced in Rel-17. The LMF can request activation of pre-
configured MG using new NRPPa signalling introduced in Rel-17.
[Preconfigured PRS processing window:]{.underline} To further reduce latency
of DL PRS processing, UEs can perform DL PRS measurement outside measurement
gaps and inside the active DL BWP with PRS having the same numerology as the
active DL BWP. The gNB can use RRC signalling to pre-configure PRS processing
window and DL MAC CE signalling for activation of PRS processing window,
respectively. gNB can indicate the DL PRS processing priority relative to
other DL signals/channels within the PRS processing window for PRS measurement
outside MG.
[M-sample measurement (M = 1):]{.underline} In Rel-17, LMF can request UE
and/or TRP to perform measurement over either a single RS transmission period
(M=1) or four RS transmission periods (M=4). Configuring M=1 for a UE reduces
UE measurement period comparing to Rel.16 (In Rel-16, UE is expected to
measure DL PRS over four periods (M = 4)). An AGC sample, in addition to the
M=1 sample may be required at the UE subject to measurement conditions.
[Lower Rx beam sweeping factor:]{.underline} In Rel-17, a new UE capability on
lower Rx beam sweeping factor (\ Bound for longer than TTA \| NOT DNU) \ 1\. The MCPTT service requirements are specified in TS 22.179 and TS 22.280;

Summary based on the input provided by Motorola Solutions in SP-220019.
Mission critical (MC) services security enhancements phase 2 defines the
confidentiality, integrity, user authentication, service authorization, and
overall security architecture for Release 17 mission critical services (MCPTT,
MCVideo, MCData, MC Location, MC Interworking, MC Interconnection, and MC
Railway).
Release 17 expands on the mission critical security architecture already
defined in previous releases and includes some mission critical security
clarifications and corrections.
In this release, mission critical user service authorization and security for
the mission critical MCData message store service. Similar to user service
authorization for the other MC services, an appropriately scoped access token
obtained from the Identity Management server permits only authorized users the
authorization to access and use the MCData message store service.
Security for Preconfigured Group Regroup and Preconfigured User Regroup calls
defines the use of the preconfigured group to establish the security context.
Enhancements to the security architecture to support mission critical security
services over a 5G system. This includes the mission critical security
architecture, which describes the use and integration of 5G nodes and servers.

Summary based on the input provided by UIC.
MCOver5GS (Mission Critical service over 5GS) aims to enable 5GS for the use
by Mission Critical Services supporting on-network as well as off network
Mission Critical communication. In a first phase (Rel-17) unicast transmission
service are now available for the on-network approach. In consecutive phases
multicast/broadcast services and off network are in focus. In the area of off-
network communication, the main aim is to align transmission services using
5GS capabilities. Another important aspect is to provide interoperability when
Mission Critical Services are supported by both, the EPS and 5GS.
MCover5GC adapts the general Mission Critical Communication functional model
so it is applicable when using 5GS. Rel-17 enables the use of unicast based
transmission mode for Mission Critical services and the proper use of 5GS
Quality of Service categories. Relevant procedures were adapted to be
applicable under 5GS conditions.
With use of 5GS, Mission Critical services are now also be used taking the
untrusted approach into account so that MC service servers can be operated
geographically independently from the IMS/SIP core infrastructure.
MC services can be deployed using different infrastructures, public or non-
public. With 5GS, MC services and their traffic can be operated in isolation
from others using network slicing. Transport resources are thus virtualized
and can be used for MC service, considering predefined bit rates. In this
context a minimum amount of bandwidth can also be guaranteed for handling
Mission Critical services, e.g. when using public networks.

Summary based on the input provided by FirstNet in CP-220110.
eMCCI_CT refers to stage 3 aspects of the stage 2 work defined by eMCCI in
Rel-16.
Note: This does not comply with the 3GPP methodology: all stages of a Feature
shall be defined within a same Release and use the same Feature/acronym. An
exception was granted, and this Feature is then \"split\" between Rel-16
(Stage 2 aspects) and Rel-17 (Stage 3 aspects).
It covers enhancements to interworking 3GPP mission critical systems with Land
Mobile Radio (LMR, i.e. public safety communication networks) systems in
Rel-17 to provide support for a conference event package, affiliation on
behalf of a set of users, and private call floor control.
The Rel-17 IWF (interworking function) now supports the ability for the IWF to
handle subscriptions to events that may occur in the LMR system, and for the
IWF to be able to subscribe on behalf of LMR users to events in the 3GPP
mission critical system (MCPTT and MCData).
Affiliation on behalf of a set of users is now handled from the IWF toward the
3GPP mission critical system to potentially reduce the signalling load due to
repetitive messaging.
Private call floor control is now supported between an MCPTT system and an
IWF.

Summary based on the input provided by Motorola Solutions in SP-220683.
MCSMI_CT refers to stage 3 aspects of the stage 2 work defined by MCSMI in
Rel-16.
Note: This does not comply with the 3GPP methodology: all stages of a Feature
shall be defined within a same Release and use the same Feature/acronym. An
exception was granted, and this Feature is then \"split\" between Rel-16
(Stage 2 aspects) and Rel-17 (Stage 3 aspects).
For Release 17, the enhancements to the MC service specifications (MCPTT,
MCVideo, and MCData) to support Mission Critical system interconnection were
contained in the work items: MCSMI_CT for stage 3 (CT1), and the earlier work
items MCSMI (SA6) and eMCSMI (SA6) for stage 2\. The latest revised WID for
MCSMI_CT in CP 220301 focused only on MC system interconnection. The stage 3
migration aspects for MC systems will be considered in a future release. The
corresponding items which have been completed in Release 17 are described in
the following clause.
Interconnection between mission critical systems is needed to provide inter-
system communication for purposes such as operational support and mutual aid
between mission critical systems in different security domains, operated by
different mission critical organizations. All of the call types that are
available within a single MC system may also be needed when communications
between a primary and partner system involves interconnection.
These enhancements for interconnection that follow impact areas of the MCPTT,
MCVideo, and MCData service architecture and protocols. The following features
have been added or enhanced to support MC system interconnection.
**Functional connectivity model and introduction of the MC gateway server:**
To allow for interconnection of MC systems in different trust domains the MC
gateway sever is introduced for each of the MC services to provide topology
hiding and an interface between security domains. An MCPTT gateway server can
act as a SIP and HTTP proxy for signalling with a partner MCPTT system in a
different trust domain. Similarly, an MCVideo gateway server and an MCData
gateway server provides the same function for the MCVideo and MCData services,
respectively.
**MCPTT service changes to support MC system interconnection:** The following
MCPTT procedures have been enhanced to support MCPTT interconnection:
affiliation, emergency alert, pre-arranged group call, chat group call, common
procedures, private call, remotely initiated group call, remote change of
selected group, group regroup, user regroup, and the corresponding MCPTT
gateway server procedures.
**MCVideo service changes to support MC system interconnection:** The
following MCVideo procedures have been enhanced to support MCVideo
interconnection: affiliation, ambient viewing, emergency alert, group call,
private call, common procedures, remote change of selected group, group
regroup, user regroup, and the corresponding MCVideo gateway server
procedures.
**MCData service changes to support MC system interconnection:** The following
MCData procedures have been enhanced to support MCData interconnection:
affiliation, disposition notifications, emergency alert, Short Data Service
procedures, File Download procedures, common procedures, IP connectivity,
group regroup, user regroup, and the corresponding MCData gateway server
procedures.
The requirements, architecture, protocol, and security aspects related to
these enhancements are described in the following specifications:

840038 **MC services support on IOPS mode of operation** MCIOPS S6 SP-190944
Camilo Solano, Ericsson
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-220320.
For Release 17, Mission Critical (MC) services support in the Isolated
Operation for Public Safety (IOPS) mode of operation defines the features
required to support MC services based on the availability of an IOPS MC
system, e.g., for the case of a backhaul failure. The stage 2 work has been
developed based on the study results captured in TR 23.778, stage 1 service
requirements defined in TS 22.346, stage 2 work related to the definition of
the IOPS mode of operation in TS 23.401, and the support of MC services
defined in TS 23.280, TS 23.379, and TS 23.282.
Those features that have been completed are described in the following clause.
NOTE: Stage 3 work was not completed at the time when this summary was
introduced in the present document (March 2022).
The functional architecture, procedures and information flows to support MC
services in the IOPS mode of operation have been specified in TS 23.180. The
addressed architecture requirements were focused on the case of a backhaul
failure between the radio access network (RAN) and the macro Evolved Packet
Core (EPC). For that, the IOPS MC system provides support for MC services in
the IOPS mode of operation until the failure is recovered.
In this release, during the IOPS mode of operation the IOPS MC system supports
the following MCPTT services: group call, emergency group call, private call
and emergency private call. For the case of MCData services, only short data
service is supported. MCVideo services are not supported in Release 17.
MC services in the IOPS mode of operation are specified based on the IP
connectivity functionality. The IP connectivity functionality enables that MC
services are provided by the MC service clients via the IOPS MC connectivity
function.
The IP connectivity functionality defines that the IOPS MC connectivity
function does not provide MC services to the MC service clients. Instead, it
enables that MC service users are discovered by the IOPS MC connectivity
function and get notified about the availability of other MC service users
within the coverage of the IOPS Evolved Packet System (EPS). The IOPS MC
connectivity function distributes then related IP traffic to discovered MC
service UEs over IP unicast transmissions and/or multicast transmissions. An
MC service UE supporting the IP connectivity functionality in the IOPS mode of
operation enables transmitting the IP packets related to an MC service
communication over the IOPS MC connectivity function.

Summary based on the input provided by CATT in SP-220899.
Multimedia Priority Service (MPS) to support priority communications by
authorized users, i.e., emergency service personnel, during times of emergency
situations and network congestion was originally specified in Release 8. In
Release 17, a stage 1 feasibility study on MPS Phase 2 identified new priority
voice, video, and data communication capabilities. Based on the results of the
MPS Phase 2 feasibility study as documented in TR 22.854 [1], the normative
stage 1 requirements in TS 22.153 [2] were updated and associated stage 2 and
stage 3 features were defined in Release 17.
**Stage 1 summary**
The following is a summary of the new stage 1 features included in TS 22.153
[2] Release 17:
1\. MPS for MMTEL voice/video
Explicit stage 1 requirements were added for MPS for MMTEL voice and MMTEL
voice conference calls for an authorized Service User using a UE with a
subscription for MPS; and new requirements for MPS for MMTEL voice and MMTEL
voice conference calls for an authorized Service User using a UE that does not
have an MPS subscription, and MPS for all participants of an authorized MMTEL
voice conference call. The corresponding extensions were also added for MPS
for MMTEL video.
2\. MPS for Data Transfer Service (DTS)
A new MPS for DTS feature was defined as a generic priority packet transport
service that applies independently of the specific data application being
used. In the case of EPS, MPS for DTS enables the prioritization of all
traffic on the default bearer upon request. It may also apply to other bearers
based on operator policy and regulatory rules. In the case of 5GS, MPS for DTS
enables the prioritization of all traffic on the QoS Flow associated with the
default QoS rule upon request. It may also apply to other QoS flows based on
operator policy and regulatory rules. MPS for DTS is a specific example of
Priority Data Bearer Service.
3\. Attestation of Authorized MPS Priority
New stage 1 requirements were added for the attestation and verification of
MPS authorization.
**Stage 2 summary**
The following is a summary of the new stage 2 features included in Release 17:
1\. MPS for MMTEL voice/video
Enhancements were included in TS 23.228 [8] based on the new stage 1
requirements for MPS for MMTEL voice and video conference calls. A
conferencing AS permits an authorized host with an MPS (IMS) priority
subscription to request an upgrade of the host itself, specific participants,
or all participants including the host in the conference, whether participants
have an MPS subscription or not.
2\. MPS for DTS
A new MPS for DTS feature was specified in TS 23.401 [3], TS 23.203 [4], TS
23.501 [5], TS 23.502 [6], and TS 23.503 [7] to support priority packet
transport service that applies independently of the specific data application
being used. MPS for DTS enables the prioritization of all traffic on the EPC
default bearer and the 5GC QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule upon
requests received via an AF. Based on additional configuration in the PCF,
prioritization may also be applied to other bearers and QoS Flows.
3\. SBI Message Priority
TS 23.501 [5] and TS 23.502 [6] were enhanced to specify that 5GC service
based messages carry a priority indication for the UE if the UE has a priority
subscription. Specifications already supported the priority indication on
service based messages via the AMF based on the receipt of an RRC connection
request with a priority establishment cause. The enhancement informs all core
network elements with service based interfaces to handle all activity from MPS
subscribers with priority.
4\. MPS support in the UE Configuration Update procedure
TS 23.502 [6] was enhanced to support MPS subscription updates in the UE
Configuration Update procedure so that a UE that receives an MPS subscription
from the network does not have to wait for any re-registration events to
obtain priority treatment.
**Stage 3 summary**
The following is a summary of the new stage 3 features and improvements
included in Release 17:
1\. MPS for MMTEL voice/video
TS 24.229 [9] was enhanced to specify that all IMS core elements (e.g., the
P-CSCF, I-CSCF, S-CSCF, MGCF, BGCF, MRFC, MRB, IBCF, ISC gateway and AS)
adjust priority treatment based upon the most recently received Resource
Priority Header field. This allows voice/video calls to be upgraded to MPS
while in progress.
2\. MPS for Data Transfer Service (DTS)
The new MPS for DTS feature was defined in support of stage 1 and stage 2
requirements for priority data, along with the associated PCC (Policy and
Charging Control) related protocol and information element requirements, for
both EPS and 5GS.
3\. Voice Call Continuity (VCC)
In TS 24.237 [10], the VCC procedure in the SCC AS was enhanced to prevent
loss of priority for MPS voice calls across mobility events.
4\. SBI Message Priority
TS 29.500 [11] was enhanced to specify that 5GC service based messages carry a
priority indication for the UE if either the UE has a priority subscription or
has established an RRC connection with priority. The enhancement informs all
core network elements on the service based interfaces that the activity is to
be handled with priority.
5\. MPS support in the UE Configuration Update procedure
TS 24.501 [12] was enhanced to support MPS subscription updates in the UE
Configuration Update procedure so that a UE that receives an MPS subscription
from the network does not have to wait for any re-registration events to
obtain priority treatment.

### 6.3.3 Drone/UAS/UAV/EAV
#### 6.3.3.1 Introduction
For several reasons, drone-related aspects have been using different names:
during the course of Rel-17, \"unmanned\" was changed to \"uncrewed\". Also,
some groups have been using \"Vehicle\" \"UAV\") while other have been using
\"Systems\" (\"UAS\").
This section refers to drone being supported as a vertical by the 5GS. It does
not cover the case of drones being used _within_ the system, e.g. to provide

Summary based on the input provided by China Unicom in SP-220664.
This work item expands the scope of 3GPP system to support various enhanced
UAV scenarios, especially for a wide range of applications and scenarios by
using low altitude UAVs in various commercial and government sectors.
New service level requirements and KPIs for supporting various UAV
applications by the 3GPP system have been identified and specified. Some new
requirements are closely related to relevant work item 810049 in stage 1, such
as C2 communication and related KPIs.
The main work of EAV item is based on the outcome of the study items resulting
in TR 22.829 [1]. The General requirements needed for the 5G system to support
UAV aspects are introduced in chapter 6.32 in TS 22.261[2], which points to
the main normative work of TS 22.125 [3], where the following service
requirements and KPIs are addressed:
Point1: Requirements for UAV usages: Network exposure for UAV services;
Service restriction for UEs onboard of UAV; Requirements for UxNB; C2
communication
Point2: Performance requirements: KPIs for services provided to the UAV
applications; KPIs for UAV command and control; Positioning performance
requirements; Other requirements
Stage-2/3 works related to this WI were progressed by the work item
\"Application layer support for UAS\" described in the next clause.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-220651.
This Feature specifies enabler services related to application layer support
for Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS). This feature enables efficient use and
deployment of UAS on 3GPP networks. The architecture and protocols for UAS
application layer consisting of UAS application enabler are specified
considering stage 1 and stage 2 work within 3GPP related to UAS in TS 22.125
[1] and TS 23.256 [2].
The UAS application layer utilizes Service Enabler Architecture Layer (SEAL)
functionalities. The enhancements to SEAL were specified using the eSEAL WI
(see corresponding section).
An architecture for UAS application layer over 3GPP system is introduced as
shown in figure x.
{width="6.5465277777777775in" height="2.7069444444444444in"}
Figure 1: UAS application layer over 3GPP system
A UAS UE can be a UAV controller (UAV-C) or a UAV. In the UAS application
specific layer, a UAS application server can be a USS/UTM server or any
Application server interacting with UAS application clients. The UAS specific
applications include C2 communications, multimedia applications, etc. and
hence the details of the UAS application specific layer is out of scope of
3GPP. To support the UAS application specific layer, a UAS application support
layer is specified which includes the UAS application enabler (UAE) layer and
the Service Enabler Architecture Layer (SEAL). The architecture only supports
Uu connectivity in this release. The UAE server exposes service APIs which can
be consumed by UAS application servers and conforms to the CAPIF framework.
The functional model for UAS application layer over 3GPP system including the
UAS application enabler layer functionalities are specified in TS 23.255 [3].
The UAE layer includes UE side function called UAE client and network side
function called UAE server and provides the following services to support the
UAS application specific layer:
> a) Registration enables authentication and authorization of UAS UEs at UAE
> layer.
>
> b) Communications between UAVs within a geographical area where a UAV can
> send UAV application messages to other UAVs in an application defined
> proximity range from the UAV (sender).
>
> c) Group based pairing of UAV-C and UAV enables pairing management (e.g pair
> creation, pair modification) using SEAL group management service.
>
> d) C2 QoS provisioning for UAS utilizes SEAL network resource management
> service to enable QoS based C2 communications.
>
> e) C2 communication mode selection and switching to enable switching between
> different C2 modes like Network-Assisted C2 communication, Direct C2
> communication and UTM navigated C2 communications.
>
> f) Real-time UAV connection status monitoring and location reporting enables
> UAS application servers like USS/UTM to monitor the real-time situation of
> the UAV.
HTTP protocol is used to enable the above functionalities and the related
protocol aspects are specified in TS 24.257 [4].
The openAPI specifications for the UAE server services (northbound APIs)
exposed to UAS application specific servers over Us reference point are
specified in TS 29.257 [5].
The feasibility study for UAS application support aspects are specified in TR
23.755 [6].

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in SP-220619.
The work on Remote Identification of Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) includes a
set of 5GS enhancements aiming at supporting aviation industry needs for
remote identification, tracking and authorization of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicles
(UAVs) operating via the 3GPP system. Besides stage-1/2 requirements and
principles, main stage-3 enhancements relate to Core Network and NAS.
High-level service requirements for remote UAS identification are described in
[1].
Key functions of the 3GPP architecture for UAS are depicted in the following
figure (where the UE is assumed to be part, or on board, of a UAV):
Figure 1: High-level System architecture for UAS
The main architectural and protocol functionalities, added to the stage-2&3
specifications, include the following ([2] - [10]):
[UAV remote identification:]{.underline}
The CAA (Civil Aviation Administration)-Level UAV ID is introduced in the 3GPP
system, which allows any entity receiving the identity (e.g. with means
outside the scope of 3GPP) to address the correct USS for retrieval of UAV
information. It can be assigned by the USS with assistance from 3GPP system,
e.g., whereby the USS delegates the role of \"resolver\" of the CAA-Level UAV
ID to the UAS NF (Network Function withing the 3GPP CN).
It is assumed that, during initial UAV\'s owner registration of the UAV with
the USS (out of 3GPP scope), the CAA-level UAV ID is provided to the UAV and
the aviation-level information (e.g. UAV serial number, pilot information, UAS
operator, etc.) is provided to the USS.
[UAV USS authentication and authorization (UUAA):]{.underline}
After a successful 3GPP authentication of the UE (using existing procedures
for 3GPP primary authentication, e.g., with MNO credentials stored in the
USIM), a specific/new UUAA procedure is defined, to enable the 3GPP Core
Network to verify that the UAV has successfully registered with the USS. The
procedure pivots on the CAA-Level UAV ID that is used by the UAV to identify
itself with the USS and be authenticated by the USS. In 5GS, this procedure
can take place during the 3GPP registration, or during the establishment of a
PDU session for UAS services; In EPS, the UUAA procedure takes place during
PDN connection establishment. As part of UUAA, a generic container (Service-
level-AA container) and a generic SM procedure for
authentication/authorization purpose (Service-level-AA procedure) are defined,
to exchange the UUAA authentication information between the UE and the USS; in
addition, an API based authentication/authorization procedure is also
specified. The details of the security material used for the UUAA are outside
the scope of 3GPP and considered application layer.
[C2 (Command and Control) communication authorization:]{.underline}
For C2 communication over cellular connectivity, consisting of a UAV user
plane connection with the UAVC, authorization by the USS is required to enable
such traffic, including authorization for pairing of the UAV with a UAVC, as
well as optional flight authorization for the UAV (performed by the USS). To
support this, NAS PDU session establishment and modification procedures have
been extended, to enable inclusion of the CAA-level UAV ID and other
application layer authorization information in the Service-level-AA container.
[UAV location reporting and tracking]{.underline}
UAV location reporting and tracking is specified by mostly re-using the
existing location procedures. Different UAV tracking modes have been defined,
e.g. where the USS can be notified of the location of a UAV, a UAV moving
in/out of a given geographic area, or a list of UAVs in given geographic area.

**Stage 1 of CMED** CMED S1 SP-190306 Lagrange, Mathieu, b\<>com
Summary based on the input provided by b\<>com in SP-220652.
This WI aims at defining 5G communication services requirements for critical
medical applications, e.g. medical applications targeting the delivery of
serious care to patients, such as:
\- Image Assisted Surgery inside hybrid operating rooms equipped with high
quality and augmented imaging systems
\- Robotic Aided Surgery inside hybrid operating rooms or in remote medical
facilities
\- Tele-diagnosis and patient vital-signal monitoring in ambulances,
hospitals, or remote healthcare facilities
The generated requirements cover network dependability, performances, medical
data confidentiality and integrity, network auditability (to demonstrate to
regulators that patient safety and privacy is maintained), and more generally
specific 5G functionalities.
During the work, it has been detected that due to the very specific nature of
the targeted vertical, several performance requirements look out of reach for
current technology. For example, surgeons pay a lot of attention to video
quality (very high resolution, frame rates, ...) and repeatedly ask for non-
compressed video streams to avoid artifacts and to lower application latencies
during non-invasive surgery. This led to very stringent data rate requirements
(several dozen or higher Gbps in some identified use cases).
Interestingly, it has been noted that some of the requirements covered as part
of CMED are similar to those generated by VIAPA (video, imaging, and audio for
professional applications) and this has led to a joint specification for the
two work items. For VIAPA, see section \"Enhanced support of Non-Public
Networks\".
Beside SA1, no specific stage 2 nor stage 3 work could be carried out in 3GPP
downstream groups as key performance requirements (bitrate, latency, ...) were
felt too stringent for current technology generation.

Summary based on the input provided by BBC in xP-22xxxx.
AVPROD looks at applications for Programme Making and Special Events (PMSE)
and use cases for media production.
It looks specifically at PMSE use cases and VIAPA (Video Imaging and Audio for
Professional Applications expands this to include areas such as medical and
gaming.
The documents introduce requirements related to professional video, imaging
and audio services. Unlike other consumer multimedia applications envisioned
for 3GPP systems, the applications in which this document focuses have more
demanding performance targets and includes user devices that are managed in
different workflows when compared to typical UEs.
This can be divided into two main categories: contribution and production.
â€¢ Contribution links are heavily compressed and have lower latency
requirements and are used for newsgathering and other programme items. They
are currently serviced by satellite or bonded cellular and use the PLMNs
â€¢ Production links have higher bandwidth, due to less compression, and
challenging latency requirements as well as strict Quality of Service metrics
to ensure reliability.
The key parameters for these applications are:
**System latency**. In video production, overall system latency is referred to
as imaging system latency and has an impact on the timing of synchronized
cameras. For audio applications, overall system latency is referred to as
mouth to ear latency and it is critical to maintain lip sync and avoid a
performer to be put off by hearing their own echo. Finally, in medical
applications the system latency impairs the achievable precision at a given
gesture speed as it translates the time needed to traverse the whole imaging
system into a geometrical error of the instruments position.
**Bandwidth**. Video and imaging applications have extremely high uplink
bandwidth requirements and while compression may be used to mitigate this in
certain user cases it often degrades the picture to the extent onward
processing required by some applications is compromised. For Video Production
certain standards have been determined which indicate the maximum allowable
compression for a given type of production. In medical imaging, compression
may introduce artefacts which can impact on diagnosis of critical illness and
may also introduce additional delays which, in image assisted surgery,
translate into misalignment between perceived instruments position on screen
and their real position into patients' body.
**Quality of Service**. For Video Production certain standards have been
determined which indicate the maximum allowable compression for a given type
of production. In medical imaging, compression may introduce artefacts which
can impact on diagnosis of critical illness and may also introduce additional
delays which, in image assisted surgery, translate into misalignment between
perceived instruments position on screen and their real position into
patients' body.
**VIAPA** also highlights service aspects for Non-Public networks, clock
synchronization, Network exposure, service continuity and multi-network
connectivity.
Performance requirements are defined for all applications.
There are no specific Stage 2/3 works needed after the Stage 1 requirements,
but work has continued in SA4 with the study item on NPNs for media
production.
**[SA4 part: Study on Media Production over 5G NPN]{.underline}**
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-220650.
The media production industry uses its own set of codecs, protocols and
procedures for IP-based media production. These protocols are (often)
targeting dedicated networks installed at a production facility or at a
temporary location, which allow transmission of either uncompressed or
compressed video at high quality. For the orchestration and configuration of
an IP-based media production setup, different solutions are defined.
There are cases for which the Media Producer may own their own 5G Network.
There are other cases for which the media producer collaborates with a 5G
Network operator to support media production events and services. Different
collaboration scenarios require different means to establish 5G-based media
production connectivity.
In deployments, 5G Systems including NPNs may have to be tailored to the needs
of each industry vertical and the target use-case in question. The Media
Production vertical may want to use the 5G System for different purposes,
primarily for sending video and audio from remote locations to a central
production studio, but also for return video, tally, talkback, remote device
control (connectivity configuration, but also operational control of
specialist UE). One aim of the study would be to identify how (in technical
terms) media production can beneficially use 5G systems for media production.
TR 26.805 [4] documents the findings of the Study on Media Production over 5G
NPNs. The document contains an elaborative description on different protocols
and workflows used in media production at the time of writing. Several
different standardization and industry fora are defining Ethernet- and IP-
based protocols for media production purposes.
While the study has not identified an urgent technical area for
standardisation at this point in time, a number of practical guidelines for
implementers are identified and documented in the Technical Report. Those are
intended to support media production device manufactures and media producers
to leverage different 3GPP features for their purposes.
These guidelines may be further promoted and expanded, and more specific
aspects are likely worthwhile to be defined. Communication with external
organizations such as 5G-MAG is recommended in order to identify if they would
follow up on those guidelines to support media production device manufactures
and media producers to leverage different 3GPP features for their purposes.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in SP-220587.
5G multicast and broadcast service specifies architectural enhancements to the
5G system using NR to support multicast and broadcast communication services;
encompasses support for functions such as how to deliver multicast and
broadcast communications including support within certain location areas,
mobility, MBS session management and QoS; and covers interworking with E-UTRAN
and EPC based eMBMS for Public Safety (e.g. MCX services).
The WI is linked to the RAN WI on NR Multicast and Broadcast Services [2].
As documented in TS 23.247 [3], the following features for 5G multicast and
broadcast service are specified:
\- **Architectural enhancement**. MBS Architecture defined in TS 23.247 [3]
follows the 5G System architectural principles, enabling distribution of the
MBS data from the 5GS ingress to NG-RAN node(s) and then to the UE.
\- **QoS model** and parameters as defined in TS 23.501 [4] also apply to
multicast/broadcast communication services with several differences documented
in TS 23.247 [3]. **The policy and charging control framework** as defined in
TS 23.503 [5] applies to Multicast and Broadcast services, i.e., for MBS
Session binding, QoS Flow binding, PCC rules for MBS Session, and Policy
information.
\- **5GC Individual MBS traffic delivery** is for multicast only, and in which
5GC receives a single copy of multicast packets and delivers separate copies
of those multicast packets to individual UEs via per-UE PDU sessions, hence
for each such UE one PDU session is required to be associated with a Multicast
MBS Session. **5GC Shared MBS traffic delivery** can be used for multicast and
broadcast, and in which 5GC receives a single copy of MBS data packets and
delivers a single copy of those MBS data packets to a RAN node. See following
Figure 1 for details.
Figure 1: User plane data transmission example
\- 5GC should **authorize the AF** for delivering MBS data to the 5GC and/or
interacting with the 5GC. NEF perform authorization to the external AF for
determination of whether the interaction with the 5GC is allowed or not.
\- **Multicast communication service**. It aims at providing the same service
and same specific content data to a dedicated set of UEs. The following
characteristics for multicast are included in the WI.
> \- For Multicast MBS session, 5GC **authorizes the UE** based on the MBS
> subscription data, based on MBS subscription data of the UE, and the MBS
> session information.
>
> \- **Local multicast** service is the multicast MBS service limited in a
> certain MBS service area, and it is enforced by NG-RAN node and 5GC. A
> location dependent multicast service is an MBS service provided in several
> MBS service area(s), when UE moves to a new MBS service area, content data
> from the new MBS service area shall be delivered to the UE, and the network
> ceases to deliver the content data from the old MBS service areas to the UE.
>
> \- **Mobility support of MBS service**. UE may move from one NG-RAN node to
> another NG-RAN node after UE has joined the MB Session. To minimize the data
> loss of the UE during the handover procedure, multicast MBS session data may
> be forwarded from source NG-RAN node to target NG-RAN node.
>
> \- **Session activation and deactivation**. The MBS Session activation
> procedure is used for activating the resources for MBS data at NG-RAN node.
> The MBS Session deactivation procedure is used for deactivating the
> resources for MBS data at NG-RAN node. Resources can be efficiently used by
> a proper control of session activation/deactivation.
\- **Broadcast communication service**. It is to provide the same service and
the same specific content data are provided simultaneously to all UEs in a
geographical area. For Location dependent broadcast service, it is similar as
the one for multicast.
> \- **Inter-system mobility with interworking at service layer**. In order to
> minimize the interruption of services, upon mobility for MBS service from
> NR/5GC to E-UTRAN/EPC and vice versa, the interworking is supported at
> service layer.
\- **Security for multicast/broadcast service**. As defined in TS 33.501 [6],
control-plane procedure and user-plane procedure are optionally supported in
service layer for security protection of MBS traffic. The user plane security
between UE and RAN shall be deactivated when 5GC shared MBS traffic delivery
method for MBS data transmission is used to avoid redundant protection.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-220408.
This Rel-17 NR MBS WI specifies two delivery modes, i.e. MBS multicast and MBS
broadcast, for services of PTM (Point-To-Multipoint) nature, such as for
example public safety and mission critical services, V2X applications, IPTV,
live video, software delivery over wireless and IoT applications.
Before introducing NR MBS, there was no broadcast/multicast transmission
supported in NR for user data delivery. Services of PTM nature could only be
delivered over NR based on unicast, which is inefficient, in particular from
radio resources utilization point of view. Nevertheless, for the use cases
mentioned above, broadcast/multicast transmission provides substantial
benefits, especially in terms of system efficiency and user experience. The
MBS multicast delivery mode is capable of addressing higher QoS services while
the MBS broadcast delivery mode is focusing on lower QoS services.
The objectives of NR MBS WI are included in [2], and the WI is linked to the
SA2 WI on Architectural enhancements for 5G multicast-broadcast services [3].
**MBS Multicast:** MBS multicast provides the MBS delivery mode for
RRC_CONNECTED mode UEs, with the following characteristics:
**Group scheduling:** A common frequency resource (CFR) is defined for
multicast scheduling as an 'MBS frequency region' with a number of contiguous
PRBs, which is configured within the dedicated unicast BWP. A group of UEs can
be configured via RRC signalling with a G-RNTI for group scheduling, and the
group of UEs can also be configured with downlink SPS and G-CS-RNTI for MBS
multicast. The gNB schedules a transport block using G-RNTI (or G-CS-RNTI) to
the group of UEs.
**HARQ feedback:** HARQ feedback is used to further improve the group
scheduling efficiency, and the following two HARQ feedback reporting modes are
supported:
  * In the first HARQ feedback reporting mode, the UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-ACK information if the UE has correctly received the transport block or HARQ-NACK value if the UE has not correctly received the transport block.
  * For the second HARQ feedback reporting mode, the UE transmits a PUCCH with HARQ-NACK information only if the UE has not correctly received the transport block.
HARQ reporting for multicast can also be disabled for a UE either semi-
statically or dynamically.
Dynamic PTP (Point-To-Point)/PTM switch for MBS multicast
It is not always efficient for a gNB to schedule data based on G-RNTI (PTM),
and sometimes PTP based scheduling (same as unicast) can bring more benefits
thanks to the advanced unicast mechanisms. Based on the common PDCP entity,
the gNB can decide whether to use PTM or PTP to deliver data of an MBS
multicast session to the UE(s) at a certain time. The gNB makes its decision
based on information such as MBS Session QoS requirements, the number of
jointly scheduled UEs, UE feedback on link quality, and other criteria and
ensures QoS requirements to be met for the service regardless of the chosen
transmission method.

Figure 1: Dynamic PTP/PTM switch for MBS multicast
**Lossless handover for MBS multicast:** To support high QoS services, it is
necessary to ensure lossless data delivery also during a handover. To enable
lossless handover, synchronisation of PDCP SNs among source and target RAN
nodes should be ensured, by either or a combination of the following methods:
\- Derivation of the PDCP SNs from DL MBS QFI SNs provided on NG-U;
\- Deployment of a Shared NG-U Termination at NG-RAN, shared among gNBs, which
comprises a common entity for assignment of PDCP SNs.
{width="2.9916666666666667in" height="1.9840277777777777in"}
Figure 2: PDCP SN synchronization to enable lossless
**MBS Broadcast:** MBS broadcast provides the downlink only MBS delivery mode
for UE in all RRC states, addressing lower QoS services, with the following
characteristics:
**Group scheduling:** A common frequency resource (CFR) is defined for
broadcast scheduling as an 'MBS frequency region' with a number of contiguous
PRBs in which G-RNTI can be used to schedule the associated MBS broadcast
service. The bandwidth of CFR can be equal to or larger than initial BWP,
which is indicated by system information. HARQ feedback and HARQ re-
transmission is not supported for MBS broadcast.
**MBS broadcast Configuration:** The UE can receive the MBS configuration for
a broadcast service via a broadcast control channel, i.e. MCCH, which is the
same for UEs in RRC_IDLE , RRC_INACTIVE and RRC_CONNECTED states.
**Service continuity:** Lossless mobility cannot be ensured for MBS broadcast,
but some mechanisms are specified to support service continuity of the
broadcast service. NR MBS broadcast supports MBS frequency prioritization,
which enables the UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE to select the right frequency to
camp on and receive its services of interest.
To ensure service continuity of MBS broadcast for UEs in RRC_CONNECTED, the UE
can send MBS Interest Indication to the gNB and the gNB can configure the UE
in a way allowing it to receive the services the UE is interested in using MBS
broadcast.

The 5G MBS User Services had been developed by SA4 within the 5MBUSA Work
Item, and the stage 2 architecture and procedures are documented in TS 26.502
[2]. In addition, architectural extensions to the delivery of 5GMS via eMBMS
had been documented TS 26.501 [3] as part of the 5MBUSA work item. This work
item now addresses relevant stage-3 specifications for 5MBS and 5GMS via eMBMS
as follows:
1\. Stage 3 format and protocol for User Service Announcement (between MBSF
and MBS Client) are specified in a new specification TS 26.517 [4], addressing
reference point M5.
2\. Stage 3 protocols for the MBS distribution methods (between MBSTF and MBS
Client) based on existing MBMS delivery methods are specified, addressing
reference point M4, namely
â€¢ Object distribution methods, based on download delivery methods defined in
MBMS with reference to TS 26.346 [6].
â€¢ Packet distribution methods, based on transparent delivery methods with
reference to TS 26.346 [6].
3\. Relevant extensions to TS 26.512 [5], TS 26.346 [6], TS 26.347 [7] and TS
26.348 [8] to support 5G Media Streaming via eMBMS.
Continuous exchange, in particular with RAN2, SA2, SA3, SA6, CT3 and CT4, was
needed. Additional aspects are expected to be addressed in Rel-18 follow-up
work items.

Summary based on the input provided by TELUS in SP-220646.
This Study is about potential architecture enhancement to enable 5G multicast-
broadcast media streaming. It further provides recommendations for normative
specification work on a generic 5G MBS User Service Architecture.
Note: Standalone Studies (i.e. without corresponding normative work) are
usually not reported in this document. An exception has been made for this
study.
The following key issues are studied in this work item:
  * Support of Multicast ABR in 5G Media Streaming Architecture
  * Nmb2 Design Considerations
  * Collaboration and Deployment Scenarios
  * Reuse of MBMS Service Layer
  * Client Architecture Options
  * Hybrid Services
  * 5GMS via eMBMS
This study concludes that functional entities for a generic 5G MBS User
Service Architecture are determined to be defined in normative specification
TS 26.502 [2] to support 5G Multicast-Broadcast applications. It presents a
complete service offering to an end-user, via a set of APIs that allows the
MBS Client to activate or deactivate reception of the service.
The 5MBS User Service architecture is independent of 5G Media Streaming (5GMS)
and may or may not be used by 5GMS. 5G Multicast ABR media streaming service
could be a User Service where the MBS User Services allow streaming of DASH
content as defined in TS 26.501 [3], and it also includes the use of an MBS
session to deliver the DASH segments in multicast. When delivering content to
a MBS Client, the MBSTF uses one or more MBS Delivery Methods.

Summary based on the input provided by ZTE Corporation, Sanechips in
RP-220154.
This work item enables the transmission of small signalling and/or data
packets whilst the UE remains in RRC_INACTIVE state. Prior to Rel-17, NR
supports RRC_INACTIVE state and UEs with infrequent (periodic and/or non-
periodic) data transmission are generally maintained by the network in the
RRC_INACTIVE state. Until Rel-16, the RRC_INACTIVE state doesn't support data
transmission. Hence, the UE has to resume the connection (i.e. move to
RRC_CONNECTED state) for any DL (MT) and UL (MO) data. Connection setup and
subsequently release to INACTIVE state happens for each data transmission
however small and infrequent the data packets are. This results in unnecessary
power consumption and signalling overhead.
Some examples of small and infrequent data traffic include Smartphone
applications such as: traffic from Instant Messaging services; Heart-
beat/keep-alive traffic from IM/email clients and other apps; Push
notifications from various applications. Other examples are non-smartphone
applications such as: traffic from wearables (periodic positioning information
etc); sensors (Industrial Wireless Sensor Networks transmitting temperature,
pressure readings periodically or in an event triggered manner etc); smart
meters and smart meter networks sending periodic meter readings.
As noted in TS 22.891, the NR system shall be efficient and flexible for low
throughput short data bursts, support efficient signalling mechanisms (e.g.
signalling is less than payload) and reduce signalling overhead in general.
Signalling overhead from INACTIVE state UEs for small data packets is a
general problem and will become a critical issue with more UEs in NR not only
for network performance and efficiency but also for the UE battery
performance. In general, any device that has intermittent small data packets
in INACTIVE state will benefit from enabling small data transmission in
INACTIVE.
The key enablers for small data transmission in NR, namely the INACTIVE state,
2-step, 4-step RACH and configured grant type-1 have already been specified as
part of Rel-15 and Rel-16. So, this work builds on these building blocks to
enable small data transmission in INACTIVE state for NR.
The Small Data Transmission (SDT) feature allows data and/or signalling
transmission while the UE remains in RRC_INACTIVE (i.e. without transitioning
to RRC_CONNECTED state). SDT is enabled on a radio bearer basis and is
initiated by the UE only if:
\- less than a configured amount of UL data awaits transmission across all
radio bearers for which SDT is enabled, and;
\- the DL RSRP is above a configured threshold, and;
\- a valid SDT resource (either RACH or Configured grant) is available
SDT procedure is initiated with either a transmission over RACH (referred to
as RA-SDT) or over Type 1 CG resources (referred to as CG-SDT). The SDT
resources can be configured on initial BWP (for both RACH and CG). RACH and CG
resources for SDT can be configured on either or both of NUL and SUL carriers.
The initial PUSCH transmission during the SDT procedure includes at least the
CCCH message. While the SDT procedure is ongoing, if data appears in a buffer
of any radio bearer not enabled for SDT, the UE initiates a transmission of a
non-SDT data arrival indication using UE assistance information message to the
network and, if available, includes the resume cause. The network may
configure UE to apply ROHC continuity for SDT either when the UE initiates SDT
in the cell where the UE received RRCRelease and transitioned to RRC_INACTIVE
state or when the UE initiates SDT in a cell of its RNA.
Details of RA-SDT
For RA-SDT, the network may configure 2-step and/or 4-step RA resources. The
UE in RRC_INACTIVE initiates RACH and requests RRC resume together with UL SDT
data/signalling. If the UE accesses a gNB other than the last serving gNB, the
UL SDT data/signalling is buffered at the receiving gNB, and then the
receiving gNB triggers the XnAP Retrieve UE Context procedure. RA-SDT is
supported with and without UE context relocation and these two mechanisms as
depicted in Figure 1 and Figure 2 below.

height="2.566666666666667in"}
Figure 1: RA-SDT with UE context relocation Figure 2: RA-SDT without UE
context relocation
Details of CG-SDT
The CG-SDT resources are valid only within the cell the UE receives the
previous RRCRelease (i.e. only for the no cell change case). When using CG
resources for initial SDT transmission, the UE can perform autonomous
retransmission of the initial transmission if the UE does not receive
confirmation from the network. The network can schedule subsequent UL
transmissions using dynamic grants or they can take place on the following CG
resource occasions. The DL transmissions are scheduled using dynamic
assignments. The UE can initiate subsequent UL transmission only after
reception of confirmation for the initial PUSCH transmission from the network.
For subsequent UL transmission, the UE cannot initiate re-transmission over a
CG-SDT resource. CG-SDT can only be initiated with valid UL timing alignment.
The UL timing alignment is maintained by the UE based on a SDT-specific timing
alignment timer configured by the network via dedicated signalling and, for
initial CG-SDT transmission, also by DL RSRP of configured number of highest
ranked SSBs which are above a configured RSRP threshold. Upon expiry of the
SDT-specific timing alignment timer, the CG resources are released.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-220530.
This Rel-17 work item introduced additional enhancements for NB-IoT and LTE-
MTC based on features standardized in Rel-13 and enhancements performed from
Rel-14 through Rel-16. Rel-17 adds features such as 16QAM for NB-IoT in
downlink and uplink, 14 HARQ processes in downlink for HD-FDD Cat. M1 UEs, NB-
IoT neighbour cell measurement and triggering before RLF, NB-IoT carrier
selection based on coverage level, and a maximum DL TBS of 1736 bits for HD-
FDD Cat. M1 UEs [1].
[16-QAM for unicast in UL and DL for NB-IoT]{.underline}
From Rel-13 to Rel-16, an NB-IoT UE can use QPSK for unicast NPDSCH, and QPSK
or BPSK for unicast NPUSCH.
This feature allows an NB-IoT UE to use 16-QAM for unicast NPDSCH with TBS up
to 4968 bits for standalone and guard-band deployments and 3624 bits for in-
band deployments; and allows an NB-IoT UE to use 16-QAM for unicast NPUSCH
with TBS up to 2536 bits (which can be transmitted with up to half the time-
domain resources with respect to QPSK). When 16-QAM for unicast NPDSCH is
configured, an NB-IoT UE can report the channel quality report by reporting
the recommended NPDCCH repetition and NPDSCH modulation and coding scheme.
[Additional PDSCH scheduling delay for 14-HARQ processes in DL for LTE-
MTC]{.underline}
{width="6.688194444444444in" height="0.5840277777777778in"}
Figure 1: PDSCH transmission with 10 HARQ processes for HD-FDD Cat. M1 UEs
With 10 HARQ processes, a HD-FDD Cat. M1 UE cannot use all available downlink
subframes to transmit PDSCH. As shown in Figure 1, the subframes #0, #1, #17,
#18 cannot be scheduled to transmit PDSCH (as marked with an X).
This feature allows HD-FDD Cat. M1 UEs to use up to 14 HARQ processes in CE
Mode A with an additional PDSCH scheduling delay to fully utilize the
available BL/CE downlink and BL/CE uplink subframes, where the PDSCH
scheduling delay can be indicated as 2 BL/CE DL subframes or a longer delay
that consists of different subframe types. Two alternatives for the HARQ-ACK
delay indication can be configured: either the HARQ-ACK delay consists of
different subframe types, or the HARQ-ACK delay is indicated among sets of
absolute subframes.
[Neighbour cell measurements and measurement triggering before RLF for NB-
IoT]{.underline}
This feature introduces measurements in RRC_CONNECTED for NB-IoT UEs to reduce
the time taken for RRC connection reestablishment. The criteria to perform the
measurements are signalled separately for intra- and inter-frequency
measurements via broadcast signalling. Since dedicated measurements gaps are
not supported, the UE may need to perform neighbour cell measurements during
DL/UL idle periods that are provided by DRX or packet scheduling.
[Carrier selection based on coverage level for NB-IoT]{.underline}
This feature introduces coverage-based paging in NB-IoT to reduce the latency
and the resource usage in the network.
When coverage-based paging is enabled, up to two groups of paging carriers can
be configured for lower levels of coverage enhancements. The eNB configures
the UE during RRC connection release to use one of these groups of paging
carriers. If configured, the UE selects a paging carrier in its assigned group
if its NRSRP is suitable according to the paging carrier configuration.
Coverage based paging is only applicable in the last cell where the coverage
information was received.
[Maximum DL TBS of 1736 bits for eMTC]{.underline}
From Rel-13 to Rel-16, the max DL TBS size for LTE-MTC Cat. M1 UEs is 1000
bits.
This feature allows HD-FDD Cat. M1 UEs to use a DL TBS of up to 1736 bits in
CE Mode A, and the soft channel bits for UE supporting this feature is 43008
bits.

In order to extend the NR applicability in various verticals with tight
latency and reliability requirements, Release 16 IIoT work item has introduced
transmission reliability enhancements for Time Sensitive Communications (TSC)
and addressed efficiency of the system where UEs handle a mixture of URLLC and
eMBB traffic. In TSG SA enhancements for the support TSC have been studied
(see TR23.700-20) with normative work followed accordingly for Release 17.
This Release 17 work item introduced the following enhancements in RAN:
**Physical Layer feedback enhancements for HARQ-ACK and CSI reporting:** For
HARQ-ACK feedback enhancements, SPS HARQ-ACK deferral was introduced to
prevent excessive SPS HARQ-ACK dropping for PUCCH on TDD cells. Besides, to
reduce latency, PUCCH cell switching is supported between the PCell, PSCell,
PUCCH-SCell and an additional PUCCH-sSCell for TDD cells. Furthermore, PUCCH
repetition enhancements over multiple slots/subslots, HARQ-ACK codebook
enhancements and triggered HARQ-ACK codebook retransmissions were introduced
to improve the HARQ-ACK feedback reliability.
For CSI reporting, enhanced 4-bit sub-band CQI report with absolute values was
introduced targeting URLLC services with high reliability requirements and
tight latency constraints.
**Intra-UE multiplexing and prioritization of traffic with different
priority:** To improve UL and DL efficiency and reduce PHY latency for high
priority traffic, enhancements on intra-UE multiplexing and prioritization
were introduced for overlapping dynamic grant and CG PUSCH of different PHY
priorities, multiplexing HARQ-ACK on a PUCCH or PUSCH of a different PHY
priority, and simultaneous PUCCH and PUSCH transmissions of different PHY
priorities on different cells for inter-band carrier aggregation (CA).
**Uplink enhancements for URLLC in unlicensed controlled environments:** URLLC
services can be supported in shared spectrum where LBT failures are assumed to
be not frequent. For this scenario, semi-static channel occupancy initiated by
the UE was introduced.
Besides, autonomous retransmissions for UL configured grant (CG) and enhanced
intra-UE overlapping resource prioritization mechanisms may be enabled
simultaneously to harmonize the NR-U and URLLC CG operation.
**Enhancements for support of time synchronization with propagation delay
compensation:** To improve the absolute time synchronization accuracy of a UE
being essential for Time-Sensitive Network (TSN)/TSC operation, two
propagation delay compensation (PDC) enhancements are introduced to compensate
for time synchronization errors caused by the propagation delay between gNB
and UE: PDC based on round-trip-time (RTT) measurements and PDC based on
timing advance (TA), which can be performed at the UE or gNB side.
**RAN enhancements based on new QoS related parameter (survival time):** In
addition to the TSC traffic characteristics introduced in Release 16 as TSC
Assistance Information (TSCAI), the Core Network may provide survival time as
part of the TSCAI to allow for efficient scheduling at the gNB while
satisfying the performance requirements of periodic deterministic
communication.
To support uplink periodic traffics of services with survival time
requirement, configured grant resources can be used such that the mapping
relation between the service and the configured grant is known to both gNB and
UE. The gNB can use configured grant retransmission scheduling grant to
trigger survival time state entry for a DRB which activates all the RLC
entities configured for PDCP duplication of the corresponding DRB to prevent
failure of subsequent messages.

Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in SP-220425.
In Release 17, the 5G System expands the support for Time Synchronization and
Time Sensitive communications for any application.
The 5G System architecture enables any Application Function (AF) - in the same
or different trust domain - to provide its requirements for QoS, traffic
characteristics for QoS scheduling optimization, time synchronization
activation and deactivation.
If the AF is in a different trust domain from the 5G System, then it provides
input via exposure framework, NEF API. If the AF is in the same trust domain
as the 5G System, then it provides input directly via the Time Sensitive
communication Time Synchronization function (TSCTSF).
The Functional Architecture is shown in the figure below:
Figure 1: Architecture to enable Time Sensitive Communication and Time
Synchronization services
The figure below depicts the two main synchronization methods supported: the
5GS synchronization and the (g)PTP domain synchronization.
â€¢ 5G Clock synchronization: Used for NG RAN synchronization and also
distributed to the UE. 5G Clock synchronization over the radio interface
towards the UE is specified in TS 38.331.
â€¢ (g)PTP synchronization: Provides time synchronization service to (g)PTP
network. This process follows the standards IEEE Std 802.1AS or IEEE 1588
operation.
The two synchronization processes can be considered independent from each
other and the gNB only needs to be synchronized to the 5G Grand Master (GM)
clock.
Figure 2: 5G system is modelled as PTP instance for supporting time
synchronization
In order to support (g)PtP time synchronization, the 5G System operates in any
of the following modes:
1\. as time-aware system (IEEE Std 802.1AS).
2\. as Boundary Clock (IEEE Std 1588).
3\. as peer-to-peer Transparent Clock (IEEE Std 1588).
4\. as end-to-end Transparent Clock (IEEE Std 1588).
The 5GS shall be modelled as an IEEE Std 802.1AS or IEEE Std 1588 compliant
entity based on the above configuration. The TTs located at the edge of the 5G
system (i.e. device side DS-TT and network side NW-TT) are responsible for
fulfilling functionalities related to IEEE Std 802.1AS or IEEE Std 1588.
The 5G System is provisioned by the profiles supported by 3GPP specifications
that include: Default PTP Profile, IEEE Std 802.1AS PTP profile for transport
of timing as defined in IEEE Std 802.1AS, SMPTE Profile for use of IEEE Std
1588 Precision Time Protocol in Professional Broadcast Applications.
Furthermore, (g)PtP time synchronization is supported for the scenarios when
Grand Master clock is behind the UE (uplink time sync, UE -- UE time sync) and
behind the network (down link time sync).
The ability for the AF to influence activation of 5G reference time
distribution to the UE(s) along with time synchronization error budget (based
on the accuracy needed for the application) has also been introduced.
Time Sensitive Communication and QoS
TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI) describes traffic characteristics that may
be provided for use by the gNB, to allow more efficiently scheduled radio
resources for periodic traffic and applying to PDU session type Ethernet and
IP.
TSCAI describes TSC traffic characteristics for use in the 5G System. The
knowledge of TSC traffic pattern is useful for 5G-AN to allow it to more
efficiently schedule periodic and deterministic traffic flows either via
Configured Grants, Semi-Persistent Scheduling or with Dynamic Grants.
Table 1: TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI)
Assistance Information Description
* * *
Flow Direction The direction of the TSC flow (uplink or downlink). Periodicity
It refers to the time period between start of two data bursts. Burst Arrival
Time (optional) The latest possible time when the first packet of the data
burst arrives at either the ingress of the RAN (downlink flow direction) or
the egress interface of the UE (uplink flow direction). Survival Time
(optional) Survival Time, as defined in TS 22.261 [2], is synonymous with the
time period an application can survive without any data burst.
5GS determines TSC Assistance Container based on information provided by an
AF/NEF and may provide it to PCF for IP type and Ethernet type PDU sessions.
The AF may provide the traffic pattern parameters such as Burst Arrival Time
with reference to the ingress port, Periodicity, Flow Direction, Survival Time
and Time domain to the NEF. The NEF forwards the received traffic pattern
parameters to TSCTSF.
The AF trusted by the operator can be allowed to provide such traffic pattern
parameters to TSCTSF directly. The TSCTSF is responsible for determining and
forwarding these traffic pattern parameters in TSC Assistance Container to the
SMF (via PCF).
Survival Time was also introduced as part of TSCAI in order for the AF to
provide the time period an application can survive without any burst. It
refers to the time that an application consuming a communication service may
continue without an anticipated message. Maximum number of messages (message
is equivalent to a burst) or in terms of time units. Single burst is expected
within a single time period referred to as the periodicity.

Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-221163.
This Rel-17 work item introduces support for UE complexity reduction
techniques and UE power saving techniques suitable for IoT use cases such as
industrial wireless sensors, video surveillance, and wearables, with
requirements on low UE complexity and/or low UE power consumption and with
relatively relaxed data rate requirements. Following an initial study [1],
this work item [2] specified support for a reduced capability (RedCap) UE type
and two UE power saving techniques: Extended DRX in RRC idle/inactive state,
and RRM measurement relaxation for neighbour cells.
The following key functionalities are introduced as part of this work item:
**Reduced capability (RedCap) UE type:** The new reduced capability (RedCap)
UE type enables reduced UE complexity through various UE complexity reduction
techniques. A RedCap UE supports a maximum UE Rx/Tx bandwidth of 20 MHz in FR1
and 100 MHz in FR2 (whereas a normal NR UE supports at least 100 MHz in FR1
and 200 MHz in FR2). A RedCap UE cannot support larger Rx/Tx UE bandwidths
than 20 MHz in FR1 and 100 MHz in FR2, and it cannot support features related
to carrier aggregation (CA), dual connectivity (DC), more than 2 UE Rx/Tx
antenna branches, or more than 2 DL/UL MIMO layers.
A RedCap UE can furthermore have a reduced antenna configuration and a reduced
number of DL MIMO layers:
â€¢ For FR1, a RedCap UE supports 1 or 2 UE Rx branches and 1 or 2 DL MIMO
layers. The supported number of DL MIMO layers is the same as the implemented
number of Rx branches, and as a result, 2-Rx RedCap UEs have twice as high DL
peak rate as 1-Rx RedCap UEs. The UE indicates to gNB how many branches/layers
it supports. The gNB can allow or disallow access from 1-Rx and 2-Rx RedCap
UEs separately per cell.
â€¢ For FR2, a RedCap UE can either support a legacy UE power class such as PC3
or the new lower UE power class PC7 (with a reduced-complexity reference UE
Rx/Tx antenna configuration with either 1 panel with 4 elements or 2 panels
with 2 elements each, corresponding to half the number of array elements
compared to a legacy PC3 UE). Furthermore, the UE indicates support for 1 or 2
DL MIMO layers (independent of the antenna configuration).
A RedCap UE in FDD mode can report per band whether it implements half-duplex
FDD (HD-FDD) or full-duplex FDD (FD-FDD) support. In HD-FDD operation, the UE
is not required to transmit and receive at the same time. The network
indicates in SIB1 whether the cell supports HD-FDD RedCap UEs.
A RedCap UE can be implemented with or without support for DL 256QAM in FR1.
Compared to 64QAM (which is mandatory for RedCap UEs), 256QAM support
increases the peak data rate by \~33%. Support for UL 256QAM in FR1 and DL/UL
256QAM in FR2 is also optional for RedCap UEs, but this is true even for
legacy NR UEs.
Some higher layer features are optional for RedCap UEs: RedCap UEs can
optionally support 16 DRBs (as normal NR UEs) but only have mandatory support
of 8 DRBs. RedCap UEs can optionally support 18-bit PDCP/RLC sequence numbers
(as normal NR UEs) but only have mandatory support for 12-bit sequence
numbers. RedCap UEs have optional (but not mandatory) support for automatic
neighbour relation (ANR) functionality.
Due to the reduced UE bandwidth, there are some modifications of the bandwidth
part (BWP) operation. Separate initial DL/UL BWPs can be configured for random
access for RedCap UEs, which may be required if one or both of the ordinary
initial DL/UL BWPs in the cell are configured with a bandwidth which is wider
than the maximum RedCap UE bandwidth (i.e., wider than 20 MHz in FR1 or wider
than 100 MHz in FR2). A separate initial DL BWP can, but does not need to,
contain SSB/CORESET#0/SIB. A DL BWP used in connected mode needs to contain
(cell-defining or non-cell-defining) SSB but not necessarily CORESET#0/SIB.
The UE provides an early indication already during random access that it is a
RedCap UE. If RedCap-specific PRACH resources are configured in the cell, the
early indication is provided implicitly already by Msg1. In any case, an
indication will be provided in Msg3 (or MsgA in case of 2-step RACH) in the
form of a RedCap-specific LCID value for CCCH.
To minimize UL resource fragmentation for other UEs, the network can choose to
disable frequency hopping for the PUCCH transmission carrying HARQ-ACK
feedback for Msg4 (similar to how PUCCH frequency hopping can be disabled in
connected mode).
**Extended DRX in RRC idle/inactive state:** Extended DRX cycles are
introduced for RRC idle state (up to 10485.76 seconds, i.e., roughly 3 hours)
and RRC inactive state (up to 10.24 seconds) as an optional feature for both
RedCap and non-RedCap UEs. For use cases with relatively relaxed requirements
on DL reachability/latency, the network may configure an extended DRX cycle,
which may reduce the UE power consumption substantially during periods with
large enough packet inter-arrival time.
**RRM measurement relaxation for neighbour cells:** RRM measurement relaxation
for neighbour cells is introduced as an optional feature for RedCap UEs that
can be enabled by the network. In RRC idle/inactive states, to help reduce UE
power consumption, the UE is allowed to further relax neighbour-cell RRM
measurements (compared to existing Rel-16 relaxation functionality) when an
RSRP/RSRQ-based stationarity criterion is met for a period of time, or when
both the stationarity criterion and a not-at-cell-edge criterion are met. In
RRC connected state, the network may configure the RSRP/RSRQ-based
stationarity criterion and in that case the UE shall report when the criterion
is met or no longer met (and how to use the reporting information is up to the
network implementation).
_Charging aspects (as per SP-220697 from China Mobile)_
SA2 have studied the architecture enhancement for NR RedCap and introduced the
NR RedCap UEs differentiation requirement in clause 5.41 of TS 23.501[4].
Accordingly, CT3 and CT4 have specified a new RAT type NR RedCap. Based on the
conclusion, SA5 mainly focus on the charging requirement of 'RedCap NR
Devices' or 'devices using NR RedCap', which can be used by operators to
charge differentially.

Summary based on the input provided by China Mobile in SP-220285.
This Feature improves the messaging communication capability of the 5G System,
especially for Massive Internet of Things (MIoT). It is based on the study in
TR 23.700-24 [4].
Note: The different stages have been spread on different Releases, and on
different Features, using different acronyms: Stage 1 is defined in Rel-16 by
\"MSGin5G\" (TS 22.262 [2]), Stages 2 (TS 23.554 [1] ) and Stage 3 are defined
in Rel-17 by \"5GMARCH\" and Security aspects have been defined in Rel-17 by
\"5GMSG\". This does not comply with the 3GPP methodology (all stages shall be
defined within a same Release and using the same Feature/acronym). The name
used to refer to this service in the specifications and in this summary is
\"MSGin5G\".
The following figure, from TS 23.554 [1], provides the high level illustration
of the MSGin5G service:
Figure 1: Application Architecture of the MSGin5G Service
The following functions are specified:
a) Configuration of MSGin5G UE and Non-MSGin5G UE to get the MSGin5G Service
configuration information (e.g. UE Service ID);
b) Registration of MSGin5G UE and registration of Message Gateway on behalf of
the Non-3GPP UEs;
c) Message delivery procedures for the message communication models listed
below (the message can be delivered between different PLMNs):
> â€¢ Point-to-point message which happens between a person and a thing or two
> things;
>
> â€¢ Application-to-point message/ Point-to-application message which happens
> between an application server and an IoT device;
>
> â€¢ Group message which originates at a UE and terminated at a group of UEs,
> all members in the group can send and receive the message;
>
> â€¢ Broadcast message which originates at an application sever in the network
> or an UE and terminated at all the UEs in a specific service area within a
> cell or multiple cells;
>
> â€¢ Message delivery based on messaging topic which the message is delivered
> to all subscribers (UE or Application Server) of this messaging topic.
d) Message Aggregation can be used to optimize communications towards the same
target by aggregating one or more messages into a single message;
e) MSGin5G message can be segmented transmission if the content is larger than
the maximum payload length of a message and reassembled by the suitable
recipient;
f) MSGin5G message can be stored by the MSGin5G Server if a UE is unavailable
(disconnected or power off) for future delivery once the UE becomes available;
g) 3GPP network functionalities of UE reachability status monitoring and
device triggering can be leveraged by the MSGin5G Service via Core Network
exposure.
h) The Service Enabler Architecture Layer for Verticals (SEAL) capabilities
\"Group management service\" and \"Configuration management service\" can be
used by the MSGin5G service. These services are specified in TS 23.434 [6] and
TS 23.554 [1].

Summary based on the input provided by CATT in SP-220695.
Based on the conclusions reached within clause 8 of TR 23.752 [1], the
enhancements of 5G System to support Proximity base Services (5G ProSe) are
specified in TS 23.304 [2].
The 5G ProSe features are specified in TS 23.304 [2] and consist of 5G ProSe
Direct Discovery, 5G ProSe Direct Communication and 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
Relay.
5G ProSe Direct Discovery identifies that 5G ProSe-enabled UEs are in
proximity using NR. Both 5G ProSe Direct Discovery with 5G DDNMF and 5G ProSe
Direct Discovery procedures over PC5 reference point are specified. For 5G
ProSe Direct Discovery with 5G DDNMF, a new entity 5G DDNMF is introduced to
handle network related actions required for dynamic 5G ProSe Direct Discovery.
For 5G ProSe Direct Discovery procedures over PC5 reference point, both Group
Member Discovery and UE-to-Network Relay Discovery are specified. For all the
above 5G ProSe Direct Discovery, both Model A and Model B are supported.
5G ProSe Direct Communication enables establishment of communication paths
between two or more 5G ProSe-enabled UEs that are in direct communication
range using NR. 5G ProSe Direct Communication over NR based PC5 reference
point supports Broadcast mode, Groupcast mode, and Unicast mode. The Broadcast
and Groupcast mode Direct Communication is connection-less while Unicast mode
Direct Communication requires a PC5 unicast link be established between two
UEs. The Per-Flow QoS model is supported for 5G ProSe Direct Communication.
5G ProSe UE-to-Network Relay enables indirect communication between the 5G
network and UEs (e.g. for UEs that are out of coverage of the network). Both
5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay and 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay
are specified. The 5G ProSe Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay shall provide generic
function that can relay any IP (e.g. acts as IP router), Ethernet or
Unstructured traffic. The 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay provides
forwarding functionality that can relay any type of traffic over the PC5 link,
and 5G ProSe Layer-2 Remote UE has its own RRC connection and NAS connection
to the network.
The Policy/Parameters for 5G ProSe may be provisioned by PCF to UE, and in
order to support PC5 radio resource control in NG-RAN, the ProSe service
Authorisation information and PC5 QoS parameters for 5G ProSe need to be made
available in NG-RAN.
Based on the Stage 2 requirements to support 5G ProSe, the Stage 3 normative
work is specified in TS 24.554 [3], TS 24.555 [4], TS 29.555 [5], TS 29.557
[6] and TS 29.559 [7], the Security normative work is specified in TS 33.503
[8], and ProSe Charging is embedded in normative charging work as specified in
TS 32.240 [9].
_Charging aspects (as per SP-220696 from CATT)_
The charging aspects are specified in TS 23.304 [10]. The converged charging
architecture, principle, requirements, uses cases and charging information for
5G ProSe charging in the TS 32.277 [11] includes: 5G ProSe Direct Discovery
and Direct Communication, including UE-to-Network Relay; and PC5 QoS flow
information for 5G ProSe Direct Communication, e.g. PC5 QoS Flow Id, QoS
information, QoS Characteristics. The corresponding Open API and ASN.1 for 5G
ProSe charging are specified in the TS 32.291[12] and TS 32.298 [13].

RP-202846 LG Electronics
Summary based on the input provided by LG Electronics in RP-220521.
3GPP RAN technology for NR sidelink enhancement was specified through this WI
to mainly define the means for power saving and enhanced reliability and
reduced latency. This WI is the evolution of NR sidelink in Release 16.
The key functionalities of NR sidelink enhancement are detailed below.
[Power Savings Resource Allocation]{.underline}
The SL UE in Mode 2 can support partial sensing-based resource allocation and
random resource selection as power saving resource allocation methods. A SL
mode 2 TX resource pool can be (pre)configured to enable full sensing only,
partial sensing only, random selection only, or any combination(s) thereof. A
UE decides which resource allocation scheme(s) can be used in the AS based on
its capability (for a UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE/OOC) and the allowed
resource schemes in the resource pool configuration. Random resource selection
is applicable to both periodic and aperiodic traffic.
A UE configured for partial sensing can perform periodic-based partial sensing
and/or contiguous partial sensing for resource (re)selection. Periodic-based
partial sensing can only be performed in a TX pool configured with partial
sensing and periodic resource reservation. In periodic-based partial sensing,
the UE monitors slots in periodic sensing occasion(s) for a given resource
reservation periodicity. Contiguous partial sensing is performed by a UE
configured for partial sensing when resource (re)selection is triggered by the
UE in a TX pool configured with partial sensing. In contiguous partial
sensing, the UE monitors slots in a contiguous sensing window which occur
prior to the selected transmission resource.
[Inter-UE Coordination (IUC)]{.underline}
The SL UE can support inter-UE coordination (IUC) in Mode 2, whereby a UE-A
sends information about resources to UE-B, which UE-B then uses for resource
(re)selection. The following schemes of inter-UE coordination are supported:
\- IUC scheme 1, where the coordination information sent from a UE-A to a UE-B
is the preferred and/or non-preferred resources for UE-B's transmission, and
\- IUC scheme 2, where the coordination information sent from a UE-A to a UE-B
is the presence of expected/potential resource conflict on the resources
indicated by UE-B's SCI
In scheme 1, IUC can be triggered by an explicit request from UE-B, or by a
condition at UE-A. UE-A determines the set of resources reserved by other UEs
or slots where UE-A, when it is the intended receiver of UE-B, does not expect
to perform SL reception from UE-B due to half-duplex operation. UE-A uses
these resources as the set of non-preferred resources, or excludes these
resources to determine a set of preferred resources and sends the
preferred/non-preferred resources to UE-B. UE-B's resources for resource
(re)selection can be based on both UE-B's sensing results (if available) and
the coordination information received from UE-A, or it can be based only on
coordination information received from UE-A. For scheme 1, MAC CE and second-
stage SCI or MAC CE only can be used to send IUC. The explicit request and
reporting for IUC in unicast manner is supported.
In scheme 2, UE-A determines the expected/potential resource conflict within
the resources indicated by UE-B's SCI as either resources reserved by other
UEs and identified by UE-A as fully/partially overlapping with the resources
indicated by UE-B's SCI, or as slots where UE-A is the intended receiver of
UE-B and does not expect to perform SL reception on those slots due to half-
duplex operation. UE-B uses the conflicting resources to determine the
resources to be reselected and exclude the conflicting resources from the
reselected resources. For scheme 2, PSFCH is used to send IUC.
[SL DRX]{.underline}
Sidelink supports SL DRX for unicast, groupcast, and broadcast. Similar
parameters as defined for Uu (on-duration, inactivity-timer, retransmission-
timer, cycle) are defined for SL to determine the SL active time for SL DRX.
During the SL active time, the UE performs SCI monitoring for data reception
(i.e., PSCCH and 2nd stage SCI on PSSCH). The UE may skip monitoring of SCI
for data reception during SL DRX inactive time. The SL active time of the RX
UE includes the time in which any of its applicable SL on-duration timer(s),
SL inactivity-timer(s) or SL retransmission timer(s) (for any of unicast,
groupcast, or broadcast) are running. In addition, the slots associated with
announced periodic transmissions by the TX UE and the time in which a UE is
expecting CSI report following a CSI request (for unicast) are considered as
SL active time of the RX UE. When data is available for transmission to one or
more RX UE(s) configured with SL DRX, the TX UE selects resources taking into
account the active time of the RX UE(s) determined by the timers maintained at
the TX UE.
For unicast, SL DRX is configured per pair of source L2 ID and destination L2
ID. The UE maintains a set of SL DRX timers for each direction per pair of
source L2 ID and destination L2 ID. The SL DRX configuration for a pair of
source/destination L2 IDs for a direction may be negotiated between the UEs in
the AS layer. For SL DRX configuration of each direction, where one UE is the
TX UE and the other is the RX UE. RX UE may send assistance information, which
includes its desired on duration timer, SL DRX start offset, and SL DRX cycle,
to the TX UE and the mode 2 TX UE may use it to determine the SL DRX
configuration for the RX UE. Regardless of whether assistance information is
provided or not, the TX UE in RRC_IDLE/RRC_INACTIVE/OOC, or in RRC_CONNECTED
and using mode 2 resource allocation, determines the SL DRX Configuration for
the RX UE. For a TX UE in RRC_CONNECTED and using mode 1 resource allocation,
the SL DRX configuration for the RX UE is determined by the serving gNB of the
TX UE. TX UE sends the SL DRX configuration to be used by the RX UE to the RX
UE. The RX UE may accept or reject the SL DRX configuration. A default SL DRX
configuration for groupcast/broadcast can be used for DCR messages. When the
TX UE is in RRC_CONNECTED, the TX UE may report the received assistance
information to its serving gNB and sends the SL DRX configuration to the RX UE
upon receiving the SL DRX configuration in dedicated RRC signalling from the
gNB. When the RX UE is in RRC_CONNECTED, the RX UE can report the received SL
DRX configuration to its serving gNB, e.g. for alignment of the Uu and SL DRX
configurations. SL on-duration timer, SL inactivity-timer, SL HARQ RTT timer,
and SL HARQ retransmission timer are supported in unicast. SL HARQ RTT timer
and SL HARQ retransmission timer are maintained per SL process at the RX UE.
In addition to (pre)configured values for each of these timers, SL HARQ RTT
timer value can be derived from the retransmission resource timing when SCI
indicates more than one transmission resource. SL DRX MAC CE is introduced for
SL DRX operation in unicast only.
For groupcast/broadcast, SL DRX is configured commonly among multiple UEs
based on QoS profile and Destination L2 ID. Multiple SL DRX configurations can
be supported for each of groupcast/broadcast. SL on-duration timer, SL
inactivity-timer, SL HARQ RTT and SL retransmission timers are supported for
groupcast. Only SL on-duration timer is supported for broadcast. SL DRX cycle,
SL on-duration, and SL inactivity timer (only for groupcast) are configured
per QoS profile. The starting offset and slot offset of the SL DRX cycle is
determined based on the destination L2 ID. The SL HARQ RTT timer (only for
groupcast) and SL HARQ retransmission timer (only for groupcast) are not
configured per QoS profile or per destination L2 ID. For groupcast, the RX UE
maintains an SL inactivity timer for each destination L2 ID, and selects the
largest SL inactivity timer value if multiple SL inactivity timer values
associated with different QoS profiles are configured for that L2 ID. For
groupcast and broadcast, the RX UE maintains a single SL DRX cycle (selected
as the smallest SL DRX cycle of any QoS profile of that L2 ID) and single SL
on-duration (selected as the largest SL on-duration of any QoS profile of that
L2 ID) for each destination L2 ID when multiple QoS profiles are configured
for that L2 ID. For groupcast, SL HARQ RTT timer and SL retransmission timer
are maintained per SL process at the RX UE. SL HARQ RTT timer can be set to
different values to support both HARQ enabled and HARQ disabled transmissions.
A default SL DRX configuration, common between groupcast and broadcast, can be
used for a QoS profile which is not mapped onto any non-default SL DRX
configuration(s). For groupcast, the TX UE restarts its timer corresponding to
the SL inactivity timer for the destination L2 ID (used for determining the
allowable transmission time) upon reception of new data with the same
destination L2 ID. TX profile is introduced to ensure compatibility for
groupcast and broadcast transmissions between UEs supporting/not-supporting SL
DRX functionality. A TX profile is provided by upper layers to AS layer and
identifies one or more sidelink feature group(s). A TX UE only assumes SL DRX
for the RX UEs when the associated TX profile corresponds to support of SL
DRX. A RX UE determines that SL DRX is used if all destination L2 IDs of
interest have an associated TX profile corresponding to the support of SL DRX.
Alignment of Uu DRX and SL DRX for a UE in RRC_CONNECTED is supported for
unicast, groupcast, and broadcast. Alignment of Uu DRX and SL DRX at the same
UE is supported. In addition, for mode 1 scheduling, the alignment of Uu DRX
of the TX UE and SL DRX of the RX UE is supported. For SL RX UEs in
RRC_CONNECTED, alignment is achieved by the gNB.

Summary based on the input provided by OPPO, CMCC in RP-220211.
This WI specifies solutions to enable single-hop, sidelink-based, L2 and L3
based UE-to-Network (U2N) relay.
It specifies sidelink U2N relay supporting the following scenarios, i.e., for
remote UE in and out of gNB coverage, in the same or different cell coverage
as relay UE.
Figure 1: Scenarios for UE-to-Network Relay
[Common aspect for both L2 and L3 U2N Relay]{.underline}
In order to enable remote UE and relay UE to identify each other and to
establish sidelink connection, the scheme of sidelink discovery is introduced,
including protocol stack design, interest report to network and etc. Further
mechanism is adopted to enable network to configure the Uu RSRP threshold to
(dis)allow remote / relay UE operation at specific cell location.
Figure 2: Protocol Stack of Discovery Message for UE-to-Network Relay
In order for remote UE to connection to the proper relay UE, relay
(re)selection mechanism is introduced, in order for remote UE to base on the
sidelink link quality to select proper relay UE. And relay UE can indicate the
even of Uu link (e.g., Uu link disconnection or Uu link mobility) to remote
UE, so that remote UE can decide whether to perform relay reselection.
In order to support PC5 radio resource control in NG-RAN, ProSe service
authorisation information and PC5 QoS parameters for ProSe need to be made
available in NG-RAN. Beside the authorization for 5G ProSe direct discovery
and 5G ProSe direct communication, authorization IEs are introduced to
indicate whether the UE is authorised to use a 5G ProSe Layer-3 and/or Layer-2
UE-to-Network Relay and 5G ProSe Layer-2 UE-to-Network Remote UE. 5G ProSe PC5
QoS parameters are also supported.
[L2 U2N Relay specific aspect: User Plane]{.underline}
In order to support bearer mapping between sidelink connection between remote
and relay UE, and Uu connection between relay UE and gNB, an adaptation layer
is introduced, between RLC (which is per-hop deployed) and PDCP (which is end-
to-end deployed). The header of adaptation layer would carry the identity for
remote UE identification and bearer identification, in order for relay UE to
perform packet forwarding between the two sides.

Figure 4: Control plane protocol stack for L2 UE-to-Network Relay
[L2 U2N Relay specific aspect: Control Plane]{.underline}
In order for remote UE to acquire system information and paging message via
relay UE, the SIB forwarding mechanism is designed, so that relay UE can base
on the request and detailed parameter (for paging reception) from remote UE to
forward the necessary SIB and paging information to remote UE, upon
acquisition of SIB and paging message from network. Furthermore, in order to
save relay UE power consumption, network can use dedicated signalling to
delivery paging message to relay UE if it is in RRC_CONNECTED state. Based on
that, remote UE mobility in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE state can be supported.
Furthermore, in order to support remote UE mobility in RRC_CONNECTED state,
the switching between direct and indirect path for intra-gNB scenario is
introduced. Via the newly introduced measurement event, remote UE can report
the identified candidate connection (direct or indirect) to network, and
network can correspondingly switch the UE to the connection (indirect or
direct).

Summary based on the input provided by LG Electronics in SP-220357.
This work item specifies some improvements for the advanced Vehicle-to-
Everything (V2X) services. More precisely, it deals with V2X communication
over NR PC5 reference point (device-to-device) with power efficiency for
pedestrian UEs, i.e. UEs for Vulnerable Road Users. It results from a
preliminary study (TR 23.776 [1]).
The support of QoS-aware NR PC5 power efficiency for pedestrian UEs is
specified in TS 23.287 [2] as below:
> \- Overall description about support of QoS-aware NR PC5 power efficiency
> for pedestrian UEs regarding NR PC5 Discontinuous Reception (DRX)
> operations.
>
> \- PC5 DRX configuration, e.g. the mapping of PC5 QoS profile(s) to PC5 DRX
> cycle(s), default PC5 DRX configuration, for broadcast and groupcast when
> the UE is \"not served by E-UTRA\" and \"not served by NR\" as provisioned
> parameters for V2X communications over PC5 reference point.
>
> \- NR Tx Profile for broadcast and groupcast as provisioned parameters for
> V2X communications over PC5 reference point.
For NR-based unicast, groupcast and broadcast mode communication over PC5
reference point, PC5 DRX operations are supported to enable pedestrian UE
power saving.
The V2X layer determines the respective V2X service types, and derives the
corresponding PC5 QoS parameters based on either the mapping of V2X service
types to PC5 QoS parameters, or the V2X Application Requirements for the V2X
service type provided by the application layer. The V2X layer passes the PC5
QoS parameters and destination Layer-2 ID to the AS layer. For broadcast and
groupcast, the V2X layer also determines the NR Tx Profile for the respective
V2X service type based on the mapping of V2X service types to NR Tx Profiles
and provides the NR Tx Profile to the AS layer.
When the PC5 DRX operation is needed, e.g. based on the NR Tx Profile in case
of broadcast or groupcast, the AS layer determines the PC5 DRX parameter
values for V2X communication over PC5 reference point, taking into account,
e.g., PC5 QoS parameters and/or destination Layer-2 ID provided by the V2X
layer.
For unicast, two UEs may negotiate the PC5 DRX configuration in the AS layer,
and the PC5 DRX parameter values can be configured per pair of source and
destination Layer-2 IDs and per direction in the AS layer.
For broadcast and groupcast when the UE is \"not served by E-UTRA\" and \"not
served by NR\", the UE uses the provisioned PC5 DRX configuration for PC5 DRX
operation.
Based on the Stage 2 requirements to support NR PC5 DRX operations, Stage 3
normative works are specified in TS 24.587 [3], TS 24.588 [4] and TS 31.102
[5].

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-220653.
This is an enhancement to the features specified for the application layer
support for V2X applications in TS 23.286 [1]. The enhancement features
support advanced V2X services (e.g. Tele-Operated Driving, HD Maps)
considering the existing stage 1 and stage 2 work within 3GPP related to V2X
enhancements in TS 22.185 [2], TS 22.186 [3], TS 23.285 [4] and TS 23.287 [5],
as well as V2X application requirements defined outside 3GPP (e.g. 5GAA, ETSI
ITS, SAE).
To support the enhancement features to support V2X applications, some
enhancements to SEAL were specified using the eSEAL WI (see corresponding
section).
The following capabilities are added in the V2X Application Enabler (VAE)
layer:
a) Assistance for V2V communication mode switching enables provisioning the
V2X UE to apply V2V communication modes switching policies from the V2X
application specific layer.
b) V2X service discovery across multiple V2X service providers enables the V2X
UEs to discover V2X services from partner V2X service providers serving in
different geographic areas.
c) Obtaining dynamic local service information by a V2X UE from a partner V2X
service provider operating in the service area where the V2X UE is currently
located.
d) Dynamic group information update considering the consent of the user to
support V2X platooning.
e) Support for PC5 provisioning considering multi-operator scenario to enable
V2V/V2I communications.
f) Support for HD map dynamic information enables the V2X application server
(HD map server) to obtain dynamic object information (e.g. V2X UEs in certain
proximity range as decided by the V2X application server). Such information
supports HD map based automated driving or remote driving scenarios.
g) UE-to-UE Groupcast/Broadcast configuration and message delivery enables V2X
application server to utilize the VAE layer entities (VAE server and VAE
clients) to distribute UE-to-UE Groupcast/Broadcast policy configurations and
also distribute the V2X messages as per the configured policies.
h) VAE layer supported V2X communication using local MBMS is enabled.
i) Session-oriented services supports the session management requirements of
ToD applications where the ToD controller may reside in a UE or in the
application server.
j) Service adaptation and extended QoS monitoring and reporting provides a
simplified service requirements adaptation service towards the V2X application
server by abstracting the details of 3GPP system interactions.
The following capabilities are enhanced in the VAE layer:
a) The VAE server\'s service API exposure is conformed to CAPIF framework.
b) File distribution is enabled with Local MBMS.
c) Network monitoring by the V2X UE is enhanced with 5GC analytics and RAT
type.
The protocol aspects for the above capabilities are specified in TS 24.486
[6].
The openAPI specifications for the VAE server services (northbound APIs)
exposed to V2X application specific servers over Vs reference point are
specified in TS 29.486 [7].
To support the HD map dynamic information, the SEAL location management
service is enhanced to enable tracking of a host vehicle and the nearby V2X
UEs in the proximity range of the host vehicle and further obtaining dynamic
information from the V2X UEs in proximity range of the host vehicle. For more
details, please refer to eSEAL WI (see corresponding section).
The feasibility study for enhancements to application layer support for V2X
services is specified in TR 23.764 [8].

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, Hisilicon in SP-220577.
This Feature enhances 5G core network to support Edge Computing as specified
in TS 23.548[1]. The main functionalities include the discovery and re-
discover of Edge Application Server (EAS), edge relocation, network exposure
to EAS, support of 3GPP application layer architecture for enabling Edge
Computing, and AF guidance to determination of URSP rules.
The outputs of corresponding study phase are documented in TR 23.748[2].
**Discovery and re-discovery of Edge Application Server:** Before an UE
accessing to edge service, a suitable EAS needs to be discovered by the UE
considering different factors, e.g. UE location, UPF serving the UE and also
the EAS deployment. When one of the above factors changes due to e.g. UE
mobility, the EAS needs to be re-discovered to keep the path optimized.
EAS discovery and re-discovery mechanisms for different connectivity models
are specified. An EASDF (Edge Application Server Discovery Function) is
introduced to support these mechanisms.
**Edge relocation:** When EAS or PSA UPF relocates due to e.g. UE mobility,
5GS user plane path may be re-configured coordinating with AF to keep the path
optimized and minimize the impact to the user experience. Both AF and network
triggered edge relocation mechanisms are specified considering different
application requirements on e.g. Packet loss and user plane latency.
**Network exposure to EAS:** Network exposure with low latency is specified to
expose QoS monitoring results to EAS. With this UPF based network exposure,
the exposure path is shorten to enable the quick reaction of application to
the change of network condition.
**Support of 3GPP application layer architecture for enabling Edge
Computing:** An Edge Configuration Server (ECS) is specified in TS 23.558[3]
to support 3GPP application layer architecture for enabling Edge Computing.
The ECS address provisioning to UE via 5GC is defined to support such a
mechanism.
**AF guidance to PCF determination of URSP rules:** An AF related with Edge
computing may need to guide PCF determination of proper URSP rules, so that
the URSP configured on the UE can consider the requirements of application.
The application guidance for URSP rules determination mechanisms defined in
clause 4.15.6.10 of TS 23.502[4].

Summary based on the input provided by Samsung in SP-220622.
Edge computing is a well-known industry concept, and is supported within 3GPP
networks with the introduction of Edge computing capabilities in 5G System
Architecture (TS 23.501). While there have been efforts at the system level,
the overall application layer architecture needs supporting environment (such
as provisioning, discovery, registration, enabler layer capability exposure,
network capability exposure, support for service continuity) to enable edge
applications over 3GPP networks.
TS 23.558 [1] specifies the architecture, procedures and information flows to
enable edge applications over 3GPP networks.
Architecture for enabling edge applications based on the architectures
principles such as UE application portability, Edge Application portability,
service differentiation and flexible deployment.
The Edge Data Network (EDN) is a local Data Network. Edge Application
Server(s) and the Edge Enabler Server (EES) are contained within the EDN. EES
is primarily responsible for enabling discovery of the EASs; Edge Enabler
Client supports EAS discovery to the ACs in the UE; and, Edge Configuration
Server, providing configurations to the EEC. The Edge Configuration Server
provides configurations related to the EES, including details of the Edge Data
Network hosting the EES. The UE contains Application Client(s) and the Edge
Enabler Client (EEC). The Edge Application Server(s), the Edge Enabler Server
and the Edge Configuration Server may interact with the 3GPP Core Network.
With the support of the enabling layer, TS 23.558 [1] provides many rich
features at the application layer for support of the Edge Application, such
as:
â€¢ Service Provisioning: Enabling a UE with an Edge Enabler Client to find and
connect to available Edge Data Networks.
â€¢ Rich discovery: On-demand configuration provisioning by the Edge
Configuration Server and the query support of Edge Enabler Server allows
discovery of the Edges and the Edge Application Servers by a UE equipped with
the Edge Enabler Client.
â€¢ Dynamic availability: Due to the flexible nature, the availability of Edge
and the EAS can change dynamically due to multiple reasons, such as change in
deployments, mobility of the UE etc. UE can subscribe to such changes to fine
tune the services provided accordingly.
â€¢ Capability exposure: EES capability is exposed as APIs to EAS (e.g. via
CAPIF as specified in TS 23.222 [2]) as value added services to the EASs. The
EASs and EESs can also utilize 3GPP network capability exposure as SCEF/NEF
northbound APIs.
â€¢ Support for service continuity: With the UE being mobile, eventually, a
different server on Edge or Cloud can become more suitable for serving the AC.
To enable continuity of service in such scenarios, the architecture supports
transfer of the UE's application context to the new server whenever needed;
allowing the new server to restore the service without losing the application
context.
Management aspects of application layer support of the Edge Applications is
specified in TS 28.538 [3].
Security aspects of application layer support of the Edge Applications is
specified in TS 33.558 [4].
Stage 3 normative work for application layer support of the Edge Applications
are specified as open APIs in TS 24.558 [5] and 29.558 [6].

**[SA and CT aspects:]{.underline}**
This work item specifies the system enhancements to support some parameters of
GST (Generic Slice Template) as documented in NG.116. The following
enhancements are specified in this work item.
\- A new NSACF(Network Slicing Admission Control Function) is defined to
monitor and control the number of registered UEs per network slice and the
number of PDU Sessions per network slice for the network slices that are
subject to Network Slice Admission Control (NSAC)
\- A new QoS parameter \"Slice-Maximum Bit Rate\" (S-MBR) is defined to limit
the aggregate data rate in UL and DL per UE across all GBR and Non-GBR QoS
Flows for all PDU sessions associated with an S-NSSAI for the UE. The S-MBR is
enforced in RAN and is available in PCF for optional input to apply current
QoS functionality. In addition the PCF for the PDU Session may also be
configured to monitor the data rate per Network Slice for a UE and to
strengthen or relax the traffic restrictions for individual PDU Sessions or
PCC rules accordingly
\- The PCF is enhanced to monitor the data rate per Network Slice and based on
operator policies, apply a policy decision to strengthen the traffic
restrictions for individual PDU Sessions or PCC rules to ensure that the data
rate for the network slice does not exceed the NW Slice maximum data rate
parameter which is configured and stored in the UDR. The PCF may use NWDAF
service to monitor the data rate per Network Slice.
\- An optional Network Slice Simultaneous Registration Group (NSSRG)
information for each S-NSSAI in UE subscription is defined to indicate which
S-NSSAIs can be simultaneously provided to the UE in the Allowed NSSAI. The
serving PLMN AMF may also provide the supporting UE with the NSSRG information
related to the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN which are in the mapping information of
the Configured NSSAI. A UE which receives the NSSRG values in the network
slicing configuration information shall only include in the Requested NSSAI
S-NSSAIs that share a common NSSRG as per the received information.
\- A mechanism is defined to allow the AMF to provide Target NSSAI and RFSP to
RAN to steer the UE to another cell supporting network slices not available in
a current cell and RA. The Target NSSAI includes at least one S-NSSAI from the
Requested NSSAI not available in the current TA, but available in another TA
in different frequency band possibly overlapping with the current TA, and
optionally additional S-NSSAIs from the Requested NSSAI that are configured to
be available within the same TAs as the S-NSSAIs not available in the current
TA.
**[RAN aspects:]{.underline}**
Enhancement of RAN slicing for NR was specified through this WI to define the
slice aware cell reselection and slice specific RACH configuration and
prioritization, as well as to define solutions to support slice-based service
continuity, and to support the enforcement of Slice MBR, the usage of Target
NSSAI as introduced by SA2.
_Support slice aware cell reselection_
A new NSAG (Network Slice AS Group) mechanism is introduced for slice aware
cell reselection and slice specific RACH configuration, in order to avoid
exposing S-NSSAI over Uu interface for reason of security and overhead. In the
system information, the NSAG information is broadcast instead of S-NSSAI.
In order to assist slice aware cell reselection, the NG-RAN node can provide
NSAG specific cell reselection information of current cell and neighbour cell
in system information and in RRCRelease message as specified in TS 38.331. The
NSAG specific cell reselection information is provided per frequency per NSAG.
If NSAG specific cell reselection information is provided in dedicated
signalling, the UE shall ignore NSAG specific cell reselection information
provided in system information.
In the UE, NAS provides the NSAG information and their priorities to be
considered during cell reselection to the AS. When a UE supports slice aware
cell reselection, and NSAG specific cell reselection information is provided
to the UE, then the UE performs the slice aware cell reselection. The details
of slice aware cell reselection are specified in TS 38.304. In general, the UE
can derive reselection priorities for slice aware cell reselection, and then
perform cell reselection evaluation using legacy evaluation criteria.
_Support slice specific RACH configuration_
In order to support slice specific RACH configuration, separated RACH
partitioning (e.g., transmission occasions of time-frequency domain and
preambles) and RACH prioritization parameters (i.e., scalingFactorBI and
powerRampingStepHighPriority) can be configured per NSAG in system information
as specified in TS 38.331. All slices of a NSAG use the slice specific RACH
configuration of the same NSAG.
In a cell, there may be multiple slice-specific RACH configurations. One or
more of the NSAGs can be linked to a slice-specific RACH configuration. If a
NSAG is not linked to any slice specific RACH configuration, the common RACH
configuration can be used.
_Support service continuity_
In order to support service continuity for specific slice(s), the NG-RAN node
may use Multi-Carrier Resource Sharing or Resource Repartitioning to allocate
resources to a slice in case of slice resources shortage.
In Multi-Carrier Resource Sharing the RAN node can setup the dual connectivity
or carrier aggregation with different frequency and overlapping coverage where
the same slice is available.
The Resource Repartitioning allows a slice to use resources from the shared
pool or/and prioritized pool when its own dedicated or prioritized resources
are not available and the use of unused resources in the prioritized pool is
as specified in TS 28.541.
Slice RRM policies/restrictions associated with Resource Repartitioning are
configured from O&M.
Measurements of RRM policy utilization according to resource types defined in
TS 28.541 are reported from RAN nodes to O&M and may lead O&M to update the
configuration of the Slice RRM policies/restrictions.
_Support the enforcement of Slice MBR and the usage of Target NSSAI_
The UE-Slice MBR is introduced to limit the aggregate bit rate that can be
expected to be provided across all GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows corresponding to
PDU Sessions of the UE for the same slice (S-NSSAI) as specified in TS 23.501
and is ensured by the RAN.
In case of Dual Connectivity, the MN decides the DL UE Slice MBR and UL UE
Slice MBR limits to be assigned to the SN, and indicates these to the SN. In
addition, the PDCP entity at the SN applies the received DL UE Slice MBR limit
to the set of all bearers for which the SN hosts PDCP for the concerned Slice,
as defined in TS 23.501, and the MAC entity at the SN applies the received UL
UE Slice MBR limit to the scheduled uplink radio traffic at the SN for the
concerned Slice, as defined in TS 23.501.
In order to support the enforcement of Slice MBR, RAN interfaces including NG,
Xn, F1 and E1 are enhanced to transmit UE-Slice-MBR.
Target NSSAI is determined by Core Network on a per UE basis, and used by NG-
RAN to attempt to redirect the UE to a cell and TA in another frequency band
and TA that supports the S-NSSAIs in the Target NSSAI, as defined in TS
23.501. In order to support the usage of Target NSSAI at NG-RAN, NG interface
is enhanced to transmit Target NSSAI.

Summary based on the input provided by MATRIXX Software in SP-220075.
In 5G system when Network Slices allocated to third party providers are
deployed by Mobile Network Operators, how these third-party providers can be
charged for usage of assigned Network Slice(s), is not described. This work
item introduces a description focusing on one particular type of Network Slice
usage, leveraging from capabilities specified from Rel-15.
5G Data Connectivity charging specified in 5GS between SMF and CHF for
individual UEs PDU sessions from Rel-15, is used with Converged Charging
System (CCS) hosting the CHF extended to also cover the third-party provider
(addressed under the tenant concept).
By receiving the S-NSSAI for each UE PDU session, the enhanced CCS is able to
perform per tenant charging based on tenant\'s Network Slice total UEs data
connectivity usage, the Network Slice being identified by the S-NSSAI.
The internal behaviour of the enhanced CCS is not specified in this release.

Summary based on the input provided by Lenovo in SP-220591.
The Access Traffic Steering, Switching and Splitting (ATSS) feature in 5G
networks enables the establishment of a Multi Access (MA) PDU Session, which
supports multipath data communication between the UE and UPF, by
simultaneously exchanging data over a 3GPP access network (e.g., NG-RAN) and
over a non-3GPP access network (e.g., WLAN).
The ATSSS work in Rel-17 (aka ATSSS_ph2) specified enhancements for supporting
the following features (see [3]):
a) ATSSS steering mode enhancements (based on the conclusions in TR 23.700-93,
clause 8.1); and
b) Support of MA PDU Sessions with a 3GPP access over EPC and a non-3GPP
access over 5GC (based on the conclusions in TR 23.700-93, clause 8.3).
More specifically, the following enhancements were specified for the ATSSS in
Rel-17. They are grouped into two main categories: (1) Steering mode
enhancements, and (2) supporting an MA PDU Session with a 3GPP access leg over
EPC.
**[Steering mode enhancements:]{.underline}**
\- **PMF measurements per QoS flow** : To decide how to steer the traffic of a
data flow, access network performance measurements may need to be taken, to
estimate the RTT and/or the Packet Loss Rate over each of the accesses of a MA
PDU Session.
The access network performance measurements (which apply the Performance
Measurement Function (PMF) protocol) were enhanced to support RTT measurements
and Packet Loss Rate (PLR) measurements over a certain QoS flow (aka access
performance measurements per QoS flow). This is an improvement over Rel-16
wherein the access performance measurements are always conducted over the
default QoS flow and, therefore, provide a rough estimate of the RTT / PLR.
Whether the access performance measurements for a data flow are conducted over
the default QoS flow (as in Rel-16), or over the same QoS flow used to carry
the data flow, is determined by the network during the MA PDU Session
establishment. More details can be found in [1], clause 5.32.5.
\- **Load-Balancing without pre-defined split percentages** : This introduces
enhancements to the Load-Balancing steering mode, which is a steering mode
that splits the traffic of a data flow (in uplink and downlink direction
separately) across the 3GPP and the non-3GPP accesses. In Rel-16, the network
always provides split percentages (referred to as pre-defined or fixed
percentages), e.g., 20% on 3GPP access, 80% on non-3GPP access. In Rel-17,
however, the network may provide an \"autonomous load-balance indicator\" in
which case the UE and the UPF can freely and independently select their own
percentages for each access type. The selected percentages may change over
time, e.g., based on the RTT measurements. The UE and the UPF typically select
the percentages in a way that maximizes the aggregated throughput. This means
that using a load-balancing steering mode with the \"autonomous load-balance
indicator\" can maximize the throughput of a given data flow in the uplink and
in the downlink direction.
\- **Load-Balancing with the UE-assistance indication** : When the network
indicates that a data flow should be steered with the load-balancing steering
mode, the network may also provide a \"UE-assistance indication\" which
indicates that (a) the UE may decide how to distribute the UL traffic of the
matching data flow based on the UE\'s internal state (e.g., based on UE's
battery level), and that (b) the UE may inform the UPF how it decided to
distribute the UL traffic of the matching data flow.
Typically, the UE-assistance indicator can be provided for data flows for
which the network has no strong steering requirements. For example, when the
network has no strong steering requirements for the default traffic of an MA
PDU Session, the network can indicate (i) that this traffic must be steered
with Load-Balancing steering mode using 50% - 50% split percentages, and (ii)
that the UE is allowed to use other split percentages, such as 0% - 100%, if
this is needed by the UE to optimize its operation (e.g., to minimize its
battery consumption).
\- **Threshold values** : A steering mode can be linked with a threshold
condition, which specifies how the steering mode should be applied according
to this condition. For example, if the threshold condition \"RTT \ o For CN controlled subgrouping, AMF is responsible for assigning subgroup
> ID to the UE. The total number of subgroups for CN controlled subgrouping
> which can be configured e.g. by OAM is up to 8. It is assumed CN-based
> paging subgrouping support in an RNA is homogeneous.
>
> o For UE ID based subgrouping, the gNB and UE can determine the subgroup ID
> based on the UE ID and the total number of subgroups for UE ID based
> subgrouping in the cell. The total number of subgroups for UE ID based
> subgrouping is decided by the gNB for each cell and can be different in
> different cells.
â€¢ Total number of subgroups allowed in a cell is up to 8 and represents the
sum of CN controlled and UE ID based subgrouping configured by the network;
â€¢ A UE with CN controlled subgroup ID shall apply CN controlled subgroup ID if
there is a corresponding indication allocated in the PEI for the CN controlled
subgroup; otherwise, it derives UE ID based subgroup ID if the cell supports
only UE ID based subgrouping.
PEI associated with subgroups has the following characteristics:
â€¢ If the PEI is supported by the UE, it shall at least support UE ID based
subgrouping method;
â€¢ PEI monitoring can be optionally limited via system information to the last
used cell;
â€¢ PEI monitoring is based on Type2A-PDCCH Common Search Space (CSS) set for a
DCI format 2_7 with CRC scrambled by a PEI-RNTI on the primary cell of the
MCG. Each bit of paging indication field of DCI format 2_7 indicates one UE
subgroup of a paging occasion;
â€¢ A PEI occasion (PEI-O) is a set of PDCCH monitoring occasions (MOs) and can
consist of multiple time slots (e.g. subframe or OFDM symbol) where PEI can be
sent. The number of PO(s) associated with one PEI -O is a factor of total PO
number associated with up to two paging frames (PFs).
â€¢ The time location of PEI-O for UE\'s PO is determined by a reference point
and a symbol-level offset from the reference point to the start of the first
PDCCH monitoring occasion of this PEI-O. The reference point is the start of a
reference frame determined by a frame-level offset from the start of the first
PF of the PF(s) associated with the PEI-O. The time location of PEI-O can be
configured so that total UE reception power consumption in idle/inactive mode,
including synchronization and RRM measurements, can be minimized.
**[Provision of potential TRS/CSI-RS occasion(s) available in connected mode
to idle/inactive-mode UEs]{.underline}**
In order to reduce UE power consumption due to synchronization for paging
receptions, RS configuration of TRS occasion(s) for idle/inactive UE(s) can be
provided via system information (SIB17). By exploiting TRS for
synchronization, UE can reduce the number of wake-up for SSB before a paging
reception and potentially achieve longer sleep. It is noticed that RS
configuration in SIB17 does not affect the UE behaviour in CONNECTED mode and
can be ignored by UE in CONNECTED mode.
The maximum number of TRS resource sets configured by higher layer is 64\. If
a TRS resource is configured, the L1 based availability indication is always
enabled based on that configuration. A UE which acquired SIB17 with a TRS
configuration but did not yet receive an associated L1-based availability
indication considers the configured TRS as unavailable. The L1 availability
indication is carried in a DCI format 2_7, if configured, and a DCI format 1_0
with CRC scrambled by P-RNTI. The TRS availability indication field in the DCI
format(s) provides a bitmap for up to 6 groups of TRS resource sets where the
configuration of each TRS resource set includes an association to a bit of the
bitmap. The UE can be additionally provided a validity duration for TRS
resource sets with indicated presence. UE considers the validity duration for
all TRS resource set groups is ended when UE receives the changed TRS/CSI-RS
configuration in the modification period following a SI change notification or
until the validity time duration expires, whichever is earlier.
**[Further PDCCH monitoring reduction, including enhanced SSSG switching and
PDCCH skipping]{.underline}**
In order to reduce UE power consumption on PDCCH monitoring, enhanced PDCCH
monitoring adaptation mechanisms within an active BWP and triggered by
scheduling DCI formats are provided. The adaptation applies to Type3-PDCCH CSS
sets or USS sets on the active DL BWP of the serving cell. The adaptation is
triggered according to the PDCCH monitoring adaptation indication field, if
present, in DCI format 0_1/0_2/1_1/1_2. With the fast adaptation mechanisms,
UE can be indicated to perform reduced PDCCH monitoring at the end of or after
a duration of data scheduling, thereby achieving UE power saving with minimum
impact to data scheduling.
UE power saving can be achieved through Rel-17 SSSG switching mechanism when
Rel-17 SSSG configuration is configured. UE can be indicated to switch to a
target SSSG via the indication of a scheduling DCI. If search space switch
timer is also configured, UE switches to the SSSG of the lowest group index
after timer expiration if no detected DCI format with CRC scrambled by
C-RNTI/CS-RNTI/MCS-C-RNTI for the configured timer duration. The switch delay
is at least Pswitch symbols, and Pswitch depends on the numerology of the
serving cell. For Rel-17, UE can be configured with up to 3 SSSGs.
UE power saving can also be achieved through PDCCH skipping mechanism when
PDCCH skipping duration configuration is configured. UE can be indicated to
skip PDCCH monitoring for a duration, starting from next slot after the
indication, and shall resume PDCCH monitoring after the indicated duration.
For Rel-17, UE can be configured with up to 3 skipping durations. In the
following cases, UE ignores PDCCH skipping:
\- on all serving cells of the corresponding Cell Group when SR is sent and is
pending;
\- on SpCell while contention resolution timer is running;
\- on SpCell during monitoring of the RAR/MsgB window.
UE can be configured with both Rel-17 SSSG configuration and PDCCH skipping
durations. In this case, UE performs either SSSG switching or PDCCH skipping
based on the PDCCH monitoring adaptation indication field in a detected DCI
format 0_1/0_2/1_1/1_2.
**[Relaxation of UE measurements for RLM and/or BFD in connected
mode]{.underline}**
UE power saving can be enabled by UE relaxing measurements for RLM/BFD. When
configured, UE determines whether its serving cell radio link quality is
better than a threshold and, if criterion is configured, whether it is in low
mobility state. The configuration for good serving cell quality criterion and,
if included, low mobility criterion is provided through dedicated signalling.
RLM and BFD relaxation may be enabled/disabled separately. Additionally, RLM
relaxation may be enabled/disabled on per-CG basis while the BFD relaxation
may be enabled/disabled on per serving cell basis.
The UE is only allowed to perform RLM and/or BFD relaxation when relaxed
measurement criterion for good serving cell quality and, if configured, for
low mobility is met. If configured to do so, the UE shall trigger reporting of
its RLM and/or BFD relaxation status through UE assistance information if the
UE changes its respective RLM and/or BFD relaxation status while meeting the
UE minimum requirements specified.

NG-RAN, network slice of various types (eMBB, URLLC, MIoT) (see [2]);
\- Use cases, requirements and solutions for saving energy in NG-RAN have been
described (see [1]);
\- 5G NRM (Network Resource Model), representing the management perspective of
5G networks, has been augmented with attributes capturing customer's

Summary based on the input provided by Samsung in RP-220802.
This WI introduces enhanced specification support for several key aspects on
multi-input multi-output (MIMO) operation where Rel-15 and 16 NR were found
deficient in terms of signalling latency, overhead, as well as spectral
efficiency and coverage.
First, although Rel-15/16 NR supports FR2 deployments via multi-beam
operation, signalling latency and overhead especially for beam indication are
high for common beam operation. This not only hampers deployments in high-
speed scenarios, but also scenarios where the number of configured TCI states
is large. In addition, it lacks the support for inter-cell operation, multi-
panel UEs, and maximum permissible exposure (MPE) mitigation.
Second, although Rel-16 NR introduced mTRP support for PDSCH, it still lacks
ample support for PDCCH, PUSCH, and PUCCH. In addition, enhancements for
inter-cell mTRP and beam management aspects specific to mTRP are introduced
along with features to facilitate high-speed train deployment on single
frequency network (HST-SFN).
Third, SRS has been a useful tool to acquire UL or DL CSI since Rel-15.
However, the triggering mechanism of aperiodic SRS limits its flexibility.
Further, antenna switching SRS only supports up to 4 antennas, which limits
the performance for use cases requiring larger than 4 receive antennas. In
addition, along with the expansion of 5G deployment, the demand to further
improve SRS capacity and coverage appears.
Fourth, although Rel-16 has enhanced the Rel-15 Type-II to allow improved
performance-overhead trade-off, CSI enhancements designed for mTRP non-
coherent JT and Type-II assuming FDD (angle-delay) reciprocity can be
beneficial to support additional deployment scenarios.
[Enhancements for multi-beam operation]{.underline}
In Rel-15/16, UL beam indication utilizes a different framework from DL beam
indication. As DL and UL beam indication share similar characteristics, a
unified TCI-based framework for DL and UL beam indication is introduced in
Rel-17 where UL TCI is used to represent UL spatial relation. Depending on
whether DL and UL share the same TCI (e.g. in relation to the beam
correspondence assumption supported by the UE), a UE can be configured with
either joint DL/UL TCI (where DL and UL share the same TCI state hence a
single TCI state update applies to both) or separate DL/UL TCI (which includes
the signalling of DL-only, UL-only, and DL+UL TCI state update).
Central to the Rel-17 TCI framework is the use of common beam for UE-dedicated
PDCCH and the associated PDSCH intended to streamline multi-beam operation.
While Rel-15/16 supports the use of common beam for UE-dedicated PDCCH and the
associated PDSCH, beam indication is performed via MAC-CE. The latency and
overhead associated with MAC-CE potentially detract the application of NR for
high-speed scenarios in the FR2 regime. In Rel-17, such latency and overhead
are reduced with the introduction of DCI-based beam indication using the
existing DCI formats 1_1/1_2 (with and without DL assignments) via the TCI
field. To ensure that the NW and the UE are aligned in terms of TCI state, an
ACK mechanism for the beam indication is supported either via the ACK
associated with the PDSCH (when beam indication is accompanied with DL
assignment) or an ACK mechanism analogous to that used for SPS PDSCH release
(when beam indication is not accompanied with DL assignment). When only one
TCI state is activated via MAC-CE, the DCI-based beam indication is not used.
In this case, beam indication is performed via MAC-CE.
The Rel-17 TCI framework also supports auxiliary features such as a common TCI
state ID update using a common TCI state pool and/or reference CC for Carrier
Aggregation, UL power control setting (including PL-RS) association with TCI
state, as well as inter-cell beam management. Inter-cell beam management
includes measurement and reporting of L1-RSRP as well as beam indication for
TCI states associated with PCIs different from that of the serving cell. In
addition, common beam operation can be configured to other signals such as
non-UE dedicated reception associated with serving cell PCI, aperiodic CSI-RS,
and aperiodic SRS.
To better support UEs equipped with multiple panels, UE reporting of the
capability associated with the maximum number of SRS ports and its
correspondence with CSI-RS or SSB resource indicators (CRI/SSB-RI) is
introduced. This reporting is performed in conjunction with the supported beam
reporting.
Due to adherence to the MPE (maximum permissible exposure) regulation, some UL
coverage penalty is incurred as the UE ends up using a sub-optimal UL transmit
beam. To alleviate this issue, some enhancement in the existing PHR report is
introduced where beam-specific P-MPR along with the associated CRI/SSBRI is
added into the MAC-CE-based PHR report.
[Enhancements for multi-TRP operation]{.underline}
In Rel-17, PDCCH repetition is defined by explicit linkage between two search
space sets. The two linked search space sets can be associated with
corresponding CORESETs with different TCI states, hence, achieving beam-
diversity for PDCCH transmission. In Rel-17, only intra-slot PDCCH repetition
is supported, and also, PDCCH repetition is only supported for USS or Type3
CSS. In addition, the linkage is specified at the PDCCH candidate level by
restricting configurations of two linked search space sets resulting in one-
to-one mapping between monitoring occasions and between PDCCH candidates of
the two linked search space sets. Two linked PDCCH candidates have the same
aggregation level, same coded bits, and the same DCI payload. To avoid
ambiguity at the UE, a reference PDCCH candidate is defined for various
procedures such as timelines, PUCCH resource determination, PDSCH reception
with mapping Type B or mapping Type A, determination of QCL assumption for
PDSCH when TCI field is not present in DCI, etc. UE can report whether two
blind decodes or three blind decodes are needed for two linked PDCCH
candidates. In the case of three blind decodes, overbooking for PDCCH is
enhanced accordingly. Furthermore, determination of two QCL-TypeD is specified
for FR2 to support time-overlapping PDCCH repetitions. PDCCH repetition is
supported also for cross-carrier scheduling through linking two search space
sets in both scheduling cell and scheduled cell.
In Rel-17, to support multi-TRP PUCCH repetition, up to two sets of power
control parameters in FR1 or up to two PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo in FR2 can be
activated per PUCCH resource or per PUCCH resource group via MAC-CE. In
addition, multi-TRP PUCCH repetition can be configured by intra-slot PUCCH
repetition as well as inter-slot PUCCH repetition for all PUCCH formats. Based
on the number of activated PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo or set of power control
parameters for the scheduled PUCCH resource, dynamic switching between single-
TRP PUCCH repetition and multi-TRP PUCCH repetition can be supported. Separate
power control for multi-TRP PUCCH repetition is supported by two activated
PUCCH-SpatialRelationInfo or two activated sets of power control parameters.
Furthermore, up to two TPC field for PUCCH can be supported and each TPC field
is applied for each closed loop index.
In Rel-17, multi-TRP PUSCH repetition is supported with up to two SRS resource
sets with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook'. If UE is provided by two
SRS resource sets with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook', the second
SRI field, second TPMI field (if CB-based PUSCH is supported), and second
PTRS-DMRS association field are indicated by DCI format 0_1 or 0_2 for PUSCH
transmission occasion(s) toward the TRP which is related to the second SRS
resource set with usage set to 'codebook' or 'nonCodebook' for dynamic grant
based PUSCH scheduling. In addition, the new DCI field is defined as 'SRS
resource set indicator' with 2 bits to support dynamic switching between
single-TRP PUSCH repetition (corresponding to codepoint '00' and '01') and
multi-TRP PUSCH repetition (corresponding to codepoint '10' and '11').
Separate power control for multi-TRP PUSCH repetition is supported by linking
between two SRI fields and two sets of power control parameters via higher
layer parameter. And also up to two TPC field for PUSCH can be supported and
each TPC field is applied for each closed loop index. Furthermore, the
aforementioned multi-TRP PUSCH repetition is also supported by configured
grant type 1 and 2.
In Rel-16, multi-TRP PDSCH transmission is supported with two different
mechanisms: single-DCI and multi-DCI. In Rel-17, multi-TRP PDSCH transmission
is further extended to inter-cell operation. A UE can be configured with SSB
associated with PCI which are different from serving cell PCI, known as
additional PCI. At most 7 different additional PCI can be configured to the
UE, and only one is activated for inter-cell multi-TRP operation. The
additional PCI can be associated with one or more TCI states, and gNB can
schedule PDSCH dynamically from either TRP by indicating TCI in DCI.
In Rel-17, beam reporting and BFR are enhanced for mTRP scenario specifically.
For beam reporting enhancement, framework of Rel-15 group based beam reporting
is extended to facilitate simultaneous transmission of multiple TRPs. To
achieve that, one CSI resource setting including two resource sets
corresponding to two TRPs can be configured. In a CSI-report, UE can report N
(Nmax = {1, 2, 3, 4}) groups of simultaneously received beams, wherein each
reported beam in one group corresponds to one TRP. Differential L1-RSRP
reporting across all beam groups is supported, and 1-bit is added to indicate
CMR set associated with the largest RSRP value in the first group. For BFR
enhancements, both single-DCI and multi-DCI framework are supported. For
multi-DCI, two explicit or implicit BFD-RS sets are introduced for two TRPs in
one CC. BFRQ can be transmitted if any one of BFD-RS sets fails. BFRQ
framework is enhanced based on Rel.16 SCell BFR. The maximum number of PUCCH-
SR resources is extended to 2. After UE receives gNB's response, per-TRP beam
reset can be performed. When both BFD-RS sets in SpCell fail, CBRA based RACH
transmission can be triggered. For single-DCI, only explicit BFD-RS set
configuration can be supported.
Rel-17 defines two key approaches for frequency offset compensation in HST-SFN
scenario: UE-based and TRP-based compensation schemes. For UE-based
compensation (scheme A), UE receives additional reference signals transmitted
by the TRPs in a non-SFN manner to facilitate more accurate frequency offset
compensation. The corresponding non-SFN TRS configurations are provided to the
UE by using two TCI states (containing reference to the TRS of two TRPs) using
DCI and MAC signalling. The TRP-based compensation (scheme B) relies on
frequency offset pre-compensation at the network side, where each TRP
estimates the downlink frequency by using uplink signal, e.g., SRS, and
compensates the downlink frequency per TRP prior to transmission. For TRP
based pre-compensation, UE also receives two TRS transmitted by the TRPs in a
non-SFN manner using two TCI states. However, since network pre-compensates
the PDCCH and PDSCH by the difference of the frequency offsets observed
between two TRPs, frequency offset tracking at the UE is performed using only
one TRS transmitted by the reference TRP.
[SRS enhancements]{.underline}
In NR Rel-15/16, aperiodic SRS is triggered by DCI to provide dynamic
indication of SRS transmission. However, only one triggering offset value can
be configured in RRC per SRS resource set. This limits the valid combinations
of the location to send the triggering DCI and the location to transmit SRS,
esp. considering TDD slot format, where not all slots are available to
transmit SRS. To address this issue, Rel-17 introduces SRS triggering offset
enhancement based on available slot definition. Up to 4 offset values can be
configured in RRC per SRS resource set, where each value is defined as the
number of available slots counting from a reference slot. Reference slot is
defined as the slot indicated by legacy triggering offset. In DCI format
0_1/0_2/1_1/1_2, one new field \"SRS offset indicator\" (SOI) is added to
select one available slot offset value from the configured ones. In addition,
Rel-15/16 DCI format 0_1/0_2 cannot be indicated to trigger SRS only, i.e.,
without CSI request and without data. This limitation is removed in Rel-17 by
allowing gNB to trigger SRS based on DCI format 0_1/0_2 without CSI request
and without data.
To ensure performance for uses case with larger than 4 receive antennas,
Rel-17 introduces antenna switching SRS to support 1T6R, 1T8R, 2T6R, 2T8R and
4T8R. In addition, to improve flexibility of antenna switching SRS, Rel-17
extends the P/SP configurations by supporting maximum 2 SP SRS resource sets
and maximum 1 periodic SRS resource set for antenna switching, and the
aperiodic configuration by supporting 1 or 4 aperiodic SRS resource sets for
1T4R and 2 aperiodic resource sets for 1T2R/2T4R.
In order to enhance the capacity and coverage for SRS, the following three
schemes are specified in Rel-17.
  * Increased repetition: Rel-17 supports 8, 10, 12 and 14 consecutive repetition symbols in one slot in one SRS resource.
  * Partial frequency sounding: Rel-17 supports to **_transmit SRS only in_ **$\frac{1}{P_{F}}m_{SRS,B_{\text{SRS}}}$**_contiguous RBs in one OFDM symbol, where_** $m_{SRS,B_{\text{SRS}}}$ **_indicates the number of RBs configured by B~SRS~ and C~SRS~. It can be applied on both frequency hopping case and non-frequency hopping case. The scaling factor P~F~ is configured by RRC per SRS resource, which can be 2 or 4. The start RB index_** of the $\frac{1}{P_{F}}m_{SRS,\ B_{\text{SRS}}}$ **RBs in the** $m_{SRS,\ B_{\text{SRS}}}$ **RBs is** $N_{\text{offset}} = \frac{\left( k_{F} + k_{\text{hopping}} \right)\text{\ mod\ }P_{F}}{P_{F}}m_{SRS,\ B_{\text{SRS}}}$ **, where k~F~ is configured by RRC with a value chosen from k~F~ = {0, 1, ..., P~F~-1}. k~hopping~ is same for all SRS occasions within a legacy FH period but can hop across legacy FH periods. When the hopping of k~hopping~ is not enabled, it** is fixed to be 0 for all SRS symbols. **When the hopping of k~hopping~ is enabled,** one hopping pattern is supported for each P~F~ value.
  * Comb 8: Rel-17 supports comb-8 for SRS other than for positioning, where the maximum number of cyclic shifts is 6.
[CSI for mTRP and FDD reciprocity]{.underline}
The Rel-17 eType-II port selection (PS) codebook assumes
$\mathbf{W}_{1}\mathbf{W}_{2}\mathbf{W}_{f}^{H}$codebook structure as Rell-16.
The key enhancement comes from exploiting angle-delay reciprocity in DL and UL
which is applicable for both TDD and FDD. By doing so, spatial domain and
frequency domain compression operation inherent in the Rel-16 eType-II PS
codebook can be shifted toward the gNB thereby reducing UE computational
burden. While the amplitude and phase per channel/ propagation path are
generally not DL and UL reciprocal, the gNB can employ angle-delay information
obtained from UL measurements to precode UE-specific CSI-RS. Therefore from
CSI measurement perspective at the UE, a subset of CSI-RS ports based on
beamformed CSI-RS resource are first selected by the UE and represented by
W_1, frequency domain compression is represented by Wf giving rise to up to
two selected DFT vectors, and lastly linear combination coefficients are
quantized in amplitude and phase by W2 with configurable compression factors
up to 1 by removing negligible coefficients.
Moreover, to improve CSI measurement accuracy over NCJT transmission in
Rel-16, Rel-17 NCJT CSI enhancement supports a joint channel measurement at
the UE by configuring a CMR pair within the same CSI-RS resource set
corresponding to two TRPs respectively. Therefore a CSI-RS resource set is
divided as two CMR groups so that each CMR pair consists of one CMR from Group
1 and one CMR from Group 2. From CSI reporting perspective, two modes are
supported, whereas Mode 1 is to report X (X=0,1,2) single-TRP CSI and one NCJT
CSI versus Mode 2 is to report one single-TRP or NCJT CSI. For the reporting
quantity of NCJT CSI (up to rank 4), the main differentiation from legacy
releases is that only single CQI/CRI is reported per CMR pair by jointly
considering the best companion PMI/RI from two CMRs simultaneously to mitigate
TRP interference. Also to use CSI-RS resources and configurations efficiently,
sharing mechanism can be enabled by the gNB to reuse a CMR pair (configured
for NCJT CSI measurement) for single-TRP CSI measurement if needed.

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated, Samsung in
RP-221178.
This WI builds on Rel-16 \"IAB for NR\", which introduced wireless backhauling
of F1 over NR to enable flexible and dense deployment of 5G cells while
reducing the need for wireline transport infrastructure.
The enhancements to IAB introduced in Rel-17 improve on various aspects over
Rel-16 IAB such as robustness, degree of load-balancing, spectral efficiency,
and backhaul performance.
The Rel-17 IAB enhancements support the following new functionality:
â€¢ Introduction of inter-donor migration of the IAB-MT to increase robustness
and allow for more refined load-balancing and topology management.
â€¢ Reduction of service interruption during IAB-node migration and BH RLF
recovery to improve network performance, allow the network deployment to
undergo more frequent topology changes, and provide more stable backhaul
performance.
â€¢ Enhancements to scheduling as well as flow and congestion control to improve
end-to-end performance as well as spectral efficiency to the IAB network.
â€¢ Duplexing enhancements to increase spectral efficiency and reduce latency
through the support of SDM/FDM-based resource management and through
simultaneous transmissions and/or reception on IAB-nodes.
With Rel-17 enhancements, IAB remains transparent to the UE. At the same time,
legacy UEs can benefit from the enhancement provided by Rel-17. The Rel-17 IAB
enhancements are further applicable to FR1 and FR2.
**[Inter-donor IAB-MT migration and connectivity]{.underline}**
_Inter-donor IAB-MT migration and recovery_
To enhance robustness and load balancing, Rel-17 IAB introduces the inter-
donor partial migration and RLF recovery. For inter-donor partial migration,
the IAB-MT performs handover or conditional handover to migrate from the
source IAB-donor to the target IAB-donor. For inter-donor RLF recovery, the
IAB-MT performs the RRC Reestablishment procedure at the target IAB-donor.
During these procedures, the IAB-MT obtains new IP addresses from the target
IAB-donor that are anchored at the target IAB-donor-DU to enable IP
connectivity via this target IAB-donor-DU. The F1 and non-F1 traffic of the
migrating IAB-node and its descendent nodes is then routed via a new BAP path
that uses the target IAB-donor-DU. The F1 connections, however, remain
terminated at the source IAB-donor. This traffic migration is facilitated via
coordination between source and target IAB-donors using the XnAP IAB Transport
Migration Management/Modification procedures introduced in Rel-17 for this
purpose. In these procedures, the source IAB-donor sends QoS information of
the traffic to be migrated to the target IAB-donor, so that the target IAB-
donor can establish the backhaul transport on RLC and BAP sublayers on the
target path. The target IAB-donor informs the source IAB-donor about all
layer-2 and IP information needed by the source IAB-donor to configure the
necessary end-to-end transport. The XnAP IAB Transport Migration
Management/Modification procedures are also used to allocate IP addresses for
descendent nodes, and to ensure proper QoS and connectivity support via the
target IAB-donor-DU over time, e.g., due to configuration or release of new
F1-U GTP-tunnels.
Rel-17 introduces the concept of the IAB-topology, which contains all IAB-
nodes and IAB-donor-DUs as well as all backhaul links that are controlled by
the same IAB-donor via RRC and/or F1AP. After inter-donor partial or RLF
recovery, all descendent node traffic has to pass through two IAB topologies
controlled by separate IAB-donors. The migrating IAB-node is referred to as
the boundary IAB-node since it is controlled by both IAB-donors and therefore
resides in both topologies.
The concept of the IAB-topology is necessary to coordinate the L2
configurations across an IAB-network controlled by two IAB-donors. Each IAB-
donor can independently use the full name space of BAP addresses, BAP path IDs
and BH RLC CH IDs for the transport in its own IAB topology. Descendent-node
traffic that travels across two IAB-topologies uses a separate BAP routing IDs
for each of these two topologies. At the boundary node, the BAP routing ID
used by a BAP PDU in one topology is rewritten to the BAP routing ID the BAP
PDU uses in the other topology. The BAP routing ID mapping is coordinated
between both IAB-donors during traffic migration.
Rel-17 enhancements also allow for the revocation of the traffic migration
caused by inter-donor partial migration. For this purpose, the target IAB-
donor conducts an Xn handover of the IAB-MT in reverse direction, i.e., back
to the former source IAB-donor. The source IAB-donor can request the
revocation of this traffic migration.
Source and target IAB-donors can further coordinate the use of radio resources
used on parent and child links via the XnAP IAB Resource Coordination
procedure introduced in Rel-17 for this purpose.
_Inter-donor topological redundancy_
For the enhancement of load balancing, Rel-17 IAB further introduces inter-
donor topological redundancy. For this purpose, the IAB-MT executes the NR DC
procedure to concurrently connect to two IAB-donors. The collocated IAB-DU can
establish F1 with either of these two IAB-donors. Inter-donor topological
redundancy also interconnects two IAB-topologies where the dual-connected IAB-
node assumes the role of the boundary node. F1 and non-F1 traffic of the dual-
connected IAB-node and its descendent nodes can be gradually migrated between
the two paths via either the MN's or the SN's IAB-donor-DU. The XnAP IAB
Transport Migration Management/Modification procedures are used for the
coordination between MN and SN IAB-donors for this traffic migration. The
boundary node applies BAP header rewriting for all traffic that passes through
both IAB-topologies. The MN and SN further coordinate the use of radio
resources used on the parent links and child links of the dual-connecting IAB-
node.
_CP-UP separation_
For the enhancement of robustness, Rel-17 IAB introduces CP-UP separation for
an IAB-node that is dual-connected with an IAB-donor and a gNB, which does not
assume IAB-donor role. In this case, the IAB-node's F1-C can be exchanged via
the backhaul with the IAB-donor or, alternatively, via the path containing the
access link between IAB-node and gNB and the Xn connection between gNB and
IAB-donor. For CP-UP separation, the gNB can either assume MN or SN role. In
the former case, SRB2 is used on the NR access link for the passing of F1-C
traffic, and split SRB in the latter case.
**[Reduction of service interruption]{.underline}**
_Intra-donor migration with parallel migration of descendent nodes_
For the reduction of service interruption during intra-donor IAB-node
migration, Rel-17 introduces enhancements to enable concurrent traffic
migration by the descendent nodes and the migrating IAB-node. For this
purpose, the IAB-donor sends the RRC Reconfiguration messages to the
descendent nodes prior to migration. It includes an indicator in the F1AP
Transfer message for the descendant's parent node to withhold the RRC message
from delivery until the migration has succeeded. When the migration succeeds,
all RRC messages withheld are released in a top-down sequence through the
tiers of the subtree. In this manner, all IAB-nodes affected can conduct the
migration of F1-C in a concurrent rather than sequential manner.
_Support of inter-donor-DU local re-routing_
For the reduction of packet loss due to link unavailability, Rel-17 introduces
inter-donor-DU local re-routing for UL traffic.
The NR dual-connected IAB-node can perform inter-donor-DU re-routing in case
its parent backhaul links connect to separate IAB-donor-DUs, but do not share
a single route to a common IAB-donor-DU. When one of the parent links is not
available, the IAB-node can re-route the UL traffic via the other parent link
to the alternative IAB-donor-DU. To ensure proper routing on the BAP sublayer,
the IAB-node rewrites the BAP header of these re-routed UL PDUs with a BAP
routing ID that contains the BAP address of this alternative IAB-donor-DU.
The alternative IAB-donor-DU can forward the traffic to the peer IAB-donor-DU,
which was the packet's original destination, via a statically configured GTP-U
tunnel. The alternative IAB-donor-DU selects a packet for tunneling by
matching the packet's source IP address with a IAB-donor-configured IP address
list. In case the alternative IAB-donor-DU and its peer belong to separate
IAB-donor-CUs, the IP address list is forwarded between the IAB-donors.
_Enhancements to BH RLF indications_
For the reduction of packet loss due to BH RLF, Rel-17 introduces the BH RLF
detection indication and the RLF recovery indication. In case an IAB-node
attempts RRC Reestablishment due to BH RLF, it can send the RLF detection
indication to each child node. If the child node has an alternative backhaul
path available, it can apply UL rerouting for upstream packets. If it has no
such alternative backhaul path, it can propagate the BH RLF detection
indication to the next tier. When the IAB-node has recovered from the BH RLF,
it can send the RLF recovery indication to each child node, which revokes all
behaviour triggered by the BH RLF detection indication before. The BH RLF
recovery indication is propagated in the same manner as the BH RLF detection
indication.
**[Performance enhancements in BH transport and scheduling]{.underline}**
_Enhancements to QoS_
For the improvement of UL QoS scheduling on the backhaul, Rel-17 introduces an
extension of the LCG space. The extended LCG space supports 256 instead of
just 8 LCGs. Extended LCGs can be signalled via new short and long BSR MAC
CEs. The extended LCGs can also be used for pre-emptive BSR.
_Enhancements to congestion mitigation_
For the improvement of congestion mitigation, Rel-17 introduces DL local re-
routing based on flow-control feedback on BAP sublayer as well as DL
congestion reporting to the IAB-donor-CU-CP.
The IAB-node can apply DL local re-routing for a BAP destination when the
congestion control feedback for this destination exceeds an IAB-donor-
configured threshold.
The IAB-DU can report congestion with child BH RLC channel granularity to the
IAB-donor-CU-CP. This allows the IAB-donor-CU-CP to apply congestion
mitigation measures such as the configuration of routing changes, topology
adaptation, or changes to the radio-resource configuration.
**[Enhancements in multiplexing]{.underline}**
The following enhancements to physical layer procedures have been made in
Rel-17 in the context of enhanced multiplexing:
FDM of IAB-MT and IAB-DU operation is enabled by extending the concept of
Hard, Soft and Unavailable IAB-DU symbol resources to Hard, Soft, and
Unavailable IAB-DU sets of RBs within a component carrier, provided through a
Rel-17 IAB-DU frequency domain resource configuration in addition to the
Rel-16 IAB-DU time domain resource configuration. The DCI 2_5 mechanism is
extended to support explicit release of Soft resources with RB set
granularity. Similarly, the rules for implicit determination of availability
of a Soft RB set are extended for FDM operation.
Interference mitigation is facilitated by the ability to exchange of semi-
static Rel-16 IAB-DU time domain resource configuration information and the
Rel-17 IAB-DU frequency domain resource configuration information among
neighbouring IAB-nodes and IAB-donors.
SDM of IAB-MT and IAB-DU operation is facilitated by the introduction of two
new timing alignment modes for IAB-MT transmit timing: Case 6 timing aligns
the IAB-MT transmit timing with the IAB-DU transmit timing, facilitating SDM
Tx at the IAB-node. Case 7 timing aligns the IAB-DU receive timing with the
IAB-MT receive timing, facilitating SDM Rx at the IAB-node.
The provision for over-the-air synchronization, introduced in Rel-16 to enable
an IAB-node to derive its IAB-DU Tx timing from the received DL signal by the
collocated IAB-MT, is updated to account for the newly introduced Case 6 and
Case 7 timing modes.
Simultaneous operation of the IAB-MT and the IAB-DU is further facilitated by
the ability of an IAB-node to indicate to a parent node a list of preferred
IAB-MT beams with the associated conditions under which such beam preference
applies, and by the ability of a parent node to indicate to the IAB-node a
list of restricted IAB-DU beams with the associated conditions under which
such beam restriction applies. Additionally, concurrent IAB-MT and IAB-DU
operation, is aided by the ability of the IAB-node to indicate to a parent
node a desired DL power adjustment and/or a desired IAB-MT Tx power spectral
density range, where each indication includes the associated conditions for
the desired adjustments.
Optimizations for dual-connectivity operation of an IAB-node are introduced by
supporting coordination of IAB-MT's TDD configuration to avoid conflicts from
the two parent nodes, by supporting the exchange of IAB-DU resource
configurations between parent nodes, by applying Rel-16 CA TDD prioritization
rules, and by supporting a per-child MT link Unavailable resource
configuration.
**[RF and RRM requirements]{.underline}**
RAN4 decided to adopt following update to RF and RRM requirements for IAB
enhancement:
RF perspective: the requirement applicability for simultaneous operation is
agreed to be included in specification with clarification that the different
declaration on transmission power in simultaneous transmission is allowed for
ACLR and Modulation quality. Timing error between IAB-DU and IAB-MT of the
same IAB-Node is also defined for transmission mode case 6.
RRM perspective: No impact is identified for RRM aspect to enable Rel-17 IAB
enhancement except update with applicability clarification that existing
transmit timing and timing adjust requirements of IAB-MTs apply when
transmission mode is set to \"case 1\".

Summary based on the input provided by China Telecom in RP-220564.
Coverage is one of the key factors that an operator considers when
commercializing cellular communication networks due to its direct impact on
service quality as well as CAPEX and OPEX. The Rel-17 study item 860036
\"Study on NR coverage enhancements\" evaluated the baseline performance and
identified the potential bottleneck channels for both FR1 and FR2 [1]. This
work item [2] specifies enhancements for PUSCH, PUCCH and Msg3 PUSCH,
including enhancements on PUSCH repetition Type A, TB processing over multiple
slots PUSCH, DMRS bundling for PUSCH/PUCCH, dynamic PUCCH repetition factor
indication and Type A PUSCH repetitions for Msg3.
The following key functionalities are introduced as part of the Work Item:
[Enhancements on PUSCH repetition Type A]{.underline}
For PUSCH repetition Type A, the maximum number of repetitions is increased up
to 32. The increased maximum number of repetitions is applicable to PUSCH
repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format 0_1 and DCI format 0_2 as well as
PUSCH repetition Type A with Type 1 and Type 2 configured grant. In addition,
PUSCH repetition Type A supports the repetitions counted based on available
slots, and the maximum of repetitions for counting based on available slots is
32. When the counting based on available slots is enabled, a UE follows the
2-step procedure to perform PUSCH transmissions: in the first step, the UE
determines available slots for K PUSCH repetitions; in the second step the UE
determines whether to drop each of the K PUSCH repetition or not according to
PUSCH dropping rules, where the PUSCH repetition is still counted in the K
repetitions even if it is dropped.
[TB processing over multiple slots PUSCH (TBoMS)]{.underline}
A single Transport Block (TB) using a resource allocated over multiple slots
is introduced for PUSCH except Msg3. A UE scheduled to perform a TBoMS
transmission, via either dynamic or configured grant (Type 2), uses the
resource allocated across multiple slots to calculate the transport block size
(TBS) for the transmission. Advantages of this approach as compared to single-
slot PUSCH operations are in the form of lower effective coding rate and/or
energy per resource element (EPRE) increase, both advantages leading to
coverage enhancement. A TBoMS transmission can be performed w/ or w/o
repetition, where a TBoMS transmission w/o repetition is referred to as single
TBoMS transmission. The number of slots allocated for TBoMS is counted based
on available slots. The UE transmits the TB across the slots determined as
available for the TBoMS transmission, applying the same symbol and PRBs
allocation in each slot, regardless of whether TBoMS is scheduled w/ or w/o
repetition. Collision handling rules of Type A PUSCH repetition apply for
TBoMS. TBS of a single TBoMS transmission is calculated using the resource in
all the slots allocated for the single TBoMS transmission. The maximum
supported TBS for TBoMS does not exceed legacy maximum supported TBS in
Rel-15/16, for the same number of layers. TBoMS supports the transmission of
only one layer and one code block. A single redundancy version (RV) is used
for the transmission of a single TBoMS, irrespective of the number of slots
allocated for a single TBoMS transmission, as per Figure 1. RV cycling is used
across repetitions of a single TBoMS, as per Figure 2 . Rate Matching (RM) for
TBoMS is performed per slot.

[DMRS bundling for PUSCH/PUCCH]{.underline}
DMRS bundling to enable improved channel estimation is introduced for PUSCH
repetition Type A scheduled by DCI format 0_1 or 0_2, for PUSCH repetition
Type A with configured grant, for PUSCH repetition Type B, for TB processing
over multiple slots PUSCH and for PUCCH repetitions of PUCCH formats 1, 3, and
4. A UE can report the maximum duration, in number of consecutives slots,
during which the UE is able to maintain power consistency and phase continuity
under certain tolerance level. With the duration of the nominal TDWs (Time
Domain Windows), not longer than the maximum duration, configured by gNB, one
or multiple nominal TDWs can be determined for PUSCH transmissions or PUCCH
repetitions. A nominal TDW consists of one or multiple actual TDWs. Events,
which cause power consistency and phase continuity not to be maintained across
PUSCH transmissions or PUCCH repetitions within the nominal TDW, are defined.
An actual TDW is terminated in case an event occurs. A new actual TDW is
created in response to semi-static events not triggered by DCI or MAC-CE.
Whether a new actual TDW is created in response to dynamic events triggered by
DCI is subject to UE capability. Frequency hopping and UL beam switching for
multi-TRP operation are regarded as semi-static events. The UE shall maintain
power consistency and phase continuity within an actual TDW across PUSCH
transmissions or PUCCH repetitions.
Inter-slot frequency hopping with DMRS bundling to enable improved channel
estimation within the same frequency hop is introduced for PUSCH repetition
Type A, PUSCH repetition Type B, TBoMS and PUCCH repetitions. With the
frequency hopping interval, N consecutive slots, configured by gNB, the UE
performs inter-slot frequency hopping every N consecutive slots for PUSCH
transmissions or PUCCH repetitions.
[Dynamic PUCCH repetition factor indication]{.underline}
Dynamic repetition factor indication is introduced for PUCCH. This feature
allows network to adjust PUCCH repetition factor in a flexible fashion based
on channel conditions and traffic load. The mechanism to support this feature
is an enhanced RRC configuration to configure different repetition factor per
PUCCH resource. With this configuration, network can use existing PRI (PUCCH
resource indicator) in DCI to point to a PUCCH resource where the associated
repetition factor will be applied to the PUCCH transmission. By pointing to a
different PUCCH resource via PRI, a different PUCCH repetition factor could
apply, which implements the dynamic PUCCH repetition factor indication.
[Type A PUSCH repetitions for Msg3]{.underline}
Up to 16 repetitions is introduced for a Msg3 PUSCH transmission scheduled by
RAR UL grant or DCI format 0_0 with CRC scrambled by TC-RNTI. This is
beneficial to enhance the coverage on both NUL and SUL. After carrier
selection and BWP selection during the RACH initialization procedure, a UE
requests repetition of Msg3 PUSCH scheduled by RAR UL grant via separate PRACH
resource when the RSRP of DL path-loss reference fulfils a configured
threshold. If requested by the UE, gNB decides whether or not to schedule
repetition of the Msg3 PUSCH transmission. If scheduled, the number of
repetitions N is indicated by the 2 MSBs of the MCS field in the RAR UL grant
or in the DCI format 0_0; and the MCS index used for the PUSCH transmission is
indicated by the 2 LSBs of the MCS field in the RAR UL grant or by the 3 LSBs
of the MCS field in the DCI format 0_0. The Msg3 PUSCH transmission is
performed over N slots, which is counted based on available slots. Only inter-
slot frequency hopping is supported if N>1 is indicated for the PUSCH
transmission.

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in RP-220544.
This work item defines RF requirements for NR repeaters. These repeaters are
network nodes designed to supplement/extend the coverage provided by base
stations by simply amplifying and forwarding the signals from the input port
without performing any other signal processing.
Repeater types: RF requirements for repeater types 1-C and 2-O are defined.
Repeater type 1-C covers the conducted requirements for FR1 while type 2-O
covers the radiated requirements for FR2. Other types of repeaters are not
covered in this Release.
Repeater classes: Different repeater classes were introduced to cover
different deployment scenarios and are differentiated for DL and UL as
follows:
DL classes:
  * Wide Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from Macro Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the ground equal to 35 m.
  * Medium Range repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from Micro Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the ground equal to 5 m.
  * Local Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from Pico Cell scenarios with a repeater to UE minimum distance along the ground equal to 2 m.
UL classes:
  * Wide Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from Macro Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.
  * Local Area repeaters are characterised by requirements derived from Pico Cell and/or Micro Cell scenarios.
Repeater Operating Bands: NR repeater is designed to operate in the operating
bands in FR1 and FR2-1 which are defined in TS 38.104. New bands added to
38.104 which are in these frequency ranges will automatically be applicable to
the repeaters also.
TDD Operation: NR repeaters specifications also cover operation in the TDD
bands. In these bands, the repeaters are assumed to be synchronized to the
base station in whose coverage they are deployed follow the UL/DL frame
configuration that the base station is using.

860143 **Core part: NR DSS** NR_DSS-Core R1 RP-211345 Ericsson
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-220464.
Dynamic spectrum sharing (DSS) provides a very useful migration path from LTE
to NR by allowing LTE and NR to share the same carrier. DSS was included
already in Rel-15 and further enhanced in Rel-16. As the number of NR devices
in a network increases it is important that sufficient scheduling capacity for
NR UEs on the shared carriers is ensured.
This is addressed by this WI, which introduces the support for cross-carrier
scheduling from SCell to PCell/PSCell.
When cross-carrier scheduling from an SCell to sPCell is configured:
\- PDCCH on that SCell can schedule sPCell's PDSCH and PUSCH,
\- PDCCH on the sPCell can schedule sPCell's PDSCH and PUSCH but cannot
schedule PDSCH and PUSCH on any other cell.
Only one SCell can be configured to be used for cross-carrier scheduling to
sPCell.
The maximum number of monitoring candidates and non-overlapping CCEs for PDCCH
monitoring (to schedule the sPCell) are split between the sPCell and the SCell
used for scheduling the sPCell. The split is indicated via an RRC configured
scaling factor.
Note: sPCell refers to 'Special Cell'. For Dual Connectivity operation the
term Special Cell refers to the PCell of the MCG or the PSCell of the SCG,
otherwise the term Special Cell refers to the PCell.

Power_Limit_CA_DC-Core R4 RP-212622 Qualcomm
Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm Incorporated, China Telecom in
RP-221589.
This work item enables a UE to indicate a capability to transmit a maximum
output power higher than what the power class for a UL CA or DC configuration
would have previously allowed. In particular, for a UE supporting PC3 (23 dBm)
in one band and PC2 (26 dBm) in another band, the carrier aggregation
configuration may have been specified for PC2 (26 dBm). In such an example,
the maximum composite power from both transmitters would be limited to 26 dBm.
With this newly introduced Increased MOP capability, the UE is allowed to
transmit at its maximum potential when simultaneously transmitting at maximum
power on each carrier, in other words, the maximum allowed power is increased
to 27.8 dBm for this example.
Higher maximum UE transmit power is nearly universally accepted as a desirable
feature for cellular radio systems to enable greater range, capacity, and cell
edge user throughput. This can be seen by the introduction of PC2 (26 dBm)
first in Rel-14 followed by PC1.5 (29 dBm) in Rel-16 along with the
proliferation of operator requests for specification support of CA and DC
combinations supporting these higher power classes. At the same time, UE
front-end architectures are evolving to include multiple transmit chains
capable of operating simultaneously in time. UL MIMO, UL CA, and transmit
diversity are some of the recent developments where dual PA configurations are
assumed in RAN4. It is therefore beneficial to introduce methods to unlock the
maximum transmit capability of multiple PA's across different bands
transmitting at the same time. This work item has enabled the possibility for
a UE supporting PC3 within an NR TDD or FDD band and supporting PC2 within a
second NR TDD band to signal a [HigherPowerLimitCADC] capability whereby the
maximum output power indicated by the power class of the CA or DC
configuration can be exceeded.
Using CA for illustration but without loss of generality to DC, this is
achieved by replacing the PPowerClass,CA term in the expression for the upper
and lower limits of the maximum configured output power. Specifically,
P~CMAX_L~ = MIN {10log~10~âˆ‘ MIN [ p~EMAX,c~/ (âˆ†t~C,c~),
p~PowerClass.c~/(MAX(mpr~c~Â·âˆ†mpr~c~, a-mpr~c~)Â·âˆ†t~C,c~ Â·âˆ†t~IB,c~Â·âˆ†t~RxSRS,c~)
, p~PowerClass,c~/pmpr~c~], P~EMAX,CA~, P~PowerClass,CA~-Î”P~PowerClass,\ CA~}
P~CMAX_H~ = MIN{10 log~10~ âˆ‘ p~EMAX,c~ , P~EMAX,CA~,
P~PowerClass,CA~-Î”P~PowerClass,\ CA~}
\- PPowerClass,CA is the maximum UE power specified in Table 6.2A.1.3-1
without taking into account the tolerance specified in the Table 6.2A.1.3-1;
If the UE indicates [HigherPowerLimitCADC] for an eligible CA configuration as
specified in Table 6.2A.1.3-1 and Î”PPowerClass, CA = 0, PPowerClass,CA is
replaced by 10 log10 âˆ‘ pPowerClass,c.
From these equations, it can be seen that both the lower limit PCMAX_L and the
upper limit PCMAX_H are increased by virtue of replacing the PPowerClass,CA
term which appears in both lower and upper limits. Raising the upper limit has
the effect of allowing the UE to increase its maximum aggregated configured
output power. On the other hand, also raising the lower limit has the effect
of ensuring that the UE will increase its maximum aggregated configured output
power. The agreement in the CR to raise both lower and upper limits somewhat
reduces the flexibility for the UE, but the UE has the freedom to not signal
the optional capability, increasing both limits facilitates testability of the
feature and imbues meaning to the signalled capability, provides assurance
that the UE can indeed raise its power when signalled, and reduces the
uncertainty to the base station by shrinking the difference between the upper
and lower limits.
The scope of this work for Rel-17 as reflected in the agreed CR's is limited
to specific PC2 + PC3 power configurations as indicated by the UE's reported
power class, by [powerClassPerBand], or by the default power class specified
in 38.101-1 for the band. The scope does not include greater than two PA's
since three PA and higher configurations are not considered in RAN4 Rel-17
specifications. This limitation in scope for Rel-17 then omits CA
configurations with both intra-band CA in one band and inter-band CA with
another band, for example.
Moreover, during the course of the work item, the impact of increasing MOP on
MSD, MPR and A-MPR, and SAR mechanisms was also studied by companies. It was
found that specification changes were not needed for any of these within the
context of this Rel-17 CR. Rather the existing specifications for MSD, MPR and
A-MPR, and SAR can still apply. Hence, these requirements have not been
adjusted.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSilicon in RP-220682.
This work item develops several enhancement aspects for UE RF FR1. New RF
requirements, corresponding new feature groups and functionalities are
introduced for the WI as follows:
\- Specification restrictions for SUL bands supporting UL MIMO are removed in
both RAN4 and RAN2 specs
\- In Rel-16, switching period between case 1 and case 2 was introduced to
enable enhancement on UL performance with 2Tx transmission on one UL carrier
for inter-band UL CA, SA SUL and inter-band EN-DC. UE capability on
uplinkTxSwithingPeriod is introduced as 35Î¼s, 140Î¼s and 210Î¼s (210Î¼s only for
inter-band UL CA and SA SUL). Meanwhile, UE DL interruption is allowed when
configured with difficult band combinations. In Rel-17, the feature is
extended to dynamic Tx switching between 2CC 2Tx-2Tx switching, 3CC 1Tx-2Tx
switching and 3CC 2Tx-2Tx switching. In addition, capability to indicate
whether UL-MIMO coherence is supported when dynamic Tx switching between 3CC
(within 2 bands) 1Tx-2Tx switching and 2CC or 3CC (within 2 bands) 2Tx-2Tx
switching are introduced.
\- RF Requirements for PC3 and PC2 intra-band UL contiguous CA with UL MIMO
are specified. During the study in Rel-17, it was agreed that no explicitly
indication of specific UE architectures in the spec, i.e. 23+23, 23+26, 26+26.
Also the conclusion is reached that MPR for 1T PC2 is applied for PC2 UL
contiguous CA w/o UL MIMO or TxD indication while MPR for 2T 23+23 is applied
for PC2 UL contiguous CA with UL MIMO and/or TxD indication.
\- RF Requirements for PC3 and PC2 intra-band non-contiguous UL CA are
specified, especially the MPR values are defined based on different UE
architectures (indicated via supporting dualPA-Architecture or not).
\- SCell dropping solution as a WI objective for preventing transmission power
dropping on the cell with lower priority for both FR1 and FR2 CA is also
discussed. As the solutions may have spec impact to other WGs, also there is
no consensus whether it should be considered as a solution to address the
potential in-field issue, the only possibility is to drop the discussion in
Rel-17. Meanwhile, there was some discussion on PCMAX,CA and PHRCA reporting,
similar to SCell dropping solution, no further discussion is considered in
Rel-17.

Summary based on the input provided by MediaTek inc., Intel Corporation in
RP-220752.
the 3 objectives of this WI are: 1) Pre-configured MG pattern(s), 2) Multiple
concurrent and independent MG patterns and 3) Network controlled small gap.
Corresponding network RRC signalling and measurement requirements are
specified in TS38.331 and TS38.133, respectively.
1) Pre-configured MG pattern(s)
\- Introduced 2 activation/de-activation mechanisms and corresponding UE
capabilities to support these two mechanism: Network controlled mechanism, in
which UE follows the 1-bit per-BWP indications in active servings cell and
1-bit indication in deactivated serving cells to decide the ON/OFF status of
the pre-configured MG; UE autonomous mechanism, in which UE follows the
defined rules in TS38.133 to decide the ON/OFF status of the pre-configured
MG. If MG is not needed for all measurements, the pre-configured gap should be
deactivated (OFF) ; Otherwise, activated (ON). Events that may trigger UE to
re-check the ON/OFF status includes: [DCI/Timer based BWP switching,
activation/de-activation of SCell(s), addition/removal of any measurement
object(s), addition/release/change of a SCell under CA, BWP switching by RRC,
initiation of LocationMeasurementIndication];
\- Introduced additional delay for pre-configured MG activation/deactivation
which is 5ms on top on the legacy procedure delay that may trigger pre-
configured MG status change;
\- Updated the corresponding UE requirements regarding gap interruption,
measurement delay and L1 measurement impact.
2) Multiple concurrent and independent MG patterns
\- Introduced multiple gap configurations and corresponding UE capability
\- Introduced a mandatory association between gap and dedicated use cases
(e.g. PRS, SSB, CSI-RS, EUTRA) by indicting a gap ID in the measurement
objective or MG configuration (for PRS only). So that UE's measurement
behaviour is well-defined, because UE is only required to perform the
measurement associated to the gap during that gap occasion.
\- Introduced the maximum supported concurrent gap patterns for per-FR gap
incapable/capable UEs. For per-FR gap incapable UE, up to 2 concurrent gap
patterns can be configured. For per-FR gap capable UE, up to 3 concurrent gap
patterns can be configured, which up to 2 gaps in one FR.
\- Introduced a definition for the proximity condition of colliding gap
occasions. Upon colliding, UE drops the gap with a lower priority level which
is configured by network. Data scheduling is resumed on dropped gap occasion.
\- Updated the corresponding UE requirements regarding gap interruption,
measurement delay and L1 measurement impact.
3) Network controlled small gap (NCSG)
\- Introduced a UE capability reporting based on RRCReconfigurationComplete
and RRCResumeComplete messages (similar to NeedforGap). So that UE can report
whether to support 'no-gap-no-interruption', 'ncsg' or 'gap' for each target
band to be measured based on UE's current CA configuration.
\- Introduced 24 NCSG patterns with visible interruption (VIL1 and VIL2, which
are 1ms for FR1 and 0.75ms for FR2) before and after the measurement length
(ML). UE is expected to continue DL reception or UL transmission with serving
cells during ML. A new MG timing advance 0.75ms was introduced
correspondingly.
{width="5.311805555555556in" height="1.1680555555555556in"}
Figure 1: 24 NCSG patterns with visible interruption
\- Introduced the UE behaviours for the cases when UE reports different
capabilities on 'no-gap-no-interruption', 'ncsg' or 'gap' but with a different
a network configuration (NCSG or legacy MG) which may not perfectly match UE's
reported capability.
\- Introduced a new synchronization indication between the target NR band to
be measured and a reference serving cell of UE to reduce the OFDM symbols
restricted from data scheduling, when UE is incapable for simultaneous Tx/Rx
or independent beamforming (FR2-specific).
\- Introduced the corresponding UE requirements regarding gap interruption,
scheduling restriction and measurement delay. Update the impact to L1
measurements.

UE requirements for transmission diversity with 2 antenna connectors were
defined. Up to Rel-16 specification did not recognise a UE that needed power
measured from two connectors to fulfil the power class.
The following aspects have been covered:
\- Requirements for UE implementation with two antenna connectors active when
it is configured for one logical antenna port for PC2 and PC1.5.
\- Requirements for UE with tx diversity for SRS antenna switching were
clarified
\- Fallback DCI requirements with one logical port when UE supports ULFPTx,
part of Rel-16 eMIMO WI. A UE indicating the feature ul-FullPwrMode-r16 or ul-
FullPwrMode2-TPMIGroup-r16 for a band shall meet the 1Tx MOP requirement for
at least one antenna connector
\- Capability for UE to indicate if it implements tx diversity

This WI defines the RRM requirements for the following UE features: SRS
antenna port switching, HO with PSCell and PUCCH SCell
activation/deactivation. The RRM requirements were missing for the above UE
features in the TS38.133/TS36.133 before this WI, and the corresponding
delay/interruption requirements have been specified in this WI to verify
corresponding UE behaviour.
**[SRS antenna port switching]{.underline}**
RAN4 has specified interruption requirement for SRS antenna port switching as
well as the impact to other existing RRM requirements:
\- Interruption requirements were defined for two scenarios: when X=1 SRS
symbol is configured in a slot for SRS antenna port switching, the configured
number of SRS symbols is used as SRS transmission time; and otherwise, using
X=6 SRS symbols in a slot as assumption of SRS transmission time
\- RAN4 specified: Interruption requirement (symbol-level) for scenario 1 sync
case; Interruption requirement (slot-level) for scenario 1 async case; and
Interruption requirement (slot-level) for scenario 2
**[Handover with PSCell]{.underline}**
RAN4 has specified delay requirement of HO with PSCell for following
scenarios:
\- Handover with PSCell from NR SA to EN-DC
\- Handover with PSCell from EN-DC to EN-DC
\- Handover with PSCell from NR-DC to NR-DC (requirements in this release only
applies to FR1+FR2 NR-DC)
\- Handover with PSCell from NE-DC to NE-DC (requirements in this release only
applies to NE-DC with FR1 PCell)
**[PUCCH SCell activation/deactivation]{.underline}**
RAN4 has specified delay requirements as well as interruption requirements for
PUCCH Scell activation/deactivation:
\- PUCCH Scell activation delay requirements
\- PUCCH SCell activation delay requirements with multiple DL Scells
\- PUCCH Scell deactivation delay requirements
\- PUCCH SCell deactivation delay requirements with multiple DL Scells
\- Interruption requirements on LTE and NR CCs due to PUCCH SCell
activation/deactivation
\- No PUCCH Scell requirements (including interruption requirements and delay
requirements) for NR-DC.

Summary based on the input provided by China Telecom in RP-221286, covering
RAN2 (Core part), RAN4 (Perf. part).
This work item introduced several Rel-17 enhancements for UE and BS
demodulation requirements [1]. New UE/BS demodulation requirements, and the
corresponding new features and/or network assistant signalling for UE side
enhancement are introduced in the WI.
The different enhancements are:
  1. PDSCH demodulation and CQI reporting requirements of MMSE-IRC receiver for suppressing inter-cell interference in FR1 with slot-based transmission and aligned SCS among cells scenario [2]. The interference covariance estimation for MMSE-IRC is based on the serving UE's PDSCH DMRS and serving cell's CSI-RS for PDSCH demodulation and CQI reporting respectively.
  2. PDSCH demodulation requirements of MMSE-IRC receiver for suppressing intra-cell inter-user interference in FR1 with slot-based transmission and aligned SCS among cells scenario [3]. DMRS based interference covariance estimation for MMSE-IRC is assumed for PDSCH demodulation.
For the two points above, one UE feature without capability signalling is
introduced for MMSE-IRC receiver in scenarios with both inter-cell and intra-
cell inter-user interference. The requirements defined in objective #1 and #2
are release independent from Rel-15, optional for Rel-15 and Rel-16 UE, and
mandatory for Rel-17 UE.
> 3\. NR PDSCH demodulation requirements for neighbouring cell LTE CRS-IM in
> scenarios with overlapping spectrum for LTE and NR [4]. Two scenarios are
> covered, including: 1) scenario 1 with DSS scenario, where serving and
> neighbouring cells are both operating with DSS of NR and LTE, and the NR UE
> is suffering interference from the LTE CRS of neighbouring cells, and 2)
> scenario 2 with non-DSS scenario, where serving cell is operating in NR,
> neighbouring cells are operating in LTE, and the NR UE in the serving cell
> is suffering interference from the LTE CRS of neighbouring cells.
LLR weighting is used as the baseline reference receiver for CRS-IM.
Synchronous network scenario is targeted. 15kHz NR SCS is covered in scenario
1, and 15 kHz and 30 kHz NR SCS is covered in scenario 2.
Based on RAN4 LSs in [5] and [6], the RAN2 CRs on UE capability signalling are
endorsed in [7] [8], and the RAN2 CR on network assistant signalling is agreed
in [9].
For points 2 and 3 above, the Phase I performance evaluation outcomes are
captured in TR 38.833 [10].
> 4\. PUSCH demodulation requirements for FR1 256QAM [11 - 13]. 1-layer PUSCH
> transmission with MCS 20 and under low mobility of TDLA30-10 channel is
> agreed and used for the requirement definition.

900167 **Introduction of bandwidth combination set 4 (BCS4) for NR**
NR_BCS4-Core R4 RP-202832 Ericsson
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in RP-222107.
The purpose of BCS4 (Bandwidth Combination Set 4) for inter-band and intra-
band NR-CA was for band combinations to indicate that all the possible defined
bandwidths for each band in that band combination are supported.
It was in the scope of the WI to ensure that all required analysis including
MSD, MPR/A-MPR, etc. be performed for BCS4 for every existing band combination
configuration (up to 3 bands). Also, in the scope of the WI was to study and
define the most suitable UE capabilities signalling methods to enable BCS4
support.
The technical work on introduction on BCS4 started from RAN#90-e Dec. 2020
[1].
In the study for possible new signalling, it was decided that BCS4 was to be
introduced without signalling so that these band combinations can be
introduced in a release independent manner. A new BCS5 were added to be used
with signalling. It was decided that BCS4 and BCS5 need to be requested and
introduced simultaneously.
For BCS5 supportedMinBandwidthDL-r17 signalling were introduced that indicates
minimum DL channel bandwidth supported for a given SCS that UE supports within
a single CC (and in case of intra-frequency DAPS handover for the source and
target cells), which is defined in Table 5.3.5-1 in TS 38.101-1 for FR1 and
Table 5.3.5-1 in TS 38.101-2 for FR2. This parameter is only applicable to the
Bandwidth Combination Set 5. This field does not restrict the bandwidths
configured for a single CC (i.e. non-CA case).
The MSD tables were rewritten to a more generic template to support
accommodation of BCS4/BCS5 band combination requests more easily. For these
requests, the MSD template reduces RAN4 workload, simplifies TS 38.101-1
maintenance, ensures that MSD tables due to harmonic interference and cross-
band isolation interference are consistent with the template adopted for MSD
due to dual-uplink intermodulation interference, and by doing so, it reduces
the size and complexity of these MSD tables.
To introduce BCS4/BCS5 into the 3GPP core part specifications, RAN2 and RAN4
agreed the necessary changes in the corresponding CRs below.

Summary based on the input provided by ZTE Corporation in RP-220165.
Note: Although Studies are usually not reported in this document, it was
estimated by the rapporteur that this study deserves a summary.
5G NR have much more complex band combination configurations than previous
generations, due to the number of bands, multiple numerologies, larger channel
bandwidth, size of channel bandwidth set, etc.
RAN4 specifications have been reorganized with the scope of this Work Item, as
to provide a clearer view of all specified combinations. This CA/DC band
combination related rule collections will help within and outside 3GPP.
This SI covers:
\- Capture of the workflow on introduction of band combinations for block
approval and introduce new template of band combination request sheets for
basket WIs as to reduce the workload of the basket WI rapporteur.
\- Indication of the rules for band combinations not valid or not for block
approval.
\- Collect agreements on the rules of specifying band combinations, and
facilitate people's understanding of the complex notations of CA/DC
combinations. This includes:
â€¢ Rules of: CA/DC combination denotation; grouping EN-DC, NE-DC and NR-DC
configurations.
â€¢ Guidelines on: the band edge relaxation for MOP; introduction of PC2
combinations; introduction of band combinations with intra-band ULCA in UL
configuration.
\- Study optimization rules for Rel-17 band combinations and provide further
possible optimization in Rel-18, such as:
â€¢ Removal of the redundant SCS information for inter-band CA configuration
tables in Rel-17.
â€¢ Optimization of FR2 intra-band no-contiguous CA configuration table in
Rel-17 with no sub-block column explicitly shown.
â€¢ Optimization proposal of Î”TIB,c and Î”RIB,c tables for band combinations. A
mix of rule-based and table-based approach is proposed in Rel-18.
â€¢ Further optimization on the new template for NR inter-band CA and SUL
configuration tables in Rel-18.

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in RP-222478.
This WID extends NR operation to 71GHz with the introduction of new unlicensed
band n263. Relevant system parameters have been updated to consider the new
sub-frequency range FR2-2, larger subcarrier spacings and channel bandwidths.
This NR extension includes definition of n263 requirements for various form-
factors (PC1, PC2, PC3), for both single carrier and CA operation.
**[Introduction]{.underline}**
NR Rel-15 defined two frequency ranges for operation: FR1 spanning from 410
MHz to 7.125 GHz and FR2 spanning from 24.25 GHz to 52.6 GHz.
RAN carried out a Rel-16 study on NR beyond 52.6 GHz (FS_NR_beyond_52GHz) with
corresponding TR in 38.807. From this study, it became apparent the global
availability of bands in the 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz range, most notably in the
form of the original 60 GHz band (57-66 GHz) and extended 60 GHz band (57-71
GHz). Moreover, WRC19 recently identified the 66-71 GHz frequency range for
IMT operation in certain regions.
The proximity of this frequency range (57-71 GHz) to FR2 and the imminent
commercial opportunities for high data rate communications makes it compelling
for 3GPP to address NR operation in this frequency regime.
To minimize the specification burden and maximize the leverage of FR2 based
implementations, 3GPP has decided to extend FR2 operation up to 71 GHz with
the adoption of one or more new numerologies (i.e., larger subcarrier
spacings). Those new numerologies were identified in the study on waveform for
NR>52.6 GHz in the first half of 2020. NR-U defined procedures for operation
in unlicensed spectrum were also leveraged towards operation in the unlicensed
60 GHz band.
RAN1 completed a Rel-17 study on supporting NR from 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz.
Subcarrier spacing (SCS) of 120 kHz with NCP was recommended to be supported.
New subcarrier spacings 480 kHz, and 960 kHz along with 120 kHz were
introduced for this frequency range. The spec impact for each subcarrier
spacing choice was identified. Additional areas for further physical layer
enhancements were also identified. For channel access, both LBT mode and no-
LBT mode were recommended to be supported to cover a wide range of use cases
and regulatory requirements. For LBT mode, the channel access mechanism
defined in EN 302 567 was identified as the baseline and enhancements were
chosen for further discussion.
The objectives of this work item are presented below.
_Physical layer aspects including [RAN1]_
In addition to 120 kHz SCS, specify new SCS, 480 kHz and 960 kHz, and define
maximum bandwidth(s), for operation in this frequency range for data and
control channels and reference signals, only NCP supported. Note: Except for
timing line related aspects, a common design framework shall be adopted for
480 kHz to 960 kHz
Timeline related aspects adapted to 480 kHz and 960 kHz, e.g., BWP and beam
switching timing, HARQ timing, UE processing, preparation and computation
timelines for PDSCH, PUSCH/SRS and CSI, respectively.
Support of up to 64 SSB beams for licensed and unlicensed operation in this
frequency range.
Supports 120 kHz SCS for SSB and 120 kHz SCS for initial access related
signals/channels in an initial BWP. Study and specify, if needed, additional
SCS (480 kHz, 960 kHz) for SSB for cases other than initial access. Note:
coverage enhancement for SSB is not pursued.
In addition to 120 kHz, support 480 kHz SSB for initial access with support of
CORESET#0/Type0-PDCCH configuration in the MIB with following constraints:
  * Limited sync raster entry numbers. It is assumed that RAN4 supports a channelization design which results in the total number of synchronization raster entries considering both licensed and unlicensed operation in a 52.6 -- 71 GHz band no larger than 665 (Note: the total number of synchronization raster entries in FR2 for band n259 + n257 is 599). If the assumption cannot be satisfied, it's up to RAN4 to decide its applicability to bands in 52.6 -- 71 GHz.
  * only 480 kHz CORESET#0/Type0-PDCCH SCS supported for 480 kHz SSB SCS.
  * Prioritize support SSB-CORESET#0 multiplexing pattern 1. Other patterns discussed on a best effort basis.
  * 960 kHz numerology for the SSB is not supported by the UE for initial access in Rel-17.
  * Note: Strive to minimize specification impact by reusing tables for CORESET#0 and type0-PDCCH CSS set configuration defined for FR2 in Rel-15, as much as possible
  * Note: 480 kHz is an optional SSB numerology for initial access for the UE. A UE supporting a band in 52.6-71 GHz must at least support 120 kHz SCS (for initial access and after initial access)
  * Note: Dependency or lack thereof for a UE supporting 480 kHz and/or 960 kHz numerology for data and control to also support 480 kHz SSB numerology for initial access is to be tackled as part of UE capability discussion.
Support ANR and PCI confusion detection for 120, 480 and 960 kHz SCS based
SSB, support CORESET#0/Type0-PDCCH configuration in MIB of 120, 480 and 960
kHz SSB
  * FFS: additional method(s) to enable support to obtain neighbour cell SIB1 contents related to CGI reporting
  * Only 1 CORESET#0/Type0-PDCCH SCS supported for each SSB SCS, i.e., (120, 120), (480, 480) and (960, 960).
  * Prioritize support SSB-CORESET#0 multiplexing pattern 1. Other patterns discussed on a best effort basis.
  * Note: Strive to minimize specification impact by reusing tables for CORESET#0 and type0-PDCCH CSS set configuration defined for FR2 in Rel-15, as much as possible
  * Note: From UE perspective, ANR detection for 480/960 kHz SCS based SSB is not supported if the UE does not support 480/960 SCS for SSB.
  * Note: for ANR, when reading the MIB, the cell containing the SSB is known to the UE, as defined in 38.133 specification.
Specify timing associated with beam-based operation to new SCS (i.e., 480 kHz
and/or 960 kHz), study, and specify if needed, potential enhancement for
shared spectrum operation: Rel-15/16 and any Rel-17 beam management
enhancements can be considered for 52.6-71 GHz. Whether particular features
should be excluded for 52.6-71 GHz can be further discussed. Note: As per
usual procedure, duplication of work between work items in Rel-17 should be
avoided
Support enhancement for PUCCH format 0/1/4 to increase the number of RBs under
PSD limitation in shared spectrum operation.
Support enhancements for multi-PDSCH/PUSCH scheduling and HARQ support with a
single DCI. Note: coverage enhancement for multi-PDSCH/PUSCH scheduling is not
pursued
Support enhancement to PDCCH monitoring, including blind detection/CCE budget,
and multi-slot span monitoring, potential limitation to UE PDCCH configuration
and capability related to PDCCH monitoring.
Specify support for PRACH sequence lengths (i.e., L=139, L=571 and L=1151) and
study, if needed, specify support for RO configuration for non-consecutive
RACH occasions (RO) in time domain for operation in shared spectrum
Evaluate, and if needed, specify the PTRS enhancement for 120 kHz SCS, 480 kHz
SCS and/or 960 kHz SCS, as well as DMRS enhancement for 480 kHz SCS and/or 960
kHz SCS.
_Physical layer procedure(s) including [RAN1]_
Channel access mechanism assuming beam-based operation in order to comply with
the regulatory requirements applicable to unlicensed spectrum for frequencies
between 52.6 GHz and 71 GHz.
  * Specify both LBT and No-LBT related procedures, and for No-LBT case no additional sensing mechanism is specified.
  * Study, and if needed specify, omni-directional LBT, directional LBT and receiver assistance in channel access
  * Study, and if needed specify, energy detection threshold enhancement
_Radio interface protocol architecture and procedures [RAN2]:_
For operation in this frequency range: Introduce higher layer support of
enhancements listed above that are agreed to be specified. Note: RAN2 is to
prioritize protocol support of RAN1 design and not on optimizations on items
not discussed in RAN1.
_Core specifications for UE, gNB and RRM requirements [RAN4]:_
Specify new band(s) for the frequency range from 52.6 GHz-71 GHz. The band(s)
definition should include UL/DL operation and excludes ITS spectrum in this
frequency range.
Specify gNB and UE RF core requirements for the band(s) in the above frequency
range, including a limited set of example band combinations (see Note 1). For
the case of FR2-2 DC or CA with an anchor in FR1 the following three example
band combinations shall be considered: n79 + Nx ; n77 + Nx and n41 + Nx ,
where Nx is the 57-71 GHz band for unlicensed operation and the [66-71] GHz
for licensed operation. RAN4 to further discuss the need for single or
multiple bands relevant for FR2-2 licensed/unlicensed operation.
Specify RRM/RLM/BM core requirements. Notes: The WI can be completed provided
requirements for at least one band combination involving a new NR-U band is
specified as long as it is in line with country-specific regulatory
directives. UEs supporting a band in the range of 52.6 GHz-71 GHz are not
required to support 480 kHz SCS and 960 kHz SCS. The maximum FFT size required
to operate the system in 52.6 GHz-71 GHz frequency is 4096, and the maximum of
RBs per carrier is 275 RBs. The system is designed to support both single-
carrier and multi-carrier operation. FR2 is extended to cover 24.25 GHz to 71
GHz with FR2-1 for 24.25-52.6 GHz and FR2-2 for 52.6-71 GHz.
_The related UE capabilities and their applicability to the frequency range
52.6 to 71 GHz will have to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis_
_The application of any of the UE feature introduced for 52.6-71 GHz to
existing FR1/FR2 should be discussed case by case._
TSG RAN specifications shall make it very clear (to readers) that frequency
bands in the 52.6-71 GHz range are only Release-independent from Rel-17
onwards, to ensure that there is clear industry understanding about which FR2
features are applicable for operation in 52.6-71 GHz range. Notes: Whenever
the FR2 is referred, both FR2-1 and FR2-2 frequency sub-ranges shall be
considered in this release, unless otherwise stated. The designations FR2-1
and FR2-2 should only be used when needed.
**[Description]{.underline}**
Similar to regular NR and NR-U operations below 52.6 GHz, NR/NR-U operation in
the 52.6 GHz to 71 GHz can be in stand-alone or aggregated via CA or DC with
an anchor carrier.
_[Physical Layer enhancements]{.underline}_
In addition to 120 kHz SCS already supported in FR2-1, new SCSs of 480 kHz and
960 kHz are introduced, that can support wider bandwidth up to 2 GHz. For
operation in FR2-2, SCSs 480 kHz and 960 kHz are optionally supported by UE,
while SCS 120 kHz is mandatory.
[Initial access aspects]{.underline}
SSB of SCS 120 kHz, 480 kHz and 960 kHz are supported in FR2-2, and SCS 120
kHz and 480 kHz SSBs can support initial access. Up to 64 SSB candidate
positions are allowed for FR2-2 and Discovery Burst Transmission Window (DBTW)
is supported with ssb-PositionQCL being 32 or 64.
CORESET#0/Type0-PDCCH SCS is always the same as SSB SCS. SSB-CORESET#0
multiplexing pattern 1 and pattern 3 are supported for FR2-2.
Time locations for SCS 120 kHz SSB in FR2-1 are reused for FR2-2. Time
locations for SCS 480 kHz and SCS 960 kHz SSBs are newly defined.
For PRACH, length 139 sequence is supported for all SCS, length 571 sequence
is supported for SCSs 120 kHz and 480 kHz, and length 1151 sequence is
supported for SCS 120 kHz.
[PDCCH monitoring enhancements]{.underline}
For SCS 480 kHz and 960 kHz, since slots are short, and UE power consumption
to monitor PDCCH in each slot will be high, multi-slot PDCCH monitoring
capability is introduced where UE monitors PDCCH in Y slots out of every X
slots.
[Enhancements for PUCCH formats 0/1/4]{.underline}
To support higher transmit power under PSD limitation for PUCCH formats 0/1/4,
enhanced PUCCH formats 0/1/4 are supported such that the number of RBs can be
RRC configured from 1 to 16. For PUCCH format 0/1, type-1 long sequence
occupying all REs over the configured number of RBs is used. For PUCCH format
4, OCC 2 or 4 is supported, and the number of RBs is restricted to in the form
of N_RB=2\^(Î±_2 )âˆ™3\^(Î±_3 )âˆ™5\^(Î±_5 ).
[Beam managements for new SCSs]{.underline}
Beam switching related timing values for SCS 480 kHz and 960 kHz are defined.
[PDSCH/PUSCH enhancements]{.underline}
Multi-PDSCH scheduling with a single DCI and multi-PUSCH scheduling with a
single DCI are supported, where the time domain allocations of the multiple
PDSCH or multiple PUSCH can be discontinuous. Time domain HARQ-ACK bundling is
supported for both Type 1 HARQ codebook and Type 2 HARQ codebook.
Processing timelines for 480 kHz and 960 kHz SCS are defined, such as HARQ
timeline, UE processing timeline, etc. DMRS enhancements for 480 kHz and 960
kHz are introduced that allows the indication to the UE that FD OCC is
disabled for rank 1 transmission. The maximum number of HARQ processes
supported for FR2-2 are increased to 32 in both DL and UL.
[Channel access mechanism]{.underline}
In frequency range 2-2, Rel-17 NR supports licensed spectrum operation (Draft
CRs for FR2-2 licensed band n264 were endorsed, but won't be agreed until the
regulation is available in at least one country or region), shared spectrum
operation with LBT and shared spectrum operation without LBT. gNB will
indicate UE if LBT is used for channel access by higher layer signalling.
When LBT mode is enabled, a maximum channel occupancy time (COT) of 5ms is
supported. COT sharing from gNB to UE and UE to gNB are supported, similar to
Release 16 NR-U.
For channel access for LBT mode, 3 types of channel access are defined
Type 1 channel access can be performed by gNB or UE to initiate a channel
occupancy. Type 1 channel access involves sensing the channel multiple times
with a counter with maximum contention window size 3.
Type 2 channel access requires a single sensing slot channel sensing and can
be used to share a COT.
Type 3 channel access does not require channel sensing and can be used to
share a COT, or to initiate Discovery RS transmission when regulation allows.
The directional LBT is defined for gNB and UE with or without beam
correspondence. The bandwidth on which LBT is performed by gNB/UE should at
least include active DL/UL BWP bandwidth.
_[MAC Enhancements]{.underline}_
Rel-16 NR-U has introduced several enhancements to MAC procedures to alleviate
the impact of LBT mechanism which can cause delays or dropped transmissions.
The following were also adopted for FR2-2: Consistent LBT failure detection
and recovery; Configured Grant (CG) changes; Changes to RACH procedures (e.g.,
extended RAR window duration) and HARQ handling for uplink multi-TTI
transmissions.
Consistent LBT failure detection and recovery is applicable to FR2-2 with no
changes, assuming LBT is configured on the considered serving cell.
The changes to configured grant transmission in Rel-16 NR-U were mainly due to
autonomous retransmission on CG resources, autonomous HARQ process ID. and RV
selection. A new CG retransmission timer was introduced where the UE is
allowed to retransmit a packet on a CG after this timer expires without any
ACK from the gNB for the earlier transmission. The only change for FR2-2 is
that this timer is now optional and configured by RRC. Thus, when the timer is
configured, the UE follows Rel-16 NR-U procedures while it uses the licensed
spectrum procedures otherwise.
For FR2-2, extended values were introduced for several DRX parameters due to
the shorter symbol duration for SCS of 480 and 960 kHz.
_[Upper Layer Enhancements]{.underline}_
The support of RSSI and Channel Occupancy (CO) measurements was also carried
over to FR2-2. For FR2-2, the configuration can also include bandwidth serving
cell and TCI information for the RSSI measurement.
The enhancements to Idle/Inactive mode mobility (due to the possible existence
of multiple independent operators on the same carrier) and paging (multiple
paging monitoring occasions per PO) for NR-U are also re-used in FR2-2.
We note that Channel Access Priority Class (CAPC) which is used for QoS in
NR-U as well as LTE LAA are not applicable to FR2-2.
Since LBT is optional for FR2-2, a new parameter is broadcast in SIB1 to
indicate the LBT mode. The same information for neighbor cells can be included
in measurement object for RRM and SIB3/SIB4 for Idle/Inactive mobility (RAN2
is still discussing this).
Many RRC parameters with values dependent on symbol duration or bandwidth were
enhanced to support the new SCS and bandwidths.
The legacy UE capabilities which had FR1/FR2 differentiation in Rel-15/16
required, in some cases, further differentiation between legacy FR2 and FR2-2.
These capabilities also included some upper layer capabilities such as IMS
voice, Rel-16 Power Saving, and Rel-16 DCCA. For the new UE capabilities which
needed FR2-2 differentiation, per-band signaling was adopted with consistent
signaling across the FR2 bands.
New signaling and procedures were also introduced in LTE specifications to
support handover from E-UTRAN to NR FR2-2.
_[System parameters]{.underline}_
[Spectrum and operating band]{.underline}
FR2 has been divided into two sub-frequency ranges: FR2-1 which covers the
original range of 24.25-52.6 GHz, and FR2-2 which extends NR operation from
52.6 to 71 GHz. Given the prevalence of unlicensed spectrum in this frequency
range, a new NR band for unlicensed operation was introduced in this work
item, band n263. This band extends from 57 to 71GHz, ensuring the unlicensed
spectrum of all regions is supported.

NOTE 1: This band is for unlicensed operation and subject to regional and/or

* * *
[Channel arrangement]{.underline}
UE channel bandwidth for n263: Compared to FR2-1, FR2-2 supports larger
channel bandwidths including 800, 1600 and 2000MHz. In this release, only
400MHz channel bandwidth support is mandatory for band n263. An optional
capability enables the UE to indicate its supported channel bandwidths for 480
and 960kHz SCS [3].
Channel spacing for band n263:
Channel raster: Band n263 is defined to support 138 entries of non-overlapping
100MHz CBW with 100.8MHz channel spacing, 34 entries of non-overlapping 400MHz
CBW with 403.2MHz channel spacing, and 30 to 34 entries of overlapping 800,
1600, and 2000MHz CBW that are spaced part by 403.2MHz. Additionally, band
n263 supports one 120kHz SCS-based synchronization raster entry for each
100MHz CBW, and one 480kHz SCS-based synchronization raster entry for 400MHz
CBW. Initial access using 960kHz SCS is not supported.
_[Core requirements]{.underline}_
[Extending requirement definition to 71GHz]{.underline}
Many core requirements, either their definition or approach used to define
them in FR2-1, were reused in FR2-2. For example, given the highly integrated
nature of designs in this frequency range, characteristics continue to be
specified over-the-air in FR2-2.
As with FR2-1, minimum performance requirements for FR2-2 were defined per-
band and per-UE power class. Tx and Rx requirements were defined for power
class 1 (FWA UE), power class 2 (vehicular UE), and power class 3 (handheld
UE) operation in band n263. These power classes use the same reference form-
factor used in FR2-1, but the number of antenna elements used to derive the
requirements was increased to help alleviate the impact of higher losses and
more complex integration of this frequency range.
[Carrier aggregation in FR2-2]{.underline}
In addition to single carrier requirements, FR2-2 requirements to support
intra-band contiguous CA operation have also been defined. In this release,
contiguous DL CA configurations within FR2-2 may only contain multiples of the
same channel bandwidth. The supported CA band combinations include FR2-2 with
an FR1 anchor; combinations for n48 + n263 were introduced in RAN4 #104e [4].
[Beam correspondence]{.underline}
For band n263, support of beam correspondence without UL beam sweeping is
defined for power class 3.

911106 **Core part: NR_UDC** NR_UDC-Core R2 RP-220140 CATT
Summary based on the input provided by CATT in RP-220142.
This work item specifies NR Uplink Data Compression (UDC), i.e. uplink data
can be compressed at the UE and can be decompressed at the NG-RAN node.
In this WI, DEFLATE based UDC solution is introduced which uses LTE UDC as
baseline.
DEFLATE based UDC solution could achieve higher compression efficiency which
would save more uplink resources and reduce the transmission latency. The NG-
RAN node can configure the UE to use UDC or not. If UDC is configured for a
DRB, ROHC or EHC is not used for that DRB. One byte UDC header is introduced
to indicate whether the PDCP SDU is compressed by UDC or not, whether the
compression buffer is reset or not, and 4 validation bits of checksum are used
to indicate whether the compression and decompression buffers are synchronous.
For each DRB, the maximum compression buffer is 8192 bytes. If there are
errors or failures due to buffer mismatching, the NG-RAN node can send a PDCP
control PDU for error notification to the UE, the UE may reset the compression
buffer when such notification has been received.
Similar as for LTE UDC, to improve compression efficiency of the first
packets, two types of pre-defined dictionary can be used for UDC. One is
standard dictionary for SIP and SDP signalling as defined in RFC 3485, and
another is operator defined dictionary. The NG-RAN node configures whether or
which dictionary is used for a UDC DRB.
NR UDC can be applied to NR-DC, NE-DC and NGEN-DC scenarios. Also, NR UDC can
be applied to split bearer type. For NR-DC, NE-DC and NGEN-DC scenarios, MN
can send an indication to SN regarding the maximum number of UDC DRBs allowed
to SN terminated bearer. Furthermore, NR UDC can also be applied to CU CP and
UP splitting scenario, where corresponding configuration parameters can be
carried via E1 interface.
NR UDC continuity is also supported, which is similar as the ROHC continuity
mechanism.
UDC related capabilities are also defined for UEs. There are four capabilities
defined: supporting basic UDC function, supporting standard dictionary,
supporting operator defined dictionary, and supporting UDC continuity. If the
UE supports operator defined dictionary, it shall report the version of the
dictionary and the associated PLMN ID to assist the NG-RAN node to identify
the dictionary stored by the UE. The NG-RAN node configures UDC according to
the signalled UE capabilities.

RP-193256 China Unicom
Summary based on the input provided by China Unicom in RP-220556.
This WI specifies the NR QoE functionality.
The QoE Measurement Collection function enables the collection of application
layer measurements from the UE. The measurements are supported for Streaming
services, MTSI services, and VR services. Both signalling based and management
based QoE measurement collection are supported. In this Release, basic
application layer measurement collection mechanism is supported, and RAN
visible QoE measurement mechanism and metrics are supported.
In the WI, the feature of QoE Measurement Collection function is activated in
the NG-RAN either by direct configuration from the OAM system (management-
based activation), or by signalling from the OAM via the Core Network
(signalling-based activation), using UE-associated signalling. One or more QoE
measurement collection jobs can be activated at a UE per service type. The
application layer measurement configuration and measurement reporting is
supported in RRC_CONNECTED state only. The QoE Measurement Collection
deactivation permanently stops all or some of QoE measurement collection jobs
towards a UE, resulting in the release of the corresponding QoE measurement
configuration(s) in the UE. When a service is provided within a configured
slice, the QoE Measurement Collection for this service type could also be
configured together with the corresponding slice scope, so that the user
experience of this service could also be evaluated on a per-slice basis.
The QoE Measurement Collection pause/resume procedure is used to pause/resume
the reporting for all QoE reports or to pause/resume QoE reporting per QoE
configuration in a UE for RAN overload situation. The gNB can send a downlink
RRC message to temporarily stop the application layer measurement reports
associated to one or multiple QoE configurations from UE to the network.
The QoE Measurement Collection continuity for intra-system intra-RAT mobility
is supported in R17, with the area scope parameters configured by the OAM. The
NG-RAN node is responsible for keeping track and identify whether the UE is
inside or outside the area scope. A UE should continue an ongoing measurement
even if it leaves the area scope, unless the NG-RAN node indicates to the UE
to release the QoE configuration.
RAN visible QoE measurements are configured by the NG-RAN node, where a subset
of QoE metrics is reported from the UE as an explicit IE to NG-RAN node. RAN
visible QoE measurements (e.g., RAN visible QoE metrics, RAN visible QoE
values) could be utilized by the NG-RAN node for network optimization. RAN
visible QoE measurements are supported for the DASH streaming and VR service.
Radio-related measurements may be collected via immediate MDT for the
supported services. The MCE/TCE performs the correlation of the immediate MDT
results and the QoE measurement results collected at the same UE.
The following alignments are supported in this Release:
\- Alignment between a signalling-based QoE measurement and a signalling-based
MDT measurement.
\- Alignment between a management-based QoE measurement and a management-based
MDT measurement.

Summary based on the input provided by vivo in RP-220606.
In Rel-15 and Rel-16, the UE FR1 transmit power and receiver sensitivity are
tested by conducted methodology at the temporary antenna ports and it remains
unknown what the actual performance of the UE would be in realistic network
conditions with the UE antenna included. Radiated performance based on OTA
testing is one of the most important characteristics to verify the entire UE
performance under conditions more closely resembling the end user's
interaction with the device.
In order to ensure the good overall system performance, the requirements for
NR UE TRP and TRS is important for consistent devices performance in the real
NR networks which operate in the OTA manner. Unified requirements in 3GPP will
provide authoritative guidance and will greatly promote the development of 5G
industries.
This WI defines the test methodology to verify the NR UE TRP TRS performance
for NR standalone (SA) and NR non-standalone (NSA) operation mode. The outcome
is captured in a new technical report TR 38.834. Then 3GPP can specify the
follow-up OTA requirements for FR1 UE based on the available test method.
A full package of test method under SA and NSA mode aiming to specify 3GPP TRP
TRS OTA requirements is defined:
\- UE type: The test method covers device types including Smartphone (1st
priority), Tablet, LEE and LME.
\- Usage scenarios: Talk mode using head & hand phantom for narrow devices
between 56 mm and 72 mm and for wide devices with a width >72 mm and \72mm and â‰¤92mm ; PDA Grip Hand for UE with Width â‰¥56mm and â‰¤72mm)
\- Test procedure for SA and EN-DC: Test setup for Single-antenna and
multiple-antennas anechoic chambers; TRP TRS calibration procedure; Ripple
test procedure for 30cm and 50cm, both theta-axis and phi-axis; SA TRP TRS
performance measurement procedure; EN-DC TRP TRS performance measurement
procedure (Only NR carrier measurement is needed); Minimum measurement
distance of anechoic chambers
\- UE configurations: TRP antenna configuration (TAS OFF with antenna locked
at primary antenna); TRS antenna configuration (no specific setting); EN-DC
configuration (For TRP UL configuration: the UL output power of LTE carrier
should be set as a constant power of 10dBm, while measuring NR at maximum
output power, i.e., with fixed p-MaxEUTRA-r15=10 dBm, and p-NR-FR1 not
configured; For TRS UL configuration: The UL power configuration for LTE and
NR is 50%-50% power splitting, i.e. For PC3, p-MaxEUTRA-r15=20 dBm, and p-NR-
FR1= 20dBm; For PC2, p-MaxEUTRA-r15=23 dBm, and p-NR-FR1= 23dBm.)
\- Measurement uncertainty assessment (RAN5): Measurement error uncertainty
contribution descriptions; Preliminary example of uncertainty budget (Expanded
uncertainty for TRP hand only (browsing mode): 1.78 dB; Expanded uncertainty
for TRP hand only (browsing mode): 2.20 dB)
\- Test phantom definition: PDA Grip Hand; Wide Grip Hand; Head Phantom

Summary based on the input provided by China Unicom in RP-220560.
This WI specifies the interface, reusing E1 interface, interconnecting an eNB-
CP (control plane and L2/L1 part of an eNB) and an eNB-UP (user plane part of
an eNB) within E-UTRAN, or interconnecting an ng-eNB-CU-CP (control plane part
of an ng-eNB central unit) and an ng-eNB-CU-UP (user plane part of an ng-eNB
central unit) within NG-RAN[1]. In Release 16, E1 interface was limited to
support interconnecting a gNB-CU-CP (control plane part of the gNB central
unit) and a gNB-CU-UP (user plane part of the gNB central unit) in NG-RAN.
In the WI, a split of eNB into an eNB-CP and an eNB-UP is defined for E-UTRAN,
and a split of ng-eNB-CU into an ng-eNB-CU-CP and an ng-eNB-CU-UP is defined
for NG-RAN. The eNB-CP hosts the RRC/ RLC/MAC/PHY and the control plane part
of the PDCP protocol, and the eNB-UP hosts the user plane part of the PDCP
protocol [3]. The split of ng-eNB-CU into an ng-eNB-CU-CP and an ng-eNB-CU-UP
are defined for NG-RAN [4]. The ng-eNB-CU-CP hosts the RRC and the control
plane part of the PDCP protocol of the ng-eNB-CU, and the ng-eNB-CU-UP hosts
hosting the user plane part of the PDCP protocol and the SDAP protocol of the
ng-eNB-CU. The E1 interface is used between an eNB-CP and an eNB-UP as shown
in Figure 1, or between an ng-eNB-CU-CP and an ng-eNB-CU-UP as shown in Figure
2. The ng-eNB-CU-CP is connected with the ng-eNB-DU via the W1-C interface,
while the ng-eNB-CU-UP is connected with the ng-eNB-DU through the W1-U
interface.
The architectures in Figure 1 and 2 enable the following deployment scenarios.
â€¢ An eNB may consist of an eNB-CP and multiple eNB-UPs.
â€¢ The eNB-UP is connected to the eNB-CP, while one eNB-UP is connected to only
one eNB-CP.
â€¢ The eNB-CP and the eNB-UP terminates the UP interface used to convey E-UTRA
or NR PDCP PDUs. NR user plane protocol, as defined in TS 38.425 [5], is used
for this interface.
â€¢ An ng-eNB may consist of an ng-eNB-CU-CP, one or more multiple ng-eNB-CU-
UP(s) and one or more multiple ng-eNB-DU(s).
â€¢ One ng-eNB-DU is connected to only one ng-eNB-CU-CP, while one ng-eNB-CU-UP
is connected to only one ng-eNB-CU-CP.
â€¢ One ng-eNB-DU can be connected to multiple ng-eNB-CU-UPs under the control
of the same ng-eNB-CU-CP;
â€¢ One ng-eNB-CU-UP can be connected to multiple ng-eNB-DUs under the control
of the same ng-eNB-CU-CP;
â€¢ An ng-eNB-CU-CP and an ng-eNB-CU-UP is connected via the E1 interface.
â€¢ An ng-eNB-DU is connected to an ng-eNB-CU-CP via the W1-C interface, and to
an ng-eNB-CU-UP via the W1-U interface.

Figure 2: Overall architecture for separation of ng-eNB-CU-CP and ng-eNB-CU-UP
The general aspects and principles for E1 interface is specified in TS 37.480
[6], and layer 1 of E1 is specified in TS 37.481 [7].The E1 signalling
transport supporting for ng-eNB-CU-CP/ng-eNB-CU-UP, eNB-CP/eNB-UP, which is
based on the SCTP/IP protocol stack, are described in TS 37.482 [8]. The E1
application protocol (E1AP) supporting for ng-eNB-CU-CP/ng-eNB-CU-UP, eNB-
CP/eNB-UP is specified in TS 37.483 [9], including the relevant descriptions
of E1 interface management procedures and E1AP elements, which allow to setup
the E1 interface, exchange the relevant configuration data and date usage
report in MR-DC between ng-eNB-CU-CP and ng-eNB-CU-UP, or between eNB-CP and
eNB-UP.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei, HiSiliconin RP-220410.
This WI introduces the following enhancements:
\- for Carrier Aggregation, faster SCell activation
\- for EN-DC and for NR DC: a mechanism to deactivate and activate the NR
Secondary Cell Group
\- support of inter-SN Conditional PSCell Change and of Conditional PSCell
Addition
The enhancement to SCell activation allows faster usage of SCells. For traffic
consisting primarily in short bursts, this allows deactivating SCells while
there is not traffic, and reduce the UE power consumption, and having the
additional carrier more quickly available when the next traffic burst appears.
The new SCG deactivation/activation mechanism allows keeping the NR SCG while
saving UE power when the data traffic is lower and to activate the SCG again
when needed due to increased traffic. This is also useful for bursty or
variable data traffic.
Conditional PSCell Change was introduced in Rel-16 but limited to intra-SN
PSCell change. This WI is adding the support inter-SN Conditional PSCell
Change, thus extending the benefits to wider areas. In addition, Conditional
PSCell Addition is supported, so that a PSCell can be added as soon as allowed
by radio conditions.
[Efficient SCell activation]{.underline}
To enable fast SCell activation when Carrier Aggregation is configured, for
each configured SCell, the network can configure a number of aperiodic CSI-RS
for tracking for fast SCell activation. A new MAC Control Element (CE) that
indicates SCell activation can indicate the aperiodic CSI-RS for tracking that
is activated by the network to assist the UE for activation of the SCell. This
aperiodic CSI-RS can be used to assist Automatic Gain Control (AGC) and
time/frequency synchronization.
[SCG deactivation/activation]{.underline}
SCG deactivation/activation applies to an NR SCG, in EN-DC and in NR-DC.
UE behaviour while the SCG is deactivated
When the SCG is deactivated, UE activities on the SCG are reduced:
\- the UE does not transmit or receive any data via the SCG;
\- the UE does not perform/report any physical layer measurements;
\- all SCG SCells are deactivated.
However, other activities remain:
\- if configured to do so, the UE performs radio link monitoring and beam
failure detection on the PSCell
\- the UE performs measurements for mobility, including measurements for SCG
mobility configured by the SN;
\- the UE can exchange RRC signalling with the SN via the MCG as in Rel-15
(e.g. to report SCG radio link/beam failure, mobility measurement results);
\- in case of PSCell change, the UE does not perform random access towards the
new PSCell if the SCG is to remain deactivated.
Data transmission while the SCG is deactivated
When the SCG is deactivated:
\- data can be transmitted or received via MCG bearers or via the MCG leg of
split bearers;
\- SCG bearers can remain configured;
\- if there are uplink data to transmit on an SCG bearer, the UE indicates it
to the network via RRC signalling.
SCG activation/deactivation
The network activates or deactivates the SCG by sending an RRC reconfiguration
message to the UE.
For SCG activation, if the PSCell hasn\'t changed since the SCG deactivation,
the timing advance is still valid and beam/radio link failure was not
detected, it is possible to perform SCG activation without random access, i.e.
the UE starts monitoring PDCCH and can receive downlink assignments and uplink
grants. Otherwise, random access is necessary.
On the network side, SCG activation and SCG deactivation is coordinated
between the MN and the SN using the existing procedure for SN addition and SN
modification. Both the MN and the SN can request SCG activation or SCG
deactivation and the other node can accept or reject the request.
[Conditional PSCell Addition/Change]{.underline}
From the UE perspective, inter-SN conditional PSCell change is very similar to
intra-SN conditional PSCell change, with a few main differences:
\- the conditional reconfiguration is received from the MCG;
\- the conditional reconfiguration can include a reconfiguration of both MCG
and SCG;
\- the associated execution condition may refer to a conditional measurement
configured by the MN (if initiated by the MN) or to a conditional measurement
configured by the SN;
\- at CPC execution, the UE indicates to the MN which conditional
reconfiguration was applied.
On the network side, there are a number of new procedures.
For instance, CPA and inter-SN CPC preparation requires exchanges between the
MN, the SN and candidate target SN(s):
\- the initiating node (MN or SN) indicates a list of candidate target PSCells
and associated execution conditions;
\- the MN provides this information to candidate target SN(s);
\- candidate target SN(s) provide conditional reconfigurations for all or a
subset of the candidate target PSCells;
\- the MN transmits the conditional configurations to the UE, possibly with a
MCG and SCG reconfiguration, as for any reconfiguration.
After CPA or CPC is prepared:
\- the initiating node can request candidate target SNs to update their
conditional reconfigurations according to a new UE configuration, or to
release them;
\- candidate target SN can initiate a modification or release already
configured conditional reconfigurations.

Summary based on the input provided by EBU, Qualcomm Incorporated in
RP-220445.
Before Rel-17, 5G terrestrial broadcast only supports the same system
bandwidths as traditional LTE (1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, 20MHz). Broadcast UHF
spectrum, however, is channelized typically in channels of 6/7/8MHz (depending
on the region). The objective of this work item [1] is to introduce support of
PMCH bandwidths of 6/7/8MHz in MBMS-dedicated cells to enable deployment of 5G
terrestrial broadcast in broadcast UHF spectrum.
The detailed operation to enable the above feature is as follows:
â€¢ The eNB indicates in MIB a system bandwidth of 5MHz (25PRBs) or 3MHz
(15PRBs).
â€¢ In system information, the eNB indicates, per MBSFN area, whether the PMCH
in that MBSFN area uses a bandwidth larger than the system bandwidth. The
possible values for this bandwidth are 6MHz (30PRBs), 7MHz (35PRBs) and 8MHz
(40PRBs).
â€¢ The PMCH and MBSFN-RS are received with the indicated bandwidth.
A figure depicting the operation is shown below:

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in SP-220300
Since the initial development and last update of TV Video Profiles defined in
TS 26.116, TV and mobile device capabilities have improved and nowadays they
support higher decoding capabilities. In particular, new TV sets and 5G mobile
devices entering the market since 2020 support up to 8K video decoding as well
as 8K display capabilities.
8K is recently trialled and introduced in several services. In addition, other
ecosystem support is happening, such as 8K encoders are announced, 8K TV sets
are shipped and content is produced in 8K. Furthermore, it is evident that
distribution of 8K TV content is feasible with 5G. In order to provide full
interoperability for 8K TV services in the context of 5G, this work item
specifies an HEVC-based 8K TV operation point in TS 26.116 as well as the
corresponding media decoding capabilities for 5GMS in TS 26.511 in order to
enable support for up to 8K video.
More specifically, this work item completed the following work:
  * Defined new 8K TV operation point(s) for TV Video profiles with conforming bitstream requirement based on H.265/HEVC Main-10 Profile Main Tier Profile in TS 26.116 [1]
  * Defined the relevant ISO BMFF encapsulation, CMAF media profile and DASH signalling for the new 8K TV operation point in TS 26.116 [1].
  * Included the newly defined decoding capabilities and associated profiles and operation points into 5G Media Streaming for TV Services in TS 26.511 [2].
  * Documented typical traffic characteristics of 8K TV video services > in TR 26.925 [3].
The work was carried out in close collaboration with MPEG CMAF and DVB to
align the media profiles.

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in SP-220637.
The Technical Report provides a full characterization framework for video
codecs in the context of 5G services. This framework permits the evaluation of
the performance of existing 3GPP codecs, and also permits the identification
of potential benefits of new codecs.
Note: Although Studies are usually not reported in this document, it was
estimated by the rapporteur that this study deserves a summary.
The framework fulfils the following aspects:
  * A comprehensive set of scenarios relevant to 3GPP services is described in clause 6. For each scenario the anchors for existing 3GPP codecs (H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC), the version of the reference software for the anchors, and their associated configurations are defined.
  * A set of reference sequences is identified per scenario and each sequence is described in more details in Annex C.
  * For each scenario, one or more performance metrics are defined. Each metric is described in more details in clause 5.5.
  * The overall characterization framework process is defined in clause 5 and in Annex B, D, E, F, and G.
  * New codecs, namely H.266/VVC, MPEG-5 EVC and AOMedia AV1 are identified in clause 8. For each scenario, a version of their respective reference software is identified and configurations as close as possible to the anchor configurations are defined.
  * For all codecs, metrics are computed and documented as part of the Technical Report. The report only documents objective metrics.
  * According to Figure 1, all of those metrics are used in order to characterize test codecs against anchor codecs using the BjÃ¶ntegard-Delta (BD)-Rate gain expressing the bitrate savings in percentage of the new codec against the existing one.
  * The TR is supported by a huge set of data that is available here: https://dash-large-files.akamaized.net/WAVE/3GPP/5GVideo/ including raw video sequences, anchor and test bitstreams, results, png plots and annotation, etc as well as a fully functional set of scripts that allow to replicate the setup and results.

Figure 1: Characterization Framework
This is the first time that 3GPP has done such an extensive baseline work for
video codec evaluation and characterization. The study item was backed and
supported by 23 3GPP members. While the framework is comprehensive, it was
also identified that it clearly has some limitations; for example, encoder
configurations for each scenario may have not been stringent enough in their
definition, leading to results that may not be fully comparable. Furthermore,
the encoders used for the evaluation of the various codecs have different
maturity and features. Results in this document should always be considered
with a clear understanding of the characterization conditions and these
results were derived. The framework does not include subjective evaluation; it
is purely based on objective metrics.
One important outcome of the work documented in this Technical Report is the
characterization and evaluation of H.265/HEVC against relevant scenarios and
its characterization against H.264/AVC. Also, a first understanding of
H.265/HEVC performances versus new codecs was developed. From the scenarios
and results in this Technical Report it is observed that:
\- H.265/HEVC does not show any functional deficiencies or gaps, nor does it
lack any relevant features.
\- In terms of compression efficiency, H.265/HEVC, evaluated based on the HM,
performs sufficiently well for all the scenarios in this technical report.
Providing consistent HEVC-based interoperability in 3GPP services, for
traditional and new scenarios, is definitely beneficial. It is recommended
that 3GPP consider upgrading specifications to support profiles, levels, and
possibly features available in HEVC. Features may include better support for
screen content and computer-generated content, XR/AR type of services, as well
as low and very low latency services.
The framework and the initial results for new codecs demonstrate coding
performance improvements over H.265/HEVC for some codecs of up to 50%.
However, the initial results are not considered mature enough to support
concrete recommendations on adding new codecs. The potential addition of any
new codec in 3GPP services and specifications requires diligent preparation,
including the identification of needs and requirements for different
scenarios, as well as a complete characterization against existing codecs. The
information in this TR, as well as any new developments in 3GPP with respect
to codecs in latest specifications, could serve as a baseline for future work.
Such an effort may lead to conclusions on the potential addition of any new
codec in 3GPP services and specifications. However, no immediate need has been
identified to initiate such follow-up work.

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in SP-220626
This work item improves the acoustic test methods in TS 26.132 [1] by
providing proper guidance on how to setup a UE featuring a non-traditional
earpiece.
The acoustic performance of UEs is evaluated by tests defined in [1]. The
tests were originally developed for handsets featuring a traditional earpiece,
i.e., one in which sound radiates through an acoustic port outlet directed at
the user's ear canal. Recently, UEs have come to market featuring other means
of radiating sound to the user, e.g., through vibrating displays,
necessitating an update of 3GPP test specifications.
The HaNTE work item developed new test methods and assessed those methods
through round-robin testing and listening experiments. Ultimately, the test
methods in [1] were improved to specify how to mount a HaNTE UE for testing.

Summary based on the input provided by HEAD acoustics GmbH and Orange in
SP-211417.
This work item extends the audio test specifications in TS 26.131 [1] and TS
26.132 [2] to analogue (wired) and digital (wired and wireless) electrical
interfaces, which were so far not considered. The introduced test methods and
requirements ensure proper interoperability (from an audio/acoustic point of
view) between the interface and headsets.
The acoustic performance of UEs is evaluated by terminal tests defined in the
test suite in TS 26.131 (requirements) / 26.132 (test methods). It is relevant
to extend these tests to also use the electrical interface (e.g., audio jack,
Bluetooth or USB-C), as today's market users can purchase compatible headsets
or other products that use standardized connections with mobile phones.
The changes to these specifications introduced by the work item considered the
following aspects:
  * Test setup for analogue and digital electrical interface was introduced, based on related work in Recommendation ITU-T P.381 [3] and P.383 [4].
  * Test methods, performance requirements and objectives were determined in a unified and highly comparable way for analogue and digital electrical interfaces.
  * Test methods, performance requirements and objectives were derived from existing ones for handset/headset UE, as well as from related work in Recommendation ITU-T P.381 [3] and P.383 [4].
  * Performance requirements and objectives as well as the applicability of the new test methods were validated in measurement series.

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in SP-220635
This work item [1] relates to the support of generic UE data collection,
reporting and event exposure, and the 5G Media Streaming instantiation of the
generic functionality. It is related to two other 3GPP Rel-17 work items:
\- SA2 work item \"eNA_Ph2\" with regards to UE data collection and event
exposure by an AF to event consumers such as the NWDAF, and
\- CT3 work item \"EVEX\" with regards to extending relevant stage 3
specifications in support of event exposure and NEF mediation of interactions
pertaining to UE data collection, reporting and event exposure functionality
specific to 5G Media Streaming.
[SA4 specifications on generic UE data collection, reporting and event
exposure]{.underline}
The SA4 specifications on UE data collection, reporting and event exposure
describe and define the mechanisms whereby different types of data collection
clients, such as a UE, an application server in the network, or a server
entity of an Application Service Provider, to collect and report a variety of
application-level UE information, in accordance with their respective
configurations, to a Data Collection AF (Application Function). The Data
Collection AF can subsequently process its collected UE data to be offered, as
Event Exposure services, to external entities for device, network and service
performance monitoring and data analytics purposes.
The system architecture, reference points, and high-level procedures regarding
generic UE data collection, reporting and event exposure are described in the
stage 2 specification TS 26.531 [2]. The stage 3 specification TS 26.532 [3]
defines the detailed procedures and associated APIs for the generic UE data
collection and reporting functionality.
Figure 1 depicts the generic UE data collection, reporting and event exposure
architecture.
{width="3.5843700787401573in" height="3.5843700787401573in"}
Figure 1 -- Reference architecture for generic UE data collection, reporting
and event exposure
The functional entities and reference points pertaining to EVEX in figure 1
are described below:
\- _Data collection clients_ including the Direct Data Collection Client in
the UE, Indirect Data Collection Client of the Application Service Provider,
and the AS (Application Server, which contains and delivers user plane data to
end-user devices). These entities obtain their UE data collection and
reporting configuration from, and reports collected UE data to, the Data
Collection Client, at the R2, R3 and R4 reference points, respectively.
\- _Data Collection AF_ \-- This entity is provisioned with its UE data
collection, reporting and event exposure configuration by the Provisioning AF
of the Application Service Provider at the R1 reference point. It utilizes
that information to provide data collection and reporting configuration(s) to
relevant data collection clients. Subsequently, the Data Collection AF
processes UE data reports received from the data collection client(s) for
event exposure services to eligible consumer entities (e.g., the NWDAF and
Event Consumer AF of the Application Service Provider, at reference points R5
and R6, respectively) according to its event exposure restriction
configuration.
\- _Provisioning AF --_ This entity provisions the Data Collection AF with UE
data collection, reporting and event exposure information via reference point
R1. A portion of that configuration information is intended to be forwarded by
the Data Collection AF to data collection clients.
\- _UE Application_ \-- This optional entity in the UE, if instantiated, is
responsible for interacting with the Direct Data Collection Client, via
reference point R7, to obtain a UE data collection and reporting
configuration, and subsequently send collected UE data reports to the Direct
Data Collection Client to be in turn reported to the Data Collection AF.
\- _NEF_ \-- This entity is optionally present to mediate the configuration,
reporting and event exposure related interactions between associated pairs of
the above-described entities when those reside in separate trust domains.
[SA4 specifications on 5G Media Streaming specific data collection, reporting
and event exposure]{.underline}
Instantiation of the generic UE data collection, reporting and event exposure
architecture for 5G Media Streaming is specified in TS 26.501 [4], as shown in
figure 2.
Figure 2 -- Instantiation of generic data collection, reporting and event
exposure for 5G Media Streaming
As shown in figure 2, the Data Collection AF is instantiated as a subfunction
of the 5GMS Media Streaming Application Function (5GMS AF). The Direct Data
Collection Client for 5GMS is instantiated as a subfunction of the 5GMS
Client's Media Session Handler. The AS in figure 1 is instantiated as the 5GMS
AS and could either reside within the 5G System or is hosted externally in the
Application Service Provider domain.
It should be noted that in the 5G Media Streaming instantiation of the generic
UE data collection, reporting and event exposure architecture, the 5GMS-
specific reference points M1 and M5, and whose APIs are specified in TS 26.512
[5], are employed instead of R1 and R2, to support the provisioning of the
Data Collection AF, and the configuration and reporting related interactions
between the Data Collection AF and data collection clients. In particular, the
M1 API in [5] has been extended to support event exposure restriction
configuration in the form of Data Access Profiles to enable the Application
Service Provider to control the granularity of access by subscriber entities
to UE data related event information by the dimensions of user, time, and
location.
[CT3 specifications on 5G Media Streaming specific data collection, reporting
and event exposure]{.underline}
Three CT3 specifications are extended in Rel-17 in support of EVEX:
\- TS 29.517 [6], which defines the stage 3 protocol, message flows and
Service Based Interface (SBI) of the Application Function Exposure
(Naf_EventExposure) Services offered by the AF to NF service consumers (e.g.
NWDAF, NEF). The Application Function Exposure Service are usually defined in
SA2 specifications TS 23.502 [9] and TS 23.288 [10]), as indicated in clause 4
of TS 29.517. However, for producing stage 3 protocol and API specification in
TS 29.517 for 5G Media Streaming specific event exposure services, SA2 has
directed CT3 to reference stage 2 and stage 3 specifications in TS 26.501 [4]
and TS 26.512 [5] from SA4. The 5G Media Streaming related Naf_EventExposure
service comprise the following components: QoE metrics; Consumption reports;
Network Assistance invocations; Dynamic charging and policy invocations; and
Media streaming access activity.
\- TS 29.522 [7], which defines the NEF Northbound interfaces between the NEF
and AF and the associated RESTful/RPC APIs that allow an external AF to access
the services and capabilities provided by 3GPP network entities via secure
exposure by the NEF. Like the case of TS 29.517 [6], in accordance with SA2
directive, the SA4 EVEX specifications in TS 26.531 [2] and TS 26.532 [3] are
referenced in the TS 29.522 specification of the
Nnef_DataReportingProvisioning and Nnef_DataReporting service APIs, which are
functionally equivalent to the Ndcaf_DataReportingProvisioning and
Ndcaf_DataReporting services and associated APIs specifications in [2] and
[3].
\- TS 29.591 [8], which provides the stage 3 protocol definitions and message
flows and specifies the API for each service offered by the NEF. It is
extended with the various 5G Media Streaming specific event types as defined
in TS 26.501 [4] and TS 26.512 [5].

900002 **Restoration of PDN Connections in PGW-C/SMF Set** RPCPSET C4
CP-203020 LANDAIS, Bruno, Nokia
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in CP-220149.
This Work Item extends the functionality of Multimedia Telephony Service for
IMS (MTSI) in TS 26.114 by adding the Virtual Reality (VR) unidirectional
video transmission capability.
The work item defines PDN connection restoration procedures that enable to
restore PDN connections in EPC after a PGW-C/SMF failure, restart or scale-in
operation, by allowing to move PDN connections to a different PGW-C/SMF of the
PGW-C/SMF set.
SMF scalability and resiliency can be supported for PDU sessions in 5GS by
deploying an SMF set, i.e. a set of SMF instances that are functionally
equivalent and inter-changeable and that share the same contexts (as defined
in Release 16). This enables e.g. an AMF, PCF or UPF to reselect a different
SMF in the same SMF set when the SMF serving a PDU session fails, restarts or
is removed from the SMF set (scale-in operation), without interrupting the
services and the PDN connectivity of the PDU session.
Inter-system mobility between 5GS and EPS relies on combo PGW-C/SMF. Combo
PGW-C/SMF can be deployed in a PGW-C/SMF set. The work item defines PDN
connection restoration procedures to restore the PDN connections served by a
PGW-C/SMF, when a PGW-C/SMF in a PGW-C/SMF set fails, restarts or is removed
from the PGW-C/SMF set. This allows to fully leverage the benefits of
deploying PGW-C/SMF set by enabling:
> \- to scale-in a PGW-C/SMF set without tearing down and re-establishing all
> the PDN connections of the PGW-C/SMF that is removed from the set;
>
> \- an MME or ePDG to reselect a different PGW-C/SMF in the PGW-C/SMF set for
> an on-going PDN connection or a group of PDN connections, when the PGW-C/SMF
> that was serving the PDN connection or the group of PDN connections fails or
> restarts, and to maintain the services and PDN connectivity of the PDN
> connection or group of PDN connections; and
>
> \- a PGW-C/SMF to instruct an MME, ePDG and/or PGW-U/UPF to use a new
> PGW-C/SMF for an on-going PDN connection or group of PDN connections, when
> e.g. a PCF or PGW-U/UPF reselects a different PGW-C/SMF from the PGW-C/SMF
> set.

Summary based on the input provided by China Mobile in SP-220289.
Authentication and key management for applications based on 3GPP credential in
5G (AKMA) is a cellular-network-based delegated authentication system
specified for the 5G system, helping establish a secure tunnel between the end
user and the application server. Using AKMA, a user can log in to an
application service only based on the 3GPP credential which is the permanent
key stored in the user's tamper-resistant smart card UICC. The application
service provider can also delegate the task of user authentication to the
mobile network operator by using AKMA.
The AKMA architecture and procedures are specified by SA3 in TS 33.535 [1],
with the related study showing how its general principles are derived
documented in TR 33.835 [2]. The AKMA feature introduces a new Network
Function into the 5G system, which is the AKMA Anchor Function (AAnF). Its
detailed services and API definitions are specified by CT3 in TS 29.535[3].
Earlier generations of cellular networks include two similar standards
specified by SA3, which are generic bootstrapping architecture (GBA) and
battery-efficient security for very low throughput machine type communication
devices (BEST). Since the AKMA feature is deemed as a successor of these
systems, the work is launched by SA3 without the involvement of stage 1.

Summary based on the input provided by Qualcomm in SP-220620.
The work on AKMA TLS protocol profiles provides the details on how to use the
newly introduced AKMA key (see [4]) to provide secure TLS connection between
the UE and an Application Function (AF) in the network.
The AKMA WID [4] introduced a method of generating keys for use between a UE
and an Application Function (AF) in the network. These keys are generated from
a key derived by an authentication run over the 5G core (see [2]). The \"AKMA
TLS protocol profiles\" work item specifies how to use these AKMA key to
provide secure TLS connections, either using certificate-based TLS and HTTP
Digest with the AKMA key in the TLS tunnel or using symmetric key TLS using
the AKMA key. The specification of the profiles is based on the methods
standardised to utilise GBA keys in TS 33.222 [1] and TS 24.109 [3].
The stage 2 of the AKMA TLS protocol profiles work is specified in TS 33.535
[2] while the stage 3 is contained in TS 24.109 [3].

Evans, Tim, Vodafone 890012 **Enhancements to User Plane Integrity Protection
Support in 5GS** eUPIP_SEC S3 SP-200719 Anand Palanigounder, Qualcomm
Summary based on the input provided by Vodafone in RP-221340.
Release 15 NR and 5G Core enabled optional support for the integrity
protection of user plane data. In Release 16, it was made mandatory for UEs to
support User Plane Integrity Protection (UPIP) in NR at the full data rate
that the UE supports in both the Uplink and Downlink. This provides protection
against certain security attacks but only for NR capable devices while using
NR and the 5G Core.
In Release 17, the SA 3 work item \"User Plane Integrity Protection for LTE\"
was agreed in SP-210105 with the intention of protecting LTE devices from
these security attacks. Subsequently, in RP-213669, TSG-RAN agreed the
Building Block WID \"User Plane Integrity Protection support for EPC connected
architectures\" to enable full data rate Uu interface UPIP for EPS, but only
on EN-DC capable devices. This provides useful protection to NR capable
smartphones in case they are, for example, forced off NR and onto an E-UTRA-
only connection or an EN-DC connection.
The overall security architecture is specified in TS 33.401 and system
architecture details are specified in TS 23.501 and TS 23.401.
The UE indicates its support for EPS UPIP in the UE Network Capability sent in
NAS signalling (TS 24.301) from the UE to the MME. The MME stores this UPIP
support information and sends it to the eNB in the S1AP Initial Context Setup
Request and Handover Request messages. The eNB uses this indication (and not
any information in the UE Radio Access Capabilities IE) to determine whether
the UE supports EPS UPIP.
The SMF+PGW-C may supply the MME with a security policy (UPIP
required/preferred/not needed). The MME stores this policy information and
passes it onto the eNB on a per-EPS bearer basis in the Security Indication
IE. If the eNB does not receive any security policy, the eNB can be configured
with a default UPIP policy to use (e.g. \"UPIP preferred\").
X2AP (TS 36.423), and S1AP (TS 36.413) signalling supports UPIP continuity at
handover. X2AP supports the use of UPIP in the SgNB when EN-DC is in use. E1AP
interface signalling (TS 37.483) supports UPIP when the eNB is split into eNB-
Control Plane and eNB-User Plane functions.
At X2, S1 (intra and inter-MME) and inter-RAT handovers, mechanisms are
specified in X2AP and S1AP to ensure that EPS bearers with a security policy
of \"UPIP required\" are not handed over to eNBs that do not support UPIP.
RRC signalling (TS 36.331 and TS 38.331) enables the use of UPIP with the UE
in both EN-DC and LTE-only configurations. As described in the LS from RAN2 to
SA3 in R2-2203663:
UPIP for the EPC connected architectures uses NR PDCP and is configured in
following way:
\- (as is done for legacy LTE UE) an LTE algorithm code point is configured in
field integrityProtectionAlgorithm in IE SecurityAlgorithmConfig in the TS
36.331 SecurityModeCommand message, and this is used to derive KUPint (and
also to derive KUPEnc, as for legacy LTE UE).
\- The NR algorithm code point (corresponding to the LTE algorithm code point
used in the SecurityModeCommand) indicated by the integrityProtAlgorithm
included in the securityConfig in the TS 38.331 RadioBearerConfig is used to
configure the UP IP algorithm applied by NR PDCP to perform integrity
protection.
\- The integrityProtection indicated in pdcp-Config in the DRB-ToAddMod(list)
in the TS 38.331 RadioBearerConfig is used to activate the UP IP for a DRB
using the configured algorithm, which can be done only at DRB setup.
Consequently, UP IP activation/deactivation for a DRB can be changed only by
DRB-release-and-add.

Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in SP-220426 (which replaced
CP-220150).
Non-seamless WLAN offload (NSWO) is an optional capability of a UE supporting
WLAN radio access. A UE supporting non-seamless WLAN offload may, while
connected to WLAN access, route specific IP flows via the WLAN access without
traversing the 3GPP core network.
For authentication 5G NSWO uses EAP-AKA\' as specified in IETF RFC 5448.
A new network function, called NSWOF, supports authentication for NSWO in 5GS.
The NSWOF interfaces the WLAN access network via SWa and the AUSF via the
Nausf service-based interface (SBI). The AUSF retrieves NSWO-specific
authentication information from the UDM via the Nudm service-based interface.
In addition, the USIM and/or ME can be configured to use 5G NSWO.
5G NSWO co-existence with EPS NSWO is considered. Also, different
configurations for NSWO roaming are described.

**GBA_5G** **S3** **SP-190714** **Vlasios Tsiatsis, Ericsson**
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-220321.
The existing Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) was firstly introduced
in Rel-6 and prior to Rel-17 the architecture included network functions
interacting with each other via dedicated reference point interfaces. The
integration of the Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) to the 5G Core
(5GC) introduces Service Based Interfaces (SBA) for the related GBA Network
Functions as well as specific GBA services for the User Data Management (UDM)
network function in 5GC. In this way GBA can be used in 5GC deployments.
The 3GPP authentication infrastructure employed in GBA includes Home Network
(HN) functions User Equipment (UE) functions and the 3GPP AKA (Authentication
and Key Agreement) protocol. This infrastructure is a very valuable asset of
3GPP operators and could be leveraged to enable application functions in the
network and on the User Equipment (UE) side to establish shared cryptographic
material based on 3GPP credentials. This is the motivation and purpose of the
Generic Bootstrapping Architecture (GBA) and GBA Push features developed in
3GPP since Rel-6.
The GBA architecture in releases prior to Rel-17 includes a Bootstrapping
Server Function (BSF) which is the anchor of the cryptographic key hierarchy,
the Home Subscriber System (HSS), which handles the user subscriptions and
provides authentication vectors to the BSF, UE applications and Network
Application Functions (NAFs). GBA includes a bootstrapping protocol for
authentication and key agreement for a root security key between the UE and
BSF and a framework of application session protocols (Ua protocols) to
establish an application security key between a UE and a NAF. The application
security key is derived from the bootstrapping key. The GBA Push feature
includes a protocol between the NAF and the UE in order to establish the
application security key with a more efficient message exchange suitable for
constrained devices. GBA is specified to support at least the following
Diameter-based reference point interfaces: (a) Zh between the BSF and HSS for
mutual authentication between the HN and the UE, (b) Zn between the BSF and
NAF for the application security key establishment and (c) Zpn between the BSF
and a GBA Push enabled NAF (Push-NAF) for a combined mutual authentication and
application security key establishment. The use of these interfaces has
allowed GBA to be used in 3G and also in 4G core networks since the HSS in 3G
and 4G supported Diameter-based interfaces.
With the advent of 5G, the 5G Core (5GC) has introduced Network Functions
which expose SBA interfaces and among other network functions a new
subscription management network function, the User Data Management (UDM).
Enabling GBA and GBA Push functionality to be used in 5GC, resulted in the
inclusion of the GBA and GBA Push functions in SBA as well as the
specification of the SBA interfaces for the BSF, HSS and UDM. More
specifically, a Service Based Interface (SBI) capable BSF exposes not only the
aforementioned reference point interfaces but also SBA interfaces towards an
SBI capable NAF. An SBI capable HSS provides an SBA interface for the BSF to
retrieve authentication vectors and other GBA related subscription information
for the GBA and GBA Push procedures. Finally, the UDM exposes a new service
operation for an SBI capable BSF to retrieve authentication vectors provided
by the UDM.

Summary based on the input provided by NTT DOCOMO in SP-220260.
Steering of roaming (SOR) allows the Home PLMN (HPLMN) operator to steer a UE
to a visited PLMN (VPLMN) on which the HPLMN wants the UE to register, when
the UE registers on another VPLMN. This capability may be needed for reasons
such as reselection to a higher priority PLMN based on business arrangements
(TS22.261 -- clause 6.30.1).
Steering of Roaming (SOR) is used since GSM, and the requirements are provided
in TS22.011.
In 5G, the Control Plane SOR solution (CP-SOR) was introduced using the same
requirements in TS22.011.
In Rel-17, additional requirements specific for CP-SOR were provided in
TS22.261 that allows the HPLMN to control the timing when a UE registered on a
VPLMN, in automatic mode (see clause 3.1 of TS 23.122 [25]) and currently in
CONNECTED mode, enters IDLE mode and initiates higher priority PLMN selection
based on the type of ongoing communication.
Upon receiving CP-SOR information defined in Rel-15 and Rel-16, while the UE
is in CONNECTED mode, the UE waits until it moves to idle mode before
performing SOR and attempting to obtain service on a higher priority PLMN.
The UEs in 5G may stay in connected mode for a rather long time, whole day or
longer, without going to idle mode. The HPLMN operator may have means to
evaluate what is more convenient to provide the service for the user (e.g.,
based on their subscription profile, more efficient economically from
wholesale perspective, allow users to use dedicated \"economical\" retail
plans on specific VPLMN, etc.) and decide which VPLMN is more appropriate for
the user to register on. Therefore, new requirements are introduced to allow
the HPLMN to enforce the interruption of the ongoing sessions for the sake of
performing SOR and moving the UE to another VPLMN to obtain service on a
higher priority PLMN.
This feature introduces means to send additional steering of roaming
information, called steering of roaming connected mode control information
(SOR-CMCI) that enables the HPLMN to control the timing of a UE in connected
mode to move to idle mode to perform the steering of roaming. The UE shall
support the SOR-CMCI. The support and use of SOR-CMCI by the HPLMN is based on
the HPLMN\'s operator policy.
The SOR-CMCI is provided by the HPLMN operator using different means, a
specific application function (SOR-AF) or the information can be stored in the
repository system (UDR). This information can be provided to the UE during
registration procedure or after the registration (triggered by some parameters
in the SOR-AF or the UDR).
The UE\'s type of ongoing communication / session(s) should be taken into
consideration. The high priority services and emergency services are exempted
from being interrupted (i.e. this feature is not applicable).
The new SOR related information is to be exchanged between the HPLMN UDM and
the UE in a secured manner therefore the HPLMN data management application
function ensures the security of the information using the Authentication
Server Function (AUSF). The SOR information is transparent for the VPLMN, and
if the VPLMN manipulates the information then the security of the information
will break. To ensure the security of the information, the HPLMN may request
the UE to provide an acknowledgement that the information is received
securely.
This feature is optional for the HPLMN. This means that if this optional
feature is not selected by the HPLMN operator, then there shall be no impact
on the existing SOR functionality.
This feature is applicable only when the UE is in automatic network selection
mode (see TS 23.122).

Summary based on the input provided by China Telecom in SP-220261.
Binding the Access and Mobility Management (AM) and the Session Management
(SM) policies provides several benefits, such as the change of RAT/Frequency
Selection Priority (RFSP) values for a UE when the quota for the Data Network
Name (DNN) for enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB) reaches the limit, or simplify
the network deployment. A simple way to achieve such binding is to select the
same Policy Control Function (PCF) for the AMF and the SMF.
In Rel 15 and 16, the same PCF selection for the AMF and the SMF is achieved
by the mechanism of AMF optionally forwarding the selected PCF to SMF
instance(s) during the PDU Session Establishment procedure(s), and the SMF may
select the received PCF for SM Policy Control based on local policies. But it
is applicable only in the UE initially accessing via 5GS scenario.
This Rel 17 work item specifies a mechanism to achieve the same PCF selection
for AMF and SMF in the EPS to 5GS mobility scenario, where the PCF selection
for AMF may be performed after the PCF selection for SMF/PGW-C. In this WI,
subscription data is expanded to assist the same PCF selection, to offer more
flexibility for operation of corresponding service.
The mechanism in this WI is based on the PGW-C+SMF registration of the
selected PCF for SM Policy Control into the UDM+HSS. When performing PCF
selection, based on subscription data for the PCF selection received from the
UDM, the AMF determines that the same PCF for AMF and the SMF serving a
specific DNN and/or S-NSSAI needs to be selected, then it selects the PCF ID
serving the specific DNN and/or S-NSSAI received from UDM before initiating
the Establishment of AM Policy Association. It is applicable for EPS to 5GS
Mobility.
For the scenario of pure 5GS, based on subscription data for the PCF selection
received from the UDM, the AMF determines that the same PCF for AMF and SMF
serving a specific DNN and/or S-NSSAI needs to be selected, then it forwards
the PCF ID for AM policies to the SMF and may additionally indicate to the SMF
that the same PCF should be selected for SM Policy Control.

## 17.5 Packet Flow Description management enhancement

880032 **Packet Flow Description (PFD) management enhancement** pfdManEnh C3
CP-210183 Xiaoyun Zhou, Huawei
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in CP-210183.
An optimize solution to reduce the load of signalling for pull mode in EPS and
5GS is defined. A notification push solution for push mode in 5GS is defined.
In stage 3, we define the GET method to retrieve the PFD for the
application(s) by the client, the server responds a whole representation of
the resource for the requested application identifier(s) even in the case that
the client requests the PFDs when the caching timer expires and the PFD(s) is
not changed at the server. It brings a large signalling load if the whole set
of the PFD(s) are always returned by considering that the number of the PFD(s)
is very large in the deployment.
For push mode, in order to protect the PCEF/TDF from overload, CT3 introduces
the notification push for the Push mode in EPS, i.e. the PFDF sends a request
with notification flag to the PCEF/TDF and then PCFE/TDF initiates separate
pull requests to retrieve the PFDs for different application identifier(s)
immediately or within the allowed-delay by considering the load of the
PCEF/TDF. But this optimized solution is not defined in 5GS.
CT3#110e decided to implement the solution to resolve the above identified
issues.

## 17.8 Enhancement of Handover Optimization
* * *
880029 **Enhancement of Handover Optimization** E_HOO S5 SP-200466 Elmdahl,
Per, Ericsson
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-220586.
This Work Item added management support for the optimization of Conditional
Handover (CHO) and Dual Active Protocol Stack (DAPS) handover. It gives the
operator the ability to control and observe CHO and DAPS handover. CHO and
DAPS HO were specified by RAN2 and RAN3 under the Work Item NR_Mob_enh-Core.
Conditional Handover (CHO) is a new feature defined by RAN2 and RAN3. CHO is
different from legacy handover in that the source cell may prepare handovers
to one or many target cells, but the execution of the handover is not done by
the source cell but by the UE.
Dual Active Protocol Stack (DAPS) handover is a new feature define by RAN2 and
RAN3. DAPS handover is different from legacy handover in that the UE sets up a
connection to the target cell before the connection to the source cell is
taken down, sometimes called \"make before break\".
For legacy handover, 3GPP SA5 have previously defined management support for
Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO), under the Self Organizing Network
(SON) umbrella.
The Enhancement of Handover Optimization Work Item has supplemented the
existing MRO management features with enhancements for CHO and DAPS handover.
These enhancements include support for configuring CHO and DAPS handover. This
support consists of enabling and disabling CHO and DAPS handover. Furthermore,
new Performance Measurements for CHO and DAPS handover were added. In
addition, a new Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for handover success rate was
specified. This new KPI includes legacy handover, CHO and DAPS handover.
For the configuration, Stage 1 is specified in TS 28.313 [1], and Stage 2 and
3 is specified in TS 28.541 [2]. For Performance Measurements, Stage 1 is in
TS 28.313 [1], and Stage 2 is in TS 28.552 [3]. For the new KPI, Stage 2 is in
TS 28.554 [4].

## 17.9 Restoration of Profiles related to UDR
* * *
940002 **Restoration of Profiles related to Unified Data Repository (UDR)**
ReP_UDR C4 CP-213070 Ishikawa, Hiroshi, NTT DOCOMO
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by NTT DOCOMO in CP-220343.
This Work Item enables restoration of profiles between UDR and related NF
consumers, to maintain the status up to date as much as possible even in case
data stored in UDR is lost or corrupted.
Data stored in UDR is automatically updated in normal operation. Some data is
stored in volatile storage units due to its nature, such as location of UE,
subscription data, policy data, and loss or corruption of storage containing
such data could negatively impact the service to subscribers. Replication of
volatile storage units and periodic back-up of data are used to avoid loss or
corruption, however further procedures are required in case the integrity of
data in UDR cannot be ensured, especially when relying on replicated data.
Following enhancements are specified to fulfil these required procedures:
\- Preparation of profile in NF consumers
\- Path and contents of notification sent from UDR to NF consumers when loss
or corruption at UDR is detected
\- Procedure for synchronization initiated by the NF consumer upon receiving
notification of loss or corruption

Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-220588.
Separate IP address pools are used in many enterprise use cases, general
management of network IP space resources and/or for UPF selection. This WI has
added support for providing IP pool information (\"IP Index\") from UDM to SMF
as part of a Session Management subscription data. The SMF can use the
subscriber\'s IP Index to assist in selecting how the IP address is to be
allocated when multiple allocation methods, or multiple instances of the same
method are supported. The IP Index can e.g. be used to select between
different IP pools. The feature is described in TS 23.501 [1], TS 23.502 [2]
and TS 29.503 [3].

Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-220589.
This function improves the dynamic handling of event configuration for
cancellation or adding of an individual member or a sub-set of members in a
group with active event configuration. The function is to ensure that event
cancellation/adding of some member(s) does not affect other members in the
group.
For a UE belonging to a group which has an active group-based event
configuration, the UE's event monitoring can be cancelled due to different
reasons (e.g. the UE is removed from the group by AS/AF, the UEs' subscription
is deleted from the HSS/UDM while monitoring is active, etc.). It's also
possible that AS or AF adds a new UE into an existing group which has active
event configuration.
The specifications are improved to specify that event configuration can be
updated with event cancellation/adding can be sent from AS/AF for individual
UE or a sub-set of the UEs (i.e. the external identifiers or MSISDNs of the
UEs) in a group which has an active event configuration.
The specifications also specify the event cancellation triggered by HSS/UDM
for induvial UE or sub-set of the UEs in a group. HSS/UDM informs AS/AF of
these individual UE or a sub-set of the UEs (i.e. the external identifiers or
MSISDNs of the UEs) via SCEF/NEF.
The function is described in TS 23.682, 23.502, TS 29.122, TS 29.336, TS
29.503, TS 29.518 and TS 29.522.

Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-220590.
This Work Item provides the capability for an Application Function (AF) to
request for a UE either service area coverage or the indication that high
throughput is desired or both. It specifies two methods:
a) The AF requests a service area coverage for the UE and/or indicates that
high throughput is desired, knowing that certain conditions are met, i.e., the
application traffic needs a change of service area coverage or high
throughput.
b) The AF provides the service area coverage and/or the indication that high
throughput is desired for one or multiple UEs that may or may not already be
registered or fulfil certain conditions related to application traffic.
In method a) the AF contacts the NEF then the NEF contacts the BSF to retrieve
the identity of the PCF serving the UE. In method b) the AF contacts the NEF
then the NEF stores the AF request in the UDR as Data Set \"Application Data\"
and Data Subset \"AM influence information\".
In both methods, the AF provides the service area coverage that the PCF takes
as input for policy decisions then to determine whether the service area
restrictions need to be updated. The AF provides the indication that high
throughput is desired that is considered by the PCF to decide if the RFSP
value index for a UE needs to be changed. The PCF reports to the AF that the
request was executed. The specification work applies for non-roaming
scenarios.

870030 **Enhanced Closed loop System Level Synthesis (SLS) Assurance** eCOSLA
S5 SP-200196 Groenendijk, Jan, Ericsson
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-220308.
This Work Item added enhancements to the Closed loop SLS Assurance solution
specified in TS 28.535 [1] and TS 28.536 [2]. The enhancements add more
advanced monitoring solutions that helps an operator to continuously deliver
the expected level of communication service quality when deploying a
NetworkSlice or a NetworkSliceSubnet.
A closed control loop automatically adjusts and optimizes the services
provided over an NG-RAN and 5GC network based on the various performance
management, QoE input data, and the state of the 5G network, using data
analytics. The solution has the following features:
  * it can have existing KPI's and measurements as input and make predictions and depending on the parameter(s) to be assured the appropriate KPI's and measurements can be obtained.
  * it can use existing provisioning capabilities to perform actions based on predicted goal status and depending on which network characteristics are predicted the appropriate actions can be provisioned
  * it can configure assurance goal by extraction of the appropriate parameter values from the ServiceProfile or SliceProfile of the NetworkSlice or NetworkSliceSubnet which service is assured.
  * it can collect the assurance goal status of a closed control loop based on domains and depending on which network characteristics are to be assured for a domain the appropriate actions can be provisioned.
  * it can ascertain the assurance goal status of a closed control loop > based on location and depending on which network characteristics > are to be assured the appropriate actions can be provisioned.
The solution separates the goals that a closed control loop needs to fulfil
from the results of the operation of a closed control loop. The results
(fulfilment status of a goal) for a closed control loop are provided in a
report including the observed fulfilment and predicted fulfilment. The goals
for a closed control loop are derived from the service requirements that are
specified in a ServiceProfile or SliceProfile.
To be able to deploy SLS assurance solutions the following objectives are
addressed:
  * Add new service assurance management related use cases and requirements according to deployment, assurance aspects.
  * Enhance the descriptions on closed loop and related interactions which are important for service assurance.
  * Describe new information in NRM which support the service assurance.
This work item resulted in several CRs to update the communication services
assurance solution specified in TS 28.535 [1] and TS 28.536 [2]

870027 **Enhancement of QoE Measurement Collection** eQoE S5 SP-200193
Petersen, Robert, Ericsson
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-220308.
This work item specifies Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection in
UMTS, LTE and 5G networks. It extended eQoE to support NR. It also added
Signalling Based Activation (SBA) for UTRAN and LTE functions. LTE is also
aligned with RAN specifications.
Functions that are added for NR includes: Management Based Activation (MBA),
Deactivation of QoE measurement collection job, temporary stop and restart
during RAN overload and new NR service Virtual Reality (VR). Signalling Based
Activation and Handling QoE measurement collection during handover are also
added.
Management Based Activation allows for QoE measurement collection from UEs in
a specified area. The operator has capability to deactivate the collection of
QoE measurement job. Temporary stop and restart during RAN overload: provides
capability to RAN that temporarily stops and restarts QoE measurement
reporting at RAN overload.
By supporting NR service Virtual Reality the QoE measurements for Virtual
Reality can also be collected. Signalling Based Activation provides capability
to request collection of end user service performance information for one
specific UE.
Signalling Based Activation is also added for UTRAN and LTE. Handling QoE
measurement collection during handover provides capability to handle QoE
measurement collection during handover.
QMCjob added to the network resource information to enable QoE measurement
collection between an Management Service (MnS) producer and Management Service
consumer in deployment scenarios using the Service Based Management.

## 18.4 Plug and connect support for management of Network Functions
* * *
910029 **Plug and connect support for management of Network Functions** PACMAN
S5 SP-210260 Per Elmdahl, Ericsson
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-210310.
This work item specifies Plug and Connect support for NFs. It extended Plug
and Connect (PnC) to support Service Based Architecture (SBMA). It added
support of IPv6, DHCPv6 and Dual stack and extended PnC to be useful for all
generations of NEs, e.g., NR and LTE. Support of virtualized nodes are not in
the scope of this work item.
PnC is the procedure by which a NE gets basic connectivity information after
it is powered up and gets connected to its management system.
After PnC, Self-Configuration procedures are used to complete Plug and Play
(PnP).
This work item only covers PnC. A new Rel-18 work item \"Self-configurations
of RAN NEs\" was created to document the self-configuration management of RAN
NEs of NR and future RAT technology if possible in the context of SBMA.
Prior to this work item, 3GPP PnP specifications do not support NR. Those
specifications restrict the PnP to eNB only. They also miss some updates from
IETF RFCs regarding IPv6 and DHCPv6 support.
There are three new specifications for PnC are created as result of this work
item. They are the full set of specifications covering stage 1 (TS 28.314),
stage 2 (TS 28.315), and stage 3 (TS 28.316) of PnC. The new specifications
added support of IPv6, DHCPv6 and dual stack for PnC and extended the PnC to
support SBMA. The restriction to PnC on eNB was removed, the scope of the PnC
is extended to support network element (NE) including LTE and NR radio network
nodes. Other types of nodes might also be compliant and use this PnC
procedure. The same level of security support as for eNB is provided in the
new specifications for NE.
This work item also removed PnC clauses for 5G from TS 28.313 and referred
them to the new specifications TS 28.314 and TS 28.315.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-220567.
Management of the enhanced tenant concept provides conceptual description on
tenant as MnS consumer in 3GPP management system. The management system is
required to provide management capability for reporting performance monitoring
and alarm notifications for the tenant based on management and orchestration
for network slicing.
The management and orchestration for network slicing supports performance
measurement per S-NSSAI (see TS 28.552) and alarm notification with slice
identifier(s). The clarification is provided in this work item, to provide the
conceptual description in 28.533 and TS 28.532 on how those management
information are provided by 3GPP management system to vertical MnS consumers.
So the clarifications to use MnS for performance monitoring and alarm
notifications are provided in TS 28.533, TS 28.532 and TS 28.552.
Management of the enhanced tenant concept provides some discussion and not
pursued change requests in network slice NRM on tenant information IOC and use
in slice NRM in TS 28.541. Those changes are related to the provisioning
service exposed to tenant MnS consumers, which are also in the scope of
ongoing R18 study item on management capability exposure in SA5.

Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-220568.
An intent driven system will be able to learn the behaviour of networks and
services and allows a customer to provide the desired state as intent (an
intent specifies the expectations including requirements, goals and
constraints for a specific service or network management workflow), without
detailed knowledge of how to get to the desired state. Thus, the intent driven
management is introduced to reduce the complexity of management without
getting into the intricate detail of the underlying network resources. This WI
specifies the concept, use cases, requirements and solutions for the intent
driven management for service or network management.

Summary based on the input provided by Ericsson in SP-220585.
This Work Item enables charging for roaming local breakout scenario. It also
supports some scenarios involving non-roaming MVNO (with its own CHF).
To support charging for roaming local breakout the following has been
introduced from the SMF in the visited MNO:
\- Collection of charging information for the purpose of wholesale charging
towards the home MNO
\- Collection of charging information and conveying it to the home MNO network
for the purpose of retail charging
Figure 1: 5G data connectivity converged charging architecture in Local
breakout scenario reference point representation
The N40 reference point is defined for the interactions between V-SMF and
V-CHF, the N47 reference point is defined for the interactions between V-SMF
and H-CHF, specified in TS 32.255 [2]. Wherever the V-SMF will use only N40,
or both N40 and N47, depends on agreement and SMF configuration. Both
reference points use the NchfConvergedCharging service, specified in TS 32.290
[3] and TS 32.291 [4], however online charging is only possible on the N47
when both N40 and N47 is used for the same chargeable data connectivity

Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in SP-220631.
In network management files are used for storing and transferring different
kinds of data (performance measurements, trace data, etc.). Files are
transferred between Network Functions and Management Functions or between
Management Functions, depending on the use case. Two different types of file
transfer are addressed:
â€¢ File retrieval from a MnS producer by a MnS consumer
â€¢ File download from a MnS consumer to a MnS producer
Fully standardized and interoperable solutions are provided. The solutions
follow a model driven approach, where only Network Resource Model (NRM)
fragments are standardized and the existing Create, Read, Update and Delete
(CRUD) operations are used.
Stage 1 requirements and use cases are specified in TS 28.537 [1].
Stage 2 definitions of the NRM fragments are specified in TS 28.622 [2].
Stage 3 definitions of the NRM fragments are specified in TS 28.623 [3].
For File retrieval the File retrieval NRM fragment is defined. Files are
represented by \"File\" objects that are contained in \"Files\" collections.
MnS consumers can retrieve the files using a normal Read operation.
Notifications are emitted upon creation of new \"File\" objects to inform
subscribed MnS consumers about the availability of new files for retrieval.
For File download the File download NRM fragment is defined. It contains the
definition of the \"FileDownloadJob\". The MnS consumer creates these objects
on the MnS producer to request the MnS producer to download a file from the
MnS consumer or some file server. The download job features a
\"ProgressMonitor\" allowing to monitor the progress of the file download.
After completion of the file download the job object is deleted.

Summary based on the input provided by Nokia in SP-220841.
This work item enhances existing and specifies new methods for controlling
management data production, collection, coordination, and discovery.
Management data includes data from RAN network functions, core network
functions and UEs.
In this work item, requirements for producing, reporting, storing and
discovery of management data are specified in TS 28.537[1].
Besides the existing data collection jobs, where the management data is
requested from specific target managed object instances based on the managed
object tree (as defined in the SA5 Network Resource Models), this WI
introduces a method to request management data based on one or multiple
selection criteria namely area of interest (list of cells, list of tracking
areas or geographical area), domain (RAN or Core), traffic type (user plane or
control plane) or slice type (e.g. eMBB, URLLC), see TS 28.622[2], TS
28.623[3]. The introduced data collection job allows to request for Trace
data, MDT (Minimization of Drive Test) data, RLF (Radio Link Failure) reports,
RCEF (RRC Connection Establishment Failure) reports, PM (performance
measurements), KPI (end-to-end key performance indicators) or a combination of
these. Furthermore, the management production can be requested for a certain
time window.
In the context of management data discovery, the supported management data
which can be provided by a network function has been enhanced to include trace
metrics besides performance metrics. In this context the metric identifier for
trace metrics, covering Immediate MDT, Logged MDT, Logged MBSFN MDT, Trace,
RLF reports and RCEF reports, has been introduced in TS 32.422[4].
The methods of file-based reporting of performance metrics are enhanced to
allow implicit notification subscriptions for notifyFileReady notifications
indicating the availability of new performance metric reports, see TS
28.622[2], TS 28.623[3].

900022 Study on Charging Aspect of 5G LAN-type Services FS_5GLAN_CH S5
SP-201081 CHEN SHAN, Huawei
* * *
Summary based on the input provided by Huawei in SP-220572.
Note: Although Studies are usually not reported in this document, it was
estimated by the rapporteur that this study deserves a summary.
As per the 5G LAN-type service requirements specified in TS 22.261 and the 5G
LAN-type Services specified in the TS 23.501 and TS 23.502, the 5G Virtual
Network (VN) group consists of a set of UEs using private communication for 5G
LAN-type services. The WID 5GLAN_CH specifies the charging principle, charging
requirements, service operations and charging information for 5G VN group
service charging, including:
\- 5G VN group management charging: NEF and CEF support the group management
(e.g. creation, modification and deletion) charging in TS 32.254.
\- 5G VN group communication charging: SMF supports the charging information
collection and reporting per PDU session in TS 32.255.
The corresponding Open API and ASN.1 for 5G LAN VN group service charging are
specified in the TS 32.291 and TS 32.298.
