# Introduction
This document presents the possible architectures of the 3GPP System covering
both UTRAN and GERAN radio access technologies. In addition, this document
also includes the Evolved Packet System providing support for E-UTRAN radio
access technology in addition to UTRAN and GERAN radio access technologies. As
well as providing support for E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN radio access
technologies, the Evolved Packet System also provides support for non-3GPP
access technologies making it possible for these technologies to interwork
with the 3GPP specified Evolved Packet Core network. The configuration of
non-3GPP access networks using EPS is not within the scope of 3GPP
specification.
This document also presents the architecture for the IP Multimedia Subsystem
common to 3GPP and other access systems such as Fixed Broadband and those
specified by 3GPP2 and provide architecture for interworking and session
continuity between IMS and Circuit Switched systems.
Clause 3 of the document contains the definition of the PLMN entities.
Clause 4 of the document contains the description of the basic entities of the
PLMN, and clause 4a contains the description of the specific entities of the
PLMN.
Clause 5 of the document contains the configuration of the PLMN.
Clauses 6, 6a and 7 of the document contain the PLMN\'s basic and specific
interfaces and reference points and the PLMN\'s interfaces towards other
networks.
# 1 Scope
This document offers an overview of the 3GPP PLMN and its architectures and
configuration. The configuration and the functional entities of the PLMN and
the interfaces between them are described on a general level in order to cope
with possible implementations. These descriptions include interfaces between
and within the core networks, the access networks, the user equipment,
different service platforms, different domains and subsystems, and functional
entities within domains and subsystems.
This document covers different architectural aspects with varying level of
detail. In general, other specifications shall be referred to for further
details; these specifications enable the reader to acquire the full
understanding of a system or service feature.
Note that this document does not cover, or even list, all features of PLMNs.
# 2 References

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
In addition to the abbreviations given in the remainder of this clause others
are listed in TR 21.905 [1a].
The definitions of the entities of the mobile system are given in the next
clause.
## 3.1 Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN)
A Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) is established and operated by an
administration or Recognized Private Operating Agency (RPOA) for the specific
purpose of providing land mobile telecommunications service services to the
public. A PLMN may be regarded as an extension of networks (e.g. ISDN,
corporate and public PDNs, etc.); it is a collection of MSCs areas in CS
domain and SGSN areas for GPRS and SGSN or MME areas for EPC in PS domain
within a common numbering plan (e.g. same National Destination Code) and a
common routing plan. The MSCs are the functional interfaces between the fixed
networks and a PLMN for call set-up in CS domain. The GGSN and the SGSN are
the functional interfaces between the fixed networks and a PLMN for packet
transmission in GPRS PS domain. In case of EPC PS Domain, the PDN GW, Serving-
GW and the SGSN and the MME are the functional interfaces between the fixed
networks and a PLMN for packet transmission.
Functionally the PLMNs may be regarded as independent telecommunications
entities even though different PLMNs may be interconnected through the
ISDN/PSTN and PDNs for forwarding of calls or network information. A similar
type of interconnection may exist for the interaction between the
MSCs/SGSNs/MMEs of one PLMN.
## 3.2 Core Network (CN) and Access Network (AN)
The PLMN infrastructure is logically divided into a Core Network (CN) and an
Access Network (AN) infrastructures, as defined in TS 23.101 [11a] and TS
23.110 [11b]. The CN is logically divided into a CS domain, a PS domain and an
IM subsystem, as defined in next clause. The AN are GERAN (also called BSS for
GSM), UTRAN (also called RNS), E-UTRAN, as defined in clause \"The Access
Network\".
## 3.3 Circuit Switched (CS) and Packet Switched (PS) Domains
The CN is constituted of a Circuit Switched (CS) domain and a Packet Switched
(PS) domain (which includes GPRS and EPC). These two domains differ by the way
they support user traffic, as explained below.
These two domains are overlapping, i.e. they contain some common entities. A
PLMN can implement only one domain or both domains.
### 3.3.1 CS Domain
The CS domain refers to the set of all the CN entities offering \"CS type of
connection\" for user traffic as well as all the entities supporting the
related signalling. A \"CS type of connection\" is a connection for which
dedicated network resources are allocated at the connection establishment and
released at the connection release.
The entities specific to the CS domain are: MSC, GMSC, VLR. All the other CN
entities defined in clause 4 \"The basic entities of the mobile system\" and
not defined as PS domain specific entities (see following clause) are common
to the CS and to the PS domains. In case of E-UTRAN access, there is no
support for CS Domain.
### 3.3.2 PS Domain
The PS domain refers to the set of all the CN entities offering \"PS type of
connection\" for user traffic as well as all the entities supporting the
related signalling. A \"PS type of connection\" transports the user
information using autonomous concatenation of bits called packets: each packet
can be routed independently from the previous one.
The entities specific to the PS domain are the GPRS specific entities, i.e.
SGSN and GGSN and EPS specific entities, i.e. PDN GW, S-GW, MME, SGSN. All the
other CN entities defined in clause \"4 The basic entities of the mobile
system\" and not defined as CS domain specific entities (see previous clause)
are common to the CS and to the PS domains.
### 3.3a IP Multimedia subsystem (IMS)
The IM subsystem comprises all CN elements for provision of IP multimedia
services comprising audio, video, text, chat, etc. and a combination of them
delivered over the PS domain. The entities related to IMS are CSCF, MGCF, MRF,
etc. as defined in the stage 2 of the IM subsystem TS 23.228 [34]. See TS
22.228 [27] for some service examples of IMS.
## 3.4 Location register
To enable communication to a mobile station the network must know where this
mobile station is located. This information is stored in a function named
location register.
The location register is handled by the following entities.
\- The Home Location Register (HLR).
The Home Location Register (HLR) is the location register to which a mobile
subscriber is assigned for record purposes such as subscriber information. For
EPS, the HLR functionality is provided via HSS.
\- The Visitor Location Register (VLR).
The Visitor Location Register (VLR) is the location register for Circuit
Switched (CS) services, other than the HLR, used by an MSC to retrieve
information for, e.g. handling of calls to or from a roaming mobile station
currently located in its area.
\- The Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN).
The location register function in the SGSN stores subscription information and
location information for Packet Switched (PS) services for each subscriber
registered in the SGSN.
The SGSN is needed only in a PLMN which supports PS Domain with GERAN or UTRAN
access.
\- The Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN).
The location register function in the GGSN stores subscriber information and
routeing information (needed to tunnel packet data traffic destined for a GPRS
MS to the SGSN where the MS is registered) for each subscriber for which the
GGSN has at least one PDP context active.
The GGSN is needed only in a PLMN which supports GPRS with GERAN or UTRAN
access.
\- The Mobility Management Entity (MME).
The location register function in the MME stores subscription information and
location information for Packet Switched (PS) services for each subscriber
registered in the MME for EPS.
\- The Packet Data Network Gateway (PDN GW).
The location register function in the PDN GW stores subscriber information and
routeing information (needed to tunnel packet data traffic destined for an EPS
UE to the Serving GW, where the UE is registered in the MME, in the SGSN or in
the 3GPP AAA server in case of non-3GPP access) for each subscriber for which
the PDN GW has at least one PDN connection active.
## 3.5 Cell
The cell is an area of radio coverage identified by a Base station
identification as defined in TS 23.003 [3].
## 3.6 Base Station Controller (BSC) area
The Base Station Controller (BSC) area is an area of radio coverage consisting
of one or more cells controlled by one BSC. The boundaries of a BSC area and a
location area are independent; a location area may span the boundary between
BSC area and a BSC area may span the boundary between location areas.
## 3.7 Radio Network Controller (RNC) area
The Radio Network Controller (RNC) area is an area of radio coverage
consisting of one or more cells controlled by one RNC. The boundaries of a RNC
area and a location area are independent; a location area may span the
boundary between RNC area and a RNC area may span the boundary between
location areas.
## 3.8 Location Area (LA)
The Location Area (LA) is defined as an area in which a mobile station may
move freely without updating the VLR. A location area includes one or several
GERAN/UTRAN cells.
## 3.9 Routing Area (RA)
The Routing Area (RA) is defined as an area in which a mobile station, in
certain operation modes, may move freely without updating the SGSN. A routing
area includes one or several GERAN/UTRAN cells. A RA is always contained
within a location area.
## 3.9a Tracking Area (TA)
A Tracking Area (TA) includes one or several E-UTRAN cells. The network
allocates a list with one or more TAs to the UE . In certain operation modes,
the UE may move freely in all TAs of the list without updating the MME.
## 3.10 MSC area
The MSC area is the part of the network covered by an MSC. An MSC area may
consist of one or several location areas. An MSC area may also consist of one
or several BSC areas.
## 3.11 VLR area
The VLR area is the part of the network controlled by a VLR. A VLR area may
consist of one or several MSC areas.
## 3.12 SGSN area
The SGSN area is the part of the network served by an SGSN. An SGSN area may
consist of one or several routing areas. An SGSN area may also consist of one
or several BSC areas. There need not be a one to one relationship between SGSN
area and MSC/VLR area.
## 3.13 Zones for Regional Subscription
A PLMN operator may define a number of regional subscription areas, each of
which is a subset of the service area for an unrestricted mobile subscriber. A
regional subscription area may be contained within the service area of a
single PLMN, or may lie within the service areas of two or more PLMNs. Each
regional subscription area consists of one or more zones; each zone is
contained within the service area of a PLMN.
The definition of a mobile subscriber\'s regional subscription area is stored
within the HLR/HSS per National Destination Code(s) (NDC) of a PLMN and is
transferred to the VLRs and/or SGSNs/MMEs of that PLMN. The VLR and/or
SGSN/MME evaluates this information to extract the restricted or accessible
MSC and/or SGSN/MME areas and location areas to which the mobile subscriber is
allowed to roam. The VLR and/or SGSN/MME inform the HLR/HSS if an entire MSC
and/or SGSN/MME area is restricted.
Zones for Regional Subscription and their handling are defined in TS 23.003
[3], TS 23.008 [5] and TS 29.002 [26] and TS 29.272 [86] for EPC.
## 3.14 Service area
The service area is defined as an area in which a mobile subscriber can be
reached by another (mobile or fixed) subscriber without the subscriber\'s
knowledge of the actual location of the mobile station within the area. A
service area may consist of several PLMNs. One service area may consist of one
country, be a part of a country or include several countries. The location
registration system associated with each service area must thus contain a list
of all mobile stations located within that service area.
## 3.15 Group call area
The group call area is a predefined area composed of one or a number of cells
to which a particular Voice Group Call Service (VGCS) or Voice Broadcast
Service (VBS) call is distributed. The composition of a group call area is
predefined in the network. The group call area may include cells of more than
one MSC area and cells of more than one PLMN.
## 3.15a MME Area
The MME area is the part of the network served by an MME. An MME area consists
of one or several Tracking Areas. All cells served by an eNodeB are included
in an MME Area. There is no one to one relationship between an MME Area and an
MSC/VLR area. Multiple MMEs may have the same MME Area as described in clause
\"Pool-area\". MME Areas may overlap each other.
## 3.16 Pool-area
A pool area is an area where Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple
CN Nodes is applied. Within a pool-area an MS may roam without need to change
the serving Core Network (CN) node. A pool-area is served by one or more CN
nodes in parallel.
## 3.17 Serving GW Service Area
A Serving GW Service Area is the part of the network served by single Serving
GW. Serving GW Service Areas consist of one or several complete Tracking
Areas. All cells served by an eNodeB are included in an Serving GW Service
Area .Serving GW Service Areas may overlap each other. There is no one to one
relationship between an MME Area and a Serving GW Service Area.
# 4 The basic entities of the mobile system
To provide the mobile service as it is defined, it is necessary to introduce
some specific functions. These functional entities can be implemented in
different equipment or gathered. In any case, exchanges of data occur between
these entities.
Entities in the mobile system can be either implemented in a monolithic way
where user data are stored within the entity itself (or in an external entity
via non-standard interfaces) or according to the User Data Convergence (UDC)
concept (see TS 23.335 [120]) where the entity becomes a so-called user-
dataless Application Front End (AFE). Application Front Ends access, via the
Ud reference point, a User Data Repository (UDR), which stores the relevant
user data managed by the applications. Unless explicitly stated otherwise,
this document describes entities in its monolithic form, e.g. stating that
user data are stored in the HSS. If however the UDC concept applies, user data
are actually stored in the UDR and managed by one or several Application Front
Ends, so that user data may be shared among the different Application Front
Ends, allowing several AFEs of the same application type (e.g. HSS) to serve
the same user at any given time.
For the 5G System, see clause 4a.38.
## 4.1 The Core Network (CN) entities
### 4.1.1 Entities common to the PS and CS domains
#### 4.1.1.1 The Home Subscriber Server (HSS)
The HSS is the master database for a given user. It is the entity containing
the subscription-related information to support the network entities actually
handling calls/sessions.
A Home Network may contain one or several HSSs: it depends on the number of
mobile subscribers, on the capacity of the equipment and on the organisation
of the network.
As an example, the HSS provides support to the call control servers in order
to complete the routing/roaming procedures by solving authentication,
authorisation, naming/addressing resolution, location dependencies, etc.
The HSS is responsible for holding the following user related information:
\- User Identification, Numbering and addressing information;
\- User Security information: Network access control information for
authentication and authorization;
\- User Location information at inter-system level: the HSS supports the user
registration, and stores inter-system location information, etc.;
\- User profile information.
The HSS also generates User Security information for mutual authentication,
communication integrity check and ciphering.
Based on this information, the HSS also is responsible to support the call
control and session management entities of the different Domains and
Subsystems (defined in clauses 3.3 and 3.3a) of the operator as shown in
figure 0-a.
Figure 0-a: Example of a Generic HSS structure and basic interfaces
The HSS may integrate heterogeneous information, and enable enhanced features
in the core network to be offered to the application & services domain, at the
same time hiding the heterogeneity.
The HSS consists of the following functionalities:
\- IP multimedia functionality to provide support to control functions of the
IM subsystem such as the CSCF. It is needed to enable subscriber usage of the
IM CN subsystem services. This IP multimedia functionality is independent of
the access network used to access the IM CN subsystem.
\- The subset of the HLR/AUC functionality required by the PS Domain (GPRS and
EPC).
\- The subset of the HLR/AUC functionality required by the CS Domain, if it is
desired to enable subscriber access to the CS Domain or to support roaming to
legacy GSM/UMTS CS Domain networks.
The organisation of the subscriber data is outlined in TS 23.008 [5]. It also
indicates which numbers, addresses and identifiers specified in TS 23.003 [3]
are stored in HSS.
##### 4.1.1.1.1 The Home Location Register (HLR)
The HLR is shown in the Reference Architecture up to and including Rel‑4.
The HLR can be considered a subset of the HSS that holds the following
functionality:
\- The functionality required to provide support to PS Domain entities such as
the SGSN, MME and GGSN, through the Gr, S6a, S6dand Gc interfaces and the 3GPP
AAA Server for EPS in case of non-3GPP access via SWx and for the I-WLAN
through the D\'/Gr\' interface. It is needed to enable subscriber access to
the PS Domain services.
\- The functionality required to provide support to CS Domain entities such as
the MSC/MSC server and GMSC/GMSC server, through the C and D interfaces. It is
needed to enable subscriber access to the CS Domain services and to support
roaming to legacy GSM/UMTS CS Domain networks.
##### 4.1.1.1.2 The Authentication Centre (AuC)
The AuC is shown in the Reference Architecture up to and including Rel-4.
The AuC can be considered a subset of the HSS that holds the following
functionality for the CS Domain and PS Domain:
\- The AuC is associated with an HLR and stores an identity key for each
mobile subscriber registered with the associated HLR. This key is used to
generate security data for each mobile subscriber:
\- data which are used for mutual authentication of the International Mobile
Subscriber Identity (IMSI) and the network;
\- a key used to check the integrity of the communication over the radio path
between the mobile station and the network;
\- a key used to cipher communication over the radio path between the mobile
station and the network.
\- The AuC communicates only with its associated HLR over a non-standardised
interface denoted the H-interface. The HLR requests the data needed for
authentication and ciphering from the AuC via the H-interface, stores them and
delivers them to the VLR and SGSN and MME which need them to perform the
security functions for a mobile station.
##### 4.1.1.1.3 HSS logical functions
This clause provides a high level and not exhaustive description of HSS
functionality.
Figure 0.b: HSS logical functions
\- Mobility Management
This function supports the user mobility through CS Domain, PS Domain and IM
CN subsystem.
\- Call and/or session establishment support
The HSS supports the call and/or session establishment procedures in CS
Domain, PS Domain and IM CN subsystem. For terminating traffic, it provides
information on which call and/or session control entity currently hosts the
user.
\- User security information generation
\- The HSS generates user authentication, integrity and ciphering data for the
CS and PS Domains and for the IM CN subsystem. User security support
The HSS supports the authentication procedures to access CS Domain, PS Domain
and IM CN subsystem services by storing the generated data for authentication,
integrity and ciphering and by providing these data to the appropriate entity
in the CN (i.e. MSC/VLR, SGSN, MME, 3GPP AAA Server or CSCF).
\- User identification handling
The HSS provides the appropriate relations among all the identifiers uniquely
determining the user in the system: CS Domain, PS Domain and IM CN subsystem
(e.g. IMSI and MSISDNs for CS Domain; IMSI, MSISDNs and IP addresses for PS
Domain, private identity and public identities for IM CN subsystem).
\- Access authorisation
The HSS authorises the user for mobile access when requested by the MSC/VLR,
SGSN, MME, 3GPP AAA Server or CSCF, by checking that the user is allowed to
roam to that visited network.
\- Service authorisation support
The HSS provides basic authorisation for MT call/session establishment and
service invocation. Besides, the HSS updates the appropriate serving entities
(i.e., MSC/VLR, SGSN, MME, 3GPP AAA Server, CSCF) with the relevant
information related to the services to be provided to the user.
\- Service Provisioning Support
\- The HSS provides access to the service profile data for use within the CS
Domain, PS Domain and/or IM CN subsystem. Application Services and CAMEL
Services Support (for GERAN and UTRAN access).
The HSS communicates with the SIP Application Server and the OSA-SCS to
support Application Services in the IM CN subsystem. It communicates with the
IM-SSF to support the CAMEL Services related to the IM CN subsystem. The IMS
CAMEL subscription data may be transferred to the IM-SSF AS using Sh reference
point in addition to the Si reference point. The HSS communicates with the
gsmSCF to support CAMEL Services in the CS Domain and GPRS PS Domain (for
GERAN and UTRAN access).
Editor\'s note: CAMEL support for GERAN/UTRAN via EPS (i.e. for S4 SGSN) is
FFS.
\- GUP Data Repository
The HSS supports the storage of IM CN Subsystem user related data, and
provides access to these data through the Rp reference point as described in
TS 23.240 [71].
#### 4.1.1.2 The Visitor Location Register (VLR)
A mobile station roaming in an MSC area or within a GERAN/UTRAN pool-area is
controlled by a Visitor Location Register. When a Mobile Station (MS) enters a
new location area it starts a registration procedure. An MSC in charge of that
area notices this registration and transfers to a Visitor Location Register
the identity of the location area where the MS is situated. If this MS is not
yet registered in the VLR, the VLR and the HLR exchange information to allow
the proper handling of CS calls involving the MS.
A VLR may be in charge of one or several MSC areas.
The VLR contains also the information needed to handle the calls set-up or
received by the MSs registered in its data base (for some supplementary
services the VLR may have to obtain additional information from the HLR). The
following elements are included:
\- the International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI);
\- the Mobile Station International ISDN number (MSISDN);
\- the Mobile Station Roaming Number (MSRN), see TS 23.003 [3] for allocation
principles;
\- the Temporary Mobile Station Identity (TMSI), if applicable;
\- the Local Mobile Station Identity (LMSI), if used;
\- the location area where the mobile station has been registered;
\- the identity of the SGSN where the MS has been registered. Only applicable
to PLMNs supporting GPRS and which have a Gs interface between MSC/VLR and
SGSN;
\- the last known location and the initial location of the MS;
\- the identity of the MME where the MS has been registered. Only applicable
to PLMNs supporting EPC and CS Fallback and which have a SGs interface between
MSC/VLR and MME.
The VLR also contains supplementary service parameters attached to the mobile
subscriber and received from the HLR. The organisation of the subscriber data
is outlined in TS 23.008 [5].
#### 4.1.1.3 (void)
#### 4.1.1.4 The Equipment Identity Register (EIR)
The Equipment Identity Register (EIR) in the GSM system is the logical entity
which is responsible for storing in the network the International Mobile
Equipment Identities (IMEIs), used in the GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN system.
The equipment is classified as \"allowed\", \"tracked\", \"prohibited\" or it
may be unknown as specified in TS 22.016 [2] and TS 29.002 [26].
This functional entity contains one or several databases which store(s) the
IMEIs used in the system.
The mobile equipment may be classified as \"allowed\", \"tracked\" and
\"prohibited\" and therefore may be stored in three separate lists.
An IMEI may also be unknown to the EIR.
An EIR shall as a minimum contain an \"allowed list\" (Equipment classified as
\"allowed\").
See also TS 22.016 [2] on IMEI.
#### 4.1.1.5 SMS Gateway MSC (SMS-GMSC)
The SMS Gateway MSC (SMS-GMSC) acts as an interface between a Short Message
Service Centre and the PLMN, to allow short messages to be delivered to mobile
stations from the Service Centre (SC).
The choice of which MSCs can act as SMS Gateway MSCs is a network operator
matter (e.g. all MSCs or some designated MSCs).
#### 4.1.1.6 SMS Interworking MSC (SMS-IWMSC)
The SMS Interworking MSC acts as an interface between the PLMN and a Short
Message Service Centre (SC) to allow short messages to be submitted from
Mobile Stations to the SC.
The choice of which MSCs can act as SMS Interworking MSCs is a network
operator matter (e.g. all MSCs or some designated MSCs).
#### 4.1.1.7 Subscription Locator Function (SLF)
The SLF:
\- Is queried by the I‑CSCF during the Registration and Session Setup to get
the name of the HSS containing the required subscriber specific data.
Furthermore the SLF is also queried by the S‑CSCF during the Registration.
\- Is queried by the AS in conjunction with the Sh interface operation to get
the name of the HSS containing the required subscriber specific data.
\- Is queried by the 3GPP AAA server to get the name of the HSS containing the
required subscriber specific data.
\- Is accessed via the Dx interface by the CSCF, via the Dh interface by the
AS, and via the Dw interface by the 3GPP AAA Server.
The SLF is not required in a single HSS environment. An example for a single
HSS environment is a server farm architecture. Use of SLF is not required when
AS are configured/managed to use pre-defined HSS.
### 4.1.2 Entities of the CS domain
#### 4.1.2.1 The Mobile-services Switching Centre (MSC)
The Mobile-services Switching Centre (MSC) constitutes the interface between
the radio system and the fixed networks. The MSC performs all necessary
functions in order to handle the circuit switched services to and from the
mobile stations.
In order to obtain radio coverage of a given geographical area, a number of
BSS and/or RNS are normally required; i.e. each MSC would thus have to
interface to one or more BSS(s) and/or RNS(s). In addition several MSCs may be
required to cover a country.
When Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes is applied, all
the MSCs serving a pool-area share the responsibility to serve the MSs located
in the pool-area. All these MSCs interface to all the BSS(s) and/or RNS(s)
forming the pool-area.
The Mobile-services Switching Centre is an exchange, which performs all the
switching and signalling functions for mobile stations located in a
geographical area designated as the MSC area. When Intra Domain Connection of
RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes is applied, one or more MSCs serve a pool-area,
but each individual MS is served by only one out of these MSCs, as described
in TS 23.236 [65]. The main difference between a MSC and an exchange in a
fixed network is that the MSC has to take into account the impact of the
allocation of radio resources and the mobile nature of the subscribers and has
to perform in addition, at least the following procedures:
\- procedures required for the location registration (see TS 23.012 [7]);
\- procedures required for handover (see TS 23.009 [6]).
NOTE: When this improves the readability (e.g. when dealing with inter-
releases handover), the term 2G-MSC can be used to refer to an MSC Release 98
or prior, and the term 3G-MSC can be used to refer to an MSC Release 99 or
later.
When needed, the MSC can be implemented in two different entities: the MSC
Server, handling only signalling, and the CS-MGW, handling user\'s data. A MSC
Server and a CS-MGW make up the full functionality of a MSC.
The CS fallback enabled MSC supports the following additional functions
according to TS 23.272 [81]:
\- Maintaining SGs association towards MME for EPS/IMSI attached UE;
\- Supporting SMS procedures according to CS Fallback.
##### 4.1.2.1.1 MSC Server
The MSC Server mainly comprises the call control (CC) and mobility control
parts of a MSC.
The MSC Server is responsible for the control of mobile originated and mobile
terminated CC CS Domain calls. It terminates the user-network signalling and
translates it into the relevant network - network signalling. The MSC Server
also contains a VLR to hold the mobile subscriber\'s service data and CAMEL
related data.
The MSC Server controls the parts of the call state that pertain to connection
control for media channels in a CS-MGW.
An MSC Server which has been enhanced for SRVCC provides the following
functions as needed for support of SRVCC according to TS 23.216 [83]:
\- Handling the Relocation Preparation procedure requested for the voice
component from MME via Sv interface;
\- Invoking the session transfer procedure from IMS to CS ;
\- Coordinating the CS Handover and session transfer procedures;
\- Handling the MAP_Update_Location procedure without it being triggered from
the UE.
If a MSC Server is enhanced for IMS Centralized Services (as defined in TS
23.292 [110]), it is responsible for the CS to IMS interworking, and it
terminates the user-network signalling received over the CS access (A/Iu and E
interface) and translates it into SIP signalling in IMS and vice versa.
##### 4.1.2.1.2 Circuit Switched - Media Gateway Function (CS-MGW)
NOTE: In this document the term Media Gateway Function (MGW) is used when
there is no need to differentiate between the CS domain entity and the IP
Multimedia CN Subsystem entity. When referring specifically to the CS domain
entity the term CS-MGW is used. When referring specifically to the IP
Multimedia CN Subsystem entity, the term IMS-MGW is used.
This component is PSTN/PLMN transport termination point for a defined network
and interfaces UTRAN with the core network over Iu.
A CS-MGW may terminate bearer channels from a switched circuit network and
media streams from a packet network (e.g. RTP streams in an IP network). Over
Iu, the CS-MGW may support media conversion, bearer control and payload
processing (e.g. codec, echo canceller, conference bridge) for support of
different Iu options for CS services (AAL2/ATM based as well as RTP/UDP/IP
based).
The CS-MGW:
\- Interacts with MGCF, MSC server and GMSC server for resource control.
\- Owns and handles resources such as echo cancellers etc.
\- May need to have Codecs.
The CS-MGW will be provisioned with the necessary resources for supporting
UMTS/GSM transport media. Further tailoring (i.e. packages) of the H.248 [52]
may be required to support additional Codecs and framing protocols, etc.
The CS-MGW bearer control and payload processing capabilities will also need
to support mobile specific functions such as SRNS relocation/handover and
anchoring. It is expected that current H.248 [52] standard mechanisms can be
applied to enable this.
#### 4.1.2.2 The Gateway MSC (GMSC)
If a network delivering a call to the PLMN cannot interrogate the HLR, the
call is routed to an MSC. This MSC will interrogate the appropriate HLR and
then route the call to the MSC where the mobile station is located. The MSC
which performs the routing function to the actual location of the MS is called
the Gateway MSC (GMSC).
The acceptance of an interrogation to an HLR is the decision of the operator.
The choice of which MSCs can act as Gateway MSCs is for the operator to decide
(i.e. all MSCs or some designated MSCs).
If the call is a voice group/broadcast call, it is routed directly from the
GMSC to the VBS/VGCS Anchor MSC, based on information (VBS/VGCS call
reference) contained in the dialled number (see also TS 43.068 [41] and TS
43.069 [42]).
Editor\'s note: There is a need to consider possibilities that call incoming
to the PLMN may be routed to entities other than the GMSC, e.g., for networks
that do not deploy CS domain.
When needed, the GMSC can be implemented in two different entities: the GMSC
Server, handling only signalling, as defined below, and the CS-MGW, defined
above. A GMSC Server and a CS-MGW make up the full functionality of a GMSC.
##### 4.1.2.2.1 Gateway MSC Server (GMSC Server)
The GMSC server mainly comprises the call control and mobility control parts
of a GMSC.
#### 4.1.2.3 The Interworking Function (IWF)
The Interworking Function (IWF) is a functional entity associated with the
MSC. The IWF provides the functionality necessary to allow interworking
between a PLMN and the fixed networks (ISDN, PSTN and PDNs). The functions of
the IWF depend on the services and the type of fixed network. The IWF is
required to convert the protocols used in the PLMN to those used in the
appropriate fixed network. The IWF may have no functionality where the service
implementation in the PLMN is directly compatible with that at the fixed
network. The interworking functions are described in TS 29.007 [31].
### 4.1.3 Entities of the GPRS PS domain
The UTRAN/GERAN PS-domain (or GPRS) Support Nodes (GSN) are the Gateway GSN
(GGSN) and the Serving GSN (SGSN). They constitute the interface between the
radio system and the fixed networks for packet switched services. The GSN
performs all necessary functions in order to handle the packet transmission to
and from the mobile stations.
#### 4.1.3.1 Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN)
The location register function in the SGSN stores two types of subscriber data
needed to handle originating and terminating packet data transfer:
\- subscription information:
\- the IMSI;
\- one or more temporary identities;
\- zero or more PDP addresses.
\- location information:
\- depending on the operating mode of the MS, the cell or the routeing area
where the MS is registered;
\- the VLR number of the associated VLR (if the Gs interface is implemented);
\- the GGSN address of each GGSN for which an active PDP context exists.
The SGSN .provide support for Direct Tunnel functions as specified in TS
23.060 [9a].
The organisation of the subscriber data in the SGSN is defined in TS 23.008
[5] and TS 23.060 [9a].
The procedures for information transfer between the SGSN, the GGSN, the VLR
and the HLR are defined in TS 23.016 [39] and TS 23.060 [9a].
NOTE: When this improves the readability (e.g. when dealing with inter-
releases handover), the term 2G-SGSN can be used to refer to a SGSN Release 98
or prior, and the term 3G-SGSN can be used to refer to a SGSN Release 99 or
later.
The SGSN provides support for SRVCC functions as specified in TS 23.216 [83].
#### 4.1.3.2 Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN)
The location register function in the GGSN stores subscriber data received
from the HLR and the SGSN. There are two types of subscriber data needed to
handle originating and terminating packet data transfer:
\- subscription information:
\- the IMSI;
\- zero or more PDP addresses.
\- location information:
\- the SGSN address for the SGSN where the MS is registered.
The organisation of the subscriber data in the GGSN is defined in TS 23.008
[5] and TS 23.060 [9a].
The procedures for information transfer between the GGSN, the SGSN and the HLR
are defined in TS 23.016 [39] and TS 23.060 [9a].
#### 4.1.3.3 Void
### 4.1.4 Entities of the EPC PS Domain
#### 4.1.4.1 MME
MME is the control plane entity within EPS supporting functions as listed
below. For detailed functional role of MME, see specifications TS 23.401 [76],
TS 23.402 [77] and TS 36.300 [78].
Mobility Management,
\- NAS signalling and security;
\- Inter CN node signalling for mobility between 3GPP access networks;
\- Tracking Area list management;

The PDN GW is the gateway which terminates the SGi interface towards the PDN.
If a UE is accessing multiple PDNs, there may be more than one PDN GW for that
UE, however a mix of S5/S8 connectivity and Gn/Gp connectivity is not
supported for that UE simultaneously.
The PDN GW provides PDN connectivity to both GERAN/UTRAN only UEs and E‑UTRAN
capable UEs using any of E‑UTRAN, GERAN or UTRAN. The PDN GW provides PDN
connectivity to E‑UTRAN capable UEs using E‑UTRAN only over the S5/S8
interface. The PDN GW may also provide PDN connectivity to UEs using non-3GPP
access networks with the procedures defined in TS 23.402 [77].
For detailed PDN GW functions, see TS 23.401 [76] and TS 23.402 [77].

For details, see TS 23.401 [76] and TS 23.060 [9a].
#### 4.1.4.4 Trusted and Untrusted Non-3GPP Access Network
Trusted and Untrusted Non-3GPP Access Networks are IP access networks that use
access technology whose specification is out of the scope of 3GPP.
Whether a Non-3GPP IP access network is Trusted or Untrusted is not a
characteristic of the access network.
In non-roaming scenario it is the HPLMN\'s operator decision if a Non-3GPP IP
access network is used as Trusted or Untrusted Non-3GPP Access Network.
In roaming scenario, the HSS/3GPP AAA Server in HPLMN makes the final decision
of whether a Non-3GPP IP access network is used as Trusted or Untrusted
non-3GPP Access Network. The HSS/3GPP AAA Server may take the VPLMN\'s policy
and capability returned from the 3GPP AAA Proxy or roaming agreement into
account.
For details, see TS 23.402 [77].
#### 4.1.4.5 ePDG
The functionality of ePDG includes the following:
\- Functionality defined for the PDG in TS 23.234 [67] for the allocation of a
remote IP address as an IP address local to the ePDG which is used as CoA when
S2c is used;
\- Functionality for transportation of a remote IP address as an IP address
specific to a PDN when S2b is used;
\- Routing of packets from/to PDN GW (and from/to Serving GW if it is used as
local anchor in VPLMN) to/from UE; if GTP based S2b is used, this includes
routing of uplink packets based on the uplink packet filters in the TFTs
assigned to the S2b bearers of the PDN connection;
\- Routing of downlink packets towards the SWu instance associated to the PDN
connection;
\- De-capsulation/Encapsulation of packets for IPSec and, if network based
mobility (S2b) is used, for GTP or PMIP tunnels;
\- Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) for PMIPv6 if PMIP based S2b is used;
\- Tunnel authentication and authorization (termination of IKEv2 signalling
and relay via AAA messages);
\- Local mobility anchor within untrusted non-3GPP access networks using
MOBIKE (if needed);
\- Transport level packet marking in the uplink;
\- Enforcement of QoS policies based on information received via AAA
infrastructure;
\- Lawful Interception.
For details, see TS 23.402 [77].
#### 4.1.4.6 3GPP AAA Server
The 3GPP AAA Server is located at the HPLMN and provides support for non-3GPP
Access users with services like Authentication, Authorisation and location
management services in order to get access to EPS. It also contains necessary
user related information in order to grant access to non-3GPP access. It also
coordinates the information needed to support mobility between 3GPP and
non-3GPP accesses such as coordination of PDN GW information. It interacts
with HSS to maintain consistent information for users supporting mobility and
service continuity between 3GPP and non-3GPP access. For details, see TS
23.402 [77].
#### 4.1.4.7 3GPP AAA Proxy
The 3GPP AAA Proxy provides support for roaming non-3GPP Access users in the
VPLMN necessary the Authentication, Authorisation and location management
services in order to get access to EPS. It may also provide roaming related
information for support of chaining scenarios as described in TS 23.402 [77].
If an S-GW is needed for non-3GPP access in the visited network, the 3GPP AAA
proxy selects an S-GW for the UE during initial attach or handover attach.
#### 4.1.4.8 ANDSF
The ANDSF (which is an optional element in the architecture) contains data
management and control functionality necessary to provide network discovery
and selection assistance data as per operators\' policy. The ANDSF is able to
initiate data transfer to the UE, based on network triggers, and respond to
requests from the UE. It provides functions such as inter-system mobility
policy, access network discovery information.
The ANDSF in the subscriber\'s home operator network may interact with other
databases such as the HSS user profile information residing in subscriber\'s
home operator network. Details of such interaction with these databases are
not described in this Release of the specifications. For details on ANDSF, see
TS 23.402 [77].
NOTE: When the UE is roaming, how it discovers and interacts with the ANDSF is
not specified in the specification of this release.
### 4.1.5 Border Gateway (BG)]
The Border Gateway (BG) is a gateway between a PLMN supporting GPRS/EPC and an
external inter-PLMN backbone network used to interconnect with other PLMNs
also supporting GPRS/EPC. The role of the BG is to provide the appropriate
level of security to protect the PLMN and its subscribers.
The BG is only needed in PLMNs supporting GPRS and EPC.
## 4.2 The Access Network (AN) entities
Three different types of access network are used by the CN: the AN include
GERAN (also called BSS), UTRAN (also called RNS) and E-UTRAN. The MSC (resp.
SGSN) can connect to one of the following Access Network type or to both of
them: BSS, RNS. The MME connects to the E-UTRAN.
The access technologies offered by the BSS are described in the 45-series of
3GPP specifications. The access technologies offered by the RNS (FDD, TDD) are
described in the 25-series of 3GPP specifications. The access technologies
offered by E-UTRAN (FDD, TDD) are described in the 36-series of 3GPP
specifications.
### 4.2.1 The Base Station System (BSS)
The Base Station System (BSS) is the system of base station equipment
(transceivers, controllers, etc.) which is viewed by the MSC through a single
A and/or Iu-CS interface as being the entity responsible for communicating
with Mobile Stations in a certain area. Similarly, in PLMNs supporting GPRS,
the BSS is viewed by the SGSN through a single Gb or Iu-PS interface. When
Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes is applied, a BSS
may connect to several MSCs by several A and/or Iu-CS interfaces, and a BSS
may connect to several SGSNs by several Gb and/or Iu-PS interfaces. The
functionality for the A interface is described in TS 48.002 [14] and for the
Gb interface in TS 23.060 [9a]. The functionality for the Iu-CS interface is
described in TS 25.410 [14a] and for the Iu-PS interface in TS 23.060 [9a].
The radio equipment of a BSS may support one or more cells. A BSS may consist
of one or more base stations. Where an Abis-interface is implemented, the BSS
consists of one Base Station Controller (BSC) and one or more Base Transceiver
Station (BTS). The split of functions between BSS and CN for a Iu interface is
described in the 25-series of UMTS Technical Specifications.
The split of functions between BSS and CN for a A/Gb interface is described in
the 48-series of GSM Technical Specifications. The split of functions between
BSS and CN for a Iu interface is described in the 25-series of UMTS Technical
Specifications.
NOTE: The mobile station shall operate using only the following modes:
**a A / G~b~ mode** , e.g. for pre-Release 4 terminals, or for Release 4
terminals when connected to a BSS with no Iu interface towards the Core
Network.
**b Iu mode** (i.e. Iu-CS and Iu-PS ), e.g. for Release 4 terminals when
connected to a BSS with Iu interfaces towards the Core Network.
No other modes (e.g. A/Iu-PS or Iu-CS/Gb) shall be allowed.
See also TS 43.051 [36].
#### 4.2.1.1 Base Station Controller (BSC)
A Base Station Controller (BSC) is a network component in the PLMN with the
functions for control of one or more BTS.
#### 4.2.1.2 Base Transceiver Station (BTS)

### 4.2.2 The Radio Network System (RNS)
The Radio Network System (RNS) is the system of base station equipment
(transceivers, controllers, etc.) which is viewed by the MSC through a single
Iu-interface as being the entity responsible for communicating with Mobile
Stations in a certain area. Similarly, in PLMNs supporting GPRS, the RNS is
viewed by the SGSN through a single Iu-PS interface. When Intra Domain
Connection of RAN Nodes to Multiple CN Nodes is applied, an RNS may connect to
several MSCs by several Iu-CS interfaces, and an RNS may connect to several
SGSNs by several Iu-PS interfaces. The functionality for the Iu-CS interface
is described in TS 25.410 [14a] and for the Iu-PS interface in TS 23.060 [9a].
The radio equipment of a RNS may support one or more cells. A RNS may consist
of one or more base stations. The RNS consists of one Radio Network Controller
(RNC) and one or more Node B.
The split of functions between RNS and CN is described in the 25-series of
UMTS Technical Specifications.
#### 4.2.2.1 Radio Network Controller (RNC)
A Radio Network Controller (RNC) is a network component in the PLMN with the
functions for control of one or more Node B.
#### 4.2.2.2 Node B
A Node B is a logical network component which serves one or more UTRAN cells.
### 4.2.3 Access Network elements for E-UTRAN
#### 4.2.3.1 E-UTRAN Node B (eNodeB)
An eNodeB is a logical network component which serves one or more E-UTRAN
cells.
#### 4.2.3.2 Evolved UTRAN
The Evolved UTRAN (E-UTRAN) consists of eNBs, providing the E-UTRA user plane
(PDCP/RLC/MAC/PHY) and control plane (RRC) protocol terminations towards the
UE. The eNBs can be interconnected with each other by means of the X2
interface. The eNBs are connected by means of the S1 interface to the EPC
(Evolved Packet Core), more specifically to the MME (Mobility Management
Entity) by means of the S1-MME and to the Serving Gateway (S-GW) by means of
the S1-U interface. The S1 interface supports a many-to-many relation between
MMEs / Serving Gateways and eNBs.
The split of functions between eNodeB and EPC is described in the
specifications TS 23.401 [76], TS 36.300 [78] and TS 36.401 [79].
The architecture defined using E-UTRAN can be further described as follows:
The E-UTRAN consists of set of eNBs connected to the EPC through the S1
interface.
An eNodeB can support FDD mode, TDD mode or dual mode operation.
## 4.3 The Mobile Station (MS)
The mobile station consists of the physical equipment used by a PLMN
subscriber; it comprises the Mobile Equipment (ME) and the Subscriber Identity
Module (SIM), called UMTS Subscriber Identity Module (USIM) for Release 99 and
following. The ME comprises the Mobile Termination (MT) which, depending on
the application and services, may support various combinations of Terminal
Adapter (TA) and Terminal Equipment (TE) functional groups. These functional
groups are described in TS 24.002 [12].
## 4.4 User Equipment (UE)
The User Equipment Allows a user access to network services. For the purpose
of 3GPP specifications the interface between the UE and the network is the
radio interface. A User Equipment can be subdivided into a number of domains,
the domains being separated by reference points. Currently the User Equipment
is subdivided into the UICC domain and the ME Domain. The ME Domain can
further be subdivided into one or more Mobile Termination (MT) and Terminal
Equipment (TE) components showing the connectivity between multiple functional
groups.
# 4a The specific entities of the 3GPP system
The entities presented in this clause are dedicated to the provisioning of a
given (set of) service(s). The fact that they are implemented or not in a
given PLMN should have limited impact on all the other entities of the PLMN.
All the specific entities defined so far are located in the Core Network.
## 4a.1 The Group Call Register (GCR) entity
The Group Call Register (GCR) is a register holding information about VGCS or
VBS calls, the voice group or broadcast call attributes, respectively.
Voice group or broadcast call attributes are defined for a specific voice
group or broadcast call reference and include the data required to configure
the conference bridge for a VGCS or VBS call and other call related
attributes.
The Group Call Register (GCR) shall hold for a related MSC area for each group
ID and cell from which Voice Group Call Service (VGCS) or Voice Broadcast
Service (VBS) calls can be established by mobile stations the voice group call
reference or voice broadcast call reference to be used for a VGCS or VBS call
to be established and an indication whether the originating MSC is the MSC
responsible for that call.
If the originating MSC is not responsible for that call, the GCR shall hold
the routing information identifying the MSC responsible for that call.
A GCR may be in charge of one or several MSC. Each MSC involved in a voice
group or broadcast call requests its proper voice group or broadcast call
attributes from its related GCR by use of the voice group or broadcast call
reference.
The contents of each list related to requests of the MSC responsible for a
voice group or broadcast call is as follows:
\- a list of cells inside the MSC area of the requesting MSC into which the
call is to be sent (part of the group call area);
\- a list of other MSCs into which the call is to be sent;
\- a list of identities of dispatchers to which a dedicated link is to be
established;
\- a list of identities of dispatchers which are allowed to initiate the voice
group or broadcast call;
\- a list of identities of dispatchers which are allowed to terminate the
voice group or broadcast call;
\- the length of time over which no activity is detected before the voice
group call is automatically terminated;
\- the default priority level related to the voice group or broadcast call if
the eMLPP supplementary service applies;
\- a flag indicating if acknowledgements are required for this voice group or
broadcast call.
The contents of each list related to requests of an MSC not responsible for a
voice group or broadcast call is as follows:
\- a list of cells inside the MSC area of the requesting MSC into which the
call is to be sent (part of the group call area).
More information is provided in TS 43.068 [41] and TS 43.069 [42].
## 4a.2 (void)
## 4a.3 The Location Services (LCS) entities
This clause describes the Location Services entities found in the Core Network
and Radio Access Network that support positioning methods for the UE/MS.
For further details on LCS in E-UTRAN, UMTS and GSM from system and core
network point view, see TS 23.271 [56].
For further details on LCS in UTRAN, see TS 25.305 [10b].
For further details on LCS in GERAN, see TS 43.059 [10d].
For further details on user-plane LCS in E-UTRAN, see OMA SUPL [80]. For
further details on control plane LCS for E-UTRAN see TS 36.305 [122].
### 4a.3.1 Location Services (LCS) entities in RAN
The RAN (E-UTRAN, UTRAN and GERAN) supports one or more UE/MS positioning
methods to calculate the geographical position of the UE/MS and responds to
the UE/MS location request received from the CN. For UTRAN and GERAN, the RAN
may broadcast LCS assistance data to UEs/MSs under its coverage. In case this
assistance data is ciphered, the ciphering key is provided by the CN to the
UE/MS.
To support UE positioning methods, the RAN is made of several entities like:
**BSC/SRNC:** the BSC for GERAN and SRNC for UTRAN receive authenticated
location requests from the CN:
\- In UTRAN, the SRNC co-ordinates the positioning requests taking into
account their priority and it selects the positioning method to fulfil the
requested accuracy. It interfaces, when necessary, with the CRNC which mainly
manages resources allocated to UE positioning operations and requests UE
Positioning related measurements from its associated Node Bs and LMUs.
\- In GERAN, the BSC passes the location request to the SMLC.
**SMLC:**
\- The Serving Mobile Location Centre (SMLC) function can be part of the RNC
or be a SAS (Stand-Alone SMLC) for UTRAN. The SMLC function can be part of the
BSC or be in a separate SMLC server for GERAN.
\- In UTRAN, the SMLC function provides assistance data to the RNC and acts as
a location calculation server if the location estimates are not to be
calculated in the RNC.
\- In GERAN, the SMLC function co-ordinates the positioning request, schedules
resources required to perform positioning of a mobile, and calculates the
final location estimate and accuracy. The SMLC may control a number of LMUs.
**LMU:** The Location Measurement Unit (LMU) entity makes measurements for one
or more positioning methods.
**Node B** : Node B is a network element of UTRAN that may provide measurement
results for position estimation and makes measurements of radio signals.
**eNodeB: The eNodeB is a network element of E-UTRAN that may provide
measurement results for position estimation and makes measurements of radio
signals for a target UE and communicates these measurements to an E-SMLC.**
**CBC:** The Cell Broadcast Centre, in GERAN, the SMLC function may interface
a CBC in order to broadcast assistance data using existing cell broadcast
capabilities.
For detail on Location services, entities and interfaces provided by E-UTRAN,
see TS 36.305 [122].
For detail on Location services, entities and interfaces provided by UTRAN,
see TS 25.305 [10b].
For detail on Location services, entities and interfaces provided by GERAN,
see TS 43.059 [10d].
### 4a.3.2 Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC)
The Gateway Mobile Location Centre (GMLC) is the first node an external
Location Application accesses in the GSM PLMN. The GMLC performs registration
authorization and requests routing information from the HLR/HSS. There may be
more than one GMLC in a PLMN.
### 4a.3.3 Location Measurement Unit (LMU)
An LMU makes radio measurements to support one or more positioning methods.
Two types of LMU are defined:
\- Type A LMU: accessed over the normal GSM air interface;
\- Type B LMU: accessed over the base station to controller interface (Abis in
GSM and Iub in UMTS).
A type A LMU is accessed exclusively over the GSM air interface (Um
interface): there is no wired connection to any other network element.
In GSM, a type A LMU has a serving BTS and BSC that provide signalling access
to a controlling SMLC. With an NSS based SMLC, a type A LMU also has a serving
MSC and VLR and a subscription profile in an HLR. A type A LMU always has a
unique IMSI and supports all radio resource and mobility management functions
of the GSM air interface that are necessary to support signalling using an
SDCCH to the SMLC. A type A LMU supports those connection management functions
necessary to support LCS signalling transactions with the SMLC and may support
certain call control functions of to support signalling to an SMLC using a
circuit switched data connection.
In UTRAN, a type A LMU has signalling access to the SRNC. Type A LMU is not
supported in UMTS release 1999.
In GSM, a Type B LMU is accessed over the Abis interface from a BSC. The LMU
may be either a standalone network element addressed using some pseudo-cell ID
or connected to or integrated in a BTS. Signalling to a Type B LMU is by means
of messages routed through the controlling BSC for a BSS based SMLC or
messages routed through a controlling BSC and MSC for an NSS based SMLC.
In UTRAN, a Type B LMU is accessed over the Iub interface from an RNC. The LMU
may be either a standalone network element addressed using some pseudo-cell ID
or connected to or integrated in a Node B.
### 4a.3.4 Evolved Serving Mobile Location Centre (E-SMLC)
For E-UTRAN, the Evolved Serving Mobile Location Centre (E-SMLC) is a server
in the core network. The E-SMLC manages the support of different location
services for target UEs, including positioning of UEs and delivery of
assistance data to UEs. The E-SMLC may interact with the serving eNodeB for a
target UE in order to obtain position measurements for the UE, including
uplink measurements made by the eNodeB and downlink measurements made by the
UE that were provided to the eNodeB as part of other functions such as for
support of handover.
The E-SMLC may interact with a target UE in order to deliver assistance data
if requested for a particular location service, to obtain a location estimate,
or location related measurements, if that was requested.
For positioning of a target UE, the E-SMLC decides on the position methods to
be used, based on factors that may include the LCS Client type, the required
QoS, UE positioning capabilities, and eNodeB positioning capabilities. The
E-SMLC then invokes these positioning methods in the UE and/or serving eNodeB.
The positioning methods may yield a location estimate for UE-based position
methods and/or positioning measurements for UE-assisted and network-based
position methods. The E-SMLC may combine all the received results and
determine a single location estimate for the target UE (hybrid positioning).
Additional information like accuracy of the location estimate and velocity may
also be determined.
## 4a.4 CAMEL entities
The entities of this clause support the CAMEL feature (Customised Applications
for Mobile network Enhanced Logic). This feature provides the mechanisms to
support services consistently independently of the serving network, as
described in TS 22.078 [2c]. The following definitions are extracted from TS
23.078 [10c], which completely specifies CAMEL stage 2.
### 4a.4.1 GSM Service Control Function (gsmSCF)
A functional entity that contains the CAMEL service logic to implement
Operator Specific Service. It interfaces with the gsmSSF, the gsmSRF and the
HLR.
### 4a.4.2 GSM Service Switching Function (gsmSSF)
A functional entity that interfaces the MSC/GMSC to the gsmSCF. The concept of
the gsmSSF is derived from the IN SSF, but uses different triggering
mechanisms because of the nature of the mobile network.
### 4a.4.3 GSM Specialised Resource Function (gsmSRF)
A functional entity which provides various specialized resources. It
interfaces with the gsmSCF and with the MSC. This entity is defined in ITU‑T
Q.1214 [11] with variations defined in TS 23.078 [10c].
### 4a.4.4 GPRS Service Switching Function (gprsSSF)
A functional entity that interfaces the SGSN to the gsmSCF. The concept of the
gprsSSF is derived from the IN SSF, but uses different triggering mechanisms
because of the nature of the mobile network.
## 4a.5 CBS-specific entities
The cell broadcast service (CBS) is a Teleservice which enables an Information
Provider to submit short messages for broadcasting to a specified area within
the PLMN. TS 23.041 [8] contains the technical realization of the service.
### 4a.5.1 Cell Broadcast Centre (CBC)
The CBC shall be responsible for the management of CBS messages and for
determining the CBS delivery parameters of the BSS/RNS. The CBC may be
connected to several BSCs/RNCs. The CBC is regarded to be integrated as a node
into the core network.
NOTE: Whether it should be possible that an RNC is connected to at least two
CBCs at the same time (the \"normal\" one as in GSM and a second one for LCS)
is for further study and depends on the solution taken for LCS.
## 4a.6 Number Portability Specific entities
Two different solutions are defined to support Number Portability. The first
one is an IN based solution and is described in the next clause. The second
one is a \"Signalling Relay\" based solution described in next but one clause.
For details on MNP see TS 23.066 [40].
### 4a.6.1 IN-based solution: Number Portability Database (NPDB)
The Number Portability Database (NPDB) is the central element of the IN based
solution for Mobile Number Portability (MNP). MNP is the ability for a mobile
subscriber to change the GSM subscription network within a portability cluster
(e.g. a country) whilst retaining his/her original MSISDN or MSISDNs.
The NPDB stores the table of correspondence between MSISDNs and Subscription
networks. Upon request of the (gateway or visited) MSC, the NPDB retrieves
from the MSISDN the Routing Number pointing out the Subscription network.
### 4a.6.2 Signalling Relay-based solution: Mobile Number
Portability/Signalling Relay function (MNP-SRF)
The MNP-Signalling Relay Function (MNP-SRF) is the central element of the
Signalling Relay based solution for Mobile Number Portability.
The MNP-SRF obtains the routing information from a NP database to identify the
subscription network associated with a particular national MSISDN. Upon
request from gateway MSC, the MNP-SRF may perform one of the following
actions:
1\. the MNP-SRF will reply back to the GMSC with the necessary routing
information to route the call;
2\. the message is relayed to the HLR;
3\. the message is relayed to MNP-SRF in the subscription network.
For non-call related signalling (e.g. delivery of SMS), only cases 2 and 3 are
applicable.

(E‑CSCF), or Interrogating CSCF (I‑CSCF). The P‑CSCF is the first contact
point for the UE within the IM subsystem (IMS); the S‑CSCF actually handles
the session states in the network; the E‑CSCF handles certain aspects of
emergency sessions such as routing an emergency request to the correct
emergency centre or PSAP; the I‑CSCF is mainly the contact point within an
operator\'s network for all IMS connections destined to a subscriber of that
network operator, or a roaming subscriber currently located within that
network operator\'s service area. Further definitions of the P-, S- and I‑CSCF

### 4a.7.3 IP Multimedia Subsystem - Media Gateway Function (IMS-MGW)
Note: In this document the term Media Gateway Function (MGW) is used when
there is no need to differentiate between the CS domain entity and the IP
Multimedia CN Subsystem entity. When referring specifically to the CS domain
entity, the term CS-MGW is used. When referring specifically to the IP
Multimedia CN Subsystem entity, the term IMS-MGW is used.
A IMS-MGW may terminate bearer channels from a switched circuit network and
media streams from a packet network (e.g., RTP streams in an IP network). The
IMS-MGW may support media conversion, bearer control and payload processing
(e.g. codec, echo canceller, conference bridge), it:
\- Interacts with the MGCF for resource control.
\- Owns and handles resources such as echo cancellers etc.
\- May need to have Codecs.
The IMS-MGW will be provisioned with the necessary resources for supporting
UMTS/GSM transport media. Further tailoring (i.e. packages) of the H.248 [52]
may be required to support additional Codecs and framing protocols, etc.
### 4a.7.4 Multimedia Resource Function Controller (MRFC)

conferencing environment).
### 4a.7.4b Media Resource Broker (MRB)
The MRB supports the sharing of a pool of heterogeneous MRF resources by
multiple heterogeneous applications. MRB assigns (and later releases) specific
suitable MRF resources to calls as requested by the consuming applications,
based on MRF attributes specified by the applications as well as other
criteria.
The MRB may take the following kinds of information into account when
assigning MRF resources to an application:
\- the specific characteristics of the media resources required for the call
or calls;
\- the identity of the application;
\- rules for allocating MRF resources across different applications;
\- per-application or per-subscriber SLA or QoS criteria; and
\- capacity models of particular MRF resources.
### 4a.7.5 Void
### 4a.7.6 Breakout Gateway Control Function (BGCF)
The Breakout Gateway control function (BGCF) determines the next hop for
routing the SIP message. This determination may be based on information
received in the signalling protocol, administrative information, and/or
database access. For PSTN /CS Domain terminations, the BGCF determines the
network in which PSTN/CS Domain breakout is to occur and - within the network
where the breakout is to occur - selects the MGCF.
Details are described in TS 23.228 [34].
### 4a.7.7 Application Server (AS)
An Application Server (AS) i.e., SIP Application Server, OSA Application
Server, or CAMEL IM-SSF, offers value added IM services and resides either in
the user\'s home network or in a third party location. The third party could
be a network or simply a stand-alone AS.
NOTE 1: The OSA Application Server does not directly interact with the IMS
network entities but through the OSA Service Capability Servers (OSA SCS-s).
Further information on OSA is provided in TS 22.127 [4].
NOTE 2: A SIP Application Server specified within 3GPP that supports IMS
reference points (e.g. ISC, Sh, Ut), in support of an application, is
considered as part of the IM CN subsystem. Examples of such ASs are SCC AS and
TAS.
The AS (SIP Application Server and/or the OSA Service Capability Server and/or
IM-SSF) can communicate with the HSS. The Sh and Si interfaces are used for
this purpose.
The Serving‑CSCF to AS interface is used to provide services residing in an
AS. Two cases were identified:
\- Serving‑CSCF to an AS in Home Network.
\- Serving‑CSCF to an AS in a trusted External Network (e.g., Third Party or
Visited). The S‑CSCF does not provide authentication and security
functionality for secure direct third party access to the IM Subsystem. The
OSA framework provides a standardized way for third party access to the IM
Subsystem.
The Interrogating‑CSCF to AS interface is used to forward SIP requests
destined to a Public Service Identity hosted by the AS directly to that AS.
The AS to MRFC interfaces are:
\- Mr′, used for session control;
\- Cr, used for media control.
The AS to MRB interface (Rc) is used by the AS to request that MRF resources
with certain characteristics be assigned to a call.

# 5 Configuration of a Public Land Mobile Network
## 5.1 Basic configuration
The basic configuration of a Public Land Mobile Network (PLMN) supporting GPRS
and the interconnection to the PSTN/ISDN and PDN is presented in figure 1 and
figure 1a. Whereas the basic configuration of a Public Land Mobile Network
(PLMN) supporting PS Domain (both GPRS and EPC) and the interconnection to the
PSTN/ISDN and PDN is presented in figure 1b. This configuration presents
signalling and user traffic interfaces which can be found in a PLMN.
Implementations may be different: some particular functions may be gathered in
the same equipment and then some interfaces may become internal interfaces.
In the basic configuration presented in figure 1, all the functions are
considered implemented in different equipment. Therefore, all the interfaces
within PLMN are external. Interfaces A and Abis are defined in the 48-series
of Technical Specifications. Interfaces Iu, Iur and Iub are defined in the
25.4xx-series of Technical Specifications. Interfaces B, C, D, E, F and G need
the support of the Mobile Application Part of the signalling system No. 7 to
exchange the data necessary to provide the mobile service. No protocols for
the H-interface and for the I-interface are standardized. All the GPRS-
specific interfaces (G- series) are defined in the 23-series, 24-series and
29-series of Technical Specifications. Interfaces Mc, Nb, and Nc are defined
in TS 23.205 [43] and in the 29-series of Technical Specifications. The
specifications for E-UTRAN interfaces S1 and X2 are specified in TS 36.4xx and
NAS protocol is specified in TS 24.301 [89] series of specifications. The
interfaces S6a/d/S13 are specified in the specifications TS 29.272 [86]. The
EPC specific S1/3/4/5/8/10/11/12/ series are specified in TS 29.274 [90] for
GTP based protocols and for PMIP based S5/8 interfaces are specified in TS
29.275 [93].
From this configuration, all the possible 3GPP access PLMN organisations can
be deduced. In the case when some functions are contained in the same
equipment, the relevant interfaces become internal to that equipment.
The configuration possibilities when using non-3GPP access technologies using
EPS is not part of the scope of this specification. The architecture and
details for non-3GPP access and mobility and interworking with non-3GPP access
are described in TS 23.402 [77] and the interfaces and protocols are specified
in 3GPP 24-series and 29-series of specifications..

NOTE 1: The figure shows direct interconnections between the entities. The
actual links may be provided by an underlying network (e.g. SS7 or IP): this
needs further studies.
NOTE 2: When the MSC and the SGSN are integrated in a single physical entity,
this entity is called UMTS MSC (UMSC).
NOTE 3: A (G)MSC server and associated CS-MGW can be implemented as a single
node: the (G)MSC.

The configuration of LCS entities for GERAN is presented in figure 2. In the
figure, all the functions are considered implemented in different logical
nodes. If two logical nodes are implemented in the same physical equipment,
the relevant interfaces may become internal to that equipment.

## 5.3 Configuration of CAMEL entities
The following figure shows the interconnection of the CAMEL-specific entities
with the rest of the network. Only the interfaces specifically involved in
CAMEL provisioning are shown, i.e. all the GMSC, MSC, SGSN and HLR interfaces
depicted in figure 1 are still supported by these entities even if not shown.
CAMEL is not supported for E‑UTRAN access.
NOTE: Most CAMEL-specific interfaces have no particular name. They are
designated by the name of the two entities they link together, e.g. \"the
gsmSSF-gsmSCF interface\".

The configuration of IM CN Subsystem entities is presented in figure 6. In the
figure, all the functions are considered implemented in different logical
nodes. If two logical nodes are implemented in the same physical equipment,
the relevant interfaces may become internal to that equipment.

all the SGSN, GGSN, S-GW, PDN-GW and HSS interfaces depicted in figure 1 and
figure 1b are still supported by these entities even if not shown.
**Legend:**
Bold lines: interfaces supporting user traffic;
Dashed lines: Interfaces supporting only signalling.

specification.
NOTE 2: The reference point I5 is not shown in this figure.
Figure 6: Configuration of IM Subsystem entities
### 5.5.2 IM CN Subsystem Service layer
The figure below depicts an overall view of the functional architecture for
services.
Figure 6a: Functional architecture for the provision of service in the IMS
The purpose of the IM SSF is to host the CAMEL network features (i.e. trigger
detection points, CAMEL Service Switching Finite State Machine, etc.) and to
interwork with CAP. The IMS-SSF may receive CAMEL subscription data from HSS
via Sh reference point in addition to the Si reference point.
The IM SSF and the CAP interface support legacy services only.
The application server may contain \"service capability interaction manager\"
(SCIM) functionality and other application servers. The SCIM functionality is
an application which performs the role of interaction management. The internal
components are represented by the \"dotted boxes\" inside the SIP application
server. The internal structure of the application server is outside the
standards. The Sh interface shall have sufficient functionality to enable this
scenario.

### 5.5.3 Service Centralization and Continuity
Figure 6d depicts an overall view of the functional architecture for IMS
services centralization and continuity.
Figure 6d: Functional architecture for IMS Service Centralization and
Continuity
IMS Service Centralization, defined in TS 23.292 [110] provides communication
services such that all services, and service control, are based on IMS
mechanisms and enablers. It enables IMS services when using CS access as
bearer for the media.
IMS Service Continuity, defined in TS 23.237 [111] provides Session Transfer
mechanisms to maintain service continuity in the event of access transfer for
the case when such events are not hidden from the IMS session layer and thus
service continuity could not otherwise be maintained.
Figure 6e provides the reference architecture for SRVCC using the ATCF
enhancements as defined in TS 23.237 [111]. The ATCF enhancements provide
Session Transfer mechanisms in the serving network to maintain service
continuity in the event of access transfer for SRVCC.
Figure 6e: IMS Service Centralization and Continuity Reference Architecture
when using ATCF enhancements
If neither the MSC Server is not enhanced for ICS, the interface between MSC
Server and ATCF is Mw.
NOTE 2: If the MSC Server is enhanced for ICS, the interface between MSC
Server and ATCF is I2.
### 5.5.4 WebRTC access to IMS
Figure 5.5.4-1 depicts an overall view of the functional architecture for
WebRTC access to IMS.
NOTE: The presence of dashed elements in the figure depends on the
configuration.
PCC functional elements are present only for EPC access with QoS.
The corresponding PCC elements for fixed access are also optionally supported
but not shown.
The NAT is meant for non-cellular access to IMS.
Figure 5.5.4-1: Functional architecture for WebRTC access to IMS
The architecture and the procedures to provide communication services to
WebRTC IMS clients (WIC) are defined in Annex U of TS 23.228 [34].
## 5.6 Configuration of Signalling Gateway Function
The Signalling gateway function is used to interconnect different signalling
networks i.e. SCTP/IP based signalling networks and SS7 signalling networks.
The application layer (e.g. ISUP, BICC, MAP or CAP) is not affected. The
signalling gateway function may be implemented as a stand-alone entity or
inside another entity.
Figure 7: Configuration of a signalling gateway function
NOTE: SS7 application transport and SCTP/IP adaption protocols are not shown.
## 5.7 Configuration of 3GPP/WLAN Interworking
The configuration of the 3GPP/WLAN interworking function is presented in
figure 8. The figure shows all network entities and reference point for the
roaming scenario when a WLAN UE accesses PS based services in the home
network. PS based services in the visited network are accessed via a Packet
Data Gateway in the visited 3GPP network. Reference point Ww between WLAN UE
and WLAN is outside the scope of 3GPP and only shown for completeness.

Protocol access (SMSIP) entities
The configuration of the Short Message Service over generic 3GPP Internet
Protocol access (SMSIP) entities are represented in figure 10.
Figure 10: Configuration of SMSIP entities
## 5.11 Configuration of Policy Control and Charging entities
The PCC functionality is comprised by the functions of the Policy and Charging
Enforcement Function (PCEF), the Bearer Binding and Event Reporting Function
(BBERF), the Policy and Charging Rules Function (PCRF), the Application
Function (AF), the Online Charging System (OCS), the Offline Charging System
(OFCS), the Traffic Detection Function (TDF), the Traffic Steering Support
Function (TSSF) and the Subscription Profile Repository (SPR) or the User Data
Repository (UDR). Figures 5.11-1 through to 5.11-4 describe the non-roaming
and roaming architecture for PCC.
The PCRF can receive RAN User Plane Congestion Information from the RAN
Congestion Awareness Function (RCAF).
The PCC architecture extends the architecture of an IP-CAN, where the Policy
and Charging Enforcement Function is a functional entity in the Gateway node
implementing the IP access to the PDN. The allocation of the Bearer Binding
and Event Reporting Function is specific to each IP-CAN type and specified in
the TS 23.203 [73].
PCC function makes it possible to apply policy and charging control to any
kind of 3GPP IP CAN and any non-3GPP accesses connected via EPC complying with
TS 23.402 [77]. Applicability of PCC to other IP CAN is not restricted;
however, it shall be possible for the PCC architecture to base decisions upon
the type of IP CAN used (e.g. GPRS, I-WLAN, etc.). Support for policy control
and charging when local breakout and roaming are applied as specified in TS
23.401 [76] and TS 23.402 [77] is supported.

network (local breakout) when SPR is used
NOTE 1: The SCEF acts as an AF (using Rx) in some service capability exposure
use cases as described in TS 23.682 [132].
NOTE 2: The PCEF of PDN GW and the TDF can be further split into control plane
entities (PGW-C and TDF-C) and user plane entities (PGW-U and TDF-U). The
architecture reference model for the control plane and user plane separation
is defined in TS 23.214 [145].
## 5.12 Configuration of CSFB(CS Fallback)
The CS fallback in EPS enables the provisioning of voice and other CS-domain
services (e.g. CS UDI video/ SMS/ LCS/ USSD) by reuse of CS infrastructure
when the UE is served by E-UTRAN. This function is only available in case
E-UTRAN coverage is overlapped by either GERAN coverage or UTRAN coverage.
The configurations of the CSFB entities are represented in figure 5.12.
Figure 5.12: Configuration of CSFB
NOTE: The MGW is not shown in the figure 5.12 since the CS fallback in EPS
does not have any impacts to the User plane handling.
## 5.13 Configuration of Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (SRVCC)
### 5.13.1 E-UTRAN/UTRAN (HSPA) to UTRAN or GERAN SRVCC architecture
Single Radio Voice Call Continuity (PS to CS) refers to continuity between IMS
over PS access and CS calls that are anchored in IMS when the UE is capable of
transmitting/receiving on only one of those access networks at a given time.
PS to CS SRVCC is specified in TS 23.216 [83]. The following figures 5.13,
5.13a and 5.13b show the entities involved in PS to CS SRVCC.
Figure 5.13: SRVCC architecture for E-UTRAN to 3GPP UTRAN/GERAN

with S4 based SGSN
NOTE 1: The above figures only show the necessary components related to MSC
Server enhanced with SRVCC.
NOTE 2: MSC Server shown in the above figures are enhanced for SRVCC.
NOTE 3: This architecture also applies to roaming scenario (i.e., S8, S6a are
not impacted due to SRVCC).
NOTE 4: The MSC Server enhanced with SRVCC may not be the final target MSC
which connects to the target cell.
### 5.13.2 UTRAN/GERAN to E-UTRAN or UTRAN (HSPA) SRVCC architecture
CS to PS Single Radio Voice Call Continuity refers to continuity between a CS
call and IMS call over PS access that are anchored in IMS when the UE is
capable of transmitting/receiving on only one of those access networks at a
given time. CS to PS SRVCC is specified in TS 23.216 [83]. The following
figures 5.13c, 5.13d and 5.13e show the entities involved in CS to PS SRVCC.
NOTE 1: The above figure only shows the necessary components related to MSC
Server enhanced for CS to PS SRVCC.
NOTE 2: MSC Server shown in the figure is enhanced for CS to PS SRVCC.
NOTE 3: This architecture also applies to roaming scenario (i.e. S8, S6a are
not impacted due to CS to PS SRVCC).

Gn based SGSN
NOTE 1: The above figures only show the necessary components related to MSC
Server enhanced with CS to PS SRVCC.
NOTE 2: MSC Server shown in the above figures are enhanced for CS to PS SRVCC.
NOTE 3: This architecture also applies to roaming scenario.

## 5.14 Configuration of Security
The reference architecture model, the reference points and the functional
entities to support and provide security related functions to the users,
devices and network entities when in the UTRAN access as well as using IMS are
described in TS 33.1xx series and TS 33.2xx series.
The reference architecture model, the reference points and the functional
entities to support security functions to the users, devices and network
entities when in the EPC are described in TS 33.401 [87] for 3GPP access and
in TS 33.402 [88] for non-3GPP accesses.
## 5.15 Configuration of Lawful Intercept related entities
The general configuration for Lawful Interception is shown in figure 5.15. The
definition of the LI functional entities and interfaces is provided in TS
33.107 [84].
The reference configuration is only a logical representation of the entities
involved in lawful interception and does not mandate separate physical
entities. There is one Administration Function (ADMF) in the network. Every
physical Intercepting Control Element (ICE) is linked by its own
X1_1-interface to the ADMF. Consequently, every single ICE performs
interception (activation, deactivation, interrogation as well as invocation)
independently from other ICEs.
Figure 5.15: General Lawful Interception Architecture
## 5.16 Configuration of Charging related entities
The general configuration for common charging architecture for 3GPP defined
entities is shown in figure 5.16 as defined in TS 32.240 [85]. This common
charging architecture provides a logical view and the actual domain / service
/ subsystem specific charging architecture depends on the domain / service /
subsystem in question. The physical mapping of the common logical architecture
onto each domain, subsystem or service is described in the respective charging
specifications, i.e. the TSs 32.25x, 32.26x and 32.27x number range.
3GPP networks provide functions that implement offline and/or online charging
mechanisms on the bearer (e.g. EPC), subsystem (e.g. IMS) and service (e.g.
MMS) levels. In order to support these charging mechanisms, the network
performs real-time monitoring of resource usage on the above three levels in
order to detect the relevant chargeable events.
In offline charging, the resource usage is reported from the network to the
Billing Domain after the resource usage has occurred. In online charging, a
subscriber account, located in an Online Charging System, is queried prior to
granting permission to use the requested network resource(s).
Offline and online charging may be performed simultaneously and independently
for the same chargeable event.
Figure 5.16: Logical ubiquitous charging architecture
## 5.17 Configuration of Home (e)NodeB entities
### 5.17.1 Configuration of the Home NodeB Subsystem
The configuration of the Home NodeB Subsystem is presented in figure 5.17-1.
In the figure, all the functions are considered implemented in different
logical nodes. If two logical nodes are implemented in the same physical
equipment, the relevant interfaces may become internal to that equipment.
The Home NodeB Gateway may also be used only for the control plane of Iu-CS
and/or Iu-PS interfaces. In this case, the user plane of Iu-CS and/or Iu-PS
interfaces is directly between the Home NodeB and respectively the MSC/VLR and
the SGSN/Serving GW/GGSN.
In case Direct Tunnel is established, the user plane is directly between the
Home NodeB Subsystem and the GGSN or Serving GW nodes.
Figure 5.17-1: Configuration of PLMN supporting Home NodeB Subsystem
### 5.17.2 Configuration of the Home eNodeB Subsystem
The configuration of Home eNodeB Subsystem with a Home eNodeB Gateway present
is shown in figure 5.17-2. In the figure, all the functions are considered
implemented in different logical nodes. If two logical nodes are implemented
in the same physical equipment, the relevant interfaces may become internal to
that equipment.
The presence of Home eNodeB Gateway in the configuration of Home eNodeB
Subsystem is optional.
The Home eNodeB Gateway may also be used only for the S1-MME interface. In
this case, the S1-U interface is directly between the Home eNodeB and the
S-GW.

## 5.20 Configuration of Proximity-based Services
The reference architecture model, the reference points and the functional
entities to facilitate ProSe are described in TS 23.303 [141].
## 5.21 Configuration for RAN user plane congestion detection and reporting
RAN user plane congestion detection and reporting enables the PCRF to take the
RAN user plane congestion status into account for policy decisions. This
functionality is applicable only in case of UTRAN/E-UTRAN accesses. The
configuration of the related entities is depicted in Figure 5.21.
Figure 5.21: Configuration for RAN user plane congestion detection and
reporting
NOTE: The interface to the RAN\'s OAM system is not standardized.
# 6 PLMN basic interfaces and reference points
The implementation of the mobile service with international roaming implies
the exchange of data between the equipment involved in the service. The same
No.7 signalling network should be used to transfer these data and the call-
related signalling information.
Editor\'s note: Either the difference between interface and reference point
should be clearly provided, or only one of the terms should be used.

#### 6.4.1.1 Interface between the MSC server and its associated VLR
(B-interface)
The VLR is the location and management database for the mobile subscribers
roaming in the area controlled by the associated MSC server(s). Whenever the
MSC server needs data related to a given mobile station currently located in
its area, it interrogates the VLR. When a mobile station initiates a location
updating procedure with an MSC server, the MSC server informs its VLR which
stores the relevant information. This procedure occurs whenever an MS roams to
another location area. Also, when a subscriber activates a specific
supplementary service or modifies some data attached to a service, the MSC
server informs (via the VLR) the HLR which stores these modifications and
updates the VLR if required.
This interface is internal to the MSC server /VLR; signalling on it is not
standardised.
#### 6.4.1.2 Interface between the HLR and the MSC server (C-interface)
The Gateway MSC server must interrogate the HLR of the required subscriber to
obtain routing information for a call or a short message directed to that
subscriber.
Signalling on this interface uses the Mobile Application Part (MAP), which in
turn uses the services of Transaction Capabilities (see TS 29.002 [26]).
For CAMEL purposes, this interface is used as described in TS 23.078 [10c]. It
is used e.g. at terminating calls to exchange routeing information, subscriber
status, location information, subscription information, etc.
#### 6.4.1.3 Interface between the HLR and the VLR (D-interface)
This interface is used to exchange the data related to the location of the
mobile station and to the management of the subscriber. The main service
provided to the mobile subscriber is the capability to set up or to receive
calls within the whole service area. To support this, the location registers
have to exchange data. The VLR informs the HLR of the location of a mobile
station managed by the latter and provides it (either at location updating or
at call set-up) with the roaming number of that station. The HLR sends to the
VLR all the data needed to support the service to the mobile subscriber. The
HLR then instructs the previous VLR to cancel the location registration of
this subscriber. Exchanges of data may occur when the mobile subscriber
requires a particular service, when he wants to change some data attached to
his subscription or when some parameters of the subscription are modified by
administrative means.
Signalling on this interface uses the Mobile Application Part (MAP), which in
turn uses the services of Transaction Capabilities (see TS 29.002 [26]).
For CAMEL purposes, this interface is used to send the CAMEL related
subscriber data to the visited PLMN and for provision of MSRN. The interface
is also used for the other purposes described in TS 23.078 [10c], e.g. to
retrieve subscriber status and location information of the mobile subscriber
or to indicate suppression of announcement for a CAMEL service.
#### 6.4.1.4 Interface between MSC servers or MSC server and IP-SM-GW
(E-interface)
When a mobile station moves from one MSC area to another during a call, a
handover procedure has to be performed in order to continue the communication.
For that purpose the MSC servers have to exchange data to initiate and then to
realise the operation.
After the handover operation has been completed, the MSC servers will exchange
information to transfer A‑ or Iu‑ interface signalling as defined in TS 23.009
[6].
When a short message is to be transferred between a Mobile Station and Short
Message Service Centre (SC), in either direction, this interface is used to
transfer the message between the MSC server serving the Mobile Station and the
MSC server which acts as the interface to the SC. or between the IP-SM-GW
serving the Mobile Station and the MSC server which acts as the interface to
the SC.
Signalling on this interface uses the Mobile Application Part (MAP), which in
turn uses the services of Transaction Capabilities (see TS 29.002 [26]).
#### 6.4.1.5 Interface between MSC server and EIR (F-interface)
This interface is used between MSC server and EIR to exchange data, in order
that the EIR can verify the status of the IMEI retrieved from the Mobile
Station.
Signalling on this interface uses the Mobile Application Part (MAP), which in
turn uses the services of Transaction Capabilities (see TS 29.002 [26]).
#### 6.4.1.6 Interface between VLRs (G-interface)
When a mobile subscriber moves from a VLR area to another Location
Registration procedure will happen. This procedure may include the retrieval
of the IMSI and authentication parameters from the old VLR.
Signalling on this interface uses the Mobile Application Part (MAP), which in
turn uses the services of Transaction Capabilities (see TS 29.002 [26]).
#### 6.4.1.7 Reference point (G)MSC server - CS-MGW (Mc Reference Point)
The Mc reference point describes the interfaces between the MSC Server and CS-
MGW, and between the GMSC Server and CS-MGW. It has the following properties:
\- full compliance with the H.248 [52] standard, baseline work of which is
currently carried out in ITU-T Study Group 16, in conjunction with IETF MEGACO
WG.
\- flexible connection handling which allows support of different call models
and different media processing purposes not restricted to H.323 [54] usage.
\- open architecture where extensions/Packages definition work on the
interface may be carried out.
\- dynamic sharing of MGW physical node resources. A physical MGW can be
partitioned into logically separate virtual MGWs/domains consisting of a set
of statically allocated Terminations.
\- dynamic sharing of transmission resources between the domains as the MGW
controls bearers and manage resources according to the H.248 [52] protocols.
The functionality across the Mc reference point will need to support mobile
specific functions such as SRNS relocation/handover and anchoring. It is
expected that current H.248/IETF Megaco [52] standard mechanisms can be
applied to enable this.
#### 6.4.1.8 Reference Point MSC Server - GMSC Server (Nc Reference Point)
Over the Nc reference point, the Network-Network based call control is
performed. Examples of this are ISUP or an evolvement of ISUP for bearer
independent call control (BICC). Different options for signalling transport on
Nc shall be possible including IP.
#### 6.4.1.9 Reference Point CS-MGW - CS-MGW (Nb Reference Point)
Over the Nb reference point the bearer control and transport are performed.
The transport may be RTP/UDP/IP [59], [60] or AAL2 (I.363-2) [57] for
transport of user data. Different options for user data transport and bearer
control shall be possible on Nb, for example: AAL2/Q.AAL2, STM/none, RTP/H.245
[58], IPBC.
#### 6.4.1.10 Reference Point between the CSS and the VLR (Hv Reference Point)
This reference point is used to transfer to the VLR the CSG subscription
information stored in the VPLMN for roaming UEs.
Signalling on this interface uses the Mobile Application Part (MAP), which in
turn uses the services of Transaction Capabilities (TCAP) (see TS 29.002
[26]).

mobile station and to the management of the subscriber. The main service
provided to the mobile subscriber is the capability to transfer packet data
within the whole service area. The SGSN informs the HLR of the location of a
mobile station managed by the latter. The HLR sends to the SGSN all the data
needed to support the service to the mobile subscriber. Exchanges of data may
occur when the mobile subscriber requires a particular service, when he wants
to change some data attached to his subscription or when some parameters of
the subscription are modified by administrative means.
Signalling on this interface uses the Mobile Application Part (MAP), which in
turn uses the services of Transaction Capabilities (TCAP) (see TS 29.002
[26]).
#### 6.4.2.2 Interface between SGSN and GGSN (Gn- and Gp-interface)
These interfaces are used to support mobility between the SGSN and GGSN. The
Gn interface is used when GGSN and SGSN are located inside one PLMN. The Gp-
interface is used if GGSN and SGSN are located in different PLMNs. The Gn/Gp
interface also includes a part which allows SGSNs to communicate subscriber
and user data, when changing SGSN.
Signalling on this interface uses the User Datagram Protocol, UDP/IP [59]. The
Gn/Gp interface is defined in TS 29.060 [51].
#### 6.4.2.3 Signalling Path between GGSN and HLR (Gc-interface)
This optional signalling path may be used by the GGSN to retrieve information
about the location and supported services for the mobile subscriber, to be
able to activate a packet data network address.
There are two alternative ways to implement this signalling path:
\- if an SS7 interface is implemented in the GGSN, signalling between the GGSN
and the HLR uses the Mobile Application Part (MAP), which in turn uses the
services of Transaction Capabilities (TCAP) (see TS 29.002 [26]);
\- if there is _no_ SS7 interface in the GGSN, any GSN in the same PLMN and
which has an SS7 interface installed can be used as a GTP to MAP protocol
converter, thus forming a signalling path between the GGSN and the HLR.
#### 6.4.2.4 Interface between SGSN and EIR (Gf-interface)
This interface is used between SGSN and EIR to exchange data, in order that
the EIR can verify the status of the IMEI retrieved from the Mobile Station.

Global Title (GT) is used for addressing. The Gs-interface is defined in TS
29.016 [48] and TS 29.018 [49].
#### 6.4.3.2 Interface between HLR/HSS and AuC (H-Interface)
When an HLR/HSS receives a request for authentication and ciphering data for a
Mobile Subscriber and it does not hold the requested data, the HLR/HSS
requests the data from the AuC. The protocol used to transfer the data over
this interface is not standardised.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Description for GLR-related entities and
interfaces
This annex describes the GLR-related entities and the interfaces. This annex
is an informative annex. The \'informative\' means just that the GLR is an
optional functional entity to optimize signalling traffic between PLMNs.
Therefore, this annex is normative to a PLMN which introduce the GLR.
The GLR is only applicable for GERAN and UTRAN access. The GLR is not
applicable to the EPC.
# A.1 Normative references
[A1] 3GPP TS 23.119: \"3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical
Specification Group Core Network; Gateway Location Register (GLR); Stage2\".
# A.2 Definitions related to Gateway Location Register (GLR)
## A.2.1 Gateway Location Register (GLR)
This entity handles location management of roaming subscriber in visited
network without involving HLR. The location register function in the GLR
stores subscription information and routeing information for both CS services
and PS services. This entity can be only located in a visited PLMN.
## A.2.2 Intermediate Mobile-services Switching Centre (IM-MSC)
This entity is used as serving MSC towards home network and relay some
messages between home network and serving MSC. This entity can be only located
in a visited PLMN.
## A.2.3 Intermediate GPRS Serving Node (IM-GSN)
This entity is used as serving GSN towards home network and relay some PDU
notification messages between serving GSN and Gateway GSN. This entity can be
only located in a visited PLMN.
# A.3 The entities of the mobile system
## A.3.1 Gateway Location Register (GLR)
GLR is pseudo-HLR located in visited network. The roamer\'s information is
stored in it and handles location management of it within the network.
Presence of GLR is invisible from home network therefore interface between HLR
and GLR is same as one of HLR and VLR. Also, the interface between the VLR and
GLR is the same as the one between the VLR and the HLR.
The GLR is a logical node and acts as a VLR for MAP signalling (e.g. PRN) from
the HPLMN point of view. The GLR acts as a HLR for MAP signalling (e.g.
Register SS) from the VPLMN point of view.
The GLR also acts as an SGSN for MAP signalling only (e.g. ISD) from the HPLMN
point of view. This is because MAP operations such as ISD must be terminated
at the GLR for the purpose of subscriber data caching.
The GLR shall terminate all TC dialogues and start new dialogues towards the
HLR or the VLR. The GLR shall generate SCCP address of the HLR (i.e. E.214
MGT) from IMSI.
## A.3.2 Intermediate Mobile-services Switching Centre (IM-MSC)
The Intermediate MSC (IM-MSC) is the logical node, which represent MSCs in the
visited network. Some service features use the MSC Number stored in the HLR
directly to deliver message from a certain node in home network (e.g. SMS-
GMSC) to serving MSC in visited network. In such case, the message is firstly
distributed to representative MSC (i.e. IM-MSC) and it relays it to actual
serving MSC interrogating routing information to GLR.
\- The Intermediate MSC (IM-MSC) is a logical node and represents the VMSC in
the GLR equipped VPLMN.
\- The IM-MSC acts as the VMSC for the HPLMN in the same way that the GLR acts
as a VLR for HPLMN. The IM-MSC terminates MAP signalling from the HPLMN
towards the VMSC and forwards the signal to the actual VMSC.
\- The IM-MSC has an address interrogation function with which it is able to
obtain the actual VMSC Number from the GLR.
\- The IM-MSC is implemented in the same physical node as the one in which the
GLR is implemented.
\- The GLR alters the VMSC Number to the IM-MSC Number within an Update
Location message.
\- The IM-MSC Number is the E.164 Number assigned to the IM-MSC [53].
\- The interrogation function of the IM-MSC is similar to that in the SMS-
GMSC.
## A.3.3 Intermediate GPRS Serving Node (IM-GSN)
The Intermediate GSN (IM-GSN) is a logical node and represents the SGSN for
some GTP signalling termination in a GLR equipped VPLMN.
The IM-GSN acts as an SGSN for **_only some GTP signalling messages_** (i.e.
PDU_Notification request/response, PDU_Notification_reject request/response)
from the HPLMN point of view. The IM-GSN terminates these GTP signalling
messages from the HPLMN towards SGSN and forwards the signal to the actual
SGSN. The IM-GSN has an address interrogation function with which it is able
to request the actual SGSN address from the GLR.
Apart from the case described above (i.e. PDU_Notification request/response,
PDU_Notification_reject request/response), all other GTP signalling should be
handled directly between the SGSN and the GGSN.
NOTE: **_MAP signalling_** towards the SGSN is **_NOT_** terminated at the IM-
GSN. Instead it is terminated at the GLR.
# A.4 Configuration of a Public Land Mobile Network
## A.4.1 Basic configuration with GLR introduction
In the basic configuration with GLR introduction presented in figure A.1, all
the functions related to GLR introduction are considered implemented in
different equipment. Therefore, all the interfaces within PLMN are external.
Interfaces GLa, GLb, GLc, GLd, GLf, GLg, GLh, and GLi need the support of the
Mobile Application Part of the signalling system No. 7 to exchange the data
necessary to provide the mobile service. No protocols for the GLe interface
are standardized. GLj and GLk need the support of GPRS Tunnelling Protocol -
Control to provide the packet domain services.

In the network with the GLR when the IM_GSN receiving a PDU notification from
the GGSN, the IM_GSN relays the notification to the SGSN by interrogating via
the interface the routing information to the GLR. The interrogation uses the
same operation on the interface between the SGSN and the HLR (see TS 29.002
[26]).
## A.5.6 Interface between the SMS-GMSC and the GLR (GLf‑interface)
This interface is used to forward mobile-terminated short messages in the

## A.5.7 Interface between the SMS-GMSC and the IM_MSC (GLg‑interface)
This interface is used to forward short messages in the network with the GLR
in case of SMS transfer over non-GPRS. Signalling on this interface uses the

Part (MAP) (see TS 29.002 [26]).
## A.5.9 Interface between the GMLC and the IM_MSC (GLi‑interface)
Also this interface is used to exchange data needed by the MSC to perform
subscriber authorization and allocate network resources. Signalling on this
interface uses the Mobile Application Part (MAP) (see TS 29.002 [26]).
The GMLC regards the IM_MSC as the MSC via this interface.
## A.5.10 Interface between the GGSN and the IM_GSN (GLj‑interface)
In the network with the GLR when receiving a PDP PDU from the external network
the GGSN sends a notification to the IM_GSN by the routing information from
the HLR (see TS 29.060 [51]). The GGSN regards the IM_GSN as the SGSN via this
interface.
## A.5.11 Interface between the SGSN and the IM_GSN (GLk‑interface)
In the network with the GLR when receiving a PDP notification from the GGSN,
the IM_GSN relays the notification to the SGSN by the routing information from
the GLR (see TS 29.060 [51]). The SGSN regards the IM_GSN as the GGSN via this
interface.
