# 1 Scope
The present document defines the Stage 2 system architecture for the 5G
System. The 5G System provides data connectivity and services.
This specification covers both roaming and non-roaming scenarios in all
aspects, including interworking between 5GS and EPS, mobility within 5GS, QoS,
policy control and charging, authentication and in general 5G System wide
features e.g. SMS, Location Services, Emergency Services.
ITU‑T Recommendation I.130 [11] describes a three-stage method for
characterisation of telecommunication services, and ITU‑T Recommendation Q.65
[12] defines Stage 2 of the method.
TS 23.502 [3] contains the stage 2 procedures and flows for 5G System and it
is a companion specification to this specification.
TS 23.503 [45] contains the stage 2 Policy Control and Charging architecture
for 5G System and it is a companion specification to this specification.

registration to 5GS.
**5G QoS Flow or QoS Flow:** The finest granularity for QoS forwarding
treatment in the 5G System. All traffic mapped to the same 5G QoS Flow receive
the same forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling policy, queue management
policy, rate shaping policy, RLC configuration, etc.). Providing different QoS
forwarding treatment requires separate 5G QoS Flow.
**5G QoS Identifier:** A scalar that is used as a reference to a specific QoS
forwarding behaviour (e.g. packet loss rate, packet delay budget) to be
provided to a 5G QoS Flow. This may be implemented in the access network by
the 5QI referencing node specific parameters that control the QoS forwarding
treatment (e.g. scheduling weights, admission thresholds, queue management
thresholds, link layer protocol configuration, etc.).
**5G System:** 3GPP system consisting of 5G Access Network (AN), 5G Core
Network and UE.

signalling with 5GC. The 5G-RG can be either a 5G-BRG or 5G-CRG.
**Access Traffic Steering:** The procedure that selects an access network for
a new data flow and transfers the traffic of this data flow over the selected
access network. Access traffic steering is applicable between one 3GPP access
and one non-3GPP access.
**Access Traffic Switching:** The procedure that moves all traffic of an
ongoing data flow from one access network to another access network in a way
that maintains the continuity of the data flow. Access traffic switching is
applicable between one 3GPP access and one non-3GPP access.
**Access Traffic Splitting:** The procedure that splits the traffic of a data
flow across multiple access networks. When traffic splitting is applied to a
data flow, some traffic of the data flow is transferred via one access and
some other traffic of the same data flow is transferred via another access.
Access traffic splitting is applicable between one 3GPP access and one
non-3GPP access.

subscriptions to convey the scope within which selection/reselection of
notification targets or the selection of other service(s) that the NF consumer
produces for the same data context may be performed. See clause 6.3.1.0.
**BSF Group ID:** This refers to one or more BSF instances managing a specific
set of SUPIs or GPSIs. A BSF Group consists of one or multiple BSF Sets.
**Configured NSSAI:** NSSAI provisioned in the UE applicable to one or more
PLMNs.
**CHF Group ID:** This refers to one or more CHF instances managing a specific
set of SUPIs.
**Credentials Holder:** Entity which authenticates and authorizes access to an
SNPN separate from the Credentials Holder.
**Default UE credentials:** Information configured in the UE to make the UE
uniquely identifiable and verifiably secure to perform UE onboarding.

# 4 Architecture model and concepts
## 4.1 General concepts
The 5G System architecture is defined to support data connectivity and
services enabling deployments to use techniques such as e.g. Network Function
Virtualization and Software Defined Networking. The 5G System architecture
shall leverage service-based interactions between Control Plane (CP) Network
Functions where identified. Some key principles and concept are to:
\- Separate the User Plane (UP) functions from the Control Plane (CP)
functions, allowing independent scalability, evolution and flexible
deployments e.g. centralized location or distributed (remote) location.
\- Modularize the function design, e.g. to enable flexible and efficient
network slicing.
\- Wherever applicable, define procedures (i.e. the set of interactions
between network functions) as services, so that their re-use is possible.
\- Enable each Network Function and its Network Function Services to interact
with other NF and its Network Function Services directly or indirectly via a
Service Communication Proxy if required. The architecture does not preclude
the use of another intermediate function to help route Control Plane messages
(e.g. like a DRA).
\- Minimize dependencies between the Access Network (AN) and the Core Network
(CN). The architecture is defined with a converged core network with a common
AN - CN interface which integrates different Access Types e.g. 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access.
\- Support a unified authentication framework.
\- Support \"stateless\" NFs, where the \"compute\" resource is decoupled from
the \"storage\" resource.
\- Support capability exposure.
\- Support concurrent access to local and centralized services. To support low
latency services and local access to data networks, UP functions can be
deployed close to the Access Network.
\- Support roaming with both Home routed traffic as well as Local breakout
traffic in the visited PLMN.
## 4.2 Architecture reference model
### 4.2.1 General
This specification describes the architecture for the 5G System. The 5G
architecture is defined as service-based and the interaction between network
functions is represented in two ways.

services. This representation also includes point-to-point reference points
where necessary.
\- A reference point representation, shows the interaction exist between the
NF services in the network functions described by point-to-point reference
point (e.g. N11) between any two network functions (e.g. AMF and SMF).
Service-based interfaces are listed in clause 4.2.6. Reference points are
listed in clause 4.2.7.
Network functions within the 5GC Control Plane shall only use service-based
interfaces for their interactions.

NOTE 4: UPFs in the home routed scenario can be used also to support the IPUPS
functionality (see clause 5.8.2.14).

NOTE 5: The NRF is not depicted in reference point architecture figures. Refer
to Figure 4.2.4-7 for details on NRF and NF interfaces.
NOTE 6: For the sake of clarity, SEPPs are not depicted in the roaming
reference point architecture figures.

The N38 references point can be between V-SMFs in the same VPLMN, or between
V-SMFs in different VPLMNs (to enable inter-PLMN mobility).
For the roaming scenarios described above each PLMN implements proxy
functionality to secure interconnection and hide topology on the inter-PLMN
interfaces.

Operators can deploy UPFs supporting the Inter PLMN UP Security (IPUPS)
functionality at the border of their network to protect their network from
invalid inter PLMN N9 traffic in home routed roaming scenarios. The UPFs
supporting the IPUPS functionality in VPLMN and HPLMN are controlled by the
V-SMF and the H-SMF of that PDU Session respectively. A UPF supporting the
IPUPS functionality terminates GTP-U N9 tunnels. The SMF can activate the
IPUPS functionality together with other UP functionality in the same UPF, or
insert a separate UPF for the IPUPS functionality in the UP path (which e.g.
may be dedicated to be used for IPUPS functionality). Figure 4.2.4-9 depicts
the home routed roaming architecture where a UPF is inserted in the UP path
for the IPUPS functionality. Figure 4.2.4-3 depicts the home routed roaming
architecture where the two UPFs perform the IPUPS functionality and other UP
functionality for the PDU Session.
NOTE 8: Operators are not prohibited from deploying the IPUPS functionality as
a separate Network Function from the UPF, acting as a transparent proxy which
can transparently read N4 and N9 interfaces. However, such deployment option
is not specified and needs to take at least into account very long lasting PDU
Sessions with infrequent traffic and Inter-PLMN handover.
The IPUPS functionality is specified in clause 5.8.2.14 and TS 33.501 [29].

### 4.2.5 Data Storage architectures
As depicted in Figure 4.2.5-1, the 5G System architecture allows any NF to
store and retrieve its unstructured data into/from a UDSF (e.g. UE contexts).
The UDSF belongs to the same PLMN where the network function is located. CP
NFs may share a UDSF for storing their respective unstructured data or may
each have their own UDSF (e.g. a UDSF may be located close to the respective
NF).
NOTE 1: Structured data in this specification refers to data for which the
structure is defined in 3GPP specifications. Unstructured data refers to data
for which the structure is not defined in 3GPP specifications.
Figure 4.2.5-1: Data Storage Architecture for unstructured data from any NF
NOTE 2: 3GPP will specify (possibly by referencing) the N18/Nudsf interface.
As depicted in Figure 4.2.5-2, the 5G System architecture allows the UDM, PCF
and NEF to store data in the UDR, including subscription data and policy data
by UDM and PCF, structured data for exposure and application data (including
**Packet Flow Descriptions (PFDs) for application detection** , AF request
information for multiple UEs) by the NEF. UDR can be deployed in each PLMN and
it can serve different functions as follows:
\- UDR accessed by the NEF belongs to the same PLMN where the NEF is located.
\- UDR accessed by the UDM belongs to the same PLMN where the UDM is located
if UDM supports a split architecture.
\- UDR accessed by the PCF belongs to the same PLMN where the PCF is located.
NOTE 3: The UDR deployed in each PLMN can store application data for roaming
subscribers.
Figure 4.2.5-2: Data Storage Architecture
NOTE 4: There can be multiple UDRs deployed in the network, each of which can
accommodate different data sets or subsets, (e.g. subscription data,
subscription policy data, data for exposure, application data) and/or serve
different sets of NFs. Deployments where a UDR serves a single NF and stores
its data, and, thus, can be integrated with this NF, can be possible.
NOTE 5: The internal structure of the UDR in figure 4.2.5-2 is shown for
information only.
The Nudr interface is defined for the network functions (i.e. NF Service
Consumers), such as UDM, PCF and NEF, to access a particular set of the data
stored and to read, update (including add, modify), delete, and subscribe to
notification of relevant data changes in the UDR.
Each NF Service Consumer accessing the UDR, via Nudr, shall be able to add,
modify, update or delete only the data it is authorised to change. This
authorisation shall be performed by the UDR on a per data set and NF service
consumer basis and potentially on a per UE, subscription granularity.
The following data in the UDR sets exposed via Nudr to the respective NF
service consumer and stored shall be standardized**:**
\- Subscription Data,
\- Policy Data,
\- Structured Data for exposure,
\- Application data: Packet Flow Descriptions (PFDs) for application detection
and AF request information for multiple UEs, as defined in clause 5.6.7.
The service based Nudr interface defines the content and format/encoding of
the 3GPP defined information elements exposed by the data sets.
In addition, it shall be possible to access operator specific data sets by the
NF Service Consumers from the UDR as well as operator specific data for each
data set.
NOTE 6: The content and format/encoding of operator specific data and operator
specific data sets are not subject to standardization.
NOTE 7: The organization of the different data stored in the UDR is not to be
standardized.

### 4.2.8 Support of non-3GPP access
#### 4.2.8.0 General
In this Release of the specification, the following types of non-3GPP access
networks are defined:
\- Untrusted non-3GPP access networks;
\- Trusted non-3GPP access networks; and
\- Wireline access networks.
The architecture to support Untrusted and Trusted non-3GPP access networks is
defined in clause 4.2.8.2. The architecture to support Wireline access
networks is defined in clause 4.2.8.2.4 and in TS 23.316 [84].
#### 4.2.8.1 General Concepts to Support Trusted and Untrusted Non-3GPP Access
The 5G Core Network supports connectivity of UEs via non-3GPP access networks,
e.g. WLAN access networks.
Only the support of non-3GPP access networks deployed outside the NG-RAN is
described in this clause.
The 5G Core Network supports both untrusted non-3GPP access networks and
trusted non-3GPP access networks (TNANs).
An untrusted non-3GPP access network shall be connected to the 5G Core Network
via a Non-3GPP InterWorking Function (N3IWF), whereas a trusted non-3GPP
access network shall be connected to the 5G Core Network via a Trusted
Non-3GPP Gateway Function (TNGF). Both the N3IWF and the TNGF interface with
the 5G Core Network CP and UP functions via the N2 and N3 interfaces,
respectively.
A non-3GPP access network may advertise the PLMNs for which it supports
trusted connectivity and the type of supported trusted connectivity (e.g. \"5G
connectivity\"). Therefore, the UEs can discover the non-3GPP access networks
that can provide trusted connectivity to one or more PLMNs. This is further
specified in clause 6.3.12 (Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network selection).
The UE decides to use trusted or untrusted non-3GPP access for connecting to a
5G PLMN by using procedures not specified in this document. Examples of such
procedures are defined in clause 6.3.12.1.
When the UE decides to use untrusted non-3GPP access to connect to a 5G Core
Network in a PLMN:
\- the UE first selects and connects with a non-3GPP access network; and then
\- the UE selects a PLMN and an N3IWF in this PLMN. The PLMN/N3IWF selection
and the non-3GPP access network selection are independent. The N3IWF selection
is defined in clause 6.3.6.
When the UE decides to use trusted non-3GPP access to connect to a 5G Core
Network in a PLMN:
\- the UE first selects a PLMN; and then
\- the UE selects a non-3GPP access network (a TNAN) that supports trusted
connectivity to the selected PLMN. In this case, the non-3GPP access network
selection is affected by the PLMN selection.
A UE that accesses the 5G Core Network over a non-3GPP access shall, after UE
registration, support NAS signalling with 5G Core Network control-plane
functions using the N1 reference point.
When a UE is connected via a NG-RAN and via a non-3GPP access, multiple N1
instances shall exist for the UE i.e. there shall be one N1 instance over NG-
RAN and one N1 instance over non-3GPP access.
A UE simultaneously connected to the same 5G Core Network of a PLMN over a
3GPP access and a non-3GPP access shall be served by a single AMF in this 5G
Core Network.
When a UE is connected to a 3GPP access of a PLMN, if the UE selects a N3IWF
and the N3IWF is located in a PLMN different from the PLMN of the 3GPP access,
e.g. in a different VPLMN or in the HPLMN, the UE is served separately by the
two PLMNs. The UE is registered with two separate AMFs. PDU Sessions over the
3GPP access are served by V-SMFs different from the V-SMF serving the PDU
Sessions over the non-3GPP access. The same can be true when the UE uses
trusted non-3GPP access, i.e. the UE may select one PLMN for 3GPP access and a
different PLMN for trusted non-3GPP access.
NOTE: The registrations with different PLMNs over different Access Types
doesn\'t apply to UE registered for Disaster Roaming service as described in
the clause 5.40.
The PLMN selection for the 3GPP access does not depend on the PLMN that is
used for non-3GPP access. In other words, if a UE is registered with a PLMN
over a non-3GPP access, the UE performs PLMN selection for the 3GPP access
independently of this PLMN.
A UE shall establish an IPsec tunnel with the N3IWF or with the TNGF in order
to register with the 5G Core Network over non-3GPP access. Further details
about the UE registration to 5G Core Network over untrusted non-3GPP access
and over trusted non-3GPP access are described in clause 4.12.2 and in clause
4.12.2a of TS 23.502 [3], respectively.
It shall be possible to maintain the UE NAS signalling connection with the AMF
over the non-3GPP access after all the PDU Sessions for the UE over that
access have been released or handed over to 3GPP access.
N1 NAS signalling over non-3GPP accesses shall be protected with the same
security mechanism applied for N1 over a 3GPP access.
User plane QoS differentiation between UE and N3IWF is supported as described
in clause 5.7 and clause 4.12.5 of TS 23.502 [3]. QoS differentiation between
UE and TNGF is supported as described in clause 5.7 and clause 4.12a.5 of TS
23.502 [3].
#### 4.2.8.1A General Concepts to support Wireline Access
Wireline 5G Access Network (W-5GAN) shall be connected to the 5G Core Network
via a Wireline Access Gateway Function (W-AGF). The W-AGF interfaces the 5G
Core Network CP and UP functions via N2 and N3 interfaces, respectively.
For the scenario of 5G-RG connected via NG RAN the specification for UE
defined in this TS, TS 23.502 [3] and TS 23.503 [45] are applicable as defined
for UE connected to 5GC via NG RAN unless differently specified in this TS and
in TS 23.316 [84].
When a 5G-RG is connected via a NG-RAN and via a W-5GAN, multiple N1 instances
shall exist for the 5G-RG i.e. there shall be one N1 instance over NG-RAN and
one N1 instance over W-5GAN.
A 5G-RG simultaneously connected to the same 5G Core Network of a PLMN over a
3GPP access and a W-5GAN access shall be served by a single AMF in this 5G
Core Network.
5G-RG shall maintain the NAS signalling connection with the AMF over the
W-5GAN after all the PDU Sessions for the 5G-RG over that access have been
released or handed over to 3GPP access.
The 5G-RG connected to 5GC via NG-RAN is specified in TS 23.316 [84].
For the scenario of FN-RG, which is not 5G capable, connected via W-5GAN to
5GC, the W-AGF provides the N1 interface to AMF on behalf of the FN-RG.
An UE connected to a 5G-RG or FN-RG can access to the 5GC via the N3IWF or via
the TNGF where the combination of 5G-RG/FN-RG, W-AGF and UPF serving the 5G-RG
or FN-RG is acting respectively as Untrusted Non-3GPP access network or as a
Trusted Non-3GPP access network defined in clause 4.2.8.2; for example a UE is
connecting to 5G-RG by means of WLAN radio access and connected to 5GC via
N3IWF. The detailed description is specified in TS 23.316 [84].
The roaming architecture for 5G-BRG, FN-BRG, 5G-CRG and FN-CRG with the W-5GAN
is not specified in this Release. The Home Routed roaming scenario is
supported for 5G-RG connected via NG RAN, while Local Breakout scenario is not
supported.
5G Multi-Operator Core Network (5G MOCN) is supported for 5G-RG connected via
NG RAN as defined in clause 5.18

**NWu** Reference point between the UE and N3IWF for establishing secure
tunnel(s) between the UE and N3IWF so that control-plane and user-plane
exchanged between the UE and the 5G Core Network is transferred securely over
untrusted non-3GPP access.
**NWt** Reference point between the UE and the TNGF. A secure NWt connection
is established over this reference point, as specified in clause 4.12a.2.2 of
TS 23.502 [3]. NAS messages between the UE and the AMF are transferred via
this NWt connection.
**Ta** A reference point between the TNAP and the TNGF, which is used to
support an AAA interface. Ta requirements are documented in clause 4.2.8.3.2.

mobility between different TNGFs (inter-TNGF mobility).
Tn and inter-TNGF mobility are not specified in this Release of the
specification.
##### 4.2.8.3.2 Requirements on Ta
Ta shall be able to
\- Carry EAP-5G traffic and user location information before the NWt
connection is established between the UE and the TNGF.
\- Allow the UE and the TNGF to exchange IP traffic.
In deployments where the TNAP does not allocate the local IP addresses to
UE(s), Ta shall be able to:
\- Allow the UE to request and receive IP configuration from the TNAN
(including a local IP address), e.g. with DHCP. This is to allow the UE to use
an IP stack to establish a NWt connection between the UE and the TNGF.
NOTE: The \"local IP address\" is the IP address that allows the UE to contact
the TNGF; the entity providing this local IP address is part of TNAN and out
of 3GPP scope
In this Release of the specification, Ta is not specified.

#### 4.2.8.5 Access to 5GC from devices that do not support 5GC NAS over WLAN
access
##### 4.2.8.5.1 General
The devices that do not support 5GC NAS signalling over WLAN access are
referred to as \"Non-5G-Capable over WLAN\" devices, or N5CW devices for
short. A N5CW device is not capable to operate as a 5G UE that supports 5GC
NAS signalling over a WLAN access network, however, it may be capable to
operate as a 5G UE over NG-RAN.
Clause 4.2.8.5 specifies the 5GC architectural enhancements that enable N5CW
devices to access 5GC via trusted WLAN access networks. A trusted WLAN access
network is a particular type of a Trusted Non-3GPP Access Network (TNAN) that
supports a WLAN access technology, e.g. IEEE 802.11. Not all trusted WLAN
access networks support 5GC access from N5CW devices. To support 5GC access
from N5CW devices, a trusted WLAN access network must support the special
functionality specified below (e.g. it must support a TWIF function).
When a N5CW device performs an EAP-based access authentication procedure to
connect to a trusted WLAN access network, the N5CW device may simultaneously
be registered to a 5GC of a PLMN. The 5GC registration is performed by the
TWIF function (see next clause) in the trusted WLAN access network, on behalf
of the N5CW device. The type of EAP authentication procedure, which is used
during the 5GC registration to authenticate the N5CW device, is specified in
TS 33.501 [29]. In this Release of the specification, Trusted WLAN Access for
N5CW Device only supports IP PDU Session type.
##### 4.2.8.5.2 Reference Architecture
The architecture diagram below is based on the general 5GS architecture
diagrams in clause 4.2 and shows the main network functions required to
support 5GC access from N5CW devices. Other network functions are not shown
for simplicity.
Figure 4.2.8.5.2-1: Non-roaming and LBO Roaming Architecture for supporting
5GC access from N5CW devices
##### 4.2.8.5.3 Network Functions
Trusted WLAN Access Point (TWAP): It is a particular type of a Trusted
Non-3GPP Access Point (TNAP) specified in clause 4.2.8.2, that supports a WLAN
access technology, e.g. IEEE 802.11. This function is outside the scope of the
3GPP specifications.
Trusted WLAN Interworking Function (TWIF): It provides interworking
functionality that enables N5CW devices to access 5GC. The TWIF supports the
following functions:
\- Terminates the N1, N2 and N3 interfaces.
\- Implements the AMF selection procedure.
\- Implements the NAS protocol stack and exchanges NAS messages with the AMF
on behalf of the N5CW device.
\- On the user plane, it relays protocol data units (PDUs) between the Yw
interface and the N3 interface.
\- May implement a local mobility anchor within the trusted WLAN access
network.
##### 4.2.8.5.4 Reference Points
The Yt\' and Yw reference points are both outside the scope of the 3GPP
specifications. The Yt\' reference point transports WLAN messages (e.g. IEEE
802.11 messages), while the Yw reference point:
\- Shall be able to transport authentication messages between the TNAP and the
TWIF for enabling authentication of a N5CW device;
\- Shall allow the N5CW device to request and receive IP configuration from
the TWIF, including an IP address, e.g. with DHCP.
\- Shall support the transport of user-plane traffic for the N5CW device.
The N1, N2 and N3 reference points are the same reference points defined in
clause 4.2.7.
### 4.2.9 Network Analytics architecture
The Network Analytics architecture is defined in TS 23.288 [86].
### 4.2.10 Architecture Reference Model for ATSSS Support
In order to support the ATSSS feature, the 5G System Architecture is extended
as shown in Figure 4.2.10-1, Figure 4.2.10-2 and Figure 4.2.10-3. The
additional functionality that is supported by the UE and the network functions
shown in these figures is specified in clause 5.32 below. In summary:
\- The UE supports one or more of the steering functionalities specified in
clause 5.32.6, e.g. MPTCP functionality and/or ATSSS-LL functionality. Each
steering functionality in the UE enables traffic steering, switching and
splitting across 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, in accordance with the ATSSS
rules provided by the network. The ATSSS-LL functionality is mandatory in the
UE for MA PDU Session of type Ethernet.
\- The UPF may support MPTCP Proxy functionality, which communicates with the
MPTCP functionality in the UE by using the MPTCP protocol (IETF RFC 8684
[81]).
\- The UPF may support ATSSS-LL functionality, which is similar to the ATSSS-
LL functionality defined for the UE. There is no user plane protocol defined
between the ATSSS-LL functionality in the UE and the ATSSS-LL functionality in
the UPF. The ATSSS-LL functionality in the UPF is not shown in the following
three figures.
NOTE 1: ATSSS-LL functionality is needed in the 5GC for MA PDU Session of type
Ethernet.
\- In addition, the UPF supports Performance Measurement Functionality (PMF),
which may be used by the UE to obtain access performance measurements (see
clause 5.32.5) over the user-plane of 3GPP access and/or over the user-plane
of non-3GPP access.
\- The AMF, SMF and PCF are extended with new functionality that is further
discussed in clause 5.32.
Figure 4.2.10-1: Non-roaming and Roaming with Local Breakout architecture for
ATSSS support
NOTE 2: The interactions between the UE and PCF that may be required for ATSSS
control are specified in TS 23.503 [45].
NOTE 3: A UPF that supports the MPTCP Proxy functionality and the PMF can be
connected via an N9 reference point, instead of the N3 reference point.
Figure 4.2.10-2 shows the 5G System Architecture for ATSSS support in a
roaming case with home-routed traffic and when the UE is registered to the
same VPLMN over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses. In this case, the MPTCP Proxy
functionality and the PMF are located in the H-UPF.
Figure 4.2.10-2: Roaming with Home-routed architecture for ATSSS support (UE
registered to the same VPLMN)
Figure 4.2.10-3 shows the 5G System Architecture for ATSSS support in a
roaming case with home-routed traffic and when the UE is registered to a VPLMN
over 3GPP access and to HPLMN over non-3GPP access (i.e. the UE is registered
to different PLMNs). In this case, the MPTCP Proxy functionality and the PMF
are located in the H-UPF.

registered to different PLMNs)
### 4.2.11 Architecture for 5G multicast-broadcast services
The architecture for 5G multicast-broadcast services is defined in TS 23.247
[129].
### 4.2.12 Architecture for Proximity based Services (ProSe) in 5GS
The architecture for Proximity based Services (ProSe) in the 5G System is
defined in TS 23.304 [128].
### 4.2.13 Architecture enhancements for Edge Computing
The architecture enhancements for edge computing are outlined in clause 5.13
and further described in TS 23.548 [130].
### 4.2.14 Architecture for Support of Uncrewed Aerial Systems connectivity,
identification and tracking
The architecture for Support of Uncrewed Aerial Systems (UAS) connectivity,
identification and tracking is defined in TS 23.256 [136].
### 4.2.15 Architecture to support WLAN connection using 5G credentials
without 5GS registration
The reference architecture shown with reference point representation in Figure
4.2.15-1 and with Service Based Interface (SBI)-representation in Figure
4.2.15-2, enables a UE to connect to a WLAN access network using its 5GS
credentials without registration to 5GS. This architecture is based on the
Non-Seamless WLAN Offload Function (NSWOF), which interfaces to the WLAN
access network using the SWa\' reference point and interfaces to the AUSF
using the Nausf SBI. The SWa\' reference point corresponds to SWa reference
point as defined in TS 23.402 [43] with the difference that SWa\' connects the
Untrusted non-3GPP IP Access, possibly via 3GPP AAA Proxy, to the NSWOF and
that the EAP user ID is a SUCI and not an IMSI.
The functionality of the NSWOF and the procedures applied for supporting a
WLAN connection using 5GS credentials for Non-seamless WLAN offload are
further defined in TS 33.501 [29] Annex S. The roaming architectures are shown
with reference point representation in Figure 4.2.15-3 and with SBI
representation in Figure 4.2.15-4.
The UE can also connect to a WLAN access network using 5GS credentials by
performing the 5GS registration via Trusted non-3GPP access procedure defined
in clause 4.12a.2.2 of TS 23.502 [03]. With this procedure, the UE connects to
a WLAN access network using 5GS credentials and simultaneously registers in
5GS. However, the architecture defined in Figure 4.2.15-1, Figure 4.2.15-2,
Figure 4.2.15-3 and in Figure 4.2.15-4, enables a UE to connect to a WLAN
access network using 5GS credentials but without registration in 5GS.
If the WLAN is configured as Untrusted Non-3GPP access, in the case that the
WLAN supports IEEE 802.1x, the UE may first use the 5G NSWO procedure to
obtain a connection with and the local IP address from the WLAN, and any time
after that, the UE may initiate the Untrusted Non-3GPP Access to obtain the
access to 5GC.
Figure 4.2.15-1: Reference architecture to support authentication for Non-
seamless WLAN offload in 5GS
Figure 4.2.15-2: Service based reference architecture to support
authentication for Non-seamless WLAN offload in 5GS
Figure 4.2.15-3: Roaming reference architectures to support authentication for
Non-seamless WLAN offload in 5GS
NOTE: Configuration 2) in Figure 4.2.15-3 is a deployment variant of
configuration 1)
Figure 4.2.15-4: Service based Roaming reference architecture to support
authentication for Non-seamless WLAN offload in 5GS
The SWd\' reference point corresponds to the SWd reference point as defined in
TS 23.402 [43] with the difference that SWd\' connects the 3GPP AAA Proxy,
possibly via intermediate 3GPP AAA Proxy, to the NSWOF and that the EAP user
ID is a SUCI and not an IMSI.
In both roaming and non-roaming scenarios, the NSWOF acts towards the WLAN
Access as a 3GPP AAA server, with the difference that the EAP user ID is a
SUCI and not an IMSI.
## 4.3 Interworking with EPC
### 4.3.1 Non-roaming architecture
Figure 4.3.1-1 represents the non-roaming architecture for interworking
between 5GS and EPC/E-UTRAN.
Figure 4.3.1-1: Non-roaming architecture for interworking between 5GS and
EPC/E-UTRAN
NOTE 1: N26 interface is an inter-CN interface between the MME and 5GS AMF in
order to enable interworking between EPC and the NG core. Support of N26
interface in the network is optional for interworking. N26 supports subset of
the functionalities (essential for interworking) that are supported over S10.
NOTE 2: PGW-C + SMF and UPF + PGW-U are dedicated for interworking between 5GS
and EPC, which are optional and are based on UE MM Core Network Capability and
UE subscription. UEs that are not subject to 5GS and EPC interworking may be
served by entities not dedicated for interworking, i.e. by either by PGW or
SMF/UPF.
NOTE 3: There can be another UPF (not shown in the figure above) between the
NG-RAN and the UPF + PGW-U, i.e. the UPF + PGW-U can support N9 towards an
additional UPF, if needed.
NOTE 4: Figures and procedures in this specification that depict an SGW make
no assumption whether the SGW is deployed as a monolithic SGW or as an SGW
split into its control-plane and user-plane functionality as described in TS
23.214 [32].

additional UPF, if needed.
NOTE 2: N26 interface is not precluded, but it is not shown in the figure
because it is not required for the interworking between 5GC via non-3GPP
access and EPC/E-UTRAN.

interface is optional (see clause 4.11.4.3.6 of TS 23.502 [3]).
### 4.3.5 Service Exposure in Interworking Scenarios
#### 4.3.5.1 Non-roaming architecture
Figure 4.3.5.1-1 shows the non-roaming architecture for Service Exposure for
EPC-5GC Interworking. If the UE is capable of mobility between EPS and 5GS,
the network is expected to associate the UE with an SCEF+NEF node for Service
Capability Exposure.
Figure 4.3.5.1 1: Non-roaming Service Exposure Architecture for EPC-5GC
Interworking
NOTE 1: In Figure 4.3.5.1-1, Trust domain for SCEF+NEF is same as Trust domain
for SCEF as defined in TS 23.682 [36].
NOTE 2: In Figure 4.3.5.1-1, EPC Interface represents southbound interfaces
between SCEF and EPC nodes e.g. the S6t interface between SCEF and HSS, the
T6a interface between SCEF and MME, etc. All southbound interfaces from SCEF
are defined in TS 23.682 [36] and are not shown for the sake of simplicity.
NOTE 3: In Figure 4.3.5.1-1, 5GC Interface represents southbound interfaces
between NEF and 5GC Network Functions e.g. N29 interface between NEF and SMF,
N30 interface between NEF and PCF, etc. All southbound interfaces from NEF are
not shown for the sake of simplicity.
NOTE 4: Interaction between the SCEF and NEF within the combined SCEF+NEF is
required. For example, when the SCEF+NEF supports monitoring APIs, the SCEF
and NEF need to share context and state information on a UE\'s configured
monitoring events if the UE moves between from EPC and 5GC.
NOTE 5: The north-bound APIs which can be supported by an EPC or 5GC network
are discovered by the SCEF+NEF node via the CAPIF function and/or via local
configuration of the SCEF+NEF node. Different sets of APIs can be supported by
the two network types.

EPC-5GC Interworking. This architecture is applicable to both the home routed
roaming and local breakout roaming.

elements or network functions that may be connected to SCEF+NEF.
## 4.4 Specific services
### 4.4.1 Public Warning System
The Public Warning System architecture for 5G System is specified in TS 23.041
[46].
### 4.4.2 SMS over NAS
#### 4.4.2.0 General
This clause introduces legacy SMS over NAS architecture, in which the
interfaces between SMSF/UDM and SMS-GMSC/SMS-IWMSC/IP-SM-GW/SMS Router are
still based on legacy protocol (i.e. MAP or Diameter).
The SBI-based SMS architecture and interfaces are specified in TS 23.540
[142].
#### 4.4.2.1 Architecture to support SMS over NAS
Figure 4.4.2.1-1 shows the non-roaming architecture to support SMS over NAS
using the Service-based interfaces within the Control Plane.
Figure 4.4.2.1-1: Non-roaming System Architecture for SMS over NAS
Figure 4.4.2.1-2 shows the non-roaming architecture to support SMS over NAS
using the reference point representation.
Figure 4.4.2.1-2: Non-roaming System Architecture for SMS over NAS in
reference point representation
NOTE 1: SMS Function (SMSF) may be connected to the SMS-GMSC/IWMSC/SMS Router
via one of the standardized interfaces as shown in TS 23.040 [5].
NOTE 2: UDM may be connected to the SMS-GMSC/IWMSC/SMS Router via one of the
standardized interfaces as shown in TS 23.040 [5].
NOTE 3: Each UE is associated with only one SMS Function in the registered
PLMN.
NOTE 4: SMSF re-allocation while the UE is in RM‑REGISTERED state in the
serving PLMN is not supported in this Release of the specification. When
serving AMF is re-allocated for a given UE, the source AMF includes SMSF
identifier as part of UE context transfer to target AMF. If the target AMF,
e.g. in the case of inter-PLMN mobility, detects that no SMSF has been
selected in the serving PLMN, then the AMF performs SMSF selection as
specified in clause 6.3.10.
NOTE 5: To support MT SMS domain selection by IP-SM-GW/SMS Router, IP-SM-
GW/SMS Router may connect to SGs MSC, MME and SMSF via one of the standardized
interfaces as shown in TS 23.040 [5].
Figure 4.4.2.1-3 shows the roaming architecture to support SMS over NAS using
the Service-based interfaces within the Control Plane.

Following reference points are realized by service based interfaces:
**N8:** Reference point for SMS Subscription data retrieval between AMF and
UDM.
**N20:** Reference point for SMS transfer between AMF and SMS Function.
**N21:** Reference point for SMS Function address registration management and
SMS Management Subscription data retrieval between SMS Function and UDM.
#### 4.4.2.3 Service based interface to support SMS over NAS
**Nsmsf:** Service-based interface exhibited by SMSF.
### 4.4.3 IMS support
IMS support for 5GC is defined in TS 23.228 [15].
The 5G System architecture supports N5 interface between PCF and P-CSCF and
supports Rx interface between PCF and P-CSCF, to enable IMS service. See TS
23.228 [15], TS 23.503 [45] and TS 23.203 [4].
NOTE 1: Rx support between PCF and P-CSCF is for backwards compatibility for
early deployments using Diameter between IMS and 5GC functions.
NOTE 2: When service based interfaces are used between the PCF and P-CSCF in
the same PLMN, the P-CSCF performs the functions of a trusted AF in the 5GC.
### 4.4.4 Location services
#### 4.4.4.1 Architecture to support Location Services
Location Service feature is optional and applicable to both regulatory
services and commercial services in this Release of the specification. The
non-roaming and roaming architecture to support Location Services are defined
in clause 4.2 of TS 23.273 [87].
#### 4.4.4.2 Reference point to support Location Services
The reference points to support Location Services are defined in clause 4.4 of
TS 23.273 [87].
#### 4.4.4.3 Service Based Interfaces to support Location Services
The Service Based Interfaces to support Location Services are defined in
clause 4.5 of TS 23.273 [87].
### 4.4.5 Application Triggering Services
See clause 5.2.6.1 of TS 23.502 [3].
Application trigger message contains information that allows the network to
route the message to the appropriate UE and the UE to route the message to the
appropriate application. The information destined to the application,
excluding the information to route it, is referred to as the Trigger payload.
The Trigger payload is implementation specific.
NOTE: The application in the UE may perform actions indicated by the Trigger
payload when the Triggered payload is received at the UE. For example
initiation of immediate or later communication with the application server
based on the information contained in the Trigger payload, which includes the
PDU Session Establishment procedure if the related PDU Session is not already
established.
### 4.4.6 5G LAN-type Services
#### 4.4.6.1 User plane architecture to support 5G LAN-type service
The general User Plane architectures described in clause 4.2.3 and clause

between different PDU Sessions without using N6. It has a per 5G VN group
granularity.
### 4.4.7 MSISDN-less MO SMS Service
MSISDN-less MO SMS via T4 is subscription based. The subscription provides the
information whether a UE is allowed to originate MSISDN-less MO SMS.
The UE is pre-configured with the Service Centre address that points to SMS-SC
that performs this MO SMS delivery via NEF delivery procedure. The recipient
of this short message is set to the pre-configured address of the AF (i.e.
Address of the destination SME). If UE has multiple GPSIs associated to the
same IMSI, the GPSI that is associated with an SMS may be determined from the
UE\'s IMSI and the Application Port ID value in the TP-User-Data field (see TS
23.040 [5]). The NEF may obtain the GPSI by querying the UDM with the IMSI and
application port ID.
UE is aware whether the MO SMS delivery status (success or fail) based on the
SMS delivery report from SMS-SC. The network does not perform any storing and
forwarding functionality for MO SMS.
See clause 5.2.6 of TS 23.502 [3] for a description of NEF Services and
Service Operations.
### 4.4.8 Architecture to enable Time Sensitive Communication and Time
Synchronization
#### 4.4.8.1 General
The 5G System can be extended to support the following:
a) Integration as a bridge in an IEEE 802.1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN).
The 5GS bridge supports the Time sensitive communication as defined in IEEE
802.1 Time Sensitive Networking (TSN) standards. The architecture is described
in clause 4.4.8.2.
This Release supports of the specification, integration of the 5G System with
IEEE 802.1 TSN networks that apply the fully centralized configuration model
as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Qcc [95]. IEEE TSN is a set of standards to define
mechanisms for the time-sensitive (i.e. deterministic) transmission of data
over Ethernet networks.
b) Enablers for AF requested support of Time Synchronization and/or some
aspects of Time Sensitive Communication. The architecture is described in
clause 4.4.8.3.
#### 4.4.8.2 Architecture to support IEEE Time Sensitive Networking
The 5G System is integrated with the external network as a TSN bridge. This
\"logical\" TSN bridge (see Figure 4.4.8.2-1) includes TSN Translator
functionality for interoperation between TSN Systems and 5G System both for
user plane and control plane. 5GS TSN translator functionality consists of
Device-side TSN translator (DS-TT) and Network-side TSN translator (NW-TT).
The TSN AF is part of 5GC and provides the control plane translator
functionality for the integration of the 5GS with a TSN network, e.g. the
interactions with the CNC. 5G System specific procedures in 5GC and RAN,
wireless communication links, etc. remain hidden from the TSN network. To
achieve such transparency to the TSN network and the 5GS to appear as any
other TSN Bridge, the 5GS provides TSN ingress and egress ports via DS-TT and
NW-TT. DS-TT and NW-TT optionally support:
\- hold and forward functionality for the purpose of de-jittering;
\- per-stream filtering and policing as defined in clause 8.6.5.1 of IEEE Std
802.1Q [98].
DS-TT optionally supports link layer connectivity discovery and reporting as
defined in IEEE Std 802.1AB [97] for discovery of Ethernet devices attached to
DS-TT. NW-TT supports link layer connectivity discovery and reporting as
defined in IEEE Std 802.1AB [97] for discovery of Ethernet devices attached to
NW-TT. If a DS-TT does not support link layer connectivity discovery and
reporting, then NW-TT performs link layer connectivity discovery and reporting
as defined in IEEE Std 802.1AB [97] for discovery of Ethernet devices attached
to DS-TT on behalf of DS-TT.
NOTE 1: If NW-TT performs link layer connectivity discovery and reporting on
behalf of DS-TT, it is assumed that LLDP frames are transmitted between NW-TT
and UE on the QoS Flow with the default QoS rule as defined in the clause
5.7.1.1. Alternatively, SMF can establish a dedicated QoS Flow matching on the
Ethertype defined for LLDP (IEEE Std 802.1AB [97]).
There are three TSN configuration models defined in IEEE Std 802.1Qcc [95].
Amongst the three models:
\- fully centralized model is supported in this Release of the specification;
\- fully distributed model is not supported in this Release of the
specification;
\- centralized network/distributed user model is not supported in this Release
of the specification.
NOTE 2: This Release supports interworking with TSN using clause 8.6.8.4 of
IEEE Std 802.1Q [98] scheduled traffic and clause 8.6.5.1 of IEEE Std 802.1Q
[98] per-stream filtering and policy.
Figure 4.4.8.2-1: System architecture view with 5GS appearing as TSN bridge
NOTE 3: Whether DS-TT and UE are combined or are separate is up to
implementation.
NOTE 4: TSN AF does not need to support N33 in this release of the
specification.
#### 4.4.8.3 Architecture for AF requested support of Time Sensitive
Communication and Time Synchronization
This clause describes the architecture to enable Time Sensitive Communication
AF requested time sensitive communication and time synchronization services.
The Time Sensitive Communication and Time Synchronization related features
that are supported based on AF request are described in clauses 5.27.1 and
5.27.2, respectively. Figure 4.4.8.3-1 shows the architecture to support Time
Sensitive Communication and Time Synchronization services.
As shown in Figure 4.4.8.3-1, to support Time Synchronization service based on
IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] or IEEE Std 1588 [126] for Ethernet or IP type PDU
Sessions, the DS-TT, NW-TT and Time Sensitive Communication and Time
Synchronization Function (TSCTSF) are required in order to support the
features in IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] or IEEE Std 1588 [126] as described in
clause 5.27. The NEF exposes 5GS capability to support Time Synchronization
service as described in clause 5.27.1.8. TSCTSF controls the DS-TT(s) and NW-
TT for the (g)PTP based time synchronization service. In addition, TSCTSF
supports TSC assistance container related functionalities.
Figure 4.4.8.3-1: Architecture to enable Time Sensitive Communication and Time
Synchronization services
NOTE 1: If the AF is considered to be trusted by the operator, the AF could
interact directly with TSCTSF, the connection between AF and TSCTSF is not
depicted in the architecture diagram for brevity.
UPF/NW-TT distributes the (g)PTP messages as described in clause 5.27.1.
When the UPF supports one or more NW-TT(s), there is one-to-one association
between an NW-TT and the network instance or between an NW-TT and network
instance together with DNN/S-NSSAI in the UPF. When there are multiple network
instances within a UPF, each network instance is considered logically
separate. The network instance for the N6 interface (clause 5.6.12) may be
indicated by the SMF to the UPF for a given PDU Session during PDU Session
establishment procedure. UPF allocates resources based on the Network Instance
and S-NSSAI and it is supported according to TS 29.244 [65]. DNN/S-NSSAI may
be indicated by the SMF together with the network instance to the UPF for a
given PDU Session during PDU Session establishment procedure.
NOTE 2: The same NW-TT is used for all PDU Sessions in the UPF for the given
DNN/S-NSSAI; the NW-TT is unique per DNN/S-NSSAI. This ensures that the UPF
selects an N4 session associated with the correct TSCTSF when the NW-TT
initiates an UMIC or PMIC. At any given time, the NW-TT is associated with a
single TSCTSF.
# 5 High level features
## 5.1 General
Clause 5 specifies the high level functionality and features of the 5G System
for both 3GPP and Non-3GPP access and for the interoperability with the EPC
defined in TS 23.401 [26].
## 5.2 Network Access Control
### 5.2.1 General
Network access is the means for the user to connect to 5G CN. Network access
control comprises the following functionality:
\- Network selection,
\- Identification and authentication,
\- Authorisation,
\- Access control and barring,
\- Policy control,
\- Lawful Interception.
### 5.2.2 Network selection
In order to determine to which PLMN to attempt registration, the UE performs
network selection. The network selection procedure comprises two main parts,
PLMN selection and access network selection. The requirements for the PLMN
selection are specified in TS 22.011 [25] and the procedures are in TS 23.122
[17]. The access network selection part for the 3GPP access networks is
specified in TS 36.300 [30] for E-UTRAN and in TS 38.300 [27] for the NR.
The network selection for the Disaster Roaming is described in TS 23.122 [17]
and TS 24.501 [47].
### 5.2.2a Void
### 5.2.3 Identification and authentication
The network may authenticate the UE during any procedure establishing a NAS
signalling connection with the UE. The security architecture is specified in
TS 33.501 [29]. The network may optionally perform an PEI check with 5G-EIR.
### 5.2.4 Authorisation
The authorisation for connectivity of the subscriber to the 5GC and the
authorization for the services that the user is allowed to access based on
subscription (e.g. Operator Determined Barring, Roaming restrictions, Access
Type and RAT Type currently in use) is evaluated once the user is successfully
identified and authenticated. This authorization is executed during UE
Registration procedure.
### 5.2.5 Access control and barring
When the UE needs to transmit an initial NAS message, the UE shall request to
establish an RRC Connection first and the NAS shall provide the RRC
establishment related information to the lower layer. The RAN handles the RRC
Connection with priority during and after RRC Connection Establishment
procedure, when UE indicates priority in Establishment related information
Under high network load conditions, the network may protect itself against
overload by using the Unified Access Control functionality for 3GPP access
specified in TS 22.261 [2], TS 24.501 [47] and TS 38.300 [27] to limit access
attempts from UEs. Depending on network configuration, the network may
determine whether certain access attempt should be allowed or blocked based on
categorized criteria, as specified in TS 22.261 [2] and TS 24.501 [47]. The
NG-RAN may broadcast barring control information associated with Access
Categories and Access Identities as specified in TS 38.300 [27].
The NG-RAN node may initiate such Unified Access Control when:
\- AMFs request to restrict the load for UEs that access the network by
sending OVERLOAD START message containing conditions defined in clause
5.19.5.2, or
\- requested by OAM, or
\- triggered by NG-RAN itself.
If the NG-RAN node takes a decision to initiate UAC because of the reception
of the N2 interface OVERLOAD START messages, the NG-RAN should only initiate
such procedure if all the AMFs relevant to the request contained in the
OVERLOAD START message and connected to this NG-RAN node request to restrict
the load for UEs that access the network.
If the UE supports both N1 and S1 modes NAS and, as defined in TS 23.401 [26],
the UE is configured for Extended Access Barring (EAB) but is not configured
with a permission for overriding Extended Access Barring (EAB), when the UE
wants to access the 5GS it shall perform Unified Access Control checks for
Access Category 1 on receiving an indication from the upper layers as defined
in TS 24.501 [47], TS 38.331 [28], TS 36.331 [51].
If the UE supports both N1 and S1 modes NAS and, as defined in TS 23.401 [26],
the UE is configured with a permission for overriding Extended Access Barring
(EAB), when the UE wants to access the 5GS it shall ignore Unified Access
Control checks for Access Category 1 on receiving an indication from the upper
layers, as defined in TS 24.501 [47].
NOTE: UE signalling of Low Access Priority indication over N1 in 5GS is not
supported in this release of the specification.
Operator may provide one or more PLMN-specific Operator-defined access
category definitions to the UE using NAS signalling, and the UE handles the
Operator-defined access category definitions stored for the Registered PLMN,
as specified in TS 24.501 [47].
The access control for the Disaster Roaming is described in TS 23.122 [17] and
TS 24.501 [47].
### 5.2.6 Policy control
Network access control including service authorization may be influenced by
Policy control, as specified in clause 5.14.
### 5.2.7 Lawful Interception
For definition and functionality of Lawful Interception, please see TS 33.126
[35].
## 5.3 Registration and Connection Management
### 5.3.1 General
The Registration Management is used to register or deregister a UE/user with
the network, and establish the user context in the network. The Connection
Management is used to establish and release the signalling connection between
the UE and the AMF.
### 5.3.2 Registration Management
#### 5.3.2.1 General
A UE/user needs to register with the network to receive services that requires
registration. Once registered and if applicable the UE updates its
registration with the network (see TS 23.502 [3]):
\- periodically, in order to remain reachable (Periodic Registration Update);
or
\- upon mobility (Mobility Registration Update); or
\- to update its capabilities or re-negotiate protocol parameters (Mobility
Registration Update).
The Initial Registration procedure involves execution of Network Access
Control functions as defined in clause 5.2 (i.e. user authentication and
access authorization based on subscription profiles in UDM). As result of the
Registration procedure, the identifier of the serving AMF serving the UE in
the access through which the UE has registered will be registered in UDM.
The registration management procedures are applicable over both 3GPP access
and Non-3GPP access. The 3GPP and Non-3GPP RM states are independent of each
other, see clause 5.3.2.4.
#### 5.3.2.2 5GS Registration Management states
##### 5.3.2.2.1 General
Two RM states are used in the UE and the AMF that reflect the registration
status of the UE in the selected PLMN:
\- RM-DEREGISTERED.
\- RM-REGISTERED.
##### 5.3.2.2.2 RM-DEREGISTERED state
In the RM‑DEREGISTERED state, the UE is not registered with the network. The
UE context in AMF holds no valid location or routing information for the UE so
the UE is not reachable by the AMF. However, some parts of UE context may
still be stored in the UE and the AMF e.g. to avoid running an authentication
procedure during every Registration procedure.
In the RM-DEREGISTERED state, the UE shall:
\- attempt to register with the selected PLMN using the Initial Registration
procedure if it needs to receive service that requires registration (see
clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]).
\- remain in RM-DEREGISTERED state if receiving a Registration Reject upon
Initial Registration (see clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]).
\- enter RM-REGISTERED state upon receiving a Registration Accept (see clause
4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]).
When the UE RM state in the AMF is RM-DEREGISTERED, the AMF shall:
\- when applicable, accept the Initial Registration of a UE by sending a
Registration Accept to this UE and enter RM-REGISTERED state for the UE (see
clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]); or
\- when applicable, reject the Initial Registration of a UE by sending a
Registration Reject to this UE (see clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]).
##### 5.3.2.2.3 RM-REGISTERED state
In the RM‑REGISTERED state, the UE is registered with the network. In the RM-
REGISTERED state, the UE can receive services that require registration with
the network.
In the RM-REGISTERED state, the UE shall:
\- perform Mobility Registration Update procedure if the current TAI of the
serving cell (see TS 37.340 [31]) is not in the list of TAIs that the UE has
received from the network in order to maintain the registration and enable the
AMF to page the UE;
NOTE: Additional considerations for Mobility Registration Update in case of NR
satellite access are provided in clause 5.4.11.6.
\- perform Periodic Registration Update procedure triggered by expiration of
the periodic update timer to notify the network that the UE is still active.
\- perform a Mobility Registration Update procedure to update its capability
information or to re-negotiate protocol parameters with the network;
\- perform Deregistration procedure (see clause 4.2.2.3.1 of TS 23.502 [3]),
and enter RM-DEREGISTERED state, when the UE needs to be no longer registered
with the PLMN. The UE may decide to deregister from the network at any time.
\- enter RM-DEREGISTERED state when receiving a Registration Reject message or
a Deregistration message. The actions of the UE depend upon the cause value\'
in the Registration Reject or Deregistration message. See clause 4.2.2 of TS
23.502 [3].
When the UE RM state in the AMF is RM-REGISTERED, the AMF shall:
\- perform Deregistration procedure (see clauses 4.2.2.3.2, 4.2.2.3.3 of TS
23.502 [3]), and enter RM-DEREGISTERED state for the UE, when the UE needs to
be no longer registered with the PLMN. The network may decide to deregister
the UE at any time;
\- perform Implicit Deregistration at any time after the Implicit
Deregistration timer expires. The AMF shall enter RM-DEREGISTERED state for
the UE after Implicit Deregistration;
\- when applicable, accept or reject Registration Requests or Service Requests
from the UE.
##### 5.3.2.2.4 5GS Registration Management State models
Figure 5.3.2.2.4-1: RM state model in UE
Figure 5.3.2.2.4-2: RM state model in AMF
#### 5.3.2.3 Registration Area management
Registration Area management comprises the functions to allocate and
reallocate a Registration area to a UE. Registration area is managed per
access type i.e. 3GPP access or Non-3GPP access.
When a UE registers with the network over the 3GPP access, the AMF allocates a
set of tracking areas in TAI List to the UE. When the AMF allocates
registration area, i.e. the set of tracking areas in TAI List, to the UE it
may take into account various information (e.g. Mobility Pattern and
Allowed/Non-Allowed Area (refer to clause 5.3.4.1)). An AMF which has the
whole PLMN as serving area may alternatively allocate the whole PLMN (\"all
PLMN\") as registration area to a UE in MICO mode (refer to clause 5.4.1.3).
When AMF allocates registration area for UE registered for Disaster Roaming
service as specified in clause 5.40.4, AMF shall only consider TAIs covering
the area with the Disaster Condition.
The 5G System shall support allocating a Registration Area using a single TAI
List which includes tracking areas of any NG-RAN nodes in the Registration
Area for a UE.
TAI used for non-3GPP access shall be dedicated to non-3GPP access. TAI(s)
dedicated to Non-3GPP access may be defined in a PLMN and apply within this
PLMN. Each N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF is locally configured with one TAI
value. Each N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF may be configured with a different TAI
value or with the same TAI value as other N3IWFs, TNGFs, TWIFs and/or W-AGFs.
The TAI is provided to the AMF during N2 interface setup and as part of the
User Location Information in UE associated messages as described in TS 38.413
[34].
When a UE registers with the network over a Non-3GPP access, the AMF allocates
to the UE a registration area that only includes the TAI received from the
serving N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF or W-AGF.
NOTE 1: For example, two W-AGFs can each correspond to a different TAI (one
TAI per W-AGF) and thus support different sets of S-NSSAI(s).
When generating the TAI list, the AMF shall include only TAIs that are
applicable on the access type (i.e. 3GPP access or Non-3GPP access) where the
TAI list is sent.
NOTE 2: To prevent extra signalling load resulting from Mobility Registration
Update occurring at every RAT change, it is preferable to avoid generating a
RAT-specific TAI list for a UE supporting more than one RAT.
NOTE 3: For a UE registered on N3GPP access the TAI(s) provided to the UE as
part of the Registration Area is expected to enable the support of the slices
that are intended to be provided for this UE over this specific Non-3GPP
access. In addition, the Registration Area provided to the UE for non-3GPP
access will never change until the UE deregisters from non-3GPP access (either
explicit deregistration or implicit deregistration due to Deregistration timer
expiring due to UE entering CM_IDLE state).
For all 3GPP Access RATs in NG-RAN and for Non-3GPP Access, the 5G System
supports the TAI format as specified in TS 23.003 [19] consisting of MCC, MNC
and a 3-byte TAC only.
The additional aspects for registration management when a UE is registered
over one access type while the UE is already registered over the other access
type is further described in clause 5.3.2.4.
To ensure a UE initiates a Mobility Registration procedure when performing
inter-RAT mobility to or from NB-IoT, a Tracking Area shall not contain both
NB-IoT and other RATs cells (e.g. WB-E-UTRA, NR), and the AMF shall not
allocate a TAI list that contains both NB-IoT and other RATs Tracking Areas.
For 3GPP access the AMF determines the RAT type the UE is camping on based on
the Global RAN Node IDs associated with the N2 interface and additionally the
Tracking Area indicated by NG-RAN. When the UE is accessing NR using
unlicensed bands, as defined in clause 5.4.8, an indication is provided in N2
interface as defined in TS 38.413 [34].
The AMF may also determine more precise RAT Type information based on further
information received from NG-RAN:
\- The AMF may determine the RAT Type to be LTE-M as defined in clause
5.31.20; or
\- The AMF may determine the RAT Type to be NR using unlicensed bands, as
defined in clause 5.4.8.
\- The AMF may determine the RAT Type to be one of the RAT types for satellite
access, as defined in clause 5.4.10.
\- The AMF may determine the RAT Type to be NR RedCap as defined in clause
5.41.
For Non-3GPP accesses the AMF determines the RAT type the UE is camping based
on the 5G-AN node associated with N2 interface as follows:
\- The RAT type is Untrusted Non-3GPP if the 5G-AN node has a Global N3IWF
Node ID;
\- The RAT type is Trusted Non-3GPP if the 5G-AN node has a Global TNGF Node
ID or a Global TWIF Node ID; and
\- The RAT type is Wireline -BBF if the 5G-AN node has a Global W-AGF Node ID
corresponding to a W-AGF supporting the Wireline BBF Access Network. The RAT
type is Wireline-Cable if the 5G-AN node has a Global W-AGF Node ID
corresponding to a W-AGF supporting the Wireline Cable Access Network. If not
possible to distinguish between the two, the RAT type is Wireline.
NOTE 4: How to differentiate between W-AGF supporting either Wireline BBF
Access Network or the Wireline (e.g. different Global W-AGF Node ID IE or the
Global W-AGF Node ID including a field to distinguish between them) is left to
Stage 3 definition.
NOTE 5: If an operator supports only one kind of Wireline Access Network
(either Wireline BBF Access Network or a Wireline Cable Access Network) the
AMF may be configured to use RAT type Wireline or the specific one.
For Non-3GPP access the AMF may also use the User Location Information
provided at N2 connection setup to determine a more precise RAT Type, e.g.
identifying IEEE 802.11 access, Wireline-Cable access, Wireline-BBF access.
When the 5G-AN node has either a Global N3IWF Node ID, or a Global TNGF Node
ID, or a Global TWIF Node ID, or a Global W-AGF Node ID, the Access Type is
Non-3GPP Access.
#### 5.3.2.4 Support of a UE registered over both 3GPP and Non-3GPP access
This clause applies to Non-3GPP access network corresponding to the Untrusted
Non-3GPP access network, to the Trusted Non-3GPP and to the W-5GAN. In the
case of W-5GAN the UE mentioned in this clause corresponds to the 5G-RG.
For a given serving PLMN there is one RM context for a UE for each access,
e.g. when the UE is consecutively or simultaneously served by a 3GPP access
and by a non-3GPP access (i.e. via an N3IWF, TNGF and W-AGF) of the same PLMN.
UDM manages separate/independent UE Registration procedures for each access.
When served by the same PLMN for 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, an UE is served
by the same AMF except in the temporary situation described in clause 5.17
i.e. after a mobility from EPS while the UE has PDU Sessions associated with
non-3GPP access.
The 5G NSWO authentication as defined in Annex S of TS 33.501 [29] does not
impact the RM state.
An AMF associates multiple access-specific RM contexts for an UE with:
\- a 5G-GUTI that is common to both 3GPP and Non-3GPP accesses. This 5G-GUTI
is globally unique.
\- a Registration state per access type (3GPP / Non-3GPP)
\- a Registration Area per access type: one Registration Area for 3GPP access
and another Registration Area for non 3GPP access. Registration Areas for the
3GPP access and the Non-3GPP access are independent.
\- timers for 3GPP access:
\- a Periodic Registration timer; and
\- a Mobile Reachable timer and an Implicit Deregistration timer.
\- timers for non-3GPP access:
\- a UE Non-3GPP Deregistration timer; and
\- a Network Non-3GPP Implicit Deregistration timer.
The AMF shall not provide a Periodic Registration Timer for the UE over a
Non-3GPP access. Consequently, the UE need not perform Periodic Registration
Update procedure over Non-3GPP access. Instead, during the Initial
Registration procedure and Re-registration, the UE is provided by the network
with a UE Non-3GPP Deregistration timer that starts when the UE enters
non-3GPP CM-IDLE state.
When the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access for the same UE are served by the
same PLMN, the AMF assigns the same 5G-GUTI for use over both accesses. Such a
5G-GUTI may be assigned or re-assigned over any of the 3GPP and Non-3GPP
accesses. The 5G-GUTI is assigned upon a successful registration of the UE,
and is valid over both 3GPP and Non-3GPP access to the same PLMN for the UE.
Upon performing an initial access over the Non-3GPP access or over the 3GPP
access while the UE is already registered with the 5G System over another
access of the same PLMN, the UE provides the native 5G-GUTI for the other
access. This enables the AN to select an AMF that maintains the UE context
created at the previous Registration procedure via the GUAMI derived from the
5G-GUTI, and enables the AMF to correlate the UE request to the existing UE
context via the 5G-GUTI.
If the UE is performing registration over one access and intends to perform
registration over the other access in the same PLMN (e.g. the 3GPP access and
the selected N3IWF, TNGF or W-AGF are located in the same PLMN), the UE shall
not initiate the registration over the other access until the Registration
procedure over first access is completed.
NOTE: To which access the UE performs registration first is up to UE
implementation.
When the UE is successfully registered to an access (3GPP access or Non-3GPP
access respectively) and the UE registers via the other access:
\- if the second access is located in the same PLMN (e.g. the UE is registered
via a 3GPP access and selects a N3IWF, TNGF or W-AGF located in the same
PLMN), the UE shall use for the registration to the PLMN associated with the
new access the 5G-GUTI that the UE has been provided with at the previous
registration or UE configuration update procedure for the first access in the
same PLMN. Upon successful completion of the registration to the second
access, if the network included a 5G-GUTI in the Registration Accept, the UE
shall use the 5G-GUTI received in the Registration Accept for both
registrations. If no 5G-GUTI is included in the Registration Accept, then the
UE uses the 5G-GUTI assigned for the existing registration also for the new
registration.
\- if the second access is located in a PLMN different from the registered
PLMN of the first access (i.e. not the registered PLMN), (e.g. the UE is
registered to a 3GPP access and selects a N3IWF, TNGF or W-AGF located in a
PLMN different from the PLMN of the 3GPP access, or the UE is registered over
Non-3GPP and registers to a 3GPP access in a PLMN different from the PLMN of
the N3IWF, TNGF or W-AGF), the UE shall use for the registration to the PLMN
associated with the new access a 5G-GUTI only if it has got one previously
received from a PLMN that is not the same as the PLMN the UE is already
registered with. If the UE does not include a 5G-GUTI, the SUCI shall be used
for the new registration. Upon successful completion of the registration to
the second access, the UE has the two 5G-GUTIs (one per PLMN).
A UE supporting registration over both 3GPP and Non-3GPP access to two PLMNs
shall be able to handle two separate registrations, including two 5G-GUTIs,
one per PLMN, and two associated equivalent PLMN lists.
When a UE 5G-GUTI assigned during a Registration procedure over 3GPP (e.g. the
UE registers first over a 3GPP access) is location-dependent, the same UE
5G-GUTI can be re-used over the Non-3GPP access when the selected N3IWF, TNGF
or W-AGF function is in the same PLMN as the 3GPP access. When an UE 5G-GUTI
is assigned during a Registration procedure performed over a Non 3GPP access
(e.g. the UE registers first over a non-3GPP access), the UE 5G-GUTI may not
be location-dependent, so that the UE 5G-GUTI may not be valid for NAS
procedures over the 3GPP access and, in this case, a new AMF is allocated
during the Registration procedure over the 3GPP access.
When the UE is registered first via 3GPP access, if the UE registers to the
same PLMN via Non-3GPP access, the UE shall send the GUAMI obtained via 3GPP
access to the N3IWF, TNGF or W-AGF, which uses the received GUAMI to select
the same AMF as the 3GPP access.
The Deregistration Request message indicates whether it applies to the 3GPP
access the Non-3GPP access, or both.
If the UE is registered on both 3GPP and Non-3GPP accesses and it is in CM-
IDLE over Non-3GPP access, then the UE or AMF may initiate a Deregistration
procedure over the 3GPP access to deregister the UE only on the Non-3GPP
access, in which case all the PDU Sessions which are associated with the
Non-3GPP access shall be released.
If the UE is registered on both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses and it is in CM-
IDLE over 3GPP access and in CM-CONNECTED over non-3GPP access, then the UE
may initiate a Deregistration procedure over the non-3GPP access to deregister
the UE only on the 3GPP access, in which case all the PDU Sessions which are
associated with the 3GPP access shall be released.
Registration Management over Non-3GPP access is further defined in clause
5.5.1.
### 5.3.3 Connection Management
#### 5.3.3.1 General
Connection management comprises the functions of establishing and releasing a
NAS signalling connection between a UE and the AMF over N1. This NAS
signalling connection is used to enable NAS signalling exchange between the UE
and the core network. It comprises both the AN signalling connection between
the UE and the AN (RRC Connection over 3GPP access or UE-N3IWF connection over
untrusted N3GPP access or UE-TNGF connection over trusted N3GPP access) and
the N2 connection for this UE between the AN and the AMF.
#### 5.3.3.2 5GS Connection Management states
##### 5.3.3.2.1 General
Two CM states are used to reflect the NAS signalling Connection of the UE with
the AMF:
\- CM-IDLE
\- CM-CONNECTED
The CM state for 3GPP access and Non-3GPP access are independent of each
other, i.e. one can be in CM-IDLE state at the same time when the other is in
CM-CONNECTED state.
##### 5.3.3.2.2 CM-IDLE state
A UE in CM-IDLE state has no NAS signalling connection established with the
AMF over N1. The UE performs cell selection/cell reselection according to TS
38.304 [50] and PLMN selection according to TS 23.122 [17].
There are no AN signalling connection, N2 connection and N3 connections for
the UE in the CM-IDLE state.
If the UE is both in CM-IDLE state and in RM-REGISTERED state, the UE shall,
unless otherwise specified in clause 5.3.4.1:
\- Respond to paging by performing a Service Request procedure (see clause
4.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]), unless the UE is in MICO mode (see clause 5.4.1.3);
\- perform a Service Request procedure when the UE has uplink signalling or
user data to be sent (see clause 4.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]). Specific
conditions apply for LADN, see clause 5.6.5.
When the UE state in the AMF is RM-REGISTERED, UE information required for
initiating communication with the UE shall be stored. The AMF shall be able to
retrieve stored information required for initiating communication with the UE
using the 5G-GUTI.
NOTE: In 5GS there is no need for paging using the SUPI/SUCI of the UE.
The UE provides 5G-S-TMSI as part of AN parameters during AN signalling
connection establishment as specified in TS 38.331 [28] and TS 36.331 [51].
The UE shall enter CM-CONNECTED state whenever an AN signalling connection is
established between the UE and the AN (entering RRC Connected state over 3GPP
access, or at the establishment of the UE-N3IWF connectivity over untrusted
non-3GPP access or the UE-TNGF connectivity over trusted non-3GPP access). The
transmission of an Initial NAS message (Registration Request, Service Request
or Deregistration Request) initiates the transition from CM-IDLE to CM-
CONNECTED state.
When the UE states in the AMF are CM-IDLE and RM-REGISTERED, the AMF shall:
\- perform a network triggered Service Request procedure when it has
signalling or mobile-terminated data to be sent to this UE, by sending a
Paging Request to this UE (see clause 4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3]), if a UE is
not prevented from responding e.g. due to MICO mode or Mobility Restrictions.
The AMF shall enter CM-CONNECTED state for the UE whenever an N2 connection is
established for this UE between the AN and the AMF. The reception of initial
N2 message (e.g. N2 INITIAL UE MESSAGE) initiates the transition of AMF from
CM-IDLE to CM-CONNECTED state.
The UE and the AMF may optimize the power efficiency and signalling efficiency
of the UE when in CM-IDLE state e.g. by activating MICO mode (see clause
5.4.1.3).
##### 5.3.3.2.3 CM-CONNECTED state
A UE in CM-CONNECTED state has a NAS signalling connection with the AMF over
N1. A NAS signalling connection uses an RRC Connection between the UE and the
NG-RAN and an NGAP UE association between the AN and the AMF for 3GPP access.
A UE can be in CM-CONNECTED state with an NGAP UE association that is not
bound to any TNLA between the AN and the AMF. See clause 5.21.1.2 for details
on the state of NGAP UE association for an UE in CM-CONNECTED state. Upon
completion of a NAS signalling procedure, the AMF may decide to release the
NAS signalling connection with the UE.
In the CM-CONNECTED state, the UE shall:
\- enter CM-IDLE state whenever the AN signalling connection is released
(entering RRC Idle state over 3GPP access or when the release of the UE-N3IWF
connectivity over untrusted non-3GPP access or the UE-TNGF connectivity over
trusted non-3GPP access is detected by the UE), see TS 38.331 [28] for 3GPP
access.
When the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-CONNECTED, the AMF shall:
\- enter CM-IDLE state for the UE whenever the logical NGAP signalling
connection and the N3 user plane connection for this UE are released upon
completion of the AN Release procedure as specified in TS 23.502 [3].
The AMF may keep a UE CM state in the AMF in CM-CONNECTED state until the UE
de-registers from the core network.
A UE in CM-CONNECTED state can be in RRC Inactive state, see TS 38.300 [27].
When the UE is in RRC Inactive state the following applies:
\- UE reachability is managed by the RAN, with assistance information from
core network;
\- UE paging is managed by the RAN.
\- UE monitors for paging with UE\'s CN (5G S-TMSI) and RAN identifier.
##### 5.3.3.2.4 5GS Connection Management State models
Figure 5.3.3.2.4-1: CM state transition in UE
Figure 5.3.3.2.4-2: CM state transition in AMF
When a UE enters CM-IDLE state, the UP connection of the PDU Sessions that
were active on this access are deactivated.
NOTE: The activation of UP connection of PDU Sessions is documented in clause
5.6.8.
##### 5.3.3.2.5 CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state
RRC Inactive state applies to NG-RAN. UE support for RRC Inactive state is
defined in TS 38.306 [69] for NR and TS 36.306 [70] for E-UTRA connected to
5GC. RRC Inactive is not supported by NB-IoT connected to 5GC.
The AMF shall provide assistance information to the NG-RAN, to assist the NG-
RAN\'s decision whether the UE can be sent to RRC Inactive state except due to
some exceptional cases such as:
\- PLMN (or AMF set) does not support RRC Inactive;
\- The UE needs to be kept in CM-CONNECTED State (e.g. for tracking).
The \"RRC Inactive Assistance Information\" includes:
\- UE specific DRX values;
\- UE specific extended idle mode DRX values (cycle length and Paging Time
Window length);
\- The Registration Area provided to the UE;
\- Periodic Registration Update timer;
\- If the AMF has enabled MICO mode for the UE, an indication that the UE is
in MICO mode;
\- Information from the UE identifier, as defined in TS 38.304 [50] for NR and
TS 36.304 [52] for E-UTRA connected to 5GC, that allows the RAN to calculate
the UE\'s RAN paging occasions;
\- An indication that Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service is supported;
\- AMF PEIPS Assistance Information (see clause 5.4.12.2) for paging a UE in
CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state over NR as defined in TS 38.300 [27].
The RRC Inactive Assistance Information mentioned above is provided by the AMF
during N2 activation with the (new) serving NG-RAN node (i.e. during
Registration, Service Request, Handover) to assist the NG RAN\'s decision
whether the UE can be sent to RRC Inactive state. If the AMF allocates a new
Registration Area to the UE, the AMF should update the NG-RAN with the new
Registration Area by sending the RRC Inactive Assistance Information
accordingly. The Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service is used to assist
NG RAN to perform RAN based paging.
RRC Inactive state is part of RRC state machine, and it is up to the RAN to
determine the conditions to enter RRC Inactive state. If any of the parameters
included in the RRC Inactive Assistance Information changes as the result of
NAS procedure, the AMF shall update the RRC Inactive Assistance Information to
the NG-RAN node.
When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, if the AMF has provided RRC Inactive
assistance information, the RAN node may decide to move a UE to CM-CONNECTED
with RRC Inactive state.
The state and \"endpoints\" (in the case of Dual Connectivity configuration)
of the N2 and N3 reference points are not changed by the UE entering CM-
CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state. A UE in RRC inactive state is aware of the
RAN Notification area and periodic RAN Notification Area Update timer.
The 5GC network is not aware of the UE transitions between CM-CONNECTED with
RRC Connected and CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, unless the 5GC network
is notified via N2 notification procedure in clause 4.8.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
At transition into CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the NG-RAN configures
the UE with a periodic RAN Notification Area Update timer taking into account
the value of the Periodic Registration Update timer value indicated in the RRC
Inactive Assistance Information, and uses a guard timer with a value longer
than the RAN Notification Area Update timer value provided to the UE.
If the periodic RAN Notification Area Update guard timer expires in NG-RAN,
the NG-RAN shall initiate AN Release procedure as specified in clause 4.2.6 of
TS 23.502 [3].
When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the UE performs PLMN
selection procedures as defined in TS 23.122 [17] and TS 24.501 [47].
When the UE is CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the UE may resume the RRC
Connection due to:
\- Uplink data pending;
\- Mobile initiated NAS signalling procedure;
\- As a response to RAN paging;
\- Notifying the network that it has left the RAN Notification Area;
\- Upon periodic RAN Notification Area Update timer expiration.
If the UE resumes the connection in a different NG-RAN node within the same
PLMN or equivalent PLMN, the UE AS context is retrieved from the old NG-RAN
node and a procedure is triggered towards the CN (see clause 4.8.2 of TS
23.502 [3]).
NOTE 1: With Dual Connectivity configuration if the UE resumes the RRC
connection in the Master RAN node, the Secondary RAN node configuration is
defined in TS 38.300 [27].
If the RAN paging procedure, as defined in TS 38.300 [27], is not successful
in establishing contact with the UE the procedure shall be handled by the
network as follows:
\- If NG-RAN has at least one pending NAS PDU for transmission, the RAN node
shall initiate the AN Release procedure (see clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 [3]) to
move the UE CM state in the AMF to CM-IDLE state and indicate to the AMF the
NAS non-delivery.
\- If NG RAN has only pending user plane data for transmission, the NG-RAN
node may keep the N2 connection active or initiate the AN Release procedure
(see clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 [3]) based on local configuration in NG-RAN.
NOTE 2: The user plane data which triggers the RAN paging can be lost, e.g. in
the case of RAN paging failure.
If a UE in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state performs cell selection to
GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN, it shall follow idle mode procedures of the selected RAT
as specified in clause 5.17.
In addition, a UE in CM-CONNECTED state with RRC Inactive state shall enter
CM-IDLE state and initiates the NAS signalling recovery (see TS 24.501 [47])
in the following cases:
\- If RRC resume procedure fails,
If the UE receives Core Network paging,
\- If the periodic RAN Notification Area Update timer expires and the UE
cannot successfully resume the RRC Connection,
\- In any other failure scenario that cannot be resolved in RRC Inactive state
and requires the UE to move to CM-IDLE state.
When a UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, and a trigger to change
the UE\'s NG-RAN or E‑UTRAN UE Radio Capability information happens, the UE
shall move to CM-IDLE state and initiate the procedure for updating UE Radio
Capability defined in clause 5.4.4.1. (For specific requirements for a UE
operating in dual-registration mode see clause 5.17.2.1)
When UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, if RAN has received
Location Reporting Control message from AMF with the Reporting Type indicating
single stand-alone report or continuously reporting whenever the UE changes
the cell, the RAN shall perform .location reporting as specified in clause
4.10 of TS 23.502 [3].
When the UE is CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state. If the AMF receives
Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification from UDM, the AMF shall initiate AN
Release procedure as specified in clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 [3].
When UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, if RAN has received
Location Reporting Control message from AMF with the Reporting Type of the
Area Of Interest based reporting, the RAN shall send a Location Report message
to AMF including UE presence in the Area Of Interest (i.e. IN, OUT, or
UNKNOWN) and the UE\'s last known location with time stamp.
When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, if the old NG-RAN node
that sents the UE into RRC Inactive state receives the downlink N2 signalling,
it initiates the RAN paging as defined in TS 38.300 [27]. If the UE resumes
the RRC Connection towards a different NG-RAN node, the old NG-RAN node
includes the \"UE Context Transfer\" indication into a response container to
the NF (e.g. AMF or SMF) that generates such N2 downlink signalling. Then the
NF shall reattempt the same procedure when the path switch from the old NG-RAN
node to the new NG-RAN node is complete.
#### 5.3.3.3 NAS signalling connection management
##### 5.3.3.3.1 General
NAS signalling connection management includes the functions of establishing
and releasing a NAS signalling connection.
##### 5.3.3.3.2 NAS signalling connection establishment
NAS signalling connection establishment function is provided by the UE and the
AMF to establish a NAS signalling connection for a UE in CM-IDLE state. The
AMF shall provide the list of recommended cells/ TAs / NG-RAN node identifiers
for paging, if the NG-RAN had provided that information in an earlier AN
Release Procedure in the AN (see clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 [3]).
When the UE in CM-IDLE state needs to transmit an NAS message, the UE shall
initiate a Service Request, a Registration or a Deregistration procedure to
establish a NAS signalling connection to the AMF as specified in clauses 4.2.2
and 4.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. If the NAS signalling connection is to be
established via an NG-RAN node, but the AMF detects that this UE has already
established a NAS signalling connection via old NG-RAN node, the AMF shall
release the old established NAS signalling connection by triggering AN Release
Procedure.
Based on UE preferences, UE subscription, Mobility Pattern and network
configuration, the AMF may keep the NAS signalling connection until the UE de-
registers from the network.
##### 5.3.3.3.3 NAS signalling connection Release
The procedure of releasing a NAS signalling connection is initiated by the AN
node (either 5G (R)AN node or N3IWF) or the AMF. The NG-RAN node may include
the list of recommended cells/ TAs / NG-RAN node identifiers for paging,
during the AN Release Procedure in the AN (see clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 [3]).
The AMF stores this information, if provided by the NG-RAN.
The UE considers the NAS signalling connection is released if it detects the
AN signalling connection is released. The AMF considers the NAS signalling
connection is released if it detects the N2 context is released.
#### 5.3.3.4 Support of a UE connected over both 3GPP and Non-3GPP access
The AMF manages two CM states for an UE: a CM state for 3GPP access and a CM
state for Non-3GPP access. An N2 interface can serve the UE for either 3GPP
access or for Non 3GPP access. UE connected over both 3GPP and Non-3GPP has
got two N2 interfaces, one for each access. A UE may be in any combination of
the CM states between 3GPP and Non-3GPP access, e.g. a UE may be CM-IDLE for
one access and CM-CONNECTED for the other access, CM-IDLE for both accesses or
CM-CONNECTED for both accesses.
When the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE for 3GPP access and CM-CONNECTED
for Non-3GPP access, the AMF shall perform a network triggered Service Request
procedure, when it has downlink data to be sent to this UE for 3GPP access, by
sending either the Paging Request via 3GPP access or the NAS notification via
Non-3GPP access to this UE (see clause 4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3]).
Connection Management over Non-3GPP access is further defined in clause 5.5.2.
### 5.3.4 UE Mobility
#### 5.3.4.1 Mobility Restrictions
##### 5.3.4.1.1 General
Mobility Restrictions restrict mobility handling or service access of a UE.
The Mobility Restriction functionality is provided by the UE (only for
mobility restriction categories provided to the UE), the radio access network
and the core network.
Unless otherwise stated, Mobility Restrictions only apply to 3GPP access and
wireline access, they do not apply to other non-3GPP accesses.
The UE and the network shall override Mobility restriction as specified in
clause 5.16.4.3 when accessing the network for Emergency Services. For MPS and
MCX, service area restriction does not apply, as specified in TS 24.501 [47].
For UE requesting Disaster Roaming service, the UE is only allowed to receive
services in the area with Disaster Condition as specified in clause 5.40.4.
The other areas within the PLMN shall be considered as forbidden area for the
UE registered for Disaster Roaming service.
Service Area restrictions and handling of Forbidden Areas for CM-IDLE state
and, for CM-CONNECTED state when in RRC Inactive state are executed by the UE
based on information received from the core network. Mobility Restrictions for
CM-CONNECTED state when in RRC-Connected state are executed by the radio
access network and the core network.
In CM-CONNECTED state, the core network provides Mobility Restrictions to the
radio access network within Mobility Restriction List.
Mobility Restrictions consists of RAT restriction, Forbidden Area, Service
Area Restrictions, Core Network type restriction and Closed Access Group
information as follows:
\- RAT restriction:
Defines the 3GPP Radio Access Technology(ies), a UE is not allowed to access
in a PLMN. In a restricted RAT a UE based on subscription is not permitted
access to the network for this PLMN. For CM-CONNECTED state, when radio access
network determines target RAT and target PLMN during Handover procedure, it
should take per PLMN RAT restriction into consideration. The RAT restriction
is enforced in the network, and not provided to the UE.
\- Forbidden Area:
In a Forbidden Area, the UE, based on subscription, is not permitted to
initiate any communication with the network for this PLMN. The UE behaviour in
terms of cell selection, RAT selection and PLMN selection depends on the
network response that informs the UE of Forbidden Area. A Forbidden Area
applies either to 3GPP access or to non-3GPP access.
Further description on Forbidden Area when using wireline access is available
in TS 23.316 [84].
Support for Forbidden Area with NR satellite access is described in clause
5.4.11.8.
Forbidden Areas should not be used for Untrusted or Trusted non-3GPP access.
NOTE 1: If a UE receives that the UE is accessing from a forbidden tracking
area when registering over untrusted non-3GPP access or trusted non-3GPP
access, the UE cannot determine the corresponding TAI and thus needs to
consider that access to untrusted non-3GPP access and to trusted non-3GPP
access in this PLMN is forbidden until the forbidden area list is removed as
described in TS 24.501 [47].
NOTE 2: The UE reactions to specific network responses are described in TS
24.501 [47].
\- Service Area Restriction:
Defines areas in which the UE may or may not initiate communication with the
network as follows:
\- Allowed Area:
In an Allowed Area, the UE is permitted to initiate communication with the
network as allowed by the subscription.
\- Non-Allowed Area:
In a Non-Allowed Area a UE is service area restricted based on subscription.
The UE and the network are not allowed to initiate Service Request, or any
connection requests for user plane data, control plane data, exception data
reporting, or SM signalling (except for PS Data Off status change reporting)
to obtain user services that are not related to mobility.
The UE shall not use the entering of a Non-Allowed Area as a criterion for
Cell Reselection, a trigger for PLMN Selection or Domain selection for UE
originating sessions or calls. The RRC procedures while the UE is in CM-
CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state are unchanged compared to when the UE is in
an Allowed Area. The RM procedures are unchanged compared to when the UE is in
an Allowed Area. The UE in a Non-Allowed Area shall respond to core network
paging or NAS Notification message from non-3GPP access with Service Request
and RAN paging. The UE in a Non-Allowed Area may initiate MA PDU Session
establishment or activation over a non-3GPP access other than wireline access,
but the User Plane resources on the 3GPP access for the MA-PDU shall not be
established or activated. The handling of Non-Allowed Area when using wireline
access is described in TS 23.316 [84].
NOTE 3: When the services are restricted in 5GS due to Service Area
Restriction, then it is assumed that the services will be also restricted in
all RATs/Systems at the same location(s) using appropriate mechanisms
available in the other RATs/Systems.
NOTE 4: Delivery of SOR transparent container, UE policy container, UE
parameters update transparent container as defined in TS 24.501 [47], or
removal of any stored Paging Restriction Information from network via
Registration Request (see clause 5.38), is part of the mobility related
service and is allowed in an area with service restriction.
NOTE 5: For a UE in CM-CONNECTED state then neither control plane data
transmission nor, if user plane resources are already established, user plane
data transmission are restricted by a non-allowed area.
\- Core Network type restriction:
Defines whether UE is allowed to connect to 5GC only, EPC only, both 5GC and
EPC for this PLMN. The Core Network type restriction when received applies in
the PLMN either to both 3GPP and non-3GPP Access Types or to non-3GPP Access
Type only.
NOTE 6: The Core Network type restriction can be used e.g. in network
deployments where the E-UTRAN connects to both EPC and 5GC as described in
clause 5.17. When the Core Network type restriction applies to non-3GPP Access
Type, the UE is restricted from using any connectivity to an N3IWF.
\- Closed Access Group information:
As defined in clause 5.30.3.
For a given UE, the core network determines the Mobility Restrictions based on
UE subscription information, UE location and/or local policy (e.g. if the
HPLMN has not deployed 5GC, HPLMN ID of the UE and the operator\'s policy are
used in the VPLMN for determining the Core Network type restriction). The
Mobility Restriction may change due to e.g. UE\'s subscription, location
change and local policy. Optionally the Service Area Restrictions or the Non-
Allowed Area may in addition be fine-tuned by the PCF e.g. based on UE
location, PEI and network policies. Service Area Restrictions may be updated
during a Registration procedure or UE Configuration Update procedure.
NOTE 7: The subscription management ensures that for MPS service subscriber
the Mobility Restrictions is not included.
If the network sends Service Area Restrictions to the UE, the network sends
only either an Allowed Area, or a Non-Allowed Area, but not both at the same
time, to the UE. If the UE has received an Allowed Area from the network, any
TA not part of the Allowed Area is considered by the UE as non-allowed. If the
UE has received a Non-Allowed Area from the network, any TA not part of the
Non-Allowed Area is considered by the UE as allowed. If the UE has not
received any Service Area Restrictions, any TA in the PLMN is considered as
allowed.
If the UE has overlapping areas between Forbidden Areas, Service Area
Restrictions, or any combination of them, the UE shall proceed in the
following precedence order:
\- The evaluation of Forbidden Areas shall take precedence over the evaluation
of Service Area Restrictions.
The UDM shall provide to the AMF the information defined in TS 23.008 [119]
about the subscriber\'s NR or E-UTRA access restriction set by the operator
determined e.g. by subscription scenario and roaming scenario:
\- For NR:
\- NR not allowed as primary access.
\- NR not allowed as secondary access.
\- NR in unlicensed bands not allowed as primary access.
\- NR in unlicensed bands not allowed as secondary access.
\- NR(LEO) satellite access not allowed as primary access.
\- NR(MEO) satellite access not allowed as primary access.
\- NR(GEO) satellite access not allowed as primary access.
\- NR(OTHERSAT) satellite access not allowed as primary access.
\- NR RedCap not allowed as primary access.
Editor\'s note: The final decision on whether Dual Connectivity and Carrier
Aggregation are supported is in RAN WG2 and RAN WG3. Subsequently SA WG2 will
consider whether any system features are needed to support such DC or CA RAN
functionality such as mobility restrictions for secondary access.
\- For E-UTRA:
\- E-UTRA not allowed as primary access.
\- E-UTRA not allowed as secondary access.
\- E-UTRA in unlicensed bands not allowed as secondary access.
\- NB-IoT not allowed as primary access.
\- LTE-M not allowed as primary access.
In order to enforce all primary access restrictions, the related access has to
be deployed in different Tracking Area Codes and the subscriber shall not be
allowed to access the network in TAs using the particular access.
With all secondary access restrictions, the subscriber shall not be allowed to
use this access as secondary access.
##### 5.3.4.1.2 Management of Service Area Restrictions
This clause describes Service Area Restrictions for 3GPP access. For Service
Area Restrictions when using wireline access, see TS 23.316 [84].
A Service Area Restriction may contain one or more (e.g. up to 16) entire
Tracking Areas each or the Service Area Restriction may be set as unlimited
(i.e. contain all Tracking Areas of the PLMN). The UE\'s subscription data in
the UDM includes a Service Area Restriction which may contain either Allowed
or Non-Allowed Areas--specified by using explicit Tracking Area identities
and/or other geographical information (e.g. longitude/latitude, zip code,
etc). The geographical information used to specify Allowed or Non-Allowed Area
is only managed in the network, and the network will map it to a list of TAs
before sending Service Area Restriction information to the PCF, NG-RAN and UE.
When the AMF assigns a limited allowed area to the UE, the AMF shall provide
the UE with Service Area Restrictions which consist of either Allowed Areas or
Non-Allowed Areas. The Allowed Areas included in the Service Area Restrictions
can be pre-configured and/or dynamically assigned by the AMF.
The Allowed Area may alternatively be configured as unlimited i.e. it may
contain all Tracking Areas of the PLMN. The Registration Area of a UE in the
Non-Allowed Area should consist of a set of TAs which belongs to a Non-Allowed
Area of the UE. The Registration Area of a UE in the Allowed Area should
consist of a set of TAs which belongs to an Allowed Area of the UE. The AMF
provides the Service Area Restriction in the form of TA(s), which may be a
subset of full list stored in UE\'s subscription data or provided by the PCF,
to the UE during the Registration procedure.
NOTE: As the finest granularity for Service Area Restrictions are at TA level,
subscriptions with limited geographical extent, like subscriptions for Fixed
Wireless Access, will be allocated one or a few TAs and will consequently be
allowed to access services in a larger area than in e.g. a FWA system.
The limited allowed area may also be limited by the AMF by a maximum allowed
number of Tracking Areas, even though this limitation is not sent to the UE.
If maximum allowed number of Tracking Areas is used in combination with
Allowed Area, the maximum allowed number of Tracking Areas indicates (to the
AMF) the maximum number of TAs allowed in limited allowed area inside the
Allowed Area. If maximum allowed number of Tracking Areas is used in
combination with Non-Allowed Area, the maximum allowed number of Tracking
Areas indicates (to the AMF) the maximum number of TAs allowed in limited
allowed area outside of the Non-Allowed Area.
The UDM stores the Service Area Restrictions of a UE as part of the UE\'s
subscription data. The PCF in the serving network may (e.g. due to varying
conditions such as UE\'s location, application in use, time and date) further
adjust Service Area Restrictions of a UE, either by expanding an Allowed Area
or by reducing a Non-Allowed Area or by increasing the maximum allowed number
of Tracking Areas. If NWDAF is deployed, the PCF may use analytics (i.e.
statistics or predictions) on UE mobility from NWDAF (see TS 23.288 [86]) to
adjust Service Area Restrictions. The UDM and the PCF may update the Service
Area Restrictions of a UE at any time. For the UE in CM-CONNECTED state the
AMF updates the UE and RAN immediately. For UE in CM-IDLE state the AMF may
page the UE immediately or store the updated service area restriction and
update the UE upon next signalling interaction with the UE, as defined in TS
24.501 [47].
During registration, if the Service Area Restrictions of the UE is not present
in the AMF, the AMF fetches from the UDM the Service Area Restrictions of the
UE that may be further adjusted by the PCF. The serving AMF shall enforce the
Service Area Restrictions of a UE. A limited allowed area given by a maximum
allowed number of Tracking Areas, may be dynamically assigned by the AMF
adding any not yet visited (by the UE) Tracking Areas to the limited allowed
area until the maximum allowed number of Tracking Areas is reached (i.e. the
AMF adds new TAs to the limited allowed area until the number of TAs is equal
to the maximum allowed number of Tracking Areas). The AMF deletes the list of
TAs that have been used up under the maximum allowed number of Tracking Areas
quota at every Initial Registration.
For a UE in CM-CONNECTED state the AMF shall indicate the Service Area
Restrictions of this UE to the RAN, using a Mobility Restriction List.
The UE shall store the received Service Area Restrictions and, if there is
previously stored Service Area Restrictions, replace them with the newly
received information. If the Service Area Restrictions include a limited
allowed area, the Service Area Restrictions are applicable for the Tracking
areas indicated in Service Area Restrictions. If the Service Area Restrictions
included an unlimited allowed area, the received Service Area Restrictions are
applicable for the registered PLMN and its equivalent PLMN(s) that are
available in the Registration Area. The RAN uses the Service Area Restrictions
for target cell selection in Xn and N2 based handover.
Upon change of serving AMF due to mobility, the old AMF may provide the new
AMF with the Service Area Restrictions of the UE that may be further adjusted
by the PCF.
The network may perform paging for a UE to update Service Area Restrictions
with Generic UE Configuration Update procedure (see clause 4.2.4 of TS 23.502
[3]).
In the case of roaming, the Service Area Restrictions are transferred from the
UDM via the serving AMF to the serving PCF in the visited network. The serving
PCF in the visited network may further adjust the Service Area Restrictions.
Support for Service Area Restrictions with NR satellite access is described in
clause 5.4.11.8.
#### 5.3.4.2 Mobility Pattern
The Mobility Pattern is a concept that may be used by the AMF to characterise
and optimise the UE mobility. The AMF determines and updates Mobility Pattern
of the UE based on subscription of the UE, statistics of the UE mobility,
network local policy, and the UE assisted information, or any combination of
them. The statistics of the UE mobility can be historical or expected UE
moving trajectory. If NWDAF is deployed, the statistics of the UE mobility can
also be analytics (i.e. statistics or predictions) provided by the NWDAF (see
TS 23.288 [86]).
The Mobility Pattern can be used by the AMF to optimize mobility support
provided to the UE, for example, Registration area allocation.
#### 5.3.4.3 Radio Resource Management functions
##### 5.3.4.3.1 General
To support radio resource management in NG-RAN the AMF provides the parameter
\'Index to RAT/Frequency Selection Priority\' (RFSP Index) to NG-RAN across
N2. The RFSP Index is mapped by the RAN to locally defined configuration in
order to apply specific RRM strategies, taking into account any available
information in RAN. The RFSP Index is UE specific and applies to all the Radio
Bearers. Examples of how this parameter may be used by the RAN:
\- to derive UE specific cell reselection priorities to control idle mode
camping.
\- to decide on redirecting active mode UEs to different frequency layers or
RATs (e.g. see clause 5.3.4.3.2).
The HPLMN may set the RFSP Index taking into account the Subscribed S-NSSAIs.
The AMF receives the subscribed RFSP Index from the UDM (e.g. during the
Registration procedure). For non-roaming subscribers, the AMF chooses the RFSP
Index in use according to one of the following procedures, depending on
operator\'s configuration:
\- the RFSP Index in use is identical to the subscribed RFSP Index, or
\- the AMF chooses the RFSP Index in use based on the subscribed RFSP Index,
the locally configured operator\'s policies, the Allowed NSSAI and the UE
related context information available at the AMF, including UE\'s usage
setting, if received during Registration procedures (see clause TS 23.502
[3]).
NOTE 1: One example of how the AMF can use the \"UE\'s usage setting,\" is to
select an RFSP value that enforces idle mode camping on E-UTRA for a UE acting
in a \"Voice centric\" way, in the case voice over NR is not supported in the
specific Registration Area and it contains NR cells.
The AMF may report to the PCF the subscribed RFSP Index received from the UDM
for further evaluation as described in clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 23.503 [45]. When
receiving the authorized RFSP Index from the PCF, the AMF shall apply the
authorized RFSP Index instead of the subscribed RFSP Index for choosing the
RFSP index in use (as described above). For roaming subscribers, the AMF may
choose the RFSP Index in use based on the visited network policy, but can take
input from the HPLMN into account (e.g. an RFSP Index value pre-configured per
HPLMN, or a single RFSP Index value to be used for all roamers independent of
the HPLMN).
The RFSP Index in use is also forwarded from source to target NG-RAN node when
Xn or N2 is used for intra-NG-RAN handover.
The AMF stores the subscribed RFSP Index value received and the RFSP Index
value in use. During the Registration procedure, the AMF may update the RFSP
Index value in use (e.g. the AMF may need to update the RFSP Index value in
use if the UE related context information in the AMF has changed). When the
RFSP Index value in use is changed, the AMF immediately provides the updated
RFSP Index value in use to NG-RAN node by modifying an existing UE context or
by establishing a new UE context in RAN or by being configured to include the
updated RFSP Index value in use in the NGAP DOWNLINK NAS TRANSPORT message if
the user plane establishment is not needed. During inter-AMF mobility
procedures, the source AMF forwards both RFSP Index values to the target AMF.
The target AMF may replace the received RFSP Index value in use with a new
RFSP Index value in use that is based on the operator\'s policies and the UE
related context information available at the target AMF.
In order to enable UE idle mode mobility control and priority-based
reselection mechanism considering availability of Network Slices at the
network and the Network Slices allowed for a UE, an RFSP is derived as
described in clause 5.3.4.3, considering also the Allowed NSSAI for the UE.
A UE supporting NSAG (see clause 5.15.14) may be configured, for some of the
S-NSSAIs in the configured NSSAI, with NSAGs it can use as described in TS
38.300 [27], TS 38.304 [50], TS 38.331 [28], TS 38.321 [143], TS 24.501 [47]
and as described in clause 5.3.4.3.4.
##### 5.3.4.3.2 Preferred band(s) per data radio bearer(s)
The NG-RAN may prefer to use specific radio resources per data radio
bearer(s), e.g. depending on the Network Slices associated to the data radio
bearer used by the UE. The UE idle mode mobility control and priority-based
reselection mechanism operates as described in clause 5.3.4.3.1, and when UP
resources are activated e.g. for a specific S-NSSAI the NG-RAN can use local
policies to decide on what specific radio resources to use for the associated
data radio bearer(s). A UE may be served by a set of data radio bearers which
may be served by cells in different bands, selected based on RRM policies.
##### 5.3.4.3.3 Redirection to dedicated frequency band(s) for an S-NSSAI
If a Network Slice, S-NSSAI, is configured to be available only in TAs
covering specific dedicated frequency band(s), then there may be a need to
redirect the UE to the dedicated frequency band(s) when such S-NSSAI is
requested. If the Requested NSSAI contains S-NSSAI(s) that are not available
in the UE\'s current TA, see clause 5.15.8, the AMF itself or by interacting
with the NSSF as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1 may determine a Target NSSAI
to be used by the NG-RAN, in addition to the information the AMF receives,
such as the Allowed NSSAI and the RFSP for the Allowed NSSAI, to attempt to
redirect the UE to a cell and TA in another frequency band and TA that
supports the S-NSSAIs in the Target NSSAI. The Target NSSAI includes at least
one S-NSSAI from the Requested NSSAI not available in the current TA, but
available in another TA in different frequency band possibly overlapping with
the current TA, and optionally additional S-NSSAIs from the Requested NSSAI
that are configured to be available within the same TAs as the S-NSSAIs not
available in the current TA. If the serving PLMN supports the subscription-
based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network slices (see clause
5.15.12), and if the UE has NSSRG as part of the subscription information
received from the HPLMN, the Target NSSAI includes only S-NSSAIs sharing at
least one NSSRG.
The Target NSSAI may be excluding some of the Allowed NSSAIs and include some
of the rejected S-NSSAIs due to lack of support in the TA where the UE is
located based on network policies that are in line with customer and operator
agreements. The Target NSSAI shall only include S-NSSAIs that can be provided
in an Allowed NSSAI for the UE. The Target NSSAI may include e.g.:
\- all or a subset of the Rejected S-NSSAIs for RA when none of the S-NSSAIs
in the Requested S-NSSAI were available in the TA where the UE is;
\- all the S-NSSAIs of the Allowed NSSAI and all or a subset of the Rejected
S-NSSAIs for the RA;
\- a subset of the S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI and all or a subset of the
Rejected S-NSSAIs for the RA if the operator policy is to prefer this Target
S-NSSAI to the Allowed NSSAI.
The AMF should retrieve an RFSP Index suitable for the Target NSSAI and
includes the RFSP Index in the information sent to the NG-RAN. The AMF
retrieves the RFSP Index from the PCF or, in case PCF is not deployed the AMF
determines the RFSP Index according to local configuration. The RFSP index
associated to the Target NSSAI is considered if the RAN succeeds to redirect
the UE to a new TA outside the RA, otherwise the RFSP index of the Allowed
NSSAI is considered.
If the Requested NSSAI contains S-NSSAI(s) which map to S-NSSAI(s) of the
HPLMN subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization that
are not available in the UE\'s current TA, the AMF shall proceed with the
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure as described
in clause 4.2.9 of TS 23.502 [3]. If the AMF determines a new Allowed NSSAI at
the end of Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization steps and
some S-NSSAI is not available in the UE\'s current TA, a Target NSSAI and
corresponding RFSP index may be determined and provided to NG-RAN during UE
Configuration Update procedure as described in clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502
[3].
The NG-RAN shall attempt to find cells of TAs that can support all the
S-NSSAIs in the Target S-NSSAIs, and if no such cell of a TA is available the
RAN can attempt to select cells of TAs that best match the Target S-NSSAI. The
NG-RAN shall attempt to ensure continuity of the PDU Sessions with activated
User Plane associated with the S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI which are in the
Target NSSAI. Also, the NG-RAN should attempt to ensure continuity of service
for the S-NSSAIs of the Allowed NSSAI also available in the Target NSSAI,
before prioritizing cells that are not supporting one or more of the S-NSSAI
of the Allowed NSSAI also available in the Target NSSAI.
The NG-RAN attempts to determine target cell(s) supporting the Target NSSAI
considering the UE Radio Capabilities (i.e. the AMF (if available in the UE
context) shall provide the NG-RAN with the current UE Radio Capability
Information or the RACS UE Radio Capability ID when a Target NSSAI is
provided, if the NG-RAN had not yet received any of them, or, if the AMF
cannot provide any of these, the UE Radio Capability Information may be
retrieved by the NG-RAN from the UE).
Once the target cells are determined, the NG-RAN initiates RRC redirection
procedure towards the target cells, or the NG-RAN initiates handover for the
UE with active PDU Sessions associated with the S-NSSAIs which are in the
Target NSSAI, if possible.
After a successful redirection or handover of the UE to a new TA outside the
current RA, the UE shall perform a Mobility Registration Update procedure and
the S-NSSAIs the new TA supports can be allowed if the UE requests them. In
order to ensure that the UE is redirected to a TA outside the current RA, thus
triggering a Mobility Registration Update procedure enabling the UE to request
the S-NSSAI(s) that were rejected for the RA, the AMF shall set the RA so that
the RA does not include TAs supporting the S-NSSAIs rejected for the RA
included in the Target NSSAI when the AMF provides a Target NSSAI to the RAN.
##### 5.3.4.3.4 Network Slice based cell reselection and Random Access
When one or more S-NSSAI(s) are associated with NSAG(s), the UE may perform
Network Slice based cell reselection and Random Access as described in TS
38.300 [27], TS 38.304 [50], TS 38.331 [28], TS 38.321 [143] and TS 24.501
[47].
When providing NSAG Information to the UE, the AMF shall also provide the NSAG
priority information for the NSAGs provided in the NSAG Information. The AMF
determines the NSAG priority information based on configured local policy of
the serving PLMN or SNPN.
NOTE 1: How the AMF assigns the NSAG priority information per UE is not
specified but AMF can take into account information like e.g. UE MM
capabilities, Subscribed S-NSSAIs and HPLMN.
NOTE 2: The AMF can assign same priority value for NSAGs provided in the NSAG
Information.
If the UE has received NSAG Information from the AMF, the UE shall use the
NSAG Information provided by the AMF for cell reselection and Random Access as
described below. If the UE has not received any NSAG Information from the AMF,
the UE shall not use Network Slice based cell reselection and Random Access at
all.
The UE NAS provides to the UE AS the NSAG Information as received from the AMF
and the S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI as input to cell reselection, except
when the UE intends to register with a new set of S-NSSAIs with a Requested
NSSAI different from the current Allowed NSSAI, in which case the UE NAS
provides to the UE AS layer the NSAG Information as received from the AMF and
the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI, and this may trigger a cell reselection,
before sending the Registration Request including the new Requested NSSAI.
For Network Slice based Random Access, different Random Access resources may
be assigned to different NSAG(s). The UE determines Random Access
configuration among NSAGs that are published in SIB for Random Access and that
are associated to the S-NSSAIs triggering the access. If the signalling
transaction triggering the access attempt is related to more than one network
slice, and the S-NSSAIs of these network slices are associated with more than
one NSAG for Random Access, the NSAG with the highest priority is selected.
NOTE 3: How the UE NAS provides the NSAGs priorities to UE AS is based
internal UE interface, and not specified.
#### 5.3.4.4 UE mobility event notification
5G System supports the functionality of tracking and reporting UE mobility
events.
The AMF provides the UE mobility related event reporting to NF that has been
authorized to subscribe to the UE mobility event reporting service. Any NF
service consumer such as SMF, NEF or NWDAF that wants to be reported on the UE
location is able to subscribe to the UE mobility event notification service to
the AMF with the following parameters:
\- Event reporting type that specifies what to be reported on UE mobility
(e.g. UE location, UE mobility on Area of Interest).
\- Event filters indicating the:
\- Area Of Interest that specifies a location area within 3GPP system. The
Area Of Interest is represented by a list of Tracking Areas, list of cells or
list of (R)AN node identifiers. In the case of LADN, the event consumer (e.g.
SMF) provides the LADN DNN to refer the LADN service area as the Area Of
Interest. In the case of PRA, the event consumer (e.g. SMF or PCF) may provide
an identifier for Area Of Interest to refer predefined area as the Area Of
Interest.
\- S-NSSAI and optionally the NSI ID(s).
\- Event Reporting Information: event reporting mode, number of reports,
maximum duration of reporting, event reporting condition (e.g. when the target
UE moved into a specified Area Of Interest, immediate reporting flag).
\- Notification Endpoint of NF service consumer to be notified.
\- The target of event reporting that indicates a specific UE, a group of
UE(s) or any UE (i.e. all UEs). Further details on the information provided by
the NF service consumer are provided in clause 4.15 of TS 23.502 [3].
If an NF service consumer subscribes to the UE mobility event notification
service provided by AMF for reporting of UE presence in Area Of Interest, the
AMF tracks UE\'s location considering UE\'s CM state and using NG-RAN
procedures (if RRC Inactive state applies to NG-RAN) in order to determine the
UE presence in the Area Of Interest, as described in clause 4.15.4.2 of TS
23.502 [3]. Upon detecting the change of the UE presence in the Area Of
Interest, the AMF notifies the UE presence in the Area Of Interest and the new
UE location to the subscribed NF consumer.
When the AMF is changed, the subscription of mobility event is transferred
from the old AMF. The new AMF may decide not to notify the SMF with the
current status related to the subscription of mobility event if the new AMF
determines that, based on MM Context of the UE, the event is reported by the
old AMF.
In the network deployment where a UE may leave or enter the Area Of Interest
without any notification to the 5GC in CM-CONNECTED state (i.e. in the case
that RRC Inactive state applies to the NG-RAN), the AMF may initiate the NG-
RAN location reporting as described in clause 5.4.7 or N2 Notification as
described in clause 4.8.3 of TS 23.502 [3] to track the UE presence in the
Area Of Interest.
The AMF may provide UE mobility event reporting to PCF, using Policy Control
Report Triggers defined in TS 23.503 [45].
### 5.3.5 Triggers for network analytics
Triggers for the AMF to request for or subscribe to the analytics information
from the NWDAF are internal logic in the AMF and may include for example:
\- UE access and mobility related event subscription by other NFs (e.g. SMF,
NEF);
\- locally detected events;
\- analytics information received.
The trigger conditions may depend on operator and implementation policy in the
AMF. When a trigger condition happens, the AMF may decide if any analytics
information is needed and if so, request for or subscription to the analytics
information from the NWDAF.
The AMF may, upon detection of certain local events, e.g. frequent mobility
re-registration of one or more UEs, subscribe to mobility related abnormal
behaviour analytics of the UE(s) as described in TS 23.288 [86] in order to
trace UE mobility trend and take appropriate actions.
## 5.4 3GPP access specific aspects
### 5.4.1 UE reachability in CM-IDLE
#### 5.4.1.1 General
Reachability management is responsible for detecting whether the UE is
reachable and providing UE location (i.e. access node) for the network to
reach the UE. This is done by paging UE and UE location tracking. The UE
location tracking includes both UE registration area tracking (i.e. UE
registration area update) and UE reachability tracking ((i.e. UE periodic
registration area update)). Such functionalities can be either located at 5GC
(in the case of CM-IDLE state) or NG-RAN (in the case of CM-CONNECTED state).
The UE and the AMF negotiate UE reachability characteristics for CM-IDLE state
during Registration procedures.
Two UE reachability categories are negotiated between UE and AMF for CM-IDLE
state:
1\. UE reachability allowing Mobile Terminated data while the UE is CM-IDLE
state.
\- The UE location is known by the network on a Tracking Area List granularity
\- Paging procedures apply to this category.
\- Mobile originating and mobile terminated data apply in this category for
both CM-CONNECTED and CM-IDLE state.
2\. Mobile Initiated Connection Only (MICO) mode:
\- Mobile originated data applies in this category for both CM-CONNECTED and
CM-IDLE state.
\- Mobile terminated data is only supported when the UE is in CM-CONNECTED
state.
Whenever a UE in RM-REGISTERED state enters CM-IDLE state, it starts a
periodic registration timer according to the periodic registration timer value
received from the AMF during a Registration procedure.
The AMF allocates a periodic registration timer value to the UE based on local
policies, subscription information and information provided by the UE. After
the expiry of the periodic registration timer, the UE shall perform a periodic
registration. If the UE moves out of network coverage when its periodic
registration timer expires, the UE shall perform a Registration procedure when
it next returns to the coverage.
The AMF runs a Mobile Reachable timer for the UE. The timer is started with a
value longer than the UE\'s periodic registration timer whenever the CM state
for the UE in RM-REGISTERED state changes to CM-IDLE. If the AMF receives an
elapsed time from RAN when RAN initiate UE context release indicating UE
unreachable, the AMF should deduce a Mobile Reachable timer value based on the
elapsed time received from RAN and the normal Mobile Reachable timer value.
The AMF stops the Mobile Reachable timer, if the UE CM state in the AMF moves
to CM-CONNECTED state. If the Mobile Reachable timer expires, the AMF
determines that the UE is not reachable.
However, the AMF does not know for how long the UE remains not reachable, thus
the AMF shall not immediately de-register the UE. Instead, after the expiry of
the Mobile Reachable timer, the AMF should clear the PPF and shall start an
Implicit De-registration timer, with a relatively large value. The AMF shall
stop the Implicit De-registration timer and set the PPF if the AMF moves the
UE CM state in the AMF to CM-CONNECTED state.
NOTE: If the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE, then AMF considers the UE
always unreachable if the UE is in MICO mode (refer to clause 5.4.1.3).
If the PPF is not set, the AMF does not page the UE and shall reject any
request for delivering DL signalling or data to this UE.
If the Implicit De-registration timer expires before the UE contacts the
network, the AMF implicitly de-register the UE.
As part of deregistration for a particular access (3GPP or non-3GPP), the AMF
shall request the UE\'s related SMF to release the PDU Sessions established on
that access.
#### 5.4.1.2 UE reachability allowing mobile terminated data while the UE is
CM-IDLE
The AMF considers a UE in RM-REGISTERED state to be reachable by CN paging if
the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE state unless the UE applies MICO mode.
#### 5.4.1.3 Mobile Initiated Connection Only (MICO) mode
A UE may indicate preference for MICO mode during Initial Registration or
Mobility Registration Update procedure. The AMF, based on local configuration,
**Expected UE Behaviour and/or Network Configuration parameters if available
from the UDM,** UE indicated preferences, UE subscription information and
network policies, or any combination of them, determines whether MICO mode is
allowed for the UE and indicates it to the UE during Registration procedure.
If NWDAF is deployed, the AMF may also use analytics on UE mobility and/or UE
communication generated by NWDAF (see TS 23.288 [86]) to decide MICO mode
parameters. If the UE does not indicate preference for MICO mode during
Registration procedure, the AMF shall not activate MICO mode for this UE.
The UE and the AMF re- negotiate the MICO mode at every subsequent
Registration procedure. When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED, the AMF may deactivate
MICO mode by triggering Mobility Registration Update procedure through UE
Configuration Update procedure as described in clause 4.2.4 of TS 23.502 [3].
The AMF assigns a registration area to the UE during the Registration
procedure. When the AMF indicates MICO mode to a UE, the registration area is
not constrained by paging area size. If the AMF serving area is the whole
PLMN, based on local policy, and subscription information, may decide to
provide an \"all PLMN\" registration area to the UE. In that case, re-
registration to the same PLMN due to mobility does not apply.
If Mobility Restrictions are applied to a UE in MICO mode, the AMF needs to
allocate an Allowed Area/Non-Allowed Area to the UE as specified in clause
5.3.4.1.
When the AMF indicates MICO mode to a UE, the AMF considers the UE always
unreachable while the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE. The AMF rejects any
request for downlink data delivery for UE in MICO mode and whose UE CM state
in the AMF is CM-IDLE with an appropriate cause. For MT-SMS over NAS, the AMF
notifies the SMSF that UE is not reachable, then the procedure of the
unsuccessful Mobile terminating SMS delivery described in clause 4.13.3.9 of
TS 23.502 [3] is performed. The AMF also defers location services, etc. The UE
in MICO mode is only reachable for mobile terminated data or signalling when
the UE is in CM-CONNECTED.
A UE in MICO mode need not listen to paging while in CM-IDLE. A UE in MICO
mode may stop any access stratum procedures in CM-IDLE, until the UE initiates
transition from CM-IDLE to CM-CONNECTED due to one of the following triggers:
\- A change in the UE (e.g. change in configuration) requires an update of its
registration with the network.
\- Periodic registration timer expires.
\- MO data pending.
\- MO signalling pending (e.g. SM procedure initiated).
If a registration area that is not the \"all PLMN\" registration area is
allocated to a UE in MICO mode, then the UE determines if it is within the
registration area or not when it has MO data or MO signalling, and the UE
performs Mobility Registration Update before the UE initiates the MO data or
MO signalling if it is not within the registration area.
A UE initiating emergency service shall not indicate MICO preference during
Registration procedure. When the MICO mode is already activated in the UE, the
UE and AMF shall locally disable MICO mode after PDU Session Establishment
procedure for Emergency Services is completed successfully. The UE and the AMF
shall not enable MICO mode until the AMF accepts the use of MICO mode in the
next registration procedure. To enable an emergency call back, the UE should
wait for a UE implementation-specific duration of time before requesting the
use of MICO mode after the release of the emergency PDU session.
In order to enable power saving for MT reachability e.g. for Cellular IoT,
enhancements to MICO mode are specified in clause 5.31.7:
\- MICO mode with Extended Connected Time.
\- MICO mode with Active Time.
\- MICO mode and Periodic Registration Timer Control.
### 5.4.2 UE reachability in CM-CONNECTED
For a UE in CM-CONNECTED state:
\- the AMF knows the UE location on a serving (R)AN node granularity.
\- the NG-RAN notifies the AMF when UE becomes unreachable from RAN point of
view.
UE RAN reachability management is used by RAN for UEs in RRC Inactive state,
see TS 38.300 [27]. The location of a UE in RRC Inactive state is known by the
RAN on a RAN Notification area granularity. A UE in RRC Inactive state is
paged in cells of the RAN Notification area that is assigned to the UEs. The
RAN Notification area can be a subset of cells configured in UE\'s
Registration Area or all cells configured in the UE\'s Registration Area. UE
in RRC Inactive state performs RAN Notification Area Update when entering a
cell that is not part of the RAN Notification area that is assigned to the UE.
At transition into RRC Inactive state RAN configures the UE with a periodic
RAN Notification Area Update timer value and the timer is restarted in the UE
with this initial timer value. After the expiry of the periodic RAN
Notification Area Update timer in the UE, the UE in RRC Inactive state
performs periodic RAN Notification Area Update, as specified in TS 38.300
[27].
To aid the UE reachability management in the AMF, RAN uses a guard timer with
a value longer than the RAN Notification Area Update timer value provided to
the UE. Upon the expiry of the periodic RAN Notification Area Update guard
timer in RAN, the RAN shall initiate the AN Release procedure as specified in
TS 23.502 [3]. The RAN may provide the elapsed time since RAN\'s last contact
with the UE to AMF.
### 5.4.3 Paging strategy handling
#### 5.4.3.1 General
Based on operator configuration, the 5GS supports the AMF and NG-RAN to apply
different paging strategies for different types of traffic.
In the case of UE in CM-IDLE state, the AMF performs paging and determines the
paging strategy based on e.g. local configuration, what NF triggered the
paging and information available in the request that triggered the paging. If
NWDAF is deployed, the AMF may also use analytics (i.e. statistics or
predictions) on the UE\'s mobility as provided by NWDAF (see TS 23.288 [86]).
In the case of UE in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the NG-RAN performs
paging and determines the paging strategy based on e.g. local configuration,
and information received from AMF as described in clause 5.4.6.3 and SMF as
described in clause 5.4.3.2.
In the case of Network Triggered Service Request from SMF, the SMF determines
the 5QI and ARP based on the downlink packet (if the SMF performs buffering)
or the Downlink Data Report received from UPF (if the UPF performs buffering).
The SMF includes the 5QI and ARP corresponding to the QoS Flow of the received
downlink PDU in the request sent to the AMF. If the UE is in CM IDLE, the AMF
uses e.g. the 5QI and ARP to derive different paging strategies as described
in clause 4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE: The 5QI is used by AMF to determine suitable paging strategies.
#### 5.4.3.2 Paging Policy Differentiation
Paging policy differentiation is an optional feature that allows the AMF,
based on operator configuration, to apply different paging strategies for
different traffic or service types provided within the same PDU Session. In
this Release of the specification this feature applies only to PDU Session of
IP type.
When the 5GS supports the Paging Policy Differentiation (PPD) feature, the
DSCP value (TOS in IPv4 / TC in IPv6) is set by the application to indicate to
the 5GS which Paging Policy should be applied for a certain IP packet. For
example, as defined in TS 23.228 [15], the P-CSCF may support Paging Policy
Differentiation by marking packet(s) to be sent towards the UE that relate to
a specific IMS services (e.g. conversational voice as defined in IMS
multimedia telephony service).
NOTE 1: This PPD feature may be used to determine the Paging Cause Indication
for Voice Service, as described in clause 5.38.3.
It shall be possible for the operator to configure the SMF in such a way that
the Paging Policy Differentiation feature only applies to certain HPLMNs, DNNs
and 5QIs. In the case of HR roaming, this configuration is done in the SMF in
the VPLMN.
NOTE 2: Support of Paging Policy Differentiation in the case of HR roaming
requires inter operator agreements including on the DSCP value associated with
this feature.
In the case of Network Triggered Service Request and UPF buffering downlink
packets, the UPF shall include the DSCP in TOS (IPv4) / TC (IPv6) value from
the IP header of the downlink packet and an indication of the corresponding
QoS Flow in the Downlink Data Report sent to the SMF. When PPD applies, the
SMF determines the Paging Policy Indicator (PPI) based on the DSCP received
from the UPF.
In the case of Network Triggered Service Request and SMF buffering downlink
packets, when PPD applies, the SMF determines the PPI based on the DSCP in TOS
(IPv4) / TC (IPv6) value from the IP header of the received downlink packet
and identifies the corresponding QoS Flow from the QFI of the received
downlink packet.
The SMF includes the PPI, the ARP and the 5QI of the corresponding QoS Flow in
the N11 message sent to the AMF. If the UE is in CM IDLE, the AMF uses this
information to derive a paging strategy, and sends paging messages to NG-RAN
over N2.
NOTE 3: Network configuration needs to ensure that the information used as a
trigger for Paging Policy Indication is not changed within the 5GS.
NOTE 4: Network configuration needs to ensure that the specific DSCP in TOS
(IPv4) / TC (IPv6) value, used as a trigger for Paging Policy Indication, is
managed correctly in order to avoid the accidental use of certain paging
policies.
For a UE in RRC Inactive state the NG-RAN may enforce specific paging policies
in the case of NG-RAN paging, based on 5QI, ARP and PPI associated with an
incoming DL PDU. To enable this, the SMF instructs the UPF to detect the DSCP
in the TOS (IPv4) / TC (IPv6) value in the IP header of the DL PDU (by using a
DL PDR with the DSCP for this traffic) and to transfer the corresponding PPI
in the CN tunnel header (by using a QER with the PPI value). The NG-RAN can
then utilize the PPI received in the CN tunnel header of an incoming DL PDU in
order to apply the corresponding paging policy for the case the UE needs to be
paged when in RRC Inactive state. In the case of Home-Routed roaming, the
V-SMF is responsible of controlling UPF setting of the PPI. In the case of PDU
Session with I-SMF, the I-SMF is responsible of controlling UPF setting of the
PPI.
#### 5.4.3.3 Paging Priority
Paging Priority is a feature that allows the AMF to include an indication in
the Paging Message sent to NG-RAN that the UE be paged with priority. The
decision by the AMF whether to include Paging Priority in the Paging Message
is based on the ARP value in the message received from the SMF for an IP
packet waiting to be delivered in the UPF. If the ARP value is associated with
select priority services (e.g. MPS, MCS), the AMF includes Paging Priority in
the Paging Message. When the NG-RAN receives a Paging Message with Paging
Priority, it handles the page with priority.
The AMF while waiting for the UE to respond to a page sent without priority
receives another message from the SMF with an ARP associated with select
priority services (e.g. MPS, MCS), the AMF sends another Paging message to the
(R)AN including the Paging Priority. For subsequent messages, the AMF may
determine whether to send the Paging message with higher Paging Priority based
on local policy.
For a UE in RRC Inactive state, the NG-RAN determines Paging Priority based on
the ARP associated with the QoS Flow as provisioned by the operator policy,
and the Core Network Assisted RAN paging information from AMF as described in
clause 5.4.6.3.
### 5.4.4 UE Radio Capability handling
#### 5.4.4.1 UE radio capability information storage in the AMF
This clause applies when no radio capability signalling optimisation is used
between a UE and the network.
The UE Radio Capability information is defined in TS 38.300 [27] and contains
information on RATs that the UE supports (e.g. power class, frequency bands,
etc). Consequently, this information can be sufficiently large that it is
undesirable to send it across the radio interface at every transition of UE CM
state in the AMF from CM‑IDLE to CM‑CONNECTED. To avoid this radio overhead,
the AMF shall store the UE Radio Capability information during CM‑IDLE state
for the UE and RM-REGISTERED state for the UE and the AMF shall if it is
available, send its most up to date UE Radio Capability information to the RAN
in the N2 REQUEST message, i.e. INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST or UE RADIO
CAPABILITY CHECK REQUEST.
NOTE 1: Due to issues with the handling of dynamic UMTS security parameters,
the UTRA UE Radio Capability information is excluded from the information that
is uploaded and stored in the AMF (see TS 38.300 [27]).
The AMF deletes the UE radio capability when the UE RM state in the AMF
transitions to RM-DEREGISTERED. When the AMF receives Registration Request
with the Registration type set to Initial Registration or when it receives the
first Registration Request after E-UTRA/EPC Attach with Registration type set
to Mobility Registration Update, the AMF deletes the UE radio capability.
The UE Radio Capability is maintained in the core network, even during AMF
reselection.
NOTE 2: The UE Radio Capability is not transferred to EPC during the inter-
system mobility.
If the UE\'s NG-RAN or E‑UTRAN UE Radio Capability information changes while
in CM-IDLE state, the UE shall perform the Registration procedure with the
Registration type set to Mobility Registration Update and it also includes
\"UE Radio Capability Update\". (For specific requirements for a UE operating
in dual-registration mode see clause 5.17.2.1). When the AMF receives Mobility
Registration Update Request with \"UE Radio Capability Update\" requested by
the UE, it shall delete any UE Radio Capability information that it has stored
for the UE. If the UE\'s NG-RAN UE Radio Capability information changes when
the UE is in CM-IDLE with Suspend, NAS shall trigger AS to establish a new RRC
connection and not resume the existing one in order to perform the
Registration procedure with the Registration type set to Mobility Registration
Update including \"UE Radio Capability Update\". As a result of this, the
access stratum in the UE will discard the AS information and establish a new
RRC connection as defined in TS 36.331 [51].
If the trigger to change the UE\'s NG-RAN or E‑UTRAN UE Radio Capability
information happens when the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the UE shall first
enter CM-IDLE state and then perform the Registration procedure with the
Registration type set to Mobility Registration Update and it also includes
\"UE Radio Capability Update\".
The RAN stores the UE Radio Capability information, received in the N2 message
or obtained from the UE, for the duration of the UE staying in RRC connected
or RRC Inactive state. Before any 5G SRVCC handover attempt from NG-RAN to
UTRAN, the RAN retrieves the UE\'s UTRA UE Radio Capabilities from the UE.
(For specific requirements for a UE operating in dual-registration mode see
clause 5.17.2.1).
If the AMF sends N2 REQUEST (i.e. INITIAL CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST or UE RADIO
CAPABILITY CHECK REQUEST) message to NG-RAN without UE Radio Capability
information in that message and there is no UE Radio Capability information
available in RAN, this triggers the RAN to request the UE Radio Capability
from the UE and to upload it to the AMF in the N2 UE RADIO CAPABILITY INFO
INDICATION message.
If a UE supports both NB-IoT and other RATs the UE handles the UE Radio
capability information as follows:
\- When the UE is camping on NB-IoT the UE provides only NB-IoT UE radio
capabilities to the network.
\- When the UE is not camping on NB-IoT, the UE provides UE radio capabilities
for the RAT but not NB-IoT UE radio capabilities to the network.
In order to handle the distinct UE radio capabilities, the AMF stores a
separate NB-IoT specific UE Radio Capability information when the UE provides
the UE Radio Capability information while camping on NB-IoT.
When the UE is camping on NB-IoT, the AMF sends, if available, the NB-IoT RAT
specific UE Radio Capability information to the E-UTRAN.
When the UE is not camping on NB-IoT, the AMF sends, if available, UE radio
capabilities for the RAT but not NB-IoT radio capabilities.
#### 5.4.4.1a UE radio capability signalling optimisation (RACS)
With the increase of the size of UE radio capabilities driven e.g. by
additional frequency bands and combinations thereof for E-UTRA and NR, an
efficient approach to signal UE Radio Capability Information over the radio
interface and other network interfaces is defined with RACS.
In this Release of the specification, RACS does not apply to NB-IOT.
RACS works by assigning an identifier to represent a set of UE radio
capabilities. This identifier is called UE Radio Capability ID. A UE Radio
Capability ID can be either UE manufacturer-assigned or PLMN-assigned, as
specified in clause 5.9.10. The UE Radio Capability ID is an alternative to
the signalling of the UE Radio Capability information over the radio
interface, within NG-RAN, from NG-RAN to E-UTRAN, from AMF to NG-RAN and
between CN nodes supporting RACS.
PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is assigned to the UE using the UE
Configuration Update Command, or Registration Accept as defined in TS 23.502
[3]. The UCMF shall be configured with a Version ID for PLMN-assigned UE Radio
Capability IDs, defined in clause 5.9.10.
The UCMF (UE radio Capability Management Function) stores all UE Radio
Capability ID mappings in a PLMN and is responsible for assigning every PLMN-
assigned UE Radio Capability ID in this PLMN, see clause 6.2.21. The UCMF
stores the UE Radio Capability IDs alongside the UE Radio Capability
information and the UE Radio Capability for Paging they map to. Each UE Radio
Capability ID stored in the UCMF can be associated to one or both UE radio
capabilities formats specified in TS 36.331 [51] and TS 38.331 [28]. The two
UE radio capabilities formats shall be identifiable by the AMF and UCMF and
the AMF shall store the TS 38.331 [28] format only.
An NG-RAN which supports RACS can be configured to operate with one of two
modes of operation when providing the UE radio capabilities to the AMF when
the NG-RAN executes a UE Radio Capability Enquiry procedure (see TS 38.331
[28]) to retrieve UE radio capabilities from the UE:
\- Mode of operation A): The NG-RAN provides to the AMF both formats (i.e. the
TS 38.331 [28] format and TS 36.331 [51] format). The NG-RAN derives one of
the UE Radio Capability formats using local transcoding of the other format it
receives from the UE and extracts the E-UTRAN UE Radio Capability for Paging
and NR UE Radio Capability for Paging from the UE Radio capabilities.
\- Mode of operation B): The NG-RAN provides to the AMF the TS 38.331 [28]
format only.
In a PLMN supporting RACS only in 5GS, Mode of Operation B shall be
configured.
If the PLMN supports RACS in both EPS and 5GS:
\- If RAN nodes in the EPS and 5GS are configured in Mode of operation B, then
the UCMF shall be capable to transcode between TS 36.331 [51] and TS 38.331
[28] formats and the UCMF shall be able to generate the RAT-specific UE Radio
Capability for Paging information from the UE Radio Capability.
\- If the NG-RAN is configured to operate according to Mode A, then also the
E-UTRAN shall be configured to operate according to mode A and the UMCF is not
required to transcode between TS 36.331 [51] and TS 38.331 [28] formats and
the AMF shall provide the UE Radio Capability for Paging information.
When the NG-RAN updates the AMF with new UE radio capabilities information,
the AMF provides the information obtained from the NG-RAN to the UCMF even if
the AMF already has a UE Radio Capability ID for that UE. The UCMF then
returns a value of UE Radio Capability ID. If the value is different from the
one stored in the AMF, the AMF updates the UE Radio Capability ID it stores
and provides this new value to the NG-RAN (if applicable) and to the UE.
In order to be able to interpret the UE Radio Capability ID a Network Function
or node may store a local copy of the mapping between the UE Radio Capability
ID and its corresponding UE Radio Capability information i.e. a dictionary
entry. When no mapping is available between a UE Radio Capability ID and the
corresponding UE Radio Capability information in a Network Function or node,
this Network Function or node shall be able to retrieve this mapping and store
it.
\- An AMF which supports RACS shall store such UE Radio Capability ID mapping
at least for all the UEs that it serves that have a UE Radio Capability ID
assigned.
\- The NG-RAN performs local caching of the UE Radio Capability information
for the UE Radio Capability IDs for the UEs it is serving, and potentially for
other UE Radio Capability IDs according to suitable local policies.
\- When the NG-RAN needs to retrieve the mapping of a UE Radio Capability ID
to the corresponding UE Radio Capability information, it queries the AMF using
N2 signalling defined in TS 38.413 [34].
\- When the AMF needs to obtain a PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID for a
UE from the UCMF, it provides the UE Radio Capability information it has for
the current radio configuration of the UE and the IMEI/TAC for the UE and the
UCMF returns a UE Radio Capability ID. The AMF shall provide to the UCMF the
UE Radio Capability information (and at least in Mode A, the UE Radio
Capability for Paging) obtained from the NG-RAN in one or both the TS 36.331
[51] and TS 38.331 [28] formats depending on how the RAN is configured. The
UCMF stores the association of this IMEI/TAC with this UE Radio Capability ID
and the UE Radio Capability information and the UE Radio Capability for Paging
in all the formats it receives. The UE Radio Capability information formats
the AMF provides shall be identifiable at the UCMF.
\- When the AMF needs to obtain the UE Radio Capability information and the UE
Radio Capability for Paging associated to a UE Radio Capability ID it provides
the UE Radio Capability ID to the UCMF with an indication that it is
requesting the TS 38.331 [28] format and the UCMF returns a mapping of the UE
Radio Capability ID to the corresponding UE Radio Capability information in TS
38.331 [28] format to the AMF.
\- UEs, AMFs and RAN nodes which support RACS learn the current value of the
Version ID when a new PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is received from
the UCMF and the Version ID it contains is different from the ones in their
PLMN Assigned UE Radio Capability ID cache. For a PLMN, PLMN-assigned UE Radio
Capability IDs related to old values (i.e. not current value) of the Version
ID can be removed from cache but, if so, prior to removing any cached PLMN-
assigned UE radio Capability IDs with the current value of the Version ID. The
AMF, RAN and UE may continue to use the stored PLMN assigned UE Radio
Capability IDs with old values of the Version ID, until these are purged from
cache. If an out of date PLMN assigned UE Radio Capability ID is removed form
an AMF cache, the AMF shall proceed to assign a new PLMN assigned UE Radio
Capability ID to all the UEs for which the UE context includes the removed
PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID using a UE Configuration Update
procedure, or when these UEs perform a Registration. If the AMF attempts to
resolve a PLMN assigned UE Radio capability ID with an old Version ID, the
UCMF shall return an error code indicating that the Version ID in the UE radio
capability ID is no longer current and proceed to assign a new UE Radio
Capability ID to the UE.
If at any time the AMF has neither a valid UE Radio Capability ID nor any
stored UE radio capabilities for the UE, the AMF may trigger the RAN to
provide the UE Radio Capability information and subsequently request the UCMF
to allocate a UE Radio Capability ID.
\- The RAN, in order to support MOCN network sharing scenarios, shall be
capable to cache PLMN assigned UE Radio Capability IDs per PLMN ID.
A network may utilise the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID, without
involving the UE, e.g. for use with legacy UEs.
Mutual detection of the support of the RACS feature happens between directly
connected NG-RAN nodes and between NG-RAN and AMF using protocol means as
defined in TS 38.413 [34] and TS 38.423 [99]. To allow for a mix of RACS-
supporting and non-RACS-supporting RAN nodes over the Xn interfaces, the UE
Radio Capability ID should be included in the Path Switch signalling during Xn
based handover and Handover Request during N2 based handover between AMF and
NG-RAN. In addition, RACS-supporting RAN nodes can be discovered across inter-
CN node boundaries by using the mechanism defined in TS 38.413 [34] that
allows the source NG-RAN node to retrieve information on the level of support
for a certain feature at the target NG-RAN side by means of information
provided within the Source to Target and Target to Source transparent handover
containers during handover procedure. The support of RACS by peer AMFs or MMEs
is based on configuration in a PLMN or across PLMNs.
A UE that supports WB-E-UTRA and/or NR indicates its support for RACS to AMF
using UE MM Core Network Capability as defined in clause 5.4.4a.
A UE that supports RACS and stores an applicable UE Radio Capability ID for
the current UE Radio Configuration in the PLMN, shall signal the UE Radio
Capability ID in the Initial, and Mobility Registration procedure as defined
in TS 23.502 [3] and based on triggers defined in TS 24.501 [47]. If both
PLMN-assigned for the current PLMN and UE manufacturer-assigned UE Radio
Capability IDs are stored in the UE and applicable in the PLMN, the UE shall
signal the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID in the Registration Request
message.
When a PLMN decides to switch to request a particular type of UE to use UE
manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID(s):
\- The UCMF sends a Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement_Notify message to the AMF
including either a list of UE Radio Capability IDs (if the UE was previously
using any PLMN-assigned IDs) or the IMEI/TAC values corresponding to UE types
that are requested to use UE manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID.
These values are stored in a \"UE Manufacturer Assigned operation requested
list\" in the AMF.
\- The AMF uses the Registration Accept message or the UE Configuration Update
command message to request the UE to delete all the PLMN-assigned UE Radio
Capability ID(s) for this PLMN if the UE is, respectively, registering or is
registered with PLMN-assigned ID or IMEI/TAC values matching one value in the
\"UE Manufacturer Assigned operation requested list\".
NOTE 1: It is expected that in a given PLMN the UCMF and AMFs will be
configured to either use a UE manufacturer-assigned operation requested list
based on a list of PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs or a list of
IMEI/TACs, but not both.
NOTE 2: The strategy for triggering of the deletion of PLMN-assigned UE Radio
Capability ID(s) in the UE by the AMF is implementation-specific (e.g. can be
used only towards UEs in CM_Connected state).
\- a UE that receives indication to delete all the PLMN-assigned UE Radio
Capability IDs in the Registration Accept message, or UE Configuration Update
command message, shall delete any PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs for
this PLMN. The UE proceeds to register with a UE manufacturer-assigned UE
Radio Capability ID that is applicable to the current UE Radio configuration.
\- When the \"UE Manufacturer Assigned operation requested list\" contains
PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs, the UCMF shall avoid re-assigning PLMN-
assigned UE Radio Capability IDs that were added to the \"UE Manufacturer
Assigned operation requested list\" in the AMFs to any UE.
\- The AMF stores a PLMN-assigned ID in the \"UE Manufacturer Assigned
operation requested list\" for a time duration that is implementation
specific, but IMEI/TACs are stored until the UCMF require to remove certain
TACs from the list (i.e. the list of IMEI/TACs which are requested to use UE
manufacturer-assigned IDs in the AMF and UCMF is synchronised at all times).
\- The UCMF can request at any time the AMF to remove PLMN-assigned ID(s) or
IMEI/TAC(s) values from the UE manufacturer-assigned operation requested list.
NOTE 3: The AMF can decide to remove a UE Radio Capability ID from the \"UE
Manufacturer Assigned operation requested list\" list e.g. because no UE with
that UE Radio Capability ID has connected to the network for long time. If
later a UE with such UE Radio Capability ID connects to the network, the AMF
contacts the UCMF to resolve the UE Radio Capability ID, and at this point the
UCMF can trigger again the deletion of the UE Radio Capability ID by including
this in the \"UE Manufacturer Assigned operation requested list\" of the AMF.
The serving AMF stores the UE Radio Capability ID related to selected PLMN for
a UE in the UE context and provides this UE Radio Capability ID to NG-RAN as
part of the UE context information using N2 signalling. During inter PLMN
mobility, the new AMF shall delete the UE Radio Capability ID received from
the old AMF, unless the operator policy indicates that all UE Radio Capability
IDs used in the old PLMN is also valid in the new PLMN.
NOTE 4: If AMF decides to allocate TAIs of multiple PLMN IDs as part of
Registration Area to the UE then AMF provides the UE Radio Capability ID of
the new selected PLMN to the NG-RAN during UE mobility, whether the UE Radio
Capability ID is taken from stored UE context previously assigned by the same
new selected PLMN or generated freshly each time a new PLMN is selected is up
to AMF implementation.
The UE stores the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID in non-volatile memory
when in RM-DEREGISTERED state and can use it again when it registers in the
same PLMN.
NOTE 5: It is assumed that UE does not need to store the access stratum
information (i.e. UE-E-UTRA-Capability and UE-NR-Capability specified in TS
36.331 [51] and TS 38.331 [28], respectively) that was indicated by the UE to
the network when the PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID was assigned by the
network. However, it is assumed that the UE does store the related UE
configuration (e.g. whether or not GERAN or UTRAN or MBMS is
enabled/disabled).
At any given time at most one UE Radio Capability ID is used from the UE
context in CN and RAN which is related to the selected PLMN.
The number of PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs that the UE stores in non-
volatile memory is left up to UE implementation. However, to minimise the load
(e.g. from radio signalling) on the Uu interface and to provide smoother
inter-PLMN mobility (e.g. at land borders) the UE shall be able to store at
least the latest 16 PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs (along with the PLMN
that assigned them). This number is independent of the UE manufacturer-
assigned UE Radio Capability ID(s) the UE may store.
It shall be possible for a UE to change, e.g. upon change in its usage
settings, the set of UE radio capabilities in time and signal the associated
UE Radio Capability ID, if available. The UE stores the mapping between the UE
Radio Capability ID and the corresponding UE Radio Capability Information for
every UE Radio Capability ID it stores.
If the UE\'s Radio Capability Information changes and regardless of whether
the UE has an associated UE Radio Capability ID for the updated UE Radio
Capability information, the UE shall perform the Registration procedure by
sending a Registration Request message to the AMF with the Registration type
set to Mobility Registration Update which includes \"UE Radio Capability
Update\" and:
\- If the UE has an associated UE Radio Capability ID for the updated UE Radio
Capability information, the UE shall include it in the Registration Request
message so that the AMF, upon receiving it, shall update the UE\'s context
with this UE Radio Capability ID.
\- If the UE does not have an associated UE Radio Capability ID for the
updated UE Radio Capability information, the UE shall not include any UE Radio
Capability ID in the Registration Request message so that the AMF, upon
receiving this Registration Request without any UE Radio Capability ID,
retrieves the UE radio capabilities from the UE as defined in clause 5.4.4.1.
The NG-RAN may apply RRC filtering of UE radio capabilities when it retrieves
the UE Radio Capability Information from the UE as defined in TS 38.331 [28].
NOTE 6: In a RACS supporting PLMN, the filter of UE radio capabilities
configured in NG-RAN is preferably as wide in scope as possible (e.g. PLMN-
wide). In this case, it corresponds e.g. to the super-set of bands, band-
combinations and RATs the PLMN deploys and not only to the specific NG-RAN
node or region.
NOTE 7: If the filter, included in the UE Radio Capability information, of UE
radio capabilities configured in two NG-RAN nodes is different, during
handover between these two nodes, it is possible that the target NG-RAN node
might need to enquire the UE for its UE Radio Capability Information again and
trigger re-allocation of a PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID leading to
extra signalling. Additionally, a narrow filter might reduce the list of
candidate target nodes.
If a UE supports both NB-IoT and other RATs that do support RACS (e.g. WB-E-
UTRA and/or NR) then (since there is no support for RACS in NB-IoT) the UE
handles the RACS procedures as follows:
\- NB-IoT specific UE Radio Capability Information is handled in UE, NG-RAN
and AMF according to clause 5.4.4.1 and in EPS according to TS 23.401 [26].
\- when the UE is not camping on NB-IoT, the RAN provides UE radio
capabilities for other RATs but not NB-IoT UE radio capabilities, according to
TS 38.300 [27] and TS 36.300 [30]. As a result the UE Radio Capability ID that
is assigned by the network corresponds only to the UE radio capabilities of
the non-NB-IoT RATs. The UE uses the UE Radio Capability IDs assigned only in
Mobility Registration Update procedures performed over non-NB-IoT RATs.
Support for RACS in EPS is defined in TS 23.401 [26].
#### 5.4.4.2 Void
#### 5.4.4.2a UE Radio Capability Match Request
If the AMF requires more information on the UE radio capabilities support to
be able to set the IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication (see clause
5.16.3), then the AMF may send a UE Radio Capability Match Request message to
the NG-RAN. This procedure is typically used during the Registration Procedure
or when AMF has not received the Voice Support Match Indicator (as part of the
5GMM Context).
NOTE: During the Registration Procedure, if the AMF does not already have the
UEs radio capabilities, and if the RAT where the UE is requires the
establishment of AN security context prior to retrieval of radio capabilities,
the AMF needs to initiate \"Initial Context Setup\" procedure as defined in TS
38.413 [34] to provide the 5G-AN with security context, before sending a UE
Radio Capability Match Request message.
#### 5.4.4.3 Paging assistance information
The paging assistance information contains UE radio related information that
assists the RAN for efficient paging. The Paging assistance information
contains:
a) UE radio capability for paging information:
\- The UE Radio Capability for Paging Information contains information derived
by the NG-RAN node (e.g. band support information) from the UE Radio
Capability information. The AMF stores this information without needing to
understand its contents.
As the AMF only infrequently (e.g. at Initial Registration) prompts the NG-RAN
to retrieve and upload the UE radio capabilities i.e. UE Radio Capability
information to the AMF, and the AMF may be connected to more than one NG-RAN
RAT, it is the responsibility of the NG-RAN to ensure that UE Radio Capability
for Paging Information (which is derived by the NG-RAN node) contains
information on all NG-RAN RATs that the UE supports in that PLMN. To assist
the NG-RAN in this task, as specified in TS 38.413 [34], the AMF provides its
stored UE Radio Capability for Paging Information in every NG-AP INITIAL
CONTEXT SETUP REQUEST message sent to the NG-RAN.
\- The UE Radio Capability for Paging Information is maintained in the core
network, even during AMF reselection, and is stored in the UCMF alongside the
UE Radio Capability information associated to a UE Radio Capability ID.
b) Information On Recommended Cells And RAN nodes For Paging:
\- Information sent by the NG-RAN, and used by the AMF when paging the UE to
help determining the NG RAN nodes to be paged as well as to provide the
information on recommended cells to each of these RAN nodes, in order to
optimize the probability of successful paging while minimizing the signalling
load on the radio path.
\- The RAN provides this information during N2 release.
### 5.4.4a UE MM Core Network Capability handling
The UE MM Core Network Capability is split into the S1 UE network capability
(mostly for E-UTRAN access related core network parameters) and the UE 5GMM
Core Network Capability (mostly to include other UE capabilities related to
5GCN or interworking with EPS) as defined in TS 24.501 [47] and contains non
radio-related capabilities, e.g. the NAS security algorithms, etc. The S1 UE
network capability is transferred between all CN nodes at AMF to AMF, AMF to
MME, MME to MME, and MME to AMF changes. The UE 5GMM Core Network Capability
is transferred only at AMF to AMF changes.
In order to ensure that the UE MM Core Network Capability information stored
in the AMF is up to date (e.g. to handle the situation when the USIM is moved
into a different device while out of coverage, and the old device did not send
the Detach message; and the cases of inter-RAT Registration Area Update), the
UE shall send the UE MM Core Network Capability information to the AMF during
the Initial Registration and Mobility Registration Update procedure within the
NAS message.
The AMF shall store always the latest UE MM Core Network Capability received
from the UE. Any UE MM Core Network Capability that an AMF receives from an
old AMF/MME is replaced when the UE provides the UE MM Core Network Capability
with Registration signalling.
If the UE\'s UE MM Core Network Capability information changes (in either CM-
CONNECTED or in CM-IDLE state), the UE shall perform a Mobility Registration
Update procedure when it next returns to NG-RAN coverage. See clause 4.2.2 of
TS 23.502 [3].
The UE shall indicate in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability if the UE
supports:
\- Attach in EPC with Request type \"Handover\" in PDN CONNECTIVITY Request
message (clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [26]).
\- EPC NAS.
\- SMS over NAS.
\- LCS.
\- 5G SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN, as specified in TS 23.216 [88].
\- Radio Capabilities Signalling optimisation (RACS).
\- Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization.
\- Parameters in Supported Network Behaviour for 5G CIoT as described in
clause 5.31.2.
\- Receiving WUS Assistance Information (E-UTRA) see clause 5.4.9..
\- Paging Subgrouping Support Indication (NR) see clause 5.4.12.
\- CAG, see clause 5.30.3.3.
\- Subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network
slices (see clause 5.15.12).
\- Support of NSAG (see clause 5.15.14).
\- Minimization of Service Interruption (MINT), as described in clause 5.40.
If a UE operating two or more USIMs, supports and intends to use one or more
Multi-USIM features (see clause 5.38) in a PLMN for a USIM, it shall indicate
in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability for this USIM in this PLMN that it
supports these one or more Multi-USIM features with the following indications:
\- Connection Release Supported.
\- Paging Cause Indication for Voice Service Supported.
\- Reject Paging Request Supported.
\- Paging Restriction Supported.
Otherwise, the UE with the capabilities of Multi-USIM features but does not
intend to use them shall not indicate support of these one or more Multi-USIM
features.
A UE not operating two or more USIMs shall indicate the Multi-USIM features
are not supported.
NOTE: It is not necessary for a UE operating two or more USIMs to use Multi-
USIM features with all USIMs.
### 5.4.4b UE 5GSM Core Network Capability handling
The UE 5GSM Core Network Capability is included in PDU Session
Establishment/Modification Request.
The UE shall indicate in the UE 5GSM Core Network Capability whether the UE
supports:
\- \"Ethernet\" PDU Session Type supported in EPC as PDN Type \"Ethernet\";
\- Reflective QoS;
\- Multi-homed IPv6 PDU Session (only if the Requested PDU Type was set to
\"IPv6\" or \"IPv4v6\");
\- ATSSS capability (as referred to clause 5.32.2);
\- Transfer of Port Management Information containers.
The 5GSM Core Network Capability is transferred, if needed, from V-SMF to
H-SMF during PDU Session Establishment/Modification procedure.
After the first inter-system change from EPS to 5GS for a PDU session
established in EPS, the 5GSM Core Network Capability is also included in the
PDU Session Modification if the Reflective QoS and/or Multi-homed IPv6 PDU
Session is present.
### 5.4.5 DRX (Discontinuous Reception) framework
The 5G System supports DRX architecture which allows Idle mode DRX cycle is
negotiated between UE and the AMF. The Idle mode DRX cycle applies in CM-IDLE
state and in CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state.
If the UE wants to use UE specific DRX parameters, the UE shall include its
preferred values consistently in every Initial Registration and Mobility
Registration procedure separately for NR/WB-EUTRA and NB-IoT. During Initial
Registration and Mobility Registration procedures performed on NB-IoT cells,
the normal 5GS procedures apply. For NB-IoT, the cell broadcasts an indication
of support of UE specific DRX for NB-IoT in that cell, and the UE can request
UE specific DRX for NB-IoT in the Registration procedure irrespective of
whether the cell broadcasts that support indication.
The AMF shall determine Accepted DRX parameters based on the received UE
specific DRX parameters and the AMF should accept the UE requested values, but
subject to operator policy the AMF may change the UE requested values.
The AMF shall respond to the UE with the Accepted DRX parameters separately
for NR/WB-EUTRA and NB-IoT.
For details of DRX parameters, see TS 38.331 [28] and TS 36.331 [51].
The UE shall apply the DRX cycle broadcast in the cell by the RAN unless it
has received Accepted DRX parameters for the RAT from the AMF and for NB-IoT
the cell supports UE specific DRX for NB-IoT, in which case the UE shall apply
either the DRX cycle broadcast in the cell or the Accepted DRX parameters for
the RAT, as defined in TS 38.304 [50] and TS 36.304 [52].
The Periodic Registration procedure does not change the UE\'s DRX settings.
In CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive state, the UE applies either the DRX cycle
negotiated with AMF, or the DRX cycle broadcast by RAN or the UE specific DRX
cycle configured by RAN, as defined in TS 38.300 [27] and TS 38.304 [50].
### 5.4.6 Core Network assistance information for RAN optimization
#### 5.4.6.1 General
Core Network assistance information for RAN aids the RAN to optimize the UE
state transition steering and the RAN paging strategy formulation in RRC
Inactive state. The Core Network assistance information includes the
information set, Core Network assisted RAN parameters tuning, which assist RAN
optimize the UE RRC state transition and CM state transition decision. It also
includes the information set, Core Network assisted RAN paging information,
which assist RAN to formulate an optimized paging strategy when RAN paging is
triggered.
#### 5.4.6.2 Core Network assisted RAN parameters tuning
Core Network assisted RAN parameters tuning aids the RAN to minimize the UE
state transitions and achieve optimum network behaviour. How the RAN uses the
CN assistance information is not defined in this specification.
Core Network assisted RAN parameters tuning may be derived by the AMF per UE
in the AMF based on collection of UE behaviour statistics, Expected UE
Behaviour and/or other available information about the UE (such as subscribed
DNN, SUPI ranges, or other information). If the AMF maintains Expected UE
Behaviour parameters, Network Configuration parameters (as described in clause
4.15.6.3 or 4.15.6.3a, TS 23.502 [3]) or SMF derived CN assisted RAN
parameters tuning, the AMF may use this information for selecting the CN
assisted RAN parameter values. If the AMF is able to derive the Mobility
Pattern of the UE (as described in clause 5.3.4.2), the AMF may take the
Mobility Pattern information into account when selecting the CN assisted RAN
parameter values.
The SMF uses the SMF-Associated parameters (e.g. Expected UE Behaviour
parameters or Network Configuration parameters of the UE) to derive the SMF
derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning. The SMF sends the SMF derived CN
assisted RAN parameters tuning to the AMF during the PDU Session establishment
procedure and if the SMF-Associated parameters change the PDU Session
modification procedure is applied. The AMF stores the SMF derived CN assisted
RAN parameters tuning in the PDU Session level context. The AMF uses the SMF
derived CN assisted RAN parameters tuning to determine a PDU Session level
\"Expected UE activity behaviour\" parameters set, which may be associated
with a PDU Session ID, as described below in this clause.
The Expected UE Behaviour parameters or the Network Configuration parameters
can be provisioned by external party via the NEF to the AMF or SMF, as
described in clause 5.20.
The CN assisted RAN parameters tuning provides the RAN with a way to
understand the UE behaviour for these aspects:
\- \"Expected UE activity behaviour\", i.e. the expected pattern of the UE\'s
changes between CM-CONNECTED and CM-IDLE states or the duration of CM-
CONNECTED state. This may be derived e.g. from the statistical information, or
**Expected UE Behaviour** or from subscription information. The AMF derives
one or more sets of the \"Expected UE activity behaviour\" parameters for the
UE as follows:
\- AMF may derive and provide to the RAN a UE level of \"Expected UE activity
behaviour\" parameters set considering the Expected UE Behaviour parameters or
Network Configuration parameters received from the UDM (see clauses 4.15.6.3
or 4.15.6.3a of TS 23.502 [3]) and the SMF derived CN assisted RAN parameters
tuning associated with a PDU Session using Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation. This set of \"Expected UE activity behaviour\" parameters is
valid for the UE; and
\- AMF may provide to the RAN a PDU Session level \"Expected UE activity
behaviour\" parameters set, e.g. considering the SMF derived CN assisted RAN
parameters tuning, per established PDU Session. The PDU Session level
\"Expected UE activity behaviour\" set of parameters is associated with and
valid for a PDU Session ID. The RAN may consider the PDU Session level
\"Expected UE activity behaviour\" parameters when the User Plane resources
for the PDU Session are activated;
\- \"Expected HO behaviour\", i.e. the expected interval between inter-RAN
handovers. This may be derived by the AMF e.g. from the Mobility Pattern
information;
\- \"Expected UE mobility\", i.e. whether the UE is expected to be stationary
or mobile. This may be derived e.g. from the statistical information or
Expected UE Behaviour parameters or from subscription information;
\- \"Expected UE moving trajectory\" which may be derived e.g. from the
statistical information or Expected UE Behaviour parameters or from
subscription information; or
\- \"UE Differentiation Information\" including the Expected UE Behaviour
parameters excluding the Expected UE moving trajectory (see clause 4.15.6.3 of
TS 23.502 [3]) to support Uu operation optimisation for NB-IoT UE
differentiation if the RAT type is NB-IoT.
The AMF decides when to send this information to the RAN as \"Expected UE
activity behaviour\" carried in N2 request over the N2 interface (see TS
38.413 [34]).
NOTE: The calculation of the CN assistance information, i.e. the algorithms
used and related criteria, and the decision when it is considered suitable and
stable to send to the RAN are vendor specific.
#### 5.4.6.3 Core Network assisted RAN paging information
Core Network assisted RAN paging information aids the RAN to formulate a RAN
paging policy and strategy in RRC Inactive state, besides the PPI and QoS
information associated to the QoS Flows as indicated in clause 5.4.3.
CN assisted RAN paging information may be derived by the AMF per UE and/or per
PDU Session based on collection of UE behaviour statistics, Expected UE
Behaviour and/or other available information about the UE (such as subscribed
DNN, SUPI ranges, Multimedia priority service), and/or information received
from other network functions when downlink signalling is triggered.
The CN assisted RAN paging information consists of a service priority (values
1 to 256) which provides AN with a way to understand how important the
downlink signalling is. The AMF derives this service priority based on
available information as described above. The method to derive the service
priority is implementation depended and can be controlled by operator.
The Core Network may provide the CN assisted RAN paging information to RAN in
different occasions, e.g. during downlink N1 and N2 message delivery, etc.
### 5.4.7 NG-RAN location reporting
NG-RAN supports the NG-RAN location reporting for the services that require
accurate cell identification (e.g. emergency services, lawful intercept,
charging) or for the UE mobility event notification service subscribed to the
AMF by other NFs. The NG-RAN location reporting may be used by the AMF when
the target UE is in CM-CONNECTED state. The NG-RAN location reporting may be
used by the AMF to determine the geographically located TAI in the case of NR
satellite access.
The AMF may request the NG-RAN location reporting with event reporting type
(e.g. UE location or UE presence in Area of Interest), reporting mode and its
related parameters (e.g. number of reporting).
If the AMF requests UE location, the NG-RAN reports the current UE location
(or last known UE location with time stamp if the UE is in RRC Inactive state)
based on the requested reporting parameter (e.g. one-time reporting or
continuous reporting).
If the AMF requests UE location, in the case of NR satellite access, the NG-
RAN provides all broadcast TAIs to the AMF as part of the ULI. The NG-RAN also
reports the TAI where the UE is geographically located if this TAI can be
determined.
If the AMF requests UE presence in the Area Of Interest, the NG-RAN reports
the UE location and the indication (i.e. IN, OUT or UNKNOWN) when the NG-RAN
determines the change of UE presence in Area Of Interest.
After N2 based Handover, if the NG-RAN location reporting information is
required, the AMF shall re-request the NG-RAN location reporting to the target
NG-RAN node. For Xn based Handover, the source NG-RAN shall transfer the
requested NG-RAN location reporting information to target NG-RAN node.
The AMF requests the location information of the UE either through independent
N2 procedure (i.e. NG-RAN location reporting as specified in clause 4.10 of TS
23.502 [3]), or by including the request in some specific N2 messages as
specified in TS 38.413 [34].
### 5.4.8 Support for identification and restriction of using unlicensed
spectrum
Support for NG-RAN using unlicensed spectrum is defined in TS 38.300 [27] and
TS 36.300 [30].
For NG-RAN, in the case of NR in stand-alone mode, all cells are in unlicensed
spectrum and the NR is used as primary RAT. NR or E-UTRA cells in unlicensed
spectrum, can be used as secondary cells as specified in the Dual Connectivity
architecture defined in clause 5.11 or in addition can be configured to
support the Carrier Aggregation Architecture (CA) defined in TS 38.300 [27]
and TS 36.300 [30].
For either case the serving PLMN can enforce Access Restriction for Unlicensed
Spectrum (either signalled from the UDM, or, locally generated by VPLMN policy
in the AMF) with the following:
\- To restrict the use of NR in unlicensed spectrum as primary RAT, the AMF
rejects the UE Registration procedure with appropriate cause code defined in
TS 24.501 [47] if the UE performs initial access from NR using unlicensed
spectrum. If the UE is accessing through some other allowed RAT, the AMF
signals this access restriction to NG-RAN as part of Mobility Restriction
List.
\- To restrict the use of use of unlicensed spectrum with NR or E-UTRA as
secondary RAT using Dual Connectivity or Carrier Aggregation Architecture (CA)
defined in TS 38.300 [27] and TS 36.300 [30], the AMF signals this access
restriction to NG-RAN as part of Mobility Restriction List.
An NG-RAN node supporting aggregation with unlicensed spectrum using either NR
or E-UTRA checks whether the UE is allowed to use unlicensed spectrum based on
received Mobility Restriction List. If the UE is not allowed to use Unlicensed
Spectrum, the NG-RAN node shall restrict the using of unlicensed spectrum,
either NR or E-UTRA as secondary RATs when using either Dual Connectivity or
Carrier Aggregation (CA) as defined in TS 38.300 [27] and TS 36.300 [30].
At inter-RAT handover from E-UTRAN/EPS, the Access Restriction for Unlicensed
Spectrum is either already in the AMF\'s UE context, or is obtained from the
UDM during the subsequent Registration Area Update procedure (i.e. not from
the source MME or source RAN). In both inter-RAT handover cases, any Access
Restriction for use of Unlicensed Spectrum is then signalled to NG-RAN or
enforced in AMF.
NOTE: This signalling of the Access Restriction during the Registration Area
Update after the inter-RAT handover procedure means that there is a small risk
that unlicensed spectrum resources are transiently allocated.
When the UE is accessing 5GS using unlicensed spectrum as primary RAT:
\- The NG-RAN node shall provide an indication to the AMF in N2 interface that
NR access is using unlicensed spectrum as defined in TS 38.413 [34].
\- In order to restrict access to NR in unlicensed spectrum, cells supporting
NR in unlicensed spectrum have to be deployed in Tracking Area(s) different to
cells supporting licensed spectrum.
\- When the AMF receives an indication from NG-RAN over N2 whether NR in
unlicensed spectrum is being used as defined in TS 38.413 [34], the AMF
provides to the SMF an indication that the RAT type is NR with usage of
unlicensed spectrum during PDU Session Establishment or as part of the UP
activation and Handover procedures.
\- The PCF will also receive the indication whether the UE is using NR in
unlicensed spectrum, when applicable, from the SMF during SM Policy
Association Establishment or SM Policy Association Modification procedure.
\- The NFs generating CDRs shall include the indication that the UE is using
NR in unlicensed spectrum in their CDRs.
When the UE is accessing NR or E-UTRA using unlicensed spectrum as secondary
RAT, procedures for Usage Data Reporting for Secondary RAT as defined in
clause 5.12.2 can apply.
### 5.4.9 Wake Up Signal Assistance
#### 5.4.9.1 General
The RAN and UE may use a Wake Up Signal (WUS) to reduce the UE\'s idle mode
power consumption. The RAN sends the WUS shortly before the UE\'s paging
occasion. The WUS feature enables UEs to determine that in the paging
occasions immediately following their WUS occasion they will not be paged if
their WUS is not transmitted, or that they might be paged if their WUS is
transmitted (see TS 36.304 [52]).
To avoid waking up UEs due to an AMF paging other UEs across multiple cells
(e.g. due to frequent UE mobility and/or for low paging latency services such
as VoLTE), the use of WUS by the ng-eNB and the UE is restricted to the last
used cell, i.e. the cell in which the UE\'s RRC connection was last released.
To support this:
a) ng-eNBs should provide the Recommended Cells for Paging IE in the
_Information on Recommended Cells and RAN Nodes for Paging IE_ (see TS 38.413
[34]) to the AMF in the NGAP UE Context Release Complete, UE Context Suspend
Request and UE Context Resume Request messages;
b) if received during the last NGAP UE Context Release Complete or UE Context
Suspend Request message, the AMF provides (without modification) the
_Recommended Cells for Paging as Assistance Data for Recommended Cells IE in
the Assistance Data for Paging IE_ within the NGAP Paging message to the RAN
(see also TS 38.413 [34]); and
c) the AMF shall delete (or mark as invalid) the _Information On Recommended
Cells And RAND nodes For Paging_ when a new NGAP association is established
for the UE.
In the NGAP Paging message, the last used cell ID is sent in the _Assistance
Data for Recommended Cells IE_ in the _Assistance Data for Paging IE_ (see TS
38.413 [34]). When receiving an NGAP Paging message for a WUS-capable UE that
also includes the _Assistance Data for Recommended Cells IE_ then a WUS-
capable ng-eNB shall only broadcast the WUS on the cell that matches the last
used cell ID.
#### 5.4.9.2 Group Wake Up Signal
To support the Wake Up Signal (WUS), the WUS Assistance Information is used by
the ng-eNB to help determine the WUS group used when paging the UE (see TS
36.300 [30]).
The content of the WUS Assistance Information consists of the paging
probability information. The paging probability information provides a metric
on the probability of a UE receiving a paging message based on, e.g.
statistical information.
The UE may in the Registration Request message provide its capability to
support receiving WUS Assistance Information. If WUS Assistance Information is
supported by the UE, then the UE in the Registration Request message may
provide the additional UE paging probability information. The AMF may use the
UE provided paging probability, local configuration and/or previous
statistical information for the UE, when determining the WUS Assistance
Information. If the UE supports WUS Assistance Information, the AMF may assign
WUS Assistance Information to the UE, even when the UE has not provided the
additional UE paging probability information.
If the AMF has determined WUS Assistance Information for the UE, the AMF
provides it to the UE in every Registration Accept message. The AMF stores the
WUS Assistance Information parameter in the MM context and provides it to the
ng-eNB when paging the UE.
UE and AMF shall not signal WUS Assistance Information in Registration
Request, Registration Accept messages when the UE has an active emergency PDU
session.
### 5.4.10 Support for identification and restriction of using NR satellite
access
Support for NR satellite access is specified in TS 38.300 [27].
Editor\'s note: TS 38.300 [27] not yet updated by RAN groups.
The AMF determines the RAT Type for NR satellite access, i.e. NR(LEO),
NR(MEO), NR(GEO) and NR(OTHERSAT). When the UE is accessing NR using satellite
access, an indication is provided in N2 interface indicating the type of NR
satellite access, as defined in TS 38.413 [34].
Editor\'s note: Further details on what type of satellite platforms OTHERSAT
includes is FFS and to be aligned with RAN WG3.
The serving PLMN can enforce mobility restrictions for NR satellite access as
specified in clause 5.3.4.1.
In order to enable efficient enforcement of Mobility Restrictions, cells of
each NR satellite RAT Type (NR(LEO), NR(MEO), NR(GEO) or NR(OTHERSAT)) need to
be deployed in TAs different from TAs for other NR satellite RAT Types as well
as different from TAs supporting terrestrial access RAT Types.
The AMF may initiate deregistration of the UE when an N2 UE Context Release
Request is received with cause value indicating that the UE is not in PLMN
serving area, as specified in TS 38.413 [34].
### 5.4.11 Support for integrating NR satellite access into 5GS
#### 5.4.11.1 General
This clause describes the specific aspects for NR satellite access.
#### 5.4.11.2 Support of RAT types defined in 5GC for satellite access
In case of NR satellite access, the RAT Types values \"NR(LEO)\", \"NR(MEO)\",
\"NR(GEO)\" and \"NR(OTHERSAT)\" are used in 5GC to distinguish the different
NR satellite access types (see clause 5.4.10).
When a UE is accessing to the network via satellite access, the AMF determines
the RAT type as specified in clause 5.4.10.
#### 5.4.11.3 Void
#### 5.4.11.4 Verification of UE location
In order to ensure that the regulatory requirements are met, the network may
be configured to enforce that the selected PLMN is allowed to operate in the
current UE location by verifying the UE location during Mobility Management
and Session Management procedures. In this case, when the AMF receives a NGAP
message containing User Location Information for a UE using NR satellite
access, the AMF may decide to verify the UE location. If the AMF determines
based on the Selected PLMN ID and ULI (including Cell ID) received from the
gNB that it is not allowed to operate at the present UE location the AMF
should reject any NAS request with a suitable cause value. If the UE is
already registered to the network when the AMF determines that it is not
allowed to operate at the present UE location, the AMF may initiate
deregistration of the UE. The AMF should not reject the request or deregister
the UE unless it has sufficiently accurate UE location information to
determine that the UE is located in a geographical area where the PLMN is not
allowed to operate.
NOTE 1: The area where the UE is allowed to operate can be determined based on
the regulatory area where the PLMN is allowed to operate based on its
licensing conditions.
If the AMF, based on the ULI, is not able to determine the UE\'s location with
sufficient accuracy to make a final decision, the AMF proceeds with the
Mobility Management or Session Management procedure and may initiate UE
location procedure after the Mobility Management or Session Management
procedure is complete, as specified in clause 6.10.1 of TS 23.273 [87], to
determine the UE location. The AMF shall be prepared to deregister the UE if
the information received from LMF indicates that the UE is registered to a
PLMN that is not allowed to operate in the UE location. In the case of a NAS
procedure, the AMF should either reject any NAS request targeted towards a
PLMN that is not allowed to operate in the known UE location and indicate a
suitable cause value, or accept the NAS procedure and initiate deregistration
procedure once the UE location is known. In the deregistration message to the
UE, the AMF shall include a suitable cause value. For UE processing of the
cause value indicating that the PLMN is not allowed to operate in the current
UE location, see TS 23.122 [17] and TS 24.501 [47].
NOTE 2: In this Release of the specification, there is no specific support for
network verified positioning.
In the case of a handover procedure, if the (target) AMF determines that it is
not allowed to operate at the current UE location, the AMF either rejects the
handover, or accepts the handover and later deregisters the UE.
#### 5.4.11.5 Network selection for NR satellite access
Network selection principles specified in clause 5.2.2 apply also for NR
satellite access.
For NR satellite access, a UE with location capability should use its
awareness of its location to select a PLMN that is allowed to operate in the
UE location as specified in TS 23.122 [17].
In order to ensure that the regulatory requirements are met, the network may
be configured to enforce this UE choice by verifying the UE location, as
described in clause 5.4.11.4.
#### 5.4.11.6 Support of Mobility Registration Update
A moving radio cell for NR satellite access may indicate support for one or
more TACs for each PLMN. A UE that is registered with a PLMN may access a
radio cell and does not need to perform a Mobility Registration Update
procedure as long as at least one supported TAC for the RPLMN or equivalent to
the RPLMN is part of the UE Registration Area. A UE shall perform a Mobility
Registration Update procedure when accessing a radio cell where none of the
supported TACs for the RPLMN or equivalent to the RPLMN are part of the UE
Registration Area.
When indicating a last visited TAI in a Registration Update, a UE may indicate
any TAI supported in a radio cell for the RPLMN or equivalent to the RPLMN for
the last UE access prior to the Registration Update that is part of the UE
Registration Area.
#### 5.4.11.7 Tracking Area handling for NR satellite access
In the case of NR satellite access with moving cells, in order to ensure that
each TA is Earth-stationary even if the radio cells are moving across the
Earth\'s surface, the NG-RAN may change the TAC values that are broadcast in a
cell\'s system information as the cell moves, as described in TS 38.300 [27]
and TS 38.331 [28].
NG-RAN may broadcast in a cell a single TAC per PLMN and change that TAC value
as the cell moves. Alternatively, the NG-RAN may broadcast in a cell more than
one TAC for a PLMN and add or remove TAC values as the cell moves. The NG-RAN
provides either the single broadcast TAI or all broadcast TAIs corresponding
to the Selected PLMN as described in TS 38.413 [34] to the AMF as part of the
ULI, whenever the ULI is included in the NGAP message as described in TS
38.413 [34]. The NG-RAN indicates, if known, also the TAI where the UE is
geographically located.
NOTE: The AMF may take the TAI where the UE is geographically located into
account to generate a suitable Registration Area for the UE.
#### 5.4.11.8 Support for mobility Forbidden Area and Service Area
Restrictions for NR satellite access
Forbidden Area functionality is supported as described in clause 5.3.4.1.1
with the modifications described below:
\- The AMF and the UE receive the broadcast TAI (if a single TAI is broadcast)
or all broadcast TAIs (if multiple TAIs are broadcast) from the NG-RAN as
described clause 5.4.11.7. The AMF considers the UE to be in a Forbidden Area
if the only received TAI is forbidden or if all received TAIs are forbidden
based on subscription data. The UE considers it is in a Forbidden Area if the
only received TAI is forbidden, or if all received TAIs are forbidden and is
not within a Forbidden Area in the case that at least one broadcast TAI is not
forbidden.
\- If AMF receives multiple TAIs from the NG-RAN and determines that some, but
not all of them are forbidden by subscription or by operator policy, the AMF
shall send the forbidden TAI(s) to the UE as described in clauses 4.2.2.2 and
4.2.3 in TS 23.502 [3]. The UE stores the TAI(s) in the appropriate Forbidden
Area list and removes the TAI(s) from Registration Area if present.
Service Area Restrictions functionality is supported as described in clause
5.3.4.1.2 with the modifications described below:
\- The AMF receives the broadcast TAI (if a single TAI is broadcast) or all
broadcast TAIs (if multiple TAIs are broadcast) from the NG-RAN as described
clause 5.4.11.7. The AMF provides the UE with Service Area Restrictions which
consist of either Allowed Areas or Non-Allowed Areas, as described in clause
5.3.4.1.2. The UE and AMF consider the UE to be in a Non-Allowed Area if none
of the broadcast TAIs is Allowed. The UE and AMF consider the UE to be in an
Allowed Area if at least one broadcast TAI is allowed.
### 5.4.12 Paging Early Indication with Paging Subgrouping Assistance
#### 5.4.12.1 General
The RAN and UE may use a Paging Early Indication with Paging Subgrouping
(PEIPS) to reduce the UE\'s power consumption in RRC_IDLE and RRC_INACTIVE
over NR (see TS 38.304 [50]).
The paging subgrouping can be based on either the UE\'s temporary ID or a
Paging Subgroup ID allocated by the AMF. Paging subgrouping based on the UE\'s
temporary ID is implemented within the NG-RAN. For paging subgrouping based on
UE\'s temporary ID, the UE\'s support is included in the UE Radio Capability
for Paging, either derived by the NG-RAN from UE provided UE radio capability
(see clause 5.4.4) or based on UE Radio Capability ID if UE radio capability
signalling optimisation is used (see clause 5.4.4.1a).
The AMF, when determining its paging strategy (see clause 5.4.3), should take
into consideration whether a gNB is using Paging subgrouping based on the
UE\'s temporary ID.
NOTE: Paging messages sent to that gNB can increase UE power consumption for
other UEs that support Paging Subgrouping based on the UE\'s temporary ID.
If paging subgroups are being allocated by the AMF, then all AMFs connected to
one gNB (including the AMFs in different PLMNs using 5G MOCN network sharing)
shall use a consistent policy in allocating UEs to the paging subgroups. The
AMF may configure up to 8 different Paging Subgroup IDs.
NOTE: Because the UE uses the AMF allocated paging subgroup across all cells
in its TAI-list, and, different, overlapping TAI lists can be allocated to
different UEs, then to avoid UE power consumption increasing, it is likely to
be necessary that all AMFs with an overlapping coverage area use a consistent
policy in allocating UEs to the paging subgroups.
The NG-RAN node and the UE determine per cell which paging subgrouping method
to use as defined in TS 38.304 [50] and TS 38.331 [28].
#### 5.4.12.2 Core Network Assistance for PEIPS
To support the Paging Early Indication with Paging Subgrouping (PEIPS), Paging
Subgrouping Support Indication and the PEIPS Assistance Information is used by
the AMF and NG-RAN to help determine whether PEIPS applies to the UE and which
paging subgroup used when paging the UE (see TS 38.300 [27]).
In the Registration Request message, the Paging Subgrouping Support Indication
indicates whether the UE supports PEIPS with AMF PEIPS Assistance Information.
If the UE includes Paging Subgrouping Support Indication, the UE may also
include the paging probability information to assist the AMF. If the AMF
supports PEIPS assistance and if the UE provided Paging Subgrouping Support
Indication, the AMF stores the indication in the UE context in AMF. The AMF
may use local configuration, the UE\'s paging probability information if
provided, information provided by the RAN (e.g. any of the _Information On
Recommended Cells And RAN nodes For Paging_), and/or previous statistical
information for the UE to determine the AMF PEIPS Assistance Information. The
AMF PEIPS Assistance Information includes the Paging Subgroup ID.
NOTE 1: To minimise MT voice call setup latency, the AMF could allocate Paging
Subgroup IDs taking into account whether or not the UE is likely to receive
IMS voice over PS session calls.
NOTE 2: To avoid MT traffic for more mobile UEs causing more stationary UEs to
be woken up, the AMF could allocate Paging Subgroup IDs taking into account
the UE\'s mobility pattern.
If the AMF has determined AMF PEIPS Assistance Information for the UE, the AMF
stores it in the UE context in AMF and provides it to the UE in every
Registration Accept message.
If the AMF has determined AMF PEIPS Assistance Information, the AMF shall
provide it to NG RAN when paging the UE. In addition, in order to support
PEIPS for UEs in RRC_INACTIVE mode, the AMF shall provide the AMF PEIPS
Assistance Information to NG-RAN as part of the RRC Inactive Assistance
Information.
The NG-RAN chooses on a per-cell basis whether to use PEIPS and which paging
subgrouping mechanism to use. When using AMF allocated subgroups, both the UE
and NG-RAN use the AMF PEIPS Assistance Information to determine the paging
subgroup to apply as defined in TS 38.300 [27].
The AMF may use the UE Configuration Update procedure (as described in clause
4.2.4 of TS 23.502 [3]) and N2 UE Context Modification procedure (as described
in clause 8.3.4 of TS 38.413 [34]) to update the AMF PEIPS Assistance
Information in the UE and NG-RAN.
When the UE has an active emergency PDU Session:
\- The UE shall not signal Paging Subgrouping Support Indication in the
Registration Request message.
## 5.5 Non-3GPP access specific aspects
### 5.5.0 General
This clause describe the specific aspects for untrusted non-3GPP access,
trusted non-3GPP access and W-5GAN access.
### 5.5.1 Registration Management
This clause applies to Non-3GPP access network corresponding to the Untrusted
Non-3GPP access network, to the Trusted Non-3GPP access network and to the
W-5GAN. In the case of W-5GAN the UE mentioned in this clause corresponds to
5G-RG or to the W-AGF in the case of FN-RG. In the case of N5CW devices access
5GC via trusted WLAN access networks, the UE mentioned in this clause
corresponds to TWIF.
The UE shall enter RM-DEREGISTERED state and the AMF shall enter RM-
DEREGISTERED state for the UE on non-3GPP access as follows:
\- at the UE and at the AMF, after performing an Explicit Deregistration
procedure;
\- at the AMF, after the Network non-3GPP Implicit Deregistration timer has
expired.
\- at the UE, after the UE non-3GPP Deregistration timer has expired.
NOTE: This is assumed to leave sufficient time to allow the UE to re-activate
UP connections for the established PDU Sessions over 3GPP or non-3GPP access.
Whenever a UE registered over non-3GPP access enters CM-IDLE state for the
non-3GPP access, it starts the UE non-3GPP Deregistration timer according to
the value received from the AMF during a Registration procedure.
Over non-3GPP access, the AMF runs the Network non-3GPP Implicit
Deregistration timer. The Network non-3GPP Implicit Deregistration timer is
started with a value longer than the UE\'s non-3GPP Deregistration timer,
whenever the CM state for the UE registered over non-3GPP access changes to
CM-IDLE for the non-3GPP access.
For a UE that is registered over Non-3GPP access, a change of the point of
attachment (e.g. change of WLAN AP) shall not lead the UE to perform a
Registration procedure.
A UE shall not provide 3GPP-specific parameters (e.g. indicate a preference
for MICO mode) during registration over a non-3GPP access.
### 5.5.2 Connection Management
This clause applies to Non-3GPP access network corresponding to the Untrusted
Non-3GPP access network, to the Trusted Non-3GPP access network and to the
W-5GAN. The UE mentioned in this clause corresponds to the 5G-RG in the case
of W-5GAN and to the W-AGF in the case of FN-RG. In the case of N5CW devices
access 5GC via trusted WLAN access networks, the UE mentioned in this clause
corresponds to TWIF.
A UE that successfully establishes a Non-3GPP Access Connection to the 5GC
over a Non-3GPP access transitions to CM-CONNECTED state for the Non-3GPP
access.
In the case of Untrusted Non-3GPP access to 5GC, the Non-3GPP Access
Connection corresponds to an NWu connection.
In the case of Trusted access to 5GC, the Non-3GPP Access Connection
corresponds to an NWt connection.
In the case of N5CW devices access 5GC via trusted WLAN access networks, the
Non-3GPP Access Connection corresponds to an Yt\' connection.
In the case of Wireline access to 5GC, the Non-3GPP Access Connection
corresponds to a Y4 connection and to Y5 connection.
A UE does not establish multiple simultaneous Non-3GPP Access Connection to
the 5GC.
The Non-3GPP Access Connection is released either as a result of an Explicit
Deregistration procedure or an AN Release procedure.
In the case of Untrusted Non-3GPP access, Trusted Non-3GPP access and W-5GAN
access to 5GC, the N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF may in addition explicitly
release the NWu, NWt, Yt\', Y4 and Y5 signalling connection due to NWu, NWt,
Yt\', Y4 and Y5 connection failure, respectively. In the case of NWu and NWt,
the release may be determined by the \"dead peer detection\" mechanism in
IKEv2 defined in RFC 7296 [60]. In the case of Y4 and Y5 the release may be
detected for example by lost of synchronisation of physical link, lost of
PPPoE session, etc. Further details on how NWu, NWt, Yt\', Y4 and Y5
connection failure is detected is out of scope of 3GPP specifications.
For W-5GCAN, the W-AGF explicitly releases the N2 connection due to Y4 or Y5
connection failure, as determined by the \"dead peer detection\" mechanism in
DOCSIS MULPI [89].
The release of the Non-3GPP Access Connection between the UE and the N3IWF,
TNGF, TWIF or W-AGF shall be interpreted as follows:
\- By the N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF as a criterion to release the N2
connection.
\- By the UE as a criterion for the UE to transition to CM-IDLE. A UE
registered over non-3GPP access remains in RM-REGISTERED state, unless the
Non-3GPP Access Connection release occurs as part of a Deregistration
procedure over non-3GPP access in which case the UE enters the RM-DEREGISTERED
state. When the UE in RM-REGISTERED transitions to CM-IDLE, the UE non-3GPP
Deregistration timer starts running in the UE. The UE non-3GPP Deregistration
timer stops when the UE moves to CM-CONNECTED state or to the RM-DEREGISTERED
state.
NOTE 1: When moved to CM-IDLE state over one access, the UE can attempt to re-
activate UP connections for the PDU Sessions over other access, per UE
policies and depending on the availability of these accesses.
NOTE 2: The release of the NWu, NWt, Yt\', Y4 or Y5 at the UE can occur as a
result of explicit signalling from the N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF or W-AGF
respectively, e.g. IKE INFORMATION EXCHANGE in the case of NWu or as a result
of the UE detecting NWu, NWt, Yt\', Y4 or Y5 connection failure, e.g. as
determined by the \"dead peer detection\" mechanism in IKEv2 as defined in RFC
7296 [60] for NWu, NWt and Yt\' or W-5GAN access specific mechanism for Y4 and
Y5. Further details on how the UE detects NWu, NWt, Yt\', Y4 or Y5 connection
failure is out of scope of 3GPP specifications.
In the case of Non-3GPP access, when the AMF releases the N2 interface, the
N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF shall release all the resources associated with
the UE including the Non-3GPP Access Connection with the UE and its
corresponding N3 resources. A release of the N2 connection by the AMF shall
set the CM state for the UE in the AMF to CM-IDLE.
NOTE 3: It is assumed that a UE configured to receive services from a 5GC over
non-3GPP access that is RM-DEREGISTERED or CM-IDLE over the non-3GPP access
will attempt to establish Non-3GPP Access Connection and transition to CM-
CONNECTED state whenever the UE successfully connects to a non-3GPP access
unless prohibited by the network to make a N3GPP Access Connection (e.g. due
to network congestion).
An UE cannot be paged on Non-3GPP access network.
When a UE registered simultaneously over a 3GPP access and a non-3GPP access
moves all the PDU Sessions to one of the accesses, whether the UE initiates a
Deregistration procedure in the access that has no PDU Sessions is up to the
UE implementation.
Release of PDU Sessions over the non-3GPP access does not imply the release of
N2 connection.
When the UE has PDU Sessions routed over the non-3GPP access and the UE state
becomes CM-IDLE for the non-3GPP access, these PDU Sessions are not released
to enable the UE to move the PDU Sessions over the 3GPP access based on UE
policies. The core network maintains the PDU Sessions but deactivates the N3
user plane connection for such PDU Sessions.
### 5.5.3 UE Reachability
#### 5.5.3.1 UE reachability in CM-IDLE
This clause applies to Non-3GPP access network corresponding to the Untrusted
Non-3GPP access network, to the Trusted Non-3GPP access network and to the
W-5GAN. The UE mentioned in this clause corresponds to 5G-RG, in the case of
W-5GAN or to W-AGF in the case of support of FN-RG. In the case of N5CW
devices access 5GC via trusted WLAN access networks, the UE mentioned in this
clause corresponds to TWIF.
An UE cannot be paged over Non-3GPP access network.
If the UE states in the AMF are CM-IDLE and RM-REGISTERED for the non-3GPP
access, there may be PDU Sessions that were last routed over the non-3GPP
access and without user plane resources. If the AMF receives a message with a
Non-3GPP Access Type indication from an SMF for a PDU Session corresponding to
a UE that is CM-IDLE for non-3GPP access, and the UE is registered over 3GPP
access in the same PLMN as the one registered over non-3GPP access, a Network
Triggered Service Request may be performed over the 3GPP access independently
of whether the UE is CM-IDLE or CM-CONNECTED over the 3GPP access. In this
case, the AMF provides an indication that the procedure is related to non-3GPP
access, as specified in clause 5.6.8.
NOTE: The UE behaviour upon such network triggered Service Request is
specified in clause 5.6.8.
#### 5.5.3.2 UE reachability in CM-CONNECTED
This clause applies to Non-3GPP access network corresponding to the Untrusted
Non-3GPP access network, to the Trusted Non-3GPP access network and to the
W-5GAN. In the case of W-5GAN the UE mentioned in this clause corresponds to
5G-RG and to W-AGF in the case of support of FN-RG. In the case of N5CW
devices access 5GC via trusted WLAN access networks, the UE mentioned in this
clause corresponds to TWIF.
For a UE in CM-CONNECTED state:
\- the AMF knows the UE location on a N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF node
granularity.
\- the N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF releases the N2 connection when UE becomes
unreachable from N3IWF, TNGF, TWIF and W-AGF point of view, i.e. upon Non-3GPP
Access Connection release.
## 5.6 Session Management
### 5.6.1 Overview
The 5GC supports a PDU Connectivity Service i.e. a service that provides
exchange of PDUs between a UE and a data network identified by a DNN. The PDU
Connectivity Service is supported via PDU Sessions that are established upon
request from the UE.
The Subscription Information for each S-NSSAI may contain a Subscribed DNN
list and one default DNN. When the UE does not provide a DNN in a NAS Message
containing PDU Session Establishment Request for a given S-NSSAI, the serving
AMF determines the DNN for the requested PDU Session by selecting the default
DNN for this S-NSSAI if a default DNN is present in the UE\'s Subscription
Information; otherwise the serving AMF selects a locally configured DNN for
this S-NSSAI.
The expectation is that the URSP in the UE is always up to date using the
procedure defined in clause 4.16.12.2 of TS 23.502 [3] and therefore the UE
requested DNN will be up to date.
In order to cover cases that UE operates using local configuration, but also
other cases where operator policies can be used in order to replace an \"up to
date\" UE requested DNN with another DNN used only internally in the network,
during UE Registration procedure the PCF may indicate, to the AMF, the
operator policies to be used at PDU Session Establishment for DNN replacement
of a UE requested DNN. PCF may indicate a policy for DNN replacement of UE
requested DNNs not supported by the network, and/or indicate a list of UE
requested DNNs per S-NSSAI valid for the serving network, that are subject for
replacement (details are described in TS 23.503 [45]).
If the DNN provided by the UE is not supported by the network and AMF cannot
select an SMF by querying NRF, the AMF shall reject the NAS Message containing
PDU Session Establishment Request from the UE with a cause indicating that the
DNN is not supported unless the PCF provided the policy to perform a DNN
replacement of unsupported DNNs.
If the DNN requested by the UE is indicated for replacement or the DNN
provided by the UE is not supported by the network and the PCF provided the
policy to perform DNN replacement of UE requested DNNs not supported by the
network, the AMF shall interact with the PCF to perform a DNN replacement.
During PDU Session Establishment procedure and as a result of DNN replacement,
the PCF provides the selected DNN that is applicable for the S-NSSAI requested
by the UE at the PDU Session Establishment. The AMF uses the selected DNN in
the query towards the NRF for the SMF selection, as specified in clause 6.3.2,
and provides both requested and selected DNN to the selected SMF. For PDU
Session with Home-routed Roaming whether to perform DNN replacement is based
on operator agreements.
NOTE 1: The selected DNN is determined based on operator preferences and can
differ from subscribed DNNs. The matching of selected DNN to S-NSSAI is
assumed to be based on network configuration.
Each PDU Session supports a single PDU Session type i.e. supports the exchange
of a single type of PDU requested by the UE at the establishment of the PDU
Session. The following PDU Session types are defined: IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6,
Ethernet, Unstructured.
PDU Sessions are established (upon UE request), modified (upon UE and 5GC
request) and released (upon UE and 5GC request) using NAS SM signalling
exchanged over N1 between the UE and the SMF. Upon request from an Application
Server, the 5GC is able to trigger a specific application in the UE. When
receiving that trigger message, the UE shall pass it to the identified
application in the UE. The identified application in the UE may establish a
PDU Session to a specific DNN, see clause 4.4.5.
SMF may support PDU Sessions for LADN where the access to a DN is only
available in a specific LADN service area. This is further defined in clause
5.6.5.
SMF may support PDU Sessions for a 5G VN group which offers a virtual data
network capable of supporting 5G LAN-type service over the 5G system. This is
further defined in clause 5.8.2.13.
The SMF is responsible of checking whether the UE requests are compliant with
the user subscription. For this purpose, it retrieves and requests to receive
update notifications on SMF level subscription data from the UDM. Such data
may indicate per DNN and per S-NSSAI of the HPLMN:
\- The allowed PDU Session Types and the default PDU Session Type.
\- The allowed SSC modes and the default SSC mode.
\- QoS Information (refer to clause 5.7): the subscribed Session-AMBR, Default
5QI and Default ARP.
\- The IP Index information.
\- The static IP address/prefix.
\- The subscribed User Plane Security Policy.
\- the Charging Characteristics to be associated with the PDU Session. Whether
this information is provided by the UDM to a SMF in another PLMN (for PDU
Sessions in LBO mode) is defined by operator policies in the UDM/UDR.
NOTE 2: The content of the Charging Characteristics as well as the usage of
the Charging Characteristics by the SMF are defined in TS 32.255 [68].
A PDU Session may support:
(a) a single-access PDU Connectivity Service, in which case the PDU Session is
associated with a single access type at a given time, i.e. either 3GPP access
or non-3GPP access; or
(b) a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service, in which case the PDU Session is
simultaneously associated with both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access and
simultaneously associated with two independent N3/N9 tunnels between the PSA
and RAN/AN.
A PDU Session supporting a single-access PDU Connectivity Service is also
referred to as single-access PDU Session, while a PDU Session supporting a
multi-access PDU Connectivity Service is referred to as Multi-Access PDU (MA
PDU) Session and it is used to support the ATSSS feature (see clause 5.32 for
details).
A UE that is registered over multiple accesses chooses over which access to
establish a PDU Session. As defined in TS 23.503 [45], the HPLMN may send
policies to the UE to guide the UE selection of the access over which to
establish a PDU Session.
NOTE 3: In this Release of the specification, at any given time, a PDU Session
is routed over only a single access network, unless it is an MA PDU Session in
which case it can be routed over one 3GPP access network and one Non 3GPP
access network concurrently.
A UE may request to move a single-access PDU Session between 3GPP and Non 3GPP
accesses. The decision to move single-access PDU Sessions between 3GPP access
and Non 3GPP access is made on a per PDU Session basis, i.e. the UE may, at a
given time, have some PDU Sessions using 3GPP access while other PDU Sessions
are using Non 3GPP access.
If the UE is attempting to move a single-access PDU session from 3GPP access
to non-3GPP access and the PDU session is associated with control plane only
indication, then the AMF shall reject the PDU Session Establishment request as
related CIoT 5GS optimisation features are not supported over non-3GPP access
as described in clause 5.4.5.2.5 of TS 24.501 [47]. If the UE is attempting to
move a single-access PDU session from non-3GPP access to NB-N1 mode of 3GPP
access, the PDU Session Establishment request would also be rejected by AMF
when the UP resources for the UE exceed the maximum number of supported UP
resources as described in clause 5.4.5.2.4 of TS 24.501 [47].
In a PDU Session Establishment Request message sent to the network, the UE
shall provide a PDU Session ID. The PDU Session ID is unique per UE and is the
identifier used to uniquely identify one of a UE\'s PDU Sessions. The PDU
Session ID shall be stored in the UDM to support handover between 3GPP and
non-3GPP access when different PLMNs are used for the two accesses. The UE
also provides as described in TS 24.501 [47]:
(a) PDU Session Type.
(b) S-NSSAI of the HPLMN that matches the application (that is triggering the
PDU Session Request) within the NSSP in the URSP rules or within the UE Local
Configuration as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of TS 23.503 [45].
NOTE 4: If the UE cannot determine any S-NSSAI after performing the
association of the application to a PDU Session, then it does not indicate any
S-NSSAI in the PDU Session Establishment procedure as defined in clause
5.15.5.3.
(c) S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN from the Allowed NSSAI, corresponding to the
S-NSSAI of the HPLMN (b).
NOTE 5: In non-roaming scenario the mapping of the Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN
S-NSSAIs is not provided to the UE (because the S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN
(c) has the same value of the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN (b)), therefore the UE
provides in the PDU Session Request only the S-NSSAI of the Serving PLMN (c).
NOTE 6: In roaming scenarios the UE provides in the PDU Session Request both
the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN (b) and the S-NSSAI of the VPLMN from the Allowed
NSSAI (c) that maps to the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN.
(d) DNN (Data Network Name).
(e) SSC mode (Service and Session Continuity mode defined in clause 5.6.9.2).
Additionally, if the UE supports ATSSS and wants to activate a MA PDU Session,
the UE shall provide Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" and shall indicate the
supported ATSSS capabilities (see clause 5.32 for details).

Subscription Information may include a wildcard DNN per subscribed S-NSSAI:
when a wildcard DNN is associated with a subscribed S-NSSAI, the subscription
allows, for this S-NSSAI, the UE to establish a PDU Session using any DNN
value.
NOTE 7: The SMF is made aware whether the DNN of a PDU Session being
established corresponds to an explicitly subscribed DNN or corresponds to a
wildcard DNN. Thus, the SMF can reject a PDU Session establishment if the DNN
of the PDU Session is not part of explicitly subscribed DNN(s) and local
policies in the SMF require UE to have a subscription to this DNN.
A UE may establish multiple PDU Sessions, to the same data network or to
different data networks, via 3GPP and via and Non-3GPP access networks at the
same time.
A UE may establish multiple PDU Sessions to the same Data Network and served
by different UPF terminating N6.
A UE with multiple established PDU Sessions may be served by different SMF.
The SMF shall be registered and deregistered on a per PDU Session granularity
in the UDM.
The user plane paths of different PDU Sessions (to the same or to different
DNN) belonging to the same UE may be completely disjoint between the AN and
the UPF interfacing with the DN.
When the SMF cannot control the UPF terminating the N3 interface used by a PDU
Session and SSC mode 2/3 procedures are not applied to the PDU Session, an
I-SMF is inserted between the SMF and the AMF and handling of PDU Session(s)
is described in clause 5.34.
NOTE 8: User Plane resources for PDU Sessions of a UE, except for regulatory
prioritized service like Emergency Services and MPS, can be deactivated by the
SMF if the UE is only reachable for regulatory prioritized services.
The SMF serving a PDU session (i.e. Anchor) can be changed during lifetime of
the PDU session either within the same SMF set or, if the Context Transfer
Procedures as specified in clause 4.26 of TS 23.502 [3] are supported, between
SMFs in different SMF sets.
### 5.6.2 Interaction between AMF and SMF
The AMF and SMF are separate Network Functions.
N1 related interaction with SMF is as follows:
\- The single N1 termination point is located in AMF. The AMF forwards SM
related NAS information to the SMF based on the PDU Session ID in the NAS
message. Further SM NAS exchanges (e.g. SM NAS message responses) for N1 NAS
signalling received by the AMF over an access (e.g. 3GPP access or non-3GPP
access) are transported over the same access.
\- The serving PLMN ensures that subsequent SM NAS exchanges (e.g. SM NAS
message responses) for N1 NAS signalling received by the AMF over an access
(e.g. 3GPP access or non-3GPP access) are transported over the same access.
\- SMF handles the Session management part of NAS signalling exchanged with
the UE.
\- The UE shall only initiate PDU Session Establishment in RM-REGISTERED
state.
\- When a SMF has been selected to serve a specific PDU Session, AMF has to
ensure that all NAS signalling related with this PDU Session is handled by the
same SMF instance.
\- Upon successful PDU Session Establishment, the AMF and SMF stores the
Access Type that the PDU Session is associated.
N11 related interaction with SMF is as follows:
\- The AMF reports the reachability of the UE based on a subscription from the
SMF, including:
\- The UE location information with respect to the area of interest indicated
by the SMF.
\- The SMF indicates to AMF when a PDU Session has been released.
\- Upon successful PDU Session Establishment, AMF stores the identification of
serving SMF of UE and SMF stores the identification of serving AMF of UE
including the AMF set. When trying to reach the AMF serving the UE, the SMF
may need to apply the behaviour described for \"the other CP NFs\" in clause
5.21.
N2 related interaction with SMF is as follows:
\- Some N2 signalling (such as handover related signalling) may require the
action of both AMF and SMF. In such case, the AMF is responsible to ensure the
coordination between AMF and SMF. The AMF may forward the SM N2 signalling
towards the corresponding SMF based on the PDU Session ID in N2 signalling.
\- SMF shall provide PDU Session Type together with PDU Session ID to NG-RAN,
in order to facilitate NG-RAN to apply suitable header compression mechanism
to packet of different PDU type. Details refer to TS 38.413 [34].
N3 related interaction with SMF is as follows:
\- Selective activation and deactivation of UP connection of existing PDU
Session is defined in clause 5.6.8.
N4 related interaction with SMF is as follows:
\- When it is made aware by the UPF that some DL data has arrived for a UE
without downlink N3 tunnel information, the SMF interacts with the AMF to
initiate Network Triggered Service Request procedure. In this case, if the SMF
is aware that the UE is unreachable or if the UE is reachable only for
regulatory prioritized service and the PDU Session is not for regulatory
prioritized service, then the SMF shall not inform DL data notification to the
AMF
The AMF is responsible of selecting the SMF per procedures described in clause
6.3.2. For this purpose, it gets subscription data from the UDM that are
defined in that clause. Furthermore, it retrieves the subscribed UE-AMBR from
the UDM, and optionally dynamic serving network UE-AMBR from PCF based on
operator local policy, and sends to the (R)AN as defined in clause 5.7.2
AMF-SMF interactions to support LADN are defined in clause 5.6.5.
In order to support charging and to fulfil regulatory requirement (in order to
provide NPLI (Network Provided Location Information) as defined in TS 23.228
[15]) related with the set-up, modification and release of IMS Voice calls or
with SMS transfer the following applies
\- At the time of the PDU Session Establishment, the AMF provides the SMF with
the PEI of the UE if the PEI is available at the AMF.
\- When it forwards UL NAS or N2 signalling to a peer NF (e.g. to SMF or to
SMSF) or during the UP connection activation of a PDU Session, the AMF
provides any User Location Information it has received from the 5G-AN as well
as the Access Type (3GPP - Non 3GPP) of the AN over which it has received the
UL NAS or N2 signalling. The AMF also provides the corresponding UE Time Zone.
In addition, in order to fulfil regulatory requirement (i.e. providing Network
Provided Location Information (NPLI), as defined in TS 23.228 [15]) when the
access is non-3GPP, the AMF may also provide the last known 3GPP access User
Location Information with its age, if the UE is still attached to the same AMF
for 3GPP access (i.e. valid User Location Information).
The User Location Information, the access type and the UE Time Zone may be
further provided by SMF to PCF. The PCF may get this information from the SMF
in order to provide NPLI to applications (such as IMS) that have requested it.
The User Location Information may correspond to:
\- In the case of 3GPP access: TAI, Cell-Id. The AMF includes only the Primary
Cell-Id even if it had received also the Cell-Id of the Primary cell in the
Secondary RAN node from NG-RAN.
\- In the case of Untrusted non-3GPP access: TAI, the UE local IP address used
to reach the N3IWF and optionally the UDP source port number if NAT is
detected.
\- In the case of Trusted non-3GPP access: TAI, TNAP/TWAP Identifier, the
UE/N5CW device local IP address used to reach the TNGF/TWIF and optionally the
UDP source port number if NAT is detected.
When the UE uses WLAN based on IEEE 802.11 technology to reach the TNGF, the
TNAP Identifier shall include the SSID of the access point to which the UE is
attached. The TNAP Identifier shall include at least one of the following
elements, unless otherwise determined by the TWAN operator\'s policies:
\- the BSSID (see IEEE Std 802.11-2012 [106]);
\- civic address information of the TNAP to which the UE is attached.
The TWAP Identifier shall include the SSID of the access point to which the
NC5W is attached. The TWAP Identifier shall also include at least one of the
following elements, unless otherwise determined by the TWAN operator\'s
policies:
\- the BSSID (see IEEE Std 802.11-2012 [106]);
\- civic address information of the TWAP to which the UE is attached.
NOTE 1: The SSID can be the same for several TNAPs/TWAPs and SSID only cannot
provide a location, but it might be sufficient for charging.
NOTE 2: the BSSID associated with a TNAP/TWAP is assumed to be static.
\- In the case of W-5GAN access: The User Location Information for W-5GAN is
defined in TS 23.316 [84].
When the SMF receives a request to provide Access Network Information
reporting while there is no action to carry out towards the 5G-AN or the UE
(e.g. no QoS Flow to create / Update / modify), the SMF may request User
Location Information from the AMF.
The interaction between AMF and SMF(s) for the case of a I-SMF insertion,
relocation or removal for a PDU session is described in clause 5.34.
### 5.6.3 Roaming
In the case of roaming the 5GC supports following possible deployments
scenarios for a PDU Session:
\- \"Local Break Out\" (LBO) where the SMF and all UPF(s) involved by the PDU
Session are under control of the VPLMN.
\- \"Home Routed\" (HR) where the PDU Session is supported by a SMF function
under control of the HPLMN, by a SMF function under control of the VPLMN, by
at least one UPF under control of the HPLMN and by at least one UPF under
control of the VPLMN. In this case the SMF in HPLMN selects the UPF(s) in the
HPLMN and the SMF in VPLMN selects the UPF(s) in the VPLMN. This is further
described in clause 6.3.
NOTE 1: The use of an UPF in the VPLMN e.g. enables VPLMN charging, VPLMN LI
and minimizes the impact on the HPLMN of the UE mobility within the VPLMN
(e.g. for scenarios where SSC mode 1 applies).
Different simultaneous PDU Sessions of an UE may use different modes: Home
Routed and LBO. The HPLMN can control via subscription data per DNN and per
S-NSSAI whether a PDU Session is to be set-up in HR or in LBO mode.
In the case of PDU Sessions per Home Routed deployment:
\- NAS SM terminates in the SMF in VPLMN.
\- The SMF in VPLMN forwards to the SMF in the HPLMN SM related information.
\- The SMF in the HPLMN receives the SUPI of the UE from the SMF in the VPLMN
during the PDU Session Establishment procedure.
\- The SMF in HPLMN is responsible to check the UE request with regard to the
user subscription and to possibly reject the UE request in the case of
mismatch. The SMF in HPLMN obtains subscription data directly from the UDM.
\- The SMF in HPLMN may send QoS requirements associated with a PDU Session to
the SMF in VPLMN. This may happen during the PDU Session Establishment
procedure and after the PDU Session is established. The interface between SMF
in HPLMN and SMF in VPLMN is also able to carry (N9) User Plane forwarding
information exchanged between SMF in HPLMN and SMF in VPLMN. The SMF in the
VPLMN may check QoS requests from the SMF in HPLMN with respect to roaming
agreements.
In home routed roaming case, the AMF selects an SMF in the VPLMN and a SMF in
the HPLMN as described in clause 6.3.2 and in clause 4.3.2.2.3.3 of TS 23.502
[3], and provides the identifier of the selected SMF in the HPLMN to the
selected SMF in the VPLMN.
In roaming with LBO, the AMF selects a SMF in the VPLMN as described in clause
6.3.2 and in clause 4.3.2.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. In this case, when handling
a PDU Session Establishment Request message, the SMF in the VPLMN may reject
the N11 message (related with the PDU Session Establishment Request message)
with a proper N11 cause. This triggers the AMF to select both a new SMF in the
VPLMN and a SMF in the HPLMN in order to handle the PDU Session using home
routed roaming.
### 5.6.4 Single PDU Session with multiple PDU Session Anchors
#### 5.6.4.1 General
In order to support selective traffic routing to the DN or to support SSC mode
3 as defined in clause 5.6.9.2.3, the SMF may control the data path of a PDU
Session so that the PDU Session may simultaneously correspond to multiple N6
interfaces. The UPF that terminates each of these interfaces is said to
support PDU Session Anchor functionality. Each PDU Session Anchor supporting a
PDU Session provides a different access to the same DN. Further, the PDU
Session Anchor assigned at PDU Session Establishment is associated with the
SSC mode of the PDU Session and the additional PDU Session Anchor(s) assigned
within the same PDU Session e.g. for selective traffic routing to the DN are
independent of the SSC mode of the PDU Session. When a PCC rule including the
AF influenced Traffic Steering Enforcement Control information defined in
clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.503 [45] is provided to the SMF, the SMF can decide
whether to apply traffic routing (by using UL Classifier functionality or IPv6
multi-homing) based on DNAI(s) included in the PCC rule.
NOTE 1: AF influenced Traffic Steering Enforcement Control information can be
either determined by the PCF when requested by AF via NEF as described in
clause 5.6.7.1 or statically pre-configured in the PCF.
NOTE 2: Selective traffic routing to the DN supports, for example, deployments
where some selected traffic is forwarded on an N6 interface to the DN that is
\"close\" to the AN serving the UE.
This may correspond to
\- The Usage of UL Classifier functionality for a PDU Session defined in
clause 5.6.4.2.
\- The Usage of an IPv6 multi-homing for a PDU Session defined in clause
5.6.4.3.
SMF may also take decision to apply traffic routing (by using UL Classifier
functionality or IPv6 multi-homing) in EAS Discovery with EASDF procedure
described in TS 23.548 [130].
#### 5.6.4.2 Usage of an UL Classifier for a PDU Session
In the case of PDU Sessions of type IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 or Ethernet, the
SMF may decide to insert in the data path of a PDU Session an \"UL CL\"
(Uplink classifier). The UL CL is a functionality supported by an UPF that
aims at diverting (locally) some traffic matching traffic filters provided by
the SMF. The insertion and removal of an UL CL is decided by the SMF and
controlled by the SMF using generic N4 and UPF capabilities. The SMF may
decide to insert in the data path of a PDU Session a UPF supporting the UL CL
functionality during or after the PDU Session Establishment, or to remove from
the data path of a PDU Session a UPF supporting the UL CL functionality after
the PDU Session Establishment. The SMF may include more than one UPF
supporting the UL CL functionality in the data path of a PDU Session.
The UE is unaware of the traffic diversion by the UL CL, and does not involve
in both the insertion and the removal of UL CL. In the case of a PDU Session
of IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 type, the UE associates the PDU Session with either
a single IPv4 address or a single IPv6 Prefix or both of them allocated by the
network.
When an UL CL functionality has been inserted in the data path of a PDU
Session, there are multiple PDU Session Anchors for this PDU Session. These
PDU Session Anchors provide different access to the same DN. In the case of a
PDU Session of IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 type, only one IPv4 address and/or IPv6
prefix is provided to the UE. The SMF may be configured with local policies
for some (DNN, S-NSSAI) combinations to release the PDU Session when there is
a PSA associated with the IPv4 address allocated to the UE and this PSA has
been removed.
NOTE 0: The use of only one IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix with multiple PDU
Session Anchors assumes that when needed, appropriate mechanisms are in place
to correctly forward packets on the N6 reference point. The mechanisms for
packet forwarding on the N6 reference point between the PDU Session Anchor
providing local access and the DN are outside the scope of this specification.
The UL CL provides forwarding of UL traffic towards different PDU Session
Anchors and merge of DL traffic to the UE i.e. merging the traffic from the
different PDU Session Anchors on the link towards the UE. This is based on
traffic detection and traffic forwarding rules provided by the SMF.
The UL CL applies filtering rules (e.g. to examine the destination IP
address/Prefix of UL IP packets sent by the UE) and determines how the packet
should be routed. The UPF supporting an UL CL may also be controlled by the
SMF to support traffic measurement for charging, traffic replication for LI
and bit rate enforcement (Session-AMBR per PDU Session).
NOTE 1: When N9 forwarding tunnel exists between source ULCL and target ULCL,
the Session-AMBR per PDU Session can be enforced by the source UL CL UPF.
NOTE 2: The UPF supporting an UL CL may also support a PDU Session Anchor for
connectivity to the local access to the data network (including e.g. support
of tunnelling or NAT on N6). This is controlled by the SMF.
Additional UL CLs (and thus additional PDU Session Anchors) can be inserted in
the data path of a PDU Session to create new data paths for the same PDU
Session. The way to organize the data path of all UL CLs in a PDU Session is
up to operator configuration and SMF logic and there is only one UPF
supporting UL CL connecting to the (R)AN via N3 interface, except when session
continuity upon UL CL relocation is used.
The insertion of an ULCL in the data path of a PDU Session is depicted in
Figure 5.6.4.2-1.
Figure 5.6.4.2-1: User plane Architecture for the Uplink Classifier
NOTE 3: It is possible for a given UPF to support both the UL CL and the PDU
Session Anchor functionalities.
Due to UE mobility the network may need to relocate the UPF acting as UL CL
and establish a new PSA for local access to the DN. To support session
continuity during UL CL relocation the network may establish a temporary N9
forwarding tunnel between the source UL CL and target UL CL. The AF may
influence the creation of the N9 forwarding tunnel as described in clause
5.6.7.1.
The N9 forwarding tunnel is maintained until:
\- all active traffic flowing on it ceases to exist for:
\- a configurable period of time; or
\- a period of time indicated by the AF;
\- until the AF informs the SMF that it can release the source PSA providing
local access to the DN.
During the existence of the N9 forwarding tunnel the UPF acting as target UL
CL is configured with packet filters that:
\- force uplink traffic from existing data sessions between UE and the
application in the source local part of the DN (as defined in TS 23.548 [130])
into the N9 forwarding tunnel towards the source UL CL.
\- force any traffic related to the application in the target local part of
the DN to go to the new local part of the DN via the target PSA.
SMF may send a Late Notification to AF to inform it about the DNAI change as
described in clause 4.3.6.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. This notification can be used by
the AF e.g. to trigger mechanisms in the source local part of the DN to
redirect the ongoing traffic sessions towards an application in the target
local part of the DN. SMF can also send late notification to the target AF
instance if associated with this target local part of the DN.
The procedure for session continuity upon UL CL relocation is described in
clause 4.3.5.7 of TS 23.502 [3].
When an I-SMF is inserted for a PDU Session, the details of UL CL insertion
which is controlled by an I-SMF is described in clause 5.34.4.
#### 5.6.4.3 Usage of IPv6 multi-homing for a PDU Session
A PDU Session may be associated with multiple IPv6 prefixes. This is referred
to as multi-homed PDU Session. The multi-homed PDU Session provides access to
the Data Network via more than one PDU Session Anchor. The different user
plane paths leading to the different PDU Session Anchors branch out at a
\"common\" UPF referred to as a UPF supporting \"Branching Point\"
functionality. The Branching Point provides forwarding of UL traffic towards
the different PDU Session Anchors and merge of DL traffic to the UE i.e.
merging the traffic from the different PDU Session Anchors on the link towards
the UE.
The UPF supporting a Branching Point functionality may also be controlled by
the SMF to support traffic measurement for charging, traffic replication for
LI and bit rate enforcement (Session-AMBR per PDU Session). The insertion and
removal of a UPF supporting Branching Point is decided by the SMF and
controlled by the SMF using generic N4 and UPF capabilities. The SMF may
decide to insert in the data path of a PDU Session a UPF supporting the
Branching Point functionality during or after the PDU Session Establishment,
or to remove from the data path of a PDU Session a UPF supporting the
Branching Point functionality after the PDU Session Establishment.
Multi homing of a PDU Session applies only for PDU Sessions of IPv6 type. When
the UE requests a PDU Session of type \"IPv4v6\" or \"IPv6\" the UE also
provides an indication to the network whether it supports a Multi-homed IPv6
PDU Session.
The use of multiple IPv6 prefixes in a PDU Session is characterised by the
following:
\- The UPF supporting a Branching Point functionality is configured by the SMF
to spread UL traffic between the PDU Session Anchors based on the Source
Prefix of the PDU (which may be selected by the UE based on routing
information and preferences received from the network).
\- IETF RFC 4191 [8] is used to configure routing information and preferences
into the UE to influence the selection of the source Prefix.
NOTE 1: This corresponds to Scenario 1 defined in IETF RFC 7157 [7] \"IPv6
Multi-homing without Network Address Translation\". This allows to make the
Branching Point unaware of the routing tables in the Data Network and to keep
the first hop router function in the PDU Session Anchors.
\- The multi-homed PDU Session may be used to support make-before-break
service continuity to support SSC mode 3. This is illustrated in Figure
5.6.4.3-1.
\- The multi-homed PDU Session may also be used to support cases where UE
needs to access both a local service (e.g. local server) and a central service
(e.g. the internet), illustrated in Figure 5.6.4.3-2.
\- The UE shall use the method specified in clause 4.3.5.3 of TS 23.502 [3] to
determine if a multi-homed PDU Session is used to support the service
continuity case shown in Figure 5.6.4.3-1, or if it is used to support the
local access to DN case shown in Figure 5.6.4.3-2.
Figure 5.6.4.3-1: Multi-homed PDU Session: service continuity case
NOTE 2: It is possible for a given UPF to support both the Branching Point and
the PDU Session Anchor functionalities.
Figure 5.6.4.3-2: Multi-homed PDU Session: local access to same DN
NOTE 3: It is possible for a given UPF to support both the Branching Point and
the PDU Session Anchor functionalities.
### 5.6.5 Support for Local Area Data Network
The access to a DN via a PDU Session for a LADN is only available in a
specific LADN service area. A LADN service area is a set of Tracking Areas.
LADN is a service provided by the serving PLMN. It includes:
\- LADN service applies only to 3GPP accesses and does not apply in Home
Routed case.
\- The usage of LADN DNN requires an explicit subscription to this DNN or
subscription to a wildcard DNN.
\- Whether a DNN corresponds to a LADN service is an attribute of a DNN and is
per PLMN.
The UE is configured to know whether a DNN is a LADN DNN on a per-PLMN basis,
and an association between application and LADN DNN. The configured
association is considered to be a UE local configuration defined in TS 23.503
[45]. Alternatively, the UE gets the information whether a DNN is a LADN DNN
from LADN Information during (re‑)registration procedure as described in this
clause.
NOTE 1: No other procedure for configuring the UE to know whether a DNN is a
LADN DNN is defined in this release of the specifications.
NOTE 2: The procedure for configuring the UE to know an association between
application and LADN DNN is not defined in this release of the specifications.
LADN service area and LADN DNN are configured in the AMF on a per DN basis,
i.e. for different UEs accessing the same LADN, the configured LADN service
area is the same regardless of other factors (e.g. UE\'s Registration Area or
UE subscription).
NOTE 3: If a LADN is not available in any TA of an AMF\'s service area, the
AMF is not required to be configured with any LADN related information for
that DNN.
LADN Information (i.e. LADN Service Area Information and LADN DNN) is provided
by AMF to the UE during the Registration procedure or UE Configuration Update
procedure. For each LADN DNN configured in the AMF, the corresponding LADN
Service Area Information includes a set of Tracking Areas that belong to the
Registration Area that the AMF assigns to the UE (i.e. the intersection of the
LADN service area and the assigned Registration Area). The AMF shall not
create Registration Area based on the availability of LADNs.
NOTE 4: It is thus possible that the LADN Service Area Information sent by the
AMF to the UE contains only a sub-set of the full LADN service area as the
LADN service area can contain TA(s) outside of the registration area of the UE
or outside of the area served by the AMF.
When the UE performs a successful (re-)registration procedure, the AMF may
provide to the UE, based on local configuration (e.g. via OAM) about LADN, on
UE location, and on UE subscription information received from the UDM about
subscribed DNN(s), the LADN Information for the list of LADN available to the
UE in that Registration Area in the Registration Accept message.
The UE may provide either the LADN DNN(s) to retrieve the LADN Information for
the indicated LADN DNN(s) or an indication of Requesting LADN Information to
retrieve the LADN Information for all LADN(s) available in the current
Registration Area.
The list of LADN is determined as follows:
\- If neither LADN DNN nor an indication of requesting LADN Information is
provided in the Registration Request message, the list of LADN is the LADN
DNN(s) in subscribed DNN list except for wildcard DNN.
\- If the UE provides LADN DNN(s) in the Registration Request message, the
list of LADN is LADN DNN(s) the UE requested if the UE subscribed DNN(s)
includes the requested LADN DNN or if a wildcard DNN is included in the UE\'s
subscription data.
NOTE 5: It is assumed that an application can use only one LADN DNN at a time.
\- If the UE provides an indication of requesting LADN Information in the
Registration Request message, the list of LADN is all the LADN DNN(s)
configured in the AMF if the wildcard DNN is subscribed, or the LADN DNN(s)
which is in subscribed DNN list and no wildcard DNN is subscribed.
The UE considers the retrieved LADN Information valid only for the registered
PLMN and the E-PLMN(s) if the LADN Service Area Information includes Tracking
Areas that belong to E-PLMN(s). Additionally, an LADN DNN discovered by the UE
via the retrieved LADN Information is considered an LADN DNN also in the
E-PLMNs of the Registered PLMN, i.e. the UE can request LADN Information for
the discovered LADN DNN in the E-PLMNs.
During the subsequent Registration procedure, if the network does not provide
LADN Information for a DNN, the UE deletes any LADN Information for that DNN.
When the LADN Information for the UE in the 5GC is changed, the AMF shall
update LADN Information to the UE through UE Configuration Update/Registration
procedure as described in clauses 4.2.4 / 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
When receiving PDU Session Establishment with LADN DNN or Service Request for
the established PDU Session corresponding to LADN, the AMF determines UE
presence in LADN service area and forwards it to the SMF if the requested DNN
is configured at the AMF as a LADN DNN.
Based on the LADN Service Area Information in the UE, the UE determines
whether it is in or out of a LADN service area. If the UE does not have the
LADN Service Area Information for a LADN DNN, the UE shall consider it is out
of the LADN service area.
The UE takes actions as follows:
a) When the UE is out of a LADN service area, the UE:
\- shall not request to activate UP connection of a PDU Session for this LADN
DNN;
\- shall not establish/modify a PDU Session for this LADN DNN (except for PS
Data Off status change reporting for an established PDU Session);
\- need not release any existing PDU Session for this LADN DNN unless UE
receives explicit SM PDU Session Release Request message from the network.
b) When the UE is in a LADN service area, the UE:
\- may request a PDU Session Establishment/Modification for this LADN DNN;
\- may request to activate UP connection of the existing PDU Session for this
LADN DNN.
NOTE 6: The evaluation of Service Area Restrictions will be performed before
the evaluation of LADN service area, if the UE has overlapping areas between
Service Area Restrictions and LADN service area.
The SMF supporting a DNN is configured with information about whether this DNN
is a LADN DNN or not.
When receiving SM request corresponding an LADN from the AMF, the SMF
determines whether the UE is inside LADN service area based on the indication
(i.e. UE Presence in LADN service area) received from the AMF. If the SMF does
not receive the indication, the SMF considers that the UE is outside of the
LADN service area. The SMF shall reject the request if the UE is outside of
the LADN service area.
When the SMF receives a request for PDU Session Establishment with the LADN
DNN, it shall subscribe to \"UE mobility event notification\" for reporting UE
presence in Area of Interest by providing LADN DNN to the AMF as described in
clauses 5.6.11 and 5.3.4.4.
Based on the notification about the UE presence in LADN service area notified
by AMF (i.e. IN, OUT, or UNKNOWN), the SMF takes actions as follows based on
operator\'s policy:
a) When SMF is informed that the UE presence in a LADN service area is OUT,
the SMF shall:
\- release the PDU Session immediately; or
\- deactivate the user plane connection for the PDU Session with maintaining
the PDU Session and ensure the Data Notification is disabled and the SMF may
release the PDU Session if the SMF is not informed that the UE moves into the
LADN service area after a period.
b) When SMF is informed that the UE presence a LADN service area is IN, the
SMF shall:
\- ensure that Data Notification is enabled.
\- trigger the Network triggered Service Request procedure for a LADN PDU
Session to active the UP connection when the SMF receives downlink data or
Data Notification from UPF.
c) When the SMF is informed that the UE presence in a LADN service area is
UNKNOWN, the SMF may:
\- ensure that Data Notification is enabled.
\- trigger the Network triggered Service Request procedure for a LADN PDU
Session to active the UP connection when the SMF receives downlink data or
Data Notification from UPF.
SMF may make use of UE mobility analytics provided by NWDAF, as described in
clause 6.7.2 of TS 23.288 [86], to determine UE presence pattern in LADN
service area and take a decision how to handle LADN PDN Session (e.g. release
the PDU Session immediately, or deactivate the user plane connection for the
PDU Session with maintaining the PDU Session).
### 5.6.6 Secondary authentication/authorization by a DN-AAA server during the
establishment of a PDU Session
At PDU Session Establishment to a DN:
\- The **DN-specific identity** (TS 33.501 [29]) of a UE may be
authenticated/authorized by the DN.
NOTE 1: the DN-AAA server may belong to the 5GC or to the DN.
\- If the UE provides authentication/authorization information corresponding
to a DN-specific identity during the Establishment of the PDU Session, and the
SMF determines that Secondary authentication/authorization of the PDU Session
Establishment is required based on the SMF policy associated with the DN, the
SMF passes the authentication/authorization information of the UE to the DN-
AAA server via the UPF if the DN-AAA server is located in the DN. If the SMF
determines that Secondary authentication/authorization of the PDU Session
Establishment is required but the UE has not provided a DN-specific identity
as part of the PDU Session Establishment request, the SMF requests the UE to
indicate a DN-specific identity using EAP procedures as described in TS 33.501
[29]. If the Secondary authentication/authorization of the PDU Session
Establishment fails, the SMF rejects the PDU Session Establishment.
NOTE 2: If the DN-AAA server is located in the 5GC and reachable directly,
then the SMF may communicate with it directly without involving the UPF.
\- The DN-AAA server may authenticate/authorize the PDU Session Establishment.
\- When DN-AAA server authorizes the PDU Session Establishment, it may send DN
Authorization Data for the established PDU Session to the SMF. The DN
authorization data for the established PDU Session may include one or more of
the following:
\- A DN Authorization Profile Index which is a reference to authorization data
for policy and charging control locally configured in the SMF or PCF.
\- a list of allowed MAC addresses for the PDU Session; this shall apply only
for PDU Session of Ethernet PDU type and is further described in clause
5.6.10.2.
\- a list of allowed VLAN tags for the PDU Session; this shall apply only for
PDU Session of Ethernet PDU type and is further described in clause 5.6.10.2.
\- DN authorized Session AMBR for the PDU Session. The DN Authorized Session
AMBR for the PDU Session takes precedence over the subscribed Session-AMBR
received from the UDM.
\- Framed Route information (see clause 5.6.14) for the PDU Session.
\- L2TP information, such as LNS IP address and/or LNS host name, as described
in TS 29.561 [132].
SMF policies may require DN authorization without Secondary
authentication/authorization. In that case, when contacting the DN-AAA server
for authorization, the SMF provides the GPSI of the UE if available.
Such Secondary authentication/authorization takes place for the purpose of PDU
Session authorization in addition to:
\- The 5GC access authentication handled by AMF and described in clause 5.2.
\- The PDU Session authorization enforced by SMF with regards to subscription
data retrieved from UDM.
Based on local policies the SMF may initiate Secondary
authentication/authorization at PDU Session Establishment. The SMF provides
the GPSI, if available, in the signalling exchanged with the DN-AAA during
Secondary authentication/authorization.
After the successful Secondary authentication/authorization, a session is kept
between the SMF and the DN-AAA.
The UE provides the authentication/authorization information required to
support Secondary authentication/authorization by the DN over NAS SM.
If a UE is configured with DNNs, which are subject to secondary
authentication/authorization, the UE stores an association between the DNN and
corresponding credentials for the secondary authentication/authorization.
NOTE 3: How the UE is aware that a DNN is subject to secondary
authentication/authorization (e.g., based on local configuration) is out of
scope of this specification.
The UE may support remote provisioning of credentials for secondary
authentication/authorization, as specified in clause 5.39.
A UE that supports to be provisioned with the credentials used for secondary
authentication/authorization over UP remote provisioning shall use
connectivity over an S-NSSAI/DNN which can access the provisioning server to
establish a PDU session for remote provisioning as defined in clause 5.39.
NOTE 4: The credentials for secondary authentication/authorization are not
specified.
SMF policies or subscription information (such as defined in Table 5.2.3.3.1
of TS 23.502 [3]) may trigger the need for SMF to request the Secondary
authentication/authorization and/or UE IP address / Prefix from the DN-AAA
server.
When SMF adds a PDU Session Anchor (such as defined in clause 5.6.4) to a PDU
Session Secondary authentication/authorization is not carried out, but SMF
policies may require SMF to notify the DN when a new prefix or address has
been added to or removed from a PDU Session or N6 traffic routing information
has been changed for a PDU Session.
When SMF gets notified from UPF with the addition or removal of MAC addresses
to/from a PDU Session, the SMF policies may require SMF to notify the DN-AAA
server.
Indication of PDU Session Establishment rejection is transferred by SMF to the
UE via NAS SM.
If the DN-AAA sends DN Authorization Data for the authorized PDU Session to
the SMF and dynamic PCC is deployed, the SMF sends the PCF the DN authorized
Session AMBR and/or DN Authorization Profile Index in the DN Authorization
Data for the established PDU Session.
If the DN-AAA sends DN Authorization Profile Index in DN Authorization Data to
the SMF and dynamic PCC is not deployed, the SMF uses the DN Authorization
Profile Index to refer the locally configured information.
NOTE 5: DN Authorization Profile Index is assumed to be pre-negotiated between
the operator and the administrator of DN-AAA server.
If the DN-AAA does not send DN Authorization Data for the established PDU
Session, the SMF may use locally configured information.
At any time, a DN-AAA server may revoke the authorization for a PDU Session or
update DN Authorization Data for a PDU Session. According to the request from
DN-AAA server, the SMF may release or update the PDU Session. See clause
5.6.14 when the update involves Framed Route information.
At any time, a DN-AAA server or SMF may trigger Secondary Re-authentication
procedure for a PDU Session established with Secondary Authentication as
specified in clause 11.1.3 of TS 33.501 [29].
During Secondary Re-authentication/Re-authorization, if the SMF receives from
DN-AAA the DN authorized Session AMBR and/or DN Authorization Profile Index,
the SMF shall report the received value(s) to the PCF.
The procedure for secondary authentication/authorization by a DN-AAA server
during the establishment of a PDU Session is described in clause 4.3.2.3 of TS
23.502 [3].
The support for L2TP on N6 is further specified in clause 5.8.2.16, and the
procedure for establishment of L2TP tunnelling on N6 for a PDU Session is
described in clause 4.3.2.4 of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 6: The L2TP Tunnel information sent to the SMF can, for example, be
provisioned in the DN-AAA server per DNN/S-NSSAI or per SUPI or GPSI.
### 5.6.7 Application Function influence on traffic routing
#### 5.6.7.1 General
The content of this clause applies to non-roaming and to LBO deployments i.e.
to cases where the involved entities (AF, PCF, SMF, UPF) belong to the Serving
PLMN or AF belongs to a third party with which the Serving PLMN has an
agreement. AF influence on traffic routing does not apply in the case of Home
Routed deployments. PCF shall not apply AF requests to influence traffic
routing to PDU Sessions established in Home Routed mode.
An AF may send requests to influence SMF routeing decisions for traffic of PDU
Session. The AF requests may influence UPF (re)selection and (I-)SMF
(re)selection and allow routeing user traffic to a local access to a Data
Network (identified by a DNAI).
The AF may issue requests on behalf of applications not owned by the PLMN
serving the UE.
If the operator does not allow an AF to access the network directly, the AF
shall use the NEF to interact with the 5GC, as described in clause 6.2.10.
The AF may be in charge of the (re)selection or relocation of the applications
within the local part of the DN (as defined in TS 23.548 [130]). Such
functionality is not defined. For this purpose, the AF may request to get
notified about events related with PDU Sessions.
In the case of AF instance change, the AF may send request of AF relocation
information.
The AF requests are sent to the PCF via N5 (in the case of requests targeting
specific on-going PDU Sessions of individual UE(s), for an AF allowed to
interact directly with the 5GC NFs) or via the NEF. The AF requests that
target existing or future PDU Sessions of multiple UE(s) or of any UE are sent
via the NEF and may target multiple PCF(s), as described in clause 6.3.7.2.
The PCF(s) transform(s) the AF requests into policies that apply to PDU
Sessions. When the AF has subscribed to UP path management event notifications
from SMF(s) (including notifications on how to reach a GPSI over N6), such
notifications are sent either directly to the AF or via an NEF (without
involving the PCF). For AF interacting with PCF directly or via NEF, the AF
requests may contain the information as described in the Table 5.6.7-1:

For each information element mentioned above in the AF request, the detailed
description is as follows:
1) Information to identify the traffic. The traffic can be identified in the
AF request by
\- Either a DNN and possibly slicing information (S-NSSAI) or an AF-Service-
Identifier
\- When the AF provides an AF-Service-Identifier i.e. an identifier of the
service on behalf of which the AF is issuing the request, the 5G Core maps
this identifier into a target DNN and slicing information (S-NSSAI)
\- When the NEF processes the AF request the AF-Service-Identifier may be used
to authorize the AF request.
\- An application identifier or traffic filtering information (e.g. IP 5
Tuple). The application identifier refers to an application handling UP
traffic and is used by the UPF to detect the traffic of the application
When the AF request is for influencing SMF routing decisions, the information
is to identify the traffic to be routed.
When the AF request is for subscription to notifications about UP path
management events, the information is to identify the traffic that the events
relate to.
2) Information about the N6 traffic routing requirements for traffic
identified as defined in 1). This includes:
\- Information about the N6 traffic routing requirements that is provided per
DNAI: for each DNAI, the N6 traffic routing requirements may contain a routing
profile ID and/or N6 traffic routing information.
\- An optional indication of traffic correlation, when the information in 4)
identifies a group of UEs. This implies the targeted PDU Sessions should be
correlated by a common DNAI in the user plane for the traffic identified in
1). If this indication is provided by the AF, the 5GC should select a common
DNAI for the target PDU Sessions from the list of DNAI(s) specified in 3).
NOTE 1: The N6 traffic routing requirements are related to the mechanism
enabling traffic steering in the local access to the DN. The routing profile
ID refers to a pre-agreed policy between the AF and the 5GC. This policy may
refer to different steering policy ID(s) sent to SMF and e.g. based on time of
the day etc.
NOTE 2: The mechanisms enabling traffic steering in the local access to the DN
are not defined.
3) Potential locations of applications towards which the traffic routing
should apply. The potential location of application is expressed as a list of
DNAI(s). If the AF interacts with the PCF via the NEF, the NEF may map the AF-
Service-Identifier information to a list of DNAI(s). The DNAI(s) may be used
for UPF (re)selection and (I‑)SMF (re)selection.
4) Information on the UE(s). This may correspond to:
\- Individual UEs identified using GPSI, or an IP address/Prefix or a MAC
address.
\- Groups of UEs identified by an External Group Identifier as defined in TS
23.682 [36] when the AF interacts via the NEF, or Internal-Group Identifier
(see clause 5.9.7) when the AF interacts directly with the PCF.
\- Any UE accessing the combination of DNN, S-NSSAI and DNAI(s).
When the PDU Session type is IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6, and the AF provides an IP
address and/or an IP Prefix, or when the PDU Session type is Ethernet and the
AF provides a MAC address, this allows the PCF to identify the PDU Session for
which this request applies and the AF request applies only to that specific
PDU Session of the UE. In this case, additional information such as the UE
identity may also be provided to help the PCF to identify the correct PDU
Session.
Otherwise the request targets multiple UE(s) and shall apply to any existing
or future PDU Sessions that match the parameters in the AF request.
When the AF request targets an individual UE and GPSI is provided within the
AF request, the GPSI is mapped to SUPI according to the subscription
information received from UDM.
When the AF request targets any UE or a group of UE, the AF request is likely
to influence multiple PDU Sessions possibly served by multiple SMFs and PCFs.
When the AF request targets a group of UE it provides one or several group
identifiers in its request. The group identifiers provided by the AF are
mapped to Internal-Group identifiers. Members of the group have this Group
Identifier in their subscription. The Internal-Group Identifier is stored in
UDM, retrieved by SMF from UDM and passed by SMF to PCF at PDU Session set-up.
The PCF can then map the AF requests with user subscription and determine
whether an AF request targeting a Group of users applies to a PDU Session.
When the AF request is for influencing SMF routing decisions, the information
is to identify UE(s) whose traffic is to be routed.
When the AF request is for subscription to notifications about UP path
management events, the information is to identify UE(s) whose traffic the
events relate to.
When the AF request is for traffic forwarding in a PDU Session serving for
TSC, the MAC address used by the PDU Session is determined by the AF to
identify UE whose traffic is to be routed according to the previously stored
binding relationship of the 5GS Bridge and the port number of the traffic
forwarding information received from TSN network.
5) Indication of application relocation possibility. This indicates whether an
application can be relocated once a location of the application is selected by
the 5GC. If application relocation is not possible, the 5GC shall ensure that
for the traffic related with an application, no DNAI change takes place once
selected for this application.
6) Temporal validity condition. This is provided in the form of time
interval(s) or duration(s) during which the AF request is to be applied.
When the AF request is for influencing SMF routing decisions, the temporal
validity condition indicates when the traffic routing is to apply.
When the AF request is for subscription to notifications about UP path
management events, the temporal validity condition indicates when the
notifications are to be generated.
7) Spatial validity condition on the UE(s) location. This is provided in the
form of validity area(s). If the AF interacts with the PCF via the NEF, it may
provide geographical area (e.g. a civic address or shapes) and the NEF maps
the information to areas of validity based on pre-configuration. The PCF in
turn determines area(s) of interest based on validity area(s).
When the AF request is for influencing SMF routing decisions, the spatial
validity condition indicates that the request applies only to the traffic of
UE(s) located in the specified location.
When the AF request is for subscription to notifications about UP path
management events, the spatial validity condition indicates that the
subscription applies only to the traffic of UE(s) located in the specified
location.
8) Information on AF subscription to corresponding SMF events.
The AF may request to be subscribed to change of UP path associated with
traffic identified in the bullet 1) above. The AF request contains:
\- A type of subscription (subscription for Early and/or Late notifications).
The AF subscription can be for Early notifications and/or Late notifications.
In the case of a subscription for Early notifications, the SMF sends the
notifications before the (new) UP path is configured. In the case of a
subscription for Late notifications, the SMF sends the notification after the
(new) UP path has been configured.
\- Notification target address for receiving event notification.
\- Optionally, an indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\".
The indication implies that the AF will provide a response to the
notifications of UP path management events to the 5GC. The SMF may, according
to this indication, determine to wait for a response from the AF before the
SMF configures in the case of early notification, or activates in the case of
late notification, the new UP path as described in clause 5.6.7.2.
The AF subscription can also request to receive information associating the
GPSI of the UE with the IP address(es) of the UE and/or with actual N6 traffic
routing to be used to reach the UE on the PDU Session; in this case the
corresponding information is sent by the SMF regardless of whether a DNAI
applies to the PDU Session.
9) An AF transaction identifier referring to the AF request. This allows the
AF to update or remove the AF request and to identify corresponding UP path
management event notifications. The AF transaction identifier is generated by
the AF.
When the AF interacts with the PCF via the NEF, the NEF maps the AF
transaction identifier to an AF transaction internal identifier, which is
generated by the NEF and used within the 5GC to identify the information
associated to the AF request. The NEF maintains the mapping between the AF
transaction identifier and the AF transaction internal identifier. The
relation between the two identifiers is implementation specific.
When the AF interacts with the PCF directly, the AF transaction identifier
provided by the AF is used as AF transaction internal identifier within the
5GC.
10) Indication of UE IP address preservation. This indicates UE IP address
related to the traffic identified in bullet 1) should be preserved. If this
indication is provided by the AF, the 5GC should preserve the UE IP address by
preventing reselection of PSA UPF for the identified traffic once the PSA UPF
is selected.
11) Information for EAS IP Replacement in 5GC. This indicates the Source EAS
identifier and Target EAS identifier (i.e. IP addresses and port numbers of
the source and target EAS) for a service subject to Edge Computing.
12) User Plane Latency Requirement. This includes AF requirements for User
Plane latency. (see clause 6.3.6 of TS 23.548 [130]).
13) Information on AF change. The AF relocation information includes:
\- AF Identifier: the identifier of the target AF instance.
NOTE 3: The AF relocation information is applicable for interaction with NEF
only and it is not stored in UDR or transferred to PCF, even for the case AF
directly interacts with PCF.
14) Indication for EAS relocation. This indicates the application(s) are to be
relocated.
15) Indication for Simultaneous Connectivity over source and target PSA at
Edge Relocation (see clause 6.3.4 of TS 23.548 [130]). Indicates that source
and target PSA should coexist for some time at PSA relocation, and may
influence the establishment of a temporary N9 forwarding tunnel between the
source UL CL and target UL CL. It may also provide guidance for the time
interval after the described traffic ceases when the connectivity over the
source PSA may be removed.
An AF may send requests to influence SMF routeing decisions, for event
subscription or for both.
The AF may request to be subscribed to notifications about UP path management
events, i.e. a UP path change occurs for the PDU Session. The corresponding
notification about a UP path change sent by the SMF to the AF may indicate the
DNAI and /or the N6 traffic routing information that has changed as described
in clause 4.3.6.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. It may include the AF transaction internal
identifier, the type of notification (i.e. early notification or late
notification), the Identity of the source and/or target DNAI, the IP
address/prefix of the UE or the MAC address used by the UE, the GPSI and the
N6 traffic routing information related to the 5GC UP.
NOTE 4: The change from the UP path status where no DNAI applies to a status
where a DNAI applies indicates the activation of this AF request; the change
from the UP path status where a DNAI applies to a status where no DNAI applies
indicates the de-activation of this AF request.
In the case of IP PDU Session Type, the IP address/prefix of the UE together
with N6 traffic routing information indicates to the AF how to reach over the
User Plane the UE identified by its GPSI. N6 traffic routing information
indicates any tunnelling that may be used over N6. The nature of this
information depends on the deployment.
NOTE 5: N6 traffic routing information can e.g. correspond to the identifier
of a VPN or to explicit tunnelling information such as a tunnelling protocol
identifier together with a Tunnel identifier.
NOTE 6: In the case of Unstructured PDU Session type the nature of the N6
traffic routing information related to the 5GC UP is described in clause
5.6.10.3.
In the case of Ethernet PDU Session Type, the MAC address of the UE together
with N6 traffic routing information indicates to the AF how to reach over the
User Plane the UE identified by its GPSI. The UE MAC address (es) is reported
by the UPF as described in clause 5.8.2.12. The N6 traffic routing information
can be, e.g. a VLAN ID or the identifier of a VPN or a tunnel identifier at
the UPF.
When notifications about UP path management events are sent to the AF via the
NEF, if required, the NEF maps the UE identify information, e.g. SUPI, to the
GPSI and the AF transaction internal identifier to the AF transaction
identifier before sending the notifications to the AF.
The PCF, based on information received from the AF, operator\'s policy,
optionally service experience analytics per UP path received from NWDAF, etc.,
authorizes the request received from the AF and determines for each DNAI, a
traffic steering policy ID (derived from the routing profile ID provided by
the AF) and/or the N6 traffic routing information (as provided by the AF) to
be sent to the SMF as part of the PCC rules. The traffic steering policy IDs
are configured in the SMF or in the UPF. The traffic steering policy IDs are
related to the mechanism enabling traffic steering to the DN.
The DNAIs are related to the information considered by the SMF for UPF
selection and (I‑)SMF (re)selection, e.g. for diverting (locally) some traffic
matching traffic filters provided by the PCF.
The PCF acknowledges a request targeting an individual PDU Session to the AF
or to the NEF.
For PDU Session that corresponds to the AF request, the PCF provides the SMF
with a PCC rule that is generated based on the AF request, Local routing
indication from the PDU Session policy control subscription information and
taking into account UE location presence in area of interest (i.e. Presence
Reporting Area). The PCC rule contains the information to identify the
traffic, information about the DNAI(s) towards which the traffic routing
should apply and optionally, an indication of traffic correlation and/or an
indication of application relocation possibility and/or indication of UE IP
address preservation. The PCC rule also contains per DNAI a traffic steering
policy ID and/or N6 traffic routing information, if the N6 traffic routing
information is explicitly provided in the AF request. The PCF may also provide
in the PCC rule information to subscribe the AF (or the NEF) to SMF events (UP
path changes) corresponding to the AF request in which case it provides the
information on AF subscription to corresponding SMF events received in the AF
request. This is done by providing policies at PDU Session set-up or by
initiating a PDU Session Modification procedure. When initiating a PDU Session
set-up or PDU Session Modification procedure, the PCF considers the latest
known UE location to determine the PCC rules provided to the SMF. The PCF
evaluates the temporal validity condition of the AF request and informs the
SMF to activate or deactivate the corresponding PCC rules according to the
evaluation result. When policies specific to the PDU Session and policies
general to multiple PDU Sessions exist, the PCF gives precedence to the PDU
Session specific policies over the general policies. The PCF authorizes the AF
request of User Plane Latency Requirements. If the PCF determines that the
requirements can\'t be authorized, the PCF rejects the AF request.
The spatial validity condition is resolved at the PCF. In order to do that,
the PCF subscribes to the SMF to receive notifications about change of UE
location in an area of interest (i.e. Presence Reporting Area). The subscribed
area of interest may be the same as spatial validity condition, or may be a
subset of the spatial validity condition (e.g. a list of TAs) based on the
latest known UE location. When the SMF detects that UE entered the area of
interest subscribed by the PCF, the SMF notifies the PCF and the PCF provides
to the SMF the PCC rules described above by triggering a PDU Session
Modification. When the SMF becomes aware that the UE left the area subscribed
by the PCF, the SMF notifies the PCF and the PCF provides updated PCC rules by
triggering a PDU Session Modification. SMF notifications to the PCF about UE
location in or out of the subscribed area of interest are triggered by UE
location change notifications received from the AMF or by UE location
information received during a Service Request or Handover procedure.
When the PCC rules are activated, the SMF may, based on local policies, take
the information in the PCC rules and, optionally, the Service Experience
analytics and/or DN Performance analytics per UP path (including UPF and/or
DNAI and/or AS instance) as defined in clause 6.4.3 and clause 6.14.3,
respectively, of TS 23.288 [86] into account to:
\- (re)select UP paths (including DNAI(s)) for PDU Sessions. The SMF is
responsible for handling the mapping between the UE location (TAI / Cell-Id)
and DNAI(s) associated with UPF and applications and the selection of the
UPF(s) that serve a PDU Session. This is described in clause 6.3.3. If the PDU
Session is of IP type and if Indication of UE IP address preservation is
included in the PCC rules, the SMF should preserve the UE IP address, by not
reselecting the related PSA UPF once the PSA UPF is selected, for the traffic
identified in the PCC rule. If the user plane latency requirement is included
in the PCC rules, the SMF chooses the PSA UPF that satisfies the user plane
latency requirement. If the PCC rules are related to a 5G VN group served by
the SMF and if the PCC rule includes an indication of traffic correlation, the
SMF should select a common DNAI for the PDU Sessions of the 5G VN group, see
clause 5.29.
\- configure traffic steering at UPF, including activating mechanisms for
traffic multi-homing or enforcement of an UL Classifier (UL CL). Such
mechanisms are defined in clause 5.6.4. This may include that the SMF is
providing the UPF with packet handling instructions (i.e. PDRs and FARs) for
steering traffic to the local access to the DN. The packet handling
instructions are generated by the SMF using the traffic steering policy ID
and/or the N6 traffic routing information in the PCC rules corresponding to
the applied DNAI. In the case of UP path reselection, the SMF may configure
the source UPF to forward traffic to the UL CL/BP so that the traffic is
steered towards the target UPF.
\- if Information on AF subscription to corresponding SMF events has been
provided in the PCC rule, inform the AF of the (re)selection of the UP path
(UP path change). If the information includes an indication of \"AF
acknowledgment to be expected\", the SMF may decide to wait for a response
from the AF before it activates the new UP path, as described in clause
5.6.7.2.
When an I-SMF is inserted for a PDU Session, the I-SMF insertion, relocation
or removal to a PDU session shall be transparent (i.e. not aware) to the PCF
and to the AF. The processing of the AF influence on traffic routing is
described in clause 5.34 and detail procedure is described in clause 4.23.6 of
TS 23.502 [3].
#### 5.6.7.2 Enhancement of UP path management based on the coordination with
AFs
In order to avoid or minimize service interruption during PSA relocation for a
PDU session of SSC mode 3, or a PDU session with UL CL or branch point,
according to the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\" on AF
subscription to corresponding SMF events (DNAI change) in the PCC rules
received from the PCF and local configuration (e.g. DN-related policies) the
SMF may wait for a response from the AF after sending a notification (an early
notification or a late notification) to the AF. In the case of late
notification, based on the indication of \"AF acknowledgment to be expected\"
on AF subscription, the SMF may send the notification before activating the UP
path towards a new DNAI (possibly through a new PSA).
NOTE 1: Before the UP path toward the new DNAI is activated, application
traffic data (if any exists) is still routed toward the old DNAI.
The notification sent from the SMF to the AF indicates UP path management
events (DNAI change) as described in clause 5.6.7.1. The AF can confirm the
DNAI change indicated in the notification with the SMF by sending a positive
response to the notification to the SMF or reject the DNAI change by sending a
negative response.
NOTE 2: The AF can determine whether application relocation is needed
according to the notification of DNAI change. If not, the AF can send a
positive response to the SMF immediately; otherwise, the AF sends the positive
response after application relocation is completed or a negative response if
the AF determines that the application relocation cannot be completed on time
(e.g. due to temporary congestion). The AF decision and behaviours on
application relocation are not defined. However, the new DNAI may be
associated with a new AF. In such cases, the SMF and the old AF cancel earlier
subscribed UP path management event notifications, and the new AF subscribes
to receive UP path management event notifications from the SMF.
The AF can include N6 traffic routing information related to the target DNAI
in a positive response sent to the SMF. The SMF configures the N6 traffic
routing information from the AF response to the PSA on the UP path.
The AF can include the EAS relocation Indication to indicate the
application(s) to be relocated.
In the case of early notification, based on the indication of \"AF
acknowledgment to be expected\" on AF subscription, the SMF does not configure
the UP path towards the new DNAI until it receives a positive AF response as
specified in clause 4.3.6.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
In the case of late notification, based on the indication of \"AF
acknowledgment to be expected\" on AF subscription, the SMF does not activate
the UP path towards the new DNAI until it receives a positive AF response as
specified in clause 4.3.5 of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 3: After the UP path toward the new DNAI is activated, data is routed
toward the new DNAI.
If the SMF receives a negative response at any time, the SMF keeps using the
original DNAI and may cancel related PSA relocation or addition. The SMF may
perform DNAI reselection afterwards if needed.
The SMF can assume according to local policy a negative response if a response
is expected and but not received from the AF within a certain time window.
When Early/Late Notification happens, the SMF notifies AF about the target
DNAI and may indicate capability of supporting EAS IP replacement in 5GC.When
EAS relocation is performed, the AF sends an/a early/late notification
response to the SMF after the EAS relocation is completed, which may include
the Information for EAS IP Replacement in 5GC. The SMF may instruct the local
PSA with the EAS IP address replacement using \"Outer Header Creation\" as
defined in clause 5.8.2.11.6 and \"Outer Header Removal\" as defined in clause
5.8.2.11.3. If local PSA relocation is required, the SMF may request the
target local PSA to buffer uplink traffic as described in clause 6.3.5 of TS
23.548 [130].
### 5.6.8 Selective activation and deactivation of UP connection of existing
PDU Session
This clause applies to the case when a UE has established multiple PDU
Sessions. The activation of a UP connection of an existing PDU Session causes
the activation of its UE-CN User Plane connection (i.e. data radio bearer and
N3 tunnel).
For the UE in the CM-IDLE state in 3GPP access, either UE or Network-Triggered
Service Request procedure may support independent activation of UP connection
of existing PDU Session. For the UE in the CM-IDLE state in non-3GPP access,
UE-Triggered Service Request procedure allows the re-activation of UP
connection of existing PDU Sessions, and may support independent activation of
UP connection of existing PDU Session.
A UE in the CM-CONNECTED state invokes a Service Request (see clause 4.2.3.2
of TS 23.502 [3]) procedure to request the independent activation of the UP
connection of existing PDU Sessions.
Network Triggered re-activation of UP connection of existing PDU Sessions is
handled as follows:
\- If the UE CM state in the AMF is already CM-CONNECTED on the access (3GPP,
non-3GPP) associated to the PDU Session in the SMF, the network may re-
activate the UP connection of a PDU Session using a Network Initiated Service
Request procedure.
Otherwise:
\- If the UE is registered in both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses and the UE CM
state in the AMF is CM-IDLE in non-3GPP access, the UE can be paged or
notified through the 3GPP access for a PDU Session associated in the SMF (i.e.
last routed) to the non-3GPP access:
\- If the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE in 3GPP access, the paging message
may include the access type associated with the PDU Session in the SMF. The
UE, upon reception of the paging message containing an access type, shall
reply to the 5GC via the 3GPP access using the NAS Service Request message,
which shall contain the list of PDU Sessions associated with the received
access type and whose UP connections can be re-activated over 3GPP (i.e. the
list does not contain the PDU Sessions whose UP connections cannot be re-
activated on 3GPP based on UE policies and whether the S-NSSAIs of these PDU
Sessions are within the Allowed NSSAI for 3GPP access). If the PDU Session for
which the UE has been paged is in the list of the PDU Sessions provided in the
NAS Service Request and the paging was triggered by pending DL data, the 5GC
shall re-activate the PDU Session UP connection over 3GPP access. If the
paging was triggered by pending DL signalling, the Service Request succeeds
without re-activating the PDU session UP connection over the 3GPP access and
the pending DL signalling is delivered to the UE over the 3GPP access;
\- If the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-CONNECTED in 3GPP access, the
notification message shall include the non-3GPP Access Type. The UE, upon
reception of the notification message, shall reply to the 5GC via the 3GPP
access using the NAS Service Request message, which shall contain the List of
Allowed PDU Sessions that can be re-activated over 3GPP or an empty List of
Allowed PDU Sessions if no PDU Sessions are allowed to be re-activated over
3GPP access.
NOTE: A UE that is in a coverage of a non-3GPP access and has PDU Session(s)
that are associated in the UE (i.e. last routed) to non-3GPP access, is
assumed to attempt to connect to it without the need to be paged.
\- If the UE is registered in both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses served by the
same AMF and the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-IDLE in 3GPP access and is in
CM-CONNECTED in non 3GPP access, the UE can be notified through the non-3GPP
for a PDU Session associated in the SMF (i.e. last routed) to the 3GPP access.
The notification message shall include the 3GPP Access Type. Upon reception of
the notification message, when 3GPP access is available, the UE shall reply to
the 5GC via the 3GPP access using the NAS Service Request message.
In addition to the above, a PDU Session may be established as an always-on PDU
Session as described in clause 5.6.13.
The deactivation of the UP connection of an existing PDU Session causes the
corresponding data radio bearer and N3 tunnel to be deactivated. The UP
connection of different PDU Sessions can be deactivated independently when a
UE is in CM-CONNECTED state in 3GPP access or non-3GPP access. At the
deactivation of the UP of a PDU Session using a N9 tunnel whose end-point is
controlled by an I-SMF, the N9 tunnel is preserved. If a PDU Session is an
always-on PDU Session, the SMF should not deactivate a UP connection of this
PDU Session due to inactivity.
### 5.6.9 Session and Service Continuity
#### 5.6.9.1 General
The support for session and service continuity in 5G System architecture
enables to address the various continuity requirements of different
applications/services for the UE. The 5G System supports different session and
service continuity (SSC) modes defined in this clause. The SSC mode associated
with a PDU Session does not change during the lifetime of a PDU Session. The
following three modes are specified with further details provided in the next
clause:
\- With SSC mode 1, the network preserves the connectivity service provided to
the UE. For the case of PDU Session of IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 type, the IP
address is preserved.
\- With SSC mode 2, the network may release the connectivity service delivered
to the UE and release the corresponding PDU Session(s). For the case of IPv4
or IPv6 or IPv4v6 type, the release of the PDU Session induces the release of
IP address(es) that had been allocated to the UE.
\- With SSC mode 3, changes to the user plane can be visible to the UE, while
the network ensures that the UE suffers no loss of connectivity. A connection
through new PDU Session Anchor point is established before the previous
connection is terminated in order to allow for better service continuity. For
the case of IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 type, the IP address is not preserved in
this mode when the PDU Session Anchor changes.
NOTE: In this Release of the specification, the addition/removal procedure of
additional PDU Session Anchor in a PDU Session for local access to a DN is
independent from the SSC mode of the PDU Session.
#### 5.6.9.2 SSC mode
##### 5.6.9.2.1 SSC Mode 1
For a PDU Session of SSC mode 1, the UPF acting as PDU Session Anchor at the
establishment of the PDU Session is maintained regardless of the access
technology (e.g. Access Type and cells) a UE is successively using to access
the network.
In the case of a PDU Session of IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 type, IP continuity is
supported regardless of UE mobility events.
In this Release of the specification, when IPv6 multihoming or UL CL applies
to a PDU Session of in SSC mode 1, and the network allocates (based on local
policies) additional PDU Session Anchors to such a PDU Session, these
additional PDU Session Anchors may be released or allocated, and the UE does
not expect that the additional IPv6 prefix is maintained during the lifetime
of PDU Session.
SSC mode 1 may apply to any PDU Session type and to any access type.
A UE supporting PDU Connectivity shall support SSC mode 1.
##### 5.6.9.2.2 SSC Mode 2
If a PDU Session of SSC mode 2 has a single PDU Session Anchor, the network
may trigger the release of the PDU Session and instruct the UE to establish a
new PDU Session to the same data network immediately. The trigger condition
depends on operator policy e.g. request from Application Function, based on
load status, etc. At establishment of the new PDU Session, a new UPF acting as
PDU Session Anchor can be selected.
Otherwise, if a PDU Session of SSC mode 2 has multiple PDU Session Anchors
(i.e. in the case of multi-homed PDU Sessions or in the case that UL CL
applies to a PDU Session of SSC mode 2), the additional PDU Session Anchors
may be released or allocated.
SSC mode 2 may apply to any PDU Session type and to any access type.
SSC mode 2 is optional to be supported in the UE.
NOTE 1: Features depending on SSC mode 2 will not work with the lack of
support for SSC mode 2 in the UE.
NOTE 2: In UL CL mode, the UE is not involved in PDU Session Anchor re-
allocation, so that the existence of multiple PDU Session Anchors is not
visible to the UE.
##### 5.6.9.2.3 SSC Mode 3
For PDU Session of SSC mode 3, the network allows the establishment of UE
connectivity via a new PDU Session Anchor to the same data network before
connectivity between the UE and the previous PDU Session Anchor is released.
When trigger conditions apply, the network decides whether to select a PDU
Session Anchor UPF suitable for the UE\'s new conditions (e.g. point of
attachment to the network).
In this Release of specification, SSC mode 3 only applies to IP PDU Session
type and to any access type.
In the case of a PDU Session of IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 type, during the
procedure of change of PDU Session Anchor, the following applies:
a. For a PDU Session of IPv6 type, the new IP prefix anchored on the new PDU
Session Anchor may be allocated within the same PDU Session (relying on IPv6
multi-homing specified in clause 5.6.4.3), or
b. The new IP address and/or IP prefix may be allocated within a new PDU
Session that the UE is triggered to establish.
After the new IP address/prefix has been allocated, the old IP address/prefix
is maintained during some time indicated to the UE via NAS signalling (as
described in clause 4.3.5.2 of TS 23.502 [3]) or via Router Advertisement (as
described in clause 4.3.5.3 of TS 23.502 [3]) and then released.
If a PDU Session of SSC mode 3 has multiple PDU Session Anchors (i.e. in the
case of multi-homed PDU Sessions or in the case that UL CL applies to a PDU
Session of SSC mode 3), the additional PDU Session Anchors may be released or
allocated.
SSC mode 3 is optional to be supported in the UE.
NOTE: Features depending on SSC mode 3 will not work with the lack of support
for SSC mode 3 in the UE.
#### 5.6.9.3 SSC mode selection
SSC mode selection is done by the SMF based on the allowed SSC modes
-including the default SSC mode) in the user subscription as well as the PDU
Session type and if present, the SSC mode requested by the UE.
The operator may provision a SSC mode selection policy (SSCMSP) to the UE as
part of the URSP rule -see clause 6.6.2 of TS 23.503 [45]). The UE shall use
the SSCMSP to determine the type of session and service continuity mode
associated with an application or group of applications for the UE as
described in clause 6.6.2.3 of TS 23.503 [45]. If the UE does not have SSCMSP,
the UE can select a SSC mode based on UE Local Configuration as described in
TS 23.503 [45], if applicable. If the UE cannot select a SSC mode, the UE
requests the PDU Session without providing the SSC mode.
NOTE 1: The UE can use the SSC Mode Selection component of the URSP rule with
match-all traffic descriptor if there is no SSC mode in the UE local
configuration.
The SSC mode selection policy rules provided to the UE can be updated by the
operator by updating the URSP rule.
The SMF receives from the UDM the list of allowed SSC modes and the default
SSC mode per DNN per S-NSSAI as part of the subscription information.
If a UE provides an SSC mode when requesting a new PDU Session, the SMF
selects the SSC mode by either accepting the requested SSC mode or rejecting
the PDU Session Establishment Request message with the cause value and the SSC
mode(s) allowed to be used back to UE based on the PDU Session type,
subscription and/or local configuration. Based on that cause value and the SSC
mode(s) allowed to be used, the UE may re-attempt to request the establishment
of that PDU Session with the SSC mode allowed to be used or using another URSP
rule.
If a UE does not provide an SSC mode when requesting a new PDU Session, then
the SMF selects the default SSC mode for the data network listed in the
subscription or applies local configuration to select the SSC mode.
SSC mode 1 shall be assigned to the PDU Session when static IP address/prefix
is allocated to the PDU Session based on the static IP address/prefix
subscription for the DNN and S-NSSAI. The SMF shall inform the UE of the
selected SSC mode for a PDU Session.
The UE shall not request and the network shall not assign SSC mode 3 for the
PDU Session of Unstructured type or Ethernet type.
NOTE 2: To avoid issues for UEs not supporting all SSC modes, the operator
can, in the subscription data and local configuration, include at least SSC
mode 1 in the allowed SSC modes, and set default SSC mode to 1 (since all UEs
supporting PDU sessions are mandated to support SSC mode 1). Still the 5GC can
trigger PDU session release with a cause code indicating reactivation due to,
e.g. restoration or user plane path optimization purposes, though this may
cause interruption of the service.
### 5.6.10 Specific aspects of different PDU Session types
#### 5.6.10.1 Support of IP PDU Session type
The IP address allocation is defined in clause 5.8.1
The UE may acquire following configuration information from the SMF, during
the lifetime of a PDU Session:
\- Address(es) of P-CSCF(s);
\- Address(es) of DNS server(s).
\- If the UE indicates support of DNS with security as defined in TS 33.501
[29] to the network in PCO and the network wants to enforce the use of DNS
with security, the configuration information sent by the SMF via PCO may also
include the corresponding DNS server security information as specified in TS
24.501 [47] and TS 33.501 [29].
\- the GPSI of the UE.
The UE may acquire from the SMF, at PDU Session Establishment, the MTU that
the UE shall consider, see clause 5.6.10.4.
The UE may provide following information to the SMF during the lifetime of a
PDU Session:
\- an indication of the support of P-CSCF re-selection based on procedures
specified in TS 24.229 [62] (clauses B.2.2.1C and L.2.2.1C).
\- PS data off status of the UE.
NOTE 2: An operator can deploy NAT functionality in the network; the support
of NAT is not specified in this release of the specification.
#### 5.6.10.2 Support of Ethernet PDU Session type
For a PDU Session set up with the Ethernet PDU Session type, the SMF and the
UPF acting as PDU Session Anchor (PSA) can support specific behaviours related
with the fact the PDU Session carries Ethernet frames.
Depending on operator configuration related with the DNN, different
configurations for how Ethernet traffic is handled on N6 may apply, for
example:
\- Configurations with a 1-1 relationship between a PDU Session and a N6
interface possibly corresponding to a dedicated tunnel established over N6. In
this case the UPF acting as PSA transparently forwards Ethernet frames between
the PDU Session and its corresponding N6 interface, and it does not need to be
aware of MAC addresses used by the UE in order to route down-link traffic.
\- Configurations, where more than one PDU Session to the same DNN (e.g. for
more than one UE) corresponds to the same N6 interface. In this case the UPF
acting as PSA needs to be aware of MAC addresses used by the UE in the PDU
Session in order to map down-link Ethernet frames received over N6 to the
appropriate PDU Session. Forwarding behaviour of the UPF acting as PSA is
managed by SMF as specified in clause 5.8.2.5.
NOTE 1: The \"MAC addresses used by the UE\" correspond to any MAC address
used by the UE or any device locally connected to the UE and using the PDU
Session to communicate with the DN.
Based on operator configuration, the SMF may request the UPF acting as the PDU
Session Anchor to respond to ARP/IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation requests based on
local cache information, i.e. the mapping between the UE MAC address to the UE
IP address, and the DN where the PDU Session is connected to, or to redirect
the ARP traffic from the UPF to the SMF. Responding to ARP/IPv6 ND based on
local cache information applies to ARP/IPv6 ND received in both UL and DL
directions.
NOTE 2: Responding to ARP/ND from a local cache assumes the UE or the devices
behind the UE acquire their IP address via in-band mechanisms that the SMF/UPF
can detect and by this link the IP address to the MAC address.
NOTE 3: This mechanism is intended to avoid broadcasting or multicasting the
ARP/IPv6 ND to every UE.
Ethernet Preamble and Start of Frame delimiter are not sent over 5GS:
\- For UL traffic the UE strips the preamble and frame check sequence (FCS)
from the Ethernet frame.
\- For DL traffic the PDU Session Anchor strips the preamble and frame check
sequence (FCS) from the Ethernet frame.
Neither a MAC nor an IP address is allocated by the 5GC to the UE for a PDU
Session.
The PSA shall store the MAC addresses received from the UE, and associate
those with the appropriate PDU Session.
The SMF may receive a list of allowed VLAN tags from DN-AAA (for a maximum of
16 VLAN tags) or may be locally configured with allowed VLAN tags values. The
SMF may also be configured with instructions on VLAN handling (e.g. the VLAN
tag to be inserted or removed, S-TAG to be inserted or removed). Taking this
into account, the SMF determines the VLAN handling for the PDU Session, and
instructs the UPF to accept or discard the UE traffic based on the allowed
VLAN tags, as well as to handle VLAN tags (addition/removal) via PDR (Outer
header removal) and FAR (UPF applying Outer header creation of a Forwarding
policy). For example:
\- The UPF may insert (for uplink traffic) and remove (for downlink traffic) a
S-TAG on N6 or N19 or internal interface (\"5G VN internal\") for the traffic
from and to the UE.
\- The UPF may insert (for uplink traffic) and remove (for downlink traffic) a
VLAN tag on the N6 interface while there is no VLAN in the traffic to and from
the UE.
\- The UPF may discard any UE traffic that does not contain any allowed VLAN
tag when the UPF handles the UE uplink or downlink traffic.
NOTE 4: This can be used for traffic steering to N6-LAN but also for N6-based
traffic forwarding related with 5G-VN service described in clause 5.29.4
Apart from specific conditions related to the support of PDU sessions over
W-5GAN defined in TS 23.316 [84], the UPF shall not remove VLAN tags sent by
the UE and the UPF shall not insert VLAN tags for the traffic sent to the UE.
PDU(s) containing a VLAN tag shall be switched only within the same VLAN by a
PDU Session Anchor.
The UE may acquire from the SMF, at PDU Session Establishment, the MTU of the
Ethernet frames\' payload that the UE shall consider, see clause 5.6.10.4.
NOTE 5: The UE may operate in bridge mode with regard to a LAN it is
connecting to the 5GS, thus different MAC addresses may be used as source
address of different frames sent UL over a single PDU Session (and destination
MAC address of different frames sent DL over the same PDU Session).
NOTE 6: Entities on the LAN connected to the 5GS by the UE may have an IP
address allocated by the DN but the IP layer is considered as an application
layer which is not part of the Ethernet PDU Session.
NOTE 7: In this Release of the specification, only the UE connected to the 5GS
is authenticated, not the devices behind such UE.
NOTE 8: 5GS does not support the scenario where a MAC address or if VLAN
applies a (MAC address, VLAN) combination is used on more than one PDU Session
for the same DNN and S-NSSAI.
NOTE 9: This Release of the specification does not guarantee that the Ethernet
network remains loop-free. Deployments need to be verified on an individual
basis that loops in the Ethernet network are avoided.
NOTE 10: This Release of the specification does not guarantee that the
Ethernet network properly and quickly reacts to topology changes. Deployments
need to be verified on an individual basis how they react to topology changes.
Different Frames exchanged on a PDU Session of Ethernet type may be served
with different QoS over the 5GS. Thus, the SMF may provide to the UPF Ethernet
Packet Filter Set and forwarding rule(s) based on the Ethernet frame structure
and UE MAC address(es). The UPF detects and forwards Ethernet frames based on
the Ethernet Packet Filter Set and forwarding rule(s) received from the SMF.
This is further defined in clauses 5.7 and 5.8.2.
When a PDU Session of Ethernet PDU type is authorized by a DN as described in
clause 5.6.6, the DN-AAA server may, as part of authorization data, provide
the SMF with a list of allowed MAC addresses for this PDU Session; the list is
limited to a maximum of 16 MAC addresses. When the list has been provided for
a PDU Session, the SMF sets corresponding filtering rules in the UPF(s) acting
as PDU Session Anchor for the PDU Session. The UPF discards any UL traffic
that does not contain one of these MAC addresses as a source address if the
list of allowed MAC addresses is provided.
In this Release of specification, the PDU Session of Ethernet PDU Session type
is restricted to SSC mode 1 and SSC mode 2.
For a PDU Session established with the Ethernet PDU Session type, the SMF may,
upon PCF request, need to ensure reporting to the PCF of all Ethernet MAC
addresses used as UE address in a PDU Session. In this case, as defined in
clause 5.8.2.12, the SMF controls the UPF to report the different MAC
addresses used as source address of frames sent UL by the UE in the PDU
Session.
NOTE 11: This relates to whether AF control on a per MAC address is allowed on
the PDU Session as defined in clause 6.1.1.2 of TS 23.503 [45].
The PCF may activate or deactivate the reporting of the UE MAC address using
the \"UE MAC address change\" Policy Control Request Trigger as defined in
Table 6.1.3.5-1 of TS 23.503 [45].
The SMF may relocate the UPF acting as the PDU Session Anchor for an Ethernet
PDU Session as defined in clause 4.3.5.8 of TS 23.502 [3]. The relocation may
be triggered by a mobility event such as a handover, or may be triggered
independent of UE mobility, e.g. due to load balancing reasons. In order to
relocate the PSA UPF, the reporting of the UE MAC addresses needs to be
activated by the SMF.
#### 5.6.10.3 Support of Unstructured PDU Session type
Different Point-to-Point (PtP) tunnelling techniques may be used to deliver
Unstructured PDU Session type data to the destination (e.g. application
server) in the Data Network via N6.
Point-to-point tunnelling based on UDP/IP encapsulation as described below may
be used. Other techniques may be supported. Regardless of addressing scheme
used from the UPF to the DN, the UPF shall be able to map the address used
between the UPF and the DN to the PDU Session.
When Point-to-Point tunnelling based on UDP/IPv6 is used, the following
considerations apply:
\- IPv6 prefix allocation for PDU Sessions are performed locally by the
(H-)SMF without involving the UE.
\- The UPF(s) acts as a transparent forwarding node for the payload between
the UE and the destination in the DN.
\- For uplink, the UPF forwards the received Unstructured PDU Session type
data to the destination in the data network over the N6 PtP tunnel using
UDP/IPv6 encapsulation.
\- For downlink, the destination in the data network sends the Unstructured
PDU Session type data using UDP/IPv6 encapsulation with the IPv6 address of
the PDU Session and the 3GPP defined UDP port for Unstructured PDU Session
type data. The UPF acting as PDU Session Anchor decapsulates the received data
(i.e. removes the UDP/IPv6 headers) and forwards the data identified by the
IPv6 prefix of the PDU Session for delivery to the UE.
\- The (H-)SMF performs the IPv6 related operations but the IPv6 prefix is not
provided to the UE, i.e. Router Advertisements and DHCPv6 are not performed.
The SMF assigns an IPv6 Interface Identifier for the PDU Session. The
allocated IPv6 prefix identifies the PDU Session of the UE.
\- For AF influence on traffic routing (described in clause 5.6.7), when the
N6 PtP tunnelling is used over the DNAI and the AF provides, by value,
information about N6 traffic routing requirements in the AF request, the AF
provides N6 PtP tunnelling requirements (IPv6 address and UDP port of the
tunnel end in the DN) as the N6 traffic routing information associated to the
DNAI; when the SMF notifies the AF of UP path management events, it includes
the N6 PtP tunnel information related to the UP (the IPv6 address and the 3GPP
defined UDP port of the tunnel end at the UPF) as N6 traffic routing
information in the notification.
In this Release of the specification there is support for maximum one 5G QoS
Flow per PDU Session of Type Unstructured.
In this Release of specification, the PDU Session of Unstructured PDU Session
type is restricted to SSC mode 1 and SSC mode 2.
The UE may acquire from the SMF, at PDU Session Establishment, the MTU that
the UE shall consider, see clause 5.6.10.4.
#### 5.6.10.4 Maximum Transfer Unit size considerations
In order to avoid data packet fragmentation between the UE and the UPF acting
as PSA, the link MTU size in the UE should be set to the value provided by the
network as part of the IP configuration. The link MTU size for IPv4 is sent to
the UE by including it in the PCO (see TS 24.501 [47]). The link MTU size for
IPv6 is sent to the UE by including it in the IPv6 Router Advertisement
message (see RFC 4861 [54]).
NOTE 1: Ideally the network configuration ensures that for PDU Session type
IPv4v6 the link MTU values provided to the UE via PCO and in the IPv6 Router
Advertisement message are the same. In cases where this condition cannot be
met, the MTU size selected by the UE is unspecified.
When using a PDU Session type Unstructured, the maximum uplink packet size,
and when using Ethernet, the Ethernet frames\' payload, that the UE should use
may be provided by the network as a part of the session management
configuration by encoding it within the PCO (see TS 24.501 [47]).
When using a PDU Session type Unstructured, to provide a consistent
environment for application developers, the network shall use a maximum packet
size of at least 128 octets (this applies to both uplink and downlink).
When the MT and the TE are separated, the TE may either be pre-configured to
use a specific default MTU size or the TE may use an MTU size provided by the
network via the MT. Thus, it is not always possible to set the MTU value by
means of information provided by the network.
NOTE 2: In network deployments that have MTU size of 1500 octets in the
transport network, providing a link MTU value of 1358 octets (as shown in
Figure J-1) to the UE as part of the IP configuration information from the
network will prevent the IP layer fragmentation within the transport network
between the UE and the UPF. For network deployments that uniformly support
transport with larger MTU size than 1500 octets (for example with ethernet
jumbo frames of MTU size up to 9216 octets), providing a link MTU value of MTU
minus 142 octets to the UE as part of the IP configuration information from
the network will prevent the IP layer fragmentation within the transport
network between the UE and the UPF. Link MTU considerations are discussed
further in Annex J.
NOTE 3: As the link MTU value is provided as a part of the session management
configuration information, a link MTU value can be provided during each PDU
Session establishment. In this release, dynamic adjustment of link MTU for
scenarios where MTU is not uniform across transport are not addressed.
### 5.6.11 UE presence in Area of Interest reporting usage by SMF
When a PDU Session is established or modified, or when the user plane path has
been changed (e.g. UPF re-allocation/addition/removal), SMF may determine an
Area of Interest, e.g. based on UPF Service Area, subscription by PCF for
reporting UE presence in Presence Reporting Area, etc.
For 3GPP access, the Area of Interest corresponds:
\- either to Presence Information that may correspond to:
\- a list of Tracking Areas; or
\- a list of Presence Reporting Area ID(s) and optionally the elements
comprising TAs and/or NG-RAN nodes and/or cells identifiers corresponding to
the PRA ID(s); or
\- a LADN DNN.
For Non-3GPP access, the Area of Interest corresponds to:
\- N3GPP TAI (see clause 5.3.2.3).
For UE location change into or out of an \"area of interest\", the SMF
subscribes to \"UE mobility event notification\" service provided by AMF for
reporting of UE presence in Area of Interest as described in clause 5.3.4.4.
The AMF may send the UE location to the SMF along with the notification, e.g.
for UPF selection. Upon reception of a notification from AMF, the SMF
determines how to deal with the PDU Session, e.g. reallocate UPF.
In the case of LADN, the SMF provides the LADN DNN to the AMF to subscribe to
\"UE mobility event notification\" for reporting UE presence in LADN service
area. Upon reception of a notification from the AMF, the SMF determines how to
deal with the PDU Session as described in clause 5.6.5.
For use cases related to policy control and charging decisions, the PCF may
subscribe to event reporting from the SMF or the AMF, for UE presence in a
Presence Reporting Area.
A Presence Reporting Area can be:
\- A \"UE-dedicated Presence Reporting Area\", defined in the subscriber
profile and composed of a short list of TAs and/or NG-RAN nodes and/or cells
identifiers in a PLMN; or derived from the Area of Interest provided by the
Application Function to the PCF (see clause 5.6.7) and composed of a short
list of TAs and/or NG-RAN nodes and/or cells identifiers in a PLMN; or
\- A \"Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Area\", predefined in the
AMF and composed of a short list of TAs and/or NG-RAN nodes and/or cells
identifiers in a PLMN.
In the case of Change of UE Presence in Presence Reporting Area, for core
network predefined Presence Reporting Area, the AMF determines the \"area of
interest\" corresponding to the Presence Reporting Area Identifier(s),
provided by the PCF or the SMF, as a list of TAIs and/or cell identifiers
and/or NG-RAN node identifiers based on local configuration. For UE-dedicated
Presence Reporting Areas, the subscription for UE location change notification
for an \"area of interest\" shall contain the PRA Identifier(s) and the
list(s) of TAs, or NG-RAN Node identifier and/or cell identifiers composing
the Presence Reporting Area(s). For Core Network predefined Presence Reporting
Areas, the subscription for UE location change notification for an \"area of
interest\" shall contain the PRA identifier(s).
NOTE 1: If the Presence Reporting Area (PRA) and RAN Notification Area (RNA)
are partially overlapping, the PCF will not get notified for the change of PRA
when UE enters or leaves the PRA but remains in the RNA in CM-CONNECTED with
RRC Inactive state, because AMF is not informed.
Each Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Area can be configured with a
priority level in the AMF. In order to prevent overload, the AMF may set the
reporting for one or more of the received Presence Reporting Area(s) to
inactive under consideration of the priority configured for each of Core
Network predefined Presence Reporting Area(s), while storing the reporting
request for this Presence Reporting Area in the UE context.
NOTE 2: Change of UE presence in Presence Reporting Area reporting does not
apply to home routed roaming.
The AMF may be configured with a PRA identifier which refers to a Set of Core
Network predefined Presence Reporting Areas. If the PCF subscribes to change
of UE location for an area of interest for a Set of Presence reporting areas
and provides a PRA identifier then the SMF may subscribe for event reporting
for this Set of Presence Reporting Areas by only indicating this PRA
Identifier in the area of interest. When the Presence Reporting Area(s) to be
reported belong to a set of Core Network predefined Presence Reporting Areas
in which the AMF is requested to report on change of UE presence, the AMF
shall additionally add to the report the PRA Identifier of the Set of Core
Network predefined Presence Reporting Areas.
Upon change of AMF, the PRA identifier(s) and if provided, the list(s) of
Presence Reporting Area elements are transferred for all PDU sessions as part
of MM Context information to the target AMF during the mobility procedure. If
one or more Presence Reporting Area(s) was set to inactive, the target AMF may
decide to reactivate one or more of the inactive Presence Reporting Area(s).
The target AMF indicates per PDU session to the corresponding SMF/PCF the PRA
identifier(s) and whether the UE is inside or outside the Presence Reporting
Area(s) as well as the inactive Presence Reporting Area(s), if any.
NOTE 3: The target AMF cannot set the Presence Reporting Area(s) received from
the source serving node to inactive.
The subscription may be maintained during the life of PDU Session, regardless
of the UP activation state of PDU Session (i.e. whether UP connection of the
PDU Session is activated or not).
SMF may determine a new area of interest, and send a new subscription to the
AMF with the new area of interest.
SMF un-subscribes to \"UE mobility event notification\" service when PDU
Session is released.
### 5.6.12 Use of Network Instance
The SMF may provide a Network Instance to the UPF in FAR and/or PDR via N4
Session Establishment or N4 Modification procedures.
NOTE 1: a Network Instance can be defined e.g. to separate IP domains, e.g.
when a UPF is connected to 5G-ANs in different IP domains, overlapping UE IP
addresses assigned by multiple Data Networks, transport network isolation in
the same PLMN, etc.
NOTE 2: As the SMF can provide over N2 the Network Instance it has selected
for the N3 CN Tunnel Info, the 5G AN does not need to provide Network Instance
to the 5GC.
The SMF determines the Network Instance based on local configuration.
The SMF may determine the Network Instance for N3 and N9 interfaces, taking
into account e.g. UE location, registered PLMN ID of UE, S-NSSAI of the PDU
Session.
The SMF may determine the Network Instance for N6 interface taking into
account e.g. (DNN, S-NSSAI) of the PDU Session.
The SMF may determine the Network Instance for N19 interface taking into
account e.g. the (DNN, S-NSSAI) identifying a 5G VN group.
NOTE 3: As an example, the UPF can use the Network Instance included in the
FAR, together with other information such as Outer header creation (IP address
part) and Destination interface in the FAR, to determine the interface in UPF
(e.g. VPN or Layer 2 technology) for forwarding of the traffic.
### 5.6.13 Always-on PDU session
An always-on PDU Session is a PDU Session for which User Plane resources have
to be activated during every transition from CM-IDLE mode to CM-CONNECTED
state.
Based on an indication from upper layers, a UE may request to establish a PDU
Session as an always-on PDU Session. The SMF decides whether the PDU Session
can be established as an always-on PDU Session. In Home Routed roaming case,
based on local policies, the V-SMF shall be involved to determine whether the
PDU Session can be established as an always-on PDU Session.
If the UE requests the 5GC to modify a PDU Session, which was established in
EPS, to an always-on PDU Session after the first inter-system change from EPS
to 5GS, the SMF decides whether the PDU Session can be established as an
always-on PDU Session based on the procedure described above.
The UE shall request activation of User Plane resources for always-on PDU
Sessions even if there are no pending uplink data for this PDU Session or when
the Service Request is triggered for signalling only or when the Service
Request is triggered for paging response only.
If the UE has one or more established PDU Sessions which are not accepted by
the network as always-on PDU Sessions and the UE has no uplink user data
pending to be sent for those PDU Sessions, the UE shall not request for
activating User Plane resources for those PDU sessions.
### 5.6.14 Support of Framed Routing
Framed Routing is only defined for PDU Sessions of the IP type (IPv4, IPv6,
IPv4v6) and allows to support an IP network behind a UE, such that a range of
IPv4 addresses or IPv6 prefixes is reachable over a single PDU Session, e.g.
for enterprise connectivity. Framed Routes are IP routes behind the UE.
A PDU Session may be associated with multiple Framed Routes. Each Framed Route
refers to a range of IPv4 addresses (i.e. an IPv4 address and an IPv4 address
mask) or a range of IPv6 Prefixes (i.e. an IPv6 Prefix and an IPv6 Prefix
length). The set of one or more Framed Routes associated to a PDU Session is
contained in the Framed Route information. The network does not send Framed
Route information to the UE: devices in the network(s) behind the UE get their
IP address by mechanisms out of the scope of 3GPP specifications. See RFC 2865
[73], RFC 3162 [74].
Framed Route information is provided by the SMF to the UPF (acting as PSA) as
part of Packet Detection Rule (PDR, see clause 5.8.2.11.3) related with the
network side (N6) of the UPF.
NOTE: SMF can take the UPF capabilities into account when selecting PSA UPF,
to ensure that the SMF chooses PSA UPF(s) that support Framed Routing for PDU
Sessions to DNN and/or slices deemed to support Framed Routing e.g. DNN and/or
slices intended to support RG or if Framed Route information has been received
as part of Session Management Subscription data.
The Framed Route information may be provided to the SMF by:
\- the DN-AAA server as part of PDU Session Establishment
authentication/authorization by a DN-AAA server (as defined in clause 5.6.6);
or by
\- Session Management Subscription data associated with DNN and S-NSSAI sent
by UDM (as defined in clause 5.2.3.3.1 of TS 23.502 [3]).
If the SMF receives Framed Route information both from DN-AAA and from UDM,
the information received from DN-AAA takes precedence and supersedes the
information received from UDM.
The IPv4 address / IPv6 Prefix allocated to the UE as part of the PDU Session
establishment (e.g. delivered in NAS PDU Session Establishment Accept) may
belong to one of the Framed Routes associated with the PDU Session or may be
dynamically allocated outside of such Framed Routes.
If PCC applies to the PDU Session, at PDU Session establishment the SMF
reports to the PCF the Framed Route information corresponding to the PDU
Session (as described in clause 6.1.3.5 of TS 23.503 [45]). In this case, in
order to support session binding, the PCF may further report to the BSF the
Framed Route information corresponding to the PDU Session (as described in
clause 6.1.2.2 of TS 23.503 [45]).
If the UDM or DN-AAA updates the Framed Route information during the lifetime
of the PDU Session, the SMF releases the PDU Session and may include in the
release request an indication for the UE to re-establish the PDU Session.
### 5.6.15 Triggers for network analytics
Triggers for the SMF to request for or subscribe to the analytics information
from the NWDAF are internal logic may include for example:
\- UE PDU Session related event subscription by other NFs (e.g. AMF, NEF);
\- UE access and mobility event reports from the AMF;
\- locally detected events;
\- analytics information received.
The trigger conditions may depend on operator and implementation policy in the
SMF. When a trigger condition happens, the SMF may decide if any analytics
information is needed and if so, request for or subscription to the analytics
information from the NWDAF.
The SMF may, upon detection of certain local events, e.g. number of PDU
sessions establishment or released reaches a threshold in a specific area,
request for or subscribe to network analytics related to \"Abnormal
behaviour\" as described in TS 23.288 [86] to detect whether there are any
exceptional UE behaviours in this area.
## 5.7 QoS model
### 5.7.1 General Overview
#### 5.7.1.1 QoS Flow
The 5G QoS model is based on QoS Flows. The 5G QoS model supports both QoS
Flows that require guaranteed flow bit rate (GBR QoS Flows) and QoS Flows that
do not require guaranteed flow bit rate (Non-GBR QoS Flows). The 5G QoS model
also supports Reflective QoS (see clause 5.7.5).
The QoS Flow is the finest granularity of QoS differentiation in the PDU
Session. A QoS Flow ID (QFI) is used to identify a QoS Flow in the 5G System.
User Plane traffic with the same QFI within a PDU Session receives the same
traffic forwarding treatment **_(e.g._** scheduling, admission threshold). The
QFI is carried in an encapsulation header on N3 (and N9) i.e. without any
changes to the e2e packet header. QFI shall be used for all PDU Session Types.
The QFI shall be unique within a PDU Session. The QFI may be dynamically
assigned or may be equal to the 5QI (see clause 5.7.2.1).
Within the 5GS, a QoS Flow is controlled by the SMF and may be preconfigured,
or established via the PDU Session Establishment procedure (see clause 4.3.2
of TS 23.502 [3]), or the PDU Session Modification procedure (see clause 4.3.3
of TS 23.502 [3].
Any QoS Flow is characterised by:
\- A QoS profile provided by the SMF to the AN via the AMF over the N2
reference point or preconfigured in the AN;
\- One or more QoS rule(s) and optionally QoS Flow level QoS parameters (as
specified in TS 24.501 [47]) associated with these QoS rule(s) which can be
provided by the SMF to the UE via the AMF over the N1 reference point and/or
derived by the UE by applying Reflective QoS control; and
\- One or more UL and DL PDR(s) provided by the SMF to the UPF.
Within the 5GS, a QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule is required to
be established for a PDU Session and remains established throughout the
lifetime of the PDU Session. This QoS Flow should be a Non-GBR QoS Flow
(further details are described in clause 5.7.2.7).
A QoS Flow is associated with QoS requirements as specified by QoS parameters
and QoS characteristics.
NOTE: The QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule provides the UE with
connectivity throughout the lifetime of the PDU Session. Possible interworking
with EPS motivates the recommendation for this QoS Flow to be of type Non-GBR.
#### 5.7.1.2 QoS Profile
A QoS Flow may either be \'GBR\' or \'Non-GBR\' depending on its QoS profile.
The QoS profile of a QoS Flow is sent to the (R)AN and it contains QoS
parameters as described below (details of QoS parameters are described in
clause 5.7.2):
\- For each QoS Flow, the QoS profile shall include the QoS parameters:
\- 5G QoS Identifier (5QI); and
\- Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP).
\- For each Non-GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile may also include the QoS
parameter:
\- Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA).
\- For each GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile shall also include the QoS
parameters:
\- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) - UL and DL; and
\- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) - UL and DL; and
\- In the case of a GBR QoS Flow only, the QoS profile may also include one or
more of the QoS parameters:
\- Notification control;
\- Maximum Packet Loss Rate - UL and DL.
NOTE: In this Release of the specification, the Maximum Packet Loss Rate (UL,
DL) is only provided for a GBR QoS Flow belonging to voice media.
Each QoS profile has one corresponding QoS Flow identifier (QFI) which is not
included in the QoS profile itself.
The usage of a dynamically assigned 5QI for a QoS Flow requires in addition
the signalling of the complete 5G QoS characteristics (described in clause
5.7.3) as part of the QoS profile.
When a standardized or pre-configured 5QI is used for a QoS Flow, some of the
5G QoS characteristics may be signalled as part of the QoS profile (as
described in clause 5.7.3).
#### 5.7.1.2a Alternative QoS Profile
The Alternative QoS Profile(s) can be optionally provided for a GBR QoS Flow
with Notification control enabled. If the corresponding PCC rule contains the
related information (as described in TS 23.503 [45]), the SMF shall provide,
in addition to the QoS profile, a prioritized list of Alternative QoS
Profile(s) to the NG-RAN. If the SMF provides a new prioritized list of
Alternative QoS Profile(s) to the NG-RAN (if the corresponding PCC rule
information changes), the NG-RAN shall replace any previously stored list with
it.
An Alternative QoS Profile represents a combination of QoS parameters PDB, PER
and GFBR to which the application traffic is able to adapt.
NOTE 1: There is no requirement that the GFBR monotonically decreases, nor
that the PDB or PER monotonically increase as the Alternative QoS Profiles
become less preferred.
When the NG-RAN sends a notification to the SMF that the QoS profile is not
fulfilled, the NG-RAN shall, if the currently fulfilled values match an
Alternative QoS Profile, include also the reference to the Alternative QoS
Profile to indicate the QoS that the NG-RAN currently fulfils (see clause
5.7.2.4). The NG-RAN shall enable the SMF to determine when an NG-RAN node
supports the Alternative QoS feature but cannot fulfil even the least
preferred Alternative QoS Profile.
NOTE 2: To reduce the risk that GBR QoS Flows are released in case of RAN
resource limitations (and then experience difficulties in being re-
established), Application Functions can set the least preferred Alternative
Service Requirement to an undemanding level.
#### 5.7.1.3 Control of QoS Flows
The following options are supported to control QoS Flows:
1) For Non-GBR QoS Flows, and when standardized 5QIs or pre-configured 5QIs
are used and when the 5QI is within the range of the QFI (i.e. a value less
than 64), the 5QI value may be used as the QFI of the QoS Flow.
(a) A default ARP shall be pre-configured in the AN; or
(b) The ARP and the QFI shall be sent to RAN over N2 at PDU Session
Establishment or at PDU Session Modification and when NG-RAN is used every
time the User Plane of the PDU Session is activated; and
2) For all other cases (including GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows), a dynamically
assigned QFI shall be used. The 5QI value may be a standardized, pre-
configured or dynamically assigned. The QoS profile and the QFI of a QoS Flow
shall be provided to the (R)AN over N2 at PDU Session
Establishment/Modification and when NG-RAN is used every time the User Plane
of the PDU Session is activated.
Only options 1b and 2 may apply to 3GPP ANs. Options 1a, 1b and 2 may apply to
Non-3GPP access.
NOTE: Pre-configured 5QI values cannot be used when the UE is roaming.
#### 5.7.1.4 QoS Rules
The UE performs the classification and marking of UL User plane traffic, i.e.
the association of UL traffic to QoS Flows, based on QoS rules. These QoS
rules may be explicitly provided to the UE (i.e. explicitly signalled QoS
rules using the PDU Session Establishment/Modification procedure), pre-
configured in the UE or implicitly derived by the UE by applying Reflective
QoS (see clause 5.7.5). A QoS rule contains the QFI of the associated QoS
Flow, a Packet Filter Set (see clause 5.7.6) and a precedence value (see
clause 5.7.1.9). An explicitly signalled QoS rule contains a QoS rule
identifier which is unique within the PDU Session and is generated by SMF.
There can be more than one QoS rule associated with the same QoS Flow (i.e.
with the same QFI).
When the UE informs the network about the number of supported Packet Filters
for signalled QoS rules for the PDU Session (during the PDU Session
Establishment procedure or using the PDU Session Modification procedure as
described in clause 5.17.2.2.2 after the first inter-system change from EPS to
5GS for a PDU Session established in EPS and transferred from EPS with N26
interface), the SMF shall ensure that the sum of the Packet Filters used by
all signalled QoS rules for a PDU Session does not exceed the number indicated
by the UE.
A default QoS rule is required to be sent to the UE for every PDU Session
establishment and it is associated with a QoS Flow. For IP type PDU Session or
Ethernet type PDU Session, the default QoS rule is the only QoS rule of a PDU
Session which may contain a Packet Filter Set that allows all UL packets, and
in this case, the highest precedence value shall be used for the QoS rule.
NOTE 2: How the UE evaluates UL packets against the Packet Filter Set in a QoS
rule is described in clause 5.7.1.5.
NOTE 3: The QoS rule pre-configured in the UE is only used together with
option 1a for control QoS Flows as described in clause 5.7.1.3. How to keep
the consistency of QFI and Packet Filter Set between UE and network is out of
scope in this release of the specification.
For Unstructured type PDU Session, the default QoS rule does not contain a
Packet Filter Set, and in this case the default QoS rule defines the treatment
of all packets in the PDU Session.
As long as the default QoS rule does not contain a Packet Filter Set or
contains a Packet Filter Set that allows all UL packets, Reflective QoS should
not be applied for the QoS Flow which the default QoS rule is associated with
and the RQA should not be sent for this QoS Flow.
#### 5.7.1.5 QoS Flow mapping
The SMF performs the binding of PCC rules to QoS Flows based on the QoS and
service requirements (as defined in TS 23.503 [45]). The SMF assigns the QFI
for a new QoS Flow and derives its QoS profile, corresponding UPF instructions
and QoS Rule(s) from the PCC rule(s) bound to the QoS Flow and other
information provided by the PCF.
When applicable, the SMF provides the following information for the QoS Flow
to the (R)AN:
\- QFI;
\- QoS profile as described in clause 5.7.1.2.
\- optionally, Alternative QoS Profile(s) as described in clause 5.7.1.2a;
For each PCC rule bound to a QoS Flow, the SMF provides the following
information to the UPF enabling classification, bandwidth enforcement and
marking of User Plane traffic (the details are described in clause 5.8):
\- a DL PDR containing the DL part of the SDF template;
\- an UL PDR containing the UL part of the SDF template;
NOTE 1: If a DL PDR for an bidirectional SDF is associated with a QoS Flow
other than the one associated with the default QoS rule and the UE has not
received any instruction to use this QoS Flow for the SDF in uplink direction
(i.e. neither a corresponding QoS rule is sent to the UE nor the Reflective
QoS Indication is set in the PCC rule), it means that the UL PDR for the same
SDF has to be associated with the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS
rule.
\- the PDR precedence value (see clause 5.7.1.9) for both PDRs is set to the
precedence value of the PCC rule;
\- QoS related information (e.g. MBR for an SDF, GFBR and MFBR for a GBR QoS
Flow) as described in clause 5.8.2;
\- the corresponding packet marking information (e.g. the QFI, the transport
level packet marking value (e.g. the DSCP value of the outer IP header);
\- optionally, the Reflective QoS Indication is included in the QER associated
with the DL PDR (as described in clause 5.7.5.3).
For each PCC rule bound to a QoS Flow, when applicable, the SMF generates an
explicitly signalled QoS rule (see clause 5.7.1.4) according to the following
principles and provides it to the UE together with an add operation:
\- A unique (for the PDU Session) QoS rule identifier is assigned;
\- The QFI in the QoS rule is set to the QFI of the QoS Flow to which the PCC
rule is bound;
\- The Packet Filter Set of the QoS rule is generated from the UL SDF filters
and optionally the DL SDF filters of the PCC rule (but only from those SDF
filters that have an indication for being signalled to the UE, as defined in
TS 23.503 [45]);
\- The QoS rule precedence value is set to the precedence value of the PCC
rule for which the QoS rule is generated;
\- for a dynamically assigned QFI, the QoS Flow level QoS parameters (e.g.
5QI, GFBR, MFBR, Averaging Window, see TS 24.501 [47]) are signalled to UE in
addition to the QoS rule(s) associated to the QoS Flow. The QoS Flow level QoS
parameters of an existing QoS Flow may be updated based on the MBR and GBR
information received in the PCC rule (MBR and GBR per SDF are however not
provided to UE over N1 in the case of more than one SDF) or, if the PCF has
not indicated differently, when Notification control or handover related
signalling indicates that the QoS parameter the NG-RAN is currently fulfilling
for the QoS Flow have changed (see clause 5.7.2.4).
Changes in the binding of PCC rules to QoS Flows as well as changes in the PCC
rules or other information provided by the PCF can require QoS Flow changes
which the SMF has to provide to (R)AN, UPF and/or UE. In the case of changes
in the explicitly signalled QoS rules associated to a QoS Flow, the SMF
provides the explicitly signalled QoS rules and their operation (i.e.
add/modify/delete) to the UE.
NOTE 2: The SMF cannot provide, update or remove pre-configured QoS rules or
UE derived QoS rules.
The principle for classification and marking of User Plane traffic and mapping
of QoS Flows to AN resources is illustrated in Figure 5.7.1.5-1.
Figure 5.7.1.5-1: The principle for classification and User Plane marking for
QoS Flows and mapping to AN Resources
In DL, incoming data packets are classified by the UPF based on the Packet
Filter Sets of the DL PDRs in the order of their precedence (without
initiating additional N4 signalling). The UPF conveys the classification of
the User Plane traffic belonging to a QoS Flow through an N3 (and N9) User
Plane marking using a QFI. The AN binds QoS Flows to AN resources (i.e. Data
Radio Bearers of in the case of 3GPP RAN). There is no strict 1:1 relation
between QoS Flows and AN resources. It is up to the AN to establish the
necessary AN resources that QoS Flows can be mapped to, and to release them.
The AN shall indicate to the SMF when the AN resources onto which a QoS Flow
is mapped are released.
If no matching DL PDR is found, the UPF shall discard the DL data packet.
In UL:
\- For a PDU Session of Type IP or Ethernet, the UE evaluates UL packets
against the UL Packet Filters in the Packet Filter Set in the QoS rules based
on the precedence value of QoS rules in increasing order until a matching QoS
rule (i.e. whose Packet Filter matches the UL packet) is found.
\- If no matching QoS rule is found, the UE shall discard the UL data packet.
\- For a PDU Session of Type Unstructured, the default QoS rule does not
contain a Packet Filter Set and allows all UL packets.
NOTE 3: Only the default QoS rule exist for a PDU Session of Type
Unstructured.
The UE uses the QFI in the corresponding matching QoS rule to bind the UL
packet to a QoS Flow. The UE then binds QoS Flows to AN resources.
#### 5.7.1.6 DL traffic
The following characteristics apply for processing of DL traffic:
\- UPF maps User Plane traffic to QoS Flows based on the PDRs.
\- UPF performs Session-AMBR enforcement as specified in clause 5.7.1.8 and
performs counting of packets for charging.
\- UPF transmits the PDUs of the PDU Session in a single tunnel between 5GC
and (R)AN, the UPF includes the QFI in the encapsulation header. In addition,
UPF may include an indication for Reflective QoS activation in the
encapsulation header.
\- UPF performs transport level packet marking in DL on a per QoS Flow basis.
The UPF uses the transport level packet marking value provided by the SMF (as
described in clause 5.8.2.7).
\- (R)AN maps PDUs from QoS Flows to access-specific resources based on the
QFI and the associated 5G QoS profile, also taking into account the N3 tunnel
associated with the DL packet.
NOTE: Packet Filters are not used for the mapping of QoS Flows onto access-
specific resources in (R)AN.
\- If Reflective QoS applies, the UE creates a new derived QoS rule as defined
in clause 5.7.5.2.
#### 5.7.1.7 UL Traffic
Following characteristics apply for processing of UL traffic:
\- UE uses the stored QoS rules to determine mapping between UL User Plane
traffic and QoS Flows. UE marks the UL PDU with the QFI of the QoS rule
containing the matching Packet Filter and transmits the UL PDUs using the
corresponding access specific resource for the QoS Flow based on the mapping
provided by (R)AN. For NG-RAN, the UL behaviour is specified in clause 10.5.2
of TS 38.300 [27].
\- (R)AN transmits the PDUs over N3 tunnel towards UPF. When passing an UL
packet from (R)AN to CN, the (R)AN includes the QFI value, in the
encapsulation header of the UL PDU, and selects the N3 tunnel.
\- (R)AN performs transport level packet marking in the UL on a per QoS Flow
basis with a transport level packet marking value that is determined based on
the 5QI, the Priority Level (if explicitly signalled) and the ARP priority
level of the associated QoS Flow.
\- UPF verifies whether QFIs in the UL PDUs are aligned with the QoS Rules
provided to the UE or implicitly derived by the UE in the case of Reflective
QoS).
\- UPF and UE perform Session-AMBR enforcement as specified in clause 5.7.1.8
and the UPF performs counting of packets for charging.
#### 5.7.1.8 AMBR/MFBR enforcement and rate limitation
UL and DL Session-AMBR (see clause 5.7.2.6) shall be enforced by the UPF, if
the UPF receives the Session-AMBR values from the SMF as described in clause
5.8.2.7 and clause 5.8.2.11.4.
For UL Classifier PDU Sessions, UL and DL Session-AMBR (see clause 5.7.2.6)
shall be enforced in the SMF selected UPF that supports the UL Classifier
functionality. In addition, the DL Session-AMBR shall be enforced separately
in every UPF that terminates the N6 interface (i.e. without requiring
interaction between the UPFs) (see clause 5.6.4).
For multi-homed PDU Sessions, UL and DL Session-AMBR shall be enforced in the
UPF that supports the Branching Point functionality. In addition, the DL
Session-AMBR shall be enforced separately in every UPF that terminates the N6
interface (i.e. without requiring interaction between the UPFs) (see clause
5.6.4).
NOTE: The DL Session-AMBR is enforced in every UPF terminating the N6
interface to reduce unnecessary transport of traffic which may be discarded by
the UPF performing the UL Classifier/Branching Point functionality due to the
amount of the DL traffic for the PDU Session exceeding the DL Session-AMBR.
Discarding DL packets in the UL Classifier/Branching Point could cause
erroneous PDU counting for support of charging
The (R)AN shall enforce UE-AMBR (see clause 5.7.2.6) in UL and DL per UE for
Non-GBR QoS Flows.
The UE shall perform UL rate limitation on PDU Session basis for Non-GBR
traffic using Session-AMBR, if the UE receives a Session-AMBR.
MBR per SDF is mandatory for GBR QoS Flows but optional for Non-GBR QoS Flows.
The MBR is enforced in the UPF.
The MFBR is enforced in the UPF in the Downlink for GBR QoS Flows. The MFBR is
enforced in the (R)AN in the Downlink and Uplink for GBR QoS Flows. For
non-3GPP access, the UE should enforce MFBR in the Uplink for GBR QoS Flows.
The QoS control for Unstructured PDUs is performed at the PDU Session level
and in this Release of the specification there is only support for maximum of
one 5G QoS Flow per PDU Session of Type Unstructured.
When a PDU Session is set up for transferring unstructured PDUs, SMF provides
the QFI which will be applied to any packet of the PDU Session to the UPF and
UE.
#### 5.7.1.9 Precedence Value
The QoS rule precedence value and the PDR precedence value determine the order
in which a QoS rule or a PDR, respectively, shall be evaluated. The evaluation
of the QoS rules or PDRs is performed in increasing order of their precedence
value.
#### 5.7.1.10 UE-Slice-MBR enforcement and rate limitation
If a supporting NG-RAN receives for a UE a UE-Slice-MBR (see clause 5.7.2.6)
for an S-NSSAI from the AMF, the NG-RAN shall apply this UE-Slice-MBR for all
PDU Sessions of that UE corresponding to the S-NSSAI which have an active user
plane if feasible. In particular, the NG-RAN shall enforce this UE-Slice-MBR
as follows:
1) Whenever a request for a GBR QoS Flow establishment or modification is
received, the NG-RAN admission control shall ensure that the sum of the GFBR
values of the admitted GBR QoS Flows is not exceeding the UE-Slice-MBR and, if
the QoS Flow cannot be admitted, the NG-RAN shall reject the
establishment/modification of the QoS Flow.
NOTE: If the UE-Slice-MBR would be exceeded by a new/modified GBR QoS Flow,
the NG-RAN determines whether the new/modified GBR QoS Flow can pre-empt any
existing GBR QoS Flow of the UE\'s PDU Session(s) corresponding to the same
S-NSSAI based on their ARP values (as per clause 5.7.2.2), e.g. to support
certain priority services (e.g. MPS). If this is not possible, the NG-RAN can
reject the establishment/modification of the QoS Flow.
2) The NG-RAN shall ensure that the aggregated bitrate across all GBR and Non-
GBR QoS Flows belonging to those PDU Sessions is not exceeding the UE-Slice-
MBR, while always guaranteeing the GFBR of every GBR QoS Flow of those PDU
Sessions as described in clause 5.7.2.5.
#### 5.7.1.11 QoS aspects of home-routed roaming
In the case of home-routed roaming, the V-SMF may apply VPLMN policies related
with the SLA negotiated with the HPLMN or with QoS values supported by the
VPLMN. Such policies may result in a situation that the V-SMF does not accept
the PDU Session or does not accept some of the QoS Flows requested by the
H-SMF.
QoS constraints represent the QoS that the VPLMN can accept for the QoS Flow
associated with the default QoS rule and the PDU Session based on SLA or based
on QoS values supported by the VPLMN. The QoS constraints may contain 5QI and
ARP for the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and highest Session-
AMBR accepted by the VPLMN.
At PDU Session Establishment for home-routed roaming, to reduce the risk of
PDU Session establishment failure due to QoS from the HPLMN not being
compliant with SLA, the V-SMF may provide the VPLMN local policy in QoS
constraints to the H-SMF as specified in clause 4.3.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
For intra-5GS mobility with V-SMF insertion or V-SMF change (e.g. inter-PLMN
mobility), as specified in clause 4.23 of TS 23.502 [3], the new/target V-SMF
may validate the currently applied QoS against the QoS constraints. The
new/target V-SMF provides QoS constraints to the H-SMF during the mobility
procedure. The new/target V-SMF may temporarily accept a higher QoS even if
the currently applied QoS exceeds the QoS constraints. Alternatively, for the
QoS parameters related with the QoS constraints, the V-SMF may locally
downgrade these values before providing the corresponding QoS profiles to 5G
AN. The V-SMF may decide to release the PDU Session if the HPLMN does not
provide updated QoS compliant with the QoS constraints after the mobility
procedure.
For IMS voice service (e.g., the IMS DNN defined by the GSMA), the V-SMF,
based on local policy, may override the ARP received from HPLMN over N16 if
the ARP indicates priority not in line with the local policy in VPLMN. The ARP
override in the serving PLMN applies to both the QoS Flow associated with the
default QoS rule and the QoS Flows for IMS voice, to apply the same allocation
and retention priority for all users (i.e., roamers and non-roamers). For MPS
(clause 5.16.5), the same allocation and retention priority is applied to all
MPS service users (i.e. roamers and non-roamers), when roaming agreements are
in place and where regulatory requirements apply.
### 5.7.2 5G QoS Parameters
#### 5.7.2.1 5QI
A 5QI is a scalar that is used as a reference to 5G QoS characteristics
defined in clause 5.7.4, i.e. access node-specific parameters that control QoS
forwarding treatment for the QoS Flow (e.g. scheduling weights, admission
thresholds, queue management thresholds, link layer protocol configuration,
etc.).
Standardized 5QI values have one-to-one mapping to a standardized combination
of 5G QoS characteristics as specified in Table 5.7.4-1.
The 5G QoS characteristics for pre-configured 5QI values are pre-configured in
the AN.
Standardized or pre-configured 5G QoS characteristics, are indicated through
the 5QI value, and are not signalled on any interface, unless certain 5G QoS
characteristics are modified as specified in clauses 5.7.3.3, 5.7.3.4,
5.7.3.6, and 5.7.3.7.
The 5G QoS characteristics for QoS Flows with dynamically assigned 5QI are
signalled as part of the QoS profile.
NOTE: On N3, each PDU (i.e. in the tunnel used for the PDU Session) is
associated with one 5QI via the QFI carried in the encapsulation header.
#### 5.7.2.2 ARP
The QoS parameter ARP contains information about the priority level, the pre-
emption capability and the pre-emption vulnerability. This allows deciding
whether a QoS Flow establishment/modification/handover may be accepted or
needs to be rejected in the case of resource limitations (typically used for
admission control of GBR traffic). It may also be used to decide which
existing QoS Flow to pre-empt during resource limitations, i.e. which QoS Flow
to release to free up resources.
The ARP priority level defines the relative importance of a QoS Flow. The
range of the ARP priority level is 1 to 15 with 1 as the highest priority.
The ARP priority levels 1-8 should only be assigned to QoS Flows for services
that are authorized to receive prioritized treatment within an operator domain
(i.e. that are authorized by the serving network). The ARP priority levels
9-15 may be assigned to QoS Flows for services that are authorized by the home
network and thus applicable when a UE is roaming.
NOTE: This ensures that future releases may use ARP priority level 1-8 to
indicate e.g. emergency and other priority services within an operator domain
in a backward compatible manner. This does not prevent the use of ARP priority
level 1-8 in roaming situation in the case that appropriate roaming agreements
exist that ensure a compatible use of these priority levels.
The ARP pre-emption capability defines whether a QoS Flow may get resources
that were already assigned to another QoS Flow with a lower priority. The ARP
pre-emption vulnerability defines whether a QoS Flow may lose the resources
assigned to it in order to admit a QoS Flow with higher priority. The ARP pre-
emption capability and the ARP pre-emption vulnerability shall be either set
to \'enabled\' or \'disabled\'.
The ARP pre-emption vulnerability of the QoS Flow which the default QoS rule
is associated with should be set appropriately to minimize the risk of a
release of this QoS Flow.
The details of how the SMF sets the ARP for a QoS Flow are further described
in clause 5.7.2.7.
#### 5.7.2.3 RQA
The Reflective QoS Attribute (RQA) is an optional parameter which indicates
that certain traffic (not necessarily all) carried on this QoS Flow is subject
to Reflective QoS. Only when the RQA is signalled for a QoS Flow, the (R)AN
enables the transfer of the RQI for AN resource corresponding to this QoS
Flow. The RQA may be signalled to NG-RAN via the N2 reference point at UE
context establishment in NG-RAN and at QoS Flow establishment or modification.
#### 5.7.2.4 Notification control
##### 5.7.2.4.1 General
The QoS Parameter Notification control indicates whether notifications are
requested from the NG-RAN when the \"GFBR can no longer (or can again) be
guaranteed\" for a QoS Flow during the lifetime of the QoS Flow. Notification
control may be used for a GBR QoS Flow if the application traffic is able to
adapt to the change in the QoS (e.g. if the AF is capable to trigger rate
adaptation).
The SMF shall only enable Notification control when the QoS Notification
Control parameter is set in the PCC rule (received from the PCF) that is bound
to the QoS Flow. The Notification control parameter is signalled to the NG-RAN
as part of the QoS profile.
##### 5.7.2.4.1a Notification Control without Alternative QoS Profiles
If, for a given GBR QoS Flow, Notification control is enabled and the NG-RAN
determines that the GFBR, the PDB or the PER of the QoS profile cannot be
fulfilled, NG-RAN shall send a notification towards SMF that the \"GFBR can no
longer be guaranteed\". Furthermore, the NG-RAN shall keep the QoS Flow (i.e.
while the NG-RAN is not fulfilling the requested QoS profile for this QoS
Flow), unless specific conditions at the NG-RAN require the release of the NG-
RAN resources for this GBR QoS Flow, e.g. due to Radio link failure or RAN
internal congestion. The NG-RAN should try to fulfil the GFBR, the PDB and the
PER of the QoS profile again.
NOTE 1: NG-RAN can decide that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" based
on, e.g. measurements like queuing delay or system load.
Upon receiving a notification from the NG-RAN that the \"GFBR can no longer be
guaranteed\", the SMF may forward the notification to the PCF, see TS 23.503
[45].
When the NG-RAN determines that the GFBR, the PDB and the PER of the QoS
profile can be fulfilled again for a QoS Flow (for which a notification that
the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" has been sent), the NG-RAN shall send
a notification, informing the SMF that the \"GFBR can be guaranteed\" again
and the SMF may forward the notification to the PCF, see TS 23.503 [45]. The
NG-RAN shall send a subsequent notification that the \"GFBR can no longer be
guaranteed\" whenever necessary.
NOTE 2: It is assumed that NG-RAN implementation will apply some hysteresis
before determining that the \"GFBR can be guaranteed again\" and therefore a
frequent signalling of \"GFBR can be guaranteed again\" followed by \"GFBR can
no longer be guaranteed\" is not expected.
NOTE 3: If the QoS Flow is modified, the NG-RAN restarts the check whether the
\"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" according to the updated QoS profile. If
the Notification control parameter is not included in the updated QoS profile,
the Notification control is disabled.
During a handover, the Source NG-RAN does not inform the Target NG-RAN about
whether the Source NG-RAN has sent a notification for a QoS Flow that the
\"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\". The Target NG-RAN performs admission
control rejecting any QoS Flows for which resources cannot be permanently
allocated. The accepted QoS Flows are included in the N2 Path Switch Request
or N2 Handover Request Acknowledge message from the NG-RAN to the AMF. The SMF
shall interpret the fact that a QoS Flow is listed as transferred QoS Flow in
the Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext Request received from the AMF as a
notification that \"GFBR can be guaranteed again\" for this QoS Flow unless
the SMF is also receiving a reference to an Alternative QoS Profile for this
QoS Flow (which is described in clause 5.7.2.4.2). After the handover is
successfully completed, the Target NG-RAN shall send a subsequent notification
that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" for such a QoS Flow whenever
necessary. If the SMF has previously notified the PCF that the \"GFBR can no
longer be guaranteed\" and the SMF does not receive an explicit notification
that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" for that QoS Flow from the
Target NG-RAN within a configured time, the SMF shall notify the PCF that the
\"GFBR can be guaranteed again\".
##### 5.7.2.4.1b Notification control with Alternative QoS Profiles
If, for a given GBR QoS Flow, Notification control is enabled and the NG-RAN
has received a list of Alternative QoS Profile(s) for this QoS Flow and
supports the Alternative QoS Profile handling, the following shall apply:
1) If the NG-RAN determines that the GFBR, the PDB or the PER of the QoS
profile cannot be fulfilled, NG-RAN shall send a notification towards SMF that
the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\". Before sending a notification that
the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" towards the SMF, the NG-RAN shall
check whether the GFBR, the PDB and the PER that the NG-RAN currently fulfils
match any of the Alternative QoS Profile(s) in the indicated priority order.
If there is a match, the NG-RAN shall indicate the reference to the matching
Alternative QoS Profile with the highest priority together with the
notification to the SMF.
If there is no match, the NG-RAN shall send a notification that the \"GFBR can
no longer be guaranteed\" towards the SMF indicating that the lowest
Alternative QoS Profile cannot be fulfilled (unless specific conditions at the
NG-RAN require the release of the NG-RAN resources for this GBR QoS Flow, e.g.
due to Radio link failure or RAN internal congestion).
2) If a notification that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" has been
sent to the SMF and the NG-RAN determines that the currently fulfilled GFBR,
PDB or PER are different (better or worse) from the situation indicated in the
last notification, the NG-RAN shall send a notification (i.e. \"GFBR can no
longer be guaranteed\" or \"GFBR can be guaranteed again\") to the SMF and
indicate the current situation (unless specific conditions at the NG-RAN
require the release of the NG-RAN resources for this GBR QoS Flow, e.g. due to
Radio link failure or RAN internal congestion).
NOTE 1: The current situation is either that the QoS Profile can be fulfilled
(which is implicitly indicated by the \"GFBR can be guaranteed again\"
notification itself), that a different Alternative QoS Profile can be
fulfilled, or that the lowest priority Alternative QoS Profile cannot be
fulfilled.
3)- The NG-RAN should always try to fulfil the QoS profile and, if this is not
possible, any Alternative QoS Profile that has higher priority.
NOTE 2: In order to avoid a too frequent signalling to the SMF, it is assumed
that NG-RAN implementation can apply hysteresis (e.g. via a configurable time
interval) before notifying the SMF that the currently fulfilled values match
the QoS Profile or a different Alternative QoS Profile of higher priority. It
is also assumed that the PCF has ensured that the QoS values within the
different Alternative QoS Profile(s) are not too close to each other.
4) Upon receiving a notification from the NG-RAN, the SMF may inform the PCF.
If it does so, the SMF shall indicate the currently fulfilled situation to the
PCF. See TS 23.503 [45].
5) If the PCF has not indicated differently, the SMF uses NAS signalling (that
is sent transparently through the RAN) to inform the UE about changes in the
QoS parameters (i.e. 5QI, GFBR, MFBR) that the NG-RAN is currently fulfilling
for the QoS Flow after Notification control has occurred.
##### 5.7.2.4.2 Usage of Notification control with Alternative QoS Profiles at
handover
During handover, the prioritized list of Alternative QoS Profile(s) (if
available) is provided to the Target NG-RAN per QoS Flow in addition to the
QoS profile. If the Target NG-RAN is not able to guarantee the GFBR, the PDB
and the PER included in the QoS profile and if Alternative QoS Profiles are
provided to the Target NG-RAN and the Target NG-RAN supports Alternative QoS
Profiles, the Target NG-RAN checks whether the GFBR, the PDB and the PER
values that it can fulfil match any of the Alternative QoS Profile(s) taking
the priority order into account. If there is a match between one of the
Alternative QoS Profiles and the GFBR, the PDB and the PER values that Target
NG-RAN can fulfil, the Target NG-RAN shall accept the QoS Flow and indicate
the reference to that Alternative QoS Profile to the Source NG-RAN.
If there is no match to any Alternative QoS Profile, the Target NG-RAN rejects
QoS Flows for which the Target NG-RAN is not able to guarantee the GFBR, the
PDB and the PER included in the QoS profile.
After the handover is completed and a QoS Flow has been accepted by the Target
NG-RAN based on an Alternative QoS Profile, the Target NG-RAN shall treat this
QoS Flow in the same way as if it had sent a notification that the \"GFBR can
no longer be guaranteed\" with a reference to that Alternative QoS Profile to
the SMF (as described in clause 5.7.2.4.1b).
If a QoS Flow has been accepted by the Target NG-RAN based on an Alternative
QoS Profile, the reference to the matching Alternative QoS Profile is provided
from the Target NG-RAN to the AMF (which forwards the message to the SMF)
during the Xn and N2 based handover procedures as described in TS 23.502 [3].
After the handover is completed successfully, the SMF shall send a
notification to the PCF that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" for a
QoS Flow (see TS 23.503 [45] for details) if the SMF has received a reference
to an Alternative QoS Profile and this reference indicates a change in the
previously notified state of this QoS Flow. If the PCF has not indicated
differently, the SMF shall also use NAS signalling (that is sent transparently
through the RAN) to inform the UE about the QoS parameters (i.e. 5QI, GFBR,
MFBR) corresponding to the new state of the QoS Flow.
NOTE: A state change for the QoS Flow comprises a change from QoS profile
fulfilled to Alternative QoS Profile fulfilled as well as the state change
between fulfilled Alternative QoS Profiles.
If a QoS Flow has been accepted by the Target NG-RAN based on the QoS Profile,
the SMF shall interpret the fact that a QoS Flow is listed as transferred QoS
Flow in the message received from the AMF as a notification that \"GFBR can be
guaranteed again\" for this QoS Flow. After the handover is successfully
completed, the Target NG-RAN performs as described in clause 5.7.2.4.1b. If
the SMF has previously notified the PCF that the \"GFBR can no longer be
guaranteed\" and the SMF does not receive an explicit notification that the
\"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" for that QoS Flow from the Target NG-RAN
within a configured time, the SMF shall notify the PCF that the \"GFBR can be
guaranteed again\".
If a QoS Flow has been accepted by the Target NG-RAN and SMF did not receive
from the Target NG-RAN a reference to any Alternative QoS Profile and the SMF
has previously informed the UE about QoS parameters corresponding to any of
the Alternative QoS Profile(s), the SMF shall use NAS signalling to inform the
UE about the QoS parameters corresponding to the QoS Profile.
##### 5.7.2.4.3 Usage of Notification control with Alternative QoS Profiles
during QoS Flow establishment and modification
During QoS Flow establishment and modification, a prioritized list of
Alternative QoS Profile(s) can be provided to the NG-RAN for the QoS Flow in
addition to the QoS profile. If the NG-RAN is not able to guarantee the GFBR,
the PDB and the PER included in the QoS profile and if Alternative QoS
Profiles are provided to the NG-RAN and the NG-RAN supports Alternative QoS
Profiles, the NG-RAN shall check whether the GFBR, the PDB and the PER values
that it can fulfil match at least one of the Alternative QoS Profile(s) taking
the priority order into account. If there is a match between one of the
Alternative QoS Profiles and the GFBR, the PDB and the PER values that the NG-
RAN can fulfil, the NG-RAN shall accept the QoS Flow and indicate the
reference to that Alternative QoS Profile to the SMF. If there is no match to
any Alternative QoS Profile, the NG-RAN shall reject the QoS Flow
establishment or modification.
After a successful QoS Flow establishment or modification during which the NG-
RAN indicated that the currently fulfilled QoS matches one of the Alternative
QoS Profiles, the NG-RAN shall treat this QoS Flow in the same way as if it
had sent a notification that the \"GFBR can no longer be guaranteed\" with a
reference to that Alternative QoS Profile to the SMF (as described in clause
5.7.2.4.1b).
If the SMF has received a reference to an Alternative QoS Profile during QoS
Flow establishment and modification the SMF may inform the PCF about it (as
described in TS 23.503 [45]).
If the PCF has not indicated differently, the SMF shall use NAS signalling
(that is sent transparently through the RAN) to inform the UE about the QoS
parameters (i.e. 5QI, GFBR, MFBR) corresponding to the referenced Alternative
QoS Profile.
#### 5.7.2.5 Flow Bit Rates
For GBR QoS Flows only, the following additional QoS parameters exist:
\- Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) - UL and DL;
\- Maximum Flow Bit Rate (MFBR) -- UL and DL.
The GFBR denotes the bit rate that is guaranteed to be provided by the network
to the QoS Flow over the Averaging Time Window. The MFBR limits the bit rate
to the highest bit rate that is expected by the QoS Flow (e.g. excess traffic
may get discarded or delayed by a rate shaping or policing function at the UE,
RAN, UPF). Bit rates above the GFBR value and up to the MFBR value, may be
provided with relative priority determined by the Priority Level of the QoS
Flows (see clause 5.7.3.3).
GFBR and MFBR are signalled to the (R)AN in the QoS Profile and signalled to
the UE as QoS Flow level QoS parameter (as specified in TS 24.501 [47]) for
each individual QoS Flow.
NOTE 1: The GFBR is recommended as the lowest acceptable service bitrate where
the service will survive.
NOTE 2: For each QoS Flow of Delay-critical GBR resource type, the SMF can
ensure that the GFBR of the QoS Flow can be achieved with the MDBV of the QoS
Flow using the QoS Flow binding functionality described in clause 6.1.3.2.4 of
TS 23.503 [45].
NOTE 3: The network can set MFBR larger than GFBR for a particular QoS Flow
based on operator policy and the knowledge of the end point capability, i.e.
support of rate adaptation at application / service level.
#### 5.7.2.6 Aggregate Bit Rates
Each PDU Session of a UE is associated with the following aggregate rate limit
QoS parameter:
\- per Session Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (Session-AMBR).
The Session-AMBR is signalled to the appropriate UPF entity/ies to the UE and
to the (R)AN (to enable the calculation of the UE-AMBR). The Session-AMBR
limits the aggregate bit rate that can be expected to be provided across all
Non-GBR QoS Flows for a specific PDU Session. The Session-AMBR is measured
over an AMBR averaging window which is a standardized value. The Session-AMBR
is not applicable to GBR QoS Flows.
Each UE is associated with the following aggregate rate limit QoS parameter:
\- per UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate (UE-AMBR).
The UE-AMBR limits the aggregate bit rate that can be expected to be provided
across all Non-GBR QoS Flows of a UE. Each (R)AN shall set its UE-AMBR to the
sum of the Session-AMBR of all PDU Sessions with active user plane to this
(R)AN up to the value of the UE-AMBR received from AMF. The UE-AMBR is a
parameter provided to the (R)AN by the AMF based on the value of the
subscribed UE-AMBR retrieved from UDM or the dynamic serving network UE-AMBR
retrieved from PCF (e.g. for roaming subscriber). The AMF provides the UE-AMBR
provided by PCF to (R)AN if available. The UE-AMBR is measured over an AMBR
averaging window which is a standardized value. The UE-AMBR is not applicable
to GBR QoS Flows.
Each group of PDU Sessions of the UE for the same slice (S-NSSAI) may be
associated with the following aggregate rate limit QoS parameter:
\- per UE per Slice-Maximum Bit Rate (UE-Slice-MBR).
The UE-Slice-MBR limits the aggregate bit rate that can be expected to be
provided across all GBR and Non-GBR QoS Flows corresponding to PDU Sessions of
the UE for the same slice (S-NSSAI) which have an active user plane. Each
supporting NG-RAN shall set its UE-Slice-MBR to the sum of the Session-AMBR
and MFBR for GBR QoS Flows of all PDU Sessions corresponding to the slice
(S-NSSAI) with active user plane to this NG-RAN up to the value of the UE-
Slice-MBR corresponding to the slice (S-NSSAI) received from AMF. The UE-
Slice-MBR is measured over an AMBR averaging window which is a standardized
value. The UE-Slice-MBR is an optional parameter provided to the NG-RAN by the
AMF as described in clause 5.15.13.
NOTE: The AMBR averaging window is only applied to Session-AMBR, UE-AMBR and
UE-Slice-MBR measurement and the AMBR averaging windows for Session-AMBR and
UE-AMBR are standardised to the same value.
#### 5.7.2.7 Default values
For each PDU Session Setup, the SMF retrieves the subscribed Session-AMBR
values as well as the subscribed default values for the 5QI and the ARP and
optionally, the 5QI Priority Level, from the UDM. The subscribed default 5QI
value shall be a Non-GBR 5QI from the standardized value range.
NOTE 1: The 5QI Priority Level can be added to the subscription information to
achieve an overwriting of the standardized or preconfigured 5QI Priority Level
e.g. in scenarios where dynamic PCC is not deployed or the PCF is unavailable
or unreachable.
The SMF may change the subscribed values for the default 5QI and the ARP and
if received, the 5QI Priority Level, based on interaction with the PCF as
described in TS 23.503 [45] or, if dynamic PCC is not deployed, based on local
configuration, to set QoS parameters for the QoS Flow associated with the
default QoS rule.
For QoS Flow(s) of the PDU Session other than the QoS Flow associated with the
default QoS rule, the SMF shall set the ARP priority level, the ARP pre-
emption capability and the ARP pre-emption vulnerability to the respective
values in the PCC rule(s) bound to that QoS Flow (as described in TS 23.503
[45]). If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the SMF shall set the ARP priority
level, the ARP pre-emption capability and the ARP pre-emption vulnerability
based on local configuration.
NOTE 2: The local configuration in the SMF can e.g. make use of the subscribed
value for the ARP priority level and apply locally configured values for the
ARP pre-emption capability and ARP pre-emption vulnerability.
If dynamic PCC is not deployed, the SMF can have a DNN based configuration to
enable the establishment of a GBR QoS Flow as the QoS Flow that is associated
with the default QoS rule. This configuration contains a standardized GBR 5QI
as well as GFBR and MFBR for UL and DL.
NOTE 3: Interworking with EPS is not possible for a PDU Session with a GBR QoS
Flow as the QoS Flow that is associated with the default QoS rule.
The SMF may change the subscribed Session-AMBR values (for UL and/or DL),
based on interaction with the PCF as described in TS 23.503 [45] or, if
dynamic PCC is not deployed, based on local configuration, to set the Session-
AMBR values for the PDU Session.
#### 5.7.2.8 Maximum Packet Loss Rate
The Maximum Packet Loss Rate (UL, DL) indicates the maximum rate for lost
packets of the QoS Flow that can be tolerated in the uplink and downlink
direction. This is provided to the QoS Flow if it is compliant to the GFBR
NOTE: In this Release of the specification, the Maximum Packet Loss Rate (UL,
DL) can only be provided for a GBR QoS Flow belonging to voice media.
#### 5.7.2.9 Wireline access network specific 5G QoS parameters
QoS parameters that are applicable only for or wireline access networks
(W-5GAN) are specified in TS 23.316 [84].
### 5.7.3 5G QoS characteristics
#### 5.7.3.1 General
This clause specifies the 5G QoS characteristics associated with 5QI. The
characteristics describe the packet forwarding treatment that a QoS Flow
receives edge-to-edge between the UE and the UPF in terms of the following
performance characteristics:
1 Resource type (Non-GBR, GBR, Delay-critical GBR);
2 Priority Level;
3 Packet Delay Budget (including Core Network Packet Delay Budget);
4 Packet Error Rate;
5 Averaging window (for GBR and Delay-critical GBR resource type only);
6 Maximum Data Burst Volume (for Delay-critical GBR resource type only).
The 5G QoS characteristics should be understood as guidelines for setting node
specific parameters for each QoS Flow e.g. for 3GPP radio access link layer
protocol configurations.
Standardized or pre-configured 5G QoS characteristics, are indicated through
the 5QI value, and are not signalled on any interface, unless certain 5G QoS
characteristics are modified as specified in clauses 5.7.3.3, 5.7.3.4,
5.7.3.6, and 5.7.3.7.
NOTE: As there are no default values specified, pre-configured 5G QoS
characteristics have to include all of the characteristics listed above.
Signalled 5G QoS characteristics are provided as part of the QoS profile and
shall include all of the characteristics listed above.
#### 5.7.3.2 Resource Type
The resource type determines if dedicated network resources related to a QoS
Flow-level Guaranteed Flow Bit Rate (GFBR) value are permanently allocated
(e.g. by an admission control function in a radio base station).
GBR QoS Flows are therefore typically authorized \"on demand\" which requires
dynamic policy and charging control. A GBR QoS Flow uses either the GBR
resource type or the Delay-critical GBR resource type. The definition of PDB
and PER are different for GBR and Delay-critical GBR resource types, and the
MDBV parameter applies only to the Delay-critical GBR resource type.
A Non-GBR QoS Flow may be pre-authorized through static policy and charging
control. A Non-GBR QoS Flow uses only the Non-GBR resource type.
#### 5.7.3.3 Priority Level
The Priority Level associated with 5G QoS characteristics indicates a priority
in scheduling resources among QoS Flows. The lowest Priority Level value
corresponds to the highest priority.
The Priority Level shall be used to differentiate between QoS Flows of the
same UE, and it shall also be used to differentiate between QoS Flows from
different UEs.
In the case of congestion, when all QoS requirements cannot be fulfilled for
one or more QoS Flows, the Priority Level shall be used to select for which
QoS Flows the QoS requirements are prioritised such that a QoS Flow with
Priority Level value N is priorized over QoS Flows with higher Priority Level
values (i.e. N+1, N+2, etc).In the case of no congestion, the Priority Level
should be used to define the resource distribution between QoS Flows. In
addition, the scheduler may prioritize QoS Flows based on other parameters
(e.g. resource type, radio condition) in order to optimize application
performance and network capacity.
Every standardized 5QI is associated with a default value for the Priority
Level -specified in QoS characteristics Table 5.7.4.1). Priority Level may
also be signalled together with a standardized 5QI to the -R)AN, and if it is
received, it shall be used instead of the default value.
Priority Level may also be signalled together with a pre-configured 5QI to the
(R)AN, and if it is received, it shall be used instead of the pre-configured
value.
#### 5.7.3.4 Packet Delay Budget
The Packet Delay Budget (PDB) defines an upper bound for the time that a
packet may be delayed between the UE and the N6 termination point at the UPF.
The PDB applies to the DL packet received by the UPF over the N6 interface,
and to the UL packet sent by the UE. For a certain 5QI the value of the PDB is
the same in UL and DL. In the case of 3GPP access, the PDB is used to support
the configuration of scheduling and link layer functions (e.g. the setting of
scheduling priority weights and HARQ target operating points). For GBR QoS
Flows using the Delay-critical resource type, a packet delayed more than PDB
is counted as lost if the data burst is not exceeding the MDBV within the
period of PDB and the QoS Flow is not exceeding the GFBR. For GBR QoS Flows
with GBR resource type not exceeding GFBR, 98 percent of the packets shall not
experience a delay exceeding the 5QI\'s PDB.
The 5G Access Network Packet Delay Budget (5G-AN PDB) is determined by
subtracting a static value for the Core Network Packet Delay Budget (CN PDB),
which represents the delay between any N6 termination point at the UPF (for
any UPF that may possibly be selected for the PDU Session) and the 5G-AN from
a given PDB.
NOTE 1: For a standardized 5QI, the static value for the CN PDB is specified
in the QoS characteristics Table 5.7.4-1.
NOTE 2: For a non-standardized 5QI, the static value for the CN PDB is
homogeneously configured in the network.
For GBR QoS Flows using the Delay-critical resource type, in order to obtain a
more accurate delay budget PDB available for the NG-RAN, a dynamic value for
the CN PDB, which represents the delay between the UPF terminating N6 for the
QoS Flow and the 5G-AN, can be used. If used for a QoS Flow, the NG-RAN shall
apply the dynamic value for the CN PDB instead of the static value for the CN
PDB (which is only related to the 5QI). Different dynamic value for CN PDB may
be configured per uplink and downlink direction.
NOTE 3: The configuration of transport network on CN tunnel can be different
per UL and DL, which can be different value for CN PDB per UL and DL.
NOTE 4: It is expected that the UPF deployment ensures that the dynamic value
for the CN PDB is not larger than the static value for the CN PDB. This avoids
that the functionality that is based on the 5G-AN PDB (e.g. MDBV, NG-RAN
scheduler) has to handle an unexpected value.
The dynamic value for the CN PDB of a Delay-critical GBR 5QI may be configured
in the network in two ways:
\- Configured in each NG-RAN node, based on a variety of inputs such as
different IP address(es) or TEID range of UPF terminating the N3 tunnel and
based on different combinations of PSA UPF to NG-RAN under consideration of
any potential I-UPF, etc;
\- Configured in the SMF, based on different combinations of PSA UPF to NG-RAN
under consideration of any potential I-UPF. The dynamic value for the CN PDB
for a particular QoS Flow shall be signalled to NG-RAN (during PDU Session
Establishment, PDU Session Modification, Xn/N2 handover and the Service
Request procedures) when the QoS Flow is established or the dynamic value for
the CN PDB of a QoS Flow changes, e.g. when an I-UPF is inserted by the SMF.
If the NG-RAN node is configured locally with a dynamic value for the CN PDB
for a Delay-critical GBR 5QI, and receives a different value via N2 signalling
for a QoS Flow with the same 5QI, local configuration in RAN node determines
which value takes precedence.
Services using a GBR QoS Flow and sending at a rate smaller than or equal to
the GFBR can in general assume that congestion related packet drops will not
occur.
NOTE 5: Exceptions (e.g. transient link outages) can always occur in a radio
access system which may then lead to congestion related packet drops. Packets
surviving congestion related packet dropping may still be subject to non-
congestion related packet losses (see PER below).
Services using Non-GBR QoS Flows should be prepared to experience congestion-
related packet drops and delays. In uncongested scenarios, 98 percent of the
packets should not experience a delay exceeding the 5QI\'s PDB.
The PDB for Non-GBR and GBR resource types denotes a \"soft upper bound\" in
the sense that an \"expired\" packet, e.g. a link layer SDU that has exceeded
the PDB, does not need to be discarded and is not added to the PER. However,
for a Delay-critical GBR resource type, packets delayed more than the PDB are
added to the PER and can be discarded or delivered depending on local
decision.
#### 5.7.3.5 Packet Error Rate
The Packet Error Rate (PER) defines an upper bound for the rate of PDUs (e.g.
IP packets) that have been processed by the sender of a link layer protocol
(e.g. RLC in RAN of a 3GPP access) but that are not successfully delivered by
the corresponding receiver to the upper layer (e.g. PDCP in RAN of a 3GPP
access). Thus, the PER defines an upper bound for a rate of non-congestion
related packet losses. The purpose of the PER is to allow for appropriate link
layer protocol configurations (e.g. RLC and HARQ in RAN of a 3GPP access). For
every 5QI the value of the PER is the same in UL and DL. For GBR QoS Flows
with Delay-critical GBR resource type, a packet which is delayed more than PDB
is counted as lost, and included in the PER unless the data burst is exceeding
the MDBV within the period of PDB or the QoS Flow is exceeding the GFBR.
#### 5.7.3.6 Averaging Window
Each GBR QoS Flow shall be associated with an Averaging window. The Averaging
window represents the duration over which the GFBR and MFBR shall be
calculated (e.g. in the (R)AN, UPF, UE).
Every standardized 5QI (of GBR and Delay-critical GBR resource type) is
associated with a default value for the Averaging window (specified in QoS
characteristics Table 5.7.4.1). The averaging window may also be signalled
together with a standardized 5QI to the (R)AN and UPF, and if it is received,
it shall be used instead of the default value.
The Averaging window may also be signalled together with a pre-configured 5QI
to the (R)AN, and if it is received, it shall be used instead of the pre-
configured value.
#### 5.7.3.7 Maximum Data Burst Volume
Each GBR QoS Flow with Delay-critical resource type shall be associated with a
Maximum Data Burst Volume (MDBV).
MDBV denotes the largest amount of data that the 5G-AN is required to serve
within a period of 5G-AN PDB.
Every standardized 5QI (of Delay-critical GBR resource type) is associated
with a default value for the MDBV (specified in QoS characteristics Table
5.7.4.1). The MDBV may also be signalled together with a standardized 5QI to
the (R)AN, and if it is received, it shall be used instead of the default
value.
The MDBV may also be signalled together with a pre-configured 5QI to the
(R)AN, and if it is received, it shall be used instead of the pre-configured
value.
### 5.7.4 Standardized 5QI to QoS characteristics mapping
Standardized 5QI values are specified for services that are assumed to be
frequently used and thus benefit from optimized signalling by using
standardized QoS characteristics. Dynamically assigned 5QI values (which
require a signalling of QoS characteristics as part of the QoS profile) can be
used for services for which standardized 5QI values are not defined. The one-
to-one mapping of standardized 5QI values to 5G QoS characteristics is
specified in table 5.7.4-1.

### 5.7.5 Reflective QoS
#### 5.7.5.1 General
Reflective QoS enables the UE to map UL User Plane traffic to QoS Flows
without SMF provided QoS rules and it applies for IP PDU Session and Ethernet
PDU Session. This is achieved by creating UE derived QoS rules in the UE based
on the received DL traffic. It shall be possible to apply Reflective QoS and
non-Reflective QoS concurrently within the same PDU Session.
For a UE supporting Reflective QoS functionality, the UE shall create a UE
derived QoS rule for the uplink traffic based on the received DL traffic if
Reflective QoS function is used by the 5GC for some traffic flows. The UE
shall use the UE derived QoS rules to determine mapping of UL traffic to QoS
Flows.
If the 3GPP UE supports Reflective QoS functionality, the UE should indicate
support of Reflective QoS to the network (i.e. SMF) for every PDU Session. For
PDU Sessions established in EPS and PDU Sessions transferred from EPS without
N26 interface, the UE indicates Reflective QoS support using the PDU Session
Establishment procedure. After the first inter-system change from EPS to 5GS
for PDU Sessions established in EPS and transferred from EPS with N26
interface, the UE indicates Reflective QoS support using the PDU Session
Modification procedure as described in clause 5.17.2.2.2. The UE as well as
the network shall apply the information whether or not the UE indicated
support of Reflective QoS throughout the lifetime of the PDU Session.
NOTE: The logic driving a supporting UE under exceptional circumstances to not
indicate support of Reflective QoS for a PDU Session is implementation
dependent.
Under exceptional circumstances, which are UE implementation dependent, the UE
may decide to revoke previously indicated support for Reflective QoS using the
PDU Session Modification procedure. In such a case, the UE shall delete all
derived QoS rules for this PDU Session and the network shall stop any user
plane enforcement actions related to Reflective QoS for this PDU Session. In
addition, the network may provide signalled QoS rules for the SDFs for which
Reflective QoS was used before. The UE shall not indicate support for
Reflective QoS for this PDU Session for the remaining lifetime of the PDU
Session.
If under the same exceptional circumstances mentioned above and while NAS
level MM or SM congestion control timer is running, the UE needs to revoke a
previously indicated support for Reflective QoS, the UE performs PDU Session
Release procedure that is exempt from MM and SM congestion control as defined
in clause 5.19.7.
#### 5.7.5.2 UE Derived QoS Rule
The UE derived QoS rule contains following parameters:
\- One UL Packet Filter (in the Packet Filter Set as defined in clause 5.7.6);
\- QFI;
\- Precedence value (see clause 5.7.1.9).
Upon receiving DL packet, one UL Packet Filter derived from the received DL
packet as described in this clause is used to identify a UE derived QoS rule
within a PDU Session.
For PDU Session of IP type, the UL Packet Filter is derived based on the
received DL packet as follows:
\- When Protocol ID / Next Header is set to TCP or UDP, by using the source
and destination IP addresses, source and destination port numbers, and the
Protocol ID / Next Header field itself.
\- When Protocol ID / Next Header is set to UDP, if the received DL packet is
UDP-encapsulated IPSec protected packet, by using the source and destination
IP addresses, source and destination port numbers, the Security Parameter
Index, and the Protocol ID / Next Header field itself. In this case, if an
uplink IPSec SA corresponding to a downlink IPSec SA of the SPI in the DL
packet exists and the SPI of the uplink IPSec SA is known to the NAS layer,
then the UL Packet Filter contains an SPI of the uplink IPSec SA.
\- When Protocol ID / Next Header is set to ESP, by using the source and
destination IP addresses, the Security Parameter Index, and the Protocol ID /
Next Header field itself. If the received DL packet is an IPSec protected
packet, and an uplink IPSec SA corresponding to a downlink IPSec SA of the SPI
in the DL packet exists and the SPI of the uplink IPSec SA is known to the NAS
layer, then the UL Packet Filter contains an SPI of the uplink IPSec SA.
NOTE 1: In this Release of the specification for PDU Sessions of IP type the
use of Reflective QoS is restricted to service data flows for which Protocol
ID / Next Header is set to TCP, UDP or ESP.
NOTE 2: The UE does not verify whether the downlink packets with RQI
indication match the restrictions on Reflective QoS.
NOTE 3: How to determine the received DL packet is UDP-encapsulated IPSec
protected packet is defined in RFC 3948 [138]. UDP encapsulation for ESP is
used when a NAT is detected, and there can be different Security Parameter
Indexes within the same IP-tuples.
For PDU Session of Ethernet type the UL Packet Filter is derived based on the
received DL packet by using the source and destination MAC addresses, the
Ethertype on received DL packet is used as Ethertype for UL packet. In the
case of presence of 802.1Q [98], the VID and PCP in IEEE Std 802.1Q [98]
header(s) of the received DL packet is also used as the VID and PCP field for
the UL Packet Filter. When double 802.1Q [98] tagging is used, only the outer
(S-TAG) is taken into account for the UL Packet Filter derivation.
NOTE 4: In this Release of the specification for PDU Sessions of Ethernet type
the use of Reflective QoS is restricted to service data flows for which 802.1Q
[98] tagging is used.
The QFI of the UE derived QoS rule is set to the value received in the DL
packet.
When Reflective QoS is activated the precedence value for all UE derived QoS
rules is set to a standardised value.
#### 5.7.5.3 Reflective QoS Control
Reflective QoS is controlled on per-packet basis by using the Reflective QoS
Indication (RQI) in the encapsulation header on N3 (and N9) reference point
together with the QFI and together with a Reflective QoS Timer (RQ Timer)
value that is either signalled to the UE upon PDU Session Establishment (or
upon PDU Session Modification as described in clause 5.17.2.2.2) or set to a
default value. The RQ Timer value provided by the core network is at the
granularity of PDU Session (the details are specified in TS 24.501 [47]).
When the 5GC determines that Reflective QoS has to be used for a specific SDF
belonging to a QoS Flow, the SMF shall provide the RQA (Reflective QoS
Attribute) within the QoS Flow\'s QoS profile to the NG-RAN on N2 reference
point unless it has been done so before. When the RQA has been provided to the
NG-RAN for a QoS Flow and the 5GC determines that the QoS Flow carries no more
SDF for which Reflective QoS has to be used, the SMF should signal the removal
of the RQA (Reflective QoS Attribute) from the QoS Flow\'s QoS profile to the
NG-RAN on N2 reference point.
NOTE 1: The SMF could have a timer to delay the sending of the removal of the
RQA. This would avoid signalling to the RAN in the case of new SDFs subject to
Reflective QoS are bound to this QoS Flow in the meantime.
When the 5GC determines to use Reflective QoS for a specific SDF, the SMF
shall ensure that the UPF applies the RQI marking (e.g. by setting the
indication to use Reflective QoS in the QER associated with the DL PDR if not
already set) for this SDF. The SMF shall also ensure that the uplink packets
for this SDF can be received by the UPF from the QoS Flow to which the DL PDR
of the SDF is associated with as specified in TS 29.244 [65], e.g. by
generating a new UL PDR for this SDF for that QoS Flow and providing it to the
UPF.
When the UPF is instructed by the SMF to apply RQI marking, the UPF shall set
the RQI in the encapsulation header on the N3 (or N9) reference point for
every DL packet corresponding to this SDF.
When an RQI is received by (R)AN in a DL packet on N3 reference point, the
(R)AN shall indicate to the UE the QFI and the RQI of that DL packet.
Upon reception of a DL packet with RQI:
\- if a UE derived QoS rule with a Packet Filter corresponding to the DL
packet does not already exist,
\- the UE shall create a new UE derived QoS rule with a Packet Filter
corresponding to the DL packet (as described in clause 5.7.5.2); and
\- the UE shall start, for this UE derived QoS rule, a timer set to the RQ
Timer value.
\- otherwise,
\- the UE shall restart the timer associated to this UE derived QoS rule; and
\- if the QFI associated with the downlink packet is different from the QFI
associated with the UE derived QoS rule, the UE shall update this UE derived
QoS rule with the new QFI.
NOTE 2: Non-3GPP ANs does not need N2 signalling to enable Reflective QoS. Non
3GPP accesses are expected to send transparently the QFI and RQI to the UE. If
the UPF does not include the RQI, no UE derived QoS rule will be generated. If
RQI is included to assist the UE to trigger an update of the UE derived QoS
rule, the reception of PDU for a QFI restarts the RQ Timer.
Upon timer expiry associated with a UE derived QoS rule the UE deletes the
corresponding UE derived QoS rule.
When the 5GC determines not to use Reflective QoS for a specific SDF any
longer:
\- The SMF shall ensure that the UPF stops applying RQI marking as specified
in TS 29.244 [65] (e.g. by removing the indication to use Reflective QoS from
the QER associated with the DL PDR) for this SDF.
\- When the UPF receives this instruction to stop applying RQI marking, the
UPF shall no longer set the RQI in the encapsulation header on the N3 (or N9)
reference point DL packets corresponding to this SDF.
\- The SMF shall also ensure that, after an operator configurable time, the
uplink packets for this SDF will not be accepted by the UPF over the QoS Flow
on which Reflective QoS was applied for this SDF as specified in TS 29.244
[65], e.g. by removing the UL PDR for this SDF from that QoS Flow.
NOTE 3: The operator configurable time has to be at least as long as the RQ
Timer value to ensure that no UL packet would be dropped until the UE derived
QoS rule is deleted by the UE.
When the 5GC determines to change the binding of the SDF while Reflective QoS
is used for this SDF, the SMF shall ensure that the uplink packets for this
SDF are accepted over the newly bound QoS Flow and, for an operator
configurable time, over the previously bound QoS Flow.
### 5.7.6 Packet Filter Set
#### 5.7.6.1 General
The Packet Filter Set is used in the QoS rule and the PDR to identify one or
more packet (IP or Ethernet) flow(s).
NOTE 1: A QoS Flow is characterised by PDR(s) and QoS rule(s) as described in
clause 5.7.1.1.
NOTE 2: DL Packet Filter in a Packet Filter Set of a QoS rule may be needed by
the UE e.g. for the purpose of IMS precondition.
The Packet Filter Set may contain one or more Packet Filter(s). Every Packet
Filter is applicable for the DL direction, the UL direction or both
directions.
NOTE 3: The Packet Filter in the Packet Filter Set of the default QoS rule
that allows all UL traffic (also known as match-all Packet Filter) is
described in TS 24.501 [47].
There are two types of Packet Filter Set, i.e. IP Packet Filter Set, and
Ethernet Packet Filter Set, corresponding to those PDU Session Types.
#### 5.7.6.2 IP Packet Filter Set
For IP PDU Session Type, the Packet Filter Set shall support Packet Filters
based on at least any combination of:
\- Source/destination IP address or IPv6 prefix.
\- Source / destination port number.
\- Protocol ID of the protocol above IP/Next header type.
\- Type of Service (TOS) (IPv4) / Traffic class (IPv6) and Mask.
\- Flow Label (IPv6).
\- Security parameter index.
\- Packet Filter direction.
NOTE 1: A value left unspecified in a Packet Filter matches any value of the
corresponding information in a packet.
NOTE 2: An IP address or Prefix may be combined with a prefix mask.
NOTE 3: Port numbers may be specified as port ranges.
#### 5.7.6.3 Ethernet Packet Filter Set
For Ethernet PDU Session Type, the Packet Filter Set shall support Packet
Filters based on at least any combination of:
\- Source/destination MAC address.
\- Ethertype as defined in IEEE 802.3 [131].
\- Customer-VLAN tag (C-TAG) and/or Service-VLAN tag (S-TAG) VID fields as
defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q [98].
\- Customer-VLAN tag (C-TAG) and/or Service-VLAN tag (S-TAG) PCP/DEI fields as
defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q [98].
\- IP Packet Filter Set, in the case that Ethertype indicates IPv4/IPv6
payload.
\- Packet Filter direction.
NOTE 1: The MAC address may be specified as address ranges.
NOTE 2: A value left unspecified in a Packet Filter matches any value of the
corresponding information in a packet.
## 5.8 User Plane Management
### 5.8.1 General
User Plane Function(s) handle the user plane path of PDU Sessions. 3GPP
specifications support deployments with a single UPF or multiple UPFs for a
given PDU Session. UPF selection is performed by SMF. The details of UPF
selection is described in clause 6.3.3. The number of UPFs supported for a PDU
Session is unrestricted.
For an IPv4 type PDU Session or an IPv6 type PDU Session without multi-homing
or an IPv4v6 type PDU Session, when multiple PDU Session Anchors are used (due
to UL CL being inserted), only one IPv4 address and/or IPv6 prefix is
allocated for the PDU Session. For an IPv6 multi-homed PDU Session there are
multiple IPv6 prefixes allocated for the PDU Session as described in clause
5.6.4.3.
If the SMF had requested the UPF to proxy ARP or IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation
for an Ethernet DNN, the UPF should respond to the ARP or IPv6 Neighbour
Solicitation Request, itself.
Deployments with one single UPF used to serve a PDU Session do not apply to
the Home Routed case and may not apply to the cases described in clause 5.6.4.
Deployments where a UPF is controlled either by a single SMF or multiple SMFs
(for different PDU Sessions) are supported.
UPF traffic detection capabilities may be used by the SMF in order to control
at least following features of the UPF:
\- Traffic detection (e.g. classifying traffic of IP type, Ethernet type, or
unstructured type)
\- Traffic reporting (e.g. allowing SMF support for charging).
\- QoS enforcement (The corresponding requirements are defined in clause 5.7).
\- Traffic routing (e.g. as defined in clause 5.6.4. for UL CL or IPv6 multi-
homing).
### 5.8.2 Functional Description
#### 5.8.2.1 General
This clause contains detailed functional descriptions for some of the
functions provided by the UPF. It is described how the SMF instructs it\'s
corresponding UP function and which control parameters are used.
#### 5.8.2.2 UE IP Address Management
##### 5.8.2.2.1 General
The UE IP address management includes allocation and release of the UE IP
address as well as renewal of the allocated IP address, where applicable.
The UE shall perform the association of the application to a new PDU Session
described in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of TS 23.503 [4], with the following
considerations:
\- If there is a matching URSP rule, except the URSP rule with the \"match
all\" Traffic descriptor, or a matching UE Local Configuration containing a
PDU Session Type of \"IPv4\", \"IPv6\" or \"IPv4v6\", then the UE shall set
the requested PDU Session Type to the PDU Session Type contained in the
matching URSP rule or in the matching UE Local Configuration, if this PDU
Session Type is supported by the UE\'s IP stack capabilities. Detailed
operation is described in TS 24.526 [110].
\- Otherwise, if a URSP Rule with the \"match all\" Traffic descriptor exists,
the UE shall set the requested PDU Session Type to the PDU Session Type
contained in the \"match all\" URSP Rule, if this PDU Session Type is
supported by the UE\'s IP stack capabilities. Detailed operation is described
in TS 24.526 [110].
\- Otherwise the UE shall set the requested PDU Session Type during the PDU
Session Establishment procedure based on its IP stack capabilities as follows:
\- A UE which supports IPv6 and IPv4 shall set the requested PDU Session Type
\"IPv4v6\".
\- A UE which supports only IPv4 shall request for PDU Session Type \"IPv4\".
\- A UE which supports only IPv6 shall request for PDU Session Type \"IPv6\".
\- When the IP version capability of the UE is unknown in the UE (as in the
case when the MT and TE are separated and the capability of the TE is not
known in the MT), the UE shall request for PDU Session Type \"IPv4v6\".
The SMF selects PDU Session Type of the PDU Session as follows:
\- If the SMF receives a request with PDU Session Type set to \"IPv4v6\", the
SMF selects either PDU Session Type \"IPv4\" or \"IPv6\" or \"IPv4v6\" based
on DNN configuration, subscription data and operator policies.
\- If the SMF receives a request for PDU Session Type \"IPv4\" or \"IPv6\" and
the requested IP version is supported by the DNN the SMF selects the requested
PDU Session type.
In its answer to the UE, the SMF may indicate the PDU Session Types not
allowed for the combination of (DNN, S-NNSAI). In this case, the UE shall not
request another PDU Session to the same (DNN, S-NNSAI) for PDU Session Types
indicated as not allowed by the network. In the case that the initial PDU
Session was established with a PDU Session Type and the UE needs another
single IP version PDU Session Type, the UE may initiate another PDU Session
Establishment procedure to this (DNN, S-NNSAI) in order to activate a second
PDU session with that PDU Session Type.
An SMF shall ensure that the IP address management procedure is based on the
selected PDU Session Type. If IPv4 PDU Session Type is selected, an IPv4
address is allocated to the UE. Similarly, if IPv6 PDU Session type is
selected, an IPv6 prefix is allocated. If IPv4v6 PDU Session Type is selected,
both an IPv4 address and an IPv6 prefix are allocated. For Roaming case, the
SMF in this clause refers to the SMF controlling the UPF(s) acting as PDU
Session Anchor. i.e. H-SMF in home routed case and V-SMF in local breakout
case. For home routed case, V-SMF forwards the PDU Session Type requested by
UE to H-SMF without interpreting it. V-SMF sends back to UE the PDU Session
Type selected by H-SMF. The SMF shall process the UE IP address management
related messages, maintain the corresponding state information and provide the
response messages to the UE.
The 5GC and UE support the following mechanisms:
a. During PDU Session Establishment procedure, the SMF sends the IP address to
the UE via SM NAS signalling. The IPv4 address allocation and/or IPv4
parameter configuration via DHCPv4 (according to RFC 2131 [9]) can also be
used once PDU Session is established.
b. /64 IPv6 prefix allocation shall be supported via IPv6 Stateless Auto-
configuration according to RFC 4862 [10], if IPv6 is supported. The details of
Stateless IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration are described in clause 5.8.2.2.3.
IPv6 parameter configuration via Stateless DHCPv6 (according to RFC 8415
[146]) may also be supported.
For scenarios with RG connecting to 5GC, additional features for IPv6 address
allocation and IPv6 prefix delegation are supported, as described in TS 23.316
[84].
To allocate the IP address via DHCPv4, the UE may indicate to the network
within the Protocol Configuration Options that the UE requests to obtain the
IPv4 address with DHCPv4, or obtain the IP address during the PDU Session
Establishment procedure. This implies the following behaviour both for static
and dynamic address allocation:
\- The UE may indicate that it requests to obtain an IPv4 address as part of
the PDU Session Establishment procedure. In such a case, the UE relies on the
5GC network to provide IPv4 address to the UE as part of the PDU Session
Establishment procedure.
\- The UE may indicate that it requests to obtain the IPv4 address after the
PDU Session Establishment procedure by DHCPv4. That is, when the 5GC network
supports DHCPv4 and allows that, it does not provide the IPv4 address for the
UE as part of the PDU Session Establishment procedure. The network may respond
to the UE by setting the allocated IPv4 Address to 0.0.0.0. After the PDU
Session Establishment procedure is completed, the UE uses the connectivity
with the 5GC and initiates the IPv4 address allocation on its own using
DHCPv4. However, if the 5GC network provides IPv4 address to the UE as part of
the PDU Session Establishment procedure, the UE should accept the IPv4 address
indicated in the PDU Session Establishment procedure.
\- If the UE sends no IP Address Allocation request, the SMF determines
whether DHCPv4 is used between the UE and the SMF or not, based on per DNN
configuration.
If dynamic policy provisioning is deployed, and the PCF was not informed of
the IPv4 address at PDU Session Establishment procedure, the SMF shall inform
the PCF about an allocated IPv4 address. If the IPv4 address is released, the
SMF shall inform the PCF about the de-allocation of an IPv4 address.
In order to support DHCP based IP address configuration, the SMF shall act as
the DHCP server towards the UE. The PDU Session Anchor UPF does not have any
related DHCP functionality. The SMF instructs the PDU Session Anchor UPF
serving the PDU Session to forward DHCP packets between the UE and the SMF
over the user plane.
When DHCP is used for external data network assigned addressing and parameter
configuration, the SMF shall act as the DHCP client towards the external DHCP
server. The UPF does not have any related DHCP functionality. In the case of
DHCP server on the external data network, the SMF instructs a UPF with N6
connectivity to forward DHCP packets between the UE and the SMF and the
external DHCP server over the user plane.
The 5GC may also support the allocation of a static IPv4 address and/or a
static IPv6 prefix based on subscription information in the UDM or based on
the configuration on a per-subscriber, per-DNN basis and per-S-NSSAI.
If the static IP address/prefix is stored in the UDM, during PDU Session
Establishment procedure, the SMF retrieves this static IP address/prefix from
the UDM. If the static IP address/prefix is not stored in the UDM subscription
record, it may be configured on a per-subscriber, per-DNN and per-S-NSSAI
basis in the DHCP/DN-AAA server and the SMF retrieves the IP address/prefix
for the UE from the DHCP/DN-AAA server. This IP address/prefix is delivered to
the UE in the same way as a dynamic IP address/prefix. It is transparent to
the UE whether the PLMN or the external data network allocates the IP address
and whether the IP address is static or dynamic.
For IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDU Session Type, during PDU Session Establishment
procedure, the SMF may receive a Subscriber\'s IP Index from the UDM. If the
UE IP address/prefix was not already allocated and provided to PCF when SMF
initiates the SM policy association, the SMF may receive a Subscribers IP
Index from the PCF. If the SMF received a Subscriber\'s IP index from both UDM
and PCF, the SMF shall apply the Subscriber\'s IP Index received from the PCF.
The SMF may use the Subscriber\'s IP Index to assist in selecting how the IP
address is to be allocated when multiple allocation methods, or multiple
instances of the same method are supported. In the case of Home Routed
roaming, the H-SMF may receive the IP index from the H-PCF.
NOTE: The IP Index can e.g. be used to select between different IP pools,
including between IP pools with overlapping private address range. To support
deployments with overlapping private IPv4 address, the IP domain corresponding
to IP index can also be provided from UDM to SMF as part of the subscription
data and then provided to PCF.
When Static IP addresses for a PDU session are not used, the actual allocation
of the IP Address(es) for a PDU Session may use any of the following
mechanisms:
\- The SMF allocates the IP address from a pool that corresponds to the PDU
Session Anchor (UPF) that has been selected
\- The UE IP address is obtained from the UPF. In that case the SMF shall
interact with the UPF via N4 procedures to obtain a suitable IP address. The
SMF provides the UPF with the necessary information allowing the UPF to derive
the proper IP address (e.g. the network instance).
\- In the case that the UE IP address is obtained from the external data
network, additionally, the SMF shall also send the allocation, renewal and
release related request messages to the external data network, i.e. DHCP/DN-
AAA server, and maintain the corresponding state information. The IP address
allocation request sent to DHCP/DN-AAA server may include the IP address pool
ID to identify which range of IP address is to be allocated. In this case the
SMF is provisioned with separate IP address pool ID(s), and the mapping
between IP address pool ID and UPF Id, DNN, S-NSSAI, IP version. The provision
is done by OAM or during the N4 Association Setup procedure.
A given IP address pool is controlled by a unique entity (either the SMF or
the UPF or an external server). The IP address managed by the UPF can be
partitioned into multiple IP address pool partition(s), i.e. associated with
multiple IP address pool ID(s).
When the SMF is configured to obtain UE IP addresses from the UPF, the SMF may
select a UPF based upon support of this feature. The SMF determines whether
the UPF supports this feature via NRF or via N4 capability negotiation during
N4 Association Setup. If no appropriate UPF support the feature, the SMF may
allocate UE IP addresses, if configured to do so.
The IP address/prefix is released by the SMF (e.g. upon release of the PDU
Session), likewise the UPF considers that any IP address it has allocated
within a N4 session are released when this N4 session is released.
##### 5.8.2.2.2 Routing rules configuration
When the UE has an IPv6 multi-homed PDU Session the UE selects the source IPv6
prefix according to IPv6 multi-homed routing rules pre-configured in the UE or
received from network. IPv6 multi-homed routing rules received from the
network have a higher priority than IPv6 multi-homed routing rules pre-
configured in the UE
The SMF can generate the IPv6 multi-homed routing rules for a UE based on
local configuration or dynamic PCC rules received from the PCF as defined in
TS 23.503 [45]. If dynamic PCC is deployed, the SMF generates the IPv6 multi-
home routing rules for a source IPv6 prefix based on the SDF Templates of
those PCC rules which contain the DNAI corresponding to the newly assigned
IPv6 prefix. The SMF can send IPv6 multi-homed routing rules to the UE to
influence the source IPv6 prefix selection in IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA)
messages according to RFC 4191 [8] at any time during the lifetime of the IPv6
multi-homed PDU Session. Such messages are sent via the UPF.
NOTE: For multiple IPv4 PDU Session and multiple IPv6 PDU Session cases,
routing rule based PDU Session selection is not specified in this Release of
the specification.
##### 5.8.2.2.3 The procedure of Stateless IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration
If Stateless IPv6 Address Autoconfiguration is used for IPv6 address
allocation to the UE, after PDU Session Establishment the UE may send a Router
Solicitation message to the SMF to solicit a Router Advertisement message. The
SMF sends a Router Advertisement message (solicited or unsolicited) to the UE.
The Router Advertisement messages shall contain the IPv6 prefix.
After the UE has received the Router Advertisement message, it constructs a
full IPv6 address via IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in accordance
with RFC 4862 [10]. To ensure that the link-local address generated by the UE
does not collide with the link-local address of the UPF and the SMF, the SMF
shall provide an interface identifier (see RFC 4862 [10]) to the UE and the UE
shall use this interface identifier to configure its link-local address. For
Stateless Address Autoconfiguration however, the UE can choose any interface
identifier to generate IPv6 addresses, other than link-local, without
involving the network. However, the UE shall not use any identifiers defined
in TS 23.003 [19] as the basis for generating the interface identifier. For
privacy, the UE may change the interface identifier used to generate full IPv6
address, as defined in TS 23.221 [23] without involving the network. Any
prefix that the SMF advertises to the UE is globally unique. The SMF shall
also record the relationship between the UE\'s identity (SUPI) and the
allocated IPv6 prefix. Because any prefix that the SMF advertises to the UE is
globally unique, there is no need for the UE to perform Duplicate Address
Detection for any IPv6 address configured from the allocated IPv6 prefix. Even
if the UE does not need to use Neighbor Solicitation messages for Duplicate
Address Detection, the UE may, for example, use them to perform Neighbor
Unreachability Detection towards the SMF, as defined in RFC 4861 [54].
Therefore, the SMF shall respond with a Neighbor Advertisement upon receiving
a Neighbor Solicitation message from the UE.
In IPv6 multi-homing PDU session, SMF shall not allocate an interface
identifier when a new IPv6 prefix allocated corresponding to the new PDU
Session Anchor.
The above IPv6 related messages (e.g. Router Solicitation, Router
Advertisement, Neighbor Solicitation, Neighbor Advertisement) are transferred
between the SMF and UE via the UPF(s). If the Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation is enabled for a PDU session, the above IPv6 related messages are
transferred between the SMF and UE via the AMF after PDU Session
Establishment, see clauses 4.3.2.2.1 and 4.3.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3], using the
Mobile Terminated Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation
procedures.
#### 5.8.2.3 Management of CN Tunnel Info
##### 5.8.2.3.1 General
CN Tunnel Info is the Core Network address of a N3/N9 tunnel corresponding to
the PDU Session. It comprises the TEID and the IP address which is used by the
UPF on the N3/N9 tunnel for the PDU Session.
The CN Tunnel Info allocation and release is performed by the UPF. The SMF
shall indicate to the UPF when the UPF is required to allocate/release CN
Tunnel Info.
##### 5.8.2.3.2 Void
##### 5.8.2.3.3 Management of CN Tunnel Info in the UPF
The UPF shall manage the CN Tunnel Info space. When a new CN Tunnel Info is
needed, the SMF shall request over N4 the UPF to allocate CN Tunnel Info for
the applicable N3/N9 reference point. In response, the UPF provides CN Tunnel
Info to the SMF. In the case of PDU Session Release or a UPF is removed from
the user plane path of an existing PDU Session, the SMF shall request UPF to
release CN Tunnel Info for the PDU Session. If the corresponding N4 Session is
released the UPF releases the associated CN Tunnel Info.
#### 5.8.2.4 Traffic Detection
##### 5.8.2.4.1 General
This clause describes the detection process at the UPF that identifies the
packets belonging to a session, or a service data flow.
The SMF is responsible for instructing the UP function about how to detect
user data traffic belonging to a Packet Detection Rule (PDR). The other
parameters provided within a PDR describe how the UP function shall treat a
packet that matches the detection information.
##### 5.8.2.4.2 Traffic Detection Information
The SMF controls the traffic detection at the UP function by providing
detection information for every PDR.
For IPv4 or IPv6 or IPv4v6 PDU Session type, detection information is a
combination of:
\- CN tunnel info.
\- Network instance.
\- QFI.
\- IP Packet Filter Set as defined in clause 5.7.6.2.
\- Application Identifier: The Application Identifier is an index to a set of
application detection rules configured in UPF.
For Ethernet PDU Session type, detection information is a combination of:
\- CN tunnel info.
\- Network instance.
\- QFI.
\- Ethernet Packet Filter Set as defined in clause 5.7.6.3.
In this Release of the specification for Unstructured PDU Session Type, the
UPF does not perform-QoS Flow level traffic detection for QoS enforcement.
Traffic detection information sent by the SMF to the UPF for a PDU Session may
be associated with Network instance for detection and routing of traffic over
N6. In the case of IP PDU Session Type, Network Instances can e.g. be used by
the UPF for traffic detection and routing in the case of different IP domains
or overlapping IP addresses. In the case of Ethernet PDU Session Type,
different Network Instances can e.g. be configured in the UPF with different
ways to handle the association between N6 and the PDU Sessions.
#### 5.8.2.5 Control of User Plane Forwarding
##### 5.8.2.5.1 General
The SMF controls user-plane packet forwarding for traffic detected by a PDR by
providing a FAR with instructions to the UPF, including:
\- Forwarding operation information;
\- Forwarding target information.
The details of the forwarding target and operation will depend on the scenario
and is described below. The following forwarding functionality is required by
the UPF:
\- Apply N3 /N9 tunnel related handling, i.e. encapsulation.
\- Forward the traffic to/from the SMF, e.g. as described in Table
5.8.2.5.2-1.
\- Forward the SM PDU DN Request Container from SMF to DN-AAA server
\- Forward the traffic according to locally configured policy for traffic
steering.
\- Forward the traffic according to N4 rules of a 5G VN group for 5G VN group
communication.
\- Forward the traffic to/from the EASDF.
Data forwarding between the SMF and UPF is transmitted on the user plane
tunnel established on N4 interface, defined in TS 29.244 [65].
##### 5.8.2.5.2 Data forwarding between the SMF and UPF
Scenarios for data forwarding between the SMF and UPF are defined as below:
Table 5.8.2.5.2-1: Scenarios for data forwarding between the SMF and UPF
+---+-------------------------------+---------------------------+ | | Scenario description | Data forwarding direction | +===+===============================+===========================+ | 1 | Forwarding of user-plane | UPF to SMF | | | packets between the UE and | | | | the SMF e.g. DHCP signalling. | SMF to UPF | +---+-------------------------------+---------------------------+ | 2 | Forwarding of packets between | UPF to SMF | | | the SMF and the external DN | | | | e.g. with DN-AAA server | SMF to UPF | +---+-------------------------------+---------------------------+ | 3 | Forwarding of packets subject | UPF to SMF | | | to buffering in the SMF. | | | | | SMF to UPF | +---+-------------------------------+---------------------------+ | 4 | Forwarding of End Marker | SMF to UPF | | | Packets constructed by the | | | | SMF to a downstream node. | | +---+-------------------------------+---------------------------+ | 5 | Forwarding of user data using | UPF to SMF | | | Control Plane CIoT 5GS | | | | Optimisation | SMF to UPF | +---+-------------------------------+---------------------------+
##### 5.8.2.5.3 Support of Ethernet PDU Session type
When configuring an UPF acting as PSA for an Ethernet PDU Session Type, the
SMF may instruct the UPF to route the traffic based on detected MAC addresses
as follows.
\- The UPF learns the MAC address(es) connected via N6 based on the source MAC
addresses of the DL traffic received on a N6 Network Instance.
\- The UPF learns the MAC address(es) of UE(s) and devices connected behind,
if any, based on the source MAC address contained within the UL traffic
received on a PDU Session (N3/N9 interface).
\- The UPF forwards DL unicast traffic (with a known destination address) on a
PDU Session determined based on the source MAC address(es) used by the UE for
the UL traffic.
\- The UPF forwards UL unicast traffic (with a known destination address) on a
port (PDU Session or N6 interface) determined based on the source MAC
address(es) learned beforehand.
\- In the case of multicast and broadcast traffic (if the destination MAC
address is a broadcast or multicast address):
\- for DL traffic received by UPF on a N6 Network Instance the UPF should
forward the traffic to every DL PDU Session (corresponding to any N4 Session)
associated with this Network Instance
\- for uplink traffic received by UPF over a PDU session on a N3/N9 interface,
the UPF should forward the traffic to the N6 interface and downlink to every
PDU session (except toward the one of the incoming traffic) associated with
the same N6 Network Instance
\- for uplink and downlink unicast traffic received by UPF, if the destination
MAC has not been learnt, the UPF should forward the traffic to every PDU
session associated with the same N6 Network Instance and towards the N6
interface. In any case the traffic is not replicated on the PDU Session or the
N6 interface of the incoming traffic.
NOTE 1: The UPF can consider a PDU Session or a N6 interface to be active or
inactive in order to avoid forwarding loops. User data traffic is not sent on
inactive PDU sessions or inactive N6 interface. This release of the
specification does not further specify how the UPF determines whether a PDU
Session or N6 interface is considered active or inactive.
NOTE 2: This release of the specification supports only a single N6 interface
in a UPF associated with the N6 Network Instance.
\- if the traffic is received with a VLAN ID, the above criteria apply only
towards the N6 interface or PDU session matching the same VLAN ID, unless the
UPF is instructed to remove the VLAN ID in the incoming traffic.
NOTE 3: This release of the specification supports Independent VLAN Learning
(IVL) and does not support Shared VLAN Learning (SVL), as described in IEEE
Std 802.1Q [98].
\- if the destination MAC address of traffic refers to the same N6 interface
or PDU session on which the traffic has been received, the frame shall be
dropped.
In order to handle scenarios where a device behind a UE is moved from a source
UE to a target UE, a MAC address is considered as no longer associated with a
UPF interface (source UE\'s PDU session) when the MAC address has not been
detected as Source MAC address in UL traffic for a pre-defined period of time
or the MAC address has been detected under a different interface (target UE\'s
PDU Session or N6).
NOTE 4: The UPF/NW-TT may also be provided with static filtering entries as
described in clause 5.28.3. How the UPF uses the static filtering entry to
achieve forwarding of Ethernet frames to one or more egress ports is up to UPF
implementation. The externally observable behaviour of 5GS Bridge needs to
comply with IEEE Std 802.1Q [98].
For ARP/IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation traffic, a SMF\'s request to respond to
ARP/IPv6 Neighbour Solicitation based on local cache information or to
redirect such traffic from the UPF to the SMF overrules the traffic forwarding
rules described above.
NOTE 5: Local policies in UPF associated with the Network Instance can prevent
local traffic switching in the UPF between PDU Sessions either for unicast
traffic only or for any traffic. In the case where UPF policies prevent local
traffic switching for any traffic (thus for broadcast/multicast traffic) some
mechanism such as responding to ARP/ND based on local cache information or
local multicast group handling is needed to ensure that upper layer protocol
can run on the Ethernet PDU sessions.
The SMF may ask to get notified with the source MAC addresses used by the UE,
e.g. if the PCF has subscribed to UE MAC address change notifications, as
described in TS 23.503 [45].
In order to request the UPF to act as defined above, the SMF may, for each PDU
Session corresponding to a Network Instance, set an Ethernet PDU Session
Information in a DL PDR that identifies all (DL) Ethernet packets matching the
PDU session. Alternatively, for unicast traffic the SMF may provide UPF with
dedicated forwarding rules related with MAC addresses notified by the UPF.
#### 5.8.2.6 Charging and Usage Monitoring Handling
##### 5.8.2.6.1 General
The SMF shall support interfaces towards CHF and PCF. The SMF interacts with
CHF and PCF based on information received from other control plane NFs and
user plane related information received from the UPF.
QoS Flow level, PDU Session level and subscriber related information remain at
the SMF, and only usage information is requested from the UPF.
##### 5.8.2.6.2 Activation of Usage Reporting in UPF
Triggered by the PCC rules received from the PCF or preconfigured information
available at SMF, as well as from the CHF for online charging method via quota
management mechanisms, the SMF shall provide Usage Reporting Rules to the UPF
for controlling how usage reporting is performed.
The SMF shall request the report of the relevant usage information for Usage
Monitoring, based on Monitoring Keys and triggers which are specified in TS
23.503 [45]. Each Usage Reporting Rule requested for usage monitoring control
is associated with the PDR(s) whose traffic is to be accounted under this
rule. The SMF shall generate the Usage Reporting Rule for each Monitoring-key
within the active PCC Rule(s), either preconfigured or received from the PCF
and also shall keep the mapping between them. Multiple Usage Reporting Rules
may be associated with the same PDR.
The SMF shall request the report of the relevant usage information for offline
and online charging, based on Charging keys and additional triggers which are
specified in TS 32.255 [68]. Each Usage Reporting Rule requested for offline
or online charging is associated with the PDR(s) whose traffic is to be
accounted under this rule. The SMF shall generate the Usage Reporting Rule for
each Charging key and Sponsor Identity (if applicable) within the active PCC
Rule(s), either preconfigured or received from the PCF, and also shall keep
the mapping between them. Multiple Usage Reporting Rules may be associated
with the same PDR.
The SMF function shall also provide reporting trigger events to the UPF for
when to report usage information. The reporting trigger events (e.g. triggers,
threshold information etc.) shall be supported for the PDU Session level
reporting as well as on Rule level basis as determined by the SMF. The
triggers may be provided as a volume, time or event to cater for the different
charging/usage monitoring models supported by the TS 23.503 [45] for usage
monitoring and by TS 32.255 [68] for converged offline and online charging.
The SMF shall decide on the thresholds value(s) based on allowance received
from PCF, CHF or based on local configuration. Other parameters for
instructing the UPF to report usage information are defined in TS 29.244 [65].
When the PCC Rule attribute Service Data flow handling while requesting credit
(specified in TS 23.503 [45]) indicates \"non-blocking\", the SMF shall
request the report of the relevant usage information for the Charging key and
Sponsor Identity (if applicable) and provide a default threshold value to the
UPF while waiting for the quota from the CHF.
In some cases, the same Usage Reporting Rule can be used for different
purposes (for both usage monitoring and charging), e.g. in the case that the
same set of PDR(s), measurement method, trigger event, threshold, etc. apply.
Similarly a reported measurement can be used for different purposes by the
SMF.
##### 5.8.2.6.3 Reporting of Usage Information towards SMF
The UPF shall support reporting of usage information to the SMF. The UPF shall
be capable to support reporting based on different triggers, including:
\- Periodic reporting with period defined by the SMF.
\- Usage thresholds provided by the SMF.
\- Report on demand received from the SMF.
The SMF shall make sure that the multiple granularity levels required by the
reporting keys in the Usage Reporting rules satisfy the following aggregation
levels without requiring a knowledge of the granularity levels by the UPF:
\- PDU Session level reporting;
\- Traffic flow (for both charging and usage monitoring) level reporting as
defined by the reporting keys in the Usage Reporting Rule (see the description
above).
Based on the mapping between Monitoring key and PCC rule stored at the SMF,
the SMF shall combine the reported information with session and subscriber
related information which is available at the SMF, for Usage Monitoring
reporting over the corresponding Npcf interface (N7 reference point).
Based on the mapping between Charging key and Sponsor Identity (if applicable)
and PCC rule stored at the SMF, the SMF shall combine the reported information
with session and subscriber related information which is available at the SMF,
for offline and online charging reporting over the corresponding charging
interfaces.
This functionality is specified in TS 32.255 [68].
The usage information shall be collected in the UPF and reported to the SMF as
defined in 5.8.2.6, based on Monitoring Keys and triggers which are specified
in TS 23.503 [45].
#### 5.8.2.7 PDU Session and QoS Flow Policing
ARP is used for admission control (i.e. retention and pre-emption of the new
QoS Flow). The value of ARP is not required to be provided to the UPF.
For every QoS Flow, the SMF shall determine the transport level packet marking
value (e.g. the DSCP in the outer IP header) based on the 5QI, the Priority
Level (if explicitly signalled) and optionally, the ARP priority level and
provide the transport level packet marking value to the UPF.
The SMF shall provide the Session-AMBR values of the PDU Session to the UPF so
that the UPF can enforce the Session-AMBR of the PDU Session across all Non-
GBR QoS Flows of the PDU Session.
SMF shall provide the GFBR and MFBR value for each GBR QoS Flow of the PDU
Session to the UPF. SMF may also provide the Averaging window to the UPF, if
Averaging window is not configured at the UPF or if it is different from the
default value configured at the UPF.
#### 5.8.2.8 PCC Related Functions
##### 5.8.2.8.1 Activation/Deactivation of predefined PCC rules
A predefined PCC rule is configured in the SMF.
The traffic detection filters, e.g. IP Packet Filter, required in the UP
function can be configured either in the SMF and provided to the UPF, as
service data flow filter(s), or be configured in the UPF, as the application
detection filter identified by an application identifier. For the latter case,
the application identifier has to be configured in the SMF and the UPF.
The traffic steering policy information can be only configured in the UPF,
together with traffic steering policy identifier(s), while the SMF has to be
configured with the traffic steering policy identifier(s).
Policies for traffic handling in the UPF, which are referred by some
identifiers corresponding to the parameters of a PCC rule, can be configured
in the UPF. These traffic handling policies are configured as predefined
QER(s), FAR(s) and URR(s).
When a predefined PCC rule is activated/deactivated by the PCF, SMF shall
decide what information has to be provided to the UPF to enforce the rule
based on where the traffic detection filters (i.e. service data flow filter(s)
or application detection filter), traffic steering policy information and the
policies used for the traffic handling in the UPF are configured and where
they are enforced:
\- If the predefined PCC rule contains an application identifier for which
corresponding application detection filters are configured in the UPF, the SMF
shall provide a corresponding application identifier to the UPF;
\- If the predefined PCC rule contains traffic steering policy identifier(s),
the SMF shall provide a corresponding traffic steering policy identifier(s) to
the UPF;
\- If the predefined PCC rule contains service data flow filter(s), the SMF
shall provide them to the UPF;
\- If the predefined PCC rule contains some parameters for which corresponding
policies for traffic handling in the UPF are configured in the UPF, the SMF
shall activate those traffic handling policies via their rule ID(s).
The SMF shall maintain the mapping between a PCC rule received over Npcf and
the flow level PDR rule(s) used on N4 interface.
##### 5.8.2.8.2 Enforcement of Dynamic PCC Rules
The application detection filters required in the UPF can be configured either
in the SMF and provided to the UPF as the service data flow filter, or be
configured in the UP function identified by an application identifier.
When receiving a dynamic PCC rule from the PCF which contains an application
identifier and/or parameters for traffic handling in the UPF:
\- if the application detection filter is configured in the SMF, the SMF shall
provide it in the service data flow filter to the UPF, as well as parameters
for traffic handling in the UPF received from the dynamic PCC rule;
\- otherwise, the application detection filters is configured in UPF, the SMF
shall provide to UPF with the application identifier and the parameters for
traffic handling in the UPF as required based on the dynamic PCC rule.
The SMF shall maintain the mapping between a PCC rule received over Npcf and
the flow level PDR(s) used on N4 interface.
##### 5.8.2.8.3 Redirection
The uplink application\'s traffic redirection may be enforced either in the
SMF (as specified in 5.8.2.5 Control of user plane forwarding) or directly in
the UPF. The redirect destination may be provided in the dynamic PCC rule or
be preconfigured, either in the SMF or in the UPF.
When receiving redirect information (redirection enabled/disabled and redirect
destination) within a dynamic PCC rule or being activated/deactivated by the
PCF for the predefined redirection policies, SMF shall decide whether to
provide and what information to be provided to the UPF based on where the
redirection is enforced and where the redirect destination is
acquired/preconfigured. When redirection is enforced in the UPF and the
redirect destination is acquired from the dynamic PCC rule or is configured in
the SMF, SMF shall provide the redirect destination to the UPF. When
redirection is enforced in the SMF, SMF shall instruct the UPF to forward
applicable user plane traffic to the SMF.
##### 5.8.2.8.4 Support of PFD Management
The NEF (PFDF) shall provide PFD(s) to the SMF on the request of SMF (pull
mode) or on the request of PFD management from NEF (push mode), as described
in TS 23.503 [45]. The SMF shall provide the PFD(s) to the UPF, which have
active PDR(s) with the application identifier corresponding to the PFD(s).
The SMF supports the procedures in clause 4.4.3.5 of TS 23.502 [3], for
management of PFDs. PFD(s) is cached in the SMF, and the SMF maintains a
caching timer associated to the PFD(s). When the caching timer expires and
there\'s no active PCC rule that refers to the corresponding application
identifier, the SMF informs the UPF to remove the PFD(s) identified by the
application identifier using the PFD management message.
When a PDR is provided for an application identifier corresponding to the
PFD(s) that are not already provided to the UPF, the SMF shall provide the
PFD(s) to the UPF (if there are no PFD(s) cached, the SMF retrieves them from
the NEF (PFDF) as specified in TS 23.503 [45]). When any update of the PFD(s)
is received from NEF (PFDF) by SMF (using \"push\" or \"pull\" mode), and
there are still active PDRs in UPF for the application identifier, the SMF
shall provision the updated PFD set corresponding to the application
identifier to the UPF using the PFD management message.
NOTE 1: SMF can assure not to overload N4 signalling while managing PFD(s) to
the UPF, e.g. forwarding the PFD(s) to the right UPF where the PFD(s) is
enforced.
When the UPF receives the updated PFD(s) from either the same or different SMF
for the same application identifier, the latest received PFD(s) shall
overwrite any existing PFD(s) stored in the UPF.
NOTE 2: For the case a single UPF is controlled by multiple SMFs, the conflict
of PFD(s) corresponding to the same application identifier provided by
different SMF can be avoided by operator enforcing a well-planned NEF (PFDF)
and SMF/UPF deployment.
When a PFD is removed/modified and this PFD was used to detect application
traffic related to an application identifier in a PDR of an N4 session and the
UPF has reported the application start to the SMF as defined in clause 4.4.2.2
of TS 23.502 [3] for the application instance corresponding to this PFD, the
UPF shall report the application stop to the SMF for the corresponding
application instance identifier if the removed/modified PFD in UPF results in
that the stop of the application instance is not being able to be detected.
If the PFDs are managed by local O&M procedures, PFD retrieval is not used;
otherwise, the PFDs retrieved from NEF (PFDF) override any PFDs pre-configured
in the SMF. When all the PFDs retrieved from the NEF (PFDF) for an application
identifier are removed, the pre-configured PFDs are used. The SMF shall
provide either the PFDs retrieved from NEF (PFDF) or the pre-configured PFDs
for an application identifier to the UPF.
#### 5.8.2.9 Functionality of Sending of \"End marker\"
##### 5.8.2.9.0 Introduction
Sending of \"end marker\" is a functionality which involve SMF and UPF in
order to assist the reordering function in the Target RAN. As part of the
functionality, constructing of end marker packets can either be done in the
SMF or in the UPF, as described in clauses 5.8.2.9.1 and 5.8.2.9.2. Whether
constructing of end marker packets is performed by SMF or UPF is determined by
network configuration.
##### 5.8.2.9.1 UPF Constructing the \"End marker\" Packets
In the case of inter NG-RAN Handover procedure without UPF change, SMF shall
indicate the UPF to switch the N3 path(s) by sending an N4 Session
Modification Request message with the new AN Tunnel Info of NG RAN and in
addition, provide an indication to the UPF to send the end marker packet(s) on
the old N3 user plane path.
On receiving this indication, the UPF shall construct end marker packet(s) and
send it for each N3 GTP-U tunnel towards the source NG RAN after sending the
last PDU on the old path.
In the case of inter NG-RAN Handover procedure with change of the UPF
terminating N3, the SMF shall request the UPF with N9 reference point to the
UPF terminating N3 to switch the N9 user plane path(s) by sending an N4
Session Modification Request message (N4 session ID, new CN Tunnel Info of the
UPF terminating N3) and in addition, provide an indication to this UPF to send
the end marker packet(s) on the old path.
On receiving this indication, the UPF shall construct end marker packet(s) and
send it for each N9 GTP-U tunnel towards the source UPF after sending the last
PDU on the old path.
On receiving the end marker packet(s) on N9 GTP-U tunnel, source UPF shall
forward the end marker packet(s) and send it for each N3 GTP-U tunnel towards
the source NG RAN.
##### 5.8.2.9.2 SMF Constructing the \"End marker\" Packets
UPF referred in this clause is the UPF terminates N3 reference point.
It is assumed that the PDU Session for the UE comprises of an UPF that acts as
a PDU Session Anchor and an intermediate UPF terminating N3 reference point at
the time of this Handover procedure.
In the case of inter NG-RAN Handover procedure without UPF change, SMF shall
indicate the UPF to switch the N3 path(s) by sending an N4 Session
Modification Request message (N4 session ID, new AN Tunnel Info of NG RAN).
After sending the last PDU on the old path, UPF shall replace the old AN
Tunnel Info with the new one and responds with an N4 Session Modification
Response message to acknowledge the success of path switch.
When the path switch is finished, SMF constructs the end marker packet(s) and
sends it to the UPF. UPF then forwards the packet(s) to the source NG RAN.
In the case of inter NG-RAN Handover procedure with UPF change, SMF shall
indicate the PSA UPF to switch the N9 user plane path(s) by sending an N4
Session Modification Request message (N4 session ID, new CN Tunnel Info of
UPF). After sending the last PDU on the old N9 path, PSA UPF shall replace the
old CN Tunnel Info with the new one and responds with an N4 Session
Modification Response message to acknowledge the success of path switch.
When the path switch is finished, SMF constructs the end marker packet(s) and
sends it to PSA UPF. PSA UPF then forwards the packet(s) to the source UPF.
#### 5.8.2.10 UP Tunnel Management
5GC shall support per PDU Session tunnelling on N3 between (R)AN and UPF and
N9 between UPFs. If there exist more than one UPF involved for the PDU
Session, any tunnel(s) between UPFs (e.g. in the case of two UPFs, between the
UPF that is an N3 terminating point and the UPF for PDU Session Anchor)
remains established when a UE enters CM-IDLE state. In the case of downlink
data buffering by UPF, when mobile terminated (MT) traffic arrives at the PDU
Session Anchor UPF, it is forwarded to the UPF which buffer the data packet
via N9 tunnel. See clause 5.8.3 for more details on UPF buffering. In the case
of Home Routed roaming, the SMF in HPLMN is not aware of the UP activation
state of a PDU Session.
When the UP connection of the PDU Session is deactivated, the SMF may release
the UPF of N3 terminating point. In that case the UPF (e.g. the Branching
Point/UL CL or PDU Session Anchor) connecting to the released UPF of N3
terminating point will buffer the DL packets. Otherwise, when the UPF with the
N3 connection is not released, this UPF will buffer the DL packets.
When the UP connection of the PDU Session is activated due to a down-link data
arrived and a new UPF is allocated to terminate the N3 connection, a data
forwarding tunnel between the UPF that has buffered packets and the newly
allocated UPF is established, so that the buffered data packets are
transferred from the old UPF that has buffered packets to the newly allocated
UPF via the data forwarding tunnel.
For a PDU Session whose the UP connection is deactivated and the SMF has
subscribed the location change notification, when the SMF is notified of UE\'s
new location from the AMF and detects that the UE has moved out of the service
area of the existing intermediate UPF, the SMF may decide to maintain the
intermediate UPF, remove the established tunnel between UPFs (in the case of
removal of the intermediate UPF) or reallocate the tunnel between UPFs (in the
case of reallocation of the intermediate UPF).
#### 5.8.2.11 Parameters for N4 session management
##### 5.8.2.11.1 General
These parameters are used by SMF to control the functionality of the UPF as
well as to inform SMF about events occurring at the UPF.
The N4 session management procedures defined in clause 4.4.1 of TS 23.502 [3]
will use the relevant parameters in the same way for all N4 reference points:
the N4 Session Establishment procedure as well as the N4 Session Modification
procedure provide the control parameters to the UPF, the N4 Session Release
procedure removes all control parameters related to an N4 session, and the N4
Session Level Reporting procedure informs the SMF about events related to the
PDU Session that are detected by the UPF.
The parameters over N4 reference point provided from SMF to UPF comprises an
N4 Session ID and may also contain:
\- Packet Detection Rules (PDR) that contain information to classify traffic
(PDU(s)) arriving at the UPF;
\- Forwarding Action Rules (FAR) that contain information on whether
forwarding, dropping or buffering is to be applied to a traffic identified by
PDR(s);
\- Multi-Access Rules (MAR) that contain information on how to handle traffic
steering, switching and splitting for a MA PDU Session;
\- Usage Reporting Rules (URR) contains information that defines how traffic
identified by PDR(s) shall be accounted as well as how a certain measurement
shall be reported;
\- QoS Enforcement Rules (QER), that contain information related to QoS
enforcement of traffic identified by PDR(s);
\- Session Reporting Rules (SRR) that contain information to request the UP
function to detect and report events for a PDU session that are not related to
specific PDRs of the PDU session or that are not related to traffic usage
measurement.
\- Trace Requirements;
\- Port Management Information Container in 5GS;
\- Bridge Information.
The N4 Session ID is assigned by the SMF and uniquely identifies an N4
session.
If the UPF indicated support of Trace, the SMF may activate a trace session
during a N4 Session Establishment or a N4 Session Modification procedure. In
that case it provides Trace Requirements to the UPF. The SMF may deactivate an
on-going trace session using a N4 Session Modification procedure. There shall
be at most one trace session activated per N4 Session at a time.
For the MA PDU Session, the SMF may add an additional access tunnel
information during an N4 Session Modification procedure by updating MAR with
addition of an FAR ID which refers to an FAR containing the additional access
tunnel information for the MA PDU session for traffic steering in the UPF. For
the MA PDU Session, the SMF may request Access Availability report per N4
Session, during N4 Session Establishment procedure or N4 Session Modification
procedure.
A N4 Session may be used to control both UPF and NW-TT behaviour in the UPF. A
N4 session support and enable exchange of TSN bridge configuration between the
SMF and the UPF:
\- Information that the SMF needs for bridge management (clause 5.8.2.11.9);
\- Information that 5GS transparently relays between the TSN AF or NEF and the
NW-TT: transparent Port Management Information Container along with the
associated NW-TT port number.
\- Information that 5GS transparently relays between the TSN AF or NEF and the
NW-TT: transparent user plane node Management Information Container (clause
5.8.2.11.14).
When a N4 Session related with bridge management is established, the UPF
allocates a dedicated port number for the DS-TT side of the PDU Session. The
UPF then provides to the SMF following configuration parameters for the N4
Session:
\- DS-TT port number.
\- user-plane node ID.
To support TSN, the user-plane node ID is Bridge ID. The User Plane Node
ID/Bridge ID may be pre-configured in the UPF based on deployment.
After the N4 session has been established, the SMF and UPF may at any time
exchange transparent user plane node and Port Management Information Container
over a N4 session.
##### 5.8.2.11.2 N4 Session Context
N4 Session Context is identified by an N4 Session ID. An N4 Session Context is
generated by SMF and UPF respectively to store the parameters related to an N4
session, including the N4 session ID and following information (see TS 29.244
[65] for an exhaustive list):
1) general session related parameters such as S-NSSAI, PDU Session Type, Trace
Information, APN/DNN, ATSSS Control Information;
2) the PDRs, URRs, QERs, BAR(s), FARs, MARs used for this N4 session;
3) parameters sent to support UPF statistics.
The UPF may use parameters listed above in bullets 1) (e.g. S-NSSAI) and 2)
(e.g. Network Instance in PDR/FAR(s)) for determining internal UPF resources.
##### 5.8.2.11.3 Packet Detection Rule
The following table describes the Packet Detection Rule (PDR) containing
information required to classify a packet arriving at the UPF. Every PDR is
used to detect packets in a certain transmission direction, e.g. UL direction
or DL direction.
Table 5.8.2.11.3-1: Attributes within Packet Detection Rule

##### 5.8.2.11.7 Usage Report generated by UPF
The UPF sends the Usage Report to inform the SMF about the measurement of an
active URR or about the detection of application traffic of an active Packet
Detection Rule. For each URR, the Usage Report may be generated repeatedly,
i.e. as long as any one of the valid event triggers applies. A final Usage
Report is sent for a URR when it is no longer active, i.e. either the URR is
removed or all the references to this URR in any of the Packet Detection Rules
belonging to the N4 session.

available. For the IP PDU Session Type, the DSCP in TOS (IPv4) / TC (IPv6)
value from the IP header of the downlink packet will also be reported. This is
used for downlink data notification related to QoS Flows. Downlink Data Status
Indicates that the first downlink packet has been buffered or discarded for a
service data flow at the UPF. This is used for downlink data delivery status
notification related to individual services.
#### 5.8.2.12 Reporting of the UE MAC addresses used in a PDU Session
For Ethernet PDU Session type, the SMF may control the UPF to report the
different MAC (Ethernet) addresses used as source address of frames sent UL by
the UE in a PDU Session. These MAC addresses are called UE MAC addresses.
This control and the corresponding reporting takes place over N4.
NOTE: This is e.g. used to support reporting of all UE MAC addresses in a PDU
Session to the PCF as described in clause 5.6.10.2.
The UPF reports the removal of a UE MAC address based on the detection of
absence of traffic during an inactivity time. The inactivity time value is
provided by the SMF to the UPF.
#### 5.8.2.13 Support for 5G VN group communication
##### 5.8.2.13.0 General
The SMF may configure the UPF(s) to apply different traffic forwarding methods
to route traffic between PDU Sessions for a single 5G VN group. For example,
depending on the destination address, some packet flows may be forwarded
locally, while other packet flows are forwarded via N19 and other packet flows
are forwarded to N6.
The UPF local switching, N6-based forwarding and N19-based forwarding methods
require that a common SMF is controlling the PSA UPFs for the 5G VN group.
5G VN group communication includes one to one communication and one to many
communication. One to one communication supports forwarding of unicast traffic
between two UEs within a 5G VN, or between a UE and a device on the DN. One to
many communication supports forwarding of multicast traffic and broadcast
traffic from one UE (or device on the DN) to many/all UEs within a 5G VN and
devices on the DN.
Traffic forwarding within the 5G VN group is realized by using a UPF internal
interface (\"5G VN internal\") and a two-step detection and forwarding
process. In the first step, the packets received from any 5G VN group member
(via it\'s PDU Session, via N6 or via N19) are forwarded to the UPF internal
interface (i.e. Destination Interface set to \"5G VN internal\"). In the
second step, PDRs installed at the UPF internal interface (i.e. Source
Interface set to \"5G VN internal\") detect the packet and forward it to the
respective 5G VN group member (via it\'s PDU Session, via N6 or via N19). The
details of the PDR and FAR configuration are described in the following
clauses.
For UEs belonging to the same 5G VN group and having PDU Sessions that
correspond to N4 Sessions in the same PSA UPF, the following applies for
traffic that is sent from one of these UEs to another one of these UEs using
local switching: The incoming traffic for one PDU Session will match the
corresponding N4 Session\'s PDR(s) of the source PDU Session (based on GTP-U
header information). The traffic is then sent back to classification in that
UPF (via the internal interface) and will match another N4 Session
corresponding to the destination PDU Session (based on destination address in
the PDU). The PDU is then forwarded to the target UE.
If 5G VN group members\' PDU Sessions are served by different PSA UPFs and
N19-based forwarding is applied, the SMF creates a group-level N4 Session with
each involved UPF to enable N19-based forwarding and N6-based forwarding. When
the traffic is then sent back to classification in that UPF (via the internal
interface) it may match group-level N4 Session corresponding to the 5G VN
group (based on destination address in the PDU or a default PDR rule with
match-all packet filter). The PDU is then forwarded to N6 or to the UPF
indicated in the group-level N4 Session via corresponding N19 tunnel. This
enables the PDU to be sent to the target group member in the other UPF or to
the device in the DN.
In the case of N19-based forwarding is not applied for a 5G VN group, group
level N4 session is not required.
If more than one 5G VN group has to be supported in the PLMN, the N4 rule
attribute Network Instance is used in addition to the UPF internal interface
and set to a value representing the 5G VN group. This keeps the traffic of
different 5G VN groups separate from each other and thus enables isolation of
the 5G VN group communication during the packet detection and forwarding
process. The SMF shall provide the PDRs and FARs related to the UPF internal
interface as follows whenever more than one 5G VN group has to be supported in
the PLMN:
\- The FAR with Destination Interface set to \"5G VN internal\" shall also
contain the Network Instance set to the value representing the 5G VN group.
\- The PDR with Source Interface set to \"5G VN internal\" shall also contain
the Network Instance set to the value representing the 5G VN group.
Forwarding Ethernet unicast traffic towards the PDU Session corresponding to
the Destination MAC address of an Ethernet frame may correspond:
\- either to the SMF explicitly configuring DL PDR(s) with the MAC addresses
detected by the UPF on PDU Sessions and reported to the SMF; this is further
described in clause 5.8.2.13.1;
\- or to the SMF relying on MAC address learning in UPF as defined in clause
5.8.2.5.3. To request this UPF behaviour the SMF sets the Ethernet PDU Session
Information indication in the DL PDR of the \"5G VN internal\" interface
related with a 5G VN group. This may apply in the case that all PDU Sessions
related with this 5G VN group are served by the same PSA or by multiple PSAs
not inter-connected via N19.
For Ethernet traffic on 5G-VN, in the former case above where SMF explicitly
configures DL PDR with the MAC addresses detected on PDU Sessions supporting a
5G VN group, the SMF acts as a central controller which is responsible for
setting up the forwarding rules in the UPFs so that it avoids forwarding
loops. The SMF becomes aware of the MAC addresses in use within a 5G VN group
by the UPF\'s reporting of the MAC addresses. The SMF is responsible to react
to topology changes in the Ethernet network. Local switching without SMF
involvement is not specified for a 5G-VN when different PDU Sessions related
with this 5G VN group may be served by different PSA(s) connected over N19.
NOTE: The mechanisms described above implies signalling on N4 Sessions related
with a VN group each time a new MAC address is detected as used (or no more
used) within a PDU Session related with this 5G VN group. Hence the usage of
the solution with SMF explicitly configuring DL PDR with the MAC addresses
defined in this release can raise signalling scalability issues for large VN
groups with lots of devices (MAC addresses) served by PDU sessions related
with this VN group.
##### 5.8.2.13.1 Support for unicast traffic forwarding of a 5G VN
To enable unicast traffic forwarding in a UPF, the following applies:
\- The SMF provides for each 5G VN group member\'s N4 Session (i.e. N4 Session
corresponding to PDU Session) the following N4 rules that enable the
processing of packets received from this UE.
\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set to
\"access side\", and CN Tunnel Information set to PDU Session tunnel header
(i.e. N3 or N9 GTP-U F-TEID); and
\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Destination Interface set
to \"5G VN internal\".
\- The SMF provides for each 5G VN group member\'s N4 Session (i.e. N4 session
corresponding to PDU Session) the following N4 rules that enable the
processing of packets towards this UE.
\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set to
\"5G VN internal\", and Destination Address set to the IP/MAC address (es) of
this 5G VN group member; and
\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Outer Header Creation
indicating the N3/N9 tunnel information, and Destination Interface set
\"access side\".
\- If N19-based forwarding is applied, the SMF configures the group-level N4
Session for processing packets received from a N19 tunnel with the following
N4 rules for each N19 tunnel.
\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set to
\"core side\", and CN Tunnel Information set to N19 tunnel header (i.e. N19
GTP-U F-TEID); and
\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Destination Interface set
to \"5G VN internal\".
\- If N19-based forwarding is applied, the SMF configures the group-level N4
Session for processing packets towards 5G VN group members anchored at other
UPFs with the following N4 rules for each N19 tunnel.
\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set to
\"5G VN internal\", and Destination Address set to the IP/MAC address (es) of
UEs anchored at the peer UPF of this N19 tunnel; and
\- in order to forward the traffic to a 5G VN group member anchored at another
UPF via the N19 tunnel, a FAR containing Outer Header Creation indicating the
N19 tunnel information, Destination Interface set to \"core side\".
\- The SMF configures the group-level N4 Session for processing packets
received from a 5G VN group member connected via N6 with the following N4
rules.
\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set to
\"core side\", and Source Address set to the IP/MAC address (es) of this 5G VN
group member; and
\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Destination Interface set
to \"5G VN internal\".
\- The SMF configures the group-level N4 Session for processing packets
towards a 5G VN group member connected via N6 or packets towards a device
residing in DN with the following N4 rules.
\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set to
\"5G VN internal\", and Destination Address set to the IP/MAC address (es) of
this 5G VN group member; and
\- in order to forward the traffic to the 5G VN group member or device via N6,
a FAR containing Destination Interface set to \"core side\".
\- The SMF shall update N4 rules for group-level N4 Session to enable correct
forwarding of packets towards UE who\'s PSA UPF has been reallocated and
address is unchanged.
\- The SMF may also configure the following N4 rules for the group-level N4
Session to process packets with an unknown destination address:
\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set to
\"5G VN internal\", a match-all Packet Filter, and a Precedence set to the
lowest precedence value; and
\- in order to process the traffic, a FAR containing Destination Interface set
to \"core side\" to route the traffic via N6 by default, or in the case of
local SMF configuration that N6-based forwarding is not applied a FAR
instructing the UPF to drop the traffic.
##### 5.8.2.13.2 Support for unicast traffic forwarding update due to UE
mobility
To enable the service continuity when the PSA UPF serving the UE changed, the
following applies:
\- Keep the UE address unchanged if N6-based forwarding is not used.
\- Configure the UE\'s N4 Session with N4 rules (PDR, FAR) to detect and
forward the traffic to this UE via its PDU Session tunnel(i.e. N3 tunnel) on
the target PSA UPF.
\- If N19-based forwarding is applied: To switch the traffic towards this UE
from the source PSA UPF to the target PSA UPF for N19-based forwarding, the
SMF deletes the N4 rule (PDR) that detects the traffic towards this UE in the
group-level N4 Session at UPFs involved in the 5G VN group (except the source
PSA UPF), then adds or updates the PDR that detects the traffic towards this
UE with the FAR containing the N19 tunnel information of the target PSA UPF in
the group-level N4 Session at UPFs involved in the 5G VN group (except the
target PSA UPF).
##### 5.8.2.13.3 Support for user plane traffic replication in a 5G VN
##### 5.8.2.13.3.1 User plane traffic replication based on UPF internal
functionality {#user-plane-traffic-replication-based-on-upf-internal-
functionality .H6}
For Ethernet PDU Sessions, the SMF may instruct the UPF to route traffic to be
replicated as described in clause 5.8.2.5.
For IP PDU Session types, the SMF may instruct the UPF to manage IP multicast
traffic as described in clauses 4.6.6 and 7.7.1 of TS 23.316 [84]. The UPF
replicates the IP multicast traffic received from PDU Sessions or N6 interface
and sends the packets over other PDU Sessions and other N6 interface
subscribed to the IP Multicast groups.
Mechanisms described in clauses 4.6.6 and 7.7.1 of TS 23.316 [84] apply to
support 5G VN group communication with following clarifications:
\- These mechanisms are not limited to Wireline access and can apply on any
access,
\- IP Multicast traffic allowed for a PDU Session is not meant for IPTV
services reachable over N6,
\- IGMP /MLD signalling does not relate with STB or 5G-RG: Clauses 4.6.6 and
7.7.1 of TS 23.316 [84], apply to UE members of a 5G VN group instead of
5G-RG, and
\- Clauses 7.7.1.1.2 and 7.7.1.1.4 of TS 23.316 [84] are not applicable to 5G
VN groups: members of the 5G VN groups may receive any multicast traffic
associated with the (DNN, S-NSSAI) of the 5G VN group.
\- UPF exchange of signalling such as PIM (Protocol-Independent Multicast) may
apply as defined in TS 23.316, with following clarification:
\- PIM signalling is generally exchanged over N6 but may be sent towards the
PDU Session supporting the source address of multicast traffic identified by
IGMP / MLD signalling for Source Specific Multicast. In the case of IGMP / MLD
signalling not related with Source Specific Multicast no PIM signalling is
sent towards any PDU Session
##### 5.8.2.13.3.2 User plane traffic replication based on PDRs with
replication instructions {#user-plane-traffic-replication-based-on-pdrs-with-
replication-instructions .H6}
Alternatively, for IP or Ethernet type data communication, the SMF instructs
the UPF via PDRs and FARs how to replicate user plane traffic.
The mechanism is supported in the following conditions:
\- When N19 is used, there is a full mesh of N19 tunnels between UPFs serving
the 5G VN group;
\- There is no support of forwarding packets with destination MAC address not
known by SMF/UPF (i.e. no support for new UE MAC addresses from the UE during
the PDU Session lifetime)
\- There is no support for forwarding a broadcast/multicast packet with source
address not known to SMF/UPF.
\- Each UPF supports one N6 interface instance towards the data network, or
only supports N19-based forwarding without N6;
\- Multicast group formation of selected members of a 5G VN for Ethernet type
data communication is not described in this release of the specification.
In this case, when the UPF receives a broadcast packet of a 5G VN group from
N19 or N6, it shall distribute it to all 5G VN group members connected to this
UPF. When the UPF receives a broadcast packet from a UE (source UE) via PDU
Session associated with a 5G VN group, it shall distribute it to:
\- All 5G VN group members (except the source UE) connected to this UPF via
local switch, and
\- All 5G VN group members connected to other UPFs via N19-based forwarding,
and
\- The devices on the DN via N6-based forwarding.
To enable broadcast traffic forwarding of a 5G VN group in a UPF, the
following applies:
\- The SMF provides group-level N4 Session and each 5G VN group member\' N4
Session with the PDR that detect the broadcast packet sent via \"internal
interface\". When UPF receives the broadcast packets sent via \"internal
interface\", it matches the broadcast packet against all PDRs installed at the
\"internal interface\". A successful matching with a PDR that detect the
broadcast packet instructs the UPF to continue the lookup of the other PDRs. A
matching PDR that detects the broadcast packet shall instruct the UPF to
duplicate the broadcast packet and perform processing (using associated FAR,
URR, QER) on the copy instead of the original packet if the broadcast packet
does not satisfy the packet replication skip information, otherwise the PDR
instructs the UPF to skip the processing of the broadcast packet.
\- The broadcast packets received from N19 or N6 are forwarded to the UPF
internal interface together with a N19 or N6 indication.
\- The SMF provides for each 5G VN group member\' N4 Session (i.e. N4 session
corresponding to PDU Session) the following N4 rules that enable the
processing of broadcast packets towards this UE.
\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set to
\"5G VN internal\", Destination Address set to the broadcast address, the
Packet replication skip information set to the IP/MAC address (es) of this 5G
VN group member, and the indication to carry on matching; and
\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Outer Header Creation
indicating the PDU Session tunnel information, and Destination Interface set
\"access side\".
\- The SMF configures the group-level N4 Session for processing packets
received from a N19 tunnel with the following N4 rules for each N19 tunnel.
\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set to
\"core side\", Destination Address set to the broadcast address, and CN Tunnel
Information set to N19 tunnel header (i.e. N19 GTP-U TEID); and
\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Destination Interface set
to \"5G VN internal\", Outer Header Creation with the N19 indication.
\- The SMF provides for the group-level N4 Session the following N4 rules that
enable the processing of broadcast packets towards the other UPFs.
\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set to
\"5G VN internal\", Destination Address set to the broadcast address, the
Packet replication skip information set to the N19 indication, and the
indication to carry on matching; and
\- in order to forward the traffic to each involved UPF via the corresponding
N19 tunnel, a FAR containing \"Duplication\" instruction, Outer Header
Creation indicating the N19 tunnel information, Destination Interface set to
\"core side\".
\- The SMF configures the group-level N4 Session for processing packets
received from N6 with the following N4 rules.
\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set to
\"core side\", and Destination Address set to the broadcast address; and
\- in order to forward the traffic, a FAR containing Destination Interface set
to \"5G VN internal\", Outer Header Creation with the N6 indication.
\- The SMF provides for the group-level N4 Session the following N4 rules that
enable the processing of broadcast packets towards N6.
\- in order to detect the traffic, a PDR containing Source Interface set to
\"5G VN internal\", a match-all packet filter, and the Packet replication skip
information set to the N6 indication; and
\- in order to forward the traffic to N6, a FAR containing Destination
Interface set to \"core side\".
In this case, to enable multicast traffic forwarding of a 5G VN group in a
UPF, broadcast traffic forwarding of a 5G VN applies to multicast traffic
forwarding of a 5G VN with the following modifications:
\- The SMF installs PDRs for the multicast address instead of the broadcast
address.
\- The PDRs and FARs are installed for PDU Sessions corresponding to the
members of the multicast group.
\- In addition, the SMF installs the PDR identifying IGMP/MLD signalling for
each 5G VN group member\' N4 Session and a URR with a Reporting Trigger set to
\"IGMP reporting\" for IGMP or set to \"MLD reporting\" for MLD. Based on the
IP Multicast address in \"IP multicast join\" or \"IP multicast leave\"
reports received from UPF, the SMF manipulates (delete or add) the PDR
identifying the multicast traffic for the reported IP Multicast address at the
corresponding 5G VN group member\' N4 Session, and if required at the group-
level N4 Session at the UPF(s) of the 5G VN group.
#### 5.8.2.14 Inter PLMN User Plane Security functionality
Operators can deploy UPF(s) supporting the Inter PLMN User Plane Security
(IPUPS) functionality at the border of their network to protect their networks
from invalid inter PLMN N9 traffic.
The IPUPS functionality forwards GTP-U packets (received via the N9 interface)
only if they belong to an active PDU Session and are not malformed, as
described in TS 33.501 [29].
The SMF can activate the IPUPS functionality together with other UP
functionality in the same UPF, or insert a separate UPF in the UP path for the
IPUPS functionality. In both cases the UPF with IPUPS functionality is
controlled by the SMF via the N4 interface.
#### 5.8.2.15 Reporting of satellite backhaul to SMF
If the AMF is aware that a satellite backhaul with long delay is used towards
5G AN, the AMF may report this to SMF as part of the PDU Session establishment
procedure as described in clause 4.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. If AMF is aware that
satellite backhaul category changes (e.g. at handover), the AMF reports the
current satellite backhaul category and indicates the satellite backhaul
category change to SMF.
Satellite backhaul category refers to the type of the satellite (i.e. GEO,
MEO, LEO or OTHERSAT) used in the backhaul. Only a single backhaul category
can be indicated.
NOTE: It is assumed that the AMF can determine the Satellite backhaul category
for the notification to the SMF based on local configuration, e.g. based on
Global RAN Node IDs associated with satellite backhaul.
#### 5.8.2.16 Support for L2TP tunnelling on N6
If requested by the SMF during N4 Session Establishment, the UPF (PSA) may
setup L2TP towards an L2TP network server (LNS) in the DN and tunnel the PDU
Session user plane traffic in this L2TP tunnel. In this case the UPF acts as a
L2TP access concentrator (LAC).
To enable this, the SMF may provide L2TP information to the UPF, such as LNS
IP address and/or LNS host name, as described in TS 29.244 [65]. This L2TP
information may be configured on the SMF as part of the DNN configuration or
received from the DN-AAA Server during secondary authentication/authorization,
as described in clause 5.6.6. Alternatively, the L2TP tunnel parameters may be
configured in the UPF Function. The L2TP tunnel parameters include necessary
parameters for setting up L2TP tunnel towards the LNS (e.g. LNS address,
tunnel password, etc.).
In addition, the SMF may provide PAP/CHAP authentication information to the
UPF, for use in L2TP session establishment, in case it was received from the
UE in the PDU Session Establishment Request.
When L2TP is to be used for a PDU Session, the SMF may select a UPF based upon
support of this feature. The SMF determines whether the UPF supports this
feature via N4 capability negotiation during N4 Association Setup or via NRF
discovery.
If SMF requests the UPF to allocate UE IP address, as described in clause
5.8.2.2.1, the UPF (LAC) may retrieve this IP address from the LNS. In
addition, if the SMF requests the UPF to provide DNS address(es), the UPF
(LAC) may request the LNS to provide DNS address(es) and report such DNS
address(es) to the SMF.
### 5.8.3 Explicit Buffer Management
#### 5.8.3.1 General
5GC supports buffering of UE\'s downlink packets for deactivated PDU Sessions.
Support for buffering in the UPF is mandatory and optional in the SMF.
When the UP connection of a PDU Session is deactivated, buffering in UPF can
be activated by the SMF. If the SMF supports buffering capability, the SMF can
decide to activate buffering in SMF instead of buffering in UPF.
#### 5.8.3.2 Buffering at UPF
When the SMF decided to activate buffering in UPF, the SMF shall inform the
UPF to start buffering packets for this PDU Session.
The SMF provides instructions to the UPF for at least the following behaviour:
\- buffer downlink packets with the following additional options:
\- reporting the arrival of first downlink packet (for a QoS Flow or a service
data flow), and/or
\- reporting the first discarded downlink packet (for a service data flow), or
\- drop downlink packets with the following additional options:
\- reporting the first discarded downlink packet (for a service data flow).
\- buffer uplink packets.
When the SMF instructs the UPF for a service data flow to buffer downlink
packets and to report the first discarded downlink packet, the SMF shall also
instruct the UPF to report the arrival of the first downlink packet for this
service data flow to enable the SMF check if this is also the first report for
the QoS Flow (as described below).
Buffering in the UPF may be configured based on timers or the amount of
downlink data to be buffered. The SMF decides whether buffering timers or
amount of downlink data are handled by the UPF or SMF.
After starting buffering, when the first downlink packet (of a QoS Flow or a
service data flow) arrives, UPF shall inform the SMF if it is setup to report.
UPF sends a Downlink Data Report to the SMF via N4 unless specified otherwise
and indicates the PDR by which the downlink packet was received. If the SMF
receives a Downlink Data Report for a service data flow, the SMF shall also
check if this is the first report for the QoS Flow corresponding to the PDR.
If so, the SMF shall also proceed as described in clause 5.4.3.1.
After starting buffering, when the first downlink packet (of a service data
flow) in a configured period of time that has been buffered is discarded by
the UPF because the configured buffering time or amount of downlink data to be
buffered is exceeded, the UPF shall inform the SMF if it is setup to report.
UPF sends a Downlink Data Report to the SMF via N4 and indicates the PDR by
which the discarded downlink packet was received.
A new report is sent if the SMF terminates and subsequently re-activates the
buffering action at the UPF and the UPF again receives downlink packets.
NOTE: For the notification about the downlink data delivery status
\"buffered\" or \"discarded\" related to packets from a particular AF as part
of the Nsmf_EventExposure service, it is expected that a PDR with a traffic
filter identifying that AF as source and a Forwarding Action rule with action
\"buffer\" is installed.
When the UP connection of the PDU Session is activated, the SMF updates the
UPF of the change in buffering state. The buffered downlink packets, if any,
are then forwarded to the (R)AN by the UPF.
If the UP connection of the PDU Session has been deactivated for a long time,
the SMF may indicate the UPF to stop buffering for this PDU Session.
The SMF may indicate to the UPF to start or stop the buffering of uplink
packets of an application associated to the PCC rule as described in clause
6.3.5 of TS 23.548 [130]. When the buffering of uplink packets is stopped the
UPF shall forward all buffered uplink packets before it forwards any new
uplink packets.
#### 5.8.3.3 Buffering at SMF
When the SMF supports buffering capability and the SMF decided to activate
buffering in SMF for the PDU Session, the SMF shall inform the UPF to start
forwarding the downlink packets towards the SMF.
When the UP connection of the PDU Session is activated, if there are buffered
downlink packets available and their buffering duration has not expired, the
SMF shall forward those packets to the UPF to relay them to the UE. These
packets are then forwarded by the UPF to the (R)AN.
### 5.8.4 SMF Pause of Charging
The SMF Pause of Charging functionality is supported with the purpose that the
charging and usage monitoring data in the core network more accurately
reflects the downlink traffic actually sent to the (R)AN. When the amount of
downlink data incoming at the UPF for a PDU Session that is in deactivated
state goes above a pre-configured threshold, the pause of charging
functionality ensures that data that dropped in the core network is not
included in charging and usage monitoring records.
The procedures for SMF Pause of Charging are described in TS 23.502 [3].
## 5.9 Identifiers
### 5.9.1 General
Each subscriber in the 5G System shall be allocated one 5G Subscription
Permanent Identifier (SUPI) for use within the 3GPP system. The 5G System
supports identification of subscriptions independently of identification of
the user equipment. Each UE accessing the 5G System shall be assigned a
Permanent Equipment Identifier (PEI).
The 5G System supports allocation of a temporary identifier (5G-GUTI) in order
to support user confidentiality protection.
### 5.9.2 Subscription Permanent Identifier
A globally unique 5G Subscription Permanent Identifier (SUPI) shall be
allocated to each subscriber in the 5G System and provisioned in the UDM/UDR.
The SUPI is used only inside 3GPP system, and its privacy is _specified in TS
33.501 [29]._
The SUPI may contain:
\- an IMSI as defined in TS 23.003 [19], or
\- a network-specific identifier, used for private networks as defined in TS
22.261 [2].
\- a GLI and an operator identifier of the 5GC operator, used for supporting
FN-BRGs, as further described in TS 23.316 [84].
\- a GCI and an operator identifier of the 5GC operator, used for supporting
FN-CRGs and 5G-CRG, as further described in TS 23.316 [84].
A SUPI containing a network-specific identifier shall take the form of a
Network Access Identifier (NAI) using the NAI RFC 7542 [20] based user
identification as defined in TS 23.003 [19].
When UE needs to indicate its SUPI to the network (e.g. as part of the
Registration procedure), the UE provides the SUPI in concealed form as defined
in TS 23.003 [19].
In order to enable roaming scenarios, the SUPI shall contain the address of
the home network (e.g. the MCC and MNC in the case of an IMSI based SUPI).
For interworking with the EPC, the SUPI allocated to the 3GPP UE shall always
be based on an IMSI to enable the UE to present an IMSI to the EPC.
The usage of SUPI for W-5GAN is further specified in TS 23.316 [84].
### 5.9.2a Subscription Concealed Identifier
The Subscription Concealed Identifier (SUCI) is a privacy preserving
identifier containing the concealed SUPI. It is specified in TS 33.501 [29].
The usage of SUCI for W-5GAN access is further specified in TS 23.316 [84].
### 5.9.3 Permanent Equipment Identifier
A Permanent Equipment Identifier (PEI) is defined for the 3GPP UE accessing
the 5G System.
The PEI can assume different formats for different UE types and use cases. The
UE shall present the PEI to the network together with an indication of the PEI
format being used.
If the UE supports at least one 3GPP access technology (i.e. NG-RAN, E-UTRAN,
UTRAN or GERAN), the UE must be allocated a PEI in the IMEI or IMEISV format.
If a UE has registered with a network by using a network subscription and a
PEI of the UE, then the UE shall keep the PEI to be used with the network
subscription and shall not use that PEI with another network subscription
while the UE is in registered state in the network.
In the scope of this release, the PEI may be one of the following:
\- for UEs that support at least one 3GPP access technology, an IMEI or
IMEISV, as defined in TS 23.003 [19];
\- PEI used in the case of W-5GAN access as further specified in TS 23.316
[84].
\- for UEs not supporting any 3GPP access technologies, the IEEE Extended
Unique Identifier EUI-64 [113] of the access technology the UE uses to connect
to the 5GC.
### 5.9.4 5G **Globally Unique** Temporary Identifier
The AMF shall allocate a 5G Globally Unique Temporary Identifier (5G-GUTI) to
the UE that is common to both 3GPP and non-3GPP access. It shall be possible
to use the same 5G-GUTI for accessing 3GPP access and non-3GPP access security
context within the AMF for the given UE. An AMF may re-assign a new 5G-GUTI to
the UE at any time. The AMF provides a new 5G-GUTI to the UE under the
conditions specified in clause 6.12.3 of TS 33.501 [29]. When the UE is in CM-
IDLE, the AMF may delay providing the UE with a new 5G-GUTI until the next NAS
transaction.
The 5G-GUTI shall be structured as:
\ := \ \
where GUAMI identifies one or more AMF(s).
When the GUAMI identifies only one AMF, the 5G-TMSI identifies the UE uniquely
within the AMF. However, when AMF assigns a 5G-GUTI to the UE with a GUAMI
value used by more than one AMF, the AMF shall ensure that the 5G-TMSI value
used within the assigned 5G-GUTI is not already in use by the other AMF(s)
sharing that GUAMI value.
The Globally Unique AMF ID (GUAMI) shall be structured as:
\ := \ \ \ \ \
where AMF Region ID identifies the region, AMF Set ID uniquely identifies the
AMF Set within the AMF Region and AMF Pointer identifies one or more AMFs
within the AMF Set.
NOTE 1: The AMF Region ID addresses the case that there are more AMFs in the
network than the number of AMFs that can be supported by AMF Set ID and AMF
Pointer by enabling operators to re-use the same AMF Set IDs and AMF Pointers
in different regions.
NOTE 2: In the case of SNPNs, the PLMN IDs may be shared among SNPNs such that
the constructed GUAMIs are not globally unique. However, PLMN ID and NID are
provided together, separate from the GUAMI, to uniquely identify selected or
supported SNPN in RRC and N2.
NOTE 3: See TS 23.003 [19] for details on the structure of the fields of
GUAMI.
The 5G-S-TMSI is the shortened form of the GUTI to enable more efficient radio
signalling procedures (e.g. during Paging and Service Request) and is defined
as:
\ := \ \ \
As specified in TS 38.304 [50] and TS 36.304 [52] for 3GPP access, the NG-RAN
uses the 10 Least Significant Bits of the 5G-TMSI in the determination of the
time at which different UEs are paged. Hence, the AMF shall ensure that the 10
Least Significant Bits of the 5G-TMSI are evenly distributed.
As specified in TS 38.331 [28] and TS 36.331 [51] for 3GPP access, the NG-
RAN\'s RRC Connection Establishment\'s contention resolution process assumes
that there is a low probability of the same 5G-TMSI being allocated by
different AMFs to different UEs. The AMFs\' process for allocating the 5G-TMSI
should take this account.
NOTE 4: To achieve this, the AMF could, for example, use a random seed number
for any process it uses when choosing the UE\'s 5G-TMSI.
### 5.9.5 AMF Name
An AMF is identified by an AMF Name. AMF Name is a globally unique FQDN, the
structure of AMF Name FQDN is defined in TS 23.003 [19]. An AMF can be
configured with one or more GUAMIs. At a given time, GUAMI with distinct AMF
Pointer value is associated to one AMF name only.
### 5.9.6 Data Network Name (DNN)
A DNN is equivalent to an APN as defined in TS 23.003 [19]. Both identifiers
have an equivalent meaning and carry the same information.
The DNN may be used e.g. to:
\- Select a SMF and UPF(s) for a PDU Session.
\- Select N6 interface(s) for a PDU Session.
\- Determine policies to apply to this PDU Session.
The wildcard DNN is a value that can be used for the DNN field of Subscribed
DNN list of Session Management Subscription data defined in clause 5.2.3.3 of
TS 23.502 [3].
The wildcard DNN can be used with an S-NSSAI for operator to allow the
subscriber to access any Data Network supported within the Network Slice
associated with the S-NSSAI.
### 5.9.7 Internal-Group Identifier
The subscription data for an UE in UDR may associate the subscriber with
groups. A group is identified by an Internal-Group Identifier.
NOTE 1: A UE can belong to a limited number of groups, the exact number is
defined in stage 3 specifications.
NOTE 2: In this Release of the specification, the support of groups is only
defined in non-roaming case.
The Internal-Group Identifier(s) corresponding to an UE are provided by the
UDM to the SMF as part Session Management Subscription data and (when PCC
applies to a PDU Session) by the SMF to the PCF. The SMF may use this
information to apply local policies and to store this information in CDR. The
PCF may use this information to enforce AF requests as described in clause
5.6.7.
The Internal-Group Identifier(s) corresponding to an UE are provided by the
UDM to the AMF as part of Access and Mobility Subscription data. The AMF may
use this information to apply local policies (such as Group specific NAS level
congestion control defined in clause 5.19.7.5).
### 5.9.8 Generic Public Subscription Identifier
Generic Public Subscription Identifier (GPSI) is needed for addressing a 3GPP
subscription in different data networks outside of the 3GPP system. The 3GPP
system stores within the subscription data the association between the GPSI
and the corresponding SUPI.
_GPSIs are public identifiers used both inside and outside of the 3GPP
system._
The GPSI is either an MSISDN or an External Identifier, see TS 23.003 [19]. If
MSISDN is included in the subscription data, it shall be possible that the
same MSISDN value is supported in both 5GS and EPS.
NOTE: There is no implied 1-to-1 relationship between GPSI and SUPI.
### 5.9.9 AMF UE NGAP ID
An AMF UE NGAP ID is an identifier used to identify the UE in AMF on N2
reference point. AMF allocates the AMF UE NGAP ID and send it to the 5G-AN.
For the following N2 signalling interaction sent from 5G-AN to AMF, AMF UE
NGAP ID is used to identify the UE at the AMF. AMF UE NGAP ID is unique per
AMF set. AMF UE NGAP ID may be updated without AMF change, or with AMF change
as specified at clause 5.21.2.2.
### 5.9.10 UE Radio Capability ID
The UE Radio Capability ID is a short pointer with format defined in TS 23.003
[19] that is used to uniquely identify a set of UE Radio Capabilities
(excluding UTRAN and NB-IoT capabilities). The UE Radio Capability ID is
assigned either by the serving PLMN or by the UE manufacturer, as follows:
\- UE manufacturer-assigned: The UE Radio Capability ID may be assigned by the
UE manufacturer in which case it includes a UE manufacturer identification
(i.e. a Vendor ID). In this case, the UE Radio Capability ID uniquely
identifies a set of UE radio capabilities and the UE Radio Capability for
Paging for a UE by this manufacturer in any PLMN.
\- PLMN-assigned: If a UE manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID is not
used by the UE or the serving network, or it is not recognised by the serving
PLMN UCMF, the UCMF may allocate UE Radio Capability IDs for the UE
corresponding to each different set of UE radio capabilities the PLMN may
receive from the UE at different times. In this case, the UE Radio Capability
IDs the UE receives are applicable to the serving PLMN and uniquely identify
the corresponding sets of UE radio capabilities and and the UE Radio
Capability for Paging(s) in this PLMN. The PLMN assigned UE Radio Capability
ID includes a Version ID in its format. The value of the Version ID is the one
configured in the UCMF, at time the UE Radio Capability ID value is assigned.
The Version ID value makes it possible to detect whether a UE Radio Capability
ID is current or outdated.
NOTE: For the case the PLMN is configured to store PLMN assigned IDs in the UE
manufacturer-assigned operation requested list defined in clause 5.4.4.1a,
then the algorithm for assignment of PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID
shall assign different UE Radio Capability IDs for UEs with different TAC
value.
The type of UE Radio Capability ID (UE manufacturer-assigned or PLMN-assigned)
is distinguished when a UE Radio Capability ID is signalled.
## 5.10 Security aspects
### 5.10.1 General
The security features in the 5G System include:
\- Authentication of the UE by the network and vice versa (mutual
authentication between UE and network).
\- Security context generation and distribution.
\- User Plane data confidentiality and integrity protection.
\- Control Plane signalling confidentiality and integrity protection.
\- User identity confidentiality.
\- Support of LI requirements as specified in TS 33.126 [35] subject to
regional/national regulatory requirements, including protection of LI data
(e.g. target list) that may be stored or transferred by an NF.
Detailed security related network functions for 5G are described in TS 33.501
[29].
### 5.10.2 Security Model for non-3GPP access
#### 5.10.2.1 Signalling Security
When a UE is connected via a NG-RAN and via a standalone non-3GPP accesses,
the multiple N1 instances are secured using independent NAS security contexts,
each created based on the security context in the corresponding SEAF (e.g. in
the common AMF when the UE is served by the same AMF) derived from the UE
authentication.
### 5.10.3 PDU Session User Plane Security
The User Plane Security Enforcement information provides the NG-RAN with User
Plane security policies for a PDU session. It indicates:
\- whether UP integrity protection is:
\- Required: for all the traffic on the PDU Session UP integrity protection
shall apply.
\- Preferred: for all the traffic on the PDU Session UP integrity protection
should apply.
\- Not Needed: UP integrity protection shall not apply on the PDU Session.
\- whether UP confidentiality protection is:
\- Required: for all the traffic on the PDU Session UP confidentiality
protection shall apply.
\- Preferred: for all the traffic on the PDU Session UP confidentiality
protection should apply.
\- Not Needed: UP confidentiality shall not apply on the PDU Session.
User Plane Security Enforcement information applies only over 3GPP access.
Once determined at the establishment of the PDU Session the User Plane
Security Enforcement information applies for the life time of the PDU Session.
NOTE 1: Applicability of UP integrity protection of UP Security Enforcement is
defined in TS 33.501 [29] and TS 38.300 [27].
The SMF determines at PDU session establishment a User Plane Security
Enforcement information for the user plane of a PDU session based on:
\- subscribed User Plane Security Policy which is part of SM subscription
information received from UDM; and
\- User Plane Security Policy locally configured per (DNN, S-NSSAI) in the SMF
that is used when the UDM does not provide User Plane Security Policy
information.
\- The maximum supported data rate per UE for integrity protection for the
DRBs, provided by the UE in the Integrity protection maximum data rate IE
during PDU Session Establishment. The UE supporting NR as primary RAT, i.e.
NG-RAN access via Standalone NR, shall set the Integrity protection maximum
data rate IE for Uplink and Downlink to full rate at PDU Session Establishment
as defined in TS 24.501 [47]. A UE not supporting NR as primary RAT and
supporting E-UTRA connected to 5GC, shall set the Integrity protection maximum
data rate IE for Uplink and Downlink to NULL at PDU Session Establishment as
defined in TS 24.501 [47].
The User Plane Security Enforcement information provides the MME with User
Plane integrity protection policies for the PDU session (PDN Connection). The
information indicates whether UP integrity protection is:
\- Required: for all the traffic on the PDU Session (PDN Connection) UP
integrity protection shall apply.
\- Preferred: for all the traffic on the PDU Session (PDN Connection) UP
integrity protection should apply.
\- Not Needed: UP integrity protection shall not apply on the PDU Session (PDN
Connection).
In turn, the MME provides per EPS bearer User Plane Security Enforcement
information to the E-UTRAN. All the bearers within a PDN Connection share the
same User Plane integrity protection policies.
The UE capability to support user plane integrity protection with EPS is
indicated to AMF in the S1 UE network capability information. If the UE
supports user plane integrity protection with EPS, and the AMF supports the
associated functionality, the AMF indicates this to SMF at PDU Session
Establishment using NG-RAN. If the UE and AMF support user plane integrity
protection with EPS, for PDU Sessions with UP integrity protection of UP
Security Enforcement Information set to Required, the SMF may perform the EPS
bearer ID allocation procedure as described in TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.11.1.4.
If the UE does not support user plane integrity protection with EPS or the AMF
does not support the associated functionality, the SMF shall not trigger the
EPS bearer ID allocation procedure in clause 4.11.1.4 of TS 23.502 [3].
Unless the UE, the serving eNB and the MME support user plane integrity
protection with EPS, the SMF+PGW-C shall reject a PDN Connection Establishment
using EPS if the UP Security Enforcement Information has UP integrity
protection set to Required.
The SMF+PGW-C shall (e.g. based on the received RAT Type) reject a PDN
Connection Establishment using GERAN/UTRAN if the UP Security Enforcement
Information has UP integrity protection set to Required.
NOTE 2: This assumes that the optional user plane integrity protection for
GPRS specified in Release 13 has not been deployed.
The SMF may, based on local configuration, reject the PDU Session
Establishment request depending on the value of the maximum supported data
rate per UE for integrity protection.
NOTE 3: Reasons to reject a PDU Session Establishment request can e.g. be that
the UP Integrity Protection is determined to be \"Required\" while the maximum
supported data rate per UE for integrity protection is less than the expected
required data rate for the DN.
NOTE 4: The operator can take care to reduce the risk of such rejections when
configuring the subscribed User Plane Security Policy for a DNN. For example,
the operator may apply integrity protection \"Required\" only in scenarios
where it can be assumed that the UE maximum supported data rate per UE for
integrity protection is likely to be adequate for the DN.
The User Plane Security Policy provide the same level of information than User
Plane Security Enforcement information.
User Plane Security Policy from UDM takes precedence over locally configured
User Plane Security Policy.
The User Plane Security Enforcement information may include the maximum
supported data rate for integrity protection provided by the UE, is
communicated from SMF to the NG-RAN for enforcement as part of PDU session
related information. If the UP Integrity Protection is determined to be
\"Required\" or \"Preferred\", the SMF also provides the maximum supported
data rate per UE for integrity protection as received in the Integrity
protection maximum data rate IE. This takes place at establishment of a PDU
Session or at activation of the user plane of a PDU Session. The NG-RAN
rejects the establishment of UP resources for the PDU Session when it cannot
fulfil User Plane Security Enforcement information with a value of Required.
The NG-RAN may also take the maximum supported data rate per UE for integrity
protection into account in its decision on whether to accept or reject the
establishment of UP resources. In this case the SMF releases the PDU Session.
The NG-RAN notifies the SMF when it cannot fulfil a User Plane Security
Enforcement with a value of Preferred.
NOTE 5: For example, the NG-RAN cannot fulfil requirements in User Plane
Security Enforcement information with UP integrity protection set to
\"Required\" when it cannot negotiate UP integrity protection with the UE.
It is responsibility of the NG-RAN to enforce that the maximum UP integrity
protection data rate delivered to the UE in downlink is not exceeding the
maximum supported data rate for integrity protection.
It is expected that generally the UP integrity protection data rate applied by
the UE in uplink will not exceed the indicated maximum supported data rate,
but the UE is not required to perform strict rate enforcement.
User Plane Security Enforcement information and the maximum supported data
rate per UE for integrity protection is communicated from source to target NG-
RAN node at handover. If the target RAN node cannot support requirements in
User Plane Security Enforcement information, the target RAN node rejects the
request to setup resources for the PDU Session. In this case the PDU Session
is not handed over to the target RAN node and the PDU Session is released.
If the UE or the new eNB or the MME does not indicate support of user plane
integrity protection with EPS, PDU Sessions with UP integrity protection of
the User Plane Security Enforcement information set to Required are not
transferred to EPS as follows:
\- In the case of mobility without N26, the SMF+PGW-C shall reject a PDN
connectivity request in EPS with handover indication if the UP integrity
protection of the User Plane Security Enforcement is set to Required.
NOTE 6: As described in clause 5.17.2.3.3, the UE does not know before trying
to move a given PDU Session to EPC, whether that PDU session can be
transferred to EPC.
\- In the case of idle mode and connected mode mobility with N26 to EPS, or
mobility without N26, the SMF+PGW-C ensures that the PDU session is released.
If the UE, target eNB and the target MME indicate support of User Plane
Integrity Protection with EPS, PDU Sessions with UP integrity protection of
the User Plane Security Enforcement information set to Required are
transferred from 5GS to EPS according to existing procedures.
For the bearers of PDN Connections with UP integrity protection set to
Required, at (both idle mode and connected mode) mobility (including intra-TA
mobility) to an eNB that does not support User Plane Integrity Protection with
EPS, the MME shall inform the SMF+PGW-C and the SMF+PGW-C ensures that the PDU
session is released.
At connected mode mobility from EPS to GERAN/UTRAN or to a part of the EPS
that does not support User Plane Integrity Protection, the source E-UTRAN
shall ensure that EPS bearers with UP integrity protection of the User Plane
Security Enforcement information set to Required are not handed over.
In the case of idle mode mobility from an MME that supports User Plane
Integrity Protection, to an MME that does not support User Plane Integrity
Protection, the (home) SMF+PGW-C shall trigger (e.g. based on the lack of MME
UPIP capability information) the release of the bearers of PDN Connections
with UP integrity protection set to Required.
At any (e.g. idle mode) mobility from EPS to GERAN/UTRAN, the (home) SMF+PGW-C
shall trigger (e.g. based on the received RAT Type) the release of the bearers
of PDN Connections with UP integrity protection set to Required.
PDU Sessions with UP confidentiality protection of the User Plane Security
Enforcement information set to Required and UP integrity protection of the
User Plane Security Enforcement information not set to Required, are allowed
to be handed over to EPS regardless of how UP confidentiality protection
applies in EPS.
In the case of dual connectivity, the Integrity Protection is set to
\"Preferred\", the Master NG-RAN node may notify the SMF when it cannot fulfil
a User Plane Security Enforcement with a value of Preferred. The SMF handling
of the PDU session with respect to the Integrity Protection status is up to
SMF implementation decision.
## 5.11 Support for Dual Connectivity, Multi-Connectivity
### 5.11.1 Support for Dual Connectivity
Dual Connectivity involves two radio network nodes in providing radio
resources to a given UE (with active radio bearers), while a single N2
termination point exists for the UE between an AMF and the RAN. The RAN
architecture and related functions to support Dual Connectivity is further
described in RAN specifications (e.g. TS 37.340 [31]).
In this Release of the specification, the Dual Connectivity function does not
apply to the NR RedCap UE.
The RAN node at which the N2 terminates, performs all necessary N2 related
functions such as mobility management, relaying of NAS signalling, etc. and
manages the handling of user plane connection (e.g. transfer over N3). It is
called the Master RAN Node. It may use resources of another RAN node, the
Secondary RAN node, to exchange User Plane traffic of an UE. Master RAN node
takes into account the RSN and/or PDU Session Pair ID to determine if dual
connectivity shall be set up and ensure appropriate PDU session handling
ensures fully redundant user plane path as described in clause 5.33.2.1.
If the UE has Mobility Restriction (either signalled from the UDM, or, locally
generated by the Serving PLMN policy in the AMF) the AMF signals these
restrictions to the Master RAN Node as Mobility Restriction List; This may
prevent the Master RAN node from setting up a Dual Connectivity for an UE.
NOTE 1: Subject to policies in the NG-RAN, configuration of Dual Connectivity
for a Data Radio Bearer can also be based on the Network Slice that the PDU
Session belongs to.
Dual Connectivity provides the possibility for the Master node RAN to request
SMF:
\- For some or all PDU Sessions of an UE: Direct all the DL User Plane traffic
of the PDU Session to the either the Master RAN Node or to the Secondary RAN
Node. In this case, there is a single N3 tunnel termination at the RAN for
such PDU Session.
NOTE 2: The terminating RAN Node, can decide to keep traffic for specific
QFI(s) in a PDU Session for a UE on a single RAT, or split them across the two
RATs.
\- For some other PDU Sessions of an UE: Direct the DL User Plane traffic of
some QoS Flows of the PDU Session to the Secondary (respectively Master) RAN
Node while the remaining QoS Flows of the PDU Session are directed to the
Master (respectively Secondary) RAN Node. In this case there are, irrespective
of the number of QoS Flows, two N3 tunnel terminations at the RAN for such PDU
Session.
The Master RAN may create and change this assignment for the user plane of a
PDU Session at any time during the life time of the PDU Session;
In both cases, a single PDU Session Id is used to identify the PDU Session.
Additional functional characteristics are:
\- User location information is based on the identity of the cell that is
serving the UE in the Master RAN node. The cell identity of the Primary cell
in the secondary RAN node may also be included. NG-RAN includes the user
location information in NGAP messages where the contents of the user location
information may change during the corresponding procedure.
\- Path update signalling related with Dual Connectivity and UPF re-allocation
cannot occur at the same time.
## 5.12 Charging
### 5.12.1 General
5GC supports interactions towards CHF for network resource usage, as defined
in TS 32.240 [41]. The CHF and the Nchf service are defined in TS 32.290 [67].
The SMF supports the interactions towards the CHF, as defined in TS 32.255
[68]. The UPF supports functionality to collect and report usage data to SMF.
The N4 reference point supports the SMF control of the UPF collection and
reporting of usage data.
The AMF supports interactions towards the CHF, as defined in TS 32.256 [114].
The SMSF supports interactions towards the CHF, as defined in TS 32.274 [118].
The NEF supports interactions towards the CHF, as defined in TS 32.254 [123].
### 5.12.2 Usage Data Reporting for Secondary RAT
When NG-RAN is deployed in dual connectivity configuration, the HPLMN or VPLMN
operator may wish to record the data volume sent and received on the Secondary
RAT.
In order to reduce the complexity of this procedure, the following principles
are used in this release:
a) The PLMN locally activates the Secondary RAT Usage Data Reporting by NG-RAN
OAM. The activation is based on configuration in NG-RAN and NG-RAN determines
whether the data volume report will contain data volumes consumed for the
whole PDU Session or for selected QoS Flows or both as described in TS 38.413
[34].
The activation can happen separately for Data Volume Reporting of NR in
licensed or unlicensed spectrum and E-UTRA in licensed or unlicensed spectrum.
If the PLMN uses this feature, it should ensure that this functionality is
supported by all NG-RAN nodes that support NR or E-UTRA as a Secondary RAT.
b) Depending on its configuration the NG-RAN reports uplink and downlink data
volumes to the 5GC for the Secondary RAT (including the using of unlicensed
spectrum for NR or E-UTRA) for the PDU Session or for selected QoS Flows or
both and per time interval.
c) During Xn handover and N2 handover, the source NG-RAN node reports the data
volume to the 5GC. The reported data volume excludes data forwarded to the
target RAN node.
d) At the time of NG connection release, Secondary Node change/release,
deactivation of UP connection for a PDU Session, the NG-RAN node reports the
data volumes to the 5GC.
e) To assist \"partial CDR\" generation, NG-RAN OAM can instruct the NG-RAN to
also make periodic reports (as described in clause 5.12.3) if no event has
triggered a report before the period expires.
NOTE 2: The timing of these periodic NG-RAN reports is not expected to align
with the timing of partial CDR generation. Hence the frequency of NG-RAN
reports might be greater than that of partial CDR generation.
NOTE 3: RAN needs to be able to partition the measurements in a report to
indicate usage that occurred before and after an absolute time. An example of
the absolute time is that RAN is configured to partition data usage reports
that occurred before and after midnight.
### 5.12.3 Secondary RAT Periodic Usage Data Reporting Procedure
Periodic reporting of the Secondary RAT usage data is an optional function.
When NG-RAN, as defined in bullet e) of clause 5.12.12, is configured with a
\"time interval for Secondary RAT usage data reporting\", the NG-RAN shall
send a RAN Usage Data Report message for periodic reporting purposes to the
SMF only when the timer expires for a UE for which Secondary RAT usage data
reporting is ongoing. The timer runs from the last usage reporting for the UE.
## 5.13 Support for Edge Computing
Edge computing enables operator and 3rd party services to be hosted close to
the UE\'s access point of attachment, so as to achieve an efficient service
delivery through the reduced end-to-end latency and load on the transport
network. Edge Computing support by 5GC is specified in this specification and
in TS 23.548 [130].
NOTE: Edge Computing typically applies to non-roaming and LBO roaming
scenarios.
The 5G Core Network selects a UPF close to the UE and forwards traffic to
enable the local access to the DN via a N6 interface according to the provided
traffic steering rules to the UPF. This may be based on the UE\'s subscription
data, UE location, the information from Application Function (AF) as defined
in clause 5.6.7, the EAS information reported from EASDF (as defined in TS
23.548 [130]), policy or other related traffic rules.
Due to user or Application Function mobility, the service or session
continuity may be required based on the requirements of the service or the 5G
network.
The 5G Core Network may expose network information and capabilities to an Edge
Computing Application Function.
NOTE: Depending on the operator deployment, certain Application Functions can
be allowed to interact directly with the Control Plane Network Functions with
which they need to interact, while the other Application Functions need to use
the external exposure framework via the NEF (see clause 6.2.10 for details).
Edge computing can be supported by one or a combination of the following
enablers:
\- User plane (re)selection: the 5G Core Network (re)selects UPF to route the
user traffic to the local part of the DN as described in clause 6.3.3;
\- Local Routing and Traffic Steering: the 5G Core Network selects the traffic
to be routed to the applications in the local part of the DN;
\- this includes the use of a single PDU Session with multiple PDU Session
Anchor(s) (UL CL / IP v6 multi-homing) as described in clause 5.6.4 and the
use of a PDU Session with Distributed Anchor Point using SSC mode 2/3.
\- Session and service continuity to enable UE and application mobility as
described in clause 5.6.9;
\- An Application Function may influence UPF (re)selection and traffic routing
via PCF or NEF as described in clause 5.6.7;
\- Network capability exposure: 5G Core Network and Application Function to
provide information to each other via NEF as described in clause 5.20 or
directly as described in clause 4.15 of TS 23.502 [3] or from the UPF as
described in clause 6.4 of TS 23.548 [130];
\- QoS and Charging: PCF provides rules for QoS Control and Charging for the
traffic routed to the local part of the DN;
\- Support of Local Area Data Network: 5G Core Network provides support to
connect to the LADN in a certain area where the applications are deployed as
described in clause 5.6.5.
\- Discovery and re-discovery of Edge Applications Servers as described in TS
23.548 [130].
\- Support of Edge Relocation as described in TS 23.548 [130] and the case of
involving AF change as described in clauses 4.3.6.2, 4.3.6.3 and 4.3.6.4 of TS
23.502 [3].
\- Support of (I-)SMF (re)selection based on DNAI as described in clauses
4.3.5.1, 4.3.5.2 and 4.23.5.1 of TS 23.502 [3].
## 5.14 Policy Control
The policy and charging control framework for the 5G System is defined in TS
23.503 [45].
## 5.15 Network slicing
### 5.15.1 General
A Network Slice instance is defined within a PLMN or within an SNPN and shall
include:
\- the Core Network Control Plane and User Plane Network Functions, as
described in clause 4.2,
and, in the serving PLMN, at least one of the following:
\- the NG-RAN described in TS 38.300 [27];
\- the N3IWF or TNGF functions to the non-3GPP Access Network described in
clause 4.2.8.2 or the TWIF functions to the trusted WLAN in the case of
support of N5CW devices described in clause 4.2.8.5;
\- the W-AGF function to the Wireline Access Network described in clause
4.2.8.4.
The 5G System deployed in a PLMN shall always support the procedures,
information and configurations specified to support Network Slice instance
selection in the present document, TS 23.502 [3] and TS 23.503 [45].
Network slicing support for roaming is described in clause 5.15.6.
Network slices may differ for supported features and network functions
optimisations, in which case such Network Slices may have e.g. different
S-NSSAIs with different Slice/Service Types (see clause 5.15.2.1). The
operator can deploy multiple Network Slices delivering exactly the same
features but for different groups of UEs, e.g. as they deliver a different
committed service and/or because they are dedicated to a customer, in which
case such Network Slices may have e.g. different S-NSSAIs with the same
Slice/Service Type but different Slice Differentiators (see clause 5.15.2.1).
The network may serve a single UE with one or more Network Slice instances
simultaneously via a 5G-AN regardless of the access type(s) over which the UE
is registered (i.e. 3GPP Access and/or N3GPP Access). The AMF instance serving
the UE logically belongs to each of the Network Slice instances serving the
UE, i.e. this AMF instance is common to the Network Slice instances serving a
UE.
NOTE 1: Number of simultaneous connection of Network Slice instances per UE is
limited by the number of S-NSSAIs in the Requested/Allowed NSSAI as described
in clause 5.15.2.1.
NOTE 2: In this Release of the specification it is assumed that in any (home
or visited) PLMN it is always possible to select an AMF that can serve any
combination of S-NSSAIs that will be provided as an Allowed NSSAI.
The selection of the set of Network Slice instances for a UE is triggered by
the first contacted AMF in a Registration procedure normally by interacting
with the NSSF, and can lead to a change of AMF. This is further described in
clause 5.15.5.
A PDU Session belongs to one and only one specific Network Slice instance per
PLMN. Different Network Slice instances do not share a PDU Session, though
different Network Slice instances may have slice-specific PDU Sessions using
the same DNN.
During the Handover procedure the source AMF selects a target AMF by
interacting with the NRF as specified in clause 6.3.5.
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization (NSSAA) enables
Network Slice specific authentication as described in clause 5.15.10.
Network Slice Admission Control (NSAC) controls the number of registered UEs
per network slice and the number of PDU Sessions per network slice as
described in clause 5.15.11.
Support of subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of
network slices uses Network Slice Simultaneous Registration Group (NSSRG)
information to enable control of which Network Slices that can be registered
simultaneously by a UE as described in clause 5.15.12.
Support of data rate limitation per Network Slice for a UE enables enforcement
of Maximum Bit Rate per Network Slice for a UE as described in clause 5.15.13.
### 5.15.2 Identification and selection of a Network Slice: the S-NSSAI and
the NSSAI
#### 5.15.2.1 General
An S-NSSAI identifies a Network Slice.
An S-NSSAI is comprised of:
\- A Slice/Service type (SST), which refers to the expected Network Slice
behaviour in terms of features and services;
\- A Slice Differentiator (SD), which is optional information that complements
the Slice/Service type(s) to differentiate amongst multiple Network Slices of
the same Slice/Service type.
An S-NSSAI can have standard values (i.e. such S-NSSAI is only comprised of an
SST with a standardised SST value, see clause 5.15.2.2, and no SD) or non-
standard values (i.e. such S-NSSAI is comprised of either both an SST and an
SD or only an SST without a standardised SST value and no SD). An S-NSSAI with
a non-standard value identifies a single Network Slice within the PLMN with
which it is associated. An S-NSSAI with a non-standard value shall not be used
by the UE in access stratum procedures in any PLMN other than the one to which
the S-NSSAI is associated.
The S-NSSAIs in the NSSP of the URSP rules (see clause 6.6.2 of TS 23.503
[45]) and in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs (see clause 5.15.3) contain only HPLMN
S-NSSAI values.
The S-NSSAIs in the Configured NSSAI, the Allowed NSSAI (see clause 5.15.4.1),
the Requested NSSAI (see clause 5.15.5.2.1), the Rejected S-NSSAIs contain
only values from the Serving PLMN. The Serving PLMN can be the HPLMN or a
VPLMN.
The S-NSSAI(s) in the PDU Session Establishment contain one Serving PLMN
S-NSSAI value and in addition may contain a corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAI value
to which this first value is mapped (see clause 5.15.5.3).
The optional mapping of Serving PLMN S-NSSAIs to HPLMN S-NSSAIs contains
Serving PLMN S-NSSAI values and corresponding mapped HPLMN S-NSSAI values.
The NSSAI is a collection of S-NSSAIs. An NSSAI may be a Configured NSSAI, a
Requested NSSAI or an Allowed NSSAI. There can be at most eight S-NSSAIs in
Allowed and Requested NSSAIs sent in signalling messages between the UE and
the Network. The Requested NSSAI signalled by the UE to the network allows the
network to select the Serving AMF, Network Slice(s) and Network Slice
instance(s) for this UE, as specified in clause 5.15.5.
Based on the operator\'s operational or deployment needs, a Network Slice
instance can be associated with one or more S-NSSAIs, and an S-NSSAI can be
associated with one or more Network Slice instances. Multiple Network Slice
instances associated with the same S-NSSAI may be deployed in the same or in
different Tracking Areas. When multiple Network Slice instances associated
with the same S-NSSAI are deployed in the same Tracking Areas, the AMF
instance serving the UE may logically belong to (i.e. be common to) more than
one Network Slice instance associated with this S-NSSAI.
In a PLMN, when an S-NSSAI is associated with more than one Network Slice
instance, one of these Network Slice instances, as a result of the Network
Slice instance selection procedure defined in clause 5.15.5, serves a UE that
is allowed to use this S-NSSAI. For any S-NSSAI, the network may at any one
time serve the UE with only one Network Slice instance associated with this
S-NSSAI until cases occur where e.g. this Network Slice instance is no longer
valid in a given Registration Area, or a change in UE\'s Allowed NSSAI occurs,
etc. In such cases, procedures mentioned in clause 5.15.5.2.2 or clause
5.15.5.2.3 apply.
Based on the Requested NSSAI (if any) and the Subscription Information, the
5GC is responsible for selection of a Network Slice instance(s) to serve a UE
including the 5GC Control Plane and User Plane Network Functions corresponding
to this Network Slice instance(s). The Subscription Information may contain
restrictions to the simultaneous registration of network slices. This is
provided to the serving AMF as part of the UE subscription, in the form of
Network Slice Simultaneous Registration Group (NSSRG) information (see clause
5.15.12).
The (R)AN may use Requested NSSAI in access stratum signalling to handle the
UE Control Plane connection before the 5GC informs the (R)AN of the Allowed
NSSAI. The Requested NSSAI is used by the RAN for AMF selection, as described
in clause 6.3.5. The UE shall not include the Requested NSSAI in the RRC
Resume when the UE asks to resume the RRC connection and is CM-CONNECTED with
RRC Inactive state.
When a UE is successfully registered over an Access Type, the CN informs the
(R)AN by providing the Allowed NSSAI for the corresponding Access Type.
NOTE: The details of how the RAN uses NSSAI information are described in TS
38.300 [27].
#### 5.15.2.2 Standardised SST values
Standardized SST values provide a way for establishing global interoperability
for slicing so that PLMNs can support the roaming use case more efficiently
for the most commonly used Slice/Service Types.
The SSTs which are standardised are in the following Table 5.15.2.2-1.
Table 5.15.2.2-1: Standardised SST values
Slice/Service type SST value Characteristics
* * *
eMBB 1 Slice suitable for the handling of 5G enhanced Mobile Broadband. URLLC
2 Slice suitable for the handling of ultra- reliable low latency
communications. MIoT 3 Slice suitable for the handling of massive IoT. V2X 4
Slice suitable for the handling of V2X services. HMTC 5 Slice suitable for the
handling of High-Performance Machine-Type Communications.
NOTE 1: The support of all standardised SST values is not required in a PLMN.
Services indicated in this table for each SST value can also be supported by
means of other SSTs.
NOTE 2: A mapping of GSMA defined Network Slice Types (NEST) to standard SST
values is defined in GSMA NG.116 [137].
### 5.15.3 Subscription aspects
The Subscription Information shall contain one or more S-NSSAIs i.e.
Subscribed S-NSSAIs. The subscription information shall include at least one
default S-NSSAI. The UDM sends at the most 16 Subscribed S-NSSAIs to AMF, i.e.
the number that can fit in a Configured NSSAI. The subscription information
the UDM sends to the AMF shall include at least one default S-NSSAI.
If an S-NSSAI is marked as default, then the network is expected to serve the
UE with a related applicable Network Slice instance when the UE does not send
any permitted S-NSSAI to the network in a Registration Request message as part
of the Requested NSSAI.
The Subscription Information for each S-NSSAI may contain:
\- a Subscribed DNN list and one default DNN; and
\- the indication whether the S-NSSAI is marked as default Subscribed S-NSSAI;
and
\- the indication whether the S-NSSAI is subject to Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization; and
\- Network Slice Simultaneous Usage Group (NSSRG) information (see clause
5.15.12).
The network verifies the Requested NSSAI the UE provides in the Registration
Request against the Subscription Information. For the S-NSSAIs subject to
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization the clause 5.15.10
applies.
NOTE 1: It is recommended that at least one of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs marked
as default S-NSSAI is not subject to Network Slice-specific Authentication and
Authorization, in order to ensure access to services even when Network Slice-
specific Authentication and Authorization fails.
NOTE 2: It is recommended to minimize the number of Subscribed S-NSSAIs in
subscriptions for NB-IoT or NR RedCap capable UEs to minimize overhead for
signalling a large number of S-NSSAIs in Requested NSSAI in RRC and NAS via
NB-IoT or NR RedCap.
In roaming case, the UDM shall provide to the VPLMN only the S-NSSAIs from the
Subscribed S-NSSAIs the HPLMN allows for the UE in the VPLMN. If the UE is
subject to restrictions of simultaneous registration of network slices (i.e.
if the Subscription Information for the S-NSSAIs contains NSSRG information),
the UDM provides to the VPLMN a subscribed S-NSSAIs and, if applicable, NSSRG
information, as described in clause 5.15.12.
NOTE 3: Network slice instances supporting an S-NSSAI subject to Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization need to be deployed with AMFs
supporting Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, otherwise
S-NSSAIs requiring Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization
would be incorrectly allowed without execution of Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization.
NOTE 4: Network slice instances supporting an S-NSSAI subject to Network Slice
Admission Control (NSAC) need to be deployed with AMFs supporting NSAC,
otherwise S-NSSAIs requiring NSAC would be incorrectly allowed without
execution of NSAC.
When the UDM updates the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) to the serving AMF, based on
configuration in this AMF, the AMF itself or the NSSF determines the mapping
of the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN and/or Allowed NSSAI to the
Subscribed S-NSSAI(s). The serving AMF then updates the UE with the above
information as described in clause 5.15.4.
### 5.15.4 UE NSSAI configuration and NSSAI storage aspects
#### 5.15.4.1 General
##### 5.15.4.1.1 UE Network Slice configuration
The Network Slice configuration information contains one or more Configured
NSSAI(s). A Configured NSSAI may either be configured by a Serving PLMN and
apply to the Serving PLMN, or may be a Default Configured NSSAI configured by
the HPLMN and that applies to any PLMNs for which no specific Configured NSSAI
has been provided to the UE. There is at most one Configured NSSAI per PLMN.
NOTE 1: The value(s) used in the Default Configured NSSAI are expected to be
commonly decided by all roaming partners, e.g. by the use of values
standardized by 3GPP or other bodies.
The Default Configured NSSAI, if it is configured in the UE, is used by the UE
in a Serving PLMN only if the UE has no Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN.
The Configured NSSAI of a PLMN may include S-NSSAIs that have standard values
or PLMN-specific values.
The Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN includes the S-NSSAI values which
can be used in the Serving PLMN and may be associated with mapping of each
S-NSSAI of the Configured NSSAI to one or more corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAI
values. In the non-roaming case, the network shall not provide any mapped
S-NSSAI to the UE with the Configured NSSAI. In roaming case, the AMF shall
provide to the UE the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Configured NSSAI for the
Serving PLMN to the corresponding S-NSSAI values of the HPLMN when providing
NSSAI information, as described in TS 24.501 [47].
A UE subscription may contain Network Slice Simultaneous Registration Group
(NSSRG) information. If so, the UE configuration is performed as described in
clause 5.15.12.2.
The UE may be pre-configured with the Default Configured NSSAI. The UE may be
provisioned/updated with the Default Configured NSSAI, determined by the UDM
in the HPLMN, using the UE Parameters Update via UDM Control Plane procedure
defined in clause 4.20 of TS 23.502 [3]. Each S-NSSAI in the Default
Configured NSSAI may have a corresponding S-NSSAI as part of the Subscribed
S-NSSAI(s). Consequently, if the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) which are also present
in the Default Configured NSSAI are updated the UDM should update the Default
Configured NSSAI in the UE.
In the HPLMN, the S-NSSAIs in the Configured NSSAI provided as described in
clause 5.15.4.2, at the time when they are provided to the UE, shall match the
Subscribed S-NSSAIs for the UE.
When the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) are updated (i.e. some existing S-NSSAIs are
removed and/or some new S-NSSAIs are added) and one or more are applicable to
the Serving PLMN the UE is registered in, as described in clause 5.15.3, or
when the associated mapping is updated the AMF shall update the UE with the
Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN and/or Allowed NSSAI and/or the
associated mapping to HPLMN S-NSSAIs (see clause 5.15.4.2). When there is the
need to update the Allowed NSSAI, the AMF shall provide the UE with the new
Allowed NSSAI and the associated mapping to HPLMN S-NSSAIs, unless the AMF
cannot determine the new Allowed NSSAI (e.g. all S-NSSAIs in the old Allowed
NSSAI have been removed from the Subscribed S-NSSAIs), in which case the AMF
shall not send any Allowed NSSAI to the UE but indicate to the UE to perform a
Registration procedure. If the UE is in a CM-IDLE state, the AMF may trigger
Network Triggered Service Request or wait until the UE is in a CM-CONNECTED
state as described in clause 4.2.4.2, TS 23.502 [3].
When providing a Requested NSSAI to the network upon registration, the UE in a
given PLMN only includes and uses S-NSSAIs applying to this PLMN. The mapping
of S-NSSAIs of the Requested NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs may also be provided (see
clause 5.15.4.1.2 for when this is needed). The S-NSSAIs in the Requested
NSSAI are part of the Configured and/or Allowed NSSAIs applicable for this
PLMN, when they are available. If the UE has received NSSRG information
together with the Configured NSSAI, it only includes in the Requested NSSAI
S-NSSAIs that all share a common NSSRG. If the UE has stored Pending NSSAI and
the UE is still interested in the Pending NSSAI then all the S-NSSAIs in the
Requested NSSAI and the Pending S-NSSAI shall share a common NSSRG. If no
Configured NSSAI and Allowed NSSAI for the PLMN are available, the S-NSSAIs in
the Requested NSSAI correspond to the Default Configured NSSAI, if configured
in the UE. Upon successful completion of a UE\'s Registration procedure over
an Access Type, the UE obtains from the AMF an Allowed NSSAI for this Access
Type, which includes one or more S-NSSAIs and, if needed (see clause
5.15.4.1.2 for when this is needed), their mapping to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs.
These S-NSSAIs are valid for the current Registration Area and Access Type
provided by the AMF the UE has registered with and can be used simultaneously
by the UE (up to the maximum number of simultaneous Network Slice instances or
PDU Sessions).
The UE might also obtain one or more rejected S-NSSAIs with cause and validity
of rejection from the AMF. An S-NSSAI may be rejected:
\- for the entire PLMN; or
\- for the current Registration Area.
While it remains RM-REGISTERED in the PLMN and regardless of the Access Type,
the UE shall not re-attempt to register to an S-NSSAI rejected for the entire
PLMN until this rejected S-NSSAI is deleted as specified below.
While it remains RM-REGISTERED in the PLMN, the UE shall not re-attempt to
register to an S-NSSAI rejected in the current Registration Area until it
moves out of the current Registration Area.
NOTE 2: The details and more cases of S-NSSAI rejection are described in TS
24.501 [47].
S-NSSAIs that the UE provides in the Requested NSSAI which are neither in the
Allowed NSSAI nor provided as a rejected S-NSSAI, shall, by the UE, not be
regarded as rejected, i.e. the UE may request to register these S-NSSAIs again
next time the UE sends a Requested NSSAI.
The UE stores (S-)NSSAIs as follows:
\- When provisioned with a Configured NSSAI for a PLMN and/or a mapping of
Configured NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs and possibly NSSRG information for each
S-NSSAI in the Configured NSSAI (if applicable and supported by the UE), or
when requested to remove the configuration due to network slicing subscription
change, the UE shall:
\- replace any stored (old) Configured NSSAI for this PLMN with the new
Configured NSSAI for this PLMN (if applicable); and
\- delete any stored associated mapping of this old Configured NSSAI for this
PLMN to HPLMN S-NSSAIs and, if present and applicable, store the mapping of
Configured NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs; and
\- delete any stored associated NSSRG information for each S-NSSAI of the
Configured NSSAI and, if present, store the associated NSSRG information for
each S-NSSAI of the Configured NSSAI; and
\- delete any stored rejected S-NSSAI for this PLMN;
\- keep the received Configured NSSAI for a PLMN (if applicable) and
associated mapping to HPLMN S-NSSAIs (if applicable) and associated NSSRG
information for each S-NSSAI of the Configured NSSAI (if applicable and
supported by the UE) stored in the UE, even when registering in another PLMN,
until a new Configured NSSAI for this PLMN and/or associated mapping are
provisioned in the UE, or until the network slicing subscription changes, as
described in clause 5.15.4.2. The number of Configured NSSAIs and associated
mapping to be kept stored in the UE for PLMNs other than the HPLMN is up to UE
implementation. A UE shall at least be capable of storing a Configured NSSAI
for the serving PLMN including any necessary mapping of the Configured NSSAI
for the Serving PLMN to HPLMN S-NSSAIs and the Default Configured NSSAI.
\- The Allowed NSSAI received in a Registration Accept message or a UE
Configuration Update Command applies to a PLMN when at least a TAI of this
PLMN is included in the RA/TAI list included in this Registration Accept
message or UE Configuration Update Command. If the UE Configuration Update
Command contains an Allowed NSSAI but not a TAI List, then the last received
RA/TAI list applies for the decision on which PLMN(s) the Allowed NSSAI is
applicable. If received, the Allowed NSSAI for a PLMN and Access Type and any
associated mapping of this Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs shall be stored in
the UE. The UE should store this Allowed NSSAI and any associated mapping of
this Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs also when the UE is turned off, or until
the network slicing subscription changes, as described in clause 5.15.4.2:
NOTE 3: Whether the UE stores the Allowed NSSAI and any associated mapping of
the Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs also when the UE is turned off is left to
UE implementation.
\- When a new Allowed NSSAI for a PLMN and any associated mapping of the
Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs are received over an Access Type, the UE
shall:
\- replace any stored (old) Allowed NSSAI and any associated mapping for these
PLMN and Access Type with this new Allowed NSSAI; and
\- delete any stored associated mapping of this old Allowed NSSAI for this
PLMN to HPLMN S-NSSAIs and, if present, store the associated mapping of this
new Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs;
\- If received, an S-NSSAI rejected for the entire PLMN shall be stored in the
UE while RM-REGISTERED in this PLMN regardless of the Access Type or until it
is deleted.
\- If received, an S-NSSAI rejected for the current Registration Area shall be
stored in the UE while RM-REGISTERED until the UE moves out of the current
Registration Area or until the S-NSSAI is deleted.
NOTE 4: The storage aspects of rejected S-NSSAIs are described in TS 24.501
[47].
\- If received, the Pending NSSAI shall be stored in the UE as described in TS
24.501 [47].
##### 5.15.4.1.2 Mapping of S-NSSAIs values in the Allowed NSSAI and in the
Requested NSSAI to the S-NSSAIs values used in the HPLMN
For the roaming case, one or more S-NSSAIs in an Allowed NSSAI provided to the
UE can have values which are not part of the UE\'s current Network Slice
configuration information for the Serving PLMN. In this case, the network
provides the Allowed NSSAI together with the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the
Allowed NSSAI to the corresponding S-NSSAI of the HPLMN. This mapping
information allows the UE to associate Applications to S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN
as per NSSP of the URSP rules or as per the UE Local Configuration, as defined
in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of TS 23.503 [45] and to the corresponding S-NSSAI from
the Allowed NSSAI.
In the non-roaming case, the network shall not provide any mapped S-NSSAI to
the UE with the Allowed NSSAI.
In roaming case, the UE shall provide in the Requested NSSAI the mapping of
S-NSSAIs of the Serving PLMN values to the corresponding S-NSSAI values of the
HPLMN, for each S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI for which a mapping is
available. These values are found in the mapping previously received from the
Serving PLMN of the S-NSSAIs of the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN or
of the S-NSSAIs of the Allowed NSSAI for the Serving PLMN and Access Type to
the corresponding S-NSSAIs values used in the HPLMN.
#### 5.15.4.2 Update of UE Network Slice configuration
At any time, the AMF may provide the UE with a new Configured NSSAI for the
Serving PLMN, associated with mapping of the Configured NSSAI to HPLMN
S-NSSAIs as specified in clause 5.15.4.1. The Configured NSSAI for the Serving
PLMN and the mapping information is either determined in the AMF (if based on
configuration, the AMF is allowed to determine the Network Slice configuration
for the whole PLMN) or by the NSSF. The AMF provides an updated Configured
NSSAI as specified in clause 4.2.4 of TS 23.502 [3], UE Configuration Update
procedure.
The AMF shall provide the UE with NSSRG information alongside the Configured
NSSAI if NSSRG information is included in the subscription information
received from the UDM and if the UE has indicated support for the feature as
part of the registration request, see clause 5.15.12.
If the HPLMN performs the configuration update of a UE registered in the HPLMN
(e.g. due to a change in the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) or due to a change of NSSRG
information), this results in updates to the Configured NSSAI for the HPLMN
and, if applicable, NSSRG information for each S-NSSAI of the Configured
NSSAI. Updates to the Allowed NSSAI and/or, if present, to the associated
mapping of the Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs are also possible if the
configuration update affects S-NSSAI(s) in the current Allowed NSSAI.
If the VPLMN performs the configuration update of a UE registered in the VPLMN
(e.g. due to a change in the Subscribed S-NSSAI(s), the associated mapping is
updated, or due to a change of NSSRG information), this results in updates to
the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN and/or to the associated mapping of
the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN to HPLMN S-NSSAIs and, if
applicable, NSSRG information for each S-NSSAI of the Configured NSSAI.
Updates to the Allowed NSSAI and/or to the associated mapping of the Allowed
NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs are also possible if the configuration update affects
S-NSSAI(s) in the current Allowed NSSAI.
A UE for which the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN has been updated as
described in clause 5.15.4.1 and has been requested to perform a Registration
procedure, shall initiate a Registration procedure to receive a new valid
Allowed NSSAI (see clause 5.15.5.2.2).
When the subscribed S-NSSAIs change, a UDR flag is set in the HPLMN to make
sure the current PLMN (or, if the UE was not reachable, the next serving PLMN)
is informed by the UDM that the subscription data for network slicing has
changed. The AMF, when it receives the indication from the UDM subscription
has changed, indicates the UE that subscription has changed and uses any
updated subscription information from the UDM to update the UE. Once the AMF
updates the UE and obtains an acknowledgment from the UE, the AMF informs the
UDM that the configuration update was successful and the UDM clears the flag
in the UDR. If the UE is in a CM-IDLE state, the AMF may trigger Network
Triggered Service Request or wait until the UE is in a CM-CONNECTED state as
described in clause 4.2.4.2, TS 23.502 [3].
If the UE receives indication from the AMF that Network Slicing subscription
has changed, the UE locally deletes the network slicing information it has for
all PLMNs, except the Default Configured NSSAI (if present). It also updates
the current PLMN network slicing configuration information with any received
values from the AMF.
The update of URSP rules (which include the NSSP), if necessary at any time,
is described in TS 23.503 [45].
### 5.15.5 Detailed Operation Overview
#### 5.15.5.1 General
The establishment of User Plane connectivity to a Data Network via a Network
Slice instance(s) comprises two steps:
\- performing a RM procedure to select an AMF that supports the required
Network Slices.
\- establishing one or more PDU Session to the required Data network via the
Network Slice instance(s).
#### 5.15.5.2 Selection of a Serving AMF supporting the Network Slices
##### 5.15.5.2.1 Registration to a set of Network Slices
When a UE registers over an Access Type with a PLMN, if the UE has either or
both of:
\- a Configured NSSAI for this PLMN;
\- an Allowed NSSAI for this PLMN and Access Type;
the UE shall provide to the network, in AS layer under the conditions
described in clause 5.15.9 and in NAS layer, a Requested NSSAI containing the
S-NSSAI(s) corresponding to the Network Slice(s) to which the UE wishes to
register, unless they are stored in the UE in the Pending NSSAI.
The Requested NSSAI shall be one of:
\- the Default Configured NSSAI, i.e. if the UE has no Configured NSSAI nor an
Allowed NSSAI for the serving PLMN;
\- the Configured-NSSAI, or a subset thereof as described below, e.g. if the
UE has no Allowed NSSAI for the Access Type for the serving PLMN;
\- the Allowed-NSSAI for the Access Type over which the Requested NSSAI is
sent, or a subset thereof; or
\- the Allowed-NSSAI for the Access Type over which the Requested NSSAI is
sent, or a subset thereof, plus one or more S-NSSAIs from the Configured-NSSAI
not yet in the Allowed NSSAI for the Access Type as described below.
NOTE 1: If the UE wishes to register only a subset of the S-NSSAIs from the
Configured NSSAI or the Allowed NSSAI, to be able to register with some
Network Slices e.g. to establish PDU Sessions for some application(s), and the
UE uses the URSP rules (which includes the NSSP) or the UE Local Configuration
as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of TS 23.503 [45], then the UE uses applicable
the URSP rules or the UE Local Configuration to ensure that the S-NSSAIs
included in the Requested NSSAI are not in conflict with the URSP rules or
with the UE Local Configuration.
The subset of S-NSSAIs in the Configured-NSSAI provided in the Requested NSSAI
consists of one or more S-NSSAI(s) in the Configured NSSAI applicable to this
PLMN, if one is present, and for which no corresponding S-NSSAI is already
present in the Allowed NSSAI for the access type for this PLMN. The UE shall
not include in the Requested NSSAI any S-NSSAI that is currently rejected by
the network (i.e. rejected in the current registration area or rejected in the
PLMN). For the registration to a PLMN for which neither a Configured NSSAI
applicable to this PLMN or an Allowed NSSAI are present, the S-NSSAIs provided
in the Requested NSSAI correspond to the S-NSSAI(s) in the Default Configured
NSSAI unless the UE has HPLMN S-NSSAI for established PDU Session(s) in which
case the HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) shall be provided in the mapping of Requested NSSAI
in the NAS Registration Request message, with no corresponding VPLMN S-NSSAI
in the Requested NSSAI. If the UE has been provided with NSSRG information
together with the Configured NSSAI, the UE only includes in the Requested
NSSAI S-NSSAIs that share a common NSSRG, see clause 5.15.12.2. If the UE has
stored Pending NSSAI and the UE is still interested in the Pending NSSAI then
all the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI and the Pending S-NSSAI shall share a
common NSSRG.
When a UE registers over an Access Type with a PLMN, the UE shall also
indicate in the Registration Request message when the Requested NSSAI is based
on the Default Configured NSSAI.
The UE shall include the Requested NSSAI in the RRC Connection Establishment
and in the establishment of the connection to the N3IWF/TNGF (as applicable)
and in the NAS Registration procedure messages subject to conditions set out
in clause 5.15.9. However, the UE shall not indicate any NSSAI in RRC
Connection Establishment or Initial NAS message unless it has either a
Configured NSSAI for the corresponding PLMN, an Allowed NSSAI for the
corresponding PLMN and Access Type, or the Default Configured NSSAI. If the UE
has HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) for established PDU Session(s), the HPLMN S-NSSAI(s)
shall be provided in the mapping of Requested NSSAI in the NAS Registration
Request message, independent of whether the UE has the corresponding VPLMN
S-NSSAI. The (R)AN shall route the NAS signalling between this UE and an AMF
selected using the Requested NSSAI obtained during RRC Connection
Establishment or connection to N3IWF/TNGF respectively. If the (R)AN is unable
to select an AMF based on the Requested NSSAI, it routes the NAS signalling to
an AMF from a set of default AMFs. In the NAS signalling, if the UE is
roaming, the UE provides the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Requested NSSAI to
a corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAI.
When a UE registers with a PLMN, if for this PLMN the UE has not included a
Requested NSSAI nor a GUAMI while establishing the connection to the (R)AN,
the (R)AN shall route all NAS signalling from/to this UE to/from a default
AMF. When receiving from the UE a Requested NSSAI and a 5G-S-TMSI or a GUAMI
in RRC Connection Establishment or in the establishment of connection to
N3IWF/TNGF, if the 5G-AN can reach an AMF corresponding to the 5G-S-TMSI or
GUAMI, then 5G-AN forwards the request to this AMF. Otherwise, the 5G-AN
selects a suitable AMF based on the Requested NSSAI provided by the UE and
forwards the request to the selected AMF. If the 5G-AN is not able to select
an AMF based on the Requested NSSAI, then the request is sent to a default
AMF.
When the AMF selected by the AN during Registration Procedure receives the UE
Registration request, or after an AMF selection by MME (i.e. during EPS to 5GS
handover) the AMF receives S-NSSAI(s) from SMF+PGW-C in 5GC:
\- As part of the Registration procedure described in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS
23.502 [3], or as part of the EPS to 5GS handover using N26 interface
procedure described in clause 4.11.1.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3], the AMF may query
the UDM to retrieve UE subscription information including the Subscribed
S-NSSAIs.
\- The AMF verifies whether the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI or the
S-NSSAI(s) received from SMF+PGW-C are permitted based on the Subscribed
S-NSSAIs (to identify the Subscribed S-NSSAIs the AMF may use the mapping to
HPLMN S-NSSAIs provided by the UE, in the NAS message, for each S-NSSAI of the
Requested NSSAI).
\- When the UE context in the AMF does not yet include an Allowed NSSAI for
the corresponding Access Type, the AMF queries the NSSF (see (B) below for
subsequent handling), except in the case when, based on configuration in this
AMF, the AMF is allowed to determine whether it can serve the UE (see (A)
below for subsequent handling). The IP address or FQDN of the NSSF is locally
configured in the AMF.
NOTE 2: The configuration in the AMF depends on operator\'s policy.
\- When the UE context in the AMF already includes an Allowed NSSAI for the
corresponding Access Type, based on the configuration for this AMF, the AMF
may be allowed to determine whether it can serve the UE (see (A) below for
subsequent handling).
\- AMF or NSSF may have previously subscribed to slice load level and/or
Observed Service Experience and/or Dispersion Analytics related network data
analytics for a Network Slice from NWDAF, optionally for an Area of Interest
composed of one or several TAIs. If AMF subscribes to analytics, AMF may
determine that it cannot serve the UE based on received analytics (see (A)
below). If AMF subscribes to notifications on changes on the Network Slice or
Network Slice instance availability information from NSSF optionally
indicating a list of supported TAIs, it may determine that it cannot serve the
UE after the restriction notification is received (see (A) below). If AMF does
not subscribe to notifications on changes on the availability information from
NSSF, NSSF may take the analytics information into account when AMF queries
NSSF (see (B) below).
NOTE 3: The configuration in the AMF depends on the operator\'s policy.
**(A)** Depending on fulfilling the configuration as described above, the AMF
may be allowed to determine whether it can serve the UE, and the following is
performed:
\- For the mobility from EPS to 5GS, the AMF first derives the serving PLMN
value(s) of S-NSSAI(s) based on the HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) in the mapping of
Requested NSSAI (in CM-IDLE state) or the HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) received from
SMF+PGW-C (in CM-CONNECTED state). After that the AMF regards the derived
value(s) as the Requested NSSAI.
\- For the inter PLMN within 5GC mobility, the new AMF derives the serving
PLMN value(s) of S-NSSAI(s) based on the HPLMN S-NSSAI(s) in the mapping of
Requested NSSAI. After that the AMF regards the derived value(s) as the
Requested NSSAI.
\- AMF checks whether it can serve all the S-NSSAI(s) from the Requested NSSAI
present in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs (potentially using configuration for
mapping S-NSSAI values between HPLMN and Serving PLMN), or all the S-NSSAI(s)
marked as default in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs in the case that no Requested
NSSAI was provided or none of the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI are
permitted, i.e. do not match any of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs or not available
at the current UE\'s Tracking Area (see clause 5.15.3).
\- If AMF has subscribed to slice load level and/or Observed Service
Experience and/or Dispersion Analytics related network data analytics for a
Network Slice from NWDAF, or if AMF had received a Network Slice restriction
from NSSF that applies to the list of TAIs supported by the AMF, it may use
that information to determine whether the AMF can serve the UE on the
S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI.
\- If the AMF can serve the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI, the AMF remains
the serving AMF for the UE. The Allowed NSSAI is then composed of the list of
S-NSSAI(s) permitted based on the Subscribed S-NSSAIs and/or the list of
S-NSSAI(s) for the Serving PLMN which are mapped to the HPLMN S-NSSAI(s)
provided in the mapping of Requested NSSAI permitted based on the Subscribed
S-NSSAIs, or, if neither Requested NSSAI nor the mapping of Requested NSSAI
was provided or none of the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI are permitted, all
the S-NSSAI(s) marked as default in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs and taking also
into account the availability of the Network Slice instances as described in
clause 5.15.8 that are able to serve the S-NSSAI(s) in the Allowed NSSAI in
the current UE\'s Tracking Areas in addition to any Network Slice instance
restriction for the S-NSSAI(s) in the Allowed NSSAI provided by the NSSF. If
the AMF has received NSSRG Information for the Subscribed S-NSSAIs as part of
the UE subscription information, it shall only include in the Allowed NSSAI
S-NSSAIs that all share a common NSSRG (see clause 5.15.12). If at least one
S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI is not available in the current UE\'s Tracking
Area, then either the AMF may determine a Target NSSAI or step (B) is
executed. The AMF also determines the mapping if the S-NSSAI(s) included in
the Allowed NSSAI needs to be mapped to Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) values. If no
Requested NSSAI is provided, or the mapping of the S-NSSAIs in Requested NSSAI
to HPLMN S-NSSAIs is incorrect, or the Requested NSSAI includes an S-NSSAI
that is not valid in the Serving PLMN, or the UE indicated that the Requested
NSSAI is based on the Default Configured NSSAI, the AMF, based on the
Subscribed S-NSSAI(s) and operator\'s configuration, may also determine the
Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN and, if applicable, the associated
mapping of the Configured NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs, so these can be configured
in the UE. Then Step (C) is executed.
NOTE 4: The ability for the AMF to construct the Allowed NSSAI with values not
contained in Requested NSSAI but permitted by subscribed NSSAI can be used to
allow the UE to use newly-added S-NSSAI(s) in the case of Network Slicing
Subscription Change (see clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]).
\- Else, the AMF queries the NSSF (see (B) below).
**(B)** When required as described above, the AMF needs to query the NSSF, and
the following is performed:
\- The AMF queries the NSSF, with Requested NSSAI, Default Configured NSSAI
Indication, mapping of Requested NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs, the Subscribed
S-NSSAIs (with an indication if marked as default S-NSSAI), NSSRG Information
(if provided by the UDM, see clause 5.15.12), any Allowed NSSAI it might have
for the other Access Type (including its mapping to HPLMN S-NSSAIs), PLMN ID
of the SUPI and UE\'s current Tracking Area. If the AMF has pending NSSAI for
the UE then the AMF includes the pending NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI.
\- Based on this information, local configuration, and other locally available
information including RAN capabilities in the current Tracking Area for the UE
or load level information for a Network Slice instance provided by the NWDAF,
the NSSF does the following:
\- It verifies which S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI are permitted based on
comparing the Subscribed S-NSSAIs with the S-NSSAIs in the mapping of
Requested NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs. It considers the S-NSSAI(s) marked as
default in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs in the case that no Requested NSSAI was
provided or no S-NSSAI from the Requested NSSAI are permitted i.e. are not
present in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs or not available e.g. at the current UE\'s
Tracking Area. If NSSRG information is provided, the NSSF only selects
S-NSSAIs that share a common NSSRG (see clause 5.15.12).
\- If AMF has not subscribed to notifications on changes on the Network Slice
or Network Slice instance availability information from NSSF and NSSF has
subscribed to slice load level and/or Observed Service Experience and/or
Dispersion Analytics related network data analytics for a Network Slice from
NWDAF, NSSF may use the analytics information for the determination of the
(Network Slice instance(s) and the) list of S-NSSAI(s) in the Allowed NSSAI(s)
to serve the UE.
\- It selects the Network Slice instance(s) to serve the UE. When multiple
Network Slice instances in the UE\'s Tracking Area are able to serve a given
S-NSSAI, based on operator\'s configuration, the NSSF may select one of them
to serve the UE, or the NSSF may defer the selection of the Network Slice
instance until a NF/service within the Network Slice instance needs to be
selected.
\- It determines the target AMF Set to be used to serve the UE, or, based on
configuration, the list of candidate AMF(s), possibly after querying the NRF.
NOTE 5: If the target AMF(s) returned from the NSSF is the list of candidate
AMF(s), the Registration Request message can only be redirected via the direct
signalling between the initial AMF and the selected target AMF as described in
clause 5.15.5.2.3. The NSSF does not provide the target AMF(s), when it
provides a Target NSSAI in order to redirect or handover the UE to a cell of
another TA as described in clause 5.3.4.3.3.
\- It determines the Allowed NSSAI(s) for the applicable Access Type, composed
of the list of S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI permitted based on the
Subscribed S-NSSAIs and/or the list of S-NSSAI(s) for the Serving PLMN which
are mapped to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs provided in the mapping of Requested NSSAI
permitted based on the Subscribed S-NSSAIs, or, if neither Requested NSSAI nor
the mapping of Requested NSSAI was provided or none of the S-NSSAIs in the
Requested NSSAI are permitted, all the S-NSSAI(s) marked as default in the
Subscribed S-NSSAIs, and taking also into account the availability of the
Network Slice instances as described in clause 5.15.8 that are able to serve
the S-NSSAI(s) in the Allowed NSSAI in the current UE\'s Tracking Areas. If
NSSRG information applies, the NSSF only selects S-NSSAIs that share a common
NSSRG (see clause 5.15.12).
\- It also determines the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Allowed NSSAI(s) to
the Subscribed S-NSSAIs if necessary.
\- Based on operator configuration, the NSSF may determine the NRF(s) to be
used to select NFs/services within the selected Network Slice instance(s).
\- Additional processing to determine the Allowed NSSAI(s) in roaming
scenarios and the mapping to the Subscribed S-NSSAIs, as described in clause
5.15.6.
\- If no Requested NSSAI is provided or the Requested NSSAI includes an
S-NSSAI that is not valid in the Serving PLMN, or the mapping of the S-NSSAIs
in Requested NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs is incorrect, or the Default Configured
NSSAI Indication is received from AMF, the NSSF based on the Subscribed
S-NSSAI(s) and operator configuration may also determine the Configured NSSAI
for the Serving PLMN and, if applicable, the associated mapping of the
Configured NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs, so these can be configured in the UE.
\- If at least one S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI is not available in the
current UE\'s Tracking Area, the NSSF may provide a Target NSSAI for the
purpose of allowing the NG-RAN to redirect the UE to a cell of a TA in another
frequency band supporting network slices not available in the current TA as
described in clause 5.3.4.3.3.
\- The NSSF returns to the current AMF the Allowed NSSAI for the applicable
Access Type, the mapping of each S-NSSAI of the Allowed NSSAI to the
Subscribed S-NSSAIs if determined and the target AMF Set, or, based on
configuration, the list of candidate AMF(s). The NSSF may return the NRF(s) to
be used to select NFs/services within the selected Network Slice instance(s),
and the NRF to be used to determine the list of candidate AMF(s) from the AMF
Set. The NSSF may return NSI ID(s) to be associated to the Network Slice
instance(s) corresponding to certain S-NSSAIs. NSSF may return the rejected
S-NSSAI(s) as described in clause 5.15.4.1. The NSSF may return the Configured
NSSAI for the Serving PLMN and the associated mapping of the Configured NSSAI
to HPLMN S-NSSAIs. The NSSF may return Target NSSAI as described in clause
5.3.4.3.3.
\- Depending on the available information and based on configuration, the AMF
may query the appropriate NRF (e.g. locally pre-configured or provided by the
NSSF) with the target AMF Set. The NRF returns a list of candidate AMFs.
\- If AMF Re-allocation is necessary, the current AMF reroutes the
Registration Request or forwards the UE context to a target serving AMF as
described in clause 5.15.5.2.3.
\- Step (C) is executed.
**(C)** The serving AMF shall determine a Registration Area such that all
S-NSSAIs of the Allowed NSSAI for this Registration Area are available in all
Tracking Areas of the Registration Area (and also considering other aspects as
described in clause 5.3.2.3 and clause 5.3.4.3.3) and then return to the UE
this Allowed NSSAI and the mapping of the Allowed NSSAI to the Subscribed
S-NSSAIs if provided. The AMF may return the rejected S-NSSAI(s) as described
in clause 5.15.4.1.
NOTE 6: The S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI for Non-3GPP access are available
homogeneously in the PLMN for the N3IWF case. For other types of Non 3GPP
access the S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI for Non-3GPP access can be not
available homogeneously all over the PLMN, for example different W-AGFs can
support different TAIs that support different network slices.
When either no Requested NSSAI was included, or the mapping of the S-NSSAIs in
Requested NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs is incorrect, or a Requested NSSAI is not
considered valid in the PLMN and as such at least one S-NSSAI in the Requested
NSSAI was rejected as not usable by the UE in the PLMN, or the UE indicated
that the Requested NSSAI is based on the Default Configured NSSAI, the AMF may
update the UE slice configuration information for the PLMN as described in
clause 5.15.4.2.
If the Requested NSSAI does not include S-NSSAIs which map to S-NSSAIs of the
HPLMN subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization and
the AMF determines that no S-NSSAI can be provided in the Allowed NSSAI for
the UE in the current UE\'s Tracking Area and if no default S-NSSAI(s) could
be added as described in step (A), the AMF shall reject the UE Registration
and shall include in the rejection message the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each
of them with the appropriate rejection cause value.
If the Requested NSSAI includes S-NSSAIs which map to S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN
subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, the AMF
shall include in the Registration Accept message an Allowed NSSAI containing
only those S-NSSAIs that are not to be subject to Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization and, based on the UE Context in AMF, those
S-NSSAIs for which Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for
at least one of the corresponding HPLMN S-NSSAIs succeeded previously
regardless the Access Type, if any.
The AMF shall also provide the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with
the appropriate rejection cause value.
If the AMF determined the Target NSSAI or received a Target NSSAI from the
NSSF, the AMF should provide the Target NSSAI to the PCF for retrieving a
corresponding RFSP as described in clause 5.3.4.3.1 or, if the PCF is not
deployed, the AMF should determine a corresponding RFSP based on local
configuration. Then the AMF provides the Target NSSAI and the corresponding
RFSP to the NG-RAN as described in clause 5.3.4.3.3. The S-NSSAIs which map to
S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN subject to an ongoing Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization shall be included in the Pending NSSAI and
removed from Allowed NSSAI. The Pending NSSAI may contain a mapping of the
S-NSSAI(s) for the Serving PLMN to the HPLMN S-NSSAIs, if applicable. The UE
shall not include in the Requested NSSAI any of the S-NSSAIs from the Pending
NSSAI the UE stores, regardless of the Access Type.
If:
\- all the S-NSSAI(s) in the Requested NSSAI are still to be subject to
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization; or
\- no Requested NSSAI was provided or none of the S-NSSAIs in the Requested
NSSAI matches any of the Subscribed S-NSSAIs, and all the S-NSSAI(s) marked as
default in the Subscribed S-NSSAIs are to be subject to Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization;
the AMF shall provide a \"NSSAA to be performed\" indicator and no Allowed
NSSAI to the UE in the Registration Accept message. Upon receiving the
Registration Accept message, the UE is registered in the PLMN but shall wait
for the completion of the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization without attempting to use any service provided by the PLMN on
any access, except e.g. emergency services (see TS 24.501 [47]), until the UE
receives an allowed NSSAI.
Then, the AMF shall initiate the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization procedure as described in clause 5.15.10 for each S-NSSAI that
requires it, except, based on Network policies, for those S-NSSAIs for which
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization have been already
initiated on another Access Type for the same S-NSSAI(s). At the end of the
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization steps, the AMF by
means of the UE Configuration Update procedure shall provide a new Allowed
NSSAI to the UE which also contains the S-NSSAIs subject to Network Slice-
Specific Authentication and Authorization for which the authentication and
authorization is successful. The AMF may perform AMF selection when NSSAA
completes for the S-NSSAIs subject to NSSAA. If an AMF change is required,
this shall be triggered by the AMF using the UE Configuration Update procedure
indicating a UE re-registration is required. The S-NSSAIs which were not
successfully authenticated and authorized are not included in the Allowed
NSSAI and are included in the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs with a rejection cause
value indicating Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization
failure.
Once completed the Network Slice-Specific (re-)Authentication and
(re-)Authorization procedure, if the AMF determines that no S-NSSAI can be
provided in the Allowed NSSAI for the UE, which is already authenticated and
authorized successfully by a PLMN, and if no default S-NSSAI(s) could be added
as described in step (A), the AMF shall execute the Network-initiated
Deregistration procedure described in clause 4.2.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3] and
shall include in the explicit De-Registration Request message the list of
Rejected S-NSSAIs, each of them with the appropriate rejection cause value.
If an S-NSSAI is rejected with a rejection cause value indicating Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization failure or revocation, the UE
can re-attempt to request the S-NSSAI based on policy, local in the UE.
##### 5.15.5.2.2 Modification of the Set of Network Slice(s) for a UE
The set of Network Slices for a UE can be changed at any time while the UE is
registered with a network, and may be initiated by the network, or by the UE,
under certain conditions as described below.
The network, based on local policies, subscription changes and/or UE mobility
and/or UE Dispersion data classification, operational reasons (e.g. a Network
Slice instance is no longer available or load level information or service
experience for a Network Slice or network slice instance provided by the
NWDAF), may change the set of Network Slice(s) to which the UE is registered
and provide the UE with a new Registration Area and/or Allowed NSSAI and the
mapping of this Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs, for each Access Type over
which the UE is registered. In addition, the network may provide the
Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN, the associated mapping information, and
the rejected S-NSSAIs. The network may perform such a change over each Access
Type during a Registration procedure or trigger a notification towards the UE
of the change of the Network Slices using a UE Configuration Update procedure
as specified in clause 4.2.4 of TS 23.502 [3]. The new Allowed NSSAI(s) and
the mapping to HPLMN S-NSSAIs are determined as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1
(an AMF Re-allocation may be needed). The AMF provides the UE with:
\- an indication that the acknowledgement from UE is required;
\- Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN (if required), rejected S-NSSAI(s)
(if required) and TAI list, and
\- the new Allowed NSSAI with the associated mapping of Allowed NSSAI for each
Access Type (as applicable) unless the AMF cannot determine the new Allowed
NSSAI (e.g. all S-NSSAIs in the old Allowed NSSAI have been removed from the
Subscribed S-NSSAIs).
Furthermore:
\- If the changes to the Allowed NSSAI require the UE to perform immediately a
Registration procedure because they affect the existing connectivity to AMF
(e.g. the new S-NSSAIs require a separate AMF that cannot be determined by the
current serving AMF, or the AMF cannot determine the Allowed NSSAI) or due to
AMF local policies also when the changes does not affect the existing
connectivity to AMF:
\- The serving AMF indicates to the UE the need for the UE to perform a
Registration procedure without including the GUAMI or 5G-S-TMSI in the access
stratum signalling after entering CM-IDLE state. The AMF shall release the NAS
signalling connection to the UE to allow to enter CM-IDLE after receiving the
acknowledgement from UE.
\- When the UE receives indications to perform a Registration procedure
without including the GUAMI or 5G-S-TMSI in the access stratum signalling
after entering CM-IDLE state, then:
\- The UE deletes any stored (old) Allowed NSSAI and associated mapping as
well as any (old) rejected S-NSSAI.
\- The UE shall initiate a Registration procedure with the registration type
Mobility Registration Update after the UE enters CM-IDLE state as specified in
as described in step 4 of clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. The UE shall
include a Requested NSSAI (as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1) with the
associated mapping of Requested NSSAI in the Registration Request message.
Also, the UE shall include, subject to the conditions set out in clause
5.15.9, a Requested NSSAI in access stratum signalling but no GUAMI.
If there is an established PDU Session associated with emergency services,
then the serving AMF indicates to the UE the need for the UE to perform a
Registration procedure but does not release the NAS signalling connection to
the UE. The UE performs the Registration procedure only after the release of
the PDU Session used for the emergency services.
In addition to sending the new Allowed NSSAI to the UE, when a Network Slice
used for a one or multiple PDU Sessions is no longer available for a UE, the
following applies:
\- If the Network Slice becomes no longer available under the same AMF (e.g.
due to UE subscription change), the AMF indicates to the SMF(s) which PDU
Session ID(s) corresponding to the relevant S-NSSAI shall be released. SMF
releases the PDU Session according to clause 4.3.4.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
\- If the Network Slice becomes no longer available upon a change of AMF (e.g.
due to Registration Area change), the new AMF indicates to the old AMF that
the PDU Session(s) corresponding to the relevant S-NSSAI shall be released.
The old AMF informs the corresponding SMF(s) to release the indicated PDU
Session(s). The SMF(s) release the PDU Session(s) as described in clause 4.3.4
of TS 23.502 [3]. Then the new AMF modifies the PDU Session Status
correspondingly. The PDU Session(s) context is locally released in the UE
after receiving the PDU Session Status in the Registration Accept message.
The UE uses either the URSP rules (which includes the NSSP) or the UE Local
Configuration as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of TS 23.503 [45] to determine
whether ongoing traffic can be routed over existing PDU Sessions belonging to
other Network Slices or establish new PDU Session(s) associated with
same/other Network Slice.
In order to change the set of S-NSSAIs the UE is registered to over an Access
Type, the UE shall initiate a Registration procedure over this Access Type as
specified in clause 5.15.5.2.1.
If, for an established PDU Session:
\- none of the values of the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN in the mapping of the
Requested NSSAI to S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN included in the Registration Request
matches the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN associated with the PDU Session; or
\- none of the values of the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI matches the value
of the S-NSSAI of HPLMN associated with the PDU Session and the mapping of the
Requested NSSAI to S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN is not included in the Registration
Request,
the network shall release this PDU Session as follows.
\- the AMF informs the corresponding SMF(s) to release the indicated PDU
Session(s). The SMF(s) release the PDU Session(s) as described in clause 4.3.4
of TS 23.502 [3]. Then the AMF modifies the PDU Session Status
correspondingly. The PDU Session(s) context is locally released in the UE
after receiving the PDU Session Status from the AMF.
A change of the set of S-NSSAIs (whether UE or Network initiated) to which the
UE is registered may, subject to operator policy, lead to AMF change, as
described in clause 5.15.5.2.1.
##### 5.15.5.2.3 AMF Re-allocation due to Network Slice(s) Support
During a Registration procedure in a PLMN, if the network decides that the UE
should be served by a different AMF based on Network Slice(s) aspects, then
the AMF that first received the Registration Request shall redirect the
Registration request to target AMF via the 5G-AN or via direct signalling
between the initial AMF and the target AMF. If the target AMF(s) are returned
from the NSSF and identified by a list of candidate AMF(s), the redirection
message shall only be sent via the direct signalling between the initial AMF
and the target AMF. If the redirection message is sent by the AMF via the
5G-AN, the message shall include information for selection of a new AMF to
serve the UE.
When during a Registration procedure the UE requests a new S-NSSAI which is
not supported in the UE\'s current Tracking Area, the serving AMF itself or by
interacting with the NSSF as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1 may determine a
Target NSSAI. The AMF provides the Target NSSAI to the NG-RAN and the NG-RAN
may apply redirection or handover of the UE to a cell in another TA supporting
the Target NSSAI as described in clause 5.3.4.3.3.
During a EPS to 5GS handover using N26 interface procedure, if the network
decides that the UE should be served by a different AMF based on Network
Slice(s) aspects, then the AMF, which received the Forward Relocation Request
from MME, shall forward the UE context to target AMF via direct signalling
between the initial AMF and the target AMF as described in clause 4.11.1.2.2
of TS 23.502 [3].
For a UE that is already registered, the system shall support a redirection
initiated by the network of a UE from its serving AMF to a target AMF due to
Network Slice(s) considerations (e.g. the operator has changed the mapping
between the Network Slice instances and their respective serving AMF(s)).
Operator policy determines whether redirection between AMFs is allowed.
#### 5.15.5.3 Establishing a PDU Session in a Network Slice
The PDU Session Establishment in a Network Slice instance to a DN allows data
transmission in a Network Slice instance. A PDU Session is associated to an
S-NSSAI and a DNN. A UE that is registered in a PLMN over an Access Type and
has obtained a corresponding Allowed NSSAI, shall indicate in the PDU Session
Establishment procedure the S-NSSAI according to the NSSP in the URSP rules or
according to the UE Local Configuration as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of TS
23.503 [45], and, if available, the DNN the PDU Session is related to. The UE
includes the appropriate S-NSSAI from this Allowed NSSAI and, if mapping of
the Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs was provided, an S-NSSAI with the
corresponding value from this mapping.
If the UE cannot determine any S-NSSAI after performing the association of the
application to a PDU Session according to clause 6.1.2.2.1 of TS 23.503 [45],
the UE shall not indicate any S-NSSAI in the PDU Session Establishment
procedure.
The network (HPLMN) may provision the UE with Network Slice selection policy
(NSSP) as part of the URSP rules, see clause 6.6.2 of TS 23.503 [45]. When the
Subscription Information contains more than one S-NSSAI and the network wants
to control/modify the UE usage of those S-NSSAIs, then the network
provisions/updates the UE with NSSP as part of the URSP rules. When the
Subscription Information contains only one S-NSSAI, the network needs not
provision the UE with NSSP as part of the URSP rules. The NSSP rules associate
an application with one or more HPLMN S-NSSAIs. A default rule which matches
all applications to a HPLMN S-NSSAI may also be included.
The UE shall store and use the URSP rules, including the NSSP, as described in
TS 23.503 [45]. When a UE application associated with a specific S-NSSAI
requests data transmission:
\- if the UE has one or more PDU Sessions established corresponding to the
specific S-NSSAI, the UE routes the user data of this application in one of
these PDU Sessions, unless other conditions in the UE prohibit the use of
these PDU Sessions. If the application provides a DNN, then the UE considers
also this DNN to determine which PDU Session to use. This is further described
in clause 6.6.2 of TS 23.503 [45].
\- If the UE does not have a PDU Session established with this specific
S-NSSAI, the UE requests a new PDU Session corresponding to this S-NSSAI and
with the DNN that may be provided by the application. In order for the RAN to
select a proper resource for supporting network slicing in the RAN, RAN needs
to be aware of the Network Slices used by the UE. This is further described in
clause 6.6.2 of TS 23.503 [45].
If the AMF is not able to determine the appropriate NRF to query for the
S-NSSAI provided by the UE, the AMF may query the NSSF with this specific
S-NSSAI, location information, PLMN ID of the SUPI. The NSSF determines and
returns the appropriate NRF to be used to select NFs/services within the
selected Network Slice instance. The NSSF may also return an NSI ID to be used
to select NFs within the selected Network Slice instance to use for this
S-NSSAI.
The AMF or NSSF may select a Network Slice instance based on load level and/or
Observe Service Experience and/or Dispersion analytics from NWDAF.
The IP address or FQDN of the NSSF is locally configured in the AMF.
SMF discovery and selection within the selected Network Slice instance is
initiated by the AMF when a SM message to establish a PDU Session is received
from the UE. The appropriate NRF is used to assist the discovery and selection
tasks of the required network functions for the selected Network Slice
instance.
The AMF queries the appropriate NRF to select an SMF in a Network Slice
instance based on S-NSSAI, DNN, NSI-ID (if available) and other information
e.g. UE subscription and local operator policies, when the UE triggers PDU
Session Establishment. The selected SMF establishes a PDU Session based on
S-NSSAI and DNN.
When the AMF belongs to multiple Network Slice instances, based on
configuration, the AMF may use an NRF at the appropriate level for the SMF
selection.
For further details on the SMF selection, refer to clause 4.3.2.2.3 of TS
23.502 [3].
When a PDU Session for a given S-NSSAI is established using a specific Network
Slice instance, the CN provides to the (R)AN the S-NSSAI corresponding to this
Network Slice instance to enable the RAN to perform access specific functions.
The UE shall not perform PDU Session handover from one Access Type to another
if the S-NSSAI of the PDU Session is not included in the Allowed NSSAI of the
target Access Type.
### 5.15.6 Network Slicing Support for Roaming
For roaming scenarios:
\- If the UE only uses standard S-NSSAI values, then the same S-NSSAI values
can be used in VPLMN as in the HPLMN.
\- If the VPLMN and HPLMN have an SLA to support non-standard S-NSSAI values
in the VPLMN, the NSSF of the VPLMN maps the Subscribed S-NSSAIs values to the
respective S-NSSAI values to be used in the VPLMN. The S-NSSAI values to be
used in the VPLMN are determined by the NSSF of the VPLMN based on the SLA.
The NSSF of the VPLMN need not inform the HPLMN of which values are used in
the VPLMN.
Depending on operator\'s policy and the configuration in the AMF, the AMF may
decide the S-NSSAI values to be used in the VPLMN and the mapping to the
Subscribed S-NSSAIs.
\- The UE constructs Requested NSSAI and provides the mapping of S-NSSAIs of
the Requested NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs if the mapping is stored in the UE, as
described in clause 5.15.5.2.1.
\- The NSSF in the VPLMN determines the Allowed NSSAI without interacting with
the HPLMN.
\- the HPLMN may provide NSSRG Information as part of the Subscription
information as described in clause 5.15.12.
\- The Allowed NSSAI in the Registration Accept includes S-NSSAI values used
in the VPLMN. The mapping information described above is also provided to the
UE with the Allowed NSSAI as described in clause 5.15.4.
\- If the S-NSSAI values are subject to NSAC, depending on operator\'s policy,
a roaming agreement or an SLA between VPLMN and HPLMN, the AMF or SMF in VPLMN
triggers a request for NSAC for these S-NSSAI values as described in clause
5.15.11.3.
\- In PDU Session Establishment procedure, the UE includes both:
(a) the S-NSSAI that matches the application (that is triggering the PDU
Session Request) within the NSSP in the URSP rules or within the UE Local
Configuration as defined in clause 6.1.2.2.1 of TS 23.503 [45]; the value of
this S NSSAI is used in the HPLMN; and
(b) an S-NSSAI belonging to the Allowed NSSAI that maps to (a) using the
mapping of the Allowed NSSAI to HPLMN S-NSSAIs; the value of this S-NSSAI is
used in the VPLMN.
For the home routed case, the V-SMF sends the PDU Session Establishment
Request message to the H-SMF along with the S-NSSAI with the value used in the
HPLMN (a). If the S-NSSAI values are subject to NSAC, the V-SMF or H-SMF
triggers a request for NSAC for these S-NSSAI values as described in clause
5.15.11.3.
\- When a PDU Session is established, the CN provides to the AN the S-NSSAI
with the value from the VPLMN corresponding to this PDU Session, as described
in clause 5.15.5.3.
\- The Network Slice instance specific network functions in the VPLMN are
selected by the VPLMN by using the S-NSSAI with the value used in the VPLMN
and querying an NRF that has either been pre-configured, or provided by the
NSSF in the VPLMN. The Network Slice specific functions of the HPLMN (if
applicable) are selected by the VPLMN by using the related S-NSSAI with the
value used in the HPLMN via the support from an appropriate NRF in the HPLMN,
identified as specified in clause 4.17.5 of TS 23.502 [3] and, for SMF in
clause 4.3.2.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
### 5.15.7 Network slicing and Interworking with EPS
#### 5.15.7.1 General
A 5GS supports Network Slicing and might need to interwork with the EPS in its
PLMN or in other PLMNs as specified in clause 5.17.2. The EPC may support the
Dedicated Core Networks (DCN). In some deployments, the MME selection may be
assisted by a DCN-ID provided by the UE to the RAN (see TS 23.401 [26]).
Mobility between 5GC to EPC does not guarantee all active PDU Session(s) can
be transferred to the EPC.
During PDN connection establishment in the EPC, the UE allocates the PDU
Session ID and sends it to the SMF+PGW-C via PCO. As described in clause
4.11.0a.5 of TS 23.502 [3], an S-NSSAI associated with the PDN connection is
determined based on the S-NSSAI(s) supported by the SMF+PGW-C, the Subscribed
S-NSSAI from UDM and the operator policy by the SMF+PGW-C, e.g. based on a
combination of SMF+PGW-C address and APN, and is sent to the UE in PCO
together with a PLMN ID that the S-NSSAI relates to. In Home Routed roaming
case, the UE receives a HPLMN S-NSSAI value from the SMF+PGW-C. If the
SMF+PGW-C supports more than one S-NSSAI and the APN is valid for more than
one S-NSSAI, the SMF+PGW-C should only select an S-NSSAI that is mapped to the
subscribed S-NSSAI of the UE and this subscribed S-NSSAI is not subject to
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization. The UE stores this
S-NSSAI and the PLMN ID associated with the PDN connection. The UE derives
Requested NSSAI by taking into account of the received PLMN ID. The Requested
NSSAI is included in the NAS Registration Request message and, subject to the
conditions in clause 5.15.9, the RRC message carrying this Registration
Request when the UE registers in 5GC if the UE is non-roaming or the UE has
Configured NSSAI for the VPLMN in roaming case. If the UE has no Configured
NSSAI of the VPLMN, the UE includes the HPLMN S-NSSAIs in the NAS Registration
Request message as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1.
When UE moves from EPS to 5GS, AMF reallocation may happen as described in
clause 5.15.7.2 and clause 5.15.7.3.
NOTE: It is assumed that if a MME is configured with a N26 interface towards
an AMF, the MME has N26 interfaces with all AMFs serving the same area than
the initial AMF and that can serve UE subject to EPS to 5GS mobility.
#### 5.15.7.2 Idle mode aspects
In addition to the interworking principles documented in clause 5.17.2 the
following applies for interworking with N26:
\- When UE moves from 5GS to EPS, the UE context information sent by AMF to
MME includes the UE Usage type, which is retrieved from UDM by AMF as part of
subscription data.
\- When UE moves from EPS to 5GS, then the UE includes the S-NSSAIs (with
values for the Serving PLMN of the target 5GS, if available) associated with
the established PDN connections in the Requested NSSAI in RRC Connection
Establishment (subject to the conditions set out in clause 5.15.9) and NAS.
The UE also provides to the AMF in the Registration Request message the
mapping information as described in clause 5.15.6. The UE derives the S-NSSAIs
values for the Serving PLMN by using the latest available information from EPS
(if received in PCO) and from 5GS (e.g. based on URSP, Configured NSSAI,
Allowed NSSAI). In the home-routed roaming case, the AMF selects default
V-SMFs. The SMF+PGW-C sends PDU Session IDs and related S-NSSAIs to AMF. The
AMF derives S-NSSAI values for the Serving PLMN as described in clause
5.15.5.2.1 and determines whether the AMF is the appropriate AMF to serve the
UE. If not, the AMF reallocation may need be triggered. For each PDU Session
the AMF determines whether the V-SMF need be reselected based on the
associated S-NSSAI value for the Serving PLMN. If the V-SMF need be
reallocated, i.e. change from the default V-SMF to another V-SMF, the AMF
trigger the V-SMF reallocation as described in clause 4.23.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
In addition to the interworking principles documented in clause 5.17.2 the
following applies for interworking without N26:
\- When the UE initiates the Registration procedure, and subject to the
conditions set out in clause 5.15.9, the UE includes the S-NSSAI (with values
for the Serving PLMN of the target 5GS) associated with the established PDN
connections in the Requested NSSAI in the RRC Connection Establishment.
\- The UE includes the S-NSSAIs (with values for the Serving PLMN of the
target 5GS, if available) and the HPLMN S-NSSAI received in the PCO for the
PDN connections as mapping information when moving PDN connections to 5GC
using PDU Session Establishment Request message. The UE derives the S-NSSAIs
values for the Serving PLMN by using, the latest available information from
EPS (if received in PCO) and from 5GS (e.g. based on URSP, Configured NSSAI,
Allowed NSSAI).
#### 5.15.7.3 Connected mode aspects
In addition to the interworking principles documented in clause 5.17.2 the
following applies for interworking with N26:
\- When a UE is CM-CONNECTED in 5GC and a handover to EPS occur, the AMF
selects the target MME based on the source AMF Region ID, AMF Set ID and
target location information. The AMF forwards the UE context to the selected
MME over the N26 Interface. In the UE context, the AMF also includes the UE
Usage type, if it is received as part of subscription data. The Handover
procedure is executed as documented in TS 23.502 [3]. When the Handover
procedure completes successfully the UE performs a Tracking Area Update. This
completes the UE registration in the target EPS. As part of this the UE
obtains a DCN-ID if the target EPS uses it.
\- When a UE is ECM-CONNECTED in EPC, and performs a handover to 5GS, the MME
selects the target AMF based on target location information, e.g. TAI and any
other available local information (including the UE Usage Type if one is
available for the UE in the subscription data) and forwards the UE context to
the selected AMF over the N26 interface. In the home-routed roaming case, the
AMF selects default V-SMFs. The Handover procedure is executed as documented
in TS 23.502 [3]. The SMF+PGW-C sends PDU Session IDs and related S-NSSAIs to
AMF. Based on the received S-NSSAIs values the target AMF derives the S-NSSAI
values for the Serving PLMN, the target AMF reselects a final target AMF if
necessary as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1, the AMF reallocation procedure is
triggered. For each PDU Session based on the associated derived S-NSSAI values
if the V-SMF need be reallocated, the final target AMF triggers the V-SMF
reallocation as described in clause 4.23.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. When the Handover
procedure completes successfully the UE performs a Registration procedure.
This completes the UE registration in the target 5GS and as part of this the
UE obtains an Allowed NSSAI.
### 5.15.8 Configuration of Network Slice availability in a PLMN
A Network Slice may be available in the whole PLMN or in one or more Tracking
Areas of the PLMN.
The availability of a Network Slice refers to the support of the S-NSSAI in
the involved NFs. In addition, policies in the NSSF may further restrict from
using certain Network Slices in a particular TA, e.g. depending on the HPLMN
of the UE.
The availability of a Network Slice in a TA is established end-to-end using a
combination of OAM and signalling among network functions. It is derived by
using the S-NSSAIs supported per TA in 5G-AN, the S-NSSAIs supported in the
AMF and operator policies per TA in the NSSF.
The AMF learns the S-NSSAIs supported per TA by the 5G-AN when the 5G-AN nodes
establish or update the N2 connection with the AMF (see TS 38.413 [34]) and TS
38.300 [27]). One or all AMF per AMF Set provides and updates the NSSF with
the S-NSSAIs support per TA. The 5G-AN learns the S-NSSAIs per PLMN ID the
AMFs it connects to support when the 5G-AN nodes establishes the N2 connection
with the AMF or when the AMF updates the N2 connection with the 5G-AN (see TS
38.413 [34] and TS 38.300 [27]).
The NSSF may be configured with operator policies specifying under what
conditions the S-NSSAIs can be restricted per TA and per HPLMN of the UE.
The per TA restricted S-NSSAIs may be provided to the AMFs of the AMF Sets at
setup of the network and whenever changed.
The AMF may be configured for the S-NSSAIs it supports with operator policies
specifying any restriction per TA and per HPLMN of the UE.
### 5.15.9 Operator-controlled inclusion of NSSAI in Access Stratum Connection
Establishment
The Serving PLMN can control per Access Type which (if any) NSSAI the UE
includes in the Access Stratum when establishing a connection caused by
Service Request, Periodic Registration Update or Registration procedure used
to update the UE capabilities. In addition, the Home and Visited PLMNs can
also instruct the UE to never include NSSAI in the Access Stratum, regardless
of the procedure that causes a RRC Connection to be established, i.e. to
always enable privacy for the NSSAI).
During the Registration procedure, the AMF may provide to the UE in the
Registration Accept message, an Access Stratum Connection Establishment NSSAI
Inclusion Mode parameter, indicating whether and when the UE shall include
NSSAI information in the Access Stratum Connection Establishment (e.g. an RRC
connection Establishment defined in TS 38.331 [28]) according to one of these
modes:
a) The UE shall include an NSSAI set to the Allowed NSSAI, if available, in
the Access Stratum Connection Establishment caused by a Service Request,
Periodic Registration Update or Registration procedure used to update the UE
capabilities;
b) The UE shall include a NSSAI with the following content:
\- for the case of Access Stratum Connection Establishment caused by a Service
Request: an NSSAI including the S-NSSAI(s) of the Network Slice(s) that
trigger the Access Stratum Connection Establishment; i.e. all the S-NSSAIs of
the PDU sessions that have the User Plane reactivated by the Service Request,
or the S-NSSAIs of the Network Slices a Control Plane interaction triggering
the Service Request is related to, e.g. for SM it would be the S-NSSAI of the
PDU Session the SM message is about;
\- for the case of Access Stratum Connection Establishment caused by a
Periodic Registration Update or Registration procedure used to update the UE
capabilities, an NSSAI set to the Allowed NSSAI;
c) The UE shall not include any NSSAI in the Access Stratum Connection
Establishment caused by Service Request, Periodic Registration Update or
Registration procedure used to update the UE capabilities; or
d) The UE shall not provide NSSAI in the Access stratum.
For the case of Access Stratum Connection Establishment caused by Mobility
Registration Update or Initial Registration in modes a), b) or c) the UE shall
include the Requested NSSAI provided by the NAS layer and defined in clause
5.15.5.2.1.
For all UEs that are allowed to use modes a), b) or c), the Access Stratum
Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode should be the same over the same
Registration Areas.The UE shall store and comply to the required behaviour for
a PLMN per Access Type as part of the network slicing configuration. The
Serving PLMN AMF shall not instruct the UE to operate in any other mode than
mode d) in 3GPP Access Type unless the HPLMN provides an indication that it is
allowed to do so (i.e. if a PLMN allows behaviours a,b,c, then its UDM sends
to the serving AMF an explicit indication that the NSSAI can be included in
RRC as part of the subscription data).
The UE default mode of operation is the following:
\- For 3GPP access the UE shall by default operate in mode d) unless it has
been provided with an indication to operate in mode a), b) or c).
\- For untrusted non-3GPP access the UE shall operate by default in mode b)
unless it has been provided with an indication to operate in mode a), c) or
d).
\- For trusted non-3GPP access the UE shall operate by default in mode d)
unless it has been provided with an indication to operate in mode a), b) or
c).
\- For W-5GAN access the 5G-RG shall operate by default in mode b) unless it
has been provided with an indication to operate in mode a), c) or d).
An operator may pre-configure the UE to operate by default according to mode
c) in the HPLMN (i.e. the UE by default includes NSSAI in the access stratum
when it performs an Initial Registration and Mobility Registration Update with
the HPLMN until the HPLMN changes the mode as described above).
### 5.15.10 Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization
A serving PLMN or SNPN shall perform Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization for the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN or SNPN which are subject to it
based on subscription information. The UE shall indicate in the Registration
Request message in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability whether it supports
NSSAA feature. If the UE does not support NSSAA feature and if the UE requests
any of these S-NSSAIs that are subject to Network Slice-Specific
Authentication and Authorization, the AMF shall not trigger this procedure for
the UE and they are rejected for the PLMN or SNPN. If the UE supports NSSAA
feature and if the UE requests any of these S-NSSAIs that are subject to
Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization, they are included in
the list of Pending NSSAI for the PLMN or SNPN, as described in clause
5.15.5.2.1.
If a UE is configured with S-NSSAIs, which are subject to Network Slice-
Specific Authentication and Authorization, the UE stores an association
between the S-NSSAI and corresponding credentials for the Network Slice-
Specific Authentication and Authorization.
NOTE 1: How the UE is aware that an S-NSSAI is subject to Network Slice-
Specific Authentication and Authorization (e.g., based on local configuration)
is out of scope of this specification.
The UE may support remote provisioning of credentials for NSSAA, specified in
clause 5.39.
A UE that supports to be provisioned with the credentials used for NSSAA over
UP remote provisioning shall use connectivity over an S-NSSAI/DNN which can
access the provisioning server to establish a PDU session for remote
provisioning as defined in clause 5.39.
NOTE 2: The credentials for Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization are not specified.
To perform the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for an
S-NSSAI, the AMF invokes an EAP- based Network Slice-Specific authorization
procedure documented in clause 4.2.9 of TS 23.502 [3] (see also TS 33.501
[29]) for the S-NSSAI. When an NSSAA procedure is started and is ongoing for
an S-NSSAI, the AMF stores the NSSAA status of the S-NSSAI as pending and when
the NSSAA is completed the S-NSSAI becomes either part of the Allowed NSSAI or
a Rejected S-NSSAI. The NSSAA status of each S-NSSAI, if any is stored, is
transferred when the AMF changes.
This procedure can be invoked for a supporting UE by an AMF at any time, e.g.
when:
a. The UE registers with the AMF and one of the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN or SNPN
which maps to an S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI is requiring Network Slice-
Specific Authentication and Authorization (see clause 5.15.5.2.1 for details),
and the S-NSSAI in the Requested NSSAI can be added to the Allowed NSSAI by
the AMF once the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for
the HPLMN or SNPN S-NSSAI succeeds; or
b. The Network Slice-Specific AAA Server triggers a UE re-authentication and
re-authorization for an S-NSSAI; or
c. The AMF, based on operator policy or a subscription change, decides to
initiate the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure
for a certain S-NSSAI which was previously authorized.
In the case of re-authentication and re-authorization (b. and c. above) the
following applies:
\- If S-NSSAIs that are requiring Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization map to S-NSSAIs that are included in the Allowed NSSAI for each
Access Type, AMF selects an Access Type to be used to perform the Network
Slice Specific Authentication and Authorization procedure based on network
policies.
\- If the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization for some
S-NSSAIs mapped to some S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI is unsuccessful, the AMF
shall update the Allowed NSSAI for each Access Type to the UE via UE
Configuration Update procedure.
\- If the Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization fails for
all S-NSSAIs mapped to all S-NSSAIs in the Allowed NSSAI, the AMF determines a
new Allowed NSSAI including default S-NSSAI(s). If no default S-NSSAI(s) could
be added, the AMF shall execute the Network-initiated Deregistration procedure
described in clause 4.2.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3] and shall include in the
explicit De-Registration Request message the list of Rejected S-NSSAIs, each
of them with the appropriate rejection cause value.
After a successful or unsuccessful UE Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorization, the UE context in the AMF shall retain the authentication
and authorization status for the UE for the related specific S-NSSAI of the
HPLMN or SNPN while the UE remains RM-REGISTERED in the PLMN or SNPN, so that
the AMF is not required to execute a Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization for a UE at every Periodic Registration Update or Mobility
Registration procedure with the PLMN or SNPN.
A Network Slice-Specific AAA server may revoke the authorization or challenge
the authentication and authorization of a UE at any time. When authorization
is revoked for an S-NSSAI that maps to an S-NSSAI in the current Allowed NSSAI
for an Access Type, the AMF shall provide a new Allowed NSSAI to the UE and
trigger the release of all PDU sessions associated with the S-NSSAI, for this
Access Type.
The AMF provides the GPSI of the UE related to the S-NSSAI to the AAA Server
to allow the AAA server to initiate the Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorization, or the Authorization revocation procedure, where the
current AMF serving the UE needs to be identified by the system, so the UE
authorization status can be challenged or revoked.
The Network Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorization requires that the
UE Primary Authentication and Authorization of the SUPI has successfully
completed. If the SUPI authorization is revoked, then also the Network Slice-
Specific authorization is revoked.
### 5.15.11 Network Slice Admission Control
#### 5.15.11.0 General
The Network Slice Admission Control Function (NSACF) monitors and controls the
number of registered UEs per network slice and/or the number of PDU Sessions
per network slice for the network slices that are subject to Network Slice
Admission Control (NSAC). The NSACF is configured with the maximum number of
UEs and/or the maximum number of PDU Sessions allowed to be served per S-NSSAI
subject to NSAC. The NSACF is also configured with information indicating
applicable access type(s) for the S-NSSAI (i.e. 3GPP Access Type, Non-3GPP
Access Type, or both).
The NSACF also provides event-based Network Slice status notifications and
reports to the consumer NFs (e.g. AF).
The NSACF may be responsible for one or more S-NSSAIs. There may be one or
multiple NSACFs deployed in a network as follows:
\- If the network is configured with a single service area, there is a single
NSACF configured with the maximum number of UEs per network slice and/or the
maximum number of PDU Sessions per network slice, which are valid in the
network.
\- If the network is configured with multiple service areas, an NSACF may be
deployed on a service area basis, which can be one NSACF instance or one NSACF
Set. Each NSACF is configured with the maximum number of UEs per network slice
and/or the maximum number of PDU Sessions which are valid in the service area.
If multiple NSACFs are configured in a PLMN or an SNPN for a network slice, a
NSACF is configured with a maximum number of UEs and/or a maximum number of
PDU Sessions specific for the service area and the Network Slice.
NOTE 1: When multiple NSACFs are deployed, how the maximum number of UEs per
network slice and the maximum number of PDU Sessions per network slice is
distributed among multiple NSACFs, is implementation specific.
NOTE 2: When multiple NSACFs are deployed, the UE moves to new service area
with a different NSACF, and if the number of UE or PDU Sessions in the target
NSACF has reached the maximum number, whether the session continuity can be
guaranteed is left to implementation.
Subject to operator policy and national/regional regulations, the AMF may
exempt UEs and the SMF may exempt PDU sessions from NSAC when the UE and/or
PDU Session is used for Emergency service or for Critical and Priority
services (e.g. MCX, MPS).
When the AMF receives a Registration Request for an Emergency Registration, or
with a Registration Request with an Establishment Cause indicating a priority
service (e.g. MCX, MPS) or when the AMF determines that there is a priority
subscription (e.g., MPS, MCX) in the UDM, the AMF may accept the registration
request without applying NSAC, i.e. the AMF triggers the NSAC procedure, but
the response from the NSACF is ignored at the AMF.
When the SMF receives a PDU Session Establishment Request for an emergency PDU
Session or a PDU Session Establishment Request with a priority header, the SMF
may accept the PDU Session Establishment Request without applying NSAC, i.e.
the SMF triggers the NSAC procedure, but the response from the NSACF is
ignored at the SMF.
Alternatively, when NSAC is exempted for the UE and/or PDU Session, the AMF
and the SMF skip the corresponding NSAC procedure, i.e. this UE (respectively
PDU Session) is not counted towards the maximum number of UEs (respectively
PDU Sessions).
The support of NSAC for the S-NSSAI used for onboarding as described in clause
5.30.2.10 is optional and subject to Onboarding Network operator policies.
However, NSAC for S-NSSAI used for onboarding is not applicable to UEs that
registered in ON-SNPN with Registration Type \"SNPN Onboarding\".
#### 5.15.11.1 Network Slice Admission Control for maximum number of UEs
The NSACF keeps track of the current number of UEs registered for a network
slice so that it can ensure it does not exceed the maximum number of UEs
allowed to register with the network slice. The NSACF also maintains a list of
UE IDs registered with a network slice that is subject to NSAC. When an event
related to a UE causes the current number of UEs registered with a network
slice to increase, the NSACF first checks whether the UE Identity is already
in the list of UEs registered with that network slice. If not, the NSACF
checks whether the maximum number of UEs per network slice for that network
slice has already been reached and if it has, the NSACF applies admission
control policies.
The AMF triggers a request to NSACF for NSAC for maximum number of UEs when
the UE\'s registration status for a network slice subject to NSAC is changing,
i.e. during the UE Registration procedure in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502
[3], UE Deregistration procedure in clause 4.2.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3], Network
Slice-Specific Authentication and Authorisation procedure in clause 4.2.9.2 of
TS 23.502 [3], AAA Server triggered Network Slice-Specific Re-authentication
and Re-authorization procedure in clause 4.2.9.3 of TS 23.502 [3], AAA Server
triggered Slice-Specific Authorization Revocation in clause 4.2.9.4 of TS
23.502 [3] and UE Configuration Update procedure in clause 4.2.4.2 of TS
23.502 [3].
NOTE 1: Early Admission Control (EAC) mode is applicable for Number of UEs per
network slice admission control. The use of EAC in relation to the number of
registered UEs is described in clauses 4.2.11.2 and 4.2.11.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
Since the UE may register or deregister for an S-NSSAI via 3GPP access and/or
non-3GPP access as described in clause 5.15.5.2.1. The Allowed NSSAI for the
access type may change while the UE is registering to a network. The AMF
provides the Access Type to the NSACF when triggering a request to increase or
decrease the current number of UEs registered with a S-NSSAI. The NSACF may
take the Access Type into account for increasing and decreasing the number of
UEs per network slice by storing the UE ID with the associated one or more
Access Type(s), i.e. the NSACF is able to add or remove a registration for the
UE ID for each Access Type and trigger the increase or decrease of the current
number of UEs registered with a S-NSSAI based on a policy that takes the
access type into account. If the Access Type provided by the AMF is not
configured for NSAC in the NSACF, the NSACF always accepts the request from
the AMF without increasing or decreasing the number of UEs. If the Access Type
provided by the AMF is configured for NSAC in the NSACF and the maximum number
is reached, the NSACF sends a reject response to the AMF including the access
type.
NOTE 2: For example, if the NSACF is configured to apply NSAC for 3GPP Access
Type only, the NSACF counts registration via 3GPP access type only. If the
NSACF is configured to apply NSAC for both Access Types, and the UE newly
registers via 3GPP access while the UE is already registered via non-3GPP
access (or vice versa), the NSACF updates the UE ID entry with both 3GPP
Access Type and non-3GPP Access Type and the NSACF may count the UE once or
twice based on its policy.
#### 5.15.11.2 Network Slice Admission Control for maximum number of PDU
sessions
The NSACF keeps track of the current number of PDU Sessions per network slice
so that it can ensure it does not exceed the maximum number of PDU session
allowed to be served by the network slice. When an event related to a UE
causes the current number of PDU sessions established within the network slice
is to increase, the NSACF checks whether the maximum number of PDU sessions
per network slice for that network slice has already been reached and if it
has, the NSACF applies admission control policies.
The anchor SMF triggers a request to NSACF for maximum number of PDU sessions
per network slice control during PDU session establishment/release procedures
in clauses 4.3.2 and 4.3.4 of TS 23.502 [3].
The SMF provides the Access Type to the NSACF when triggering a request to
increase or decrease the number of PDU Sessions. The NSACF takes Access Type
into account for increasing and decreasing the current number of PDU Sessions
depending on the applicability of the Access Type for the NSAC for maximum
number of PDU Sessions for the S-NSSAI.
NOTE 1: For MA PDU Session, the SMF provides the Access Type to NSACF when the
user plane connection is about to be established or released in the
corresponding access network. With this, the SMF provides one or two Access
Types for the MA PDU Session in the same request message to the NSACF. The
NSACF can reject a single or both Access Types depending on the applicability
of the Access Type for the NSAC.
NOTE 2: I-SMF does not interact with NSCAF.
#### 5.15.11.3 Network Slice Admission Control for Roaming
In the case of roaming, depending on operator\'s policy, a roaming agreement
or an SLA between the VPLMN and the HPLMN, NSAC of roaming UEs is performed by
the VPLMN or HPLMN. The following principles apply:
For NSAC of roaming UEs for maximum number of UEs per network slice and/or
maximum number of PDU Sessions per network slice managed by the VPLMN, the
following principles shall be used:
\- Each S-NSSAI of the HPLMN that is subject to NSAC is mapped to a
corresponding S-NSSAI of the VPLMN subject to NSAC, depending on VPLMN
operator\'s policy and the configuration.
\- For NSAC for the maximum number of UEs for S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, a NSACF in
the VPLMN can be configured with the maximum number of allowed roaming UEs per
mapped S-NSSAI of the HPLMN for a S-NSSAI of the HPLMN that is subject to
NSAC. In such a case, the AMFs trigger a request to a NSACF of the VPLMN.
\- For NSAC for the maximum number of PDU Sessions for S-NSSAI of the HPLMN, a
NSACF in the VPLMN can be configured with the maximum number of allowed PDU
Sessions in LBO mode per mapped S-NSSAI of the HPLMN for a S-NSSAI of the
HPLMN that is subject to NSAC. In such a case, the anchor SMF in the VPLMN
triggers a request to a NSACF of the VPLMN.
\- For NSAC for the maximum number of UEs for S-NSSAI of the VPLMN, AMFs
trigger a request to a NSACF of the VPLMN to perform NSAC based on the S-NSSAI
of the VPLMN subject to NSAC. The NSACF of the HPLMN is not involved.
\- For NSAC for the maximum number of PDU Sessions for S-NSSAI of the VPLMN in
the LBO roaming case, the SMF triggers a request to a NSACF of the VPLMN to
perform NSAC based on the S-NSSAI of the VPLMN subject to NSAC. The NSACF of
the HPLMN is not involved.
‐ The AMF or SMF (in LBO roaming case) in the VPLMN provides both the S-NSSAI
in the VPLMN and the corresponding mapped S-NSSAI in the HPLMN to the NSACF in
the VPLMN. The NSACF in the VPLMN performs NSAC for both S-NSSAI of the VPLMN
and the corresponding mapped S-NSSAI of the HPLMN based on the SLA between the
VPLMN and the HPLMN.
For NSAC for roaming UEs for maximum number of PDU Sessions per network slice
managed by the HPLMN, the following principles shall be used:
\- For PDU sessions in the home-routed roaming case, the SMF in the HPLMN
performs NSAC for the S-NSSAI(s) subject to NSAC.
NOTE: The NSAC for maximum number PDU session in LBO mode and maximum number
of roaming UEs when the NSAC is managed by a NSACF in the HPLMN is not
supported in this Release of the specification.
#### 5.15.11.4 Network Slice status notifications and reports to a consumer NF
A consumer NF (e.g. AF) can subscribe with the NSACF for Network Slice status
notifications and reports. Upon such subscription, the NSACF can provide event
based notifications and reports to the consumer NF (e.g. to AF via NEF)
related to the current number of UEs registered for a network slice or the
current number of PDU Sessions established on a network slice.
#### 5.15.11.5 Support of Network Slice Admission Control and Interworking
with EPC
If EPS counting is required for a network slice, the NSAC for maximum number
of UEs and/or for maximum number of PDU Sessions per network slice is
performed at the time of PDN connection establishment in case of EPC
interworking. To support the NSAC for maximum number of UEs and/or for maximum
number of PDU Sessions per network slice in EPC, the SMF+PGW-C is configured
with the information indicating which network slice is subject to NSAC. During
PDN connection establishment in EPC, the SMF+PGW-C selects an S-NSSAI
associated with the PDN connection as described in clause 5.15.7.1. If the
selected S-NSSAI by the SMF+PGW-C is subject to the NSAC, the SMF+PGW-C
triggers interaction with NSACF to check the availability of the network slice
by invoking separate NSAC procedures for number of UE and number of PDU
Session (as described in clause 4.11.5.9 of TS 23.502 [3]), before the
SMF+PGW-C provides the selected S-NSSAI to the UE. If the network slice is
available, the SMF+PGW-C continues to proceed with the PDN connection
establishment procedure.
The NSACF performs the following for checking network slice availability prior
to returning a response to the SMF+PGW-C:
\- For NSAC for number of UEs, if the UE identity is already included in the
list of UE IDs registered with a network slice, or the UE identity is not
included in the list of UE IDs registered with a network slice and the current
number of UE registration did not reach the maximum number, the NSACF responds
to the SMF+PGW-C with the information that the network slice is available. The
NSACF includes the UE identity in the list of UE IDs if not already on the
list and increases the current number of UE registration. Otherwise, the NSACF
returns a response indicating that the maximum number with the network slice
has been reached.
\- For NSAC for number of PDU Sessions, if the current number of PDU sessions
is below the maximum number, the NSACF responds to the SMF+PGW-C with the
information that the network slice is available. The NSACF increases the
current number of PDU sessions. Otherwise, the NSACF returns the response
indicating that the maximum number with the network slice has been reached.
If the maximum number of UEs and/or the maximum number of PDU sessions has
already been reached, unless operator policy implements a different action,
the SMF+PGW-C rejects the PDN connection.
NOTE 1: As an implementation option, if the APN is mapped to more than one
S-NSSAI and the first selected S-NSSAI is not available (e.g. either current
number of UE registration reached maximum or current number of PDU sessions
reached maximum), then based on the operator policy the PGW-C+SMF can try
another mapped S-NSSAI for the PDN connection establishment procedure.
If the establishment of a new PDN Connections is with a different SMF+PGW-C
from the SMF+PGW-C used for already existing PDN connection associated with
the same S-NSSAI, each SMF+PGW-C will send a request for update (e.g. increase
or decrease) to the NSACF. The NSACF may maintain a registration entry per
SMF+PGW-C for the same UE ID.
The SMF+PGW-C provides the Access Type to the NSACF when triggering a request
to increase or decrease the number of UEs and/or the number of PDU Sessions
for an S-NSSAI.
NOTE 2: The SMF+PGW-C determines the Access Type based on the RAT type
parameter in the PMIP or GTP message received from the ePDG; or alternatively
it can internally determine the Access Type based on the source node (e.g.
SGW) sending the request for the PDN Connection establishment.
When the UE with ongoing PDN connection(s) moves from EPC to 5GC, the
SMF+PGW-C triggers a request to decrease the number of the UE registration in
NSACF and the AMF triggers a request to increase the number of the UE
registration in NSACF when the UE is registered in the new AMF. If there are
more than one PDN connections associated with the S-NSSAI, the NSACF may
receive multiple requests for the same S-NSSAI from different SMF+PGW-Cs. When
the UE with ongoing PDU session(s) moves from 5GC to EPC, the SMF+PGW-C
triggers a request to increase the number of the UE registration in NSACF and
the old AMF triggers a request to decrease the number of the UE registration
in NSACF when the UE is deregistered in old AMF. If there are more than one
PDU sessions associated with the S-NSSAI, the NSACF may receive multiple
requests for the same S-NSSAI from different SMF+PGW-Cs. The NSACF maintains a
list of UE IDs based on the requests from SMF+PGW-C(s) and AMF, and adjusts
the current number of registrations accordingly.
When EPS counting is performed for a network slice, and the UE with ongoing
PDN connection(s) moves from EPC to 5GC, session continuity is guaranteed from
NSAC standpoint, as the admission was granted at the time of PDN connection
establishment, i.e. the number of PDU session is not counted again in 5GC.
Similarly, when the UE with ongoing PDU session(s) moves from 5GC to EPC,
session continuity is guaranteed from NSAC standpoint as the admission of the
PDN Connection(s) to the network slice was already granted at the time of PDU
Session establishment in 5GC.
If the PDN connection associated with S-NSSAI is released in EPC, the
SMF+PGW-C triggers a request (i.e. decrease) to NSACF for maximum number of
UEs and/or maximum number of PDU sessions per network slice control. The NSACF
decreases the current number of registrations and removes the UE identity from
the list of UE IDs if the PDN connection(s) associated with the S-NSSAI are
all released in EPC.
NOTE 3: NSAC in EPC is not performed for the attachment without PDN
connectivity.
If EPS counting is not required for a network slice, the NSAC for maximum
number of UEs and/or for maximum number of PDU Sessions per network slice is
performed when the UE moves from EPC to 5GC, i.e. when the UE performs
mobility Registration procedure from EPC to 5GC (NSAC for maximum number of
UEs per network slice) and/or when the PDN connections are handed over from
EPC to 5GC (NSAC for maximum number of PDU Sessions per network slice). The
SMF+PGW-C is configured with the information indicating the network slice is
subject to NSAC only in 5GS. The PDN connection interworking procedure is
performed as described in clause 5.15.7.1. Mobility from EPC to 5GC does not
guarantee all active PDU Session(s) can be transferred to the 5GC in certain
circumstances when either the current number of UE registration or the current
number of PDU sessions would exceed the maximum number when the UE moves from
EPC to 5GC. When the UE with ongoing PDU session(s) moves from 5GC to EPC, the
SMF+PGW-C triggers a request to decrease the number of PDU Session to NSACF.
If there are more than one PDU sessions associated with the S-NSSAI, the NSACF
may receive multiple requests for the same S-NSSAI from different SMF+PGW-Cs
and NSACF removes the PDU Session ID(s) while decreasing the number of PDU
Sessions(s).
NOTE 4: Given that session continuity is not guaranteed when EPS counting is
not required, it is recommended for services which require the session
continuity to support EPS counting.
NOTE 5: When multiple NSACFs are deployed and if the number of UE in target
NSACF has reached the maximum number, whether session continuity can be
guaranteed is left to implementation.
### 5.15.12 Support of subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous
registration of network slices
#### 5.15.12.1 General
The subscription information for a UE may include for each S-NSSAI Network
Slice Simultaneous Registration Group (NSSRG) information constraining which
S-NSSAIs can be simultaneously provided to the UE in the Allowed NSSAI.
When S-NSSAIs have associated NSSRG information, then the S-NSSAIs in the
Allowed NSSAI shall share at least one NSSRG.
The NSSRG information, defining the association of S-NSSAIs to NSSRG, is
provided as an additional and separate information.
If the optional NSSRG information is not present for the S-NSSAIs of a
subscription, and other restrictions do not apply e.g. availability at a
specific location, then it is assumed that all the S-NSSAIs in the
subscription information can be simultaneously provided to the UE in the
Allowed NSSAI. However, if NSSRG information is present in the subscription
information, at least one NSSRG shall be associated with each of the S-NSSAIs
in the subscription information. At any time, if the AMF has received
subscription information for a UE that includes NSSRG information, the Allowed
NSSAI for the UE can only include S-NSSAIs which share a common NSSRG.
NOTE 1: The AMF enforces NSSRG only for the access(es) the UE registered to
the AMF. When the UE is registered to different PLMNs over 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access, the AMF in one access cannot enforce a common NSSRG over both
accesses.
The default S-NSSAIs, if more than one is present, are associated with the
same NSSRGs, i.e. the UE is always allowed to be registered with all the
default S-NSSAIs simultaneously. The HPLMN only sends S-NSSAIs sharing all the
NSSRGs of the Default S-NSSAIs to a non-supporting VPLMN as part of the
subscription information, i.e. in addition to the default S-NSSAI(s), the
HPLMN may send any other subscribed S-NSSAI which shares at least all the
NSSRG defined for the default S-NSSAI(s), and the HPLMN sends no NSSRG
information to the VPLMN. A subscription information that includes NSSRG
information shall include at least one default S-NSSAI.
A supporting AMF/NSSF, when it receives a Requested NSSAI, evaluates the
S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN (in the mapping information of the Requested NSSAI, when
a mapping information is applicable) based on any received NSSRG information
for these S-NSSAIs, to determines whether they can be provided together in the
Allowed NSSAI.
NOTE 2 : An HPLMN enabling support of subscription-based restrictions to
simultaneous registration of network slices for a Subscriber, can set the
subscribed S-NSSAI(s) already in the subscription information before the NSSRG
information was added to the subscription information, to have the same NSSRGs
defined for the default S-NSSAI(s) if it has to continue to support the same
service behaviour for these S-NSSAIs.
#### 5.15.12.2 UE and UE configuration aspects
A UE may support the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous
registration of network slices feature. In this case, the UE indicates its
support in the Registration Request message in the Initial Registration and
the Mobility Registration Update as part of the UE 5GMM Core Network
Capability.
When the serving AMF provides the Configured NSSAI to the UE, and the UE has
indicated it supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous
registration of network slices feature, the AMF also provides the UE with the
NSSRG information related to the S-NSSAIs of the HPLMN which are in the
mapping information of the Configured NSSAI. A UE which receives the NSSRG
values in the network slicing configuration information shall only include in
the Requested NSSAI S-NSSAIs that share a common NSSRG as per the received
information. If the UE has stored Pending NSSAI and the UE is still interested
in the Pending NSSAI then all the S-NSSAIs in the Requested NSSAI and the
Pending S-NSSAI shall share a common NSSRG. If the HPLMN changes NSSRG
information in the subscription information for a UE, the UDM updates the
supporting AMF serving the UE with the new NSSRG information and the AMF,
possibly after interaction with the NSSF (see clause 5.2.16.2.1 of TS 23.502
[3]), updates the UE as necessary with network slicing configuration by means
of the UE Configuration Update procedure (this may include changes in the
Configured NSSAI (and related mapping information) and changes in the Allowed
NSSAI as applicable). The UE acknowledges this UE Configuration Update
according to clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
At any time, a UE supporting subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous
registration of network slices feature and that has received NSSRG information
together with the Configured NSSAI shall only request S-NSSAIs, across all
Access Type(s) regardless of whether the same PLMN or different PLMNs are
used, that share one or more common NSSRG.
NOTE: In Requested NSSAI across all Access Type(s), the UE needs to include
S-NSSAIs that share at least one common NSSRG.
An AMF which supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous
registration of network slice feature configures a non-supporting UE with a
Configured NSSAI including only the S-NSSAIs sharing all the NSSRG values of
the default S-NSSAI(s), except if it has been instructed otherwise by the UDM.
In addition to the default S-NSSAI(s), the AMF sends to the UE in the
Configured NSSAI any other subscribed S-NSSAI whose NSSRG match at least those
defined for the default S-NSSAI(s).
The UDM in a supporting HPLMN may optionally keep a record of the PEIs or Type
Allocation Codes values regarding UE ability to handle network slices that
cannot be provided simultaneously in Allowed NSSAI.
The UDM may, based on configuration or the optional PEI records, indicate the
AMF to provide the non-supporting UEs with the full set of subscribed S-NSSAIs
even if they do not share a common NSSRG. The UDM instructs the supporting
AMFs of a PLMN to do so by indicating that the UE can be given a Configured
NSSAI with all the S-NSSAIs in the subscription information. If this
indication is received from the UDM by the AMF, this is included in the UE
context.
Based on its policy (including configuration or optionally checking the
specific PEI or Type Allocation Code used by the UE, and subject to roaming
agreement) the UDM may also provide the serving AMF in a non-supporting VPLMN
with all the S-NSSAI in the subscription information. In this case the AMF
provides the UE with a Configured NSSAI including all the S-NSSAIs in the
subscription information the AMF receives.
The AMF provides no NSSRG information to a non-supporting UE.
When an AMF which supports the subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous
registration of network slice feature, receives from a UE a Requested NSSAI
including S-NSSAIs that are supported in the Tracking Area but do not share a
common NSSRG, or the AMF has pending NSSAI stored for the UE, and the
S-NSSAI(s) of the requested NSSAI and the pending NSSAI do not share a common
NSSRG, the AMF assumes the UE configuration is not up-to-date, and provides
the following:
\- a supporting UE with an updated configuration including the up-to-date
NSSRG information for the S-NSSAIs in the Configured NSSAI as described above.
\- a non-supporting UE with an updated Configured NSSAI including only the
S-NSSAIs sharing all the NSSRG values of the default S-NSSAI(s), only for the
case where the UE context does not include an indication to provide all the
subscribed S-NSSAIs in the subscription information in the Configured NSSAI
for the UE.
### 5.15.13 Support of data rate limitation per Network Slice for a UE
A UE subscription information may include an optional Slice Maximum Bit Rate
for the UE (Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR) for an S-NSSAI, which applies for 3GPP
access type only. The Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR includes a UL and a DL value. If
a Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR is associated to an S-NSSAI in the subscription
information, it is provided by the AMF to the NG-RAN when the AMF provides the
Allowed NSSAI for the UE to the NG-RAN as UE-Slice-MBR QoS parameter. The UE-
Slice-MBR QoS parameter is defined in clause 5.7.2.6. If the Subscribed UE-
Slice-MBR for a UE changes, the AMF updates UE-Slice-MBR in the NG-RAN
accordingly.
In roaming case, the UE-Slice-MBR is provided for the S-NSSAI of the VPLMN,
which maps to the S-NSSAI of the HPLMN and the AMF may first interact with the
PCF for authorization of the Subscribed UE-Slice-MBR. If the AMF interacts
with the PCF, the PCF may provide the Authorized UE-Slice-MBR that is used as
UE-Slice-MBR by the AMF as described in clause 6.1.2.1 of TS 23.503 [45].
For a roaming UE, the S-NSSAI of the VPLMN maps to only one S-NSSAI of the
HPLMN for which an UE-Slice-MBR is applied.
The enforcement of the UE-Slice-MBR value, if present in the UE context in the
NG-RAN for an S-NSSAI, is described in clause 5.7.1.10.
NOTE: The PCF for the PDU Session may in addition be configured to monitor the
data rate per Network Slice for a UE and to strengthen or relax the traffic
restrictions for individual PDU Sessions or PCC rules accordingly, as
described in TS 23.503 [45] clause 6.2.1.9.
### 5.15.14 Network Slice AS Groups support
The NG-RAN may support Network Slice AS Groups (NSAGs) which are used as
specified in TS 38.300 [27], TS 38.331 [28], TS 38.321 [143] and TS 38.304
[50]. A Network Slice AS Group is an identifier of a group of network slices
which are associated with it. A Network Slice AS Group association with a
group of network slices may be valid in one or more Tracking Areas. An S-NSSAI
can be associated with at most one NSAG values for Random Access and at most
one NSAG value for Cell Reselection within a Tracking Area. An S-NSSAI can be
associated with different NSAG values in different Tracking Areas.
The NG-RAN provides (and updates) the AMF with the values of the NSAG(s) an
S-NSSAI is associated with in a TA using the NG Set Up and RAN Configuration
Update procedures (see TS 38.413 [34]). The AMF in turn provides this
information to the NSSF. In deployments where the total number of groups does
not exceed the number of groups associated with the NSAG size limit defined in
TS 38.331 [28]), all the NSAGs configured in the NG-RAN may be unique per PLMN
or SNPN. If the UE has indicated that the UE supports NSAG in the 5GMM Core
Network Capability (see clause 5.4.4a), the AMF may, with or without NSSF
assistance, configure the UE with NSAG Information for one or more S-NSSAIs in
the Configured NSSAI, by including this NSAG Information in the Registration
Accept message or the UE Configuration Command message. The UE uses the NSAG
Information as defined in clause 5.3.4.3.1. The AMF shall indicate in the NSAG
Information in which TA a specific NSAG association to S-NSSAI(s) is valid if
the AMF provides in the UE configuration a NSAG value which is used in
different TAs with a different association with NSSAIs. The configuration the
AMF provides includes at least the NSAGs for the UE for the TAs of the
Registration Area. If the AMF does not include the list of TAIs in association
with an NSAG in the NSAG Information, the NSAG is valid in the Registered PLMN
and equivalent PLMNs, or SNPN.
NOTE: If the NSAGs for the PLMN and equivalent PLMNs have different
associations to S-NSSAIs, then the AMF includes the list of TAIs in the NSAG
information.
The UE shall store and consider the received NSAG Information, valid for the
Registered PLMN and equivalent PLMNs, or SNPN until:
\- the UE receives new NSAG information in a Registration Accept message or UE
Configuration Command message in this PLMN or SNPN; or
\- the UE receives a Configured NSSAI without any NSAG information in this
PLMN or SNPN.
The UE shall store the currently valid NSAG information received in the
Registered PLMN or SNPN when registered in this PLMN or SNPN and:
\- The UE should be able to store the NSAG information for at least the
Registered-PLMN and equivalent PLMNs, or the SNPN.
\- The Registered-PLMN can provide NSAG information to the UE for the PLMN and
the equivalent PLMNs, and the SNPN can provide NSAG information to the UE for
the SNPN.
\- There can be at most 32 NSAGs configured in the UE at a time for a PLMN or
SNPN.
\- At most 4 NSAGs can have an optional TAI associated with it.
The NSAG information is not required to be stored after power off or after the
UE becomes Deregistered as it is not used for cell selection.
## 5.16 Support for specific services
### 5.16.1 Public Warning System
The functional description for supporting Public Warning System for 5G System
can be found in TS 23.041 [46].
### 5.16.2 SMS over NAS
#### 5.16.2.1 General
This clause includes feature description for supporting SMS over NAS in 5G
System. Support for SMS incurs the following functionality:
\- Support for SMS over NAS transport between UE and AMF. This applies to both
3GPP and Non 3GPP accesses.
\- Support for AMF determining the SMSF for a given UE.
\- Support for subscription checking and actual transmission of MO/MT-SMS
transfer by the SMSF.
\- Support for MO/MT-SMS transmission for both roaming and non-roaming
scenarios.
\- Support for selecting proper domains for MT SMS message delivery including
initial delivery and re-attempting in other domains.
#### 5.16.2.2 SMS over NAS transport
5G System supports SMS over NAS via both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
During Registration procedure, a UE that wants to use SMS provides an \"SMS
supported\" indication over NAS signalling indicating the UE\'s capability for
SMS over NAS transport. \"SMS supported\" indication indicates whether UE can
support SMS delivery over NAS. If the core network supports SMS functionality,
the AMF includes \"SMS allowed\" indication to the UE, and whether SMS
delivery over NAS is accepted by the network.
SMS is transported via NAS transport message, which can carry SMS messages as
payload.
### 5.16.3 IMS support
#### 5.16.3.1 General
IP-Connectivity Access Network specific concepts when using 5GS to access IMS
can be found in TS 23.228 [15].
5GS supports IMS with the following functionality:
\- Indication toward the UE if IMS voice over PS session is supported.
\- Capability to transport the P-CSCF address(es) to UE.
\- Paging Policy Differentiation for IMS as defined in TS 23.228 [15].
\- IMS emergency service as defined in TS 23.167 [18].
\- Domain selection for UE originating sessions.
\- Terminating domain selection for IMS voice.
\- Support of P-CSCF restoration procedure (clause 5.16.3.9).
\- NRF based P-CSCF discovery (clause 5.16.3.11).
NOTE: The NRF based P-CSCF discovery has no impact on the UE, i.e. the UE does
not need to know how P-CSCF IP address(es) is discovered in the network.
\- NRF based HSS discovery (clause 5.16.3.12).
#### 5.16.3.2 IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication over 3GPP access
The serving PLMN AMF shall send an indication toward the UE during the
Registration procedure over 3GPP access to indicate if an IMS voice over PS
session is supported or not supported in 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. A UE
with \"IMS voice over PS\" voice capability over 3GPP access should take this
indication into account when performing voice domain selection, as described
in clause 5.16.3.5.
The serving PLMN AMF may only indicate IMS voice over PS session supported
over 3GPP access in one of the following cases:
\- If the network and the UE are able to support IMS voice over PS session in
the current Registration Area with a 5G QoS Flow that supports voice as
specified in clause 5.7.
\- If the network or the UE are not able to support IMS voice over PS session
over NR connected to 5GC, but is able for one of the following:
\- If the network and the UE are able to support IMS voice over PS session
over E-UTRA connected to 5GC, and the NG-RAN supports a handover or
redirection to E-UTRA connected to 5GC for this UE at QoS Flow establishment
for IMS voice;
\- If the UE supports handover to EPS, the EPS supports IMS voice, and the NG-
RAN supports a handover to EPS for this UE at QoS Flow establishment for IMS
voice; or
\- If the UE supports redirection to EPS, the EPS supports IMS voice, and the
NG-RAN supports redirection to EPS for this UE at QoS Flow establishment for
IMS voice.
\- If the network is not able to provide a successful IMS voice over PS
session over E-UTRA connected to 5GC, but is able for one of the following:
\- If the UE supports handover to EPS, the EPS supports IMS voice, and the NG-
RAN supports a handover to EPS for this UE at QoS Flow establishment for IMS
voice; or
\- If the UE supports redirection to EPS, the EPS supports IMS voice, and the
NG-RAN supports redirection to EPS for this UE at QoS Flow establishment for
IMS voice.
The serving PLMN provides this indication based e.g. on local policy, UE
capabilities, HPLMN, whether IP address preservation is possible, whether NG-
RAN to UTRAN SRVCC is supported and how extended NG-RAN coverage is, and the
Voice Support Match Indicator from the NG-RAN (see clause 4.2.8a of TS 23.502
[3]).
NOTE 1: The terms \"UE supports handover to EPS\" or \"UE supports redirection
to EPS\" used above also consider the case that the UE has signalled that S1
mode is enabled. In case the UE has signalled that S1 mode is disabled for a
network that only supports IMS voice via EPS Fallback, the AMF will not
indicate that IMS voice over PS session is supported over 3GPP access. A voice
centric UE ensures its voice service as described in clauses 5.16.3.5 and
5.16.3.6.
The AMF in serving PLMN shall indicate that IMS voice over PS is supported
only if the serving PLMN has a roaming agreement that covers support of IMS
voice with the HPLMN. This indication is per Registration Area.
NOTE 2: If the network supports EPS fallback for voice the 5GC can be
configured not to perform the Voice Support Match Indicator procedure in order
to set the IMS voice over PS session Supported Indication.
The serving SNPN provides the IMS voice over PS indication based e.g. on local
policy, UE capabilities, whether IP address preservation is possible, and how
extended NR coverage is. This indication is per Registration Area.
NOTE 3: Since in SNPN access mode there is only support for NR and the \"voice
centric\" UE cannot reselect to another RAT in the same registered SNPN if the
first Registration Area that the UE tries to register from cannot support IMS
voice, it is recommended that support for IMS voice is provided homogeneously
in the whole SNPN if at all.
#### 5.16.3.2a IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication over non-3GPP
access
The serving PLMN AMF shall send an indication toward the UE during the
Registration procedure over non-3GPP access to indicate whether an IMS voice
over PS session is supported or not supported via non-3GPP access. A UE with
\"IMS voice over PS\" voice capability over non-3GPP access should take this
indication (received in the Registration procedure performed over either 3GPP
access or Non-3GPP access) into account when performing the selection between
N3IWF/TNGF and ePDG described in clause 6.3.6.
The serving PLMN AMF may only indicate IMS voice over PS session supported
over non-3GPP access if the network is able to provide a successful IMS voice
over PS session over N3IWF/TNGF connected to 5GC with a 5G QoS Flow that
supports voice as specified in clause 5.7.
#### 5.16.3.3 Homogeneous support for IMS voice over PS Session supported
indication
5GC shall support the usage of \"Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice over PS
Sessions\" indication between AMF and UDM.
When the AMF initiates Nudm_UECM_Registration operation to the UDM, it shall:
\- if \"IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" is supported homogeneously in all TAs in
the serving AMF for the UE, include the \"Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice
over PS Sessions\" indication set to \"Supported\";
\- if none of the TAs of the serving AMF supports \"IMS Voice over PS
Sessions\" for the UE, include the \"Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice over PS
Sessions\" indication set to \"Not supported\";
\- if \"IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" support is either non-homogeneous or
unknown, not include the \"Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice over PS Sessions\"
indication.
The AMF shall be able to provide the \"Homogeneous Support of IMS Voice over
PS Sessions\" indication as described above to the UDM using Nudm_UECM_Update
operation as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
The UDM shall take this indication into account when doing Terminating Access
Domain Selection (T-ADS) procedure for IMS voice.
NOTE: A TA supports \"IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" if the serving AMF
indicates IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication over 3GPP access to
the UE, as described in clause 5.16.3.2. In order to support routing of
incoming IMS voice calls to the correct domain, the network-based T-ADS (see
TS 23.292 [63] and TS 23.221 [23]) requires that the \"Homogeneous Support of
IMS Voice over PS Sessions\" indication is set to \"Supported\" for all
registered TAs of the UE or \"Not supported\" for all registered TAs of the
UE.
#### 5.16.3.4 P-CSCF address delivery
At PDU Session Establishment procedure related to IMS, SMF shall support the
capability to send the P-CSCF address(es) to UE. The SMF is located in VPLMN
if LBO is used. This is sent by visited SMF if LBO is used. For Home routed,
this information is sent by the SMF in HPLMN. P-CSCF address(es) shall be sent
transparently through AMF, and in the case of Home Routed also through the SMF
in VPLMN. The P-CSCF IP address(es) may be locally configured in the SMF, or
discovered using NRF as described in clause 5.16.3.11.
NOTE 1: Other options to provide P-CSCF to the UE as defined in TS 23.228 [15]
is not excluded.
NOTE 2: PDU Session for IMS is identified by \"APN\" or \"DNN\".
In the case of SNPN access the SMF is always located in the serving SNPN (no
support for Home Routed traffic); therefore, the serving SMF sends the P-CSCF
address(es) to the UE.
#### 5.16.3.5 Domain selection for UE originating sessions / calls
For UE originating calls, the 5GC capable UE performs access domain selection.
The UE shall be able to take following factors into account for access domain
selection decision:
\- The state of the UE in the IMS. The state information shall include:
Registered, Unregistered.
\- The \"IMS voice over PS session supported indication\" as defined in clause
5.16.3.2.
\- Whether the UE is expected to behave in a \"voice centric\" or \"data
centric\" way for 5GS.
\- UE capability of supporting IMS PS voice.
\- UE capability for operating in dual-registration mode with selective PDU
Session transfer as defined in clause 5.17.2.3.3.
\- Whether 3GPP PS Data Off is active or not and whether IMS voice is included
in 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services or not as defined in clause 5.24.
NOTE 1: In this release of the specification, the exact logic of which PDU
sessions are kept in which system for Dual Registration UE with selective
transfer of certain PDU Sessions as defined in clause 5.17.2.3.3, is left up
to UE implementation. The voice centric UE will keep the PDU Session used for
IMS services to a system that supports voice over IMS. The voice centric UE
can re-register with the IMS (if needed) when the IMS PDU session is
transferred between 5GS and EPS.
To allow for appropriate domain selection for originating voice calls, the UE
shall attempt Initial Registration in 5GC. If the UE fails to use IMS for
voice, e.g. due to \"IMS voice over PS session supported indication\"
indicates voice is not supported in 5G System, the UE behaves as described
below for \"voice centric\" for 5GS or \"data centric\" for 5GS:
\- A UE set to \"voice centric\" for 5GS shall always try to ensure that Voice
service is possible. A voice centric 5GC capable and EPC capable UE unable to
obtain voice service in 5GS shall not select a cell connected only to 5GC. By
disabling capabilities to access 5GS, the UE re-selects to E‑UTRAN connected
to EPC first (if available). When the UE selects E-UTRAN connected to EPC, the
UE performs Voice Domain Selection procedures as defined in TS 23.221 [23].
\- A UE set to \"data centric\" for 5GS does not need to perform any
reselection if voice services cannot be obtained.
NOTE 2: The related radio capabilities in order for the voice centric UE to
not reselect to NR or E-UTRA cell connected to 5GC (i.e. avoid ping pong) will
be defined by RAN WGs.
#### 5.16.3.6 Terminating domain selection for IMS voice
When requested by IMS, the UDM/HSS shall be able to query the serving AMF for
T-ADS related information. T-ADS is a functionality located in the IMS and is
performed as specified in TS 23.221 [23].
The AMF shall respond to the query with the following information unless the
UE is detached:
\- whether or not IMS voice over PS Session is supported in the registration
area (s) where the UE is currently registered;
\- whether or not IMS voice over PS Session Supported Indication over non-3GPP
access is supported in the WLAN where the UE is currently registered;
\- the time of the last radio contact with the UE; and
\- the current Access Type and RAT type.
#### 5.16.3.7 UE\'s usage setting
If the UE is configured to support IMS voice, the UE shall include the
information element \"UE\'s usage setting\" in Registration Request messages.
The UE\'s usage setting indicates whether the UE behaves in a \"voice
centric\" or \"data centric\" way (as defined in clause 5.16.3.5).
A UE supporting IMS voice over 3GPP access connected to 5GC and that is EPS
capable shall also support IMS voice over E-UTRA connected to EPC.
NOTE: Depending on operator\'s configuration, the UE\'s usage setting can be
used by the network to choose the RFSP Index in use (see clause 5.3.4.3). As
an example, this enables the enforcement of selective idle mode camping over
E-UTRA for voice centric UEs.
#### 5.16.3.8 Domain and Access Selection for UE originating SMS
##### 5.16.3.8.1 UE originating SMS for IMS Capable UEs supporting SMS over IP
To allow for appropriate domain selection for SMS delivery, it should be
possible to provision UEs with the following HPLMN operator preferences on how
an IMS enabled UE is supposed to handle SMS services:
\- SMS is not to be invoked over IP networks: the UE does not attempt to
deliver SMS over IP networks. The UE attempts to deliver SMS over NAS
signalling.
\- SMS is preferred to be invoked over IP networks: the UE attempts to deliver
SMS over IP networks. If delivery of SMS over IP networks is not available,
the UE attempts to deliver SMS over NAS signalling.
##### 5.16.3.8.2 Access Selection for SMS over NAS
It should be possible to provision UEs with the HPLMN SMS over NAS operator
preferences on access selection for delivering SMS over NAS signalling.
Based on the SMS over NAS preference:
\- SMS is preferred to be invoked over 3GPP access for NAS transport: the UE
attempts to deliver MO SMS over NAS via 3GPP access if the UE is both
registered in 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
\- SMS is preferred to be invoked over non-3GPP access for NAS transport: the
UE attempts to deliver MO SMS over NAS via non-3GPP access if the UE is both
registered in 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. If delivery of SMS over NAS via
non-3GPP access is not available, the UE attempts to deliver SMS over NAS via
3GPP access.
#### 5.16.3.9 SMF support for P-CSCF restoration procedure
For the support of P-CSCF restoration the SMF behaves as described in TS
23.380 [61].
#### 5.16.3.10 IMS Voice Service via EPS Fallback or RAT fallback in 5GS
In order to support various deployment scenarios for obtaining IMS voice
service, the UE and NG-RAN may support the mechanism to direct or redirect the
UE from NG-RAN either towards E-UTRA connected to 5GC (RAT fallback) or
towards EPS (E-UTRAN connected to EPC System fallback).
Following principles apply for IMS Voice Service:
\- The serving AMF indicates toward the UE during the Registration procedure
that IMS voice over PS session is supported.
\- If a request for establishing the QoS Flow for IMS voice reaches the NG-
RAN, the NG-RAN responds indicating rejection of the establishment request and
the NG-RAN may trigger one of the following procedures depending on UE
capabilities, N26 availability, network configuration and radio conditions:
\- Redirection to EPS;
\- Handover procedure to EPS;
\- Redirection to E-UTRA connected to 5GC; or
\- Handover to E-UTRA connected to 5GC.
\- If needed, Network Provided Location Information is provided as described
in clauses 4.13.6.1 and 4.13.6.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
\- The ongoing IMS voice session is not impacted by a change of the IMS voice
over PS session indicator from supported to unsupported (e.g. the UE receives
during RAT Fallback or EPS Fallback the IMS voice over PS session indicator
indicating that IMS voice over PS sessions are not supported).
NOTE: Any change in IMS voice over PS session indicator applies to new IMS
sessions initiated only after the ongoing IMS voice session is terminated.
During any release of RRC connection including after EPS/RAT fallback is
performed, the eNB or NG-RAN node may provide to the UE dedicated idle mode
priorities for NR as defined in TS 36.331 [51] taking into account RFSP, PLMNs
contained in Handover Restriction List and local operator policy. If the UE
remains ECM/CM connected after the voice call has ended, the eNB or NG-RAN
node may trigger handover to NR connected to 5GC, if configured to do so,
taking into account local operator policy and Handover Restriction List.
#### 5.16.3.11 P-CSCF discovery and selection
P-CSCF selection functionality may be used by the SMF to select the P-CSCF for
an IMS PDU Session of the UE.
The SMF can utilize the Network Repository Function to discover the P-CSCF
instance(s). The NRF provides the IP address or the FQDN of P-CSCF instance(s)
to the SMF. The P-CSCF selection function in the SMF selects the P-CSCF
instance(s) based on the available P-CSCF instances obtained from NRF or based
on the configured P-CSCF information in the SMF. If the SMF receives FQDN(s)
from the NRF or is configured with FQDN(s) the SMF shall resolve these to IP
addresses for sending to the UE in the PDU session response.
The following factors may be considered during the P-CSCF discovery and
selection:
\- S-NSSAI of the PDU Session.
\- UE location information.
\- Local operator policies.
\- Availability of candidate P-CSCFs.
\- UE IP address.
\- Access Type.
\- Proximity to location of selected UPF.
\- Selected Data Network Name (DNN).
#### 5.16.3.12 HSS discovery and selection
HSS discovery and selection functionality is used by the I-CSCF/S-CSCF/IMS-AS
to select an HSS that manages the user\'s IMS subscriptions and has the
ability to serve the IMS services for the UE, see clause AA.3.3 of TS 23.228
[15] and clause 6.3.1 for details.
### 5.16.4 Emergency Services
#### 5.16.4.1 Introduction
Emergency Services are provided to support IMS emergency sessions. \"Emergency
Services\" refers to functionalities provided by the serving network when the
network is configured to support Emergency Services. Emergency Services are
provided to normally registered UEs and to Emergency Registered UEs, that can
be either normally registered or in limited service state. Depending on local
regulation, receiving Emergency Services in limited service state does not
require a valid subscription. Depending on local regulation and on operator\'s
policy, the network may allow or reject a registration request for Emergency
Services (i.e. Emergency Registration) from UEs that have been identified to
be in limited service state. Four different behaviours of Emergency Services
as defined in clause 4.3.12.1 of TS 23.401 [26] are supported.
Emergency Services shall not be provided to a UE over 3GPP access and non-3GPP
access concurrently, except for the following case:
\- a UE may be Emergency Registered and have an emergency PDU session over
non-3GPP access or may be attached for emergency session to ePDG over
untrusted WLAN (as defined in TS 23.402 [43]) when 3GPP access becomes
available. In which case the UE may have to register over 3GPP access and
check first the support for Emergency Services over the 3GPP RAT it has
selected (e.g. based on Emergency Services Support indication, Emergency
Services Fallback, AS broadcast indicator). If there is native support for
Emergency Services in the selected 3GPP RAT the UE will attempt to transfer
the emergency PDU session from non-3GPP access to 3GPP access (see clause
4.9.2 or clause 4.9.3 of TS 23.502 [3]). If there is no native support for
Emergency Services in the selected RAT, but Emergency Services Fallback to
another RAT in 5GS or to another System where Emergency Services may be
supported (based on the conditions defined in clause 5.16.4.11), the UE may
trigger first Emergency Services Fallback (see clause 4.13.4.2 of TS 23.502
[3]) and then attempt to transfer the emergency PDU session from non-3GPP
access to 3GPP access (see clause 4.9.2 of TS 23.502 [3]). In these cases the
UE may thus briefly be emergency registered and receive emergency services
over both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access concurrently.
A UE may only attempt to use Emergency Services over non-3GPP access if it is
unable to use Emergency Services over 3GPP access as specified in TS 23.167
[18].
The UE is only allowed to have one PDU session for Emergency services at a
time. A PDU Session cannot be changed between a PDU Session for Non-Emergency
services and a PDU Session for Emergency services. PDU session for emergency
services can be transferred from one Access Type to another as specified in
clause 5.16.4.9.
To provide Emergency Services, the AMF is configured with Emergency
Configuration Data that are applied to Emergency Services that are established
by an AMF based on request from the UE. The AMF Emergency Configuration Data
contains the S-NSSAI and Emergency DNN which is used to derive an SMF. In
addition, the AMF Emergency Configuration Data contains UE-AMBR and may also
contain the statically configured SMF for the Emergency DNN. The SMF may also
store Emergency Configuration Data that contains statically configured UPF
information for the Emergency DNN.
NOTE 1: The Network slices associated with emergency services are assumed to
be configured consistently in the AMF (i.e. emergency configuration data) and
NG-RAN nodes within the corresponding Registration Area where emergency
services are to be supported.
When the UE is camped normally in the cell, i.e. not in limited service state,
during Registration procedure described in clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3],
the serving AMF includes an indication for Emergency Services Support within
the Registration Accept to the UE. For 3GPP access, the Emergency Services
Support indication is valid within the current Registration Area per RAT (i.e.
this is to cover cases when the same registration area supports multiple RATs
and they have different capability).
The Emergency Services Support is configured in the AMF according to local
regulations and network capabilities. AMF includes Emergency Services Support
indicator in the Registration Accept message to indicate that the UE can setup
emergency PDU Session to obtain emergency services. The AMF may include
additional local emergency numbers associated with the serving network for the
UE, further defined in TS 24.501 [47].
During Registration procedures over 3GPP access in a PLMN, the 5GC includes
the Emergency Services Support indicator, valid for the current Registration
Area and indicating per RAT that Emergency Services are supported if any of
the following conditions is true within the current Registration Area:
\- the Network is able to support Emergency Services natively over 5GS;
\- E-UTRA connected to 5GC supports IMS Emergency Services (e.g. voice), and
the NG-RAN is able to trigger handover or redirection from NR to E-UTRA
connected to 5GC at QoS Flow establishment for IMS Emergency Services (e.g.
voice);
\- NG-RAN is able to trigger handover to EPS at QoS Flow establishment for IMS
Emergency Services (e.g. voice);
\- NG-RAN is able to trigger redirection to EPS at QoS Flow establishment for
IMS Emergency Services (e.g. voice); or
\- NG-RAN is able to trigger 5G SRVCC handover to UTRAN for IMS Emergency
Services (i.e. voice).
During Registration procedures over non-3GPP access, the 5GC indicates that
Emergency Services are supported if the Network is able to support Emergency
Services natively over 5GS.
In the case of SNPN, during Registration procedures over 3GPP access, the 5GC
includes the Emergency Services Support indicator, valid for the current
Registration Area indicating that Emergency Services are supported if the
following condition is true within the current Registration Area:
\- the Network is able to support Emergency Services natively over 5GS.
The 5GC includes an indication per RAT whether it supports Emergency Services
Fallback (as defined in clause 5.16.4.11) to another RAT in 5GS or to another
System where Emergency Services are supported natively. The Emergency Services
Fallback support indicator is valid within the current Registration Area per
RAT.
If a certain RAT is restricted for Emergency Services, AMF signals that the
corresponding RAT is restricted for Emergency Services Support to the Master
RAN Node. This helps assist the Master RAN node determine whether to set up
Dual Connectivity for Emergency Services.
UEs that are in limited service state, as specified in TS 23.122 [17], or that
camp normally on a cell but failed to register successfully to the network
under conditions specified in TS 24.501 [47], initiate the Registration
procedure by indicating that the registration is to receive Emergency
Services, referred to as Emergency Registration, and a Follow-on request is
included in the Registration Request to initiate PDU Session Establishment
procedure with a Request Type indicating \"Emergency Request\". UEs that had
registered for normal services and do not have emergency PDU Session
established and that are subject to Mobility Restriction in the present area
or RAT (e.g. because of restricted tracking area) shall initiate the UE
Requested PDU Session Establishment procedure to receive Emergency Services,
i.e. with a Request Type indicating \"Emergency Request\". Based on local
regulation, the network supporting Emergency Services for UEs in limited
service state provides Emergency Services to these UE, regardless whether the
UE can be authenticated, has roaming or Mobility Restrictions or a valid
subscription.
For Emergency Services over 3GPP access via PLMN, other than eCall over IMS,
the UEs in limited service state that do not operate in SNPN access mode
determine that the cell supports Emergency Services over NG-RAN from a
broadcast indicator in AS. The cell connected to EPC and 5GC broadcasts
separate broadcast indicator for EPC and 5GC to indicate support of emergency
services by the EPC and 5GC. If the UE supports SNPN access mode, is in
limited service state, is not operating in SNPN access mode, needs to make an
emergency call and cannot find an acceptable cell in any PLMN, the UE may
activate SNPN access mode and attempt to camp on an acceptable cell of any
available SNPN supporting emergency calls (irrespective of SNPN ID or GIN) as
defined in TS 23.122 [17]. For Emergency Services over untrusted non-3GPP
access, other than eCall over IMS, the UE in limited service state selects any
N3IWF as specified in clause 6.3.6. Emergency calls for eCall Over IMS may
only be performed if the UE has a USIM.
For Emergency Services over NR via SNPN, other than eCall over IMS, the UEs in
limited service state that operate in SNPN access mode determine that the cell
supports Emergency Services over NR from a broadcast indicator in AS and
indication that the SNPN supports Emergency Services. If the UE operates in
SNPN access mode and is in limited service state, the UE shall attempt to camp
on an acceptable cell of any available SNPN supporting emergency calls
(irrespective of SNPN ID or GIN). If the UE cannot find acceptable cell on any
available SNPN, the UE shall deactivate SNPN access mode and camp on any
available PLMN cell supporting emergency calls (irrespective of PLMN ID) as
defined in TS 23.122 [17].
For NR satellite access, if a UE in limited service state is aware of its
location, the UE selects a PLMN that is allowed to operate in the UE location
as specified in TS 23.122 [17]. The network may be configured to verify the
location of a UE that is registering for emergency services as specified in
clause 5.4.11.4.
There is no support for eCall over IMS for SNPNs in this Release.
A serving network shall provide an Access Stratum broadcast indication from
NG-RAN (NR or E-UTRA connected to 5GC) to UEs indicating whether eCall Over
IMS is supported:
\- When an E-UTRA cell is connected to EPC and 5GC, the cell broadcasts
separate Access stratum broadcast indication for 5GC and EPC to indicate
support of eCall over IMS by 5GC and EPC.
\- A UE that is not in limited service state determines that the NG-RAN cell
supports eCall Over IMS via 5GC using the broadcast indicator for eCall over
IMS. Emergency calls for eCall over IMS are not supported over non-3GPP
access.
NOTE 2: The Access Stratum broadcast indicator is determined according to
operator policies and minimally indicates that the PLMN, or all of the PLMNs
in the case of network sharing, and at least one emergency centre or PSAP to
which an eCall Over IMS can be routed, support eCall Over IMS.
\- A UE in limited service state determines that the cell supports eCall Over
IMS using both the broadcast indicator for support of Emergency Services over
NG-RAN and the broadcast indicator of NG-RAN for eCall over IMS. Emergency
calls for eCall Over IMS are not supported over Non-3GPP access and NR via
SNPN.
NOTE 3: The broadcast indicator for eCall Over IMS does not indicate whether
UEs in limited service state are supported. So, the broadcast indicator for
support of Emergency Services over NG-RAN that indicates limited service state
support needs to be applied in addition.
For a UE that is Emergency Registered, if it is unauthenticated the security
context is not set up on UE.
In order to receive Emergency Services, UEs that camp on a suitable cell in
RM-DEREGISTERED state (i.e. without any conditions that result in limited
service state), or that decide to access 5GC via non-3GPP access (and not in
limited service state over non-3GPP access), initiate the Initial Registration
procedure for normal service instead of Emergency Registration. Upon
successful registration, such UEs shall initiate the UE Requested PDU Session
Establishment procedure with a Request Type indicating \"Emergency Request\"
to receive Emergency Services if the AMF indicated support for Emergency
Services in 5GC (for the RAT the UE is currently camped on when UE is camping
on 3GPP access). The UEs that camp normally on a cell or that are connected
via Non-3GPP access are informed that the PLMN supports Emergency Services
over 5G-AN from the Emergency Services Support indicator in the Registration
procedure. This applies to both 3GPP and non-3GPP Access Types. There is no
support for Emergency Services for SNPN that is accessed via NWu from a PLMN.
NOTE 4: The Emergency Services Support indicator in the Registration
procedures does not indicate support for eCall Over IMS.
For a UE that is Emergency Registered, normal PLMN or SNPN selection
principles apply after the end of the IMS emergency session.
NOTE 5: For Emergency Services, there is no support for inter PLMN mobility
thus there is a risk of service disruption due to failed inter PLMN mobility
attempts when there is no session continuity (e.g. change of anchor SMF/UPF
due to mobility) for the PDU Session and/or based on operator policies.
NOTE 6 Based on operator policies, Inter PLMN mobility with session continuity
can be supported for Emergency Services if the anchor SMF/UPF for PDU Session
supporting Emergency Services does not change.
The UE shall set the RRC establishment cause to emergency as defined in TS
38.331 [28] when it requests an RRC Connection in relation to an emergency
session.
In the case of Limited Service state, UE shall not include any Network Slice
related parameters when communicating with the network.
When a PLMN or SNPN supports IMS and Emergency Services:
\- all AMFs in that PLMN or SNPN shall have the capability to support
Emergency Services.
\- at least one SMF shall have this capability.
For other emergency scenarios (e.g. UE autonomous selection for initiating
Emergency Services), refer to TS 23.167 [18] for domain selection principles.
For emergency service support in Public network integrated NPNs, refer to
clause 5.30.3.5.
#### 5.16.4.2 Architecture Reference Model for Emergency Services
According to clause 4.2, the non-roaming architectures (Figure 4.2.3-1 and
Figure 4.2.3-2) and roaming architecture with the visited operator\'s
application function (Figure 4.2.4-1 and Figure 4.2.4-4) apply for Emergency
Services. The other non-roaming and roaming architectures with services
provided by the home network do not apply for Emergency Services.
#### 5.16.4.3 Mobility Restrictions and Access Restrictions for Emergency
Services
When Emergency Services are supported and local regulation requires IMS
Emergency Sessions to be provided regardless of Mobility Restrictions or
Access Restrictions, the Mobility Restrictions or Access Restrictions (see
clause 5.3.4.1) should not be applied to UEs receiving Emergency Services.
Additionally, due to Mobility Restrictions or Access Restrictions (e.g. CAG
restrictions) for normally registered UEs, that have established both non-
emergency PDU Sessions and emergency PDU Session, the AMF indicates to the SMF
to perform a local release of all non-emergency PDU Sessions via PDU Session
Release procedure as specified in clause 4.3.4 of TS 23.502 [3]. The UE
locally releases non-emergency PDU Sessions. The AMF and the UE behave as if
the UE is emergency registered as described in TS 24.501 [47].
When the (R)AN resources for Emergency Services are established, the ARP value
for Emergency Services indicates the usage for Emergency Services to the
5G-AN.
During handover, the source NG-RAN and source AMF ignore any UE related
restrictions during handover evaluation when there is an active PDU Session
associated with emergency service.
During Mobility Registration Update procedures, including a Mobility
Registration Update as part of a handover, the target AMF ignores any Mobility
Restrictions or access restrictions for UE with emergency services where
required by local regulation. Any non-emergency services are not allowed, by
the target network when not allowed by the subscription for the target
location. To allow the UE in limited service state (either Emergency
Registered or registered for normal service) over a given Access Type to get
access to normal services over this Access Type after the Emergency Session
has ended and when it has moved to a new area that is not stored by the UE as
a forbidden area, after allowing a period of time for subsequent Emergency
Services, the UE may explicitly deregister and register for normal services
over this Access Type without waiting for the emergency PDU Session Release by
the SMF.
This functionality applies to all mobility procedures.
#### 5.16.4.4 Reachability Management
Over 3GPP access, an Emergency Registered UE when its Periodic Registration
Update timer expires shall not initiate a Periodic Registration Update
procedure but shall enter the RM-DEREGISTERED state. For such UEs, the AMF
runs a mobile reachable timer with a similar value to the UE\'s Periodic
Registration Update timer. After expiry of this timer the AMF may change the
UE RM state for 3GPP Access in the AMF to RM-DEREGISTERED. The AMF assigns the
Periodic Registration Update timer value to Emergency Registered UEs. This
timer keeps the Emergency Registered UE registered for Emergency Services
after change to CM-IDLE state to allow for a subsequent Emergency Service
without a need for a new Emergency Registration.
Over non-3GPP access, an Emergency Registered UE is only reachable in CM-
CONNECTED state: since the UE may only use Emergency Services over Non-3GPP
access when it is not possible over 3GPP access, 3GPP access is assumed to be
unavailable for paging the UE.
#### 5.16.4.5 SMF and UPF selection function for Emergency Services
When a SMF is selected for Emergency Services, the SMF selection function
described in clause 6.3.2 for normal services is applied to the Emergency DNN
or the AMF selects the SMF directly from the AMF Emergency Configuration Data.
If the SMF selection function described in clause 6.3.2 is used it shall
always derive a SMF in the Serving PLMN or SNPN, which guarantees that the IP
address is also allocated by the Serving PLMN or SNPN. When a UPF is selected
for Emergency Services, the UPF selection function described in clause 6.3.3
for normal services is applied to the Emergency DNN or the SMF selects the UPF
directly from the SMF Emergency Configuration Data. The information in the AMF
Emergency Configuration Data and the SMF Emergency Configuration Data is
specified in clause 5.16.4.1.
#### 5.16.4.6 QoS for Emergency Services
Local regulation may require supporting emergency calls from an unauthorised
UE. In such a case, the SMF may not have subscription data. Additionally, the
local network may want to provide Emergency Services support differently than
what is allowed by a UE subscription. Therefore, the initial QoS parameters
used for establishing Emergency Services are configured in the V-SMF (local
network) in the SMF Emergency Configuration Data.
This functionality is used by the UE Requested PDU Session Establishment
procedure when establishing Emergency Services.
#### 5.16.4.7 PCC for Emergency Services
Dynamic PCC is used for UEs establishing emergency service and shall be used
to manage IMS emergency sessions when an operator allows IMS emergency
sessions. When establishing Emergency Services with a SMF, the PCF provides
the SMF with the QoS parameters, including an ARP value reserved for the
Emergency Services to prioritize the QoS Flows when performing admission
control, as defined in TS 23.503 [45].
The PCF rejects an IMS session established via the emergency PDU Session if
the AF (i.e. P-CSCF) does not provide an emergency indication to the PCF.
#### 5.16.4.8 IP Address Allocation
Emergency service is provided by the serving PLMN or SNPN. The UE and serving
PLMN or SNPN must have compatible IP address versions in order for the UE to
obtain a local emergency PDU Session.
#### 5.16.4.9 Handling of PDU Sessions for Emergency Services
The QoS Flows of a PDU Session associated with the emergency DNN shall be
dedicated for IMS emergency sessions and shall not allow any other type of
traffic. The emergency contexts shall not be changed to non-emergency contexts
and vice versa. The UPF shall block any traffic that is not from or to
addresses of network functions (e.g. P-CSCF) providing Emergency Services.
If there is already an emergency PDU Session over a given Access Type (3GPP
access or non-3GPP access), the UE shall not request another emergency PDU
Session over any Access Type except for handing over the existing emergency
PDU Session to the other Access Type.
If the SMF receives a new emergency PDU session establishment request and an
emergency PDU Session exists for the same UE over any Access Type, the SMF
shall remove the existing SM context locally and clear the associated
resources in the network and proceed with the new request.
NOTE: If the UE releases emergency PDU session locally and requests for
establishment of a new one before the SMF has released the emergency PDU
session due to PDU session inactivity as specified in clause 4.3.4.2 of TS
23.502 [3], the above duplicate emergency PDU session handling in the network
removes the old emergency PDU session as part of establishing a new one. This
releases all emergency call back resources related with the old emergency PDU
Session.
The ARP reserved for emergency service shall only be assigned to QoS Flows
associated with an emergency PDU Session. If the UE is Emergency Registered
over a given access, it shall not request a PDU Session to any other DNN over
this access.
#### 5.16.4.9a Handling of PDU Sessions for normal services for Emergency
Registered UEs
For an Emergency Registered UE over a given Access Type:
\- the UE shall not initiate the UE Requested PDU Session Establishment
procedure for normal service over this Access Type; and
\- the network shall reject any PDU Session Establishment request for normal
service from the UE on this Access Type;
\- the UE may attempt to receive normal service over another Access Type if
not otherwise prevented by the present document.
#### 5.16.4.10 Support of eCall Only Mode
For service requirements for eCall only mode, refer to TS 22.101 [33].
A UE configured for eCall Only Mode shall remain in RM-DEREGISTERED state,
shall camp on a network cell when available but shall refrain from any
Registration Management, Connection Management or other signalling with the
network. The UE may instigate Registration Management and Connection
Management procedures in order to establish, maintain and release an eCall
Over IMS session or a session to any non-emergency MSISDN(s) or URI(s)
configured in the USIM for test and/or terminal reconfiguration services.
Following the release of either session, the UE starts a timer whose value
depends on the type of session (i.e. whether eCall or a session to a non-
emergency MSISDN or URI for test/reconfiguration). While the timer is running,
the UE shall perform normal RM/CM procedures and is permitted to respond to
paging to accept and establish an incoming session (e.g. from an emergency
centre, PSAP or HPLMN operator). When the timer expires, the UE shall perform
a UE-initiated Deregistration procedure if still registered and enter RM-
DEREGISTERED state.
NOTE 1: An HPLMN operator can change the eCall Only Mode configuration state
of a UE in the USIM. An HPLMN operator can also instead add, modify or remove
a non-emergency MSISDN or URI in the USIM for test and/or terminal
reconfiguration services. This can occur following a UE call to a non-
emergency MSISDN or URI configured for reconfiguration. When the eCall Only
Mode configuration is removed, the UE operates as a normal UE that can support
eCall over IMS.
NOTE 2: A test call and a reconfiguration call can be seen as normal (non-
emergency) call by a serving PLMN and normal charging rules can apply
depending on operator policy.
NOTE 3: An MSISDN configured in the USIM for test and/or terminal
reconfiguration services for eCall Over IMS can differ from an MSISDN
configured in the USIM for test services for eCall over the CS domain.
#### 5.16.4.11 Emergency Services Fallback
In order to support various deployment scenarios for obtaining Emergency
Services, the UE and 5GC may support the mechanism to direct or redirect the
UE either towards E-UTRA connected to 5GC (RAT fallback) when only NR does not
support Emergency Services or towards EPS (E-UTRAN connected to EPC System
fallback) when the 5GC does not support Emergency Services. Emergency Services
fallback may be used when the 5GS does not indicate support for Emergency
Services (see clause 5.16.4.1) and indicates support for Emergency Services
fallback.
Following principles apply for Emergency Services Fallback:
\- If the AMF indicates support for Emergency Services fallback in the
Registration Accept message, then in order to initiate Emergency Service,
normally registered UE supporting Emergency Services fallback shall initiate a
Service Request with Service Type set to Emergency Services fallback as
defined in clause 4.13.4.1 of TS 23.502 [3].
\- AMF uses the Service Type Indication within the Service Request to redirect
the UE towards the appropriate RAT/System. The 5GS may, for Emergency
Services, trigger one of the following procedures:
\- Handover or redirection to EPS.
\- Handover or redirection to E-UTRA connected to 5GC.
\- After receiving the Service Request for Emergency Fallback, the AMF
triggers N2 procedure resulting in either CONNECTED state mobility (Handover
procedure) or IDLE state mobility (redirection) to either E-UTRA/5GC or to
E-UTRAN/EPC depending on factors such as N26 availability, network
configuration and radio conditions. In the N2 procedure, the AMF based on
support for Emergency Services in 5GC or EPC may indicate the target CN for
the RAN node to know whether inter-RAT fallback or inter-system fallback is to
be performed. The target CN indicated in the N2 procedure is also conveyed to
the UE in order to be able to perform the appropriate NAS procedures (S1 or N1
Mode).
\- When the AS re-keying procedure and the Emergency Fallback procedure
collides, the AMF gives up the AS re-keying procedure and only initiates the
Emergency Fallback procedure.
NOTE 1: Emergency Services Fallback to EPS can be followed by an onward
movement to GERAN or UTRAN via CSFB procedures if the PLMN does not support
IMS emergency services.
NOTE 2: If the UE has signalled that S1 mode is disabled for a network that
only supports IMS voice via EPS Fallback, the AMF will not indicate that
Emergency Services Fallback is supported over 3GPP access.
Emergency Services fallback is supported only in case of PLMN. Emergency
Services Fallback is not supported for SNPN.
### 5.16.5 Multimedia Priority Services
TS 22.153 [24] specifies the service requirements for Multimedia Priority
Service (MPS). MPS allows Service Users (as per TS 22.153 [24]) priority
access to system resources in situations such as during congestion, creating
the ability to deliver or complete sessions of a high priority nature. Service
Users are government-authorized personnel, emergency management officials
and/or other authorized users. MPS supports priority sessions on an \"end-to-
end\" priority basis.
MPS is based on the ability to invoke, modify, maintain and release sessions
with priority, and deliver the priority media packets under network congestion
conditions. MPS is supported in a roaming environment when roaming agreements
are in place and where regulatory requirements apply.
NOTE 1: If a session terminates on a server in the Internet (e.g. web-based
service), then the remote end and the Internet transport are out of scope for
this specification.
A Service User may use an MPS-subscribed UE or any other UE to obtain MPS. An
MPS-subscribed UE obtains priority access to the Radio Access Network by using
the Unified Access Control mechanism according to TS 22.261 [2]. This
mechanism provides preferential access to UEs based on its assigned Access
Identity. If an MPS-subscribed UE belongs to the special Access Identity as
defined in TS 22.261 [2], the UE has preferential access to the network
compared to ordinary UEs in periods of congestion.
MPS subscription allows users to receive priority services, if the network
supports MPS. MPS subscription entitles a USIM with special Access Identity.
MPS subscription includes indication for support of priority PDU connectivity
service including MPS for Data Transport Service and IMS priority service
support for the end user. Priority Level regarding QoS Flows and IMS are also
part of the MPS subscription information. The usage of Priority Level is
defined in TS 22.153 [24], TS 23.503 [45] and TS 23.228 [15].
NOTE 2: The term \"Priority PDU connectivity services\" is used to refer to 5G
System functionality that corresponds to the functionality as provided by
LTE/EPC Priority EPS bearer services in clause 4.3.18.3 of TS 23.401 [26].
MPS includes signalling priority and media priority. All MPS-subscribed UEs
get priority for QoS Flows (e.g. used for IMS signalling) when established to
the DN that is configured to have priority for a given Service User by setting
MPS-appropriate values in the QoS profile in the UDM.
Service Users are treated as On Demand MPS subscribers or not, based on
regional/national regulatory requirements. On Demand service is based on
Service User invocation/revocation explicitly and applied to the media QoS
Flows being established. When not On Demand MPS service does not require
invocation, and provides priority treatment for all QoS Flows only to the DN
that is configured to have priority for a given Service User after attachment
to the 5G network.
MPS for Data Transport Service is an on-demand service that may be
invoked/revoked by an authorized Service User using a UE with a subscription
for MPS (i.e. according to its MPS profile), or using a UE that does not have
a subscription for MPS (using methods not in scope of this specification).
MPS for Data Transport Service requires explicit invocation. The Service User
invokes the service by communicating with an AF. The authorization of an MPS
for Data Transport Service request is done by the AF or the PCF according to
clause 6.1.3.11 of TS 23.503 [45]. Upon successful authorization, the PCF
performs the necessary actions to achieve appropriate ARP and 5QI settings for
the QoS Flows (see clause 6.1.3.11 of TS 23.503 [45]).
MPS for Data Transport Service enables the prioritization of all traffic on
the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule and other QoS Flows upon AF
request. The QoS modification to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS
rule and other QoS Flows is done based on operator policy and regulatory rules
by means of local PCF configuration.
NOTE 3: According to regional/national regulatory requirements and operator
policy, On-Demand MPS (including MPS for Data Transport Service) Service Users
can be assigned the highest priority.
NOTE 4: If no configuration is provided, MPS for Data Transport Service
applies only to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.
NOTE 5: MPS for DTS controls the priority of traffic on QoS Flows independent
of the application(s) being used. Other mechanisms (e.g. Priority PDU
connectivity service) can be used to control the priority of traffic on other
QoS Flows under the control of specific data application(s), based on operator
policy.
NOTE 6: MPS for Data Transport Service can be applied to any DNN other than
the well-known DNN for IMS.
For MPS for Data Transport Service, the AF may also create an SDF for priority
signalling between the UE and the AF (see clause 6.1.3.11 of TS 23.503 [45]).
Priority treatment is applicable to IMS based multimedia services and Priority
PDU connectivity service including MPS for Data Transport Service.
Priority treatment for MPS includes priority message handling, including
priority treatment during authentication, security, and Mobility Management
procedures.
Priority treatment for MPS session requires appropriate ARP and 5QI (plus 5G
QoS characteristics) setting for QoS Flows according to the operator\'s
policy.
NOTE 7: Use of QoS Flows for MPS with QoS characteristics signalled as part of
QoS profile enables the flexible assignment of 5G QoS characteristics (e.g.
Priority Level) for MPS.
When an MPS session is requested by a Service User, the following principles
apply in the network:
\- QoS Flows employed in an MPS session shall be assigned ARP value settings
appropriate for the priority of the Service User.
\- Setting ARP pre-emption capability and vulnerability for MPS QoS Flows,
subject to operator policies and depending on national/regional regulatory
requirements.
\- Pre-emption of non-Service Users over Service Users during network
congestion situation, subject to operator policy and national/regional
regulations.
The terminating network identifies the priority of the MPS session and applies
priority treatment, including paging with priority, to ensure that the MPS
session can be established with priority to the terminating user (either a
Service User or normal user).
MPS priority mechanisms can be classified as subscription-related, invocation-
related, and those applied to existing QoS Flows. Subscription related
mechanisms, as described in clause 5.22.2, are further divided into two
groups: those which are always applied and those which are conditionally
applied. Invocation-related mechanisms, as described in clause 5.22.3, are
further divided into three groups: those that apply for mobile originated SIP
call/sessions, those that apply for mobile terminated SIP call/sessions, and
those that apply for the Priority PDU connectivity services including MPS for
Data Transport Service. Methods applied to existing QoS Flows focus on
handover and congestion control and are described in clause 5.22.4.
NOTE 8: The network can hide its topology from the AF supporting MPS for Data
Transport Service. At the same time, the UE needs to provide its locally known
IP address to the AF supporting MPS for Data Transport Service to support
interactions with the applicable PCF. Thus, there can be no NAT of the UE IP
address between the UPF and the AF supporting MPS for Data Transport Service.
### 5.16.6 Mission Critical Services
According to TS 22.280 [37], a Mission Critical Service (MCX Service) is a
communication service reflecting enabling capabilities Mission Critical
Applications and provided to end users from Mission Critical Organizations and
mission critical applications for other businesses and organizations (e.g.
utilities, railways). An MCX Service is either Mission Critical Push To Talk
(MCPTT) as defined in TS 23.379 [38], Mission Critical Video (MCVideo) as
defined in TS 23.281 [39], or Mission Critical Data (MCData) as defined in TS
23.282 [40] and represents a shared underlying set of requirements between two
or more MCX Service types. MCX Services are not restricted only to the ones
defined in this clause and such services can also have priority treatment, if
defined via operator\'s policy and/or local regulation.
MCX Services are based on the ability to invoke, modify, maintain and release
sessions with priority, and deliver the priority media packets under network
congestion conditions. As specified in clause 6.8 of TS 22.261 [2], MCX Users
require 5GS functionality that allows for real-time, dynamic, secure and
limited interaction with the QoS and policy framework for modification of the
QoS and policy framework by authorized users. The limited interaction is based
on operator policy, and provides specific limitations on what aspects of the
QoS and policy framework an authorized MCX User can modify. MCX Services are
supported in a roaming environment when roaming agreements are in place and
where regulatory requirements apply.
An MCX-subscribed UE obtains priority access to the Radio Access Network by
using the Unified Access Control mechanism according to TS 22.261 [2]. This
mechanism provides preferential access to UEs based on its assigned Access
Identity. If an MCX-subscribed UE belongs to the special Access Identity as
defined in TS 22.261 [2], the UE has preferential access to the network
compared to ordinary UEs in periods of congestion. MCX subscription allows
users to receive priority services, if the network supports MCX. MCX
subscription entitles a USIM with special Access Identity.
MCX Services leverage the foundation of the 5G QoS Model as defined in clause
5.7, and 5G Policy Control as defined in clause 5.14. It requires that the
necessary subscriptions are in place for both the 5G QoS Profile and the
necessary Policies. In addition, MCX Services leverage priority mechanism as
defined in clause 5.22.
The terminating network identifies the priority of the MCX Service session and
applies priority treatment, including paging with priority, to ensure that the
MCX Service session can be established with priority to the terminating user
(either an MCX User or normal user).
Priority treatment for MCX Service includes priority message handling,
including priority treatment during authentication, security, and Mobility
Management procedures.
Priority treatment for MCX Service sessions require appropriate ARP and 5QI
(plus 5G QoS characteristics) setting for QoS Flows according to the
operator\'s policy.
NOTE: Use of QoS Flows for MCX Service sessions with non-standardized 5QI
values enables the flexible assignment of 5G QoS characteristics (e.g.
Priority Level).
When a MCX Service session is requested by an MCX User, the following
principles apply in the network:
\- QoS Flows employed in a MCX Service session shall be assigned ARP value
settings appropriate for the priority of the MCX User.
\- Setting ARP pre-emption capability and vulnerability of QoS Flows related
to a MCX Service session, subject to operator policies and depending on
national/regional regulatory requirements.
\- Pre-emption of non-MCX Users over MCX Users during network congestion
situations, subject to operator policy and national/regional regulations.
Priority treatment is applicable to IMS based multimedia services and priority
PDU connectivity services.
Relative PDU priority decisions for MCX Service sessions are based on real-
time data of the state of the network and/or based on modification of the QoS
and policy framework by authorized users as described in clause 6.8 of TS
22.261 [2].
## 5.17 Interworking and Migration
### 5.17.1 Support for Migration from EPC to 5GC
#### 5.17.1.1 General
Clause 5.17.1 describes the UE and network behaviour for the migration from
EPC to 5GC.
Deployments based on different 3GPP architecture options (i.e. EPC based or
5GC based) and UEs with different capabilities (EPC NAS and 5GC NAS) may
coexist at the same time within one PLMN.
It is assumed that a UE that is capable of supporting 5GC NAS procedures may
also be capable of supporting EPC NAS (i.e. the NAS procedures defined in TS
24.301 [13]) to operate in legacy networks e.g. in the case of roaming.
The UE will use EPC NAS or 5GC NAS procedures depending on the core network by
which it is served.
In order to support smooth migration, it is assumed that the EPC and the 5GC
have access to a common subscriber database, that is HSS in the case of EPC
and the UDM in the case of 5GC, acting as the master data base for a given
user as defined in TS 23.002 [21]. The PCF has access to the UDR that acts as
a common subscriber database for a given user identified by a SUPI using the
Nudr services defined in TS 23.502 [3].
Figure 5.17.1.1-1: Architecture for migration scenario for EPC and 5G CN
A UE that supports only EPC based Dual Connectivity with secondary RAT NR:
\- always performs initial access through E-UTRA (LTE-Uu) but never through
NR;
\- performs EPC NAS procedures over E-UTRA (i.e. Mobility Management, Session
Management etc) as defined in TS 24.301 [13].
A UE that supports camping on 5G Systems with 5GC NAS:
\- performs initial access either through E-UTRAN that connects to 5GC or NR
towards 5GC;
\- performs initial access through E-UTRAN towards EPC, if supported and
needed;
\- performs EPC NAS or 5GC NAS procedures over E-UTRAN or NR respectively
(i.e. Mobility Management, Session Management etc) depending on whether the UE
requests 5GC access or EPC access, if the UE also supports EPC NAS.
When camping on an E-UTRA cell connected to both EPC and 5GC, a UE supporting
EPC NAS and 5GC NAS shall select a core network type (EPC or 5GC) and initiate
the corresponding NAS procedure as specified in TS 23.122 [17].
In order to support different UEs with different capabilities in the same
network, i.e. both UEs that are capable of only EPC NAS (possibly including
EPC based Dual Connectivity with secondary NR) and UEs that support 5GC NAS
procedures in the same network:
\- eNB that supports access to 5GC shall broadcast that it can connect to 5GC.
Based on that, the UE AS layer indicates \"E-UTRA connected to 5GC\"
capability to the UE NAS layer. In addition the eNB broadcasts the supported
CIoT 5GS Optimisations that the UE uses for selecting a core network type.
\- It is also expected that the UE AS layer is made aware by the UE NAS layer
whether a NAS signalling connection is to be initiated to the 5GC. Based on
that, UE AS layer indicates to the RAN whether it is requesting 5GC access
(i.e. \"5GC requested\" indication). The RAN uses this indication to determine
whether a UE is requesting 5GC access or an EPC access. RAN routes NAS
signalling to the applicable AMF or MME accordingly.
NOTE: The UE that supports EPC based Dual Connectivity with secondary RAT only
does not provide this \"5GC requested\" indication at Access Stratum when it
performs initial access and therefore eNB uses the \"default\" CN selection
mechanism to direct this UE to an MME
The 5GC network may steer the UE from 5GC based on:
\- Core Network type restriction (e.g. due to lack of roaming agreements)
described in clause 5.3.4.1.1;
\- Availability of EPC connectivity;
\- UE indication of EPC Preferred Network Behaviour; and
\- Supported Network Behaviour.
The UE that wants to use one or more of these functionalities not supported by
5G System, when in CM-IDLE may disable all the related radio capabilities that
allow the UE to access 5G System. The triggers to disable and re-enable the
5GS capabilities to access 5G System in this case are left up to UE
implementation.
#### 5.17.1.2 User Plane management to support interworking with EPS
In order to support the interworking with EPC, the SMF+PGW-C provides
information over N4 to the UPF+PGW-U related to the handling of traffic over
S5-U. Functionality defined in TS 23.503 [45] for traffic steering control on
SGi-LAN/N6 can be activated in UPF+PGW-U under consideration of whether the UE
is connected to EPC or 5GC.
When the UE is connected to EPC and establishes/releases PDN connections, the
following differences apply to N4 compared to when the UE is connected to 5GC:
\- The CN Tunnel Info is allocated for each EPS Bearer.
\- In addition to the Service Data Flow related information, the SMF+PGW-C
shall be able to provide the GBR and MBR values for each GBR bearer of the PDN
connection to the UPF+PGW-U.
If the UE does not have preconfigured rules for associating an application to
a PDN connection (i.e. the UE does not have rules in UE local configuration
and is not provisioned with ANDSF rules), the UE should use a matching URSP
rule as defined in TS 23.503 [45], if available, to derive the parameters,
e.g. APN, for the PDN connection establishment and associating an application
to the PDN connection.
NOTE: The mapping between the parameters in the URSP rules and the parameters
used for PDN connection establishment is defined in TS 24.526 [110].
#### 5.17.1.3 QoS handling for home routed roaming
During mobility from EPS to 5GS, the handling of QoS constraints in V-SMF is
specified in clauses 4.11.1.2.2 and 4.11.1.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3] and follows
the same principle as described in clause 5.7.1.11.
### 5.17.2 Interworking with EPC
#### 5.17.2.1 General
Interworking with EPC in this clause refers to mobility procedures between 5GC
and EPC/E-UTRAN, except for clause 5.17.2.4. Network slicing aspects for EPS
Interworking are specified in clause 5.15.7
In order to interwork with EPC, the UE that supports both 5GC and EPC NAS can
operate in single-registration mode or dual-registration mode:
\- In single-registration mode, UE has only one active MM state (either RM
state in 5GC or EMM state in EPC) and it is either in 5GC NAS mode or in EPC
NAS mode (when connected to 5GC or EPC, respectively). UE maintains a single
coordinated registration for 5GC and EPC. Accordingly, the UE maps the EPS-
GUTI to 5G GUTI during mobility between EPC and 5GC and vice versa following
the mapping rules in Annex B. To enable re-use of a previously established 5G
security context when returning to 5GC, the UE also keeps the native 5G-GUTI
and the native 5G security context when moving from 5GC to EPC.
\- In dual-registration mode, UE handles independent registrations for 5GC and
EPC using separate RRC connections. In this mode, UE maintains 5G-GUTI and
EPS-GUTI independently. In this mode, UE provides native 5G-GUTI, if
previously allocated by 5GC, for registrations towards 5GC and it provides
native EPS-GUTI, if previously allocated by EPC, for Attach/TAU towards EPC.
In this mode, the UE may be registered to 5GC only, EPC only, or to both 5GC
and EPC.
Dual-registration mode is intended for interworking between EPS/E-UTRAN and
5GS/NR. A dual-registered UE should not send its E-UTRA connected to 5GC and
E-UTRAN radio capabilities to NR access when connected to 5GS/NR to avoid
being handed over to 5GC-connected E-UTRA or to E-UTRAN.
NOTE 1: This is to prevent the dual registered UE from being connected to the
same E-UTRA cell either connected to EPC or 5GC simultaneously using separate
RRC connections via single RAN node as a result of handover. If a dual-
registered UE implementation chooses to send its E-UTRA capability when
connected to 5GS/NR, the UE and the network behaviour when UE enters a 5GC-
connected E-UTRA is not further specified. If however the UE is registered
with 5GS/NR only, the UE can send its E-UTRA capability in order to allow
inter-RAT handover to E-UTRA/5GC and Dual Connectivity with multiple RATs.
If a dual-registered UE had not sent its E-UTRA connected to 5GC and E-UTRAN
radio capabilities to 5GS and the UE needs to initiate emergency services, it
shall locally re-enable its E-UTRA connected to 5GC and E-UTRAN radio
capabilities in order to perform domain selection for emergency services as
defined in TS 23.167 [18].
NOTE 2: However even in this case, the UE is still not expected to connect to
E-UTRAN/EPC and E-UTRA/5GC simultaneously using separate RRC connection via
single RAN node as a result of the domain selection for emergency services.
The support of single registration mode is mandatory for UEs that support both
5GC and EPC NAS.
During E-UTRAN Initial Attach, UE supporting both 5GC and EPC NAS shall
indicate its support of 5G NAS in UE Network Capability described in clause
4.11.1.5.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
During registration to 5GC, UE supporting both 5GC and EPC NAS shall indicate
its support of EPC NAS.
NOTE 3: This indication may be used to give the priority towards selection of
SMF+PGW-C for UEs that support both EPC and 5GC NAS.
If the UE supports 5GC NAS, at PDN connection establishment in EPC, the UE may
allocate a PDU Session ID and sends it via PCO, regardless of N1 mode status
(i.e. enabled or disabled) in the UE.
NOTE 4: UE providing a PDU Session ID at PDN connection establishment even
when N1 mode is disabled allows for IP address preservation during EPC to 5GC
mobility once the UE re-enables N1 mode.
NOTE 5: For the case the MME has selected a standalone PGW for a PDN
connection, if the UE re-enables N1 mode and reports the change in UE Network
Capability, the MME can initiate PDN disconnection with reactivation required
as described in clause 4.11.0a.8 of TS 23.502 [3] to allow selection of
SMF+PGW-C thus session continuity at EPC to 5GC mobility.
If the EPC supports \"Ethernet\" PDU Session Type, and the 5GSM Capabilities
indicate that the UE supports Ethernet PDN type in EPC, then PDU Session type
\"Ethernet\" is transferred to EPC as \"Ethernet\". Otherwise, PDU Session
types \"Ethernet\" and \"Unstructured\" are transferred to EPC as \"non-IP\"
PDN type (when supported by UE and network). If the UE or EPC does not support
Ethernet PDN type in EPC, the UE sets the PDN type to non-IP when it moves
from 5GS to EPS and after the transfer to EPS, and the UE and the SMF shall
maintain information about the PDU Session type used in 5GS, i.e. information
indicating that the PDN Connection with \"non-IP\" PDN type corresponds to PDU
Session type Ethernet or Unstructured respectively. This is done to ensure
that the appropriate PDU Session type will be used if the UE transfers to 5GS.
PDN type \"non-IP\" is transferred to 5GS as \"Unstructured\" PDU Session type
if it is successfully transferred.
It is assumed that if a UE supports Ethernet PDU Session type and/or
Unstructured PDU Session type in 5GS it will also support non-IP PDN type in
EPS. If this is not the case, the UE shall locally delete any EBI(s)
corresponding to the Ethernet/Unstructured PDU Session(s) to avoid that the
Ethernet/Unstructured PDU Session(s) are transferred to EPS.
MTU size consideration for PDU Sessions and PDN Connections towards a
SMF+PGW-C follows the requirements in clause 5.6.10.4.
Networks that support interworking with EPC, may support interworking
procedures that use the N26 interface or interworking procedures that do not
use the N26 interface. Interworking procedures with N26 support provides IP
address continuity on inter-system mobility to UEs that support 5GC NAS and
EPC NAS and that operate in single registration mode. Networks that support
interworking procedures without N26 shall support procedures to provide IP
address continuity on inter-system mobility to UEs operating in both single-
registration mode and dual-registration mode. In such networks, AMF shall
provide the indication that interworking without N26 is supported to UEs
during initial Registration in 5GC or MME may optionally provide the
indication that interworking without N26 is supported in the Attach procedure
in EPC as defined in TS 23.401 [26].
If the network does not support interworking with EPC, network shall not
indicate support for \"interworking without N26\" to the UE.
When the HSS+UDM is required to provide the subscription data to the MME, for
each APN, only one SMF+PGW-C FQDN and associated APN is provided to the MME
according to TS 23.401 [26].
For interworking without N26 interface:
\- if the PDU session supports interworking, the SMF+PGW-C stores the
SMF+PGW-C FQDN to SMF context in HSS+UDM when the SMF is registered to
HSS+UDM.
\- For an APN, the HSS+UDM selects one of the stored SMF+PGW-C FQDN based on
operator\'s policy.
For interworking with N26 interface:
\- For a DNN, AMF determines PDU session(s) associated with 3GPP access in
only one SMF+PGW-C supporting EPS interworking via EBI allocation procedure as
described in clause 4.11.1.4.1 of TS 23.502 [3].
\- If the network supports EPS interworking of non-3GPP access connected to
5GC, the AMF serving 3GPP access notifies the UDM to store the association
between DNN and SMF+PGW-C FQDN which supports EPS interworking as Intersystem
continuity context, to avoid MME receiving inconsistent SMF+PGW-C FQDN from
AMF and HSS+UDM.
\- The AMF updates Intersystem continuity context if the SMF+PGW-C and DNN
association is changed due to the AMF selecting another SMF+PGW-C for EPS
interworking for the same DNN.
\- If the SMF+PGW-C FQDN and associated DNN exists in Intersystem continuity
context, the HSS+UDM provides MME with SMF+PGW-C FQDN and associated APN.
It does not assume that the HSS+UDM is aware of whether N26 is deployed in the
serving network. The HSS+UDM check the Intersystem continuity context first.
If no SMF+PGW-C FQDN associated with an DNN exists in Intersystem continuity
context, the HSS+UDM selects one of the SMF+PGW-C FQDN for the APN from SMF
context based on operator\'s policy.
In entire clause 5.17.2 the terms \"initial attach\", \"handover attach\" and
\"TAU\" for the UE procedures in EPC can alternatively be combined EPS/IMSI
Attach and combined TA/LA depending on the UE configuration defined in TS
23.221 [23].
If a UE in MICO mode moves to E-UTRAN connected to EPC and any of the triggers
defined in clause 5.4.1.3 occur, then the UE shall locally disable MICO mode
and perform the TAU or Attach procedure as defined in clause 5.17.2. The UE
can renegotiate MICO when it returns to 5GS during (re-)registration
procedure.
IP address preservation for IP PDU sessions cannot be ensured on subsequent
mobility from EPC/E-UTRAN to GERAN/UTRAN to a UE that had initially registered
in 5GS and moved to EPC/E-UTRAN.
NOTE 6: The SMF+PGW-C might not include the GERAN/UTRAN PDP Context anchor
functionality. Also, 5GC does not provide GERAN/UTRAN PDP Context parameters
to the UE when QoS Flows of PDU Session are setup or modified in 5GS. Hence,
the UE might not be able to activate the PDP contexts when it transitions to
GERAN/UTRAN.
IP address preservation for IP PDU sessions cannot be ensured on subsequent
mobility from EPC/E-UTRAN to 5GS for a 5GS NAS capable UE that had initially
established a PDP context via GERAN/UTRAN and moved to EPC/E-UTRAN. IP address
preservation for IP PDU session mobility between EPC/E-UTRAN and 5GS may be
re-ensured as specified in clause 5.17.2.4 when UE moves from GERAN/UTRAN into
EPC/E-UTRAN.
NOTE 7: The PGW acting as a GGSN might not support SMF+PGW-C functionality.
GPRS does not support 5GS parameters transfer between UE and SMF+PGW-C (e.g.
providing of PDU session ID and 5GS QoS information).
When a PDU session is moved from 5GS to EPS, the SMF+PGW-C keeps the
registration and subscription in HSS+UDM until the corresponding PDN
connection is released.
The SMF+PGW-C receives notification of subscription update regarding the 5G
parameters (e.g. DNNs, S-NSSAIs) which are associated with the established PDN
connection(s) connecting via EPS. If the subscription regarding DNN, QoS
profile or PDN connection type associated with the PDN connection is updated,
then the MME receives the subscription update and triggers corresponding
actions according to TS 23.401 [26]. If the SMF+PGW-C receives subscription
updates (e.g. change of 5GS Subscribed NSSAI) from the UDM the SMF+PGW-C
triggers corresponding actions for the PDN connection. This may include
(depending on the modified parameter) to:
\- update the UPF (e.g. for a change of Framed Route information); or
\- release the PDN connection with an appropriate cause (e.g. for change of
EPS/5GS interworking support, for subscription removal of S-NSSAI associated
with the PDN connection);
\- do nothing about changes to DNN and/or PDU Session type that are handled by
the MME.
If header compression is used for Control Plane CIoT EPS/5GS Optimisations and
when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS or from 5GS to EPS, the UE may initiate the
PDU Session Modification Procedure or UE requested bearer resource
modification procedure to renegotiate the header compression configuration and
to establish the compression context between the UE and MME/SMF, see TS 23.401
[26] and TS 24.501 [47].
If the UE is moving from 5GS to EPS and the RAT type is also moving from a
\"broadband\" RAT (e.g. NR or WB-E-UTRA) to NB-IoT in EMM-IDLE state, the UE
should set the mapped EPS bearer context for which the EPS bearer is a
dedicated EPS bearer to state BEARER CONTEXT INACTIVE as for NB-IoT UEs in EPS
only support the default bearers. In addition, UE shall locally deactivate the
related bearers according to the maximum number of supported UP resources and
send the latest bearer context status in the TAU Request.
If APN Rate Control is used when the UE moves from EPC to 5GC then the
P-GW/SCEF and UE store the current APN Rate Control Status for an APN. If
while connected to 5GC the last PDU Session to a DNN that is the same as the
APN identified in the APN Rate Control Status is released then the APN Rate
Control Status may be stored in the AMF in addition to the Small Data Rate
Control Status and the UE discards the APN Rate Control Status. The APN Rate
Control Status is stored in the AMF so it can be provided to the MME during
mobility to EPC and subsequently applied at establishment of a new first PDN
Connection to the same APN, if valid. The APN Rate Control Status is provided
to the UPF+PGW-U if a first new PDU Session is established towards the DNN
that is the same as the APN identified in the APN Rate Control Status if the
UE moves back to EPC, taking into account its validity period.
The UE may be provided with initial APN Rate Control parameters by the SMF
when a first new PDU Session is established for a DNN and S-NSSAI that
supports interworking with EPS and the DNN matches an APN. The SMF provides
the APN Rate Control Status for the APN that matches the DNN, if available at
the SMF, otherwise the configured APN Rate Control parameters for the APN that
matches the DNN are provided as the initially applied parameters. If the
initially applied parameters differ from the configured APN Rate Control
parameters and the first APN Rate Control validity period expires, the UE is
updated with the configured APN Rate Control parameters once the UE has moved
to EPC.
NOTE 8: If the APN Rate Control Status is provided to a UPF+PGW-U it is not
used for Small Data Rate Control while the UE is connected to 5GC, it is only
used as the APN Rate Control Status if the UE moves to EPC.
NOTE 9: Encoding of APN and DNN specified in TS 23.003 [19] allows the
comparison of EPS APN and 5GS DNN.
If a Service Gap timer is running in the AMF when the UE moves from 5GC to
EPC, the AMF stops the running Service Gap timer. If the UE returns to 5GC
from EPC the AMF provides the Service Gap Time to the UE as described in
clause 5.31.16.
If a Service Gap timer is running in the MME when the UE moves from EPC to
5GC, the MME stops the running Service Gap timer. If the UE returns to E-UTRAN
connected to EPC from 5GC the MME provides the Service Gap Time to the UE as
described in TS 23.401 [26].
If a Service Gap timer is running in the UE when the UE moves to from 5GC to
EPC and if Service Gap Time is received from the MME, the UE stores the
received Service Gap Time for later use when the timer needs to be started
next time, and the Service Gap timer that was started before the system change
is kept running in the UE and applied for EPC. If a Service Gap timer is
running in the UE when the UE moves to 5GC and if Service Gap Time is received
from the AMF, the UE stores the received Service Gap Time for later use when
the timer needs to be started next time, and the Service Gap timer that was
started before the system change is kept running in the UE and applied in 5GS.
For UE currently served by EPC, a SMF+PGW-C may support L2TP tunnelling on N6,
as described in clause 5.8.2.16.

##### 5.17.2.2.1 General
Interworking procedures using the N26 interface, enables the exchange of MM
and SM states between the source and target network. The N26 interface may be
either intra-PLMN or inter-PLMN (e.g. to enable inter-PLMN mobility). When
interworking procedures with N26 is used, the UE operates in single-
registration mode. For the 3GPP access, the network keeps only one valid MM
state for the UE, either in the AMF or MME. For the 3GPP access, either the
AMF or the MME is registered in the HSS+UDM.
The support for N26 interface between AMF in 5GC and MME in EPC is required to
enable seamless session continuity (e.g. for voice services) for inter-system
change.
The UE\'s subscription may include restriction for Core Network Type (EPC) and
RAT restriction for E-UTRA. If so, the UDM provides these restrictions to the
AMF. The AMF includes RAT and Core Network type restrictions in the Handover
Restriction List to the NR. The AMF and NR use these restrictions to determine
if mobility of the UE to EPS or E-UTRA connected to EPS should be permitted.
When the UE moves from 5GS to EPS, the SMF determines which PDU Sessions can
be relocated to the target EPS, e.g. based on capability of the deployed EPS,
operator policies for which PDU Session, seamless session continuity should be
supported etc. The SMF can release the PDU Sessions that cannot be transferred
as part of the handover or Idle mode mobility. However, whether the PDU
Session is successfully moved to the target network is determined by target
EPS.
Similarly, the UE\'s subscription may include restriction for Core Network
Type (5GC) and RAT restriction for NR. If so, the HSS provides these
restrictions to the MME. The MME includes RAT and Core Network type
restrictions in the Handover Restriction List to the E-UTRAN. The MME and
E-UTRAN use these restrictions to determine if mobility of the UE to 5GS or NR
connected to 5GS should be permitted. If the SMF+PGW-C receives the PDU
session ID from UE via PCO and know 5GC is not restricted for the PDN
connection by user subscription, the SMF+PGW-C sends the mapped QoS parameters
to UE. When the UE moves from EPS to 5GS, for the case when the MME has
selected SMF+PGW-C even for PDN connections that cannot be relocated to the
target 5GS, the SMF+PGW-C determines which PDN Connections can be relocated to
the target 5GS, e.g. based on capability of the deployed 5GS, subscription and
operator policies for which PDN Connection, seamless session continuity should
be supported etc. The SMF+PGW-C and NG-RAN can reject the PDN Connections that
cannot be transferred as part of the handover or Idle mode mobility.
For the case when the MME has selected standalone P-GW for a PDN connection
for which session continuity is not supported and the AMF cannot retrieve the
address of the corresponding SMF during EPS to 5GS mobility, the AMF does not
move the PDN connection to 5GS.
NOTE 1: When applying the AMF planned removal procedure or the procedure to
handle AMF failures (see clause 5.21.2) implementations are expected to update
the DNS configuration to enable MMEs to discover alternative AMFs if the MME
tries to retrieve a UE context from an AMF that has been taken out of service
or has failed. This addresses the scenario of UEs performing 5GS to EPS Idle
mode mobility and presenting a mapped GUTI pointing to an AMF that has been
taken out of service or has failed.
In the case of mobility from 5GS to EPS, if the MME lacks certain capability,
e.g. MME not supporting 15 EPS bearers, the 5GC shall not transfer the UE EPS
bearers and/or EPS PDN connections that are not supported by the EPC network.
If the MME does not support 15 EPS bearers, the AMF determines which EBIs
cannot be transferred to EPS, and retrieves the EPS bearer contexts from the
SMF+PGW-C for the EBIs that can be transferred to EPS.
NOTE 2: How the AMF determines which EBIs can be transferred to EPS is
according to local configuration, e.g. according to DNN, S-NSSAI, ARP
associated with an EBI.
##### 5.17.2.2.2 Mobility for UEs in single-registration mode
When the UE supports single-registration mode and network supports
interworking procedure with the N26 interface:
\- For idle mode mobility from 5GS to EPS, the UE performs either TAU or
Attach procedure with EPS GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI sent as old Native GUTI, as
described in clause 4.11.1.3.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3] and indicates that it is
moving from 5GC. The UE includes in the RRC message a GUMMEI mapped from the
5G-GUTI and indicates it as a native GUMMEI and should in addition indicate it
as \"Mapped from 5G-GUTI\". The MME retrieves the UE\'s MM and SM context from
5GC. For connected mode mobility from 5GS to EPS, either inter-system handover
or RRC Connection Release with Redirection to E-UTRAN is performed. At inter-
system handover, the AMF selects target MME based on 2 octet TAC format used
in the Target ID as specified in TS 38.413 [34]. During the TAU or Attach
procedure the HSS+UDM cancels any AMF registration associated with the 3GPP
access (but not AMF registration associated with the non-3GPP access): an AMF
that was serving the UE over both 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses does not consider
the UE as deregistered over non 3GPP access.
\- For the first TAU after 5GC initial Registration, the UE and MME for the
handling of UE Radio Capabilities follow the procedures as defined in clause
5.11.2 of TS 23.401 [26] for first TAU after GERAN/UTRAN Attach.
NOTE 1: MMEs supporting interworking with N26 interface are not required to
process the indication from the UE that it is moving from 5GC and will assume
that the UE is moving from another MME.
\- For idle mode mobility from EPC to 5GC, the UE performs mobility
Registration procedure with the 5G GUTI mapped from EPS GUTI and indicates
that it is moving from EPC. The UE derives GUAMI from the native 5G-GUTI and
includes GUAMI in the RRC message to enable RAN to route to the corresponding
AMF (if available). If the UE holds no native 5G-GUTI, then the UE provides in
the RRC message a GUAMI mapped from the EPS GUTI and indicates it as \"Mapped
from EPS\". The AMF and SMF retrieve the UE\'s MM and SM context from EPC. For
connected mode mobility from EPC to 5GC, either inter-system handover or RRC
Connection Release with Redirection to NG-RAN is performed. At inter-system
handover, the MME selects target AMF based on TAC used in the Target ID as
specified in TS 38.413 [34]. During the Registration procedure, the HSS+UDM
cancels any MME registration.
NOTE 2: During a transition period, the source eNB may be configured via O&M
to know that the MME is not upgraded and thus supports only 2 octet TAC. The
Target ID for the NG-RAN node is set as \"Target eNB ID\" in the existing IEs
as defined in TS 38.413 [34].
For both idle mode and connected mode mobility from EPC to 5GC:
\- The UE includes the native 5G-GUTI as an additional GUTI in the
Registration request; the AMF uses the native 5G-GUTI to retrieve MM context
identified by the 5G-GUTI from old AMF or from UDSF (if UDSF is deployed and
the old AMF is within the same AMF set).
\- If this is the first mobility event for a PDU Session that was established
while being connected to EPC, the UE shall trigger the PDU Session
Modification procedure and:
\- should indicate the support of Reflective QoS to the network (i.e. SMF) if
the UE supports Reflective QoS functionality. If the UE indicated support of
Reflective QoS, the network may provide a Reflective QoS Timer (RQ Timer)
value to the UE;
\- shall indicate the number of supported packet filters for signalled QoS
rules, if the UE supports more than 16 packet filters for the PDU Session. The
network shall store this information so that subsequent mobility events do not
require another signalling of it.
\- should indicate the support of Multi-homed IPv6 PDU session to the network
(i.e. SMF) if the UE supports Multi-homed IPv6 PDU session. If the UE
indicated support of Multi-homed IPv6 PDU session, the network shall consider
that this PDU session is supported to use multiple IPv6 prefixes.
\- should provide the UE Integrity Protection Maximum Data Rate to the network
(i.e. SMF). The network shall consider that the maximum data rate per UE for
user-plane integrity protection supported by the UE is valid for the lifetime
of the PDU session.
#### 5.17.2.3 Interworking Procedures without N26 interface
##### 5.17.2.3.1 General
For interworking without the N26 interface, IP address preservation is
provided to the UEs on inter-system mobility by storing and fetching SMF+PGW-C
and corresponding APN/DNN information via the HSS+UDM. In such networks AMF
also provides an indication that interworking without N26 is supported to UEs
during Initial Registration in 5GC or MME may optionally provide an indication
that interworking without N26 is supported in the Attach procedure in EPC as
defined in TS 23.502 [3] and TS 23.401 [26]. The UE provides an indication
that it supports Request Type flag \"handover\" for PDN connectivity request
during the attach procedure as described in clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [26]
and during initial Registration and Mobility Registration Update in 5GC.
NOTE 1: The UE support of Request Type flag \"handover\" for PDN connectivity
request during the attach procedure is needed for IP address preservation in
the case of interworking without N26.
The indication that interworking without N26 is valid for the entire
Registered PLMN and for PLMNs equivalent to the Registered PLMN that are
available in the Registration Area. The same indication is provided to all UEs
served by the same PLMN. UEs that operate in interworking without N26 may use
this indication to decide whether to register early in the target system. UEs
that only support single registration mode may use this indication as
described in clause 5.17.2.3.2. UE that support dual registration mode uses
this indication as described in clause 5.17.2.3.3.
Interworking procedures without N26 interface use the following two features:
1\. When UE performs Initial Attach in EPC (with or without \"Handover\"
indication in PDN CONNECTIVITY Request message) and indicates that it is
moving from 5GC, the MME indicates to the HSS+UDM not to cancel the
registration of AMF, if any.
2\. When UE performs Initial Registration in 5GC and indicates that it is
moving from EPC, the AMF indicates to the HSS+UDM not to cancel the
registration of MME, if any.
To support mobility both for single and dual registration mode UEs, the
following also are supported by the network:
3\. When PDU Session are created in 5GC, the SMF+PGW-C which supports EPS
interworking stores the SMF+PGW-C FQDN along with DNN in the HSS+UDM.
4\. The HSS+UDM provides the information about dynamically allocated SMF+PGW-C
and APN/DNN information to the target CN network. If there are multiple
SMF+PGW-C serving the UE for the same DNN which support EPS interworking in
5GS, the HSS+UDM select one of them according to operator\'s policy and
provides together with the associated APN to the MME.
5\. When PDN connections are created in EPC, the MME stores the SMF+PGW-C and
APN information in the HSS+UDM.
NOTE 2: Items 3, 4 and 5 are also supported in networks that support
interworking with N26 procedures. This enables a VPLMN that does not deploy
N26 interface to provide IP address preservation to roamed-in single-
registration mode UEs from a HPLMN that only supports interworking with N26
procedures.
When the network serving the UE supports 5GS-EPS interworking procedures
without N26 interface, the SMF shall not provide the UEs with mapped target
system parameters of the target system when UE is in the source network.
A UE that operates in dual registration mode ignores any received mapped
target system parameters (e.g. QoS parameters, bearer IDs/QFI, PDU Session ID,
etc.).
##### 5.17.2.3.2 Mobility for UEs in single-registration mode
When the UE supports single-registration mode and network supports
interworking procedure without N26 interface:
\- For mobility from 5GC to EPC, the UE with at least one PDU Session
established in 5GC may either:
\- if supported and if it has received the network indication that
interworking without N26 is supported, perform Attach in EPC with a native EPS
GUTI, if available, otherwise with IMSI with Request type \"Handover\" in PDN
CONNECTIVITY Request message (clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [26]) and indicating
that the UE is moving from 5GC and subsequently moves all its other PDU
Session using the UE requested PDN connectivity establishment procedure with
Request Type \"handover\" flag (clause 5.10.2 of TS 23.401 [26]), or.
\- perform TAU with 4G-GUTI mapped from 5G-GUTI sent as old Native GUTI
(clause 5.3.3 of TS 23.401 [26]) indicating that it is moving from 5GC, in
which case the MME instructs the UE to re-attach. IP address preservation is
not provided in this case.
\- for the first TAU after 5GC initial Registration, the UE and MME for the
handling of UE Radio Capabilities follow the procedures as defined in clause
5.11.2 TS 23.401 [26] for first TAU after GERAN/UTRAN Attach.
NOTE 1: The first PDN connection may be established during the E-UTRAN Initial
Attach procedure (see TS 23.401 [26]).
NOTE 2: At inter-PLMN mobility to a PLMN that is not an equivalent PLMN the UE
always uses the TAU procedure.
\- For mobility from 5GC to EPC, the UE with no PDU Session established in 5GC
\- performs Attach in EPC (clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [26]) indicating that
the UE is moving from 5GC.
\- For mobility from EPC to 5GC, the UE performs Mobility Registration Update
in 5GC with 5G-GUTI mapped from EPS GUTI and a native 5G-GUTI, if available,
as Additional GUTI and indicating that the UE is moving from EPC. In this
case, the AMF determines that old node is an MME, but proceeds as if the
Registration is of type \"initial registration\". The UE may either:
\- if supported and if it has received the network indication \"interworking
without N26 supported\", move all its PDN connections from EPC using the UE
initiated PDU Session Establishment procedure with \"Existing PDU Sessions\"
flag (clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3]), or
\- re-establish PDU Sessions corresponding to the PDN connections that it had
in EPS. IP address preservation is not provided in this case.
NOTE 3: The additional native 5G-GUTI enables the AMF to find the UE\'s 5G
security context (if available).
NOTE 4: When single-registration mode UE uses interworking procedures without
N26, the registration states during the transition period (e.g. while UE is
transferring all PDU Sessions / PDN Connections on the target side) are
defined in Stage 3 specifications.
\- If the network determines that the UE is changing RAT type, if the UE
requests to relocate the PDU session from EPC to 5GC or 5GC to EPC, the
SMF/MME uses the \"PDU session continuity at inter RAT mobility\" or \"PDN
continuity at inter-RAT mobility\" information, respectively, in the
subscription to determine whether to maintain the PDU session/PDN connection
(if being handed over) or reject the PDU session request, with the relevant
cause.
\- If the UE requested to move the PDU session and the \"PDN continuity at
inter RAT mobility\" information indicated \"disconnect the PDN connection
with a reactivation request\" the network should provide a suitable cause code
to the UE so that it can request a new PDU session.
##### 5.17.2.3.3 Mobility for UEs in dual-registration mode
To support mobility in dual-registration mode, the support of N26 interface
between AMF in 5GC and MME in EPC is not required. A UE that supports dual
registration mode may operate in this mode when it receives an indication from
the network that interworking without N26 is supported.
For UE operating in dual-registration mode the following principles apply for
PDU Session transfer from 5GC to EPC:
\- UE operating in Dual Registration mode may register in EPC ahead of any PDU
Session transfer using the Attach procedure indicating that the UE is moving
from 5GC without establishing a PDN Connection in EPC if the EPC supports EPS
Attach without PDN Connectivity as defined in TS 23.401 [26]. Support for EPS
Attach without PDN Connectivity is mandatory for UE supporting dual-
registration procedures.
NOTE 1: Before attempting early registration in EPC the UE needs to check
whether EPC supports EPS Attach without PDN Connectivity by reading the
related SIB in the target cell.
\- UE performs PDU Session transfer from 5GC to EPC using the UE initiated PDN
connection establishment procedure with \"handover\" indication in the PDN
Connection Request message (clause 5.10.2 of TS 23.401 [26]).
\- If the UE has not registered with EPC ahead of the PDU Session transfer,
the UE can perform Attach in EPC with \"handover\" indication in the PDN
Connection Request message (clause 5.3.2.1 of TS 23.401 [26]).
\- UE may selectively transfer certain PDU Sessions to EPC, while keeping
other PDU Sessions in 5GC.
\- UE may maintain the registration up to date in both 5GC and EPC by re-
registering periodically in both systems. If the registration in either 5GC or
EPC times out (e.g. upon mobile reachable timer expiry), the corresponding
network starts an implicit detach timer.
NOTE 2: Whether UE transfers some or all PDU Sessions on the EPC side and
whether it maintains the registration up to date in both EPC and 5GC can
depend on UE capabilities that are implementation dependent. The information
for determining which PDU Sessions are transferred on EPC side and the
triggers can be pre-configured in the UE and are not specified in this Release
of the specification. The UE does not know before-hand, i.e. before trying to
move a given PDU session to EPC, whether that PDU session can be transferred
to EPC.
For UE operating in dual-registration mode the following principles apply for
PDN connection transfer from EPC to 5GC:
\- UE operating in Dual Registration mode may register in 5GC ahead of any PDN
connection transfer using the Registration procedure indicating that the UE is
moving from EPC (clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]).
\- UE performs PDN connection transfer from EPC to 5GC using the UE initiated
PDU Session Establishment procedure with \"Existing PDU Session\" indication
(clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3]).
\- UE may selectively transfer certain PDN connections to 5GC, while keeping
other PDN Connections in EPC.
\- UE may maintain the registration up to date in both EPC and 5GC by re-
registering periodically in both systems. If the registration in either EPC or
5GC times out (e.g. upon mobile reachable timer expiry), the corresponding
network starts an implicit detach timer.
NOTE 3: Whether UE transfers some or all PDN connections on the 5GC side and
whether it maintains the registration up to date in both 5GC and EPC can
depend on UE capabilities that are implementation dependent. The information
for determining which PDN connections are transferred on 5GC side and the
triggers can be pre-configured in the UE and are not specified in this Release
of the specification. The UE does not know before-hand, i.e. before trying to
move a given PDN connection to 5GC, whether that PDN connection can be
transferred to 5GC.
NOTE 4: If EPC does not support EPS Attach without PDN Connectivity the MME
detaches the UE when the last PDN connection is released by the PGW as
described in clause 5.4.4.1 of TS 23.401 [26] (in relation to transfer of the
last PDN connection to non-3GPP access).
When sending a control plane request for MT services (e.g. MT SMS) the network
routes it via either the EPC or the 5GC. In absence of UE response, the
network should attempt routing the control plane request via the other system.
NOTE 5: The choice of the system through which the network attempts to deliver
the control plane request first is left to network configuration.
##### 5.17.2.3.4 Redirection for UEs in connected state
When the UE supports single-registration mode or dual-registration mode
without N26 interface:
\- If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state in 5GC, the NG-RAN may perform RRC
Connection Release with Redirection to E-UTRAN based on certain criteria (e.g.
based on local configuration in NG-RAN, or triggered by the AMF upon receiving
Handover Request message from NG-RAN).
\- If the UE is in ECM-CONNECTED state in EPC, the E-UTRAN may perform RRC
Connection release with redirection to NG-RAN based on certain criteria (e.g.
based on local configuration in E-UTRAN, or triggered by the MME upon
receiving handover request from E-UTRAN).
#### 5.17.2.4 Mobility between 5GS and GERAN/UTRAN
IP address preservation upon direct mobility between 5GS and GERAN/UTRAN is
not supported.
Upon mobility from 5GS to GERAN/UTRAN (e.g. upon leaving NG-RAN coverage) the
UE shall perform the A/Gb mode GPRS Attach procedure or Iu mode GPRS Attach
procedure (see TS 23.060 [56]).
As a UE option, to support IP address preservation at mobility from EPC to 5GS
for PDN connections without 5GS related parameters, a 5GS capable UE may:
\- Following mobility from GERAN/UTRAN to EPS, release those PDN connection(s)
and re-establish them as specified in clause 4.11.1.5.4.1 of TS 23.502 [3] so
that they support interworking to 5GS.
NOTE 1: It is recommended that a UE using this option does not do this
behaviour after every change to EPS in PLMNs that do not support 5GS, nor for
APNs that do not support mobility to 5GS; and, that such a UE supports storage
of the 5GS related parameters while in GERAN/UTRAN. Whether and how the UE is
aware of which PLMNs support 5GS and which APNs do not support mobility to 5GS
is out of scope of this specification.
To support mobility from EPC to 5GS to EPC to GERAN/UTRAN for PDN connections
established in EPC:
NOTE 2: For the use of N7 or N40 interfaces while the UE is in GERAN/UTRAN
access, the SMF+PGW-C selected by the MME (using the existing selection
procedures described in clause 4.11.0a of TS 23.502 [3] and clause 4.3.8 of TS
23.401 [26]) needs to support functionality (e.g. signalling of GERAN/UTRAN
cell identification over N7) specified in Annex L.
\- in signalling sent on the N26 interface, the MME should send the TI and BSS
Container in the EPS Bearer Context (see Table 7.3.1-3 of TS 29.274 [101]), if
there is any, of the EPS bearer to the SMF (V-SMF / I-SMF) via the AMF in the
Bearer Context within the PDN Connection IE in the Forward Relocation Request
and Context Response messages (TS 29.274 [101]); the SMF (V-SMF / I-SMF)
should store the TI and BSS Container and the SMF (V-SMF / I-SMF) should
provide the TI and BSS Container to the AMF (as part of a procedure to deliver
SM context to AMF) so that the AMF sends the TI and BSS Container of the
related EPS bearer in the Bearer Context within the EPS PDN Connection
information in any subsequent Forward Relocation Request and Context Response
message sent to an MME.
NOTE 3: At mobility from EPC, the SMF+PGW-C / V-SMF / I-SMF receives the TI
and BSS Container as part of the UE EPS PDN Connection information from the
AMF and stores the TI. At mobility to EPC, the SMF+PGW-C / V-SMF / I-SMF
provides the AMF with the TI and BSS Container as part of the UE EPS PDN
Connection information. The SMF+PGW-C / V-SMF / I-SMF is not meant to
understand the TI/BSS Container nor to use it for any other purpose than
providing it back to AMF.
NOTE 4: GERAN/UTRAN Mobility Management Bearer Synchronisation procedures will
release any dedicated QoS Flows established in 5GS.
NOTE 5: When the UE access the network via GERAN/UTRAN over Gn/Gp interface,
Secondary PDP Context Activation Procedure is not supported.
IP address preservation at mobility from EPC to GERAN/UTRAN for PDU sessions
established in 5GS is not supported.
With regard to interworking between 5GS and the Circuit Switched domain when
the GERAN or UTRAN network is operating in NMO II (i.e. no Gs interface
between MSC and SGSN):
\- upon mobility from 5GS to GERAN/UTRAN, the UE shall either:
\- act as if it is returning after a loss of GERAN/UTRAN coverage (and e.g.
only perform a periodic LAU if the periodic LAU timer has expired), or,
\- perform a Location Update to the MSC. If the UE is registered for IMS voice
and is configured, using Device Management or initial provisioning, to perform
additional mobility management procedures when it has moved from a RAT that
supports IMS voice over PS sessions to one that does not (see TS 23.060 [56]),
it shall follow this option.
Upon mobility from GERAN/UTRAN to 5GS (e.g. upon selecting an NG-RAN cell) the
UE shall perform the Registration procedure of \"initial registration\" type
as described in TS 23.502 [3]. The UE shall indicate a 5G-GUTI as UE identity
in the Registration procedure if it has a stored valid native 5G-GUTI (e.g.
from an earlier registration in the 5G System). Otherwise the UE shall
indicate a SUCI.
If a UE in MICO mode moves to GERAN/UTRAN and any of the triggers defined in
clause 5.4.1.3 occur, then the UE shall locally disable MICO mode and perform
the A/Gb mode GPRS Attach procedure or Iu mode GPRS Attach procedure (see TS
23.060 [56]). The UE can renegotiate MICO when it returns to 5GS during
(re-)registration procedure.
In Single Registration mode, expiry of the periodic RAU timer, or, the
periodic LAU timer shall not cause the UE to change RAT.
The 5G SRVCC from NG-RAN to UTRAN is specified in the TS 23.216 [88]. After
the 5G SRVCC to UTRAN, all the PDU sessions of the UE are released.
### 5.17.3 Interworking with EPC in presence of Non-3GPP PDU Sessions
When a UE is simultaneously connected to the 5GC over a 3GPP access and a
non-3GPP access, it may have PDU Sessions associated with 3GPP access and PDU
Sessions associated with non-3GPP access. When inter-system handover from 5GS
to EPS is performed for PDU Sessions associated with 3GPP access, the PDU
Sessions associated with non-3GPP access are kept anchored by the network in
5GC and the UE may either:
\- keep PDU Sessions associated with non-3GPP access in 5GS (5GC+N3IWF or
TNGF) (i.e. the UE is then registered both in EPS and, for non-3GPP access, in
5GS); or
\- locally or explicitly release PDU Sessions associated with non-3GPP access;
or
\- once in EPS, transfer PDU Sessions associated with non-3GPP access to
E-UTRAN by triggering PDN connection establishment with Request Type
\"Handover\", as specified in TS 23.401 [26].
### 5.17.4 Network sharing support and interworking between EPS and 5GS
The detailed description for supporting network sharing and interworking
between EPS and 5GS is described in clauses 4.11.1.2.1, 4.11.1.2.2, 4.11.1.3.2
and 4.11.1.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
### 5.17.5 Service Exposure in Interworking Scenarios
#### 5.17.5.1 General
Clause 4.3.5 shows the Service Exposure Network Architecture in scenarios
where for EPC-5GC Interworking is required.
In scenarios where interworking between 5GS and EPC is possible, the network
configuration is expected to associate UEs with SCEF+NEF node(s) for Service
Capability Exposure. The SCEF+NEF hides the underlying 3GPP network topology
from the AF (e.g. SCS/AS) and hides whether the UE is served by 5GC or EPC.
If the service exposure function that is associated with a given service for a
UE is configured in the UE\'s subscription information, then an SCEF+NEF
identity shall be used to identify the exposure function. For example, if a UE
is capable of switching between EPC and 5GC, then the SCEF ID that is
associated with any of the UE\'s APN configurations should point to an
SCEF+NEF node.
For external exposure of services related to specific UE(s), the SCEF+NEF
resides in the HPLMN. Depending on operator agreements, the SCEF+NEF in the
HPLMN may have interface(s) with NF(s) in the VPLMN.
The SCEF+NEF exposes over N33 the same API as the SCEF supports over T8. If
CAPIF is not supported, the AF is locally configured with the API termination
points for each service. If CAPIF is supported, the AF obtains the service API
information from the CAPIF core function via the Availability of service APIs
event notification or Service Discover Response as specified in TS 23.222
[64].
The common state information shall be maintained by the combined SCEF+NEF node
in order to meet the external interface requirements of the combined node. The
common state information includes at least the following data that needs to be
common for the SCEF and NEF roles of SCEF+NEF:
\- SCEF+NEF ID (must be the same towards the AF).
\- SCEF+NEF common IP address and port number.
\- Monitoring state for any ongoing monitoring request.
\- Configured set of APIs supported by SCEF+ NEF.
\- PDN Connection/PDU Session State and NIDD Configuration Information,
including Reliable Data Service state information.
\- Network Parameter Configuration Information (e.g. Maximum Response Time and
Maximum Latency).
The SCEF+NEF need not perform the same procedures for the configuration of
monitoring events towards the HSS+UDM twice. For example, if the HSS+UDM is
deployed as a combined node, a monitoring event only need to be configured by
the SCEF+NEF just once.
The SCEF+NEF may configure monitoring events applicable to both EPC and 5GC
using only 5GC procedures towards UDM. In this case, the SCEF+NEF shall
indicate that the monitoring event is also applicable to EPC (i.e. the event
must be reported both by 5GC and EPC) and may include a SCEF address (i.e. if
the event needs to be configured in a serving node in the EPC and the
corresponding notification needs to be sent directly to the SCEF). If the HSS
and UDM are deployed as separate network entities, UDM shall use HSS services
to configure the monitoring event in EPC as defined in TS 23.632 [102]. The
UDM shall return an indication to SCEF+NEF of whether the configuration of the
monitoring event in EPC was successful. In the case that the UDM reports that
the configuration of a monitoring event was not possible in EPC, then the
SCEF+NEF may configure the monitoring event using EPC procedures via the HSS
as defined in TS 23.682 [36].
NOTE 1: The SCEF+NEF uses only 5GC procedures to configure monitoring events
in EPC and 5GC.
NOTE 2: In terms of the CAPIF, the SCEF+NEF is considered a single node.
#### 5.17.5.2 Support of interworking for Monitoring Events
##### 5.17.5.2.1 Interworking with N26 interface
In addition to the interworking principles documented in clause 5.17.2.2, the
following applies for interworking with N26:
\- When UE moves from EPS to 5GS, when the AMF registers in UDM, if no event
subscription via UDM is available, the AMF indicates the situation to the UDM,
and in this case the UDM can decide if the event subscriptions should be
provisioned, otherwise if the AMF has event subscription information, after
the registration procedure is completed, the AMF may inform the UDM of the
currently subscribed events, and UDM will do synchronization if needed.
\- When UE moves from 5GS to EPS, the MME gets monitoring event configuration
from HSS during as part of mobility procedure as specified in clause
4.11.1.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
##### 5.17.5.2.2 Interworking without N26 interface
In addition to the interworking principles documented in clause 5.17.2.3, the
additional behaviour at EPS to 5GS mobility in clause 5.17.5.2.1 also applies.
When SCEF+NEF performs the procedure of monitoring via the AMF as described in
clause 4.15.3.2.4 (\"Exposure with bulk subscription\") in TS 23.502 [3], if
the AMF determines the interworking without N26 interface is supported, during
mobility from 5GS to EPS, the AMF shall subscribe on behalf of SCEF+NEF for
UDM+HSS notification of MME ID as described in clause 7.1.2 to trigger the
SCEF+NEF to configure the monitoring request to the new MME. For single-
registration mode, when UE\'s mobility from 5GS to EPS happens and Serving MME
sends Update Location Request to the UDM+HSS, the UDM+HSS provides Serving MME
ID to the SCEF+NEF which is the notification endpoint based on the
subscription request from AMF. Then the SCEF+NEF performs the procedure of
configuring monitoring via the MME for the same Monitoring Events as described
in clause 5.6.2.1 of TS 23.682 [36].
When SCEF+NEF performs the procedure of monitoring via the UDM+HSS as
described in clause 4.15.3.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3], when UE\'s mobility between
5GS and EPS happens, the UDM+HSS performs the procedure of configuring
monitoring at the MME as described in clause 5.6.1.1 of TS 23.682 [36] and at
the AMF as described in clause 4.15.3.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3].
#### 5.17.5.3 Availability or expected level of a service API
A service related with common north-bound API may become unavailable due to UE
being served by a CN node not supporting the service. If the availability or
expected level of support of a service API associated with a UE changes, for
example due to a mobility between 5GC and EPC, the AF shall be made aware of
the change.
NOTE 1: If CAPIF is supported and the service APIs become (un)available for
the 5GC or EPC network, the AF obtains such information from the CAPIF core
function.
If the SCEF+NEF receives the subscription request from the AF for the
availability or expected level of support of a service API, the SCEF+NEF
subscribes a CN Type Change event for the UE or Group of UEs to the HSS+UDM.
If the HSS+UDM receives the subscription for CN Type Change event, the HSS+UDM
includes the latest CN type for the UE or Group of UEs in the response for the
subscription. If the HSS+UDM detects that the UE switches between being served
by the MME and the AMF, the CN Type Change event is triggered, and the HSS+UDM
notifies the latest CN type for the UE or Group of UEs to the SCEF+NEF. Based
on the CN type information, the SCEF+NEF can determine the availability or
expected level of support of a given service. The AF will be informed of such
information via a subscription/notification service operation. The AF can
subscribe for the availability or expected level of support of a service API
with report type indicating either One-time report or Continuous report. If
there is no CN type information for the UE in the SCEF+NEF, the SCEF+NEF
subscribes monitoring event for a new CN Type Change event for the UE or Group
of UEs to the HSS+UDM, otherwise, SCEF+NEF determines the CN type locally in
the following conditions:
\- If the AF subscribes with report type indicating One-time report, the
SCEF+NEF may consider the Freshness Timer of the latest CN type information
for the UE or Group of UEs. The Freshness Timer is a parameter that is
configured based on local SCEF+NEF policy. When a subscription request with
One-time report type is received the SCEF+NEF checks if there is the latest CN
type information received from the HSS+UDM for the indicated UE ID or External
Group ID. If the elapsed time for the CN type information since the last
reception is less than the Freshness Timer, then the SCEF+NEF may respond to
the AF with the latest CN type information in order to avoid repeated query to
HSS+UDM.
\- The SCEF+NEF has established a direct connection with MME or AMF or SMF.
When the UE or all members of a Group of UEs are being served by a MME, EPC is
determined as CN type. When the UE or all members of a Group of UEs are being
served by an AMF, 5GC is determined as CN type. When the UE is registered both
in EPC and 5GC, or some members of a Group of UEs are registered in EPC while
some members are registered in 5GC, 5GC+EPC is determined as CN type.
NOTE 2: If 5GC+EPC is determined as the CN type serving the UE or the group of
UEs, the SCEF+NEF determines that service APIs for both 5GC and EPC are
available to the UE or the group of UEs.
### 5.17.6 Void
### 5.17.7 Configuration Transfer Procedure between NG-RAN and E-UTRAN
#### 5.17.7.1 Architecture Principles for Configuration Transfer between NG-
RAN and E-UTRAN
The purpose of the Configuration Transfer between NG-RAN and E-UTRAN is to
enable the transfer the RAN configuration information between the gNB and
eNodeB via MME and AMF.
In order to make the information transparent for the MME and AMF, the
information is included in a transparent container. The source and target RAN
node addresses, which allows the Core Network nodes to route the messages. The
mechanism depicted in Figure 5.17.7.1-1.
Figure 5.17.7.1-1: Configuration Transfer between gNB and E-UTRAN basic
network architecture
The NG-RAN transparent containers are transferred from the source NG-RAN node
to the destination E-UTRAN node and vice versa by use of Configuration
Transfer messages.
An ENB Configuration Transfer message is used from the E-UTRAN node to the MME
over S1 interface as described in TS 36.413 [100], the destination RAN node
includes the en-gNB Identifier and may include a TAI associated with the en-
gNB. If MME is aware that the en-gNB serves cells which provide access to 5GC,
the MME relays the request towards a suitable AMF via inter-system signalling
based on a broadcast 5G TAC. An AMF Configuration Transfer message is used
from the AMF to the NG-RAN over N2 interface.
A Configuration Transfer message is used by the gNB node to the AMF over N2
interface for the reply, and a Configuration Transfer Tunnel message is used
to tunnel the transparent container from AMF to MME over the N26 interface.
MME relays this reply to the target eNB using a MME CONFIGURATION TRANSFER
message. Transport of the RAN containers in E-UTRAN is specified in TS 23.401
[26].
Each Configuration Transfer message carrying the transparent container is
routed and relayed independently by the core network node(s). Any relation
between messages is transparent for the AMF and MME, i.e. a request/response
exchange between applications, for example SON applications, is routed and
relayed as two independent messages by the AMF and MME.
#### 5.17.7.2 Addressing, routing and relaying
##### 5.17.7.2.1 Addressing
All the Configuration Transfer messages contain the addresses of the source
and destination RAN nodes.
An gNB node is addressed by the Target NG-RAN node identifier as described in
TS 38.413 [34].
An eNodeB is addressed by the Target eNodeB identifier as described in TS
36.413 [100].
##### 5.17.7.2.2 Routing
The source RAN node sends a message to its core network node including the
source and destination addresses.
MME uses the destination address to route the message to the correct AMF via
N26 interface. AMF uses the destination address to route the message to the
correct MME via N26 interface.
The AMF connected to the destination RAN node decides which RAN node to send
the message to, based on the destination address.
The MME connected to the destination RAN node decides which RAN node to send
the message to, based on the destination address.
##### 5.17.7.2.3 Relaying
The AMF performs relaying between N2 and N26 messages as described in TS
38.413 [34] and TS 29.274 [101].
The MME performs relaying between S1 and N26 message as described in TS 36.413
[100] and TS 29.274 [101].
## 5.18 Network Sharing
### 5.18.1 General concepts
A network sharing architecture shall allow multiple participating operators to
share resources of a single shared network according to agreed allocation
schemes. The shared network includes a radio access network. The shared
resources include radio resources.
The shared network operator allocates shared resources to the participating
operators based on their planned and current needs and according to service
level agreements.
In this Release of the specification, only the 5G Multi-Operator Core Network
(5G MOCN) network sharing architecture, in which only the RAN is shared in 5G
System, is supported. 5G MOCN for 5G System, including UE, RAN and AMF, shall
support operators\' ability to use more than one PLMN ID (i.e. with same or
different country code (MCC) some of which is specified in TS 23.122 [17] and
different network codes (MNC)) or combinations of PLMN ID and NID. 5G MOCN
supports NG-RAN Sharing with or without multiple Cell Identity broadcast as
described in TS 38.300 [27].
5G MOCN also supports the following sharing scenarios involving non-public
networks, i.e.NG-RAN can be shared by any combination of PLMNs, PNI-NPNs (with
CAG), and SNPNs (each identified by PLMN ID and NID).
NOTE 1: PNI-NPNs (without CAG) are not explicitly listed above as it does not
require additional NG-RAN sharing functionality compared to sharing by one or
multiple PLMNs.
In all non-public network sharing scenarios, each Cell Identity as specified
in TS 38.331 [28] is associated with one of the following configuration
options:
\- one or multiple SNPNs;
\- one or multiple PNI-NPNs (with CAG); or
\- one or multiple PLMNs only.
NOTE 2: This allows the assignment of multiple cell identities to a cell and
also allows the cell identities to be independently assigned, i.e. without
need for coordination, by the network sharing partners, between PLMNs and/or
non-public networks.
NOTE 3: Different PLMN IDs (or combinations of PLMN ID and NID) can also point
to the same 5GC. When same 5GC supports multiple SNPNs (identified by PLMN ID
and NID), then they are not used as equivalent SNPNs for a UE.
NOTE 4: There is no standardized mechanism to avoid paging collisions if the
same 5G-S-TMSI is allocated to different UEs by different PLMNs or SNPNs of
the shared network, as the risk of paging collision is assumed to be very low.
If such risk is to be eliminated then PLMNs and SNPNs of the shared network
needs to coordinate the value space of the 5G-S-TMSI to differentiate the
PLMNs and SNPNs of the shared network.
Figure 5.18.1-1: A 5G Multi-Operator Core Network (5G MOCN) in which multiple
CNs are\ connected to the same NG-RAN
### 5.18.2 Broadcast system information for network sharing
If a shared NG-RAN is configured to indicate available networks (PLMNs and/or
SNPNs) for selection by UEs, each cell in the shared radio access network
shall in the broadcast system information include available core network
operators in the shared network.
The Broadcast System Information broadcasts a set of PLMN IDs and/or PLMN IDs
and NIDs and one or more additional set of parameters per PLMN e.g. cell-ID,
Tracking Areas, CAG Identifiers. All 5G System capable UEs that connect to NG-
RAN support reception of multiple PLMN IDs and per PLMN specific parameters.
All SNPN-enabled UEs support reception of multiple combinations of PLMN ID and
NID and SNPN-specific parameters.
The available core network operators (PLMNs and/or SNPNs) shall be the same
for all cells of a Tracking Area in a shared NG-RAN network.
UEs not set to operate in SNPN access mode decode the broadcast system
information and take the information concerning available PLMN IDs into
account in PLMN and cell (re-)selection procedures. UEs set to operate in SNPN
access mode decode the broadcast system information and take the information
concerning available PLMN IDs and NIDs into account in network and cell
(re-)selection procedures. Broadcast system information is specified in TS
38.331 [28] for NR, TS 36.331 [51] for E-UTRA and related UE access stratum
idle mode procedures in TS 38.304 [50] for NR and TS 36.304 [52] for E-UTRA.
### 5.18.2a PLMN list handling for network sharing
The AMF prepares lists of PLMN IDs suitable as target PLMNs for use at idle
mode cell (re)selection and for use at handover and RRC Connection Release
with redirection. The AMF:
\- provides the UE with the list of PLMNs that the UE shall consider as
Equivalent to the serving PLMN (see TS 23.122 [17]); and
\- provides the NG-RAN with a prioritised list of permitted PLMNs. When
prioritising these PLMNs, the AMF may consider the following information:
HPLMN of the UE, the serving PLMN, a preferred target PLMN (e.g. based on last
used EPS PLMN), or the policies of the operator(s).
For a UE registered in an SNPN, the AMF shall not provide a list of equivalent
PLMNs to the UE and shall not provide a list of permitted PLMNs to NG-RAN.
### 5.18.3 Network selection by the UE
NOTE: This clause applies to UEs not operating in SNPN access mode. Network
selection for UEs set to operate in SNPN access mode is described in clause
5.30.2.4.
A UE that has a subscription to one of the sharing core network operators
shall be able to select this core network operator while within the coverage
area of the shared network and to receive subscribed services from that core
network operator.
Each cell in shared NG-RAN shall in the broadcast system information include
the PLMN-IDs concerning available core network operators in the shared
network.
When a UE performs an Initial Registration to a network, one of available
PLMNs shall be selected to serve the UE. UE uses all the received broadcast
PLMN-IDs in its PLMN (re)selection processes which is specified in TS 23.122
[17]. UE shall inform the NG-RAN of the selected PLMN so that the NG-RAN can
route correctly. The NG-RAN shall inform the core network of the selected
PLMN.
As per any network, after Initial Registration to the shared network and while
remaining served by the shared network, the network selection procedures
specified in TS 23.122 [17] may cause the UE to perform a reselection of
another available PLMN.
UE uses all of the received broadcast PLMN-IDs in its cell and PLMN
(re)selection processes.
### 5.18.4 Network selection by the network
The NG-RAN uses the selected PLMN (provided by the UE at RRC establishment,
or, provided by the AMF/source NG-RAN at N2/Xn handover) to select target
cells for future handovers (and radio resources in general) appropriately. The
network should not move the UE to another available PLMN, e.g. by handover, as
long as the selected PLMN is available to serve the UE\'s location.
In the case of handover or network controlled release to a shared network:
\- When multiple PLMN IDs are broadcasted in a cell selected by NG-RAN, NG-RAN
shall select a target PLMN, taking into account the prioritized list of PLMN
IDs provided via Mobility Restriction List from AMF.
\- For Xn based HO procedure, Source NG-RAN indicates the selected PLMN ID to
the target NG-RAN, see TS 38.300 [27].
\- For N2 based HO procedure, the NG-RAN indicates a selected PLMN ID to the
AMF as part of the TAI sent in the HO required message. Source AMF uses the
TAI information supplied by the source NG-RAN to select the target AMF/MME.
The source AMF should forward the selected PLMN ID to the target AMF/MME. The
target AMF/MME indicates the selected PLMN ID to the target NG-RAN/eNB so that
the target NG-RAN/eNB can select target cells for future handover
appropriately.
\- For RRC connection release with redirection to E-UTRAN procedure, NG-RAN
decides the target network by using PLMN information as defined in the first
bullet.
A change in serving PLMN is indicated to the UE as part of the UE registration
with the selected network via 5G-GUTI in 5GS.
### 5.18.5 Network Sharing and Network Slicing
As defined in clause 5.15.1, a Network Slice is defined within a PLMN or SNPN.
Network sharing is performed among different PLMNs and/or SNPNs. In the case
of network sharing, each PLMN or SNPN sharing the NG-RAN defines and supports
its PLMN- or SNPN- specific set of slices that are supported by the common NG-
RAN.
## 5.19 Control Plane Load Control, Congestion and Overload Control
### 5.19.1 General
In order to ensure that the network functions within 5G System are operating
under nominal capacity for providing connectivity and necessary services to
the UE. Thus, it supports various measures to guard itself under various
operating conditions (e.g. peak operating hour, extreme situations). It
includes support for load (re-)balancing, overload control and NAS level
congestion control. A 5GC NF is considered to be in overload when it is
operating over its nominal capacity resulting in diminished performance
(including impacts to handling of incoming and outgoing traffic).
### 5.19.2 TNLA Load Balancing and TNLA Load Re-Balancing
AMF can support load balancing and re-balancing of TNL associations between
5G-AN and AMF by using mechanisms specified in clause 5.21.1.
### 5.19.3 AMF Load Balancing
The AMF Load Balancing functionality permits UEs that are entering into an AMF
Region/AMF Set to be directed to an appropriate AMF in a manner that achieves
load balancing between AMFs. This is achieved by setting a Weight Factor for
each AMF, such that the probability of the 5G-AN selecting an AMF is
proportional to Weight Factor of the AMF. The Weight Factor is typically set
according to the capacity of an AMF node relative to other AMF nodes. The
Weight Factor is sent from the AMF to the 5G-AN via NGAP messages (see TS
38.413 [34]).
NOTE 1: An operator may decide to change the Weight Factor after the
establishment of NGAP connectivity as a result of changes in the AMF
capacities. e.g. a newly installed AMF may be given a very much higher Weight
Factor for an initial period of time making it faster to increase its load.
NOTE 2: It is intended that the Weight Factor is NOT changed frequently. e.g.
in a mature network, changes on a monthly basis could be anticipated, e.g. due
to the addition of 5G-AN or 5GC nodes.
NOTE 3: Weight Factors for AMF Load Balancing are associated with AMF Names.
Load balancing by 5G-AN node is only performed between AMFs that belong to the
same AMF set, i.e. AMFs with the same PLMN, AMF Region ID and AMF Set ID
value.
The 5G-AN node may have their Load Balancing parameters adjusted (e.g. the
Weight Factor is set to zero if all subscribers are to be removed from the
AMF, which will route new entrants to other AMFs within an AMF Set).
### 5.19.4 AMF Load Re-Balancing
The AMF load re-balancing functionality permits cross-section of its
subscribers that are registered on an AMF (within an AMF Set) to be moved to
another AMF within the same AMF set with minimal impacts on the network and
end users. AMF may request some or all of the 5G-AN node(s) to redirect a
cross-section of UE(s) returning from CM-IDLE state to be redirected to
another AMF within the same AMF set, if the 5G-AN is configured to support
this. The AMF may request some or all of the 5G-AN node(s) to redirect the UEs
served by one of its GUAMI(s) to a specific target AMF within the same AMF set
or to any different AMF within the same AMF set.
When indicating a specific target AMF, the AMF should ensure that the load re-
balancing will not cause overload in the target AMF.
NOTE: This requirement can be fulfilled by the AMF itself or by the OAM.
For UE(s) in CM-IDLE state, when UE subsequently returns from CM-IDLE state
and the 5G-AN receives an initial NAS message with a 5G S-TMSI or GUAMI
pointing to an AMF that requested for redirection, the 5G-AN should select the
specific target AMF (provided by the original AMF) or a different AMF from the
same AMF set and forward the initial NAS message.
For UE(s) in CONNECTED mode, similar mechanisms for AMF Management can be used
to move the UE to another AMF in the same AMF set as described in clause
5.21.2, except that the old AMF deregisters itself from NRF.
The newly selected/target AMF (which is now the serving AMF) will re-assign
the GUTI (using its own GUAMI(s)) to the UE(s). It is not expected that the
5G-AN node rejects any request or enables access control restriction when it
receives a request for redirection for load control from the connected AMF(s).
When the AMF wants to stop redirection, the AMF can indicate that it can serve
all UE(s) in CM-IDLE state to stop the redirection.
NOTE 1: An example use for the AMF load re-balancing functionality is for the
AMF to pro-actively re-balance its load prior to reaching overload i.e. to
prevent overload situation.
NOTE 2: Typically, AMF Load Re-Balancing is not needed when the AMF becomes
overloaded because the Load Balancing function should have ensured that the
other AMFs within the AMF Set are similarly overloaded.
### 5.19.5 AMF Control Of Overload
#### 5.19.5.1 General
The AMF shall contain mechanisms for avoiding and handling overload
situations. This includes the following measures:
\- N2 overload control that could result in RRC reject, RRC Connection Release
and unified access barring.
\- NAS congestion control.
#### 5.19.5.2 AMF Overload Control
Under unusual circumstances, if AMF has reached overload situation, the AMF
activates NAS level congestion control as specified in Clause 5.19.7 and AMF
restricts the load that the 5G-AN node(s) are generating, if the 5G-AN is
configured to support overload control. N2 overload control can be achieved by
the AMF invoking the N2 overload procedure (see TS 38.300 [27] and TS 38.413
[34]) to all or to a proportion of the 5G-AN nodes with which the AMF has N2
connections. The AMF may include the S-NSSAI(s) in NGAP OVERLOAD START message
sent to 5G-AN node(s) to indicate the Network Slice(s) with which NAS
signalling is to be restricted. To reflect the amount of load that the AMF
wishes to reduce, the AMF can adjust the proportion of 5G-AN nodes which are
sent NGAP OVERLOAD START message, and the content of the overload start
procedure.
When NGAP OVERLOAD START is sent by multiple AMFs or from the same AMF set in
the same PLMN towards the 5G-AN, it should be ensured that the signalling load
is evenly distributed within the PLMN and within each AMF set.
A 5G-AN node supports restricting of 5G-AN signalling connection when a
signalling connection establishment are attempted by certain UEs (which are
registered or attempting to register with the 5GC), as specified in TS 38.331
[28] and TS 36.331 [51]. Additionally, a 5G-AN node provides support for the
barring of UEs as described in TS 22.261 [2]. These mechanisms are further
specified in TS 38.331 [28] and TS 36.331 [51]. For 3GPP Access Type, the
signalling connection establishment attempt includes a RRC Connection Resume
procedure from RRC-Inactive.
By sending the NGAP OVERLOAD START message, the AMF can request the 5G-AN node
to apply the following behaviour for UEs that the AMF is serving:
a) Restrict 5G-AN signalling connection requests that are not for emergency,
not for exception reporting and not for high priority mobile originated
services; or
b) Restrict 5G-AN signalling connection requests for uplink NAS signalling
transmission to that AMF;
c) Restrict 5G-AN signalling connection requests where the Requested NSSAI at
AS layer only includes the indicated S-NSSAI(s) in the NGAP OVERLOAD START
message. This applies also to RRC-Inactive Connection Resume procedure where
the Allowed NSSAI in the stored UE context in the RAN only includes S-NSSAIs
included in the NGAP OVERLOAD START.
d) only permit 5G-AN signalling connection requests for emergency sessions and
mobile terminated services for that AMF; or
e) only permit 5G-AN signalling connection requests for high priority
sessions, exception reporting and mobile terminated services for that AMF;
The above applies for RRC Connection Establishment procedure and RRC
Connection Resume procedures over 3GPP access, as well as for the UE-N3IWF
connection establishment over untrusted Non-3GPP access and for the UE-TNGF
connection establishment over trusted Non-3GPP access.
The AMF can provide a value that indicates the percentage of connection
requests to be restricted in the NGAP OVERLOAD START, and the 5G-AN node may
consider this value for congestion control.
When restricting a 5G-AN signalling connection, the 5G-AN indicates to the UE
an appropriate wait timer that limits further 5G-AN signalling connection
requests until the wait timer expires.
During an overload situation, the AMF should attempt to maintain support for
emergency services and for MPS.
When the AMF is recovering, the AMF can either:
\- send a NGAP OVERLOAD START message with a new percentage value that permits
more connection requests to be successful, or
\- send a NGAP OVERLOAD STOP message.
to the same 5G-AN node(s) the NGAP OVERLOAD START was previously sent.
### 5.19.6 SMF Overload Control
The SMF shall contain mechanisms for avoiding and handling overload
situations. This can include the following measures:
\- SMF overload control that could result in rejections of NAS requests.
The SMF overload control may be activated by SMF due to congestion situation
at SMF e.g. configuration, by a restart or recovery condition of a UPF, or by
a partial failure or recovery of a UPF for a particular UPF(s).
Under unusual circumstances, if the SMF has reached overload situation, the
SMF activates NAS level congestion control as specified in clause 5.19.7. The
SMF may restrict the load that the AMF(s) are generating, if the AMF is
configured to enable the overload restriction.
### 5.19.7 NAS level congestion control
#### 5.19.7.1 General
NAS level congestion control may be applied in general (i.e. for all NAS
messages), per DNN, per S-NSSAI, per DNN and S-NSSAI, or for a specific group
of UEs.
NAS level congestion control is achieved by providing the UE a back-off time.
To avoid that large amounts of UEs initiate deferred requests (almost)
simultaneously, the 5GC should select each back-off time value so that the
deferred requests are not synchronized. When the UE receives a back-off time,
the UE shall not initiate any NAS signalling with regards to the applied
congestion control until the back-off timer expires or the UE receives a
mobile terminated request from the network, or the UE initiates signalling for
emergency services or high priority access.
AMFs and SMFs may apply NAS level congestion control, but should not apply NAS
level congestion control for procedures not subject to congestion control.
#### 5.19.7.2 General NAS level congestion control
This clause only applies to NAS Mobility Management congestion control.
Under general overload conditions the AMF may reject NAS messages from UEs
using any 5G-AN. When a NAS request is rejected, a Mobility Management back-
off time may be sent by the AMF to the UE. While the Mobility Management back-
off timer is running, the UE shall not initiate any NAS request except for
Deregistration procedure and procedures not subject to congestion control
(e.g. high priority access, emergency services) and mobile terminated
services. After any such Deregistration procedure, the back-off timer
continues to run. While the Mobility Management back-off timer is running, the
UE is allowed to perform Mobility Registration Update if the UE is already in
CM-CONNECTED state. If the UE receives a paging request or a NAS notification
message from the AMF while the Mobility Management back off timer is running,
the UE shall stop the Mobility Management back-off timer and initiate the
Service Request procedure or the Mobility Registration Update procedure over
3GPP access and/or non-3GPP access as applicable. Over non-3GPP access, if the
UE is in CM-IDLE state when the back-off timer is stopped, it shall initiate
the UE-triggered Service Request procedure as soon as it switches back to CM-
CONNECTED state.
In order to allow the UE to report the PS Data Off status change in PDU
Session Modification Request message, the UE behaves as follows while keeping
the NAS MM back-off timer running in the UE:
\- When the UE is in CM-IDLE state and has not moved out of the Registration
Area, the UE is allowed to send a Service Request message with an indication
that the message is exempted from NAS congestion control. When the UE is in
CM-IDLE mode and has moved out of the Registration Area, the UE is allowed to
send a Mobility Registration Update request message, with a Follow-on request,
and with an indication that the message is exempted from NAS congestion
control.
\- When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the UE sends a PDU Session
Modification Request with PS Data Off status change carried in UL NAS
Transport message with an indication that the message is exempted from NAS
congestion control.
When the NAS MM congestion control is activated at AMF, if the UE indicates
that the NAS MM message is exempted from NAS congestion control, the AMF shall
not reject the NAS MM message and shall forward the NAS SM message to the
corresponding SMF with an indication that the NAS SM message was indicated to
be exempted from NAS congestion control. The SMF ensures that the NAS SM
message is not subject to congestion control otherwise the SMF rejects the
message, e.g. the SMF shall reject PDU Session Modification received if it is
not for Data Off status reporting.
The Mobility Management back-off timer shall not impact Cell/RAT/Access Type
and PLMN change. Cell/RAT/TA/Access Type change does not stop the Mobility
Management back-off timer. The Mobility Management back-off timer shall not be
a trigger for PLMN reselection. The back-off timer is stopped as defined in TS
24.501 [47] when a new PLMN that is not an equivalent PLMN is accessed.
To avoid that large amounts of UEs initiate deferred requests (almost)
simultaneously, the AMF should select the Mobility Management back-off timer
value so that the deferred requests are not synchronized.
If the UE required to report 5GSM Core Network Capability change, or the
Always-on PDU Session Requested indication while the NAS MM congestion control
timer was running and was unable to initiate MM signalling, the UE defers the
related MM signalling until the MM congestion control timer expires and
initiates after the expiry of the timer.
In the case of a UE with scheduled communication pattern, the AMF may consider
the UE\'s communication pattern while selecting a value for the Mobility
Management back-off timer so that the UE does not miss its only scheduled
communication window.
The AMF should not reject Registration Request message for Mobility
Registration Update that are performed when the UE is already in CM-CONNECTED
state.
The AMF may reject the Service Request message and a UL NAS Transfer with a
Mobility Management back-off time when the UE is already in CM-CONNECTED
state. If UE receives a DL NAS Transfer message from the AMF while the
Mobility Management back off timer is running, the UE shall stop the Mobility
Management back-off timer.
For CM-IDLE state mobility, the AMF may reject Registration Request messages
for Mobility Registration Update by including a Mobility Management back off
time value in the Registration Reject message.
If UE registered in the same PLMN for 3GPP access and non-3GPP access and
receives a Mobility Management back-off time from the AMF, the back-off time
(and corresponding start and stop) is applied equally to both 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access. If UE registered in different PLMNs for 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access respectively and receives a Mobility Management back-off time,
the back-off time is only applied to the PLMN that provides the time to the
UE.
If the AMF rejects Registration Request messages or Service Request with a
Mobility Management back-off time which is larger than the sum of the UE\'s
Periodic Registration Update timer and the Implicit Deregistration timer, the
AMF should adjust the mobile reachable timer and/or Implicit Deregistration
timer such that the AMF does not implicitly deregister the UE while the
Mobility Management back-off timer is running.
NOTE: This is to minimize signalling after the Mobility Management back-off
timer expires.
If the AMF deregisters the UE with an indication of re-registration required,
the UE behaviour for handling the back-off timer(s) is as specified in TS
24.501 [47].
#### 5.19.7.3 DNN based congestion control
DNN based congestion control is designed for the purpose of avoiding and
handling of NAS SM signalling congestion for the UEs with a back-off timer
associated with or without a DNN regardless of the presence of an S-NSSAI.
Both UE and 5GC shall support the functionality to enable DNN based congestion
control.
SMFs may apply DNN based congestion control towards the UE by rejecting PDU
Session Establishment Request message, or PDU Session Modification Request
message except for those sent for the purpose of reporting 3GPP PS Data Off
status change for a specific DNN with a running back-off timer. The SMF may
release PDU Sessions belonging to a congested DNN by sending a PDU Session
Release Command message towards the UE with a DNN back-off timer. If a DNN
back-off time is set in the PDU Session Release Command message, the cause
value of \"reactivation requested\" shall not be set.
If NWDAF is deployed, the SMF may make use of Session Management Congestion
Control Experience analytics provided by NWDAF, as defined in clause 6.12 of
TS 23.288 [86], to determine back-off timer provided to UEs.
NOTE: For example, the SMF can apply a short back-off timer to the UEs in the
list of high-experienced UEs while the SMF can apply a long back-off timer to
the UEs in the list of low-experienced UEs.
When DNN based congestion control is activated at AMF e.g. configured by OAM,
the AMF provides a NAS Transport Error message for the NAS Transport message
carrying an SM message, and in the NAS Transport Error message it includes a
DNN back-off timer.
The UE associates the received back-off time with the DNN (i.e. no DNN, DNN
only) which the UE included in the uplink NAS MM message carrying the
corresponding NAS SM request message.
The UE associates the received back-off time with the DNN (i.e. no DNN, DNN
only) in any PLMN unless the DNN associated with the back-off timer is an LADN
DNN in which case the UE only associates it to the PLMN in which the back-off
time was received.
The UE behaves as follows when the DNN back-off timer is running:
\- If a DNN is associated with the back-off timer, the UE shall not initiate
any Session Management procedures for the congested DNN. The UE may initiate
Session Management procedures for other DNNs. The UE shall not initiate any
Session Management procedure for the corresponding APN when UE moves to EPS.
The UE may initiate Session Management procedures for other APNs when the UE
moves to EPS;
\- If no DNN is associated with the back-off timer, the UE may only initiate
Session Management requests of any PDU Session Type for a specific DNN;
\- Upon Cell/TA/PLMN/RAT change, change of untrusted non-3GPP access network
or change of Access Type, the UE shall not stop the back-off timer;
\- The UE is allowed to initiate the Session Management procedures for high
priority access and emergency services;
\- The UE is allowed to initiate the Session Management procedure for
reporting Data Off status change to the network;
\- If the UE receives a network initiated Session Management message other
than PDU Session Release Command for the congested DNN associated to a running
back-off timer, the UE shall stop the back-off timer and respond to the 5GC;
\- If the UE receives a PDU Session Release Command message for the congested
DNN, it shall stop the back-off timer unless it receives a new back-off time
from SMF;
\- The UE is allowed to initiate PDU Session Release procedure (i.e. sending
PDU Session Release Request message). The UE shall not stop the back-off timer
when the related PDU Session is released;
\- The list above is not an exhaustive list, i.e. more details of the above
actions and further conditions, if any, are specified in TS 24.501 [47].
If UE initiates one of the Session Management procedures that are exempted
from NAS congestion control, the UE indicates that the carried NAS SM message
is exempted from NAS congestion control in the UL NAS Transport message as
described in TS 24.501 [47]. When the DNN based congestion control is
activated at AMF, if the UE indicates that the NAS SM message in the UL NAS
Transport message is exempted from NAS congestion control, the AMF shall not
apply DNN based congestion control on the UL NAS Transport message and shall
forward the NAS SM message to the corresponding SMF with an indication that
the message was received with exemption indication. The SMF evaluates whether
the NAS SM message is allowed to be exempted from DNN based congestion
control. If it is not, the SMF rejects the message, e.g. the SMF shall reject
PDU Session Modification received if it is not for Data Off status reporting).
The UE shall maintain a separate back-off timer for each DNN that the UE may
use.
To avoid that large amounts of UEs initiate deferred requests (almost)
simultaneously, the 5GC should select the back-off timer value so that
deferred requests are not synchronized.
If the UE required to report 5GSM Core Network Capability change, or the
Always-on PDU Session Requested indication while DNN based congestion control
was running and was unable to initiate SM signalling, the UE defers the
related SM signalling until the DNN based congestion control timer expires and
initiates the necessary SM signalling after the expiry of the timer.
The DNN based Session Management congestion control is applicable to the NAS
SM signalling initiated from the UE in the Control Plane. The Session
Management congestion control does not prevent the UE from sending and
receiving data or initiating Service Request procedures for activating User
Plane connection towards the DNN(s) that are under Session Management
congestion control.
#### 5.19.7.4 S-NSSAI based congestion control
S-NSSAI based congestion control is designed for the purpose of avoiding and
handling of NAS signalling congestion for the UEs with back-off timer
associated with or without an S-NSSAI regardless of the presence of a DNN.
The UE associates the received back-off time with the S-NSSAI and DNN (i.e. no
S-NSSAI and no DNN, no S-NSSAI, S-NSSAI only, an S-NSSAI and a DNN) which was
included in the uplink NAS MM message carrying the corresponding NAS SM
request message for the PLMN which is under congestion.
S-NSSAI based congestion control is applied as follows:
\- If an S-NSSAI is determined as congested, then the SMF may apply S-NSSAI
based congestion control towards the UE for SM requests except for those sent
for the purpose of reporting 3GPP PS Data Off status change for a specific
S-NSSAI and provides a back-off time and an indication of HPLMN congestion;
\- If the UE receives an S-NSSAI based back-off time without an indication of
HPLMN congestion, the UE shall apply the S-NSSAI back-off timer only in the
PLMN in which the back-off time was received. If the UE receives S-NSSAI based
back-off time with an indication of HPLMN congestion, the UE shall apply the
S-NSSAI based back-off timer in the PLMN in which the back-off time was
received and in any other PLMN;
\- The SMF may release PDU Sessions belonging to a congested S-NSSAI by
sending a PDU Session Release Request message towards the UE with a back-off
time associated either to the S-NSSAI only (i.e. with no specific DNN) or a
combination of the S-NSSAI and a specific DNN. If NWDAF is deployed, the SMF
may make use of Session Management Congestion Control Experience analytics
provided by NWDAF, as defined in clause 6.12 of TS 23.288 [86], to determine
back-off timer provided to UEs;
NOTE: For example, the SMF can apply a short back-off timer to the UEs in the
list of high-experienced UEs while the SMF can apply a long back-off timer to
the UEs in the list of low-experienced UEs.
\- If S-NSSAI based congestion control is activated at AMF e.g. configured by
OAM and an S-NSSAI is determined as congested, then the AMF applies S-NSSAI
based congestion control towards the UE for UE-initiated Session Management
requests. In this case, the AMF provides a NAS Transport Error message for the
NAS Transport message carrying the SM message, and in the NAS Transport Error
message it includes a back-off timer; If NWDAF is deployed, the AMF may
determine that S-NSSAI is congested based on the network slice load level
analytics defined in TS 23.288 [86].
\- The UE behaves as follows in the PLMN where the S-NSSAI based congestion
control applies when the back-off timer is running:
\- If the back-off timer was associated with an S-NSSAI only (i.e. not
associated with an S-NSSAI and a DNN), the UE shall not initiate any Session
Management procedures for the congested S-NSSAI;
\- If the back-off timer was associated with an S-NSSAI and a DNN, then the UE
shall not initiate any Session Management procedures for that combination of
S-NSSAI and DNN;
\- If the UE receives a network-initiated Session Management message other
than PDU Session Release Command for the congested S-NSSAI, the UE shall stop
this back-off timer and respond to the 5GC;
\- If the UE receives a PDU Session Release Command message for the congested
S-NSSAI, it shall stop the back-off timer unless it receives a new back-off
time from SMF;
\- Upon Cell/TA/PLMN/RAT change, change of untrusted non-3GPP access network
or change of Access Type, the UE shall not stop the back-off timer for any
S-NSSAI or any combination of S-NSSAI and DNN;
\- The UE is allowed to initiate the Session Management procedures for high
priority access and emergency services for the S-NSSAI;
\- The UE is allowed to initiate the Session Management procedure for
reporting Data Off status change for the S-NSSAI or the combination of S-NSSAI
and DNN.
\- If the back-off timer is not associated to any S-NSSAI, the UE may only
initiate Session Management procedures for specific S-NSSAI;
\- If the back-off timer is not associated to any S-NSSAI and DNN, the UE may
only initiate Session Management procedures for specific S-NSSAI and DNN;
\- The UE is allowed to initiate PDU Session Release procedure (e.g. sending
PDU Session Release Request message). The UE shall not stop the back-off timer
when the related PDU Session is released;
\- The list above is not an exhaustive list, i.e. more details of the above
actions and further conditions, if any, are specified in TS 24.501 [47].
The UE shall maintain a separate back-off timer for each S-NSSAI and for each
combination of S-NSSAI and DNN that the UE may use.
If UE initiates one of the Session Management procedure that are exempt from
NAS congestion control, the UE indicates that the carried NAS SM message is
exempted from NAS congestion control in the UL NAS Transport message as
described in TS 24.501 [47]. When the S-NSSAI based congestion control is
activated at AMF, if the UE indicates that the NAS SM message in the UL NAS
Transport message is exempted from NAS congestion control, the AMF shall not
apply S-NSSAI based congestion control on the UL NAS Transport message and
shall forward the NAS SM message to the corresponding SMF with an indication
that the message was received with exemption indication. The SMF evaluates
whether that the NAS SM message is allowed to be exempted from S-NSSAI based
congestion control. If it is not, the SMF rejects the message, e.g. the SMF
shall reject PDU Session Modification received if it is not for Data Off
status reporting.
The back-off timer associated with an S-NSSAI or a combination of an S-NSSAI
and a DNN shall only apply to congestion control for Session Management
procedures when UE is in 5GS.
To avoid that large amounts of UEs initiate deferred requests (almost)
simultaneously, the 5GC should select the value of the back-off timer for the
S-NSSAI based congestion control so that deferred requests are not
synchronized.
If the UE required to report 5GSM Core Network Capability change, or the
Always-on PDU Session Requested indication while S-NSSAI based congestion
control timer was running and was unable to initiate SM signalling, the UE
defers the related SM signalling until the S-NSSAI based congestion control
timer expires and initiates the necessary SM signalling after the expiry of
the timer.
The S-NSSAI based congestion control does not prevent the UE from sending and
receiving data or initiating Service Request procedure for activating User
Plane connection for a PDU Session associated to the S-NSSAI that is under the
congestion control.
#### 5.19.7.5 Group specific NAS level congestion control
The group specific NAS level congestion control applies to a specific group of
UEs. Group specific NAS level congestion control is performed at the 5GC only,
and it is transparent to UE. The AMF or SMF or both may apply NAS level
congestion control for a UE associated to an Internal-Group Identifier (see
clause 5.9.7).
NOTE: 5GC logic for Group specific NAS level congestion control is not
described in this Release of the specification.
#### 5.19.7.6 Control Plane data specific NAS level congestion control
Under overload conditions the AMF may restrict requests from UEs for data
transmission via Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation. A Control Plane data
back-off timer may be returned by the AMF (e.g. in Registration Accept
messages, Service Reject message or Service Accept message). While the Control
Plane data back-off timer is running, the UE shall not initiate any data
transfer via Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, i.e. the UE shall not send
any Control Plane Service Request with uplink data as defined in TS 24.501
[47]. The AMF shall store the Control Plane data back-off timer per UE and
shall not process any further requests (other than exception reporting and a
response to paging) for Data Transport via a Control Plane Service Request
from that UE while the Control Plane data back-off timer is still running.
NOTE 1: The Control Plane data back-off timer does not affect any other
mobility management or session management procedure.
NOTE 2: The Control Plane data back-off timer does not apply to user plane
data communication.
If the UE is allowed to send exception reporting, the UE may send an initial
NAS Message for exception reporting even if Control Plane data back-off timer
is running.
The UE may respond to paging with an initial NAS Message without uplink data
even if the Control Plane data back-off timer is running.
If the AMF receives an initial NAS Message in reponse to a paging, and the AMF
has a Control Plane data back-off timer running for the UE, and the AMF is not
overloaded, and AMF decides to accept the Control Plane Service Request, then
the AMF shall respond with Service Accept without the Control Plane data back-
off timer and stop the Control Plane data back-off timer. If the UE receives a
Service Accept without the Control Plane data back-off timer from the AMF
while the Control Plane data back-off timer is running, the UE shall stop the
Control Plane data back-off timer. The Control Plane data back-off timer in
the UE and the AMF is stopped at PLMN change.
If the AMF receives a Control Plane Service Request with uplink data, and
decides to send the UE a Control Plane data back-off timer, the AMF may decide
to process the Control Plane Service Request with uplink data, i.e. decrypt
and forward the data payload, or not based on the following:
\- If the UE has indicated Release Assistance Information that no further
Uplink and Downlink Data transmissions are expected, then the AMF may process
(integrity check/decipher/forward) the received Control Plane data packet, and
send a Service Accept to the UE with Control Plane data back-off timer. The UE
interprets this as successful transmission of the Control Plane data packet
starts the Control Plane data back-off timer.
\- For all other cases, the AMF may decide to not process the received Control
Plane data packet and send a Service Reject to the UE with Control Plane data
back-off timer. The UE interprets this indication as unsuccessful delivery of
the control plane data packet and starts the Control Plane data back-off
timer. The AMF may take into consideration whether the PDU Session is set to
Control Plane only to make the decision whether to reject the packet and send
Service Reject or move the PDU Session to user plane and process the data
packet as described in next bullet.
\- Alternatively, if UE has not provided Release Assistance Information, and
the PDU Session not set to Control Plane only, and UE supports N3 data
transfer, then the AMF may initiate establishment of N3 bearer according to
the procedure defined in clause 4.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. In this case the AMF
may also return a Control Plane data back-off timer within the Service Accept.
The AMF only includes the Control Plane data back-off timer if the UE has
indicated support for Control Plane CIoT 5GS optimizations in the Registration
Request.
## 5.20 External Exposure of Network Capability
The Network Exposure Function (NEF) supports external exposure of capabilities
of network functions. External exposure can be categorized as Monitoring
capability, Provisioning capability, Policy/Charging capability and Analytics
reporting capability. The Monitoring capability is for monitoring of specific
event for UE in 5G System and making such monitoring events information
available for external exposure via the NEF. The Provisioning capability is
for allowing external party to provision of information which can be used for
the UE in 5G System. The Policy/Charging capability is for handling access and
mobility management, QoS and charging policies for the UE based on the request
from external party. The Analytics reporting capability is for allowing an
external party to fetch or subscribe/unsubscribe to analytics information
generated by 5G System (this is further defined in TS 23.288 [86]).
Monitoring capability is comprised of means that allow the identification of
the 5G network function suitable for configuring the specific monitoring
events, detect the monitoring event, and report the monitoring event to the
authorised external party. Monitoring capability can be used for exposing
UE\'s mobility management context such as UE location, reachability, roaming
status, and loss of connectivity. AMF stores URRP-AMF information in the MM
context to determine the NFs that are authorised to receive direct
notifications from the AMF. UDM stores URRP-AMF information locally to
determine authorised monitoring requests when forwarding indirect
notifications.
Provisioning capability allows an external party to provision the Expected UE
Behaviour or the 5G-VN group information or ECS Address Configuration
Information or service specific information to 5G NF via the NEF. The
provisioning comprises of the authorisation of the provisioning external third
party, receiving the provisioned external information via the NEF, storing the
information, and distributing that information among those NFs that use it.
The externally provisioned data can be consumed by different NFs, depending on
the data. In the case of provisioning the Expected UE Behaviour, the
externally provisioned information which is defined as the Expected UE
Behaviour parameters in clause 4.15.6.3 of TS 23.502 [3] or Network Control
parameter in clause 4.15.6.3a of TS 23.502 [3] consists of information on
expected UE movement, Expected UE Behaviour parameters or expected Network
Configuration parameter. The provisioned Expected UE Behaviour parameters may
be used for the setting of mobility management or session management
parameters of the UE. In the case of provisioning the 5G-VN group information
the externally provisioned information is defined as the 5G-VN group
parameters in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [3] and it consists of some
information on the 5G-VN group. In the case of provisioning ECS address, the
externally provisioned information is defined as the ECS Address Configuration
Information in clause 4.15.6.3d of TS 23.502 [3]. The affected NFs are
informed via the subscriber data update as specified in clause 4.15.6.2 of TS
23.502 [3]. The externally provisioned information which is defined as the
Service Parameters in clause 4.15.6.7 of TS 23.502 [3] consists of service
specific information used for supporting the specific service in 5G system.
The provisioned Service Parameters may be delivered to the UEs. The affected
NFs are informed of the data update.
Policy/Charging capability is comprised of means that allow the request for
session and charging policy, enforce QoS policy, apply accounting
functionality and requests to influence access and mobility management
policies. It can be used for specific QoS/priority handling for the session of
the UE, and for setting applicable charging party or charging rate.
Analytics reporting capability is comprised of means that allow discovery of
type of analytics that can be consumed by external party, the request for
consumption of analytics information generated by NWDAF.
An NEF may support CAPIF functions for external exposure as specified in
clause 6.2.5.1.
An NEF may support exposure of NWDAF analytics as specified in TS 23.288 [86].
The NEF may support exposure of 5GS and/or UE availability and capabilities
for time synchronization service as specified in clause 5.27.1.8.
An NEF may support exposure of event based notifications and reports for NSACF
as specified in clause 5.15.11.
An AF may only be able to identify the target UE of an AF request for external
exposure of 5GC capabilities (e.g. Data Provisioning or for Event Exposure for
a specific UE) by providing the UE\'s address information. In this case the
NEF first needs to retrieve the Permanent identifier of the UE before trying
to fulfil the AF request. The NEF may determine the Permanent identifier of
the UE, as described in clause 4.15.3.2.13 of TS 23.502 [3], based on:
\- the address of the UE as provided by the AF; this may be an IP address or a
MAC address;
\- the corresponding DNN and/or S-NSSAI information: this may have been
provided by the AF or determined by the NEF based on the requesting AF; this
is needed if the UE address is an IP address.
The NEF may provide an AF specific UE Identifier to the AF:
\- that has explicitly requested a translation from the address of the UE to a
unique UE identifier (via Nnef_UEId service); or
\- that has implicitly requested a translation from the address of the UE to a
AF specific UE Identifier by requesting external exposure about an individual
UE identified by its address.
The AF may have its own means to maintain the AF specific UE Identifier
through, e.g. an AF session. After the retrieval of an AF specific UE
Identifier the AF shall not keep maintaining a mapping between this identifier
and the UE IP address as this mapping may change.
The AF specific UE Identifier shall not correspond to a MSISDN; it is
represented as a GPSI in the form of an External Identifier. When used as an
AF specific UE identifier, the External Identifier provided by the 5GCN shall
be different for different AF.
NOTE 1: This is to protect user privacy.
NOTE 2: The AF specific UE identifier is ensured to be unique across different
AFs as defined in TS 23.003 [19] by configuration. Such configuration is
assumed to be coordinated between the different involved entities (e.g. NEF(s)
and UDM/UDR).
NOTE 3: Based on policies, the NEF can be configured to enforce restriction on
the usage of AF specific UE identifier (e.g. rejection of a service request
from AF not authorized to use the UE identifier).
## 5.20a Data Collection from an AF
An NF that needs to collect data from an AF may subscribe/unsubscribe to
notifications regarding data collected from an AF, either directly from the AF
or via NEF.
The data collected from an AF is used as input for analytics by the NWDAF.
The details for the data collected from an AF as well as interactions between
NEF, AF and NWDAF are described in TS 23.288 [86].
## 5.21 Architectural support for virtualized deployments
### 5.21.0 General
5GC supports different virtualized deployment scenarios, including but not
limited to the options below:
\- A Network Function instance can be deployed as distributed, redundant,
stateless, and scalable NF instance that provides the services from several
locations and several execution instances in each location.
\- This type of deployments would typically not require support for addition
or removal of NF instances for redundancy and scalability. In the case of an
AMF this deployment option may use enablers like, addition of TNLA, removal of
TNLA, TNLA release and rebinding of NGAP UE association to a new TNLA to the
same AMF.
\- A Network Function instance can also be deployed such that several network
function instances are present within a NF set provide distributed, redundant,
stateless and scalability together as a set of NF instances.
\- This type of deployments may support for addition or removal of NF
instances for redundancy and scalability. In the case of an AMF this
deployment option may use enablers like, addition of AMFs and TNLAs, removal
of AMFs and TNLAs, TNLA release and rebinding of NGAP UE associations to a new
TNLA to different AMFs in the same AMF set.
\- The SEPP, although not a Network Function instance, can also be deployed
distributed, redundant, stateless, and scalable.
\- The SCP, although not a Network Function instance, can also be deployed
distributed, redundant, and scalable.
Also, deployments taking advantage of only some or any combination of concepts
from each of the above options is possible.
### 5.21.1 Architectural support for N2
#### 5.21.1.1 TNL associations
5G-AN node shall have the capability to support multiple TNL associations per
AMF, i.e. AMF name.
An AMF shall provide the 5G-AN node with the weight factors for each TNL
association of the AMF.
The AMF shall be able to request the 5G-AN node to add or remove TNL
associations to the AMF.
The AMF shall be able to indicate to the 5G-AN node the set of TNL
associations used for UE-associated signalling and the set of TNL associations
used for non-UE associated signalling.
NOTE: The TNL association(s) indicated for UE-associated and non-UE associated
signalling can either be overlap or be different.
#### 5.21.1.2 NGAP UE-TNLA-binding
While a UE is in CM-Connected state the 5G-AN node shall maintain the same
NGAP UE-TNLA-binding (i.e. use the same TNL association and same NGAP
association for the UE) unless explicitly changed or released by the AMF.
An AMF shall be able to update the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding (i.e. change the TNL
association for the UE) in CM-CONNECTED state at any time. The NGAP UE-TNLA-
binding can also be updated when a UE-specific NGAP message initiated by AMF
is received via a new TNL association.
An AMF shall be able to update the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding (i.e. change the TNL
association for the UE) in response to an N2 message received from the 5G-AN
by triangular redirection (e.g. by responding to the 5G-AN node using a
different TNL association).
An AMF shall be able to command the 5G-AN node to release the NGAP UE-TNLA-
binding for a UE in CM-CONNECTED state while maintaining N3 (user-plane
connectivity) for the UE at any time.
#### 5.21.1.3 N2 TNL association selection
The 5G-AN node shall consider the following factors for selecting a TNL
association for the AMF for the initial N2 message e.g. N2 INITIAL UE MESSAGE:
\- Availability of candidate TNL associations.
\- Weight factors of candidate TNL associations.
The AMF may use any TNL association intended for non-UE associated signalling
for initiation of the N2 Paging procedure.
### 5.21.2 AMF Management
#### 5.21.2.1 AMF Addition/Update
The 5G System should support establishment of association between AMF and
5G-AN node.
A new AMF can be added to an AMF set and association between AMF and GUAMI can
be created and/or updated as follows:
\- AMF shall be able to dynamically update the NRF with the new or updated
GUAMI(s) to provide mapping between GUAMI(s) and AMF information. Association
between GUAMI(s) and AMF is published to NRF. In addition, to deal with
planned maintenance and failure, an AMF may optionally provide backup AMF
information, i.e. it act as a backup AMF if the indicated GUAMI associated AMF
is unavailable. It is assumed that the backup AMF and the original AMF are in
the same AMF set as they have access to the same UE context. Based on that
information one GUAMI is associated with an AMF, optionally with a backup AMF
used for planned removal and/or another (same or different) backup AMF used
for failure.
\- Upon successful update, the NRF considers the new and/or updated GUAMI(s)
for providing AMF discovery results to the requester. Requester can be other
CP network functions.
\- The new AMF provides its GUAMI to 5G-AN and 5G-AN store this association.
If the association between the same GUAMI and another AMF exists in the 5G-AN
(e.g. due to AMF planned removal), the previously stored AMF is replaced by
the new AMF for the corresponding GUAMI association.
Information about new AMF should be published and available in the DNS system.
It should allow 5G-AN to discover AMF and setup associations with the AMF
required. N2 setup procedure should allow the possibility of AMFs within the
AMF Set to advertise the same AMF Pointer and/or distinct AMF Pointer value(s)
to the 5G-AN node.
To support the legacy EPC core network entity (i.e. MME) to discover and
communicate with the AMF, the information about the AMF should be published
and available in the DNS system. Furthermore, GUMMEI and GUAMI encoding space
should be partitioned to avoid overlapping values in order to enable MME
discover an AMF without ambiguity.
#### 5.21.2.2 AMF planned removal procedure
##### 5.21.2.2.1 AMF planned removal procedure with UDSF deployed
An AMF can be taken graciously out of service as follows:
\- If an UDSF is deployed in the network, then the AMF stores the context for
registered UE(s) in the UDSF. The UE context includes the AMF UE NGAP ID that
is unique per AMF set. In order for the AMF planned removal procedure to work
graciously, 5G-S-TMSI shall be unique per AMF Set. If there are ongoing
transactions (e.g. N1 procedure) for certain UE(s), AMF stores the UE
context(s) in the UDSF upon completion of an ongoing transaction.
\- The AMF deregister itself from NRF indicating due to AMF planned removal.
NOTE 1: It is assumed that the UE contexts from the old AMF include all event
subscriptions with peer CP NFs.
NOTE 2: Before removal of AMF the overload control mechanism can be used to
reduce the amount of ongoing transaction.
An AMF identified by GUAMI(s) shall be able to notify the 5G-AN that it will
be unavailable for processing transactions by including GUAMI(s) configured on
this AMF. Upon receipt of the indication that an AMF(identified by GUAMI(s))
is unavailable, 5G-AN shall take the following action:
\- 5G-AN should mark this AMF as unavailable and not consider the AMF for
selection for subsequent N2 transactions until 5G-AN learns that it is
available (e.g. as part of discovery results or by configuration).
\- During NGAP Setup procedure, the AMF may include an additional indicator
that the AMF will rebind or release the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding on a per UE-basis
for UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state. If that indicator is included and the 5G-AN
supports timer mechanism, the 5G-AN starts a timer to control the release of
NGAP UE-TNLA-binding. For the duration of the timer or until the AMF releases
or re-binds the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding the AN does not select a new AMF for
subsequent UE transactions. Upon timer expiry, the 5G-AN releases the NGAP UE
UE-TNLA-binding(s) with the corresponding AMF for the respective UE(s), for
subsequent N2 message, the 5G-AN should select a different AMF from the same
AMF set when the subsequent N2 message needs to be sent.
NOTE 3: For UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state, after indicating that the AMF is
unavailable for processing UE transactions and including an indicator that the
AMF releases the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding(s) on a per UE-basis, the AMF can either
trigger a re-binding of the NGAP UE associations to an available TNLA on a
different AMF in the same AMF set or use the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding per UE
release procedure defined in TS 23.502 [3] to release the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding
on a per UE-basis while requesting the AN to maintain N3 (user plane
connectivity) and UE context information.
NOTE 4: The support and the use of timer mechanism in 5G-AN is up to
implementation.
\- If the instruction does not include the indicator, for UE(s) in CM-
CONNECTED state, 5G-AN considers this as a request to release the NGAP UE-
TNLA-binding with the corresponding AMF for the respective UE(s) while
maintaining N3 (user plane connectivity) and UE context information. For
subsequent N2 message, the 5G-AN should select a different AMF from the same
AMF set when the subsequent N2 message needs to be sent.
\- For UE(s) in CM-IDLE state, when it subsequently returns from CM-IDLE state
and the 5G-AN receives an initial NAS message with a 5G S-TMSI or GUAMI
pointing to an AMF that is marked unavailable, the 5G-AN should select a
different AMF from the same AMF set and forward the initial NAS message. If
the 5G-AN can\'t select an AMF from the same AMF set, the 5G-AN selects
another new AMF as described in clause 6.3.5.
An AMF identified by GUAMI(s) shall be able to instruct other peer CP NFs,
subscribed to receive such a notification, that it will be unavailable for
processing transactions by including GUAMI(s) configured on this AMF. If the
CP NFs register with NRF for AMF unavailable notification, then the NRF shall
be able to notify the subscribed NFs to receive such a notification that AMF
identified by GUAMI(s) will be unavailable for processing transactions. Upon
receipt of the notification that an AMF (GUAMI(s)) is unavailable, the other
CP NFs shall take the following actions:
\- CP NF should mark this AMF (identified by GUAMI(s)) as unavailable and not
consider the AMF for selection for subsequent MT transactions until the CP NF
learns that it is available (e.g. as part of NF discovery results or via NF
status notification from NRF).
\- Mark this AMF as unavailable while not changing the status of UE(s)
associated to this AMF (UE(s) previously served by the corresponding AMF still
remain registered in the network), and AMF Set information.
\- For the UE(s) that were associated to the corresponding AMF, when the peer
CP NF needs to initiate a transaction towards the AMF that is marked
unavailable, CP NF should select another AMF from the same AMF set (as in
clause 6.3.5) and forward the transaction together with the old GUAMI. The new
AMF retrieves UE context from the UDSF. If CP NF needs to send a notification
to new AMF which is associated with a subscription from the old AMF, the CP NF
shall exchange the old AMF information embedded in the Notification Address
with the new AMF information, and use that Notification Address for subsequent
communication.
NOTE 5: If the CP NF does not subscribe to receive AMF unavailable
notification (either directly from the AMF or via NRF), the CP NF may attempt
forwarding the transaction towards the old AMF and detect that the AMF is
unavailable after certain number of attempts. When it detects unavailable, it
marks the AMF and its associated GUAMI(s) as unavailable. CP NF should select
another AMF from the same AMF set (as in clause 6.3.5) and forward the
transaction together with the old GUAMI. The new AMF retrieves UE context from
the UDSF and process the transaction.
Following actions should be performed by the newly selected AMF:
\- When there is a transaction with the UE the newly selected AMF retrieves
the UE context from the UDSF based on SUPI, 5G-GUTI or AMF UE NGAP ID and
processes the UE message accordingly and updates the 5G-GUTI towards the UE,
if necessary. For UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state, it may also update the NGAP UE
association with a new AMF UE NGAP ID towards the 5G-AN and replace the GUAMI
in the UE context stored at the 5G-AN with the new GUAMI associated with the
newly selected AMF if the 5G-GUTI has been updated. The AMF also informs the
NG-RAN of the new UE Identity Index Value (derived from the new 5G-GUTI).
\- When there is a transaction with the UE, the new selected AMF updates the
peer NFs (that subscribed to receive AMF unavailability notification from old
AMF), with the new selected AMF information.
\- If the new AMF is aware of a different AMF serving the UE (by
implementation specific means) it forwards the uplink N2 signalling of the UE
to that AMF directly if necessary, the 5G-AN shall be able to receive the
message from a different AMF, or it rejects the transaction from the peer CP
NFs with a cause to indicate that new AMF has been selected, the peer CP NFs
resend the transaction to the new AMF.
NOTE 6: This bullet above addresses situations where 5G-AN node selects an AMF
and CP NFs select another AMF for the UE concurrently. It also addresses the
situation where CP NFs select an AMF for the UE concurrently
\- If the UE is in CM-IDLE state and the new AMF does not have access to the
UE context, the new AMF selects one available AMF from the old AMF set as
described in clause 6.3.5. The selected AMF retrieves the UE context from the
UDSF and provides the UE context to the new AMF. If the new AMF doesn\'t
receive the UE context then the AMF may force the UE to perform Initial
Registration.
##### 5.21.2.2.2 AMF planned removal procedure without UDSF
An AMF can be taken graciously out of service as follows:
\- The AMF can forward registered UE contexts, UE contexts grouped by the same
GUAMI value, to target AMF(s) within the same AMF set, including the source
AMF name used for redirecting UE\'s MT transaction. The UE context includes
the per AMF Set unique AMF UE NGAP ID. In order for the AMF planned removal
procedure to work graciously, 5G-S-TMSI shall be unique per AMF set. If there
are ongoing transactions (e.g. N1 procedure) for certain UE(s), AMF forwards
the UE context(s) to the target AMF upon completion of an ongoing transaction.
\- The AMF deregister itself from NRF indicating due to AMF planned removal.
NOTE 1: It is assumed that the UE contexts from the old AMF include all event
subscriptions with peer CP NFs.
NOTE 2: Before removal of AMF the overload control mechanism can be used to
reduce the amount of ongoing transaction.
An AMF shall be able to instruct the 5G-AN that it will be unavailable for
processing transactions by including GUAMI(s) configured on this AMF and its
corresponding target AMF(s). The target AMF shall be able to update the 5G-AN
that the UE(s) served by the old GUAMI(s) are now served by target AMF. The
target AMF provides the old GUAMI value that the 5G-AN can use to locate UE
contexts served by the old AMF. Upon receipt of the indication that an old AMF
is unavailable, 5G-AN shall take the following action:
\- 5G-AN should mark this AMF as unavailable and not consider the AMF for
selection for subsequent N2 transactions until 5G-AN learns that it is
available (e.g. as part of discovery results or by configuration). The
associated GUAMIs are marked as unavailable.
\- During NGAP Setup, the AMF may include an additional indicator that the AMF
will rebind or release the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding on per UE-basis. If that
indicator is included and the 5G-AN supports timer mechanism, the 5G-AN starts
a timer to control the release of NGAP UE-TNLA-binding(s). For the duration of
the timer or until the AMF releases or re-binds the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding, the
AN does not select a new AMF for subsequent transactions. Upon timer expiry,
the 5G-AN releases the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding(s) with the corresponding AMF for
the respective UE(s), for subsequent N2 message, the 5G-AN uses GUAMI which
points to the target AMF that replaced the old unavailable AMF, to forward the
N2 message to the corresponding target AMF(s).
NOTE 3: For UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state, after indicating that the AMF is
unavailable for processing UE transactions and including an indicator that the
AMF releases the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding on a per UE-basis, the AMF can either
trigger a re-binding of the NGAP UE associations to an available TNLA on a
different AMF within the same AMF set or use the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding per UE
release procedure defined in TS 23.502 [3] to release the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding
on a per UE-basis while requesting the AN to maintain N3 (user plane
connectivity) and UE context information.
NOTE 4: The support and the use of timer mechanism in 5G-AN is up to
implementation.
If the instruction does not include the indicator, for UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED
state, 5G-AN considers this as a request to release the NGAP UE UE-TNLA-
binding(s) with the corresponding AMF for the respective UE(s) while
maintaining N3 (user plane connectivity) and UE context information. For
subsequent N2 message, the 5G-AN uses GUAMI based resolution which points to
the target AMF that replaced the old unavailable AMF, to forward the N2
message to the corresponding target AMF(s).
\- For UE(s) in CM-IDLE state, when it subsequently returns from CM-IDLE state
and the 5G-AN receives an initial NAS message with a 5G S-TMSI or GUAMI, based
resolution the 5G-AN uses 5G S-TMSI or GUAMI which points to the target AMF
that has replaced the old unavailable AMF and, the 5G-AN forwards N2 message.
An AMF shall be able to instruct other peer CP NFs, subscribed to receive such
a notification, that it will be unavailable for processing transactions by
including GUAMI(s) configured on this AMF and its corresponding target AMF(s).
The target AMF shall update the CP NF that the old GUAMI(s) is now served by
target AMF. The old AMF provides the old GUAMI value to target AMF and the
target AMF can use to locate UE contexts served by the old AMF. If the CP NFs
register with NRF for AMF unavailable notification, then the NRF shall be able
to notify the subscribed NFs to receive such a notification (along with the
corresponding target AMF(s)) that AMF identified by GUAMI(s) will be
unavailable for processing transactions. Upon receipt of the notification that
an AMF is unavailable, the other CP NFs shall take the following action:
\- Mark this AMF and its associated GUAMI(s) as unavailable while not changing
the status of UE(s) associated to this AMF (UE(s) previously served by the
corresponding AMF still remain registered in the network), and AMF Set
information.
\- For the UE(s) that were associated to the corresponding AMF, when the peer
CP NF needs to initiate a transaction towards the AMF that is marked
unavailable and the old unavailable AMF was replaced by the target AMF, CP NF
should forward the transaction together with the old GUAMI to the target
AMF(s). If CP NF needs to send a notification to new AMF which is associated
with a subscription from the old AMF, the CP NF shall exchange the old AMF
information embedded in the Notification Address with the new AMF information,
and use that Notification Address for subsequent communication.
NOTE 5: If the CP NF does not subscribe to receive AMF unavailable
notification (either directly with the AMF or via NRF), the CP NF may attempt
forwarding the transaction towards the old AMF and detect that the AMF is
unavailable after certain number of attempts. When it detects unavailable, it
marks the AMF and its associated GUAMI(s) as unavailable.
The following actions should be performed by the target AMF:
\- To allow AMF process ongoing transactions for some UE(s) even after it
notifies unavailable status to the target AMF, the target AMF keeps the
association of the old GUAMI(s) and the old AMF for a configured time. During
that configured period, if target AMF receives the transaction from the peer
CP NFs and cannot locate UE context, it rejects the transaction with old AMF
name based on that association, and the indicated AMF is only used for the
ongoing transaction. The peer CP NFs resend the transaction to the indicated
AMF only for the ongoing transaction. For subsequent transactions, peer CP NFs
should use the target AMF. When the timer is expired, the target AMF deletes
that association information.
\- When there is a transaction with the UE the target AMF uses SUPI, 5G-GUTI
or AMF UE NGAP ID to locate UE contexts and processes the UE transactions
accordingly and updates the 5G-GUTI towards the UE, if necessary. For UE(s) in
CM-CONNECTED state, it may also update the NGAP UE association with a new AMF
UE NGAP ID towards the 5G-AN and replace the GUAMI in the UE context stored at
the 5G-AN with the new GUAMI associated with the newly selected AMF if the
5G-GUTI has been updated. The AMF also informs the NG-RAN of the new UE
Identity Index Value (derived from the new 5G-GUTI).
\- Target AMF shall not use old GUAMI to allocate 5G-GUTI for UE(s) that are
being served by Target AMF.
#### 5.21.2.3 Procedure for AMF Auto-recovery
In order to try and handle AMF failure in a graceful manner (i.e. without
impacting the UE), AMF can either back up the UE contexts in UDSF, or per
GUAMI granularity in other AMFs (serving as backup AMF for the indicated
GUAMI).
NOTE 1: Frequency of backup is left to implementation.
For deployments without UDSF, for each GUAMI the backup AMF information (in
association to the GUAMI) is configured in the AMF. The AMF sends this
information to 5G-AN and other CP NFs during the N2 setup procedure or the
first (per NF) interaction with other CP NFs.
In the case that an AMF fails and the 5G-AN/peer CP NFs detect that the AMF
has failed, or the 5G-AN/peer CP NFs receives notification from another AMF in
the same AMF set that this AMF has failed, following actions are taken:
\- The OAM deregister the AMF from NRF indicating due to AMF failure.
\- 5G-AN marks this AMF as failed and not consider the AMF for selection until
explicitly notified.
\- For UE(s) in CM-CONNECTED state, 5G-AN considers failure detection or
failure notification as a trigger to release the NGAP UE-TNLA-binding(s) with
the corresponding AMF for the respective UE(s) while maintaining N3 (user
plane connectivity) and other UE context information. For subsequent N2
message, if the backup AMF information of the corresponding failed AMF is not
available the 5G-AN should select a different AMF (as in clause 6.3.5) from
the same AMF set when the subsequent N2 message needs to be sent for the
UE(s). If no other AMF from the AMF set is available, then it can select an
AMF (implementation dependent) from the same AMF Region as in clause 6.3.5. If
backup AMF information of the corresponding failed AMF is available, the 5G-AN
forwards the N2 message to the backup AMF.
NOTE 2: One AMF in the AMF set may be configured to send this failure
notification message.
\- For UE(s) in CM-IDLE state, when it subsequently returns from CM-IDLE state
and the 5G-AN receives an initial NAS message with a S-TMSI or GUAMI pointing
to an AMF that is marked failed, if the backup AMF information of the
corresponding failed AMF is not available the 5G-AN should select a different
AMF from the same AMF set and forward the initial NAS message. If no other AMF
from the AMF set is available, then it can select an AMF (implementation
dependent) from the same AMF Region as in clause 6.3.5. If backup AMF
information of the corresponding failed AMF is available, the 5G-AN forwards
the N2 message to the backup AMF.
\- Peer CP NFs consider this AMF as unavailable while retaining the UE
context.
\- For the UE(s) that were associated to the corresponding AMF, when the peer
CP NF needs to initiate a transaction towards the AMF, if backup AMF
information of the corresponding failed AMF is not available, CP NF should
select another AMF from the same AMF set and forward the transaction together
with the old GUAMI. If neither the backup AMF nor any other AMF from the AMF
set is available, then CP NF can select an AMF from the same AMF Region as in
clause 6.3.5. If backup AMF information of the corresponding failed AMF is
available, the CP NF forwards transaction to the backup AMF. If CP NF needs to
send a notification to new AMF which is associated with a subscription from
the old AMF, the CP NF shall exchange the old AMF information embedded in the
Notification Address with the new AMF information, and use that Notification
Address for subsequent communication.
\- When the 5G-AN or CP NFs need to select a different AMF from the same AMF
set,
\- For deployments with UDSF, any AMF from the same AMF set can be selected.
\- For deployments without UDSF, the backup AMF is determined based on the
GUAMI of the failed AMF.
Following actions should be taken by the newly selected AMF:
\- For deployments with UDSF, when there is a transaction with the UE the
newly selected AMF retrieves the UE context from the UDSF using SUPI, 5G-GUTI
or AMF UE NGAP ID and it processes the UE message accordingly and updates the
5G-GUTI towards the UE, if necessary.
\- For deployments without UDSF, backup AMF (the newly selected AMF), based on
the failure detection of the old AMF, instructs peer CP NFs and 5G-AN that the
UE contexts corresponding to the GUAMI of the failed AMF is now served by this
newly selected AMF. The backup AMF shall not use old GUAMI to allocate 5G-GUTI
for UE(s) that are being served by Target AMF. The backup AMF uses the GUAMI
to locate the respective UE Context(s).
\- When there is a transaction with the UE, the new AMF updates the peer NFs
(that subscribed to receive AMF unavailability notification from old AMF) with
the new AMF information.
\- If the new AMF is aware of a different AMF serving the UE (by
implementation specific means) it redirects the uplink N2 signalling to that
AMF, or reject the transaction from the peer CP NFs with a cause to indicate
that new AMF has been selected. The peer CP NFs may wait for the update from
the new AMF and resend the transaction to the new AMF.
NOTE 3: This bullet above addresses situations where 5G-AN node selects an AMF
and other CP NFs select an AMF for the UE concurrently. It also addresses the
situation where CP NFs select an AMF for the UE concurrently.
NOTE 4: It is assumed that the UE contexts from the old AMF include all event
subscriptions with peer CP NFs.
\- If the UE is in CM-IDLE state and the new AMF does not have access to the
UE context, the new AMF selects one available AMF from the old AMF set as
described in clause 6.3.5. The selected AMF retrieves the UE context from the
UDSF and provides the UE context to the new AMF. If the new AMF doesn\'t
receive the UE context then the AMF may force the UE to perform Initial
Registration.
\- If the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the new AMF may also update the NGAP UE
association with a new AMF UE NGAP ID towards the 5G-AN and replace the GUAMI
in the UE context stored at the 5G-AN with the new GUAMI associated with the
newly selected AMF if the 5G-GUTI has been updated.
NOTE 5: The above N2 TNL association selection and AMF management is applied
to the selected PLMN.
### 5.21.3 Network Reliability support with Sets
#### 5.21.3.1 General
A Network Function instance can be deployed such that several network function
instances are present within an NF Set to provide distribution, redundancy and
scalability together as a Set of NF instances. The same is also supported for
NF Services. This can be achieved when the equivalent NFs and NF Services
share the same context data or by Network Function/NF Service Context Transfer
procedures as specified in clause 4.26 of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE: A NF can be replaced by an alternative NF within the same NF Set in the
case of scenarios such as failure, load balancing, load re-balancing.
Such a network reliability design shall work in both communication modes, i.e.
Direct Communication and Indirect Communication. In the Direct Communication
mode, the NF Service consumer is involved in the reliability related
procedures. In Indirect Communication mode, the SCP is involved in the
reliability related procedures.
#### 5.21.3.2 NF Set and NF Service Set
Equivalent Control Plane NFs may be grouped into NF Sets, e.g. several SMF
instances are grouped into an SMF Set. NFs within a NF Set are interchangeable
because they share the same context data, and may be deployed in different
locations, e.g. different data centres.
In the case of SMF, multiple instances of SMFs within an SMF Set need to be
connected to the same UPF:
\- If the N4 association is established between a SMF instance and an UPF,
each N4 association is only managed by the related SMF instance.
\- If only one N4 association is established between a SMF Set and an UPF, any
SMF in the SMF Set should be able to manage the N4 association with the UPF.
Furthermore, for a given UE and PDU Session any SMF in the SMF Set should be
able to control the N4 session with the UPF (however, at any given time, only
one SMF in the SMF Set will control the UPF for a given UE\'s PDU Session).
A Control Plane NF is composed of one or multiple NF Services. Within a NF a
NF service may have multiple instances. These multiple NF Service instances
can be grouped into NF Service Set if they are interchangeable with each other
because they share the same context data.
NOTE: The actual mapping of instances to a given Set is up to deployment.
#### 5.21.3.3 Reliability of NF instances within the same NF Set
The NF producer instance is the NF instance which host the NF Service
Producer. When the NF producer instance is not available, another NF producer
instance within the same NF Set is selected.
For Direct Communication mode, the NF Service consumer may subscribe to status
change notifications of NF instance from the NRF. If the NF Service consumer
is notified by the NRF or detects by itself (e.g. request is not responded)
that the NF producer instance is not available anymore, another available NF
producer instance within the same NF Set is selected by the NF Service
consumer.
For Indirect Communication mode, the SCP or NF Service consumer may subscribe
to status change notifications of NF instance from the NRF and selects another
NF producer instance within the same NF Set if the original NF producer
instance serving the UE is not available anymore.
NOTE: It is up to the implementation on how the SCP knows a NF producer
instance is not available anymore.
#### 5.21.3.4 Reliability of NF Services
When multiple NF Service instances within a NF Service Set are exposed to the
NF Service consumer or SCP and the failure of NF Service instance is detected
or notified by the NRF, i.e. it is not available anymore, the NF Service
consumer or SCP selects another NF Service instance of the same NF Service Set
within the NF instance, if available. Otherwise the NF Service consumer or SCP
selects a different NF instance within the same NF Set.
NOTE: The NF Producer instance can change the NF Service instance in the
response to the service request.
When multiple NF Service instances within a NF Service Set are exposed to the
NF Service consumer or SCP as a single NF Service, the reliability, i.e. the
selection of an alternative NF Service instance is handled within the NF
instance.
### 5.21.4 Network Function/NF Service Context Transfer
#### 5.21.4.1 General
Network Function/NF Service Context Transfer Procedures allow transfer of
Service Context of a NF/NF Service from a Source NF/NF Service Instance to the
Target NF/NF Service Instance e.g. before the Source NF/NF Service can
gracefully close its NF/NF Service. Service Context Transfer procedures are
supported as specified in clause 4.26 of TS 23.502 [3].
Source NF / OA&M system determines when Source NF needs to transfer UE
contexts to an NF in another NF set. Source NF should initiate this only for
UE(s) that are not active in order to limit and avoid impacting services
offered to corresponding UE(s).
## 5.22 System Enablers for priority mechanism
### 5.22.1 General
The 5GS and the 5G QoS model allow classification and differentiation of
specific services such as listed in clause 5.16, based on subscription-related
and invocation-related priority mechanisms. These mechanisms provide abilities
such as invoking, modifying, maintaining, and releasing QoS Flows with
priority, and delivering QoS Flow packets according to the QoS characteristics
under network congestion conditions.
Subscription-related Priority Mechanisms include the ability to prioritize
flows based on subscription information, including the prioritization of RRC
Connection Establishment based on Unified Access Control mechanisms and the
establishment of prioritized QoS Flows.
Invocation-related Priority Mechanisms include the ability for the service
layer to request/invoke the activation of prioritized QoS Flows through an
interaction over Rx/N5 and packet detection in the UPF.
QoS Mechanisms applied to established QoS Flows include the ability to fulfil
the QoS characteristics of QoS Flows through preservation of differentiated
treatment for prioritized QoS Flow and resource distribution prioritization.
Messages associated with priority services that are exchanged over service-
based interfaces may include a Message Priority header to indicate priority
information, as specified in TS 23.502 [3] and TS 29.500 [49].
In addition, the separation of concerns between the service classification
provided by the core network through the association of Service Data Flows to
QoS, and the enforcing of QoS differentiation in (R)AN through the association
of QoS Flows to Data Radio bearers, supports the prioritization of QoS Flows
when a limitation of the available data radio bearers occurs.
In addition, it also includes the ability for the service layer to provide
instructions on how to perform pre-emption of media flows with the same
priority assigned through an interaction over Rx as defined in TS 23.503 [45].
### 5.22.2 Subscription-related Priority Mechanisms
Subscription-related mechanisms which are always applied:
\- (R)AN: During initial Access Network Connection Establishment, the
Establishment Cause is set to indicate that special treatment is to be applied
by the (R)AN in the radio resource allocation as specified in clause 5.2 for
3GPP access.
\- **UDM:** As defined in clause 5.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3], the UE subscription
data in the UDM contains an MPS subscription indication (i.e. MPS priority)
and an MCX subscription indication (i.e. MCX priority) for the UE that has
subscription to MPS and MCX, respectively. The MPS priority and the MCX
priority, if available, are provided to the AMF via the Registration or the UE
Configuration Update procedure as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
\- **AMF:** Following Access Network Connection Establishment, the receipt of
the designated Establishment Cause (i.e. high priority access) by the AMF will
result in priority handling of the \"Initial UE Message\" received as part of
the Registration procedures of clause 4.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. If the AMF did
not receive a designated Establishment Cause (i.e. high priority access), but
when the AMF determines that there is a MPS priority (or MCX priority) in the
UDM for that UE, the AMF shall provide priority handling for that UE at that
time and shall provide the MPS priority (or MCX priority) to the UE via the
Registration or the UE Configuration Update procedure, as defined in clause
4.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. In addition, certain exemptions to Control Plane
Congestion and Overload Control are provided as specified in clause 5.19.
Subscription-related mechanisms which are conditionally applied:
\- **UE:** When barring control parameters are broadcast by the RAN, access
barring based on Access Identity(es) configured in the USIM and/or an Access
Category is applied prior to an initial upstream transmission for the UE which
provides a mechanism to limit transmissions from UEs categorized as non-
prioritized, while allowing transmissions from UEs categorized as prioritized
(such as MPS subscribed UEs), during the RRC Connection Establishment
procedure as specified in clause 5.2.
\- **UDM:** One or more ARP priority levels are assigned for prioritized or
critical services. The ARP of the prioritized QoS Flows for each DN is set to
an appropriate ARP priority level. The 5QI is from the standard value range as
specified in clause 5.7.2.7. In addition, Priority Level may be configured for
the standardized 5QIs, and if configured, it overwrites the default value
specified in the QoS characteristics Table 5.7.4-1.
\- **PCF:** The \"IMS Signalling Priority\" information is set for the
subscriber in the UDM, and the PCF modifies the ARP of the QoS Flow used for
IMS signalling, for each DN which supports prioritized services leveraging on
IMS signalling, to an appropriate ARP priority level assigned for that
service.
### 5.22.3 Invocation-related Priority Mechanisms
The generic mechanisms used based on invocation-related Priority Mechanisms
for prioritised services are based an interaction with an Application Function
and between the Application Function and the PCF over Rx/N5 interface.
These mechanisms apply to mobile originated as well as mobile terminated SIP
call/sessions (clause 5.21 of TS 23.228 [15]) and Priority PDU connectivity
services including MPS for Data Transport Service.
NOTE 1: Clause 5.21 of TS 23.228 [15] is applicable to 5GS, with the
understanding that the term PCRF corresponds to PCF in the 5GS.
Invocation-related mechanisms for Mobile Originations e.g. via SIP/IMS:
\- PCF: When an indication for a session arrives over the Rx/N5 Interface and
the UE does not have priority for the signalling QoS Flow, the PCF derives the
ARP and 5QI parameters, plus associated QoS characteristics as appropriate, of
the QoS Flow for Signalling as per Service Provider policy as specified in
clause 6.1.3.11 of TS 23.503 [45].
\- PCF: For sessions such as MPS, when establishing or modifying a QoS Flow
for media as part of the session origination procedure, the PCF selects the
ARP and 5QI parameters, plus associated QoS characteristics as appropriate, to
provide priority treatment to the QoS Flow(s).
\- PCF: When all active sessions to a particular DN are released, and the UE
is not configured for priority treatment to that particular PDU Session for a
DN, the PCF will downgrade the IMS Signalling QoS Flows from appropriate
settings of the ARP and 5QI parameters, plus associated QoS characteristics as
appropriate, to those entitled by the UE based on subscription.
Invocation-related mechanisms for Mobile Terminations e.g. via SIP/IMS:
\- PCF: When an indication for a session arrives over the Rx/N5 Interface,
mechanisms as described above for Mobile Originations are applied.
\- UPF: If an IP packet arrives at the UPF for a UE that is CM-IDLE, the UPF
sends a \"Data Notification\" including the information to identify the QoS
Flow for the DL data packet to the SMF, as specified in clause 4.2.3.3 of TS
23.502 [3].
\- SMF: If a \" Data Notification\" message arrives at the SMF for a QoS Flow
associated with an ARP priority level value that is entitled for priority use,
delivery of priority indication during the Paging procedure is provided by
inclusion of the ARP in the N11 interface \"N1N2MessageTransfer\" message, as
specified in clause 4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
\- AMF: If an \"N1N2MessageTransfer\" message arrives at the AMF containing an
ARP priority level value that is entitled for priority use, the AMF handles
the request with priority and includes the \"Paging Priority\" IE in the N2
\"Paging\" message set to a value assigned to indicate that there is an IP
packet at the UPF entitled to priority treatment, as specified in clause
4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
\- SMF: For a UE that is not configured for priority treatment, upon receiving
the \"N7 Session Management Policy Modification\" message from the PCF with an
ARP priority level that is entitled for priority use, the SMF sends an
\"N1N2MessageTransfer\" to update the ARP for the Signalling QoS Flows, as
specified in clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
\- AMF: Upon receiving the \"N1N2MessageTransfer\" message from the SMF with
an ARP priority level that is entitled for priority use, the AMF updates the
ARP for the Signalling QoS Flows, as specified in clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502
[3].
\- (R)AN: Inclusion of the \"Paging Priority\" in the N2 \"Paging\" message
triggers priority handling of paging in times of congestion at the (R)AN as
specified in clause 4.2.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
Invocation-related mechanisms for the Priority PDU connectivity services:
\- PCF: If the state of the Priority PDU connectivity services is modified
from disabled to enabled, the QoS Flow(s) controlled by the Priority PDU
connectivity services are established/modified to have the service appropriate
settings of the ARP and 5QI parameters, plus associated QoS characteristics as
appropriate, using the PDU Session Modification procedure as specified in
clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
\- PCF: If the state of Priority PDU connectivity services is modified from
enabled to disabled, the QoS Flow(s) controlled by the Priority PDU
connectivity services are modified from Priority PDU connectivity service
appropriate settings of the ARP and 5QI parameters, plus associated QoS
characteristics as appropriate, to those entitled by the UE as per
subscription, using the PDU Session Modification procedure as specified in
clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
Invocation-related mechanisms for MPS for Data Transport Service:
\- MPS for Data Transport Service follows the same steps as those for Priority
PDU connectivity services. The QoS Flows that will be subject to MPS for Data
Transport Service are based on operator policy and regulations by means of
local PCF configuration.
NOTE 2: If no configuration is provided, MPS for Data Transport Service
applies to the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule.
### 5.22.4 QoS Mechanisms applied to established QoS Flows
Mechanisms applied to established QoS Flows:
\- (R)AN: QoS Flows requested in the Xn \"Handover Request\" or N2 \"Handover
Request\" which are marked as entitled to priority by virtue of inclusion of
an ARP value from the set allocated by the Service Provider for prioritised
services are given priority over requests for QoS Flows which do not include
an ARP from the set as specified in clause 4.9 of TS 23.502 [3].
\- SMF: Congestion management procedures in the SMF will provide priority to
QoS Flows established for sessions during periods of extreme overload.
Prioritised services are exempt from any session management congestion
controls. See clause 5.19.
\- AMF: Congestion management procedures in the AMF will provide priority to
any Mobility Management procedures required for the prioritised services
during periods of extreme overload. Prioritised services are exempt from any
Mobility Management congestion controls. See clause 5.19.5.
\- QoS Flows whose ARP parameter is from the set allocated by the Service
Provider for prioritised services\' use shall be exempt from release during
QoS Flow load rebalancing.
\- (R)AN, UPF: IMS Signalling Packets associated with prioritised services\'
use are handled with priority. Specifically, during times of severe congestion
when it is necessary to drop packets on the IMS Signalling QoS Flow, or QoS
Flow supporting MPS for Data Transport Service signalling, to ensure network
stability, these FEs shall drop packets not associated with priority
signalling such as MPS or Mission Critical services before packets associated
with priority signalling. See clauses 5.16.5 and 5.16.6.
\- (R)AN, UPF: During times of severe congestion when it is necessary to drop
packets on a media QoS Flow to ensure network stability, these FEs shall drop
packets not associated with priority sessions such as MPS or Mission Critical
services before packets associated with priority sessions. See clauses 5.16.5
and 5.16.6.
## 5.23 Supporting for Asynchronous Type Communication
Asynchronous type communication (ATC) enables 5GC to delay synchronizing UE
context with the UE, so as to achieve an efficient signalling overhead and
increase system capacity. The support of ATC is optional for the AMF.
5GC supports asynchronous type communication with the following functionality:
\- Capability to store the UE context based on the received message, and
synchronize the UE context with the involved network functions or UE later;
For network function (e.g. PCF, UDM, etc.) triggered signalling procedure
(e.g. network triggered Service Request procedure, network triggered PDU
Session Modification procedure, etc.), if the UE CM state in the AMF is CM-
IDLE state and the requesting network function indicates to the AMF the ATC is
allowed for the signalling, if the AMF supports the ATC feature, the AMF may
update and store the UE context based on the received message without paging
UE immediately. When the UE CM state in the AMF enters CM-CONNECTED state, the
AMF forwards N1 and N2 message to synchronize the UE context with the (R)AN
and/or the UE.
If the originating NF does not require immediate delivery, it may indicate
that the AMF is allowed to use ATC.
NOTE: Pre-Rel-17 AMF implementation cannot decode the indication that ATC is
allowed.
## 5.24 3GPP PS Data Off
This feature, when activated by the user, prevents traffic via 3GPP access of
all IP packets, Unstructured and Ethernet data except for those related to
3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services. The 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services are a
set of operator services, defined in TS 22.011 [25] and TS 23.221 [23], that
are the only allowed services when the 3GPP PS Data Off feature has been
activated by the user. The 5GC shall support 3GPP PS Data Off operation in
both non-roaming and roaming scenarios.
UEs may be configured with up to two lists of 3GPP PS Data Off Exempt Services
and the list(s) are provided to the UEs by HPLMN via Device Management or UICC
provisioning. When the UE is configured with two lists, one list is valid for
the UEs camping in the home PLMN and the other list is valid for any VPLMN the
UE is roaming in. When the UE is configured with a single list, without an
indication to which PLMNs the list is applicable, then this list is valid for
the home PLMN and any PLMN the UE is roaming in.
NOTE 1: The operator needs to ensure coordinated list(s) of 3GPP Data Off
Exempt Services provisioned in the UE and configured in the network.
The UE reports its 3GPP PS Data Off status in PCO (Protocol Configuration
Option) to (H-)SMF during UE requested PDU Session Establishment procedure for
establishment of a PDU Session associated with 3GPP access and/or non-3GPP
access. The UE does not need to report PS Data Off status during the PDU
Session Establishment procedure for handover of the PDU Session between 3GPP
access and non 3GPP access if 3GPP PS Data Off status is not changed since the
last report. The PS Data Off status for a PDU Session does not affect data
transfer over non-3GPP access.
If 3GPP PS Data Off is activated, the UE prevents the sending of uplink IP
packets, Unstructured and Ethernet data except for those related to 3GPP PS
Data Off Exempt Services, based on the pre-configured list(s) of Data Off
Exempt Services.
If 3GPP PS Data Off is activated for a UE with MA PDU Sessions established
through the ATSSS feature (see clause 5.32), the data transferred over the
non-3GPP access of the MA PDU sessions are unaffected, which is ensured by the
policy for ATSSS Control as specified in clause 5.32.3.
The UE shall immediately report a change of its 3GPP PS Data Off status in PCO
by using UE requested PDU Session Modification procedure. This also applies to
the scenario of inter-RAT mobility to NG-RAN and to scenarios where the 3GPP
PS Data Off status is changed when the session management back-off timer is
running as specified in clause 5.19.7.3 and clause 5.19.7.4. For UEs in Non-
Allowed Area (or not in Allowed Area) as specified in clause 5.3.4.1, the UE
shall also immediately report a change of its 3GPP PS Data Off status for the
PDU Session. For UEs moving out of LADN area and the PDU Session is still
maintained as specified in clause 5.6.5, the UE shall also immediately report
a change of its 3GPP PS Data Off status for the PDU Session.
The additional behaviour of the SMF for 3GPP PS Data Off is controlled by
local configuration or policy from the PCF as defined in TS 23.503 [45].
NOTE 2: For the PDU Session used for IMS services, the 3GPP Data Off Exempt
Services are enforced in the IMS domain as specified TS 23.228 [15]. Policies
configured in the (H-)SMF/PCF need to ensure those services are always allowed
when the 3GPP Data Off status of the UE is set to \"activated\".
## 5.25 Support of OAM Features
### 5.25.1 Support of Tracing: Signalling Based Activation/Deactivation of
Tracing
5GS supports tracing as described in TS 32.421 [66]. 5GS support may include
subscriber tracing (tracing targeting a SUPI) or equipment tracing (tracing
targeting a PEI) but also other forms of tracing further described in TS
32.421 [66].
NOTE 1: TS 23.501 / TS 23.502 [3] / TS 23.503 [45] only describe how 5GS
signalling supports delivery of Trace Requirements about a UE (Signalling
Based Activation/Deactivation of Tracing). OAM delivery of tracing
requirements as well as the transfer of tracing results to one or more
Operations Systems are out of scope of these documents.
The content of Trace Requirements about a UE (e.g. trace reference, address of
the Trace Collection Entity, etc.) is defined in TS 32.421 [66].
Trace Requirements about a UE may be configured in subscription data of the UE
and delivered together with other subscription data by the UDM towards the
AMF, the SMF and/or the SMSF.
The AMF propagates Trace Requirements about a UE received from the UDM to
network entities not retrieving subscription information from UDM, i.e. to the
5G-AN, to the AUSF and to the PCF. The AMF also propagates Trace Requirements
to the SMF and to the SMSF. If the I-SMF or V-SMF is needed for the PDU
session, the AMF propagates Trace Requirements to the I-SMF or V-SMF. The
I-SMF or V-SMF also propagates Trace Requirements received from the AMF to the
I-UPF or V-UPF (over N4).
Trace Requirements about a UE may be sent by the AMF to the 5G-AN as part of:
\- the N2 procedures used to move the UE from CM-IDLE to CM-CONNECTED or,
\- the N2 procedures to request a Hand-over from a target NG-RAN or,
\- a stand-alone dedicated N2 procedure when tracing is activated while the UE
is CM-CONNECTED.
Trace Requirements about a UE sent to a 5G-AN shall not contain information on
the SUPI or on the PEI of the UE. Trace Requirements are directly sent from
Source to Target NG-RAN in the case of Xn Hand-Over.
The SMF propagates Trace Requirements about a UE received from the UDM to the
UPF (over N4) and to the PCF. The SMF provides Trace Requirements to the PCF
when it has selected a different PCF than the one received from the AMF.
Once the SMF or the SMSF has received subscription data, Trace Requirements
received from UDM supersede Trace requirements received from the AMF. Trace
Requirements are exchanged on N26 between the AMF and the MME.
### 5.25.2 Support of OAM-based 5G VN group management
5GS supports 5G LAN-type service as defined in clause 5.29. 5G LAN-type
service includes the 5G VN group management that can be configured by a
network administrator.
The parameters for 5G VN group is defined in clause 5.29.
The 5G VN group parameters about a UE may be configured in subscription data
of the UE and delivered together with other subscription data by the UDM
towards the AMF and SMF.
## 5.26 Configuration Transfer Procedure
The purpose of the Configuration Transfer is to enable the transfer of
information between two RAN nodes at any time via NG interface and the Core
Network. An example of application is to exchange the RAN node\'s IP addresses
in order to be able to use Xn interface between the NG-RAN node for Self-
Optimised Networks (SON), as specified in TS 38.413 [34].
### 5.26.1 Architecture Principles for Configuration Transfer
Configuration Transfer between two RAN node provides a generic mechanism for
the exchange of information between applications belonging to the RAN nodes.
In order to make the information transparent for the Core Network, the
information is included in a transparent container that includes source and
target RAN node addresses, which allows the Core Network nodes to route the
messages. The mechanism is depicted in figure 5.26 1.
Figure 5.26-1: inter NG-RAN Configuration Transfer basic network architecture
The NG-RAN transparent containers are transferred from the source NG-RAN node
to the destination NG-RAN node by use of Configuration Transfer messages.
A Configuration Transfer message is used from the NG-RAN node to the AMF over
N2 interface, a AMF Configuration Transfer message is used from the AMF to the
NG-RAN over N2 interface, and a Configuration Transfer Tunnel message is used
to tunnel the transparent container from a source AMF to a target AMF over the
N14 interface.
Each Configuration Transfer message carrying the transparent container is
routed and relayed independently by the core network node(s).
### 5.26.2 Addressing, routing and relaying
#### 5.26.2.1 Addressing
All the Configuration Transfer messages contain the addresses of the source
and destination RAN nodes. An NG-RAN node is addressed by the Target NG-RAN
node identifier.
#### 5.26.2.2 Routing
The following description applies to all the Configuration Transfer messages
used for the exchange of the transparent container.
The source RAN node sends a message to its core network node including the
source and destination addresses. The AMF uses the destination address to
route the message to the correct AMF via the N14 interface.
The AMF connected to the destination RAN node decides which RAN node to send
the message to, based on the destination address.
#### 5.26.2.3 Relaying
The AMF performs relaying between N2 and N14 messages as described in TS
38.413 [34], TS 29.518 [71].
## 5.27 Enablers for Time Sensitive Communications and Time Synchronization
### 5.27.0 General
This clause describes 5G System features that can be used independently or in
combination to enable time-sensitive communication and time synchronization:
\- Delay-critical GBR;
\- A hold and forward mechanism to schedule traffic as defined in IEEE Std
802.1Q-2018 [98] for Ethernet PDU Sessions in DS-TT and NW-TT (see clause
5.27.4) to de-jitter flows that have traversed the 5G System if the 5G System
is to participate transparently as a bridge in a TSN network;
\- TSC Assistance Information: describes TSC flow traffic characteristics as
described in clause 5.27.2 that may be provided optionally for use by the gNB,
to allow more efficiently schedule radio resources for periodic traffic and
applies to PDU Session type Ethernet and IP.
\- Time Synchronization: describes how 5GS can operate as a PTP Relay (IEEE
Std 802.1AS [104]), as a Boundary Clock or as Transparent Clock (IEEE Std 1588
[126]) for PDU Session type Ethernet and IP.
The 5G System integration as a bridge in an IEEE 802.1 TSN network as
described in clause 5.28 can make use of all features listed above.
To support any of the above features to enable time-sensitive communication
and time synchronization, during the PDU Session establishment, the UE shall
request to establish a PDU Session as an always-on PDU Session, and the PDU
Sessions are established as Always-on PDU session as described in clause
5.6.13. In this release of the specification, to use any of the above features
to enable time-sensitive communication and time synchronization:
\- Home Routed PDU Sessions are not supported;
\- PDU Sessions are supported only for SSC mode 1;
\- Service continuity is not supported when the UE moves from 5GS to EPS .i.e.
interworking with EPS is not supported for a PDU Session for time
synchronization or TSC.
### 5.27.1 Time Synchronization
#### 5.27.1.1 General
For supporting time synchronization service, the 5GS is configured to operate
in one or multiple PTP instances and to operate in one of the following modes
(if supported) for each PTP instance:
1) as time-aware system as described in IEEE Std 802.1AS [104],
2) as Boundary Clock as described in IEEE Std 1588 [126], provisioned by the
profiles supported by this 3GPP specification including SMPTE Profile for Use
of IEEE Std 1588 [126] Precision Time Protocol in Professional Broadcast
Applications ST 2059-2:2015 [127];
NOTE 1: Via proper configuration of the IEEE Std 1588 [126] data set members,
the 5G internal system clock can become the time source for the PTP
grandmaster function for the connected networks in the case of mode 1 and mode
2.
NOTE 2: In some cases where the 5G internal system clock is the time source
for the PTP grandmaster function for the connected networks, it might not be
required for the UE to receive gPTP or PTP messages over user plane. The UE
and DS-TT uses the 5G timing information and generates the necessary gPTP or
PTP message for the end station, if needed (this is implementation specific).
3) as peer-to-peer Transparent Clock as described in IEEE Std 1588 [126],
provisioned by the profiles supported by this 3GPP specification including
SMPTE Profile for Use of IEEE Std 1588 Precision Time Protocol in Professional
Broadcast Applications ST 2059-2:2015 [127]; or
4) as end-to-end Transparent Clock as described in IEEE Std 1588 [126],
provisioned by the profiles supported by this 3GPP specification including
SMPTE Profile for Use of IEEE Std 1588 Precision Time Protocol in Professional
Broadcast Applications ST 2059-2:2015 [127].
NOTE 3: When the GM is external, the operation of 5GS as Boundary Clock
assumes that profiles that are supported by the 5GS allows the exemption
specified in clauses 9.5.9 and 9.5.10 of IEEE Std 1588 [126] where the
originTimestamp (or preciseOriginTimestamp in case of two-step operation) is
not required to be updated with the syncEventEgressTimestamp (and a Local PTP
Clock locked to the external GM). As described in clause 5.27.1.2.2, only
correctionField is updated with the 5GS residence time and link delay, in a
similar operation as specified by IEEE Std 802.1AS [104].
The configuration of the time synchronization service in 5GS for option 1 by
TSN AF and CNC is described in clause 5.28.3, and for options 1-4 by AF/NEF
and TSCTSF in clause 5.27.1.8 and clause 5.28.3.
The 5GS shall be modelled as an IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] or IEEE Std 1588 [126]
compliant entity based on the above configuration.
NOTE 4: This release of the specification does not support the PTP management
mechanism or PTP management messages as described in clause 15 in IEEE Std
1588 [126].
The DS-TT and NW-TT at the edge of the 5G system may support the IEEE Std
802.1AS [104] or other IEEE Std 1588 [126] profiles\' operations respective to
the configured mode of operation. The UE, gNB, UPF, NW-TT and DS- TTs are
synchronized with the 5G GM (i.e. the 5G internal system clock) which shall
serve to keep these network elements synchronized. The TTs located at the edge
of 5G system fulfil some functions related to IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] and may
fulfil some functions related to IEEE Std 1588 [126], e.g. (g)PTP support and
timestamping. Figure 5.27.1-1 illustrates the 5G and PTP grandmaster (GM)
clock distribution model via 5GS.
Figure 5.27.1-1: 5G system is modelled as PTP instance for supporting time
synchronization
Figure 5.27.1-1 depicts the two synchronizations systems considered: the 5G
Clock synchronization and the (g)PTP domain synchronization.
\- 5G Access Stratum-based Time Distribution: Used for NG RAN synchronization
and also distributed to the UE. The 5G Access Stratum-based Time Distribution
over the radio interface towards the UE is specified in TS 38.331 [28]. This
method may be used to either further distribute the 5G timing to devices
connected to a UE (using implementation-specific means) or to support the
operation of the (g)PTP-based time distribution method.
\- (g)PTP-based Time Distribution: Provides timing among entities in a (g)PTP
domain. This process follows the applicable profiles of IEEE Std 802.1AS [104]
or IEEE Std 1588 [126]. This method relies on the 5G access stratum-based time
distribution method to synchronize the UE/DS-TT and on the 5GS time
synchronization to synchronize the gNB (which, in turn, may synchronize the
DS-TT) and the NW-TT.
The gNB needs to be synchronized to the 5G GM clock.
The 5GS supports two methods for determining the grandmaster PTP Instance and
the time-synchronization spanning tree.
\- Method a), BMCA procedure.
\- Method b), local configuration.
This is further described in clause 5.27.1.6.
#### 5.27.1.2 Distribution of timing information
##### 5.27.1.2.1 Distribution of 5G internal system clock
The 5G internal system clock shall be made available to all user plane nodes
in the 5G system. The UPF and NW-TT may get the 5G internal system clock via
the underlying PTP compatible transport network with mechanisms outside the
scope of 3GPP. The 5G internal system clock shall be made available to UE with
signalling of time information related to absolute timing of radio frames as
described in TS 38.331 [28]. The 5G internal system clock shall be made
available to DS-TT by the UE.
##### 5.27.1.2.2 Distribution of grandmaster clock and time-stamping
##### 5.27.1.2.2.1 Distribution of gPTP Sync and Follow_Up messages
{#distribution-of-gptp-sync-and-follow_up-messages .H6}
The mechanisms for distribution of TSN GM clock and time-stamping described in
this clause are according to IEEE Std 802.1AS [104].
NOTE 1: It means Externally-observable behaviour of the 5GS bridge needs to
comply with IEEE Std 802.1AS [104].
For downlink Time Synchronization, upon reception of a downlink gPTP message
from NW-TT port in Follower state, the NW-TT makes an ingress timestamping
(TSi) for each gPTP event (Sync) message and uses the cumulative rateRatio
received inside the gPTP message payload (carried within Sync message for one-
step operation or Follow_up message for two-step operation) to calculate the
link delay from the upstream TSN node (gPTP entity connected to NW-TT)
expressed in TSN GM time as specified in IEEE Std 802.1AS [104]. NW-TT then
calculates the new cumulative rateRatio (i.e. the cumulative rateRatio of the
5GS) as specified in IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] and modifies the gPTP message
payload (carried within Sync message for one-step operation or Follow_up
message for two-step operation) as follows:
\- Adds the link delay from the upstream TSN node in TSN GM time to the
correction field.
\- Replaces the cumulative rateRatio received from the upstream TSN node with
the new cumulative rateRatio.
\- Adds TSi in the Suffix field of the gPTP packet as described in clause H.2.
The UPF/NW-TT uses the ingress port number of the NW-TT, and domainNumber and
sdoId in the received gPTP message to assign the gPTP message to a PTP
instance in the NW-TT. If the NW-TT does not have a matching PTP instance, the
UPF/NW-TT discards the message. The UPF/NW-TT then forwards the gPTP message
from TSN network to the PTP ports in DS-TT(s) in Leader state within this PTP
instance via PDU sessions terminating in this UPF that the UEs have
established to the TSN network. The UPF/NW-TT also forwards the gPTP message
to the PTP ports in NW-TT in Leader state within this PTP instance. All gPTP
messages are transmitted on a QoS Flow that complies with the residence time
upper bound requirement specified in IEEE Std 802.1AS [104].
NOTE 2: Leader and Follower terms in this specification maps to Master and
Slave terms respectively for (g)PTP time synchronization as specified in IEEE
Std 802.1AS [104] and IEEE Std 1588 [126]. This terminology can require update
depending on the IEEE 1588 WG response to SA WG2.
NOTE 3: The sum of the UE-DS-TT residence time and the PDB of the QoS Flow
needs to be lower than the residence time upper bound requirement for a time-
aware system specified in IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] in the following cases:
a) If the PTP port in DS-TT is in Follower state and a PTP port in the NW-TT
is in Leader state; or
b) a PTP port in DS-TT is in Leader state and a PTP port in NW-TT is in
Follower state.
NOTE 4: If the PTP port in DS-TT is in a Follower state, and a PTP port in
another DS-TT is in Leader state, then the sum of the residence time for these
two DS-TT ports and the PDB of the QoS flow of the two PDU Sessions needs to
be lower than the residence time upper bound requirement for a time-aware
system specified in IEEE Std 802.1AS [104].
A UE receives the gPTP messages and forwards them to the DS-TT. The DS-TT then
creates egress timestamping (TSe) for the gPTP event (Sync) messages for
external TSN working domains. The difference between TSi and TSe is considered
as the calculated residence time spent within the 5G system for this gPTP
message expressed in 5GS time. The DS-TT then uses the rateRatio contained
inside the gPTP message payload (carried within Sync message for one-step
operation or Follow_up message for two-step operation) to convert the
residence time spent within the 5GS in TSN GM time and modifies the payload of
the gPTP message that it sends towards the downstream TSN node (gPTP entity
connected to DS-TT) as follows:
\- Adds the calculated residence time expressed in TSN GM time to the
correction field.
\- Removes Suffix field that contains TSi.
If the ingress DS-TT has indicated support of the IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] PTP
profile as described in clause K.2.1 and the network has configured a PTP
instance with the IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] PTP profile for the ingress DS-TT,
the ingress DS-TT performs the following operations for received UL gPTP
messages for the PTP instance:
\- Adds the link delay from the upstream TSN node (gPTP entity connected to
DS-TT) in TSN GM time to the correction field.
\- Replaces the cumulative rateRatio received from the upstream TSN node (gPTP
entity connected to DS-TT) with the new cumulative rateRatio.
\- Adds TSi in the Suffix field of the gPTP packet.
The UE transparently forwards the gPTP message from DS-TT to the UPF/NW-TT. If
the ingress DS-TT port is in Passive state, the UPF/NW-TT discards the gPTP
messages. If the ingress DS-TT port is in Follower state, the UPF/NW-TT
forwards the gPTP messages as follows:
\- In the case of synchronizing end stations behind NW-TT, the egress port is
in UPF/NW-TT. For the received UL gPTP messages, the egress UPF/NW-TT performs
the following actions:
\- Adds the calculated residence time expressed in TSN GM to the correction
field.
\- Removes Suffix field that contains TSi.
\- In the case of synchronizing TSN end stations behind DS-TT, the egress TT
is DS-TT of the other UE, and the UPF/NW-TT uses the port number of the
ingress DS-TT, and domainNumber and sdoId in the received gPTP message to
assign the gPTP message to a PTP instance in the NW-TT. If the NW-TT does not
have a matching PTP instance, the UPF/NW-TT discards the message. The UPF/NW-
TT then forwards the received UL gPTP message to the PTP ports in DS-TT(s) in
Leader state within this PTP instance. The egress DS-TT performs same actions
as egress UPF/NW-TT in previous case.
##### 5.27.1.2.2.2 Distribution of PTP Sync and Follow_Up messages
{#distribution-of-ptp-sync-and-follow_up-messages .H6}
This clause applies if DS-TT and NW-TT support distribution of PTP Sync and
Follow_Up messages. PTP support by DS-TT and NW-TT may be determined as
described in clause K.2.1.
The mechanisms for distribution of PTP GM clock and time-stamping described in
this clause are according to IEEE Std 1588 [126] for Transparent clock and for
the case of Boundary clock when the GM is external, where the originTimestamp
(or preciseOriginTimestamp) is not updated by the 5GS as described by the
exemption in clause 5.27.1.1. If the 5GS acts as the GM with a PTP instance
type Boundary clock, then the 5GS updates the originTimestamp (or
preciseOriginTimestamp in case of two-step operation) with the 5GS internal
clock, as described in clause 5.27.1.7.
NOTE 1: This means externally-observable behaviour of the PTP instance in 5GS
needs to comply with IEEE Std 1588 [126].
Upon reception of a PTP event message from the upstream PTP instance, the
ingress TT (i.e. NW-TT or DS-TT) makes an ingress timestamping (TSi) for each
PTP event (i.e. Sync) message.
The PTP port in the ingress TT measures the link delay from the upstream PTP
instance as described in clause H.4.
The PTP port in the ingress TT modifies the PTP message payload (carried
within Sync message for one-step operation or Follow_Up message for two-step
operation) as follows:
\- (if the PTP port in the ingress TT has measured the link delay) Adds the
measured link delay from the upstream PTP instance in PTP GM time to the
correction field.
\- (if the PTP port in the ingress TT has measured the link delay and
rateRatio is used) Replaces the cumulative rateRatio received from the
upstream PTP instance with the new cumulative rateRatio.
\- Adds TSi in the Suffix field of the PTP message as described in clause H.2.
NOTE 2: If the 5GS is configured to use the Cumulative frequency transfer
method for synchronizing clocks as described in clause 16.10 in IEEE Std 1588
[126], i.e. when the cumulative rateRatio is measured, then the PTP port in
the ingress TT uses the cumulative rateRatio received inside the PTP message
payload (carried within Sync message for one-step operation or Follow_Up
message for two-step operation) to correct the measured link delay to be
expressed in PTP GM time as specified in IEEE Std 1588 [126]. The PTP port in
the ingress TT then calculates the new cumulative rateRatio (i.e. the
cumulative rateRatio of the 5GS) as specified in IEEE Std 1588 [126].
NOTE 3: If 5GS acts as an end-to-end Transparent Clock, since the end-to-end
Transparent Clock does not support peer-to-peer delay mechanism, the residence
time can be calculated with the residence time spent within the 5GS in 5G GM
time and if needed, with a correction factor, for instance, as specified in
Equation (6) of clause 12.2.2 of IEEE Std 1588 [126], this gives a residence
time expressed in PTP GM time that is used to update the correction field of
the received PTP Sync or Follow_Up message.
The PTP port in the ingress TT then forwards the PTP message to the UPF/NW-TT.
The UPF/NW-TT further distributes the PTP message as follows:
\- If the 5GS is configured to operate as Boundary Clock as described in IEEE
Std 1588 [126], the UPF/NW-TT uses the port number of the ingress DS-TT and
domainNumber and sdoId in the received PTP message to assign the PTP message
to a PTP instance in the NW-TT. If the NW-TT does not have a matching PTP
instance, the UPF/NW-TT discards the message. The UPF/NW-TT then regenerates
the Sync and Follow_Up (for two-step operation) messages based on the received
Sync and Follow_Up messages for the PTP ports in Leader state in NW-TT and DS-
TT(s) within this PTP instance. The NW-TT/UPF forwards the regenerated Sync
and Follow_Up (for two-step operation) messages to the Leader ports in NW-TT
and the PDU session(s) related to the Leader ports in the DS-TT(s) within this
PTP instance.
\- If the 5GS is configured to operate as a Transparent Clock as described in
IEEE Std 1588 [126], the UPF/NW-TT uses the port number of the ingress TT and
domainNumber and sdoId in the received PTP message to assign the PTP message
to a PTP instance in the NW-TT. If the NW-TT does not have a matching PTP
instance, the UPF/NW-TT discards the message. The UPF/NW-TT then forwards the
received Sync messages to PTP ports in DS-TT(s) within this PTP instance via
corresponding PDU Sessions terminating to this UPF, and to NW-TT ports within
this PTP instance, except toward the ingress PTP port in the ingress TT.
NOTE 4: If 5GS acts as a Transparent Clock, the 5GS does not maintain the PTP
port states; the ingress PTP messages received on a PTP Port are retransmitted
on all other PTP Ports of the Transparent Clock subject to the rules of the
underlying transport protocol.
NOTE 5: Due to the exemption described in clause 5.27.1.1, when the PTP
instance in 5GS is configured to operate as a Boundary Clock, the 5GS does not
need to synchronize its Local PTP Clock to the external PTP grandmaster. The
PTP instance in 5GS measures the link delay and residence time and
communicates these in a correction field. The externally observable behaviour
of 5GS still conforms to the specifications for a Boundary Clock as described
in IEEE Std 1588 [126].
The PTP port in the egress TT then creates egress timestamping (TSe) for the
PTP event (i.e. Sync) messages for external PTP network. The difference
between TSi and TSe is considered as the calculated residence time spent
within the 5G system for this PTP message expressed in 5GS time.
The PTP port in the egress TT then uses the rateRatio contained inside the PTP
message payload (if available, carried within Sync message for one-step
operation or Follow_Up message for two-step operation) to convert the
residence time spent within the 5GS in PTP GM time.
The PTP port in the egress TT modifies the payload of the PTP message (Sync
message for one-step operation or Follow_Up message for two-step operation)
that it sends towards the downstream PTP instance as follows:
\- Adds the calculated residence time to the correction field.
\- Removes Suffix field of the PTP message that contains TSi.
NOTE 6: If 5GS acts as an end-to-end Transparent Clock, since the end-to-end
Transparent Clock does not support peer-to-peer delay mechanism, the residence
time is calculated with the residence time spent within the 5GS in 5G GM time
and, if needed, corrected for instance with the factor as specified in
Equation (6) of clause 12.2.2 of IEEE Std 1588 [126] to get it expressed in
PTP GM time. The residence time is used to update the correction field of the
received PTP event (e.g. Sync or Follow_Up) message.
#### 5.27.1.3 Support for multiple (g)PTP domains
This clause describes support for multiple domains for gPTP and PTP and for GM
clocks connected to DS-TT and NW-TT and only applies if DS-TT and NW-TT
support the related functionality. PTP support and support of gPTP for GM
clocks connected to DS-TT by DS-TT and NW-TT may be determined as described in
clause K.2.1.
Each (g)PTP domain sends its own (g)PTP messages. The (g)PTP message carries a
specific PTP \"domainNumber\" that indicates the time domain they are
referring to. The PTP port in ingress TT makes ingress timestamping (TSi) for
the (g)PTP event messages of all domains and forwards the (g)PTP messages of
all domains to the UPF/NW-TT that further distributes the (g)PTP messages to
the egress TTs as specified in clause 5.27.1.2.2.
The PTP port in the egress TT receives the original PTP GM clock timing
information and the corresponding TSi via (g)PTP messages for one or more
(g)PTP domains. The PTP port in the egress TT then makes egress timestamping
(TSe) for the (g)PTP event messages for every (g)PTP domain. Ingress and
egress time stamping are based on the 5G system clock at NW-TT and DS-TT.
NOTE 1: An end-station can select PTP timing information of interest based on
the \"domainNumber\" in the (g)PTP message.
The process described in clause 5.27.1.2.2 is thus repeated for each (g)PTP
domain between a DS-TT and the NW-TT it is connected to.
NOTE 2: If all (g)PTP domains can be made synchronous and the synchronization
can be provided by the 5G clock, the NW-TT or DS-TT(s) generates the (g)PTP
event messages of all domains using 5G clock as described in clause 5.27.1.7.
NOTE 3: This Release of the specification supports multiple gPTP domains as
defined in IEEE Std 802.1AS [104]. If a 5GS TSN bridge supports stream gates
and/or transmission gates as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q [98], then they
operate based on a single given gPTP domain.
#### 5.27.1.4 DS-TT and NW-TT Time Synchronization functionality
This clause describes the support of Time Synchronization functionality
supported by the 5G System. Synchronization between UPF/NW-TT and NG-RAN is
outside scope of 3GPP.
DS-TT and NW-TT may support the following PTP instance types:
\- Boundary Clock as defined in IEEE Std 1588 [126] as described in clause
5.27.1.1;
\- End-to-End Transparent Clock as defined in IEEE Std 1588 [126] as described
in clause 5.27.1.1;
\- Peer-to-Peer Transparent Clock as defined in IEEE Std 1588 [126] as
described in clause 5.27.1.1;
\- PTP Relay instance as defined in IEEE Std 802.1AS [104].
Editor\'s note: Support for external networks operating with IEEE Std
1588-2008 [107] is for further study.
DS-TT and NW-TT may support the following transports for PTP:
\- IPv4 as defined in IEEE Std 1588 [126] Annex C;
\- IPv6 as defined in IEEE Std 1588 [126] Annex D;
IEEE Std 802.3 [131] (Ethernet) as defined in IEEE Std 1588 [126] Annex E.
For operation as a Boundary clock or as a Transparent Clock, DS-TT and NW-TT
may support the following path and link delay measurement methods:
\- Delay request-response mechanism as described in clause 11.3 of IEEE Std
1588 [126];
\- Peer-to-peer delay mechanism as defined in clause 11.4 of IEEE Std 1588
[126].
DS-TT and NW-TT may support acting as a PTP grandmaster, i.e. may support
generating (g)PTP Announce, Sync and Follow_Up messages. DS-TT and NW-TT
supporting (g)PTP shall support one or more PTP profiles as described in
clause 20.3 of IEEE Std 1588 [126], i.e.:
\- Default PTP Profiles in IEEE Std 1588 [126], Annex I;
\- IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] PTP profile for transport of timing as defined in
IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] Annex F;
\- SMPTE Profile for Use of IEEE Std 1588 [126] Precision Time Protocol in
Professional Broadcast Applications ST 2059-2:2015 [127].
TSN AF and TSCTSF may determine the PTP functionalities supported by DS-TT and
NW-TT and may configure PTP instances in DS-TT and NW-TT using port and user
plane node management information exchange as described in Annex K, clause
K.2.
NOTE: How the TSN AF or TSCTSF assigns NW-TT port(s) of one NW-TT to different
PTP instances is up to implementation.
#### 5.27.1.5 Detection of (g)PTP Sync and Announce timeouts
The procedure described in this clause is applicable when the PTP instance in
5GS is configured to operate as a time-aware system or as a Boundary Clock,
and the PTP grandmaster is external to the 5GS, and the BMCA procedure (Method
a) is used as described in clause 5.27.1.6.
The NW-TT processes Announce messages according to IEEE Std 1588 [126].
In particular, the NW-TT shall compute and maintain the time when the Announce
and Sync timeout events occur for the PTP port in a Follower state. When the
5GS is configured to operate as a time-aware system, the NW-TT shall determine
the Sync and Announce message interval for the PTP Port at the other end of
the link to which the Follower PTP Port in 5GS is attached, as described in
IEEE Std 802.1AS [104]. When the 5GS is configured to operate as a Boundary
Clock, the NW-TT shall determine Announce interval based on the configuration
of the Follower port in 5GS, as described in IEEE Std 1588 [126].
The configuration of PTP instances in DS-TT and NW-TT for Sync and Announce
timeouts is described in clause K.2. Upon detection of the Sync or Announce
timeout event, the NW-TT shall re-evaluate the DS-TT and NW-TT port states as
described in clause 5.27.1.6.
#### 5.27.1.6 Distribution of Announce messages and best master clock
selection
The procedure described in this clause is applicable if DS-TT and NW-TT
support operating as a Boundary Clock described in IEEE Std 1588 [126] or as a
time-aware system (support of the IEEE 802.1AS [104] PTP profile) and when the
PTP instance in 5GS is configured to operate as a time-aware system or as a
Boundary Clock. Whether DS-TT/NW-TT support operating as a Boundary Clock or
as a time-aware system may be determined as described in clause K.2.1.
The externally-observable behaviour of the Announce message handling by 5GS
needs to comply with IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] or IEEE Std 1588 [126], respective
to the configured mode of operation.
The DS-TT forwards the received Announce messages to NW-TT over User plane.
The NW-TT port forwards the received Announce messages from N6 interface to
NW-TT.
The NW-TT maintains the PTP port state for each DS-TT port and NW-TT port. The
PTP port states may be determined by NW-TT either via:
\- Method a), BMCA procedure.
\- Method b), local configuration.
When Method b) is used, the following applies:
\- When the PTP GM is external to the 5GS, for one of the NW-TT or DS-TT ports
(per each PTP domain) the PTP port state is Follower and for all other NW-TT
and DS-TT ports of the same PTP domain the PTP port state is set either to
Passive or Leader (depending on implementation).
\- When the 5GS is configured as a grandmaster for a (g)PTP domain for the
connected networks, all NW-TT ports and DS-TT ports are set to Leader state
for that (g)PTP domain.
The local configuration of PTP port states in DS-TT and NW-TT for Method b is
described in clause K.2.
When the Method a) is used (PTP port states are determined by BMCA procedure),
the NW-TT needs to process the received Announce messages (from NW-TT port(s)
and over user plane from the DS-TT(s)) for BMCA procedure, determine port
states within the 5GS, and maintain the Leader-Follower hierarchy.
The DS-TT maintains the Disabled, Initializing and Faulty (if applicable)
state for the PTP ports in DS-TT. While in Disabled, Initializing or Faulty
state, the port in the DS-TT discards any (g)PTP messages it may receive from
the upstream PTP instance or from the NW-TT via user plane.
When the 5GS Clock is determined as a grandmaster for a (g)PTP domain, the
Announce messages are distributed as described in clause 5.27.1.7.
When the grandmaster is external to the 5GS, the NW-TT regenerates the
Announce messages based on the Announce messages received from Follower port
in NW-TT or DS-TT for the Leader ports in NW-TT and DS-TT(s). The NW-TT/UPF
forwards the regenerated Announce messages to the PDU session(s) related to
the Leader ports in the DS-TT(s).
NOTE 1: The TSN AF or TSCTSF can use the portDS.portState in the \"Time
synchronization information for each DS-TT port\" element in UMIC to read and
get notified for the port state changes for the PTP ports in DS-TT(s), and the
portDS.portState in PMIC to read and get notified for the port state changes
for the PTP ports in NW-TT. Based on the change of the port states, TSN AF or
TSCTSF can determine that an external Grandmaster PTP Instance is found to be
used instead of the GM in 5GS, or the GM in 5GS is selected as the Grandmaster
PTP Instance, and TSN AF or TSCTSF can disable or enable the (g)PTP
grandmaster functionality in DS-TT(s), respectively.
NOTE 2: The TSN AF or TSCTSF can use the portDS.portState in PMIC to read and
get notified for the port state changes for the PTP ports in DS-TT for the
port state Disabled, Initializing or Faulty (if applicable). The TSCTSF or TSN
AF can use the portDS.portEnable to indicate to the NW-TT that the DS-TT port
is disabled. This avoids unnecessary (g)PTP traffic over User Plane to a DS-TT
port in Disabled, Initializing or Faulty state.
#### 5.27.1.7 Support for PTP grandmaster function in 5GS
The 5GS that is configured to operate as a time-aware system or Boundary Clock
may support acting as a PTP grandmaster for a (g)PTP domain.
The configuration of PTP instances in DS-TT and NW-TT for PTP grandmaster
function is described in clause K.2.
The following options may be supported (per DS-TT) for the 5GS to generate the
Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages for the Leader ports on the DS-TT:
a) NW-TT generates the Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages on behalf of DS-
TT (e.g. if DS-TT does not support this).
The NW-TT/UPF forwards the generated Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages to
the PDU session(s) related to the Leader ports on the DS-TT(s). The NW-TT
timestamps the (g)PTP event message when the event message is sent to the PDU
Session, and adds TSi corresponding to the timestamp to the Sync message and
the OriginTimestamp corresponding to the timestamp to Sync message (if one-
step operation is used) or PreciseOriginTimestamp corresponding to the
timestamp to Follow_Up message (if two-step operation is used), and sets the
cumulative rateRatio value with 1. The OriginTimestamp or
PreciseOriginTimestamp shall be set by NW-TT/UPF to the 5GS internal clock.
When DS-TT(s) receive the Sync, Follow_Up messages, it modifies the payload of
the Sync, Follow_Up message as described for the PTP port in the egress TT in
clause 5.27.1.2.2.2.
b) DS-TT generates the Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages in this DS-TT.
The OriginTimestamp or PreciseOriginTimestamp shall be set by DS-TT to the 5GS
internal clock.
In both options, the NW-TT generates the Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages
for the Leader ports on the NW-TT.
#### 5.27.1.8 Exposure of Time Synchronization
5G System supports time synchronization service that can be activated and
deactivated by AF. Exposure of time synchronization comprises the following
capabilities:
\- The AF may learn 5GS and/or UE availability and capabilities for time
synchronization service.
\- The AF controls activation and deactivation of the time synchronization
service for the target UE(s).
The AF may use the service-specific parameters to control the time
synchronization service for targeted UE(s). These parameters are specified in
clause 4.15.9.3 and 4.15.9.4 of TS 23.502 [3] for (g)PTP-based and 5G access
stratum-based time synchronization services, respectively.
The AF may subscribe for 5GS and/or UE availability and capabilities for time
synchronization service. The AF indicates in the request the DNN, S-NSSAI, and
in addition the AF may indicate a list of UE identities or group identity to
limit the subscription only to corresponding UEs. If the AF does not indicate
DNN, S-NSSAI, the NEF determines the DNN, S-NSSAI based on the AF Identifier.
The TSCTSF (directly or via NEF) exposes the 5GS and/or UE availability and
capabilities for synchronization service to the AF as described in clause
4.15.9.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. The exposed information includes the list of user
plane node identities, the list of UE identities and may include the supported
capabilities for (g)PTP time synchronization service per user plane node and
UE.
The AF request to control the (g)PTP time synchronization service is sent to
the TSCTSF (directly or via NEF). The request is targeted to a set of AF-
sessions that are associated with the exposure of UE availability and
capabilities for synchronization service.
The AF may request to use a specific PTP instance type when requesting the
(g)PTP-based time synchronization distribution method (IEEE Std 1588 [126] or
IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] operation (i.e. as a Boundary Clock, peer-to-peer
Transparent Clock, or end-to-end Transparent Clock or as a PTP relay
instance)). The request to control the (g)PTP time synchronization service may
contain other service parameters as specified in Table 4.15.9.3-1 in clause
4.15.9.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
The AF may request to use the 5G access stratum as a time synchronization
distribution method. In this case, the time source is provided by the 5GS.
5G-AN provides the 5GS time to the UE via 3GPP radio access; UE/DS-TT may
provide 5G access stratum timing information to end stations using
implementation specific means. The request to control the 5G access stratum
time distribution (including the parameters such AF requests may contain) is
described in clause 4.15.9.4 of TS 23.502 [3].
The AF or NEF selects the TSCTSF as specified in clause 6.3.24.
The AF request may include a time synchronization error budget (see also
clause 5.27.1.9). The time synchronization error budget defines an upper bound
for time synchronization errors introduced by 5GS.
The AF uses the procedure for configuring the (g)PTP instance in 5GS as
described in clause 4.15.9.3 of TS 23.502 [3] and uses the procedure for
providing the 5G access stratum time distribution as described in clause
4.15.9.4 of TS 23.502 [3] for the UEs.
The TSCTSF uses the Time Synchronization parameters (Table 4.15.9.3-1 in TS
23.502 [3]) as received from the AF (directly or via NEF) to control the
(g)PTP time synchronization service. When IEEE Std 1588 [126] or IEEE Std
802.1AS [104] operation have been selected, the TSCTSF determines the
necessary (g)PTP parameters to activate and control the service in DS-TT(s)
and NW-TTs. For this purpose, the TSCTSF uses the PMIC or UMIC to manage the
IEEE Std 1588 [126] or IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] operation in the DS-TT(s) or NW-
TTs, respectively (see clause 5.27.1.4).
The TSCTSF uses the Time Synchronization parameters (Table 4.15.9.4-1) as
received from the AF (directly or via NEF) to control the 5G access stratum
time synchronization distribution as described in clause 4.15.9.4 of TS 23.502
[3].
For handling (g)PTP traffic, the PCF, according to PCC rule authorization,
chooses a 5QI and dynamically set the PDB and/or MDBV according to
requirements for (g)PTP protocol. The PCF provides the SMF with a PCC rule
generated based on the AF request to control the (g)PTP time synchronization
service. The SMF may take the information in the PCC rule to modify a PDU
Session to create or modify or release a QoS Flow for transmitting the (g)PTP
messages. The PCF acknowledges the policy request to the TSCTSF. The TSCTSF
may report the result of the time synchronization request to the AF (directly
or via NEF).
The AF may provide a temporal validity condition to the TSCTSF (directly or
via NEF) when the AF activates the time synchronization service. Temporal
validity condition contains the start-time and stop-time (in absolute time
value) attributes that describe the time period when the time synchronization
service is active for the targeted AF sessions. The TSCTSF manages the
temporal validity condition as described in clauses 4.15.9.3 and 4.15.9.4 of
TS 23.502 [3].
#### 5.27.1.9 Support for derivation of Uu time synchronization error budget
The AF may request a specific time synchronization error budget when
requesting a time synchronization service employing the (g)PTP-based or 5G
access stratum-based time distribution method. If the AF includes a time
synchronization error budget in its request, the TSCTSF uses it to derive an
error budget available for the NG-RAN to provide the 5G access stratum time
via the Uu interface to each targeted UE (referred to as Uu time
synchronization error budget hereafter).
To derive the Uu time synchronization error budget for each targeted UE, the
TSCTSF takes the following into account:
\- selected time synchronization distribution method ( i.e.5G access stratum-
based time distribution or (g)PTP-based time distribution);
\- in the case of the (g)PTP-based time distribution:
\- whether 5GS operates as a boundary clock and acts as a GM;
\- whether a clock connected to the DS-TT/NW-TT acts as a GM;
\- PTP port states;
\- a CN part and a Device part of the time synchronization error budget (both
parts may be predefined at the TSCTSF, or calculated by the 5GS using the
implementation-specific means).
If the AF does not include a time synchronization error budget, the TSCTSF
uses a preconfigured time synchronization error budget to derive the Uu time
synchronization error budget. TheTSCTSF provides a 5G access stratum time
distribution indication and the derived Uu time synchronization error budget
to NG-RAN as described in clause 4.15.9.4 of TS 23.502 [3]. Based on this, NG-
RAN provides the 5G access stratum time to the UE according to the Uu
interface time synchronization error budget as provided by the TSCTSF (if
supported by UE and NG-RAN). During Handover, Service Request, mobility
registration and AM policy modification procedure, the AMF may provide the 5G
access stratum time distribution indication and the Uu time synchronization
error budget to NG-RAN as described in clause 4.15.9.4 of TS 23.502 [3], if
needed.
NOTE: This release of the specification assumes that deployments ensure that
the targeted UEs and the NG-RAN nodes serving those UEs support Rel-17
propagation delay compensation as defined in TS 38.300 [27].
### 5.27.1a Periodic deterministic communication
This clause describes 5G System features that allow support of periodic
deterministic communication where the traffic characteristics are known
a-priori, and a schedule for transmission from the UE to a downstream node, or
from the UPF to an upstream node is provided via external protocols outside
the scope of 3GPP (e.g. IEEE 802.1 TSN).
The features include the following:
\- Providing TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI) that describe TSC flow traffic
characteristics (as described in clause 5.27.2) at the gNB ingress and the
egress of the UE for traffic in downlink and uplink direction, respectively;
\- Support for hold & forward buffering mechanism (see clause 5.27.4) in DS-TT
and NW-TT to de-jitter flows that have traversed the 5G System.
### 5.27.2 TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI) and TSC Assistance Container
(TSCAC)
#### 5.27.2.1 General
TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI) is defined in Table 5.27.2-1 and describes
TSC traffic characteristics for use in the 5G System. TSCAI may be used by the
5G-AN, if provided by SMF. The knowledge of TSC traffic pattern is useful for
5G-AN as it allows more efficiently scheduling of QoS Flows that have a
periodic, deterministic traffic characteristics either via Configured Grants,
Semi-Persistent Scheduling or with Dynamic Grants.
The TSCTSF determines the TSC Assistance Container (defined in Table 5.27.2-2)
based on information provided by an AF/NEF as described in clause 5.27.2.3 and
provides it to the PCF for IP type and Ethernet type PDU Sessions. In the case
of integration with IEEE TSN network, the TSN AF determines TSC Assistance
Container as described in clause 5.27.2.2 and provides it to the PCF for
Ethernet PDU Sessions. The PCF receives the TSC Assistance Container from the
TSCTSF or the TSN AF and forwards it to the SMF as part of PCC rule as
described in clause 6.1.3.23a of TS 23.503 [45].
The SMF binds a PCC rule with a TSC Assistance Container to a QoS Flow as
described in clause 6.1.3.2.4 of TS 23.503 [45]. The SMF uses the TSC
Assistance Container to derive the TSCAI for that QoS Flow and sends the
derived TSCAI to the NG-RAN. The Periodicity, Burst Arrival Time, and Survival
Time components of the TSCAI are specified by the SMF with respect to the 5G
clock. The SMF is responsible for mapping the Burst Arrival Time and
Periodicity from an external clock (when available) to the 5G clock based on
the time offset and cumulative rateRatio (when available) between the external
clock time and 5GS time as measured and reported by the UPF. The SMF
determines the TSCAI as described in clause 5.27.2.4.
A Survival Time, which indicates the time period an application can survive
without any data burst, may be provided by TSN AF/AF either in terms of
maximum number of messages (message is equivalent to all packets of a data
burst) or in terms of time units. Only a single data burst is expected within
a single time period referred to as the periodicity.
The SMF may send an update of the TSCAI to the NG-RAN as defined in clauses
4.3.3.2, 4.9.1.2.2 and 4.9.1.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
Table 5.27.2-1: TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI)
Assistance Information Description
* * *
Flow Direction The direction of the TSC flow (uplink or downlink). Periodicity
It refers to the time period between start of two data bursts. Burst Arrival
Time (optional) The latest possible time when the first packet of the data
burst arrives at either the ingress of the RAN (downlink flow direction) or
the egress of the UE (uplink flow direction). Survival Time (optional)
Survival Time, as defined in TS 22.261 [2], refers to the time period an
application can survive without any data burst.
Table 5.27.2-2: TSC Assistance Container (TSCAC)
Assistance Information Description
* * *
Flow Direction The direction of the TSC flow (uplink or downlink). Periodicity
It refers to the time period between start of two data bursts. Burst Arrival
Time (optional) The time when the first packet of the data burst arrives at
the ingress port of 5GS for a given flow direction (DS-TT for uplink, NW-TT
for downlink). Survival Time (optional) It refers to the time period an
application can survive without any data burst, as defined in TS 22.261 [2].
Time Domain (optional) The (g)PTP domain of the TSC flow.
#### 5.27.2.2 TSC Assistance Container determination based on PSFP
In the case of integration with IEEE TSN network, the TSN AF determines a TSC
Assistance Container (defined in Table 5.27.2-2) and provides it to the PCF.
The determination of TSC Assistance Container based on Per-Stream Filtering
and Policing (PSFP) information applies only to Ethernet type PDU Sessions.
NOTE 1: This clause assumes that PSFP information as defined in IEEE Std
802.1Q [98] and Table K.1-1 is provided by CNC. PSFP information may be
provided by CNC if TSN AF has declared PSFP support to CNC. TSN AF indicates
the support for PSFP to CNC only if all the DS-TT and NW-TT ports of the 5GS
Bridge have indicated support of PSFP. Means to derive the TSC Assistance
Container if PSFP is not supported by 5GS and/or the CNC are beyond the scope
of this specification.
The TSN AF may be able to identify the ingress port and thereby the PDU
Session as described in clause 5.28.2.
The TSN AF interfaces towards the CNC for the PSFP (IEEE Std 802.1Q [98])
managed objects that correspond to the PSFP functionality implemented by the
DS-TT and the NW-TT. Thus, when PSFP information is provided by the CNC, the
TSN AF may extract relevant parameters from the PSFP configuration. The TSN AF
calculates traffic pattern parameters (such as burst arrival time with
reference to the ingress port and periodicity). TSN AF also obtains the flow
direction as specified in clause 5.28.2. Survival Time may be pre-configured
in TSN AF.
TSN AF may enable aggregation of TSN streams if the TSN streams belong to the
same traffic class, terminate in the same egress port and have the same
periodicity and compatible Burst arrival time. When Survival Time information
is provided for a TSN stream, then it should not be aggregated with other TSN
streams into a single QoS Flow, or if they are aggregated, then the Survival
Time parameter shall not be provided. One set of parameters and one TSC
Assistance Container are created by the TSN AF for multiple TSN streams to
enable aggregation of TSN streams to the same QoS Flow.
Annex I describe how the traffic pattern information is determined.
NOTE 2: Further details of aggregation of TSN streams (including determination
of burst arrival times that are compatible so that TSN streams can be
aggregated) are left for implementation.
NOTE 3: In order for the TSN AF to get Burst Arrival Time, Periodicity on a
per TSN stream basis, support for IEEE Std 802.1Q [98] (as stated in clause
4.4.8.2) Per-Stream Filtering and Policing (PSFP) with stream gate operation
is a prerequisite.
For a UE-UE TSC stream, the (TSN) AF divides the stream into one uplink stream
and one or more downlink streams as defined in clause 5.28.2. The TSN AF binds
the uplink and downlink streams to the PDU Sessions, and provides the streams
on AF Session basis to the PCF(s). The TSN AF calculates traffic pattern
parameters for the UL and the DL stream using the PSFP configuration (if
provided) respectively:
\- For the uplink stream, the Flow Direction is set to uplink and traffic
pattern parameters (such as burst arrival time with reference to the ingress
port and periodicity) is determined as described in Annex I.
\- For downlink stream, the Flow Direction is set to downlink, the burst
arrival time is set to sum of burst arrival time of the UL stream and 5GS
Bridge delay of PDU Session carrying the UL stream, and the periodicity is
determined as described in Annex I.
#### 5.27.2.3 TSC Assistance Container determination by TSCTSF
The TSCTSF constructs TSC Assistance Container (defined in Table 5.27.2-2)
based on information provided (directly or via NEF) by the AF for IP or
Ethernet type PDU Sessions.
The AF may provide Flow Direction, Burst Arrival Time (optional) at the UE/DS-
TT (uplink) or UPF/NW-TT (downlink), Maximum Burst Size, Periodicity, Survival
Time (optional), and a Time Domain (optional) to the TSCTSF. Based on these
parameters, the TSCTSF constructs a TSC Assistance Container and provides it
to PCF. If the AF provides to the TSCTSF a Burst Arrival Time or Periodicity
without corresponding Time Domain, the TSCTSF sets the Time Domain = \"5GS\"
in the TSC Assistance Container.
NOTE: The Maximum Burst Size is signalled separately, i.e. it is not part of
the TSC Assistance Container.
The AF provides these parameters to the NEF and the NEF forwards these
parameters to the TSCTSF. The AF trusted by the operator provides these
parameters to the TSCTSF directly.
The TSCTSF sends the TSC Assistance Container to the PCF as follows:
\- The TSCTSF uses the UE IP address/DS-TT port MAC address to identify the
PCF and N5 association related to the PDU Session of a UE/DS-TT.
#### 5.27.2.4 TSCAI determination based on TSC Assistance Container
The SMF determines the TSCAI (defined in Table 5.27.2-1) for the QoS Flow
based on the TSC Assistance Container of the PCC rule bound to the QoS Flow.
This clause is applicable irrespective of whether the TSC Assistance Container
is determined by the TSN AF or by the TSCTSF.
The Burst Arrival Time and Periodicity component of the TSCAI that the SMF
sends to the 5G-AN are specified with respect to the 5G clock. The SMF is
responsible for mapping the Burst Arrival Time and Periodicity in the TSC
Assistance Container from an external clock to the 5G clock based on the time
offset and cumulative rateRatio (when available) between external time and 5GS
time as measured and reported by the UPF. The SMF may correct the TSCAI based
on the UPF report for time offset and cumulative rateRatio between external
PTP time and 5GS time as measured and reported by the UPF.
The TSCAI parameter determination in SMF is done as follows:
\- For traffic in downlink direction, the SMF corrects the Burst Arrival Time
in the TSC Assistance Container based on the latest received time offset
measurement from the UPF and sets the TSCAI Burst Arrival Time as the sum of
the corrected value and CN PDB as described in clause 5.7.3.4, representing
the latest possible time when the first packet of the data burst arrives at
the AN.
\- For traffic in uplink direction, the SMF corrects the Burst Arrival Time in
the TSC Assistance Container based on the latest received time offset
measurement from the UPF and sets the TSCAI Burst Arrival Time as the sum of
the corrected value and UE-DS-TT Residence Time, representing the latest
possible time when the first packet of the data burst arrives at the egress of
the UE. How the SMF corrects the Burst Arrival Time if the UE-DS-TT Residence
Time has not been provided by the UE is up to SMF implementation.
\- The SMF corrects the Periodicity in the TSC Assistance Container using the
cumulative rateRatio if the cumulative rateRatio was previously received from
the UPF and sets the TSCAI Periodicity as the corrected value. Otherwise, the
SMF sets the received Periodicity in the TSCAI without any correction.
\- The SMF sets the TSCAI Flow Direction as the Flow Direction in the TSC
Assistance Container.
\- If Survival Time is provided in terms of maximum number of messages, the
SMF converts maximum number of messages into time units by multiplying its
value by the TSCAI Periodicity, and sets the TSCAI Survival Time to the
calculated value. If Survival Time is provided in time units, the SMF corrects
the Survival Time using the cumulative rateRatio if the cumulative rateRatio
was previously received from the UPF and sets the TSCAI Survival Time to the
corrected value. Otherwise, SMF sets the TSCAI Survival Time without
correction.
Depending on whether the Time Domain is provided in the TSC Assistance
container, SMF may perform the following:
\- the SMF provisions the UPF/NW-TT to report the clock drifting between 5G
clock and the external GM clock for the (g)PTP time domain number that is
configured to the NW-TT.
\- the SMF provisions the UPF/NW-TT to report the clock drifting between 5G
clock and the external GM clock for the given Time Domain number.
The SMF uses the N4 Association Setup or Update procedures as described in
clause 4.4.3 of TS 23.502 [3] to provision the UPF to report the clock
drifting.
If the SMF has clock drift information for a Time Domain and if the Time
Domain matches with the Time Domain in the TSC Assistance Container (i.e.
clock drift between 5G timing and AF supplied Time Domain determined based on
UPF reporting), or Time Domain information is not provided in the TSC
Assistance Container, then the SMF may adjust the TSCAI information so that it
reflects the 5GS Clock as described in clause 5.27.2.1.
If the SMF does not have synchronization information for a requested Time
Domain in the TSC Assistance Container, or the Time Domain in the TSC
Assistance Container is set to a value = \"5GS\", then the TSCAI information
will be used without adjustment.
In the case of drift between external GM clock and 5G clock, the UPF updates
the offset to SMF using the N4 Report Procedure as defined in clause 4.4.3.4
of TS 23.502 [3]. If the cumulative rateRatio is available and in the case of
change of cumulative rateRatio between external PTP time and 5G time, the UPF
updates the cumulative rateRatio to SMF using the N4 Report Procedure as
defined in clause 4.4.3.4 of TS 23.502 [3]. The SMF may then trigger a PDU
Session Modification as defined in clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3] in order to
update the TSCAI to the NG-RAN without requiring AN or N1 specific signalling
exchange with the UE.
NOTE 4: In order to prevent frequent updates from the UPF, the UPF sends the
offset or the cumulative rateRatio only when the difference between the
current measurement and the previously reported measurement is larger than a
threshold as described in clause 4.4.3.4 of TS 23.502 [3].
### 5.27.3 Support for TSC QoS Flows
TSC QoS Flows use a Delay-critical GBR resource type and TSC Assistance
Information. TSC QoS Flows may use standardized 5QIs, pre-configured 5QIs or
dynamically assigned 5QI values (which requires signalling of QoS
characteristics as part of the QoS profile) as specified in clause 5.7.2. For
each instance of Periodicity, within each Period (defined by periodicity
value), TSC QoS Flows are required to transmit only one burst of maximum size
MDBV within the 5G-AN PDB. Known QoS Flow traffic characteristics provided in
the TSCAI may be used to optimize scheduling in the 5GS.
The following is applicable for the QoS profile defined for TSC QoS Flows:
1\. The TSC Burst Size may be used to set the MDBV as follows:
The maximum TSC Burst Size is considered as the largest amount of data within
a time period that is equal to the value of 5G-AN PDB of the 5QI. The maximum
value of TSC Burst Size should be mapped to a 5QI with MDBV that is equal or
higher. When integration with IEEE TSN applies, this 5QI also shall have a PDB
value that satisfies the bridge delay capabilities (see clause 5.27.5 for more
details) reported for the corresponding traffic class. For TSC QoS Flows, the
Maximum Burst Size of the aggregated TSC streams to be allocated to this QoS
Flow can be similarly mapped to a 5QI with MDBV value that is equal or higher.
2\. The PDB is explicitly divided into 5G-AN PDB and CN PDB as described in
clause 5.7.3.4. Separate delay budgets are necessary for calculation of
expected packet transmit times on 5G System interfaces. For the TSC QoS Flow,
the5G-AN PDB is set to value of 5QI PDB minus the CN PDB as described in
clause 5.7.3.4. The CN PDB may be static value or dynamic value and is up to
the implementation of 5GS bridge.
3\. When integration with IEEE TSN applies, the Maximum Flow Bitrate
calculated by the TSN AF as per Annex I.1 may be used to set GBR. In this
case, MBR is set equal to GBR.
4\. ARP is set to a pre-configured value.
5\. 5QI value is derived using QoS mapping tables and TSN QoS information as
described in clause 5.28.4 in the case of integration with IEEE TSN network,
or using QoS Reference parameters and Requested PDB, Burst Size, Priority
parameters as described in clause 4.15.6.6 or clause 4.15.6.6a of TS 23.502
[3] in the case of AF requested Time Sensitive Communication.
### 5.27.4 Hold and Forward Buffering mechanism
DS-TT ports and NW-TT ports support a hold and forward mechanism to schedule
traffic as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018 [98] if 5GS is to participate
transparently as a bridge in a TSN network. That is, the hold and forward
buffering mechanism in this release of the specification provides externally
observable behaviour identical to scheduled traffic with up to eight queues
(clause 8.6.8.4 in IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018 [98]) and with protected windows
(Annex Q.2 in IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018 [98]). Frames are only transmitted from a
given buffer according to the open time interval of the corresponding
transmission gate; otherwise, frames are hold back (which corresponds to a
closed transmission gate). The protected windows scheme implies that only a
single transmission gate is open at any single time. Thus, the Hold and
Forward buffering mechanism allows PDB based 5GS QoS to be used for TSC
traffic.
For Ethernet frames that contain a VLAN tag, DS-TT and NW-TT determine the
priority based on the PCP value contained in the VLAN tag. For Ethernet frames
that do not contain a VLAN tag, DS-TT and NW-TT apply a priority value of 0.
To achieve externally observable behaviour according to the protected windows
scheme, 5GS provides AdminControlList, AdminBaseTime, AdminCycleTime and
TickGranularity as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q [98] on a per Ethernet port
basis to DS-TT and NW-TT for the hold and forward buffering mechanism as
described in clause 5.28.3.
NOTE: The details of how Hold and Forward buffering mechanism is provided by
the DS-TT and NW-TT is up to implementation.
### 5.27.5 5G System Bridge delay
This clause applies if 5GS is integrated as a bridge into an IEEE TSN network.
In order for the 5G System to participate as a TSN bridge according to
transmission gate schedules specified, the 5GS Bridge is required to provide
Bridge Delays as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Qcc [95] for each port pair and
traffic class of the 5GS bridge to an IEEE 802.1 TSN system. In order to
determine 5GS Bridge Delays, the following components are needed:
1\. UE-DS-TT Residence Time.
2\. Per traffic class minimum and maximum delays between the UE and the
UPF/NW-TT that terminates the N6 interface (including UPF and NW-TT residence
times), independent of frame length that a given 5GS deployment supports. The
per-traffic class delays between the UE and the UPF/NW-TT are pre-configured
in the TSN AF (see clause 5.28.4).
The TSN AF calculates the 5GS independentDelayMin and independentDelayMax
values for each port pair and for each traffic class using the above
components. If the UE-DS-TT Residence Time has not been provided by the UE,
then the TSN AF uses a locally configured minimum UE-DS-TT Residence Time for
the calculation of independentDelayMin and a locally configured maximum UE-DS-
TT Residence Time for the calculation of independentDelayMax.
The dependentDelayMin and dependentDelayMax for 5GS Bridge specify the time
range for a single octet of an Ethernet frame to transfer from ingress to
egress and include the time to receive and store each octet of the frame,
which depends on the link speed of the ingress Port as per IEEE Std 802.1Qcc
[95].
NOTE: Further details how TSN AF determines dependentDelayMin and
dependentDelayMax are up to implementation.
Since residence times may vary among UEs and per traffic class delay between
the UE and the UPF/NW-TT may vary among UPFs, the 5GS Bridge Delay is
determined after the PDU Session Establishment for the corresponding UPF and
the UE by the TSN AF. The TSN AF deduces the related port pair(s) from the
port number of the DS-TT Ethernet port and port number of the NW-TT Ethernet
port(s) of the same 5GS Bridge when the TSN AF receives the 5GS Bridge
information for a newly established PDU Session and calculates the bridge
delays per port pair. Additionally, TSN AF deduces the port pair(s) consisting
of two DS-TT ports connecting to the same 5GS bridge and determines the 5GS
bridge delay as sum of bridge delays related to PDU Sessions of two DS-TT
ports.
## 5.28 Support of integration with TSN, Time Sensitive Communications and
Time Synchronization
### 5.28.1 5GS bridge management for TSN
5GS acts as a Layer 2 Ethernet Bridge. When integrated with IEEE TSN network,
5GS functions acts as one or more TSN Bridges of the TSN network. The 5GS
Bridge is composed of the ports on a single UPF (i.e. PSA) side, the user
plane tunnel between the UE and UPF, and the ports on the DS-TT side. For each
5GS Bridge of a TSN network, the port on NW-TT support the connectivity to the
TSN network, the ports on DS-TT side are associated to the PDU Session
providing connectivity to the TSN network.
The granularity of the 5GS TSN bridge is per UPF for each network instance or
DNN/S-NSSAI. The bridge ID of the 5GS TSN bridge is bound to the UPF ID of the
UPF as identified in TS 23.502 [3]. The TSN AF stores the binding relationship
between a port on UE/DS-TT side and a PDU Session during reporting of 5GS TSN
bridge information. The TSN AF also stores the information about ports on the
UPF/NW-TT side. The UPF/NW-TT forwards traffic to the appropriate egress port
based on the traffic forwarding information. From the TSN AF point of view, a
5GS TSN bridge has a single NW-TT entity within UPF and the NW-TT may have
multiple ports that are used for traffic forwarding.
NOTE 1: How to realize single NW-TT entity within UPF is up to implementation.
NOTE 2: Ethernet PDU Session type in this release of the specification may be
subject to the constraint that it supports a single N6 interface in a UPF
associated with the N6 Network Instance.
There is only one PDU Session per DS-TT port for a given UPF. All PDU Sessions
which connect to the same TSN network via a specific UPF are grouped into a
single 5GS bridge. The capabilities of each port on UE/DS-TT side and UPF/NW-
TT side are integrated as part of the configuration of the 5GS Bridge and are
notified to TSN AF and delivered to CNC for TSN bridge registration and
modification.
NOTE 3: It is assumed that all PDU Sessions which connect to the same TSN
network via a specific UPF are handled by the same TSN AF.
Figure 5.28.1-1: Per UPF based 5GS bridge
NOTE 4: If a UE establishes multiple PDU Sessions terminating in different
UPFs, then the UE is represented by multiple 5GS TSN bridges.
In order to support IEEE 802.1Q features related to TSN, including TSN
scheduled traffic (clause 8.6.8.4 in IEEE Std 802.1Q-2018 [98]) over 5GS
Bridge, the 5GS supports the following functions:
\- Configure the bridge information in 5GS.
\- Report the bridge information of 5GS Bridge to TSN network after PDU
Session establishment.
\- Receiving the configuration from TSN network as defined in clause 5.28.2.
\- Map the configuration information obtained from TSN network into 5GS QoS
information (e.g. 5QI, TSC Assistance Information) of a QoS Flow in
corresponding PDU Session for efficient time-aware scheduling, as defined at
clause 5.28.2.
The bridge information of 5GS Bridge is used by the TSN network to make
appropriate management configuration for the 5GS Bridge. The bridge
information of 5GS Bridge includes at least the following:
\- Information for 5GS Bridge:
\- Bridge ID
Bridge ID is to distinguish between bridge instances within 5GS. The Bridge ID
can be derived from the unique bridge MAC address as described in IEEE Std
802.1Q [98], or set by implementation specific means ensuring that unique
values are used within 5GS;
\- Number of Ports;
\- list of port numbers.
\- Capabilities of 5GS Bridge as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Qcc [95]:
\- 5GS Bridge delay per port pair per traffic class, including 5GS Bridge
delay (dependent and independent of frame size, and their maximum and minimum
values: independentDelayMax, independentDelayMin, dependentDelayMax,
dependentDelayMin), ingress port number, egress port number and traffic class.
\- Propagation delay per port (txPropagationDelay), including transmission
propagation delay, egress port number.
\- VLAN Configuration Information.
NOTE 5: This Release of the specification does not support the modification of
VLAN Configuration Information at the TSN AF.
\- Topology of 5GS Bridge as defined in IEEE Std 802.1AB [97]:
\- LLDP Configuration Information.
\- Chassis ID subtype and Chassis ID of the 5GS Bridge.
\- LLDP Discovery Information for each discovered neighbor of each NW-TT port
and DS-TT port.
\- Traffic classes and their priorities per port as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q
[98].
\- Stream Parameters as defined in clause 12.31.1 in IEEE Std 802.1Q [98], in
order to support PSFP:
\- MaxStreamFilterInstances: The maximum number of Stream Filter instances
supported by the bridge;
\- MaxStreamGateInstances: The maximum number of Stream Gate instances
supported by the bridge;
\- MaxFlowMeterInstances: The maximum number of Flow Meter instances supported
by the bridge (optional);
\- SupportedListMax: The maximum value supported by the bridge of the
AdminControlListLength and OperControlListLength parameters.
The following parameters: independentDelayMax and independentDelayMin, how to
calculate them is left to implementation and not defined in this
specification.
DS-TT and NW-TT report txPropagationDelay to the TSN AF relative to the time
base of the TSN GM clock (identified by the TSN time domain number received in
PMIC). If the TSN AF has subscribed for notifications on txPropagationDelay
and if the difference to the previously reported txPropagationDelay is larger
than the txPropagationDelayDeltaThreshold received in PMIC, the corresponding
DS-TT or NW-TT informs the TSN AF about the updated txPropagationDelay using
PMIC signalling.
NOTE 6: Configuration of TSN time domain number and
txPropagationDelayDeltaThreshold via PMIC is optional for NW-TT. NW-TT can
instead be pre-configured with the threshold and the single time domain that
is used by the CNC for bridge configuration and reporting.
Bridge ID of the 5GS Bridge, port number(s) of the Ethernet port(s) in NW-TT
could be preconfigured on the UPF. The UPF is selected for a PDU Session
serving TSC as described in clause 6.3.3.3.
This release of the specification requires that each DS-TT port is assigned
with a globally unique MAC address.
NOTE 7: The MAC address of the DS-TT port must not be used in user data
traffic; it is used for identification of the PDU Session and the associated
bridge port within the 3GPP system.
When there are multiple network instances within a UPF, each network instance
is considered logically separate. The network instance for the N6 interface
(clause 5.6.12) may be indicated by the SMF to the UPF for a given PDU Session
during PDU Session establishment. UPF allocates resources based on the Network
Instance and S-NSSAI and it is supported according to TS 29.244 [65].
DNN/S-NSSAI may be indicated by the SMF together with the network instance to
the UPF for a given PDU Session during PDU Session establishment procedure.
The TSN AF is responsible to receive the bridge information of 5GS Bridge from
5GS, as well as register or update this information to the CNC.
### 5.28.2 5GS Bridge configuration for TSN
The configuration information of 5GS Bridge as defined in clause 8.6.8.4 of
IEEE Std 802.1Q [98], includes the following:
\- Bridge ID of 5GS Bridge.
\- Configuration information of scheduled traffic on ports of DS-TT and NW-TT:
\- Egress ports of 5GS Bridge, e.g. ports on DS-TT and NW-TT;
\- Traffic classes and their priorities.
NOTE 1: In this Release of the specification, scheduled traffic (clause
8.6.8.4 in IEEE 802.1Q-2018 [98]) is only supported with protected windows,
(see clause Q.2 in IEEE 802.1Q [98]), therefore, it is enough to support
AdminControlList, AdminBaseTime, AdminCycleTime and TickGranularity for the
configuration of the 5GS.
The configuration information of 5GS Bridge as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Q
[98], includes the following:
\- Chassis ID of 5GS Bridge;
\- Traffic forwarding information as defined in clause 8.8.1 of IEEE Std
802.1Q [98]:
\- Destination MAC address and VLAN ID of TSN stream;
\- Port number in the Port MAP as defined in clause 8.8.1 of IEEE Std 802.1Q
[98].
\- Configuration information per stream according to clause 8.6.5.1 of IEEE
Std 802.1Q [98] including:
\- Stream filters.
\- Stream gates.
NOTE 2: In order to support clause 8.6.5.1 of IEEE Std 802.1Q [98], it is
required to support the Stream Identification function as specified by IEEE
Std 802.1CB [83].
The SMF report the MAC address of the DS-TT port of the related PDU Session to
TSN AF via PCF. The association between the DS-TT MAC address, 5GS Bridge ID
and port number on DS-TT is maintained at TSN AF and further used to assist to
bind the TSN traffic with the UE\'s PDU session.
Two models are supported to configure 5GS QoS for TSN traffic:
\- Based on the assumption that PSFP information is always provided by CNC: In
this case the QoS Flows are setup based on the PSFP information provided by
CNC;
NOTE 3: PSFP information may be provided by CNC if TSN AF has declared PSFP
support to CNC. TSN AF indicates the support for PSFP to CNC only if each DS-
TT and NW-TT of the 5GS bridge has indicated support of PSFP.
\- Without requiring PSFP information provided by the CNC.: In this case, pre-
configured QoS Flows are used and configured e.g. during PDU session
establishment as described in clause 5.28.4. Additional QoS Flows are setup as
necessary based on the PSFP, if available, as described in this clause.
When PSFP information is available, TSN AF identifies the ingress and egress
port for the TSN stream as described in Annex I and determines the DS-TT port
MAC address(es) identifying the corresponding PDU session(s) carrying the TSN
stream. Flow direction of a TSN stream is determined as follows: if the
ingress port is a DS-TT port, then the Flow direction is UL; otherwise if the
ingress port(s) is (are) NW-TT port, the Flow direction is DL. Flow direction
is part of the TSCAI as defined in clause 5.27.2.
The TSN AF uses the stream filter instances of PSFP information to derive the
service data flow for TSN streams. The TSN AF uses the Priority values in the
stream filter instances in PSFP information (if available) as defined in
clause 8.6.5.1 of IEEE Std 802.1Q [98], the 5GS bridge delay information (see
clause 5.27.5) and may additionally use scheduled traffic information as
defined in clause 8.6.8.4 of IEEE Std 802.1Q [98], to derive the TSN QoS
information (i.e. priority and delay) for a given TSN stream or flow of
aggregated TSN streams as specified in clause 5.28.4.
The TSN AF identifies the egress port(s) for the TSN stream using local
configuration or static filtering entry that matches the TSN stream. If the
TSN AF determines that the TSN stream is for UE-UE communication (i.e. ingress
and egress ports are in DS-TTs), the TSN AF divides the stream into one uplink
stream and one or more downlink streams and provides the streams on AF Session
basis to the PCF(s). The SMF applies local switching as specified in clause
5.8.2.13 or clause 5.8.2.5.3 in order to enable UPF locally forward uplink
stream from one PDU session as downlink stream in another PDU session.
When CNC configures the PSFP information to the TSN AF, TSN AF determines the
TSC Assistance Container as described in clause 5.27.2. The TSN AF associates
the TSN QoS information and TSC Assistance Container (if available) with the
corresponding service data flow description and provides to the PCF and the
SMF as defined in clause 6.1.3.23 of TS 23.503 [45].
NOTE 4: When the TSN stream priority information from PSFP is not available
(priority value in stream filters is set to wild card), in certain
configurations it can be possible to use the scheduled traffic information as
defined in clause 8.6.8.4 of IEEE Std 802.1Q [98] to derive the Priority of
the TSN stream. For example, when there is a single downlink stream for a
given DS-TT port, it can be possible to determine the affected DS-TT port in
the downlink and the associated TSN stream priority based on the scheduled
traffic information of the affected egress port, and to derive an estimated
MDBV based on the gate open interval and the assumed ingress port bitrate.
If TSN AF provides PSFP and/or scheduled traffic information to DS-TT and NW-
TT then DS-TT and NW-TT execute on this information relative to the time base
of the TSN GM clock (identified by the TSN time domain number received in
PMIC).
NOTE 5: Configuration of TSN time domain number via PMIC is optional for NW-
TT. NW-TT can instead be pre-configured with the single time domain that is
used by the CNC for bridge configuration and reporting.
### 5.28.3 Port and user plane node management information exchange in 5GS
#### 5.28.3.1 General
Port number of the DS-TT for the PDU Session is assigned by the UPF during PDU
session establishment. The port number of the DS-TT port for a PDU Session
shall be reported to the SMF from the UPF and further stored at the SMF. The
SMF provides the DS-TT port number via PCF to the TSN AF or TSCTSF. TSN AF or
TSCTSF maintains an association between the DS-TT port number and the DS-TT
port MAC address (with Ethernet type PDU session) or IP address (applicable
for TSCTSF only, with IP type PDU Session) of the UE. If a PDU session for
which SMF has reported a DS-TT port number to TSN AF or TSCTSF is released,
then SMF informs TSN AF or TSCTSF accordingly.
NOTE 1: Port number can refer either to Ethernet port or PTP port. In Ethernet
type PDU Sessions, it is assumed that the PTP port number is the same as the
associated Ethernet port number.
5GS shall support transfer of standardized and deployment-specific port
management information transparently between TSN AF or TSCTSF and DS-TT or NW-
TT, respectively inside a Port Management Information Container. NW-TT may
support one or more ports. In this case, each port uses separate Port
Management Information Container. 5GS shall also support transfer of
standardized and deployment-specific user plane node management information
transparently between TSN AF or TSCTSF and NW-TT, respectively inside a User
Plane Node Management Information Container. Annex K, clause K.1 lists
standardized port management information and user plane node management
information, respectively.
If TSN AF is deployed, i.e. if 5GS is integrated with an IEEE TSN network, the
port and user plane node management information is exchanged between CNC and
TSN AF. The port management information is related to ports located in DS-TT
or NW-TT. The user plane node management information container is related to
5GS bridge management.
If TSN AF is not deployed, the port and user plane node management information
is exchanged between TSCTSF and DS-TT/NW-TT.
NOTE 2: The time synchronization parameters used in Port Management
Information Container and User Plane Node Management Information Container are
from IEEE Std 1588 [126], Edition 2019, and from IEEE Std 802.1AS [104]. Since
the IEEE time synchronization data sets are not exposed, care needs to be
taken when interoperating with devices supporting Edition 2008, IEEE Std
1588-2008 [107] (which can be the case when operating under the SMPTE profile,
ST 2059-2:2015 [127]) and using a common management.
Exchange of port and user plane node management information between TSN AF or
TSCTSF and NW-TT or between TSN AF or TSCTSF and DS-TT allows TSN AF or TSCTSF
to:
1) retrieve port management information for a DS-TT or NW-TT port or user
plane node management information;
2) send port management information for a DS-TT or NW-TT port or user plane
node management information;
3) subscribe to and receive notifications if specific port management
information for a DS-TT or NW-TT port changes or user plane node management
information changes.
4) delete selected entries in the following data structures:
\- \"DS-TT port neighbour discovery configuration for DS-TT port\" in UMIC
using the DS-TT port number to reference the selected entry.
\- \"Stream Filter Instance Table\" in PMIC using the Stream Filter Instance
ID to reference the selected entry.
\- \"Stream Gate Instance Table\" in PMIC using the Stream Gate Instance ID to
reference the selected entry.
\- \"Static Filtering Entries table\" in UMIC using the (MAC address, VLAN ID)
pair to reference the selected entry.
5) delete PTP Instances in a DS-TT port or NW-TT port using the PTP Instance
ID to reference the selected entry as described in clause K.2.2.1.
Exchange of port management information between TSN AF or TSCTSF and NW-TT or
DS-TT is initiated by DS-TT or NW-TT to:
\- notify TSN AF or TSCTSF if port management information has changed that TSN
AF or TSCTSF has subscribed for.
Exchange of user plane node management information between TSN AF or TSCTSF
and NW-TT is initiated by NW-TT to:
\- notify TSN AF or TSCTSF if user plane node management information has
changed that TSN AF or TSCTSF has subscribed for.
Exchange of port management information is initiated by DS-TT to:
\- provide port management capabilities, i.e. provide information indicating
which standardized and deployment-specific port management information is
supported by DS-TT.
TSN AF or TSCTSF indicates inside the Port Management Information Container or
user plane node Management Information Container whether it wants to retrieve
or send port or user plane node management information or intends to
(un-)subscribe for notifications.
#### 5.28.3.2 Transfer of port or user plane node management information
Port management information is transferred transparently via 5GS between TSN
AF or TSCTSF and DS-TT or NW-TT, respectively, inside a Port Management
Information Container (PMIC). User plane node management information is
transferred transparently via 5GS between TSN AF or TSCTSF and NW-TT inside a
user plane node Management Information Container (UMIC). The transfer of port
or user plane node management information is as follows:
\- To convey port management information from DS-TT or NW-TT to TSN AF or
TSCTSF:
\- DS-TT provides a PMIC and the DS-TT port MAC address (if available) to the
UE, which includes the PMIC as an optional Information Element of an N1 SM
container and triggers the UE requested PDU Session Establishment procedure or
PDU Session Modification procedure to forward the PMIC to the SMF. SMF
forwards the PMIC and the port number of the related DS-TT port to TSN AF or
TSCTSF as described in clauses 4.3.2.2 and 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3];
\- NW-TT provides PMIC(s) and/or UMIC to the UPF, which triggers the N4
Session Level Reporting Procedure to forward the PMIC(s) and/or UMIC to SMF.
UPF selects an N4 session corresponding to any of the N4 sessions for this NW-
TT. SMF in turn forwards the PMIC(s) and the port number(s) of the related NW-
TT port(s), or the UMIC, to TSN AF or TSCTSF as described in clause 4.16.5.1
of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 1: There has to be at least one established PDU session for DS-TT port
before the UPF can report PMIC/UMIC information towards the TSN AF or TSCTSF.
\- To convey port management information from TSN AF or TSCTSF to DS-TT:
\- TSN AF or TSCTSF provides a PMIC, DS-TT port MAC address or UE IP address
(applicable for TSCTSF only) reported for a PDU Session (i.e. MAC address of
the DS-TT port or IP address related to the PDU session) and the port number
of the DS-TT port to manage to the PCF by using the AF Session level
Procedure, which forwards the information to SMF based on the MAC or IP
address using the PCF initiated SM Policy Association Modification procedure
as described in clause 4.16.5.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. SMF determines that the port
number relates to a DS-TT port and based on this forwards the PMIC to DS-TT
using the network requested PDU Session Modification procedure as described in
clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
\- To convey port or user plane node management information from TSN AF or
TSCTSF to NW-TT:
\- TSN AF or TSCTSF selects a PCF-AF session corresponding to any of the DS-TT
MAC or IP addresses (applicable for TSCTSF only) for the related PDU sessions
of this bridge and provides a PMIC(s) and the related NW-TT port number(s)
and/or UMIC to the PCF. The PCF uses the PCF initiated SM Policy Association
Modification procedure to forward the information received from TSN AF or
TSCTSF to SMF as described in clause 4.16.5.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. SMF determines
that the included information needs to be delivered to the NW-TT either by
determining that the port number(s) relate(s) to a NW-TT port(s) or based on
the presence of UMIC, and forwards the container(s) and/or related port
number(s) to NW-TT using the N4 Session Modification procedure described in
clause 4.4.1.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
#### 5.28.3.3 VLAN Configuration Information for TSN
The CNC obtains the 5GS bridge VLAN configuration from TSN AF according to
clause 12.10.1.1 of IEEE Std 802.1Q [98]. The TSN AF and UPF/NW-TT are pre-
configured with same 5GS bridge VLAN configuration.
NOTE: In this Release, the VLAN Configuration Information are pre-configured
at the TSN AF and the NW-TT and is not exchanged between the TSN AF and the
UPF/NW-TT.
### 5.28.4 QoS mapping tables for TSN
The mapping tables between the traffic class and 5GS QoS Profile is
provisioned and further used to find suitable 5GS QoS profile to transfer TSN
traffic over the PDU Session. QoS mapping procedures are performed in two
phases: (1) QoS capability report phase as described in clause 5.28.1, and (2)
QoS configuration phase as in clause 5.28.2
(1) The TSN AF shall be pre-configured (e.g. via OAM) with a mapping table.
The mapping table contains TSN traffic classes, pre-configured bridge delays
(i.e. the preconfigured delay between UE and UPF/NW-TT) and priority levels.
Once the PDU session has been setup and after retrieving the information
related to UE-DS-TT residence time, the TSN AF deduces the port pair(s) in the
5GS bridge and determines the bridge delay per port pair per traffic class
based on the pre-configured bridge delay and the UE-DS-TT residence time as
described in clause 5.27.5. The TSN AF updates bridge delays per port pair and
traffic class and reports the bridge delays and other relevant TSN information
such as the Traffic Class Table (clause 12.6.3 in IEEE Std 802.1Q [98]) for
every port, according to the IEEE Std 802.1Q [98] and IEEE Std 802.1Qcc [95]
to the CNC.
(2) CNC may distribute PSFP information and transmission gate scheduling
parameters to 5GS Bridge via TSN AF, which can be mapped to TSN QoS
requirements by the TSN AF.
The PCF mapping table provides a mapping from TSN QoS information (see clauses
6.2.1.2 and 6.1.3.23 of TS 23.503 [45]) to 5GS QoS profile. Based on trigger
from TSN AF, the PCF may trigger PDU session modification procedure to
establish a new 5G QoS Flow or use the pre-configured 5QI for 5G QoS Flow for
the requested traffic class according to the selected QoS policies and the TSN
AF traffic requirements.
Figure 5.28.4-1 illustrates the functional distribution of the mapping tables.
Figure 5.28.4-1: QoS Mapping Function distribution between PCF and TSN AF
The minimum set of TSN QoS-related parameters that are relevant for mapping
the TSN QoS requirements are used by the TSN AF: traffic classes and their
priorities per port, TSC Burst Size of TSN streams, 5GS bridge delays per port
pair and traffic class (independentDelayMax, independentDelayMin,
dependentDelayMax, dependentDelayMin), propagation delay per port
(txPropagationDelay) and UE-DS-TT residence time.
Once the CNC retrieves the necessary information, it proceeds to calculate
scheduling and paths. The configuration information is then set in the bridge
as described in clauses 5.28.2 and 5.28.3. The most relevant information
received is the PSFP information and the schedule of transmission gates for
every traffic class and port of the bridge. At this point, it is possible to
retrieve the TSN QoS requirements by identifying the traffic class of the TSN
stream. The traffic class to TSN QoS and delay requirement (excluding the UE-
DS-TT residence time) mapping can be performed using the QoS mapping table in
the TSN AF as specified in TS 23.503 [45]. Subsequently in the PCF, the 5G QoS
Flow can be configured by selecting a 5QI as specified in TS 23.503 [45]. This
feedback approach uses the reported information to the CNC and the feedback of
the configuration information coming from the CNC to perform the mapping and
configuration in the 5GS.
If the Maximum Burst Size of the aggregated TSC streams in the traffic class
is provided by CNC via TSN AF to PCF, PCF can derive the required MDBV taking
the Maximum Burst Size as input. If the default MDBV associated with a
standardized 5QI or a pre-configured 5QI in the QoS mapping table cannot
satisfy the aggregated TSC Burst Size, the PCF provides the derived MDBV in
the PCC rule and then the SMF performs QoS Flow binding as specified in clause
6.1.3.2.4 of TS 23.503 [45].
Maximum Flow Bit Rate is calculated over PSFPAdminCycleTime as described in
Annex I and provided by the TSN AF to the PCF. The PCF sets the GBR and MBR
values to the Maximum Flow Bitrate value.
The Maximum Flow Bit Rate is adjusted according to Averaging Window associated
with a pre-configured 5QI in the QoS mapping table or another selected 5QI (as
specified in TS 23.503 [45]) to obtain GBR of the 5GS QoS profile. GBR is then
used by SMF to calculate the GFBR per QoS Flow. QoS mapping table in the PCF
between TSN parameters and 5GS parameters should match the delay, aggregated
TSC burst size and priority, while preserving the priorities in the 5GS. An
operator enabling TSN services via 5GS can choose up to eight traffic classes
to be mapped to 5GS QoS profiles.
Once the 5QIs to be used for TSN streams are identified by the PCF as
specified in TS 23.503 [45], then it is possible to enumerate as many bridge
port traffic classes as the number of selected 5QIs.
When PSFP information is not available to the TSN AF for a given TSN stream
(e.g. because of lack of PSFP support in the DS-TTs or the NW-TTs, or
exceeding the number of supported table entries for PSFP functions, or because
CNC does not provide PSFP information), the 5GS can support the TSN streams
using pre-configured mapping from stream priority (i.e. PCP as defined in IEEE
Std 802.1Q [98]) to QoS Flows.
## 5.29 Support for 5G LAN-type service
### 5.29.1 General
The service requirements for 5G LAN-type service are specified in TS 22.261
[2].
A 5G Virtual Network (VN) group consists of a set of UEs using private
communication for 5G LAN-type services.
### 5.29.2 5G VN group management
5G System supports management of 5G VN Group identification and membership
(i.e. definition of 5G VN group identifiers and membership) and 5G VN Group
data (i.e. definition of 5G VN group data). The 5G VN Group management can be
configured by a network administrator or can be managed dynamically by AF.
A 5G VN group is characterized by the following:
\- 5G VN group identities: External Group ID and Internal Group ID are used to
identify the 5G VN group.
\- 5G VN group membership: The 5G VN group members are uniquely identified by
GPSI. The group as described in clause 5.2.3.3.1 of TS 23.502 [3] is
applicable to 5G LAN-type services.
\- 5G VN group data. The 5G VN group data may include the following
parameters: PDU session type, DNN, S-NSSAI and Application descriptor,
Information related with secondary authentication / authorization (e.g. to
enable IP address assignment by the DN-AAA).
The Information related with secondary authentication / authorization
corresponds to the procedures described in clause 5.6.6; it allows e.g. the AF
to provide DN-AAA server addressing information and possibly to request the
SMF to get the UE IP address from the DN-AAA server.
In order to support dynamic management of 5G VN Group identification and
membership, the NEF exposes a set of services to manage (e.g.
add/delete/modify) 5G VN groups and 5G VN members. The NEF also exposes
services to dynamically manage 5G VN group data.
A 5G VN group is identified by the AF using External Group ID. The NEF
provides the External Group ID to UDM. The UDM maps the External Group ID to
Internal Group ID. For a newly created 5G VN Group, an Internal Group ID is
determined by the UDM based on implementation specific means.
NOTE 1: The Internal Group ID determined by UDM has to comply with the format
defined in TS 23.003 [19].
The NEF can retrieve the Internal Group ID from UDM via Nudm_SDM_Get service
operation (External Group ID, Group Identifier translation).
An External Group ID for a 5G VN group corresponds to a unique set of 5G VN
group data parameters.
The 5G VN group configuration is either provided by OA&M or provided by an AF
to the NEF.
When configuration is provided by an AF, the procedures described in clause
4.15.6.2 of TS 23.502 [3] apply for storing the 5G VN group identifiers, group
membership information and group data in the UDR, as follows:
\- The NEF provides the External Group ID, 5G VN group membership information
and 5G VN group data to the UDM.
\- The UDM updates the Internal Group ID-list of the corresponding UE\'s
subscription data in UDR, if needed.
\- The UDM updates the Group Identifier translation in the Group Subscription
data with the Internal Group ID, External Group ID and list of group members,
if needed.
\- The UDM stores/updates the 5G VN group data (PDU session type, DNN and
S-NSSAI, Application descriptor, Information related with secondary
authentication / authorization) in UDR.
NOTE 2: It is assumed that all members of a 5G VN group belong to the same UDM
Group ID. The NEF can select a UDM instance supporting the UDM Group ID of any
of the member GPSIs of the 5G VN group.
NOTE 3: Shared data mechanisms as defined in TS 29.503 [122] can be used to
support large 5G VN groups.
If a UE is member of a 5G VN Group, UDM retrieves UE subscription data and
corresponding 5G VN group data from UDR, and provides the AMF and SMF with UE
subscription data with 5G VN group data included.
The PCF generates URSP rules based on 5G VN group data. The PCF retrieves 5G
VN group data from UDR. The PCF(s) that have subscribed to modifications of 5G
VN group data receive(s) a Nudr_DM_Notify notification of 5G VN group data
change from the UDR as defined in TS 29.505 [145]. The PCF receives from the
AMF at the UE Policy association establishment the Internal Group ID(s)
corresponding to a UE, so that PCF identifies the 5G VN group data that needs
to be used to generate URSP rules to the UE. If the PCF is made aware of a
change of UE Internal Group Identifier(s) as defined in TS 29.525 [144] or
change of 5G VN group membership as defined in TS 29.505 [145], or both, the
PCF then may update the URSP rules for the impacted 5G VN group members.
NOTE 4: The proper way to obtain the 5G VN group membership changes of a
specific UE, e.g. if the UE is added to a new 5G VN group, is via the
notification of change of UE Internal Group Identifier(s) from the AMF as
specified in TS 29.525 [144]. The subscription in the UDR is for being
notified about changes in the 5G VN group data and in the 5G VN group
membership of a specific 5G VN group.
An AF may update the UE Identities of the 5G VN group at any time after the
initial provisioning.
The PDU session type, DNN, S-NSSAI provided within 5G VN group data cannot be
modified after the initial provisioning.
In this Release of the specification, the home network of the 5G VN group
members is same.
In this Release of the specification, only a 1:1 mapping between (DNN,
S-NSSAI) combination and 5G VN group is supported.
The PCF delivers 5G VN group configuration information (DNN, S-NSSAI, PDU
session type) to the UE for each GPSI that belongs to a 5G VN group. The 5G VN
group configuration information is delivered in the URSP from the PCF to the
UE using the UE Configuration Update procedure for transparent UE Policy
delivery as described in clause 4.2.4.3 of TS 23.502 [3] and clause 6.1.2.2 of
TS 23.503 [45].
### 5.29.3 PDU Session management
Session management as defined for 5GS in clause 5.6 is applicable to 5G-VN-
type services with the following clarification and enhancement:
\- A UE gets access to 5G LAN-type services via a PDU Session of IP PDU
Session type or Ethernet PDU Session type.
\- A PDU Session provides access to one and only one 5G VN group. The PDU
Sessions accessing to a certain 5G VN group should all anchor at the same
network, i.e. the common home network of 5G VN group members.
\- A dedicated SMF is responsible for all the PDU Sessions for communication
of a certain 5G VN group. SMF selection is described in clause 6.3.2.
NOTE 1: The network is configured so that the same SMF is always selected for
a certain 5G VN group, e.g. only one SMF registers on the NRF with the
DNN/S-NSSAI used for a given 5G VN group.
NOTE 2: Having a dedicated SMF serving a 5G VN does not contradict that
redundancy solutions can be used to achieve high availability.
\- A DNN and S-NSSAI is associated with a 5G VN group.
\- The UE provides the DNN and S-NSSAI associated with the 5G VN group to
access the 5G LAN-type services for that 5G VN, using the PDU Session
Establishment procedure described in clause 4.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
\- During establishment of the PDU Session, secondary authentication as
described in clause 5.6.6 and in clause 4.3.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3], may be
performed in order to authenticate and authorize the UE for accessing the DNN
and S-NSSAI associated with the 5G VN group. Authentication and authorization
for a DNN and S-NSSAI using secondary authentication implies authentication
and authorization for the associated 5G VN group. There is no 5G VN group
specific authentication or authorization defined.
\- The SM level subscription data for a DNN and S-NSSAI available in UDM, as
described in clause 5.6.1, applies to the DNN and S-NSSAI associated to a 5G
VN group.
\- Session management related policy control for a DNN and S-NSSAI as
described in TS 23.502 [3], is applicable to the DNN and S-NSSAI associated to
a 5G VN group. This includes also usage of URSP, for the UE to determine how
to route outgoing traffic to a PDU Session for the DNN and S-NSSAI associated
to a 5G VN group.
\- Session and service continuity SSC mode 1, SSC mode 2, and SSC mode 3 as
described in clause 5.6.9 are applicable to N6-based traffic forwarding of 5G
VN communication within the associated 5G VN group.
\- A PDU Session provides unicast, broadcast and multicast communication for
the DNN and S-NSSAI associated to a 5G VN group. The PSA UPF determines
whether the communication is for unicast, broadcast or multicast based on the
destination address of the received data, and performs unicast, broadcast or
multicast communication handling.
\- During the PDU Session Establishment procedure, the SMF retrieves SM
subscription data related to 5G-VN type service from the UDM as part of the UE
subscription data for the DNN and S-NSSAI.
\- In order to realize N19 traffic routing, the SMF correlates PDU sessions
established to the same 5G VN group and uses this to configure the UPF with
the group level N4-session including packet detection and forwarding rules for
N19 tunnelling forwarding.
### 5.29.4 User Plane handling
User Plane management as defined for 5GS in clause 5.8 is applicable to 5G
LAN-type services with the following clarifications:
\- There are three types of traffic forwarding methods allowed for 5G VN
communication:
\- N6-based, where the UL/DL traffic for the 5G VN communication is forwarded
to/from the DN;
NOTE 1: Optionally a L2TP tunnel can be established over N6 as described in
clause 5.8.2.16.
\- N19-based, where the UL/DL traffic for the 5G VN group communication is
forwarded between PSA UPFs of different PDU sessions via N19. N19 is based on
a shared User Plane tunnel connecting PSA UPFs of a single 5G VN group.
\- Local switch, where traffic is locally forwarded by a single UPF if this
UPF is the common PSA UPF of different PDU Sessions for the same 5G VN group.
\- The SMF handles the user plane paths of the 5G VN group, including:
\- The SMF may prefer to select a single PSA UPF for as many PDU sessions
(targeting the same 5G VN group) as possible, in order to implement local
switch on the UPF.
\- (if needed) Establishing N19 tunnels between PSA UPFs to support N19-based
traffic forwarding.
\- For Ethernet PDU Session, the SMF may instruct the UPF(s) to classify
frames based on VLAN tags, and to add and remove VLAN tags, on frames received
and sent on N6 or N19 or internal interface (\"5G VN internal\"), as described
in clause 5.6.10.2.
NOTE 2: For handling VLAN tags for traffic on N6, TSP ID could also be used as
described in clause 6.2.2.6 of TS 23.503 [45].
Further description on User Plane management for 5G VN groups is available in
clause 5.8.2.13.
When N6-based traffic forwarding is expected, after creation of a 5G VN group
the AF can influence the traffic routing for all the members of the 5G VN
group, by providing information identifying the traffic, DNAI(s) suitable for
selection and an optional indication of traffic correlation together with a 5G
VN External Group ID identifying the 5G VN group in an AF request sent to the
PCF, as described in clause 5.6.7. If the optional indication of traffic
correlation is provided, it means the PDU sessions of the 5G VN group member
UEs should be correlated by a common DNAI in the user plane for the traffic.
The PCF transforms the AF request into policies that apply to PDU Sessions of
the 5G VN group and sends the policies to the SMF. According to the policies,
the SMF (re)selects DNAI(s) for the PDU Sessions and configures their UP paths
to route the traffic to the selected DNAI(s). If the policies include the
traffic correlation indication, the SMF (re)selects a common DNAI for the PDU
Sessions so that the traffic of the 5G VN group is routed to the common DNAI.
NOTE 3: When receiving a new PDU session establishment request for a 5G VN
group, to avoid unnecessary N19 tunnels between UPFs, SMF can check previously
selected UPFs for the same 5G VN group, and decide whether a previously
selected UPF could serve the requested PDU session.
NOTE 4: N19 tunnel(s) can be established between a new UPF and other UPF(s)
that belongs to a 5G VN group when the new UPF is selected for the 5G VN group
during PDU session establishment. The N19 tunnel(s) to a UPF can be released
during or after PDU session release when there is no more PDU sessions for a
5G VN group in that UPF. Establishment or release of the N19 tunnels at the
UPF is performed within a group-level N4 Session.
## 5.30 Support for non-public networks
### 5.30.1 General
A Non-Public Network (NPN) is a 5GS deployed for non-public use, see TS 22.261
[2]. An NPN is either:
\- a Stand-alone Non-Public Network (SNPN), i.e. operated by an NPN operator
and not relying on network functions provided by a PLMN, or
\- a Public Network Integrated NPN (PNI-NPN), i.e. a non-public network
deployed with the support of a PLMN.
NOTE: An NPN and a PLMN can share NG-RAN as described in clause 5.18.
Stand-alone NPN are described in clause 5.30.2 and Public Network Integrated
NPNs are described in clause 5.30.3.
### 5.30.2 Stand-alone non-public networks
#### 5.30.2.0 General
SNPN 5GS deployments are based on the architecture depicted in clause 4.2.3,
the architecture for 5GC with untrusted non-3GPP access (Figure 4.2.8.2.1-1)
for access to SNPN services via a PLMN (and vice versa) and the additional
functionality covered in clause 5.30.2.
Alternatively, a Credentials Holder (CH) may authenticate and authorize access
to an SNPN separate from the Credentials Holder based on the architecture
specified in clause 5.30.2.9. Idle mode mobility is supported as defined in
clause 5.30.2.11. In this Release, direct access to SNPN is specified for 3GPP
access only.
The following 5GS features and functionalities are not supported for SNPNs:
\- Interworking with EPS.
\- Also, emergency services when the UE accesses the SNPN over NWu via a PLMN.
\- Roaming, e.g. roaming between SNPNs. However, it is possible for a UE to
access an SNPN with credentials from a CH as described in clause 5.30.2.9.
\- Handover between SNPNs, between SNPN and PLMN or PNI NPN.
\- CIoT 5GS optimizations.
\- CAG.
\- Proximity based Services (ProSe) as defined in TS 23.304 [128].
\- 5G NSWO.
A UE with two or more network subscriptions, where one or more network
subscriptions may be for a subscribed SNPN, can apply procedures specified for
Multi-USIM UEs as described in clause 5.38. The UE shall use a separate PEI
for each network subscription when it registers to the network.
NOTE: The number of preconfigured PEIs for a UE is limited. If the number of
network subscriptions for a UE is greater than the preconfigured number of
PEIs, the number of network subscriptions that can be registered with the
network simultaneously is restricted by the number of pre-configured number of
PEIs.
#### 5.30.2.1 Identifiers
The combination of a PLMN ID and Network identifier (NID) identifies an SNPN.
NOTE 1: The PLMN ID used for SNPNs is not required to be unique. PLMN IDs
reserved for use by private networks can be used for non-public networks, e.g.
based on mobile country code (MCC) 999 as assigned by ITU [78]).
Alternatively, a PLMN operator can use its own PLMN IDs for SNPN(s) along with
NID(s), but registration in a PLMN and mobility between a PLMN and an SNPN are
not supported using an SNPN subscription given that the SNPNs are not relying
on network functions provided by the PLMN.
The NID shall support two assignment models:
\- Self-assignment: NIDs are chosen individually by SNPNs at deployment time
(and may therefore not be unique) but use a different numbering space than the
coordinated assignment NIDs as defined in TS 23.003 [19].
\- Coordinated assignment: NIDs are assigned using one of the following two
options:
1\. The NID is assigned such that it is globally unique independent of the
PLMN ID used; or
2\. The NID is assigned such that the combination of the NID and the PLMN ID
is globally unique.
NOTE 2: Which legal entities manage the number space is beyond the scope of
this specification.
NOTE 3: The use of SNPN with self-assignment model NID such that the
combination of PLMN ID and NID is not globally unique is not assumed for the
architecture described in Figure 5.30.2.9.3-1, Figure 5.30.2.9.2-1 and for
SNPN - SNPN Mobility as described in clause 5.30.2.11.
The GIN shall support two assignment models:
\- Self-assignment: GINs are chosen individually and may therefore not be
unique. It is defined as in TS 23.003 [19]
\- Coordinated assignment: GIN uses a combination of PLMN ID and NID and is
assigned using one of the following two options as defined in TS 23.003 [19].
1\. The GIN is assigned such that the NID is globally unique (e.g. using IANA
Private Enterprise Numbers) independent of the PLMN ID used; or
2\. The GIN is assigned such that the combination of the NID and the PLMN ID
is globally unique.
NOTE 4: Which legal entities manage the number space for GIN is beyond the
scope of this specification.
An optional human-readable network name helps to identify an SNPN during
manual SNPN selection. The human-readable network name and how it is used for
SNPN manual selection is specified in TS 22.261 [2] and TS 23.122 [17].
#### 5.30.2.2 Broadcast system information
NG-RAN nodes which provide access to SNPNs broadcast the following
information:
\- One or multiple PLMN IDs
\- List of NIDs per PLMN ID identifying the non-public networks NG-RAN
provides access to
NOTE 1: It is assumed that an NG-RAN node supports broadcasting a total of
twelve NIDs. Further details are defined in TS 38.331 [28].
NOTE°2: The presence of a list of NIDs for a PLMN ID indicates that the
related PLMN ID and NIDs identify SNPNs.
\- Optionally:
\- A human-readable network name per SNPN;
NOTE 3: The human-readable network name per SNPN is only used for manual SNPN
selection. The mechanism how human-readable network name is provided (i.e.
whether it is broadcasted or unicasted) to the UE is specified in TS 38.331
[28].
\- Information, as described in TS 38.300 [27], TS 38.331 [28] and in TS
38.304 [50], to prevent UEs not supporting SNPNs from accessing the cell, e.g.
if the cell only provides access to non-public networks;
\- An indication per SNPN of whether access using credentials from a
Credentials Holder is supported;
\- List of supported Group IDs for Network Selection (GINs) per SNPN;
\- An indication per SNPN of whether the SNPN allows registration attempts
from UEs that are not explicitly configured to select the SNPN, i.e. UEs that
do not have any PLMN ID and NID nor GIN broadcast by the SNPN in the
Credentials Holder controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs/GINs.
NOTE 4: Further details (including number of supported GINs per SNPN) are
defined in TS 38.331 [28].
#### 5.30.2.3 UE configuration and subscription aspects
An SNPN-enabled UE is configured with the following information for each
subscribed SNPN:
\- PLMN ID and NID of the subscribed SNPN;
\- Subscription identifier (SUPI) and credentials for the subscribed SNPN;
\- Optionally, an N3IWF FQDN and an identifier of the country where the
configured N3IWF is located;
\- Optionally, if the UE supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a
Credentials Holder:
\- User controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs;
\- Credentials Holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs;
\- Credentials Holder controlled prioritized list of GINs.
\- Protection scheme for concealing the SUPI as defined in TS 33.501 [29];
NOTE: Additionally the UE can be configured with indication to use anonymous
SUCI as defined in TS 24.501 [47].
For an SNPN-enabled UE with SNPN subscription, the Credentials Holder
controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs and GINs may be updated by the
Credentials Holder using the Steering of Roaming (SoR) procedure as defined in
Annex C of TS 23.122 [17]. Updating Credentials Holder controlled prioritized
lists of preferred SNPNs and GINs via the Steering of Roaming (SoR) procedure
is not applicable for Credentials Holder with AAA Server.
A subscription of an SNPN is either:
\- identified by a SUPI containing a network-specific identifier that takes
the form of a Network Access Identifier (NAI) using the NAI RFC 7542 [20]
based user identification as defined in clause 28.7.2 of TS 23.003 [19]. The
realm part of the NAI may include the NID of the SNPN; or
\- identified by a SUPI containing an IMSI.
NOTE 1: As to route network signalling to AUSF and UDM instances serving the
SNPN-enabled UE, the UE can be configured with Routing Indicator locally or
updated with Routing Indicator using the UE Parameters Update via UDM Control
Plane procedure defined in clause 4.20 of TS 23.502 [3]. When the SNPN
credential is stored in the USIM, the Routing Indicator is provisioned in the
USIM, when the SNPN credential is stored in the ME, the Routing Indicator is
provisioned in the ME.
In the case of access to an SNPN using credentials owned by a Credentials
Holder as specified in clause 5.30.2.9.2 and clause 5.30.2.9.3, the SUPI shall
also contain identification for the Credentials Holder (i.e. the realm in the
case of Network Specific Identifier based SUPI or the MCC and MNC in the case
of an IMSI based SUPI). In the case of access to an SNPN using credentials
owned by a Credentials Holder using AAA-S as specified in clause 5.30.2.9.2,
only Network Specific Identifier based SUPI is supported.
NOTE 2: When Credentials Holder is an SNPN, and the MCC and MNC of the SNPN is
not unique (e.g. MCC =999 is used and MNC is not coordinated amongst the
SNPNs), then IMSI based SUPI is not supported as the MCC and MNC need not be
globally unique always; instead USIM credentials are supported using Network
Specific Identifier based SUPI.
NOTE 3: Network Specific Identifier are not supported for the case the
Credentials Holder is provided by a PLMN.
NOTE 4: It is assumed that normally the SNPN and the Credentials Holder use
different PLMN ID. If the SNPN and CHs (where CH can be another SNPN or a
PLMN) share PLMN ID, and IMSI based SUPI is used, then the Routing Indicator
can be used for AUSF/UDM discovery and selection as long as the Routing
Indicator values are coordinated among the involved SNPN and CHs. When the
PLMN ID is not shared between SNPNs and CHs (where CH can be another SNPN or a
PLMN) and IMSI based SUPI is used, then PLMN ID is sufficient to be used for
AUSF/UDM discovery & selection unless the CHs deploys multiple AUSF/UDM in
which case also the Routing Indicator can be used as long as the Routing
Indicator values are coordinated within the CH.
An SNPN-enabled UE that supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a
Credentials Holder and that is equipped with a PLMN subscription may
additionally be configured with the following information for SNPN selection
and registration using the PLMN subscription in SNPN access mode:
\- User controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs;
\- Credentials Holder controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs;
\- Credentials Holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs.
For an SNPN-enabled UE with PLMN subscription, the Credentials Holder
controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs and GINs may be updated by the
Credentials Holder using the Steering of Roaming (SoR) procedure as defined in
Annex C of TS 23.122 [17].
When the Credentials Holder updates a UE with the Credentials Holder
controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs and GINs the UE may perform
SNPN selection again, e.g. to potentially select a higher prioritized SNPN.
#### 5.30.2.4 Network selection in SNPN access mode
##### 5.30.2.4.1 General
An SNPN-enabled UE supports the SNPN access mode. When the UE is set to
operate in SNPN access mode the UE only selects and registers with SNPNs over
Uu as described in clause 5.30.2.4.
Emergency services are supported in SNPN access mode as defined in clause
5.16.4.1.
If a UE is not set to operate in SNPN access mode, even if it is SNPN-enabled,
the UE does not select and register with SNPNs. A UE not set to operate in
SNPN access mode performs PLMN selection procedures as defined in clause 4.4
of TS 23.122 [17]. For a UE capable of simultaneously connecting to an SNPN
and a PLMN, the setting for operation in SNPN access mode is applied only to
the Uu interface for connection to the SNPN. Clause D.4 provides more details.
An SNPN-enabled UE that supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a
Credentials Holder and that is equipped with a PLMN subscription needs to
first enter SNPN access mode to be able to select SNPNs. Once the UE has
entered SNPN access mode, SNPN selection is performed as described in clause
5.30.2.4. Once an SNPN has been selected the UE attempts registration in the
SNPN using the PLMN credentials.
NOTE: Details of activation and deactivation of SNPN access mode are up to UE
implementation.
When a UE is set to operate in SNPN access mode the UE does not perform normal
PLMN selection procedures as defined in clause 4.4 of TS 23.122 [17].
UEs operating in SNPN access mode read the information described in clause
5.30.2.2 from the broadcast system information and take them into account
during network selection.
##### 5.30.2.4.2 Automatic network selection
NOTE 1: If the UE has multiple SNPN subscriptions it is assumed that the
subscription to use for automatic selection is determined by implementation
specific means prior to network selection.
For automatic network selection the UE selects and attempts registration on
available and allowable SNPNs in the following order:
\- the SNPN the UE was last registered with (if available);
\- the subscribed SNPN, which is identified by the PLMN ID and NID for which
the UE has SUPI and credentials.;
\- If the UEs supports access to an SNPN using credentials from a Credentials
Holder then the UE continues by selecting and attempting registration on
available and allowable SNPNs which broadcast the indication that access using
credentials from a Credentials Holder is supported in the following order:
\- SNPNs in the user controlled prioritized list of preferred SNPNs (in
priority order);
\- SNPNs in the Credentials Holder controlled prioritized list of preferred
SNPNs (in priority order);
\- SNPNs, which additionally broadcast a GIN contained in the Credentials
Holder controlled prioritized list of preferred GINs (in priority order);
NOTE 2: If multiple SNPNs are available that broadcast the same GIN, the order
in which the UE selects and attempts a registration with those SNPNs is
implementation specific.
\- SNPNs, which additionally broadcast an indication that the SNPN allows
registration attempts from UEs that are not explicitly configured to select
the SNPN, i.e. the broadcasted NID or GIN is not present in the Credentials
Holder controlled prioritized lists of preferred SNPNs/GINs in the UE.
NOTE 3: If multiple SNPNs are available that broadcast the indication that the
SNPN allows registration attempts from UEs that are not explicitly configured
to select the SNPN, the order in which the UE selects and attempts a
registration with those SNPNs is implementation specific.
When a UE performs Initial Registration to an SNPN, the UE shall indicate the
PLMN ID and NID as broadcast by the selected SNPN to NG-RAN. NG-RAN shall
inform the AMF of the selected PLMN ID and NID.
##### 5.30.2.4.3 Manual network selection
For manual network selection UEs operating in SNPN access mode provide to the
user the list of SNPNs (each is identified by a PLMN ID and NID) and related
human-readable names (if available) of the available SNPNs the UE has
respective SUPI and credentials for. If the UEs supports access to an SNPN
using credentials from a Credentials Holder, the UE also presents available
SNPNs which broadcast the \"access using credentials from a Credentials Holder
is supported\" indication and the human-readable names related to the SNPNs
(if available).
NOTE: The details of manual SNPN selection are defined in TS 23.122 [17].
When a UE performs Initial Registration to an SNPN, the UE shall indicate the
selected PLMN ID and NID as broadcast by the selected SNPN to NG-RAN. NG-RAN
shall inform the AMF of the selected PLMN ID and NID.
#### 5.30.2.5 Network access control
If a UE performs the registration or service request procedure in an SNPN
identified by a PLMN ID and a self-assigned NID and there is no subscription
for the UE, then the AMF shall reject the UE with an appropriate cause code to
temporarily prevent the UE from automatically selecting and registering with
the same SNPN.
If a UE performs the registration or service request procedure in an SNPN
identified by a PLMN ID and a coordinated assigned NID and there is no
subscription for the UE, then the AMF shall reject the UE with an appropriate
cause code to permanently prevent the UE from automatically selecting and
registering with the same SNPN.
NOTE: The details of rejection and cause codes is defined in TS 24.501 [47].
If a UE performs the registration in an SNPN using credentials from a
Credentials Holder and UE is not authorized to access that specific SNPN, then
the UDM can reject the UE which results in AMF rejecting the registration
request from the UE with an appropriate cause code to prevent the UE from
selecting and registering with the same SNPN using credentials from the
Credentials Holder as described in TS 24.501 [47].
In order to prevent access to SNPNs for authorized UE(s) in the case of
network congestion/overload, Unified Access Control information is configured
per SNPN (i.e. as part of the subscription information that the UE has for a
given SNPN) and provided to the UE as described in TS 24.501 [47].
#### 5.30.2.6 Cell (re-)selection in SNPN access mode
UEs operating in SNPN access mode only select cells and networks broadcasting
both PLMN ID and NID of the selected SNPN.
NOTE: Further details on the NR idle and inactive mode procedures for SNPN
cell selection is defined in TS 38.331 [28] and in TS 38.304 [50].
#### 5.30.2.7 Access to PLMN services via stand-alone non-public networks
To access PLMN services, a UE in SNPN access mode that has successfully
registered with an SNPN may perform another registration via the SNPN User
Plane with a PLMN (using the credentials of that PLMN) following the same
architectural principles as specified in clause 4.2.8 (including the optional
support for PDU Session continuity between PLMN and SNPN using the Handover of
a PDU Session procedures in clauses 4.9.2.1 and 4.9.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]) and
the SNPN taking the role of \"Untrusted non-3GPP access\". Annex D, clause D.3
provides additional details.
NOTE: QoS differentiation in the SNPN can be provided on per-IPsec Child
Security Association basis by using the UE or network requested PDU Session
Modification procedure described in clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. In the
PLMN, N3IWF determines the IPsec child SAs as defined in clause 4.12 of TS
23.502 [3]. The N3IWF is preconfigured by PLMN to allocate different IPsec
child SAs for QoS Flows with different QoS profiles.
To support QoS differentiation in the SNPN with network-initiated QoS, the
mapping rules between the SNPN and the PLMN are assumed to be governed by an
SLA including: 1) mapping between the DSCP markings for the IPsec child SAs on
NWu and the corresponding QoS, which is the QoS requirement of the PLMN and is
expected to be provided by the SNPN, and 2) N3IWF IP address(es) in the PLMN.
The non-alteration of the DSCP field on NWu is also assumed to be governed by
an SLA and by transport-level arrangements that are outside of 3GPP scope. The
packet detection filters in the SNPN can be based on the N3IWF IP address and
the DSCP markings on NWu.
To support QoS differentiation in the SNPN with UE-requested QoS, the UE can
request for an IPsec SA the same 5QI from the SNPN as the 5QI provided by the
PLMN. It is assumed that UE-requested QoS is used only when the 5QIs used by
the PLMN are from the range of standardized 5QIs. The packet filters in the
requested QoS rule can be based on the N3IWF IP address and the SPI associated
with the IPsec SA.
Refer to clause D.7 for details on how to support QoS differentiation.
When the UE accesses the PLMN over NWu via a SNPN, the AMF in the serving PLMN
shall send an indication toward the UE during the Registration procedure to
indicate whether an IMS voice over PS session is supported or not.
#### 5.30.2.8 Access to stand-alone non-public network services via PLMN
To access SNPN services, a UE that has successfully registered with a PLMN
over 3GPP access may perform another registration via the PLMN User Plane with
an SNPN (using the credentials of that SNPN) following the same architectural
principles as specified in clause 4.2.8 (including the optional support for
PDU Session continuity between PLMN and SNPN using the Handover of a PDU
Session procedures in clauses 4.9.2.1 and 4.9.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]) and the
PLMN taking the role of \"Untrusted non-3GPP access\" of the SNPN, i.e. using
the procedures for Untrusted non-3GPP access in clause 4.12.2 of TS 23.502
[3]. Annex D, clause D.3 provides additional details. The case where UE that
has successfully registered with a PLMN over non-3GPP access to access SNPN
services is not specified in this Release.
NOTE: QoS differentiation in the PLMN can be provided on per-IPsec Child
Security Association basis by using the UE or network requested PDU Session
Modification procedure described in clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. In the
SNPN, N3IWF determines the IPsec child SAs as defined in clause 4.12 of TS
23.502 [3]. The N3IWF is preconfigured by SNPN to allocate different IPsec
child SAs for QoS Flows with different QoS profiles.
To support QoS differentiation in the PLMN with network-initiated QoS, the
mapping rules between the PLMN and the SNPN are assumed to be governed by an
SLA including: 1) mapping between the DSCP markings for the IPsec child SAs on
NWu and the corresponding QoS, which is the QoS requirement of the SNPN and is
expected to be provided by the PLMN, and 2) N3IWF IP address(es) in the SNPN.
The non-alteration of the DSCP field on NWu is also assumed to be governed by
an SLA and by transport-level arrangements that are outside of 3GPP scope. The
packet detection filters in the PLMN can be based on the N3IWF IP address and
the DSCP markings on NWu.
To support QoS differentiation in the PLMN with UE-requested QoS, the UE can
request for an IPsec SA the same 5QI from the PLMN as the 5QI provided by the
SNPN. It is assumed that UE-requested QoS is used only when the 5QIs used by
the SNPN are from the range of standardized 5QIs. The packet filters in the
requested QoS rule can be based on the N3IWF IP address and the SPI associated
with the IPsec SA.
Refer to clause D.7 for details on how to support QoS differentiation.
When the UE accesses the SNPN over NWu via a PLMN, the AMF in the SNPN shall
send an indication toward the UE during the Registration procedure to indicate
whether an IMS voice over PS session is supported or not.
#### 5.30.2.9 SNPN connectivity for UEs with credentials owned by Credentials
Holder
##### 5.30.2.9.1 General
SNPNs may support UE access using credentials owned by a Credentials Holder
separate from the SNPN. In this case the Session Management procedures (i.e.
PDU Sessions) terminate in an SMF in the SNPN.
When an SNPN supports UE access using credentials assigned by a Credentials
Holder separate from the SNPN, it is assumed that is supported homogeneously
within the whole SNPN.
Credentials Holder using AAA Server for primary authentication and
authorization is described in clause 5.30.2.9.2 and Credentials Holder using
AUSF and UDM for primary authentication and authorization is described in
clause 5.30.2.9.3.
##### 5.30.2.9.2 Credentials Holder using AAA Server for primary
authentication and authorization
The AUSF and the UDM in SNPN may support primary authentication and
authorization of UEs using credentials from a AAA Server in a Credentials
Holder (CH).
\- Only NSI based SUPI is supported and the SUPI is used to identify the UE
during primary authentication and authorization towards the AAA Server. SUPI
privacy is achieved according to methods in clause I.5 of TS 33.501 [29].
\- The AMF discovers and selects the AUSF as described in clause 6.3.4 using
the Home Network Identifier (realm part) and Routing Indicator present in the
SUCI provided by a UE configured as described in clause 5.30.2.3.
\- The AMF selects the UDM in the same SNPN, based on local configuration
(e.g. using the realm part of the SUCI), or using the NRF procedure defined in
clause 4.17.4a of TS 23.502 [3].
\- If the UDM decides that the primary authentication is performed by AAA
Server in CH based on the UE\'s SUPI and subscription data. The Home Network
Identifier, is derived by UDM from the SUCI received from AUSF. If the SUCI
was generated using a privacy protection scheme that requires de-concealment,
UDM de-conceal the SUCI as defined in TS 33.501 [29]. The UDM then instructs
the AUSF that primary authentication by a AAA Server in a CH is required, the
AUSF shall discover and select the NSSAAF, and then forward EAP messages to
the NSSAAF. The NSSAAF selects AAA Server based on the domain name corresponds
to the realm part of the SUPI, relays EAP messages between AUSF and AAA Server
(or AAA proxy) and performs related protocol conversion. The AAA Server acts
as the EAP Server for the purpose of primary authentication.
NOTE 1: The UDM in SNPN, based on SLA between Credentials Holder and SNPN, is
pre-configured with information indicating whether the UE needs primary
authentication from AAA Server.
NOTE 2: It is assumed that the SNPN is configured on per Home Network
Identifier basis to determine whether to perform primary authentication with
AUSF/UDM or AAA server.
\- The AMF and SMF shall retrieve the UE subscription data from UDM using
SUPI.
Figure 5.30.2.9.2-1 depicts the 5G System architecture for SNPN with
Credentials Holder using AAA Server for primary authentication and
authorization.
NOTE 3: The SNPN in Figure 5.30.2.9.2-1 can be the subscribed SNPN for the UE
(i.e. NG-RAN broadcasts SNPN ID of the subscribed SNPN). As a deployment
option, the SNPN in Figure 5.30.2.9.2-1 can also be another SNPN than the
subscribed SNPN for the UE (i.e. none of the SNPN IDs broadcast by NG-RAN
matches the SNPN ID corresponding to the subscribed SNPN). In both cases, the
AUSF, UDM and NSSAAF are configured to support the HNI of the UE\'s SUPI/SUCI,
SUPI privacy settings (when using privacy protection scheme other than the
\'null-scheme\' to generate the SUCI as defined in TS 33.501 [29]),
subscription data of the UE and authentication settings to allow UE
authentication with AAA-S in CH.
Figure 5.30.2.9.2-1: 5G System architecture with access to SNPN using
credentials from Credentials Holder using AAA Server
NOTE 4: The NSSAAF deployed in the SNPN can support primary authentication in
the SNPN using credentials from Credentials Holder using a AAA Server (as
depicted) and/or the NSSAAF can support Network Slice-Specific Authentication
and Authorization with a Network Slice-Specific AAA Server (not depicted).
##### 5.30.2.9.3 Credentials Holder using AUSF and UDM for primary
authentication and authorization
An SNPN may support primary authentication and authorization of UEs that use
credentials from a Credentials Holder using AUSF and UDM. The Credentials
Holder may be an SNPN or a PLMN. The Credentials Holder UDM provides to SNPN
the subscription data.
NOTE 1: A list of functionalities not supported in SNPN is provided in clause
5.30.2.0.
Optionally, an SNPN may support network slicing (including Network Slice-
Specific Authentication and Authorization, Network Slice Access Control and
subscription-based restrictions to simultaneous registration of network
slices) for UEs that use credentials from a Credentials Holder using AUSF and
UDM. The SNPN retrieves NSSAA and NSSRG information from the UDM of the
Credentials Holder.
Figure 5.30.2.9.3-1 depicts the 5G System architecture for SNPN with
Credentials Holder using AUSF and UDM for primary authentication and
authorization and network slicing.
NOTE 2: The architecture for SNPN and Credentials Holder using AUSF and UDM is
depicted as a non-roaming reference architecture as the UE is not considered
to be roaming, even though some of the roaming architecture reference points
are also used, e.g. for AMF and SMF in SNPN to register with and retrieve
subscription data from UDM of the Credentials Holder.

credentials from Credentials Holder using AUSF and UDM
#### 5.30.2.10 Onboarding of UEs for SNPNs
##### 5.30.2.10.1 General
Onboarding of UEs for SNPNs allows the UE to access an Onboarding Network
(ONN) for the purpose of provisioning the UE with SNPN credentials for primary
authentication and other information to enable access to a desired SNPN, i.e.
(re-)select and (re-)register with SNPN.
To provision SNPN credentials in a UE that is configured with Default UE
credentials (see clause 5.30.2.10.2.4), the UE selects an SNPN as ONN and
establishes a secure connection with that SNPN referred to as Onboarding SNPN
(ON-SNPN), see more details in clause 5.30.2.10.2.
NOTE: If the UE is already provisioned with a set of SNPN credentials or
credentials owned by a Credentials Holder and needs to be provisioned with an
additional set of SNPN credentials, the UE can access an SNPN using the
network selection in SNPN access mode as described in clause 5.30.2.4, normal
registration (i.e. not registration for onboarding) and normal PDU Session
(i.e. not a restricted PDU Session used for onboarding) and then leverage the
SNPN\'s User Plane connection to get access to a PVS. The PVS address can be
provided in the same way as when the Onboarding Network is a PLMN.
To provision SNPN credentials in a UE that is equipped with a USIM configured
with PLMN credentials, the UE selects a PLMN as ONN and establishes a secure
connection with that PLMN, see more details in clause 5.30.2.10.3.
After the secure connection is established, the UE is provisioned with SNPN
credentials and possibly other data to enable discovery, (re-)selection and
(re-)registration for a desired SNPN, see more details in clause 5.30.2.10.4.
ON-SNPN and SO-SNPN can be roles taken by either an SNPN or different SNPNs.
It is possible for the same network to be in both roles with respect to a
specific UE.
##### 5.30.2.10.2 Onboarding Network is an SNPN
##### 5.30.2.10.2.1 General {#general-73 .H6}
A UE configured with Default UE credentials may register with an ON-SNPN for
the provisioning of SO-SNPN credentials.
##### 5.30.2.10.2.2 Architecture {#architecture .H6}
Figures 5.30.2.10.2.2-1, 5.30.2.10.2.2-2 and 5.30.2.10.2.2-3 depict the
architecture for Onboarding of UEs in an ON-SNPN.
Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-1: Architecture for UE Onboarding in ON-SNPN when the DCS
includes an AUSF and a UDM
Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-2: Architecture for UE Onboarding in ON-SNPN when the DCS
includes a AAA Server used for primary authentication
Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-3: Architecture for UE Onboarding in ON-SNPN when the DCS
is not involved during primary authentication
NOTE 1: AUSF in the ON-SNPN interfaces with the DCS via NSSAAF as shown in
Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-2 owned by an entity that is internal or external to the
ON-SNPN.
NOTE 2: The functionality with respect to exchange information between PVS and
SO-SNPN to provision SNPN credentials and other data from the SO-SNPN in the
UE is out of 3GPP scope.
NOTE 3: The dotted lines in Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-1, Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-2 and
Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-3 indicate that whether domains (e.g. DCS domain, PVS
domain, and SO-SNPN) are separated depends on the deployment scenario.
NOTE 4: See TS 33.501 [29] for the functionality beyond AUSF, and other
interfaces required for security.
NOTE 5: When secondary authentication is used in the context of the UE
onboarding architecture in Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-3, the same S-NSSAI/DNN or
different S-NSSAI/DNNs can be used for the onboarding PDU Sessions of
different UEs even though the DN-AAA servers that authenticate the UEs can
reside in different administrative domains.
When the DCS is involved during mutual primary authentication during the
Onboarding procedure (as in Figure 5.30.10.2.2-1 and Figure 5.30.10.2.2-2),
the following applies:
\- When the DCS includes an AUSF and a UDM functionality, then the AMF selects
AUSF in the DCS domain. The ON-SNPN and DCS domain are connected via N32 and
SEPP which are not shown in the Figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-1.
\- When the DCS includes a AAA Server functionality, only NSI based SUPI is
supported and the AMF selects AUSF in the ON-SNPN. Based on local
configuration (e.g. using the realm part of the Onboarding SUCI), the AUSF
skips the UDM selection and directly performs primary authentication towards
DCS with AAA Server functionality using Default UE credentials for primary
authentication. The AUSF uses an NSSAAF (and the NSSAAF may use a AAA-P which
is not shown in the figure 5.30.2.10.2.2-2) to relay EAP messages towards the
DCS including a AAA Server. The NSSAAF selects AAA Server based on the domain
name corresponding to the realm part of the SUPI.
NOTE 5: The AMF in ON-SNPN uses the Home Network Identifier of the Onboarding
SUCI to select the DCS. It is assumed that the ON-SNPN is configured on per
Home Network Identifier basis to determine whether to perform primary
authentication with AUSF/UDM or AAA server.
\- Upon establishment of the PDU Session used for User Plane Remote
Provisioning the ON-SNPN may trigger secondary authentication procedure, as
described in clause 4.3.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3], with a DN-AAA using Default UE
credentials for secondary authentication as described in clause I.9.2.4 of TS
33.501 [29].
When the DCS is not involved during primary authentication (as in Figure
5.30.10.2.2-3), the following applies:
\- The AMF selects a local AUSF as described in clause 5.30.2.10.2.6 and
performs primary authentication towards the local AUSF using Default UE
credentials for primary authentication as described in TS 33.501 [29].
\- Upon establishment of the PDU Session used for User Plane Remote
Provisioning the ON-SNPN may trigger secondary authentication procedure, as
described in clause 4.3.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3], with the DCS or with a DN-AAA
server using Default UE credentials for secondary authentication, as described
in clause I.9.2.4 of TS 33.501 [29]. When secondary authentication is used,
the SMF identifies the DCS or the DN-AAA server as defined in clause 4.3.2.3
of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 6: If the secondary authentication fails, the SMF rejects the PDU Session
used for User Plane Remote Provisioning. Based on local policy the AMF can
deregister the UE as described in clause 5.30.2.10.2.7.
NOTE 7: The DCS and PVS can be owned by an administrative entity that can be
different from either the ON-SNPN or SO-SNPN. The ownership of DCS and PVS is
outside the scope of 3GPP.
##### 5.30.2.10.2.3 Broadcast system information {#broadcast-system-
information-1 .H6}
When the SNPN supports Onboarding of UEs for SNPNs (i.e. the SNPN can be used
as ON-SNPN), the NG-RAN node additionally broadcasts the following
information:
\- An onboarding enabled indication that indicates whether onboarding is
currently enabled for the SNPN. The onboarding enabled indication is
broadcasted per cell e.g. to allow start of the onboarding procedure only in
parts of the SNPN.
NOTE: Onboarding enabled indication per cell does not affect mobility
management functions, i.e. once the UE selects the ON-SNPN as described in
clause 5.30.2.10.2.5 and successfully registers within ON-SNPN as described in
clause 5.30.2.10.2.6, the UE can move to a cell of the ON-SNPN not indicating
onboarding support and continue with the remote provisioning as described in
clause 5.30.2.10.4.
##### 5.30.2.10.2.4 UE Configuration Aspects {#ue-configuration-aspects .H6}
A UE enabled to support UE Onboarding, shall be pre-configured with Default UE
credentials, and the UE may be pre-configured with ON-SNPN selection
information. The Default UE credentials consist of credentials for primary
authentication and optionally credentials for secondary authentication, as
described in TS 33.501 clause I.9 [29].
NOTE 1: The content of the ON-SNPN network selection information depends on UE
implementation and can include SNPN network identifiers and/or GIN(s).
The UE uses the ON-SNPN selection information for selection of ON-SNPN (see
clause 5.30.2.10.2.5).
The UE Configuration Data for UP Remote Provisioning is described in the
clause 5.30.2.10.4.2.
NOTE 2: It is assumed that the UE is not pre-configured with a S-NSSAI and DNN
for the purpose of UE onboarding in the ON-SNPN.
NOTE 3: The Default UE credentials for primary authentication are used to
derive a SUPI. When the UE derives the SUPI from the Default UE credentials
for primary authentication, the UE performs specific onboarding procedure as
described in clauses 5.30.2.10.2.5, 5.30.2.10.2.6 and 5.30.2.10.2.7.
##### 5.30.2.10.2.5 Network selection {#network-selection-1 .H6}
This clause applies only when the UE is in SNPN access mode.
When the UE wants to perform UE onboarding via an SNPN, the UE shall perform
ON-SNPN selection as described below. An ON-SNPN is an SNPN providing
onboarding access and enabling remote provisioning for a UE registered for
onboarding as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.4 of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE: The trigger for the UE to initiate the UE Onboarding procedure is UE
implementation dependent (e.g. the trigger can be a power-on event in the UE,
or an input by the user).
For automatic or manual selection, the UE may select and attempt to register
to an ON-SNPN which broadcast the Onboarding enabled indication described in
clause 5.30.2.10.2.3 and matches the pre-configured ON-SNPN selection
information such as SNPN network identifier and/or GIN(s) (if available)
described in clause 5.30.2.10.2.4 according to the UE implementation-specific
logic. If the registration fails, the UE may select and attempt to register to
a different ON-SNPN as defined in clause 4.9.3.1.3 or clause 4.9.3.1.4 of TS
23.122 [17].
##### 5.30.2.10.2.6 Registration for UE onboarding {#registration-for-ue-
onboarding .H6}
When the user or UE has selected an ON-SNPN according to clause 5.30.2.10.2.5,
the UE establishes an RRC connection towards the NG-RAN node of the ON-SNPN.
The UE provides an indication in RRC Connection Establishment that the RRC
connection is for onboarding as defined in TS 38.331 [28]. This indication
allows the NG-RAN node to select an appropriate AMF that supports the UE
onboarding procedures. The UE indicates the ON-SNPN as the selected network,
and the NG-RAN node shall indicate the selected PLMN ID and NID of the ON-SNPN
to the AMF.
NOTE 1: As the configuration information in the UE does not include any
S-NSSAI and DNN used for onboarding, the UE does not include S-NSSAI and DNN
in RRC when it registers for UE onboarding purposes to the ONN.
The UE shall initiate the NAS registration procedure by sending a NAS
Registration Request message with the following characteristics:
\- The UE shall set the 5GS Registration Type to the value \"SNPN Onboarding\"
indicating that the registration request is for onboarding.
\- The UE shall provide a SUCI derived from a SUPI as specified in TS 23.003
[19] and TS 33.501 [29]. The SUPI shall uniquely identify the UE and shall be
derived from the Default UE credentials for primary authentication. The SUPI
used for onboarding may contain an IMSI or a network-specific identifier. The
ON-SNPN may determine the corresponding DCS identity or address/domain, based
on the SUCI (i.e. based on the Home Network Identifier of the SUCI).
The UE does not include a Requested NSSAI in NAS signalling when it registers
for UE onboarding purposes to the ON-SNPN.
The AMF supporting UE onboarding is configured with AMF Onboarding
Configuration Data that includes e.g.:
\- S-NSSAI and DNN to be used for onboarding or a configured SMF for the
S-NSSAI and DNN used for onboarding.
\- Information to use a local AUSF(s) within the ON-SNPN for onboarding of UEs
with a SUCI for a DCS with AAA Server or for onboarding of UEs in the case
where the DCS is not involved during primary authentication.
NOTE 2: The S-NSSAI used for onboarding is assumed to be configured in both
the AMF (i.e. in the AMF Onboarding Configuration Data) and the NG-RAN nodes
for the corresponding Tracking Areas where onboarding is enabled.
When the AMF receives a NAS Registration Request with a 5GS Registration Type
set to \"SNPN Onboarding\", the AMF:
\- starts an authentication procedure towards the AUSF, the authentication
procedure is specified in TS 33.501 [29]. The AMF may be provided with PVS IP
address(es) or PVS FQDN(s) from the DCS during authentication procedure. The
AMF selects an appropriate AUSF as described in clause 6.3.4 based on the Home
Network Identifier of the SUCI used during onboarding or based on local
configuration in the AMF.
\- applies the AMF Onboarding Configuration Data e.g. used to restrict UE
network usage to only onboarding for User Plane Remote Provisioning of UE as
described in clause 5.30.2.10.4.3.
\- stores in the UE context in AMF an indication that the UE is registered for
SNPN onboarding.
Upon successful authentication from AUSF, the AMF informs the UE about the
result of the registration. If the UE is not successfully authenticated, the
AMF shall reject the registration procedure for onboarding, and the UE may
select a different ON-SNPN to attempt to register.
NOTE 3: The AMF does not interact with the UDM of the ON-SNPN or DCS (i.e. for
registration or subscription management purposes) when it receives a NAS
Registration Request with a 5GS Registration Type set to \"SNPN Onboarding\"
(see clause 4.2.2.2.4 of TS 23.502 [3]).
##### 5.30.2.10.2.7 Deregistration from the ON-SNPN for onboarding registered
UE {#deregistration-from-the-on-snpn-for-onboarding-registered-ue .H6}
Once remote provisioning of SO-SNPN credentials is completed, the UE should
initiate deregistration from the ON-SNPN.
Based on ON-SNPN policies, the AMF may start an implementation specific timer
once the UE has registered to the ON-SNPN for the purpose of onboarding.
Expiry of this timer triggers the AMF to deregister the onboarding registered
UE from the ON-SNPN.
The AMF may also deregister the UE when it determines that the PDU Session
used for User Plane Remote Provisioning has been released by the SMF.
When AMF re-allocation occurs for a UE registered for SNPN onboarding during
mobility registration update procedure as described in TS 23.502 [3] in clause
4.2.2.2.4 or during N2 based handover as described in TS 23.502 [3] clause
4.9.1.3, the new AMF supporting SNPN Onboarding should be selected as
described in clause 6.3.5. If the new AMF receives in UE context the
indication that the UE is registered for SNPN onboarding, the new AMF may
start an implementation specific timer for when to deregister the UE when the
new AMF completes the Registration procedure (i.e. sends Registration Accept
to the UE) or completes the N2 based handover procedure.
NOTE: This specific timer is used to prevent onboarding registered UEs from
staying at the ON-SNPN indefinitely.
##### 5.30.2.10.3 Onboarding Network is a PLMN
##### 5.30.2.10.3.1 General {#general-74 .H6}
A UE configured with PLMN credentials in USIM for primary authentication may
register with a PLMN for the provisioning of SO-SNPN credentials.
##### 5.30.2.10.3.2 Network selection and Registration {#network-selection-
and-registration .H6}
This clause applies only when the UE is not in SNPN access mode.
When the UE is using PLMN credentials for accessing a PLMN as the Onboarding
Network (ONN), then regular network selection, as per TS 23.122 [17] and
regular initial registration procedures apply, as per TS 23.502 [3]. After
successfully registering to the ON-PLMN, the UE is provisioned with the SO-
SNPN credentials via User Plane as in clause 5.30.2.10.4.4.
NOTE: When Onboarding network is a PLMN and the UE\'s subscription only allows
for Remote Provisioning, then based on PLMN policies, the AMF can start an
implementation specific timer once the UE has registered to the PLMN. Expiry
of this timer triggers the AMF to deregister the UE from the PLMN. This
specific timer is used to prevent registered UEs that are only allowed for
Remote Provisioning from staying at the PLMN indefinitely.
##### 5.30.2.10.4 Remote Provisioning of UEs in Onboarding Network
##### 5.30.2.10.4.1 General {#general-75 .H6}
Remote Provisioning of UEs that registered with an Onboarding Network enables
provisioning the UE with SNPN credentials for primary authentication and other
information to enable access to the desired SNPN.
Onboarding Services are provided using a PDU Session for DNN and S-NSSAI used
for onboarding allowing remote provisioning of UEs via User Plane. The PDU
Session may be restricted only to be used for Remote Provisioning of the UE.
##### 5.30.2.10.4.2 Onboarding configuration for the UE {#onboarding-
configuration-for-the-ue .H6}
In order to enable UP Remote Provisioning of SNPN credentials for a UE, UE
Configuration Data for User Plane Remote Provisioning are either pre-
configured on the UE or provided by the ONN. UE Configuration Data for User
Plane Remote Provisioning provided by the ONN take precedence over
corresponding configuration data stored in the UE.
UE Configuration Data for User Plane Remote Provisioning consist of PVS IP
address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s).
If the UE does not have any PVS IP address or PVS FQDN after the establishment
of the PDU Session used for User Plane Remote Provisioning, the UE may
construct an FQDN for PVS discovery as defined in TS 23.003 [19].
The UE Configuration Data for User Plane Remote Provisioning may be stored in
the ME.
The UE Configuration Data for User Plane Remote Provisioning (i.e. PVS IP
address(es) or PVS FQDN(s), or both) may be either:
\- locally configured in the SMF of ONN; or
\- provided by the DCS to the AMF of ON-SNPN as part of the authentication
procedure as specified in TS 33.501 [29] and sent by the AMF in the
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext Request message to the SMF
The PVS IP address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s) provided by the DCS take precedence
over the locally configured PVS IP address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s) in the ON-
SNPN.
If the PCF is used for User Plane Remote Provisioning, the SMF provides the UE
Configuration Data to the PCF as described in clause 5.30.2.10.4.3.
The UE Configuration Data for User Plane Remote Provisioning may be provided
to the UE during the establishment of the PDU Session used for User Plane
Remote Provisioning as part of Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) in the PDU
Session Establishment Response.
NOTE: If there are multiple PVS IP addresses and/or PVS FQDNs in the UE, how
the UE uses this information is up to UE implementation.
##### 5.30.2.10.4.3 User Plane Remote Provisioning of UEs when Onboarding
Network is an ON-SNPN {#user-plane-remote-provisioning-of-ues-when-onboarding-
network-is-an-on-snpn .H6}
The AMF selects an SMF used for User Plane Remote Provisioning using the SMF
discovery and selection functionality as described in clause 6.3.2. The
S-NSSAI and DNN of the AMF Onboarding Configuration Data may be used to
discover and select an SMF for User Plane Remote Provisioning. Alternatively,
for SMF selection, the AMF Onboarding Configuration Data may contain a
configured SMF for the S-NSSAI and DNN used for onboarding. The AMF provides
Onboarding Indication to SMF via Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext request
message when a PDU Session used for User Plane Remote Provisioning is
established. During PDU Session establishment for remote provisioning, the AMF
may provide the PVS IP address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s) to the SMF.
When a UPF is selected for User Plane Remote Provisioning, the UPF selection
function described in clause 6.3.3 for normal services is applied considering
the S-NSSAI and DNN used for onboarding.
The SMF or the PCF may store S-NSSAI and DNN information used for onboarding.
Onboarding Configuration Data available to PCF (for details see TS 23.503
[45]) and/or SMF may include PVS FQDN(s) and/or PVS IP address(es). The SMF
and the PCF may use Onboarding Indication and DNN and S-NSSAI used for
onboarding to access the Onboarding Configuration Data.
NOTE: The SMF is aware about the PVS IP address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s) in one
of the following ways: either received from the AMF or retrieved locally from
the Onboarding Configuration Data.
When the UE registered for Onboarding (i.e. 5GS Registration Type is set to
the value \"SNPN Onboarding\") successfully completes the User Plane Remote
Provisioning of SNPN credentials via the Onboarding Network, then the UE
should deregister from the Onboarding Network.
Initial QoS parameters used for User Plane Remote Provisioning are configured
in the SMF when dynamic PCC is not used.
Dynamic PCC may be used for a PDU Session used for User Plane Remote
Provisioning as described in TS 23.503 [45]. If a PCF is used and the AMF
provided an Onboarding Indication, the SMF provides Onboarding Indication to
the PCF when requesting an SM Policy Association. The SMF may provide the UE
Configuration Data (i.e. PVS IP address(es) and/or PVS FQDN(s)) to the PCF
when requesting an SM Policy Association.
The QoS Flows of a restricted PDU Session, which is associated with the
S-NSSAI/DNN used for Onboarding, shall be dedicated to Onboarding Services.
The SMF may configure in the UPF PDR(s) and FAR(s) including PVS and DNS
server IP addresses to block any traffic that is not from or to PVS and DNS
server addresses.
If the UE is registered for Onboarding (i.e. 5GS Registration Type is set to
the value \"SNPN Onboarding\"), the network should apply S-NSSAI and DNN in
the Onboarding Configuration Data for the PDU Session Establishment request
from the UE.
##### 5.30.2.10.4.4 User Plane Remote Provisioning of UEs when Onboarding
Network is a PLMN {#user-plane-remote-provisioning-of-ues-when-onboarding-
network-is-a-plmn .H6}
Subscription data of such a UE shall contain the DNN and S-NSSAI used for
onboarding.
The AMF selects an SMF used for User Plane Remote Provisioning using the SMF
discovery and selection functionality as described in clause 6.3.2,
considering the DNN and S-NSSAI used for onboarding provided by the UE or the
default DNN and S-NSSAI provided by UDM.
The UPF selection function described in clause 6.3.3 is applied, considering
the DNN and S-NSSAI used for onboarding.
The SMF may be configured with one or more PVS FQDN(s) and/or PVS IP
address(es) per DNN and S-NSSAI used for onboarding. When the UE requests a
PDU Session used for User Plane Remote Provisioning by using DNN and S-NSSAI
used for onboarding, the SMF sends the PVS FQDN(s) and/or PVS IP address(es)
associated to the DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU Session to the UE as part of
Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) in the PDU Session Establishment Response
if the following conditions are met:
\- the UE subscription data contains the DNN and S-NSSAI used for onboarding;
and
\- the SMF has obtained the PVS FQDN(s) and/or PVS IP address(es) associated
to the DNN and S-NSSAI of the PDU Session from local configuration; and
\- the UE has requested PVS information via PCO in PDU Session Establishment
Request.
NOTE 1: Local PCC or dynamic PCC can be used as described for PLMNs in TS
23.503 [45] and based on operator policy, PDR(s) and FAR(s) can be configured
to restrict traffic other than provisioning traffic between PVS/DNS server(s)
and UE(s).
NOTE 2: If the UE receives multiple PVS IP addresses and/or PVS FQDNs, how the
UE uses this information is up to UE implementation.
#### 5.30.2.11 UE Mobility support for SNPN
If the UE moves its 3GPP access between SNPN and PLMN, the network selection
is performed as specified in TS 23.122 [17] and UE performs initial
registration as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 1: When the UE moves its 3GPP access between SNPN and PLMN, it is up to
UE implementation to activate/deactivate SNPN access mode.
If the UE moves its 3GPP access between SNPNs, the network selection is
performed as specified in TS 23.122 [17], then the UE performs initial or
mobility registration as specified in clause 4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 2: When the UE moves its 3GPP access between SNPNs, it is up to UE
implementation whether and when to establish again PDU Sessions using existing
mechanism.
### 5.30.3 Public Network Integrated NPN
#### 5.30.3.1 General
Public Network Integrated NPNs are NPNs made available via PLMNs e.g. by means
of dedicated DNNs, or by one (or more) Network Slice instances allocated for
the NPN. The existing network slicing functionalities apply as described in
clause 5.15. When a PNI-NPN is made available via a PLMN, then the UE shall
have a subscription for the PLMN in order to access PNI-NPN.
NOTE 1: Annex D provides additional consideration to consider when supporting
Non-Public Network as a Network Slice of a PLMN.
As network slicing does not enable the possibility to prevent UEs from trying
to access the network in areas where the UE is not allowed to use the Network
Slice allocated for the NPN, Closed Access Groups may optionally be used to
apply access control.
A Closed Access Group identifies a group of subscribers who are permitted to
access one or more CAG cells associated to the CAG.
CAG is used for the PNI-NPNs to prevent UE(s), which are not allowed to access
the NPN via the associated cell(s), from automatically selecting and accessing
the associated CAG cell(s).
NOTE 2: CAG is used for access control e.g. authorization at cell selection
and configured in the subscription as part of the Mobility Restrictions i.e.
independent from any S-NSSAI. CAG is not used as input to AMF selection nor
Network Slice selection. If NPN isolation is desired, operator can better
support NPN isolation by deploying network slicing for PNI-NPN, configuring
dedicated S-NSSAI(s) for the given NPN as specified in Annex D, clause D.2 and
restricting NPN\'s UE subscriptions to these dedicated S-NSSAI(s).
The UE and PNI-NPN may support remote provisioning of credentials for NSSAA or
credentials for secondary authentication/authorization to the UE, as specified
in clause 5.39.
NOTE 3: After successful provisioning of the credentials to the UE, specific
service subscription data (e.g. to enable the use of PNI-NPN) can be activated
in the UE Subscription data in the UDR/UDM. This can result in a change of the
UE Subscription Data to include new S-NSSAI, DNN or CAG information, which can
trigger update of the UE configurations, e.g. described in clause 5.15.5.2.2.
NOTE 4: The UE always has subscription to the HPLMN providing the PNI-NPN and
has a USIM that contains primary authentication credentials.
Support for Proximity based Services (ProSe) as defined in TS 23.304 [128] in
conjunction with CAG is not specified in this Release of the specification.
#### 5.30.3.2 Identifiers
The following is required for identification:
\- A CAG is identified by a CAG Identifier which is unique within the scope of
a PLMN ID;
\- A CAG cell broadcasts one or multiple CAG Identifiers per PLMN;
NOTE 1: It is assumed that a cell supports broadcasting a total of twelve CAG
Identifiers. Further details are defined in TS 38.331 [28].
\- A CAG cell may in addition broadcast a human-readable network name per CAG
Identifier:
NOTE 2: The human-readable network name per CAG Identifier is only used for
presentation to user when user requests a manual CAG selection.
#### 5.30.3.3 UE configuration, subscription aspects and storage
To use CAG, the UE, that supports CAG as indicated as part of the UE 5GMM Core
Network Capability, may be pre-configured or (re)configured with the following
CAG information, included in the subscription as part of the Mobility
Restrictions:
\- an Allowed CAG list i.e. a list of CAG Identifiers the UE is allowed to
access; and
\- optionally, a CAG-only indication whether the UE is only allowed to access
5GS via CAG cells (see TS 38.304 [50] for how the UE identifies whether a cell
is a CAG cell);
The HPLMN may configure or re-configure a UE with the above CAG information
using the UE Configuration Update procedure for access and mobility management
related parameters described in clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
The above CAG information is provided by the HPLMN on a per PLMN basis. In a
PLMN the UE shall only consider the CAG information provided for this PLMN.
When the subscribed CAG information changes, UDM sets a CAG information
Subscription Change Indication and sends it to the AMF. The AMF shall provide
the UE with the CAG information when the UDM indicates that the CAG
information within the Access and Mobility Subscription data has been changed.
When AMF receives the indication from the UDM that the CAG information within
the Access and Mobility Subscription has changed, the AMF uses the CAG
information received from the UDM to update the UE. Once the AMF updates the
UE and obtains an acknowledgment from the UE, the AMF informs the UDM that the
update was successful and the UDM clears the CAG information Subscription
Change Indication flag.
The AMF may update the UE using either the UE Configuration Update procedure
after registration procedure is completed, or by including the new CAG
information in the Registration Accept or in the Registration Reject or in the
Deregistration Request or in the Service Reject.
When the UE is roaming and the Serving PLMN provides CAG information, the UE
shall update only the CAG information provided for the Serving PLMN while the
stored CAG information for other PLMNs are not updated. When the UE is not
roaming and the HPLMN provides CAG information, the UE shall update the CAG
information stored in the UE with the received CAG information for all the
PLMNs.
The UE shall store the latest available CAG information for every PLMN for
which it is provided and keep it stored when the UE is de-registered or
switched off, as described in TS 24.501 [47].
The CAG information is only applicable with 5GS.
NOTE: CAG information has no implication on whether and how the UE accesses
5GS over non-3GPP access.
#### 5.30.3.4 Network and cell (re-)selection, and access control
The following is assumed for network and cell selection, and access control:
\- The CAG cell shall broadcast information such that only UEs supporting CAG
are accessing the cell (see TS 38.300 [27], TS 38.304 [50]);
NOTE 1: The above also implies that cells are either CAG cells or normal PLMN
cells. For network sharing scenario between SNPN, PNI-NPN and PLMNs, please
see clause 5.18.
\- In order to prevent access to NPNs for authorized UE(s) in the case of
network congestion/overload, existing mechanisms defined for Control Plane
load control, congestion and overload control in clause 5.19 can be used, as
well as the access control and barring functionality described in clause
5.2.5, or Unified Access Control using the access categories as defined in TS
24.501 [47] can be used.
\- For aspects of automatic and manual network selection in relation to CAG,
see TS 23.122 [17];
\- For aspects related to cell (re-)selection, see TS 38.304 [50];
\- The Mobility Restrictions shall be able to restrict the UE\'s mobility
according to the Allowed CAG list (if configured in the subscription) and
include an indication whether the UE is only allowed to access 5GS via CAG
cells (if configured in the subscription) as described in clause 5.30.3.3;
\- During transition from CM-IDLE to CM-CONNECTED and during Registration
after connected mode mobility from E-UTRAN to NG-RAN as described in clause
4.11.1.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3]:
\- The AMF shall verify whether UE access is allowed by Mobility Restrictions:
NOTE 2: It is assumed that the AMF is made aware of the supported CAG
Identifier(s) of the CAG cell by the NG-RAN.
\- If the UE is accessing the 5GS via a CAG cell and if at least one of the
CAG Identifier(s) received from the NG-RAN is part of the UE\'s Allowed CAG
list, then the AMF accepts the NAS request;
\- If the UE is accessing the 5GS via a CAG cell and if none of the CAG
Identifier(s) received from the NG-RAN are part of the UE\'s Allowed CAG list,
then the AMF rejects the NAS request and the AMF should include CAG
information in the NAS reject message. The AMF shall then release the NAS
signalling connection for the UE by triggering the AN release procedure; and
\- If the UE is accessing the 5GS via a non-CAG cell and the UE\'s
subscription contains an indication that the UE is only allowed to access CAG
cells, then the AMF rejects the NAS request and the AMF should include CAG
information in the NAS reject message. The AMF shall then release the NAS
signalling connection for the UE by triggering the AN release procedure.
\- During transition from RRC Inactive to RRC Connected state:
\- When the UE initiates the RRC Resume procedure for RRC Inactive to RRC
Connected state transition in a CAG cell, NG-RAN shall reject the RRC Resume
request from the UE if none of the CAG Identifiers supported by the CAG cell
are part of the UE\'s Allowed CAG list according to the Mobility Restrictions
received from the AMF or if no Allowed CAG list has been received from the
AMF.
\- When the UE initiates the RRC Resume procedure for RRC Inactive to RRC
Connected state transition in a non-CAG cell, NG-RAN shall reject the UE\'s
Resume request if the UE is only allowed to access CAG cells according to the
Mobility Restrictions received from the AMF.
\- During connected mode mobility procedures within NG-RAN, i.e., handover
procedures as described in clause 4.9.1 of TS 23.502 [3]:
\- Source NG-RAN shall not handover the UE to a target NG-RAN node if the
target is a CAG cell and none of the CAG Identifiers supported by the CAG cell
are part of the UE\'s Allowed CAG list in the Mobility Restriction List or if
no Allowed CAG list has been received from the AMF;
\- Source NG-RAN shall not handover the UE to a non-CAG cell if the UE is only
allowed to access CAG cells based on the Mobility Restriction List;
\- If the target cell is a CAG cell, target NG-RAN shall reject the N2 based
handover procedure if none of the CAG Identifiers supported by the CAG cell
are part of the UE\'s Allowed CAG list in the Mobility Restriction List or if
no Allowed CAG list has been received from the AMF;
\- If the target cell is a non-CAG cell, target NG-RAN shall reject the N2
based handover procedure if the UE is only allowed to access CAG cells based
on the Mobility Restriction List.
\- Update of Mobility Restrictions:
\- When the AMF receives the Nudm_SDM_Notification from the UDM and the AMF
determines that the Allowed CAG list or the indication whether the UE is only
allowed to access CAG cells have changed;
\- The AMF shall update the Mobility Restrictions in the UE and NG-RAN
accordingly under the conditions as described in clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502
[3].
NOTE 3: When the UE is accessing the network for emergency services the
conditions for AMF in clause 5.16.4.3 apply.
#### 5.30.3.5 Support of emergency services in CAG cells
Emergency Services are supported in CAG cells, for UEs supporting CAG, whether
normally registered or emergency registered as described in clause 5.16.4 and
in clause 4.13.4 of TS 23.502 [3].
A UE may camp on an acceptable CAG cell in limited service state as specified
in TS 23.122 [17] and TS 38.304 [50], based on operator policy defined in TS
38.300 [27].
NOTE: Support for Emergency services requires each cell with a Cell Identity
associated with PLMNs or PNI-NPNs to only be connected to AMFs that supports
emergency services.
The UE shall select a PLMN (of a CAG cell or non-CAG cell), as described in TS
23.122 [17] and TS 23.167 [18], when initiating emergency services from
limited service state.
During handover to a CAG cell, if the UE is not authorized to access the
target CAG cell as described in clause 5.30.3.4 and has emergency services,
the target NG-RAN node only accepts the emergency PDU Session and the target
AMF releases the non-emergency PDU Sessions that were not accepted by the NG-
RAN node. Upon completion of handover the UE behave as emergency registered.
## 5.31 Support for Cellular IoT
### 5.31.1 General
This clause provides an overview about 5GS optimisations and functionality for
support of Cellular Internet-of-Things (Cellular IoT, or CIoT) according to
service requirements described in TS 22.261 [2]. Cellular IoT is in earlier
3GPP releases also referred to as Machine Type Communication (MTC) (see clause
4.3.17 of TS 23.401 [26]). The specific functionality is described in the
affected procedures and features of this specification, in TS 23.502 [3], TS
23.503 [45] and other specifications.
In this Release Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisations (clause 5.31.4) and User
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisations (clause 5.31.18) are only supported over E-UTRA
and these CIoT 5GS optimisations are not supported over Non-3GPP RAT type
accesses.
CIoT functionality is provided by the visited and home networks when the
networks are configured to support CIoT. It applies to both the non-roaming
case and the roaming case and some functionality may be dependent upon the
existence of appropriate roaming agreements between the operators.
Some of the CIoT functions are controlled by subscriber data. Other CIoT
functions are based on indicators sent by the UE to the network. CIoT
functionality is performed by UEs that are configured to support different
options as described in clause 5.31.2
Though motivated by scenarios and use cases defined in TS 22.261 [2], the
functions added to support CIoT have general applicability and are in no way
constrained to any specific scenario, use case or UE types, except where
explicitly stated.
In the context of CIoT the term AF denotes an SCS/AS as defined TS 23.682
[36].
### 5.31.2 Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour
At registration, a UE includes its 5G Preferred Network Behaviour indicating
the network behaviour the UE can support and what it would prefer to use.
NOTE: If the UE supports S1-mode then the UE will indicate the supported EPS
Network Behaviour Information in the S1 UE network capability IE.
The 5G Preferred Network Behaviour signalled by the UE includes the following
information in the 5GMM Capability IE:
\- Whether Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is supported.
\- Whether User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is supported.
\- Whether N3 data transfer is supported.
\- Whether header compression for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is
supported.
And the following 5G Preferred Network Behaviour in other IEs:
\- Whether Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation or User Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation is preferred.
If N3 data transfer is supported is indicated by the UE, the UE supports data
transfer that is not subject to CIoT 5GS Optimisations. If the UE indicates
support of User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation then it shall also indicate
support of N3 data transfer.
The AMF indicates the network behaviour the network accepts in the 5G
Supported Network Behaviour information. This indication is per Registered
Area. The AMF may indicate one or more of the following:
\- Whether Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is supported.
\- Whether User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is supported.
\- Whether N3 data transfer is supported.
\- Whether header compression for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is
supported.
If the AMF indicates support of User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation then it shall
also indicate support of N3 data transfer. If the UE and AMF indicate support
for User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the AMF indicates support of User Plane
CIoT 5GS Optimisation support for the UE to NG-RAN.
For NB-IoT UEs that only support Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the AMF
shall include support for Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation in the
Registration Accept message.
A UE that supports the NB-IoT shall always indicate support for Control Plane
CIoT 5GS Optimisation.
A UE that supports WB-E-UTRA shall always indicate support for N3 data
transfer.
The 5G Preferred Network Behaviour indication from the UE may be used to
influence policy decisions that can cause rerouting of the Registration
Request from an AMF to another AMF.
### 5.31.3 Selection, steering and redirection between EPS and 5GS
The UE selects the core network type (EPC or 5GC) based on the broadcast
indications for both EPC and 5GC, and the UE\'s EPC and 5GC Preferred Network
Behaviour. Networks that support NB-IoT shall broadcast an indication whether
N3 data transfer is supported or not in system information.
When the UE performs the registration procedure it includes its Preferred
Network Behaviour (for 5G and EPC) in the Registration Request message and the
AMF replies with the 5G Supported Network Behaviour in the Registration Accept
message.
If the UE supports any of the CIoT 5GS Optimisations included in 5GC Preferred
Network Behaviour, then when the UE performs an Attach or TAU procedure and
the UE includes its EPC Preferred Network Behaviour then the UE shall also
include its 5GC Preferred Network Behaviour.
In networks that support CIoT features in both EPC and 5GC, the operator may
steer UEs from a specific CN type due to operator policy, e.g. due to roaming
agreements, Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour, load redistribution,
etc. Operator policies in EPC and 5GC are assumed to avoid steering UEs back
and forth between EPC and 5GC.
To redirect a UE from 5GC to EPC, when the UE sends a Registration Request or
Service Request, the AMF sends a Registration Reject or Service Reject with an
EMM cause value indicating that the UE should not use 5GC. The UE disables N1
mode and re-enables S1 mode, if it was disabled. The UE then performs either
an Attach or TAU in EPC as described in clause 5.17.2.
To redirect a UE from EPC to 5GC, when the UE requests an Attach or TAU
procedure or Service Reject, the MME sends a reject message with an EMM cause
indicating the UE should not use EPC. The UE disables S1 mode and re-enables
N1 mode, if it was disabled. The UE then registers with 5GC as described in
clause 5.17.2.
When determining whether to redirect the UE, the AMF/MME takes into account
the UE support of S1/N1 mode, respectively, and the UE\'s Preferred Network
Behaviour and the Supported Network Behaviour of the network the UE is being
redirected towards.
When determining to redirect the UE in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode to EPC, the AMF
shall initiate the UE Configuration Update procedure to indicate registration
requested and release of the N1 NAS signalling connection not requested, then
the AMF redirects the UE to EPC by rejecting the subsequent Registration
Request, see TS 24.501 [47].
If after redirection the UE cannot find a cell supporting connectivity, the UE
may re-enable the disabled N1/S1 mode and then perform Registration, Attach or
TAU.
### 5.31.4 Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation
#### 5.31.4.1 General
The Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is used to exchange user data between
the UE and the SMF as payload of a NAS message in both uplink and downlink
directions, avoiding the establishment of a user plane connection for the PDU
Session. The UE and the AMF perform integrity protection and ciphering for the
user data by using NAS PDU integrity protection and ciphering. For IP and
Ethernet data, the UE and the SMF may negotiate and perform header
compression.
NOTE: In the context of Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, established or
activated user plane resources/connection refers to radio user plane
resources/connection i.e Data Radio Bearer and N3 tunnel.
UE and AMF negotiate support and use of Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation as
defined in clause 5.31.2. When the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation feature
is used and the PDU Session Type is unstructured, the SMF selects either NEF
or UPF based on information in the UE\'s subscription.
If UE and network have negotiated support and use of Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation then the following paragraphs of this clause apply.
During the PDU Session Establishment procedure the AMF indicates to the SMF
that Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is available for data transmission.
During the PDU Session Establishment procedure the AMF also determines based
on Preferred and Supported Network Behaviour (see clause 5.31.2), subscription
data, other already established PDU Sessions and local policy whether a new
PDU Session shall only use the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation (i.e. that
a user-plane connection shall never be established for the new PDU Session).
If a PDU Session shall only use Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the AMF
provides a Control Plane Only Indicator to the SMF during the PDU Session
Establishment. The SMF provides the Control Plane Only Indicator in the
Session Management Request to the UE. A UE and SMF receiving the Control Plane
Only Indicator for a PDU Session shall always use the Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation for this PDU Session.
The following rules apply for the use of the Control Plane Only Indicator
during PDU Session Establishment:
\- If N3 data transfer was not successfully negotiated, all PDU Sessions shall
include Control Plane Only Indicator.
\- If N3 data transfer was successfully negotiated then:
\- For a new PDU Session for a DNN/S-NSSAI for which the subscription data for
SMF Selection includes an Invoke NEF indication (i.e. for a PDU Session which
will be anchored in NEF), the AMF shall always include the Control Plane Only
Indicator.
\- For a new PDU Session for a DNN/S-NSSAI for which the subscription data for
SMF Selection does not include an Invoke NEF indication (i.e. for a PDU
Session which will be anchored in UPF) and that supports interworking with EPS
based on the subscription data defined in TS 23.502 [3]:
\- for the first PDU Session the AMF determines based on local policy whether
to include the Control Plane Only Indicator or not;
\- if the AMF previously included a Control Plane Only Indicator for PDU
Sessions that support interworking with EPS based on the subscription data
defined in TS 23.502 [3] and that are anchored in UPF, the AMF shall include
it also for the new PDU Session;
\- if the AMF previously did not include a Control Plane Only Indicator for
any of the PDU Sessions that support interworking with EPS based on the
subscription data defined in TS 23.502 [3] and that are anchored in UPF, the
AMF shall not include it for the new PDU Session.
\- For a new PDU Session for a DNN/S-NSSAI for which the subscription data for
SMF Selection does not include an Invoke NEF indication (i.e. for a PDU
Session which will be anchored in UPF) and that does not support interworking
with EPS based on the subscription data defined in TS 23.502 [3], AMF
determines individually per PDU Session whether to include the Control Plane
Only Indicator or not.
As described in clause 5.31.4.2, if UE and AMF successfully negotiate N3 data
transfer in addition to Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the UE or SMF may
request to establish N3 data transfer for one or more PDU Sessions for which
Control Plane Only Indicator was not received. In CM-CONNECTED, the UE and the
network use N3 delivery for PDU Sessions for which user plane resources are
established, and uses NAS for data transmission for PDU Sessions for which
user plane resources are not established.
If the AMF determines that Control Plane Only indication associated with PDU
Session is not applicable any longer due to e.g. change of Preferred and
Supported Network Behaviour, subscription data, and local policy, the AMF
should request the SMF to release the PDU Session as specified in clause
4.3.4.2 or clause 4.3.4.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
Early Data Transmission may be initiated by the UE for mobile originated
Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation when the RAT Type is E-UTRA.
The QoS model as defined in clause 5.7 is not supported for PDU Sessions using
Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation as user plane resources are not
established for those PDU Sessions.
#### 5.31.4.2 Establishment of N3 data transfer during Data Transport in
Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation
If UE and AMF have successfully negotiated N3 data transfer in addition to
Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation based on the Preferred and Supported
Network Behaviour as defined in clause 5.31.2, then the SMF may decide to
establish N3 data transfer for any PDU session for which Control Plane Only
Indicator was not included based on local SMF decision e.g. based on the
amount of data transferred in UL or DL using Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation. In that case, the SMF initiates the SMF-triggered N3 data
transfer establishment procedure as described in clause 4.2.10.2 of TS 23.502
[3].
If UE and AMF successfully negotiate N3 data transfer in addition to Control
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation based on the Preferred and Supported Network
Behaviour as defined in clause 5.31.2, then the UE may decide to establish N3
data transfer for any PDU session for which Control Plane Only Indicator was
not included based on local decision, e.g. based on the amount of data to be
transferred. In that case, the UE performs the UE triggered N3 data transfer
establishment procedure as described in clause 4.2.10.1 of TS 23.502 [3].
#### 5.31.4.3 Control Plane Relocation Indication procedure
For intra-NB-IoT mobility when UE and AMF are using Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation, the CP Relocation Indication procedures may be used. The purpose
of the CP Relocation Indication procedure is to request the AMF to
authenticate the UE\'s re-establishment request (see TS 33.501 [29]), and
initiate the establishment of the UE\'s N2 connection after the UE has
initiated an RRC Re-Establishment procedure in a new NG-RAN node (see TS
38.300 [27]).
The RRC Re-Establishment procedure uses the Truncated 5G-S-TMSI as the UE
identifier. The NG-RAN is configured with the sizes of the components of the
Truncated 5G-S-TMSI and it is configured with how to recreate the AMF Set ID,
the AMF Pointer and 5G-TMSI from the equivalent truncated parameters (see TS
23.003 [19]).
The AMF configures the UE with the Truncated 5G-S-TMSI Configuration that
provides the sizes of the components of the Truncated 5G-S-TMSI as described
in TS 24.501 [47] during the Registration. The configuration of these
parameters are specific to each PLMN.
NOTE: Network sharing default configuration of the sizes of the truncated
components is described in TS 23.003 [19].
### 5.31.5 Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD)
Functions for NIDD may be used to handle Mobile Originated (MO) and Mobile
Terminated (MT) communication for unstructured data (also referred to as Non-
IP). Such delivery to the AF is accomplished by one of the following two
mechanisms:
\- Delivery using the NIDD API;
\- Delivery using UPF via a Point-to-Point (PtP) N6 tunnel.
NIDD is handled using an Unstructured PDU session to the NEF. The UE may
obtain an Unstructured PDU session to the NEF during the PDU Session
Establishment procedure. Whether or not the NIDD API shall be invoked for a
PDU session is determined by the presence of a \"NEF Identity for NIDD\" for
the DNN/S-NSSAI combination in the subscription. If the subscription includes
a \"NEF Identity for NIDD\" corresponding with the DNN and S-NSSAI
information, then the SMF selects that NEF and uses the NIDD API for that PDU
session.
The NEF exposes the NIDD APIs described in TS 23.502 [3] on the N33/Nnef
reference point.
The NEF uses the provisioned policies to map an AF Identifier and UE Identity
to a DNN/S-NSSAI combination if the Reliable Data Service (RDS) is not
enabled. If RDS is enabled, the NEF determines the association based on RDS
port numbers and the provisioned policies that may be used to map AF
Identifier and User identity to a DNN.
The NEF also supports distribution of Mobile Terminated messages to a group of
UEs based on the NIDD API. If an External Group Identifier is included in the
MT NIDD request, the NEF uses the UDM to resolve the External Group Identifier
to a list of SUPIs and sends the message to each UE in the group with an
established PDU Session.
The Protocol Configuration Options (PCO) may be used to transfer NIDD
parameters to and from the UE (e.g. maximum packet size). The PCO is sent in
the 5GSM signalling between UE and SMF. NIDD parameters are sent to and from
the NEF via the N29 interface.
### 5.31.6 Reliable Data Service
The Reliable Data Service (RDS) may be used between the UE and NEF or UPF when
using a PDU Session of PDU Type \'Unstructured\'. The service provides a
mechanism for the NEF or UPF to determine if the data was successfully
delivered to the UE and for the UE to determine if the data was successfully
delivered to the NEF or UPF. When a requested acknowledgement is not received,
the Reliable Data Service retransmits the packet. The service is enabled or
disabled based on DNN and NSSAI Configuration per SLA.
When the service is enabled, a protocol is used between the end-points of the
unstructured PDU Session. The protocol uses a packet header to identify if the
packet requires no acknowledgement, requires an acknowledgement, or is an
acknowledgment and to allow detection and elimination of duplicate PDUs at the
receiving endpoint. RDS supports both single and multiple applications within
the UE. Port Numbers in the header are used to identify the application on the
originator and to identify the application on the receiver. The UE, NEF and
the UPF may support reservation of the source and destination port numbers for
their use and subsequent release of the reserved port numbers. Reliable Data
Service protocol (as defined in TS 24.250 [80]) also enables applications to
query their peer entities to determine which port numbers are reserved and
which are available for use at any given time. The header is configured based
on Reliable Data Service Configuration information which is obtained in the
NIDD configuration, MT NIDD, and MO NIDD procedures with the AF as specified
in TS 23.502 [3].
During NIDD Configuration, the AF may indicate which serialization formats it
supports for mobile originated and mobile terminated traffic in the Reliable
Data Server Configuration. When port numbers are reserved by the UE, the
serialization format that will be used by the application may be indicated to
the NEF. When port numbers are reserved by the NEF, the serialization format
that will be used by the application may be indicated to the UE. If the
receiver does not support the indicated serialization format, it rejects the
port number reservation request and the sender may re-attempt to reserve the
port number with a different serialization format. If, during NIDD
Configuration, the AF indicated that it supports multiple serialization
formats, the NEF determines the serialization format that it will indicate to
the UE based on local policies and previous negotiations with the UE (e.g. the
NEF may indicate the same serialization format that was indicated by the UE or
avoid indicating a serialization format that was previously rejected by the
UE). When serialization formats are configured for reserved port numbers, the
NEF stores the serialization formats as part of the Reliable Data Service
Configuration and provides the updated Reliable Data Service Configuration to
the AF.
NOTE: Whether the UE Application or AF supports a given serialization format
is outside the scope of 3GPP specifications.
The UE indicates its capability of supporting RDS in the Protocol
Configuration Options (PCO) and the SMF negotiates RDS support with the NEF or
UPF. If the NEF or UPF supports and accepts RDS then the SMF indicates to the
UE, in the PCO, that the RDS shall be used if enabled in the DNN and NSSAI
configuration.
In order to prevent situations where an RDS instance needs to interface to
both the user and control plane, RDS may only be used with PDU Sessions for
which the \"Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation\" indication is set or with
PDU sessions using the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation when the AMF does
not move the PDU session to the user plane.
Reliable Data Service protocol is defined in TS 24.250 [80].
### 5.31.7 Power Saving Enhancements
#### 5.31.7.1 General
To enable UE power saving and to enhance MT reachability while using MICO
mode, e.g. for CIoT, the following features are specified in the following
clauses:
\- Extended Discontinuous Reception (DRX) for CM-IDLE and CM-CONNECTED with
RRC-INACTIVE;
\- MICO mode with Extended Connected Time;
\- MICO mode with Active Time;
\- MICO mode and Periodic Registration Timer Control.
If a UE requests via NAS to enable both MICO mode with Active Time and
extended idle mode DRX, e.g. based on local configuration, Expected UE
Behaviour, if available, UE requested Active Time value, UE subscription
information and network policies etc, the AMF may decide to enable MICO mode
with or without Active Time, extended idle mode DRX or both.
#### 5.31.7.2 Extended Discontinuous Reception (DRX) for CM-IDLE and CM-
CONNECTED with RRC-INACTIVE
##### 5.31.7.2.1 Overview
The UE and the network may negotiate over non-access stratum signalling the
use of extended idle mode DRX for reducing its power consumption, while being
available for mobile terminating data and/or network originated procedures
within a certain delay dependent on the DRX cycle value. Extended DRX in CM-
IDLE is supported for E-UTRA and NR connected to 5GC. Extended DRX in CM-
CONNECTED with RRC-Inactive mode is supported for WB-E-UTRA, LTE-M and NR
connected to 5GC. RRC-Inactive is not supported by NB-IoT connected to 5GC.
The negotiation of the eDRX parameters for NR, WB-E-UTRA and LTE-M is
supported over any RAT.
Applications that want to use extended idle mode DRX need to consider specific
handling of mobile terminating services or data transfers, and in particular
they need to consider the delay tolerance of mobile terminated data. A network
side application may send mobile terminated data, an SMS, or a device trigger,
and needs to be aware that extended idle mode DRX may be in place. A UE should
request for extended idle mode DRX only when all expected mobile terminating
communication is tolerant to delay.
NOTE 1: The extended idle mode DRX cycle length requested by UE takes into
account requirements of applications running on the UE. Subscription based
determination of eDRX cycle length can be used in those rare scenarios when
applications on UE cannot be modified to request appropriate extended idle
mode DRX cycle length. The network accepting extended DRX while providing an
extended idle mode DRX cycle length value longer than the one requested by the
UE, can adversely impact reachability requirements of applications running on
the UE.
UE and NW negotiate the use of extended idle mode DRX as follows:
If the UE decides to request for extended idle mode DRX, the UE includes an
extended idle mode DRX parameters information element in the Registration
Request message. The UE may also include the UE specific DRX parameters
information element for regular idle mode DRX according to clause 5.4.5. The
extended DRX parameters information element includes the extended idle mode
DRX cycle length.
The AMF decides whether to accept or reject the UE request for enabling
extended idle mode DRX. If the AMF accepts the extended idle mode DRX, the AMF
based on operator policies and, if available, the extended idle mode DRX cycle
length value in the subscription data from the UDM, may also provide different
values of the extended idle mode DRX parameters than what was requested by the
UE. The AMF taking into account the RAT specific Subscribed Paging Time
Window, the UE\'s current RAT and local policy also assigns a Paging Time
Window length to be used, and provides this value to the UE during
Registration Update procedures together with the extended idle mode DRX cycle
length in the extended DRX parameter information element. If the AMF accepts
the use of extended idle mode DRX, the UE shall apply extended idle mode DRX
based on the received extended idle mode DRX length, the UE\'s current RAT
(NR, NB-IoT, WB-E-UTRA or LTE-M) and RAT specific Paging Time Window length.
If the UE does not receive the extended DRX parameters information element in
the relevant accept message because the AMF rejected its request or because
the request was received by AMF not supporting extended idle mode DRX, the UE
shall apply its regular discontinuous reception as defined in clause 5.4.5.
For NR, Paging Time Window applies for extended DRX lengths greater than
10.24s as defined in TS 38.304 [50]. For WB-E-UTRA, Paging Time Window applies
for extended DRX lengths of 10.24s and greater as defined in TS 36.304 [52].
When the UE is accessing NR, if the AMF provides an extended idle mode DRX
cycle length value of 10.24s, and the registration area of the UE contains
only NR cells, the AMF does not include a Paging Time Window. If the AMF
provides an extended idle mode DRX cycle length value of 10.24s, and the
registration area of the UE contains E-UTRA cells and NR cells if the UE
supports both E-UTRA and NR, the AMF includes a Paging Time Window.
For WB-E-UTRA and LTE-M the eNB broadcasts an indicator for support of
extended idle mode DRX in 5GC in addition to the existing indicator for
support of extended idle mode DRX in EPC as defined in TS 36.331 [51]. For NR
the gNB broadcasts an indicator for support of extended idle mode DRX as
defined in TS 38.331 [28]. This indicator is used by the UE in CM-IDLE state.
NOTE 2: A broadcast indicator for support of extended idle mode DRX is not
needed for NB-IoT as it is always supported in NB-IoT.
The specific negotiation procedure handling is described in TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 3: If the Periodic Registration Update timer assigned to the UE is not
longer than the extended idle mode DRX cycle the power savings are not
maximised.
For RAT types that support extended DRX for CM-CONNECTED with RRC Inactive
state, the AMF passes the UE\'s accepted idle mode eDRX cycle length value to
NG-RAN. If the UE supports eDRX in RRC inactive, based on its UE radio
capabilities, NG-RAN configures the UE with an eDRX cycle in RRC-INACTIVE up
to the value for the UE\'s idle mode eDRX cycle as provided by the AMF in
\"RRC Inactive Assistance Information\" as defined in clause 5.3.3.2.5 or up
to 10.24 seconds (whichever is lower).
If eDRX cycle is applied in RRC-INACTIVE, the RAN buffers DL packets up to the
duration of the eDRX cycle chosen by NG-RAN.
When the UE has PDU Session associated with emergency services, the UE and AMF
follow regular discontinuous reception as defined in clause 5.4.5 and shall
not use the extended idle mode DRX. Extended idle mode DRX parameters may be
negotiated while the UE has PDU Session associated with emergency services.
When the PDU Session associated with emergency services is released, the UE
and AMF shall reuse the negotiated extended idle mode DRX parameters in the
last Registration Update procedure.
The UE shall include the extended DRX parameters information element in each
Registration Request message if it still wants to use extended idle mode DRX.
At AMF to AMF, AMF to MME and MME to AMF mobility, the extended idle mode DRX
parameters are not sent from the old CN node to the new CN node as part of the
MM context information.
##### 5.31.7.2.2 Paging for extended idle mode DRX in E-UTRA and NR connected
to 5GC
##### 5.31.7.2.2.0 General {#general-80 .H6}
For WB-E-UTRA and LTE-M connected to 5GC, the extended idle mode DRX value
range will consist of values starting from 5.12s (i.e. 5.12s, 10.24s, 20.48s,
etc.) up to a maximum of 2621.44s (almost 44 min). For NB-IoT, the extended
idle mode DRX value range will start from 20.48s (i.e. 20.48s, 40.96s, 81.92,
etc.) up to a maximum of 10485.76s (almost 3 hours) (see TS 36.304 [52]). For
NR, the extended idle mode DRX value range will consist of values starting
from 2.56s (i.e. 2.56s, 5.12s, 10.24s, 20.48s, etc.) up to a maximum of
10485.76s (almost 3 hours) (see TS 38.304 [50]). The extended idle mode DRX
cycle length is negotiated via NAS signalling. The AMF includes the extended
idle mode DRX cycle length for NR, WB-E-UTRA, LTE-M or NB-IoT in paging
message to assist the NG-RAN node in paging the UE. For NR, Paging Time Window
applies for extended DRX lengths longer than 10.24s as defined in TS 38.304
[50]. For WB-E-UTRA, LTE-M and NB-IoT, Paging Time Window applies for extended
DRX lengths of 10.24s and longer as defined in TS 36.304 [52].
The network follows the regular paging strategy as defined in clause 5.4.5
when the extended idle mode DRX cycle length is 5.12s or less for WB-E-UTRA,
LTE-M and NB-IoT, or 10.24s or less for NR.
Clauses 5.31.7.2.2.1, 5.31.7.2.2.2 and 5.31.7.2.2.3 apply when the extended
idle mode DRX cycle length is 10.24s or longer for WB-E-UTRA, LTE-M and NB-
IoT, or longer than 10.24s for NR.
##### 5.31.7.2.2.1 Hyper SFN, Paging Hyperframe and Paging Time Window length
{#hyper-sfn-paging-hyperframe-and-paging-time-window-length .H6}
A Hyper-SFN (H-SFN) frame structure is defined on top of the SFN used for
regular idle mode DRX. Each H-SFN value corresponds to a cycle of the legacy
SFN of 1024 radio frames, i.e. 10.24s. When extended idle mode DRX is enabled
for a UE, the UE is reachable for paging in specific Paging Hyperframes (PH),
which is a specific set of H-SFN values. The PH computation is a formula that
is function of the extended idle mode DRX cycle, and a UE specific identifier,
as described in TS 36.304 [52] and TS 38.304 [50]. This value can be computed
at all UEs and AMFs without need for signalling. The AMF includes the extended
idle mode DRX cycle length and the PTW length in paging message to assist the
NG-RAN nodes in paging the UE.
The AMF also assigns a Paging Time Window length, and provides this value to
the UE during Registration Update procedures together with the extended idle
mode DRX cycle length. The UE first paging occasion is within the Paging
Hyperframe as described in TS 36.304 [52] and TS 38.304 [50]. The UE is
assumed reachable for paging within the Paging Time Window. The start and end
of the Paging Time Window is described in TS 36.304 [52] and TS 38.304 [50].
After the Paging Time Window length, the AMF considers the UE unreachable for
paging until the next Paging Hyperfame.
##### 5.31.7.2.2.2 Loose Hyper SFN synchronization {#loose-hyper-sfn-
synchronization .H6}
NOTE: This clause applies when the extended DRX cycle length is 10.24s or
longer for WB-E-UTRA, LTE-M and NB-IoT, and longer than 10.24s for NR.
In order for the UE to be paged at roughly similar time, the H-SFN of all NG-
RAN nodes and AMFs should be loosely synchronized.
Each NG-RAN node and AMF synchronizes internally the H-SFN counter so that the
start of H-SFN=0 coincides with the same a preconfigured time epoch. If NG-RAN
nodes and AMFs use different epochs, e.g. due to the use of different time
references, the GPS time should be set as the baseline, and the NG-RAN nodes
and AMFs synchronize the H-SFN counter based on the GPS epoch considering the
time offset between GPS epoch and other time-reference epoch a preconfigured
time. It is assumed that NG-RAN nodes and AMFs are able to use the same H-SFN
value with accuracy in the order of legacy DRX cycle lengths, e.g. 1 to 2
seconds. There is no need for synchronization at SFN level.
There is no signalling between network nodes required to achieve this level of
loose H-SFN synchronization.
##### 5.31.7.2.2.3 AMF paging and paging retransmission strategy {#amf-paging-
and-paging-retransmission-strategy .H6}
NOTE: This clause applies when the extended DRX cycle length is 10.24s or
longer for WB-E-UTRA, LTE-M and NB-IoT, and longer than 10.24s for NR.
When the AMF receives trigger for paging and the UE is reachable for paging,
the AMF sends the paging request. If the UE is not reachable for paging, then
the AMF pages the UE just before the next paging occasion.
The AMF determines the Paging Time Window length and a paging retransmission
strategy, and executes the retransmission scheme.
For extended DRX length of 10.24s, in the paging request message the AMF sends
the Paging Time Window to the ng-eNB but does not send the Paging Time Window
to the gNB.
##### 5.31.7.2.3 Paging for a UE registered in a tracking area with
heterogeneous support of extended idle mode DRX
When the UE is registered in a registration area with heterogeneous support of
extended idle mode DRX (e.g. comprising WB-E-UTRA and NR cells) and has
negotiated eDRX, the AMF shall, for any paging procedure, perform at least one
paging attempt during a PTW.
NOTE: Heterogeneous support of extended idle mode DRX in tracking areas
assigned by AMF in a TAI list can result in significant battery life reduction
in the UE as compared to homogeneous support by NG-RAN nodes of extended idle
mode DRX.
#### 5.31.7.3 MICO mode with Extended Connected Time
When a UE, using MICO mode, initiates MO signalling or MO data and the AMF is
aware of pending or expected MT traffic, the AMF may keep the UE in CM-
CONNECTED state and the RAN may keep the UE in RRC-CONNECTED state for an
Extended Connected Time period in order to ensure the downlink data and/or
signalling is delivered to the UE. The Extended Connected Time is determined
by the AMF and is based on local configuration and/or the Maximum Response
Time, if provided by the UDM.
The AMF maintains the N2 connection for at least the Extended Connected Time
and provides the Extended Connected Time value to the RAN. The Extended
Connected Time value indicates the minimum time the RAN should keep the UE in
RRC-CONNECTED state regardless of inactivity. The Extended Connected Time
value is provided to the RAN together with the
\- NAS Registration Accept message; or
\- NAS Service Accept message.
At inter-RAN node handovers, if some signalling or data are still pending, the
target AMF may send the Extended Connected Time value to the target RAN node.
#### 5.31.7.4 MICO mode with Active Time
During a Registration procedure the UE may optionally request an Active Time
value from the AMF as part of MICO Mode negotiation. In response, if the AMF
receives an Active Time value from the UE and determines that the MICO mode is
allowed for the UE, the AMF may assign an Active Time value for the UE, e.g.
based on local configuration, Expected UE Behaviour if available, UE requested
Active Time value, UE subscription information and network policies, and
indicates it to the UE during Registration procedure. When an Active Time
value is assigned to the UE the AMF shall consider the UE reachable for paging
after the transition from CM-CONNECTED to CM-IDLE for the duration of the
Active Time. Together with the Active Time value, the UE may request a
periodic registration time value as specified in clause 5.31.7.45.
When the AMF indicates MICO mode with an Active Time to a UE, the registration
area may be constrained by paging area size. To avoid paging in the entire
PLMN, when the AMF allocates the Active Time the AMF should not allocate \"all
PLMN\" registration area to the UE.
The UE and AMF shall set a timer corresponding to the Active Time value
negotiated during the most recent Registration procedure. The UE and AMF shall
start the timer upon entering CM-IDLE state from CM-CONNECTED. When the timer
expires (i.e. reaches the Active Time) the UE enters MICO mode and the AMF can
deduce that the UE has entered MICO mode and is not available for paging. If
the UE enters CM-CONNECTED state before the timer expires, the UE and AMF
shall stop and reset the timer.
If no Active Time value was negotiated during the most recent Registration
procedure the UE shall not start the timer and it shall instead enter MICO
mode directly upon entering CM-IDLE state.
Active Time is not transferred between AMF and MME.
#### 5.31.7.5 MICO mode and Periodic Registration Timer Control
If the Expected UE Behaviour indicates the absence of DL communication, the
AMF may allow MICO mode for the UE and allocate a large periodic registration
timer value based on e.g. Network Configuration parameters to the UE so that
the UE can maximise power saving between Periodic Registration Updates.
If the Expected UE Behaviour indicates scheduled DL communication the AMF
should allow MICO mode for the UE and allocate a periodic registration timer
value such that the UE performs Periodic Registration Update to renegotiate
MICO mode before or at the scheduled DL communication time, if the AMF decides
to allow MICO mode for the UE. When UE requests the MICO mode with active
time, the UE may also request a periodic registration timer value suitable for
the latency/responsiveness of the DL communication service known to UE. If the
UE wants to change the periodic registration timer value, e.g. when the
conditions are changed in the UE, the UE consequently requests the value it
wants in the registration procedure. The AMF takes the UE requested periodic
registration time value into consideration when providing the periodic
registration timer to UE during Registration procedure as specified in clause
4.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
If the UE supports \'Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication\', the UE
indicates its capability of supporting \'Strictly Periodic Registration Timer
Indication\' in the Registration Request message. If the UE indicates its
support of \'Strictly Periodic Registration Timer Indication\' in the
Registration Request message, the AMF may provide a Strictly Periodic
Registration Timer Indication to the UE together with the periodic
registration timer value, e.g. based on Expected UE Behaviour. If the
indication is provided by the AMF, the UE and the AMF shall start the periodic
registration timer after completion of the Registration procedure. The UE and
the AMF shall neither stop nor restart the periodic registration timer when
the UE enters CM-CONNECTED, and shall keep it running while in CM-CONNECTED
state and after returning to CM-IDLE state. If and only when the timer expires
and the UE is in CM-IDLE, the UE shall perform a Periodic Registration Update.
If the timer expires and the UE is in CM-CONNECTED state, the AMF and the UE
restart the periodic registration timer while still applying \'Strictly
Periodic Registration Timer Indication\'. The AMF may use the UE Configuration
Update procedure to trigger the UE to perform Registration procedure, in which
the periodic registration timer value and \'Strictly Periodic Registration
Timer Indication\' can be renegotiated.
When the UE and the AMF locally disable MICO mode (e.g. when an emergency
service is initiated), the UE and the AMF shall not apply \'Strictly Periodic
Registration Timer Indication\'.
If the periodic registration timer is renegotiated during a Registration
procedure, e.g. triggered by UE Configuration Update, and if the periodic
registration timer is running, then the periodic registration timer is stopped
and restarted using the renegotiated value even when the Strictly Periodic
Registration Timer Indication was provided to the UE.
### 5.31.8 High latency communication
Functions for High latency communication may be used to handle mobile
terminated (MT) communication with UEs being unreachable while using power
saving functions as specified in clause 5.31.7. \"High latency\" refers to the
initial response time before normal exchange of packets is established. That
is, the time it takes before a UE has woken up from its power saving state and
responded to an initial downlink packet or signal.
When a NR RedCap UE requests to use the power saving functions as specified in
clause 5.31.7, then the AMF may, based on local policy, reroute the
Registration Request to another AMF that supports High latency communication
as specified in clause 6.3.5.
High latency communication is supported by extended buffering of downlink data
in the UPF, SMF or NEF when a UE is using power saving functions in CM-IDLE
state and the UE is not reachable. For UPF anchored PDU sessions the SMF
configures during AN release the UPF with user data Forwarding Action Rule and
user data Buffering Action Rule according to TS 29.244 [65]. The rules include
instructions whether UPF buffering applies or the user data shall be forwarded
to the SMF for buffering in the SMF. For NEF anchored PDU sessions only
extended buffering in the NEF is supported in this release of the
specification. During the Network Triggered Service Request procedure or
Mobile Terminated Data Transport procedures when using Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation, the AMF provides an Estimated Maximum Wait Time to the SMF if
the SMF indicates the support of extended buffering. The SMF determines the
Extended Buffering Time based on the received Estimated Maximum Wait Time or
local configuration. The handling is e.g. specified in the Network Triggered
Service Request procedure, clauses 4.2.3.3, 4.2.6, 4.24.2 and 4.25.5 of TS
23.502 [3].
High latency communication is also supported through notification procedures.
The following procedures are available based on different monitoring events:
\- UE Reachability;
\- Availability after DDN failure;
\- Downlink Data Delivery Status.
An AF may request a one-time \"UE Reachability\" notification when it wants to
send data to a UE which is using a power saving function (see event
subscription procedure in clause 4.15.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3]). The SCS/AS/AF
then waits with sending the data until it gets a notification that the UE is
reachable (see notification procedures in TS 23.502 [3]).
An AF may request repeated \"Availability after DDN failure\" notifications
where each UE reachability notification is triggered by a preceding DDN
failure, i.e. the AF sends a downlink packet to request a UE reachability
notification when the UE becomes reachable. That downlink packet is discarded
by the UPF or SMF or NEF (see notification procedures in TS 23.502 [3]).
An AF may request repeated \"Downlink Data Delivery Status\" notifications
when it wants indications that DL data has been buffered or when buffered DL
data has been delivered to the UE.
If MICO mode or extended idle mode DRX is enabled, Idle Status Indication
allows the AF to determine when the UE transitions into idle mode. When
requesting to be informed of either \"UE Reachability\" or \"Availability
after DDN failure\" notification, the AF may also request Idle Status
Indication. If the UDM and the AMF support Idle Status Indication, then when
the UE for which MICO mode or extended idle mode DRX is enabled transitions
into idle mode, the AMF includes in the notification towards the NEF the time
at which the UE transitioned into idle mode, the active time and the periodic
registration update timer granted to the UE by the AMF, the eDRX cycle length
and the Suggested number of downlink packets if a value was provided to the
SMF.
An AF may provide parameters related to High latency communication for
different methods to UDM, via NEF, as part of provisioning capability as
specified in clause 5.20. The UDM can further deliver the parameters to other
NFs (e.g. AMF or SMF) as specified in clause 4.15.6 of TS 23.502 [3].
If the AMF is aware that some signalling or data is pending in the network for
an UE that is known as being unreachable for a long duration, e.g. for UE\'s
having extended idle mode DRX or MICO enabled, the AMF maintains the N2
connection for at least the Extended Connected Time and provides the Extended
Connected Time value in a NG-AP message to the RAN. The Extended Connected
Time value indicates the minimum time the RAN should keep the UE in RRC-
CONNECTED state regardless of inactivity. At inter-RAN node handovers, if some
signalling or data are still pending, the target AMF may send the Extended
Connected Time value to the target RAN node.
### 5.31.9 Support for Monitoring Events
The Monitoring Events feature is intended for monitoring of specific events in
the 3GPP system and reporting such Monitoring Events via the NEF. The feature
allows NFs in 5GS to be configured to detect specific events and report the
events to the requested party. Clause 5.20 further discusses the Monitoring
capabilities of the NEF.
For CIoT, the list of supported monitoring events is specified in Table
4.15.3.1-1 of TS 23.502 [3].
Support for Monitoring Events can be offered via AMF, UDM, NSACF and SMF, and
can be reported via the NEF, as specified in clause 4.15.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
### 5.31.10 NB-IoT UE Radio Capability Handling
NB-IoT Radio Capabilities are handled in the network independently from other
RATs\' Radio Capabilities, see clause 5.4.4.1.
### 5.31.11 Inter-RAT idle mode mobility to and from NB-IoT
Tracking Areas are configured so that they do not contain both NB-IoT and
other RATs\' cells, so when the UE is changing RAT type to or from NB-IoT
while remaining registered with 5GC, the UE will perform the Mobility
Registration Update procedure, see clause 5.3.2.3. When the UE is changing RAT
type to or from NB-IoT and moving between 5GC and EPC, during the
Registration, Attach or TAU procedure the RAT type change is determined.
The specification in this clause does not apply to RAT type corresponding to
Non-3GPP Access type.
PDU session handling is controlled by \"PDU Session continuity at inter RAT
mobility\" in the UE\'s subscription data, which indicates per DNN/S-NSSAI
whether to;
\- maintain the PDU session,
\- disconnect the PDU session with a reactivation request,
\- disconnect the PDU session without reactivation request, or
\- leave it up to local VPLMN policy
when the UE moves between a \"broadband\" RAT (e.g. NR or WB-E-UTRA) and a
\"narrowband\" RAT (NB-IoT).
During PDU session establishment the SMF retrieves the \"PDU Session
continuity at inter RAT mobility\" subscription information (if available)
from the UDM. Local SMF configuration is used if \"PDU Session continuity at
inter RAT mobility\" is not available for a PDU Session.
The AMF informs the SMF at an inter-RAT idle mobility event, e.g. to or from
NB-IoT connected to 5GC about the RAT type change in the
Nsmf_PDUSession_UpdateSMContext message during the Registration procedure.
Based on this (H-)SMF handles the PDU session according to \"PDU session
continuity at inter RAT mobility information\" subscription data or based on
local policy.
NOTE: The \"PDU Session continuity at inter RAT mobility\" and \"PDN
continuity at inter-RAT mobility\" subscription should be the same so that the
PDU sessions/PDN connections are handled the same by both CN types.
During inter-RAT idle mode mobility to NB-IoT, if a PDU session has more than
one QoS rule, the SMF shall initiate a PDU session modification procedure as
described in TS 23.502 [3] to remove any non-default QoS rule, and maintain
only the default QoS rule.
### 5.31.12 Restriction of use of Enhanced Coverage
Support of UEs in Enhanced Coverage is specified in TS 36.300 [30].
The usage of Enhanced Coverage requires use of extensive resources (e.g. radio
and signalling resources). Specific subscribers can be restricted to use the
Enhanced Coverage feature through Enhanced Coverage Restricted information
that is stored in the UDM as part of subscription data and specifies per PLMN
whether the Enhanced Coverage functionality is restricted or not for the UE.
For eMTC, the Enhanced Coverage Restricted information indicates whether CE
mode B is restricted for the UE, or both CE mode A and CE mode B are
restricted for the UE, or both CE mode A and CE mode B are not restricted for
the UE. For NB-IoT, the NB-IoT Enhanced Coverage Restricted information
indicates whether the Enhanced Coverage is restricted or not for the UE.
The AMF receives Enhanced Coverage Restricted information from the UDM during
the Registration procedure. If the UE includes the support for restriction of
use of Enhanced Coverage in the Registration Request message, the AMF based on
local configuration, UE Usage setting, UE subscription information and network
policies, or any combination of them, determines whether Enhanced Coverage is
restricted for the UE and stores updated Enhanced Coverage Restriction
information in the UE context in the AMF. If the UE usage setting indicated
that UE is \"voice centric\", then the AMF shall set CE mode B restricted for
the UE in Enhanced Coverage Restriction information.
The AMF sends Enhanced Coverage Restricted information to the UE in the
Registration Accept message. The UE shall use the value of Enhanced Coverage
Restricted information to determine if enhanced coverage feature is restricted
or not. The AMF provides an Enhanced Coverage Restricted information to the
RAN via N2 signalling whenever the UE context is established in the RAN, e.g.
during N2 Paging procedure, Service Request procedure, Initial Registration
and Periodic Registration procedure.
For roaming UEs, if the UDM doesn\'t provide any Enhanced Coverage Restricted
information or the provided Enhanced Coverage Restricted information is in
conflict with the roaming agreement, the AMF uses default Enhanced Coverage
Restricted information locally configured in the VPLMN based on the roaming
agreement with the subscriber\'s HPLMN.
The UE indicates its capability of support for restriction of use of Enhanced
Coverage to the AMF in the Registration procedure for the RAT it is camping
on. A UE that supports Enhanced Coverage shall also support restriction of the
Enhanced Coverage.
The UE shall assume that restriction for use of Enhanced Coverage indicated by
Enhanced Coverage Restricted information is the same in the equivalent PLMNs.
NB-IoT cells also broadcast the support of restriction of use of Enhanced
Coverage as defined in TS 36.331 [51].
If the UE supports CE mode B and use of CE mode B is not restricted according
to the Enhanced Coverage Restriction information in the UE context in the AMF,
then the AMF shall use the extended NAS-MM timer setting for the UE as
specified in TS 24.501 [47] and shall send the extended NAS-SM timer
indication during PDU session establishment to the SMF.
If the UE supports CE mode B and use of CE mode B changes from restricted to
unrestricted or vice versa in the Enhanced Coverage Restriction information in
the UE context in the AMF (e.g. due to a subscription change) then:
\- The AMF determines when to enforce the change of restriction of use of
Enhanced Coverage.
\- When the UE is in CM-CONNECTED mode, the AMF can use the UE Configuration
Update procedure, as specified in step 3a of clause 4.2.4.2 of TS 23.502 [3],
to trigger a mobility registration update procedure in CM-CONNECTED mode for
the AMF to inform the change of restriction of Enhanced Coverage towards the
UE.
\- If the UE has already established PDU sessions, then the AMF shall trigger
a PDU session modification to the SMFs serving the UE\'s PDU sessions to
update the use of the extended NAS-SM timer setting as described in step 1f of
clause 4.3.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3] when the AMF determines that NAS-SM timer
shall be updated due to the change of Enhanced Coverage Restriction.
\- The UE and network applies the new Enhanced Coverage Restriction
information after mobility registration procedure is completed.
Based on the extended NAS-SM timer indication, the SMF shall use the extended
NAS-SM timer setting for the UE as specified in TS 24.501 [47].
The support for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control via NEF enables AF to
query status of Enhanced Coverage Restriction or enable/disable Enhanced
Coverage Restriction per individual UEs. The procedure for Enhanced Coverage
Restriction Control via NEF is described in clause 4.27 of TS 23.502 [3].
### 5.31.13 Paging for Enhanced Coverage
Support of UEs in Enhanced Coverage is specified in TS 36.300 [30].
Whenever N2 is released and Paging Assistance Data for CE capable UE is
available for the UE, the NG-RAN sends it to the AMF as described in clause
4.2.6 of TS 23.502 [3].
The AMF stores the received Paging Assistance Data for CE capable UE and then
the AMF includes it in every subsequent Paging message for all NG-RAN nodes
selected by the AMF for paging.
If Enhanced Coverage is restricted for the UE as described in clause 5.31.12,
the AMF sends the Enhanced Coverage Restriction parameter as defined in TS
38.413 [34].
NOTE: Only the NG-RAN node which cell ID is included in the Paging Assistance
Data considers the assistance data.
### 5.31.14 Support of rate control of user data
#### 5.31.14.1 General
The rate of user data sent to and from a UE (e.g. a UE using CIoT 5GS
Optimisations) can be controlled in two different ways:
\- Serving PLMN Rate Control;
\- Small Data Rate Control.
Serving PLMN Rate Control is intended to allow the Serving PLMN to protect its
AMF and the Signalling Radio Bearers in the NG-RAN from the load generated by
NAS Data PDUs.
Small Data Rate Control is intended to allow HPLMN operators to offer customer
services such as \"maximum of Y messages per day\".
NOTE: Existing Session-AMBR mechanisms are not suitable for such a service
since, for radio efficiency and UE battery life reasons, an AMBR of e.g. >
100kbit/s is desirable and such an AMBR translates to a potentially large
daily data volume.
The SMF in the Serving PLMN may send the Small Data rate control parameter for
an emergency PDU session.
#### 5.31.14.2 Serving PLMN Rate Control
The Serving PLMN Rate Control value is configured in the (V-)SMF.
NOTE 1: Homogeneous support of Serving PLMN Rate Control in a network is
assumed.
At PDU Session establishment and PDU Session modification, the (V-)SMF may
inform the UE and UPF/NEF of any per PDU Session local Serving PLMN Rate
Control that the Serving PLMN intends to enforce for NAS Data PDUs. The
(V-)SMF shall only indicate a Serving PLMN Rate Control command to the UPF if
the PDU Session is using N4 and is set to Control Plane only. The (V-)SMF
shall only indicate a Serving PLMN Rate Control command to the NEF if that PDN
connection is using NEF.
Serving PLMN rate control is operator configurable and expressed as \"X NAS
Data PDUs per deci hour\" where X is an integer that shall not be less than
10. There are separate limits for uplink and downlink NAS Data PDUs:
\- The UE shall limit the rate at which it generates uplink NAS Data PDUs to
comply with the Serving PLMN policy. In the UE the indicated rate control
applies only on the PDU Session where it was received, and therefore the UE
shall limit the rate of its uplink NAS Data PDUs to comply with the rate that
is indicated for the PDU Session. The indicated rate is valid until the PDU
Session is released.
\- The UPF/NEF shall limit the rate at which it generates downlink Data PDUs.
In the UPF/NEF the indicated rate control applies only on the PDU Session
where it was received, and therefore the UPF/NEF shall limit the rate of its
downlink Data PDUs to comply with the rate that is indicated for the PDU
Session.
\- The (V-)SMF may enforce these limits per PDU Session by discarding or
delaying packets that exceed these limits. The Serving PLMN Rate does not
include SMS using NAS Transport PDUs. The (V-)SMF starts the Serving PLMN Rate
Control when the first NAS Data PDU is received.
NOTE 2: If the UE/UPF/NEF start the Serving PLMN rate control at a different
time than the (V-)SMF, PDUs sent within the limit enforced at the UE/UPF/NEF
can still exceed the limit enforced by the (V-)SMF.
NOTE 3 It is assumed that the Serving PLMN Rate is sufficiently high to not
interfere with the Small Data Rate Control as the Small Data Rate Control, if
used, is assumed to allow fewer messages. NAS PDUs related to exception
reports are not subject to the Serving PLMN Rate Control.
#### 5.31.14.3 Small Data Rate Control
The (H-)SMF may consider, e.g. based on operator policy, subscription, DNN,
S-NSSAI, RAT type etc. to determine whether to apply Small Data Rate Control
or not. The (H-)SMF can send a Small Data Uplink Rate Control command to the
UE using the PCO information element. The (H-)SMF informs the UPF or NEF of
any Small Data Rate Control that shall be enforced.
The Small Data Rate Control applies to data PDUs sent on that PDU Session by
either Data Radio Bearers or Signalling Radio Bearers (NAS Data PDUs).
The rate control information is separate for uplink and downlink and in the
form of:
\- an integer \'number of packets per time unit\', and
\- an integer \'number of additional allowed exception report packets per time
unit\' once the rate control limit has been reached.
The UE shall comply with this uplink rate control instruction. If the UE
exceeds the uplink \'number of packets per time unit\', the UE may still send
uplink exception reports if allowed and the \'number of additional allowed
exception reports per time unit\' has not been exceeded. The UE shall consider
this rate control instruction as valid until it receives a new one from
(H-)SMF.
When a PDU Session is first established, the (H-)SMF may provide the
configured Small Data Rate Control parameters to the UE and UPF or NEF.
When the PDU Session is released, the Small Data Rate Control Status
(including the number of packets still allowed in the given time unit, the
number of additional exception reports still allowed in the given time unit
and the termination time of the current Small Data Rate Control validity
period) may be stored in the AMF so that it can be retrieved for a subsequent
re-establishment of a new PDU Session.
At subsequent establishment of a new PDU Session, the (H-)SMF may receive the
previously stored Small Data Rate Control Status and if the validity period
has not expired, it provides the parameters to the UE in the PCO and to the
UPF/NEF as the initially applied parameters, in addition to the configured
Small Data Rate Control parameters. If the initially applied parameters are
provided, the UE and UPF or NEF shall apply them and shall use the SMF
provided configured Small Data Rate Control parameters once the initially
applied Small Data Rate Control validity period expires.
NOTE 1: Storage of Small Data Rate Control Status information for very long
time intervals can be implementation specific.
For the UPF and NEF, Small Data Rate Control is based on a \'maximum allowed
rate\' per direction. If (H-)SMF provided the \'number of additional allowed
exception report packets per time unit\', then the \'maximum allowed rate\' is
equal to the \'number of packets per time unit\' plus the \'number of
additional allowed exception report packets per time unit\', otherwise the
\'maximum allowed rate\' is equal to the \'number of packets per time unit\'.
The UPF or NEF may enforce the uplink rate by discarding or delaying packets
that exceed the \'maximum allowed rate\'. The UPF or NEF shall enforce the
downlink rate by discarding or delaying packets that exceed the downlink part
of the \'maximum allowed rate\'.
NOTE 2: It is assumed that the Serving PLMN Rate is sufficiently high to not
interfere with the Small Data Rate Control as the Small Data Rate Control, if
used, is assumed to allow fewer messages. NAS PDUs related to exception
reports are not subject to the Serving PLMN Rate Control.
For NB-IoT the AMF maintains an \"MO Exception Data Counter\" which is
incremented when the RRC establishment cause \"MO exception data\" is received
from NG-RAN. The AMF reports whether the UE accessed using \"MO exception
data\" RRC establishment cause, to all (H-)SMFs which have PDU Sessions that
are subject to Small Data Rate Control and if the UE is accessing using \"MO
exception data\" then the \"MO Exception Data Counter\" is also provided by
the AMF. The SMF indicates each use of the RRC establishment cause \"MO
Exception Data\" by including the related counter on the charging information.
NOTE 3: Since Exception Data PDUs and normal priority PDUs cannot be
distinguished within an RRC connection, the AMF is only counting the number of
RRC Connection establishments with \"MO Exception data\" priority.
If the UE moves to EPC then the UE and the PGW-U+UPF store the current Small
Data Rate Control Status for all PDU Sessions that are not released. If the UE
moves back to 5GC the stored Small Data Rate Control Status is restored and
continues to apply to PDU Session(s) that are moved from EPC to 5GC, taking
into account remaining validity period of the stored Small Data Rate Control
Status. When the UE moves to EPC the Small Data Rate Control Status for all
PDU Session(s) may also be stored in the AMF if the PDU Session is released
while the UE is connected to EPC and re-established when the UE moves to 5GC.
The time to store the Small Data Rate Control Status information is
implementation specific.
### 5.31.15 Control Plane Data Transfer Congestion Control
NAS level congestion control may be applied in general for all NAS messages.
To enable congestion control for control plane data transfer, a Control Plane
data back-off timer is used, see clause 5.19.7.6.
### 5.31.16 Service Gap Control
Service Gap Control is an optional feature intended for CIoT UEs to control
the frequency at which these UEs can access the network. That is, to ensure a
minimum time gap between consecutive Mobile Originated data communications
initiated by the UE. This helps reducing peak load situations when there are a
large number of these UEs in an operator network. Service Gap Control is
intended to be used for \"small data allowance plans\" for MTC/CIoT UEs where
the applications are tolerant to service latency.
NOTE 1: Time critical applications, such as regulatory prioritized services
like Emergency services can suffer from the latency caused by the Service Gap
Control feature. Therefore Service Gap Control feature is not recommended for
subscriptions with such applications and services.
Service Gap Time is a subscription parameter used to set the Service Gap timer
and is enforced in the UE and in the AMF on a per UE level (i.e. the same
Service Gap Timer applies for all PDU Sessions that the UE has). The UE
indicates its capability of support for Service Gap Control in the
Registration Request message to the AMF. The AMF passes the Service Gap Time
to the UE in the Registration Accept message for a UE that has indicated its
support of the Service Gap Control. The Service Gap Control shall be applied
in a UE when a Service Gap Time is stored in the UE context and applied in the
AMF when the Service Gap Time is stored in the UE Context in the AMF.
Service Gap Control requires the UE to stay in CM-IDLE mode for at least the
whole duration of the Service Gap timer before triggering Mobile Originated
user data transmission, except for procedures that are exempted (see TS 24.501
[47]). The Service Gap timer shall be started each time a UE moves from CM-
CONNECTED to CM-IDLE, unless the connection request was initiated by the
paging of a Mobile Terminated event, or after a Mobility or Periodic
Registration procedure without Follow-on Request indication and without Uplink
data status, which shall not trigger a new or extended Service Gap interval.
When a Service Gap timer expires, the UE is allowed to send a connection
request again. If the UE does so, the Service Gap timer will be restarted at
the next CM-CONNECTED to CM-IDLE transition.
The Service Gap control is applied in CM-IDLE state only and does not impact
UE Mobile Originated user data transmission or Mobile Originated signalling in
CM-CONNECTED state. The Service Gap timer is not stopped upon CM-IDLE state to
CM-CONNECTED state transition. The UE shall not initiate connection requests
for MO user plane data, MO control plane data, or MO SMS when a Service Gap
timer is running. The UE shall not initiate PDU Session Establishment Requests
when a Service Gap timer is running, unless it is for Emergency services which
are allowed. CM-CONNECTED with RRC_INACTIVE is not used for UEs that have a
Service Gap Time configured.
NOTE 2: As a consequence of allowing Initial Registration Request procedure,
the UE with a running Service Gap timer does not initiate further MO
signalling, except for Mobility Registration procedure, until the UE receives
MT signalling or after the UE has moved to CM-IDLE state and the Service Gap
Timer is not running.
NOTE 3: Implementations need to make sure that latest and up-to-date data are
always sent when a Service Gap timer expires.
The AMF may enforce the Service Gap timer by rejecting connection requests for
MO user plane data, MO control plane data, or MO SMS when a Service Gap timer
is running. The AMF may enforce the Service Gap timer by not allowing MO
signalling after Initial Registration requests when a Service Gap timer is
running except for Mobility Registration procedure, Periodic Registration
procedure or access to the network for regulatory prioritized services like
Emergency services, which are allowed. When rejecting the connection requests
and the SM signalling after Initial Registration Requests while the Service
Gap timer is running, the AMF may include a Mobility Management back-off timer
corresponding to the time left of the current Service Gap timer. For UEs that
do not support Service Gap Control (e.g. pre-release-16 UEs), Service Gap
Control may be enforced using \"General NAS level congestion control\" as
defined in clause 5.19.7.2.
NOTE 4: After MT signalling in CM-CONNECTED state the AMF does not further
restrict MO signalling when a Service Gap timer is running as this case is
considered equal to a connectivity request in response to paging.
When the AMF starts the Service Gap timer, the AMF should invoke the Service
Gap timer with a value that is slightly shorter than the Service Gap Time
value provided to the UE based on the subscription information received from
the UDM.
NOTE 5: This ensures that the AMF does not reject any UE requests just before
the Service Gap timer expires e.g. because of slightly unsynchronized timers
between UE and AMF.
A UE which transitions from a MICO mode or eDRX power saving state shall apply
Service Gap Control when it wakes up if the Service Gap timer is still
running.
Additional aspects of Service Gap Control:
\- Service Gap Control applies in all PLMNs.
\- When the Service Gap timer is running and the UE receives paging, the UE
shall respond as normal.
\- Service Gap Control does not apply to exception reporting for NB-IoT.
\- Access to the network for regulatory prioritized services like Emergency
services are allowed when a Service Gap timer is running.
\- Service Gap Control shall be effective also for UEs performing de-
registration and re-registration unless access to the network for regulatory
prioritized services like Emergency services is required.
\- If the Service Gap timer is running, the Service Gap is applied at PLMN
selection as follows:
a) Re-registration to the registered PLMN: The remaining Service Gap timer
value survives.
b) Registration to a different PLMN: The remaining Service Gap timer value
survives.
c) USIM swap: The Service Gap timer is no longer running and the Service Gap
feature does not apply, unless re-instantiated by the serving PLMN.
\- Multiple uplink packets and downlink packets are allowed during one RRC
connection for UE operating within its Rate Control limits.
The following procedures are impacted by Service Gap Control:
\- Registration Procedure, see clause 4.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3];
\- UE Triggered Service Request, see clause 4.2.3.2 of TS 23.502 [3];
NOTE 6: Since UE triggered Service Request is prevented by Service Gap timer,
this implicitly prevents the UE from initiating UPF anchored Mobile Originated
Data Transport in Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation (see clause 4.24.1 of TS
23.502 [3]), NEF Anchored Mobile Originated Data Transport (see clause 4.25.4
of TS 23.502 [3]) and MO SMS over NAS in CM-IDLE (see clause 4.13.3.3 of TS
23.502 [3]).
### 5.31.17 Inter-UE QoS for NB-IoT
To allow NG-RAN to prioritise resource allocation between different UEs
accessing via NB-IoT when some of the UEs are using Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation, NG-RAN may, based on configuration, retrieve from the AMF the
subscribed NB-IoT UE Priority for any UE accessing via NB-IoT by using the
UE\'s 5G-S-TMSI as the identifier.
In order to reduce signalling load on the AMF, NG-RAN may be configured to
request the NB-IoT UE Priority from the AMF e.g. only when the NG-RAN\'s NB-
IoT load exceeds certain threshold(s) or when the NG-RAN needs to cache the
QoS profile.
### 5.31.18 User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation
User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation enables transfer of user plane data from CM-
IDLE without the need for using the Service Request procedure to establish
Access Stratum (AS) context in NG-RAN and UE.
If the following preconditions are met:
\- UE and AMF negotiated support User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation (see clause
5.31.2) over NAS,
\- the UE has indicated support of User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation in the UE
radio capabilities as defined in TS 36.331 [51],
\- AMF has indicated User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation support for the UE to
NG-RAN,
\- the UE has established at least one PDU session with active UP connection,
i.e. AS context is established in NG-RAN and the UE,
then the RRC connection can be suspended by means of the Connection Suspend
Procedure (see clause 4.8.1.2 of TS 23.502 [3]).
Based on a trigger from the NAS layer when a UE is in CM-IDLE with Suspend,
the UE should attempt the Connection Resume in CM-IDLE with Suspend procedure
(clause 4.8.2.3 of TS 23.502 [3]). If the Connection Resume in CM-IDLE with
Suspend procedure fails, the UE initiates the pending NAS procedure. To
maintain support for User Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation for UE mobility across
different NG-RAN nodes, the AS Context should be transferred between the NG-
RAN nodes, see TS 38.300 [27] and TS 38.423 [99].
By using the Connection Suspend Procedure:
\- the UE at transition into CM-IDLE stores the AS information;
\- NG-RAN stores the AS information, the NGAP UE association and the PDU
session context for that UE;
\- AMF stores the NGAP UE association and other information necessary to later
resume the UE, interacts with the SMF(s) to deactivate the user plane
resources for the UE\'s PDU Sessions and enters CM-IDLE.
NG-RAN may decide based on implementation to delete the stored UE context and
NGAP association. In that case, the RAN shall initiate the AN Release
procedure as described in clause 4.2.6 of TS 23.502 [3]. NG-RAN does not
initiate any RRC procedure to notify the UE of the UE context release.
By using the Connection Resume in CM-IDLE with Suspend procedure:
\- the UE resumes the connection from CM-IDLE with the network using the AS
information stored during the Connection Suspend procedure;
\- NG-RAN notifies the AMF that the connection with the UE has been resumed;
\- AMF enters CM-CONNECTED and interacts with the SMF to activate the user
plane resources for the UE\'s PDU Sessions.
Early Data Transmission may be initiated by the UE for mobile originated User
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation during Connection Resume.
If the AMF establishes an NGAP UE association with a new NG-RAN node different
from the stored NGAP UE association, e.g. the UE initiates service request or
registration procedure from a different NG-RAN node, the AMF initiates UE N2
release command towards the old NG-RAN node.
NG-RAN maintains the N3 tunnel endpoint information while a UE is in CM-IDLE
with Suspend. UPF is instructed to remove DL N3 Tunnel Info of AN during
Connection Suspend procedure, while UPF keeps UL N3 Tunnel Info (i.e. UPF
accepts and forwards UL data). If a UE sends MO data with resume procedure,
the NG-RAN can send the MO data to the UPF which is addressed by the N3 tunnel
endpoint information. In the case of change of serving NG-RAN node due to UE
mobility, if NG-RAN determines that it is not able to connect to the UPF which
is addressed by the N3 tunnel endpoint information, NG-RAN performs Path
Switch procedure before sending the MO data received from the UE.
Early Data Transmission may be initiated by the UE for mobile originated User
Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation when the RAT Type is E-UTRA.
### 5.31.19 QoS model for NB-IoT
5GC QoS model described in clause 5.7 applies to NB-IoT with the following
requirements:
\- The default QoS rule shall be the only QoS rule of a PDU Session for a UE
connected to 5GC via NB-IoT. There is only one QoS Flow (corresponding to the
default QoS rule) per PDU session.
\- Reflective QoS is not supported over NB-IoT.
\- For NB-IoT, there is a 1:1 mapping between the QoS Flow corresponding to
the default QoS of a PDU session and a Data Radio Bearer when user plane
resources are active for that PDU session.
\- A maximum of two Data Radio Bearers are supported over NB-IoT. Therefore,
at most two PDU sessions can have active user plane resources at the same
time.
\- The capability of multiple UP resource support for NB-IoT UEs is indicated
in the UE 5GMM Core Network Capability (see TS 24.501 [47]). During PDU
Session Establishment or UP resource activation, the AMF checks if the UE can
support the establishment of user plane resources (See clause 4.2.3.2 and
clause 4.3.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3]).
### 5.31.20 Category M UEs differentiation
This functionality is used by the network to identify traffic to/from Category
M UEs, e.g. for charging differentiation.
A Category M UE using E-UTRA shall provide a Category M indication to the NG-
RAN during RRC Connection Establishment procedure as defined in TS 36.331
[51].
When the UE has provided a Category M indication to the NG-RAN during RRC
Connection Establishment, the NG-RAN shall provide an LTE-M Indication to the
AMF in the Initial UE Message (see clause 4.2.2.2.1 of TS 23.502 [3] and TS
38.413 [34]).
When the AMF receives an LTE-M Indication from NG-RAN in an Initial UE Message
or from an MME during EPS to 5GS handover, the AMF shall store the LTE-M
Indication in the UE context, consider that the RAT type is LTE-M and signal
it accordingly to the SMSF during registration procedure for SMS over NAS, to
the SMF during PDU Session Establishment or PDU Session Modification
procedure. The PCF will also receive the RAT Type as LTE-M, when applicable,
from the SMF during SM Policy Association Establishment or SM Policy
Association Modification procedure.
The NFs generating CDRs shall include the LTE-M RAT type in their CDRs.
Upon AMF change or inter-system mobility from 5GS to EPS, the source AMF shall
provide the \"LTE-M Indication\" to the target AMF or MME as part of the UE
context.
During EPS to 5GS Mobility Registration Procedure, the AMF shall disregard any
\"LTE-M Indication\" received from the MME in the UE context (see TS 23.401
[26]), and take into account the \"LTE-M Indication\" received from NG-RAN, as
specified above.
## 5.32 Support for ATSSS
### 5.32.1 General
The ATSSS feature is an optional feature that may be supported by the UE and
the 5GC network.
The ATSSS feature enables a multi-access PDU Connectivity Service, which can
exchange PDUs between the UE and a data network by simultaneously using one
3GPP access network and one non-3GPP access network and two independent N3/N9
tunnels between the PSA and RAN/AN. The multi-access PDU Connectivity Service
is realized by establishing a Multi-Access PDU (MA PDU) Session, i.e. a PDU
Session that may have user-plane resources on two access networks. This
assumes both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access are allowed for the S-NSSAI of
the PDU Session.
The UE may request a MA PDU Session when the UE is registered via both 3GPP
and non-3GPP accesses, or when the UE is registered via one access only.
After the establishment of a MA PDU Session, and when there are user-plane
resources on both access networks, the UE applies network-provided policy
(i.e. ATSSS rules) and considers local conditions (such as network interface
availability, signal loss conditions, user preferences, etc.) for deciding how
to distribute the uplink traffic across the two access networks. Similarly,
the UPF anchor of the MA PDU Session applies network-provided policy (i.e. N4
rules) and feedback information received from the UE via the user-plane (such
as access network Unavailability or Availability) for deciding how to
distribute the downlink traffic across the two N3/N9 tunnels and two access
networks. When there are user-plane resources on only one access network, the
UE applies the ATSSS rules and considers local conditions for triggering the
establishment or activation of the user plane resources over another access.
The type of a MA PDU Session may be one of the following types defined in
clause 5.6.1: IPv4, IPv6, IPv4v6, and Ethernet. In this release of the
specification, the Unstructured type is not supported. The clause 5.32.6.2.1
and the clause 5.32.6.3.1 below define what Steering Functionalities can be
used for each supported type of a MA PDU Session.
The handling of 3GPP PS Data Off feature for MA PDU Session is specified in
clause 5.24.
The ATSSS feature can be supported over any type of access network, including
untrusted and trusted non-3GPP access networks (see clauses 4.2.8 and 5.5),
wireline 5G access networks (see clause 4.2.8), etc., as long as a MA PDU
Session can be established over this type of access network.
In this Release of the specification, a MA PDU Session using IPv6 multi-homing
(see clause 5.6.4.3) or UL Classifier (see clause 5.6.4.2) is not specified.
In this Release of the specification, support for ATSSS assumes SMF Service
Areas covering the whole PLMN or that a MA PDU Session is released over both
accesses when the UE moves out of the SMF Service Area.
A MA PDU Session does not support LADN. If the AMF receives a request to
establish a MA PDU Session for a LADN DNN, the AMF shall reject the request.
If the AMF receives a request to establish a PDU Session for a LADN DNN with
\"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication, the AMF shall not forward \"MA
PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication to the SMF.
If the UE, due to mobility, moves from being served by a source AMF supporting
ATSSS to a target AMF not supporting ATSSS, the MA PDU Session is released as
described in TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 1: Deployment of ATSSS that is homogeneous per PLMN or network slice
enables consistent behaviour. In the case of non-homogenous support of ATSSS
in a PLMN/slice (i.e. some NFs in a PLMN/slice may not support ATSSS), MA PDU
Sessions can be released due to UE mobility.
A Multi-Access PDU Session may for the 3GPP access use user-plane resources of
an associated PDN Connection on 3GPP access in EPC instead of the 3GPP access
to 5GC. This enables a scenario where a MA PDU Session can simultaneously be
associated with user-plane resources on 3GPP access network connected to EPC
and non-3GPP access connected to 5GC. Such use of ATSSS with EPS interworking
may apply to Ethernet and IP-based PDU Session and PDN Connection types.
NOTE 2: A MA PDU Session with one 3GPP access connected to 5GC and one
non-3GPP access connected to EPC is not supported.
NOTE 3: Co-existence with NBIFOM is not defined. It is assumed that NBIFOM and
the multi-access connectivity described in this clause are not deployed in the
same network.
NOTE 4: To the MME and SGW this is a regular PDN Connection and the support
for ATSSS is transparent to MME and SGW.
For a MA PDU Session established for the Ethernet PDU Session type, if the UE
has not indicated support for Ethernet PDN connection type or if the network
does not support Ethernet PDN connection type, when the 3GPP access use user-
plane resources of an associated PDN Connection, the following takes place:
\- The SMF+PGW-C considers that the Multi-Access PDU Session is still using
the Ethernet PDU Session / PDN Connection type but in a restricted mode where
EPS signalling can only refer to non-IP PDN Connection type.
\- MAR rules in the UPF are still used for distributing DL traffic between
3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
\- For traffic on 3GPP access, the SMF may update N4 rules and QoS rules/EPS
bearer contexts on the UE to take into account that no QoS differentiation is
possible over 3GPP access.
This support of Multi-Access PDU Sessions using for the 3GPP access user-plane
resources of an associated PDN Connection instead of the 3GPP access to 5GC is
further defined in TS 23.502 [3].
The following clauses specify the functionality that enables ATSSS.
### 5.32.2 Multi Access PDU Sessions
A Multi-Access PDU (MA PDU) Session is managed by using the session management
functionality specified in clause 5.6, with the following additions and
modifications:
\- When the UE wants to request a new MA PDU Session:
\- If the UE is registered to the same PLMN over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses,
then the UE shall send a PDU Session Establishment Request over any of the two
accesses. The UE also provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" in the UL
NAS Transport message. The AMF informs the SMF that the UE is registered over
both accesses and this triggers the establishment of user-plane resources on
both accesses and two N3/N9 tunnels between PSA and the RAN/AN.
\- If the UE is registered to different PLMNs over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses,
then the UE shall send a PDU Session Establishment Request over one access.
The UE also provides Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" in the UL NAS
Transport message. After this PDU Session is established with one N3/N9 tunnel
between the PSA and (R)AN established, the UE shall send another PDU Session
Establishment Request over the other access. The UE also provides the same PDU
Session ID and Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" in the UL NAS Transport
message. Two N3/N9 tunnels and User-plane resources on both accesses are
established.
\- If the UE is registered over one access only, then the UE shall send a PDU
Session Establishment Request over this access. The UE also provides Request
Type as \"MA PDU Request\" in the UL NAS Transport message. One N3/N9 tunnel
between the PSA and (R)AN and User-plane resources on this access only are
established. After the UE is registered over the second access, the UE shall
establish user-plane resources on the second access.
\- In the PDU Session Establishment Request that is sent to request a new MA
PDU Session, the UE shall provide also its ATSSS capabilities, which indicate
the steering functionalities and the steering modes supported in the UE. These
functionalities are defined in clause 5.32.6.
\- If the UE indicates it is capable of supporting the ATSSS-LL functionality
with any steering mode (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1) and the network
accepts to activate this functionality, then the network may provide to UE
Measurement Assistance Information (see details in clause 5.32.5) and shall
provide to UE one or more ATSSS rules.
\- If the UE indicates it is capable of supporting the MPTCP functionality
with any steering mode and the ATSSS-LL functionality with only the Active-
Standby steering mode (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1) and the network
accepts to activate these functionalities, then the network provides MPTCP
proxy information to UE, and allocates to UE one IP address/prefix for the MA
PDU session (as defined in clause 5.8.2.2) and two additional IP
addresses/prefixes, called \"link-specific multipath\" addresses. Further
details are provided in clause 5.32.6.2. In addition, the network may provide
to UE Measurement Assistance Information and shall provide to UE one or more
ATSSS rules including an ATSSS rule for non-MPTCP traffic. The ATSSS rule for
non-MPTCP traffic shall use the ATSSS-LL functionality and the Active-Standby
Steering Mode to indicate how the non-MPTCP traffic shall be transferred
across the 3GPP access and the non-3GPP access in the uplink direction.
\- If the UE indicates it is capable of supporting the MPTCP functionality
with any steering mode and the ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode
(as specified in clause 5.32.6.1) and the network accepts to activate these
functionalities, then the network provides MPTCP proxy information to UE, and
allocates to UE one IP address/prefix for the MA PDU session (as defined in
clause 5.8.2.2) and two additional IP addresses/prefixes, called \"link-
specific multipath\" addresses. Further details are provided in clause
5.32.6.2. In addition, the network may provide to UE Measurement Assistance
Information and shall provide to UE one or more ATSSS rules.
\- If the UE requests an S-NSSAI, this S-NSSAI should be allowed on both
accesses. Otherwise, the MA PDU Session shall not be established.
\- The SMF determines the ATSSS capabilities supported for the MA PDU Session
based on the ATSSS capabilities provided by the UE and per DNN configuration
on SMF, as follows:
a) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPTCP functionality with any
steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with only Active-Standby steering
mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1), the DNN configuration allows both
MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode, including RTT measurement without
using PMF protocol, the MA PDU Session is capable of (1) MPTCP and ATSSS-LL
with any steering mode in the downlink, and (2) MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with
Active-Standby mode in the uplink.
NOTE 1: In this case, it is assumed that ATSSS-LL with \"Smallest Delay\"
steering mode is selected for the downlink only when the UPF can measure RTT
without using the PMF protocol, e.g. by using other means not defined by 3GPP
such as using the RTT measurements of MPTCP.
b) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPTCP functionality with any
steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with only Active-Standby steering
mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1), the DNN configuration allows both
MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode, but not RTT measurement without
using PMF protocol, the MA PDU Session is capable of (1) MPTCP with any
steering mode in the downlink (2) ATSSS-LL with any steering mode except
Smallest Delay steering mode in the downlink, and (3) MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with
Active-Standby mode in the uplink.
c) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPTCP functionality with any
steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with only Active-Standby steering
mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1) and if the DNN configuration allows
MPTCP with any steering mode and ATSSS-LL with only Active-Standby steering
mode, the MA PDU Session is capable of MPTCP and ATSSS-LL with Active-Standby
mode in the uplink and in the downlink.
d) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"ATSSS-LL functionality with
any steering mode\" (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1) and the DNN
configuration allows ATSSS-LL with any steering mode, the MA PDU Session is
capable of ATSSS-LL with any steering mode in the uplink and in the downlink.
e) If the UE includes in its ATSSS capabilities \"MPTCP functionality with any
steering mode and ATSSS-LL functionality with any steering mode\" (as
specified in clause 5.32.6.1), and the DNN configuration allows both MPTCP and
ATSSS-LL with any steering mode, the MA PDU Session is capable of both MPTCP
and ATSSS-LL with any steering mode in the uplink and in the downlink.
The SMF provides the ATSSS capabilities of the MA PDU Session to the PCF
during PDU Session Establishment.
\- The PCC rules provided by PCF include MA PDU Session Control information
(see TS 23.503 [45]). They are used by SMF to derive ATSSS rules for the UE
and N4 rules for the UPF. When dynamic PCC is not used for the MA PDU Session,
the SMF shall provide ATSSS rules and N4 rules based on local configuration
(e.g. based on DNN or S-NSSAI).
\- The UE receives ATSSS rules from SMF, which indicate how the uplink traffic
should be routed across 3GPP access and non-3GPP access. Similarly, the UPF
receives N4 rules from SMF, which indicate how the downlink traffic should be
routed across 3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
\- When the SMF receives a PDU Session Establishment Request and a \"MA PDU
Request\" indication and determines that UP security protection (see clause
5.10.3) is required for the PDU Session, the SMF shall only confirm the
establishment of the MA PDU session if the 3GPP access network can enforce the
required UP security protection. The SMF needs not confirm whether the
non-3GPP access can enforce the required UP security protection.
\- After the MA PDU Session establishment:
\- At any given time, the MA PDU session may have user-plane resources on both
3GPP and non-3GPP accesses, or on one access only, or may have no user-plane
resources on any access.
\- The AMF, SMF, PCF and UPF maintain their MA PDU Session contexts, even when
the UE deregisters from one access (but remains registered on the other
access).
\- When the UE deregisters from one access (but remains registered on the
other access), the AMF informs the SMF to release the resource of this access
type in the UPF for the MA PDU Session. Subsequently, the SMF notifies the UPF
that the access type has become unavailable and the N3/N9 tunnel for the
access type are released.
\- If the UE wants to add user-plane resources on one access of the MA PDU
Session, e.g. based on access network performance measurement and/or ATSSS
rules, then the UE shall send a PDU Session Establishment Request over this
access containing PDU Session ID of the MA PDU Session. The UE also provides
Request Type as \"MA PDU Request\" and the same PDU Session ID in the UL NAS
Transport message. If there is no N3/N9 tunnel for this access, the N3/N9
tunnel for this access is established.
\- If the UE wants to re-activate user-plane resources on one access of the MA
PDU Session, e.g. based on access network performance measurement and/or ATSSS
rules, then the UE shall initiate the UE Triggered Service Request procedure
over this access.
\- If the network wants to re-activate the user-plane resources over 3GPP
access or non-3GPP access of the MA PDU Session, the network shall initiate
the Network Triggered Service Request procedure, as specified in clause 4.22.7
of TS 23.502 [3].
\- The SMF may add, remove or update one or more individual ATSSS rules of the
UE by sending new or updated ATSSS rules with the corresponding Rule IDs to
the UE.
A MA PDU Session may be established either:
a) when it is explicitly requested by an ATSSS-capable UE; or
b) when an ATSSS-capable UE requests a single-access PDU Session but the
network decides to establish a MA PDU Session instead. This is an optional
scenario specified in clause 4.22.3 of TS 23.502 [3], which may occur when the
UE requests a single-access PDU Session but no policy (e.g. no URSP rule) and
no local restrictions in the UE mandate a single access for the PDU Session.
A MA PDU Session may be established during a PDU Session modification
procedure when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS, as specified in clause 4.22.6.3
of TS 23.502 [3].
The AMF indicates as part of the Registration procedure whether ATSSS is
supported or not. When ATSSS is not supported, the UE shall not
\- request establishment of a MA PDU Session (as described in clause 4.22.2 of
TS 23.502 [3]); or
\- request addition of User Plane resources for an existing MA PDU Session (as
described in clause 4.22.7 of TS 23.502 [3]); or
\- request establishment of a PDU Session with \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade
Allowed\" indication (as described in clause 4.22.3 of TS 23.502 [3]); or
\- request PDU Session Modification with Request Type of \"MA PDU request\" or
with \"MA PDU Network-Upgrade Allowed\" indication after moving from EPC to
5GC (as described in clause 4.22.6.3 of TS 23.502 [3]).
An ATSSS-capable UE may decide to request a MA PDU Session based on the
provisioned URSP rules. In particular, the UE should request a MA PDU Session
when the UE applies a URSP rule, which triggers the UE to establish a new PDU
Session and the Access Type Preference component of the URSP rule indicates
\"Multi-Access\" (see TS 23.503 [45]).
### 5.32.3 Policy for ATSSS Control
If dynamic PCC is to be used for the MA PDU Session, the PCF may take ATSSS
policy decisions and create PCC rules that contain MA PDU Session Control
information, (as specified in TS 23.503 [45]), which determines how the uplink
and the downlink traffic of the MA PDU Session should be distributed across
the 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses. If dynamic PCC is not deployed, local policy
in SMF is used.
The SMF receives the PCC rules with MA PDU Session Control information and
maps these rules into (a) ATSSS rules, which are sent to the UE, and (b) N4
rules, which are sent to the UPF. The ATSSS rules are provided as a
prioritized list of rules (see clause 5.32.8), which are applied by the UE to
enforce the ATSSS policy in the uplink direction and the N4 Rules are applied
by the UPF to enforce the ATSSS policy in the downlink direction.
The ATSSS rules are sent to UE with a NAS message when the MA PDU Session is
created or updated by the SMF, e.g. after receiving updated/new PCC rules from
the PCF. Similarly, the N4 rules are sent to UPF when the MA PDU Session is
created or updated by the SMF.
The details of the policy control related to ATSSS are specified in TS 23.503
[45].
### 5.32.4 QoS Support
The 5G QoS model for the Single-Access PDU Session is also applied to the MA
PDU Session, i.e. the QoS Flow is the finest granularity of QoS
differentiation in the MA PDU Session. One difference compared to the Single-
Access PDU Session is that in a MA PDU Session there can be separate user-
plane tunnels between the AN and the PSA, each one associated with a different
access. However, the QoS Flow is not associated with specific access, i.e. it
is access agnostic, so the same QoS is supported when the traffic is
distributed over 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses. The SMF shall provide the same
QFI in 3GPP and non-3GPP accesses so that the same QoS is supported in both
accesses.
A QoS Flow of the MA PDU Session may be either Non-GBR or GBR depending on its
QoS profile.
For a Non-GBR QoS Flow, the SMF provides a QoS profile 5G-AN(s) during MA PDU
Session Establishment or MA PDU Session Modification procedure:
\- During MA PDU Session Establishment procedure, the QoS profile to both ANs
if the UE is registered over both accesses.
\- During MA PDU Session Modification procedure, the QoS profile is provided
to the 5G-AN(s) over which the user plane resources are activated.
For a GBR QoS Flow, the SMF shall provide a QoS profile to a single access
network as follows:
\- If the PCC rule allows a GBR QoS Flow in a single access, the SMF provides
the QoS profile for the GBR QoS Flow to the access network allowed by the PCC
rule.
\- If the PCC rule allows a GBR QoS Flow in both accesses, the SMF decides to
which access network to provide the QoS profile for the GBR QoS Flow based on
its local policy (e.g. the access where the traffic is ongoing according to
the Multi Access Routing rules).
For a GBR QoS Flow, traffic splitting is not supported because the QoS profile
is provided to a single access network at a given time. If the UPF determines
that it cannot send GBR traffic over the current ongoing access e.g. based on
the N4 rules and access availability and unavailability report from the UE as
described in clause 5.32.5.3, the UPF shall send an Access Availability report
to the SMF. Based on the report, the SMF decides whether to move GBR QoS Flows
to the other access:
\- if the PCC rule allows the GBR QoS Flows only on this access, the SMF shall
release the resources for the GBR QoS Flow and report to the PCF about the
removal of the PCC rule.
\- if the corresponding PCC rule allows the GBR QoS Flow on both accesses and
the other access is not available, the SMF shall release the resources for the
GBR QoS Flow and report to the PCF about the removal of the PCC rule.
\- if the PCC rule allows the GBR QoS Flow on both accesses and the other
access is available, the SMF shall try to move the GBR QoS Flow to the other
access. The SMF may trigger a PDU session modification procedure to provide
the QoS profile to the other access and release the resources for the GBR QoS
Flow in the current access.
\- If Notification Control parameter is not included in the PCC rule for the
GBR QoS Flow and the other access does not accept the QoS profile, the SMF
shall release the resources for the GBR QoS Flow and report to the PCF about
the removal of the PCC rule.
\- if the Notification Control parameter is included in the PCC rule, the SMF
shall notify the PCF that GFBR can no longer be guaranteed. After the other
access accepts the QoS profile, the SMF shall notify the PCF that GFBR can
again be guaranteed. If the other access does not accept the QoS profile, the
SMF shall delete the GBR QoS Flow and report to the PCF about the removal of
the PCC rule.
NOTE 1: The ATSSS rule for GBR QoS Flow only allows the UE to steer traffic
over a single access so that network knows in which access the UE sends GBR
traffic. If the network wants to move GBR QoS Flow to the other access, the
network needs to update ATSSS rule of the UE.
When the MA PDU Session is established or when the MA PDU Session is modified,
the SMF may provide QoS rule(s) to the UE via one access, which are applied by
the UE as specified in clause 5.7.1.4. The QoS rule(s) provided by SMF via one
access are commonly used for both 3GPP access and non-3GPP access, so the QoS
classification is independent of ATSSS rules.
The derived QoS rule generated by Reflective QoS is applied independently of
the access on which the RQI was received. When the MPTCP functionality is used
in the UE, the UE shall use the IP address/prefix of the MA PDU Session and
the final destination address to generate the derived QoS rule.
When MPTCP functionality is enabled for the MA PDU Session:
\- any QoS rules or PDRs that apply to the MA PDU Session IP address/prefix
and port also apply to the \"link-specific multipath\" addresses/prefixes and
ports used by the UE to establish MPTCP subflows over 3GPP and non-3GPP
accesses; and
\- any QoS rules or PDRs that apply to the IP address/prefix and port of the
final destination server in DN also apply to the IP address and port of the
MPTCP proxy for corresponding MPTCP subflows that are terminated at the proxy.
NOTE 2: How these associations are made is left up to the UE and UPF
implementations.
### 5.32.5 Access Network Performance Measurements
#### 5.32.5.1 General principles
When an MA PDU Session is established, the network may provide the UE with
Measurement Assistance Information. This information assists the UE in
determining which measurements shall be performed over both accesses, as well
as whether measurement reports need to be sent to the network.
Measurement Assistance Information shall include the addressing information of
a Performance Measurement Function (PMF) in the UPF, the UE can send PMF
protocol messages to:
\- For a PDU Session of IP type, Measurement Assistance Information contains
one IP address for the PMF, one UDP port associated with 3GPP access and
another UDP port associated with non-3GPP access. PMF messages sent by UE to
one of these UDP ports, shall be transmitted to UPF via the QoS Flow
associated with the default QoS rule.
\- For a PDU Session of Ethernet type, Measurement Assistance Information
contains one MAC address associated with 3GPP access and another MAC address
associated with non-3GPP access. PMF messages sent by UE to one of these MAC
addresses, shall be transmitted to UPF via the QoS Flow associated with the
default QoS rule.
NOTE 1: To protect the PMF in the UPF (e.g. to block DDOS to the PMF), the IP
addresses of the PMF are only accessible from the UE IP address via the N3/N9
interface.
NOTE 2: After the MA PDU Session is released, the same UE IP address/prefix is
not allocated to another UE for MA PDU Session in a short time.
If the SMF determines that access performance measurements per QoS Flow shall
be applied for the MA PDU Session, then the Measurement Assistance Information
shall also include a list of QoS Flows on which access performance
measurements may be performed. For each QoS Flow in this list, the following
information is included:
\- The QFI of the associated QoS Flow.
\- For a PDU Session of IP type, one UDP port associated with 3GPP access and
another UDP port associated with non-3GPP access. PMF messages sent by UE to
one of these UDP ports, shall be transmitted to UPF via the associated QoS
Flow.
\- For a PDU Session of Ethernet type, one MAC address associated with 3GPP
access and another MAC address associated with non-3GPP access. PMF messages
sent by UE to one of these MAC addresses, shall be transmitted to UPF via the
associated QoS Flow.
The QoS rules and the N4 rules provided by SMF to UE and to UPF respectively
shall include information (e.g. packet filters containing the UDP port or the
MAC address associated with a QoS Flow), which enables the UE and UPF to route
a PMF message to a specific QoS Flow.
The UE and the UPF may need to perform access performance measurements in
order to estimate the Round-Trip Time (RTT) and/or the Packet Loss Rate (PLR)
that an SDF is expected to experience when transmitted on a certain access
type. Based on these measurements and the provisioned ATSSS rules in the UE
and MAR rules in the UPF, the UE and the UPF decide how to distribute the
traffic of an SDF across the two accesses.
If the UE and the UPF decide to initiate access performance measurements to
estimate the RTT and/or the PLR for an SDF, the access performance
measurements shall be performed either
(a) using the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule; or
(b) using the target QoS Flow, which is the QoS Flow that the SDF traffic is
transmitted on.
When the access performance measurements are using the target QoS Flow, it is
termed that \"access performance measurements per QoS Flow\" are applied for
the MA PDU Session.
The UE shall indicate in its ATSSS capabilities that it supports access
performance measurements per QoS Flow. Based on this UE capability and other
information (such as local policy), the SMF determines whether access
performance measurements per QoS Flow shall be applied for the MA PDU Session
or not. If the SMF determines that access performance measurements per QoS
Flow shall be applied for the MA PDU Session, then:
\- The SMF determines a list of QoS Flows over which access performance
measurements may be performed and provides this list to the UE (within the
Measurement Assistance Information) and to the UPF.
\- The UE and the UPF may initiate access performance measurements on one or
more of the QoS Flows included in this list. The UE and the UPF shall be able
to receive and respond to PMF messages sent on any QoS Flow included in this
list.
\- The SMF may update the list of QoS Flows over which access performance
measurements may be performed during the lifetime of a MA PDU Session, e.g.
when a new PCC rule that could benefit from PMF access performance
measurements is bound to a QoS Flow.
NOTE 3: The SMF can e.g. add a QoS Flow into the list when at least one PCC
Rule is bound to that QoS Flow that is using one of the Steering Modes where
performance measurements via PMF are applicable, such as Lowest Delay Steering
Mode or a Steering Mode where threshold values have been provided.
The UE shall perform access performance measurements per QoS Flow only when
this is explicitly indicated in the Measurement Assistance Information, i.e.
only when the UE receives the list of QoS Flows over which access performance
measurements may be performed. Otherwise, the UE shall perform access
performance measurements based on the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS
rule. The UPF shall perform access performance measurements per QoS Flow only
when this is explicitly indicated by SMF, i.e. only when the UPF receives the
list of QoS Flows over which access performance measurements may be performed.
Otherwise, the UPF shall perform access performance measurements based on the
QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule. In this case the UPF learns
what QoS Flow to use as described in TS 29.244 [65].
The UE and the UPF may decide not to initiate access performance measurements
using PMF over a certain target QoS Flow, when they already have access
performance measurements for another target QoS Flow which they determine can
be reused.
NOTE 4: How the UE and UPF determine that the performance measurements using a
certain target QoS Flow apply to another target QoS Flow is based on
implementation, e.g. AN resource to QoS Flow mapping in the UE or getting
similar access measurements results with other QoS Flow.
When access performance measurements for an SDF are performed based on the
target QoS Flow, the UE needs to be able to determine the QoS Flow a downlink
packet arrives on. In order to enable this, the SMF shall include downlink
Packet Filter information in the QoS rule provided to UE matching this SDF,
unless Reflective QoS is used for the SDF.
NOTE 5: For example, if a QoS Flow requires to activate Reflective QoS, the
SMF does not need to provide downlink QoS Flow information for the QoS Flow to
minimize usage of packet filters. When a data packet is received over a QoS
Flow, the UE can decide whether to check the downlink QoS Flow information
based on the existence of SDAP header for the QoS Flow.
The addressing information of the PMF in the UPF is retrieved by the SMF from
the UPF during N4 session establishment. If the UPF receives from the SMF,
during N4 session establishment or modification procedure, a list of QoS Flows
over which access performance measurements may be performed, the UPF allocates
different UDP ports per QoS Flow per access for IP PDU sessions, or allocates
different MAC addresses per QoS Flow per access for Ethernet PDU sessions. For
IP PDU sessions, the UPF sends the PMF IP addressing information and the UDP
ports with the QFI of the associated QoS Flow to the SMF. For Ethernet PDU
sessions, the UPF sends the MAC addresses with the QFI of the associated QoS
Flow to the SMF.
The following PMF protocol messages can be exchanged between the UE and the
PMF:
\- Messages to allow for Round Trip Time (RTT) measurements, i.e. when the
\"Smallest Delay\" steering mode is used or when either \"Priority-based\" or
\"Load-Balancing\" steering mode is used with RTT threshold value being
applied;
\- Messages to allow for Packet Loss Rate (PLR) measurements, i.e. when
steering mode is used either \"Priority-based\" or \"Load-Balancing\" steering
mode is used with PLR threshold value being applied;
\- Messages for reporting Access availability/unavailability by the UE to the
UPF.
\- Messages for sending UE-assistance data to UPF. Such messages may be sent
from the UE to UPF only when the UE receives the UE-assistance indicator in an
ATSSS rule, as specified in clause 5.32.8. Further details are provided in
clause 5.32.5.5.
Since steering modes can be different in up-link and down-link, the UE needs
to be able to handle PMF protocol messages for RTT and PLR measurements
received from UPF even if it is not using one of the steering modes associated
with the RTT and PLR measurements (and vice versa).
The PMF protocol is specified in TS 24.193 [109].
The PMF protocol messages used for access availability/unavailability reports
shall be sent on the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule. The PMF
protocol messages used for access performance measurements shall be sent
either on the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule, or on the target
QoS Flow, as specified above.
The QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule for MA PDU Session is Non-
GBR QoS Flow.
The UE shall not apply the ATSSS rules and the UPF shall not apply the MAR
rules for the PMF protocol messages.
When the UE requests a MA PDU session and indicates it is capable to support
the MPTCP functionality with any steering mode and the ATSSS-LL functionality
with only the Active-Standby steering mode (as specified in clause 5.32.6.1),
the network may send Measurement Assistance Information for the UE to send
Access availability/unavailability reports to the UPF. In this case, the UE
and UPF shall not perform RTT and PLR measurements using PMF as the UE and UPF
can use measurements available at the MPTCP layer.
#### 5.32.5.1a Address of PMF messages
As described in clause 5.32.5.2, 5.32.5.2a and 5.32.5.3, a UE and UPF may
exchange PMF messages to measure access performance and report access
availability/unavailability. When the UE and UPF exchanges PMF message, source
and destination address of the PMF messages shall be assigned as follows:
1\. In the case of a MA PDU Session of IP type:
\- If access performance measurements are performed only over the QoS Flow
associated with the default QoS rule, the PMF in the UE sends PMF messages to
the PMF in the UPF over UDP/IP. The destination IP address is the IP address
contained in the Measurement Assistance Information and the destination UDP
port is one of the two UDP ports contained in the Measurement Assistance
Information. One UDP port is used for sending PMF messages to UPF over 3GPP
access and the other UDP port is used for sending PMF messages to UPF over
non-3GPP access. The source IP address is the IP address assigned to UE for
the MA PDU Session and the source UDP port is a UDP port that is dynamically
allocated by the UE for PMF communication. This source UDP port in the UE
remains the same for the entire lifetime of the MA PDU Session.
If access performance measurements per QoS Flow is performed, the Measurement
Assistance Information contains UDP ports, one for each QoS Flow and access
combination. When the UE sends PMF message over a QoS Flow of an access, the
UE shall set the destination UDP port as the UDP port for the QoS Flow and the
access in Measurement Assistance information.
\- If access performance measurements are performed only over the QoS Flow
associated with the default QoS rule, the PMF in the UPF sends PMF messages to
the PMF in the UE over UDP/IP. The source IP address is the same IP address as
the one provided in the Measurement Assistance Information and the source UDP
port is one of the two UDP ports as provided in the Measurement Assistance
Information. One UDP port is used for sending PMF messages to UE over 3GPP
access and the other UDP port is used for sending PMF messages to UE over the
non-3GPP access. The destination IPv4 address is the IPv4 address assigned to
UE for the MA PDU Session (if any) and the destination IPv6 address is an IPv6
address selected by the UE from the IPv6 prefix assigned for the MA PDU
Session (if any). The destination UDP port is the dynamically allocated UDP
port in the UE, which is contained in all PMF messages received from the UE.
If access performance measurements per QoS Flow is performed, when the UPF
sends PMF message over a QoS Flow of an access, the UPF shall set the source
UDP port with the UDP port for the QoS Flow and the access as the one for the
QoS Flow and the access provided in Measurement Assistance information.
\- If the UE receives Measurement Assistance Information, the UE shall inform
the network via the user plane about the UE\'s dynamically allocated UDP port,
and the IPv6 address if IPv6 is used for PMF messages, so that it is possible
for the UPF to know the UE\'s IPv6 address (if applicable) and dynamically
allocated UDP port as soon as the MA PDU Session has been established.
NOTE 1: Regardless of whether access performance measurements per QoS Flow is
applied or not, the UE only allocates a single UDP port for PMF messages.
2\. In the case of a MA PDU Session of Ethernet type:
\- The PMF in the UE sends PMF messages to the PMF in the UPF over Ethernet.
The Ethertype is the Ethertype contained in the Measurement Assistance
Information. If access performance measurements are performed only over the
QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule, the destination MAC address is
one of the two MAC addresses contained in the Measurement Assistance
Information. One MAC address is used for sending PMF messages to UPF over 3GPP
access and the other MAC address is used for sending PMF messages to UPF over
non-3GPP access. The source MAC address is a MAC address of the UE, which
remains the same for the entire lifetime of the MA PDU Session.
If access performance measurements per QoS Flow is performed, Measurement
Assistance Information contains MAC addresses for each QoS Flow and each
access. When the UE sends PMF message over a QoS Flow of an access, the UE
shall set the destination MAC address as the MAC address for the QoS Flow and
the access in Measurement Assistance information.
\- The PMF in the UPF sends PMF messages to the PMF in the UE over Ethernet.
The Ethertype is the same Ethertype as the one provided in the Measurement
Assistance Information. If access performance measurements are performed only
over the QoS Flow associated with the default QoS rule, the source MAC address
is one of the two MAC addresses as provided in the Measurement Assistance
Information. One MAC address is used for sending PMF messages to UE over 3GPP
access and the other MAC address is used for sending PMF messages to UE over
non-3GPP access. The destination MAC address is the MAC address of the UE,
which is contained in all PMF messages received from the UE.
If access performance measurements per QoS Flow is performed, when the UPF
sends PMF message over a QoS Flow of an access, the UPF shall set the source
MAC address with the MAC address for the QoS Flow and the access as the one
for the QoS Flow and the access provided in Measurement Assistance
information.
\- If the UE receives Measurement Assistance Information, the UE shall inform
the network via the user plane about the UE\'s MAC address so that it is
possible for the UPF to know the UE\'s MAC address as soon as the MA PDU
Session has been established.
NOTE 2: Regardless of whether access performance measurements per QoS Flow is
applied or not, the UE only use a single MAC address.
#### 5.32.5.2 Round Trip Time Measurements
RTT measurements can be conducted by the UE and UPF independently. There is no
measurement reporting from one side to the other. RTT measurements are defined
to support the \"Smallest Delay\", \"Priority-based\" or \"Load Balancing\"
steering mode (i.e. when RTT threshold value is applied).
The estimation of the RTT by the UE and by the UPF is based on the following
mechanism:
1\. The PMF in the UE sends over the user plane PMF-Echo Request messages to
the PMF in the UPF, and the PMF in the UPF responds to each one with a PMF-
Echo Response message. Similarly, the PMF in the UPF sends over the user plane
PMF-Echo Request messages to the PMF in the UE, and the PMF in the UE responds
to each one with a PMF-Echo Response message.
2\. When the UP connection of the MA PDU session is deactivated on an access,
no PMF-Echo Request messages are sent on this access. The PMF in the UPF shall
not send PMF-Echo Request on this access if the UP connection is not available
or after it receives notification from the (H-)SMF to stop sending the PMF-
Echo Request on this access.
3\. The UE and the UPF derive an estimation of the average RTT over an access
type and QoS Flow by averaging the RTT measurements obtained over this access
type and QoS Flow.
#### 5.32.5.2a Packet Loss Rate Measurements
The UE and the UPF may decide to estimate the Packet Loss Rate (PLR) for an
SDF over both accesses. For example, the UE may take this decision when an
ATSSS rule in the UE requires the traffic of an SDF to be steered in
accordance with a PLR-based threshold condition (e.g. PLR \ maps to EPS \
\- 5G \ maps to EPS \
\- 5G \ and 5G \ maps to EPS \ and part of
EPS \
\- 5G \ map to part of EPS \
\- 5G \ maps to EPS \
NOTE 1: The mapping described above does not necessarily imply the same size
for the 5G GUTI and EPS GUTI fields that are mapped. The size of 5G GUTI
fields and other mapping details will be defined in TS 23.003 [19].
NOTE 2: To support interworking with the legacy EPC core network entity (i.e.
when MME is not updated to support interworking with 5GS), it is assumed that
the 5G \ and EPS \ is partitioned to avoid overlapping
values in order to enable discovery of source node (i.e. MME or AMF) without
ambiguity. Once the EPS in the PLMN has been updated to support interworking
with 5GS, the full address space of the AMF Region ID can be used for 5GS.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Guidelines and Principles for Compute-Storage
Separation
5G System Architecture allows any NF/NF Service to store and retrieve its
unstructured data (e.g. UE contexts) into/from a Storage entity (e.g. UDSF) as
stated in clause 4.2.5 in this release of the specification. This clause
highlights some assumptions, principles regarding NF/NF services that use this
Storage entity for storing unstructured data:
1\. It is up to the Network Function implementation to determine whether the
Storage entity is used as a Primary Storage (in which case the corresponding
context stored within the NF/NF Service is deleted after storage in the
Storage entity) or the Storage entity is used as a Secondary Storage (in which
case the corresponding context within the NF/NF Service is stored).
2\. It is up to the NF/NF Service implementation to determine the trigger
(e.g. at the end of Registration procedure, Service Request procedure etc) for
storing unstructured data (e.g. UE contexts) in the Storage entity but it is a
good practice for NF/NF service to store stable state in the Storage entity.
3\. Multiple NF/NF service instances may require to access the same stored
data in the Storage entity (e.g. UE context), around the same time, then the
resolution the race condition is implementation specific.
4\. In the case of AMF, all AMFs within the same AMF Set are assumed to have
access to the same unstructured data stored within the Storage entity.
5\. AMF planned removal with UDSF (clause 5.21.2.2.1) and AMF auto-recovery
(with UDSF option in clause 5.21.2.3) assume that a storage entity/UDSF is
used either as a primary storage or secondary storage by the AMF for storing
UE contexts.
###### ## Annex D (informative): 5GS support for Non-Public Network deployment
options
# D.1 Introduction
This annex provides guidance on how 5GS features and capabilities can be used
to support various Non-Public Network deployment options.
**Overlay network:** When UE is accessing SNPN service via NWu using user
plane established in PLMN, SNPN is the overlay network. When UE is accessing
PLMN services via NWu using user plane established in SNPN, PLMN is the
overlay network.
**Underlay network:** When UE is accessing SNPN service via NWu using user
plane established in PLMN, PLMN is the underlay network. When UE is accessing
PLMN services via NWu using user plane established in SNPN, SNPN is the
underlay network
# D.2 Support of Non-Public Network as a network slice of a PLMN
The PLMN operator can provide access to an NPN by using network slicing
mechanisms.
NOTE: Access to PLMN services can be supported in addition to PNI-NPN
services, e.g. based on different S-NSSAI/DNN for different services.
The following are some considerations in such a PNI-NPN case:
1\. The UE has subscription and credentials for the PLMN;
2\. The PLMN and NPN service provider have an agreement of where the NPN
Network Slice is to be deployed (i.e. in which TAs of the PLMN and optionally
including support for roaming PLMNs);
3\. The PLMN subscription includes support for Subscribed S-NSSAI to be used
for the NPN (see clause 5.15.3);
4\. The PLMN operator can offer possibilities for the NPN service provider to
manage the NPN Network Slice according to TS 28.533 [79].
5\. When the UE registers the first time to the PLMN, the PLMN can configure
the UE with URSP including NSSP associating Applications to the NPN S-NSSAI
(if the UE also is able to access other PLMN services);
6\. The PLMN can configure the UE with Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN
(see clause 5.15.4);
7\. The PLMN and NPN can perform a Network Slice specific authentication and
authorization using additional NPN credentials;
8\. The UE follows the logic as defined for Network Slicing, see clause 5.15;
9\. The network selection logic, access control etc are following the
principles for PLMN selection; and
10\. The PLMN may indicate to the UE that the NPN S-NSSAI is rejected for the
RA when the UE moves out of the coverage of the NPN Network Slice. However,
limiting the availability of the NPN S-NSSAI would imply that the NPN is not
available outside of the area agreed for the NPN S-NSSAI, e.g. resulting in
the NPN PDU Sessions being terminated when the UE moves out of the coverage of
the NPN Network Slice. Similarly access to NPN DNNs would not be available via
non-NPN cells.
11\. In order to prevent access to NPNs for authorized UE(s) in the case of
network congestion/overload and if a dedicated S-NSSAI has been allocated for
an NPN, the Unified Access Control can be used using the operator-defined
access categories with access category criteria type (as defined in TS 24.501
[47]) set to the S-NSSAI used for an NPN.
12\. If NPN isolation is desired, it is assumed that a dedicated S-NSSAI is
configured for the NPN and that the UE is configured to operate in Access
Stratum Connection Establishment NSSAI Inclusion Mode a, b or c, see clause
5.15.9, such that NG-RAN receives Requested NSSAI from the UE and it can use
the S-NSSAI for AMF selection.
# D.3 Support for access to PLMN services via Stand-alone Non-Public Network
and access to Stand-alone Non Public Network services via PLMN
Figure D.3-1: Access to PLMN services via Stand-alone Non-Public Network
NOTE 1: The reference architecture in Figure D.3-1 and Figure D.3-2 only shows
the network functions directly connected to the UPF or N3IWF and other parts
of the architecture are same as defined in clause 4.2.
In order to obtain access to PLMN services when the UE is camping in NG-RAN of
Stand-alone Non-Public Network, the UE obtains IP connectivity, discovers and
establishes connectivity to an N3IWF in the PLMN.
In the Figure D.3-1, the N1 (for NPN) represents the reference point between
UE and the AMF in Stand-alone Non-Public Network. The NWu (for PLMN)
represents the reference point between the UE and the N3IWF in the PLMN for
establishing secure tunnel between UE and the N3IWF over the Stand-alone Non-
Public Network. N1 (for PLMN) represents the reference point between UE and
the AMF in PLMN.
Figure D.3-2: Access to Stand-alone Non-Public Network services via PLMN
In order to obtain access to Non-Public Network services when the UE is
camping in NG-RAN of a PLMN, the UE obtains IP connectivity, discovers and
establishes connectivity to an N3IWF in the Stand-alone Non-Public Network.
In Figure D.3-2, the N1 (for PLMN) represents the reference point between UE
and the AMF in the PLMN. The NWu (for NPN) represents the reference point
between the UE and the N3IWF in the stand-alone Non-Public Network for
establishing a secure tunnel between UE and the N3IWF over the PLMN. The N1
(for NPN) represents the reference point between UE and the AMF in NPN.
When using the mechanism described above to access overlay network via
underlay network, the overlay network can act as authorized 3rd party with AF
to interact with NEF in the underlay network, to use the existing network
exposure capabilities provided by the underlay network defined in clause 4.15
of TS 23.502 [3]. This interaction is subject of agreements between the
overlay and the underlay network.
# D.4 Support for UE capable of simultaneously connecting to an SNPN and a
PLMN
When a UE capable of simultaneously connecting to an SNPN and a PLMN is not
set to operate in SNPN access mode, the UE only performs PLMN selection
procedures as defined in clause 4.4 of TS 23.122 [17] using the Uu interface
for connection to the PLMN.
A UE supporting simultaneous connectivity to an SNPN and a PLMN applies the
network selection as applicable for the access and network for SNPN and PLMN
respectively. Whether the UE uses SNPN or PLMN for its services is
implementation dependent.
A UE supporting simultaneous connectivity to an SNPN and a PLMN applies the
cell (re-)selection as applicable for the access and network for SNPN and PLMN
respectively. Whether the UE uses SNPN or PLMN for its services is
implementation dependent.
# D.5 Support for keeping UE in CM-CONNECTED state in overlay network when
accessing services via NWu
When UE is accessing the overlay network via the underlay network as described
in clause D.3, it is possible to keep the UE in CM-CONNECTED state in the
overlay network:
\- UE maintains at least one PDU Session in underlay network, from where the
N3IWF of the overlay network is reachable via the DN of the PDU Session in
underlay network. In this case, the UE is considered as successfully connected
to the non-3GPP access of the overlay network, thus UE always attempts to
transit to CM-CONNECTED state from CM-IDLE, as described in NOTE 3 in clause
5.5.2.
\- IKEv2 liveness check procedure initiated either by UE or N3IWF as defined
in clause 7.8 and clause 7.9 of TS 24.502 [48] can be utilized to ensure the
signalling connection between UE and N3IWF is still valid when UE stays in CM-
CONNECTED state. Adjusting the time interval of the liveness check to avoid
the deletion of the IKEv2 SA due to inactivity, on both endpoints of the SA.
\- If NAT is used, so as to avoid a timeout of the NAT entries between the UPF
in the underlay network and the N3IWF in the overlay network, NAT-Traversal
mechanisms described in RFC 7296 [60] and NAT-Keepalive described in RFC 3948
[138] are recommended.
\- AMF in overlay network keeps the UE in CM-CONNECTED state unless UE or
N3IWF triggers the release.
\- The NG-RAN node in the underlay network can use the existing information to
decide an appropriate RRC state for the UE (e.g. whether release a UE to RRC-
Inactive).
# D.6 Support for session/service continuity between SNPN and PLMN when using
N3IWF
Depending on the UE\'s radio capability and implementation, the following
existing mechanisms can be used to allow session/service continuity between
SNPN and PLMN:
\- For Single Radio UE which includes single Rx/Tx and dual Rx/single Tx UE,
seamless service continuity is not supported in this release when the UE is
moving between the 3GPP access networks of SNPN and PLMN because of the single
radio limitation. But the PDU session continuity between SNPN and PLMN can be
realized by utilizing the existing handover procedure between non-3GPP access
and 3GPP access as defined in clause 4.9.2 of TS 23.502 [3], where one network
is acting as non-3GPP access of the other network.
\- For Dual Radio (Dual Rx/Dual Tx) UE, the service continuity can be achieved
by utilizing the existing handover procedure between non-3GPP access and 3GPP
access for PDU session on a single access and the existing user plane resource
addition procedure for MA PDU session, where one network is acting as non-3GPP
access of the other network
\- For PDU session on a single access, UE can register to the same 5GC via
both Uu and NWu interfaces from two networks when it is possible, by following
the procedure defined in clause 4.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3] if the registration is
via Uu, or in clause 4.12.2 of TS 23.502 [3] if the registration is via NWu.
The registration via NWu utilizes the user plane which is established in
another 5GC using another network\'s Uu interface. For example, if UE is
moving out of its SNPN 3GPP access coverage and would like to continue its
SNPN service in PLMN, UE can register to its SNPN 5GC via PLMN\'s 3GPP access
network using NWu interface with SNPN\'s 5GC before moving out SNPN NG-RAN
coverage. Upon mobility, the existing handover procedure between non-3GPP
access and 3GPP access defined in clause 4.9.2 of TS 23.502 [3] can be
utilized.
\- For MA PDU session, if supported by UE and network, UE can register to the
same 5GC via Uu and NWu interfaces and establish MA PDU session with ATSSS
support to be anchored in the 5GC as defined in clause 4.22.2.2 of TS 23.502
[3], where one network is acting as non-3GPP access of the other network
(Figure D.6-1 shows the example of UE with MA PDU session anchored in SNPN UPF
when connected to SNPN via Uu and NWu interfaces). Upon mobility, UE can
add/activate the user plane resource to the corresponding access type basing
on the procedures defined in clause 4.22.7 of TS 23.502 [3].

Stand-alone Non-Public Network services via Uu and NWu interfaces
# D.7 Guidance for underlay network to support QoS differentiation for User
Plane IPsec Child SA
## D.7.1 Network initiated QoS
When UE is accessing an overlay network via an underlay network as described
in clause D.3, in order to ensure the underlay network to support the QoS
required by the overlay network User Plane IPsec Child SA, the QoS
differentiation mechanism based on network-initiated QoS modification as
described in clause 5.30.2.7 and clause 5.30.2.8 can be used with the
following considerations:
\- An overlay network service can have specific QoS requirement that needs to
be fulfilled by the underlay network, based on SLA between the two networks.
\- The SLA covers selective services of the overlay network which require QoS
support in underlay network. The rest of the overlay network traffic could be
handled in best efforts basis by underlay network.
\- The SLA between the overlay network and the underlay network includes a
mapping between DSCP values of the User Plane IPsec Child SAs and the QoS
requirement of the overlay network services. The QoS requirement includes the
QoS parameters described in clause 5.7.2 that are necessary (e.g. 5QI, ARP,
etc.) during the network-initiated QoS modification in underlay network. In
order to facilitate the SLA, a guidance for details of the mapping between
DSCP values of the User Plane IPSec Child SAs and QoS requirement of the
overlay network services is described of TS 29.513 [133]. The SLA also
includes the N3IWF IP address of the overlay network.
\- The mapping agreed in SLA is configured at N3IWF of the overlay network and
at the SMF/PCF of the underlay network. If a dedicated DNN/S-NSSAI is used in
the underlay network for providing access to the N3IWF in the overlay network,
the SMF/PCF in the underlay network can be configured to enable packet
detection (based on N3IWF IP address and DSCP value) for PDU sessions
associated with the dedicated DNN/S-NSSAI.
\- When UE establishes a PDU Session in underlay network, the PCF in the
underlay network determines PCC rules based on UE subscription information and
local configuration which takes into account the SLA described above and
installs the PCC rules on the SMF which generates and installs PDR/URR on UPF.
The PCC rules indicate N3IWF IP address and the DSCP values of the User Plane
IPsec Child SAs of the overlay network which require QoS differentiation by
the underlay network. So, the UPF in the underlay network can detect packets
of the User Plane IPsec Child SAs corresponding to the overlay network
services which require QoS support by the underlay network.
\- UE registers and establishes PDU Session in the overlay network via the
User Plane connectivity established in the underlay network. When UE is
accessing a specific service of overlay network, a QoS Flow can be created by
the overlay network, then N3IWF creates dedicated User Plane IPsec Child SA
for each overlay network QoS Flow that requires underlay network QoS support.
\- N3IWF uses the QoS profile and the Session-AMBR it receives from SMF in
overlay network along with the mapping agreed in the SLA to derive a specific
DSCP value for the User Plane IPsec Child SA. N3IWF assigns a specific DSCP
value only to one User Plane IPsec Child SA for a UE at the same time. UE (for
UL) and N3IWF (for DL) will set the DSCP marking in the outer IP header of the
User Plane IPsec Child SA accordingly.
\- The overlay network traffic between UE and N3IWF using the specific DSCP
marking will be detected by the UPF in the underlay network, based on previous
installed PDR/URR. The SMF/PCF in underlay network will be informed when the
overlay network traffic is detected. Then the PCF installs new PCC rules on
the SMF including the QoS parameters for handling of packets corresponding to
the specific User Plane IPsec Child SA based on the N3IWF IP address and the
DSCP value of the User Plane IPsec Child SA, and the SMF generates a QoS
profile that triggers the PDU Session Modification procedure as described in
clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. The QoS parameters are derived from the mapping
agreed in SLA based on the detected DSCP value.
## D.7.2 UE initiated QoS
When UE is accessing an overlay network via an underlay network as described
in clause D.3, if UE-initiated QoS modification in clause 5.30.2.7 and clause
5.30.2.8 is used, the following principles can be considered to enable
consistent QoS for User Plane IPsec Child SAs between the two networks:
\- UE registers and establishes PDU Session in the overlay network via the
User Plane connectivity established in the underlay network. When UE is
accessing a specific service of overlay network, a QoS Flow in overlay network
can be created according to clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. UE receives the QoS
Flow level QoS parameters (e.g. 5QI, GFBR, MFBR, as specified in TS 24.501
[47]) from SMF/PCF in overlay network for the QoS Flow which is created for
the specific overlay network service.
\- N3IWF in overlay network creates dedicated User Plane IPsec Child SA for
each overlay network QoS Flow that requires underlay network QoS support.
\- In order to ensure the traffic of the overlay network service is handled
with the desired QoS in underlay network, UE can request new QoS Flow for the
PDU session in the underlay network, by PDU Session Modification procedure
described in clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.502 [3]. The requested QoS can be derived
from the QoS Flow level QoS parameters which the UE has received from the
overlay network. The Packet Filter in the QoS rule of the request includes
overlay network N3IWF IP address and SPI associated with the User Plane IPsec
Child SA.
\- SMF in the underlay network notifies the PCF that the UE has initiated
resource modification, after receiving the PDU Session Modification Request.
PCF in the underlay network determines if the request can be authorized based
on UE subscription and local policy which can take into account the SLA
between overlay network and underlay network. If the request is authorized,
PCF generates new PCC rule and installs on SMF in order to create new QoS Flow
in underlay network using the QoS Flow level QoS parameters from the overlay
network. The PDR/FAR generated refers to the N3IWF IP address and the SPI
(provided by the UE in Traffic filter in PDU Session Modification request) to
enable filtering and mapping of DL traffic towards the right PDU Session/QoS
Flow within the underlay network.
\- If SLA exists, it can include a mapping between the DSCP values of the User
Plane IPsec Child SAs and the QoS requirement of the overlay network services.
The SLA is configured at N3IWF in overlay network and at SMF/PCF in underlay
network. N3IWF can provide DSCP value to UE for the User Plane IPsec Child SA
at PDU Session Establishment (clause 4.12.5, step 4a and 4c of TS 23.502 [3]).
UE can include the DSCP value as an addition in the Packet Filter by
initiating the PDU Session Modification procedure in the underlay network. PCF
in the underlay network performs QoS authorization of UE QoS request
considering the UE subscription and local configuration which takes into
account the mapping in the SLA. Details of the mapping between DSCP values of
the User Plane IPSec Child SAs and QoS requirement of the overlay network
services is described in TS 29.513 [133].
###### ## Annex E (informative): Communication models for NF/NF services
interaction
# E.1 General
This annex provides a high level description of the different communication
models that NF and NF services can use to interact which each other. Table
E.1-1 summarizes the communication models, their usage and how they relate to
the usage of an SCP.
Table E.1-1: Communication models for NF/NF services interaction summary
Communication between consumer and producer Service discovery and request
routing Communication model
* * *
Direct communication No NRF or SCP; direct routing A Discovery using NRF
services; no SCP; direct routing B Indirect communication Discovery using NRF
services; selection for specific instance from the Set can be delegated to
SCP. Routing via SCP C Discovery and associated selection delegated to an SCP
using discovery and selection parameters in service request; routing via SCP D
**Model A - Direct communication without NRF interaction:** Neither NRF nor
SCP are used. Consumers are configured with producers\' \"NF profiles\" and
directly communicate with a producer of their choice.
**Model B - Direct communication with NRF interaction:** Consumers do
discovery by querying the NRF. Based on the discovery result, the consumer
does the selection. The consumer sends the request to the selected producer.
**Model C - Indirect communication without delegated discovery:** Consumers do
discovery by querying the NRF. Based on discovery result, the consumer does
the selection of an NF Set or a specific NF instance of NF set. The consumer
sends the request to the SCP containing the address of the selected service
producer pointing to a NF service instance or a set of NF service instances.
In the latter case, the SCP selects an NF Service instance. If possible, the
SCP interacts with NRF to get selection parameters such as location, capacity,
etc. The SCP routes the request to the selected NF service producer instance.
**Model D - Indirect communication with delegated discovery:** Consumers do
not do any discovery or selection. The consumer adds any necessary discovery
and selection parameters required to find a suitable producer to the service
request. The SCP uses the request address and the discovery and selection
parameters in the request message to route the request to a suitable producer
instance. The SCP can perform discovery with an NRF and obtain a discovery
result.
Figure E.1-1 depicts the different communication models.

###### ## Annex F (informative): Redundant user plane paths based on multiple
UEs per device
This clause describes an approach to realize multiple user plane paths in the
system based on a device having multiple UEs and specific network deployments.
The approach assumes a RAN deployment where redundant coverage by multiple
gNBs (in the case of NR) is generally available. Upper layer protocols, such
as the IEEE 802.1 TSN (Time Sensitive Networking), can make use of the
multiple user plane paths.
The UEs belonging to the same terminal device request the establishment of PDU
Sessions that use independent RAN and CN network resources using the
mechanisms outlined below.
This deployment option has a number of preconditions:
\- The redundancy framework uses separate gNBs to achieve user plane
redundancy over the 3GPP system. It is however up to operator deployment and
configuration whether separate gNBs are available and used. If separate gNBs
are not available for a device, the redundancy framework may still be applied
to provide user plane redundancy in the rest of the network as well as between
the device and the gNB using multiple UEs.
\- Terminal devices integrate multiple UEs which can connect to different gNBs
independently.
\- RAN coverage is redundant in the target area: it is possible to connect to
multiple gNBs from the same location. To ensure that the two UEs connect to
different gNBs, the gNBs need to operate such that the selection of gNBs can
be distinct from each other (e.g. gNB frequency allocation allows the UE to
connect to multiple gNBs).
\- The core network UPF deployment is aligned with RAN deployment and supports
redundant user plane paths.
\- The underlying transport topology is aligned with the RAN and UPF
deployment and supports redundant user plane paths.
\- The physical network topology and geographical distribution of functions
also supports the redundant user plane paths to the extent deemed necessary by
the operator.
\- The operation of the redundant user plane paths is made sufficiently
independent, to the extent deemed necessary by the operator, e.g. independent
power supplies.
Figure F-1 illustrates the architecture view. UE1 and UE2 are connected to
gNB1 and gNB2, respectively and UE1 sets up a PDU Session via gNB1 to UPF1,
while UE2 sets up a PDU Session via gNB2 to UPF2. UPF1 and UPF2 connect to the
same Data Network (DN), but the traffic via UPF1 and UPF2 might be routed via
different user plane nodes within the DN. UPF1 and UPF2 are controlled by SMF1
and SMF2, respectively.
Figure F-1: Architecture with redundancy based on multiple UEs in the device
The approach comprises the following main components shown as example using NR
in figure F-2.
\- **gNB selection:** The selection of different gNBs for the UEs in the same
device is realized by the concept of UE Reliability Groups for the UEs and
also for the cells of gNBs. By grouping the UEs in the device and cells of
gNBs in the network into more than one reliability group and preferably
selecting cells in the same reliability group as the UE, it is ensured that
UEs in the same device can be assigned different gNBs for redundancy as
illustrated in Figure F-2, where UE1 and the cells of gNB1 belong to
reliability group A, and UE2 and the cells of gNB2 belong to reliability group
B.
Figure F-2: Reliability group-based redundancy concept in RAN
For determining the reliability grouping of a UE, one of the following methods
or a combination of them can be used:
\- It could be configured explicitly to the UE and sent in a Registration
Request message to the network using an existing parameter (such as an S-NSSAI
in the Requested NSSAI where the SST is URLLC; the Reliability Group can be
decided by the SD part).
\- It could also be derived from existing system parameters (e.g. SUPI, PEI,
S-NSSAI, RFSP) based on operator configuration.
The Reliability Group of each UE is represented via existing parameters and
sent from the AMF to the RAN when the RAN context is established, so each gNB
has knowledge about the reliability group of the connected UEs.
NOTE: An example realisation can be as follows: the UE\'s Allowed NSSAI can be
used as input to select the RFSP index value for the UE. The RAN node uses the
RFSP for RRM purposes and can based on local configuration determine the UE\'s
Reliability Group based on the S-NSSAI in Allowed NSSAI and/or S-NSSAI for the
PDU Session(s).
The reliability group of the RAN (cells of gNBs) entities are pre-configured
by the O&M system in RAN. It is possible for gNBs to learn the reliability
group neighbouring cells as the Xn connectivity is set up, or the reliability
group of neighbouring cells are also configured into the gNBs.
In the case of connected mode mobility, the serving gNB prioritizes candidate
target cells that belong to different reliability group than the UE. It
follows that normally the UE is handed over only to cells in the same
reliability group. If cells in the same reliability group are not available
(UE is out of the coverage of cells of its own reliability group or link
quality is below a given threshold) the UE may be handed over to a cell in
another reliability group as well.
If the UE connects to a cell whose reliability group is different from the
UE\'s reliability group, the gNB initiates a handover to a cell in the
appropriate reliability group whenever such a suitable cell is available.
In the case of an Idle UE, it is possible to use the existing cell
(re-)selection priority mechanism, with a priori UE config using dedicated
signalling (in the RRCConnectionRelease message during transition from
connected to idle mode) to configure the UE to reselect the cells of the
appropriate reliability group for camping in deployments where the cell
reliability groups use different sets of frequencies.
\- **UPF selection.** UPF selection mechanisms as described in clause 6.3.3
can be used to select different UPFs for the UEs within the device. The
selection may be based either on UE configuration or network configuration of
different DNNs leading to the same DN, or different slices for the two UEs. It
is possible to use the UE\'s Reliability Group, described above for gNB
selection, as an input to the UPF selection. The proper operator configuration
of the UPF selection can ensure that the path of the PDU Sessions of UE1 and
UE2 are independent.
\- **Control plane.** The approach can optionally apply different control
plane entities for the individual UEs within the device. This may be achieved
by using:
\- different DNNs for the individual UEs within the device to select different
SMFs,
\- or applying different slices for the individual UEs within the device
either based on UE configuration or network subscription, to select different
AMFs and/or SMFs.
###### ## Annex G (informative): SCP Deployment Examples
# G.1 General
This Annex provides deployment examples for the SCP but is not meant to be an
exhaustive list of deployment options for the SCP. The first example G.1 is
based on an SCP implement using (network wide) service mesh technology, while
the second example builds on SCP and 5GC functions as independent deployment
units.
# G.2 An SCP based on service mesh
## G.2.1 Introduction
This clause describes an SCP deployment based on a distributed model in which
SCP endpoints are co-located with 5GC functionality (e.g. an NF, an NF
Service, a subset thereof such as a microservice implementing part of an NF/NF
service or a superset thereof such as a group of NFs, NF Services or
microservices). This example makes no assumptions as to the internal
composition of each 5GC functionality (e.g. whether they are internally
composed of multiple elements or whether such internal elements communicate
with means other than the service mesh depicted in this example).
In this deployment example, Service Agent(s) implementing necessary peripheral
tasks (e.g. an SCP endpoint) are co-located with 5GC functionality, as
depicted in Figure G.2.1-1. In this example, Service Agents and 5GC
functionality, although co-located, are separate components.
Figure G.2.1-1: Deployment unit: 5GC functionality and co-located Service
Agent(s) implementing peripheral tasks
In this deployment example, an SCP Service Agent, i.e. a service communication
proxy, is co-located in the same deployment unit with 5GC functionality and
provides each deployed unit (e.g. a container-based VNFC) with indirect
communication and delegated discovery.
Figure G.2.1-2 shows an overview of this deployment scenario. For SBI-based
interactions with other 5GC functionalities, a consumer (5GC functionality A)
communicates through its Service Agent via SBI. Its Service Agent selects a
target producer based on the request and routes the request to the producer\'s
(5GC functionality B) Service Agent. What routing and selection policies a
Service Agent applies for a given request is determined by routing and
selection policies pushed by the service mesh controller. Information required
by the service mesh controller is pushed by the Service Agents to the service
mesh controller.
In this deployment, the SCP manages registration and discovery for
communication within the service mesh and it interacts with an external NRF
for service exposure and communication across service mesh boundaries.
Operator-defined policies are additionally employed to generate the routing
and selection policies to be used by the Service Agents.
This example depicts only SBI-based communication via a service mesh, but it
does not preclude the simultaneous use of the service mesh for protocols other
than SBI supported by the service mesh or that the depicted 5GC functionality
additionally communicates via other means.
Figure G.2.1-2: SCP Service mesh co-location with 5GC functionality
From a 3GPP perspective, in this deployment example a deployment unit thus
contains NF functionality and SCP functionality. Figure G.2.1-3 depicts the
boundary between both 3GPP entities. In the depicted example, two NF Services
part of the same NF and each exposing an SBI interface are deployed each in a
container-based VNFC. A co-located Service Agent provides each NF Service with
indirect communication and delegated discovery.
Figure G.2.1-3: Detail of the NF-SCP boundary
## G.2.2 Communication across service mesh boundaries
It is a deployment where a single service mesh covers all functionality within
a given deployment or not. In cases of communication across the boundaries of
a service mesh, the service mesh routing the outbound message knows neither
whether the selected producer is in a service mesh nor the internal topology
of the potential service mesh where the producer resides.
In such a deployment, as shown in Figure G.2.2.-1, after producer selection is
performed, routing policies on the outgoing service mesh are only aware of the
next hop.
Given a request sent by A, A\'s Service Agent will perform producer selection
based on the received request. If the selected producer endpoint (e.g. D) is
determined to be outside of Service Mesh 1, A\'s Service Agent routes the
request to the Egress Proxy. For a successful routing, the Egress Proxy needs
to be able to determine the next hop of the request. In this case, this is the
Ingress Proxy of Service Mesh 2. The Ingress Proxy of Service Mesh 2 is, based
on the information in the received request and its routing policies, able to
determine the route for the request. Subsequently, D receives the request. No
topology information needs to be exchanged between Service Mesh 1 and Service
Mesh 2 besides a general routing rule towards Service Mesh 2 (e.g. a FQDN
prefix) and an Ingress Proxy destination for requests targeting endpoints in
Service Mesh 2.
Figure G.2.2-1: Message routing across service mesh boundaries
# G.3 An SCP based on independent deployment units
This clause shows an overview of SCP deployment based on the 5GC functionality
and SCP being deployed in independent deployment units.
Figure G.3-1: Independent deployment units for SCP and 5GC functionality
The SCP deployment unit can internally make use of microservices, however
these microservices are up to vendors implementation and can be for example
SCP agents and SCP controller as used in this example. The SCP agents
implement the http intermediaries between service consumers and service
producers. The SCP agents are controlled by the SCP controller. Communication
between SCP controller and SCP agents is via SCP internal interface (4) and up
to vendors implementation.
In this model it is a deployment choice to co-locate SCP and other 5GC
functions or not. The SCP interfaces (1), (2) and (3) are service based
interfaces. SCP itself is not a service producer itself, however acting as
http proxy it registers services on behave of the producers in NRF. Interface
(2) represents same services as (1) however using SCP proxy addresses.
Interface (3) is interfacing NRF e.g. for service registration on behalf of
the 5GC functions or service discovery.
Figure G.3-2: 5GC functionality and SCP co-location choices
For SBI-based interactions with other 5GC functions, a consumer communicates
through a SCP agent via SBI (1). SCP agent selects a target based on the
request and routes the request to the target SCP agent (2). What routing and
selection policies each SCP agent applies for a given request is determined by
routing and selection policies determined by the SCP controller using for
example information provided via NRF (3) or locally configured in the SCP
controller. The routing and selection information is provided by the SCP
controller to the SCP agents via SCP internal interface (4). Direct
communication can coexist in the same deployment based on 3GPP specified
mechanisms.
Figure G.3-3: Overview of SCP deployment
# G.4 An SCP deployment example based on name-based routing
## G.4.0 General Information
This clause provides a deployment example for the SCP which is based on a
name-based routing mechanism that provides IP over ICN capabilities such as
those described in Xylomenos, George, et al. [G1].
The scenario describes an SCP offering based on an SBA-platform to
interconnect 5GC Services (or a subset of the respective services). The Name-
based Routing mechanism, described in this deployment example, is realized
through a Path Computation Element which is the core part of the SCP. The 5GC
Services are running as microservices on cloud/deployment units (clusters). A
Service Router is the communication node (access node/gateway) between the SCP
and the 5GC Services and resides as a single unit within a Service Deployment
Cluster. The Service Router acts as communication proxy and it is responsible
for mapping IP based messages onto ICN publication and subscriptions. The
Service Router serves multiple 5GC Service Endpoints within that cluster. For
direct communication the Service Router is not used.
5GC Functionalities communicate with the Service Router using standardized
3GPP SBIs.
The Functionalities within the Service Deployment Cluster are containerized
Service Functions.
Depicted in Figure G.4-1, the Service Router act as SCP termination point and
offer the SBI to the respective 5GC Service Functionalities. In this example,
Service Routers and 5GC functionality, although co-located, are separate
components within the Service Deployment Cluster. Multiple Functionalities can
exist within the Service Deployment Cluster, all served by the respective
Service Router when needed to communicate to other Service Functionalities
within different clusters.
Figure G.4-1: Deployment unit: 5GC functionality and co-located Service
Agent(s) implementing peripheral tasks
In Figure G.4-1, the two depicted 5GC Service Functionalities (realized as
Network Function Service Instances) may communicate in two ways. However,
before the communication can be established between two 5GC Functionalities,
Service Registration and Service Discovery need to take place, as described in
Figure G.4.1-1. Service Registration and Service Discovery are provided in a
standardized manner using 3GPP Service Based Interfaces.
## G.4.1 Service Registration and Service Discovery
Service registration can be done in several ways. One option is that ready 5GC
Service Functions may register themselves with their service profile via the
Nnrf interface. The registration request is forwarded to the internal Registry
as well as forwarded to the operator\'s NRF. The internal registration is used
to store the address to identifier relationship and the Service Deployment
Cluster location. The external registration (NRF) is used to expose the
Service Functionality to Services outside the depicted SCP.
Service discovery entails Function A requesting a resolvable identifier for
Functionality B. This resolve request is received by the Service Router which
performs the task with the help of the SCP. After the resolve is done, the 5GC
Functionalities may communicate either directly without any further
interaction through the SCP, when the targeted address is resolved within the
same Service Deployment Cluster; or via the Service Router when the
Functionality resides outside of the originator\'s Service Deployment Cluster.
The Service Router then acts as gateway towards the underlying SCP platform.
Figure G.4.1-1: Registering 5GC Functionalities in the SCP
## G.4.2 Overview of Deployment Scenario
Figure G.4.2-1 shows an overview of this deployment scenario. For SBI-based
interactions with other 5GC functionalities, a consumer entity (e.g. 5GC
functionality B in the cluster on the left side) communicates through the
cluster\'s Service Router with other entities in other clusters (e.g. 5GC
Functionality D in the cluster on the right side). The target selection is
performed through the platform\'s Discovery Service. From the client\'s
perspective, the Service Router is the first and only contact point to the
SCP. The platform resolves the requested Service identifier and aligns the
results with the platform\'s policies. The Path Computation Element calculates
a path between the consumer and the producer (e.g. the shortest path between
the nodes).

###### ## Annex H (normative): PTP usage guidelines
# H.1 General
This Annex provides guidelines on the use of certain specific IEEE parameters
and protocol messages in the case of TSN as described in clause 5.27.
# H.2 Signalling of ingress time for time synchronization
The ingress timestamp (TSi) of the PTP event (e.g. Sync) message is provided
from the ingress TT (NW-TT/UPF or DS-TT/UE) to the egress TT, if supported in
the PTP messages as described in clauses 5.27.1.2.2.1 and 5.27.1.2.2.2 using
the Suffix field defined in clause 13.4 of IEEE Std 1588 [126]. The structure
of the Suffix field follows the recommendation of clause 14.3 of IEEE Std 1588
[126], with an organizationId specific to 3GPP, an organizationSubType
referring to an ingress timestamp, and data field that carries the ingress
timestamp encoded as specified in clause 5.3.3 of IEEE Std 1588 [126]. TS
24.535 [117] specifies the coding of the ingress timestamp in the (g)PTP
messages between a DS-TT and a NW-TT.
# H.3 Void
# H.4 Path and Link delay measurements
The procedure described in this clause is applicable if DS-TT and NW-TT
support operating as a boundary clock or as a time-aware system or as peer to
peer Transparent Clock or end to end Transparent Clock, and when the PTP
instance in 5GS is configured to operate as a time-aware system or as a
Boundary Clock or as peer to peer Transparent Clock or as end to end
Transparent Clock. Whether DS-TT/NW-TT support operating as a boundary clock
or peer to peer Transparent Clock or end to end Transparent Clock or as a
time-aware system (support of the IEEE Std 802.1AS [104] PTP profile) may be
determined as described in clause K.2.1.
PTP ports in DS-TT and NW-TT may support the following delay measurement
mechanisms:
\- Delay request-response mechanism as described in clause 11.3 of IEEE Std
1588 [126];
\- Peer-to-peer delay mechanism as defined in clause 11.4 of IEEE Std 1588
[126];
\- Common Mean Link Delay Service.
Depending on the measurement mechanisms supported by DS-TT and NW-TT as well
as the configured clock mode of 5GS, the PTP ports in DS-TT and NW-TT are
configured as follows:
\- PTP ports configured to operate as a time-aware system according to IEEE
Std 802.1AS [104] may be configured to use the peer-to-peer delay mechanism or
Common Mean Link Delay Service;
\- PTP ports configured to operate as a Boundary Clock according to IEEE Std
1588 [126] may be configured to use the delay request-response mechanism, the
peer-to-peer delay mechanism or Common Mean Link Delay Service.
\- PTP ports in 5GS configured to operate as a peer-to-peer Transparent Clock
according to IEEE Std 1588 [126] shall use the peer-to-peer delay mechanism.
\- PTP ports in 5GS configured to operate as an end-to-end Transparent Clock
according to IEEE Std 1588 [126] do not actively participate in path and link
measurements mechanisms but shall calculate and add residence time and delay
asymmetry information to PTP messages as defined in clause 10.2.2 of IEEE Std
1588 [126].
If DS-TT and NW-TT support operating as an end-to-end Transparent Clock, then
the residence time for one-step operation as an end-to-end Transparent Clock
for the path and link measurements is calculated as follows:
\- Upon reception of a PTP Delay_Req/Pdelay_Req/Pdely_Resp message from the
upstream PTP instance, the ingress TT (i.e. NW-TT or DS-TT) makes an ingress
timestamping (TSi) for the message.
\- The ingress timestamp is conveyed to the egress TT via the PDU Session as
described in clause H.2.
\- The PTP port in the egress TT then creates egress timestamping (TSe) for
the PTP message for external PTP network. The difference between TSi and TSe
is considered as the calculated residence time spent within the 5G system for
this PTP message expressed in 5GS time. If needed, the PTP port in the egress
TT convert the calculated resident time in 5GS into the residence time
expressed in PTP GM time e.g. by means of the factor as specified in Equation
(6) of clause 12.2.2 of IEEE Std 1588 [126].
\- The PTP port in the egress TT modifies the payload of the PTP
Delay_Req/Pdelay_Req/Pdelay_Resp message that it sends towards the downstream
PTP instance as follows:
\- Adds the calculated residence time to the correction field.
\- Removes Suffix field that contains TSi.
If DS-TT and NW-TT support operating as an end-to-end Transparent Clock, then
the residence time for two-step operation as an end-to-end Transparent Clock
for the path and link measurements is calculated as follows:
\- Upon reception of a PTP Delay_Req/Pdelay_Req/Pdelay_Resp message from the
upstream PTP instance, the ingress TT (i.e. NW-TT or DS-TT) makes an ingress
timestamping (TSi) for the message.
\- If the ingress TT receives a Pdelay_Resp message with the twoStepFlag set
to FALSE, then the ingress TT modifies the twoStepFlag to TRUE and creates a
PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message.
\- The ingress timestamp is conveyed to the egress TT via the PDU Session as
described in clause H.2.
\- The PTP port in the egress TT then creates egress timestamping (TSe) for
the PTP message for external PTP network. The difference between TSi and TSe
is considered as the calculated residence time spent within the 5G system for
this PTP message expressed in 5GS time. If needed, the PTP port in the egress
TT converts the calculated residence time in 5GS into the residence time
expressed in PTP GM time, e.g. by means of the factor as specified in Equation
(6) of clause 12.2.2 of IEEE Std 1588 [126]. The egress TT then stores the
calculated residence time expressed in PTP GM time and removes Suffix field
that contains TSi before sending the PTP Delay_Req/Pdelay_Req/Pdelay_Resp
message towards the downstream PTP instance.
\- Upon reception of the PTP Delay_Resp message associated with the PTP
Delay_Req, the egress TT for the PTP Delay_Req message (i.e. the ingress TT
for the PTP Delay_Resp message) modifies the payload of the PTP Delay_Resp
message that it sends towards the ingress TT of the PTP Delay_Req message
(i.e. egress TT for the PTP Delay_Resp message) as follows:
\- Adds the (previously stored) calculated residence time to the correction
field.
\- Upon reception (or local creation) of the PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message
associated with the previously received PTP Pdelay_Resp message, the ingress
TT for the PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message modifies the payload of the PTP
Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message that it sends towards the egress TT for the PTP
Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message as follows:
\- Adds the (previously stored) calculated residence time of the associated
PTP Pdelay_Req message to the correction field.
\- Upon reception of the PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message associated with the
PTP Pdelay_Resp, the egress TT for PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message modifies
the payload of the PTP Pdelay_Resp_Follow_Up message that it sends towards the
downstream PTP instance as follows:
\- Adds the (previously stored) calculated residence time of the associated
PTP Pdelay_Resp messages to the correction field.
###### ## Annex I (normative): TSN usage guidelines
# I.1 Determination of traffic pattern information
As described in clause 5.27.2, the calculation of the TSCAI relies upon
mapping of information for the TSN stream(s) based upon certain IEEE standard
information.
Additional traffic pattern parameters such as maximum burst size and maximum
flow bitrate can be mapped to MDBV and GFBR.
The traffic pattern parameter determination based on PSFP (IEEE Std 802.1Q
[98]), when available, is as follows:
\- Periodicity of a TSN stream is set equal to PSFPAdminCycleTime if there is
only one PSFPGateControlEntry with a PSFPgateStatesValue set to Open in the
PSFPAdminControlList. If there is more than one PSFPGateControlEntry with a
PSFPgateStatesValue set to Open in the PSFPAdminControlList, then the
Periodicity of the TSN Stream is set equal to sum of the timeIntervalValues
from the first gate open instance to a next gate open instance in the
PSFPAdminControlList. For aggregated TSN streams with same periodicity and
compatible Burst Arrival Times, the periodicity of the aggregated flow of
these TSN Streams is set equal to PSFPAdminCycleTime received from CNC for one
of the TSN streams that are aggregated.
NOTE 1: Given that only TSN streams that have the same periodicity and
compatible Burst Arrival Time can be aggregated, the PSFPAdminCycleTime for
those TSN streams is assumed to be the same.
\- Burst Arrival time of a TSN stream at the ingress port is determined based
on the following conditions:
\- The Burst Arrival Time of a TSN Stream should be set to PSFPAdminBaseTime
plus the sum of the timeIntervalValues for which the PSFPgateStatesValue is
Closed in the PSFP AdminControlList until the first gate open time (i.e. until
PSFPgateStatesValue set to Open is found). If the PSFPgateStatesValue is Open
for the first timeIntervalValue, then the Burst Arrival time is set to
PSFPAdminBaseTime. For aggregated TSN streams, the arrival time is calculated
similarly, but using the time interval to the first PSFPgateStatesValue that
is Open from the aggregated TSN streams.
\- Burst Size of a TSN stream at the ingress port (which is useful to map to
MDBV) is determined based on the following conditions:
\- The Burst Size may be determined from TSN Stream gate control operations in
the PSFPAdminControlList. If in the PSFPAdminControlList, IntervalOctetMax is
provided for a PSFPGateControlEntry with an \"open\" PSFPgateStatesValue, the
Burst Size is set to the IntervalOctetMax for that control list entry. If
IntervalOctetMax is not provided, the Burst Size is set to the
timeIntervalValue (converted from ns to s) of the PSFPGateControlEntry with an
\"open\" PSFPgateStatesValue multiplied by the port bitrate.
\- When multiple compatible TSN Streams are aggregated, the Burst Size is set
to the sum of the Burst Sizes for each TSN stream as determined above.
\- Maximum Flow Bitrate of a TSN stream (which is useful to map to GBR) is
determined as follows:
\- The Maximum Flow Bitrate of a TSN Stream is equal to the summation of all
timeIntervalValue (converted from ns to s) with PSFPgateStatesValue = Open,
multiplied by the bitrate of the corresponding port, and divided by
PSFPAdminCycleTime. For aggregated TSN streams, the same calculation is
performed over the burst of aggregated streams (calculated using
superposition, i.e. timeIntervalValue with PSFPgateStatesValue = Open of every
stream is summed up, as they are assumed to have same periodicity, compatible
Burst arrival time, and same traffic class if they are to be aggregated.
When CNC configures the PSFP information to the TSN AF, the TSN AF may use
local information (e.g. local configuration) to map the PSFP information to an
ingress port and/or egress port of the 5GS bridge.
NOTE 2: As an example, for the local configuration, the PSFP can use either
the destination MAC address and VLAN identifier, or the source MAC address and
VLAN identifier for stream identification. The TSN AF is pre-configured with
either the MAC address of Ethernet hosts behind a given DS-TT port (identified
by the DS-TT port MAC address), or the VLAN identifier used over a given DS-TT
port, or both. When the TSN AF determines that one of the known Ethernet
host\'s MAC address appears as a source or destination MAC address, it can
identify that the ingress or egress port is the associated DS-TT port.
###### ## Annex J (informative): Link MTU considerations
According to clause 5.6.10.4 networks can provide link MTU size for UEs. A
purpose of the link MTU size provisioning is to limit the size of the packets
sent by the UE to avoid packet fragmentation in the backbone network between
the UE and the UPF acting as PSA (and/or across the N6 reference point).
Fragmentation within the backbone network creates a significant overhead.
Therefore operators might desire to avoid it. This Annex presents an overhead
calculation that can be used by operators to set the link MTU size provided by
the network. A UE might not employ the provided link MTU size, e.g. when the
MT and TE are separated, as discussed in clause 5.6.10.4. Therefore, providing
an MTU size does not guarantee that there will be no packets larger than the
provided value. However, if UEs follow the provided link MTU value operators
will benefit from reduced transmission overhead within backbone networks.
One of the worst-case scenarios is when GTP packets, e.g. between a NG-RAN
node and the 5GC, are transferred over IPSec tunnel in an IPv6 deployment. In
that case the user packet first encapsulated in a GTP tunnel which results in
the following overhead:
\- IPv6 header, which is 40 octets;
\- UDP overhead, which is 8 octets;
\- Extended GTP-U header, which is 16 octets.
NOTE 1: The sending of a Reflective QoS Indicator within a GTP-U header
extension, or the use of Long PDCP PDU numbers at handover will further
increase the GTP-U header size (see TS 29.281 [75] and TS 38.415 [116]).
In this scenario the GTP packet then further encapsulated into an IPSec
tunnel. The actual IPSec tunnel overhead depends on the used encryption and
integrity protection algorithms. TS 33.210 [115] mandates the support of AES-
GMAC with a key length of 128 bits and the use of HMAC_SHA-1 for integrity
protection. Therefore, the overhead with those algorithms is calculated as:
\- IPv6 header, which is 40 octets;
\- IPSec Security Parameter Index and Sequence Number overhead, which is 4+4
octets;
\- Initialization Vector for the encryption algorithm, which is 16 octets;
\- Padding to make the size of the encrypted payload a multiple of 16;
\- Padding Length and Next Header octets (2 octets);
\- Integrity Check Value, which is 12 octets.
In order to make the user packet size as large as possible a padding of 0
octet is assumed. With this zero padding assumption the total overhead is 142
octets, which results a maximum user packet size of transport MTU minus 142
octets. Note that in the case of transport MTU=1500, this user packet size
will result in a 1424 octets payload length to be ciphered, which is a
multiple of 16, thus the assumption that no padding is needed is correct (see
Figure J.1). Similar calculations can be done for networks with transport that
supports larger MTU sizes.
Figure J-1: Overhead calculation for transport MTU=1500 octet
The link MTU value that can prevent fragmentation in the backbone network
between the UE and the UPF acting as PSA depends on the actual deployment.
Based on the above calculation a link MTU value of 1358 is small enough in
most of the network deployments. However for network deployments where the
transport uniformly supports for example ethernet jumbo frames, transport

# K.2 Port and user plane node management information exchange for time
synchronization
## K.2.1 Capability exchange
DS-TT and NW-TT indicate time synchronization information they support inside
the Port management capabilities (see Table K.1-1).
TSN AF and TSCTSF may determine the PTP functionalities supported by DS-TT and
NW-TT by retrieving the following port management information or user plane
node management information, respectively:
\- Supported PTP instance types;
\- Supported transport types;
\- Supported PTP delay mechanisms;
\- Grandmaster capability;
\- Supported PTP profiles;
\- Number of supported PTP instances.
NOTE: If NW-TT or DS-TT do not indicate support for any of the PTP profiles
and PTP instance types, then TSN AF or TSCTSF assume that the NW-TT or DS-TT
only support acting as a PTP Relay instance with the gPTP GM connected on N6.
If DS-TT and NW-TT support the PTP Relay instance type as defined by IEEE
802.1AS [104] then DS-TT and NW-TT shall include the IEEE 802.1AS [104] PTP
profile in the \"Supported PTP profiles\" in PMIC and UMIC, respectively.
The TSN AF or TSCTSF may retrieve the \"Number of supported PTP instances\"
from NW-TT via UMIC and from DS-TT via PMIC.
## K.2.2 PTP Instance configuration
### K.2.2.1 General
Based on input received from external applications (CNC in case of TSN AF or
any AF in case of TSCTSF), TSN AF or TSCTSF may configure PTP instances
(identified by PTP Instance ID) in a DS-TT or NW-TT by sending port management
information (PMIC, see Table K.1-1) and user plane node management information
(UMIC, see Table K.1-2) to DS-TT or NW-TT as described below:
\- use PMIC \"PTP instance specification\" for configuring DS-TT(s) for PTP
instance data sets common for all PTP ports (i.e. defaultDS and
TimePropertiesDS), and PTP instance data sets specific for each PTP port (i.e.
portDS data set);
\- use UMIC \"PTP instance specification\" for configuring NW-TT for PTP
instance data sets common for all PTP ports;
\- use PMIC \"PTP instance specification\" for configuring NW-TT for PTP
instance data sets specific for each PTP port;
\- use UMIC \"Time synchronization information for DS-TT ports\" for
configuring NW-TT for PTP instance data sets specific for each PTP port for
the PTP ports in DS-TT(s).
TSN AF or TSCTSF may also configure PTP instances for DS-TT ports in NW-TT by
sending UMIC (see Table K.1-2) to NW-TT to enable NW-TT to operate as a
grandmaster on behalf of DS-TT (see clause K.2.2.4 for more details).
For each PTP instance the TSN AF or TSCTSF may provide individual PTP
configuration parameters or may provide a PTP profile ID to DS-TT or NW-TT.
The DS-TT and NW-TT use the default values as defined in the corresponding PTP
Profile, if individual PTP configuration parameters that are covered by the
PTP profile are not provided.
NOTE 1: Even if PTP profiles are used to configure DS-TT or NW-TT, individual
PTP parameters can still be configured in addition, e.g. domain numbers,
transport to use, etc.
To configure DS-TT and NW-TT to operate as a PTP relay instance, TSN AF or
TSCTSF shall set the PTP profile (see Table K.1-1) to IEEE Std 802.1AS [104].
DS-TT may operate as a PTP relay instance with the gPTP GM connected on N6
until the first PTP instance is configured in the DS-TT by TSN AF or TSCTSF.
To initialize a PTP instance in 5GS, TSN AF or TSCTSF creates a new PTP
instance in NW-TT by assigning a new PTP Instance ID and indicating it to the
NW-TT in \"PTP instance specification\" in UMIC and PMIC(s) for each NW-TT
port that is part of the PTP instance. TSN AF or TSCTSF then retrieves the
\"defaultDS.clockIdentity\" of the PTP instance in NW-TT via UMIC. NW-TT
ensures that the clockIdentity in defaultDS in UMIC matches with the
clockIdentity in the portDS.portIdentity in PMIC(s) for a particular PTP
Instance ID.
To add a DS-TT port into an existent PTP instance in 5GS, the TSN AF or TSCTSF
indicates the PTP Instance ID (to which the DS-TT port is being added) to the
DS-TT in \"PTP instance specification\" in PMIC, and indicating the PTP
Instance ID to the NW-TT in \"Time synchronization information for DS-TT
ports\" in UMIC for the corresponding DS-TT port.
For a particular PTP instance in NW-TT, the same PTP Instance ID shall be used
in \"PTP instance specification\" in PMIC, in \"PTP instance specification\"
in UMIC, and in \"Time synchronization information for DS-TT ports\" in UMIC.
NOTE 2: The TSN AF or TSCTSF creates a PTP Instance in the NW-TT or DS-TT by
using the \"Set parameter\" operation code as described in TS 24.539 [139].
The NW-TT or DS-TT determines that this \"Set parameter\" operation creates a
new PTP Instance based on the PTP Instance ID that does not correspond to any
of the configured PTP Instances in the \"PTP instance specification\" and
\"Time synchronization information for DS-TT ports\" (for NW-TT) or in the
\"PTP instance specification\" (for DS-TT).
The TSN AF or TSCTSF then initializes the PTP instance in the DS-TT by setting
the applicable PTP instance data sets common for all PTP ports (i.e. defaultDS
and TimePropertiesDS), (including\"defaultDS.clockIdentity\") via \"PTP
instance specification\" in PMIC to the same value as retrieved from the NW-TT
via \"PTP instance specification\" in UMIC. The TSN AF or TSCTSF also enables
the PTP instance by setting the defaultDS.instanceEnable = TRUE to DS-TT via
PMIC and to NW-TT via UMIC (if applicable). The TSN AF or TSCTSF can
initialize any number of PTP instances:
a) among the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT that are part of the same set of PTP instances
in 5GS; up to the maximum number of supported PTP instances by the NW-TT or
DS-TT that supports the lowest number of supported PTP instances; and
b) in the NW-TT; up to the maximum number of supported PTP instances by the
NW-TT.
NOTE 3: How the TSN AF or TSCTSF assign NW-TT port(s) of one NW-TT to
different PTP instances is up to implementation.
To remove a DS-TT port from a PTP instance in 5GS, the TSN AF or TSCTSF
deletes the PTP instance in DS-TT using PMIC and in NW-TT using UMIC as
specified in TS 24.539 [139]. To remove a NW-TT port from a PTP instance in
5GS, the TSN AF or TSCTSF deletes the PTP instance in NW-TT using PMIC as
specified in TS 24.539 [139]. If a PTP instance in 5GS is no more needed the
TSN AF or TSCTSF may delete the PTP instance in NW-TT using UMIC as specified
in TS 24.539 [139].
### K.2.2.2 Configuration for Sync and Announce reception timeouts
The NW-TT shall be able to determine the timeout of the reception of (g)PTP
Announce (when the 5GS operates as a time-aware system or Boundary Clock) and
gPTP Sync messages (when the 5GS operates as time-aware system). To enable
this, the TSCTSF or TSN AF shall configure the NW-TT for the following
information via PMIC for each PTP port in NW-TT and \"Time synchronization
information for each DS-TT port\" element in UMIC for each PTP port in DS-TT:
portDS.announceReceiptTimeout (for time-aware system and Boundary Clock);
portDS.syncReceiptTimeout (for time-aware system);
portDS.logAnnounceInterval (for Boundary Clock).
portDS.initialLogAnnounceInterval, portDS.useMgtSettableLogAnnounceInterval
and portDS.mgtSettableLogAnnounceInterval (for time-aware system).
### K.2.2.3 Configuration for PTP port states
The PTP port states may be determined by NW-TT either via:
\- Method a), BMCA procedure.
\- Method b), local configuration.
When Method b) is used, the TSN AF or TSCTSF sets the
defaultDS.externalPortConfigurationEnabled (per PTP instance) in UMIC to TRUE,
and sets the value of externalPortConfigurationPortDS.desiredState (per PTP
port) in UMIC for each DS-TT port and in PMIC for each NW-TT port for the
(g)PTP domain.
### K.2.2.4 Configuration for PTP grandmaster function
The following options may be supported (per DS-TT) for the 5GS to generate the
Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages for the Leader ports on the DS-TT:
a) NW-TT generates the Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages on behalf of DS-
TT (e.g. if DS-TT does not support this).
b) DS-TT generates the Sync, Follow_Up and Announce messages in this DS-TT.
TSN AF and TSCTSF may use the elements in port and user plane node management
information container to determine the PTP grandmaster functionality supported
by DS-TT and NW-TT and may configure the DS-TT and NW-TT ports to operate as
in option a) or b) as follows:
\- The \"PTP grandmaster capable\" element and the \"gPTP grandmaster
capable\" element in PMIC are used to indicate the support for PTP or gPTP
grandmaster capability, respectively, in each DS-TT. If the TSN AF or TSCTSF
determines the DS-TT supports grandmaster capability (PTP or gPTP grandmaster
capable is TRUE), then either option a) or b) can be used for the PTP
instance(s) in the DS-TT. Otherwise, only option a) can be used for the PTP
instance(s) in the DS-TT.
\- To enable option a) for PTP ports in DS-TT, the TSN AF or TSCTSF sets the
element \"Grandmaster on behalf of DS-TT enabled\" TRUE (per PTP instance per
DS-TT) in UMIC for the respective DS-TT port, and the TSN AF or TSCTSF sets
the element \"Grandmaster enabled\" FALSE (per PTP instance per DS-TT) in PMIC
to the respective DS-TT port.
\- To enable option b) for PTP ports in DS-TT, the TSN AF or TSCTSF sets the
element \"Grandmaster on behalf of DS-TT enabled\" FALSE in UMIC (per PTP
instance per DS-TT) for the respective port, and the TSN AF or TSCTSF sets the
element \"Grandmaster enabled\" TRUE (per PTP instance per DS-TT) in PMIC to
the respective DS-TT port.
\- To enable either option a) or option b) for a PTP instance, the TSN AF or
TSCTSF sets the element \"Grandmaster candidate enabled\" TRUE (per PTP
instance) in UMIC.
\- When option b) is used for one or more PTP ports in DS-TT(s), the TSN AF or
TSCTSF shall use the elements in defaultDS in PMIC for the respective DS-TT(s)
and in UMIC for NW-TT to ensure that all PTP ports in the DS-TT(s) and NW-TT
in particular PTP instance are distributing the same values of
grandmasterPriority1, grandmasterClockQuality, grandmasterPriority2,
grandmasterIdentity, and timeSource message fields in Announce messages.
### K.2.2.5 Configuration for Sync and Announce intervals
The TSN AF or TSCTSF uses the values in portDS.logSyncInterval (for Boundary
Clock) or portDS.initialLogSyncInterval, portDS.useMgtSettableLogSyncInterval
and portDS.mgtSettableLogSyncInterval (for time-aware system) to configure the
interval for the Sync messages (per PTP port) as described in IEEE Std 1588
[126] or IEEE Std 802.1AS [104], respectively. The TSCTSF or TSN AF configures
those values as follows:
\- TSCTSF or TSN AF use PMIC to configure the values for the PTP ports in NW-
TT.
\- TSCTSF or TSN AF use the \"Time synchronization information for each DS-TT
port\" element in UMIC to configure the values for PTP ports in DS-TT(s) if
NW-TT acts as GM on behalf of those DS-TTs.
\- TSCTSF or TSN AF use PMIC to configure the values for the PTP ports in DS-
TT if the DS-TT is capable of acting as a GM.
When the NW-TT generates the (g)PTP Sync messages on behalf of the DS-TT, the
NW-TT uses the values in the element \"Time synchronization information for
each DS-TT port\" in UMIC to determine the Sync interval for the PTP ports the
respective DS-TT. When DS-TT generates the (g)PTP Sync messages, the DS-TT
uses the values in PMIC to determine the Sync interval for the PTP ports in
this DS-TT.
The TSN AF or TSCTSF uses the values in portDS.logAnnounceInterval (for
Boundary Clock) or portDS.initialLogAnnounceInterval,
portDS.useMgtSettableLogAnnounceInterval and
portDS.mgtSettableLogAnnounceInterval (for time-aware system) to configure the
interval for the Announce messages (per PTP port) as described in IEEE Std
1588 [126] and IEEE Std 802.1AS [104], respectively. The TSCTSF or TSN AF
configures those values as follows:
\- TSCTSF or TSN AF use PMIC to configure the values for the PTP ports in NW-
TT.
\- TSCTSF or TSN AF use the \"Time synchronization information for each DS-TT
port\" element in UMIC to configure the values for PTP ports in DS-TT(s) if
NW-TT acts as GM on behalf of those DS-TTs.
\- TSCTSF or TSN AF use PMIC to configure the values for the PTP ports in DS-
TT if the DS-TT is capable of acting as a GM.
When the NW-TT generates the (g)PTP Announce messages on behalf of the DS-TT,
the NW-TT uses the values in the element \"Time synchronization information
for each DS-TT port\" in UMIC to determine the Announce interval for the PTP
ports the respective DS-TT. When DS-TT generates the (g)PTP Announce messages,
the DS-TT uses the values in PMIC to determine the Announce interval for the
PTP ports in this DS-TT.
### K.2.2.6 Configuration for transport protocols
The procedure described in this clause is applicable when the PTP Profile that
is used for the PTP instance in 5GS defines multiple permitted transport
protocols.
TSN AF or TSCTSF may use the element \"Supported transport types\" in port
management information container (per DS-TT) to determine the supported
transport types in the DS-TT. TSN AF or TSCTSF may use the element \"Supported
transport types\" in UMIC (per NW-TT) to determine the supported transport
types in the NW-TT.
The TSN AF or TSCTSF may use the element \"Transport type\" (per PTP instance)
in PMIC to configure the transport protocol in use for the PTP instance in DS-
TT. The TSN AF or TSCTSF may use the element \"Transport type\" (per PTP
instance) in UMIC to configure the transport protocol in use for the PTP
instance in NW-TT.
The PTP instance shall be configured to use one of the following transport
protocols:
1) Ethernet as described in Annex E of IEEE Std 1588 [126]. The Ethertype as
defined for PTP shall be used. The related Ethernet frames carry the PTP
multicast Ethernet destination MAC address.
2) UDP over IPv4 as described in Annex C of IEEE Std 1588 [126],
3) UDP over IPv6 as described in Annex D of IEEE Std 1588 [126].
Option 1 applies to Ethernet PDU Session type. Options 2 and 3 apply to IP PDU
Session type or Ethernet PDU Session type with IP payload.
###### ## Annex L (normative): Support of GERAN/UTRAN access
This annex applies when the SMF+PGW-C is enhanced to support UE accessing the
network via GERAN/UTRAN over Gn/Gp interface. For this scenario, the SMF+PGW-C
uses N7 interface to interact with PCF and the N40 interface to interact with
CHF.
NOTE 1: For the interface with the serving node of the UE, the SMF+PGW-C is
assumed to behave as the Control Plane of the PGW described in Annex D of TS
23.401 [26].
SMF+PGW-C selection by SGSN is specified in Annex G of TS 23.502 [2].
The SMF+PGW-C interacting with PCF for GERAN/UTRAN access is specified in
Annex G of TS 23.502 [2].
The functional description for SMF+PGW-C interacting with PCF to support
GERAN/UTRAN access is specified in TS 23.503 [3].
NOTE 2: Support for IP address preservation upon mobility between 5GS and
GERAN/UTRAN for PDN sessions established in EPC is described in clause
5.17.2.4. IP address preservation is not supported for direct mobility between
5GS and GERAN/UTRAN, nor for indirect mobility cases when the PDN session is
established in 5GS or in GERAN/UTRAN.
The charging services on SMF+PGW-C interactions with CHF for GERAN/UTRAN
access are specified in TS 32.255 [68].
