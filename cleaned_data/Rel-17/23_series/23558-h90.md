# 4 Overview
## 4.1 General
For edge computing, it is essential that the ACs are able to locate and
connect with the most suitable application server available in the EDN,
depending on the needs of the application. The edge enabler layer exposes APIs
to support such capabilities.
The edge computing capabilities supported by 3GPP are illustrated in the
figure 4.1-1.
Figure 4.1-1: Overview of 3GPP edge computing
The application layer is a consumer of 3GPP specified edge computing
capabilities. The 3GPP edge computing capabilities are typically organized as
follows:
\- Edge enabler layer, specified in this specification;
\- Edge hosting environment, details of which are outside the scope of 3GPP;
\- 3GPP transport layer, specified in 3GPP TS 23.401 [11] and 3GPP TS 23.501
[2]; and
\- Edge management layer, specified in 3GPP TS 28.538 [22].
Following clauses provide an overview of the features of edge enabler layer.
## 4.2 Service provisioning
Service provisioning procedures supply the information required by the UE to
access the edge services. The procedure takes UE\'s location, service
requirements, service preferences and connectivity information into account to
provide the required configuration. Service provisioning procedures are
specified in clause 8.3.
## 4.3 Registration
Registration procedures specified in clause 8.4, allow entities (e.g. UE and
Application Server) in the edge enabler layer to provide information about
itself to other entities of the edge enabler layer.
## 4.4 EAS discovery
EAS discovery procedures enable the UE to obtain information about suitable
EASs of interest (specified as discovery filters) in the EDN. EAS discovery
procedures are specified in clause 8.5.
## 4.5 Capability exposure to EAS
The edge enabler layer exposes services towards the EASs. The exposed
capabilities include the services of the Edge Enabler Layer and the re-exposed
and enhanced services of the 3GPP core network. The capabilities exposed by
the edge enabler layer are specified in clause 8.6 and the 3GPP network
capability exposure is specified in clause 8.7. Other application layer
capabilities like application enabler services and SEAL services may be
exposed via edge enabler layer as per CAPIF as illustrated in Annex A.4.
## 4.6 Support for service continuity
When a UE moves to a new location, different EASs can be more suitable for
serving the UE. Such transitions can result from a non-mobility event also,
requiring support from the edge enabler layer to maintain the continuity of
the service. Support for service continuity provides several features for
minimizing the application layer service interruption by replacing the S-EAS
connected to the AC in the UE, with a T-EAS. Support for service continuity is
further specified in clause 8.8.
## 4.7 Security
The edge enabler layer supports secure communication amongst the enabler layer
entities. Clause 8.11 provides details on EEC authentication and
authorization.
## 4.8 Dynamic EAS instantiation triggering
The Edge Enabler Layer can interact with the ECSP management system to trigger
instantiation of a suitable EAS as per application needs. Details of the EAS
instantiation triggering are specified in clause 8.12.
## 4.9 Charging
The general architecture and principles applicable for charging of Edge
enabling services provided by an ECSP to an ASP, is specified in 3GPP TS
32.240 [24].

functional architecture;
\- Clause 6.3 describes the functional entities;
\- Clause 6.4 describes the service-based interfaces;
\- Clause 6.5 describes the reference points;

## 6.2 Architecture
This clause describes the architecture for enabling edge applications in the
following representations:
\- A service-based representation, where the Edge Enabler Layer functions
(e.g. ECS) enable other authorized Edge Enabler Layer functions (e.g. EES) to
access their services. This representation also includes point-to-point
reference points where necessary;
\- A service-based representation as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], where
the Network Functions (e.g. NEF) enable authorized Edge Enabler Layer
functions (e.g. ECS) i.e. Application Functions, to access their services;
\- A service-based representation, where the Core Network Northbound APIs as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], are utilized by
authorized Edge Enabler Layer functions via CAPIF core function specified in
3GPP TS 23.222 [6]; and

two functions (e.g. EES, ECS) is shown by an appropriate point-to-point
reference point (e.g. EDGE-6, EDGE-7).
Edge Enabler Layer functions shown in the service-based representation of the
edge architecture shall only use service-based interfaces for their
interactions.
Figure 6.2-1 illustrates the service based representation of architecture for
enabling edge applications.
Figure 6.2-1: Architecture for enabling edge applications - service-based
representation
NOTE: The EEC function and EAS function in figure 6.2-1 do not expose any
service to the other functions.

depicted in figure 6.2-1 are as follows:
\- The EES discovers the ECS via pre-configuration or by using CAPIF as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6];
\- The EAS discovers the EES via pre-configuration or by using CAPIF as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6];
\- The EAS discovers the other EAS(s) as specified in clause 8.8.3.2;
\- The EEC discovers the ECS as specified in clause 8.3.2; and
\- The EEC discovers the EES via service provisioning as specified in clause
8.3.3.

depicted in figure 6.2-3 is as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].
Figure 6.2-4 illustrates the reference point representation of the
architecture for edge enabling applications.
Figure 6.2-4: Architecture for enabling edge applications - reference points
representation
The EDN is a local Data Network. EAS(s) and the EES are contained within the
EDN. The ECS provides configurations related to the EES, including details of
the EDN hosting the EES. The UE contains AC(s) and the EEC. The EAS(s), the
EES and the ECS can interact with the 3GPP Core Network.
## 6.3 Functional entities
### 6.3.1 General
This clause describes the functional entities of the architecture for enabling
edge applications.
### 6.3.2 Edge Enabler Server (EES)
EES provides supporting functions needed for EASs and EEC.
Functionalities of EES are:
a) provisioning of configuration information to EEC, enabling exchange of
application data traffic with the EAS;
b) providing API invoker and API exposing functions as specified in 3GPP TS
23.222 [6];
c) interacting with 3GPP Core Network for accessing the capabilities of
network functions either directly (e.g. via PCF) or indirectly (i.e.
SCEF/NEF/SCEF+NEF);
d) exposing events related to ACT;
e) EEC context transfer between EESs;
f) supporting external exposure of 3GPP network and service capabilities to
the EAS(s) over EDGE-3;
g) registration functions (i.e., registration, update, and de-registration)
for the EEC(s) and the EAS(s);
h) triggering the EAS instantiation on demand; and
i) supporting ACR related operations (e.g. ACR launching, ACR information
notification, EELManagedACR).
### 6.3.3 Edge Enabler Client (EEC)
EEC provides supporting functions needed for AC(s).
Functionalities of EEC are:
a) retrieval of configuration information to enable the exchange of
Application Data Traffic with the EAS;
b) discovery of EASs available in the EDN; and
c) detecting UE mobility events.
### 6.3.4 Edge Configuration Server (ECS)
ECS provides supporting functions needed for the EEC to connect with an EES.
Functionalities of ECS are:
a) provisioning of Edge configuration information to the EEC. The Edge
configuration information includes the following:
1) the information for the EEC to distinguish amongst the EESs (e.g. EDN
service area); and
2) the information for establishing a connection with EESs (such as URI);
b) providing the T-EES information to the S-EES;
NOTE: The ECS can be deployed in the MNO domain or can be deployed in 3^rd^
party domain by service provider.
> c) supporting the functionalities of registration (i.e., registration,
> update, and de-registration) for the EES(s);
>
> d) supporting the functionalities of API invoker and API exposing function
> as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6]; and
>
> e) interacting with 3GPP Core Network for accessing the capabilities of
> network functions either directly (e.g. via PCF) or indirectly (i.e.
> SCEF/NEF/SCEF+NEF).
### 6.3.5 Application Client (AC)
AC is the application resident in the UE performing the client function.
Depending on how ACR is implemented, the AC might be required to decide
whether to initiate ACR. Other details of the AC are out of scope of this
specification.
### 6.3.6 Edge Application Server (EAS)
EAS is the application server resident in the EDN, performing the server
functions. The AC connects to the EAS in order to avail the services of the
application with the benefits of Edge Computing.
It is possible that the server functions of an application are available only
as an EAS.
However, it is also possible that certain server functions are available both
at the edge and in the cloud, as an EAS and an Application Server resident in
the cloud respectively. The server functions offered by an EAS and its cloud
Application Server counterpart may be the same or may differ; if they differ,
the Application Data Traffic exchanged with the AC may also be different.
The EAS can consume the 3GPP Core Network capabilities in the following ways,
all of which are optional to support:
a) invoking 3GPP Core Network capabilities via the edge enabler layer through
the EES
b) invoking 3GPP Core Network function (e.g. PCF) APIs directly, if it is an
entity trusted by the 3GPP Core Network; and
c) invoking the 3GPP Core Network capabilities through the capability exposure
functions i.e. SCEF/NEF/SCEF+NEF.
The EAS can support processing ACR related operations (e.g. ACR status update,
selected target EAS declaration).
## 6.4 Service-based interfaces

d) service continuity procedures (e.g. ACR initiation).
### 6.5.3 EDGE-2
EDGE-2 reference point enables interactions between the EES and the 3GPP Core
Network functions and APIs for retrieval of network capability information. It
supports:
\- access via SCEF and NEF APIs as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], 3GPP TS
23.502 [3], 3GPP TS 29.522 [4], 3GPP TS 23.682 [17], 3GPP TS 29.122 [5]; or

NOTE: EDGE-2 reference point reuses 3GPP reference points or interfaces of EPS
or 5GS considering different deployment models.

# 7 Identities and commonly used values
## 7.1 General
The following clauses list identities and commonly used values that are used
in this technical specification.
## 7.2 Identities
### 7.2.1 General
The following clauses specify a collection of identities that are associated
with entities defined and being used in this specification.
### 7.2.2 Edge Enabler Client ID (EECID)
The EECID is a globally unique value that identifies an EEC.
NOTE: Security and privacy aspects related to EECID are specified in 3GPP TS
33.558 [23].
### 7.2.3 Edge Enabler Server ID (EESID)
The EESID identifies an EES and each EES connected with the PLMN has a unique
EESID within PLMN domain.
### 7.2.4 Edge Application Server ID (EASID)
The EASID is a globally unique identifier which identifies a particular
application for e.g. SA6Video, SA6Game etc. All EAS instances (e.g. of
SA6Video application) will share the same EASID.
NOTE: The definition of the EASID is out of scope of this specification.
### 7.2.5 Application Client ID (ACID)
The ACID identifies the client side of a particular application, for e.g.
SA6Video viewer, SA6MsgClient etc. For example, all SA6MsgClient clients will
share the same ACID.
In case that the UE is running mobile OS, the ACID is a pair of OSId and
OSAppId.
### 7.2.6 UE ID
The UE ID uniquely identifies a particular UE within a PLMN domain. Following
identities are examples that can be used:
a) GPSI, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
NOTE: To protect privacy of the user, MSISDN can be used as GPSI only after
obtaining user\'s consent.
### 7.2.7 UE Group ID
The UE Group ID uniquely identifies a group of UE within a PLMN domain.
Following identities are examples that can be used:
a) internal group ID, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]; and
b) external group ID, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
### 7.2.8 EEC Context ID
The EEC Context ID is a globally unique value which identifies a set of
parameters associated with the EEC (e.g., due to registration) and maintained
in the Edge Enabler Layer by EESs.
If the EEC registration request does not include a previously assigned EEC
Context ID value, the receiver EES assigns a new EEC Context ID and creates an
EEC Context as described in the Table 8.2.8-1.
Providing a previously assigned EEC Context ID at registration allows
maintaining the EEC Context in the Edge Enabler Layer beyond the lifetime of a
registration, subject to policies. If the EEC registration request does
include a previously assigned EEC Context ID value, after EEC Context
relocation, the receiver EES may assign a new EEC Context ID, subject to
implementation and local policies.
NOTE: The EEC Context ID may be implemented as combination of other IDs (e.g.,
EES ID and registration ID). How the EEC Context ID is specified or assigned
is out of scope of this specification.
## 7.3 Commonly used values
### 7.3.1 General
### 7.3.2 UE location
The UE location identifies where the UE is connected to the network or the
position of the UE. It provides consistent definition of the UE\'s location
across the UE and network entities. Following values are examples of UE
locations that can be used:
a) Cell Identity, Tracking Area Identity, GPS Coordinates or civic addresses
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] clause 4.15.3.
### 7.3.3 Service areas
#### 7.3.3.1 General
ECSPs and ASPs may allow [ ]{.underline} access to Edge Computing service from
specific areas i.e. allowing only the UEs within that area to access
functional entities resident in the EDN. This area is called service area.
Some functional elements make decisions based on the topological location of
the UE, (e.g. the cell it is connected to) while others make decisions based
on the UE\'s geographical location (e.g. its geographical coordinates).
Functional elements that are aware of both topological and geographical
information can translate one value to the other.
#### 7.3.3.2 Topological Service Area
A Topological Service Area is defined in relationship with a UE\'s point of
connection to the network, such as: a collection of Cell IDs, Tracking Area
Identities or the PLMN ID. Any UE that is attached to the Core Network from a
cell whose ID is in this list, can be served by the functional entity in the
EDN that is configured to serve that Topological Service Area.
NOTE: Topological Service Area information is not applicable for untrusted
functional elements (EESs and/or EASs deployed outside the MNO trust domain).
#### 7.3.3.3 Geographical Service Area
A Geographical Service Area is an area that is specified by geographical units
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.032 [21], such as: Geographical coordinates, an area
that is defined as a circle whose centre is denoted by geographical
coordinates, an area that is defined by a polygon whose corners are denoted by
geographical coordinates. A Geographical Service Area can also be expressed in
other ways such as: a well-known buildings, parks, arenas, civic addresses or
ZIP code etc.
Applications can be configured to serve UEs that are in a specified
geographical area and deny service from UEs that are not located in that area.
NOTE: Whether and how geographical information is used by applications to
provide or deny service is out of scope.
#### 7.3.3.4 EDN service area
A service area from which the access to the EDN is allowed. ECSPs can use
LADNs, as described in Annex A.2.4 of this document, to deploy EDNs with
access restricted from specific areas. When an EDN is deployed using LADN, the
EDN service area is same as the LADN service area and rules specified for LADN
apply to the UE, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
In a deployment using DNs other than LADNs, the EDN service area is the whole
PLMN for non-roaming scenario.
NOTE 1: The EDN service area for roaming scenario is out of scope in this
release of the specification.
NOTE 2: For the purpose of restricting the access to the EES from specific
areas, ECSP can use the EES service area, which is specified in clause
7.3.3.5, even if the EDN service area is the whole PLMN.
The EDN service area may be expressed as a Topological Service Area.
#### 7.3.3.5 EES Service Area
A service area from which the access to the EES is allowed. This service area
is equal to or a subset of the service area of the EDN in which the EES
resides.
The EES service area may be expressed as a Topological Service Area, a
Geographical Service Area or both.
#### 7.3.3.6 EAS service area
A service area from which the access to the EAS is allowed. This service area
is equal to or a subset of the service area of the EES which serves the EAS.
The EAS service area may be expressed as a Topological Service Area, a
Geographical Service Area or both.

## 8.3 ECS Discovery and Service provisioning
### 8.3.1 General
Service provisioning allows configuring the EEC with information about
available Edge Computing services, based on the hosting UEs location, service
requirements, service preferences and connectivity. This configuration
includes the necessary address information for the EEC to establish connection
with the EES(s).
If the ECS deployed by MNO is contracted with one or more ECSP(s), the ECS
provides EES configuration information of MNO owned and ECSP owned EESs via
MNO ECS as described in clause 8.3.3.3.3.
If the ECS is deployed by a non-MNO ECSP, the ECS endpoint address may be
configured with the EEC. An EEC that is aware of multiple ECSP\'s ECS endpoint
addresses may perform the service provisioning procedure per ECS of each ECSP
multiple times.
Figure 8.3.1-1 illustrates an overview of service provisioning. Service
provisioning procedures support the following models:
\- Request/Response model; and
\- Subscribe/Notify model.
Figure 8.3.1-1: Overview of Service provisioning
The UE is initially provisioned from the ECS with the configurations required
to connect to the EDN. Once provisioned, the EEC of the UE registers with the
selected EES(s) from the list of provisioned EES(s) it received from the
ECS(s) ), if the EEC registration configuration in EES profile indicates that
EEC registration is required. The UE further consumes the edge computing
services and performs various operations such as EAS discovery, Edge
application communications, ACR, etc. While the UE is consuming the edge
computing services, there may be several triggers which may cause service
provisioning to be triggered by the UE or by the ECS.
The triggers for service provisioning are classified as:
a. Triggers at UE - Some examples are:
\- AC related updates available at the EEC due to AC installation/re-
installation, AC requesting application server access (e.g. via internet
browser);
\- EEC supporting one or more ACs may be updated due to EEC re-installation;
and
\- Lifetime of EDN Configuration Information is expired or the EEC detects
that the UE moves out of EDN Service Area in the EDN Configuration
Information.
b. Triggers at ECS -- Some examples are:
\- EES updates received due to EAS installation/re-installation/re-location;
and
\- ECS receives the EDN/DNAI change notification of the UE from 5GC when the
ECS subscribes to the user plane path management events as specified in clause
8.10.2.
### 8.3.2 ECS Discovery
#### 8.3.2.1 General
ECS configuration information consists of one or more endpoint information
(e.g. URI(s), FQDN(s), IP address(es)) of ECS(s), and optionally the
corresponding ECS Provider Identifier. ECS configuration information can be
\- pre-configured with the EEC;
\- configured by an edge-aware AC;
\- configured by the user;
\- provisioned by MNO through 5GC procedure if the UE has the capability to
deliver the ECS configuration information to the EEC on the UE (see 3GPP TS
23.548 [20], clause 6.5.2); or
\- derived from HPLMN identifier for non-roaming scenario or from VPLMN
identifier for roaming scenario.
NOTE: How the ECS configuration information is configured to the EEC by the
AC, user, or pre-configuration is out of scope of the present specification.
It may be possible to provide the ECS configuration information to the EEC
from the 5GC if the UE has the capability to deliver the ECS configuration
information to the EEC on the UE.
If the ECS configuration information is provided by 5GC and available at the
EEC, the EEC shall use the information for the initial provisioning request.
Otherwise, the EEC shall use pre-configured ECS address for the initial
provisioning if ECS configuration information is preconfigured with the EEC.
Table 8.3.2.1-1 describes the information elements of ECS configuration
information for an ECS.

#### 8.3.3.2 Procedures
##### 8.3.3.2.1 General
Following procedures are supported for service provisioning:
\- Request-response procedure;
\- Subscribe-notify procedures, including:
\- Subscription procedure;
\- Notification procedure;
\- Subscription update procedure; and
\- Unsubscribe procedure.
##### 8.3.3.2.2 Request-response model
Figure 8.3.3.2.2-1 illustrates service provisioning procedure based on
request/response model.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has been pre-configured or has discovered the address (e.g. URI)
of the ECS;
2\. The EEC has been authorized to communicate with the ECS;
3\. The UE Identifier is either preconfigured or resulted from a successful
authorization; and
4\. The ECS is configured with ECSP\'s policy for service provisioning.
NOTE 1: Details of ECSP\'s policy are out of scope.
Figure 8.3.3.2.2-1: Service provisioning -- Request/Response
1\. The EEC sends a service provisioning request to the ECS. The service
provisioning request includes the security credentials of the EEC received
during EEC authorization procedure and may include the UE identifier such as
GPSI, connectivity information, UE location and AC profile(s) information.
2\. Upon receiving the request, the ECS performs an authorization check to
verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. The ECS may
utilize the capabilities (e.g. UE location) of the 3GPP core network as
specified in clause 8.10.2. If AC profile(s) are provided by the EEC, the ECS
identifies the EES(s) based on the provided AC profile(s) and the UE location.
When AC profiles(s) are not provided, then:
\- if available, the ECS identifies the EES(s) based on the UE-specific
service information at the ECS and the UE location;
\- ECS identifies the EES(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only on
the UE location);
NOTE 2: Details of the UE-specific service information and how it is available
at the ECS is out of scope.
NOTE 3: Both steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.
> The ECS also determines other information that needs to be provisioned, e.g.
> identification of the EDN, EDN service area, EES endpoints.
3\. If the processing of the request was successful, the ECS responds to the
EEC\'s request with a service provisioning response which includes a list of
EDN configuration information, e.g. identification of the EDN, EDN service
area, and the required information (e.g. URI, IP address) for establishing a
connection to the EES.
> If the ECS is not provisioned with any EDN configuration information or is
> unable to determine the EES information using the inputs in service
> provisioning request, UE-specific service information at the ECS or the
> ECSP\'s policy, the ECS shall reject the service provisioning request and
> respond with an appropriate failure cause.
If the EDN configuration information includes an LADN DNN as an identifier for
the EDN, the EEC considers the LADN as the EDN. Therefore, the service area of
EDN is the LADN Service Area which can be discovered using the UE Registration
Procedure.
The EEC may cache the service provisioning information (e.g. EES endpoint) for
subsequent use and avoid the need to repeat step 1. If the Lifetime IE is
included in the Service provisioning response, then the EEC may cache and
reuse the Service provisioning information only for the duration specified by
the Lifetime IE, without the need to repeat step 1.
If the ECS provided information regarding the service continuity support of
individual EESs, the EEC may take this information into account when selecting
an EES for EEC registration, EAS discovery or T-EAS discovery, respectively.
NOTE 4: If the service provisioning request fails, the EEC can resend the
service provisioning request again, taking into account the received failure
cause.
NOTE 5: Even after the EEC establishes a connection to the EES using
information received in step 3, the EES can issue AF request to influence
traffic routing from EEC to EES as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] clause
5.6.7.
##### 8.3.3.2.3 Subscribe-notify model
###### 8.3.3.2.3.1 General
Clause 8.3.3.2.3.2 and clause 8.3.3.2.3.3 together illustrate the service
provisioning procedure based on Subscribe/Notify model.
Clause 8.3.3.2.3.4 illustrates the service provisioning update procedure.
Clause 8.3.3.2.3.5 illustrates the service provisioning unsubscribe procedure.
###### 8.3.3.2.3.2 Subscribe
Figure 8.3.3.2.3.2-1 illustrates the service provisioning subscription
procedure between the EEC and the ECS.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has been pre-configured or has discovered the address (e.g. URI)
of the ECS;
2\. The EEC has been authorized to communicate with the ECS as specified in
clause 8.11;
3\. The UE Identifier is either preconfigured or resulted from a successful
authorization;
4\. The ECS is configured with ECSP\'s policy for service provisioning; and
5\. The EEC has optionally acquired a Notification Target Address to be used
in its subscriptions to notifications.
NOTE 1: Details of ECSP\'s policy are out of scope.
NOTE 2: How the EEC acquires the notification target address or a notification
channel URI to receive the notifications is out of scope of this release. The
notification target address can terminate at the EEC (e.g. in an IoT device)
if the deployment supports EEC reachability, or it can terminate at a push
notification service. Details of the push notification service are out of
scope of this release.
Figure 8.3.3.2.3.2-1: Service provisioning subscription
1\. The EEC sends a service provisioning subscription request to the ECS. The
service provisioning subscription request includes the security credentials of
the EEC received during EEC authorization procedure and Notification Target
Address (e.g. URL) and may include the UE identifier such as GPSI,
connectivity information, proposed expiration time and AC Profile information.
2\. Upon receiving the request, the ECS performs an authorization check to
verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. If
required, the ECS may utilize the capabilities (e.g. UE location or user plane
management event notification service if available) of the 3GPP core network
as specified in clause 8.10.2. If the request is authorized, the ECS creates
and stores the subscription for provisioning.
NOTE 3: The ECS can monitor the user plane path change for EDGE-1 traffic
toward EES(s) by utilizing the user plane management event notification
service specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. Based on target DNAI reported from
5GC the ECS can notify more suitable EES(s) to the EEC.
3\. If the processing of the request was successful, the ECS responds with a
service provisioning subscription response, which includes the subscription
identifier and may include the expiration time, indicating when the
subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the EEC
shall send a Service provisioning subscription update request prior to the
expiration time. If a Service provisioning subscription update request is not
received prior to the expiration time, the ECS shall treat the EEC as
implicitly unsubscribed.
> If the ECS is unable to determine the EES information using the inputs in
> service provisioning subscription request, UE-specific service information
> at the ECS or the ECSP policy, the ECS shall reject the service provisioning
> subscription request and respond with an appropriate failure cause.
NOTE 4: If the service provisioning subscription request fails, the EEC can
resend the service provisioning subscription request again, taking into
account the received failure cause.
###### 8.3.3.2.3.3 Notify
Figure 8.3.3.2.3.3-1 illustrates the service provisioning notification
procedure between the EEC and the ECS.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has subscribed with the ECS for the provisioning information as
specified in clause 8.3.3.2.3.2.
Figure 8.3.3.2.3.3-1: Service provisioning notification
1\. An event occurs at the ECS that satisfies trigger conditions for updating
service provisioning of a subscribed EEC. If UE\'s location information is not
available, the ECS may obtain the UE location by utilizing the capabilities of
the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.2. If AC profile(s) were
provided by the EEC during subscription creation, the ECS identifies the
EES(s) based on the provided AC profile(s) and the UE location. If AC
profiles(s) were not provided, then:
\- if available, the ECS identifies the EES(s) based on the UE-specific
service information at the ECS and the UE location;
\- ECS identifies the EES(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only on
the UE location);
NOTE 1: Details of the UE-specific service information and how it is available
at the ECS is out of scope.
NOTE 2: Both steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.
> The ECS also determines other information that needs to be provisioned, e.g.
> identification of the EDN, EDN service area, EES endpoints.
2\. The ECS sends a provisioning notification to the EEC with the list of EDN
configuration information determined in step 1.
If the EDN configuration information in the service provisioning notification
includes an LADN DNN as an identifier for the EDN, the EEC considers the LADN
as the EDN. Therefore, the service area of EDN is the LADN Service Area, which
can be discovered using the UE Registration Procedure.
If the ECS provided information regarding the service continuity support of
individual EESs, the EEC may take this information into account when selecting
an EES for EEC registration, EAS discovery or T-EAS discovery, respectively.
NOTE 3: Even after the EEC establishes a connection to the EES using
information received in step 2, the EES can issue AF request to influence
traffic routing from EEC to EES as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] clause
5.6.7.
###### 8.3.3.2.3.4 Subscription update
Figure 8.3.3.2.3.4-1 illustrates the service provisioning subscription update
procedure between the EEC and the ECS.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has subscribed with the ECS for the provisioning information as
specified in clause 8.3.3.2.3.2.
Figure 8.3.3.2.3.4-1: Service provisioning subscription update
1\. The EEC sends a service provisioning subscription update request to the
ECS. The service provisioning subscription update request includes the
security credentials of the EEC received during EEC authorization procedure
along with the subscription identifier and may include the UE identifier such
as GPSI, connectivity information, proposed expiration time for the updated
subscription and AC profile(s).
2\. Upon receiving the request, the ECS performs an authorization check to
verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. If
required, the ECS may utilize the capabilities (e.g. UE location) of the 3GPP
core network as specified in clause 8.10.2. If authorized, the ECS updates the
stored subscription for provisioning as requested in step 1.
3\. The ECS responds with a service provisioning subscription update response,
which may include the expiration time, indicating when the updated
subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the EEC
shall send a Service provisioning subscription update request prior to the
expiration time. If a Service provisioning subscription update request is not
received prior to the expiration time, the ECS shall treat the EEC as
implicitly unsubscribed.
###### 8.3.3.2.3.5 Unsubscribe
Figure 8.3.3.2.3.5-1 illustrates the service provisioning unsubscribe
procedure between the EEC and the ECS.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has subscribed with the ECS for the provisioning information as
specified in clause 8.3.3.2.3.2.
Figure 8.3.3.2.3.5-1: Service provisioning unsubscribe
1\. The EEC sends a service provisioning unsubscribe request to the ECS. The
service provisioning unsubscribe request includes the security credentials of
the EEC received during EEC authorization procedure along with the
subscription identifier.
2\. Upon receiving the request, the ECS performs an authorization check to
verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. If
authorized, the ECS cancels the subscription for provisioning as requested in
step 1.
3\. The ECS responds with a service provisioning unsubscribe response.
#### 8.3.3.3 Information flows
##### 8.3.3.3.1 General
The following information flows are specified for service provisioning:
\- Service provisioning request and response;

## 8.4 Registration
### 8.4.1 General
Registration procedures allow entities in the edge deployment to deliver
information to other entities.
The following registrations are supported:
\- EEC registration with EES;
\- EAS registration with EES; and
\- EES registration with ECS.
### 8.4.2 EEC Registration
#### 8.4.2.1 General
An EEC performs registration with an EES in order to provide information that
can be used by the EES in Edge Computing services. The procedure also enables
initialization, update and removal of the EEC context information at the EES.
The context may be further used for edge-specific operations or processing,
e.g. analytics.
An EEC may be registered with one or more EESs on behalf of one or more ACs
simultaneously.
#### 8.4.2.2 Procedures
##### 8.4.2.2.1 General
Following are supported for EEC registration:
\- EEC registration procedure;
\- EEC registration update procedure;
\- EEC de-registration procedure; and
\- EEC Context relocation procedure.
NOTE: In this version of specification, each registration procedure provides
for registering a single EEC per UE.
##### 8.4.2.2.2 EEC registration
Figure 8.4.2.2.2-1 illustrates EEC registration procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC is authorized to access the EES for the purpose of performing
registration and has received relevant security credentials as specified in
clause 8.11; and
2\. The EEC has received service provisioning information from the ECS,
including information for accessing the EES.
Figure 8.4.2.2.2-1: EEC registration procedure
1\. The EEC sends EEC registration request to the EES. The request from the
client includes the security credentials received after successful
authorization for edge computing services and may include a proposed
expiration time. The request also optionally includes information indicating
to the EES how the EEC expects to use the services of the EES.
If the EEC is moving to this EES from the purview of another EES, called
S-EES, the request from the EEC may include the identity and endpoint of the
S-EES and an EEC context ID that was provided by the S-EES to maintain
continuity of the EEC context and to authorize EEC context relocation. If the
EEC registration is being performed as part of ACR, the EEC shall not include
the S-EES endpoint and the EEC context ID.
2\. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES validates the
registration request and verifies the security credentials. The EES further
determines whether the requirements that were indicated in the AC Profile(s)
can be fulfilled and reserves corresponding resources.
NOTE: Resource reservation at EEC registration ensures that the EES provides
services for the duration of the registration.
3\. Upon successful validation of the request, if the received EEC
registration request contains an EEC context ID and a S-EES Endpoint, the EES
performs a EEC Context Pull relocation (clause 8.9.2.2) from the S-EES. The
source and target EES perform EEC Context handling as detailed in clause
8.9.1.
NOTE 1: Only a single EEC Context ID may be provided in the EEC registration
request.
NOTE 2: In this version of specification, each registration procedure
relocates a single EEC context.
NOTE 3: Step 3 is executed when EEC determines to change its connection from
S-EES to T-EES and ACR is not required.
> If the EEC registration request fails after the EEC Context Pull relocation,
> e.g., the EES cannot reserve the necessary resources while meeting the
> capability requirements of the existing registered EECs, the EES shall
> determine the EEC Context information stale and send a failure response with
> a corresponding cause.
4\. The EES sends a successful EEC registration response, which includes the
registration ID and may include a newly assigned EEC context ID. If the EEC
registration request contains AC Profile(s), and the EES determines that the
requirements indicated in the AC profile(s) cannot be fulfilled for some of
the AC profile(s), the EES shall include the list of ACIDs of such AC
Profile(s) and may include appropriate reasons. If step 3 was executed, the
EEC registration response also includes EEC context retrieval result. The EEC
stores the new EEC context ID and uses it if and when it registers with
another EES. The EES may also provide an expiration time to indicate to the
EEC when the registration will automatically expire. To maintain the
registration, the EEC shall send a registration update request prior to the
expiration. If a registration update request is not received prior to the
expiration time, the EES shall treat the EEC as implicitly de-registered.
> If the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context
> relocation was not successful, then the EEC performs the required EDGE-1
> subscriptions at the T-EES.

### 8.4.3 EAS Registration
#### 8.4.3.1 General
The EAS Registration procedure allows an EAS to provide its information to an
EES in order to enable its discovery.
If there is a change in the requirements or the information of an EAS, it uses
the EAS registration update procedure to update the EES.
The EAS uses the EAS de-registration procedure to remove its information from
the EES.
EAS registration at the EES can be time bound. So, to maintain the
registration, the EAS needs to send a registration update request prior to the
registration expiration time. If a registration update request is not received
prior to the registration expiration time, the EES treats the EAS as
implicitly de-registered.
#### 8.4.3.2 Procedures
##### 8.4.3.2.1 General
Following are supported for EAS registration:
\- EAS registration procedure;
\- EAS registration update procedure; and
\- EAS de-registration procedure.
##### 8.4.3.2.2 EAS registration
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EAS has been configured with an EASID;
2\. The EAS has been configured with the address (e.g. URI) of the EES; and
3\. Both the EAS and EES have the necessary credentials to enable
communications.
Figure 8.4.3.2.2-1: EAS Registration procedure
1\. The EAS determines that registration to the EES is needed (e.g. the EAS is
instantiated and started up).
2\. The EAS sends an EAS registration request to the EES. The request shall
include the EAS profile and may include proposed expiration time for the
registration.
3\. The EES performs an authorization check to verify whether the EAS has the
authorization to register on the EES.
4\. Upon successful authorization, the EES stores the EAS Profile for later
use (e.g. for serving EAS discovery requests received from EECs, etc.) and
replies to the EAS with an EAS registration response. The EES may provide an
expiration time to indicate to the EAS when the registration will
automatically expire. To maintain the registration, the EAS shall send a
registration update request prior to the expiration time. If a registration
update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall
treat the EAS as implicitly de-registered.
##### 8.4.3.2.3 EAS registration update
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EAS has already registered with the EES.
Figure 8.4.3.2.3-1: EAS registration update procedure
1\. The EAS determines that its existing registration needs to be updated
(e.g. because the EAS\'s status or availability schedule has changed, or
EAS\'s registration is about to expire).
2\. The EAS sends an EAS registration update request to the EES. The request
shall include the registration ID and may include the EAS profile and proposed
expiration time for the updated registration.
3\. The EES performs an authorization check to verify whether the EAS has the
authorization to update the registration on the EES.
4\. Upon successful authorization, the EES updates the registered EAS Profile
and replies to the EAS with an EAS registration update response. The EES may
provide an updated expiration time to indicate to the EAS when the updated
registration will automatically expire. To maintain the registration, the EAS
shall send a registration update request prior to the expiration time. If a
registration update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the
EES shall treat the EAS as implicitly de-registered.
##### 8.4.3.2.4 EAS de-registration
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EAS has already registered with the EES.
Figure 8.4.3.2.4-1: EAS de-registration procedure
1\. The EAS determines that its existing registration needs to be terminated
(e.g. because the services of the EAS are not needed anymore).
2\. The EAS sends an EAS de-registration request to the EES. The request shall
include the registration ID.
3\. The EES performs an authorization check to verify whether the EAS has the
authorization to de-register explicitly.
4\. Upon successful authorization, the EES removes the registered EAS Profile
and replies to the EAS with an EAS de-registration response.

### 8.4.4 EES Registration
#### 8.4.4.1 General
The EES Registration procedure allows an EES to provide information to an ECS
in order to enable provisioning EES(s) to an EEC.
The EES registration update procedure allows an EES to update the ECS, if
there is a change in the information at the EES.
The EES uses the EES de-registration procedure to remove its information from
the ECS.

## 8.5 EAS discovery
### 8.5.1 General
Discovery procedures enable entities in an edge deployment to obtain
information about EAS and their available services, based on specified
criteria of interest.
EAS discovery enables the EEC to obtain information about available EASs of
interest. The discovery of the EASs is based on matching EAS discovery filters
provided in the request.
When multiple EASs are discovered for a specific AC, the EEC may select one or
more EASs to enable AC communication with one of the selected EASs. The
selection algorithm is outside the scope of this specification. Once the EAS
is selected, the EEC may subscribe for the ACR event notifications at the EES
of the selected EAS, as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2. The EDN configuration
information received from ECS may be used for establishing a connection to
EAS(s).
EAS discovery may be initiated by the EEC when a certain trigger condition at
the UE is met. Some examples are as follows:
\- AC related updates available at the EEC (e.g. due to AC installation/re-
installation/activation), AC requesting application server access;
\- Lifetime received via EAS discovery response specified in clause 8.5.3 is
expired; or
\- EEC detects the need of application context relocation as in clause 8.8.
NOTE: When the EEC decides to perform EAS discovery is up to EEC
implementation.
### 8.5.2 Procedures
#### 8.5.2.1 General
Following procedures are supported for EAS discovery:
\- Request-response procedure;
\- Subscribe-notify procedures for EAS discovery and EAS dynamic information
subscription, comprising:
\- Subscription procedure;
\- Subscription update procedure; and
\- Unsubscribe procedure;
#### 8.5.2.2 Request-response model
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has received information (e.g. URI, IP address) related to the
EES;
2\. The EEC has received appropriate security credentials authorizing it to
communicate with the EES as specified in clause 8.11; and
3\. The EES is configured with ECSP\'s policy for EAS discovery.
NOTE 1: Details of ECSP\'s policy are out of scope.
Figure 8.5.2.2-1: EAS Discovery procedure
1\. The EEC sends an EAS discovery request to the EES. The EAS discovery
request includes the requestor identifier [EECID] along with the security
credentials and may include EAS discovery filters and may also include UE
location to retrieve information about particular EAS(s) or a category of
EASs, e.g. gaming applications, or Edge Applications Server(s) available in
certain service areas, e.g. available on a UE\'s predicted or expected route.
2\. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is
authorized to discover the requested EAS(s). The authorization check may apply
to an individual EAS, a category of EASs or to the EDN, i.e. to all the EASs.
If UE\'s location information is not already available, the EES obtains the UE
location by utilizing the capabilities of the 3GPP core network as specified
in clause 8.10.3. If EAS discovery filters are provided by the EEC, the EES
identifies the EAS(s) based on the provided EAS discovery filters and the UE
location. If the EEC indicates that service continuity support is required,
the EES shall take the indication which ACR scenarios are supported by the AC
and the EEC and which of these are preferred by the AC into consideration.
When EAS discovery filters are not provided, then:
\- if available, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the UE-specific
service information at the EES and the UE location;
\- EES identifies the EAS(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only on
the UE location);
NOTE 2: Details of the UE-specific service information and how it is available
at the EES is out of scope.
NOTE 3: Both steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.
> Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES may trigger the ECSP
> management system to instantiate the EAS that matches with EAS discovery
> filter IEs (e.g. ACID) as in clause 8.12.
3\. If the processing of the request was successful, the EES sends an EAS
discovery response to the EEC, which includes information about the discovered
EASs. For discovered EASs, this includes endpoint information. Depending on
the EAS discovery filters received in the EAS discovery request, the response
may include additional information regarding matched capabilities, e.g.
service permissions levels, KPIs, AC locations(s) that the EASs can support,
ACR scenarios supported by the EAS, etc. The EAS discovery response may
contain a list of EASs. This list may be based on EAS discovery filters
containing a Geographical or Topological Service Area, e.g. a route, included
in the EAS discovery request by the EEC.
> If the EES is unable to determine the EAS information using the inputs in
> the EAS discovery request, UE-specific service information at the EES or the
> ECSP policy, the EES shall reject the EAS discovery request and respond with
> an appropriate failure cause.
If the EEC is not registered with the EES, and ECSP policy requires the EEC to
perform EEC registration prior to EAS discovery, the EES shall include an
appropriate failure cause in the EAS discovery response indicating that EEC
registration is required.
> If the UE location and predicted/expected UE locations, provided in the EAS
> discovery request, are outside the Geographical or Topological Service Area
> of an EAS, then the EES shall not include that EAS in the discovery
> response. The discovery response may include EAS(s) that cannot serve the UE
> at its current location if a predicted/expected UE location was provided in
> the EAS discovery request.
Upon receiving the EAS discovery response, the EEC uses the endpoint
information for routing of the outgoing application data traffic to EAS(s), as
needed, and may provide necessary notifications to the AC(s). The EEC may use
the border or overlap between EAS Geographical Service Areas for service
continuity purposes. The EEC may cache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint)
for subsequent use and avoid the need to repeat step 1. If the Lifetime IE is
included in the response, the EEC may cache the EAS information only for the
duration specified by the Lifetime IE.
NOTE 4: Within the duration specified by the Lifetime IE, the cached EAS
Profile can be updated (e.g. according to notifications from the EES for
changes of EAS information due to EAS status change) or the cached EAS Profile
can be invalidated due to new EAS information discovery (e.g. due to UE
mobility). The EEC can update or invalidate the cached EAS information (e.g.
on PDU Session Release or Modification Command).
NOTE 5: The AC can cache the EAS information (e.g. EAS endpoint) for
subsequent use. In the case of the cached information needing to be updated or
invalidated, the mechanisms for the EEC to notify the AC is up to
implementation and is not specified in the current release of the present
document.
NOTE 6: The EEC can use the EAS information provided by the discovery
procedure to perform service continuity planning, for example when ultra-low
latency ACR is required.
If the EAS discovery request fails, the EEC may resend the EAS discovery
request, taking into account the received failure cause. If the failure cause
indicated that EEC registration is required, the EEC shall perform an EEC
registration before resending the EAS discovery request.
#### 8.5.2.3 Subscribe-notify model
##### 8.5.2.3.1 General
Clause 8.5.2.3.2 and clause 8.5.2.3.3 together illustrate the EAS discovery
procedure based on Subscribe/Notify model.
Clause 8.5.2.3.4 illustrates the EAS discovery update procedure.
Clause 8.5.2.3.5 illustrates the EAS discovery unsubscribe procedure.
##### 8.5.2.3.2 Subscribe
Figure 8.5.2.3.2-1 illustrates the EAS discovery subscription procedure
between the EEC and the EES. This subscription enables EES to inform EEC of
various EAS discovery related events of interest to EEC (e.g. EAS discovery
notification and EAS dynamic information).
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has received information (e.g. URI, IP address) related to the
EES;
2\. The EEC has received appropriate security credentials authorizing it to
communicate with the EES as specified in clause 8.11;
3\. The EES is configured with ECSP\'s policy for EAS discovery; and
4\. The EEC has optionally acquired a Notification Target Address to be used
in its subscriptions to notifications.
NOTE 1: Details of ECSP\'s policy are out of scope.
NOTE 2: How the EEC acquires the notification target address or a notification
channel URI to receive the notifications is out of scope of this release. The
notification target address can terminate at the EEC (e.g. in an IoT device)
if the deployment supports EEC reachability, or it can terminate at a push
notification service. Details of the push notification service are out of
scope of this release.
Figure 8.5.2.3.2-1: EAS discovery subscription
1\. The EEC sends an EAS discovery subscription request to the EES. The EAS
discovery subscription request includes the EECID along with the security
credentials, Event ID, and may include EAS discovery filters and EAS dynamic
information filters to subscribe to information about particular EAS(s) or a
category of EASs (e.g. gaming applications) or dynamic information about
EAS(s).
2\. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is
authorized to subscribe for information of the requested EAS(s). The
authorization check may apply to an individual EAS, a category of EASs or to
the EDN, i.e. to all the EASs. The EES may utilize the capabilities (e.g. UE
location) of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.3. If the
request is authorized, the EES creates and stores the subscription for EAS
discovery.
3\. If the processing of the request was successful, the EES sends an EAS
discovery subscription response to the EEC, which includes the subscription
identifier and may include the expiration time, indicating when the
subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the EEC
shall send an EAS discovery subscription update request prior to the
expiration time. If an EAS discovery subscription update request is not
received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall treat the EEC as
implicitly unsubscribed.
> If the EES is unable to determine the EAS information using the inputs in
> the EAS discovery subscription request, UE-specific service information at
> the EES or the ECSP policy, the EES shall reject the EAS discovery
> subscription request and respond with an appropriate failure cause.
If the EEC is not registered with the EES, and ECSP policy requires the EEC to
perform EEC registration prior to EAS discovery, the EES shall include an
appropriate failure cause in the EAS discovery response indicating that EEC
registration is required.
> If the EAS discovery subscription request fails, the EEC may resend the EAS
> discovery subscription request again, taking into account the received
> failure cause. If the failure cause indicated that EEC registration is
> required, the EEC shall perform an EEC registration before resending the EAS
> discovery subscription request.
##### 8.5.2.3.3 Notify
Figure 8.5.2.3.3-1 illustrates the EAS discovery notification procedure
between the EEC and the EES.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has subscribed with the EES for the EAS discovery information as
specified in clause 8.5.2.3.2.
Figure 8.5.2.3.3-1: EAS discovery notification
1\. An event occurs at the EES that satisfies trigger conditions for notifying
(e.g. to provide EAS discovery information or EAS dynamic information) a
subscribed EEC. If UE\'s location information is not already available, the
EES obtains the UE location by utilizing the capabilities of the 3GPP core
network as specified in clause 8.10.2. If EAS discovery filters were provided
by the EEC during subscription creation, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based
on the provided EAS discovery filters and the UE location. If the EEC
indicates that service continuity support is required, the EES shall take the
indication which ACR scenarios are supported by the AC and the EEC and which
of these are preferred by the AC into consideration.
If EAS discovery filters were not provided, then:
\- if available, the EES identifies the EAS(s) based on the UE-specific
service information at the EES and the UE location;
\- EES identifies the EAS(s) by applying the ECSP policy (e.g. based only on
the UE location);
NOTE 1: Details of the UE-specific service information and how it is available
at the EES is out of scope.
NOTE 2: Both steps are evaluated prior to sending a response.
> If the UE is located outside the Geographical or Topological Service Area of
> an EAS, then the EES shall not include this EAS in the EAS discovery
> notification.
2\. The EES sends an EAS discovery notification to the EEC with the EAS
information determined in step 1.
##### 8.5.2.3.4 Subscription update
Figure 8.5.2.3.4-1 illustrates the EAS discovery subscription update procedure
between the EEC and the EES.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has subscribed with the EES for the EAS discovery information as
specified in clause 8.5.2.3.2
Figure 8.5.2.3.4-1: EAS discovery subscription update
1\. The EEC sends an EAS discovery subscription update request to the EES. The
EAS discovery subscription update request includes the security credentials
and the subscription identifier. It may also include EAS discovery filters,
EAS dynamic information filters and/or proposed expiration time for the
updated subscription.
2\. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is
authorized to update the subscription information. The EES may utilize the
capabilities (e.g. UE location) of the 3GPP core network as specified in
clause 8.10.3. If the request is authorized, the EES updated the stored
subscription for EAS discovery.
3\. The EES sends an EAS discovery subscription update response to the EEC,
which may include the expiration time, indicating when the updated
subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the subscription, the EEC
shall send an EAS discovery subscription update request prior to the
expiration time. If an EAS discovery subscription update request is not
received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall treat the EEC as
implicitly unsubscribed.
##### 8.5.2.3.5 Unsubscribe
Figure 8.5.2.3.5-1 illustrates the EAS discovery unsubscribe procedure between
the EEC and the EES.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has subscribed with the EES for notification (e.g. EAS discovery
information and EAS dynamic information) as specified in clause 8.5.2.3.2
Figure 8.5.2.3.5-1: EAS discovery unsubscribe
1\. The EEC sends an EAS discovery unsubscribe request to the EES. The EAS
discovery unsubscribe request includes the security credentials of the EEC
along with the subscription identifier.
2\. Upon receiving the request, the EES performs an authorization check to
verify whether the EEC has authorization to perform the operation. If
authorized, the EES cancels the subscription for provisioning as requested in
step 1.
3\. The EES responds with an EAS discovery unsubscribe response.
### 8.5.3 Information flows
#### 8.5.3.1 General
The following information flows are specified for EAS discovery:
\- EAS discovery request and response;
\- EAS discovery subscription, notification, subscription update and
unsubscribe; and

## 8.6 EES capability exposure to EAS
### 8.6.1 General
This clause describes service capability APIs exposed by the EES to the
EAS(s). The service capability APIs exposed include EES capabilities and
exposed 3GPP Core Network capabilities. The 3GPP Core Network capabilities may
be exposed from EES to the EAS(s).
The 3GPP Core Network capabilities APIs which are enhanced for exposure are
also specified in this clause.
NOTE: When the ACR occurs, the new EAS can re-subscribe the EES capability
exposure services on the T-EES.
### 8.6.2 UE location API
#### 8.6.2.1 General
The EES exposes the UE location API to the EAS in order to support tracking or
checking the valid location of the UE. The UE location API exposed by the EES
relies on the 3GPP core network capabilities as specified in clause 8.10.3.
The EAS can request UE location API for one-time reporting to check current UE
location and for continuous reporting to track UE\'s location.
The UE location API supports both request-response for one-time queries (in
order to check UE\'s current location) as well as subscribe-notify models for
providing UE\'s location to EAS on a continuous basis and enabling the EAS to
track UE\'s location (as UE location changes).
#### 8.6.2.2 Procedures
##### 8.6.2.2.1 General
##### 8.6.2.2.2 Request-response model
Figure 8.6.2.2.2-1 illustrates the interactions between the EES and the EAS
for one-time location report.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EAS is authorized to discover and to use UE location API provided by
the EES.
2\. The EES is authorized to use Nnef Event Exposure API for UE location,
based on service level agreement with MNO.
3\. UE Identifier between EAS and the EES is authorized for the UE location
API.
Figure 8.6.2.2.2-1: UE location API request-response model
1\. The EAS sends UE location request to the EES. The UE location request
shall include the UE Identifier. It may also include location granularity to
indicate requested format of the location e.g. GPS Coordinates, Cell ID,
Tracking Area ID, or civic addresses (e.g. streets, districts, etc.), which
can be understood by the EAS and location QoS.
NOTE 1: The trigger condition of the UE location API is up to application
service logic, which is out of scope of this specification.
2\. The EES checks the UE location:
a. If the UE location request from the EAS includes the location granularity,
the EES considers the location granularity parameter for checking the location
of the UE.
b. If the EES has a valid locally cached location of the UE, the EES may use
this cached UE location to respond to the EAS. Otherwise, the EES utilizes the
capabilities of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.3.
c. The EES may modify the format of the UE location to fit to the location
granularity requested from the EAS in the step 1, if supported. For example,
if the EES receives the UE location in a format of tracking area ID or cell
ID, the EES can modify the representation of the location information to the
GPS Coordinates, or civic addresses (e.g. streets, districts, etc.) as
requested by the EAS.
NOTE 2: Format modification mechanism of the UE location to fit the location
granularity is outside the scope of this specification. Step 2.c. can be
performed if the EES is deployed by the PLMN operator.
3\. If successful, the EES responds to the EAS with the location of the UE,
and optionally the timestamp of the location.
##### 8.6.2.2.3 Subscribe-notify model
###### 8.6.2.2.3.1 General
###### 8.6.2.2.3.2 Subscribe
Figure 8.6.2.2.3.2-1 illustrates the subscribe operation between the EAS and
the EES for continuous UE location reporting.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EAS is authorized to discover and to use UE location API provided by
the EES;
2\. The EES is authorized to use 3GPP network exposure capability (e.g. Nnef
Event Exposure API) for UE location, based on service level agreement with
MNO; and
3\. UE Identifier between EAS and the EES is authorized for the UE location
API.
Figure 8.6.2.2.3.2-1: UE location API: Subscribe operation
1\. The EAS sends UE location subscribe request to the EES for tracking a
UE\'s location continuously. The UE location subscribe request shall include
the UE Identifier or UE group Identifier and may include proposed expiration
time. It may also include location granularity to indicate requested format of
the location e.g. GPS Coordinates, Cell ID, Tracking Area ID, or civic
addresses (e.g. streets, districts, etc.), which can be understood by the EAS
and location QoS.
2\. The EES checks if the request from the EAS is authorized. If authorized,
the EES sends success response to the EAS and utilizes the UE location
exposure capability of the 3GPP core network as specified in clause 8.10.3.
The EES requests continuous location reporting from the 3GPP system to have up
to date location information of the UE.
3\. The EES may subscribe to UE expected behaviour analytics (UE mobility) as
described in 3GPP TS 23.288 [18].
4\. The response includes the subscription identifier and may include the
expiration time, indicating when the subscription will automatically expire.
To maintain the subscription, the EAS shall send a UE location subscription
update request prior to the expiration time. If a UE location subscription
update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall
treat the EAS as implicitly unsubscribed. If it is not authorized, the EES
sends failure response with rejection cause.
###### 8.6.2.2.3.3 Notify
Figure 8.6.2.2.3.3-1 illustrates the notify operation between the EES and the
EAS for continuous location.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EAS has subscribed to UE location API provided by the EES.
Figure 8.6.2.2.3.3-1: UE location API: Notify operation
1\. The EES detects the location of the UE e.g., receiving location of the UE
from the 3GPP system. The EES may cache the detected location information
locally with timestamp as the latest location information of the UE(s) and
start the notification aggregation for a group of UEs. The EES decides whether
to aggregate and the aggregation period based on the analytics result received
from the 3GPP Core Network, local policy and UE location subscription
information received from the EAS. The EES determines to notify the location
information of the UE to the EAS which has subscribed for UE\'s location.
2\. The EES sends UE location notification to the EAS. The EES includes the
location of the UE(s). Each UE location includes UE ID and location type and
may include the location accuracy and the timestamp of the location.
> The EES may modify the format of location information to fit to the location
> granularity requested from the EAS during the subscribe operation, if
> supported. For example, if the EES receives the UE location in a format of
> tracking area ID or cell ID, the EES can modify the representation of the
> location information to the GPS Coordinates, or civic addresses (e.g.
> streets, districts, etc.) as requested from the EAS.
###### 8.6.2.2.3.4 Subscription update
Figure 8.6.2.2.3.4-1 illustrates the subscription update operation between the
EAS and the EES.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EAS has subscribed to UE location API provided by the EES.
Figure 8.6.2.2.3.4-1: UE location API: Subscription update operation
1\. The EAS sends UE location subscription update request to the EES. The
request includes the subscription identifier of the subscription to be. The UE
location subscription update request may also include proposed expiration time
for the updated subscription, updated Location granularity and Location QoS.
2\. The EES checks if the request from the EAS is authorized. If authorized,
the EES updates the subscription request and may update the UE location
subscription in the 3GPP Core Network.
3\. The EES may update the subscription to the UE expected behaviour
analytics.
4\. The EES sends the UE location subscription update response to the EAS.
###### 8.6.2.2.3.5 Unsubscribe
Figure 8.6.2.2.3.5-1 illustrates the unsubscribe operation between the EAS and
the EES to stop the UE location notifications.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EAS has subscribed to UE location API provided by the EES.
Figure 8.6.2.2.3.5-1: UE location API: unsubscribe operation
1\. The EAS sends the UE location unsubscribe request to the EES.
2\. The EES checks if the EAS is authorized or not. If authorized, the EES
terminates the subscription of the EAS and unsubscribes the UE location from
the 3GPP Core Network.
3\. The EES unsubscribes from the UE expected behaviour analytics, if
applicable.
4\. The EES responds to the EAS.

### 8.6.3 ACR management events
#### 8.6.3.1 General
The EES exposes ACR management event notifications of one or more UEs to an
EAS. EES also uses ACR management event notifications to inform the EAS of the
need to start an ACT or cancel a previously started ACT. ACR management event
notifications exposed by the EES may rely on the NEF northbound API for
monitoring event of user plane path management event.
This capability exposed by the EES supports:
\- \"User plane path change\". This event supports to detect user plane path
change for the application traffic and report the corresponding notification
with user plane path change to the EAS.
\- \"ACR monitoring\". This event supports to detect user plane path change
for the application traffic, discover the T-EAS(s), and report the
corresponding notification with the discovered T-EAS(s).
\- \"ACR facilitation\". This event supports to detect user plane path change
for the application traffic, make the decision for ACR, discover the T-EAS(s),
influence the traffic for the selected T-EAS and report the corresponding
notification with the selected T-EAS.
\- \"ACT start/stop\". This event informs the EAS the need to start or stop an
ACT towards or from another EAS for a particular UE.
The availability of the ACR management event notifications relying on the user
plane path management event notification service exposed by 5GC may change due
to UE mobility between 5GC and EPC. If an EES exposes ACR event notifications
to EAS(s) for a UE by relying on the 3GPP Core Network northbound API for user
plane path management notifications, the EES monitors the availability of the
northbound API for UE(s) served by the EAS (e.g. by utilizing
Nnef_APISupportCapability as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]) and provides the
availability information to the EAS accordingly. If CAPIF is supported, the
EES determines if the ACR management event API is available and able to be
exposed to the EAS for a UE via the Availability of service APIs event
notifications provided by the CAPIF core function as defined in 3GPP TS 23.222
[6].
#### 8.6.3.2 Procedures
##### 8.6.3.2.1 General
##### 8.6.3.2.2 Subscribe
Figure 8.6.3.2.2-1 illustrates the subscribe operation between the EAS and the
EES for ACR management event notifications.
Figure 8.6.3.2.2-1: ACR management event API: Subscribe operation
1\. The EAS sends ACR management event subscribe request (e.g. tracking the
UE\'s user plane path change continuously). The EAS shall include UE
Identifier or UE group Identifier for \"user plane path change\", \"ACR
monitoring\" and \"ACR facilitation\" events.
a. The EAS may include the \"user plane path change\" event to indicate the
EES to notify the EAS when the EES detects there is a user plane path change
for the application traffic and the EAS may include Subscription Type (Early
and/or Late notification defined in clause 5.6.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]) and/or
Indication of EAS Acknowledgement in the event subscription.
b. The EAS may include the \"ACR monitoring\" event to indicate the EES to
notify the EAS when the EES detects there is a need for the ACR (e.g. when
T-EAS is available at the target DNAI). The EAS may also include the Event
Filters to specify the conditions to match for notifying the event, e.g.,
inter-EDN mobility, intra-EDN mobility.
c. The EAS may include the \"ACR facilitation\" event to request the EES to
make the decision for ACR, discover the T-EAS(s), influence the traffic for
the selected T-EAS and notify the S-EAS of the selected T-EAS.
d. The EAS may include the \"ACT start/stop\" event to indicate the EES to
notify the EAS of the need for start or stop ACT to or from another EAS for a
particular UE.
2\. The EES checks if the EAS is authorized for this operation.
> If authorized, and if the subscription in step 1 includes at least one of
> the \"user plane path change\", \"ACR monitoring\" and \"ACR facilitation\"
> events, the EES checks if there exists a subscription with the 3GPP core
> network for the user plane path management event notifications corresponding
> to the UE information obtained in step 1 as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]
> and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], which may be triggered by other EAS for the same UE.
> The EES checks the availability of the user plane path management event
> service for the UE.
a. if a subscription with 3GPP core network does not exist, then the EES
subscribes with the 3GPP core network (PCF, NEF or SCEF+NEF) for the user
plane path management event notifications of the UE as described in 3GPP TS
23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] If the EAS provides Subscription Type and/or
Indication of EAS Acknowledgement, the EES include the type of subscription
and/or the indication of \"AF acknowledgement to be expected\" as information
on AF subscription to corresponding SMF events within the AF Request;
b. if a subscription with 3GPP core network exists, then the EES uses the
locally cached user plane path management event notification information of
the UE to respond to the EAS.
> The EES stores the subscription related to the EAS.
3\. If the event is \"user plane path change\", the EES may subscribe to UE
expected behaviour analytics (UE mobility and UE communication) for the group
of UEs as described in 3GPP TS 23.288 [18].
4\. If EAS is authorized, the EES responds with ACR management event subscribe
response. If EAS is not authorized, the EES provides a rejection response with
cause information.
If the target UE and the 3GPP network support mobility between 5GC and EPC,
the EES monitors the availability of the user plane path management event
notification from the 3GPP network by utilizing Nnef_APISupportCapability or
Availability of service APIs event notifications provided by the CAPIF core
function.
##### 8.6.3.2.3 Notify
Figure 8.6.3.2.3-1 illustrates the notify operation between the EES and the
EAS for continuous ACR management event notifications.
Figure 8.6.3.2.3-1: ACR management event API: Notify operation
1\. The EES detects the ACR management event of the UE (e.g. receiving User
plane path management event notification for the UE from the 3GPP core
network).
a. If \"user plane path change\" Event is subscribed, the EES may cache the
detected User plane path management event notification locally with timestamp
as the latest information of the UE(s) and start the notification aggregation
for a group of UEs. The EES decides whether to aggregate and the aggregation
period based on the analytics result received from the 3GPP Core Network,
local policy and User Plane path management subscription information received
from the EAS. The EES determines to notify the user plane path management
event notification information (e.g., DNAI) to the EASs which has subscribed
for the \"user plane path management\" event.
b. If \"ACR monitoring\" Event is subscribed, based on the detected user plane
path change report sent from the 3GPP core network, the EES checks whether the
target DNAI is in the EAS profile of the subscribing EAS, if not it further
checks whether a T-EAS is available at the target DNAI as described in steps
2-4 of clause 8.8.3.2. If a T-EAS is available, the EES notifies the EAS with
T-EAS endpoint; otherwise this event notification will not be sent. Also, when
the EES receives the ACR request from the EEC, the EES decides to send the
notification to the EAS.
c. If \"ACR facilitation\" Event is subscribed, based on the detected user
plane path change report sent from the 3GPP core network, the EES checks
whether the target DNAI is in the EAS profile of the subscribing EAS, if not
it further checks whether a T-EAS is available at the target DNAI as described
in steps 2-4 of clause 8.8.3.2. If a T-EAS is available, the EES selects the
T-EAS from the discovered EAS list and applies the AF traffic influence with
the N6 routing information of the selected T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network. The
EES also notifies the S-EAS with the selected T-EAS endpoint.
d. If \"ACT start/stop\" event is subscribed, during the ACR launch if the EEC
indicates the need to notify the EAS in the ACR request as described in clause
8.8.3.4, the EES shall send notification to the EAS to inform it about the
need to start or stop the ACT to or from another EAS.
2\. The EES sends ACR management event notification to the EAS. The EES
includes the ACR management event notification information of the UE(s) and
optionally the timestamp. If the event triggering the notification is DNAI
change, the timestamp can be included to indicate the age of the user plane
path management event notification information. The EES may only provide part
of information included in the user plane path management event notification
from 3GPP network (e.g. target DNAI). If the EAS had provided \"Indication of
EAS acknowledgement\", the EES waits for acknowledgement from the EAS before
it sends AF acknowledgement to the 3GPP core network.
> If the event is \"ACT start/stop\", the notification shall include the
> endpoint address of the other EAS and the UE ID.
3\. If the EAS had included Indication of EAS Acknowledgement within ACR path
management event subscribe request described in clause 8.6.3.2.1, the EAS
sends EAS Acknowledgement as a response to ACR management event notification
to the EES either immediately or after the required ACT is completed. The EAS
may reply in negative, e.g., the EAS may determine not to perform ACR. Then,
the EES sends the AF acknowledgement to the 3GPP core network.
##### 8.6.3.2.4 Subscription update
Figure 8.6.3.2.4-1 illustrates the subscription update operation between the
EAS and the EES for ACR management event notifications.
Figure 8.6.3.2.4-1: ACR management event API: Subscription update operation
1\. The EAS sends ACR management event subscription update request to update
an existing subscription. The subscription update request may include Event
ID, Event Filter, Event Report, Subscription Type (Early and/or Late
notification defined in clause 5.6.7 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]) and/or Indication
of EAS Acknowledgement.
2\. The EES checks if the EAS is authorized for the operation.
> If authorized and if the subscription in step 1 includes only \"ACT
> start/stop\" event, the EES stores the updated subscription related to the
> EAS and step 3 is skipped.
>
> If authorized, and if the subscription in step 1 includes at least one of
> the \"user plane path change\", \"ACR monitoring\" and \"ACR facilitation\"
> events, the EES checks if there exists a subscription with the 3GPP core
> network for the user plane path management event notifications corresponding
> to the updated information obtained in step 1 as described in 3GPP TS 23.501
> [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], which may be triggered by other EAS for the same
> UE.
a. if a subscription with 3GPP core network does not exist corresponding to
the updated information, then the EES subscribes with the 3GPP core network
(PCF, NEF or SCEF+NEF) for the user plane path management event notifications
of the UE as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] If the EAS
provides Subscription Type and/or Indication of EAS Acknowledgement, the EES
includes the type of subscription and/or the indication of \"AF
acknowledgement to be expected\" as information on AF subscription to
corresponding SMF events within the AF Request;
b. if a subscription with 3GPP core network exists corresponding to the
updated information, then the EES uses the locally cached user plane path
management event notification information of the UE to respond to the EAS.
> The EES stores the updated subscription related to the EAS.
3\. The EES may update the subscription to the UE expected behaviour
analytics.
4\. The EES responds with ACR management event subscription response.
##### 8.6.3.2.5 Unsubscribe
Figure 8.6.3.2.5-1 illustrates the unsubscribe operation between the EAS and
the EES for ACR management event notifications.
Figure 8.6.3.2.5-1: ACR management event API: Unsubscribe operation
1\. The EAS sends ACR management event unsubscribe request to the EES to
cancel the ACR management event subscription.
2\. The EES checks if another EAS requires to track the UE\'s user plane path
change or not. If not, the EES unsubscribes the user plane path management
event notifications from the 3GPP core network for the corresponding UE.
3\. The EES unsubscribes from the UE expected behaviour analytics, if
applicable.
4\. The EES checks if the EAS is authorized for the operation. If authorized,
the EES removes the subscription related to the EAS and sends ACR management
event unsubscribe response to the EAS.
#### 8.6.3.3 Information flows

### 8.6.4 AC information exposure API
#### 8.6.4.1 General
AC information exposure enables EASs to obtain information about capabilities
of ACs from the EESs. This information may facilitate communications between
EASs and ACs, e.g. push notifications. The information shared is subject to
access control as well as privacy and security mechanisms.
#### 8.6.4.2 Procedures
##### 8.6.4.2.1 General
##### 8.6.4.2.2 Subscribe
Figure 8.6.4.2.2-1 illustrates the AC information subscription procedure
between the EAS and the EES.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EAS is registered with the EES; and
2\. The AC Profiles of the ACs on the UE are available at the EEC on the UE.
Figure 8.6.4.2.2-1: AC information subscription
1\. The EAS sends an AC information subscription request to the EES. The
request may contain filters to retrieve information about particular ACs e.g.
AC profile parameters or parameter ranges to be matched, specific UE
Identifiers, location ranges, etc.
NOTE: The trigger conditions of the AC information API (e.g. resource load
predictive analytics) are up to service logic, which is out of scope of this
specification.
2\. Upon receiving the request from the EAS, the EES performs an authorization
check to verify whether the EAS has authorization to perform the operation.
The EES determines the matching AC information corresponding to the filter
provided and composes a result. The EES stores the subscription information
for future processing.
3\. The EES sends an AC information subscription response to the EAS with the
result composed in step 2.
##### 8.6.4.2.3 Notify

### 8.6.5 UE Identifier API
#### 8.6.5.1 General
EES exposes UE Identifier API to the EAS in order to provide an identifier
uniquely identifying a UE. This API is used by an EAS to obtain the identifier
of the UE if the EAS does not have it. This identifier, called UE ID, is used
by the EAS to invoke capability APIs specific to UEs over EDGE-3. The UE ID is
specific to the given EAS and it is represented as a GPSI (in the form of an
External Identifier) assigned by the 3GPP Core Network as an AF specific UE
Identifier.
#### 8.6.5.2 Procedure
Figure 8.6.5.2-1 illustrates the interactions between the EES and the EAS.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EAS is authorized to discover and to use UE Identifier API provided by
the EES.
Figure 8.6.5.2-1: UE Identifier API
1\. The EAS invokes UE Identifier API exposed by the EES.
2\. The EES uses the received user information in the step 1 (e.g. IP address)
and obtains the AF specific UE identifier by interacting with NEF as specified
in clause 4.15.10 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
3\. The EES provides the obtained AF specific UE identifier as UE ID to the
EAS.
Editor\'s note: [SA3] Whether and how user\'s consent is obtained to share the
AF specific UE identifier with a particular EAS is SA3\'s responsibility.
4\. The EAS uses the UE ID received in step 3 to invoke capability exposure
API(s) provided by the EES over EDGE-3.
#### 8.6.5.3 Information flows
##### 8.6.5.3.1 General
The following information flows are specified for UE Identifier API:

### 8.6.6 Session with QoS API
#### 8.6.6.1 General
The EES exposes the Session with QoS API to the EAS in order to support the
setup of a data session between AC and EAS with a specific QoS and the
modification of the QoS of this data session.
The Session with QoS API exposed by the EES relies on the northbound Policy
Authorization Service API exposed by the PCF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502
[3] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [12], if the EES is connected to the PCF via the N5
reference point, or on the northbound AF Session with QoS Service API exposed
by the NEF as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [12], if the
EES is connected to the PCF via an NEF.
This API supports to apply the required QoS for both ongoing session and
future session for a UE or a group of UEs.
The level of support of the Session with QoS API may change due to UE mobility
between 5GC and EPC. E.g. QoS monitoring is only applicable in 5GC. If an EES
exposes the Session with QoS API to EAS(s) for a UE, the EES monitors such
changes and provides the available information to the EAS.
Alternatively to using the API described in the following clauses, the EAS may
also act as an AF and directly access the 3GPP Core Network capabilities to
request an AF session with QoS (see clause 8.7.2). For any data session
between AC and EAS, the EAS shall use only one of these alternatives.
#### 8.6.6.2 Procedures
##### 8.6.6.2.1 General
##### 8.6.6.2.2 Create a session
Figure 8.6.6.2.2-1 illustrates the session with QoS create operation between
the EAS and the EES. It is used to request reservation of resources for a data
session between AC and EAS with a specific QoS and to subscribe to certain
session with QoS event notifications.
Figure 8.6.6.2.2-1: Session with QoS API: create operation
> 1\. The EAS requests establishment of a data session between the AC and the
> EAS with a specific QoS (either QoS reference or bandwidth). If the data
> session can adjust to different QoS parameter combinations, the request may
> include a list of alternative QoS references in a priority order. The EAS
> shall include the UE\'s IP address, UE ID or UE Group ID, the DNN and
> S-NSSAI used for the data session between AC and EAS. With the same request
> the EAS subscribes to receive certain session with QoS event notifications
> (e.g. notifications related to QoS monitoring, usage monitoring for
> sponsored data connectivity and/or QoS targets can no longer (or can again)
> be fulfilled).
2\. The EES checks if the EAS is authorized for this operation for the UE. If
authorized, then the following services of 3GPP CN may be used by the EES:
a. the EES invokes the Event Monitoring service for PDU session status with
the 3GPP Core Network, as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
b. the EES invokes the Policy Authorization Create service or the AF Session
with QoS service with the 3GPP Core Network (PCF or NEF, respectively) as
described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], providing the specific
QoS (QoS reference or bandwidth) to the PCF as described in 3GPP TS 23.503
[12], clause 6.1.3.22. Additionally, the EES may subscribe to notifications of
resource allocation outcome and to other events described in clause 6.1.3.18
of 3GPP TS 23.503 [12], e.g. notifications of when the QoS targets can no
longer (or can again) be fulfilled.
The usage of step 2a and step 2b is as follows:
\- If the request is for a group of UEs identified by the UE Group ID or for a
single UE identified by the UE ID, then EES executes step 2a. If UE (single UE
or UE group member) already has ongoing PDU session, then UE IP address is
retrieved in step 2a. Further the EES executes step 2b; otherwise the EES
waits for further notification for PDU session status in step 4.
\- If the request is for a single UE identified by the IP address, then EES
executes step 2b.
3\. If the operation in step 2 is successful, the EES responds with a Context
ID and a Result. The Context ID is to be used by the EAS for further requests
(e.g. session with QoS update requests) pertaining to the same UE. If the EAS
is not authorized or any other failure happens during the operation, the EES
provides a rejection response with cause information.
4\. When the EES receives the corresponding UE IP address for the single UE or
UE group member from the PDU session status notification sent by the 3GPP Core
Network, the EES requests data session with specific QoS as described in step
2b.
NOTE: The EES will report the resource allocation outcome, e.g. the successful
allocation of the Service Data Flow(s) related to the data session, with a
separate session with QoS notify operation (see TS 23.503 [12], clause
6.1.3.18).
##### 8.6.6.2.3 Update a session
Figure 8.6.6.2.3-1 illustrates the session with QoS update request operation
between the EAS and the EES. It is used to request a modification of the QoS
of the data session between AC and EAS.
Figure 8.6.6.2.3-1: Session with QoS API: update operation
1\. The EAS requests a modification of the QoS of the data session between the
AC and the EAS, e.g. by including a different QoS reference or different
bandwidth value. The EAS shall include the Context ID.
The EAS may also request a modification of the event monitoring by subscribing
to new events and updating or removing subscriptions to existing events.
2\. The EES checks if there is a context for the Context ID available and
whether the EAS is authorized for this operation. If yes and the UE IP address
is known by the EES, the EES invokes the Policy Authorization Update service
or AF Session with QoS Update service with the 3GPP Core Network (PCF or NEF,
respectively) as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3],
providing the updated information to the PCF or NEF, respectively. The EES may
subscribe to additional events or unsubscribe to certain events, if necessary.
3\. If the operation is successful, the EES responds with a Context ID and a
Result. If the EAS is not authorized or any other failure happens during the
operation, the EES provides a rejection response with cause information.
NOTE: The EES will report the resource allocation outcome, e.g. the successful
modification of the Service Data Flow(s) related to the data session, with a
separate session with QoS notify operation (see 3GPP TS 23.503 [12], clause
6.1.3.18).
##### 8.6.6.2.4 Revoke a session
Figure 8.6.6.2.4-1 illustrates the session with QoS revoke operation between
the EAS and the EES. It is used to revoke the data session between AC and EAS
with a specific QoS and to unsubscribe to the related session with QoS event
notifications.
Figure 8.6.6.2.4-1: Session with QoS API: revoke operation
1\. The EAS requests a revoke of the data session with QoS between the AC and
the EAS. The EAS shall include the Context ID.
2\. The EES checks if there is a context for the Context ID available and
whether the EAS is authorized for this operation. If yes, then the EES
unsubscribes from the PDU session status monitoring (if applicable) and
invokes the Policy Authorization Delete service or AF Session with QoS Revoke
service with the 3GPP Core Network (PCF or NEF, respectively) as described in
3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]. This deletes the application
session context at the PCF or NEF and removes the subscription to any session
with QoS event notifications.
3\. If the operation is successful, the EES responds with a Context ID and a
Result. If the EAS is not authorized or any other failure happens during the
operation, the EES provides a rejection response with cause information.
##### 8.6.6.2.5 Notify
Figure 8.6.6.2.5-1 illustrates the notify operation between the EES and the
EAS for session with QoS event notifications.
Figure 8.6.6.2.5-1: Session with QoS API: notify operation
1\. The EES detects a user plane event associated with the established session
(i.e. it receives a Policy Authorization Notify operation from the PCC or an
AF Session with QoS Notify operation from the NEF as described in 3GPP TS
23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]). The EES determines to notify the session
with QoS event notification information (e.g., resource allocation outcome or
information that the QoS targets can no longer (or can again) be fulfilled) to
the EASs which have subscribed to the session with QoS event notification.
2\. The EES sends a session with QoS event notification to the EAS. The EES
includes the session with QoS event notification information of the UE.
#### 8.6.6.3 Information flows
##### 8.6.6.3.1 General
The following information flows are specified for Session with QoS API:
\- Session with QoS create request and response;
\- Session with QoS update request and response;
\- Session with QoS revoke request and response; and
\- Session with QoS event notification.

## 8.7 Network capability exposure to EAS
### 8.7.1 General
The network capability exposure to EAS(s) depends on the deployment scenarios
and the business relationship of the ASP/ECSP with the PLMN operator. The
following mechanisms are supported:
\- Direct network capability exposure.
\- Network capability exposure via EES.
### 8.7.2 Direct network capability exposure
The EAS(s) (acting as trusted or untrusted AF) may directly access the 3GPP
Core Network capabilities as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS
23.682 [17].
### 8.7.3 Network capability exposure via EES
The EES may re-expose the network capabilities of the 3GPP core network to the
EAS(s) as per the CAPIF architecture specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].
Depending on the deployment models (centralized or distributed) employed,
\- the EES assumes the role of the API exposing function (may also acts as the
API topology hiding entry) as described in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6]; and
\- the EAS assumes the role of an API invoker.
If CAPIF is supported, the EAS interacts with the CAPIF core function and the
EES. The EES may further interact with 3GPP northbound service API provider
(e.g. SCEF/NEF/SCEF+NEF) or directly with 3GPP core network entities (e.g.
PCF) to satisfy the service API invocation requests from the EASs.
The EES may expose the network capabilities of the 3GPP Core Networks to the
EAS(s) by supporting the functionalities of 3GPP northbound service API
provider (e.g. SCEF, NEF, SCEF+NEF).
NOTE: Details of how to select a proper 3GPP network exposure function (e.g.
selecting NEF, SCEF, or SCEF+NEF) for the UE(s) is outside scope of this
specification.
## 8.8 Service continuity
### 8.8.1 General
#### 8.8.1.1 High level overview
When a UE moves to a new location, different EASs can be more suitable for
serving the ACs in the UE. Such transitions can result from a non-mobility
event also, requiring support from the enabling layer to maintain the
continuity of the service.
This clause describes the features that support service continuity for ACs in
the UE to minimize service interruption while replacing the S-EAS, with a
T-EAS.
Generally, one AC on the UE has one associated application context at the
S-EAS. To support service continuity, this application context is transferred
from the S-EAS to a T-EAS.
The capabilities for supporting service continuity provided at the Edge
Enabler Layer may consider various application layer scenarios in which there
may be involvement of AC and one or more EAS(s).
Following intra-EDN, inter-EDN and LADN (overlapping LADN service areas)
related scenarios are supported for service continuity:
\- UE mobility, including predictive or expected UE mobility;
\- Overload situations in S-EAS or EDN; and
\- Maintenance aspects such as graceful shutdown of an EAS.
NOTE 1: The scenarios which require ACR for service continuity, cannot use
non-overlapping LADNs.
To support the need of ACR, following entity roles are identified:
\- detection entity, detecting or predicting the need of ACR;
\- decision-making entity, deciding that the ACR is required; and
\- execution entity, executing ACR.
A detection entity detects the probable need for ACR by monitoring various
aspects, such as UE\'s location or predicted/expected UE location and
indicates to the decision-making entity to determine if the ACR is required.
The EEC, EES and EAS can potentially perform the detection role:
A decision-making entity determines that ACR is required and instructs the
execution entity to perform ACR.
An execution entity performs ACR as and when instructed by the decision-making
entity.
NOTE 2: After a decision that another EAS is to serve the UE, the S-EAS can
decide if the existing Application Context is transferred to the new EAS.
The EAS may utilize the following capabilities provided by the EES for
supporting service continuity at the application layer:
\- Subscribe to service continuity related events and receive corresponding
notifications;
\- Discover the T-EAS; and
\- ACR from a S-EAS to a T-EAS.
The EES can utilize the following capabilities provided by the ECS for
supporting service continuity at the application layer:
\- Retrieve the T-EES.
The EEC may determine if the ACR is required by detecting that the UE moved or
is predicted or expected to move outside the service area (see clause 7.3.3).
The service area can be provided to the EEC by either the ECS during Service
Provisioning or EES during EAS Discovery. For the PDU Session of SSC mode 3,
if the UE receives PDU Session Modification Command as specified in clause
4.3.5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], the EEC may determine that the ACR is required.
For IPv6 multi-homed PDU Session of SSC mode 3, the EEC may determine that ACR
is required if the UE is notified of the existence and availability of a new
IPv6 prefix as specified in clause 4.3.5.3 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 3: For IPv6 multi-homed PDU Session of SSC mode 3, the EEC can be aware
of the notification about the IPv6 prefix configuration due to change of PSA
UPF based on the UE implementation.
After successful ACR:
\- The EES is informed of the completion by the EAS; and
\- The EEC is informed of the completion by the EES.
In general, a number of steps are required in order to perform ACR. The
potential roles of an edge enablement layer in ACR include:
\- providing detection events;
\- selecting the T-EAS(s); and
\- supporting the transfer of the application context from the S-EAS(s) to the
T-EAS(s).
If the UE is connected to the 5GC, the EES/EAS acting as AF may utilize AF
traffic influence functionality from the 3GPP CN as specified in 3GPP TS
23.502 [3].
A high level overview of ACR is illustrated in Figure 8.8.1.1-1.
Figure 8.8.1.1-1: High level overview of ACR
ACR can be performed for service continuity planning, which means that the
first three steps in Figure 8.8.1.1-1 detection, decision and execution, are
performed as defined in clause 8.8.1.2, e.g. when the UE is predicted to move
outside the service area of the serving EAS. In such a case the T-EAS is to
service the UE when it moves to the expected location.
EES can handle multiple ACR requests simultaneously. When there are multiple
simultaneous ACR, the ACR shall be uniquely identified by ACID, EEC ID (or UE
ID), S-EAS endpoint and T-EAS endpoint.
#### 8.8.1.2 ACR with service continuity planning
Service continuity planning is an Edge Enabler Layer value-add feature of
providing support for seamless service continuity, when information about
planned, projected, or anticipated behaviour is available at EESs or provided
by EECs.
To implement this functionality an EES may utilize:
\- information provided by the EEC e.g., AC Schedule, Expected AC Geographical
Service Area, Expected Service KPIs, Preferred ECSP list; and
\- 3GPP core network capabilities utilized by EES as described in clause
8.10.3.
In service continuity planning, the Application Context may be duplicated and
sent from the Sâ€‘EAS to the Tâ€‘EAS before the UE moves to the expected location.
In this case, the Application Contexts in Sâ€‘EAS and Tâ€‘EAS are synchronized
when the Application Context is updated until the AC connects to the T-EAS.
NOTE 1: The information elements of the Application Context and how the
Application Context is synchronized between the Sâ€‘EAS and the Tâ€‘EAS is up to
implementation of the application.
NOTE 2: In the case of EELManagedACR, the Application Context synchronization
is accomplished using the same mechanism as when transferring the context from
the Sâ€‘EES to the Tâ€‘EES.
For additional details on service continuity planning for ACR, see clauses
8.8.2.2, 8.8.2.3, 8.8.2.4, 8.8.2.5 and 8.8.2.6.
#### 8.8.1.3 Unused contexts handling during ACR including service continuity
planning
The interval between ACT initiation and ACR status update message from EAS to
EES (i.e. taking the context into use) can be significant (e.g. in the
predicted case). During this interval, the following events are possible:
a) The UE remains communicating with the S-EAS, e.g. the UE does not move to
the service area of the T-EAS; or
b) The UE moves to a service area served by a different T-EAS (other than the
T-EAS towards which the ACR was initiated).
For the ACRs initiated by the EEC, in case of events a) and b) the EEC should
re-send an ACR request with the information of the current ACR and the updated
information as described in clause 8.8.3.4 and defined in clause 8.8.4.4. For
a) if the action is initiation the EEC sets T-EAS endpoint under ACR
initiation action to indicate the S-EAS. For b) if the action is initiation
the UE sets T-EAS endpoint under ACR initiation action to the new T-EAS.
NOTE: Timeouts if required for discarding unused contexts for ACR scenarios
can be specified in stage 3.
### 8.8.2 Scenarios
#### 8.8.2.1 General
ACR functionality can be implemented flexibly, and may be focused either in
the EEC or in the EAS/EES. The scenarios in this clause are different with
regards to
a) whether the EEC is involved in the detection phase and decision phase or
detection and decision involve the S-EAS or S-EES only;
b) whether T-EAS discovery is performed between EEC and T-EES or between S-EES
and T-EES;
c) whether the EEC sends an Application Context Relocation Request towards the
S-EES, the T-EES or none at all; and
d) whether the Application Context is pushed from the S-EAS to the T-EAS or
pulled by the T-EAS from S-EAS.
Generally, AC, EEC, EES and EAS implementations will support only a subset of
these scenarios; therefore, during EAS discovery and T-EAS discovery the S-EES
and T-EES shall take the ACR scenarios supported by the AC and EEC and any
preferences indicated by the EEC for specific ACR scenarios into account when
identifying the EAS(s) for the EAS discovery response, as specified in clause
8.5.2.2 and clause 8.8.3.2, or for the EAS discovery notification, as
specified in clause 8.5.2.3.3.
Furthermore, when the EEC performs EAS discovery or T-EAS discovery, the EES
or T-EES shall inform the EEC about the ACR scenarios which are supported by
the EAS or T-EAS, respectively.
The EEC shall take the information about supported ACR scenarios provided by
the ECS, S-EES and T-EES into account when selecting an EES for EAS discovery
or T-EAS discovery, respectively, and when selecting an EAS for edge services.
For clarity of description, scenarios in clauses 8.8.2.2, 8.8.2.3, 8.8.2.4,
8.8.2.5 and 8.8.2.6 describe the relocation of a single application context to
a new EAS. Multiple ACs can be active in the UE and relocation can be executed
for each AC (or group of ACs) that requires service continuity.
For each of the scenarios in clauses 8.8.2.2, 8.8.2.3, 8.8.2.4, 8.8.2.5 and
8.8.2.6, ACR for one or more ACs can result in the same EEC receiving services
from more than one EES, which have the registration for the required EASs that
can serve the ACs. In scenarios described in clause 8.8.2.4 and clause
8.8.2.5, a successful EEC context relocation procedure enables the EEC to
become implicitly registered to the target EES without the EEC sending an EEC
registration request.
Editor\'s note: whether the scenarios are overlapping and how to solve any co-
existence issues are FFS.
#### 8.8.2.2 Initiation by EEC using regular EAS Discovery
In this scenario, ACR is a result of the UE moving to, or the UE expecting to
move to, a new location which is outside the service area of the serving EAS.
The EEC is triggered as a result of the UE\'s movement as described in
8.8.1.1.
This scenario is based on Service Provisioning (as specified in clause 8.3)
and EAS Discovery (as specified in clause 8.5) procedures to discover the
T-EES and EAS that shall serve the AC as a result of the UE\'s new location,
and that shall receive the Application Context from the serving EAS.
This scenario relies on an interface between the EEC and AC over EDGE-5, which
is out of the scope of this specification.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The AC in the UE already has a connection to a corresponding S-EAS;
2\. The preconditions listed in clause 8.3.3.2.2 with regards to the EEC are
fulfilled; and
3\. The EEC is triggered when it obtains the UE\'s new location or is
triggered by another entity such as an ECS notification
NOTE 1: This scenario is applicable only for an Edge-aware AC and EAS.
Figure 8.8.2.2-1: ACR initiated by the EEC and AC
Phase I: ACR Detection
1\. The EEC detects the UE location update as a result of a UE mobility event
and is provided with the UE\'s new location as described in clause 8.8.1.1.
The EEC can also detect an expected or predicted UE location in the future as
described in clause 8.8.1.1.
NOTE 2: If the EEC is triggered by an external entity such as by a
notification from the ECS, a list of new EESs (to be used as T-EESs) is
provided by that notification and step 3 below is skipped.
Phase II: ACR Decision
2\. Either the AC or the EEC makes the decision to perform the ACR.
NOTE 3: Which applications require ACR can be decided based on the application
profile, e.g. requirement of service continuity of the application.
> If the change in UE\'s location does not trigger a need to change the
> serving EAS, steps 3. onwards are skipped. The EEC remains connected to the
> serving EES(s) and the AC remains connected to its corresponding serving
> EAS.
Phase III: ACR Execution
3\. The EEC performs Service Provisioning (as specified in clause 8.3) for all
active applications that require ACR. Since the location of the UE has
changed, the Service Provisioning procedure results in a list of T-EESs that
are relevant to the supplied applications and the new location of the UE. When
in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, then the
Connectivity information and UE Location in the Service Provisioning procedure
(as specified in clause 8.3) contains the expected Connectivity information
and expected UE Location.
4\. The EEC performs EAS discovery (as specified in clause 8.5) for the
desired T-EASs by querying the T-EESs that were established in step 3 (or
provided in the notification from the ECS -- if it was the trigger). If EEC
registration configuration for the EESs established in step 2 indicates that
EEC registration is required, the EEC performs EEC registration with the EESs
(as specified in clause 8.4.2.2.2) before sending the EAS discovery request.
Step 5 is skipped if EAS discovery procedure results in only one discovered
T-EAS.
5\. The AC and EEC select the T-EAS to be used for the application traffic.
NOTE 4: Several EEC registrations with different EESs may result from T-EAS
discovery process during a single ACR operation.
6\. The EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4)
to the S-EES with the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the
corresponding ACR initiation data (without the need to notify the EAS). The
S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of
the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable), as described in clause
8.8.3.4. If the EEC has not subscribed to receive ACR information
notifications for ACR complete events from the S-EES, the EEC subscribes for
the notifications as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2.
> 7\. If the T-EES is different than the S-EES and the EEC Context at the
> S-EES is not stale, the S-EES initiates EEC Context Push relocation with the
> T-EES as described in clause 8.9.2.3. Otherwise, if the T-EES is the same as
> the S-EES, EEC Context Push relocation is skipped.
8\. The AC is triggered by the EEC to start ACT. The AC decides to initiate
the transfer of application context from the S-EAS to the T-EAS. There may be
different ways of transferring context and they are all outside the scope of
this specification.
When in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning has been triggered, the
AC connects to the T-EAS when the UE moves to the predicted location.
Otherwise, the rest of this step is skipped.
After the ACT is completed, the AC remains connected to the T-EAS and
disconnects from the S-EAS; the EEC is informed of the completion.
NOTE 5: Whether and how the AC initiates the ACT is out of scope of the
present document
> When in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning,
> if the UE does not move to the expected/predicted location the EEC does not
> connect to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.
NOTE 6: The S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the
T-EAS can discard the application context based on information received from
EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to
the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether and how to make such a
decision.
> NOTE 7: It is out of scope of this specification how the AC informs the
> S-EAS and T-EAS that ACT was part of service continuity planning. When in
> step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, the S-EAS and
> the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted location before they
> perform the Post ACR Clean up steps 9 and 10. When the S-EAS and the T-EAS
> do not wait for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to the predicted
> location), the S-EAS and the T-EAS can perform the Post ACR Clean up with
> failure messages.
Phase IV: Post-ACR Clean up
9\. The S-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the S-EES as specified in
clause 8.8.3.8.
10\. The T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as specified
in clause 8.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT, and that the EEC
Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed, then the T-EES
indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status update response.
NOTE 8: If the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates failure,
then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at the T-EES.
NOTE 9: Steps 9 and 10 can occur in any order.
11\. If the status in step 9 indicates a successful ACT, the S-EES sends the
ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC to confirm that
the ACR has completed as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.3. If the EEC Context
relocation procedure was attempted, then the notification includes EEC context
relocation status IE, indicating the result of the EEC context relocation
procedure. If the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context
relocation was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1
operations such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.
#### 8.8.2.3 EEC executed ACR via S-EES
In this scenario, the EEC is triggered as a result of the UE\'s movement as
described in 8.8.1.1. Figure 8.8.2.3-1 illustrates the EEC executing ACR via
the S-EES.
Pre-condition:
1\. The AC at the UE already has a connection to the S-EAS; and
2\. The EEC is able to communicate with the S-EES.
Figure 8.8.2.3-1: EEC executed ACR
Phase I: ACR Detection
1\. The EEC detects that ACR may be required as described in clause 8.8.1.1.
The EEC may detect that ACR may be required for an expected or predicted UE
location in the future as described in clause 8.8.1.1.
Phase II: ACR Decision
2\. The EEC decides to proceed required procedures for triggering ACR.
Phase III: ACR Execution
3\. The EEC determines the T-EES by using the provisioned information or
performing service provisioning procedure per clause 8.3 of the present
document. When in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered,
then the Connectivity information and UE Location in the Service Provisioning
(as specified in clause 8.3) procedure contains the expected Connectivity
information and expected UE Location. If the UE is within the service area of
the T-EES, upon selecting T-EES the UE may need to establish a new PDU
connection to the target EDN. If EEC registration configuration for the T-EES
indicates that EEC registration is required, the EEC performs EEC registration
with the selected T-EES as specified in clause 8.4.2.2.2. The EEC can then
discover and select T-EAS by performing EAS Discovery with the T-EES per
clause 8.5.2 of the present document.
NOTE 1: Several EEC registrations with different EESs may result from T-EAS
discovery process during a single ACR operation.
4\. The EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4)
to the S-EES with the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the
corresponding ACR initiation data (with the need to notify the EAS). The S-EES
authorises the request from the EEC. The S-EES decides to execute ACR based on
the information received from the EEC, EEC context and/or EAS profile. The
S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information of
the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable) and sends the ACR
management notification for the \"ACT start\" event to the S-EAS, as described
in clause 8.6.3, to initiate ACT between the S-EAS and the T-EAS. If the EEC
has not subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for ACR complete
events from the S-EES, the EEC subscribes for the notifications as described
in clause 8.8.3.5.2.
> 5\. If the T-EES is different than the S-EES and the EEC Context at the
> S-EES is not stale, the S-EES initiates EEC Context Push relocation with the
> T-EES as described in clause 8.9.2.3. Otherwise, if the T-EES is the same as
> the S-EES, EEC Context Push relocation is skipped.
6\. The S-EAS transfers the application context to the T-EAS at implementation
specific time. This process is out of scope of the present specification.
> When in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning,
> if the UE does not move to the predicted location, the EEC does not connect
> to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.
NOTE 2: The S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the
T-EAS can discard the application context based on information received from
EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to
the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether and how to make such a
decision.
NOTE 3: When in step 1 the ACR for service continuity planning is triggered,
the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted location
before they perform the Post ACR Clean up steps 7 and 8\. When the S-EAS and
the T-EAS do not wait for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to the
predicted location), the S-EAS and the T-EAS can perform the Post ACR Clean up
with failure messages.
Phase IV: Post-ACR Clean up
7\. The S-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the S-EES as specified in
clause 8.8.3.8.
8\. The T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as specified in
clause 8.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT, and that the EEC
Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed, then the T-EES
indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status update response.
NOTE 4: If the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates failure,
then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at the T-EES.
NOTE 5: Steps 7 and 8 can occur in any order.
9\. If the status in step 7 indicates a successful ACT, the S-EES sends the
ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC to confirm that
the ACR has completed as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.3. If the EEC Context
relocation procedure was attempted, then the notification includes EEC context
relocation status IE, indicating the result of the EEC context relocation
procedure. If the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context
relocation was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1
operations such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.
#### 8.8.2.4 S-EAS decided ACR scenario
In this scenario, the S-EAS may detect the need of ACR locally or is notified
by the S-EES via ACR management notifications or UE location notifications.
The S-EAS make the decision about whether to perform the ACR, and starts the
ACR at a proper time.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The S-EAS may depend on the receipt ACR management events from the S-EES,
e.g. \"user plane path change\" events or \"ACR monitoring\" events as
described in clause 8.6.3, to detect the need for an ACR. The S-EAS may also
depend on the receipt of UE location notification from the S-EES as described
in clause 8.6.2.2.3, to detect the need for an ACR. For the following
procedure it is assumed that the S-EAS has subscribed to continuously receive
the respective events from the S-EES; and
2\. The EEC has subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for target
information notification events and ACR complete events from the S-EES, as
described in clause 8.8.3.5.2.
Figure 8.8.2.4-1: S-EAS decided ACR
S-EAS decided ACR is outlined with four main phases: detection, decision,
execution and clean up.
Phase I: ACR Detection
1\. The S-EAS either receives ACR management notifications from source Edge
Enabler Sever indicating that ACR may be required (\"ACR monitoring\" event),
or self detects the need for ACR (e.g. upon receipt of a \"user plane path
change\" event or UE location notification). If the ACR management
notification indicates \"ACR monitoring\" event, then the notification will
also contain the T-EAS information (see clause 8.6.3.2.3). The S-EAS may
detect that ACR may be required for an expected or predicted UE location in
the future as described in clause 8.8.1.1.
NOTE 1: How the S-EAS self detects the local need for ACR is outside the scope
of this specification. The ASP can have service agreement with ECSP regarding
which EES API to use for ACR detection.
Phase II: ACR Decision
2\. The S-EAS makes the decision to perform the ACR
NOTE 2: How the S-EAS determines when to start the ACR is outside the scope of
this specification.
Phase III: ACR Execution
3\. The S-EAS discovers the T-EAS as described in clause 8.8.3.2. When in step
1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning, then UE Location
and Target DNAI values in the Retrieve T-EES procedure contain the expected UE
Location and expected Target DNAI. After S-EAS determines the T-EAS to use,
the S-EAS may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information
of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable).
> 4\. The S-EAS sends selected T-EAS declaration message to S-EES, to inform
> S-EES the determined T-EAS to use as described in clause 8.8.3.7.
>
> 5\. If the T-EES is different than the S-EES and the EEC Context at the
> S-EES is not stale, the S-EES initiates EEC Context Push relocation with the
> T-EES as described in clause 8.9.2.3. Otherwise, if the T-EES is the same as
> the S-EES, EEC Context Push relocation is skipped.
6\. Based on the T-EAS selection information received from the S-EAS, the
S-EES sends the target information notification to the EEC as described in
clause 8.8.3.5.3. The selected T-EES may be included in the target information
and the ACID which corresponds to the selected target EAS is included in the
notification sent to the EEC as described in clause 8.8.3.5.3.
7\. The S-EAS transfers the application context to the T-EAS selected in step
3. This process is out of scope of the present specification.
> When in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning,
> if the UE does not move to the predicted location, the EEC does not connect
> to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.
NOTE 3: The S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the
T-EAS can discard the application context based on information received from
EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to
the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether and how to make such a
decision.
NOTE 4: When in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity
planning, the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted
location before they perform the Post ACR Clean up steps 8 and 9\. When the
S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to
the predicted location), the S-EAS and the T-EAS can perform Post ACR Clean up
with failure messages.
Phase IV: Post-ACR clean up
8\. The S-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the S-EES as specified in
clause 8.8.3.8.
9\. The T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as specified in
clause 8.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT, and that the EEC
Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed, then the T-EES
indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status update response.
NOTE 5: If the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates failure,
then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at the T-EES.
NOTE 6: Steps 8 and 9 can occur in any order.
10\. If the status in step 8 indicates a successful ACT, the S-EES sends the
ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC to confirm that
the ACR has completed as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.3. If the EEC Context
relocation procedure was attempted, then the notification includes EEC context
relocation status IE, indicating the result of the EEC context relocation
procedure. If the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context
relocation was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1
operations such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.
#### 8.8.2.5 S-EES executed ACR
Figure 8.8.2.5-1 illustrates the S-EES detecting, deciding and executing ACR
from the S-EAS to the T-EAS. This may include EELManagedACR by S-EES when
initiated by S-EAS as per clause 8.8.3.6.
NOTE 1: For this clause, S-EAS either supports ACR detection capability or
performs subscription for ACR management event to EES.
Pre-condition:
1\. The AC at the UE already has a connection to the S-EAS;
2\. The EEC is able to communicate with the S-EES;
3\. The EEC has subscribed to receive ACR information notifications for target
information notification events and ACR complete events from the S-EES, as
described in clause 8.8.3.5.2;
4\. The S-EAS optionally subscribed to receive ACR management notifications
for \"ACR facilitation\" events to the S-EES, in order to enable detection at
S-EAS.
> 5\. In case of EELManagedACR, the T-EAS has subscribed to receive ACT status
> notifications as described in clause 8.8.3.6.2.3.
Figure 8.8.2.5-1: S-EES executed ACR
1\. The S-EAS may initiate EELManagedACR with S-EES as specified in clause
8.8.3.6. In this step, the S-EAS and S-EES negotiate an address of the
Application Context storage to S-EES. The S-EAS puts the Application Context
at this address which can be further accessed by the S-EES when the ACT is
required.
> In this case, the S-EES executes steps 2 (i.e., S-EES detection), 4, 5, 6,
> 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13 and 14. Rest of steps are skipped.
Phase I: ACR Detection
2\. Detection entities (S-EAS, S-EES, EEC) detect that ACR may be required as
described in clause 8.8.1.1. The detection by the S-EES may be triggered by
the User Plane path change notification received from the 3GPP Core Network
due to S-EAS request for \"ACR facilitation\" event (see clause 8.6.3) or due
to step 1.
> The detection entity may detect that ACR may be required for an expected or
> predicted UE location in the future as described in clause 8.8.1.1.
Phase II: ACR Decision
3\. The detection entity performs ACR launching procedure (as described in
clause 8.8.3.4) with the ACR action indicating ACR determination and the
corresponding ACR determination data.
4\. The S-EES authorises the message if received. The S-EES decides to execute
ACR based on the information received or local detection, and the information
of EEC context or EAS profile, and then proceed the below steps.
Phase III: ACR Execution
5\. The S-EES determines T-EES and T-EAS via the Discover T-EAS procedure in
clause 8.8.3.2 of the present document. When in step 2 the ACR has been
triggered for service continuity planning, then UE Location and Target DNAI
values provided in the Retrieve T-EES procedure contain the expected UE
Location and expected Target DNAI. The S-EES may decide not to perform ACR if
T-EAS is not available.
> 6\. If the T-EES is different than the S-EES and the EEC Context at the
> S-EES is not stale, the S-EES initiates EEC Context Push relocation with the
> T-EES as described in clause 8.9.2.3. Otherwise, if the T-EES is the same as
> the S-EES, EEC Context Push relocation is skipped.
7\. The S-EES sends the target information notification to the EEC as
described in clause 8.8.3.5.3.
8\. The S-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing
information of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable).
9\. The S-EES sends the ACR management notification (e.g. as notification for
\"ACR facilitation\" event or \"ACT start\" event as described in clause 8.6.3
or due to step 1) to the S-EAS to initiate ACT between the S-EAS and the
T-EAS.
10\. The Application Context is transferred from S-EAS to the T-EAS at
implementation specific time. In the case of EELManagedACR, the S-EES accesses
the Application Context from the address as per step 1 and the S-EES and T-EES
engage in the ACT from S-EAS to the T-EAS (obtained as per step 5) in a secure
way. Further the T-EAS accesses the Application Context made available by the
T-EES. If S-EAS performs the ACT directly with T-EAS, the specification of
such process is out of scope of the present document.
NOTE 2: The Application Context is encrypted and protected by the application
layer. The S-EES and the T-EES engage in the packet level transport of the
Application Context and they have no visibility to the content of the
Application Context.
> When in step 2 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning,
> if the UE does not move to the predicted location, the EEC does not connect
> to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS.
NOTE 3: The S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the
T-EAS can discard the application context based on information received from
EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to
the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether and how to make such a
decision.
NOTE 4: When in step 2 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity
planning, the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted
location before they perform the Post ACR Clean up steps 12 and 13. When the
S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to
the predicted location), the S-EAS and the T-EAS can perform Post ACR Clean up
with failure messages.
Phase IV: Post-ACR Clean up
11\. In case of EELManagedACR, once the ACT is successful, the T-EES sends an
ACT status notification to the T-EAS as described in clause 8.8.3.6.2.4,
indicating that the Application Context is available.
12\. The S-EAS sends the ACT status update message to the S-EES as specified
in clause 8.8.3.8.
13\. The T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as specified
in clause 8.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT, and that the EEC
Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed, then the T-EES
indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status update response.
NOTE 5: If the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates failure,
then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at the T-EES.
NOTE 6: Steps 12 and 13 can occur in any order.
14\. If the status in step 12 indicates a successful ACT, the S-EES sends the
ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to the EEC to confirm that
the ACR has completed as specified in clause 8.8.3.5.3. If the EEC Context
relocation procedure was attempted, then the notification includes EEC context
relocation status IE, indicating the result of the EEC context relocation
procedure. If the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context
relocation was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1
operations such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.
NOTE 7: The Application Client mechanism to support switchover of the
application traffic to T-EAS is out of scope of the specification.
#### 8.8.2.6 EEC executed ACR via T-EES
In this scenario, the EEC is triggered as a result of the UE\'s movement as
described in 8.8.1.1. Figure 8.8.2.6-1 illustrates the EEC executing ACR via
the T-EES.
Pre-condition:
1\. The EEC has the S-EAS information that serves the AC.
Figure 8.8.2.6-1: EEC executed ACR via T-EES
Phase I: ACR Detection
1\. The EEC detects that ACR may be required as described in clause 8.8.1.1.
The EEC may detect that ACR may be required for an expected or predicted UE
location in the future as described in clause 8.8.1.1.
Phase II: ACR Decision
2\. The EEC decides to proceed with required procedures for ACR.
NOTE 1: If supported, the AC can be involved in the decision. It is out of
scope of the present document how the AC is involved.
Phase III: ACR Execution
3\. The EEC determines the T-EES by using the provisioned information or
performing service provisioning procedure per clause 8.3. When in step 1 the
ACR for service continuity planning is triggered, then the Connectivity
information and UE Location used in the service provisioning procedure contain
the expected Connectivity information and expected UE Location. If the UE is
within the service area of the T-EES, upon selecting the T-EES the UE may need
to establish a new PDU connection to the target EDN. If EEC registration
configuration for the T-EES indicates that EEC registration is required, the
EEC performs registration with the selected T-EES as specified in clause
8.4.2.2.2. The EEC performs EAS Discovery with the T-EES per clause 8.5.2.
NOTE 2: Several EEC registrations with different EESs may result from T-EAS
discovery process during a single ACR operation.
4\. The EEC performs ACR launching procedure (as described in clause 8.8.3.4)
to the T-EES with the ACR action indicating ACR initiation and the
corresponding ACR initiation data (with the need to notify the EAS). If the
received ACR initiation request contains an EEC context ID and the S-EES
Endpoint, the T-EES performs an EEC Context Pull relocation (clause 8.9.2.2).
The T-EES may apply the AF traffic influence with the N6 routing information
of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core Network (if applicable). Then the T-EES sends
the ACR management notification with \"ACT start\" event message to the T-EAS.
The EEC also subscribes to receive ACR information notifications for ACR
complete events from the T-EES, as described in clause 8.8.3.5.2.
5\. The T-EAS initiates ACT between the S-EAS and the T-EAS. This process is
out of scope of the present specification.
> When in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity planning,
> if the UE does not move to the predicted location the EEC does not connect
> to T-EES, the AC does not connect to the T-EAS. Post-ACR Clean up is
> skipped.
NOTE 3: The S-EAS or T-EAS can further decide to terminate the ACR, and the
T-EAS can discard the application context based on information received from
EEL and/or other methods (e.g. monitoring the location of the UE). It is up to
the implementation of the S-EAS and T-EAS whether and how to make such a
decision.
NOTE 4: When in step 1 the ACR has been triggered for service continuity
planning, the S-EAS and the T-EAS can wait for the UE to move to the predicted
location before the T-EAS performs the Post ACR Clean up step 6\. When the
S-EAS and the T-EAS do not wait for the UE (e.g., if the UE does not move to
the predicted location), the T-EAS can perform Post ACR Clean up with failure
messages.
Phase IV: Post-ACR clean up
6\. The T-EAS sends the ACR status update message to the T-EES as specified in
clause 8.8.3.8. If the status indicates a successful ACT, and that the EEC
Context relocation procedure was attempted but failed, then the T-EES
indicates the failure to the T-EAS with the ACR status update response.
NOTE5: If the EDGE-3 subscription initialization result indicates failure,
then the EAS can perform the required EDGE-3 subscriptions at the T-EES.
7\. The T-EES sends the ACR information notification (ACR complete) message to
the EEC as described in clause 8.8.3.5.3. If the EEC Context relocation
procedure was attempted, then the notification includes EEC context relocation
status IE, indicating the result of the EEC context relocation procedure. If
the EEC context relocation status indicates that the EEC context relocation
was not successful, then the EEC may perform the required EDGE-1 operations
such as create subscriptions at the T-EES.
If the procedure fails after step 4, it will be terminated with an appropriate
cause in the ACR information notification to the EEC in step 7\. The EEC may
then proceed attempting to obtain services from the T-EAS discovered in step 3
without service continuity support. Alternatively, the EEC may resume the
present procedure starting with step 4 and selecting a different T-EES
discovered in step 3 with EAS service continuity support.
NOTE 6: The support of ACR between EDNs operated by different ECSPs is
dependent on business agreement between the ECSPs.
### 8.8.3 Procedures
#### 8.8.3.1 General
#### 8.8.3.2 Discover T-EAS
Figure 8.8.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure for fetching T-EAS information.
This procedure may be utilized by a S-EAS, which undertakes the transfer of
application context information to a T-EAS directly, or can be invoked by the
S-EES itself on deciding to execute ACR.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Information related to the EES is available with the S-EAS, if the
procedure is triggered by the S-EAS.
Figure 8.8.3.2-1: Discover T-EAS
1\. The S-EAS sends the EAS discovery request to the S-EES or the S-EES
decides to execute the ACR. The EAS discovery request from the S-EAS includes
the requestor identifier [EASID] along with the security credentials and
includes EAS discovery filter matching its EAS profile. If target DNAI is
available at the S-EAS via User Plane Path change event, the S-EAS provides
the S-EES with the target DNAI. The S-EAS also includes an EAS service
continuity support indicator indicating that the Sâ€‘EAS decided ACR according
to clause 8.8.2.4 is to be used for the ACR.
NOTE: The trigger condition to invoke the Discover T-EAS API is up to
application service logic, which is out of scope of this specification.
2\. If the request is received from the S-EAS, the S-EES checks whether the
requesting EAS is authorized to perform the discovery operation. If the UE
location is not known to the S-EES or provided by the S-EAS request, then the
S-EES may interact with 3GPP core network to retrieve the UE location. If the
S-EES decided to execute the ACR or when the requesting EAS is authorized, the
S-EES checks if there exists a T-EAS information (registered or cached) that
can satisfy the requesting EAS information, additional query filters and the
Expected service KPIs and the Minimum required service KPIs if received from
the EEC during the EAS discovery or from the S-EAS in step 1. If the S-EES
finds the T-EAS(s) in the cached or registered information, the flow either
continues with step 5 for the S-EAS triggered discovery or stops for the S-EES
decided ACR execution, else the S-EES retrieves the T-EES address from the ECS
as specified in clause 8.8.3.3 and continues with step 3.
3\. The S-EES invokes the EAS discovery request on the T-EES retrieved from
the ECS. The EAS discovery request includes the requestor identifier [EESID]
along with the security credentials and includes EAS discovery filter. In the
EAS discovery filter, the S-EES may include the Expected service KPIs and the
Minimum required service KPIs if received from the EEC during the EAS
discovery or from the S-EAS in step 1.
The S-EES also includes the EEC service continuity support indicator received
from the EEC during EAS discovery. If in step 1 the S-EES received an EAS
service continuity support indicator from the S-EAS, then the S-EES includes
this EAS service continuity support indicator and its own EES service
continuity support indicator indicating the ACR scenarios supported by the
EES. If in step 1 the S-EES decided to execute the ACR, the S-EES includes the
EAS service continuity support indicator received from the S-EAS during EAS
registration and includes an EES service continuity support indicator
indicating that the Sâ€‘EES executed ACR according to clause 8.8.2.5 is to be
used for the ACR.
> Upon receiving the request, the T-EES may trigger the ECSP management system
> to instantiate the T-EAS that matches with EAS discovery filter IEs (e.g.
> ACID) as in clause 8.12.
4\. The T-EES discovers the T-EAS(s) and responds with the discovered T-EAS
information to the S-EES. To filter T-EAS(s), the T-EES utilizes the discovery
filters (e.g. Expected service KPIs and the Minimum required service KPIs) and
the indications which ACR scenarios are supported by the AC, the EEC, the
S-EES and the S-EAS. The S-EES may cache the T-EAS information.
5\. If the request was received from the S-EAS, the S-EES responds to the
S-EAS with the discovered T-EAS Information.
#### 8.8.3.3 Retrieve T-EES procedure
Figure 8.8.3.3-1 illustrates the procedure for the S-EES to retrieve the T-EES
information from the ECS.
Pre-condition:
1\. The S-EES has been pre-configured with the address of the ECS; and
2\. The AC at the UE already has on-going application traffic with the S-EAS.
Figure 8.8.3.3-1: Retrieve T-EES procedure
1\. The S-EES sends the Retrieve EES request (UE location information or UE
identity, EASID of the S-EAS, target DNAI) to the ECS in order to identify the
T-EES which has an EAS available to serve the given AC in the UE.
2\. If the request contains the UE identity (e.g. GPSI) but the UE location is
not known to the ECS, then the ECS interacts with 3GPP core network to
retrieve the UE location. The ECS determines T-EES(s) as per the parameters
(e.g. EASID, target DNAI) in the request and the UE location information.
3\. The ECS sends the Retrieve EES response including the list of EDN
configuration information to the S-EES. The list of EDN configuration
information includes the EDN details with the endpoint information of T-EES(s)
as described in table 8.3.3.3.3-2.
NOTE: The Retrieve EES request initiated by the S-EES can be restricted only
to its registered ECS.
#### 8.8.3.4 ACR launching procedure
Figure 8.8.3.4-1 illustrates the ACR launching procedure by the EEC or the
Sâ€‘EAS.
If this procedure is triggered by the EEC, depending on the ACR action
indicated in the ACR request, the procedure is used for either ACR initiation
or ACR determination. This procedure of the ACR initiation can be re-sent as
described in clause 8.8.1.3.
If this procedure is triggered by the Sâ€‘EAS, the procedure is used for ACR
determination.
Pre-condition:
1\. The EEC has been authorized to communicate with the EES as specified in
clause 8.11, if the procedure is triggered by the EEC; and
2\. Information related to the Sâ€‘EES is available with the S-EAS, if the
procedure is triggered by the Sâ€‘EAS.
Figure 8.8.3.4-1: ACR launching procedure
1\. The EEC or the Sâ€‘EAS sends an ACR request message to the EES in order to
start ACR. The ACR request message includes ACR action to indicate either ACR
initiation request or ACR determination request. If the procedure is triggered
by the Sâ€‘EAS, the ACR request message is only for ACR determination.
An ACR request for ACR initiation sent by the EEC:
\- includes an indication of whether the EEC requests the EES to perform EAS
notification; and
\- provides information used by EES to perform AF traffic influence as in 3GPP
TS 23 501 [2].
> An ACR request for ACR determination sent either by the EEC or the EAS
> informs the EES that the need for ACR has been detected by the requestor.
2\. The EES checks if the requestor is authorized for this operation. If
authorized, the EES processes the request and performs the required
operations.
If the request in step 1 is for ACR initiation:
\- the EES may use information provided in the request to apply the AF traffic
influence with the N6 routing information of the T-EAS in the 3GPP Core
Network (if applicable), as described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], clause 5.6.7.1;
and
\- if the EAS notification indication in ACR initiation data is provided in
the step 1 request and the EAS has subscribed to receive such notification,
the EES shall notify the EAS indicated in the ACR initiation data about the
need to start ACR by sending an ACR management notification for the \"ACT
start\" event, as described in clause 8.6.3.
> If the request in step 1 is for ACR determination, the EES decides to
> execute ACR as described in clause 8.8.2.5.
>
> If the request in step 1 includes Previous T-EAS Endpoint:
\- if the previous EAS notification indication is provided in the step 1
request and the EAS has subscribed to receive such notification, the EES shall
notify the EAS about the cancellation of the ACR with the previous T-EAS by
sending an ACR management notification for the \"ACT stop\" event, as
described in clause 8.6.3.
\- The EAS will inform the remote EAS about application context cancellation,
which is outside the scope of this specification. The T-EAS sends the ACR
status update message to the T-EES which will include failed result with an
appropriate cause indicating the reason for the failure.
3\. The EES responds to the requestor\'s request with an ACR response message.
In case of re-sending ACR initiation, if serving EES was changed and EEC
context was relocated, the T-EES can clean up any relocated EEC context either
indicated in the re-sent ACR request for scenario described in clause 8.8.2.6
or upon reception of the ACR status update with failed result from T-EAS for
other scenarios.
#### 8.8.3.5 ACR information subscription
##### 8.8.3.5.1 General
Clause 8.8.3.5.2 and clause 8.8.3.5.3 together illustrate the ACR information
procedure based on Subscribe/Notify model.
The ACR information procedure is utilized as a building block for a part of
Post-ACR Clean up in clause 8.8.2 and Target information notification.
##### 8.8.3.5.2 Subscribe
Figure 8.8.3.5.2-1 illustrates the ACR information subscription procedure
between the EEC and the EES.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has received information (e.g. URI, IP address) related to the
EES;
2\. The EEC has received appropriate security credentials authorizing it to
communicate with the EES as specified in clause 8.11; and
3\. The EEC has optionally acquired a Notification Target Address to be used
in its subscriptions to notifications.
NOTE: How the EEC acquires the notification target address or a notification
channel URI to receive the notifications is out of scope of this release. The
notification target address can terminate at the EEC (e.g. in an IoT device)
if the deployment supports EEC reachability, or it can terminate at a push
notification service. Details of the push notification service are out of
scope of this release.
Figure 8.8.3.5.2-1: ACR information subscription
1\. The EEC sends an ACR information subscription request to the EES. The
request from EEC may include the ACIDs to indicate to the EES which ACs are
served by the EEC that need to receive ACR information via EEL.
2\. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is
authorized to subscribe ACR information about the requested EAS(s). If the
request is authorized, the EES creates and stores the subscription for ACR
information.
3\. The EES sends an ACR information subscription response to the EEC, which
includes the subscription identifier and may include the expiration time,
indicating when the subscription will automatically expire. To maintain the
subscription, the EEC shall send an ACR information subscription update
request prior to the expiration time. If an ACR information subscription
update request is not received prior to the expiration time, the EES shall
treat the EEC as implicitly unsubscribed.
##### 8.8.3.5.3 Notify
Figure 8.8.3.5.3-1 illustrates the ACR information notification procedure
between the EEC and the EES, which can be used by the EES to notify the EEC of
the following:
\- target information, i.e. the details of the selected T-EAS and, if
required, the selected T-EES, during ACR as described in clauses 8.8.2.4 and
8.8.2.5;
NOTE: The T-EAS and T-EES information can be used to determine the PDU
session(s) to provide connectivity to the T-EAS and the T-EES. If the ACR does
not require change in EES, i.e. T-EES is same as S-EES, then the T-EES
information can be skipped.
\- ACR complete events.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has subscribed with the EES for the ACR information as specified
in clause 8.8.3.5.2.
Figure 8.8.3.5.3-1: ACR information notification
1\. An event (e.g. ACR complete, or Target information notification) occurs at
the EES that satisfies trigger conditions for providing ACR information to a
subscribed EEC.
2\. The EES sends an ACR information notification to the EEC with the ACR
information determined in step 1. The ACR information notification may include
ACID to indicate the application context relocation of the AC is complete. If
the S-EES has received the successful EEC Context Push response from T-EES,
along with registration ID and the registration expiration time in the EEC
Context Push relocation procedure, then the ACR information notification
towards EEC also includes the registration ID and registration expiration time
under EEC context relocation status (for successful status).
##### 8.8.3.5.4 Subscription update
Figure 8.8.3.5.4-1 illustrates the ACR information subscription update
procedure between the EEC and the EES.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has subscribed with the EES for the ACR information as specified
in clause 8.8.3.5.2.
Figure 8.8.3.5.4-1: ACR information subscription update
1\. The EEC sends an ACR information subscription update request to the EES.
2\. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is
authorized for the operation. If authorized, the EES updates the subscription.
3\. The EES sends an ACR information subscription update response to the EEC.
##### 8.8.3.5.5 Unsubscribe
Figure 8.8.3.5.5-1 illustrates the ACR information unsubscribe procedure
between the EEC and the EES.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The EEC has subscribed with the EES for the ACR information as specified
in clause 8.8.3.5.2.
Figure 8.8.3.5.5-1: ACR information unsubscribe
1\. The EEC sends an ACR information unsubscribe request to the EES.
2\. Upon receiving the request from the EEC, the EES checks if the EEC is
authorized for the operation. If authorized, the EES terminates the
subscription of the EEC.
3\. The EES sends an ACR information unsubscribe response to the EEC.
#### 8.8.3.6 EELManagedACR procedure
##### 8.8.3.6.1 General
This clause introduces a procedure for ACR performed by the Edge Enabler
Servers.
When S-EES receives a request for EELManagedACR from S-EAS, the S-EES performs
the service operations for the service continuity including detecting the
event which may trigger the ACR, making the ACR decision, discovering the
T-EAS, accessing and transferring the Application Context to the T-EES/T-EAS,
notifying the T-EAS about the available Application Context, notifying the
3GPP network about ACR information, notifying the EEC about the T-EAS
information (as per EEC subscription).
The EELManagedACR procedure is designed as an asynchronous operation wherein
the S-EES will generate notifications (e.g. failure of any ACR related
operation) to the S-EAS while performing the ACR operations.
##### 8.8.3.6.2 Procedure
###### 8.8.3.6.2.1 General
This clause describes the procedures for S-EAS to request for EELManagedACR
and for T-EAS to subscribe for ACT status notification.
###### 8.8.3.6.2.2 ACR request
Figure 8.8.3.6.2.2-1 illustrates the procedure for EELManagedACR performed by
the Edge Enabler Servers.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Information related to the S-EES is available with the S-EAS.
2\. The T-EAS has subscribed to the ACR related event from the T-EES.
3\. The EEC has subscribed to the ACR related event from the S-EES.
Figure 8.8.3.6.2.2-1: ACR procedure
1\. The S-EAS sends an EELManagedACR service request (UE identifier, EAS
characteristics for ACR) to request the S-EES to handle all the service
operations of the ACR. The S-EAS may initiate this request with S-EES based on
different triggers (e.g. when Application Client is connecting to the S-EAS).
An address for accessing the Application Context may be provided if available,
which allows the S-EES to access the Application Context generated by the
S-EAS for ACT.
2\. The S-EES checks whether the requesting EAS is authorized to perform the
operation. If it is authorized, the S-EES responds with an EELManagedACR
service response. If no address for accessing Application Context is provided
by S-EAS in step 1, then the S-EES provides an address for storing the
Application Context by S-EAS.
NOTE: How the EES accesses the Application Context related to the EAS from the
address of the Application Context storage is up to implementation and outside
the scope of the present document.
3\. The S-EES determines the EELManagedACR operations to be executed as
specified in clause 8.8.2.5.
###### 8.8.3.6.2.3 ACT status subscription
Figure 8.8.3.6.2.3-1 illustrates the procedure for T-EAS to subscribe for ACT
status during EELManagedACR.
Figure 8.8.3.6.2.3-1: ACR procedure
1\. The T-EAS sends an ACT status subscription request to the T-EES.
2\. The T-EES checks whether the requesting T-EAS is authorized to perform the
operation. If it is authorized, the T-EES creates the subscription.
3\. The T-EES responds with the ACT status subscription response
###### 8.8.3.6.2.4 ACT status notification
Figure 8.8.3.6.2.4-1 illustrates the procedure for T-EES to notify the T-EAS
about the status of ACT during EELManagedACR.
Pre-conditions:
1\. ACT between the S-EES and T-EES has competed.
Figure 8.8.3.6.2.4-1: ACR procedure
1\. The T-EES sends ACT status notification to the T-EAS, notifying about the
status of the ACT between the Application Context received from the S-EES.
2\. On receiving a notification about successful ACT, the T-EAS may initiate
the ACR status update procedure as described in clause 8.8.3.8.
#### 8.8.3.7 Selected T-EAS declaration
Figure 8.8.3.7-1 illustrates the interactions between the S-EAS and the S-EES
for the selected T-EAS declaration.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The S-EAS has discovered and selected the T-EAS as described in clause
8.8.3.2.
{width="5.115277777777778in" height="2.3333333333333335in"}
Figure 8.8.3.7-1: Selected target EAS declaration procedure
1\. The S-EAS sends Selected target EAS declaration request message to the
S-EES. The request includes the information of the selected T-EAS and may
include ACID to indicate which AC the T-EAS is intended for.
2\. The S-EES checks whether the requesting EAS is authorized to perform
operation. If authorized, the S-EES responds to the received request with
Selected target EAS notification declaration response message. The S-EES also
determines the selected T-EES based on the declared T-EAS selection, then
S-EES checks whether the EEC (serving the ACs) has subscribed for ACR related
information.
#### 8.8.3.8 ACR status update procedure
Figure 8.8.3.8-1 illustrates the procedure for ACR status update, which is
triggered by the S-EAS or the T-EAS. In the post-ACR clean up phase of service
continuity scenarios described in clause 8.8.2, this procedure may be used by
EAS to indicate the status of ACT to their registrar EESs; or used by the
T-EAS to update the notification target address and allow the T-EES to
indicate the status of EDGE-3 subscription relocation to the T-EAS including
subscription ID update for EDGE-3 subscriptions; or both.
Pre-condition:
1\. The ACT procedure between the S-EAS and the T-EAS is either successfully
completed or failed.
Figure 8.8.3.8-1: ACR status update procedure
1\. The EAS sends ACR status update request message to the EES, the request
may include the ACT result (success or failure). When sent by the T-EAS, the
request may include a list of EDGE-3 subscription ID(s) and Notification
Target Address for which the T-EAS wants to update. In case of EELManagedACR,
the ACT result is not included by the T-EAS.
2\. If the request is authorized by the EES, the EES processes the request.
When sent by the T-EAS, if the EDGE-3 subscriptions are available in the T-EES
or were successfully relocated during the EEC context relocation procedure,
the T-EES updates the Notification Target Address if provided by the T-EAS and
may update the list of EDGE-3 subscription ID(s) for the EDGE-3 subscriptions.
> When the ACR status update request message of step 1 includes the ACT
> result, it shall also include the UEID and endpoint information of the other
> EAS involved in the ACT. The EES uses UEID and EAS endpoint information to
> identify the corresponding ACR. In cases where the ACT result indicates
> failure of the ACR (i.e. failure with a cause indicating cancellation of the
> ACR), the T-EES which receives the ACR status update request message removes
> the transferred EEC context.
3\. The EES responds with ACR status update response message to the EAS.
NOTE: If EES is not changed during ACR, the T-EES and S-EES are the same
server.
### 8.8.4 Information flows
#### 8.8.4.1 General
#### 8.8.4.2 EAS discovery request
Table 8.5.3.2-1 describes information elements for the EAS discovery request
from the EAS to the EES and from the S-EES to the T-EES. Table 8.5.3.2-2
provides further detail about the EAS Discovery Filter information element.
#### 8.8.4.3 EAS discovery response
The information elements specified in the Table 8.5.3.3-1 is used for the EAS
discovery response sent from the EES to the EAS with the following
differences:
\- The EAS available resources (e.g. memory) indicates the maximum resources
available for the AC(s) connected to the S-EAS.
#### 8.8.4.4 ACR request
Table 8.8.4.4-1 describes information elements for the ACR request sent either
from the EEC to the S-EES or T-EES, or by the S-EAS to the S-EES.

## 8.9 EEC Context and EEC Context relocation
### 8.9.1 General
EEC Context contains information related to an EEC which is used by EESs to
provide the Edge Enabler Layer services. The EEC Context may include
information about the EEC-hosting UE and the ACs to which the EEC provides
services. The EEC Context information may be collected and maintained at the
EES in an EDN while the respective ACs are connected to EASs in that EDN.
EEC Context relocation procedures allow the EEC Context information to be
shared between EESs (via EDGE-9 interactions).
The EEC Context information may contain List of EDGE-1 subscriptions (i.e.,
list of subscription IDs for an EEC). The corresponding EDGE-1 subscription
information includes EEC ID, Event ID, subscription ID, 3GPP CN subscription
information (optional), notification target address (optional) and filter
information (optional).
#### 8.9.1.1 EEC Context handling at EEC registration
An EEC Context shall be created for each registered EEC, after a successful
registration, by the receiver EES, as follows:
\- If the EEC registration request does not include a previously assigned EEC
Context ID value, the receiver EES creates an EEC Context as described in
clause 8.2.8. The receiver EES shall assign an EEC context ID and set the
source EES Endpoint to its own Endpoint. The EEC ID and UE Identifier shall be
set based on the corresponding registration request parameters.
\- If the EEC registration request contains an EEC context ID and source EES
Endpoint, the receiver (i.e., target) EES performs an EEC Context Pull
relocation (clause 8.9.2.2). After a successful EEC Context relocation, the
target EES updates the source EES Endpoint with its own Endpoint. The target
EES may preserve the EEC Context ID received in the request or assign a new
EEC Context ID, subject to EES implementation and local policies.
> If the EEC Context relocation is not successful, the target EES creates an
> EEC Context as described in clause 8.2.8. The target EES shall assign an EEC
> context ID and set the source EES Endpoint to its own endpoint. The EEC ID
> and UE ID shall be set based on the corresponding registration request
> parameters.
>
> After a successful EEC Context Relocation procedure is performed at EEC
> (re-)registration to a target EES, the source EES shall determine to be
> stale the EEC Context identified by the EEC Context ID included in the
> request (i.e., relocated) and the EEC to be de-registered.
#### 8.9.1.2 EEC Context handling at EEC registration update
An EEC Context shall be updated when EEC Registration update requests
targeting the corresponding EEC ID are received.
#### 8.9.1.3 EEC Context handling at EEC de-registration
An EEC Context, including the list of Service Session Context(s) information,
shall be determined to be stale after a successful EEC de-registration
procedure.
NOTE: Stale EEC Context(s) are subject to information persistence policies and
privacy policies. Mechanisms for re-use of stale EEC Context(s) are not in
scope of the current version of specification.
#### 8.9.1.4 EEC Context handling at Application Context Relocation
The EEC Context provided to a target EES in an EEC Context Pull relocation or
an EEC context Push relocation shall be stored at the target EES, as follows:
\- If an EEC context with the same EEC ID, EEC Context ID and source Endpoint
already exists at the target EES, the EEC Context is updated.
\- If an EEC context with the same EEC ID, EEC Context ID and source Endpoint
does not exist at the target EES, the EEC Context is stored.
After a successful EEC Context Relocation procedure is performed at ACR, the
source EES shall determine to be stale the element(s) of the list of Service
Session Context(s) information included in the request (i.e., relocated). If
all Service Session Context(s) information in the EEC Context are stale, the
EEC Context is determined to be stale and the EEC to be de-registered.
#### 8.9.1.5 Other EEC Context handling
Elements of the list of Service Session Context(s) information shall be
created by the EES when it determines that a registered EAS is providing
services to an AC on the served EEC.
Editor\'s Note: How the EES determines that a registered EAS is providing
services to an AC is FFS.
Elements of the list of Service Session Context(s) information shall be
determined to be stale when the EES determines that a registered EAS is no
longer providing services to an AC on the served EEC.
NOTE: In this version of specification, mechanisms used by EES to determine
that a registered EAS is no longer providing services to an AC on a served EEC
are implementation-dependent.
An EEC Context shall be updated as follows:
\- When EEC Context(s) are created, either after a registration request or
based on EEC Context relocation procedure, the EES shall check whether the UE
Identifier corresponds to an existing EEC Context and update the EEC Context
accordingly.
\- When EEC subscription requests corresponding to the EEC ID are processed,
the \"List of EDGE-1 subscriptions\" shall be updated accordingly
### 8.9.2 Procedures
#### 8.9.2.1 General
The following procedures are supported for EEC Context relocation:
\- EEC Context Push; and
\- EEC Context Pull.
#### 8.9.2.2 EEC Context Pull relocation
An EEC Context is relocated via an EEC Context Pull request initiated by the
target EES.
Figure 8.9.2.2-1 illustrates the EEC Context Pull.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The source EES has provided the EEC with an EEC Context ID; and
2\. The target EES has received the EEC Context ID, source EES Endpoint.
Figure 8.9.2.2-1: EEC Context Pull procedure
1\. The target EES requests an EEC Context from the source EES. The request
includes EEC Context ID.
2\. Upon receiving the request from the target EES, the source EES validates
the request and verifies the security credentials of the requester. The source
EES uses the EEC Context ID provided to identify and authorize the EEC Context
to be relocated.
3\. The source EES sends a successful EEC Context response. The target EES
stores the received EEC Context.
#### 8.9.2.3 EEC Context Push relocation
An EEC Context is relocated via an EEC Context Push request initiated by the
source EES.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The source EES has provided the EEC with an EEC Context ID.
Figure 8.9.2.3-2: EEC Context relocation procedure initiated by source EES
1\. The source EES determines to forward EEC Context for relocation to a
target EES. The source EES determines the target and the EEC Context to be
forwarded.
2\. The source EES sends EEC Context Push request to the target EES including
the EEC Context determined.
3\. Upon receiving the request from the source EES, the target EES validates
the request and verifies the security credentials. The target EES uses the EEC
Context ID provided to authorize the EEC Context to be stored and managed.
Then the target EES sends an EEC Context response indicating success. The
T-EES performs implicit registration and creates the registration ID for the
registration and includes it in the EEC context push response message for
S-EAS decided ACR or S-EES executed ACR scenarios. The S-EES stores the
registration details, and when required, notifes the EEC about registration
details while sending ACR information notification.

## 8.10 Utilizing 3GPP core network capabilities
### 8.10.1 General
The functional entities of the Edge Enabler Layer can utilize the 3GPP core
network capabilities (i.e. 5GC, EPC) to fulfill the needs of the edge service
operations. This clause specifies the details of the 3GPP core network
capabilities consumed by each functional entity.
### 8.10.2 Capabilities utilized by ECS
When required, the ECS may utilize:
\- user plane path management events by subscribing with the 3GPP core network
for the user plane path management event notifications of the UE as described
in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]; and
\- the location information from the API exposed by 3GPP core network, e.g.
SCEF/NEF/SCEF+NEF or LCS (Location Service) as specified in 3GPP TS 23.682
[17], 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], 3GPP TS 23.271 [7], 3GPP TS 36.305 [8], 3GPP TS
23.273 [9] and 3GPP TS 38.305 [10] to obtain the UE\'s location from the 3GPP
Core Network.
### 8.10.3 Capabilities utilized by EES
When required, the EES may utilize:
\- AF traffic influence functionality, including the user plane path
management event notifications of the UE, from the 3GPP core network as
described in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3];
\- the location information from the API exposed by 3GPP core network, e.g.
SCEF/NEF/SCEF+NEF or LCS (Location Service) as specified in 3GPP TS 23.682
[17], 3GPP TS 23.502 [3], 3GPP TS 23.271 [7], 3GPP TS 36.305 [8], 3GPP TS
23.273 [9] and 3GPP TS 38.305 [10] to obtain the UE\'s location from the 3GPP
Core Network;
\- capabilities exposed by the 3GPP core network, e.g. NEF or PCF, to
establish an AF session with QoS, and QoS related event notifications
subscribed with the 3GPP core network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], 3GPP
TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [12];
\- capabilities exposed by the 3GPP core network, e.g. NEF or NWDAF, to

\- the monitoring capability exposed by the 3GPP core network as specified in
3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
## 8.11 EEC Authentication/Authorization
### 8.11.1 General
The architecture for enabling edge applications supports EEC
authentication/authorization.
After the successful EEC authentication/authorization, the EEC acquires a
valid security credential for EEC related procedures including service
provisioning procedure, EEC registration procedure, EAS discovery procedure
and ACR procedure. Detailed procedures are specified in 3GPP TS 33.558 [23].
## 8.12 Dynamic EAS instantiation triggering
### 8.12.1 General
The EES may trigger the EAS instantiation dynamically due to e.g., EAS
discovery request, UE mobility, upon receiving EEC Registration request
containing AC profile.
Upon receiving the EAS discovery request with EAS discovery filter from the
EEC or the S-EES during the procedures for EAS discovery or ACR, the EES may
fail to discover and select the EAS that matches the UE location and the
requesting application characteristics specified in table 8.5.3.2-2 due to no
EAS is available or instantiated. The EES may trigger the ECSP management
system (which is specified in TS 28.538 [22]) to instantiate the EAS serving
the AC in the EDN before returning the EAS information to the EEC or S-EES,
based on the pre-configured dynamic EAS instantiation information about which
EAS can be dynamically instantiated at the associated EDN.
NOTE 1: The ECSP management system is responsible for the authorization of the
dynamic EAS instantiation.
NOTE 2: The ECSP management system can provide the pre-configured dynamic EAS
instantiation information to the EES. Such a mechanism is out of scope of this
release of the present document.
NOTE 3: Dynamic EAS instantiation information at the EES is left
implementation specific in this version of the specification.
## 8.13 Charging
The charging procedures are specified in 3GPP TS 32.257 [25].
###### ## Annex A (Informative): Deployment models
# A.1 General
The following clauses illustrate different aspects of some possible deployment
options
\- Clause A.2 describes some deployment models for different DN
implementations;
\- Clause A.3 describes some options for how ECS is deployed in relation to
the UE;
\- Clause A.4 describes deployment of EES in relation with SEAL services and
Application Enabler Services; and
\- Clause A.5 describes deployments in relation with CAPIF.
# A.2 Deployment models for different DN implementations
## A.2.1 General
This clause describes examples of deployment models with respect to different
DN implementations as follows:
\- option 1. use of non-dedicated DN;
\- option 2. use of Edge-dedicated DN; and
\- option 3. use of LADN.
The PLMN supporting edge computing services provides connection to one or
multiple DNs.
The following clauses describes the detailed deployment models including
relationships between EAS service areas, EES service areas, LADN service
areas, and PLMN area.
## A.2.2 Option 1. Use of non-dedicated DN
There is no Edge-dedicated DN for support of edge computing service. A DN
common to other services (e.g. internet access) is used to connect to the
EASs.
The PLMN supporting edge computing services provides connection to EASs
located in EDNs that respectively corresponds to one or more DNAI(s), and each
EDN is identified by DNN and one or more DNAI. UEs establishing PDU sessions
for the EASs identify the DN using the same DNN and slice information as for
PDU sessions for non-Edge services.
Each EAS and EES can have a topological service area or a geographical service
area that the EAS and EES serves, respectively. Within this service area, UEs
can access an EAS or an EES regardless of their location within the PLMN area
via local breakout.
Figure A.2.2-1: Option 1: Use of non-dedicated DN
## A.2.3 Option 2. Use of Edge-dedicated DN
The deployment uses Edge-dedicated DNs for support of edge computing service.
Each Edge-dedicated DN is configured with unique DNNs.
The PLMN supporting edge computing services provides connection to several
EDNs that correspond to one or more DNAI(s), and each EDN is identified by DNN
of the Edge-dedicated DN and one or more DNAI.
Figure A.2.3-1: Option 2: Use of Edge-dedicated DN
## A.2.4 Option 3. Use of LADN
Edge computing services can be provided via Edge-dedicated Data Networks
deployed as LADNs. With this option, the PLMN supports edge computing services
in the EDN service areas which is equal to the LADN service area. The LADN
service area is the service area that the Edge Computing is supported. Each
individual EAS in the LADN can support the same or smaller service area than
the LADN.
Figure A.2.4-1: Option 3: Use of LADN(s)
# A.3 ECS deployments in relation to the UE
## A.3.1 General
This clause shows some examples for how the ECS can be deployed in relation to
the UE
## A.3.2 UE (EEC) served by a single ECS
In this scenario the UE can contain a single AC or multiple ACs, however the
UE contains a single EEC which is configured with the address of a single ECS.
This could for example be an IoT device that only supports a single AC or a
smartphone device which contains many ACs which are served by a single ECS.
## A.3.3 UE (EECs) served by multiple ECSs
In this scenario the user is allowed to install multiple ACs in the UE where
each AC can be served by an EAS which in turn served by a different ECSP\'s
EES/ECS.
One example is that multiple ACs are installed on a smartphone and the
associated EASs are on-boarded onto different ECSP\'s EESs which are
registered with different ECSs.
Another example is a UE that supports Dual SIM. In this scenario the UE can
support concurrent connection to two PLMNs.
# A.4 Deployment of EES in relation with SEAL services and Application Enabler
Services
## A.4.1 General
The illustration of layered application architecture with the generic SEAL and
Application Enabler server functions available in the cloud is shown in Figure
A.4.1-1.
Figure A.4.1-1: Illustration of a layered application architecture with
generic SEAL and Application Enabler server functions available in the cloud
The examples of application specific client are V2X application specific
client, FF application specific client, UAS application specific client or
other vertical application specific client residing on the UE. Similarly, the
application specific server could be e.g. V2X application specific server, FF
application specific server, UAS application specific server or other vertical
application specific server.
The UE may consist of an application enabler client. The examples of
application enabler client include V2X application enabler client, FF
application enabler client, UAS application enabler client or other vertical
application enabler client residing on the UE. Similarly, the application
enabler server could be V2X application enabler server, FF application enabler
Server, UAS application enabler server or other vertical application enabler
server.
The illustration of layered application architecture with generic SEAL and
Application Enabler server functions available in the edge is shown in Figure
A.4.1-2.
Figure A.4.1-2: Illustration of layered application architecture with generic
SEAL and Application Enabler server functions available in the edge
While the server functions of an application specific server can be made
available only as an EAS, it is also possible that certain application
specific server functions are available both at the edge and in the cloud.
Similarly, the server functions of an application enabler server can be made
available only as an EAS, it is also possible that certain application enabler
server functions are available both at the edge and in the cloud. When the
server functions of an application are both available at the edge and the
cloud, there may be a need for interaction between the two corresponding
application servers, which is out of scope of this specification.
NOTE 1: The details of a specific vertical application architecture based on
the generic layered application architecture with server functions of an
application available in the edge and the cloud is out of scope of this
specification.
NOTE 2: When UE is in the coverage of the EDN due to which certain server
functions are available both at the edge and in the cloud, then whether UE
connects to the server functions available at the edge or directly to the
cloud is out of scope of the present document.
## A.4.2 Deployment of SEAL services
There are several options to support SEAL service APIs to be exposed to the
EAS.
The EES can act as the CAPIF core function, and the SEAL servers acting the
AEF and publish the SEAL service API to the EES. Further, the SEAL service
APIs is discovered by the EASs acting as the API invoker during the service
API discover procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].
The EES can act as the API topology hiding entry and re-expose SEAL service
APIs as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [13] to EAS via EDGE-3 which utilizes the
CAPIF-2/2e reference point as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].
## A.4.3 Deployment of Application Enabler services
There are several options to support vertical application enabler server
(e.g., V2X application enabler server) APIs to be exposed to the EAS.
The EES can act as the CAPIF core function, and the vertical application
enabler server acting the AEF and publish the vertical application enabler
server APIs to the EES. Further, the vertical application enabler server APIs
is discovered by the EASs acting as the API invoker during the service API
discover procedure as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].
The EES can act as the API topology hiding entry and re-exposes vertical
application enabler server APIs, e.g., VAE server APIs as specified in 3GPP TS
23.286 [14] to EAS via EDGE-3 which utilizes the CAPIF-2/2e reference point as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6].
# A.5 Deployments in relation with CAPIF
## A.5.1 General
## A.5.2 Distributed CAPIF core functions
The EES can support EAS\'s access to northbound APIs exposed by SCEF/NEF by
providing distributed CAPIF core functions as shown in Figure A.5.2-1.
Figure A.5.2-1: EES supporting distributed CAPIF core functions
The EDNs reside outside the PLMN trust domain as shown in Figure A.5.2-1. In
EDN 2, the EAS and EES are within the same ECSP trust domain. While in EDN 1,
the EES and the EAS are in the different ECSP trust domain.
The EES of an EDN provides the following functions for network capability
exposure:
\- the CAPIF core function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6] to support
onboarding of EASs (API invokers), publish of service APIs, discovery of
service APIs and charging of service APIs invocations; and
\- the API exposing function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6] to expose the
service APIs from SCEF/NEF to the EASs via proxy or gateway function.
The following procedures are performed as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6]:
\- The SCEF and NEF act as API exposing function and the service APIs from
SCEF (T8) and NEF (Nnef) are published to the CAPIF core function 1\. The
service APIs are published to the EESs (CAPIF core function 2 and CAPIF core
function 3) from the CAPIF core function 1.
\- The EAS acts as an API invoker and is onboarded to the EES (CAPIF core
function 2 or CAPIF core function 3) within the EDN.
\- The EASs (API invokers) are authenticated with EES (CAPIF core function 2
or CAPIF core function 3).
NOTE: The trusted EASs can utilize the services of a centralized CAPIF core
function deployed by the PLMN operator instead of the CAPIF core function of
EES deployed within the EDN.
\- The EAS discovers the service APIs published by the SCEF and NEF via the
EES (CAPIF core function 2 or CAPIF core function 3) within the EDN including
the end point address of the API exposing function where the service API
invocation is to be performed.
\- The EAS obtains authorization to invoke the service APIs of the SCEF and
NEF from the EES (CAPIF core function 2 or CAPIF core function 3).
\- The EAS invokes the service APIs of the SCEF and NEF after authorization by
the EES (API exposing function) and obtaining the UE identifier as specified
in clause 8.6.5. The EES (API exposing function) further invokes the service
APIs of the SCEF or NEF in the 3GPP core network. EDGE-2 supports CAPIF-7e
interactions corresponding to T8 (for SCEF) and N33 (for NEF).
## A.5.3 Centralized CAPIF core function
The EES can support EAS (owned by 3^rd^ party or by PLMN operator) access to
northbound APIs exposed by SCEF/NEF by using centralized CAPIF core functions
as shown in Figure A.5.3-1.
Figure A.5.3-1: EES supporting centralized CAPIF core functions
The EDNs reside outside the PLMN trust domain as shown in Figure A.5.3-1. In
EDN 2, the EAS and EES are within the same ECSP trust domain. While in EDN 1,
the EES and the EAS are in the different ECSP trust domain.
The EES of an EDN provides the following functions for network capability
exposure:
\- the API exposing function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6] to expose the
service APIs from SCEF/NEF to the EASs via proxy or gateway function.
The following procedures are performed as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [6]:
\- The SCEF and NEF act as API exposing function and the service APIs from
SCEF (T8) and NEF (Nnef) are published to the centralized CAPIF core function.
The service APIs exposed by the EESs are published to the centralized CAPIF
core function.
\- The EAS acts as an API invoker and is onboarded to the centralized CAPIF
core function residing outside of the EDN.
\- The EASs (API invokers) are authenticated with the centralized CAPIF core
function.
\- The EAS discovers the service APIs published by the SCEF and NEF via the
centralized CAPIF core function including the end point address of the API
exposing function where the service API invocation is to be performed.
\- The EAS obtains authorization to invoke the service APIs of the SCEF and
NEF from the centralized CAPIF core function.
\- The EAS invokes the service APIs of the SCEF and NEF after authorization by
the EES (API exposing function) and obtaining the UE identifier as specified
in clause 8.6.5. The EES (API exposing function) further invokes the service
APIs of the SCEF or NEF in the 3GPP core network. EDGE-2 supports CAPIF-7e
interactions corresponding to T8 (for SCEF) and N33 (for NEF).
###### ## Annex B (Informative): Involved entities and relationships
# B.1 General
This clause describes the relationship of edge computing service providers,
PLMN operators, application service providers and users.
Figure B-1: Relationships involved in edge computing service
The end user is the consumer of the applications provided by the application
service provider (ASP) and can have ASP service agreement with a single or
multiple application service providers. The end user has a PLMN subscription
arrangement with the PLMN operator. The UE used by the end user is allowed to
be registered on the PLMN operator network.
The application service provider consumes the edge services (e.g.
infrastructure, platform) provided by the edge computing service provider
(ECSP) and can have edge computing service provider service agreement with a
single or multiple edge computing service providers.
A single PLMN operator can have the PLMN operator service agreement with a
single or multiple edge computing service providers.
A single ECSP can have PLMN operator service agreement with a single or
multiple PLMN operators which provide edge computing support.
The edge computing service provider and the PLMN operator can be part of the
same organization.
###### ## Annex C (Informative): Relationship with ETSI MEC architecture
# C.1 General
This clause shows an example for how the EDGEAPP architecture and ETSI ISG MEC
architecture as specified in ETSI GS MEC 003 [15] can complement each other.
ETSI ISG MEC addresses aspects pertaining to MEC Application enablement
through the MEC platform. Additionally, ETSI ISG MEC supports management and
orchestration aspects for MEC components.
# C.2 Relationship between EDGEAPP and ETSI MEC architectures
Figure C.2-1 provides the relationship of ETSI ISG MEC architecture with
EDGEAPP architecture.
Figure C.2-1: Relationship between EDGEAPP and ETSI MEC architectures
Details about MEC entities (MEC Platform, MEC Application, MEC Platform
Manager, MEC Orchestrator, OSS and CFS) can be found in ETSI GS MEC 003 [15].
In ETSI MEC, MEC Applications and MEC Platform can expose services which can
include network services, subject to their availability at the core or access
network level.
Both EAS and MEC application are application servers and can provide similar
application specific functionalities. EAS utilizes the services of EES as
specified in this document whereas MEC application utilizes the services
provided by MEC platform as specified in ETSI GS MEC 003 [15]. The EAS and MEC
application can be aligned in an implementation.
NOTE 1: The details of the functionalities of application servers and
alignment are implementation specific.
Both EES and MEC platform provide application support capabilities towards the
application servers. How EES and MEC platform are implemented or aligned is
implementation specific. Likewise, alignment of the EDGE-3 and Mp1 reference
points and EDGE-9 and Mp3 reference points is implementation specific. The EES
and MEC platform can be aligned in an implementation.
The orchestration and management aspects of architecture for enabling edge
applications are specified in 3GPP TS 28.538 [22].
NOTE 2: The specification of aligned implementation is out of scope in this
release.
###### ## Annex D (Informative): Relationship with GSMA OPG
# D.1 General
GSMA Operator Platform Group has published a GSMA Whitepaper OPG.01 \"Operator
Platform: Telco Edge Proposal\". The Operator Platform aims to expose
capabilities in operator networks to 3^rd^ party developers and applications.
This annex provides a high-level relationship between the architecture for
enabling edge applications defined in clause 6 with the Operator Platform\'s
reference architecture defined in GSMA Whitepaper OPG.01 [19].
# D.2 Relationship between EDGEAPP architecture and GSMA OPG reference
architecture
Figure D.2-1 illustrates the relationship between EDGEAPP architecture and
GSMA OPG reference architecture.
Figure D.2-1: Relationship between EDGEAPP architecture and GSMA OPG reference
architecture
EDGE-1 and EDGE-4 reference points can support similar function(s) as OP\'s
User-Network interface (UNI), providing the Edge Enabler Client (corresponding
to Edge/User Client in OP) with the information required to access the edge
services. EDGE-1/EDGE-4 neither impact nor overlap with other existing 3GPP
interfaces between the UE and the network, catering to the OP\'s requirements
on UNI.
EDGE-2 and EDGE-8 reference points can support similar function(s) as OP\'s
Southbound interface (SBI), through which the edge enabler layer
(corresponding to the operator platform) access the 3GPP network capabilities
and services. Specifically, EDGE-2 and EDGE-8 cater to the requirements of the
SBI-NetworkResource interface. The ECSP management system as specified in 3GPP
TS 28.538 [22] caters to the requirements of OP\'s SBI-CloudResource
interface.
EDGE-3 reference point can support similar function(s) as OP\'s Northbound
interface (NBI), exposing the capabilities of Edge Enabler Server to the Edge
Application Servers (EAS) hosted on the edge. OP\'s NBI also expands
capabilities exposure to ASPs, for example to on-board applications to be
deployed as EASs based on specific criteria.
EDGE-9 reference point can support similar function(s) as OP\'s East/Westbound
interface (E/WBI), allowing the edge enabler layer to interact within and
beyond its domains e.g. between operator platforms. OP\'s E/WBI focuses on use
cases like user and application roaming or resource sharing across domains.
