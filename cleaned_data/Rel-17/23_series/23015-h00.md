This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The network feature Operator Determined Barring (ODB) allows a network
operator or service provider to regulate access by subscribers to services
(Circuit/Packet Oriented and Interworking WLAN), by the barring of certain
categories of incoming or outgoing calls/ Packet Oriented Services or of
roaming. Operator Determined Barring applies to all bearer services and
teleservices except the Emergency Call teleservice and Emergency Bearer
Services; the teleservice Short Message Point-to-Point is therefore subject to
Operator Determined Barring in the same way as circuit-switched calls.
The application of specific categories of Operator Determined Barring to a
subscription is controlled by the network operator or service provider, using
administrative interaction at the HLR; this interface is not standardised.
## 1.1 Normative references
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

Abbreviations used in this specification are listed in 3GPP TS 21.905.
# 2 Method of realisation
The entities which control the application of Operator Determined Barring
(ODB), and the methods used, are described in this clause. Two cases are
considered for each type of barring: the effect of administrative action in
the HLR to modify the application of the category to a particular
subscription, and the effect of the category on the handling of calls or other
traffic involving the subscriber.
## 2.1 Barring of Outgoing Calls or Mobile Originated Short Messages
Barring of outgoing calls or mobile originated short messages includes the
categories \"outgoing calls\" and \"outgoing premium rate calls\" defined in
3GPP TS 22.041 [2], and the \"operator specific barring\" category where this
is defined by the PLMN operator to apply to outgoing calls or mobile
originated short messages.
### 2.1.1 Application or Change of Barring in the HLR
If barring of outgoing calls or mobile originated short messages is applied to
a subscription (or existing barring of outgoing calls or mobile originated
short messages is modified or removed) by administrative action in the HLR,
the HLR will update the subscription information accordingly, and transfer the
updated subscription information to the VLR and the SGSN using one or more
Insert Subscriber Data operations, as shown in figure 2.1.1/1.
If operator specific barring is applied to a subscription (or existing
operator specific barring is modified or removed) by administrative action in
the HLR, the HLR will update the subscription information accordingly. If the
mobile subscriber is registered in the home PLMN, the HLR will transfer the
updated subscription information to the VLR and the SGSN using one or more
Insert Subscriber Data operations, as shown in figure2.1.1/ 1.
If the VPLMN does not support Operator Determined Barring of outgoing calls,
the VLR and the SGSN shall indicate this in the acknowledgement of the Insert
Subscriber Data message. The HLR shall then, as an operator option, apply the
Outgoing Calls Barred supplementary service, apply barring of roaming as
described in clause 2.3 or take any other action decided by the operator of
the HPLMN.

## 2.3 Barring of Roaming
### 2.3.1 Application or Change of Barring in the HLR/HSS/UDM
If barring of roaming is applied to a subscription (or modified or removed) by
administrative action in the HLR/HSS/UDM, the HLR/HSS/UDM shall update the
subscription information accordingly. If the HLR/HSS/UDM determines from the
identity of the VLR and/or the SGSN and/or MME and/or the AMF that the mobile
subscriber is currently registered in a barred PLMN, the HLR/HSS/UDM shall put
the barring into effect by using a Cancel Location operation to the VLR and/or
the SGSN and /or to the MME when applied in HLR/HSS or a UECM Deregistration
to AMF when applied in UDM, as shown in figure 2.3.1/1. In the 5G Core case,
barring of roaming may be stored in UDR. Upon change of barring of roaming in
UDR, UDM clears also user registration in UDR using Nudr_DM_Update operation
and unsubscribes to changes on barring of roaming data using
Nudr_DM_Unsubscribe operation.
If the mobile subscriber is not currently registered in a barred PLMN, the
HLR/HSS/UDM shall take no further action.

## 2.6A Barring of existing PDP contexts
Barring of existing PDP contexts shall be performed based on the Operator
Determined Barring for Packet Oriented Services defined in 3G TS 22.041 [2].
### 2.6A.1 Application or Change of Barring in the HLR
If barring of Packet Oriented Services is applied to a subscription (or
existing barring of Packet Oriented Services is modified or removed) by
administrative action in the HLR, the HLR will update the subscription
information accordingly, and transfer the updated subscription information to
the SGSN using one or more Insert Subscriber Data operations, as shown in
figure 2.6A.1/1.
If the VPLMN does not support Operator Determined Barring of Packet Oriented
Services, the SGSN shall indicate this in the acknowledgement of the Insert
Subscriber Data message. The HLR shall then, as an operator option, apply
barring of roaming as described in clause 2.3 or take any other action decided
by the operator of the HPLMN.

## 2.9 Barring of Access to All Except Some Specific DNNs/APNs
### 2.9.1 General
Barring of access to all except some specific DNNs/APNs shall be performed
based on the Operator Determined Barring for Packet Oriented Services defined
in 3GPP TS 22.041 [2].
### 2.9.2 Application or Change of Barring in the UDM/HSS/HLR
When barring of access to all except some specific DNNs/APNs is invoked in the
UDM/HSS/HLR, the UDM/HSS/HLR shall update the subscription profile to contain
only the specific non barred DNNs/APNs as the subscribed DNNs/APNs and
indicate the updated subscription information to the AMF, SMF, MME or the
SGSN.
If the existing default DNN/APN is barred, one of the specific non barred
DNN/APNs shall be the new default DNN/APN.
The UDM/HSS/HLR shall disable any other barring of Packet Oriented Services
when this function is used.
When barring of access to all except some specific DNNs/APNs is removed in the
UDM/HSS/HLR, the UDM/HSS/HLR shall update the subscription profile to restore
the originally subscribed DNNs/APNs, including the original default DNN/APN
and indicate the updated subscription information to the AMF, the MME or the
SGSN.
### 2.9.3 Invocation of Barring
When the AMF, the SMF, the MME or the SGSN updates the subscription, and if
the subscriber has existing PDN connectivity for DNNs/APNs not in the received
list of subscribed DNN/APN, the SMF, MME or the SGSN deactivates the PDU/PDN
connectivity for these DNNs/APNs as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [7], 3GPP TS
23.401 [6] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [7].
To bar a subscriber from access to all except some specific DNNs/APNs, when
the AMF, the MME or the SGSN receives PDU/PDN Connectivity Request message
from the UE or the MS, the AMF, the MME or the SGSN shall check whether or not
the requested DNN/APN is included in the list of subscribed DNNs/APNs for the
subscriber. If included, then the AMF, the MME or the SGSN continues the
Attach or UE-requested PDU/PDN connectivity or MS-requested PDP Context
Activation procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [7], 3GPP TS 23.401 [6]
and 3GPP TS 23.060 [7]. If not included, then the AMF, the MME or the SGSN
rejects the Attach or UE-requested PDU/PDN connectivity or MS-requested PDP
Context Activation requests as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [7], 3GPP TS 23.401
[6] and 3GPP TS 23.060 [7].
