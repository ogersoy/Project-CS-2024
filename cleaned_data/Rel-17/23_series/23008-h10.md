# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 0 Scope
The present document provides details concerning information to be stored in
the different entities storing data within a 3GPP network concerning mobile
subscriber. A list of entities storing subscriber data is provided in clause
1.
Clause 2 contains all details concerning the definition of the parameters,
often given by reference to other specifications, and where the parameter is
to be stored.
Table 1 in clause 3 gives a summary overview and clause 4 identifies the
reference information required for accessing the information.
In this specification, if there is no specific indication, the following
principles apply:
\- \"SGSN\" refers to an SGSN which may support the Gn and Gp interfaces or
the S4 interface or both.
\- \"S4-SGSN\" refers to an SGSN which only supports the S4 interface.
\- \"Gn/Gp-SGSN\" refers to an SGSN which only supports the Gn and Gp
interfaces.
## 0.1 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 1 Introduction
## 1.1 Definition
The term subscriber data is used to designate all information associated with
a subscription which is required for service provisions, identification,
authentication, routing, call handling, GPRS mode transmission, charging,
subscriber tracing, operation and maintenance purposes. Some subscriber data
are referred to as permanent subscriber data, i.e. they can only be changed by
administration means. Other data are temporary subscriber data which may
change as a result of normal operation of the system.
Unless shown to be conditional, all data items are considered to be mandatory.
## 1.2 Storage facilities
This specification considers subscriber data stored by the following types of
network functions:
\- Home subscriber server (HSS) which contains all permanent subscriber data
and all relevant temporary subscriber data to support the call control and
session management entities of the different Domains and Subsystems.
\- Home location register (HLR) which contains all permanent subscriber data
and all relevant temporary subscriber data for all mobile subscribers
permanently registered in the HLR for CS and PS Domains.
NOTE 0: according to 3GPP TS 23.002 [50] HLR is a subset of the HSS
functionality.
\- CSG subscriber server (CSS) which contains Closed Subscriber Group
information data for inbound roaming UEs to enable VPLMN autonomous CSG
roaming in CS and PS domains.
\- Visitor location register (VLR) which contains all subscriber data required
for call handling and other purposes for mobile subscribers currently located
in the area controlled by the VLR.
\- Serving GPRS Support Node (SGSN) which contains all subscriber data
required for GPRS mode transmission and other purposes for mobile subscribers
currently located in the area controlled by the SGSN.
\- Gateway GPRS Support Node (GGSN) which contains all subscriber data
required for GPRS mode transmission for mobile subscribers using any service
provided by the GGSN.
\- Mobility Management Entity (MME) which contains all subscriber data
required for EPS mode transmission and other purposes for mobile subscribers
currently located in the area controlled by the MME.
\- Serving GW (S-GW) which contains all subscriber data required for EPS mode
transmission for mobile subscribers currently served by the S-GW.
\- PDN GW (P-GW) which contains all subscriber data required for EPS mode
transmission for mobile subscribers using any service provided by the P-GW.
\- ePDG which contains all subscriber data required for EPS mode transmission
for mobile subscribers currently served by the ePDG via a non 3GPP access.
\- Gateway Mobile Location Center (GMLC) which contains all subscriber data
required for external clients of the Location Services (LCS).
\- In GSM, Serving Mobile Location Center (SMLC) which contains all LMU data
required to manage location measurements in LMUs.
NOTE 1: A type A LMU is a network entity that shares many of the attributes of
an MS including subscription data in the HLR and identification using an IMSI.
\- Serving Call Session Control Function (S-CSCF) which handles the session
states in the IP Multimedia (IM) Subsystem. Further definition of the S-CSCF
is provided in 3GPP 23.228 [42].
\- SUPL (Secure User Plane Location) Location Platform (SLP) provides user
location information to the ProSe Function. Further information is provided in
3GPP TS 23.303 [98].
\- ProSe Function is the logical function that is used for network related
actions required for Proximity services more details are provided in 3GPP TS
23.303 [98].
\- ProSe Application Server stores EPC ProSe User IDs and ProSe Function IDs
and performs the mapping of Application Layer User IDs and EPC ProSe User Ids
(see 3GPP TS 23.303 [98]).
\- V2X Control Function is the logical function that is used for network
related actions required for V2X services more details are provided in 3GPP TS
23.285 [107].
\- UDM, AMF, SMF, SMSF, AUSF and NEF in 5G System (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [112]
and 3GPP TS 23.502 [113]).
NOTE 2: Whether a node stores data for later usage in the UDR (externally) is
not reflected, the description only reflects that the node holds data
logically. Whether storage of data is performed internally or externally is
out of scope of this specification.
In addition, subscriber data may also be stored in the following functional
unit:
\- Group Call Register (GCR) which contains all data required for
configuration, set-up and handling of voice group and voice broadcast calls.
This encompasses subscribers identities (mobile as well as fixed network) who
are nominated as dispatchers for one or several groups within the area
controlled by the GCR.
NOTE 3: The data stored in the GCR is not strictly \"subscriber data\".
Description of GCR data is therefore out of scope of this specification and is
covered in the corresponding specifications for enhanced Multi Level
Precedence and Pre-emption Service (eMLPP), Voice Group Call Service (VGCS)
and Voice Broadcast Service (VBS) instead (3GPP TS 23.067 [12], 3GPP TS 43.068
[33] and 3GPP TS 43.069 [34]).
NOTE 4: The MME, SGSN and ePDG Emergency Configuration Data, which are applied
for all emergency bearer services, are not subscriber data and therefore out
of the scope of this specification. See 3GPP TS 23.401 [74], 3GPP TS 23.060
[21] and 3GPP TS 23.402 [77].
## 1.3 Subscriber data in other functional units
The individual Subscriber Authentication Key Ki defined in 3GPP TS 43.020 [31]
is stored in the Authentication Centre (AuC); it is also stored in the SIM and
therefore available in the MS. Version numbers of algorithms A3 and A8 may
also be stored in the AuC.
Bootstrapping Server Function (BSF) handles subscriber\'s bootstrapping
information after bootstrapping procedure in Generic Authentication
Architecture (GAA) system. A bootstrapping procedure creates security
association between an UE and a BSF. Using the stored user\'s bootstrapping
information and the security association the BSF can provide security services
to network application functions (NAF) contacted by the UE. Functions of the
BSF are defined in 3GPP TS 33.220 [58] and 3GPP TS 29.109 [59].
NOTE: It is for further study whether or not other types of functional units
containing mobile subscriber parameters are to be included in this
specification. Such units could include encryption key distribution centres,
maintenance centres, etc.
## 1.4 Subscriber data in WLAN-IW functional units
This specification considers subscriber data stored in the following types of
functional unit for I‑WLAN:
\- 3GPP AAA Server which contains all subscriber data necessary to maintain
WLAN Direct IP Access and WLAN 3GPP IP Access.
\- 3GPP AAA Proxy which contains subscriber data necessary to perform AAA
proxy functionality in the VPLMN and to provide charging inter operator
settlement functionality.
\- Packet Data Gateway (PDG) which contains all subscriber data necessary to
manage WLAN 3GPP IP Access tunnels.
\- WLAN Access Gateway (WAG) which contains all subscriber data necessary to
manage a per user firewall between the WLAN-AN and PLMN and to perform per
tunnel charging.
# 2 Definition of subscriber data for CS and PS domain
## 2.1 Data related to subscription, identification and numbering
### 2.1.1 Data defining the subscription profile
#### 2.1.1.1 International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)
International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI) is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003
[5].
IMSI is permanent subscriber data. IMSI is stored in HLR, HSS, CSS, VLR, SGSN,
S4-SGSN, GGSN, MME, S-GW, P-GW, ePDG, SCEF and SMLC. For Anonymous Access,
IMSI is not used in SGSN nor in GGSN. The IMSI serves as the root of the
subscriber data pseudo-tree.
For emergency attached UEs without IMSI (e.g; UICCless UE) or with an
unauthenticated IMSI, IMEI is used instead of IMSI to identify the UE.
#### 2.1.1.2 Network Access Mode (NAM)
The Network Access Mode (NAM) defines if the subscriber is registered to get
access to the CS domain (non-GPRS/EPS), to the PS domain (GPRS/EPS) or to both
domains using 3GPP access networks. NAM describes the first level of the
subscriber data pseudo-tree below the IMSI root. It is permanent subscriber
data stored in the HSS/HLR and the SGSN with the Gs interface option, and the
MME with the SGs interface option.
#### 2.1.1.3 IMSI Unauthenticated indicator
For an emergency attached UE with an unauthenticated IMSI, the IMSI
Unauthenticated indicator is set to reflect that the IMSI is unauthenticated.
See 3GPP TS 23.401 [74], 3GPP TS 23.060 [21] and 3GPP TS 23.402 [77].
The IMSI Unauthenticated indicator is a temporary subscriber data stored in
the MME, S-GW, P-GW, SGSN, S4-SGSN, GGSN and ePDG.
### 2.1.2 Mobile Station International ISDN Number (MSISDN)
Mobile Station ISDN Number (MSISDN) is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
The MSISDN is permanent subscriber data and is conditionally stored in HLR,
VLR, SGSN, GGSN, HSS, MME, S-GW, P-GW, SCEF, 3GPP AAA Server and ePDG(for GTP-
based S2b only), and is optionally stored in CSS. If the multinumbering option
applies, the MSISDN stored in the VLR and in the Gn/Gp-SGSN is the Basic
MSISDN, see clause 2.1.3.1.
### 2.1.3 MSISDNs for multinumbering option
If the HPLMN allocates different MSISDNs for different Basic Services (see
3GPP TS 29.007 [28]), these numbers are conditionally stored as permanent data
in the HLR.
#### 2.1.3.1 The Basic MSISDN indicator
The Basic MSISDN is defined in 3GPP TS 23.012 [8]. The Basic MSISDN indicator
marks the MSISDN to be used as Basic MSISDN.
It is permanent subscriber data stored conditionally in the HLR.
#### 2.1.3.2 The MSISDN-Alert indicator
The MSISDN-Alert is defined in 3GPP TS 23.040 [10]. The MSISDN-Alert indicator
marks the MSISDN to be used as MSISDN-Alert.
It is permanent subscriber data stored conditionally in the HLR.
### 2.1.4 Temporary mobile subscriber identity (TMSI)
Temporary mobile subscriber identity (TMSI) is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
The TMSI is temporary subscriber data and is conditionally stored in the VLR.
### 2.1.5 Packet-Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (P-TMSI)
Packet-Temporary Mobile Subscriber Identity (P-TMSI) is defined in 3GPP TS
23.003 [5]. Its usage is described in 3GPP TS 23.060 [11]. P-TMSI is
accompanied by the P-TMSI Signature, see clause 2.3.7.
The P-TMSI is temporary subscriber data and is conditionally stored in the
SGSN.
### 2.1.6 Temporary Link Layer Identifier (TLLI)
Temporary Link Layer Identifier (TLLI) is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5]. It is
derived from the P-TMSI by the MS and occurs in the variants Local TLLI and
Foreign TLLI. The TLLI is temporary subscriber data and is conditionally

station is deregistered for GPRS or the subscriber has no GPRS subscription in
the HLR. Absence of the SGSN number in the VLR indicates that there is no
association between the VLR and the SGSN for this MS. The SGSN number is to be
distinguished from the SGSN address described in clause 2.13.10.
The SGSN number is temporary subscriber data and is stored in the CSS. Absence
of the SGSN number in the CSS indicates that no subsequent update of the CSG
subscription information is needed at the SGSN upon CSG subscription change.

restrictions apply to the subscription. The parameter takes either of the
following values (see also GSM 02.13 [36]):
\- accessible area for service;
\- all GSM PLMNs;
\- one national and all foreign GSM PLMNs;
\- regionally restricted (part of a GSM PLMN in one country);
\- regionally restricted plus all other GSM PLMNs.
The HLR/HSS associates location updating information with subscription
restriction. It deregisters the MS if the PLMN is not allowed and sets:
\- the MSC area restricted flag if the MSC area is not allowed, see clause
2.4.12;
\- SGSN area restricted flag if the SGSN area is not allowed, see clause
2.4.14.
Handling of Regionally Restricted Subscription is defined in clause 2.4.11. By

### 2.4.11 Regional Subscription Information
If a mobile subscriber has a regional subscription, the HLR/HSS shall store a
list of up to ten Regional Subscription Zone Identities (RSZIs) per Network
Destination Code (NDC) of the PLMN involved. The structure of RSZI is defined
in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5]; since it is composed of the PLMN identification (CC
NDC) and the Zone Code it is sufficient to store the Zone Code List per CC
NDC.
On updating the MME, VLR or the SGSN, the HLR/HSS identifies the VPLMN and NDC
given by the VLR or SGSN number or VPLMN-Id and transfers the pertaining Zone
Code List to the VLR or SGSN or MME. The VLR or SGSN or MME derives from the
Zone Code List the allowed and not allowed MSC or SGSN or MME areas and
location areas; it sets the \"LA not allowed flag\" should the target LAI of
the mobile station be excluded, and it informs the HLR/HSS should the MSC or
SGSN or MME area be excluded. Signalling of cause value \"location area not
allowed\" towards the mobile station is defined in TSs 3GPP TS 29.002 [27] and
3GPP TS 24.008 [26].

\- MSC area not restricted.
The parameter is set in the HLR during updating of the VLR. Handling of
unsupported services and information received from the VLR based on national
roaming or regionally restricted subscription (clause 2.4.11) determine its
value. The parameter contributes to the \"MS Not Reachable\" state for
handling of terminating traffic in the HLR. The default value is \"MSC area
not restricted\".
The MSC area restricted flag is temporary subscriber data and is contained in
the HLR.
### 2.4.13 LA not allowed flag
The LA not allowed flag is set in the VLR depending on National Roaming,
Regionally Restricted Subscription and Roaming Restriction Due To Unsupported
Feature, see 3GPP TS 29.002. It is applied to restrict service on a location
area basis.
The LA not allowed flag is temporary subscriber data stored in the VLR.
### 2.4.14 SGSN area restricted flag
SGSN area restricted flag is a parameter which can take either of the
following values:
\- SGSN area restricted;
\- SGSN area not restricted.
The parameter is set in the HLR during updating of the SGSN. Handling of
unsupported services and information received from the SGSN based on national
roaming or regionally restricted subscription (clause 2.4.11) determine its
value. The parameter contributes to the \"MS Not Reachable\" state for
handling of terminating traffic in the HLR. The default value is \"SGSN area
not restricted\".
The SGSN area restricted flag is temporary subscriber data and is contained in
the HLR.
### 2.4.14a RA not allowed flag

### 2.4.15 Service restriction data induced by roaming
If in the course of roaming or at updating of the VLR or SGSN or MMEthe
HLR/HSS is informed that the VLR or SGSN or MME does not support certain
sensitive services or features, or, the HLR/HSS is informed in data request
that the VLR or the SGSN or the MME supports only specific services, features
or phases which do not correspond to subscribed services, features or phases,
the HLR/HSS takes appropriate measures to restrict service for the mobile
station in that VLR or SGSN or MME by setting and sending network induced
replacing services such as available services, features or phases, barring
programs or the roaming restriction for the MSC or SGSN or MME area.
These network-induced data have to be kept separate in the HLR, and where
possible as discussed below in the VLR, from the permanent subscriber data of
the call barring supplementary services, from the barring related data that
can be modified by the subscriber or from the permanent regional subscription
data.
These network-induced data have to be kept separate in the HLR/HSS, and where
possible as discussed below in the SGSN and MME, from the permanent regional
subscription data.
The network induced data take precedence over the subscriber data of the user
where they are in conflict. If, in the course of roaming, restrictions caused
by a service are lifted, the original subscriber data have to be re-installed
both in HLR, in SGSN, in MME and in VLR when applicable, regarding any
remaining restrictions due to other service replacements.
All network-induced restriction data are temporary subscriber data.
For ODB, 3GPP TS 23.015 [9] recommends mainly barring programs to replace this
feature. The replacing barring data are conditionally stored in the HLR and
VLR. In the VLR they cannot be distinguished from the permanent supplementary
services data with the available signalling means, and no additional storage
is needed. Interrogation shall reflect in both HLR and VLR the valid setting
of the replacing temporary data; to prevent interference with Subscriber
Controlled Input and to inform the customer on the restriction, the \"control
of barring services\" subscription option is also temporarily set to the value
\"by the service provider\".
CUG is also replaced by Outgoing Call Barring as described in 3GPP TS 23.085
[18].
Roaming restriction in the MSC area due to unsupported features is used to
replace AoCC, see 3GPP TS 23.086, and Zone Codes for regional subscription,
see clause 2.4.11 and 3GPP TS 29.002. A flag in the HLR and the VLR, see
clause 2.4.15.2, collects the sources of network-induced roaming restriction
which are also kept separate by the HLR.
Roaming restriction in the SGSN area due to unsupported features is used to
replace Zone Codes for regional subscription, see clause 2.4.11 and 3GPP TS
29.002. A flag in the HLR and the SGSN, see clause 2.4.15.3, collects the
sources of network-induced roaming restriction which are also kept separate by
the HLR.
Roaming restriction in the MME area due to unsupported features is used to
replace Zone Codes for regional subscription, see clause 2.4.11 and 3GPP TS
29.272[81]. A flag in the HSS and the MME, see clause 2.4.15.3a, collects the
sources of network-induced roaming restriction which are also kept separate by
the HSS.
#### 2.4.15.1 ODB-induced barring data
ODB-induced barring data are temporary data stored conditionally in the HLR;
they include the necessary replacing barring programs for outgoing and
incoming calls depending on the ODB profile. The subscription option \"control
of barring services\" is set to \"by the service provider\". The corresponding
barring supplementary services for outgoing calls are set by the HLR and sent
to the VLR.
#### 2.4.15.2 Roaming restriction due to unsupported feature
Roaming restriction due to unsupported feature is a parameter which indicates
that one or several services or features are not supported by the MSC,
resulting in roaming restriction in the MSC area. It can take either of the
following values:
\- roaming restricted;
\- roaming not restricted.
The parameter governs the \"LA not allowed flag\" in the VLR (see clause
2.4.13) and the \"MSC area restricted flag\" in the HLR (see clause 2.4.12);
see also 3GPP TS 29.002.
The flag \"roaming restriction due to unsupported feature\" is temporary
subscriber data stored in the VLR and in the HLR.
#### 2.4.15.3 Roaming restricted in the SGSN due to unsupported feature
Roaming restricted in the SGSN due to unsupported feature is a parameter which
indicates that one or several services or features are not supported by the
SGSN, resulting in roaming restriction in the SGSN area. It can take either of
the following values:
\- roaming restricted;
\- roaming not restricted.
The parameter governs the \"RA not allowed flag\" in the SGSN (see clause
2.4.14a) and the \"SGSN area restricted flag\" in the HLR (see clause 2.4.14);
see also 3GPP TS 29.002.
The flag \"roaming restricted in the SGSN due to unsupported feature\" is
temporary subscriber data stored in the SGSN and in the HLR.
#### 2.4.15.3a Roaming restricted in the MME due to unsupported feature
Roaming restricted in the MME due to unsupported feature is a parameter which
indicates that one or several services or features are not supported by the
MME, resulting in roaming restriction in the MME area. It can take either of
the following values:
\- roaming restricted;
\- roaming not restricted.
The parameter governs the \"TA not allowed flag\" in the MME (see clause
2.4.14b).
The flag \"roaming restricted in the MME due to unsupported feature\" is
temporary subscriber data stored in the MME and in the HSS.

The use of this parameter for LA/RA/TA update procedures is described in 3GPP
TS 23.012 [8], 3GPP TS 23.060 [21], and 3GPP TS 23.401 [74].
### 2.4.19 Selected CN operator ID
The selected CN operator ID indicates which core network operator Network
Sharing supporting UEs have chosen in a shared network. The use of this data
is described in 3GPP TS 23.251 [61]. And this data is identified by a PLMN ID
(MCC+MNC) as described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
The selected CN operator ID is temporary subscriber data stored conditionally
in the VLR and the SGSN in a shared network for non-GPRS and GPRS services
respectively.
This data is also stored in VLR for GPRS services if the Gs inerface is
installed.
### 2.4.20 IP-SM-GW number
The IP-SM-GW number is the E.164 address of the IP-SM-GW.
The IP-SM-GW number indicates the address of the external IP-SM-GW that is
registered for a subscriber to be used for delivering mobile terminated short
messages. The IP-SM-GW number is temporary subscriber data and is stored
conditionally in the HLR. The absence of the IP-SM-GW number in the HLR
indicates that no external IP-SM-GW is registered; in this case an IP-SM-GW
number pre-configured in the HLR can be used as an alternative route for
delivering mobile terminated short messages.
### 2.4.20A IP-SM-GW Diameter Identity
The IP-SM-GW Diameter Identity indicates the Diameter Name and Realm of the
external IP-SM-GW that is registered for a subscriber to be used for
delivering mobile terminated short messages via Diameter. The IP-SM-GW
Diameter Identity is temporary subscriber data and is stored conditionally in
the HSS.
### 2.4.21 Paging Area
As an option, and for paging optimization purpose, the VLR may control Paging
Areas. A Paging Area is a list of up to 5 Location Areas. The structure of the
Location Area is specified in 3GPP TS 29.002 [27]. The Paging Area is
temporary data stored in the VLR and in the HLR.
The use of this data is described in TS 23.012 [8] and in TS 23.018 [70].
### 2.4.22 Closed Subscriber Group Information
If a mobile subscriber has a Closed Subscriber Group (CSG) subscription, the
HLR/HSS shall store Closed Subscriber Group Information which is a list of up
to 50 CSG-Ids per PLMN and for each CSG-Id optionally an associated expiration
date which indicates the point in time when the subscription to the CSG-Id
expires and optionally corresponding APNs which can be accessed via Local IP
access from this CSG identified by the CSG-Id; an absent expiration date
indicates unlimited subscription; an expired expiration date may indicate that
removal of the CSG-Id from the UE (e.g. by OMA DM or OTA update) is pending.
The structure of CSG-Id is defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [5].
On updating the VLR or the SGSN or MME, the HSS/HLR identifies and stores the
VPLMN and the list of equivalent PLMNs provided by the VLR, SGSN or MME, and
transfers the applicable CSG-Ids, expiration dates and the APNs allowed for
LIPA (if present) to the VLR or SGSN or MME.
If an applicable (i.e. applicable for the current serving PLMN) CSG-Id is
added to the Closed Subscriber Group Information in the subscriber data in the
HLR/HSS, or an expiration date for an applicable CSG-Id is changed (added,
modified or removed), or the APNs allowed for LIPA for an applicable CSG-Id is
changed (added, modified or removed), then the HLR/HSS shall transfer
applicable CSG-Ids, expiration dates, and APNs allowed for LIPA to the VLR or
SGSN or MME.
NOTE 1: The APNs allowed for LIPA information are not applicable to the VLR.
When a CSG-Id expires, or the expiration date is changed (added or modified)
to an expired date, the CSG-Id should be removed from the UE (e.g. by OMA DM
or OTA update). After successful removal of the CSG-Id from the UE, the
HLR/HSS should delete the CSG-Id and, if applicable, update the VLR or SGSN or
MME. The two operations may not be correlated in the sense that they may be
performed independently by different systems. The temporal relationship
between the two operations is out scope of this specification and therefore
depends on the operator policy.
If the subscription is terminated by other means than expiry, then CSG-Ids
that are not expired should not be removed at the HLR/HSS; rather the
expiration date may be modified to an expired date.
CSG-Ids that are expired should not be removed from the HLR/HSS before being
removed from the UE.
NOTE 2: In the VLR or SGSN or MME an expired CSG-Id subscription indicates
that the UE is not allowed service in the CSG. However, since the CSG-Id
removal from the UE is pending, the UE may still camp on that CSG and
therefore the UE may still be paged in the CSG.
Closed Subscriber Group Information is permanent subscriber data and is
conditionally stored in HLR/HSS, VLR, SGSN, and MME.
### 2.4.23 Service Centre Address
The Service Centre Address, specified in the 3GPP TS 29.002 [27], represents

### 2.4.26 VPLMN Closed Subscriber Group Information
If the VPLMN supports VPLMN Autonomous CSG Roaming by providing CSG membership
to the roaming subscriber, the CSS shall store Closed Subscriber Group
Information which is a list of up to 50 CSG-Ids in the VPLMN and for each CSG-
Id optionally an associated expiration date which indicates the point in time
when the subscription to the CSG-Id expires; an absent expiration date
indicates unlimited subscription. The structure of CSG-Id is defined in 3GPP
TS 23.003 [5].
NOTE 1: The HPLMN enables Autonomous CSG Roaming in the VPLMN via Service
Level Agreement.
When a CSG-Id expires, or the expiration date is changed (added or modified)
to an expired date, the CSG-Id may be removed from the CSS and the VLR or SGSN
or MME based on implementation.
NOTE 2: In the VLR or SGSN or MME an expired CSG-Id subscription indicates
that the UE is not allowed service in the CSG. However, since the CSG-Id
removal from the UE is pending, the UE may still camp on that CSG and
therefore the UE may still be paged in the CSG.
If the subscription is terminated by other means than expiry, then CSG-Ids
that are not expired should not be removed at the CSS; rather the expiration
date may be modified to an expired date and then be updated by the CSS to the
VLR or SGSN or MME.
VPLMN Closed Subscriber Group Information as described in 3GPP TS 29.002 [27]
and 3GPP TS 29.272 [81] is permanent subscriber data and is conditionally
stored in CSS, VLR, SGSN, and MME.

option is used to indicate that SM shall always be sent via the MSC when the
GMSC does not support the GPRS functionality;
\- transfer of SM via the Gn/Gp-SGSN when GPRS is not supported in the GMSC:
this option is used to indicate that SM shall always be sent via the Gn/Gp-
SGSN when the GMSC does not support the GPRS functionality.
Transfer of SM option is permanent subscriber data stored in HLR for a GPRS
subscription.
The data has an interim nature since in the final solution, the decision on SM
Transfer is taken in the SMS-GMSC.

The HLR column indicates only GPRS related use, i.e. if the HLR uses a
parameter in non-GPRS Network Access Mode but not in GPRS Network Access Mode,
it is not mentioned in this table 5.2.
NOTE 1: This parameter is relevant in the SGSN only when the Gs interface is
installed.
NOTE 2: The VLR column is applicable if Gs interface is installed. It only
indicates GPRS related data to be stored and is only relevant to GPRS
subscribers registered in VLR.
For special condition of storage see in clause 2. See clause 4 for explanation
of M, C, T and P in table 5.2.
