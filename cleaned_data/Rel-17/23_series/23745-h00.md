# 5 Key issues
## 5.1 Key issue 1 - Use of network slicing for FFAPP
3GPP TS 22.104 [3] introduces potential use cases for 5G communication for
automation in factories of the future domain which can be distinguished in
different application areas.
The individual use cases are arranged according to their major performance
requirements and can be classified according to the basic 5G service types
eMBB, mMTC and URLLC.
3GPP TS 23.501[7] define S-NSSAI to identify a Network Slice, an S-NSSAI is
comprised of a Slice/Service type (SST) and a Slice Differentiator (SD). The
SSTs which are standardised as eMBB, URLLC and MIoT. The Factory of the Future
use cases are classified with 5G Slice/Service type (SST) shown in Table
5.1-1.

type (SST)

3GPP TS 22.261 [2] describes the service and operational requirements for a 5G
system which include detail 5G communication for automation requirements in
factories of the future domain. Network slicing is one of the 5G system
capabilities may impact on application layer support for Factories of the
Future.
Open issues：
Are the slicing support functions specified by SA5 and SA2 sufficient for
FFAPP requirements?
## 5.2 Key issue 2 - Geographic location and positioning information support
In 3GPP TS 22.104 [3], some Factories of the Future related typical scenarios
and corresponding high accuracy positioning requirements (horizontal accuracy,
availability, heading, latency and UE speed) were described. Scenario such as
augmented reality in smart factories, inbound logistics for manufacturing
require ms level latency for position estimation of UE.
In 3GPP TS 22.261 [2], positioning service requirements were defined for 5G
system to support those postioning related vertical domian applications
(including Factories of the Future). So far, there are several positioning
methods supported by 5G system with different quality level.
A suitable API was also designed in 5G system to be exposed to an authorised
3^rd^ party to provide the information regarding the availability status of a
geographic location that is associated with that 3^rd^ party.
Open issues:
1) Study is needed to evaluate existing 5G positioning solutions to meet the
positioning requirements of Factories of the Future applications.
2) How to support positioning method with ms-level latency requires further
study?
3) What positioning methods are needed to supply absolute and relative
positioning for different 5G positioning services requires further study.
4) Whether and how SEAL\'s Location Management service can be utilized for
FFAPP\'s location acquisition and location reporting scenarios and also if any
enhancement is required for SEAL\'s Location Management service to support the
same.
## 5.3 Key issue 3 - Clock synchronization
In 3GPP TS 22.104 [3], it is required that 5G system shall support a mechanism
to process and transmit related protocols and support to synchronize a UE\'s
time clock to a global clock or a working clock. Furthermore, 5G system shall
support clock synchronisation defined by IEEE 802.1AS [5] across 5G-based
Ethernet links with PDU-session type Ethernet or other Ethernet transports
such as wired and optical (Ethernet Passive Optical Network). So far, several
options were proposed in 5G system for clock synchronization.
Clock synchronization is needed e.g. for Time Sensitive Communication services
in TSN and non-TSN scenarios. Exposure of 5GS time synchronization
capabilities, e.g. 5GS support for time synchronization, time synchronization
methods and other parameters, can be learned and used by FF UEs and
applications.
**Open issue:**
> a. Further study is required to determine whether and how to manage and
> utilize 5G clock synchronization mechanism according to subclause 5.6.1 and
> 6.2 of 3GPP TS 22.104 [3].
>
> b. Investigate whether and how SEAL should support exposure of clock
> synchronization capabilities.
## 5.4 Key issue 4 - TSN supporting
Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) is an important functionality of industrial
communication networks. Such industrial communication networks are usually
IEEE 802.1-based networks with Ethernet links (non-3GPP network).
5G networks provide advantages for cyber-physical control applications with
respect to flexibility and mobility due to their radio access network with low
latency, high availability, high reliability, and time synchronization
capabilities over wireless links. On the other hand, IEEE-802.1-based TSN
networks provide advantages with wired connectivity for cyber-physical control
applications, especially for demanding real-time control applications and
periodic-deterministic communication, also with very high availability
requirements.
Due to the different pros and cons, many industrial communication networks
will deploy both, non-public 5G networks and IEEE 802.1-based TSN networks. An
integration of 5G networks and IEEE 802.1-based TSN networks is necessary. The
proper integration of 5G networks and TSN networks can also require the
acquisition of service requirements that may not be yet in the scope of the
current 5G QoS framework. One such parameter is the survival time as specified
in 3GPP TS 22.104 [3] which reflects an application\'s resilience to
consecutive transmission failures of the application data. The survival time
which is seen as an application QoS attribute (i.e. service performance
requirement, as specified in TS 22.104 [3]), should be taken into account when
the TSN system provides/adapts the service requirements to the 5GC or the UE,
since this may have impact on the network QoS configuration.
3GPP TS 23.501 [7] describes 5G System features that support Time Sensitive
Communications (TSC) and allow the 5G System to be integrated transparently as
a bridge in an IEEE TSN network. Periodic deterministic QoS feature allows the
5GS to support periodic deterministic communication where the traffic
characteristics are known a-priori, and a schedule for transmission from the
UE to a downstream node, or from the UPF to an upstream node is provided via
external protocols outside the scope of 3GPP (e.g. IEEE TSN).
The features include the following:
\- Providing TSC Assistance Information (TSCAI) that describe TSC flow traffic
patterns at the 5GS egress interfaces
\- Support for hold & forward buffering mechanism in the TSN Translator on the
UE side and UPF side to de-jitter flows that have traversed the 5G System.
For support of integration with TSN, in order to schedule TSN traffic over 5GS
Bridge, the configuration information of 5GS Bridge is mapped to 5GS QoS
within the corresponding PDU Session.
TSN QoS monitoring functionality is described as follows:
1) In control plane, TSN QoS monitoring may interact with TSN AF, NEF and PCF.
2) In data plane, FAE client in the UE may get information from DS-TT
directly.
Open issues：
How to monitor QoS parameters for 5GS Bridge configuration supported by 5GC,
from the application layer of Factories of the Future to assure E2E QoS needs
further study?
How to enable the translation of TSN application QoS requirements (e.g.
survival time) to network QoS parameters, and what would be the impact on 5GS
for QoS enforcement?
## 5.5 Key issue 5 - QoS monitoring
3GPP TS 22.261 [2] describes the QoS monitoring requirements specified for
particular services such as URLLC services, vertical automation communication
services which should be supported by 5G system. The following requirements:
> The 5G network shall provide an interface to application for QoS monitoring
> (e.g. to initiate QoS monitoring, request QoS parameters, events, logging
> information, etc.).
>
> The 5G system shall be able to provide real time QoS parameters and events
> information to an authorised application.
Open issues：
Whether and how to support the QoS monitoring from the application layer of
Factories of the Future based on the 5GC QoS monitoring capabilities?
How to have common QoS monitoring solution for all verticals in SEAL?
## 5.6 Key issue 6 - 5GLAN group management
3GPP TS 22.261 [2] describes 5G LAN-type service and 5GLAN traffic types,
service exposure requirements as follow:
> The 5G system shall support 5G LAN-type service in a shared RAN
> configuration.
>
> The 5G system shall support 5G LAN-type service over a wide area mobile
> network.
>
> The 5G network shall support service continuity for 5G LAN-type service,
> i.e., the private communication between UEs shall not be interrupted when
> one or more UEs of the private communication move within the same network
> that provides the 5G LAN-type service.
>
> The 5G system shall support use of unlicensed as well as licensed spectrum
> for 5G LAN-type services.
>
> The 5G system shall enable the network operator to provide the same 5G LAN-
> type service to any 5G UE, regardless of whether it is connected via public
> base stations, indoor small base stations connected via fixed access, or via
> relay UEs connected to either of these two types of base stations.
>
> The 5G system shall support traffic scenarios typically found in an
> industrial setting (from sensors to remote control, large amount of UEs per
> group) for 5G LAN-type service.
>
> The 5G network shall provide suitable APIs to allow a trusted 3rd party to
> add/remove an authorized UE to/from a specific 5G LAN-VN managed by the
> trusted 3rd party.
3GPP TS 23.501 [7] describes features to support 5G LAN Group Management. 5G
System supports management of 5G VN Group identification and membership (i.e.
definition of 5G VN group identifiers and membership) and 5G VN Group data
(i.e. definition of 5G VN group data). In order to support dynamic management
of 5G VN Group identification and membership, the NEF exposes a set of
services to manage (e.g. add/delete/modify) 5G VN group and 5G VN member. The
NEF also exposes services to dynamically manage 5G VN group data.
3GPP TS 22.104 [3] describes Ethernet applications:
\"This clause lists the requirements applicable to the 5G system for
supporting cyber-physical applications using Ethernet.
For requirements pertaining to common, fundamental Ethernet transport
requirements, and any requirements necessary to support the 5G LAN-type
service, see Clause 6.24 in TS 22.261 [2].\"
The following Ethernet applications requirements:
> For infrastructure dedicated to high performance Ethernet applications, the
> 3GPP system shall support enhancements for time-sensitive networking as
> defined by IEEE 802.1Q [6], e.g. time-aware scheduling with absolute cyclic
> time boundaries defined by IEEE 802.1Qbv [4], for 5G-based Ethernet links
> with PDU sessions type Ethernet.
>
> The Ethernet transport service shall support routing based on information
> extracted from the Ethernet header information created based on 802.1Qbv
> [4].
Open issues for the application layer support of Factories of the Future：
a. How to integrate 5G LAN type service with TSN for group management?
b. Investigate whether and how SEAL Group management service should support
5GLAN group management.
## 5.7 Key Issue 7 - Device Onboarding
Device onboarding is the process by which new devices are connected to the
network for the first time and by which they gain at least the baseline
connectivity and networking services so that they and the applications they
run can boostrap themselves with further network or application layer
procedures.
When done on scale, for instance in a factory environment with a huge number
of different types of devices present, device onboarding needs to be as
automatic as possible. On the other hand, it needs to be secure, authorized
and follow the policies of both the network provider and the organization
deploying the devices.
The overall process of onboarding devices can include the use of tools such as
device management, credentials and subscription management, and network
connectivity management. For many of these solutions and technologies exist.
Open issues:
a. Investigate mechanisms that can improve the overall process of device
onboarding for factories of the future in the scope of SA6 work.
b. Investigate the usage of existing device onboarding technologies, e.g.
oneM2M, GSMA, etc.
c. Investigate whether and how SEAL\'s Identity management service and
Configuration management service can be utilized for device onboarding and
authorization. Also investigate if any enhancements (e.g. considering the
issue described in bullet a) are required in SEAL\'s Identity management
service and Configuration management service to address this scenario.
NOTE: If an existing solution is identified to meet the requirements for this
KI, the usage of that technology will be considered for inclusion in the TR
## 5.8 Key issue 8 - Communication of FF application requirements with 5GS
3GPP TS 22.104 [3] describes a communication service interface (CSIF) for
supporting distributed automation applications. The CSIF is applicable for
several factory automation applications including:
\- Device to Device;
\- Device to Controller and Controller to Device;
\- Controller to Controller;
\- Line Controller to Controller;
\- Device to Cloud;
The 5G system has considered to support all these CSIF patterns and provides
the transport (IP connectivity) to the FFAPP CSIF patterns. The CSIF patterns
may utilize TSN.
The service requirements for different CSIF patterns vary in many aspects,
e.g., packet size, packet transmission interval, reliability, packet loss
rate, etc. And those requirements have to be mapped to 5G system QoS to
guarantee the critical and deterministic communication.
Currently 5GS supports the QoS translation only for TSN networks as specified
in TS 23.501 [7] (via CNC and TSN AF). FF applications can also be deployed in
non-TSN for which the QoS translation is not supported.
Hence, it is required to study the application layer capability to analyze and
communicate the service requirements for different FF applications\' CSIF
patterns to the 5G system.
## 5.9 Key issue 9 - Communication service on the Edge deployments
According to the TS 22.104 [3] clause 5.1, a local approach for the
communication service on the network side is preferred to reduce the latency
(between UE to UE via Uu and UE to network server) or to keep sensitive data
in a non-public network on the factory site.
Open issues：
\- How to support FFAPP communications over Edge deployments on network side?
\- How to support/enable privacy for FFAPP sensitive data over Edge
deployments?
## 5.10 Key issue 10 - Integration with Existing Operation Technologies
In factory floor applications, existing Operation Technologies are already
deployed (e.g. OPC-UA). The 3GPP specified application layer services defined
by SA6 will need to integrate with those existing technologies in order to be
utilized in those deployments.
3GPP TS 22.104 [3] describes a communication service interface (CSIF) for
supporting distributed automation applications. The CSIF is applicable for
several factory automation applications including:
\- Device to Device;
\- Device to Controller and Controller to Device;
\- Controller to Controller;
\- Line Controller to Controller;
\- Device to Cloud;
The 5G system has considered support for all of these CSIF patterns and
provides the transport (IP connectivity) to these CSIF patterns. The CSIF
patterns may utilize TSN for transport capabilities or integrate with existing
OT systems at a higher layer. The existing Operation Technologies include the
capability to meet these CSIF patterns.
It is required to study:
\- The identification of relevant Operation Technologies;
\- The ability to integrate to those identified Operation Technologies;
\- The specifiction of the interaction of SA6-defined application layer
capability with the identified Operation Technologies;
## 5.11 Key issue 11 - QoS coordination
The 5G system provides transport capabilities for different communication
patterns between devices involved in FFAPP applications. Each FFAPP
application may require different QoS considerations from the underlying 5G
system.
The service requirements of FFAPP applications between different devices vary
in many aspects, e.g., packet size, packet transmission interval, reliability,
packet loss rate, etc. Those requirements are determined by the sending party
or the receiveing party.
In current 5G QoS control model, the QoS parameters is preconfigured at PCF or
negotiated between AF and PCF. While, for the device-to-device type of FFAPP
application not based on TSN, there are no means to coordinate these service
requirements to enable QoS on the communications between the devices.
Hence, it is required to study the QoS coordination method to support QoS
based communications for one or more FFAPP applications between the devices
when not using TSN.
## 5.12 Key Issue 12 - User authorization
User\'s consent is an important aspect while dealing with sensitive
information about the user or the devices of the user. With the capabilities
of the FF Application Servers to request invocation of 3GPP network capability
exposure APIs, such as location APIs, to obtain information about the user and
the devices of the user, it is of utmost importance to capture the consent of
the user.
Open issue:
\- Whether and how to obtain user\'s consent to allow an FF Application
specific server\'s service or information request?
Editor\'s Note: The solution for user consent is in the scope of SA3.
## 5.13 Key Issue 13: Capability Exposure related to Private Slice Network
Status
The requirement of capability exposure is specified in subclause 6.10.2 of
3GPP TS 22.261 [2] and analysed in Table 4.1.2-1 in which private slice
network status is required.
Issues include:
\- Whether and how additional service APIs related to private slice network
status are required to be supported at the factories of the future application
enabler layer.
\- Whether and how CAPIF can be leveraged for additional service APIs.
## 5.14 Key Issue 14 -- Device monitoring
In Factories of the Future setting, the application require reliable and
accurate operations from the onboarded devices. Hence, it is required that
each device or group of devices are monitored and any change in its status is
notified to the application layer (e.g. connectivity status, location change).
Further study is required to investigate whether the SEAL service(s) APIs
specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [4] towards the FF application specific layer are
sufficient or additional events (e.g. establishment or change in connectivity,
change in location, availability in group) from FAE layer/SEAL are required.
## 5.15 Key Issue 15 -- Support for group communication
In Factories of the Future setting, large scale of devices are grouped and
multicast/broadcast type group communication operations are required for
application layer operations which can be enabled over different transport
layer (e.g. PC5, Uu).
Currently, 3GPP TS 22.104 [3] has specified requirements for
multicast/broadcast communications on group of UEs. To support FF application
layer for group communication operations, it is required to investigate the
following:
\- Whether and how SEAL network resource management service specified in 3GPP
TS 23.434 [8] can support FF application broadcast/multicast group
communication operations.
\- Whether and how SEAL group management service specified in 3GPP TS 23.434
[8] can support group management capabilities (e.g. create group, group join,
group leave, group delete, group status notification) for FF application
broadcast/multicast group communication operations.
The key issue involving group communication for 5G-LAN is addressed in clause
5.6.
## 5.16 Key Issue 16 -- Constrained devices
Energy efficiency requirements are relevant for battery driven industrial
devices. E.g. industrial wireless sensors can use a wide variety of batteries
depending on the use case, but in general they are highly constrained in terms
of battery size. It is important to analyse what impact the support for the
use of constrained devices may have on the factories of the future
architecture, e.g. whether a SIP- and HTTP-based architecture is suitable for
such devices.
Open issues:
\- Evaluate whether there are any impacts on the factories of the future
architecture because of the use of constrained devices.
\- Determine whether and how SEAL would need to be enhanced to address those
impacts.
## 5.17 Key Issue 17 -- Using 5G CN capabilities for SEAL Groups
Various key issues and solutions of this document, as listed below, illustrate
leveraging SEAL services to fulfil the FF application layer requirements with
assistance of core network.
Key Issues
\- Key issue 6 - 5GLAN group management
\- Key Issue 14 -- Device monitoring
\- Key Issue 15 -- Support for group communication
Solutions
\- Solution #1: FF application layer functional model
\- Solution #7 Geographic location and positioning information support
\- Solution #8: QoS monitoring
\- Solution #9: 5GLAN group management
\- Solution 15: Time Synchronization Management
\- Solution #18: Device monitoring
These solution alternatives require SEAL server\'s interaction with 5GC via
NEF as specified in TS 29.522 [11]. To invoke any NEF/SCEF APIs by the SEAL
layer to fulfill the FF application layer requirements, the SEAL layer needs
to identify the UE or a group of UEs, for which the NEF/SCEF APIs are to be
invoked. SEAL layer can use external identifier of the UE (as specified in
3GPP TS 23.682 [34]) to invoke the NEF/SCEF APIs.
When supported by the SCEF/NEF, the key issues and solutions described above
may be able to invoke the SCEF/NEF APIs. The SCEF/NEF APIs (like Monitoring
API), support \'External Group Identifiers\', as specified in TS 23.682 [34]
(clause 4.6.3), to identify a group of UEs in the request. An External Group
Identifier maps to an IMSI-Group Identifier(s) (defined in TS 23.003 [35])
that are stored in the HSS/UDM. Currently SEAL is not utilizing the 3GPP CN
identification (external group ID) for group of UEs to invoke NEF/SCEF APIs.
Open issue:
\- How SEAL uses external group identifier managed by 3GPP CN for VAL groups
is FFS?
\- Whether current mechanisms provided by 3GPP CN are sufficient to manage
group of FFAPP UEs to enable SEAL to invoke 3GPP CN APIs for the group is FFS.
## 5.18 Key Issue 18 -- Support for Message communication
The MSGin5G Service as specified in 3GPP TS 22.262 [38] has requirements
related to one to one, group and broadcast message services for thing-to-thing
and person-to-thing communication with low end-to-end latency and high
reliability of message delivery, in a resource efficient manner. Further, 3GPP
TR 23.700-24 [39] has defined solutions for these requirements. And 3GPP TS
22.261 [2] also describes similar message communication requirements that are
applicable for FFAPP.
It is required to study following:
\- Whether and how MSGin5G Service communication mechanisms specified in 3GPP
TR 23.700-24 [39] can be leveraged for FFAPP message communication?
Editor\'s note: Considering other messaging mechanisms/services (e.g. OPC UA,
CoAP) is FFS.

# 7 Solutions
## 7.1 Solution #1: FF application layer functional model
### 7.1.1 Solution description
#### 7.1.1.1 General
This solution provides the architecture and functional model required for
addressing the application layer support aspects.
#### 7.1.1.2 FF application layer functional model
Figure 7.1.1.2-1 illustrates the FF application layer functional model.
Figure 7.1.1.2-1: FF application layer functional model
Editor\'s note: How the FF Application server will be represented in the
functional diagram will be considered in normative work
The FF application layer functional entities for the FF UE and the FF
application server are grouped into the FF application specific layer and the
FF Application Enabler (FAE) layer. The FAE layer offers the FAE capabilities
to the FF application specific layer. The FF application specific layer
consists of the FF application specific functionalities.
The FF Application Server (AS) consists of the FAE server and the FF
application specific server(s). The FAE server provides the FF application
layer support functions to the FF application specific server(s) via FAE-S
reference point.
The FF UE consists of the FAE client and the FF application specific
client(s). The FAE client provides the FF application layer support functions
to the FF application specific client(s) via FAE-C reference point.
NOTE 1: The definition of FAE-C reference point is out of scope of the present
document.
In the FAE layer, the FAE client communicates with the FAE server over FAE-1
reference point. In the FF application specific layer, the FF application
specific client(s) communicates with FF application specific server(s) over
FFA-1 reference point.
NOTE 2: The definition of FFA-1 reference point is out of scope of the present
document.
The FAE server interacts with another FAE server over FAE-E reference point.
FAE server (acting as AF) interacts with the 3GPP system (5GS) over N5
reference point as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7]. FAE server interacts with
the 3GPP system (5GS) over N33 reference point as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501
[7]. When CAPIF is supported, the FAE server acts as the API Invoker and
interacts with NEF acting as API provider domain functions and interacts with
CAPIF Core Function, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [16]. When CAPIF is
supported, the FF application specific server acts as the API invoker and
interacts with FAE server and SEAL server(s) where both are acting as API
provider domain functions and interacts with CAPIF Core Function, as specified
in 3GPP TS 23.222 [16].
The FF application specific server(s) and FF application enabler server
consume SEAL services over SEAL-S reference point. The FF application specific
client(s) and FF application enabler client consume SEAL services over SEAL-C
reference point.
The following SEAL services for FF applications are supported:
\- Location management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8];
\- Group management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8];
\- Configuration management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8];
\- Identity management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8];
\- Key management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8]; and
\- Network resource management as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8].
SEAL can further be enhanced to use a new QoS monitoring capability in order
to provide network resource monitoring functionality either as an enhancement
of the Network Resource Management service or as a new Network Resource
Monitoring service via N33. SEAL-S reference point will thus support QoS
monitoring for URLLC services, e.g. TSC services.
SEAL Network Resource Management can further be enhanced to provide Time
Synchronization Management capabilities in its service via N33. SEAL-S
reference point will thus support Time Synchronization Management for URLLC
services supported by 5GS, e.g. for TSC services.
The FAE client interacts with SEAL clients over the SEAL-C reference point
specified for each SEAL service. The FAE server interacts with SEAL servers
over the SEAL-S reference point specified for each SEAL service. The
interaction between a SEAL client and the corresponding SEAL server is
supported by SEAL-UU reference point specified for each SEAL service.
NOTE 3: The SEAL-C, SEAL-S, SEAL-UU reference points for each SEAL service is
specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8].

### 7.1.2 Solution evaluation
This solution provides a viable functional model for FF application
architecture.
## 7.2 Solution #2: Establishing communication with FF application service
requirements
### 7.2.1 Solution description
This solution corresponds to the key issue #8 on communication of FF
application requirements with 5GS and key issue#11 on QoS coordination.
In this solution, a FAE client and FAE server (acting as an AS) are involved
in the exchange and analysis of the desired service requirements (e.g. packet
size, packet transmission interval, reliability, packet loss rate) for the
communication amongst the FF application UEs when not using TSN. The FAE
server triggers the establishment of direct service connectivity based on the
information provided by the UEs and static configuration information available
to the FAE server prior to the UE interaction. Note that service connectivity
among FF application specific clients is established over the FFA-2 reference
point, without device-to-device direct radio connectivity (e.g. PC 5)
requirement.
The procedure for establishing FFA-2 service communication with FF application
service requirements is as illustrated in figure 7.2.1‑1.
Pre-condition:
\- FAE client 1 and FAE client 2 are provided configuration information for
the FF application specific clients served e.g. connectivity requirements,
which destination UEs to connect to over FFA-2, etc.
\- The FAE client 1 and FAE client 2 are configured with the information of
the FAE server and have connectivity enabled to communicate with the FAE
server. The information is provided via pre-configuration.
\- The FAE server is configured with policies and information of the UEs to
determine authorization of the UEs requesting connectivity via FFA-2.
\- The FF application specific clients associated with FAE client 1 and FAE
client 2 have triggered the establishment of connectivity.
Figure 7.2.1-1: Establishing communication with FF application service
requirements
1a. The FAE client 1 sends the FFAPP connectivity request (source identity and
IP address, destination identities, service requirements) to the FAE Server.
The service requirement from the source includes packet size, packet
transmission interval, packet processing latency, allowed packet loss
rate/packet loss amount/packet error rate, etc. The destination may be
multiple UEs (devices). The identity of source and destination may be the
application user identity or the MAC address.
1b. The FAE server determines whether the UE of FAE client 1 is authorized to
connect to the destination UEs for direct service communications over FFA-2.
If UE of FAE client 1 is authorized to connect to the destination UEs, then a
response is provided to the FAE client 1 indicating acceptance of the
request.2a. The FAE client 2 sends the FFAPP connectivity request (destination
identity and IP address, source identity, service requirements) to the FAE
server. The service requirements from the destination includes the transport
latency of the packet, processing latency at the destination.
2b. The FAE server determines whether the UE of FAE client 2 is authorized to
connect to the destination UEs for direct service communications over FFA-2.
If UE of FAE client 2 is authorized to connect to the destination UEs, then a
response is provided to the FAE client 2 indicating acceptance of the request.
3\. Based on the service requirements received in step 1 and step 2, the FAE
server determines the parameters and patterns for direct service connectivity
between the UEs (i.e. FFA-2 connectivity) and also the transport requirements,
i.e., QoS requirements for the 3GPP system (e.g. 5GS). This step may also
include retrieving the direct link status of the UEs (e.g. PDU Session Status,
UE reachability, etc. as described in 23.502 [12]). If the FAE server
determines that direct service connectivity is not authorized or not possible
with the given connectivity requirements, it skips step 4 and proceeds to
steps 5 and 6, informing each FAE client accordingly.
NOTE 1: FAE server will process E2E connectivity establishment between FAE
client 1 and FAE client 2 only after it receives the request from FAE client
2. There can be several FAE clients (destinations) which will perform step 2
and FAE server will process their E2E connectivity with FAE client 1 (source)
as and when the requests are received by the FAE server.
NOTE 2: The FAE server can determine the priority of the E2E connections
between FAE client 1 (source) and one or more FAE client 2 (destination) using
the service requirements provided to the FAE server by the FAE clients.
4\. The FAE server triggers 3GPP system to establish FFA-2 connectivity
between the UE of FAE client 1 and UE of FAE client 2 with required QoS as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7].
5\. The FAE server sends the FFAPP connectivity notification
(connectivity/session information) to FAE client 1 indicating successful
establishment of the connectivity. The connectivity/session information may
contain the accepted destination identities.
6\. The FAE server sends the FFAPP connectivity notification
(connectivity/session information) to FAE client 2 indicating successful
establishment of the connectivity.
### 7.2.2 Solution evaluation

requirement communication and QoS coordination. The solution#2 is a viable
technical solution.
## 7.3 Solution #3: Support UE to UE direct communication in FF application
layer
### 7.3.1 Solution description
Figure 7.3.1-1 illustrates the FF function model to support UE to UE
communication in application layer without FF Application Server.
Figure 7.3.1-1: Functional model to support UE to UE direct communication in
FF application layer
In order to support FF UE x direct communication to FF UE y in application
layer without involvment of FF Application Server, FF application specific
client x (which resides on FF UE x) will directly interact with FF application
specific client y (which resides in FF UE y) via FFA-2 reference point and the
FAE client x (which resides on FF UE x) will directly interact with FAE y
(which resides in FF UE y) via FAE-2 reference point.
Note 1: FFA-2 and FAE-2 reference point defined here is Uu interface over 5GS.
Note 2: The defintion of FFA-2 reference point is out of scope of the present
document.

Edge deployments.
At UE side, FAE client interacts with the Edge Enabler client via EDGE-5
reference point which described in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10].
In Edge Data network, FAE server interacts with the Edge Enabler Server via
EDGE-3 reference point which described in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10].
### 7.5.2 Solution evaluation

considering edge enabler layer.
## 7.6 Solution #6: Provisioning of FFAPP within Edge Data Network
configuration
### 7.6.1 Solution description
This solution corresponds to the key issue #9 - communication service on the
Edge deployments.
The procedure of FFAPP provisioning with Edge Data Network deployment is
described as below:
\- Pre-condition:
> The FAE client registered to Edge Enabler client. The FAE Server configured
> with the FF Application Specific Server. The FAE client configured with the
> FF Application Specific Client; The FAE client registered on the FAE Server
> with default configuration is optional;
>
> 1\. The FAE client sends the FFAPP Application Client Profile request to the
> Edge enabler client via EDGE-5 reference point with related information
> needed by EEC (which will be defined in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10]).
>
> 2\. The Edge enabler client will execute the Edge Data Network Configuration
> provisioning procedure and EAS discovery procedure to get related response
> information according to the specification of 3GPP TS 23.558 [10].
>
> 3\. The Edge enabler client on UE sends response information (for example:
> address of FAE server located in Edge data network) to the FAE client via
> EDGE-5 reference point. (The response information over EDGE-5 should be
> defined in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10] and is out of scope of this study.)
Editor\'s Note: The usage of Edge computing services for FFAPP is FFS.
### 7.6.2 Solution evaluation
This solution partly addresses the service provisioning and discovery in EDGE
deployment, further work is required to solve the EN in clause 7.6.1.
## 7.7 Solution #7 Geographic location and positioning information support
### 7.7.1 General
FF UE may use non-3GPP positioning technologies such as GNSS (e.g. Beidou,
Galileo, GLONASS, and GPS), Terrestrial Beacon Systems (TBS), sensors (e.g.
barometer, IMU), WLAN/Bluetooth-based positioning to get the non-3GPP
positioning information.
The FAE capabilities (FAE client and FAE server) can utilize location
management (e.g. network location of UEs) service procedures of SEAL to
support FF services.
### 7.7.2 Usage of SEAL location management Information flows

### 7.7.4 Enhancements to SEAL location management Information flows
To enable negotiation of positioning method, the location reporting
configuration request and location reporting configuration response need to be
enhanced as follows:
Table 7.7.4-1, which is based on Table 9.3.2.0-1 in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8],
describes the information flow from the location management client to the
location management server for requesting the location reporting
configuration.
Table 7.7.4-1: Location reporting configuration request
* * *
Information element Status Description Identity M Identity of the VAL user or
identity of the VAL UE. Supported positioning methods O Provides positioning
methods supported the VAL UE like non-3GPP positioning technologies such as,
GNSS (e.g. Beidou, Galileo, GPS, Glonass), Network-based Assisted GNSS and
High-Accuracy GNSS, Terrestrial Beacon Systems, dead-reckoning sensors (e.g.
IMU, barometer), WLAN/Bluetooth-based positioning
* * *
Table 7.7.4-2, which is based on Table 9.3.2.1-1 in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8],
describes the information flow from the location management server to the
location management client for the location reporting configuration.
Table 7.7.4-2: Location reporting configuration response
+---------------------------+------------+---------------------------+ | Information element | Status | Description | +---------------------------+------------+---------------------------+ | Identity | M | Identity of the VAL user | | | | or VAL group to which the | | | | location reporting | | | | configuration is targeted | | | | or identity of the VAL | | | | UE. | +---------------------------+------------+---------------------------+ | Requested location | O (NOTE 1) | Identifies what location | | information | | information is requested | +---------------------------+------------+---------------------------+ | Triggering criteria | O (NOTE 1) | Identifies when the | | | | location management | | | | client will send the | | | | location report | +---------------------------+------------+---------------------------+ | Minimum time between | O (NOTE 1) | Defaults to 0 if absent | | consecutive reports | | otherwise indicates the | | | | time interval between | | | | consecutive reports | +---------------------------+------------+---------------------------+ | Preferred positioning | O (NOTE 2) | Provides the Location | | method | | Management Server | | | | preferred positioning | | | | method to be used by the | | | | Location Management | | | | Client. | +---------------------------+------------+---------------------------+ | NOTE 1: If none of the | | | | information element is | | | | present, this represents | | | | a cancellation for | | | | location reporting. | | | | | | | | NOTE 2: If \"Supported | | | | position methods\" is | | | | present in the Location | | | | reporting configuration | | | | request, then \"Required | | | | positioning method\" | | | | shall be one of the | | | | supported method. | | | +---------------------------+------------+---------------------------+
Editor\'s note: How location management server can determine preferred
positioning method and provide required location reporting accuracy and other
KPIs to location management client are FFS.
SEAL LM function supports to interact with 3GPP Core Network over T8 reference
point as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8], clause 9.2.2. With the 5GC unified
location service described in 3GPP TS 23.273 [36], the SEAL LM architecture
can be enhanced to support T8/N33 reference point so that the 5GC specific
location management procedure can be utilized.
The SEAL LM service can expose the desired location quality of service to the
Vertical domain users (e.g. FF application specific server). In addition, the
SEAL can also utilize the non-3GPP positioning to report more accurate
location to the Vertical domain users (e.g. FF application specific server).
The SEAL LM procedures and information flows in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8] can be
enhanced (highlighted in **_bold italics_**) as follows:

### 7.7.5 Solution evaluation
This solution utilizes and enhances the SEAL location management service to
support FFAPP geographic location and high accuracy positioning requirements.
This solution does not support positioning method with ms-level latency and
absolute and relative positioning which listed in open issues of Key issue 2.
## 7.8 Solution #8: QoS monitoring
### 7.8.1 Solution description
This solution addresses Key issue 5 - QoS monitoring.
QoS monitoring is a critical requirement for many FF applications.
The issue to address here via the NEF, according to the procedures defined in
3GPP TS 23.502 [12] clause 4.15. NEF supports APIs of exposure of network
events, analytics for QoS monitoring.
The detail procedures over **NEF Northbound** Interface are defined in 3GPP TS
29.522 [11] clause 4.4:

2\. The FF UE has an established connection to 5G network.
The procedure for QoS monitoring is illustrated in figure 7.8.1.1-1.
Figure 7.8.1.1-1: QoS monitoring procedures
1\. The FF application specific server sends a QoS monitoring subscribe
request to the FAE server.
2\. The FAE server interacts with NEF to subscribe to QoS monitoring events,
including:
\- QOS_MONITORING, supported by AsSessionWithQoS API of 3GPP TS 29.522 [11]
\- QOS_SUSTAINABILITY, supported by AnalyticsExposure API API of 3GPP TS
29.522 [11]

### 7.8.2 Solution evaluation
This solution is technically viable as it reuses capabilities already defined
and no new requirements related to that functionality have been identified. It
is recommended to use a common solution for QoS monitoring in SEAL.

\- Configure VAL group from the FAE server to the group management server with
Configure VAL group request and Configure VAL group response
#### 7.9.1.4 Required SEAL group management enhancements
SEAL group management server shall enable a VAL server (FAE server) to create,
update, delete, subscribe to changes of a 5GLAN group. 5GLAN group is defined
in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7]. The SEAL group management client and the VAL server
shall be able to identify that a group managed by the SEAL server is used for
5G LAN-Type service.
For group management procedures pertaining to a 5GLAN group the SEAL group
management server shall use dynamic 5G VN group management procedures exposed
by NEF via the N33 reference point, as specified in TS 23.501 [7] clause
5.29.2 and in TS 23.502 [12] clause 4.15.6.
5GLAN (also referred to as 5G VN) group data is specified in TS 23.502 [12]
clauses 4.15.6.3b and 4.15.6.3c. The SEAL group management server shall use
the VAL service identity to derive the 5G VN group data such as DNN, S-NSSAI,
etc.
The SEAL group management may use the procedures of the event monitoring of
PDN Connectivity Status specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [12] clause 4.15.3.2.3 to
keep track of the connectivity status of the group member UEs, e.g. to detect
VAL UE registration/de-registration to/from the group.
#### 7.9.1.5 5GLAN group creation and join procedure
This procedure is based on the Group announcement and join procedure in 3GPP
TS 23.434 [8] clause 10.3.8. In this procedure the VAL server is composed of
the FAE server and the FF application specific server.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The SEAL group management clients, SEAL group management server, VAL
server and the VAL clients belong to the same VAL system.
2\. The VAL server is aware of the users\' identities and is authorized to
form a VAL group for 5G LAN-Type communication.
3\. The VAL clients (at the VAL UEs) belong to the same 5GLAN (5G-VN) group.
Figure 7.9.1.5-1: Procedure for creating a VAL group for 5G LAN-Type
communication.
1\. The VAL server determines group information and the identity list to which
the group announcement shall be sent. The decision can be based on the list of
authorized UEs and other criteria such as requirement for 5G LAN-Type
communication service.
2\. The VAL server requests the SEAL group management server to configure a
new VAL group for 5G LAN-Type communication service providing a VAL Group ID,
a list of VAL UEs and a list of VAL services.
3\. The SEAL group management server creates an empty group and determines
that the group is for 5G LAN-Type communication, based on the information
provided in the Configure VAL group request. The SEAL group management server
determines 5GLAN group data for the VAL server.
4\. The SEAL group management server creates a 5GLAN group in the 5GS via N33
using the dynamic group management procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7]
clause 5.29.2 and 3GPP TS 23.502 [12] clause 4.15.6. The 5GS delivers 5G VN
group configuration information (DNN, S-NSSAI, PDU session type) to the VAL
UEs for each GPSI that belongs to the 5GLAN group. The 5G VN group
configuration information is delivered in the UE Route Selection Policy (URSP)
from the 5GS to the VAL UEs using the UE Configuration Update procedure for
transparent UE Policy delivery as described in TS 23.502 [12] clause 4.2.4.3.
5\. The SEAL group management server may subscribe to PDN Connectivity Status
events via N33 using the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [12] clause
4.15.3.2.3 in order to be notified of the connectivity status of the VAL UEs
of the 5GLAN group.
NOTE 1: The SEAL group management server may use PDN Connectivity Status
events e.g. to determine VAL UE\'s registration state in the group.
6\. The SEAL group management server announces the VAL group to the SEAL group
management client at the VAL UEs, including the DNN and communication type (IP
or Ethernet) corresponding to the 5GLAN group,
NOTE 2: The SEAL group management server can decide to use the Application
Trigger service provided by the NEF described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [12] clause
5.2.6.5 for group announcement to the group management client or to use the
group announcement already specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8].
7\. The SEAL group management client in the VAL UEs determines the group to be
a 5GLAN group and triggers establishment of a PDU session corresponding to the
5GLAN group.
8\. If the SEAL group management server subscribed to PDN Connectivity Status
events in step 5, it is notified once the VAL UE establishes a PDU session to
the 5GLAN group. Receiving this event is sufficient for the SEAL group
management server to determine that the VAL UE is a member of the group.
9\. The SEAL group management client at the VAL UEs registers to VAL group
communication using the VAL Group ID.
10 The SEAL group management server records the users who have registered to
be the members of the group.
NOTE 3: Step 10 may occur as a result of Step 8.
11\. The SEAL group management server sends a VAL group registration response
to the SEAL group management clients.
12\. The SEAL group management server sends a configure VAL group response to
the VAL server.
NOTE 4: Step 12 may occur any time after Step 6.
13\. The SEAL group management server sends identity list notification about
the newly registered users. The SEAL group management client in the VAL UEs
may inform the VAL client about the updated identity list.
### 7.9.2 Solution evaluation
This solution provides enhancements to the SEAL group management service to
handle 5GLAN groups based on 5G core network capabilities already specified in
Rel-16 3GPP TS 23.501 [7] and Rel-16 3GPP TS 23.502 [12]. This solution
addresses the gaps described in key issue #6.
## 7.10 Solution #10: QoS monitoring for TSC services
### 7.10.1 Solution description
This solution addresses KI#5 on QoS monitoring.
Monitoring of QoS for time sensitive communication (TSC) services is a
critical requirement for many FF applications.
QoS monitoring to assist URLLC is specified in clause 5.33.3 of TS 23.501 [7],
with per flow monitoring mechanism specified in clause 5.33.3.2.
The issue to address here is whether the QoS monitoring capabilities provided
by the NEF should be used by the FAE layer directly or via the Service Enabler
application layer (SEAL), as according to the concepts defined in 3GPP TS
23.434 [8]. Due to the fact that QoS monitoring is not specific to FF
applications but applicable for wider range of vertical applications, it is
more suitable to enhance SEAL to support this functionality.
SEAL Network Resource Management service enabler specifies APIs to request
reservation, modification, and release of network resources, including QoS
resources, see clause 14 in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8] and clause 5.5 in 3GPP TS
29.549 [14]. It is therefore proposed to enhance the Network Resource
Management service enabler with the QoS monitoring functionality.
The SEAL Network Resource Management server interacts with NEF via N33 to
obtain the relevant QoS monitoring information from the 5GS.
### 7.10.2 Subscribe/unsubscribe to/from QoS monitoring events for an
established connection
The procedure to subscribe/unsubscribe to/from QoS monitoring events is shown
in figure 7.10.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The FF UE has an established connection in the 5GS
Figure 7.10.2-1: Subscribe/unsubscribe QoS monitoring procedures
1\. The FF application specific server sends a QoS monitoring subscribe
request to the SEAL NRM server either in conjunction with a request for
network resources requiring QoS or when the QoS connection is already
established.
2\. The SEAL NRM server interacts with the NEF to establish a QoS monitoring
subscriptions. The NRM server uses the NEF procedures for the AFsessionWithQoS
described in clause 5.2.6.9 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [12] and the NEF procedures for
the AnalyticsExposure described in clause 5.2.6.16 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [12] and
in particular the UE Communication Analytics (see clause 6.7.3 of 3GPP TS
23.288 [19]). In those interactions the SEAL NRM server determines QoS
parameters to be measured (e.g. DL, UL or round trip packet delay, UL/DL data
rate, traffic volume), including, but not limited:
\- frequency of reporting (event triggered, periodic, or when the PDU Session
is released):
a) if the reporting frequency is event triggered:
> i) the corresponding reporting threshold to each QoS parameter;
>
> ii) minimum waiting time between subsequent reports;
b) if the reporting frequency is periodic, the reporting period.
3\. The SEAL NRM server sends a QoS monitoring subscribe response to the FF
application specific server.
4\. When QoS monitoring event is triggered and the SEAL NRM server is notified
by the NEF. The SEAL NRM server may coordinate and combine the information
from the NEF notifications before sending a notification to the FF application
specific server.
5\. The SEAL NRM server notifies the FF application specific server about the
QoS monitoring event.
NOTE: Steps 4 and 5 are repeated when QoS monitoring events occur.
6\. When the FF application specific server decides to unsubscribe for the QoS
monitoring, the FF application specific server sends a QoS monitoring
unsubscribe request to the SEAL NRM server.
7\. The SEAL NRM server interacts with the NEF to terminate the related QoS
monitoring subscriptions.
8\. The SEAL NRM server sends a QoS monitoring unsubscribe response to the FF
application specific server.
### 7.10.3 Solution evaluation
This solution enhances the SEAL Network Resource Management service enabler
with QoS monitoring and uses the exposure of QoS monitoring procedures
provided via NEF as already specified in Rel-16. It provides common support
for QoS monitoring for FFAPP and other verticals. It is a technically viable
solution to address KI #5.
## 7.11 Solution #11: Establishing communication connectivity between FF
Application Specific Clients with FF application service requirements
### 7.11.1 Solution description
This solution corresponds to the key issue #8 on communication of FF
application requirements with 5GS and key issue#11 on QoS coordination.
In this solution, a FAE client and FAE server (acting as an AS) exchange
context information allowing for the desired service requirements (e.g. data
rate) for the communication amongst the FF application specific clients to be
derived. The FAE server adaptively triggers retrieval of context and
establishment of direct service connectivity, e.g. when the two UEs are close
to each other. Note that service connectivity among FF application specific
clients is established over the FFA-2 reference point, without device-to-
device direct radio connectivity (e.g. PC 5) requirement.
The procedure for establishing FFA-2 service communication with FF application
specific clients service requirements provided via the FAE Clients is as
illustrated in figure 7.11.1‑1.
Pre-conditions:
\- FAE client 1 and FAE client 2 are provided configuration information for
the FF application specific clients served e.g. connectivity requirements,
etc.
\- FAE client 1 and FAE client 2 are configured with the information of the
FAE server and have registered (e.g. using clause 7.4 procedures). The
information is provided via pre-configuration or registration to the FAE
server includes FAE client capabilities, security information, etc. Upon
registration, FAE client 1 and FAE client 2 subscribe to connectivity
notifications.
\- Pre-processing determines that connectivity between FF application specific
client 1 to FF application specific client 2 via the FFA-2 reference point is
required. Service requirements and destination information for this connection
have been provided, e.g. via discovery.
NOTE: The preconditions above rely upon procedures (e.g. registration,
discovery) detailed as part of other solutions.
Figure 7.11.1-1: Establishing communication connectivity between FAE Clients
with FF application service requirements
1\. The FAE Client 1 sends the FFAPP connectivity request (source identity and
IP address, destination identities, service requirements) to the Future
Factory Enabler Server (FAE server) to establish connectivity for FF
application specific client 1 on UE 1. The destination FF application specific
client(s) may be hosted on one or multiple UEs (devices). The identity of the
source and of the destination may be provided as the application user identity
or the MAC address.
2\. The FAE server determines whether FF application specific client 1 is
authorized to connect to FF application specific client 2 for direct service
communications over FFA-2. If FF application specific client 1 is authorized
to connect to FF application specific client 2, the FAE server contacts the
FAE client 2 to retrieve its FF application specific client 2 context
information. This step can be skipped if the FAE server is already aware of FF
application specific client 2\'s context information.
> Editor\'s Note: It is FFS how FAE server determines whether FF application
> specific client 1 is authorized to connect to FF application specific client
> 2 for direct service communications over FFA-2.
3\. The FAE client 2 determines whether context information is to be provided
for establishing connectivity for FF application specific 2 to FF application
specific 1. FAE client 2 makes this determination based on FF application
specific client 1 information provided in the request, pre-provisioned
information (e.g. policies) and its context (e.g. location, time, etc.) If FAE
client 2 determines that context information is to be provided, it responds to
FAE server and includes the context information for FF application specific
client 2.
NOTE: The signaling and functionality for handling the cases when FAE client 2
will be temporarily unavailable for establishing the direct service connection
are implementation dependant.
4\. The FAE server responds to the FFAPP connectivity request in step 1.
5\. The FAE server retrieves location information of UE 1 and UE 2 hosting the
two FF application specific clients respectively. This step may also include a
request for direct link status (e.g. PDU Session Status, UE reachability, etc.
as described in 23.502 [12]). This step may be skipped if the FAE server is
already aware of UE 1\'s and UE 2\'s location information or if there are no
location requirements for establishing the FF application specific client 1 to
FF application specific 2 direct service connectivity.
NOTE: If SEAL is used, location information may be obtained from the SEAL
location management server. Alternatively, Location Reporting monitoring as
described in 23.502[12] may be used.
6\. The FAE server takes FF application specific client 1\'s and FF
application specific client 2\'s context information, their connectivity
requirements, location information, and network context as input, checks
connectivity service policies, and determines the parameters and patterns for
direct service connectivity between the FF application specific clients (i.e.
FFA-2 connectivity). The FAE server may also determine transport requirements,
e.g. QoS requirements, for the 3GPP system (e.g. 5GS).
If the FAE server determines that direct service connectivity is not possible
with the given connectivity requirements, it skips step 7 and proceeds to
steps 9 and 10, informing each FAE client accordingly. If the FAE server
determines that direct service connectivity is not authorized or not possible
with the given connectivity requirements, it skips step 7 and proceeds to
steps 9 and 10, informing each FAE client accordingly.
7\. The FAE server may request the 3GPP system to establish or modify the 3GPP
system level connectivity that enables the application connection between FF
application specific client 1 and FF application specific client 2 e.g. via
modification of existing radio bearers. FAE server provides the necessary
information (e.g. identifiers of FF application specific client 1 and FF
application specific client 2, transport requirements) in this request
message.
> Editor\'s Note: If SEAL is used, the procedure for communicating FF
> application service requirements from FAE server to the 3GPP system may
> utilize enhanced NRM server functionality. It is FFS whether NRM server
> functionality may be enhanced to support translating FF application service
> requirements to 3GPP network requirements.
8\. The FAE server receives a response from the 3GPP system indicating whether
the requested connectivity in Step 6 has been successfully established or
modified.
9\. The FAE server notifies FAE client 1 of the established connection
including its properties such as a FFA-2 direct service connection identifier,
duration, etc.
10\. The FAE server notifies the FAE client 2 of the established connection
including its properties such as a FFA-2 direct service connection identifier,
duration, etc.
> Editor\'s Note: Traffic routing between FAE client 1 and FAE client 2 over
> FFA-2 is FFS.
### 7.11.2 Solution evaluation
This is a viable technical solution for key issue #8 and key issue #11. The
FAE server translates the FF application specific requirements for
connectivity to the 3GPP network based on FAE client requests.
## 7.12 Solution #12: Private Slice
### 7.12.1 Solution description
#### 7.12.1.1 General
This solution corresponds to the Key issue #1 - Use of network slicing for
FFAPP and Key Issue 13: Capability Exposure related to Private Slice Network
Status.
3GPP TS 22.261 [2] defines private slice is a dedicated network slice
deployment for the sole use by a specific third-party and describes to operate
a hosted non-public network and private slice(s) of its PLMN associated with
the hosted non-public network in a combined manner. It meanings that private
slice is belong to PLMN.
3GPP TS 22.261 [2] specifies that the 5G network shall provide suitable APIs
to allow a trusted third-party to get the network status information of a
private slice dedicated for the party, e.g. the network communication status
between the slice and a specific UE.
3GPP TS 23.501 [7] defines the 5G System architecture and high level features,
which not includes specific solution or feature for private slice.
3GPP TS 28.541 [17] specifies the Information Model and Solution Set for the
Network Resource Model (NRM) definitions of NR, NG-RAN, 5G Core Network (5GC)
and network slice, which not includes specific Information Model and Solution
Set for private slice.
3GPP SA2 has already start study on enhanced support of non-public networks
and enhancement of network slicing in Release 17, which not includes specific
solutions for private slice.
Currently, the solution for private slice is no different with other network
slices.
SA2 defines network slice information (Slice load level related network data
analytics, UE Communication Analytics which defined in 3GPP TS 23.288 [19])
exposed by NEF through AnalyticsExposure API which defined in 3GPP TS 29.522
[11].
Network slice information also can through SA5 NMS to get, monitor, config.
Exposure governance management function (EGMF) in 3GPP TS 28.533 [18] is
management function in network function model with the role of management
service exposure governance, it is similar as NEF.
Expose Network slice information is a common functionality for all verticals
(and not only V2X and FF), so SEAL should to enhance to support.
The FAE server can utilize Network Resource Management of SEAL to support to
get the network status information of a private slice (e.g. the network
communication status between the slice and a specific UE). Which needs to
enhance the existing Network Resource Management service enabler by adding
acquirement of private slice network status information through NEF
AnalyticsExposure API or Exposure Governance Management Function (EGMF) by
3^rd^ party (e.g. from vertical industry) which defined in 3GPP TS 28.533
[18].
NOTE 1: How SEAL support NEF is out of scope of the present document.
NOTE 2: How SEAL support EGMF is out of scope of the present document, the
solution is in the scope of SA5 and SEAL. Details of EGMF management
capability exposure governance in 3GPP TS 28.533 [18] is FFS by SA5.
#### 7.12.1.2 Acquirement of private slice network status information
procedure
The procedure for acquirement of private slice network status information is
illustrated in figure 7.12.1.2-1.
Figure 7.12.1.2-1: Acquirement of private slice network status information
procedures
1\. The FF application specific server sends an Acquire private slice network
status information request to the FAE server.
2\. The FAE interacts with the SEAL Network Resource Management server to
acquire private slice network status information. The SEAL Network Resource
Management server acquires private slice network status information,
including, but not limited:
> a) The SEAL Network Resource Management server interacts with NEF by
> AnalyticsExposure API to fulfil the operation (not shown in the sequence).
> In that interaction the SEAL NRM server acquirement private slice network
> status information (e.g. slice specific UE_COMM as described in 3GPP TS
> 29.522 [11]).
>
> b) The SEAL Network Resource Management server interacts with EGMF to fulfil
> the operation (not shown in the sequence). In that interaction the SEAL NRM
> server acquirement private slice network status information (e.g.
> pduSessionType, NetworkSlice as described in 3GPP TS 28.541 [17]).
3\. The FAE server sends an Acquire private slice network status information
response to the FF application specific server.
NOTE 3: How FAE interacts with the SEAL Network Resource Management server is
out of scope of the present document, the solution need SEAL further study.
Editor\'s note: whether NRM server or a new SEAL service is required to
support slice status reporting is FFS.
### 7.12.2 Solution evaluation
This solution depends on how SEAL to support NEF or EGMF and acquire private
slice network status information. The specification of such a mechanism,
therefore, will be required to be used as the baseline when the solution
described in this clause is addressed during the normative work.
## 7.13 Solution #13: Application-triggered slice re-mapping for FF
applications
### 7.13.1 Solution description
This solution provides a mechanism for enabling the FAE server to translate
the adaptation of the service requirements / profile, as triggered by the FF
application specific server or client, to a network slice re-mapping.
#### 7.13.1.1 General
This solution provides a mechanism to allow the FAE server to perform slice
re-mapping for a FF application and the involved UEs, as triggered by a change
of the application requirements. This mechanism assumes that the GST
parameters and the per UE slice subscriptions (running the FF application) are
known at the FAE server by OAM (according to TS 28.533 [18] slice management
information can be exposed to 3^rd^ party via EGMF).
The trigger for the mapping is the FF application specific server (or FAE
client) request to FAE server for a new service profile (e.g. URLLC, eMBB,
MIoT) for the FF application. This may be for example, due to change of
communication model, Remote vs Local C2C, one or more UEs moving to an area
where current service requirements need to be change, different FF application
to service mapping, etc.
The FAE server determines an application to slice mapping, based on the
requested service profile, the slice capabilities, the UE subscriptions and
the GST parameters (these are assumed to be available at the by OAM). The FAE
server sends to the SEAL/NRx server the (re-) mapping required to a different
slice; and SEAL/NRx server in-turn provides an AF request to re-map the users
within the FF application to different slice, by triggering the update of the
UE policies.
#### 7.13.1.2 Procedure
Pre-condition1: Slice#1 and Slice#2 have already been established. UEs of
App#A have registered with the network and connected to Slice#1 (based on the
URSP rules which are configured to the UE by the PCF (TS 23.501 [7], 23.503
[15])).
Pre-condition 2: Slice information, such as GST parameters and slice
subscriptions are received at the FAE server by the OAM (by consuming
Management APIs via EGMF, as in TS 28.533 [18]).
Pre-condition 3: FF application specific server has requested FAE server to
manage the App#A to slice mapping. Following, the FAE server maps App#A (and
the FF UEs within App#A) to Slice #1 (based on received slice information) and
stores the mapping information.
Figure 7.13.1.2-1: FF application to slice mapping by FAE layer
1\. A trigger event is captured at the application layer. Two options are
possible:
1a. The FF application specific client of the FF-UE needs to adapt the app#A
to service profile mapping, e.g. due to QoE adaptation, UE mobility,
communication model change. Then, the FF application specific client sends to
FAE server via the FAE client an updated service profile trigger event report
for requesting the adaptation of the service requirements to FAE server.
1b. FAE server receives from the FF application specific server a request to
adapt the application requirements. This request can comprise the change of
service profile/requirements mapped to app#A.
2\. FAE server determines the re-mapping of app#A to slice #2. This mapping is
based on the updated application requirements (as of step 1a or 1b), the per
UE slice subscriptions (for all UEs running app#A), slice capabilities and
availability and the GST parameters.
3\. FAE server sends the updated app to slice mapping to the SEAL Server (e.g.
NRx server). This message indicates the requirement for mapping the
application traffic from slice #1 to slice #2.
4\. The SEAL Server, acting as AF, sends a Nnef_service_parameter create or
update request to NEF (as provided in TS23.502 [12] clause 4.15.6.7). The
Service Description can be represented by the application identifier (App#A
ID) and a combination of the DNN and the target S-NSSAI (slice #2). The
updated Service Description is stored in the UDR. The UDR then notifies the
PCF and the PCF provides the updated UE policies to the affected UEs.
5\. The SEAL server sends a Notification to the FAE server on the completion
of the re-mapping of App#A to slice #2.
Editor\'s note: The enhancement of SEAL (e.g. NRx) to process the slice re-
mapping instruction and generate an AF request to trigger the slice re-mapping
towards 5GS as described in steps 1-3 is FFS.
Editor\'s note: Potential overlaps with SA2 for this solution are FFS.
### 7.13.2 Solution evaluation
This is an alternative technical solution for the FF application-triggered
network slice re-mapping by enhancement of SEAL, it may overlap with SA2 or
functionality might be missing there. SA2 should be contacted before
proceeding with normative work.
## 7.14 Solution #14 clock synchronization
### 7.14.1 General
This solution addresses the key issue 3: clock synchronization.
### 7.14.2 Solution description
As specified in clause 5.27 of TS 23.501[7], the mechanisms for TSN time
synchronization is designed.
For TSN time synchronization, the entire E2E 5G system can be considered as an
IEEE 802.1AS [5] \"time-aware system\". Only the TSN Translators (TTs) at the
edges of the 5G system need to support the IEEE 802.1AS [5] operations. UE,
gNB, UPF, NW-TT and DS-TTs are synchronized with the 5G GM (i.e. the 5G
internal system clock) which shall serve to keep these network elements
synchronized. The TTs located at the edge of 5G system fulfil all functions
related to IEEE 802.1AS [5], e.g. (g)PTP support, timestamping, Best Master
Clock Algorithm (BMCA), rateRatio.
The TSN time synchronization is addressed by the TSN translators, which is in
SA2 scope.
### 7.14.3 Solution evaluation
This solution uses TSN time synchronization mechanisms specified in clause
5.27 of Rel-16 3GPP TS 23.501[7], it is in SA2 scope, no need normative work.
## 7.15 Solution 15: Time Synchronization Management
### 7.15.1 Time Synchronization support
SA2 FS_IIOT study in 3GPP TR 23.700-20 [13] contains solutions addressing the
exposure of Time Synchronization capabilities by NEF. Exposed Time
Synchronization capabilities include:
\- Support for Time Synchronization.
\- Supported time synchronization methods.
\- Supported (g)PTP versions.
\- Minimum Time Synchronization accuracy supported.
\- Minimum gPTP or PTP message generation supported.
\- Maximum number of clients that can be supported at the minimum gPTP or PTP
message rate.
3GPP TR 23.700-20 [13] has introduced procedures to expose 5G time
synchronization information to aid the AF/FAE server to use Time
Synchronization in 5GS. Based on this and in order to support time
synchronization to FF specific applications, it is proposed that the SEAL
Network Resource Management (NRM) server exposes the Time synchronization
capabilities obtained from NEF via N33 to Application Specific Servers that
need to use the Time Synchronization Service.
Figure 7.15.1-1: Procedure to request time synchronization capabilities
1\. The FF application specific server sends a Time Synchronization capability
request to the FAE server in order to learn about the supported time
synchronization capabilities.
2\. The FAE server forwards the request to the SEAL NRM server.
3\. The SEAL NRM server authorizes the request and interacts with the 5GS/NEF
server to retrieve the time synchronization capability information. The SEAL
NRM server may cache this information to satisfy future requests.
4\. The SEAL NRM server sends a response to the FAE server with the
information about the supported time synchronization capabilities if step 3
was successful. Otherwise it sends a failure response.
5\. The FAE server forwards the response to the FF application specific
server.
### 7.15.2 Time Synchronization activation/deactivation/modification
3GPP TR 23.700-20 [13] has also introduced solutions addressing Time
Synchronization services. These services can be used by an AF to request time
synchronization with specified requirements, and supply information that can
be used to optimize and configure time synchronization procedures for
connected devices. These solutions include procedures for an AF to request
Time Synchronization in 5GS for a UE or a group of UEs, such as time
synchronization method, (g)PTP versions, Timing Domain, grandmaster
priorities, required synchronization accuracy.
Assuming that the information about supported time synchronization
capabilities has been provided to the FF application specific server, as
described in clause 7.15.1, it is proposed that the SEAL NRM server is further
enhanced to offer Time Synchronization activation/deactivation/modification
services to the FF Application Enabler (FAE) Server using 5GS services via
NEF. For that, SEAL NRM server sends a Time Sync Service Request to the NEF
indicating the target UE(s) and the clock domain to activate/deactivate/modify
UE\'s time synchronization service.
Editor\'s note: How time synchronization could be supported in the FAE layer
when not supported by 5GS is FFS.
Figure 7.15.2-1: Procedure to activate/deactivate/modify time synchronization
1\. The FF application specific server sends a Time Synchronization
activation/deactivation/modification request to the FAE server with a list of
VAL UEs and/or a VAL group ID that are the target of the request and the clock
domain when applicable.
2\. The FAE server forwards the request to the SEAL NRM server.
3\. The SEAL NRM server authorizes the request and interacts with the 5GS/NEF
server to activate/deactivate/modify the time synchronization service for the
target UEs.
4\. The SEAL NRM server sends a response to the FAE server with the result of
step 3. If step 3 was successful the SEAL NRM server sends a success response,
otherwise it sends a failure response.
5\. The FAE server forwards the response to the FF application specific
server.
### 7.15.3 Solution evaluation
This solution depends on SA2 addressing requirements regarding the exposure of
time synchronization via NEF. 3GPP TR 23.700-20 [13] has already started to
address solutions to provide generic mechanisms for exposure of time
synchronization services via NEF. The specification of such mechanisms,
therefore, will be required to be used as the baseline when the solution
described in this clause is addressed during the normative work.
## 7.16 Solution #16: TSN policy negotiation via FAE layer
### 7.16.1 Solution description
This solution function addresses the Key issue #4 for enabling the negotation
via the FAE layer of the TSN application QoS requirements (e.g. survival time)
and their mapping to network policies / QoS parameters.
#### 7.16.1.1 General
This solution takes as input a trigger event based on the monitored QoS
parameters (by SEAL / NRx or by the network) and based on this, it generates a
trigger which may be in the form of a proposed action, which can be a policy
related to the 1) adaptation of application requirements (e.g. survival time,
TSC service area, mobility change) or 2) adaptation of port management
policies (DS-TT, NW-TT policies). TSN system (FF application specific server
which is equivalent to CNC) may then provide a request for adaptation of the
configuration based on these requirements, and FAE server will send these
policies to the corresponding Devices (FAE clients).
An example for TSN policy negotiation corresponding to port management
policies and service requirements is when high jitter is monitored for an
ongoing session, the hold & forward buffering parameters may be adapted to de-
jitter the TSC flows. However, this will have impact on the survival time,
since the delayed reception of the traffic, may lead to service termination
(due to reaching the survival time threshold). In this case, FAE server
interacts with the CNC for triggering the adaptation of the survival time/
tolerance to loss value, in combination with the hold & forward buffering
parameters.
#### 7.16.1.2 Procedure
Pre-condition 1: UE is registered to 5GS and FAE client has established a
connection with FAE server.
Pre-condition 2: FF application specific server has subscribed to FAE server
to receive TSN related triggers.
Pre-condition 3: FAE server has subscribed to the SEAL server / NRx (based on
Solution #10 of TR 23.745) or to the PLMN (**e.g.** QoS monitoring for URLLC
as specified in clause 5.33.3 of TS 23.501 [7]**) for receiving QoS events.**
Figure 7.16.1.2-1: TSN Policy update negotiation
1a. A QoS monitoring event is sent from either SEAL/NRx (based on Solution #10
of TR 23.745) or PLMN/NEF to the FAE server based on the subscription (e.g.
event related to high jitter for TSC flow).
1b. Alternatively to 1a, a UE related monitoring event, which may relate to a
UE related event (e.g. change of UE or group mobility/speed, inter-UE distance
change, location reporting) or an application-related event (notification that
maximum survival time is reached for the TSC service, high jitter, etc).
2\. FAE server upon receiving the QoS and/or UE-related monitoring event for
one or more TSC flows, determines a trigger, which can be a proposed TSN
policy update for all or subsets of the TSC flows within the FF application.
The trigger may take the form of a new service requirement, QoS requirement or
network requirement for the TSC flows, taking also into account the location
of the UEs (which can be provided by LM server).
3\. The FAE server, acting as CUC, sends an abstracted report, enclosing a
notification on an experienced/expected change of application requirement
/application QoS metric based on the received event to FF application specific
server / CNC. CNC may adapt the configuration, and then sends a TSN policy
update to FAE server, including the new policy parameters based on the
proposed policy parameters. The new policy update may take the form of a new
QoS/network/service requirement for the TSC flows of the end devices. This
exchanged is performed via User/Network protocol as being specified in IEEE
802.1Qcc [25].
4\. The FF application specific server sends a TSN flow configuration update
to the NRz server (NRz server, acting as TSN AF, receives from FF application
specific server, acting as CNC, policy parameters and related flow information
according to IEEE 802.1Q [6]), if the TSN policy update relates to the update
of the QoS policies for the TSN flows. If the TSN policy update relates to NW-
TT/DS-TT port management policy update, NRz interacts with NW-TT and DS-TT to
apply the new policy (TSN AF to NW-TT/ DW-TT transfer of port or bridge
management information, as defined in TS23.501 [7], clause 5.28.3.2). NRz
server has been defined in Solution #22 of TR23.745.
5\. The FAE server sends a service requirement update message to the involved
FAE clients. This message includes the agreed policy update type and
parameters. Then, further interaction with FF application specific client is
needed for applying the new parameters (e.g. survival time increase).
Editor\'s note: In this solution, the transformed information may take the
form of a proposal of a TSN policy / requirements update for the respective FF
application. However, it is FFS what transformed information is needed for
supporting such update.
### 7.16.2 Solution evaluation
This solution provides a mechanism, involving the FAE, for transforming a
monitoring event from the network or UE side, to an abstracted report which
can be used by FF application specific server to adapt the TSN policies for
one or more devices running TSC services. This solution provides an
enhancement for pro-actively alerting the CNC on expected performance
downgrade, while minimizing the complexity/overhead at the FF application
specific server (for processing all related network/UE triggered monitoring
events). TSN-based ecosystems are configured to explicitly support the
required QoS at the application layer. This solution provides a mechanism to
enable the application layer to make adjustments when QoS conditions occur
that affect the ability for the application to function normally; however it
is still unclear in which use cases such QoS abnormalities can be accommodated
for in TSN networks. This solution will be considered for normative work if a
valid use case is identified where this solution provides value.
Editor\'s note: Whether the FAE server can act as CUC is FFS.
## 7.17 Solution #17: Support TSN in FF Application Enabler layer
### 7.17.1 Solution description
This solution is only support TSN in FF Application Enabler (FAE) layer, not
include SEAL services.
Figure 7.17.1-1 illustrates the FF function model to support TSN in FAE layer.
Figure 7.17.1-1: Functional model to support TSN in FAE layer
According to clause 4.4.8 Time Sensitive Communication and clause 5.28 Support
of integration with TSN specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], in order to support
TSN in application layer, the FF UE interacts with DS-TT, the FAE server
acting as TSN-AF and links to TSN CNC over FAE-S reference point following
IEEE 802.1Qcc [25]. The FAE server acting as TSN AF manages the 5GS TSN bridge
(including DS-TT and NW-TT) through N5/N33 reference point specified in 3GPP
TS 23.501[7]. The FF application specific client provides the client side
functionalities corresponding to the TSN applications (e.g. motion control,
control-to-control communication, mobile robots, mobile control panels). The
FF application specific server provides the server side functionalities
corresponding to the TSN applications.
Editor\'s Note 1: The FAE client can also be outside of the UE.
Editor\'s Note 2: Reuse of the TSN channel by the FAE layer (e.g.FAE-1) is
FFS.
### 7.17.2 Solution evaluation
This solution supports FAE server acting as TSN AF without SEAL, which depends
TSC capabilities already specified on Rel-16 3GPP TS 23.501 [7] and solutions
currently studied in 3GPP TR 23.700-20 [13].
## 7.18 Solution #18: Device monitoring
### 7.18.1 Solution description
#### 7.18.1.1 General
This solution corresponds to the Key issue #14 - Device monitoring.
3GPP TS 23.501 [7] defines NEF to support external exposure of capabilities of
network functions. Monitoring capability can be used for exposing UE\'s
mobility management context such as UE location, reachability, roaming status,
and loss of connectivity.
3GPP TS 29.522 [11] & 3GPP TS 29.122 [26] defines MonitoringEvent API for
exposure of monitoring capability, including detail monitoring events (e.g.
LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY, UE_REACHABILITY, LOCATION_REPORTING, ROAMING_STATUS,
COMMUNICATION_FAILURE,
Availability_after_DDN_failure_notification_enhancement,
PDN_CONNECTIVITY_STATUS, Downlink_data_delivery_status_5G, etc.) for device
monitoring.
Expose monitoring capability is a common functionality for all verticals (and
not only V2X and FF), so SEAL should to enhance to support.
The FAE server can utilize Network Resource Management of SEAL to support
device monitoring. Which needs to enhance the existing Network Resource
Management service enabler by invoking MonitoringEvent API through NEF defined
in 3GPP TS 29.522 [11] & 3GPP TS 29.122 [26].
#### 7.18.1.2 Device monitoring procedure
The procedure for device monitoring is illustrated in figure 7.18.1.2-1.
Figure 7.18.1.2-1: Device monitoring procedures
1\. The FF application specific server sends a device monitoring subscribe
request (which include monitor event types, e.g. UE location, reachability,
roaming status, and loss of connectivity, etc.) to the FAE server. The FF
application specific server don\'t need to have knowledge of 5G network
events, just monitor event types. The FAE server exposes the monitor event
types to FF application specific server, those higher abstraction are based on
SEAL NRM server providing a higher abstraction level of the NEF monitoring
events to the FAE server.
2\. The FAE server determines device or group information which based on
criterias such as location area. Then the FAE server forwards the request to
SEAL NRM server to subscribe to device monitoring events. The SEAL NRM server
interacts with the NEF to establish a device monitoring subscription (not
shown in the sequence). In that interaction the SEAL NRM server determines
device monitoring events (e.g. LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY, UE_REACHABILITY,
LOCATION_REPORTING, ROAMING_STATUS, COMMUNICATION_FAILURE,
Availability_after_DDN_failure_notification_enhancement,
PDN_CONNECTIVITY_STATUS, Downlink_data_delivery_status_5G, etc.). The SEAL NRM
server could provide further operations, e.g. offering different monitoring
levels, maping to subsets of the NEF events, caching events, mapping of
identities, etc.
3\. The FAE server sends a device monitoring subscribe response to the FF
application specific server.
4\. When device monitoring event is triggered and the SEAL NRM server is
notified by the NEF (not shown in the sequence), the SEAL NRM server matches
the criteria for the subscribed device monitoring type and generates the
higher abstraction level event, then sends a device monitoring notification to
the FAE server.
5\. The FAE server notifies the FF application specific server about the
device monitoring event.
NOTE: Steps 4 and 5 are repeated when device monitoring events occur.
6\. When the FF application specific server decides to unsubscribe for the
device monitoring, the FF application specific server sends a device
monitoring unsubscribe request to the FAE server.
7\. The FAE interacts with the SEAL NRM server to unsubscribe from device
monitoring events. The SEAL NRM server interacts with the NEF to terminate the
device monitoring subscription (not shown in the sequence).
8\. The FAE server sends a device monitoring unsubscribe response to the FF
application specific server.
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS to clarify the functionality of FAE server for
device monitoring.
### 7.18.2 Solution evaluation
This solution depends on how SEAL to support NEF MonitoringEvent API. The
specification of such a mechanism, therefore, will be required to be used as
the baseline when the solution described in this clause is addressed during
the normative work.
## 7.19 Solution #19: Communicating FF application service requirements with
3GPP system
### 7.19.1 Solution description
This solution corresponds to the key issue #8 on communication of FF
application requirements with 5GS and key issue#11 on QoS coordination. The
procedure for communicating FF application service requirements from FF
application specific server utilizes the procedures specified in clause 14.3.4
of 3GPP TS 23.434 [8]. The NRM server is to be enhanced to additionally
support translating the FF application service requirements to 3GPP network
requirements.
### 7.19.2 Solution evaluation
This is a viable technical solution for key issue#8. The NRM server acts a
generic server which may be co-located with FF application specific server and
may be capable to translate the FF application specific requirements to 3GPP
transport specific requirements.
## 7.20 Solution #20: SEAL support for CoAP to address constrained devices
### 7.20.1 Solution description
#### 7.20.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses key issue 16 -- Constrained devices - with regards to
the architectural SEAL enhancements needed to address such devices.
The purpose of SEAL is to provide generic service enablers to address
requirements common to various vertical applications. SEAL defines a generic
architecture, service enablers, protocols, and APIs in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8] in
stage 2 and a set of stage 3 specifications.
As described in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8], SEAL-UU is a generic reference point for
interactions between a SEAL client and a corresponding SEAL server. Each SEAL
service specifies its SEAL-UU reference point and the protocol(s) used in that
reference point. The present SEAL services make a choice of using HTTP and/or
SIP in the SEAL-UU reference point. Clause 6.2 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [8] specifies
the functional model of the SEAL signalling control plane, which is based on
SIP and HTTP. While these protocols are well established and performant for
non-constrained devices, they are problematic for battery-driven, CPU and
memory constrained devices.
The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a protocol defined by IETF in
RFC 7252 [27] and designed specifically for application layer communication
for constrained devices. CoAP provides a request/response interaction model
between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery of services and
resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs and Internet
media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for integration
with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as multicast support,
very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained environments. RFC 7252 [27]
specifies bindings to UDP and DTLS. IETF RFC 8323 [28] specifies bindings to
TCP, WebSocket and TLS.
CoAP has the following main features:
\- Web protocol fulfilling requirements in constrained environments, realizing
the REST architecture
\- Unreliable transport with UDP binding with optional reliability supporting
unicast and multicast requests, and security binding to DTLS
\- Reliable transport with TCP and WebSocket binding, and security binding to
TLS
\- Asynchronous message exchanges
\- Low header overhead and parsing complexity
\- URI and Content-type support
\- Simple proxy and caching capabilities
\- A stateless HTTP mapping, allowing proxies to be built providing access to
CoAP resources via HTTP in a uniform way or for HTTP simple interfaces to be
realized alternatively over CoAP
This solution proposes to introduce CoAP as an additional protocol for the
SEAL signalling control plane. The following IETF documents are considered
relevant for this purpose, and are listed here for reference:
a) The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) -- RFC 7252 [27]. It defines
the CoAP protocol, messaging model, format, request/response semantics as well
as options and other header parameters.
b) CoAP over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets -- RFC 8323 [28]. It outlines the
changes required to use CoAP over TCP, TLS, and WebSockets transports. The
primary reason for introducing CoAP over TCP and TLS is that some networks do
not forward UDP packets. Additionally, Where NATs are present along the
communication path, CoAP over TCP leads to different NAT traversal behavior
than CoAP over UDP.
c) Block-Wise Transfers in CoAP -- RFC 7959 [29]. It defines blockwise
transfers over CoAP, for large payloads.
d) Observing Resources in CoAP -- RFC 7641 [30]. It specifies a simple
protocol extension for CoAP that enables CoAP clients to \"observe\"
resources, i.e., to retrieve a representation of a resource and keep this
representation updated by the server over a period of time.
e) Constrained RESTful Environments (CoRE) Link Format -- RFC 6690 [31]. It
defines Web Linking using a link format for use by constrained servers to
describe hosted resources, their attributes, and other relationships between
links.
f) Object Security for Constrained RESTful Environments (OSCORE) -- RFC 8613
[32]. It provides end-to-end protection between endpoints communicating using
CoAP or CoAP-mappable HTTP.
g) Authentication and Authorization for Constrained Environments (ACE) using
the OAuth 2.0 Framework (ACE-OAuth - draft-ietf-ace-oauth-authz-35 [33]. It
describes a framework for authentication and authorization in constrained
environments built on re-use of OAuth 2.0, thereby extending authorization to
IoT devices.
### 7.20.2 SEAL functional model for signalling control plane including CoAP
Clause 6.2 in TS 23.434 [8] shows SEAL functional model for the signalling
control plane. CoAP-based entities and reference points are introduced to the
functional model, as shown in the figure 7.20.2-1.
Figure 7.20.2-1: SEAL functional model for signalling control plane including
CoAP entities
The proposed CoAP signalling entities and reference points are described
further in clauses 7.20.3 and 7.20.4, respectively.
### 7.20.3 CoAP entities
#### 7.20.3.1 CoAP client
This functional entity acts as the client for all transactions of the SEAL
client executing in a constrained UE. An unconstrained UE may choose to use
the CoAP client if it is available.
#### 7.20.3.2 CoAP proxy
This functional entity acts as a proxy for transactions between the CoAP
client and one or more CoAP servers. The CoAP proxy terminates a DTLS, TLS or
secure WebSocket session on CoAP-1 reference point with the CoAP client of the
VAL UE allowing the CoAP client to establish a single secure session for
transactions with multiple CoAP servers that are reachable by the CoAP proxy.
CoAP proxy can act as a cross-protocol CoAP-HTTP proxy to enable CoAP clients
to access resources on HTTP servers on HTTP-2 reference point.
The CoAP proxy terminates CoAP-3 reference point that lies between different
CoAP proxies. It may provide a topology hiding function from CoAP entities
outside the trust domain of the VAL system.
The CoAP proxy can also terminate HTTP-3 reference point for interworking with
another HTTP proxy. In this role it provides cross-protocol mapping and may
provide a topology hiding function from HTTP entities outside the trust domain
of the VAL system.
The CoAP proxy shall be in the same trust domain as the CoAP clients and CoAP
servers that are located within a VAL service provider\'s network. There can
be multiple instances of a CoAP proxy e.g. one per trust domain.
NOTE: The number of instances of the CoAP proxy is deployment specific.
#### 7.20.3.3 CoAP server
This functional entity acts as the CoAP server for all CoAP transactions of
the SEAL server.
### 7.20.4 Signalling control plane reference points for CoAP
#### 7.20.4.1 Reference point CoAP-1 (between the CoAP client and the CoAP
proxy)
The CoAP-1 reference point exists between the CoAP client and the CoAP proxy.
The CoAP-1 reference point is based on CoAP (which may be secured using DTLS
when run on UDP or TLS when run on TCP or WebSocket).
#### 7.20.4.2 Reference point CoAP-2 (between the CoAP proxy and the CoAP
server)
The CoAP-2 reference point, which exists between the CoAP proxy and the CoAP
server, is based on CoAP (which may be secured using DTLS when run on UDP or
TLS when run on TLS).
#### 7.20.4.3 Reference point CoAP-3 (between the CoAP proxy and CoAP proxy)
The CoAP-3 reference point, which exists between the CoAP proxy and another
CoAP proxy in a different network, is based on CoAP (which may be secured
using DTLS when run on UDP or TLS when run on TLS).
### 7.20.5 CoAP usage
CoAP is introduced as an optional protocol to be used by the SEAL service
enablers on their respective SEAL-UU reference points, e.g. key management,
location management, group management, configuration management and identity
management. A SEAL client serving a constrained device should use the CoAP-1
reference point with the CoAP proxy and may use either the CoAP-2 or the
HTTP-2 reference point for transport and routing of the related signalling
with the SEAL server.
CoAP may be used for interactions between SEAL servers on their respective
SEAL-X reference points. For this usage a SEAL-X reference point shall use the
CoAP-1 and either the CoAP-2 or the CoAP-3 reference point depending on the
trust relationship between the interacting SEAL servers.
### 7.20.6 Solution evaluation
This solution provides enhancements to the SEAL functional model for the
signalling control plane by adding support of CoAP to address constrained
devices. This solution addresses the gaps described in key issue #16.
## 7.21 Solution #21: Enabling 5G CN capabilities for SEAL Groups
### 7.21.1 Solution description
This solution corresponds to the Key issue #17 -- Using 5G CN capabilities for
SEAL Groups. The solution proposes that the SEAL server obtains the external
group identifier for a group of UEs, from the core network and includes it the
SEAL group document at the time of group creation. This provides a mapping of
the SEAL group to a core network known external group identifier, which can
then be be used by the SEAL servers or the FF application layer servers for
invoking any SCEF/NEF APIs related to the SEAL group.
SEAL GMS then stores this external group identifier within the SEAL group
document. Further, any SEAL server or the FF application server can fetch the
external group identifier from the SEAL GMS using the VAL Group ID and use it
for any NEF/SCEF invocations like monitoring APIs for UE reachability,
location etc.
This solution is also applicable for other verticals like UASAPP, V2XAPP etc,
where SEAL or VAL has to to invoke SCEF/NEF APIs related to the group of UEs
to fufill the vertical specific requirements.
### 7.21.2 SEAL Group creation procedures
The external group identifier (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.682 [34]),
identifying the group of UEs, is stored in the newly created VAL group
document at the time of SEAL group creation. This clause illustrates how
external group identifier is assigned to VAL group document during various
SEAL creation procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [8].
As shown in Figure 7.21.2-1, during the SEAL group creation procedure as
specified in clause 10.3.3 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [8], in step 3, the SEAL GMS
server uses the external group identifier identifying the member UEs in the
VAL group and stores the external group identifier in the newly created VAL
group document.
Figure 7.21.2-1: SEAL group creation
As shown in Figure 7.21.2-2, during the location based SEAL group creation
procedure as specified in clause 10.3.7 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [8], in step 6, the
SEAL GMS server uses the external group identifier for the list of UEs
obtained from Location Management Server in step 4 and store the external
group identifier to the newly created VAL group document.
Figure 7.21.2-2: Location-based SEAL group creation
As shown in Figure 7.21.2-3, during the group announcement and join procedure
as specified in clause 10.3.8 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [8], in step 4, the SEAL GMS
server uses the external group identifier for the list of UEs and stores the
external group identifier in the newly VAL group document.
Figure 7.21.2-3: Group announcement and join procedure
For group management procedures pertaining to a 5GLAN group, to create or
modify the external group identifiers, the SEAL group management server will
use dynamic 5G VN group management procedures exposed by NEF via the N33
reference point (as specified in TS 23.501 [7] and TS 23.502 [12]).
Note: For SEAL groups not pertaining to 5GLAN group, management of the
external group identifier may require alignment with SA2 work in future.
### 7.21.3 Solution evaluation
This solution provides enhancements to SEAL GMS supporting the external group
identifier (identifying a group of UEs by the 3GPP CN) in SEAL Group
Management procedures. This enables the SEAL and FFAPP layer servers to invoke
the SCEF/NEF APIs for the member UEs of the VAL group using the external group
identifier managed by the 3GPP CN. This solution addressess the gaps described
in Key Issue #17.
## 7.22 Solution #22: SEAL support for TSC services
### 7.22.1 Introduction
This solution addresses architectural aspects related to Key Issue #4 on TSN
support, Key Issue #11 on QoS coordination, and Key Issue #8 on communication
of FF application requirements.
This contribution proposes an architecture to expose Time Sensitive
Communication (TSC) capabilities of the 5G system which supports integration
with an IEEE TSN system as well as 5G-native (i.e. non-TSN) TSC services. Due
to the common nature of these TSC capabilities (which can be used by various
verticals), it is proposed to enhance the SEAL Network Resource Management
service enabler by adding support for TSC capabilities.
The SEAL NRM service enabler will make use of the 5GS TSC capabilities
available via the N5 reference point.
In the Rel-16 specification 3GPP TS 23.501 [7] 5GS supports integration with
IEEE 802.1 TSN networks applicable for the fully centralized configuration
model as defined in IEEE Std 802.1Qcc [25]. In that model the Centralized
Network Configuration (CNC) server sets up the TSN flows across the 5GS
virtual bridges based on the TSN stream requests from CUC and the 5GS virtual
bridge capabilities provided by the TSN AF.
For the case of TSN integration, this solution proposes that the NRM server
will act as a TSN AF and will interact with the CNC via the NRM-S reference
point using the IEEE 802.1Qcc [25] management protocol. The NRM server will
interact with the 5GC via N5 reference point as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501
[7].
For the case of 5G-native TSC services, this solution proposes that the NRM
server will support management of the end-to-end QoS flows in the 5GS. This
will enable an FF application to request configuration of TSC QoS flows
between UEs within the 5GS via the NRM-S reference point. The NRM server will
perform QoS coordination for the set of UEs and their respective QoS flows
referred-to in KI#11. In this case the NRM-S reference point will specify a
3GPP protocol for this interaction. The NRM server will also configure the NRM
clients with the TSC parameters for their QoS flows. The NRM server will
interact with the 5GC via N5 reference point as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501
[7].
### 7.22.2 Solution description
The architecture for integration of the 5G with TSN is depicted in Figure
7.22.2-1. The SEAL NRM server acts as a TSN AF. Upon request from an FF
Application layer server acting as a TSN CNC via the NRM-S reference point it
configures the TSN flows in the 5GS. In this case the NRM-S supports the IEEE
802.1Qcc management protocol. As a TSN AF the SEAL NRM server interacts with
the 5GS PCF over the N5 reference point to configure the 5G QoS and TSCAI
parameters in the 5GS.
Figure 7.22.2-1: Functional model to support TSN in the SEAL layer
The architecture for the 5G-native TSC is depicted in Figure 7.22.2-2. The
SEAL NRM server acts as an AF (referred to as TSC AF) towards the 5G Core
Network and performs coordination of QoS flows to fulfill the end-to-end QoS
requirements for the UEs involved in the TSC communication. When QoS
monitoring is requested, the SEAL NRM server will also perform coordination of
the QoS montoring subscriptions and notifications needed for the end-to-end
QoS flows using the mechnisms of Solution #10. Upon request from an FF
Application layer server via the NRM-S reference point it configures the TSC
end-to-end QoS flows in the 5GS. In line with other SEAL service enablers the
SEAL NRM server provides a RESTful interface on the NRM-S reference point. As
a TSC AF the SEAL NRM server interacts with the 5GS PCF over the N5 reference
point to configure the 5G QoS and TSCAI parameters in the 5GS. UE-TSC
corresponds to UE-DS-TT in the TSN integration case, which also means that UE-
TSC residence time is the same as UE-DS-TT residence time that is used for the
end-to-end latency calculation.
NOTE: The NRM server uses procedures of the N5 reference point specified in
Rel-16.
Figure 7.22.2-2: Functional model to support 5G-native TSC in the SEAL layer
### 7.22.3 5G-native TSC procedures
#### 7.22.3.1 TSC stream discovery procedure
Pre-conditions:
1\. UE-TSCs are assigned to a VLAN and each UE has an established Ethernet PDU
session.
2\. The TSC-AF has populated the NRM server management information base
(defined in IEEE 802.1Qcc [25] with the 5G bridge management and port
management information. The latter is related to the Ethernet ports located in
the UE-TSCs including bridge delay per UE-TSC Ethernet port pair per traffic
class.
3\. NRM server acting as TSC AF has calculated the bridge delay for each port
pair, i.e. composed of (ingress UE-TSC Ethernet port, egress UE-TSC Ethernet
port) including the UE-DS-TT residence time, PDB and propagation delay for
both UL from sender UE and DL to receiver UE.
Figure 7.22.3.1-1: TSC stream discovery procedure
1\. The NRM server receives a request from a VAL server on NRM-S reference
point to discover the connectivity and available QoS characteristics between
UE-TSCs identified by their MAC addresses. The request includes Stream ID (as
defined in IEEE 802.1CB [37]), source UE-TSC port MAC address and destination
UE-TSC port MAC address.
2\. The NRM server validates the connectivity between the UE-TSCs connected in
the same VLAN based on the stored managed objects info base, identifies the
traffic classes supported by the UE-TSCs and calculates the end-to-end latency
(including the residence time of the UE-DS-TTs, PDBs, and propagation delay).
3\. NRM server responds to the VAL server with the Stream ID and the available
end-to-end latency and the traffic classes supported by the UE-TSCs.
#### 7.22.3.2 TSC stream creation procedure
This procedure allows the VAL application to create a TSC stream.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Each UE has an established Ethernet PDU session for its UE-TSC port MAC
address.
2\. Each NRM Client has an established connection with the NRM server.
3\. Connectivity between the UE-TSCs has been validated by the TSC stream
discovery procedure.
4\. NRM server maintains mapping from the traffic class to TSC QoS (including
latency).
Figure 7.22.3.2-1: TSC stream creation procedure
1\. NRM server receives a TSC stream creation request from a VAL server (FAE
or FF application specific server) to create a TSC stream identified by a
Stream ID, between UE-TSC ports for a traffic class (e.g. scheduled traffic,
strict priority) and traffic specification including MaxFrameInterval,
MaxFrameSize, MaxIntervalFrames, MaxLatency, etc., as described in IEEE
802.1Qcc [25] in clause 46.2. If QoS monitoring is requested, the SEAL NRM
server will also perform coordination of the QoS montoring subscriptions and
notifications needed for the end-to-end QoS flows using the mechnisms of
Solution #10.
2\. NRM server calculates the schedule for the Stream ID. It provides per-
stream filtering and policing parameters according to IEEE 802.1Q [6] used to
derive the TSC QoS information and related flow information. NRM server also
provides the forwarding rule according to IEEE 802.1Q [6] used to identify the
UE-TSC MAC address of the corresponding PDU session. Based on the 5GS bridge
delay information it determines the TSC QoS information and TSC Assistance
information for the stream.
3\. NRM server triggers via N5 the AF request procedure as shown in 3GPP TS
23.502 [12] annex F.2 for the TSC stream for both UL QoS flow (sender UE to
UPF/bridge) and DL QoS flow (UPF/bridge to receiver UE). The AF request
includes the Stream ID, the UE-TSC port MAC address, TSC QoS information, TSC
Assistance Information, flow bit rate, priority, Service Data Flow Filter
containing flow description including Ethernet Packet Filters. The QoS flow
will be assigned for the PDU session for the source MAC address for the UL
direction and for the PDU session for the destination MAC address for the DL
direction. The configuration sent over N5 includes also the gate control list
(including AdminControlList, AdminBaseTime, AdminCycleTime and Tick
Granularity) for the Stream ID. The gate control parameters are for the hold
and forward buffering by the UE-TSC for the respective TSC flow. This
information is delivered to the UE-TSC by the 5GS.
4\. NRM server sends TSC stream creation response to the VAL server with the
result of TSC stream creation for the Stream ID.
#### 7.22.3.3 Void
#### 7.22.3.4 Void
#### 7.22.3.5 TSC stream deletion procedure
This procedure allows the VAL application to delete a TSC stream.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The TSC stream is configured in the 5GS and the UE-TSCs.
Figure 7.22.3.5-1: TSC stream deletion procedure
1\. NRM server receives a request from VAL server to delete a TSC stream for
with a Stream ID.
2\. NRM server identifies the MAC addresses of the UE-TSCs and the NRM clients
involved in the stream based on the stored information for the Stream ID.
3\. NRM server triggers via N5 the AF session modification procedure defined
in 3GPP TS 23.502 [12] clause 4.15.6.6 for MAC address and Stream ID. NRM
server uses the procedure to delete both UL QoS flow (sender UE to UPF/bridge)
and DL QoS flows (UPF/bridge to receiver UE) from the PDU sessions of the UEs
involved in the stream carrying the TSC stream with the Stream ID.
4\. NRM server sends TSC stream deletion response to the VAL server with the
result of TSC stream deletion for the Stream ID.
### 7.22.4 IEEE-TSN TSC procedures
#### 7.22.4.1 5GS TSN Bridge information reporting
Pre-conditions:
1\. VAL server (FAE server or FF application specific server) acts as TSN CNC.
Figure 7.22.4.1-1: TSN Bridge information reporting procedure
1\. Acting as the TSN AF the NRM server collects 5GS TSN Bridge information by
interaction with the 5GS via the N5 reference point, as described in in TS
23.502 [12] Annex F.1. The NRM server stores the binding relationship between
5GS Bridge ID, MAC address of the DS-TT Ethernet port and also updates 5GS
bridge delay as defined in clause 5.27.5 of TS 23.501 [2]. The NRM server
retrieves txPropagationDelay and Traffic Class table from DS-TT and it also
retrieves txPropagationDelay and Traffic Class table from NW-TT.
2\. The NRM server constructs the above received information as 5GS TSN Bridge
information and sends them to the VAL server acting as CNC to register a new
TSN Bridge or update an existing TSN Bridge.
3\. The VAL server stores the TSN Bridge information and returns a
confirmation to the NRM server.
#### 7.22.4.2 5GS TSN Bridge configuration procedure
Pre-conditions:
1\. VAL server (FAE server or FF application specific server) acts as TSN CNC
and it has stored the 5GS TSN Bridge information received from the NRM server
acting as TSN AF.
2\. The NRM server acting as TSN AF has stored the 5GS TSN Bridge information
collected from the 5GS, as described in clause 7.22.4.1.
Figure 7.22.4.2-1: TSN Bridge configuration procedure
1\. The NRM server receives from the VAL server acting as CNC per-stream
filtering, policing parameters and related flow information according to IEEE
802.1Q [6] and it uses them to derive TSN QoS information and related flow
information. The TSN AF uses this information to identify the DS-TT MAC
address of the corresponding PDU session.
2\. NRM server triggers via N5 the AF request procedure as described in 3GPP
TS 23.502 [12] Annex F.2. The AF request includes the Stream ID, the UE-DS-TT
port MAC address, TSC QoS information, TSC Assistance Information, flow bit
rate, priority, Service Data Flow Filter containing flow description including
Ethernet Packet Filters.
3\. NRM server sends a TSN Bridge configuration response.
### 7.22.5 Solution evaluation
This is a viable technical solution for aspects related to Key Issue #4 on TSN
support, Key Issue #11 on QoS coordination, and Key Issue #8 on communication
of FF application requirements, where common support for integration with TSN
and for 5G-native (i.e. non-TSN) use cases is provided by enhancing the SEAL
NRM enabler service.
For the 5G-native case, the solution builds on top of the capabilities
provided by 5G CN in Rel-16 and adds support for end-to-end TSC service
between UEs within the 5GS, providing required coordination of the QoS flows,
so that these supporting mechanisms can be utilized by VAL servers.
For the TSN integration case, the solution is aligned with the TSN integration
solution specified by SA2 in Rel-16. NRM server acts as TSN AF and supporting
mechanisms can be utilized by VAL servers. There are no additional IEs
necessary for the NRM server acting as a TSN AF.
The NRM server of SEAL takes the role of TSN AF and TSC AF and is part of 5GC
as specified in TS 23.501 [7].
## 7.23 Solution #23 (merging Sol#5, #6): Edge computing for FFAPP
### 7.23.1 Solution description
This solution corresponds to the key issue #9 - communication service on the
Edge deployments and merges sol#5 and sol#6 with a complete analysis.
The EDGEAPP architecture is specified in 3GPP TS 23.558 [10]. The EDGE-5
reference point details are not specified in Rel-17.
Figure 7.23.1-1 illustrates the edge deployment example for the FFAPP. For
simplicity, the reference points between enabler server and 5GS are omitted,
and the reference points for inter-enabler server communication in the same
enabler layer are also omitted. At UE side, FF Application Specific client(s)
and FAE client interact with the Edge Enabler Client (EEC) via EDGE-5
reference point. In an Edge Data Network (EDN), the Edge Application Server
(EAS), e.g. FF Application Specific Server and FF Application Enabler server,
interacts with the Edge Enabler Server (EES) via EDGE-3 reference point, for
instance, to register its profile into the EES. The EEC interacts with the
Edge Configuration Server (ECS) via EDGE-4 reference point, for instance, to
discover candidate EES(s). The EEC interacts with the EES via EDGE-1 reference
point, for instance, to discover candidate EAS(s) (e.g. FF Application
Specific Server and FF Application Enabler Server) and provide the discovered
EAS(s) to the Application Client (e.g. FF Application Specific client and FF
Application Enabler client).
Figure 7.x.1-1: FFAPP in EDGE deployment
In an EDN, there could be several EES(s) provided by the same or different
ECSP. The FF application specific server(s) and FAE server shall be able to
discover and register into an appropriate EES. If CAPIF is used, this can be
done by utilizing the AEF serving area and/or the AEF location as described in
3GPP TS 23.222 [16]; otherwise, local configuration of the EES endpoint may be
used.
Note that the other EDGE-3 exposure services are not re-exposed by the FAE
server or SEAL servers to the FF application specific server, for instance,
the FF application specific server directly consumes location or QoS API
provided by the EES.
Editor\'s note: Within an edge deployment, if the application enabler client
in the UE and application specific server need to communicate with the same
application enabler server, whether and how the edge enabler layer is impacted
is FFS.
### 7.23.2 Solution evaluation
This solution addresses KI#9 for \"How to support FFAPP communications over
Edge deployments\" and provides a deployment option for the FF application in
the EDGE application architecture.
## 7.24 Solution #24: Message communication using MSGin5G service
### 7.24.1 Introduction
This solution addresses Key Issue #18 on Support for Message communication.
The MSGin5G Service has been studied in 3GPP TS 23.700-24 [39]. The MSGin5G
architecture has been defined to support following capabilities requirements
as specified in clause 7.1.2 of TS 23.700-24 [39].
\- [AR-7.1.2-a] The application architecture shall enable deployment of
MSGin5G UE which are of heterogeneous nature including light weight
constrained devices (e.g. sensors, actuators) and unconstrained devices with
advanced capabilities (e.g. washing machine, micro-ovens).
\- [AR-7.1.2-c] The application architecture shall enable the communication
payload size varying from small data message to large data message.
Further, the solutions has been studied and concluded to support MSGin5G
service requirements related to one to one, group and broadcast message
services for thing-to-thing and person-to-thing communication with low end-to-
end latency and high reliability of message delivery, in a resource efficient
manner.
The sensors and actuators are also used in factory automation and as mentioned
in KI#18 -- similar message communication requirements are applicable for
FFAPP also.
### 7.24.2 Solution description
The architecture for MSGin5G service has been specified in clause 8.2 of 3GPP
TR 23.700-24 [39]. For non-TSN communications,
\- the UE in FFAPP architecture acts as MSGin5G UE-1 in MSGin5G architecture;
however, the UE in FFAPP architecture do not act as message gateway which is
defined for MSGin5G UE-1 in MSGin5G architecture;
\- the FAE client in FFAPP architecture acts as MSGin5G client in MSGin5G
architecture;
\- the FAE server may implement MSGin5G server functionalities as specified in
MSGin5G architecture; and
\- the solutions studied and concluded in 3GPP TR 23.700-24 [39] for one-to-
one, group and broadcast messages are applicable for FFAPP also, except
solution# 28 which involves message gateway functionalities of the MSGin5G
UE-1.
### 7.24.3 Solution evaluation
This solution provides details on reusing MSGin5G architecture and solutions
for FFAPP for non-TSN messaging communications.

working groups that will need consideration.
## 8.2 Architecture evaluation
The architecture solution in clause 7.1 describes the functional model for FF
application layer. The solution in clause 7.3 describes supporting UE to UE
direct communication in FF application layer. The solutions in clause 7.16 and
clause 7.22 describes functional models for supporting TSN communications. A
summary of the architecture and key issues specified in this technical report
are listed in table 8.2-1.
Table 8.2-1: Architecture evaluation

For supporting non-TSN communications, solution#1 provides a viable functional
model, where FAE server provides application support functions.
For supporting direct UE-to-UE communications, solution#3 provides a viable
functional model, where FAE clients support such interactions.
For supporting TSN communications, solution#16 provides a viable functional
model where the role of TSN AF is assigned to the FAE server.
Solution#22 provides a viable functional model for both the TSN and TSC (non-
TSN) cases, where the role of TSN AF and TSC AF is assigned to SEAL\'s NRM
server.
As per 3GPP TS 23.501 [7], TSN AF is part of 5GC. Any functional entity
defined in the functional model for FFAPP and assumes the role of TSN AF shall
be compliant with the related architecture constraints specified in 3GPP TS
23.501 [7].
It is recommended that the architecture solutions for supporting TSN
communications and TSC caters to multiple vertical applications and hence a
solution in SEAL is favorable.

### 8.3.2 Overall evaluation of solutions for key issue#1
Key issue#1 corresponds to use of network slicing for FFAPP. Two solutions are
proposed in this document.
Solution #12 proposes to enhance SEAL to support NEF or EGMF for acquiring
private slice network status information. Solution#12 is about using existing
slicing functionalities via SEAL or FAE server. No additional requirements are
expected from SA2 or SA5.
Solution #13 proposes to enable the FAE server to translate the adaptation of
the service requirements / profile, as triggered by the FF application
specific server or client, to a network slice re-mapping. Solution#13 is also
based on existing services from 5GC.
For the open issue on whether the slicing support functions specified by SA5
and SA2 are sufficient for FFAPP requirements, no additional functions are
foreseen by SA5 and SA2 in this Release for supporting FFAPP requirements.
Solution#12 will be considered for normative work to be part of SEAL as the
proposed solution addresses the generic service requirements common across
different verticals. Solution#13 is a candidate SEAL solution, but it is not
technically feasible due to unresolved dependencies on SA2-defined
capabilities and cannot be considered for normative work until those
dependencies and/or potential overlaps are resolved.
### 8.3.3 Overall evaluation of solutions for key issue#2
Key issue#2 corresponds to geographic location and positioning information
support for FFAPP. One solution is proposed in this document.
Solution #7 proposes to enhance SEAL location management to support FFAPP
geographic location and high accuracy positioning requirements.
For issue 1, the following positioning non-3GPP positioning technologies are
available: GNSS (e.g. Beidou, Galileo, GPS, Glonass), Network-based Assisted
GNSS and High-Accuracy GNSS, Terrestrial Beacon Systems, dead-reckoning
sensors (e.g. IMU, barometer), WLAN/Bluetooth-based positioning. The selection
of which positioning technology to use for each FFAPP scenario is up to
implementation. A possible use of these are captured in solution#7.
For issue 2, there is no solution for positioning method with ms-level latency
in this study.
For issue 3, there is no solution for absolute and relative positioning in
this study.
For issue 4, solution#7 proposes to enhance SEAL LMS to support FFAPP location
acquisition and location reporting scenarios.
Solution#7 can be considered for normative work as the proposed solution
addressing the service requirements for different verticals. Positioning
methods for ms-level latency and absolute and relative positioning are not yet
supported in Solutuon #7 and will not be included in normative work.
### 8.3.4 Overall evaluation of solutions for key issue#3
Key issue#3 corresponds to manage and utilize 5G clock synchronization
mechanism for FFAPP. Two solutions are proposed in this document.
For issue a, no additional mechanism is required for managing and utilizing 5G
clock as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [7].
For issue b, the APIs are provided by NEF. There are no additional enhancement
to SEAL to support these APIs. The impact on SEAL for using these APIs require
further study can be assessed during normative work.
Solution #14 proposes to use TSN time synchronization mechanisms specified by
SA2 and no need normative work.
Solution #15 proposes to enhance SEAL to expose the Time synchronization
capabilities obtained from NEF via N33 to Application Specific Servers that
need to use the Time Synchronization Service.
Solution #15 will be considered for normative work if the proposed solution
addresses the generic service requirements common across different verticals
considering the functionalities provided by NEF.
### 8.3.5 Overall evaluation of solutions for key issue#4
Key issue#4 corresponds to TSN support of and translation of TSN application
QoS requirements to network QoS parameters of FF applications within the 5G
network. Three solutions are proposed in this document.
Solution#16 proposes that a trigger event - based on the monitored QoS
parameters (by SEAL / NRx or by the network) - which can be a policy related
to the 1) adaptation of application requirements (e.g. survival time, TSC
service area, mobility change) or 2) adaptation of port management policies
(DS-TT, NW-TT policies) makes the TSN system to provide a request for
adaptation of the configuration based on these requirements, and FAE server
will send these policies to the corresponding Devices (FAE clients). There is
no valid use case identified for this solution.
Solution#17 proposes to support FAE server acting as TSN AF without SEAL,
which depends TSC capabilities specified on Rel-16 3GPP TS 23.501 [7] and
solutions currently studied in 3GPP TR 23.700-20 [13].
Solution#22 proposes an architecture to expose Time Sensitive Communication
(TSC) capabilities of the 5G system which supports integration with an IEEE
TSN system as well as 5G-native (i.e. non-TSN) TSC services. Due to the common
nature of these TSC capabilities (which can be used by various verticals), it
is proposed to enhance the SEAL.
Solution#22 will be considered for normative work as the proposed solution
addresses the generic service requirements common across different verticals.
It provides a solution at the SEAL enabling layer compared to Solutions #16
and #17 which are only applicable for FF applications.
### 8.3.6 Overall evaluation of solutions for key issue#5
Key issue#5 corresponds to the QoS monitoring capabilities of the 5G network.
2 solutions are proposed in this document.
Solution#8 proposes to address the issue via the NEF, according to the
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [12] clause 4.15. NEF supports APIs of
exposure of network events, analytics for QoS monitoring.
Solution#10 proposes a solution where the SEAL NRM service enabler is enhanced
with QoS monitoring. The NRM service will make use of the NEF QoS monitoring
capabilities.
As the QoS monitoring requirements are not specific to FFAPP, it is therefore
better supported in the common SEAL layer to also address other verticals, as
also recommended in the evaluation of Solution #8 in clause 7.8.2.
### 8.3.7 Overall evaluation of solutions for key issue#6
Key issue#6 corresponds to 5GLAN group management for FFAPP. One solution is
proposed in this document.
For issue a & issue b, solution#9 addresses these issues.Solution #9 proposes
to enhance SEAL group management service to handle 5GLAN groups based on 5G
core network capabilities.
Solution #9 will be considered for normative work as the proposed solution
addresses the generic service requirements common across different verticals.
### 8.3.8 Overall evaluation of solutions for key issue#7
Key issue#7 corresponds to Device onboarding for FFAPP. There is no solution
proposed in this document.
For issue a, no solution was proposed for this open issue.
For issue b, annex A captures analysis of oneM2M and possible relationship
with FFAPP.
For issue c, no solution was proposed for this open issue.
Device onboarding is important aspect, which found solutions in SA2 TS 23.501
[7] and SA3 TS 33.501 [40] Rel17 work. If any enhancements are identified for
SEAL or FAE server over the existing 5GC capabilities will be considered
during normative work.
### 8.3.9 Overall evaluation of solutions for key issue#8
Key issue#8 corresponds to the communication of FF application requirements
with the 5G network. 4 solutions are proposed in this document.
Solution#2 proposes that the application requirements are collected by the FAE
server and further the related connectivity is established by translating the
application requirements to 3GPP transport requirements and interacting with
the underlying 3GPP system.
Solution#11 proposes that application requirements are collected or fetched by
the FAE server and further the related connectivity is established by
translating the application requirements to 3GPP transport requirements and
interacting with the underlying 3GPP system.
Solution#19 proposes to re-use SEAL\'s NRM server functionality specified in
clause 14.3.4 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [8] and enhance it to consider translation of
all vertical application requirements to 3GPP system\'s transport layer
requirements.
Solution#22 proposes that application requirements are collected by the SEAL
NRM server which exposes Time Sensitive Communication (TSC) capabilities of
the 5G system. While the solution supports the non-TSN case (5G-native) which
is the subject of KI#8, it also supports the integration with an IEEE TSN
system. Due to the common nature of these TSC capabilities (which can be used
by various verticals), it is proposed to expose it by the SEAL layer.
The solutions propose the following for the expression of service
requirements:
\- Solution#2 proposes that the service requirement from the source includes
packet size, packet transmission interval, packet processing latency, allowed
packet loss rate/packet loss amount/packet error rate, etc.
\- Solution#11 and solution#19 do not provide the details of the service
requirements.
\- Solution#22 proposes to express the service requirements as described in
IEEE 802.1Qcc [25], such as traffic class, traffic specification including
MaxFrameInterval, MaxFrameSize, MaxIntervalFrames, MaxLatency.
The solutions propose the following for translating the service requirements
to transport QoS requirement for communication with the 3GPP core network:
\- Solution#2 and Solution#11 specify that FAE server determines the transport
QoS requirements given the service requirements as input. Such mechanism is
assumed to be as per implementation usually considering the mapping of the
service requirements to 3GPP transport QoS requirements specified by SA1.
\- Solution#19 specifies that NRM server should be responsible for such
translation between service requirements and transport QoS requirement to
communication with 3GPP core network.
\- Solution#22 specifies that the NRM server determines the transport QoS
requirements based on the service requirements in line with IEEE 802.1Qcc
[25].
Solution#22 can be considered for normative work as the proposed solution
addresses the generic service requirements common across different verticals.
It provides a solution at the SEAL enabling layer compared to Solutions #2 and
#11 which are only applicable for FF applications.
Further work during normative phase can consider whether and how the
mechanisms proposed by solution#2 and solution#11 can be introduced in SEAL by
possibly generalizing the application/service requirements across the
verticals.
### 8.3.10 Overall evaluation of solutions for key issue#9

to-end QoS flows in the 5GS. This will enable an FF application to request
configuration of TSC QoS flows between UEs within the 5GS via the NRM-S
reference point. The SEAL NRM server will perform QoS coordination for the set
of UEs and their respective QoS flows. In this case the NRM-S reference point
will specify a 3GPP protocol for this interaction. The NRM server will

###### ## Annex A: Analysis of relationship between oneM2M and FF architecture
# Annex A.1 Overview
In oneM2M TS-0001[9], the oneM2M functional architecture comprises the
following functions: Application Entity (AE), Common Services Entity (CSE),
Underlying Network Services Entity (NSE).
oneM2M CSE provides services to applications (AE) which are referred to as
Common Services Functions (CSFs). The CSFs contained inside the CSE includes
such as: Application and Service Layer Management, Communication Management
and Delivery Handling, Data Management and Repository, Device Management,
Security, Subscription and Notification etc. Those CSFs can support Device
onboarding requirement in Factory.
There are 3 different field node (UE) types defined in oneM2M: Application
Service Node (ASN), Middle Node (MN) and Application Dedicated Node (ADN). The
ASN UE and MN UE consists of both AE (ASN/MN-AE) and CSE (ASN/MN-CSE) function
entity. But ADN UE only consists of AE (ADN-AE) function entity.
There are 1 infrastructure node (Server) type defined in oneM2M -
Infrastructure Node (IN). The IN server consists AE (IN-AE) and CSE (IN-CSE)
function entity.
The relationship between oneM2M architecture function model and FFAPP function
model is described in clause Annex A.2.

###### ## Annex B: Integration with Operation Technologies
# B.1 Overview
This analysis corresponds to the key issue #10 on Integration with Existing
Operation Technologies.
3GPP TS 22.104 [3] Figure C.5-1 shows a simplified version of the
communication stack. The PHY layer, the MAC layer and some parts of the IP
layer are part of the 3GPP network. The layers that are part of the 3GPP
network are referred to as lower communication layers (LCL). The OSI layers
(the transport layer, the session layer, the presentation layer, the
application layer) related to providing data to the application are referred
to as the higher communication layers (HCL). The interface between LCL and HCL
is referred to as communication service interface (CSIF).
3GPP network provides LCL of communication function (industrial radio
communication) for distributed automation application system. Fieldbuses using
serial communication (e.g., PROFIBUS DP, Modbus RTU, CC-Link, etc.) and
Industrial Ethernet networks (e.g., EtherNet/IP, Modbus TCP, POWERLINK,
EtherCAT, CC-Link IE Field, etc.) also provide LCL of communication function
(industrial wired network communication). The TSN technology is used to
support real-time control and synchronization of high-performance machines
over a single, standard Ethernet network, supporting multi-vendor
interoperability and integration. In order to enable seamless interoperability
with existing wired networks, the 5G network needs to be end-to-end integrated
into the industrial network control and management process using TSN.
The higher communication layers (HCL) can be provided by communication in
automation technologies (e.g., OPC UA, PROFINET, etc.).
###### ## Annex C: Analysis of relationship between OPC UA and FF architecture
# C.1 Overview
OPC 10000-1 [20] presents the concepts and overview of OPC UA. OPC UA is
applicable to components in all industrial domains, such as industrial sensors
and actuators, control systems, Manufacturing Execution Systems and Enterprise
Resource Planning Systems, including the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT),
Machine To Machine (M2M) as well as Industrie 4.0. These systems are intended
to exchange information and to use command and control for industrial
processes. OPC UA defines a common infrastructure model to facilitate this
information exchange by specifies the following:
\- The information model to represent structure, behaviour and semantics.
\- The message model to interact between applications.
\- The communication model to transfer the data between end-points.
\- The conformance model to guarantee interoperability between systems.
The OPC UA specifications are layered to isolate the core design from the
underlying computing technology and network transport. This allows OPC UA to
be mapped to future technologies as necessary, without negating the basic
design. Mappings and data encodings are described in OPC 10000-6 [21]. Three
data encodings are defined:
\- XML/text
\- UA Binary
\- JSON
In addition, several protocols are defined:
\- OPC UA TCP
\- HTTPS
\- WebSockets
The OPC UA systems architecture models Clients and Servers as interacting
partners (Client Server model using TCP, HTTPS, WebSockets as transport
protocols). OPC UA Client can send and receive OPC UA Service requests and
responses to the OPC UA Server. OPC UA Client also can send publishing
requests and receive notifications to the OPC UA Server. OPC UA Server to OPC
UA Server interactions in the Client Server model are interactions in which
one Server acts as a Client of another Server, it supports aggregation of data
from lower-layer Servers and concentrator interfaces to Clients for single
points of access to multiple underlying Servers. OPC UA Connection establishes
a full duplex channel between a Client and Server by TCP/IP and WebSockets.A
socket is the TransportConnection in the TCP/IP implementation. The URL scheme
for endpoints using OPC UA TCP is \"opc.tcp\".
In addition to the Client Server model, OPC UA defines a mechanism for
Publishers to transfer the information to Subscribers using the PubSub model
which is described in OPC 10000-14 [22] (PubSub model using UDP, Ethernet,
AMQP, MQTT as transport protocols). With PubSub, OPC UA Applications do not
directly exchange requests and responses. Instead, Publishers send messages to
a Message Oriented Middleware, without knowledge of what, if any, Subscribers
there may be. Similarly, Subscribers express interest in specific types of
data, and process messages that contain this data, without knowledge of what
Publishers there are. Message Oriented Middleware is software or hardware
infrastructure supporting sending and receiving messages between distributed
systems.
To cover a large number of use cases, OPC UA PubSub supports two largely
different Message Oriented Middleware variants. These are:
\- A broker-less form, where the Message Oriented Middleware is the network
infrastructure that is able to route datagram-based messages. Subscribers and
Publishers use datagram protocols like UDP multicast.
\- A broker-based form, where the Message Oriented Middleware is a Broker.
Subscribers and Publishers use standard messaging protocols like AMQP or MQTT
to communicate with the Broker. All messages are published to specific queues
(e.g. topics, nodes) that the Broker exposes and Subscribers can listen to
these queues. The Broker may translate messages from the formal messaging
protocol of the Publisher to the formal messaging protocol of the Subscriber.
OPC UA covers the communication and information layer of reference
architecture model for Industrie 4.0 which is defined in RAMI4.0 [23].
Specially, for communication in the field OPC UA now start to design to use
UDP and specialized protocols like TSN or 5G for deterministic communication
by PubSub extensions.
3GPP TS 22.104 [3] defines service requirements for vertical applications
(e.g., mobile robots and augmented reality, etc.). 3GPP TS 22.263 [24] defines
service requirements for video, imaging and audio for professional
applications (VIAPA). The OPC UA information modelling framework turns data
into information. OPC UA provides information models to support vertical
applications (e.g., Robotics, Machine Vision, etc.)
Editor\'s Note: Relationship between OPC-UA and FFAPP is FFS.
###### ## Annex D (informative): Deployment Models
# D.1 General
This clause describes some possible deployments of the functional model
provided in clause 7.1.
In FF scenarios, there are different domains which need to be captured:
**\- OT production domain** : the communications infrastructure on the factory
premises used by real-time and non-real-time control systems. This may
comprise both 3GPP (e.g. 5G NPN) and non-3GPP networks.
**\- IT enterprise domain** : the communications infrastructure on the factory
premises used for non-real-time resource planning and supervision. In this
domain the management/provisiong of IIOT applications may be handled.
**\- Service providers domain** : the communication infrastructure used for
the purposes of network configuration, management and commissioning. This may
be deployed by the factory operator or 3^rd^ party service provider. MNO may
also be part of the service providers domain, in scenarios when the factory
uses private slices by the PLMN.
The enabler layer (FAE, SEAL layer) may be deployed as part of the different
domains; this can be as part of the OT domain or PLMN/NPN operator domain, or
at the FF application service provider domain (this can be at IT enterprise
domain or service provider\'s domain), or at 3^rd^ party service provider\'s
domain.
Editor\'s Note: Here, for simplicity we assume that SEAL layer is co-located
with FAE layer. However, FAE and SEAL may be in different domains (enhancement
of SEAL deployment models for FF use cases is FFS).
# D.2 FAE/SEAL Server deployment in PLMN/NPN operator domain
In this deployment, the enabler layer (FAE/SEAL server) resides at the
NPN/PLMN operator domain and can be seen as PLMN/NPN-owned application entity
which supports the exposure of northbound APIs to the IT enterprise / service
providers domain (depending on where the application specific services are
deployed). Also, with this deployment, the FAE / SEAL servers can support the
the real-time interactions between the applications at the devices and the
network side, e.g. for device communication management (e.g QoS).
Figure D.2-1: FAE/SEAL Server at PLMN/NPN operator domain
Editor\'s Note: In this deployment, both single-PLMN/NPN and multi-PLMN/NPN
deployment options may exist. It is FFS to further investigate deployments
within PLMN/NPN domain, based on multi-PLMN and PLMN-NPN interactions.
# D.3 FAE/SEAL Server deployment at FAE/SEAL service provider domain
In this deployment, the enabler layer (FAE/SEAL server) resides at the
FAE/SEAL provider domain, on top of the 5G NPN (e.g. at IT enterprise domain).
In this deployment, the FAE/SEAL layer supports the non-real-time resource
planning and supervision of IIOT applications. One particular example may be
the co-location of FAE/SEAL layer for supporting device management services
(e.g. device provisioning, onboarding/offboarding, connectivity).
Figure D.3-1: FAE/SEAL Server at FAE/SEAL service provider domain
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS to further investigate centralized and distributed
deployments within FAE/SEAL service provider domain.
# D.4 FAE/SEAL Server deployment at FF application service provider domain
In this deployment, the enabler layer (FAE/SEAL server) resides at the FF
application service provider\'s domain. The FAE/SEAL layer supports the
control/influence of the network configuration, management and commissioning
by the service provider.
Figure D.4-1: FAE/SEAL Server at FF application service provider domain
Editor\'s Note: It is FFS to further investigate centralized and distributed
deployments within FF application service provider domain.
