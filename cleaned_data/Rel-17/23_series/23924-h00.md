# Introduction
The solution for support of the Intra Domain Connection of RAN Nodes to
Multiple CN Nodes for GSM and UMTS systems in TS 23.236 [2] has some issues
for MSC Pool with existing deployments and implementations, e.g. upgrade of
existing nodes. This TR studies whether these issues can be resolved by
deploying a function above the BSC/RNC nodes which provides similar functions
as the NNSF in BSC/RNC nodes that is specified in TS 23.236 [2].
# 1 Scope
This Technical Report evaluates the feasibility of implementing a function
above the BSC/RNC nodes to provide similar functions as the NNSF function in
BSC/RNC nodes that is specified in TS 23.236 [2]. This Technical Report also
identifies the impacts on specifications.

SNSF Serving Node Selection Function
# 4 General Description
## 4.1 Architecture Assumptions
Figure 4.1-1 illustrates the set of network elements related to deploying the
SNSF node for MSC Pool.
Figure 4.1-1: Network Architecture of deploying SNSF node for MSC Pool
Serving Node Selection Function is a newly introduced function which is
between the BSC/RNC nodes with the MSC Servers for control plane. As
implementation options, SNSF node is a logical function; it may be standalone
or co-located with existing nodes. See clause 5.6 for the detail of the SNSF
processing.
To resolve the issues identified from deploying NNSF within the BSC/RNC nodes
for MSC pool illustrated in clause 4.2 and to avoid any potential update
requirement on existing BSC/RNC equipments, the A/Iu-CS interface is used
between BSC/RNC with SNSF.
## 4.2 Overview
### 4.2.1 Issues with deploying NNSF in BSC nodes for MSC pool
In certain networks and with certain implementations, some deployment issues
have been identified relative to the deployment of the MSC Pool feature as
specified in TS 23.236 [2]. Such issues associated with deploying NNSF in
BSC/RNC for MSC pool are described in the following clauses.
#### 4.2.1.1 In certain networks some existing BSC/RNC nodes do not support
the feature
In certain networks, most of the existing BSC/RNC nodes do not support the
feature, and it is not easy to update them to support the feature and to be
maintained in the future. New BSC/RNC nodes can be required to support the
function, but some of the existing BSC/RNC can not be upgraded. Therefore the
advantage of deploying MSC Pool can not be fully exploited within certain
networks.
Figure 4.2.1.1.1: Part of BSC/RNC nodes support connecting to multiple MSS
In the real-world example provided in Figure 4.2.1.1.1, nine BSC/RNC nodes do
not support MSC Pool feature while two other ones support it. Only for mobile
stations moving with the coverage of the 2 BSC/RNC nodes, which support NNSF
and where the NNSF function is enabled, the interaction between MSC servers
and HLR and inter-MSC handover are reduced, while moving to the coverage of
any other BSC/RNC nodes, the interaction and the handover will still be
required as if no MSC Pool feature is deployed. And when MS is in the coverage
of one of the other 9 BSC/RNC nodes that do not support NNSF, only one MSC
server that the BSC/RNC node connects to can serve for the subscriber, thus
the resources of the MSC servers in this pool area cannot be shared. Very
little advantages could be seen from the feature in such a network
configuration.
#### 4.2.1.2 Mesh TDM circuit connection between BSCs with MSCs is required
While deployment of AoIP (A interface bearer over IP) removes the mesh TDM
connection of BSC nodes with MSC nodes, only TDM connections are supported by
the existing BSC, and not all the existing BSC nodes can be updated to IP
mode. The mesh TDM circuit connection between BSC nodes with MSC nodes is
still a deployment issue in the absence of AoIP, and is described in this
clause.
If the MSC Pool feature is deployed per TS 23.236 [2], the feature enabled BSC
will be required to have signaling and bearer connection with all the MSCs in
the pool area. Figure 4.2.1.2.1 shows the mesh connection between 3 BSC/RNC
nodes and 3 MSCs.
Figure 4.2.1.2.1: BSC/RNC connects to each MSS in the pool area
That is, the mesh TDM circuit connections between BSC with MSC Servers will be
required because each BSC is needed to be able to connect to each MSC server
in the pool area, and it will be extremely hard to implement as the POOL scale
increases. When adding a new MSC into the pool area, the TDM circuit
connection between all the BSCs with the new MSC must be installed (either by
re-planing the TDM circuits between the BSCs with the MSCs or installing new
circuits between the BSCs with the new MSC).
A physical mesh connection can be avoided by introducing virtual MGWs between
BSCs and MSC servers, but the TDM circuit configuration between each pair of
BSC and MSC is still required as shown in Figure 4.2.1.2.2. The TDM circuits
between each pair of BSC and MSC can not be used by any other pair, e.g.
circuits used for the pair BSC 1 and MSC 1 can not be re-used for the pair BSC
1 and MSC 2. Thus, the usage of the TDM circuits (specifically, the circuits
in each BSC -- virtual MGW pair) is limited by configuration. Any changes in
the core network (e.g. adding a new MSC into the pool area) will require the
TDM circuits between the BSCs with the virtual MGWs to be re-installed (either
by re-planing the TDM circuit configuration between the BSCs with the virtual
MGWs or by installing new TDM circuits, i.e. adding new TDM circuits between
BSCs with the virtual MGW for the new MSC).
Figure 4.2.1.2.2: MGW between BSCs and MSC servers used as intermediary node
But if each BSC/RNC only connects with one or two intermediary nodes, thus
keeping the number of intermediary nodes small, it will mitigate the
abovementioned need as shown in figure 4.2.1.2.3 that illustrates just a
single intermediary node..
See clause 4.9.1 for BSC/RNC is connected to several intermediate nodes for
the control plane.
Figure 4.2.1.2.3: BSC and MSS connect to a single intermediary node
Furthermore, if the TDM circuits are reused between each pair of BSC and MSC,
the likelihood of circuit exhaust will be much less, for example by means of
managing the TDM circuits between the intermediary node and BSC nodes as
normal resources and managed by the intermediary node itself.
#### 4.2.1.3 Complex O&M
When NNSF is deployed within the BSC/RNC, any O&M operation related to NNSF
functionality (e.g adding a new MSC into the pool area) will require the O&M
centre to interact with each MSC Pool enabled BSC/RNC node individually. As
the number of BSC/RNC nodes in a network increases, the complexity of O&M
increases in proportion.
Figure 4.2.1.3.1: O&M centre send O&M command to all MSC Pool enabled
BSCs/RNCs and MSSs
But if the NNSF is implemented in a small number of nodes, it will simplify
the complexity of O&M.
### 4.2.2 Implementing SNSF outside of the BSC/RNC nodes
Deploying NNSF not in the BSC/RNC nodes but instead in standalone intermediary
nodes as Serving Node Selection Function (SNSF) or co-locating with some other
nodes as illustrated in figure 4.2.2.1, it will be much easier to resolve the
problems captured in clause 4.2.1.
Figure 4.2.2.1: Deploying SNSF outside of the BSC/RNC nodes
The NAS Node Selection Function is as specified in TS 23.236 [2] to assign
specific network resources (i.e. MSC or SGSN) to serve a mobile station and
subsequently route the traffic to the assigned network resource. The NRI
identifies the specific CN node. The Serving Node Selection Function (SNSF) is
above the BSC/RNC nodes to provide similar functions with NNSF as specified in
TS 23.236 [2], has a CN node address configured for the NRI derived from the
initial NAS signalling message or from the LLC frame then this message or
frame is routed to this address. If no CN node address is configured for the
derived NRI or if no NRI can be derived (e.g. the MS indicated an identity
which contains no NRI) then the Serving Node Selection Function selects an
available CN node (e.g. according to load balancing) and routes the message or
LLC frame to the selected CN node.
### 4.2.3 Issues with deploying NNSF in BSC nodes for SGSN pool
In the progress of this study, there have been no contributions on the topic
of SGSN Pool; as such, SGSN Pool is considered as being out of the scope of
this feasibility study.
## 4.3 Load Balancing
The Serving Node Selection Function balances the signalling load between the
available MSC Servers same as specified in clause 4.5 of TS 23.236 [2]. The
load-balancing algorithm is implementation specific.
## 4.4 Load Re-Distribution
Signalling load re-distribution shall be performed as the procedures defined
in clause 4.5a.1 of TS 23.236 [2] that the Serving Node Selection Function
performs the same as the NAS Node Selection Function.
## 4.5 Mobility Management
No impacts upon mobility management result from the deployment of SNSF. See
clause 4.6 of TS 23.236 [2].
## 4.6 Default CN node
No impacts to the default CN node concept result from the deployment of SNSF.
See clause 4.7 of TS 23.236 [2].
## 4.7 Support of combined mobility management procedures
No impacts to the support of combined mobility management procedures result
from the deployment of SNSF. See clause 4.8 of TS 23.236 [2].
The configurations of the Gs interface are illustrated in figure 4.7-2.
Deploying NNSF within the BSS/RAN nodes
Deploying SNSF above the BSS/RAN nodes
Figure 4.7-1: Network Model for using the combined mobility management
## 4.8 Re-use of A-Interface TDM circuits
The method of managing A-interface TDM circuits is independent with the
feasibility study on deploying NNSF above the BSC/RNC nodes. The topic of re-
use of A-Interface TDM circuits is considered as being out of the scope of
this feasibility study.
## 4.9 Redundancy and failover
### 4.9.1 Redundancy and failover in signalling plane
The resilience of a network that is enabled for MSC Pool by means of the SNSF
may be improved by the implementation of nodal redundancy and failover
capabilities at the SNSF. Industry standard techniques that are specific to
the transport type (e.g. SS7, IP) may be applied in order to achieve the
objectives of SNSF redundancy and failover. These techniques typically imply:
1) real-time synchronization of transient data among multiple members of the
redundancy set; and
2) automatic enabling of a back-up or standby member of the redundancy set
when the active member fails.
The use of such techniques is intended to be transparent to the external nodes
that communicate with the redundant node.
### 4.9.2 Redundancy and failover in user plane
The deployment of SNSF node above BSC/RNC has only impact on the control plane
and has no impact on the redundancy and failover in the user plane.
# 5 Functional Description
## 5.1 MS function
The deployment of SNSF has no impact on the MS function. See clause 5.1 of TS
23.236 [2].
## 5.2 RNC Functions
The deployment of SNSF has no impact on the RNC functions, i.e. the RNC
function does not provide the NAS Node Selection Function as specified in TS
23.236 [2].
## 5.3 BSC Functions
The deployment of SNSF has no impact on the BSC functions, i.e. the BSC
function does not provide the NAS Node Selection Function as specified in
clause 5.2 of TS 23.236 [2].
## 5.4 MSC Server Functions
In addition to the functions described in TS 23.236 [2], impacts to MSC Server
functions due to the deployment of SNSF are described in clause 5.6 as
summarized below:
\- If SCCP Local Reference Based Handling of connection-oriented messages is
applied, the MSC Server allocates the local SCCP reference which contains the
local SNRI.
\- If the solution of SNSF broadcasting TDM Circuit Management messages is
applied, the MSC Server handles the received TDM Circuit Management message.
## 5.4a MGW Functions
The deployment of SNSF above BSC/RNC places no requirement on the MGW.
NOTE: As an implementation option, SNSF may be co-located with MGW, and it
does not create new requirements on the logical function of MGW.
## 5.5 SGSN Functions
The deployment of SNSF above BSC/RNC places no requirement on the SGSN.
NOTE: SGSN pools as specified in TS 23.236 [2] are not possible as SNSF does
not provide the NNSF functionality for PS connections.
## 5.6 SNSF Functions
### 5.6.1 General
The SNSF node is used to select the specific MSC Server to which initial NAS
signalling messages or LLC frames are routed. The NRI identifies the specific
CN node. If the SNSF node has a CN node address configured for the NRI derived
from the initial NAS signalling message, or from the LLC frame, then this
message or frame is routed to this address. If no CN node address is
configured for the derived NRI, or if no NRI can be derived (e.g. the MS
indicated an identity which contains no NRI), then the SNSF node selects an
available CN node (e.g. according to load balancing) and routes the message or
LLC frame to the selected CN node.
The SNSF node derives the NRI from the TMSI when the MS is supported in either
Iu-CS mode or A interface mode.
In A/Iu-CS mode, in the event that an MSS/VLR sends a paging-request/paging
with IMSI (i.e. the paging message does not contain a TMSI), the SNSF node
shall, upon reception, temporarily store the Global-CN-ID of the node that
issued the paging-request/paging message. If the SNSF node in A/Iu-CS mode
receives a paging-response with an IMSI, then it should check the temporarily
stored Global-CN-ID on entries matching this IMSI, and forward the paging-
response to the node identified by this Global-CN-ID.
All message sequence charts in the following clauses are examples and
solutions may be implemented using different message sequences from what is
illustrated here.
### 5.6.2 Handling of connection-oriented messages
#### 5.6.2.1 Basic Handling of connection-oriented messages
On receipt the SCCP CR message from the BSC/RNC node, the SNSF node extracts
the TMSI parameter from the layer-3 message and retrieves the NRI parameters
from the TMSI, select and determine the CN node from the NRI parameter as per
specified in clause 5.6.1 and distribute the message to the CN node as
illustrated in figure 5.6.2.1.1. The layer-3 message in the SCCP CR message
may be the Initial MS Message for the A interface mode or the Initial UE
Message for the Iu mode.
Figure 5.6.2.1.1: Service Flow for Basic Handling of connection-oriented
messages
On receipt of the SCCP CC message from the MSS node, the SNSF node creates a
local reference for the SCCP connection towards the BSC/RNC node and return
SCCP CC message to the BSC/RNC node, and stores the combination of the two
SCCP connections, one towards the BSC/RNC and one towards the MSS node.
For subsequent uplink and downlink messages, the SNSF node distributes the
messages as per the combination of the two SCCP connections towards the
BSC/RNC and the MSS nodes respectively, as illustrated in figure 5.6.2.1.1.
The SNSF node should only send SCCP Inactivity Test (IT) message towards the
MSC Server on receipt of SCCP Inactivity Test (IT) message from the BSC/RNC
node. The SNSF node shall not send SCCP Inactivity Test (IT) message towards
the MSC Server if the corresponding SCCP connection towards the BSC/RNC node
has been released. The SNSF node should only send SCCP Inactivity Test (IT)
message towards the BSC/RNC node on receipt of SCCP Inactivity Test (IT)
message from the MSC Server. And the SNSF node shall not send SCCP Inactivity
Test (IT) message towards the BSC/RNC node if the corresponding SCCP
connection towards the MSC Server has been released.
NOTE: On failure of receiving SCCP Inactivity Test (IT) message from the peer
side (i.e. the SNSF node), the MSC Server and the BSC/RNC node will release
the resources related to the SCCP connection.
#### 5.6.2.2 SCCP Local Reference Based Handling of connection-oriented
messages
Similar with distribute message as per the NRI parameter derived from the
TMSI, SCCP Network Resource Identifier (SNRI) may be configured as several
digits out of the SCCP local reference for identifying the MSC Server as
illustrated in figure 5.6.2.2.1.
Figure 5.6.2.2.1: SNRI based distribution of uplink messages (SCCP connection
established by the RAN)
On receipt of the initial SCCP CR message, the SNSF retrieves the NRI
parameter from the TMSI from the layer 3 message and selects the MSC Server as
specified in clause 5.6.1 and distribute the message to the destination MSC
Server. The layer-3 message in the SCCP CR message may be the Initial MS
Message for the A interface mode or the Initial UE Message for the Iu mode.
On receipt of the initial SCCP CR message, the MSC Server allocates the SCCP
local reference for the connection which contains the local SCCP Network
Resource Identifier (SNRI) as configured for the MSC Server, and returns the
local reference by the source local reference to the BSC through the SNSF. The
SNSF routes the message towards the BSC/RNC node as per the destination
signalling point code retrieved from the SCCP CC message.
For subsequent uplink messages, the SNSF retrieves the SNRI parameter from the
destination local reference and distributes the message as per the SNRI
parameter. For subsequent downlink messages, the SNSF routes the message
towards the BSC/RNC node as per the destination signalling point code
retrieved from the SCCP message.
The SNSF shall not generate SCCP Inactivity Test (IT) messages by its own, but
shall route uplink and downlink SCCP Inactivity Test (IT) messages as
specified above for subsequent uplink and downlink messages.
NOTE: On failure of receiving SCCP Inactivity Test (IT) message from the peer
side (i.e. the SNSF), the MSC Server and the BSC/RNC node will release the
resources related to the SCCP connection.
In this approach, the SNSF does not need to store or handle states of the SCCP
connections established between the RAN node and the MSC server. SCCP messages
for the same call may be distributed via different SNSFs (e.g. upon the
failure of an SNSF).
The principles specified in this clause for SNRI based distribution of uplink
connection oriented messages are also applicable to scenarios where the SCCP
connection is established by the MSC Server, e.g. Handover Request procedure.
In those scenarios, the MSC Server allocates and includes the SNRI within the
SCCP local reference in the SCCP CR message (see figure 5.6.2.2.2). The SNSF
distributes the SCCP CC message and subsequent uplink connection oriented
messages as per the SCCP destination local reference.
Figure 5.6.2.2.2: SNRI based distribution of uplink messages\ (SCCP connection
established by the MSC Server)
**Basic configuration needed for one pool:**
\- For an MSC pool, the range of the SNRI bits out of the SCCP local reference
shall be the same for SNSFs and MSC Servers. This range shall be configurable
in SNSFs and MSC servers.
\- The mapping from the SNRI to the MSC Servers shall follow the configuration
in the MSC Servers.
\- the SNRI should contain at most 5 bits (this allows the pool to contain up
to 32 MSC Servers without impacting the maximum number of calls an MSC Server
may support).
A sample of the range of the SNRI bits out of local reference in the CN side
is illustrated in figure 5.6.2.2.

Figure 5.6.2.2: A sample of the range of the SNRI bits out of local reference
in the CN side
NOTE: The configurations of NRI and SNRI are irrelative. With the nature both
NRI and SNRI identifies the MSC Server, the two sets of identifiers may be
unified or one set can be map to another one (e.g. several NRI map to one
SNRI).
### 5.6.3 Handling of connectionless messages
Service flows are described in this clause for the BSSAP/RANAP connectionless
messages.
#### 5.6.3.1 UTRAN
##### 5.6.3.1.1 Reset
##### 5.6.3.1.1.1 UTRAN Initiated RESET {#utran-initiated-reset .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.1.1.1: UTRAN initiated RESET procedure
In the event of a failure at the UTRAN which has resulted in the loss of
transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to all MSC
Servers towards which the RNC has Iu signalling connections established. This
message is used by the MSC Server to release affected Radio Access Bearers and
to erase all affected references for the sending RNC.
On receipt of the RNC initiated RESET message, the SNSF node forward the RESET
message to all the MSC Servers and starts a Timer to waiting for the RESET
ACKNOWLEDGE from the MSC Server. On receipt of the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE messages
from all the MSC Server, the SNSF node sends a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message
towards the RNC and stops the Timer. If the Timer fires and the SNSF node has
not received RESET ACKNOWLEDGE messages from all the MSC Servers, the SNSF
node stops the timer and the RNC may re-send the RESET message as defined in
clause 8.26.3.2 of TS 25.413 [3].
##### 5.6.3.1.1.2 CN Initiated RESET {#cn-initiated-reset .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.1.2.1: RESET procedure initiated from part of the MSC Servers
According to TS 25.413 [3], in the event of a failure at the CN, which has
resulted in the loss of transaction reference information, a RESET message
shall be sent to the RNC. On receipt of the RESET message, the UTRAN releases
affected Radio Access Bearers and clears all the affected references.
The RNC should normally have Radio Access Bearers and Iu resources that are
handled by other MSC Servers of the pool, and these resources shall not be
released while resources handled by the resetting MSC Server should normally
be released.
Based on that, the SNSF shall not relay towards the RNC the RESET message
which is received from only part of the MSC Servers, and may isolate the MSC
Servers for a preconfigured period. During that period, the SNSF does not
transfer any message towards the isolated MSC Server. The affected Radio
Access Bearers and the affected references with the isolated MSC Server will
be release during the isolation period by some mechanisms, e.g. by the
subscriber hanging up the call or by the SCCP Inactivity Test procedure. The
SNSF shall then return a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message to the resetting MSC.
NOTE 1: ITU-T Recommendation Q.714 [6] defines a range from 11 to 21 minutes
for the SCCP T(iar) timer; in practice, all the calls should be released
within few tens of seconds by subscribers hanging up the call.
NOTE 2: Immediately returning a RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message to the MSC Server
without any isolation period prevents failure of subsequent mobile terminated
calls or signalling (e.g. Short Message), as well as possible unbalanced load
distribution on the MSC Servers of the pool. E.g. subscribers affected by the
resetting MSC Server will hang up and re-establish a new call immediately,
which will lead the SNSF to re-allocate the subscribers to other MSC Servers
of the pool if the resetting MSC Server is isolated.
NOTE 3: Without an isolation period, the MSC Server may allocate to new calls
an Iu signalling connection not yet freed in the RNC for earlier calls. This
is not a concern if the RNC accepts the new call and releases the old call in
that circumstances.
If the SNSF received RESET messages from all the MSC Servers towards a RNC
node within the MSC Pool Area during the period of the isolation, the SNSF may
send a RESET message to the destination RNC. On receipt of the RESET
ACKNOWLEDGE message from the RNC, the SNSF forwards the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE
message to all the MSC Servers.
Figure 5.6.3.1.1.2.2: RESET procedure initiated from all the MSC Servers
NOTE 4: If a RNC connects with multiple SNSFs, the MSC Servers shall be
configured to one of the SNSFs that the MSC Servers shall send the RESET
messages to. The MSC Servers should only send the RESET message to the
preconfigured SNSF when the RESET procedure is initiated towards the RNC.
NOTE 5: Since it is unlikely that all the MSC Servers of the pool reset at the
same time (i.e. during the same short period), an SNSF can handle this
scenario as it handles RESET initiated by part of the MSC Servers of the pool.
##### 5.6.3.1.2 Overload Control
The Overload Control procedure is defined to give some degree of signalling
flow control according to TS 25.413 [3]. See clause 8.25 of TS 25.413 [3] for
detail of the philosophy and the algorithm used.
##### 5.6.3.1.2.1 UTRAN Initiated Overload Control {#utran-initiated-overload-
control .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.2.1.1: Overload at the UTRAN
If the UTRAN is overloaded, it will send an OVERLOAD message towards the MSC
Servers which the RNC node connects with. On receipt of the RNC initiated
OVERLOAD message, the SNSF node should broadcast this message to all the MSC
Servers.
##### 5.6.3.1.2.2 CN Initiated Overload Control {#cn-initiated-overload-
control .H6}
##### 5.6.3.1.2.2.1 Overload at parts of the MSC Servers {#overload-at-parts-
of-the-msc-servers .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.2.2.1.1: Overload at parts of the MSC Servers
The MSC Server should indicate to the RNC that it is in a congested state by
sending an OVERLOAD message. On reception of the message, the UTRAN should
cause reduction of signalling traffic towards the MSC Server. When the SNSF is
deployed above the UTRAN, if only part of the MSC Servers are in a congested
state, the OVERLOAD message should not be sent to the RNC nodes, otherwise,
the RNC will reduce signalling traffic towards all the MSC Servers. The SNSF
node should adjusts load balance arithmetic to reduce congested MSC Server
traffic and add other normal MSC Server traffic.
##### 5.6.3.1.2.2.2 Overload at all the MSC Servers {#overload-at-all-the-msc-
servers .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.2.2.2.1: Overload at all of the CN
On receipt of all OVERLOAD messages from all the MSC Servers within a period
TIMER (the TIMER is configurable with operator\'s decision), the SNSF node
relays one of the received OVERLOAD messages to the destination RNC node. On
reception of the message, the UTRAN will reduce signalling traffic towards the
CN.
NOTE: If an RNC node connects with multiple SNSF nodes, the MSC Servers shall
be configured to one of the SNSF nodes that the MSC Servers shall send the
OVERLOAD messages to. The MSC Servers should only send the OVERLOAD message to
the preconfigured SNSF node when the OVERLOAD procedure is initiated towards
the RNC.
##### 5.6.3.1.3 Reset Resource
##### 5.6.3.1.3.1 UTRAN Initiated Reset Resource {#utran-initiated-reset-
resource .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.1.2.1: UTRAN initiated RESET RESOURCE procedure
According to TS 25.413 [3], in the event of an abnormal failure, the RNC may
send a RESET RESOURCE message (including the list of Iu Signalling Connection
Identifiers) to release the corresponding CN resources.
The Iu Signalling Connection Identifiers may have been allocated by the RNC or
the MSC Server.
The MSC Server should include the SNRI in the Iu signalling connection ID it
allocates.
Upon receipt of a RESET RESOURCE message from the RNC, the SNSF should
broadcast the RESET RESOURCE message including RNC-initiated or/and MSC-
initiated Iu Signalling Connection Ids to all MSC Servers. At the expiration
of a guard timer, the SNSF returns a RESET RESOURCE ACK to the RNC.
As an implementation option, the SNSF may distribute a RESET RESOURCE message
including only MSC-initiated Iu Signalling Connection Ids only to the right
MSC Server(s) using the SRNI contained within the Iu Signalling Connection
Ids.
In this approach, the SNSF does not need to store call related information.
NOTE: Including the SNRI in an MSC-initiated Iu signalling connection ID
enables the SNSF to route the RESET RESOURCE message to the right MSC
Server(s), but also the MSC Servers to recognize their own MSC-initiated Iu
signalling connection Ids if the RESET RESOURCE message is distributed to all
MSC Servers.

##### 5.6.3.1.3.2.1 Alternative 1: Broadcast Based {#alternative-1-broadcast-
based .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.3.2.1.1: MSC Server initiated Reset Resource Procedure
The MSC Server initiates the procedure by sending a RESET RESOURCE message to
the RNC. On receipt of the MSC RESET RESOURCE message, the SNSF node transfers
this message to the destination RNC.
On reception of this message the RNC shall release the local resources and
references (i.e. radio resources and Iu signalling connection identifiers)
associated to the specific MSC Server and Iu signalling connection identifiers
indicated in the received message. The RNC shall always return the RESET
RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message to the MSC Server when all Iu-related resources
and references have been released. On receipt of the RNC RESET RESOURCE
ACKNOWLEDGE message, the SNSF node broadcasts this message to all the MSC
Servers. The MSC Servers shall ignore the RESET RESOURCE ACKNOWLEDGE message
if no corresponding pending RESET RESOURCE procedures are matched locally.
##### 5.6.3.1.3.2.2 Alternative 2: Mapping RESET to RESET Resource
{#alternative-2-mapping-reset-to-reset-resource .H6}
For RANAP RESET message from MSC-S, the handling is similar to BSSAP as
described in clause 5.6.3.2.1.2.2 but instead of mapping the RESET to RESET
Circuit including CIC, the SNSF maps the RESET from MSC-S to RESET Resource
message including the Iu Signalling Connection Identifier.
##### 5.6.3.1.4 ERROR INDICATION
##### 5.6.3.1.4.1 UTRAN Initiated Error Indication {#utran-initiated-error-
indication .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.4.1.1: Error Indication procedure, RNC originated
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by an RNC node to report detected
errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by an
appropriate failure message. On receipt of the RNC ERROR INDICATION message,
the SNSF broadcasts this message to all the MSC Servers in the Pool Area.
##### 5.6.3.1.4.2 CN Initiated Error Indication {#cn-initiated-error-
indication .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.4.2.1: CN initiated Error Indication procedure
On receipt of the MSC Server initiated ERROR INDICATION message, the SNSF
transfers this message to the destination RNC as per the destination
Signalling Point Code received from the MSC Server.
##### 5.6.3.1.5 INFORMATION TRANSFER
Figure 5.6.3.1.5.1: Information Transfer Procedure
On receipt of the MSC INFORMATION TRANSFER INDICATION message, the SNSF
transfers this message to the destination RNC. On receipt of INFORMATION
TRANSFER CONFIRMATION or INFORMATION TRANSFER FAILURE message from the RNC,
the SNSF broadcasts this message to all the MSC Servers in the Pool Area. The
MSC Server shall ignore this message if no corresponding pending Information
Transfer procedures are matched locally by checking if the _Information
Transfer ID_ is allocated locally.
##### 5.6.3.1.6 Direct Information Transfer
##### 5.6.3.1.6.1 UTRAN Initiated Direct Information Transfer {#utran-
initiated-direct-information-transfer .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.6.1.1: Direct Information Transfer initiated from the RNC
The purpose of the Direct Information Transfer procedure is to transfer some
information from the RNC to the CN. The procedure is initiated with a DIRECT
INFORMATION TRANSFER message sent from the RNC to the CN. On receipt of the
RNC DIRECT INFORMATION TRANSFER message, the SNSF broadcasts this message to
all the MSC Servers in the Pool Area.
##### 5.6.3.1.6.2 CN Initiated Direct Information Transfer {#cn-initiated-
direct-information-transfer .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.6.2.1: Direct Information Transfer initiated from the CN
The purpose of the Direct Information Transfer procedure is to transfer some
information from the CN to the RNC. The procedure is initiated with a DIRECT
INFORMATION TRANSFER message sent from the CN to the RNC. On receipt of the
MSC DIRECT INFORMATION TRANSFER message, the SNSF transfers this message to
the destination RNC.
##### 5.6.3.1.7 Uplink Information Exchange
Figure 5.6.3.1.7.2: Uplink Information Exchange procedure
On receipt of the RNC UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE REQUEST message, the SNSF
broadcasts the message to all the MSC Servers in the Pool Area. On receipt of
an MSC UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE FAILURE/RESPONSE message from all the MSC
Servers in the Pool Area within a period TIMER (where TIMER is an operator
matter), the SNSF transfers the latest UPLINK INFORMATION EXCHANGE
FAILURE/RESPONSE message to the destination RNC.
##### 5.6.3.1.8 Paging
##### 5.6.3.1.8.1 Paging when RNC connects with one SNSF node {#paging-when-
rnc-connects-with-one-snsf-node .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.8.1.1: Paging procedure. RNC connect with one SNSF node
On receipt of the PAGING message, the SNSF node transfers this message to the
destination RNC.
##### 5.6.3.1.8.2 Paging with TMSI when RNC connects with multiple SNSF nodes
{#paging-with-tmsi-when-rnc-connects-with-multiple-snsf-nodes .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.8.2.1: the paging-request/paging with TMSI procedure. RNC
connect multiple SNSF nodes
On receipt of the PAGING message, if the paging type is TMSI paging, the SNSF
node transfers this message to the destination RNC.
##### 5.6.3.1.8.3 Paging with IMSI when RNC connects with multiple SNSF nodes
{#paging-with-imsi-when-rnc-connects-with-multiple-snsf-nodes .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.1.8.3.1: Procedure for Paging with IMSI (RNC connects to multiple
SNSF nodes)
On receipt of the PAGING message, the SNSF transfers this message to the
destination RNC. In case the PAGING message contains IMSI, the SNSF
temporarily stores the mapping between the Global-CN-ID of the node that
issued the paging message and the IMSI.
If the MSS connects with multiple SNSF nodes, the PAGING IMSI NOTIFY message
should be sent to the other SNSF nodes in the Pool Area, and all these SNSF
nodes should temporarily store the mapping between the Global-CN-ID of the
node that issued the paging message and the IMSI.
NOTE 1: The Paging response message may be reported via an SNSF node other
than the one that received the original PAGING request message. To ensure that
all SNSF nodes are able to route the PAGING response message correctly, it is
proposed to notify the other SNSF nodes by means of the PAGING IMSI NOTIFY
message.
NOTE 2: The PAGING_IMSI_NOTIFY message may be a RANAP message and an option
whether it needs to be sent or not. It is implementation specific how this may
be done.
#### 5.6.3.2 GSM
##### 5.6.3.2.1 Reset
##### 5.6.3.2.1.1 GERAN Initiated RESET {#geran-initiated-reset .H6}
The procedure is similar to the procedure specified in clause 5.6.3.1.1.1,
with the following differences according to TS 48.008 [5]:
\- A RESET message is used by the BSS to indicate the MSC Server to release
affected calls and erase all affected references and to put all circuits into
the idle state;
\- Upon receipt of a RESET message from BSS, the MSC Server that does not
allocate the circuits send block messages (BLOCK or CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCK) for
all circuits that were previously locally blocked on the MSC Server side;
On receipt of the RESET message from the BSS via the SNSF, the MSC Server will
release the affected calls and circuits, and will initiate BLOCK or CIRCUIT
GROUP BLOCK procedures for circuits locally blocked on the MSC Server side as
per TS 48.008 [5].
##### 5.6.3.2.1.2 CN Initiated RESET {#cn-initiated-reset-1 .H6}
##### 5.6.3.2.1.2.1 Alternative -1: Broadcast Based {#alternative--
1-broadcast-based .H6}
The procedure is similar to the procedure specified in clause 5.6.3.1.1.2,
with the following differences: according to TS 48.008 [5],
\- A RESET message is used by the BSS to release affected calls and erase all
affected references and to put all circuits into the idle state;
\- Upon receipt of a RESET message from the MSC a BSS that does not allocate
the circuits send block messages (BLOCK or CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCK) for all
circuits that were previously locally blocked on the BSS side;
Since the SNSF will not pass the RESET message to the BSC (at least when part
of the MSC Servers only are resetting), the BSC will not release the affected
calls and circuits, and will not initiate any BLOCK or CIRCUIT GROUP BLOCK
procedures for circuits locally blocked on the BSS side.
As a consequence, the BSS may not be able to use the terrestrial resource that
the reset MSC Server indicates for subsequent call establishments or
handovers:
\- If the MSC indicates a circuit not yet released, the BSC will return an
ASSIGNMENT FAILURE or HANDOVER FAILURE message with the cause set to
\"terrestrial resource already allocated\";
\- If the MSC indicates a circuit locally blocked on the BSS side, the BSC
will return an ASSIGNMENT FAILURE or HANDOVER FAILURE message with the cause
\"requested terrestrial resource unavailable\" and send a single global BLOCK
message for that concerned terrestrial circuit.
The MSC may initiate a new assignment procedure using a new terrestrial
resource.
NOTE: Without an isolation period, the MSC Server may allocate to new calls an
AoIP Call Identifier not yet freed in the BSC for earlier calls. This is not a
concern if the BSC accepts the new call and releases the old call in that
circumstances.
##### 5.6.3.2.1.2.2 Alternative -2: Mapping RESET to RESET Circuit
{#alternative--2-mapping-reset-to-reset-circuit .H6}
When a Reset message from an MSC-S is received in the SNSF (which forwards to
BSC), this indicates to the BSC that all circuits controlled by that MSC-S
have to be reset. However, since all the circuits from the BSC are distributed
among the MSC-S\'s in the pool, the sending of a Reset message to the BSC
would cause reset of calls to the other MSC-S\'s.
A Reset message received from an MSC-S is mapped to dedicated Reset Circuit
messages towards the BSC\'s, see Figure 5.6.3.2.1.2.2.1 below.
However the Reset Circuit releases all the sessions which have TDM circuit
connected.
The SNSF has supervision timers in order to supervise the responses from the
BSC and the MSC-S, these are required for a fault tolerant implementation.
Figure 5.6.3.2.1.2.2.1:: RESET procedure initiated from part of the MSC
Servers-Alt 2
NOTE: This solution applies to single SNSF scenario.
##### 5.6.3.2.2 Overload
The procedure is similar to the procedure specified in clause 5.6.3.1.2, with
the \"BSC\" replacing the \"RNC\".
##### 5.6.3.2.3 Reset IP Resource
The procedure is similar to the procedure specified in clause 5.6.3.1.3.1,
with the \"AoIP Call Identifier\" replacing the \"Iu Signalling Connection
Id\" and the BSSAP \"RESET IP RESOURCE\" message replacing the RANAP \"RESET
RESOURCE\" message.
Since the AoIP Call Identifiers are always allocated by the MSC, the SNSF may
distribute the RESET IP RESOURCE messages only to the right MSC Servers.
##### 5.6.3.2.4 Paging
Same as Paging procedure for RANAP (See clause 5.6.3.1.8).
##### 5.6.3.2.5 Resource Request
Figure 5.6.3.2.5.1: Resource Request Procedure
The RESOURCE REQUEST message is sent from the MSC to the BSS and requests the
current spare and optionally the total accessible resource on a particular
cell. On receipt of the RESOURCE REQUEST message, the SNSF node transfers this
message to the destination BSC.
The RESOURCE INDICATION message is sent from the BSS to the MSC in response to
a resource request message, the message includes an explicit indication of the
cell concerned. On receipt of the RESOURCE INDICATION message, the SNSF node
broadcast the message to all the MSC Servers. The MSC Servers which do not
sent RESOURCE REQUEST message should ignore RESOURCE INDICATION message. The
MSC Servers shall ignore the message if no corresponding pending RESOURCE
REQUEST procedures are matched locally.
##### 5.6.3.2.6 Handover Candidate Enquire
Figure 5.6.3.2.6.1: Handover Candidate Enquire Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to allow the MSC Server to ascertain if it is
possible to handover any MSs that are currently being served by a particular
cell to another nominated cell.
The MSC Server sends a HANDOVER CANDIDATE ENQUIRE message towards a BSS. On
receipt of the HANDOVER CANDIDATE ENQUIRE message, the SNSF node transfers
this message to the destination BSC.
On receipt of the HANDOVER CANDIDATE RESPONSE message, the SNSF node
broadcasts the response message to all the MSC Servers. Only the MSC Server
that sends the HANDOVER CANDIDATE ENQUIRE message will handle the response
message. The other MSC Servers in the Pool Area shall ignore the response
message per procedures specified in TS 48.008 [5].
##### 5.6.3.2.7 Confusion
This message is sent in either direction in response to a message which cannot
be treated correctly for some reason, and for which another failure message
cannot substitute. The use of this message may be under operator control.
##### 5.6.3.2.7.1 Confusion from the BSS {#confusion-from-the-bss .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.2.7.1.1: Confusion procedure, BSC originated
The CONFUSION message is sent from the BSC to the MSC Server. On receipt of
the BSC CONFUSION message, the SNSF node broadcasts this message to all the
MSC Servers.
##### 5.6.3.2.7.2 Confusion from the CN {#confusion-from-the-cn .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.2.7.2.1: Confusion procedure, CN originated
The CONFUSION message is sent from the MSC to the BSC. On receipt of the MSC
Server initiated CONFUSION message, the SNSF node transfers the message to the
destination BSC.
##### 5.6.3.2.8 Load Indication
The purpose of the load indication procedure is to inform all neighbour BSS\'s
about the traffic situation of a cell.
The philosophy is to control the incoming handover traffic at the source, i.e.
the BSS of the concerned cell informs all its neighbour BSSs about the load
situation. This is achieved by sending a LOAD INDICATION message to the
neighbour BSSs. On receipt of the LOAD INDICATION message the BSS may analyse
the load information and take the traffic load into consideration when
deciding a handover.
The algorithm in which the BSS decides on starting a Load Indication procedure
is operator dependent.
The implementation of the Load Indication procedure shall be regarded as
optional, that means, if this procedure is not used, the Load Indication
message may be ignored by these network elements.
##### 5.6.3.2.8.1 BSS Initiated Load Indication {#bss-initiated-load-
indication .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.2.8.1.1: Load Indication procedure, BSC originated
The LOAD INDICATION message is sent from the BSS to the MSC Server. It
indicates to the receiving entity that the transmitting BSS has detected a
load situation in the concerned cell. On receipt of the BSC LOAD INDICATION
message, the SNSF node broadcasts this message to all the MSC.
##### 5.6.3.2.8.2 CN Initiated Load Indication {#cn-initiated-load-indication
.H6}
Figure 5.6.3.2.8.2.1: Load Indication procedure, MSC originated
The LOAD INDICATION message is sent from the MSC Server to the BSC. It
indicates to the receiving entity that the transmitting MSS has detected a
load situation in the concerned cell. On receipt of the MSC LOAD INDICATION
message, the SNSF node transfers this message to the destination BSC node.

initiated-connectionless-information-transfer .H6}
Figure 5.6.3.2.9.1.1: Connectionless Information sent from the BSC
On receipt of the CONNECTIONLESS INFORMATION message from the BSC, the SNSF
node transfers this message to any one of the MSC Servers in the Pool Area.

Figure 5.6.3.2.9.2.1: CN Initiated Connectionless Information
On receipt of the CONNECTIONLESS INFORMATION message from the MSC Server, the
SNSF node transfers this message to the destination BSC.
##### 5.6.3.2.10 TDM Circuit Management
This clause describes message handling procedures at the SNSF for uplink TDM
circuit management-related messages. Two alternatives have been captured as
summarized below with the corresponding pros and cons:
\- Message distribution based on **circuit mapping data** : in this method,
the SNSF determines the destination MSC Server(s) on the basis of the
combination of the identity (code) of the affected circuit(s) and the network
address of the sending BSC. A configured mapping between this information and
the network address of the destination MSC Server(s) is assumed to exist in
the SNSF.
\- **Pros** : The circuit mapping data method permits precise identification
of the destination MSC Server(s), yet requires the configuration of mapping
data in the SNSF.
\- **Cons** : If much data configuration is required on the SNSF node together
with the MSC Server, any change on the configuration will be very complicated.
\- Message distribution based on **broadcast mechanism** : in this method, the
SNSF sends the message to each MSC Server in the MSC Pool.
\- **Pros** : This alternative requires no configured data in the SNSF or data
synchronization between MSC Servers and SNSF nodes, yet its use results in the
sending of messages to MSC Servers that do not manage the indicated
circuit(s).
\- **Cons** : MSC Server may receive TDM circuit management messages to
operator circuits which are not locally configured and it is required to
discard these messages in these cases.
The use of the alternatives is implementation specific and there is no
recommendation in the present document.
##### 5.6.3.2.10.1 Message Distribution Based on Circuit Mapping Data
{#message-distribution-based-on-circuit-mapping-data .H6}
Optionally, the SNSF may have the configuration data of the mapping from the
circuit identity (e.g. Circuit Identity Code and the Signalling Point Code of
the BSC) to the MSS node. On receipt of the circuit management messages from
the BSC node, the SNSF handle the message as per the message type listed
below:
\- On receipt of the BSC initiated (Un)Block or Reset Circuit message, the
SNSF determines the MSS node as per the Circuit Identity Code extracted from
the received message and the Source Signalling Point Code, and distributes the
message to the MSS node. On receipt the (Un)Blocking Acknowledgement or Reset
Circuit Acknowledge message, the SNSF relays the message to the BSC as per the
destination Signalling Point Code.
\- On receipt of the MSS initiated (Un)Block or Reset Circuit message, the
SNSF relays the messages towards the BSC as per the destination Signalling
Point Code. When received the (Un)Block Acknowledgement or Reset Circuit
Acknowledge message, the SNSF determines the MSS node as per the Circuit
Identity Code extracted from the received message and the Source Signalling
Point Code, and distributes the message to the MSS node.
\- On receipt of the BSC initiated Circuit Group (Un)Block message, the SNSF
extracts the sub-set of circuits configured for each MSS node and specified in
the received message, relays the message with this sub-set circuits towards
the MSS node. The MSSs shall (Un)Block the circuits locally configured and
return a Circuit Group (Un)Block message by setting the Status Bits with the
value of \"1\" (_(un)blocking acknowledgement_) for the (Un)Blocked circuits.
The SNSF will receive multiple Circuit Group (Un)Blocking Acknowledgement
messages (one from each MSS node) and the SNSF shall aggregate the Status Bits
of this IE with value of \"1\" ((un)blocking acknowledgement) and send the
message with the aggregated Status Bits of the Circuit Identity Code List IE
to the BSC node. Figure 5.6.3.2.10.1.1 illustrates the procedures for BSC
initiated Circuit Group Block messages to block circuits configured to MSS1
and MSS2.
NOTE 1: As specified in TS 48.008 [5], \"_The CIRCUIT GROUP UNBLOCKING
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message is accepted as the appropriate acknowledgement only if
the indicated Circuit Identity Code and the returned Range field of the
Circuit Identity Code List match the corresponding parameter values of the
respective initiating message. Otherwise the message is considered as not
expected._ \" The MSC Server shall return the acknowledgement messages
responding to the Circuit Group (Un)Block message with the same Circuit
Identity Code and the same Range Field of the Circuit Identity Code List IE.
Figure 5.6.3.2.10.1.1: Uplink TDM Circuit Management Message Handling at the
SNSF\ (SNSF distributes the messages as per circuit identity)
\- On receipt of the MSS initiated Circuit Group (Un)Block message, the SNSF
relays the messages towards the BSC as per the destination Signalling Point
Code. When received the Circuit Group (Un)Blocking Acknowledgement message
(all the circuits will map to the same MSS node), the SNSF distributes the
message received from the BSC node to the MSS node as per the Circuit Identity
Code extracted from the received message and the Source Signalling Point Code.
\- For the BSC initiated Unequipped Circuit message, the SNSF extracts the
sub-set of circuits configured for each MSS node and specified in the received
message, relays the message with this sub-set circuits towards the MSS nodes.
NOTE 2: If MSS connects to multiple SNSF nodes, the MSS shall only return the
acknowledgement messages towards the SNSF node which the corresponding Reset
Circuit, (Un)Block, and Circuit Group (Un)Block received from.
##### 5.6.3.2.10.2 Message Distribution Based on Broadcast Mechanism
{#message-distribution-based-on-broadcast-mechanism .H6}
Alternatively, The SNSF may distribute the uplink message towards to each MSS
node. In this approach, the SNSF will no need keep any data related to the
mapping from the Circuit Identity to the MSS node. On receipt of the circuit
management messages from the BSC node, the SNSF handle the message as per the
message type listed below:
\- On receipt of the BSC initiated (Un)Block or Reset Circuit message, the
SNSF relay a copy of the message to each MSS node. The MSS shall only handle
the message if the circuit is configured locally. On receipt the (Un)Blocking
Acknowledgement or Reset Circuit Acknowledge message, the SNSF relays the
message to the BSC as per the destination Signalling Point Code. To avoid
unnecessary UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT messages from the MSC Servers, the MSC Servers
shall ignore the (Un)Block or Reset Circuit message that the circuit indicated
in the message is not configured locally and shall not send an UNEQUIPPED
CIRCUIT message in these cases.- On receipt of the MSS initiated (Un)Block or
Reset Circuit message, the SNSF relays the messages towards the BSC as per the
destination Signalling Point Code. When received the (Un)Block Acknowledgement
or Reset Circuit Acknowledge message from the BSC, the SNSF relay a copy of
the message to each MSS node. The MSS shall ignore the message if the circuits
is not configured locally.
\- On receipt of the BSC initiated Circuit Group (Un)Block message, relay a
copy of the message to each MSS node. The MSS shall ignore the circuits
specified in the message but not configured locally, (Un)Block the circuits
locally configured and return a Circuit Group (Un)Block message by setting the
Status Bits with the value of \"1\" (_(un)blocking acknowledgement_) for the
(Un)Blocked circuits and with the value of \"0\" (_no indication_) for the
others. The SNSF will receive multiple Circuit Group (Un)Blocking
Acknowledgement messages and all the messages shall have the same content with
the exception of the Circuit Identity Code List IE. The SNSF shall aggregate
the Status Bits of this IE with value of \"1\" ((un)blocking acknowledgement)
and send the message with the aggregated Status Bits of the Circuit Identity
Code List IE to the BSC node. Figure 5.6.3.2.10.2.1 illustrates the procedures
for BSC initiated Circuit Group Block messages to block circuits configured to
MSS1 and MSS2. To avoid unnecessary UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT messages from the MSC
Servers, the MSC Servers shall not send UNEQUIPPED CIRCUIT messages for the
circuits indicated in the Circuit Group (Un)Block message but not locally
configured.
NOTE 1: As specified in TS 48.008 [5], \"_The CIRCUIT GROUP UNBLOCKING
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message is accepted as the appropriate acknowledgement only if
the indicated Circuit Identity Code and the returned Range field of the
Circuit Identity Code List match the corresponding parameter values of the
respective initiating message. Otherwise the message is considered as not
expected._ \" The MSC Server shall return the acknowledgement messages
responding to the Circuit Group (Un)Block message with the same Circuit
Identity Code and the same Range Field of the Circuit Identity Code List IE.
Figure 5.6.3.2.10.2.1: Uplink TDM Circuit Management Message Handling at the
SNSF\ (SNSF Relay the Message to each MSS node a copy)
\- On receipt of the MSS initiated Circuit Group (Un)Block message, the SNSF
relays the messages towards the BSC as per the destination Signalling Point
Code. When received the Circuit Group (Un)Blocking Acknowledgement message,
the SNSF relay a copy of the message to each MSS node. The MSS shall ignore
the message if the circuits specified in the message are not configured
locally.
\- For the BSC initiated Unequipped Circuit message, the SNSF relays a copy of
the message to each MSS node.
NOTE 2: If MSS connects to multiple SNSF nodes, the MSS shall only return the
acknowledgement messages towards the SNSF node which the corresponding Reset
Circuit, (Un)Block, and Circuit Group (Un)Block received from.
# 6 Interaction with other features
## 6.1 Interaction with Network Sharing
Network sharing is a way for operators to share the heavy deployment costs for
mobile networks, especially in the roll-out phase. Multi-Operator Core Network
(MOCN) is a network-sharing configuration in which only the RAN is shared and
Gateway Core Network (GWCN) is a network sharing configuration that parts of
the core network (MSC Servers or SGSN nodes) are also shared (see TS 23.251
[4]).
### 6.1.1 Interaction with MOCN
#### 6.1.1.1 General
For MOCN network sharing, parts of RAN network are shared.
In a MOCN configuration without deploying the SNSF node above the RNC node,
the RAN node routes the UE\'s initial access to the shared network to one of
the available CN nodes which directly connected with the RAN node as per the
PLMN-id and routes subsequent messages to the selected CN nodes as per the NRI
parameters extracted from the (P‑)TMSI.
Figure 6.1.1.1.1: Network configurations for only MOCN is deployed
In an MOCN configuration with deploying the SNSF node above the RNC node, the
RAN node may be fully configured to select and route the UE\'s initial access
and subsequent messages to an available CN node directly, or the RAN node may
be only configured to select and route the UE\'s initial access and subsequent
messages to the SNSF node deployed above the RAN nodes and the SNSF node
select and route the UE\'s initial access and subsequent messages to an
available CN node as depicted in the following clauses.
#### 6.1.1.2 RAN selects and distributes messages to CN nodes directly
In an MOCN configuration without deploying the SNSF node above the RNC node,
the RAN node may be fully configured to select and route the UE\'s initial
access and subsequent messages to an available CN node directly. As no SNSF
node is deployed above the RAN nodes, no interaction is detected in this
scenario.
#### 6.1.1.3 SNSF node select and distribute messages to CN nodes
In a MOCN configuration with deploying the SNSF node above the RNC node, the
RAN node may be only configured to select and route the UE\'s initial access
and subsequent messages to the SNSF node deployed above the RAN nodes and the
SNSF node select, determine and route the UE\'s initial access and subsequent
messages to an available CN node as specified in clause 5.6 and illustrated in
figure 6.1.1.3.1.
Figure 6.1.1.3.1: Network configurations for MOCN with MSC Pool
### 6.1.2 Interaction with GWCN
For GWCN network sharing, parts of the core network (MSC Servers or SGSN
nodes) are also shared.
In a GWCN configuration without deploying the SNSF node above the RNC node,
the RAN node routes the UE\'s initial access to the shared network to the
directly connected CN node.
In a GWCN configuration with deploying the SNSF node above the RNC node, the
RAN node routes the UE\'s initial access to the SNSF node shared between
operators and the SNSF node select, determine and distribute the messages to a
correct CN node as specified in clause 5.6 and illustrated in figure 6.1.2.1.
The network configurations of only GWCN and GWCN with MSC Pool are shown in
figure 6.1.2.1.
Figure 6.1.2-1a: Only GWCN is configured
Figure 6.1.2-1b: Both GWCN and MSC Pool are configured
Figure 6.1.2.1: Network configurations for only GWCN and GWCN with MSC Pool
### 6.1.3 Conclusion
Deploying the SNSF node above the BSC/RNC node works well with the deploying
of Network Sharing (MOCN or GWCN) feature and no impact on Network Sharing.
## 6.2 Interaction with A interface over IP
For the use of A interface control plane over IP with A interface user plane
either over TDM or over IP, the A interface signalling is transported over
SIGTRAN. With this configuration, the only consideration for the deployment of
the SNSF nodes is related to SNSF node redundancy and failover. The procedures
for such are described in clause 4.9.1.2.
# 7 Compatibility Issues
## 7.1 Co-existence of NNSF within BSC/RNC nodes with SNSF above BSC/RNC nodes
Using the NNSF within the BSC/RNC nodes has already been defined in TS 23.236
[2]. Deploying SNSF above the BSC/RNC nodes will co-exist with using the NNSF
within the BSC/RNC nodes as described below.
Figure 7.1.1: Co-existence of NNSF within BSC/RNC nodes with SNSF above
BSC/RNC nodes
As shown in Figure 7.1.1, if part of the BSC/RNC nodes are capable of
supporting the NNSF function as described in TS 23.236 [2] (RAN node 4\~5)
while the others are not (RAN node 1\~3), the NNSF capable BSC/RNC nodes
assign an MSC Server to serve a mobile station and subsequently route the
signalling traffic to the assigned MSC Server whereas non-NNSF capable BSC/RNC
nodes connect to SNSF node and the SNSF node is responsible for assigning an
MSC Server to serve a mobile station and subsequently routing the signalling
traffic to the assigned MSC Server.
In this situation, the MSC Server interacts with the SNSF node as described in
clause 5 of the present document (e.g., allocate the SCCP local reference with
SNRI as described in clause 5.6.2.2 if the SCCP Local Reference Based Handling
of connection-oriented messages is used), and interacts with BSC/RNC nodes as
specified in TS 23.236 [2].
# 8 Evaluation
The technical study verifies that it is feasible to support NNSF functionality
above the RAN nodes. This has been studied for the circuit switched core
network; the need for support of such function for the packet switched core
network was removed during the execution of this study. The value of the SNSF
function is based on not impacting \'old\' RAN nodes. This also means that
SNSF does not impact the existing A and Iu interfaces between the radio
network and the CS core network.
This study has shown that the gain of independence from the RAN nodes
requires:
\- Either new standalone SNSF nodes must be introduced into the core network
or the SNSF functionality must be collocated with already existing nodes, for
example with the MGW. The latter may impact the capacity of the existing node
due to the fact that functionality is added.
\- It requires more signalling compared to when the NNSF functionality is
applied in the RAN nodes, because connection to the SNSF function is forced,
which are acting as proxies.
\- If the SNSF functionality shall not be a single point of failure then
additional complexity is required to realise redundancy mechanisms, including
impacts on the MSC Server as well.
In many cases the SNSF functionality is an SNSF internal handling. For this
internal handling it is possible to reuse what has been specified for NNSF in
TS 23.236 [2], e.g. load balancing and load re-distribution. Other
functionality does not impact SNSF at all, for example combined mobility
management procedures. The only identified functionality which can\'t be
inherited by existing specifications is the support for redundancy. A
potential redundant solution is described in clause 5.6.2.2 of this TR. As
vendors had to already cope with these situations early in the operational
environment, vendor specific solutions already exist without impacting
standards or existing NNSF functions.
In addition to the above analysis there are also other facts to be considered:
1\. Vendors have already provided products to provide SNSF functionality
collocated within MGWs by different means. They may come into conflict with a
future normative specification.
2\. As far as known, currently those MGWs interfacing the radio network and
the MSC Servers are deployed by the same vendor. For these deployment
scenarios there is no need for IOT testing.
3\. MGW redundancy is also based on vendor specific implementations and is not
specified by 3GPP. Specifying SNSF functionality may result into conflicts
with already deployed MGW redundancy.
For the reasons listed above, the present TR concludes without a
recommendation for normative specification of SNSF functionality.
# 9 Conclusions
Through the preceding technical investigation within this technical report, it
is concluded that it is feasible to deploy SNSF nodes above the BSC/RNC nodes
to provide functions similar to those of the NNSF in BSC/RNC nodes as
specified in TS 23.236 [2]. The solution described in this TR is one of the
possible solutions to resolve the implementation issues of deploying NNSF
within the BSC/RNC nodes for MSC Pool.
The solutions described in this study may be used as guideline for
implementations in cases where operator does not upgrade the radio networks.
