# 1 Scope
This document specifies the architectural requirements for delivery of
consistent services to the user regardless of the attached access type (e.g.
CS domain access, or IP-CAN). This is achieved by implementing the services in
the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS).
Consideration is given to how to access specified IMS-based services (see
clause 22.4 of TS 22.101 [9]) whilst still allowing other, bespoke services to
be offered by the home operator.
IMS control of services related to those defined in clause 22.4 of TS 22.101
[9] are part of the present scope of this specification.
The scope of the specification includes:
\- Session establishment when using CS access for media transmission for an
IMS service.
**\- Support of** Service Continuity as **specified in TS 23.237 [12].**
\- Support of Single Radio Voice Call Continuity as specified in TS 23.216
[36].
\- Access Domain Selection (ADS).
\- IMS control of services where the media is transported via the CS network
(e.g. managing of mid-call services).
\- Service data management.
The solution is applicable for UEs with or without ICS functionality, and is
applicable for the following deployment scenarios:
\- An operator who supports for their subscribers only UEs that have ICS
functionality.
\- An operator who supports for their subscribers only UEs that do not have
ICS functionality.
\- An operator who supports for their subscribers UEs which do and do not have
ICS functionality (to different subscribers and the same subscribers) ensuring
the coexistence of UEs that have and do not have ICS functionality.
\- Inbound roaming subscribers on an operator\'s network that supports either
the same or different ICS functionality that the inbound roaming subscriber is
using, ensuring the coexistence of UEs that have and do not have ICS
functionality.

# 4 High level principles and requirements
## 4.1 General
IMS Centralized Services (ICS) provides **communication services such that all
services, and service control, are only based on IMS mechanisms and enablers.
It enables IMS services when using CS access (e.g. TS 24.008 [6], 3GPP2
C.S0001-D [27]) for the media bearer**.
With ICS, the user services are provided by IMS only. User sessions are
controlled in IMS via PS or CS access and can be any of those defined in
clause 22.4 of TS 22.101 [9].
When using a CS access network, or when using a PS access network that does
not support the full duplex speech/video component of an IMS-based service,
the CS core network is utilized to establish a circuit bearer for use as media
for IMS sessions. The transmission of both bidirectional and unidirectional
real-time video media flows shall be supported.
NOTE: The establishment of unidirectional real-time video media flow for
originating sessions requires the ICS UE capabilities.
If the PS access network does support the full duplex speech component of an
IMS service then existing IMS session procedures are used as specified in TS
23.228 [2].
**ICS provides mechanisms to support the use of CS media bearer for IMS
sessions. With ICS,** IMS sessions using CS media are treated as standard IMS
sessions for the purpose of service control and service continuity.
ICS defines signalling mechanisms between the UE and IMS for transport of
information required for service continuity when using CS access for media
transport.
## 4.2 Service consistency
IMS services as defined in clause 22.4 of TS 22.101 [9] shall be consistently
provided when using a CS or a PS access network for the media of the IMS
service subject to the capability of the UE and the access network.
## 4.3 Service continuity
Service continuity shall be provided when underlying mobility results in a
change of access network capabilities, e.g. support of Gm reference point in
conjunction with CS bearer may not be possible after handover from UTRAN to
GERAN.
## 4.4 Session scenarios
### 4.4.1 Overview
### 4.4.2 ICS UE Session Scenarios
When a user accesses IMS services over a CS network, or a PS network which
does not support the full duplex speech or video media flow component of an
IMS service, the following IMS session scenarios shall be supported according
to the procedures specified in TS 23.228 [2], along with the solution
specified in this document.
\- Basic voice or voice and video service origination and terminating
sessions.
\- Voice or voice and video origination and termination service sessions with
Line ID services (e.g. OIP, OIR, TIP, TIR) controlled in IMS.
\- Voice or voice and video origination and termination service sessions with
Communication Barring services controlled in IMS.
\- Voice or voice and video termination service sessions with Communication
Diversion services controlled in IMS.
\- Voice or voice and video origination and termination service sessions with
mid-call services (e.g. Hold/Resume, Conferencing, CW, ECT) controlled in IMS.
\- Communication services setting modifications (e.g., changing forwarding
info or activating barring services, etc).
\- The solution shall provide for an ICS UE, generic capabilities to enable
introduction of new IMS services utilizing CS bearers without further
standardisation.
\- Adding/removing real time video media flow over CS access to/from an IMS
session (see TS 22.173 [4]).
## 4.5 Service settings data management
An ICS UE supporting multimedia telephony shall manage the IMS multimedia
telephony communication service settings data as specified in TS 24.173 [8].
For a UE not supporting multimedia telephony, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS
may implement a communication service setting conversion function between CS
signalling (e.g., as described in TS 24.010 [30]) and communication service
setting procedures (e.g. as defined in TS 24.173 [8]); see also clause
7.6.2.9.
NOTE: A downloadable application can enable a UE not supporting multimedia
telephony to perform service data management.
For a UE not supporting multimedia telephony, if the MSC Server enhanced for
ICS does not implement a communication service setting conversion function or
if the UE is connected to an MSC server not enhanced for ICS, refer to clause
7.6.3.7.1.
Mechanisms that allow data to be synchronized between the HSS and the TAS when
legacy CS signalling is used towards the HSS for service settings data
management are not specified.
## 4.6 Identities
### 4.6.1 Identities used by an ICS UE
Identities for the ICS UE are handled according to clause 4.3.3 of TS 23.228
[2].
### 4.6.2 Identities used by an MSC Server enhanced for ICS
For registration to IMS, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall use only a
Private User Identity and Public User Identity specifically reserved for IMS
registrations from an MSC Server. For systems with a CS domain access based on
TS 24.008 [6], the subscriber identity used shall be as defined in clause 20.3
of TS 23.003 [5].
NOTE 1: This is to avoid conflicts in IMS registration by a UE and an MSC
Server enhanced for ICS registering on behalf of the same subscriber.
Similar to the temporary Public User Identity (see clause 13.4 of TS 23.003
[5]), the ICS specific Public User Identity shall be prohibited from being
used to originate sessions and shall be prohibited from being used to identify
a terminating subscriber for incoming sessions.
An MSC Server shall use only those Public User Identities representing E.164
numbers from the subscriber\'s IMS profile to originate and terminate calls.
NOTE 2: The subscriber\'s IMS profile will need to be provisioned with a Tel
URI, either as the default Public User Identity or associated with it,
equivalent to a DN (e.g. MSISDN) in the subscriber\'s CS profile associated
with speech/audio (e.g. TS11).
## 4.7 Coexistence of an ICS UE and a non ICS UE
It shall be possible to provide ICS for an ICS UE and a non ICS UE in home and
in visited networks.
Home and visited networks with an MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall support
call originations and terminations for ICS UEs and non ICS UEs.
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS avoids conflicts with other IMS registrations
(which includes that used by an ICS UE) by using a Private User Identity and
Public User Identity specifically reserved for use by MSC Server
registrations. See clause 4.6.2 for more information. An IMS operator who
provides services for its subscribers, using both ICS UE\'s and MSC Servers
enhanced for ICS needs to make the following provisions in order to avoid
registration conflicts:
\- Configure the ICS specific Private User Identity, as defined in clause
4.6.2 to point to the subscriber\'s implicit registration set; and
\- Add the ICS specific Public User Identity, as defined in clause 4.6.2 to
the subscriber\'s implicit registration set.
## 4.8 Routing of originated calls to IMS
When the ICS UE establishes the Service Control Signalling Path over I1 or Gm
prior to the establishment of the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path, the ICS
UE shall use the routing number provided by the network in response to service
control signalling as the B-Party number for establishing the CS Bearer
Control Signalling Path.
## 4.9 Void
# 5 Architecture model and reference points
## 5.1 Overview
ICS enables IMS services when using CS access for media transport. Users are
provided with a consistent experience of services.
When using PS access networks which support the full duplex speech media
component of an IMS service, procedures defined in TS 23.228 [2] are used to
provide IMS services.
For other access networks, media established via the CS domain is used in
conjunction with IMS service control. When using a UE that has been enhanced
for ICS, IMS service control is enabled by a transparent control channel (the
Service Control Signalling Path) between the UE and IMS. When using a UE which
has not been enhanced for ICS, IMS service control can be enabled by an MSC
Server enhanced for ICS.
For systems with a CS domain access based on TS 24.008 [6], CAMEL shall be
used for implementing the IN triggers.
## 5.2 Reference architecture
Figure 5.2-1 provides the reference architecture for IMS sessions established
using CS bearers.
Figure 5.2-1: IMS Service Centralization and Continuity Reference Architecture
The architecture introduces the following:
\- The SCC AS, which provides functions specific to IMS Service Centralization
and Continuity.
\- Enhancements to the MSC Server for ICS.
\- Enhancements to the UE for ICS
\- Enhancements to the MSC Server for ICS to interwork with IMS emergency
architecture as defined in TS 23.167 [25]
Not all of the above are required in a network implementing ICS.
## 5.3 Functional Entities
### 5.3.1 SCC AS
The SCC AS is a home network based IMS Application that provides functionality
required to enable IMS Centralized Services. The SCC AS is inserted in the
session path using originating and terminating iFCs; it is configured as the
first AS in the originating iFC and as the last AS in the terminating iFC
chain. The SCC AS may also be invoked through the use of PSI termination
procedures when using CS access.
The SCC AS implements one or more of the following functionalities:
**\- ICS User Agent (IUA):** The ICS User Agent (IUA) function provides SIP UA
behaviour on behalf of the UE for setup and control of IMS sessions using CS
bearers that are established with or without the use of Gm or I1 between the
UE and the SCC AS. For sessions established using Gm or I1 between the ICS UE
and the SCC AS the IUA combines the service control signalling with the
description of the bearer, e.g. SDP, established via the CS access to present
a standard IMS session on behalf of the UE. An SCC AS may support I1 reference
point. If supporting the I1 reference point, and before initiating an I1
Service Control Signalling Path flow, the SCC AS shall ensure that the ICS UE
supports I1 and the PLMN the UE is in supports transport of network initiated
I1 signalling.
**\- CS Access Adaptation (CAA):** The CS Access Adaptation (CAA) is an
adaptation function for the service control signalling communicated
transparently via the CS domain between the UE and the SCC AS. The CAA
processes the service control signalling received via the CS access for
interworking with other IMS functional elements. The CAA is only used when
using the CS network for communication of service control signalling.
\- **Terminating Access Domain Selection (T-ADS): Terminating Access Domain
Selection (T-ADS) provides:**
\- Directs an incoming session to an ICS User;
\- For one or more UEs of an ICS User:
\- Influences the selection of one or more contacts amongst the registered
contacts and;
\- Influences the selection of an access network for delivery of the incoming
session to the selected contact, or;
\- Performs breakout to the CS Domain by fetching the CSRN.
T-ADS shall take into account the access network\'s capabilities, UE
capabilities, IMS registration status, CS status, existing active sessions,
user preferences, UE 3GPP PS Data Off status (active/inactive), 3GPP PS Data
Off Exempted Service configuration setting, operator policies such as access
network specific voice domain preferences and the media component types, and
whether there is an ongoing IMS voice over PS session. In addition, T-ADS may
take into account the access network information provided directly by the UE.
The UE may assist the T-ADS. The UE assisted T-ADS (UE T-ADS), based on
configuration that takes into account operator policy, user preferences and
local access network capabilities, performs the following:
\- Detect media that is candidate for delivery over the CS domain associated
with an incoming session.
\- Identify the domain in which the session is to be established (CS or PS).
\- Determines the mechanism to complete the establishment (origination or
termination) - applicable to sessions to be established in the CS domain only.
\- Notifies the SCC AS of the mechanism the establishment will be completed on
- if possible.
For delivery of an incoming session to non ICS UE, the SCC AS may deliver the
session in other domain if call delivery in the originally selected domain
fails, e.g. delivers the call in CS domain when session establishment in the
PS domain does not succeed.
For delivery of an incoming session to an ICS User, the T-ADS shall perform
the following:
1\. Assists in delivery of an incoming session, whether to:
\- Deliver all media via PS.
\- Deliver speech media via CS and use Gm for service control.
\- Deliver speech media via CS and use I1 for service control.
\- Deliver speech media via MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
\- Deliver speech media via MSC Server not enhanced for ICS.
2\. It assists in selection of an access network for delivery of the incoming
session to the ICS User contact address(es). Selection criteria as specified
in TS 23.221 [10] clause 7.2b, Access Domain Selection for terminating
sessions are used for access network selection.
For incoming sessions with bi-directional speech media destined to a selected
contact:
\- For 3GPP access, the SCC AS shall retrieve from the serving PLMN via the
HSS (+UDM in case of 5GC as specified in TS 23.501 [55]) the most recent
access network capabilities (\"IMS voice over PS Session Supported
Indication\", current RAT type) unless there is, for the same UE, an existing
IMS voice over PS session or an existing speech session using the CS bearer
that is not using the Gm service control signalling path.
\- For networks which support WLAN access, and if WLAN access is allowed to
support IMS voice based on operator policy, the SCC AS shall additionally take
the time of the most recent IMS 3rd party registration or re-registration via
WLAN access into account.
If the most recent access network capabilities can be retrieved, then:
\- If the most recently used PS access network (including WLAN access)
indicates that IMS voice over PS is supported then bi-directional speech media
can be delivered on this access.
\- If the most recently used PS access network indicates that IMS voice over
PS is not supported, then bi-directional speech media shall not be delivered
on this access.
\- If the current RAT type indicates that simultaneous transfer on PS and CS
domains is supported, then speech media can be delivered via CS and Gm can be
used for service control.
\- If the current RAT type indicates that simultaneous transfer on PS and CS
domains is not supported, then Gm shall not be used for service control.
If there is an existing speech session using the CS bearer that is not using
the Gm service control signalling path then Gm shall not be used for service
control.
3\. For delivery of incoming sessions to the UE registered in CS domain via
standard MSC Server, it fetches the CSRN for breakout to the CS domain.
If a UE has an ongoing IMS voice over PS session, the T-ADS shall select the
PS domain when delivering an incoming session to the same UE.
When using Gm reference point, T-ADS for ICS UE sessions may be executed in
the ICS UE in conjunction with the network, based on user preferences,
operator policy and taking into account its own capabilities and those of the
access network.
### 5.3.2 UE enhanced for ICS
The ICS UE is an IMS UE that has additional ICS-related capability, which
includes the following functions:
\- Communication with the SCC AS for service control signalling.
\- Establishment of the Bearer Control Signalling Path to setup the media
through the CS domain.
\- Execution of ADS for originating sessions as specified in TS 23.221 [10]
clause 7.2a.
\- Assisting the SCC AS in the execution of T-ADS when Gm is used.
The ICS UE supports the Gm reference point (as defined in TS 23.228 [2]) and
shall use the Gm reference point when using the PS network for service control
signalling.
NOTE 1: Since an ICS UE is based on an IMS UE, the Gm reference point is
always supported on an ICS UE.
The ICS UE may support the I1 reference point (as defined in clause 5.4.1). If
the ICS UE supports the I1 reference point, it shall be used only when:
\- the home operator has preconfigured it to be used; and
\- use of the Gm reference point is not possible due to the PS network not
being available (e.g. due to the ICS UE camping on a GERAN with no DTM
available).
Otherwise, the Gm reference point or standard CS procedures shall be used.
If the ICS UE supports Gm ICS and has a single call for which CS procedures
are being used and Gm is not being used for service control then it may add
the Gm service control signalling path, as described in clause 7.5a. If the
ICS UE that supports Gm ICS does not add the Gm service control signalling
path then it shall continue to use CS procedures for service control and for
establishing additional calls until all ongoing calls end.
NOTE 2: An ICS UE that supports Gm ICS may have a call for which Gm is not
being used for service control if, for example, a handover has occurred from
an access network that doesn\'t support Gm, or after CSFB, as described in TS
23.272 [44].
### 5.3.3 MSC Server enhancements for ICS
The MSC Server (e.g. as described in TS 23.002 [3]) may be enhanced for the
support of ICS.
In addition to the standard MSC Server behaviour, an MSC Server that has been
enhanced for ICS shall provide the following for an identified ICS user:
\- Processes the user-network signalling received over the CS access (e.g.
A/Iu and E interface) for interworking with IMS SIP and vice versa.
\- Controls the MGW functions described in TS 23.002 [3] to enable the
interworking between CS access and RTP bearers.
\- Performs the interworking to support multimedia call and emergency call in
ICS.
\- May implement a communication service setting conversion function between
CS signalling (e.g. as described in TS 24.010 [30] for systems based on TS
24.008 [6]) and communication service setting procedures (as defined in TS
24.173 [8]).
\- Disregard any supplementary services or IN (e.g. CAMEL) triggers that may
be present in the user profile.
NOTE 1: These can be present in the user profile for the case where the user
is served by an MSC Server not enhanced for ICS.
\- Adds the User Location Information (e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone
Information to IMS signalling.
For subscribers not identified as ICS users and for subscribers identified as
ICS users but using a media type not listed in clause 22.4 of TS 22.101 [9]
and TS 22.173 [4], the MSC Server functionality is unchanged.
In addition to the standard MSC Server behaviour, an MSC Server that has been
enhanced for ICS may support the Combined CS Access Authentication procedure
as specified in Annex G.
NOTE 2: If the Combined CS Access Authentication prodecure is used all users
of this MSC Server shall be authenticated by this procedure only.
If users are authenticated utilizing the Combined CS Access Authentication
procedure, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall verify that 3G CS
authentication parameters that are retrieved from the S-CSCF.
NOTE 3: 3G authentication can be performed also over 2G radio (GERAN).
MSC Server enhancements for ICS are not required for the support of an ICS UE.
### 5.3.4 Emergency CSCF (E-CSCF)
E-CSCF is defined in TS 23.167 [25].
## 5.4 Reference points
### 5.4.1 Reference Point UE -- SCC AS (I1)
The I1 reference point is used between the UE and the SCC AS for service
control signalling over CS access. All I1 Service Control Signalling Path
flows shall be uniquely identifiable from other signalling flows on the same
bearer.
The I1 reference point performs the following functions:
\- optional session set up via CS access for mobile originating and
terminating sessions;
\- optional signalling for additional IMS parameter exchange during session
setup;
\- IMS services control via CS access.
### 5.4.2 Reference Point MSC Server -- CSCF (I2)

# 7 Procedures and flows
## 7.0 General
This clause details the procedures and flows for network based ICS and UE
based ICS.
In the flows that pertain to I1 it is assumed that:
\- both the ICS UE and SCC AS support, and are configured to use I1; and
\- transport of I1 signalling is supported by the MSC Server.
## 7.1 Signalling and bearer paths
### 7.1.1 Sessions established using the Gm or I1 reference point
A Service Control Signalling Path is used to transport service control
signalling between the ICS UE and the SCC AS, for enabling IMS services when
using CS or PS access. The Service Control Signalling Path is used when
needed, e.g. on session establishment and/or service control of IMS sessions
using CS voice bearers.
For ICS UE sessions, the SCC AS combines the service control signalling
received over the Service Control Signalling Path with the description of the
bearer established via the CS network to present an IMS session on behalf of
the UE. The service control signalling elements from Gm / I1 such as A party
address shall be used together with the bearer description signalling received
via CS bearer control signalling path to construct the signalling for the
remote leg.
The Service Control Signalling Path is established via the PS or CS network.
Figure 7.1.1-1 illustrates how signalling and bearer paths established by the
ICS UE are combined at the SCC AS when the Service Control Signalling Path is
established via the PS network using the Gm reference point.
Figure 7.1.1-1: ICS UE session signalling and bearer path using Gm over PS
network for Service Control Signalling Path
Upon session initiation, the ICS UE or the SCC AS establishes the Service
Control Signalling Path for communication of service control signalling via
the PS network using the Gm reference point.
The ICS UE also sets up the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path using standard
CS network procedures to establish the circuit media.
The SCC AS combines the service control signalling received over the Service
Control Signalling Path with the description of the bearer established using
the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path by acting as a B2BUA as below:
\- Access Leg: The Access Leg is formed with a combination of the Service
Control Signalling Path and the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path.
\- Remote Leg: The Remote Leg is presented by the SCC AS to the CSCF as an IMS
session using IMS SIP signalling on behalf of the UE.
The TAS and other Application Servers are executed on the Remote Leg as part
of standard service execution logic at the CSCF.
The SIP UA at the UE maintains the SIP/SDP state machine with the SCC AS also
maintaining a copy of the state data.
Figure 7.1.1-2 illustrates how signalling and bearer paths established by the
UE are combined at the SCC AS when the Service Control Signalling Path is
established via the CS network using the I1 reference point.
Figure 7.1.1-2: ICS UE session signalling and bearer path using I1 over CS
network for Service Control Signalling Path
Upon session initiation, the ICS UE or the SCC AS establishes the Service
Control Signalling Path for communication of service control signalling via
the CS network using the I1 reference point. In parallel, the ICS UE or the
SCC AS sets up the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path using standard CS network
procedures to establish the circuit media. The SCC AS combines the Service
Control Signalling Path with the bearer established using the CS Bearer
Control Signalling Path by acting as a B2BUA as described above for the case
of Service Control Signalling Path established via the PS network.
### 7.1.2 Sessions established using CS call control and MSC Server
Figure 7.1.2-1 illustrates signalling and bearer paths for sessions which are
established using standard CS call control procedures and MSC Server .
Figure 7.1.2-1: Session signalling and bearer path using CS call control
Upon session initiation, the UE or the remote end sets up a call and the call
is directed to IMS using standard CS procedures; IN (e.g. CAMEL) triggers are
used to redirect CS originated calls to IMS. The SCC AS acts a B2BUA for
presentation of the UA behaviour on behalf of the UE to IMS.
The TAS and other Application Servers are executed on the Remote Leg as part
of standard service execution logic at the CSCF.
## 7.2 Registration
### 7.2.1 IMS registration via CS access
#### 7.2.1.1 Overview
If the MSC Server enhanced for ICS implements the Combined CS Access
Authentication procedure as specified in Annex G, the UE accessing the network
via CS domain shall be authenticated and registered by this procedure,
otherwise the following applies.
The UE may register (attach) in the CS domain whenever in CS coverage. The
existing mobility management mechanisms are used in the UE and the CS network.
When performing a successful Location Update for the UE, the MSC Server has
received the subscriber data from the HSS/HLR. This subscriber data may
include an optional flag per VPLMN.
An MSC Server that is enhanced for ICS shall then perform the following:
\- If the flag is received and is supported by the MSC Server, then the MSC
Server shall analyse the value of the flag as follows:
\- If the flag is set to true and optionally if the MSC Server is configured
to know that the VPLMN has a suitable roaming agreement with the HPLMN of the
UE, the MSC Server shall attempt the IMS registration using the I2 reference
point.
\- If the flag is set to false, the MSC Server shall not attempt the IMS
registration.
\- If the flag is not received or is not supported, the MSC Server may perform
some pre-screening (e.g. IMSI range analysis) based on operator-policy in
order to determine whether or not to attempt IMS registration for this
subscriber.
NOTE 1: Exact pre‑screening procedures are operator specific.
NOTE 2: An MSC Server that is not enhanced for ICS will ignore the flag and
thus will continue normal CS operation.
If the MSC Server decides not to perform registration in the IMS, the MSC
Server falls back to the behaviour of an MSC Server that is not enhanced for
ICS.
If the network is in NMO I configuration, the mobility management procedures
using Gs interface triggers the MSC Server enhanced for ICS to perform IMS
registration.
When attempting initial IMS registration on behalf of the ICS User, the MSC
Server shall derive a home IMS domain name using the identity of the
subscriber (e.g. IMSI). This domain name identifies the node (e.g. I‑CSCF or
IBCF) to which the MSC Server shall send the IMS registration. The MSC Server
shall also derive IMS user identities required for the registration from this
identity. The MSC Server shall derive these identities in a manner that
prevents collisions with other identities automatically derived from the same
subscriber identity. See clause 4.6.2 of the present document for more
information on the identities used.
The MSC Server then initiates a registration on behalf of the ICS User towards
the home IMS indicating support for GRUU and including an InstanceID. If a
GRUU is received, the MSC Server shall store it. The MSC Server shall not
apply the mechanism for multiple simultaneous registrations.
NOTE 3: IMS authorization of registrations from an MSC Server enhanced for ICS
is defined in clause 9.
The MSC Server shall indicate in the registration the media capabilities that
it supports (as listed in TS 22.101 [9]).
The routing of the registration messaging is performed by standard IMS routing
procedures. The S‑CSCF shall perform 3rd party registration towards the SCC
AS. The SCC AS shall obtain from the S‑CSCF the necessary information related
to the contact address for performing T‑ADS.
If the S-CSCF receives IMS de-registration from MSC, or receives IMS
registration from new MSC while there is a valid IMS registration from old
MSC, the S-CSCF releases the existing sessions which includes early session as
defined in TS 24.229 [31].
If IMS registration is successful, then subsequent IMS sessions described in
clause 4.4.2 shall be supported in IMS using the MSC Server procedures
described in this specification.
The success or failure of the IMS registration shall not impact the CS attach
status of the UE.
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall initiate IMS re-registration as
necessary to maintain an active IMS registration during the period of time in
which the UE is attached to the CS domain.
NOTE 4: Due to the MSC Server not applying the mechanism for multiple
simultaneous registrations, this results in the behaviour of when a UE
attaches to a new MSC Server enhanced for ICS and the old MSC Server enhanced
for ICS has not deregistered the user, the new registration over-writes the
existing one in the S‑CSCF.
After successful initial IMS registration, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS
shall subscribe to the registration event package described in TS 23.228 [2]
on behalf of the ICS User. The MSC Server shall use the default Public User
Identity received during initial IMS registration for subscription to this
package. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall refresh this subscription as
necessary during the period of time in which its IMS registration on behalf of
the ICS User is active.
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall initiate IMS deregistration on behalf of
the ICS User upon receipt of any indication that the UE is no longer
considered active at this MSC Server (e.g. Location Cancellation procedure,
Purge MS procedure, etc.). In order to ensure that the registration request
from the target MSC Server arrives at the S‑CSCF prior to the deregistration
request from the source MSC Server, the MSC Server should delay the
deregistration procedure, such as by starting a timer. If the S‑CSCF finds an
existing binding upon receiving the deregistration request as specified in TS
24.229 [31] and identifies that is a request initiated by the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS on behalf of the ICS User, the S‑CSCF shall compare the
contact address in the deregistration request with the contact address in the
existing binding using the URI comparison rules. If it agrees, the S‑CSCF will
remove the existing binding. Otherwise, the de-registration request fails. Per
operator policy, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall also initiate IMS re-
registrations to obtain additional temporary-GRUUs as need.
Upon receipt of a network-initiated deregistration from the IMS, the MSC
Server enhanced for ICS shall remove all registration details relating to the
Public User Identities contained in the deregistration. Network-initiated
deregistration from IMS shall not impact the UE\'s CS registration status.
#### 7.2.1.2 Registration using I2 reference point
Figure 7.2.1.2-1 describes how IMS registration is performed by the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS upon receiving of a Location Update Request.
Figure 7.2.1.2-1: Initial IMS Registration via CS Access
1\. The UE sends a Location Update Request towards the CS network.
NOTE 1: Combined RA/LA Update Request (as specified in TS 23.060 [35]) can be
used instead when the network is in MNO I configuration.
NOTE 2: Combined TA/LA Update procedure (as specified in TS 23.272 [44]) can
be used instead when the network supports EMM combined procedures.
2\. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS performs standard CS location update,
authentication and obtains subscriber data.
3\. A Location Area Update Accept is returned to the UE.
NOTE 3: If Combined RA/LA Update Request is used in Step 1, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS does not return Location Area Update Accept to the UE but
returns Location Update Accept to SGSN, as specified in TS 23.060 [35].
NOTE 4: If Combined TA/LA Update procedure is used in Step 1, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS does not return Location Area Update Accept to the UE but
returns Location Update Accept to MME, as specified in TS 23.272 [44].
4\. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS decides to initiate IMS registration for
this subscriber. If the subscriber is already registered via this MSC Server
enhanced for ICS, no IMS registration is sent.
5\. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS derives a domain name from the
subscriber\'s identity (e.g. IMSI) and discovers the address of the
appropriate I‑CSCF/IBCF.
6\. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS sends a SIP REGISTER to the IMS with a
private and temporary Public User Identity derived from the subscriber\'s IMSI
as well as an InstanceID. The REGISTER also contains information indicating
the capabilities (e.g. media types) supported and characteristics of the MSC
Server as a SIP User Agent Client. The I‑CSCF verifies that the incoming
REGISTER origins from a trusted MSC Server (in the same way it would check
that a normal REGISTER origins from a trusted P‑CSCF).
7\. The I‑CSCF initiates standard procedures for S‑CSCF location/allocation.
8\. The I‑CSCF forwards the REGISTER to the S‑CSCF.
9\. The S‑CSCF identifies the REGISTER as being from the MSC Server. The
S‑CSCF skips any further authentication procedures and performs registration
procedures with the HSS.
10\. The S‑CSCF performs standard service control execution procedures. Filter
criteria directs the S‑CSCF to send a REGISTER to the SCC AS.
11\. IMS registration procedures are completed.
#### 7.2.1.3 Deregistration using I2 reference point
Figure 7.2.1.3-1 describes how IMS deregistration is performed by an MSC
Server enhanced for ICS upon detection of the Location Cancellation procedure.
In this scenario, the UE is moving away from an MSC Server enhanced for ICS to
an MSC Server not enhanced for ICS. Identical IMS deregistration procedures
are initiated by the source MSC Server enhanced for ICS upon receiving of any
other indication that the UE is no longer considered registered.
Figure 7.2.1.3-1: IMS Deregistration via CS Access by source MSC Server
enhanced for ICS when moving to an MSC Server not enhanced for ICS
1\. The UE initiates standard location updating procedures toward the CS
network.
2\. The CS network performs standard CS location updating and authentication
procedures.
3\. The HSS initiates location cancellation procedures towards the source MSC
Server that is enhanced for ICS.
4\. On receipt of the Cancel Location, the source MSC Server should delay the
deregistration procedure for a short period of time, e.g. by starting a timer.
NOTE: The delay mentioned in step 4 is used to reduce the signalling at S‑CSCF
when UE moves between MSC Servers enhanced for ICS (see clause 7.2.1.4). The
delay needs to be long enough to ensure that the deregistration request from
the source MSC Server arrives at the S‑CSCF after the registration request
from target MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
5\. The I‑CSCF initiates standard procedures for S‑CSCF location/allocation.
6\. The I‑CSCF forwards the REGISTER to the S‑CSCF.
7\. The S‑CSCF identifies the REGISTER as being from an MSC Server enhanced
for ICS that is a trusted network node. The S‑CSCF skips any further
authentication procedures and performs deregistration procedures with the HSS.
8\. The S‑CSCF performs the procedures as described in clause 7.2.1.1. As the
contact address in the REGISTER is the same with the contact address in the
existing binding, the S‑CSCF performs standard service control execution
procedures. Filter criteria directs the S‑CSCF to send a REGISTER to the SCC
AS.
9\. IMS deregistration procedures are completed.
#### 7.2.1.4 Registration after Deregistration using I2 reference point
Figure 7.2.1.4-1 describes how IMS deregistration is performed by the MSC
Server enhanced for ICS upon detection of the Location Cancellation procedure.
In this scenario, the UE is moving between two MSC Servers enhanced for ICS.
Identical IMS deregistration procedures are initiated by the source MSC Server
enhanced for ICS upon receiving of any other indication that the UE is no
longer considered registered. The registration request from the target MSC
Server enhanced for ICS arrives at the S‑CSCF after the deregistration request
from the source MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
Figure 7.2.1.4-1: IMS Deregistration via CS Access by source MSC Server
enhanced for ICS when moving to a target MSC Server enhanced for ICS
1\. The UE initiates standard location updating procedures towards the CS
network.
NOTE 1: Combined RA/LA Update Request (as specified in TS 23.060 [35]) can be
used when the network is in MNO I configuration.
NOTE 2: Combined TA/LA Update procedure (as specified in TS 23.272 [44]) can
be used instead when the network supports EMM combined procedures.
2\. The CS network performs standard CS location updating and authentication
procedures.
3\. The HSS initiates location cancellation procedures towards the source MSC
Server enhanced for ICS.
4\. The source MSC Server enhanced for ICS initiates IMS de-registration as
described in clause 7.2.1.3. The S‑CSCF removes the existing binding related
to the source MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
5\. The target MSC Server that is also enhanced for ICS initiates IMS
registration as described in clause 7.2.1.2. The S‑CSCF establishes a new
binding related to the target MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
NOTE 3: If step 5 is performed before step 4, the de-registration of the
source MSC Server enhanced for ICS does not affect the new registered contact
of the target MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
#### 7.2.1.5 Registration before Deregistration using I2 reference point
Figure 7.2.1.5-1 describes how IMS deregistration is performed by the MSC
Server enhanced for ICS upon detection of the Location Cancellation procedure.
In this scenario, the UE is moving between two MSC Servers enhanced for ICS.
Identical IMS deregistration procedures are initiated by the source MSC Server
enhanced for ICS upon receiving of any other indication that the UE is no
longer considered registered. The registration request from the target MSC
Server enhanced for ICS arrives at the S‑CSCF before the deregistration
request from the source MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
Figure 7.2.1.5-1: IMS Deregistration via CS Access by source MSC Server
enhanced for ICS when moving to a target MSC Server enhanced for ICS
1\. The UE initiates standard location updating procedures towards the CS
network.
NOTE 1: Combined RA/LA Update Request (as specified in TS 23.060 [35]) can be
used when the network is in MNO I configuration.
NOTE 2: Combined TA/LA Update procedure (as specified in TS 23.272 [44]) can
be used instead when the network supports EMM combined procedures.
2\. The CS network performs standard CS location updating and authentication
procedures.
3\. The HSS initiates location cancellation procedures towards the source MSC
Server enhanced for ICS.
4\. The target MSC Server that is also enhanced for ICS initiates IMS
registration as described in clause 7.2.1.2. The S‑CSCF updates a existing
binding related to the source MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
5\. The source MSC Server that is enhanced for ICS initiates IMS
deregistration for this subscriber.
6\. The I‑CSCF initiates standard procedures for S‑CSCF location/allocation.
7\. The I‑CSCF forwards the REGISTER to the S‑CSCF.
8\. The S‑CSCF identifies the REGISTER as being from an MSC Server enhanced
for ICS that is a trusted network node. The S‑CSCF skips any further
authentication procedures and performs deregistration procedures as described
in clause 7.2.1.1. As the contact address in the REGISTER differs from the
contact address in the existing binding related to the target MSC Server, the
S‑CSCF returns an error response to the source MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
### 7.2.2 IMS Registration via IP-CAN
Whenever the ICS UE acquires IP connectivity via an IP-CAN, the UE shall
register in the IMS if not already registered in IMS. Registration with IMS is
in accordance with the procedure as defined in TS 23.228 [2].
3rd-party registration shall be performed by the S‑CSCF via the ISC interface
towards the SCC AS. This supports ADS functionality in the SCC AS.
1\. The UE registers in the IMS as described in clause 5.2.2.3 of TS 23.228
[2] indicating its abilities to use ICS.
NOTE: Access networks capabilities could be taken into account when sending
any indications.
2\. The S‑CSCF informs the SCC AS about the registration, using the procedures
defined in clause 6.3 of TS 23.218 [7].
IMS registration via IP-CAN is performed independently of the UE\'s CS state.
Information regarding home network support of ICS shall be configured in the
ICS UE, e.g. via OMA DM [24].
## 7.3 Originations
### 7.3.1 Originating sessions that use PS media
When the ICS UE has access to a PS network that supports the full duplex
speech component of an IMS service, the originating IMS procedures (as
described in clause 5.6 of TS 23.228 [2]) shall be used to set up the session.
The S‑CSCF shall insert the SCC AS in the IMS session path using originating
initial filter criteria. The SCC AS shall be the first AS inserted into the
session path.
### 7.3.2 Originating sessions that use CS media
#### 7.3.2.1 Non ICS UE originating sessions that use CS media
##### 7.3.2.1.1 Overview
Originating sessions that use CS media made by non ICS UEs that have been
successfully registered in IMS by the MSC Server can utilize IMS service
control. The non ICS UE initiates a standard CS originating session toward the
MSC Server enhanced for ICS, which in turn can initiate an IMS originating
session using the I2 reference point.
For these sessions, the MSC Server shall perform interworking between the I2
reference point and CS signalling (e.g. as described in TS 24.008 [6]). The
MSC Server shall also control a CS-MGW using the Mc reference point to perform
interworking between CS access bearers and RTP bearers on the Mb reference
point. For emergency sessions, the MSC Server may perform existing MSC Server
emergency call handling procedures or interworking with IMS as specified in
clause 7.3.2.3.
For video call originating sessions that use CS media, the MSC Server enhanced
for ICS shall also, after the multimedia connection is established, perform
the video codec negotiation for the non ICS UE and set up the video media
bearer based upon the procedures defined in TS 29.163 [11] for 3GPP systems
and based on procedures defined in 3GPP2 C.S0042 [38] for 3GPP2 systems.
The SCC AS shall be inserted in the IMS session path using the iFC.
##### 7.3.2.1.2 Origination using I2 reference point
Figure 7.3.2.1.2-1 describes how IMS originations are performed via CS access
for non ICS UE. This call flow also applies for an ICS UE CS origination with
CS media without use of I1 and with use of an MSC server enhanced for ICS, as
specified in clause 7.3.2.2.3.
Figure 7.3.2.1.2-1: IMS Origination via CS Access for non ICS UE
1\. The UE A sends a CS call setup message containing the B-party number to
the MSC Server enhanced for ICS according to standard CS originating
procedures.
2\. The MSC Server sends an INVITE to the S‑CSCF with the Request-URI set to
the B-party number. If a GRUU is to be included as described in TS 23.228 [2],
then include a temporary-GRUU as the contact address if privacy has been
requested or a public-GRUU if privacy has not been requested. The INVITE also
contains SDP received from the CS-MGW. The MSC Server adds the User Location
Information (e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone Information to the INVITE.
For a roaming user, when the Roaming Architecture for Voice over IMS with
Local Breakout is supported according to clause 4.15a of TS 23.228 [2], the
MSC Server may, based on operator policy, add a reference to the preferred
Transit and Roaming Function.
3\. The S‑CSCF performs standard service control execution procedures. Filter
criteria direct the S‑CSCF to send the INVITE to the SCC AS.
4\. The SCC AS invokes a B2BUA, terminating the UE A Leg and originating the
Remote Leg for presentation of an IMS session towards the B-party on behalf of
UE A. The SCC AS creates an INVITE containing the SDP received in the CS
Bearer Control Signalling Path, indicating CS voice or voice and video media.
The INVITE request is routed from the SCC AS to the S‑CSCF.
5\. The S‑CSCF continues with standard IMS originated session processing and
routes the request onwards to the B-party.
6\. Completion of the session and bearer control setup procedures. For video
call, to complete the session and bearer setup, the specific handling as
described in clause 7.3.2.1.1 applies.
##### 7.3.2.1.3 Origination when using an MSC Server
Figure 7.3.2.1.3-1 describes how IMS originations are performed via CS access
for non ICS UE attached to a legacy MSC or MSC-Server which has not been
enhanced for ICS. This call flow also applies for an ICS UE CS origination
with CS media without use of I1 and with use of an MSC server, as specified in
clause 7.3.2.2.3.
Figure 7.3.2.1.3-1: IMS Origination via CS Access for non ICS UE
1\. The UE A originates a call in the CS domain to party-B according to
standard origination procedures.
2\. The MSC Server responds with a Call Proceeding message and begins to set
up the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path.
3\. The MSC-Server fetches an IP Multimedia Routing Number (IMRN) via IN (e.g.
CAMEL) and routes the call towards the user\'s home IMS network using the IMRN
via an MGCF.
4\. The MGCF initiates an INVITE towards the I‑CSCF in the home IMS of the
originating ICS user.
5\. The I‑CSCF routes the INVITE based on one of the following standard
procedures specified in \"PSI based Application Server termination - direct
and PSI based Application Server termination -- indirect\" procedures in TS
23.228 [2] either directly to the SCC AS or via the S‑CSCF.
6\. When the INVITE arrives at the SCC AS, it invokes a B2BUA, terminating the
UE A leg and originating the Remote Leg for presenting an IMS session towards
the B-party on behalf of UE A. The SCC AS creates an INVITE containing the SDP
received from MGCF, indicating CS voice or voice and video media. The original
called number and the calling party number are used to setup the outgoing call
leg to party-B in accordance with the AS origination procedure defined in
clause 5.6.5 of TS 23.228 [2]. If required the SCC AS adds User Location
Information (e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone Information to the INVITE.
The SCC AS sends the INVITE back to S‑CSCF.
NOTE 1: The method for discovery of original called number and calling party
number at the SCC AS if ISUP does not provide this information is
implementation dependant. This can be realized by interactions between the SCC
AS and the SCF (e.g. gsmSCF); however this interaction is outside the scope of
this specification.
NOTE 2: The method for determining User Location Information (e.g. CGI or SAI)
and/or UE Time Zone Information at the SCC AS is implementation dependant.
This can be realized by interactions between the SCC AS and the SCF (e.g.
gsmSCF). The SCC AS can also retrieve the User Location Information (e.g. CGI
or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone Information from the MSC via the HSS as specified
in TS 29.328 [48] and as described in clause 4.2.4a of TS 23.228 [2].
7-8. The S‑CSCF sends the INVITE further for completion of the call toward the
remote end. For video call, to complete the session and bearer setup, the
specific handling as described in clause 7.3.2.1.1 applies.
#### 7.3.2.2 ICS UE Originating sessions that use CS media
##### 7.3.2.2.1 Overview
IMS service control is used for ICS UE originated sessions that use a CS media
bearer.
When using the Gm reference point, the ICS UE initiates a standard IMS
originating session indicating use of CS media bearer for the session. The SCC
AS is inserted in the IMS session path using originating iFC. The ICS UE also
sets up a standard CS originated session addressing a PSI DN associated with
the SCC AS to establish the CS bearer if a CS bearer is not available for the
ICS UE. The CS bearer shall be reused if already established using the Gm
reference point. The service control signalling is combined with the
description of the CS bearer at the SCC AS for presentation of the IMS
originating session to the S‑CSCF over the Remote Leg.
When a subsequent session origination with different CS bearer requirement
occurs (i.e. CS audio bearer is changed to CS video bearer, or vice versa),
the CS bearer shall be updated if possible through SCUDIF or redial (refer to
clause 7.9.2).
The ICS UE should be able to detect an emergency session establishment
request. If the ICS UE using a CS access detects the request for the
establishment of an emergency session, the ICS UE shall attempt to initiate a
CS emergency call.
If the ICS UE could not detect an emergency call and originates the session
with CS media using Gm reference point, it will forward an IMS session
establishment request to the P‑CSCF. If the P‑CSCF detects such an emergency
call, it rejects the request with an indication that this is for an emergency
session as described in TS 23.167 [25].
NOTE: If the P‑CSCF is not ICS aware, it is assumed that some other node in
the emergency session path will detect the unsupported media and reject it or
the call will be delivered to the PSAP without voice media component. Normal
error handling applies in this case.
As described in TS 23.167 [25], an ICS UE that initiated a non UE detectable
emergency session will receive an indication in responses from which it can
deduce that the session is for emergency. Upon receiving an emergency session
rejection or session rejection with this indication, the ICS UE shall fall
back to CS according to TS 23.167 [25].
When not using the Gm reference point, the following apply:
\- For sessions originated using a B party\'s SIP URI (not using user =
phone), the ICS UE initiates a dialogue with the SCC AS over the I1 reference
point indicating session origination. The ICS UE also sets up a CS originated
session addressing a PSI DN associated with the SCC AS to establish the CS
bearer. The service control signalling is combined with the description of the
CS bearer at the SCC AS for presentation of the IMS originating session to the
S‑CSCF over the Remote Leg.
\- For all other cases, the ICS UE initiates a standard CS originating call
using B party\'s E.164 number. The call is routed to IMS via a standard MSC
Server using IN (e.g. CAMEL) based redirection or an MSC Server enhanced with
ICS. If the B party number is detected by the MSC Server as an emergency
number then it will be handled as per existing MSC Server call handling
procedures. Additionally, the ICS UE may use the I1 reference point for
communication of additional parameters.
For video call originating sessions that use CS media, the following apply:
\- When the ICS UE is attached to the MSC Server enhanced for ICS, after the
multimedia connection is established, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall
perform the video codec negotiation for the ICS UE and set up the video media
bearer based upon the procedures defined in TS 29.163 [11] for 3GPP systems
and based on the procedures defined in 3GPP2 C.S0042 [38] for 3GPP2 systems;
\- When the ICS UE is attached to the MSC Server not enhanced for ICS, the
MGCF/IMS-MGW shall perform the video codec negotiation for the ICS UE and set
up the video media bearer as specified in TS 29.163 [11] for 3GPP systems and
as specified in 3GPP2 C.S0042 [38] for 3GPP2 systems.
The following clauses show pairs of flows, one for an ICS UE when using an MSC
Server and the other for an MSC Server enhanced for ICS. They are for the most
part identical except that in the case of an MSC Server enhanced for ICS the
INVITE towards the SCC AS is sent directly from the MSC Server whereas an MSC
Server sends an ISUP IAM and the MGCF interworks this to an INVITE towards the
SCC AS.
A \"Gm origination with CS media\" policy may be provisioned by the operator
and communicated to the ICS UE during initial provisioning or via OMA Device
Management [24].
NOTE 1: Operators who choose to make use of ICS UEs may update this policy in
order to optimize the user experience depending on knowledge of the
capabilities of the Home PLMN and Visited PLMN (if roaming), in particular
whether the MSC Server is enhanced for ICS, whether IN re-routing is possible
and whether the ICS UE may be handed over to a non DTM-enabled GERAN.
For originating sessions that use CS media, when the use of the Gm reference
point is possible, the ICS UE shall behave as follows, depending on the \"Gm
origination with CS media\" policy:
\- if this policy is set to \"Gm disabled\", then the ICS UE shall not use the
procedure specified in clause 7.3.2.2.4.
\- if this policy is set to \"Gm enabled but not preferred\", then:
\- if the destination is a Tel URI or a SIP-URI representing a telephone
number, and the exchange of additional SIP parameters is not required, then
the ICS UE shall not use the procedure specified in clause 7.3.2.2.4;
\- otherwise, the ICS UE shall use the procedure specified in clause
7.3.2.2.4.
\- if this policy is set to \"Gm enabled\", then the ICS UE shall use the
procedure specified in clause 7.3.2.2.4.
NOTE 2: When setting the \"Gm origination with CS media\" policy to the ICS
UE, the home operator is able to consider whether the MSC in VPLMN has been
enhanced for ICS or not, and in the latter case the operator can enable the Gm
reference point for ICS service control. When roaming, the Home operator can
update this policy depending on the VPLMN, e.g. based on roaming agreements.

Figure 7.3.2.2.2.1-1 provides an example flow for a session origination by an
ICS UE when a SIP-URI is used to address the called party and when the ICS UE
is attached to an MSC Server enhanced for ICS and the user is identified as an
ICS user.

when using an MSC Server enhanced for ICS
NOTE 1: 4, 5, 6 and 7 are related to the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path.
The other steps are related to the CS Service Control Signalling Path.
1\. The ICS UE A initiates a call by sending an ICS Call Initiation Request
over the I1 reference point containing the UE B address.
2\. The SCC AS performs the necessary adaptation of the signalling received
over the I1 reference point. The SCC AS allocates a PSI DN and sends it to the
ICS UE A.
3\. The SCC AS sends the SCC AS PSI DN to the UE over the I1 reference point.
4\. The ICS UE A uses standard CS originating procedures to establish a CS
Bearer Control Signalling Path with the SCC AS by sending a SETUP message to
the MSC Server containing the SCC AS PSI DN.
5\. The MSC Server responds with a Call Proceeding message and begins to set
up the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path.
6\. The MSC Server sends an INVITE to the S‑CSCF with the Request-URI set to
the SCC AS PSI. If a GRUU is to be included as described in TS 23.228 [2],
then include a temporary-GRUU as the contact address if privacy has been
requested or public-GRUU if privacy has not been requested. The MSC Server
adds the User Location Information (e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone
Information to the INVITE.
7\. The S‑CSCF carries out standard processing of originating initial filter
criteria and sends the INVITE to the SCC AS. The SCC AS is the first AS
inserted in the session path.
8\. The SCC AS invokes a B2BUA, terminating the UE Leg and originating the
Remote Leg for presentation of an IMS session towards the B-party on behalf of
ICS UE A. The SCC AS correlates the CS bearer control signalling session with
the service control signalling session using the SCC AS PSI and creates a SIP
INVITE containing the SDP received in the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path,
indicating CS voice or voice and video media. The INVITE request is routed
from the SCC AS to the S‑CSCF.
9\. The S‑CSCF continues with standard IMS originated session processing and
routes the request onwards to the B-party.
10\. Completion of the Service Control Signalling Path and the CS Bearer
Control Signalling Path setup procedures. For video call, to complete the
session and bearer setup, the specific handling as described in clause
7.3.2.2.1 applies.
Figure 7.3.2.2.2.1-2 provides an example flow for a session origination by an
ICS UE when a SIP-URI is used to address the called party and when the ICS UE
is attached to an MSC Server.

when using an MSC Server
NOTE 2: Steps 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are related to the CS Bearer Control Signalling
Path. The other steps are related to the setup of the Service Control
Signalling Path.
Steps 1-5 in Figure 7.3.2.2.2.1-2 are identical to steps 1-5 in Figure
7.3.2.2.2.1-1.
**At Steps 6 and 7,** the MSC Server sends the IAM using the SCC AS PSI DN to
an MGCF which is subsequently inter-worked to an INVITE.
Steps 8-11 in Figure 7.3.2.2.2.1-2 are identical to steps 7-10 in Figure
7.3.2.2.2.1-1.
##### 7.3.2.2.2.2 Originations to a B-party number other than SIP-URI
{#originations-to-a-b-party-number-other-than-sip-uri .H6}
Figure 7.3.2.2.2.2-1 provides an example flow for a session origination by an
ICS UE where the I1 reference point is used to set up the session and the user
dials a E.164 number, Tel-URI or SIP-URI user=phone, and when the ICS UE is
attached to an MSC Server enhanced for ICS and the user is identified as an
ICS user.
Figure 7.3.2.2.2.2-1: ICS UE Origination with CS media using a E.164 number,
Tel-URI or SIP-URI user=phone and an MSC Server enhanced for ICS
NOTE 1: Steps 4, 5, 6 and 7 are related to the CS Bearer Control Signalling
Path. The other steps are related to the setup of the Service Control
Signalling Path.
1\. The ICS UE A initiates a call by sending an ICS Call Initiation Request
over the I1 reference point containing the UE B address. The ICS UE A also
indicates in the I1 message that an SCC AS PSI DN is not needed for this
session.
2\. The SCC AS performs the necessary adaptation of the signalling received
over the I1 reference point. The SCC AS notes the SCC AS PSI DN is not used
for this session.
3\. The SCC AS returns an ICS Call Initiation Result to ICS UE A over the I1
reference point.
4\. The ICS UE A uses standard CS originating procedures to establish a CS
Bearer Control Signalling Path with the IUA of the SCC AS by sending a SETUP
message to the MSC Server containing the B-party-number. If the B party number
is detected by the MSC Server as an emergency number then it will be handled
as per existing MSC Server call handling procedures.
When the user dials a Non-UE detectable Emergency DN or Emergency URI but I1
has been established, or if the CS origination fails to be routed into IMS, a
timer running at the SCC AS will expire as the CS Bearer Control Signalling
Path was not established towards the SCC AS and an appropriate indication is
returned to the UE The UE shall not release the CS bearer on receipt of this
indication and the UE shall not use the Service Control Signalling Path
further for the call.
5\. The MSC Server responds with a Call Proceeding message and begins to set
up the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path.
6\. The MSC Server sends an INVITE to the S‑CSCF with the destination set to
the called party number and the source to the calling party. If a GRUU is to
be included as described in TS 23.228 [2], then include a temporary-GRUU as
the contact address if privacy has been requested or public-GRUU if privacy
has not been requested. The MSC Server adds the User Location Information
(e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone Information to the INVITE.
7\. The S‑CSCF carries out standard processing of originating initial filter
criteria and sends the INVITE to the SCC AS.
8\. The SCC AS invokes a B2BUA, terminating the UE Leg and originating the
Remote Leg for presentation of an IMS session towards the B-party on behalf of
ICS UE A. The IUA correlates the CS bearer control signalling session with the
service control signalling session and creates a SIP INVITE containing the SDP
received in the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path, indicating CS voice or
voice and video media and routes the INVITE request to the S‑CSCF. If the SCC
AS obtains the calling party identify from step 1, then the SCC AS shall use
this identity from step 1 as the calling party identity. Otherwise, then the
SCC AS shall use the calling party identity received in step 6.
9\. The S‑CSCF continues with standard IMS originated session processing and
routes the request onwards to the B-party.
10\. Completion of the Service Control Signalling Path and the CS Bearer
Control Signalling Path setup procedures. For video call, to complete the
session and bearer setup, the specific handling as described in clause
7.3.2.2.1 applies.
Figure 7.3.2.2.2.2-2 provides an example flow for a session origination by an
ICS UE where the I1 reference point is used to set up the session and the user
dials a E.164 number, Tel-URI or SIP-URI user=phone and when the ICS UE is
attached to an MSC Server.

NOTE 2: Steps 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 are related to the CS Bearer Control Signalling
Path. The other steps are related to the setup of the Service Control
Signalling Path.
Steps 1-5 in Figure 7.3.2.2.2.2-2 are identical to steps 1-5 in Figure
7.3.2.2.2.2-1.
**In Steps 6 and 7, IN (e.g.** CAMEL) origination triggers are used at the MSC
Server for fetching of an IP Multimedia Routing Number (IMRN). The MSC Server
sends an IAM to an MGCF using the IMRN which is subsequently inter-worked to
an INVITE.
In Step 8, the S‑CSCF carries out standard processing of originating initial
filter criteria and sends the INVITE to the SCC AS. This step is skipped if
the I‑CSCF routes the INVITE request directly to the SCC AS.
**Steps 9-11 in Figure 7.3.2.2.2.2-2 are identical to steps 8-10 in Figure
7.3.2.2.2.2-1.**
NOTE 3: The method for discovery of original called number and calling party
number at the SCC AS if ISUP does not provide this information is
implementation dependant. This can be realized by interactions between the SCC
AS and the SCF (e.g. gsmSCF); however this interaction is outside the scope of
this specification.
##### 7.3.2.2.3 Originations with CS media when not using I1
This procedure may be used when the ICS User dials an E.164 number, a Tel URI
or a SIP-URI user=phone, and the exchange of additional SIP parameters is not
required. The ICS UE initiates a standard CS originating using the B-party\'s
E.164 number or a number derived from the Tel-URI. The call is routed to IMS
via an MSC Server which is enhanced to support ICS or a standard MSC Server
using IN (e.g. CAMEL) based re-direction.
Figure 7.3.2.1.2-1 provides an example flow for a session origination by an
ICS UE where the I1 reference point is not required to set up the session and
a MSC Server enhanced for ICS is used to set-up the CS Bearer Control
Signalling Path and the user is identified as an ICS user.
For a session origination by an ICS UE where the I1 reference point is not
required to set up the session and a MSC Server enhanced for ICS is not used
to set-up the CS bearer control signalling, an example call flow is shown in
Figure 7.3.2.1.3-1.
##### 7.3.2.2.4 Originations with CS media using the Gm reference point
Figure 7.3.2.2.4-1 provides an example flow for a session origination by an
ICS UE attached to an MSC Server enhanced for ICS where the Gm reference point
is used to set up the session with the CS media bearer.
Figure 7.3.2.2.4-1: ICS UE Origination with CS media using Gm reference point
when using an MSC Server enhanced for ICS
NOTE 1: Steps 6, 7, 8 and 9 are related to the CS Bearer Control Signalling
Path. The other steps are related to the setup of the Service Control
Signalling Path.
1\. The ICS UE A sets up a Service Control Signalling Path by initiating a
standard IMS origination session towards the UE B. A SIP INVITE request
(indicating the use of CS media for the session) is sent to the S‑CSCF serving
the UE A in the home IMS network.
2\. The SCC AS is inserted in the IMS session path using originating initial
filter criteria at the S‑CSCF. The SCC AS is the first AS inserted in the
session path.
3\. The SCC AS allocates a PSI DN and sends it to the ICS UE A.
4\. The SCC AS returns the SCC AS PSI DN in a reliable provisional response to
the S‑CSCF
5\. The S‑CSCF forwards the provisional response (containing the SCC AS PSI
DN) to ICS UE A.
6\. The ICS UE uses standard CS originating procedures to establish the CS
Bearer Control Signalling Path with the SCC AS by sending a CS call setup
message to the MSC Server containing the SCC AS PSI DN.
NOTE 2: The UE waits for the SIP response (step 5) before the UE generates the
CS call setup.
7\. The MSC Server responds with a Call Proceeding message and begins to set
up the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path.
8\. The MSC Server sends an INVITE to the S‑CSCF with the Request-URI set to
the SCC AS PSI. If a GRUU is to be included as described in TS 23.228 [2],
then include a temporary-GRUU as the contact address if privacy has been
requested or public-GRUU if privacy has not been requested. The MSC Server
adds the User Location Information (e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone
Information to the INVITE.
9\. The S‑CSCF carries out standard processing of originating initial filter
criteria and sends the INVITE to the SCC AS.
10\. The SCC AS invokes a B2BUA, terminating the Access Leg and originating
the Remote Leg for presentation of an IMS session towards the B-party on
behalf of ICS UE A. The SCC AS correlates the CS bearer control signalling
with the service control signalling and combines both the SDP offers into one
offer towards the UE B. The SCC AS inserts the SDP received on the CS Bearer
Control Signalling Path into the INVITE indicating CS media towards the
B-party. The INVITE request is routed from the SCC AS to the S‑CSCF.
11\. The S‑CSCF continues with standard IMS originated session processing and
routes the request onwards to the B-party
12\. Completion of the Service Control Signalling Path and the CS Bearer
Control Signalling Path setup procedures. For video call, to complete the
session and bearer setup, the specific handling as described in clause
7.3.2.2.1 applies.
Figure 7.3.2.2.4-2 provides an example flow for a session origination by an
ICS UE attached to an MSC Server where the Gm reference point is used to set
up the session with the CS media bearer.

Signalling Path. The other steps are related to the setup of the Service
Control Signalling Path.
Steps 1-7 in Figure 7.3.2.2.4-2 are identical to steps 1-7 in Figure
7.3.2.2.4-1.
At Steps 8 and 9, the MSC server sends the IAM using the SCC AS PSI DN to an
MGCF which is subsequently inter-worked to an INVITE.
Steps 10-13 in Figure 7.3.2.2.4-2 are identical to steps 9-12 in Figure
7.3.2.2.4-1.
#### 7.3.2.3 CS Emergency call interworking with IMS
If the MSC Server enhanced with ICS supports I6, it may perform the following
procedure to interwork with IMS for handling CS emergency call to PSAP.
If the MSC Server detects a CS emergency call (i.e, due to CS setup with
emergency indication or detection of locally defined emergency number) from an
UE that has already been registered in this MSC Server using I2 registration
procedure, then MSC Server shall perform a registration for the support of
emergency services (emergency registration) to IMS via I2. The MSC Server then
proceeds with emergency session establishment request to E-CSCF via I6.
If MSC Server is required to handle anonymous emergency call (i.e., based on
local regulation), MSC Server shall not perform any registration procedure to
IMS and shall directly proceed with anonymous emergency requests toward E-CSCF
via I6.
If the MSC Server detects that the CS emergency call is tagged with eCall
indication from the UE, MSC Server shall include the IMS eCall indication in
the emergency session establishment request to E-CSCF via I6. The UE transfers
the MSD using in-band modem as defined for CS eCall. The MSC Server and IMS
shall transfer the MSD data in an end to end fashion, UE to PSAP, in the form
generated by the UE.
For UE that has been registered to this MSC Server but IMS registration using
I2 has not been performed then MSC Server shall fall back to the behaviour of
an MSC Server that is not enhanced for ICS in handling CS emergency call.
## 7.4 Terminations
### 7.4.1 Terminating sessions that use PS media
#### 7.4.1.1 Full duplex speech via PS
When the ICS UE has access to a PS network that supports the full duplex
speech component of an IMS service, terminating IMS procedures (as described
in clause 5.7 of TS 23.228 [2]) shall be used to terminate the session to the
ICS UE. The S‑CSCF shall insert the SCC AS in the IMS session path using
terminating initial filter criteria. The SCC AS shall be the last AS inserted
into the session path.
#### 7.4.1.2 Void
#### 7.4.1.3 Void
### 7.4.2 Terminating sessions that use CS media
#### 7.4.2.1 Non ICS UE terminating sessions that use CS media
##### 7.4.2.1.1 Overview
All ICS User incoming sessions are directed to IMS for delivery to the ICS
User.
Non ICS UEs which have been successfully registered in IMS by the MSC Server
will have a registration binding at the S‑CSCF containing the MSC Server as
the contact address.
The SCC AS shall be inserted in the IMS session path using the terminating
iFC. The SCC AS performs T-ADS for selection of an access and returns
information to assist with S‑CSCF selection of a registered contact address.
When the T-ADS function selects the MSC Server enhanced for ICS, the SCC AS
directs the IMS terminating session towards the contact address of the MSC
Server.
On receipt of the session initiation message, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS
shall perform the necessary interworking between the I2 reference point and CS
signalling (e.g. as described in TS 24.008 [6]). The MSC Server shall also
control a CS-MGW using the Mc reference point to perform the necessary
interworking between RTP bearers on the Mb reference point and CS access
bearers and adds the User Location Information (e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE
Time Zone Information to the response to the session initiation.
The SCC AS may select to breakout an incoming session to the CS domain in
following cases:
\- A non ICS UE is not registered in IMS but can be attached to the CS network
at an MSC Server. In this case, terminating iFC forwards the call to the SCC
AS.
\- A non ICS UE is registered in IMS, the access network does not support the
media type (as defined in clause 22.4 of TS 22.101 [9]), but the UE still can
be attached to the CS network at an MSC Server. In this case, terminating iFC
forwards the call to the SCC AS.
For both scenarios the SCC AS shall retrieve from the HSS the C-MSISDN(s)
associated with all the IMPIs that are associated with the IMPU that is the
target of the session. The SCC AS shall select a single C‑MSISDN and shall use
it to fetch a CSRN for routing the call to the CS domain. The INVITE shall be
sent to the S‑CSCF which then performs CS breakout according to standard IMS
procedures. The INVITE may include an indication that this is an ICS session,
which can be used by the MGCF to handle this session in a specific manner, for
example to make a different cause mapping between ISUP/BICC and SIP than a
normal session breakout would do. The SCC AS may also retrieve the User
Location Information (e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone Information from
the HSS at this time or at the reception of the response, to include it into
the response to the session initiation.
NOTE: The algorithm used by the SCC AS to select a C‑MSISDN is implementation
dependent.
For video call terminating sessions that use CS media, the MSC Server enhanced
for ICS shall also, after the multimedia connection is established, perform
the video codec negotiation for the non ICS UE and set up the video media
bearer based upon the procedures defined in TS 29.163 [11] for 3GPP systems
and based on procedures defined in 3GPP2 C.S0042 [38] for 3GPP2 systems. If
the UE does not support video, or the access network is not capable of video,
then the video component of the session shall not be accepted by the MSC
Server enhanced for ICS.
For voice call terminating sessions that use CS media via I2,, re-routing from
the terminating MSC Server enhanced for ICS to another MSC (ICS enhanced or
not) may be triggered (i.e, due to Mobile Terminating Roaming Retry Call
procedure as defined in TS 23.018 [49], Roaming Retry for CS fallback or
Roaming Forwarding for CS fallback as defined in TS 23.272 [44] is triggered).
If the SCC AS receives from the new MSC (enhanced for ISC- see clause 7.2.1.2)
a new IMS registration for the UE for which the SCC AS just delivered a
session, then:
\- S-CSCF releases the current terminating session setup toward SCC AS/T-ADS
as defined in TS 24.229 [31]; and
\- T-ADS redirects the session to the new MSC.
If the old MSC (terminating MSC) performs IMS deregistration over I2 (see
clause 7.2.1.3), then:
\- S-CSCF releases the current terminating session setup toward SCC AS/T-ADS
as defined in TS 24.229 [31];
\- Based on operator policy, T-ADS may start a timer. The timer is stopped
when new registration is received for the UE;
\- If the T-ADS stopped the timer itself, T-ADS redirects the session to the
new MSC;
\- If the timer expires, T-ADS may invoke other procedure to redeliver the
call (e.g. routing the call to the CS domain).
##### 7.4.2.1.2 Termination using I2 reference point
Figure 7.4.2.1.2-1 describes how IMS terminations are performed via CS access
for non ICS UE registered in IMS. This call flow also applies for an ICS UE
attached to an MSC Server enhanced for ICS where the incoming session is
delivered to the ICS UE using standard CS terminating procedures, as specified
in clause 7.4.2.2.5.
Figure 7.4.2.1.2-1: IMS Termination via CS Access for non ICS UE registered in
IMS
1\. An incoming INVITE is received at the S‑CSCF of the B-party via the
I‑CSCF.
2\. The S‑CSCF performs standard service control execution procedures. Filter
criteria direct the S‑CSCF to send the INVITE to the SCC AS.
3\. The SCC AS performs terminating access domain selection. The SCC AS
chooses the CS access network and the MSC Server contact address, amongst the
registered contact addresses for the UE B, for the setup of the media.
4\. The SCC AS establishes a new session by sending an INVITE to the UE B via
the S‑CSCF.
5\. The S‑CSCF forwards the INVITE to the MSC Server based on the contact
address stored during registration, using standard IMS procedures.
6\. The MSC Server sends a Setup message to the UE B.
7\. Completion of the session and bearer control setup procedures. For video
call, to complete the session and bearer setup, the specific handling as
described in clause 7.4.2.1.1 applies. The MSC Server adds the User Location
Information (e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone Information of the
terminating user to the session initiation response message.
##### 7.4.2.1.3 Termination to non ICS UE not registered in IMS
Figure 7.4.2.1.3-1 describes how IMS terminations are performed via CS access
for non ICS UE not registered in IMS. This call flow also applies for an ICS
UE attached to an MSC Server where the incoming session is delivered to the
ICS UE using standard CS terminating procedures, as specified in clause
7.4.2.2.5.
Figure 7.4.2.1.3-1: IMS Termination via CS Access for non ICS UE not
registered in IMS
1\. An incoming INVITE is received at the S‑CSCF of the B-party.
2\. The S‑CSCF performs standard unregistered service control execution
procedures. The terminating iFC direct the INVITE to the SCC AS for
terminating access domain selection.
3\. The T-ADS function chooses breakout to the CS domain. A CSRN is fetched
for routing to the CS domain. If the SCC AS interacts with the HSS to fetch
the CSRN, it may also indicate to the HSS the support of MTRR as specified in
TS 23.018 [49].
NOTE 1: At this point, the SCC AS can, as an implementation option, interact
with the HSS to obtain location information.
NOTE 2: Fetching the CSRN is implementation specific.
NOTE 3: If Sh is used for interaction with the HSS and SCC AS indicates
support of MTRR, the SCC AS also provides its MAP address to the HSS.
4\. The SCC AS establishes a new session by sending an INVITE containing the
CSRN and ICS indicator towards the S‑CSCF.
5\. The S‑CSCF then performs CS breakout according to existing IMS procedures.
The call is routed to the CS domain via the BGCF/MGCF.
6\. The MGCF sends an IAM to the MSC Server.
7\. The MSC Server performs paging procedures and sends the CS call setup
message to the UE B. If the UE does not respond to the paging request as
meanwhile it has performed registration with a new MSC Server, the network may
either use the MTRF or MTRR feature as specified in TS 23.018 [49] in order to
re-direct the call towards the new MSC Server. If MTRR is used the SCC AS
emulates GMSC behavior and may request to to re-restart call handling from
step 3 onwards.
8\. Completion of the session and bearer control setup procedures. To complete
the session and bearer setup for a video call the specific handling as
described in clause 7.4.2.1.1 applies. The MGCF may map cause codes received
over the CS leg differently compared to normal CS breakout. If the SCC AS has
User Location Information (e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone Information
available (e.g. from step 3, or by interacting with the HSS at this time), it
adds it to the SIP response.
#### 7.4.2.2 ICS UE Terminating sessions that use CS media
##### 7.4.2.2.1 Overview
IMS service control is used for ICS UE terminating sessions that use CS media.
All ICS User incoming sessions are directed to IMS for delivery to the ICS
User. The SCC AS is inserted in the IMS session path using the terminating
iFCs. The SCC AS performs T-ADS for selection of a contact address amongst the
registered contact addresses for the ICS User and subsequently selects an
access network for delivery of the session to the selected contact address.
When using the Gm reference point for delivery of the incoming session to the
ICS UE, the SCC AS directs the IMS terminating session toward the ICS User\'s
selected contact indicating use of CS bearer for the session. On receipt of
the session initiating message, the ICS UE sets up a standard CS originated
session addressing a PSI DN associated with the SCC AS to establish the CS
bearer if a CS bearer is not available for the ICS UE. The CS bearer shall be
reused if already established using the Gm reference point. The service
control signalling is combined with the description of the CS bearer at the
SCC AS for presentation of IMS terminating session to the S‑CSCF over the
Remote Leg.
When a subsequent session termination with different CS bearer requirement
occurs (i.e. CS audio bearer is changed to CS video bearer, or vice versa),
the CS bearer shall be updated if possible through SCUDIF or redial (refer to
clause 7.9.2).
The following clauses show pairs of flows, one for an ICS UE when using an MSC
Server and the other for an MSC Server enhanced for ICS. They are for the most
part identical except that in the case of an MSC Server enhanced for ICS the
INVITE towards the SCC AS is sent directly from the MSC Server otherwise an
MSC sends an ISUP IAM and the MGCF interworks this to an INVITE towards the
SCC AS.
For video call terminating sessions that use CS media, the following apply:
\- When the ICS UE is attached to the MSC Server enhanced for ICS, after the
multimedia connection is established, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall
perform the video codec negotiation for the ICS UE and set up the video media
bearer based upon the procedures defined in TS 29.163 [11] for 3GPP systems
and based on the procedures defined in 3GPP2 C.S0042 [38] for 3GPP2 systems;
\- When the ICS UE is attached to the MSC Server not enhanced for ICS, the
MGCF/IMS-MGW shall perform the video codec negotiation for the ICS UE and set
up the video media bearer as specified in TS 29.163 [11] for 3GPP systems and
as specified in 3GPP2 C.S0042 [38] for 3GPP2 systems.
##### 7.4.2.2.2 Terminations with CS media using the Gm reference point
Figure 7.4.2.2.2-1 provides an example flow for a call destined to an ICS UE
attached to an MSC server enhanced for ICS, where the incoming session is
delivered over the Gm reference point and the media is established via the CS
network.
Figure 7.4.2.2.2-1: ICS UE Terminations with CS media information flows using
Gm reference point when using an MSC Server enhanced for ICS
NOTE 1: Steps 11, 12, 13 and 14 are related to the setup of the CS Bearer
Control Signalling Path. The other steps are related to the setup of the
Service Control Signalling Path.
1\. An incoming SIP INVITE is received at the S‑CSCF of the B party from UE A.
2\. The S‑CSCF executes terminating initial filter criteria and forwards the
INVITE to the SCC AS.
3\. The SCC AS sends a Session Progress response to the S‑CSCF.
4\. The S‑CSCF forwards the Session Progress response to UE A.
Steps 5a -- 7a are for the case of T-ADS performed by the SCC AS.
5a. The SCC AS performs Terminating Access Domain Selection and chooses the CS
domain for the setup of the media.
6a. The SCC AS terminates the session from the A-party and establishes a new
session by sending an INVITE to the B-party via the I/S‑CSCF. This INVITE
contains an indication to inform the UE to initiate the CS bearer
establishment procedure. The INVITE also contains a dynamic SCC AS PSI to
enable the SCC AS to later on correlate the outgoing service control
signalling with the incoming CS bearer control signalling. When the T-ADS
function selects the Gm reference point for service control the SCC AS
prevents the S‑CSCF from selecting the contact address of the MSC Server, and
the S‑CSCF selects the IP-CAN
7a. The I/S‑CSCF sends the INVITE to B-party.
Steps 5b -- 10 are for the case of UE T-ADS.
5b. Alternatively, in the case of UE T-ADS as defined in clause 5.3.1, the SCC
AS performs initial T‑ADS selecting IMS for the service control signalling
when UE-B is registered in the IMS.
6b The SCC AS terminates the session from the A-party and establishes a new
session by sending an INVITE to the B-party via the I/S‑CSCF. The INVITE
contains options that enable UE-B to choose a CS bearer for bidirectional
speech media transport if it determines that this is not supported by serving
PS Access Network. The INVITE also contains a dynamic SCC AS PSI to enable the
SCC AS to later on correlate the outgoing service control signalling with the
incoming CS bearer control signalling. When the T-ADS function selects the Gm
reference point for service control, the SCC AS prevents the S‑CSCF from
selecting the contact address of the MSC Server, and the S‑CSCF selects the
IP-CAN.
7b. The I/S‑CSCF sends the INVITE to B-party.
8-10 UE-B responds with a Session Progress message. In the case that the PS
access network does not support bidirectional speech media and in the event
the \"IMS voice over PS session supported indication\" indicates voice is not
supported as defined in clause 4.3.5.8 of TS 23.401 [34], UE-B shall indicate
in the Session Progress message that a CS bearer is required for the
bidirectional speech component of the session and that the Gm reference point
is used for service control. The S‑CSCF forwards the Session Progress message
to the SCC AS.
11\. If the establishment mechanism is for UE originated, the ICS UE sends a
CS call setup message to the MSC Server using the SCC AS PSI DN to establish
the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path. This will establish the circuit bearer
between the UE and IMS.
12\. The MSC Server responds with a call proceeding message and begins to set
up the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path.
13\. The MSC Server sends an INVITE towards the I/S‑CSCF containing the SCC AS
PSI and an SDP Offer with the media description from the MGW. The MSC Server
adds the User Location Information (e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone
Information to the INVITE.
14\. The I/S‑CSCF forwards the INVITE to the SCC AS.
15\. The SCC AS continues the session setup towards the A-party for the
original INVITE in Step 1. The response contains an SDP answer with the media
description from the SDP offer received in Step 13.
16\. The SCC AS completes the set-up of the CS Bearer Signalling Path towards
ICS UE B which involves sending a 200 OK in response to the INVITE in Step 14.
The ICS UE B, the MSC Server and the SCC AS complete the setup of the CS
Bearer Control Signalling Path and the Service Control Signalling Path with UE
A.
17\. The ICS UE B continues with the set-up of the Service Control Signalling
Path towards the UE A which includes sending a Ringing response to the SCC AS
via the S‑CSCF. The ICS UE B then completes the set-up of the Service Control
Signalling Path towards the Remote End which includes sending a final 200 OK
message in response to the INVITE received at steps 7a or 7b.
For video call, in Steps 16 and 17, to complete the session and bearer setup,
the specific handling as described in clause 7.4.2.2.1 applies.
Figure 7.4.2.2.2-2 provides an example flow for a call destined to an ICS UE
attached to an MSC server, where the incoming session is delivered over the Gm
reference point and the media is established via the CS network.
Figure 7.4.2.2.2-2: ICS UE Terminations with CS media information flows using
Gm reference point when using an MSC Server
NOTE 2: Steps 11, 12,13,14 and 15 are related to the setup of the CS Bearer
Control Signalling Path. The other steps are related to the setup of the
Service Control Signalling Path.
Steps 1-12 in Figure 7.4.2.2.2-2 are identical to steps 1-12 in Figure
7.4.2.2.2-1.
At Steps 13 and 14, the MSC server sends the IAM to an MGCF using the SCC AS
PSI DN which is subsequently inter-worked to an INVITE containing the SCC AS
PSI and an SDP Offer from the MGW.
Steps 15-18 in Figure 7.4.2.2.2-2 are identical to steps 14-17 in Figure
7.4.2.2.2-1.
##### 7.4.2.2.3 Terminations with CS media using the I1 reference point
Figure 7.4.2.2.3-1 provides an example flow for a call destined to an ICS UE
attached to an MSC server enhanced for ICS, where the incoming session is
delivered over the I1 reference point and the media is established via the CS
network.
Figure 7.4.2.2.3-1: ICS UE Terminations with CS media information flows using
I1 reference point when using an MSC Server enhanced for ICS
NOTE 1: Steps 1-10, 15 and 17-22 are related to the setup of the Service
Control Signalling Path. Steps 11-14 and 16 are related to the setup of the CS
Bearer Control Signalling Path.
1\. An incoming SIP INVITE is received at the S‑CSCF of the B party from UE A.
2\. The S‑CSCF executes terminating initial filter criteria and forwards the
INVITE to the SCC AS.
3\. The SCC AS sends a Session Progress response to the S‑CSCF.
4\. The S‑CSCF forwards the Session Progress response to UE A.
Steps 5a -- 6a are for the case of T-ADS performed by the SCC AS.
5a. The SCC AS performs Terminating Access Domain Selection and if informed of
the UE capability for I1 during IMS registration, chooses the CS domain for
the setup of the media.
NOTE 2: Conveyance of UE capability of support for I1 does not imply that I1
can be established (e.g. the visited network does not support I1).
6a. The SCC AS terminates the session from the A-party and establishes a new
session over I1 by sending an Incoming Call Request to the B-party via the HSS
and MSC Server. The Incoming Call Request contains an indication to inform the
UE to initiate the CS bearer establishment procedure. The Incoming Call
Request also contains a dynamic SCC AS PSI (DN) to enable the SCC AS to later
on correlate the outgoing service control signalling with the incoming CS
bearer control signalling.
Steps 5b -- 10 are for the case of UE assisted T-ADS.
5b. Alternatively, in the case of UE assisted T-ADS the SCC AS performs
initial T-ADS selecting IMS for the service control signalling when UE-B is
registered in the IMS.
6b The SCC AS terminates the session from the A-party and establishes a new
session by sending an INVITE to the B-party via the I/S‑CSCF. The INVITE
contains options that enable UE-B to choose a CS bearer for bidirectional
speech media transport if it determines that this is not supported by serving
PS Access Network. The INVITE also contains a dynamic SCC AS PSI (DN) to
enable the SCC AS to later on correlate the outgoing service control
signalling with the incoming CS bearer control signalling. When the T-ADS
function selects the Gm reference point for service control, the SCC AS
prevents the S‑CSCF from selecting the contact address of the MSC server, and
the S‑CSCF selects the IP-CAN.
7b. The I/S‑CSCF sends the INVITE to B-party.
8-10. In the case where the access network does not support simultaneous PS
and CS, UE-B responds with a Session Progress message and in the event the
\"IMS voice over PS session supported indication\" indicates voice is not
supported as defined in TS 23.401 [34]. UE-B shall indicate in the Session
Progress message that a CS bearer is required for the session and that further
signalling for the session will be via I1. The S‑CSCF forwards the Session
Progress message to the SCC AS.
11\. The ICS UE sends a CS Setup message to the MSC Server using the SCC AS
PSI DN to establish the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path. This will establish
the circuit bearer between the UE and IMS.
12\. The MSC Server responds with a call proceeding message and begins to set
up the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path.
13\. The MSC Server sends an INVITE towards the I/S‑CSCF containing the SCC AS
PSI and an SDP Offer with the media description from the MGW. The MSC Server
adds the User Location Information (e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE Time Zone
Information to the INVITE.
14\. The I/S‑CSCF forwards the INVITE to the SCC AS.
15\. The SCC AS continues the session setup towards the A-party for the
original INVITE in Step 1. The response contains an SDP answer with the media
description from the SDP offer received in Step 13.
16\. The SCC AS completes the set-up of the CS Bearer Signalling Path towards
ICS UE B which involves sending a 200 OK in response to the INVITE in Step 14.
The ICS UE B, the MSC Server and the SCC AS complete the setup of the CS
Bearer Control Signalling Path and the Service Control Signalling Path with UE
A.
17\. UE-B sends a Ringing indication to the SCC AS via I1.
18-19. The SCC AS sends a Ringing message to the remote end.
20\. UE-B sends a Connecting message to the SCC AS via I1.
21-22. The SCC AS sends a 200 OK message to the remote end in response to the
INVITE received at step 2. For video call, to complete the session and bearer
setup, the specific handling as described in clause 7.4.2.2.1 applies.
Figure 7.4.2.2.3-2 provides an example flow for a call destined to an ICS UE
attached to an MSC server where the incoming session is delivered over the I1
reference point and the media is established via the CS network.
Figure 7.4.2.2.3-2: ICS UE Terminations with CS media information flows using
I1 reference point when using an MSC Server
NOTE 3: Steps 1-10, 16 and 18-23 are related to the setup of the Service
Control Signalling Path. Steps 11-15 and 17 are related to the setup of the CS
Bearer Control Signalling Path.
Steps 1-12 in Figure 7.4.2.2.3-2 are identical to steps 1-12 in Figure
7.4.2.2.3-1.
At Steps 13 and 14, the MSC server sends the IAM to an MGCF using the SCC AS
PSI DN which is subsequently inter-worked to an INVITE containing the SCC AS
PSI and an SDP Offer from the MGW.
Steps 15-23 in Figure 7.4.2.2.3-2 are identical to steps 14-22 in Figure
7.4.2.2.3-1.
##### 7.4.2.2.4 Terminations with CS media using CS control with I1
augmentation
Standard CS terminating procedures are used to deliver the incoming session to
the ICS UE as described in Figure 7.4.2.2.3-1 when the ICS UE is attached to
an MSC server enhanced for ICS, and in Figure 7.4.2.2.3-2 when the ICS UE is
attached to an MSC server. Additional IMS parameters can be optionally
communicated to the ICS UE using I1 after the incoming session has been
delivered.
##### 7.4.2.2.5 Terminations with CS media when not using Gm or I1
Figure 7.4.2.1.2-1 provides an example flow for a call destined to an ICS UE
attached to an MSC server enhanced for ICS, where the incoming session is
delivered using standard CS terminating procedures.
If an ICS UE is attached to an MSC server where the incoming session is
delivered to it using standard CS terminating procedures, an example call flow
is shown in Figure 7.4.2.1.3-1.
##### 7.4.2.2.6 Void
##### 7.4.2.2.7 Terminating access network reselection -- fallback to
alternate access
When using the Gm reference point for delivery of the incoming session to the
ICS UE, if it fails to set up the bearer in the selected terminating access
network and other access network(s) is available for the service, the UE may
send a message to the SCC AS indicating the failure of bear setup with the
information required for access network reselection (e.g. the information of
available access network(s)), or indicate a newly selected access network. The
SCC AS can then, based on the message and operator policy, update the relevant
decision information for T-ADS if necessary and reselect a new access network
for bearer setup to complete the terminating session establishment.
Figure 7.4.2.2.7-1 gives an example flow of terminating access reselection for
ICS UE terminating session establishment using Gm reference point.
Figure 7.4.2.2.7-1: Access reselection for ICS UE termination over Gm
reference point
1\. An incoming call arrives at UE B from UE A. T-ADS is executed by the SCC
AS and an access network is chosen for bearer establishment (refer to Steps
1-7a in Figure 7.4.2.2.2-1).
2\. Bearer setup fails in the selected access network.
3\. UE B sends a message to the I/S‑CSCF indicating the failure of bearer
setup. Information required for the SCC AS to re-execute T-ADS and to select a
new access network is provided (e.g. info of access network(s) available for
the service), or a new access network selected by the UE for bearer setup is
indicated.
4\. The I/S‑CSCF forwards the message to the SCC AS based on originating
initial filter criteria.
5\. The SCC AS updates the relevant decision information for T-ADS and re-
executes T-ADS to select a new access network for bearer setup of the session
if no new access network is selected by the UE.
6-7. The SCC AS sends an Invite message to UE B via the S‑CSCF to establish
the session, with the newly selected access network for bearer setup indicated
or confirmed (if selected by the UE).
8\. Bearer setup in the newly selected terminating access network for the
session.
9\. Completion of session setup procedures between UE A and UE B.
### 7.4.3 Terminating sessions over Gm rejected by the UE
Figure 7.4.3-1 provides an example flow for a call destined to a UE-2 and
where the incoming session is delivered over the Gm reference point offering
either PS speech media, CS media, or PS speech media with alternative CS
media, because the SCC AS is unable to accurately determine that the CS domain
should be used, e.g. when ISR according to TS 23.401 [34] is active and if the
UE hasn\'t re-registered in the IMS. In this example call flow the UE-2
rejects the incoming session and T-ADS in the SCC AS selects CS domain for
termination. The flow applies to both ICS UE and non ICS UE.
Figure 7.4.3-1: Terminating session rejected by the UE
1\. The request is received at S‑CSCF following normal IMS session set up
procedures.
2\~3. The service logic with iFC causes the request to be forwarded to the SCC
AS.
4\. The SCC AS anchors the session. T-ADS is executed and the PS access is
selected for termination.
5\~6. The SIP INVITE is forwarded to the UE via the selected PS access. Paging
is triggered if the UE is in Idle state.
7\~8. The UE determines that PS access cannot be used for a session with the
offered media and it returns a response to the IMS indicating the error
condition. The S‑CSCF forwards the message to the SCC AS.
9\. On receiving the response, the SCC AS reattempts the terminating call
establishment directly towards the same UE over CS domain if possible.
10\~11. The SIP INVITE is forwarded to UE-2 via the MSC Server enhanced for
ICS (or via MGCF and MSC if the MSC is not enhanced for ICS).
12\. Terminating CS call establishment.
NOTE: If the UE determines that PS access cannot be used for the media flows
it might be worth providing the caller party with a courtesy tone generated by
the IMS while the termination is being re-attempted.
## **7.5** Service continuity
### 7.5.1 Service continuity for ICS UE
#### 7.5.1.1 Service continuity while maintaining the use of CS access for the
media
##### 7.5.1.1.1 IMS sessions established using Gm reference point
##### 7.5.1.1.1.1 Overview {#overview-7 .H6}
When the CS bearer is used for the media of the IMS session, the Gm reference
point may be used for communication of service control signalling, contingent
upon the VPLMN support of the Gm reference point. A change of access network
due to handover (e.g. as described in TS 23.009 [22] and TS 25.413 [23]), may
result in an inability to use the PS access for the Gm reference point while
the use of CS access for the media of the IMS session is still possible; under
such circumstance, the service continuity is maintained by switching the
signalling transport over to the CS access, e.g. by switching the use of Gm
with the I1 reference point or to not using Gm or I1.
##### 7.5.1.1.1.2 Use of Gm reference point possible after handover {#use-of-
gm-reference-point-possible-after-handover .H6}
Standard Handover procedures, that are specific to different access networks
(e.g. as described in TS 23.009 [22] and TS 25.413 [23]), are used for
handover of the Service Control Signalling Path and the CS Bearer Control
Signalling Path along with the associated circuit bearer to the target access
network.
The use of Gm reference point for Service Control Signalling Path is
maintained upon handover.
##### 7.5.1.1.1.3 Use of Gm reference point not possible after Handover {#use-
of-gm-reference-point-not-possible-after-handover .H6}
Standard CS handover procedures, that are specific to different access
networks (e.g. as described in TS 23.009 [22] and TS 25.413 [23]), are used to
relocate the CS Bearer Control Signalling Path and the associated circuit
bearer to the target access network. Upon completion of the handover of the CS
Bearer Control Signalling Path and the associated circuit bearer to the target
access, the UE sends a handover notification message to the SCC AS to indicate
use of I1 for the Service Control Signalling Path if the I1 reference point is
available in the target access network or to fallback to not using Gm or I1.
After handover, the I1 reference point is used for service control signalling
in networks supporting the I1 reference point; the non ICS UE procedures apply
in networks not supporting the I1 reference point.
##### 7.5.1.1.1.3a Use of Service Control Signalling Path not possible after
Handover {#a-use-of-service-control-signalling-path-not-possible-after-
handover .H6}
##### 7.5.1.1.1.3a.1 MSC Server assisted mid-call feature not used {#a.1-msc-
server-assisted-mid-call-feature-not-used .H6}
If the SCC AS detects that the ICS UE is not reachable over the Service
Control Signalling Path and if the UE or the network does not support the MSC
Server assisted mid-call feature as specified in TS 23.237 [12], the SCC AS
shall:
\- clear any held sessions related to the user and update the remote leg if
necessary; and
\- clear any active session that is a conference initiated by the user and
hosted in the IMS.
NOTE 1: Detecting the loss of the Service Control Signalling Path is an
implementation issue.
NOTE 2: In order to avoid an unintentional release of an ongoing ICS session,
an ICS UE can re-register its Public User Identity with the IMS at a time
chosen to minimize the probability of its IMS registration expiring during an
ongoing ICS session when Gm is not available. To prevent the ICS UE requesting
re-registration with unacceptable frequency, the Registrar in a network
implementing ICS would need to set the IMS registration expiry timer to an
appropriate value.
Figure 7.5.1.1.1.3a-1 is an example call flow of releasing the aforementioned
session at the SCC AS when the SCC AS detects that the ICS UE is not reachable
over Service Control Signalling Path and the UE or the network does not
support the MSC Server assisted mid-call feature as specified in TS 23.237
[12].
Figure 7.5.1.1.1.3a-1: release of held sessions at SCC AS when Service Control
Signalling Path unavailable
1\. The SCC AS detects that the ICS UE is not reachable over Service Control
Signalling Path.
2\. The SCC AS releases the held session between UE A and UE C and/or the
active session that is a conference initiated by UE A and hosted in the IMS.
3\. The SCC AS sends the UPDATE to the S‑CSCF.
4\. The S‑CSCF forwards the UPDATE to the UE B to update the remote leg.

between PS and CS access
See TS 23.237 [12] IMS Service Continuity.
## 7.5a Addition of Gm service control to existing call
### 7.5a.1 Overview
A call can be established by an ICS UE that supports Gm, but without using the
Gm reference point (for example, as a result of CSFB, or when in non-DTM GERAN
coverage). If Gm is available after call establishment, or becomes available
(for example, as a result of a change of access network due to handover), no
mid-call services are applicable to the call, and the call is anchored in the
SCC AS as described in clause 7.3.2.1 or 7.4.2.1, the UE may augment the
ongoing CS call in order to be able to use Gm for service control signalling.
If the UE does augment the ongoing CS call with Gm service control signalling
then the UE shall use Gm when establishing additional calls, or for any mid-
call signalling. The UE shall continue to use Gm procedures until the existing
calls end.
If the UE does not augment the ongoing CS call with Gm service control
signalling then the UE shall use CS procedures when establishing additional
calls, or for any mid-call signalling. The UE shall continue to use CS
procedures until the existing calls end.
### 7.5a.2 Augmentation call flow
If configured to do so the ICS UE may invoke IMS signalling to add Gm service
control to the ongoing session.
Figure 7.5a.2-1: Augmentation with Gm
1\. When the UE determines a need to augment a CS call with Gm, the UE
initiates registration with IMS via the new PS access (if not already
registered). It initiates the augmentation by sending an INVITE to establish
the service control signalling via the PS access. The INVITE includes the SDP
for speech or speech and video and non-real-time media flow(s) and the static
(provisioned) STI, as defined in TS 23.237 [12].
2\. Standard procedures are used at S-CSCF for routing of the INVITE to the
SCC AS.
3\. The SCC AS identifies the session to be augmented using the STI. If the
INVITE request contains additional PS media the SCC AS also performs the
Remote Leg Update to update the combined session towards the Remote Leg.
## 7.6 Consistency of Supplementary Services
### 7.6.0 General
The applicability of Supplementary Services to the different media types that
apply for ICS (as defined in clause 22.4 of TS 22.101 [9]) are specified in
Annex A of TS 22.004 [41].
### 7.6.1 Supplementary Services for ICS UE
#### 7.6.1.1 Overview
When the IP-CAN is used for the media of the IMS session, IMS procedures as
defined in TS 24.173 [8] apply for IMS services.
When the CS bearer is used for the media of the IMS session, the Gm or the I1
reference point is used for communication of service control signalling; IMS
services are provided to the ICS UE with the IUA of the SCC AS combining the
service control signalling with the description of the CS bearer for execution
of service control over the Remote Leg.
#### 7.6.1.2 IMS sessions using CS bearer
##### 7.6.1.2.1 Overview
When the CS bearer is used for the media of the IMS Multimedia Telephony
service, see TS 22.173 [4], the procedures specified in this clause apply.
##### 7.6.1.2.2 Use of Gm reference point
##### 7.6.1.2.2.1 Line ID Services (OIP, OIR, TIP, TIR) {#line-id-services-
oip-oir-tip-tir .H6}
IMS procedures as defined in TS 24.173 [8] apply with the SCC AS combining the
description of the CS bearer with the service control signalling communicated
over the Gm reference point as specified in clause 7.1.
##### 7.6.1.2.2.2 Communication Diversion Services {#communication-diversion-
services .H6}
IMS procedures as defined in TS 24.173 [8] apply with the IUA of the SCC AS
combining the description of the CS bearer with the service control signalling
communicated over the Gm reference point as specified in clause 7.1.
##### 7.6.1.2.2.3 Communication Barring {#communication-barring .H6}
IMS procedures as defined in TS 24.173 [8] apply with the SCC AS combining the
description of the CS bearer with the service control signalling communicated
over the Gm reference point as specified in clause 7.1.
##### 7.6.1.2.2.4 Communication Hold/Resume {#communication-holdresume .H6}
IMS procedures as defined in TS 24.173 [8] apply with the SCC AS combining the
description of the CS bearer with the service control signalling communicated
over the Gm reference point as specified in clause 7.1.
Additionally, the SCC AS may employ an MRF for control of media as needed for
execution of the Communication Hold/Resume.
NOTE 1: Annex E describes several implementation options on how to process
media using MRF.
During communication hold, if a held session is resumed with the same service
type/bearer requirement (i.e. voice or video) as the existing CS bearer, the
CS bearer shall be reused; otherwise, the CS bearer shall be updated if
possible through SCUDIF or redial mechanism (refer to clause 7.9).
Figure 7.6.1.2.2.4-1 provides the ICS Communication Hold/Resume flow over Gm

# 8 Charging
## 8.1 General description
The charging strategy applied in ICS shall ensure complete and correct
charging of the access leg that is used for an ICS call. An ICS subscriber may
establish or accept a call through CS access or through an IP access network
(IP-CAN). The charge that is levied against an ICS subscriber for a call shall
encompass the usage of the access network (CS access or IP-CAN) as well as the
usage of the IMS network, further depending on the destination of the call and
other call related aspects. The access related charge for an ICS call, i.e.
the CS access network related charge or IP-CAN related charge, shall be
included in the charging record generated by SCC AS.
The charge of a SIP call or session may be adapted when this call or session
is subject to a value added service (e.g. number translation, call diversion)
or is subject to a supplementary service (e.g. call forwarding, call transfer,
conference call).
Standard inter-operator reconciliation mechanisms for CS and IMS can and
should be used. Additional reconciliation for I1 flows can also be applied,
due to such flows being uniquely identifiable from other flows over the same
bearer (see clause 5.4.1 for more information).
## 8.2 Offline charging
Charging record generated by the SCC AS may be correlated with charging
records generated in the MSC Server or with charging records in the IP-CAN,
where applicable. The combination of charging records from SCC AS with
charging records from MSC Server or IP-CAN is used for determining access
charge for the call or multimedia session. The combination of these charging
records may further be correlated with other IMS-based charging records
generated by S‑CSCF or other functional entities in the IMS network, for the
purpose of generating an overall charge for a call or multimedia session,
including access related charge.
Where PS to CS transfer has occurred, at least in roaming situations, the
visited network shall correlate the charging records from MSC Server and any
visited network IMS functions. The information used for correlation is
described in TS 23.237 [12].
## 8.3 On-line charging
When on-line charging is applied for an ICS subscriber, this on-line charging
should be performed strictly in IMS. CS network based on-line charging service
(e.g., CAMEL prepaid), for example, shall not be invoked for ICS subscribers.
NOTE: If for an ICS subscriber a call that is established in CS is not
anchored in IMS network, i.e. no ICS is applied for that call, then on-line
charging in CS access can be applied for that call.
# 9 Security Considerations
## 9.1 Access security
ICS re-uses the CS domain security described in the detailed access specific
specification.
Access using MSC Server enhanced for ICS is secured by the combination of the
CS access security and the IMS Network Domain Security. The MSC Server
enhanced for ICS also performs the trusted node authentication procedures
according to TS 33.203 [32].
## 9.2 Network Domain Security
Network domain security with the MSC server enhanced for ICS shall be provided
by NDS/IP according to TS 33.210 [33] for the I2 reference point.
NOTE: If the control plane interfaces are trusted (e.g. physically protected),
there is no need to use protection according to TS 33.210 [33].
###### ## Annex A (informative): Service Consistency
IMS Centralized Services (ICS) provides **communication services such that all
services, and service control, are based on IMS mechanisms and enablers. It
enables IMS services when using CS access for the media bearer**.
With ICS, the user services are provided by IMS. User sessions are controlled
in IMS via PS or CS access. When using CS access network, or when using PS
access networks which do not support full duplex speech component of an IMS
service, the CS core network is utilized to establish a circuit bearer for use
as media for IMS sessions.
Functionality is needed to provide IMS Centralized Services to devices using a
circuit switched access network for media transport. Two fundamentally
different approaches are enabled in this specification. One approach supports
legacy UEs by placing new functional elements in the MSC Server. Another
approach provides new functionality in the UE. The following figure depicts
the provision of IMS Centralized Services for these approaches from the
user\'s perspective. This figure is intended to be illustrative in nature, and
is not intended to depict a complete or definitive identification of the
various IMS Centralized Services that may be provided using different access
networks or solutions.

###### ## Annex B (informative): ICS functions in different deployment
scenarios
The following tables provides guidance on which of the functions and
functionalities are needed in the different deployment scenarios.
**Scenario 1** : An operator who only supports UEs that have ICS functionality
for their ICS Users:
             MSC Server with ICS   ICS UE   Transparent control channel                       SCC AS
* * *
             enhancements                   I1                                                Gm                                                CAA                            IUA   T-ADS
Required No Yes As driven by operator policy and VPLMN support. As driven by
operator policy and VPLMN support. Yes, only if I1 is supported Yes Yes
ICS Users using a non-ICS UE (e.g. after SIM swap) will not make use of the
transparent control channel; non ICS UE originated calls are routed to the
home IMS using IN (e.g. CAMEL) signalling in conjunction with CS signalling
(e.g. TS 24.008 [6]) for call origination.
**Scenario 2** : An operator who only supports non ICS UEs for their ICS
Users:
             MSC Server with ICS   ICS UE   Transparent control channel   SCC AS
* * *
             enhancements                   I1                            Gm       CAA   IUA             T-ADS
Required Yes No No No No Conditional* Yes
* Required if the operator supports IN (e.g. CAMEL) redirection of CS originated calls.
**Scenario 3** : An operator who supports UE\'s for their ICS Users that do,
and do not, have ICS functionality (to different subscribers and the same
subscribers) ensuring the coexistence of UEs that have and do not have ICS
functionality:

* * *
             enhancements                   I1                                                Gm                                                CAA                       IUA   T-ADS
Required Yes Yes As driven by operator policy and VPLMN support. As driven by
operator policy and VPLMN support. Yes, if I1 is supported Yes Yes
**Scenario 4: Inbound roaming - operator supports ICS**
Inbound roaming subscribers on an operator\'s network that supports either the
same or different ICS functionality that the inbound roaming subscriber is
using, ensuring the coexistence of UEs that have and do not have ICS
functionality.
**Sub case 4.1** : Subscriber from operator supporting scenario 1 roams into
network of scenario 1
Same functions and functionalities in roaming in-network as in scenario 1\. No
additional functions or functionalities.
**Sub case 4.2** : Subscriber from operator supporting scenario 2 roams into
network of scenario 2
Same functions and functionalities in roaming in-network as in scenario 2\. No
additional functions or functionalities.
**Sub case 4.3** : Subscriber from operator supporting scenario 1 roams into
network of scenario 2
Same functions and functionalities in roaming in-network as in scenario 2\. No
additional functions or functionalities. Roaming agreement, operator policy
and access network restrictions decide on the use of the transparent control
channel between ICS UE and SCC AS in the home network.
ICS Users using a non-ICS UE (e.g. after SIM swap) will not make use of the
transparent control channel; non ICS UE originated calls are routed to the
home IMS using IN (e.g. CAMEL) signalling in conjunction with CS signalling
(e.g. TS 24.008 [6]) for call origination.
**Sub case 4.4** : Subscriber from operator supporting scenario 2 roams into
network of scenario 1
Same functions and functionalities in roaming in-network as in scenario 1: No
additional functions or functionalities. Roaming agreement and operator policy
decide on the fallback solution, i.e., whether or not originated calls are
routed to the home IMS using IN (e.g. CAMEL) signalling in conjunction with CS
signalling (e.g. TS 24.008 [6]) for call origination.
**Scenario 5: Inbound roaming - operator does not support ICS**
Inbound roaming subscribers on an operator\'s network that does not support
ICS.
**Sub case 5.1** : Subscriber from operator supporting scenario 1 roams into
an operator\'s network that does not support ICS.
Roaming agreement, operator policy and access network restrictions decide on
the use of the transparent control channel between ICS UE and SCC AS in the
home network.
ICS Users using a non-ICS UE (e.g. after SIM swap) will not make use of the
transparent control channel; non ICS UE originated calls are routed to the
home IMS using IN (e.g. CAMEL) signalling in conjunction with CS signalling
(e.g. TS 24.008 [6]) for call origination.
**Sub case 5.2** Subscriber from operator supporting scenario 2 roams into an
operator\'s network that does not support ICS.
Roaming agreement and operator policy decide on the fallback solution, i.e.,
whether or not originated calls are routed to the home IMS using IN (e.g.
CAMEL) signalling in conjunction with CS signalling (e.g. TS 24.008 [6]) for
call origination.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Communication Deflection support when call
has been delivered using CS call control
When a call has been delivered to a non ICS UE using CS call control,
Communication Deflection service can be centralized and executed in IMS by
using IN (e.g. O-CSI CAMEL) if it is supported by the network and user
subscription.
###### ## Annex D (informative): Conditional Call Forwarding support when call
has been delivered using CS call control
When a call has been delivered to an UE using CS call control, conditional
call forwarding services can be centralized and executed in IMS by one of (or
a combination of) the following implementation options.
**Solution 1: Default PSIs**
In this solution, Conditional CF is configured in IMS with default service
configuration in the CS domain. The Conditional CF services are configured in
the HLR. The different forwarded number can be set in HLR to indicate the type
of CF. The VMSC redirects the call to IMS for appropriate handling of the
service in IMS.
**Solution 2: MAP suppression-of-announcements**
In this solution, Conditional CF is configured and provisioned in IMS domain
exclusively, according to IMS Centralized Service principle. It provides means
to suppress the announcement in CS domain at the MSC for the conditional call
forwarding services. MGCF provides the appropriate responses to TAS on behalf
of the ICS user in CS domain. The MGCF can use the ICS indication if available
to map cause codes received over the CS leg to appropriate IMS error codes.
For support of CFNRy, the TAS starts a supervisory no-reply timer on receipt
of Alerting from the called party. If the timer expires without receipt of the
Connect from the called party, the TAS invokes the CFNRy service.
**Solution 3: IN**
In this solution, Conditional CF is configured in IMS with default service
configuration in the CS domain so that the VMSC invokes the CF service in the
CS domain upon detection of CF triggers. IN (e.g. O-CSI CAMEL service) is
configured in the HLR to redirect service control to IMS for processing of CF.
###### ## Annex E (informative): Using MRF for media process
After the session between ICS UE and other party ( Party B) is hold, if the
SCC AS receives the new session request, it can use MRF for media process. The
following three options give details on how to implement it.
**Solution 1: using MRFP by SCC AS for held party**
In this solution, if the SCC AS receives the new session request after the
session between ICS UE and other party (Party B) is hold, it changes the MGW
media path from Party B to the third party (Party C), and connects Party B to
MRF for playing announcement.
**Solution 2: using MRFP by SCC AS for active and Held party**
In this solution, if the SCC AS receives the new session request after the
session between ICS UE and other party (Party B) is hold, it changes the MGW
media path to MRF, and then connects Party B to MRF for playing announcement
and connects the third party (Party C) to MRF to communicate with ICS UE.
**Solution 3: using MRFP by TAS for Held call**
In this solution, TAS is always kept in ICS UE A\'s remote leg. After the TAS
receives the Hold request from the ICS UE via the SCC AS, it performs
communication Hold procedure as described in TS 24.147 [21]. The MRF is
connected to Party B for playing announcement.
###### ## Annex F (informative): Call diversion from CS to IMS
# F.1 General
An incoming call for a subscriber with a service provided by the IMS (e.g.
ICS, SC, SR-VCC) can be received either through the CS domain or IMS. For such
a subscriber, certain calls that are received through the CS domain need to be
routed to the IMS for anchoring at the SCC AS, prior to the onward routing of
the call to the subscriber. Solutions for this are discussed in clause F.2.
NOTE: Requirements and preconditions for anchoring of CS calls for a
subscriber with a service provided by the IMS are documented in clause 7.4 of
the present document.
When an incoming CS call is anchored at the SCC AS using certain
implementation options described in clause F.2, then as a result of domain
selection, the call can be routed back to the CS domain to determine the CSRN
for CS termination. In this case, the call can be treated as a new incoming
call from the CS network, and then be re-routed to the IMS for anchoring
again, thus creating a circular loop. Solutions for this are discussed in
clause F.3.
# F.2 Implementation options for call diversion from CS to the IMS
Several techniques available in the current CS networks can be used to
implement the call diversion from CS to IMS, as detailed below:
**1 Use of CAMEL for call diversion to IMS**
This option applies to configurations requiring handling of incoming calls at
the GMSC function. Upon receipt of an incoming call, the GMSC queries the HSS
for routing information via the Send Routing Information (SRI) query. The user
profile in the HSS is configured to return T-CSI including a gsmSCF address to
the GMSC in response to the SRI query. When handling calls for a subscriber
with a service provided by the IMS, the subsequent processing at the gsmSCF
and the GMSC results in routing of the call to the IMS using the IMRN. The
call is routed to the SCC AS according to standard IMS routing procedures. In
order to determine the necessary information to complete the call, the SCC AS
uses the IMRN or the ISUP information mapped to SIP headers.
**2 HSS directed call diversion to IMS**
This option also applies to configurations requiring handling of incoming
calls at the GMSC function. Upon receipt of an incoming call, the GMSC queries
the HSS for routing information using the MAP Send Routing Information (SRI)
procedure (as defined in TS 29.002 [45]). Based on a non-standardized
mechanism, the user profile in the HSS is configured to return an IP
Multimedia Routing Number (IMRN) to the GMSC in response to the SRI query,
when the call is directed to a subscriber with a service provided by the IMS.
The subsequent processing at the GMSC results in routing of the call to IMS
using the IMRN. Two methods can then be used to ensure correlation between the
IMRN and the original called party.
a. Cooperative allocation/deallocation: In this method, the IMS is made aware
of the assigned IMRN and when a call is received for that number, the original
number is retrieved. This method is similar to the Provide Roaming Number
procedure in MAP (see TS 29.002 [45]).
b. Algorithmic: In this method, a known algorithm is used to derive the IMRN
at the CS, and to deduce the original called number from the IMRN at the IMS.
One method of performing such an algorithm could be use of a prefix. In such a
case, care is required in the network configuration to avoid call looping for
the case when the call is subsequently routed from the IMS to the CS domain
for call termination (see clause F.3 for possible solutions to prevent call
looping).
**3 Static diversion from GMSC with dedicated trunk groups**
This option also applies to configurations requiring handling of incoming
calls at the GMSC function. Dedicated trunk groups can be used at the GMSC to
divert CS terminations to the MGCF.
NOTE 1: The handling of call types that an operator has not centralised the
services into the IMS need to be taken into account if this solution is
chosen.
**4 Static diversion using Local Number Portability**
This option can be used for routing of calls originating in PSTN networks to
IMS. A Local Number Portability database dip can be used to reroute incoming
calls to a subscriber with a service provided by the IMS with calls to the
MGCF.
NOTE 2: The handling of calls other than calls needs to be taken into account
if this solution is chosen.
**5 Direct routing to IMS**
Translations can be set up in the PSTN network to route the incoming call to a
subscriber with a service provided by the IMS to the MGCF. This way the normal
IMS routing technique specified in TS 23.228 [2] can be used.
NOTE 3: The handling of call types that an operator has not centralised the
services into the IMS need to be taken into account if this solution is
chosen.
NOTE 4: With some of the aforementioned options, care must be taken to avoid a
circular loop which can occur when used in conjunction with certain techniques
applied to route the call from IMS to the terminating user via CS network.
Techniques for the prevention of circular looping are described in clause F.3.
# F.3 Implementation options for prevention of circular looping of CS
Terminations
Several implementation techniques can be used to avoid circular looping, as
detailed below:
**1 Use of SCC AS for retrieving the CSRN**
When the SCC AS decides that the call is to be terminated in the CS domain,
the SCC AS retrieves the CSRN from the MSC/MSC-Server via the HSS using the
following method:
a. MAP SRI Query: This option makes use of a MAP Interface between the SCC AS
and the HSS to request allocation of a CSRN from the HSS for routing of the
call to the MSC/MSC-Server currently serving the subscriber.
b. Sh UDR Query: This option makes use of the Sh interface between the SCC AS
and the HSS. The SCC AS sends a Sh UDR query to the HSS to request allocation
of a CSRN for routing of the call to the MSC/MSC-Server currently serving the
subscriber.
**2 Use of a specific CSRN to indicate the anchored call**
When the SCC AS decides that the call is to be terminated in the CS domain,
the SCC AS allocates a specific CSRN. The specific CSRN can be an MSISDN with
added prefix digits. The SCC AS uses the specific CSRN to route the call to
the CS network. The following options are available to resolve the MSISDN of
original called party from the CSRN.
a. MGCF resolution: In this option, the SCC AS forwards the call to the MGCF
(which has a GMSC function). The specific CSRN is used by the MGCF to
recognise that the SCC AS has already anchored the call in IMS, and that the
call will be terminated in the CS domain. The MGCF resolves the MSISDN from
the CSRN and invokes GMSC functionality integrated in the MGCF for handling
the CS call terminating procedure. In particular, the MGCF/GMSC includes the
\"Suppress T-CSI\" parameter in the MAP SRI sent to the HSS.
b. GMSC resolution: In this option, the SCC AS forwards the call to the MGCF,
which then forwards the call on to GSMC. The specific CSRN is used by the GSMC
to recognise that the SCC AS has already anchored the call in IMS, and that
the call will be terminated in the CS domain. The GMSC resolves the MSISDN
from the CSRN and invokes the CS call terminating procedure. In particular,
the GMSC includes the \"Suppress T CSI\" parameter in the MAP SRI sent to the
HSS.
c HSS resolution: In this option, the SCC AS forwards the call to the GMSC.
The GMSC treats the call as a normal terminating call and sends a MAP SRI
request to the HSS for the specific CSRN. The specific CSRN is used by the HSS
to recognise that the SCC AS has already anchored the call in IMS, and that
the call will be terminated in the CS domain. The HSS resolves the MSISDN from
the CSRN and uses CS call terminating procedures to obtain routing information
from the MSC/MSC-Server.
**3 Use of a dynamically allocated CSRN to route via the GMSC**
This option uses a dynamically allocated CSRN to divert the call to the
appropriate GMSC as described below:
\- The SCC AS allocates a CSRN that maps to an appropriate GMSC. Standard CS
termination procedures are then executed at the GMSC.
\- The GMSC is configured with N-CSI and criteria corresponding to the CSRN.
This causes the GMSC to issue an InitialDP containing the CSRN to the gsmSCF.
\- The gsmSCF performs a function on the CSRN to obtain the MSISDN of the
called party number and the MSISDN is returned to the GMSC in a CONNECT
operation together with the CSRN as a Re-direction ID.
\- The GMSC continues the normal CS call termination procedure by issuing an
SRI to the HSS using the MSISDN, which causes T-CSI to be returned back to the
GMSC.
\- The GMSC issues another InitialDP containing both MSISDN and CSRN to the
gsmSCF. The gsmSCF recognises that it has been triggered for the second time
(due to the presence of the CSRN) and therefore returns a CONTINUE for the
MSISDN, thus avoiding a circular loop.
\- The GMSC sends a MAP SRI query to the HSS with the \"Suppress T CSI\"
parameter, thus allowing the HSS to obtain the MSRN through standard call
terminating procedures.
###### ## Annex G (normative): Combined CS Access Authentication and IMS
Registration Procedure for non-roaming UEs
# G.1 General
An MSC enhanced for ICS may support the Combined CS Access Authentication
procedure. This procedure enables to authenticate and register all users
accessing a network via CS access within the IMS domain as the only service
domain. When this is done this annex is used instead of clause 7.2.1.1.
If the MSC enhanced for ICS supports the Combined CS Access Authentication all
users within this MSC domain shall be authenticated utilizing this procedure.
The main additional function of MSC Server enhanced for ICS is:
\- Receiving 3G CS authentication parameters from the S-CSCF.
Other functions are similar with the existing MSC Server enhanced for ICS,
e.g. Controls the MGW functions described in TS 23.002 [3] to enable the
interworking between CS access and RTP bearers.
In this solution, the IMS will perform authentication procedure as normal IMS
registration.
# G.2 Procedure for registration utilizing IMS Authorization
Figure G.2-1 describes how IMS registration is performed by the MSC Server
upon receiving of a Location Update Request.
Figure G.2-1: Procedure for registration utilizing IMS Authorization
1\. The UE sends a Location Update Request towards CS network.
2-3. Upon receipt of location update request, MSC Server enhanced for ICS
performs standard identity request if needed.
4\. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS decides to initiate IMS registration for
this subscriber and derives a domain name from the subscriber\'s identity
(e.g. IMSI) and discovers the address of the appropriate I-CSCF/IBCF.
5-7. The I-CSCF verifies that the incoming REGISTER origins from a trusted MSC
Server (in the same way it would check that a normal REGISTER origins from a
trusted P-CSCF). The I-CSCF compares the MNC/MCC in the IMPI/IMPU to detect
whether the UE is an inbound roamer or not. For HPLMN subscribers the I-CSCF
selects the HSS and for inbound roamers follows the procedure in Annex H,
clause H.5.2.3.1.
For HPLMN SeDoC subscribers, the I-CSCF indicates to the HSS that the REGISTER
is coming from an MSC and the HSS selects the appropriate S-CSCF which is able
to handle the CS authentication. The I‑CSCF initiates standard procedures for
S‑CSCF location/allocation and forwards the REGISTER to S-CSCF.
8-9. The S-CSCF identifies the REGISTER as being from the MSC Server enhanced
for ICS.
During these procedures, authentication parameters for a given subscriber will
be carried. The parameters contain an Authentication Quintuplet (Rand, Xres,
Ck, Ik, Autn).
10-11. The S‑CSCF sends a SIP 401 i.e. an authentication challenge towards the
UE including the challenge RAND, the authentication token AUTN, and also the
integrity key IK and the cipher key CK to MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
12\. Upon receipt of 401 from IMS, MSC Server enhanced for ICS initiates the
authentication procedure by transferring an AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message
across the radio interface. The AUTHENTICATION REQUEST message contains the
parameters necessary to calculate the response parameters.
13\. The UE processes the challenge information and sends back an
AUTHENTICATION RESPONSE message to the network.
14\. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS should send REGISTER with authentication
result (XRES) to I-CSCF.
15-21. I‑CSCF forwards the authentication response to the S‑CSCF. Upon
receiving the message, the S‑CSCF check the authentication response sent by
the UE. If the user has been successfully authenticated, the S‑CSCF sends 200
OK to MSC Server enhanced for ICS via I-CSCF.
22\. On receiving a 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS generates a TMSI for the UE and sends Location Update Accept
towards the UE.
###### ## Annex H (informative): Service Domain Centralization in IMS (SeDoC)
# H.1 High level description and principles
This annex describes an optional architecture configuration that centralizes
all services, including emergency calls and SMS, within the IMS domain for all
users roaming in that network independent of access used, i.e. it replaces
service execution of the CS service domain with service logic execution in IMS
only. The service profile for all users is soley provided by the IMS domain.
For inbound roamers not supporting IMS or ICS in HPLMN therefore a temporary
IMS subscription is created and service is handled locally in the VPLMN.
The architecture configuration utilizes the \"Registration and Authentication
procedure utilizing IMS Authorization\", which enables the option to remove
subscriber related data from the VLR and use data of the IMS domain instead,
e.g. the HSS. An interworking function provides the support for inbound and
outbound roaming in networks not supporting IMS or ICS.
This architecture configuration has no impact to UEs, no impact to
interconnection interfaces of the roaming partner, no impact access networks
(e.g. CS access) and does not require changes of specifications (e.g. TS
24.008 [6]).
The basic principles of this solution are that CS access is mapped to IMS and
PS access uses \"native\" IMS (VoLTE) but there is a single service domain for
both accesses in IMS. The user profile is solely provided by IMS domain. For
the migration phase the SeDoC enabled network operator is required to provide
legacy support for inbound roamers. Long term target is that the service for
inbound roamer be provided by the HPLMN, i.e. the VPLMN IMS-GWs (IBCFs) would
relay towards home IMS service infrastructure.
# H.2 Architecture model and reference points
## H.2.1 Reference architecture
The basic principles described in previous clause require the introduction of
a CS access to IMS gateway function, i.e. the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC
and an interworking function (ICS IWF) to the reference architecture. The MSC
Server enhanced for SeDoC maps GSM access procedures to IMS procedures but
does not store user profile data, i.e. the VLR functionality is extracted and
is placed for own users into the HSS and for inbound roamer into an ICS-IWF.
By doing this the internal IMS architecture does not need to introduce new
interfaces.
Figure H.2-1: Reference architecture
NOTE: Does only show the principle architecture, i.e. it does not show all
interfaces.
## H.2.2 Functional Entities
### H.2.2.1 MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC
The MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC terminates CS Access and maps it to
respective IMS procedures.
NOTE: When only a single profile in the IMS is used for service definition
then a MSC Server enhanced for ICS (as defined in clause 7.6.2.9.3) is not
used, instead a MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC is used in its place.
At high level the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC performs the following
functionality on the control plane:
\- towards the UE:
\- terminates the A (GERAN) and Iu-cs interfaces (UTRAN) when the UE accesses
via a CS RAT.
\- towards the IP Multimedia Subsystem:
\- Terminates the I2\' interface to the x-CSCF.
\- Terminates I3 to the Telephony Application Server.
\- towards legacy networks:
\- terminates the G and E interface towards MSC Servers.
\- terminates ISUP signalling towards PSTN.
On the media plane the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC controls Mc to the Media
gateway.
#### H.2.2.1.1 Main differences to MSC Server enhanced for ICS
The MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC is based on the MSC Server enhanced for ICS,
associated MGW as defined in clause 5.3.3 of this specification, TS 23.216
[36] and TS 23.237 [12] with the following amendments.
#### H.2.2.1.2 Call control solely done in IMS
Call Control (CC) functionality is essentially required only for the A/Iu-cs
side of the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC. Some local call control i.e.to
treat \"non UE detected emergency call\" (Germany: 110) as emergency call and.
route to E-CSCF is required. Remaining Call Control functionality is done by
IMS in the same way as for PS calls. Therefore the MSC Server enhanced for
SeDoC behaves as P-CSCF/ATCF from viewpoint of I/S/E-CSCF, SCC-AS and MSC.
Radio Resource Management (RR) and Mobility Management (MM) remain unchanged.
#### H.2.2.1.3 No VLR functionality
MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC does not include VLR functionality, i.e. there
is also no D-Interface to the HLR. User Service Profile data and user service
profile (i.e. identity, supplementary services) are handled in the IMS domain
only. MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC just need to store user data related to
radio access and RR/MM/CC procedures (e.g. IMSI, IMEI, TMSI, etc.).
#### H.2.2.1.4 Mapping of CS procedures to IMS procedures
The MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC terminates CS Access and maps it to
respective IMS procedures.
#### H.2.2.1.5 Call Control procedures
Call Control procedures from the mobile CS user interface (A, Iu) are mapped
towards IMS interface, i.e. I2 (SIP) towards IMS core in order to support the
mapping of:
\- MOC & MTC based on A/Iu to respective IMS procedures
\- SMS-MO & SMS-MT based on A/Iu to respective IMS/IP-SM procedures
#### H.2.2.1.6 Supplementary Services Management procedures
Supplementary Services Management procedures from the mobile CS user interface
(A, Iu) are mapped towards IMS interfaces, i.e. I3-IF (Ut, XCAP) towards IMS
MMTEL AS.
#### H.2.2.1.7 Mapping of IMS procedures to CS procedures
IMS specific procedures that need to be mapped to appropriate GSM procedures
are:
\- early media (uni/bi-directional through-connect of media path).
\- multiple early dialogues (due to forking on remote side (e.g. MSIM
scenario):
\- i.e. MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC serving the originating user needs to
map multiple early SIP dialogues to one GSM dialogue towards the GSM device.
SRVCC is supported as specified for GSM MSC (TS 23.216 [36]), i.e. via Sv
Interface to MME and via I2 Interface to ATCF. Reverse SRVCC is supported as
specified for GSM MSC (TS 23.216 [36]).
CSFB support for Voice and SMS over SGs interface to MME, in case of combined
attach to EPC and CS (via SGs), the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC needs to
interact with the IMS core similar as for CS attached voice terminals (e.g.
map Location Update to IMS Registration, etc.)
#### H.2.2.1.8 Procedures which can be handled without IMS interaction
Various MSC-Server procedures which can be handled without IMS interaction
remain within the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC. This includes e.g. handover
to/from other MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC or VMSC (original MSC Server
enhanced for SeDoC remains anchor after handover).
#### H.2.2.1.9 SMS support considerations
In order to properly support SMS a SIP based replacement for MAP based SMS
alerting procedures (reachability check) is needed, i.e. to set \"not
reachable\" flag in case of unsuccessful SMS-MT and re-register if user is
reachable again.
Upon unsuccessful SMS-MT delivery (no response from terminal) the MSC Server
enhanced for SeDoC needs to activate a \"Not Reachable\" (NR) flag (similar to
GSM MSC). In case of \"NR flag = TRUE\" and receipt of any message from the
terminal, the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC needs to re-register towards IMS-
Core.
In case of unsuccessful SMS-MT to an attached user, the IP-SM-GW shall not
initiate supervision in packet core network (Sh request to HSS).
After unsuccessful SMS-MT delivery, the IP-SM-GW sets a \"Not Reachable\"
flag. Due to this flag a re-registration (and other messages received from the
terminal) will trigger the standard retry mechanisms.
#### H.2.2.1.10 Location
MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC provides with PANI header the network provided
location information according to cell-id received from radio access network
(RAN). This information may be used by applications to differentiate between
2/3G Access via MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC and 4G Access via P-CSCF.
#### H.2.2.1.11 CS Data support
CS Data is used analogously to a voice call: A data terminal equipment (modem)
establishes a connection to another terminal (modem). The connection setup is
controlled by the IMS Core, the data stream can be transported transparently
with already available codecs (e.g., \"clear mode\"/G7.11).
### H.2.2.2 ICS Interworking Function
The ICS interworking function is introduced in order to support inbound and
outbound roamers in networks that do not support IMS or ICS. Detailed in
clause H.5.2.2.
## H.2.3 Reference points
### H.2.3.1 Reference Point MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC - CSCF (I2\'
Reference Point)
The I2\' reference point is based on I2 functionality as defined in TS 23.216
[36], TS 23.237 [12] and in clause 5.4.2.
Additionally it supports the \"Registration and Authentication procedure
utilizing IMS Authorization\" as specified in annex G.
### H.2.3.2 Reference Point MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC - TAS (I3 Reference
Point)
The I3 is used between the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC and the TAS to
interwork CS signalling and communication service setting procedures, as
defined in clause 4.5 of this specification.
### H.2.3.3 Reference Point ICS-IWF - CSCF (Cx\' Reference Point)
The Cx\' reference point is based on Cx functionality similar to the
procedures of S-CSCF - HSS communication. It supports information transfer
between CSCF and ICS-IWF.
The main procedures that require information transfer between CSCF and ICS-IWF
are:
1) Procedures related to Serving CSCF assignment
2) Procedures related to routing information retrieval from ICS-IWF to CSCF
3) Procedures related to authorisation (e.g. checking of roaming agreement)
4) Procedures related to authentication: transfer of security parameters of
the subscriber between ICS-IWF and CSCF
5) Procedures related to filter control: transfer of filter parameters of the
subscriber from ICS-IWF to CSCF
Further information on the Cx reference point is provided in TS 23.228 [2].
### H.2.3.4 Reference Point ICS-IWF - AS (Sh\' Reference Point)
The Sh\' reference point is based on Sh functionality similar to the
procedures of AS - HSS communication. It supports information transfer between
AS and HSS.

Figure H.4.4-1 SMS-MO for own users not roaming
1) UE submits the standard CS Short Message (as described in TS 23.040 [50]and
TS 24.011 [53]) to the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC.
2) MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC encapsulates the Short Message (SMS-SUBMIT,
SC Address) and submits it to the S-CSCF using an appropriate SIP method (as
described in TS 23.204 [51]and TS 24.341 [52]).
3) S-CSCF forwards the encapsulated Short Message (SMS- SUBMIT, SC Address) to
IP-SM-GW (AS) based on stored iFC.
4) IP-SM-GW (AS) acknowledges the SIP message.
5) SIP message acknowledge is forwarded by S-CSCF to MSC Server enhanced for
SeDoC.
6) The IP-SM-GW performs service authorization based on the stored subscriber
data. The IP SM GW checks whether the subscriber is authorised to use the
short message service. The IP-SM-GW (AS) extracts the Short Message (SMS-
SUBMIT) and forwards it towards the SMS-SC (SC Address) using standard MAP or
Diameter based (SGd/Gdd) signalling (as described in TS 23.040 [50]).
7) The SMS-SC sends a Submit report (SMS-SUBMIT REPORT) to IP-SM-GW (AS) (see
TS 23.040 [50]).
8) IP-SM-GW (AS) sends the Submit report to S-CSCF, encapsulated in an
appropriate SIP request.
9) The S-CSCF sends the encapsulated Submit report to the MSC Server enhanced
for SeDoC.
10) MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC sends the Submit report to the UE.
11) The MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC acknowledges the SIP request.
12) The S-CSCF acknowledges the SIP request.
# H.5 Interworking with networks not supporting IMS and/or ICS
## H.5.1 Overview
In this scenario, one network is fully supporting IMS and SeDoC but the
interworking network does not support IMS or ICS.
For inbound roamers, the basic enhancement is to provide VLR services towards
the HLR in the HPLMN in an interworking function for inbound roamers, which
has the role of a centralized VLR.
The architecture is similar to the normal ICS architecture with the difference
that the ICS Interworking Function is shared by all SeDoC -MSCs to support
inbound roamers without IMS roaming agreement. The inbound roamers will have a
temporary IMS subscription for the VPLMN, all services are executed in the
VPLMN.
For outbound roaming UEs, it is the opposite way, i.e. the interworking
function provides HLR services to the VLR in the VPLMN and in addition
provides interworking of the IMS/CS profile and the service settings. The
interworking function provides also signalling interworking towards the MSC in
the VPLMN.
## H.5.2 Inbound-roaming support
### H.5.2.1 Roaming Architecture with legacy home network
For the migration phase the SeDoC enabled network operator is required to
provide legacy support for inbound roamers. The architecture proposed in this
solution is for the SeDoC enabled visited network to emulate a VLR and
allocate to the inbound CS roaming subscriber a temporary IMS identity so that
they can also be served by the IMS domain.
CAMEL can be supported by collocating the IP Multimedia Service Switching
Function (IM SSF) with the AS. The IM SSF retrieves the CAMEL Subscription
Information (CSI) from the ICS IWF at the time of the Attach of the UE. The IM
SSF would perform the normal CAMEL requests to the gsmSCF in the HPLMN as
specified in TS 23.278 [54].
The detailed architecture diagram is depicted in Figure H.5.2.1-1.
Figure H.5.2.1-1: Architecture for inbound roamer support
### H.5.2.2 IMS Centralized Services Interworking Function (ICS-IWF) Features
The ICS-IWF is necessary to support roaming scenarios. The interworking
function terminates:
the Cx\' interface towards the I-CSCF to provide the role of HSS for
procedures related to Serving CSCF assignment.
the Cx\' interface towards the S-CSCF for procedures related to routing
information retrieval from ICS-IWF to CSCF and procedures related to
authorisation (e.g. checking of roaming agreement) and procedures related to
authentication: transfer of security parameters of the subscriber between ICS-
IWF and CSCF
the C interface towards HLR for inbound roamer during migration phase to
provide the role as VLR towards HLR to retrieve authentication and
subscription data during authentication/registration procedure and to retrieve
routing information for the terminating case
the Sh\' interface for the role as HSS towards AS in VPLMN for local IMS
registration,
The ICS-IWF provides the several roles:
\- role as VLR towards HPLMN HLR, i.e. in course of registration the ICS-IWF
retrieves the user profile from HPLMN and creates a temporary user profile.
The temporary user profile may be updated due to MAP ISD or deleted due to MAP
Cancel or IMS de-registration or IMS registration time out.
\- role as HSS towards the S-CSCF in VPLMN for local IMS registration.
\- role as AS towards HSS in VPLMN for 3rd party IMS registration to enable
terminating session routing to the VPLMN.
\- maps supplementary services management commands for inbound roamers to the
respective CS MAP command to the HLR
\- role as HLR towards VLR for outbound roamers in a legacy network.
### H.5.2.3 Call Flows for Inbound roamer
#### H.5.2.3.1 Authentication/Registration for Inbound roamers
The main difference to the procedure for own users is that for inbound roamers
the registration flow goes through an ICS IWF that acts as a HSS towards the
I-CSCF and S-CSCF in the VPLMN and as a VLR towards the HPLMN HLR.
Figure H.5.2.3.1-1: Authentication/Registration procedure for inbound roamer
1\. -7. Same as steps as in Annex G of this specification with the difference
that in step 5, the I-CSCF detects the inbound roaming UE based on a
comparison of the MNC/MCC in the IMPI/IMPU. The I-CSCF queries the IWF which
may look up a database whether the MNC/MCC operator network (HPLMN of the
inbound roaming UE) has an IMS roaming agreement or not. If there is no IMS
roaming agreement or any other related Service Level Agreements (SLA) in place
with this network, then the IWF selects an S-CSCF which is able to handle the
CS authentication procedure and provides the S-CSCF address to the I-CSCF.
I-CSCF marks the SIP REGISTER with an inbound roaming indication towards the
S-CSCF.
NOTE 1: SeDoC is a homogeneous service and all MSC Servers in the PLMN need to
support it.
8\. The S-CSCF identifies the REGISTER as being from the MSC Server enhanced
for SeDoC for an inbound roamer. The S-CSCF requests the authentication info
from the ICS IWF which acts as a HSS towards the S-CSCF.
9.-13.The ICS-IWF acting as VLR retrieves the Authentication Info parameters
(authentication quintets required for UMTS AKA) from the HLR. The ICS IWF
retrieves the service profile via the D interface, i.e. it behaves like a VLR
towards the HPLMN HLR by performing an Update Location Procedure and Insert
Subscriber Data Procedure. The ICS IWF creates a temporary record
(subscription profile). For invoking other AS(s), the ICS IWF generates the
corresponding iFC(s).
NOTE 2: SeDoC does not support 2G authentication.
14-26. Same as steps 10.-22 Annex G of this specification.
### H.5.2.4 Originating session for Inbound roamer
The Origination session for inbound roamers is very similar to the Origination
using I2 reference point as described in clause 7.3.2.1.2 of this
specification with the difference that the S-CSCF and AS is located in the
VPLMN.
### H.5.2.5 Terminating session for Inbound roamer
UEs which have been successfully registered in IMS by the MSC Server have a
registration binding at the S‑CSCF containing the MSC Server as the contact
address.
The SCC AS shall be inserted in the IMS session path using the terminating
iFC. The SCC AS performs T-ADS for selection of an access and returns
information to assist with S‑CSCF selection of a registered contact address.
When the T-ADS function selects the MSC Server enhanced for SeDoC, the SCC AS
directs the IMS terminating session towards the contact address of the MSC
Server.
On receipt of the session initiation message, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS
shall perform the necessary interworking between the I2 reference point and CS
signalling (e.g. as described in TS 24.008 [6]). The MSC Server shall also
control a CS-MGW using the Mc reference point to perform the necessary
interworking between RTP bearers on the Mb reference point and CS access
bearers and adds the User Location Information (e.g. CGI or SAI) and/or UE
Time Zone Information to the response to the session initiation.
The SCC AS selects to breakout an incoming session to the CS domain in case UE
is registered in IMS as being attached to the CS network at an MSC Server
enhanced for SeDoC. In this case, terminating iFC forwards the call to the SCC
AS.
Figure H.5.2.5-1: Terminating session via CS Access for inbound roamer
1\. The UE A originates a call in the CS domain to party-B according to
standard origination procedures.
2\. The GMSC sends a Send Routing Information (SRI) request to the HLR.
3.-4. The HLR fetches a MSRN from the ICS-IWF acting as VLR by a Provide
Roaming Number (PRN) request/response sequence.
5\. The HLR forward the MSRN in the SRI Res. message.
6\. The GMSC sets up the call towards the MGCF of the VPLMN with the received
MSRN.
7\. The MGCF initiates an INVITE towards the I‑CSCF in the visited IMS of the
UE B.
8.-9. The I-CSCF retrieves the address assigned to the SeDoC user from the
ICS-IWF. For the LIR the I-CSCF uses the called party from the INVITE which is
the MSRN. The IWF has assigned this MSRN according to the called user (MSISDN)
(step 3,4) and has stored the relation MSISDN/MSRN.
10\. The I‑CSCF routes the INVITE to the S‑CSCF.
11\. The S‑CSCF performs standard service control execution procedures. Filter
criteria direct the S‑CSCF to send the INVITE to the SCC AS.
12\. . The SCC AS performs terminating access domain selection. The SCC AS
chooses the CS access network and the MSC Server contact address, amongst the
registered contact addresses for the UE B, for the setup of the media. The SCC
AS establishes a new session by sending an INVITE to the UE B via the S‑CSCF.
13\. The S‑CSCF forwards the INVITE to the MSC Server based on the contact
address stored during registration, using standard IMS procedures.
14\. The MSC Server sends a Setup message to the UE B.
## H.5.3 Outbound-roaming support
### H.5.3.1 Call flows for outbound-roamers
#### H.5.3.1.1 Attach/Registration Procedure for outbound roamer
Figure H.5.3.1.1-1: Authentication/Registration for outbound roamer in a SeDoC
enhanced network
1.-22. The flow description is the same as in annex XXX of this specification.
#### H.5.3.1.2 Originating session for own users roaming (outbound roamer)
For session origination for own users please refer to clause 7.3.2.1.2 of this
specification.
#### H.5.3.1.3 Terminating session for own users roaming (outbound roamer)
For session termination for own users please refer to clause 7.4.2.1.2 of this
specification.
#### H.5.3.1.4 Call flow for outbound-roamers to a not enhanced network
The ICS-IWF acts as a HLR towards the not enhanced MSC in the VPLMN, the
procedures between MSC and ICS-IWF follow the normal VLR - HLR procedures.
NOTE: The interaction between ICS-IWF and HSS is implementation specific.
Figure H.5.3.2-1: Authentication/Registration for outbound roamer in a not
enhanced network
1\. The UE sends a Location Update Request message to the MSC-Server in the
VPLMN and includes its IMSI and the LAI. In case of a combined attach, or CSFB
etc., then the Location Update Request may be sent from the MME or the SGSN of
the VPLMN.
2\. The MSC detects based on the IMSI that the UE does not belong to the own
network and is an inbound roamer. If the request is coming from the MME/SGSN,
then the CS authentication may be skipped. The MSC contacts the ICS IWF,
acting as a HLR of the HPLMN, indicating that CS authentication is required
with a Authentication Parameter Request.
3\. The ICS IWF retrieves the CS authentication data from the HSS.
4\. The ICS IWF (acting as HLR to the MSC-Server) provides the Authentication
Info parameters to the MSC-Server. The MSC-Server stores the parameters and
triggers the CS authentication procedure.
5\. The MSC-Server sends a Authentication Request with the RAND value to the
UE.
6\. The UE computes the SRES and provides it back to the MSC-Server in the
Authentication Response.
7\. The MSC-Server sends an Update Location Request with the IMSI and MSRN to
the ICS-IWF, acting as the HLR of the HPLMN.
8\. The ICS IWF retrieves the subscription profile and service settings from
the HSS and maps them into a CS profile with CS settings.
9\. The ICS IWF replies with the Insert Subscriber Data message according to
normal VLR-HLR procedures.
10\. The MSC Server starts ciphering according to normal procedures.
11\. The MSC-Server provides a Location Update Accept message to the UE (or
MME,SGSN if originated request comes from here) according to the normal
procedures.
12\. The MSC-Server exchanges the Subscriber Data Insert Acknowledgement and
Location Update Acknowledgement according to normal VLR-HLR procedures.
