# 4 Reference Architecture for Data Analytics
## 4.1 General
The NWDAF (Network Data Analytics Function) is part of the architecture
specified in TS 23.501 [2] and uses the mechanisms and interfaces specified
for 5GC in TS 23.501 [2] and OAM services (see clause 6.2.3.1).
The NWDAF interacts with different entities for different purposes:
\- Data collection based on subscription to events provided by AMF, SMF, PCF,
UDM, NSACF, AF (directly or via NEF) and OAM;
\- [Optionally] Analytics and Data collection using the DCCF (Data Collection
Coordination Function);
\- Retrieval of information from data repositories (e.g. UDR via UDM for
subscriber-related information);
\- [Optionally] Storage and retrieval of information from ADRF (Analytics Data
Repository Function);
\- [Optionally] Analytics and Data collection from MFAF (Messaging Framework
Adaptor Function);
\- Retrieval of information about NFs (e.g. from NRF for NF-related
information);
\- On demand provision of analytics to consumers, as specified in clause 6.
\- Provision of bulked data related to Analytics ID(s).
A single instance or multiple instances of NWDAF may be deployed in a PLMN. If
multiple NWDAF instances are deployed, the architecture supports deploying the
NWDAF as a central NF, as a collection of distributed NFs, or as a combination
of both. If multiple NWDAF instances are deployed, an NWDAF can act as an
aggregate point (i.e. Aggregator NWDAF) and collect analytics information from
other NWDAFs, which may have different Serving Areas, to produce the
aggregated analytics (per Analytics ID), possibly with Analytics generated by
itself.
NOTE 1: When multiple NWDAFs exist, not all of them need to be able to provide
the same type of analytics results, i.e. some of them can be specialized in
providing certain types of analytics. An Analytics ID information element is
used to identify the type of supported analytics that NWDAF can generate.
NOTE 2: NWDAF instance(s) can be collocated with a 5GS NF.
## 4.2 Non-roaming architecture
### 4.2.0 General
As depicted in Figure 4.2.0-1, the 5G System architecture allows NWDAF to
collect data from any 5GC NF. The NWDAF belongs to the same PLMN as the 5GC NF
that provides the data.
Figure 4.2.0-1: Data Collection architecture from any 5GC NF
The Nnf interface is defined for the NWDAF to request subscription to data
delivery for a particular context, to cancel subscription to data delivery and
to request a specific report of data for a particular context.
The 5G System architecture allows NWDAF to retrieve the management data from
OAM by invoking OAM services.
The 5G System architecture allows NWDAF to collect data from any 5GC NF or OAM
using a DCCF with associated Ndccf services as specified in clause 8.2.
The 5G System architecture allows NWDAF and DCCF to collect data from an NWDAF
with associated Nnwdaf_DataManagement services as specified in clause 7.4. The
5G system architecture allows MFAF to fetch data from an NWDAF with associated
Nnwdaf_DataManagement service as specified in clause 7.4.
Figure 4.2.0-1a: Data Collection architecture using Data Collection
Coordination
As depicted in Figure 4.2.0-1a, the Ndccf interface is defined for the NWDAF
to support subscription request(s) for data delivery from a DCCF, to cancel
subscription to data delivery and to request a specific report of data. If the
data is not already being collected, the DCCF requests the data from the Data
Source using Nnf services. The DCCF may collect the data and deliver it to the
NWDAF or the DCCF may rely on a messaging framework to collect data from the
NF and deliver it to the NWDAF.
As depicted in Figure 4.2.0-2, the 5G System architecture allows any 5GC NF to
request network analytics information from NWDAF containing Analytics logical
function (AnLF). The NWDAF belongs to the same PLMN as the 5GC NF that
consumes the analytics information.
Figure 4.2.0-2: Network Data Analytics Exposure architecture
The Nnwdaf interface is defined for 5GC NFs, to request subscription to
network analytics delivery for a particular context, to cancel subscription to
network analytics delivery and to request a specific report of network
analytics for a particular context.
NOTE 1: The 5G System architecture also allows other consumers such as OAM and
CEF (Charging Enablement Function) to request network analytics information
from NWDAF.
The 5G System architecture allows any NF to obtain Analytics from an NWDAF
using a DCCF function with associated Ndccf services, as specified in clause
8.2.
The 5G System architecture allows NWDAF and DCCF to request historical
analytics from an NWDAF with associated Nnwdaf_DataManagement services as
specified in clause 7.4. The 5G system architecture allows MFAF to fetch
historical analytics from an NWDAF with associated Nnwdaf_DataManagement
service as specified in clause 7.4.
Figure 4.2.0-2a: Network Data Analytics Exposure architecture using Data
Collection Coordination
As depicted in Figure 4.2.0-2a, the Ndccf interface is defined for any NF to
support subscription request(s) to network analytics, to cancel subscription
for network analytics and to request a specific report of network analytics.
If the analytics is not already being collected, the DCCF requests the
analytics from the NWDAF using Nnwdaf services. The DCCF may collect the
analytics and deliver it to the NF, or the DCCF may rely on a messaging
framework to collect analytics and deliver it to the NF.
As depicted in Figure 4.2.0-3, the 5G System architecture allows NWDAF
containing Analytics logical function (AnLF) to use trained ML model
provisioning services from another NWDAF containing Model Training logical
function (MTLF).
NOTE 2: Analytics logical function and Model Training logical function are
described in clause 5.1.
Figure 4.2.0-3: Trained ML Model Provisioning architecture
The Nnwdaf interface is used by an NWDAF containing AnLF to request and
subscribe to trained ML model provisioning services.
NOTE 3: The NWDAF trained ML model provisioning services are described in
clause 7.5 and clause 7.6.
NOTE 4: The NWDAF containing AnLF is the only consumer of trained ML model
provisioning services in this release of the specification.
### 4.2.1 Analytics Data Repository Function
As depicted in Figure 4.2.1-1, the 5G System architecture allows ADRF to store
and retrieve the collected data and analytics. The following options are
supported:
\- ADRF exposes the Nadrf service for storage and retrieval of data by other
5GC NFs (e.g. NWDAF) which access the data using Nadrf services.
\- Based on the NF request or configuration on the DCCF, the DCCF may
determine the ADRF and interact directly or indirectly with the ADRF to
request or store data. The interaction can be:
\- Direct: the DCCF requests to store data in the ADRF via an Nadrf service,
or via an Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify (e.g. when ADRF requested data
collection notification via DCCF). In addition, the DCCF retrieves data from
the ADRF via an Nadrf service.
\- Indirect: the DCCF requests that the Messaging Framework to store data in
the ADRF i.e. via an Nadrf service or via an
Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure. The Messaging Framework may contain one or
more Adaptors that translate between 3GPP defined protocols.
NOTE 1: The internal logic of Messaging Framework is outside the scope of
3GPP, only the MFAF and the interface between MFAF and other 3GPP defined NF
is under 3GPP scope.
\- A Consumer NF may specify in requests to a DCCF that data provided by a
Data Source needs to be stored in the ADRF.
\- The ADRF stores data received in an Nadrf_DataManagement_StorageRequest
sent directly from an NF, or data received in an Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify /
Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify or Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Notify from the DCCF,
MFAF or from the NWDAF.
\- The ADRF checks if the Data Consumer is authorized to access ADRF services
and provides the requested data using the procedures specified in clause 7.1.4
of TS 23.501 [2].
Figure 4.2.1-1: Data storage architecture for Analytics and Collected Data
## 4.3 Roaming architecture
The interactions between the NWDAF and the other 5GC NFs are only considered
in the same PLMN case.
Roaming architecture does not apply in this release of the specification.
# 5 Network Data Analytics Functional Description
## 5.1 General
The NWDAF provides analytics to 5GC NFs and OAM as defined in clause 7. An
NWDAF may contain the following logical functions:
\- **Analytics logical function (AnLF):** A logical function in NWDAF, which
performs inference, derives analytics information (i.e. derives statistics
and/or predictions based on Analytics Consumer request) and exposes analytics
service i.e. Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo.
\- **Model Training logical function (MTLF):** A logical function in NWDAF,
which trains Machine Learning (ML) models and exposes new training services
(e.g. providing trained ML model) as defined in clause 7.5 and clause 7.6.
NOTE 1: NWDAF can contain an MTLF or an AnLF or both logical functions.
NOTE 2: Pre-trained ML model storage and provisioning to NWDAF is out of the
scope of 3GPP.
NOTE 3: In this Release of the specification an NWDAF containing AnLF is
locally configured with (a set of) IDs of NWDAFs containing MTLF and the
Analytics ID(s) supported by each NWDAF containing MTLF to retrieve trained ML
models. An NWDAF containing AnLF uses NWDAF discovery for NWDAF containing
MTLF within the set of configured IDs of NWDAFs containing MTLF, if necessary.
ML Model provisioning/sharing between multiple MTLFs is not supported in this
Release of the specification.
Analytics information are either statistical information of the past events,
or predictive information.
Different NWDAF instances may be present in the 5GC, with possible
specializations per type of analytics. The capabilities of a NWDAF instance
are described in the NWDAF profile stored in the NRF.
To guarantee the accuracy of analytics output for an Analytics ID, based on
the UE abnormal behaviour analytics from itself or other NWDAF including
abnormal UE list and the observed time window, the NWDAF is to detect and may
delete the input data from the abnormal UE(s) and then may generate a new ML
model and/or analytics outputs for the Analytics ID without the input data
related to abnormal UE list during the observed time window and then
send/update the ML Model Information and/or analytics outputs to the
subscribed NWDAF service consumer.
In order to support NFs to discover and select an NWDAF instance containing
MTLF, AnLF, or both, that is able to provide the required service (e.g.
analytics exposure or ML model provisioning) for the required type of
analytics, each NWDAF instance should provide the list of supported Analytics
ID(s) (possibly per supported service) when registering to the NRF, in
addition to other NRF registration elements of the NF profile. NFs requiring
the discovery of an NWDAF instance that provides support for some specific
service(s) for a specific type of analytics may query the NRF for NWDAFs
supporting the required service(s) and the required Analytics ID(s).
The consumers, i.e. 5GC NFs and OAM, decide how to use the data analytics
provided by NWDAF.
The interactions between 5GC NF(s) and the NWDAF take place within a PLMN.
The NWDAF has no knowledge about NF application logic. The NWDAF may use
subscription data but only for statistical purpose.
The NWDAF architecture allows for arranging multiple NWDAF instances in a
hierarchy/tree with a flexible number of layers/branches. The number and
organisation of the hierarchy layers, as well as the capabilities of each
NWDAF instance remain deployment choices.
In a hierarchical deployment, NWDAFs may provide data collection exposure
capability for generating analytics based on the data collected by other
NWDAFs, when DCCF, MFAF are not present in the network.
In order to make NWDAF discoverable in some network deployments, NWDAF may be
configured (e.g. for UE mobility analytics) to register in UDM
(Nudm_UECM_Registration service operation) for the UE(s) it is serving and for
the related Analytics ID(s). Registration in UDM should take place at the time
the NWDAF starts serving the UE(s) or collecting data for the UE(s).
Deregistration in UDM takes place when NWDAF deletes the analytics context for
the UE(s) (see clause 6.1B.4) for a related Analytics ID.
NOTE 4: The procedures for data collection for UE related analytics need to
take user consent into account. The user consent for analytics is defined in
clause 6.2.9.
## 5.2 NWDAF Discovery and Selection
The NWDAF service consumer selects an NWDAF that supports requested analytics
information and required analytics capabilities and/or requested ML Model
Information by using the NWDAF discovery principles defined in clause 6.3.13
of TS 23.501 [2].
Different deployments may require different discovery and selection
parameters. Different ways to perform discovery and selection mechanisms
depend on different types of analytics/data (NF related analytics/data and UE
related analytics/data). NF related refers to analytics/data that do not
require a SUPI nor group of SUPIs (e.g. NF load analytics). UE related refers
to analytics/data that requires SUPI or group of SUPIs (e.g. UE mobility
analytics).
In order to discover an NWDAF containing AnLF using the NRF:
\- If the analytics is related to NF(s) and the NWDAF service consumer (other
than an NWDAF) cannot provide an Area of Interest for the requested data
analytics, the NWDAF service consumer may select an NWDAF with large serving
area from the candidate NWDAFs from discovery response. Alternatively, in case
the consumer receives NWDAF(s) with aggregation capability, the consumer
preferably selects an NWDAF with aggregation capability with large serving
area.
NOTE 1: If the selected NWDAF cannot provide the requested data analytics,
e.g. due to the NF(s) to be contacted being out of serving area of the NWDAF,
the selected NWDAF might reject the analytics request/subscription or it might
query the NRF with the service area of the NF to be contacted to determine
another target NWDAF.
\- If the analytics is related to UE(s) and the NWDAF service consumer (other
than an NWDAF) cannot provide an Area of Interest for the requested data
analytics, the NWDAF service consumer may select an NWDAF with large serving
area from the candidate NWDAFs from discovery response. Alternatively, in case
the consumer receives NWDAF(s) with aggregation capability, the consumer
preferably selects an NWDAF with aggregation capability with large serving
area.
NOTE 2: If a selected NWDAF cannot provide analytics for the requested UE(s)
(e.g. the NWDAF serves a different serving area), the selected NWDAF might
reject the analytics request/subscription or it might determine the AMF
serving the UE as specified in clause 6.2.2.1, request UE location information
from the AMF and query the NRF with the tracking area where the UE is located
to discover another target NWDAF serving the area where the UE(s) is located.
If the NWDAF service consumer needs to discover an NWDAF that is able to
collect data from particular data sources identified by their NF Set IDs or NF
types, the consumer may query NRF providing the NF Set IDs or NF types in the
discovery request.
NOTE 3: The NF Set ID or NF Type of a data source serving a particular UE, can
be determined as indicated in Table 5A.2-1.
In order to discover an NWDAF that has registered in UDM for a given UE:
\- NWDAF service consumers or other NWDAFs interested in UE related data or
analytics, if supported, may make a query to UDM to discover an NWDAF instance
that is already serving the given UE.
If an NWDAF service consumer needs to discover NWDAFs with data collection
exposure capability, the NWDAF service consumer may discover via NRF the
NWDAF(s) that provide the Nnwdaf_DataManagement service and their associated
NF type of data sources or their associated NF Set ID of data sources as
defined in clause 6.3.13 of TS 23.501 [2].
In order to discover an NWDAF containing MTLF via NRF:
\- an NWDAF containing MTLF shall include the ML model provisioning services
(i.e. Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision, Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo) as one of the supported
services during the registration in NRF when trained ML models are available
for one or more Analytics ID(s). The NWDAF containing MTLF may provide to the
NRF a (list of) Analytics ID(s) corresponding to the trained ML models and
possibly the ML Model Filter Information for the trained ML model per
Analytics ID(s), if available. In this Release of the specification, only the
S-NSSAI(s) and Area(s) of Interest from the ML Model Filter Information for
the trained ML model per Analytics ID(s) may be registered into the NRF during
the NWDAF containing MTLF registration.
NOTE 4: The S-NSSAI(s) and Area(s) of Interest from the ML Model Filter
Information are within the indicated S-NSSAI and NWDAF Serving Area
information in the NF profile of the NWDAF containing MTLF, respectively.
\- During the discovery of NWDAF containing MTLF a consumer (i.e. an NWDAF
containing AnLF) may include in the request the target NF type (i.e. NWDAF),
the Analytics ID(s), the S-NSSAI(s) and Area(s) of Interest of the Trained ML
Model required. The NRF returns one or more candidate for instances of NWDAF
containing MTLF to the NF consumer and each candidate for instance of NWDAF
containing MTLF includes the Analytics ID(s) and possibly the ML Model Filter
Information for the available trained ML models, if available.
NOTE 5: In this Release of the specification, the NWDAF containing AnLF
selects from the list of candidate NWDAF (containing MTLF) instance(s), an
NWDAF containing MTLF that is pre-configured in the NWDAF containing AnLF to
obtain trained ML Model(s) (see clause 5.1).
A PCF may learn which NWDAFs being used by AMF, SMF and UPF for a specific UE,
via signalling described in clause 4.16 of TS 23.502 [3]. This enables a PCF
to select the same NWDAF instance that is already being used for a specific
UE.
# 5A Data Collection Coordination and Delivery Functional Description
## 5A.1 General
Data Collection Coordination and Delivery coordinates the collection and
distribution of data requested by NF consumers. It prevents data sources from
having to handle multiple subscriptions for the same data and send multiple
notifications containing the same information due to uncoordinated requests
from data consumers.
Data Collection Coordination and Delivery is supported by a DCCF via
Ndccf_DataManagement service or by an NWDAF via Nnwdaf_DataManagement service.
Unless otherwise stated, capabilities specified in clause 5A for a DCCF are
also applicable to an NWDAF.
In this Release of the specification Data Collection Coordination and Delivery
is applicable to:
\- NWDAFs that request data from a Data Source (e.g. for use in computing
analytics).
\- NF consumers that request analytics from an NWDAF Data Source.
\- NF consumers that request data from an ADRF Data Source.
\- ADRFs that receive data from an NF Data Source.
NOTE: Nnwdaf_DataManagement service can be used to collect historical data or
runtime data. For collecting historical and runtime analytics,
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription service is used.
## 5A.2 Data Collection Coordination
Data Collection Coordination is supported by a DCCF or an NWDAF. The Data
Consumer may use an NRF to perform NF discovery and selection to find a DCCF
that can coordinate data collection (DCCF discovery principles are defined in
clause 6.3.19 of TS 23.501 [2]). Data Consumers send requests for data to the
DCCF rather than directly to the NF Data Source. Whether the data consumers
directly contact the NF Data Source or goes via the DCCF is based on
configuration of the data consumers. For the Data Consumer and each
notification endpoint in a data request, the Data Consumer may specify
Formatting and Processing Instructions that determine how the data is to be
provided. Upon receiving a request from a Data Consumer, the selected DCCF
determines the NF instance that can be a Data Source if the Data Source is not
indicated in the Data Consumer\'s request. The DCCF may also select an ADRF if
the data is to be stored in an ADRF and an ADRF endpoint is not indicated in
the Data Consumer\'s request. To retrieve data for a specific UE, the NRF, UDM
or BSF can provide the DCCF with the identity of the Data Source using the
services indicated in table 5A.2-1.

instances are serving a UE

The DCCF keeps track of the data actively being collected from the Data
Sources it is coordinating. It may do so by maintaining a record of the active
prior requests it sends to each Data Source. If a NWDAF subscribes for data
directly with a Data Source, or a Data Source has stored data in an ADRF, the
NWDAF or ADRF may register the data collection profile with the DCCF. The data
collection profile may include the following parameters:
\- \"Service Operation\" identifies the service used to collect the data or
analytics from a Data Source (e.g. Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe);
\- \"Analytics/Data Specification\" is the \"Service Operation\" specific
parameters that identify the collected data (i.e. Analytics ID(s) / Event ID
(s), Target of Analytics Reporting or Target of Event Reporting, Analytics
Filter or Event Filter, etc.);
\- NWDAF ID or ADRF ID specifies the ADRF or NWDAF which registers data
collection profile.
The DCCF may then determine certain historical data may be available in the
NWDAF or ADRF and coordinate collection of data from the NWDAF or ADRF based
on the data collection profile.
When the DCCF receives a request for data, it determines the status of data
collection from the Data Source. If parameters in a request for data from a
Data Consumer match those in a prior request or in a data collection profile
registration, the DCCF may determine that the requested data is already being
collected from a Data Source or that a prior subscription to a Data Source may
be modified to in addition satisfy the requirements of the new data request
from a Data Consumer. This status is used in clause 5A.3 to deliver data to
the Data Consumer and notification endpoints.
For persisting event exposure subscriptions for long-lived data collection,
the DCCF may subscribe to the UDM to receive event notifications even if a
Data Source that serves a UE changes.
The DCCF may subscribe to the NRF to receive event notifications if a Data
Source changes (e.g. because of a NF life-cycle event).
NOTE: A DCCF can support multiple Data Sources, Data Consumers and Message
Frameworks. However, to avoid duplicate data collection, each Data Source NF
or Set of Data Source NF should be associated with only one DCCF instance or
DCCF Set.
A DCCF may use the same mechanisms described in clause 6.2.2.1 to determine
AMF and SMF to retrieve data related to \"any UE\".
If the data consumer requests to collect data for any UE in an area of
interest, the data consumer shall first determine all DCCFs covering the area
of interest and then contact these DCCFs to request for data collection.
## 5A.3 Data Delivery
### 5A.3.0 General
Data is provided to Consumers or notification endpoints according to the
Delivery Option configured on the DCCF or NWDAF. Delivery Options are:
1\. Delivery via DCCF or NWDAF: Consumers or Notification Endpoints receive
the data from the DCCF or NWDAF.
2\. Delivery via Messaging Framework: Consumers or Notification Endpoints
receive the data from the Messaging Framework via the services offered by the
MFAF.
### 5A.3.1 Data Delivery via the DCCF or NWDAF
Figure 5A.3.1-1: Data Delivery via DCCF
Data Delivery via DCCF is shown in Figure 5A.3.1-1. Each Event Notification
received from a Data Source NF is sent to the DCCF which propagates it to all
Data Consumers / Notification Endpoints specified by the Data Consumers or
determined by the DCCF. Each Data Consumer may specify in its request to the
DCCF multiple notification endpoints, which may include the requesting Data
Consumer, an ADRF or other NFs. The DCCF may also select an ADRF or other
notification endpoint based on configuration. The DCCF supports formatting and
processing for each Consumer / notification endpoint so notifications comply
with the data requests received from each Consumer NF.
Upon the DCCF determining the status of data collection for a data request
(see clause 5A.2):
\- If the requested data is not already being collected from a Data Source,
the DCCF sends a new subscription/request towards the Data Source with the
notification target specified as the DCCF.
\- If the requested data is partially covered by existing subscriptions with
the Data Source, the DCCF sends to the existing Data Source a request to
modify the subscription and/or creates new subscription(s) to new Data Source
for the newly requested data which cannot be provided by the current Data
Source.
\- If the requested data is already being collected from the Data Source, the
DCCF determines that no subscriptions to the Data Source need to be created or
modified.
When notifications are received by the DCCF, they are processed according to
the Formatting and Processing Instructions for each Consumer and notification
endpoint. The DCCF subsequently sends notifications to Consumers and
notification endpoints via a Ndccf_DataManagement service.
The same functionality as described above applies for Data Delivery and bulked
data collection via NWDAF with Nnwdaf services replacing corresponding Ndccf
services.
### 5A.3.2 Data Delivery via a Messaging Framework
Figure 5A.3.2-1: Data Delivery via a Messaging Framework
Data Delivery via a Messaging Framework is shown in figure 5A.3.2-1. The
Messaging Framework formats and processes data received from the Data Source
NF and sends notifications to all Data Consumers and Notification Endpoints
specified by Data Consumers or determined by the DCCF. Each Data Consumer may
specify in its request to the DCCF multiple notification endpoints, which may
include the requesting Data Consumer, an ADRF or other NFs. The DCCF may also
select an ADRF or other notification endpoint based on configuration. While
the Messaging Framework is not standardized by 3GPP, a Messaging Framework
Adaptor NF (MFAF) offers 3GPP defined services that allow the 5GS to interact
with the Messaging Framework. Internally, the Messaging Framework may for
example support the pub-sub pattern, where received data are published to the
Messaging Framework and requests from 3GPP Consumers result in Messaging
Framework specific subscriptions. Alternatively, the Messaging Framework may
support other protocols outside of the scope of 3GPP.
The Messaging Framework Adaptor NF offers services that enable the 5GS to
interact with the Messaging Framework:
\- 3GPP Consumer Adaptor (3CA) Data Management Service:
Nmfaf_3caDataManagement Service delivers data to each Data Consumer or
notification endpoint after formatting and processing of data received by the
Messaging Framework.
\- 3GPP DCCF Adaptor (3DA) Data Management Service: Nmfaf_3daDataManagement
Service enables the DCCF to convey to the Messaging Framework, information
about the data the Messaging Framework will receive from a Data Source,
formatting and processing instructions and the Data Consumer and notification
endpoints.
Upon the DCCF determining the status of data collection for a data request
(see clause 5A.2):
\- If the requested data is not currently being collected from a Data Source,
the DCCF sends a new subscription/request towards the Data Source with the
notification target specified as the Messaging Framework.
\- If the requested data is partially covered by existing subscriptions with
the Data Source, the DCCF sends a request to the Data Source to modify one or
more subscriptions to accommodate both the previous requests for data and the
new request for data and/or creates new subscription(s) to new Data Source for
the newly requested data which cannot be provided by the current Data Source.
\- If the requested data is already being collected from the Data Source, the
DCCF determines that no subscriptions to the Data Source need to be created or
modified.
NOTE: The internal logic of DCCF, e.g. how it decides on what modifications to
do, is not specified.
\- The DCCF uses the Nmfaf_3daData Management service to convey information
so:
1\. the Messaging Framework can recognize data that are received from a Data
Source.
2\. the MFAF can obtain data received by the Messaging Framework, process and
format the data according to processing and formatting instructions for each
Consumer / notification endpoint and send notifications or responses to the
Data Consumers.
When data are received by the Messaging Framework (e.g. because of an event
notification) they are processed according the Formatting and Processing
Instructions for each Consumer / notification endpoint before notifications
are sent to the Data Consumer or Notification Endpoints. Notifications sent
via the Nmfaf_3caDataManagement service have the same content as those sent
via a Ndccf_DataManagement service for Data Delivery via the DCCF.
The same functionality as described above applies for Data Delivery and bulk
data collection via NWDAF with Nnwdaf services replacing corresponding Ndccf
services.
## 5A.4 Data Formatting and Processing
Formatting and/or Processing instructions may be provided in requests by Data
Consumers via the Ndccf_DataManagement service and Nnwdaf_DataManagement
service. As an alternative to providing individual events, formatting can be
used to aggregate notifications and processing can be used to extract and send
summary information from multiple notifications. Data Formatting and
Processing are applicable to notifications due to events as they occur at data
sources (runtime data or analytics) and historical data as described in clause
5A.5.
When using the Messaging Framework, the DCCF sends the formatting and/or
processing instructions to the Messaging Framework via the
Nmfaf_3daData_Management Service so the MFAF may format and/or process the
data before sending notifications to the Data Consumers / notification
endpoints. When using Data Delivery via the DCCF, the DCCF performs formatting
and/or processing before sending notifications.
Formatting determines when a notification is sent to the Consumer. Formatting
Instructions may indicate:
\- Notification Event clubbing: Buffering and sending of several notifications
in one message. The consumer may specify a minimum and/or maximum number of
notifications to be clubbed.
\- Notification Time Window (example: notifications are buffered and sent
between 2 and 3 AM).
\- Cross event reference-based notification: When a subscribing NF is
subscribing to multiple events (e.g. event X and event Y) the notification for
an Event-X is buffered and reported only when the Event-Y occurs.
\- Consumer triggered Notification: Notifications containing data or analytics
are buffered until the consumer requests delivery using Nnwdaf_DataManagement,
Ndccf_DataManagement or Nmfaf_3caDataManagement Service. The consumer requests
Consumer triggered notification by setting a \"fetch flag\" in its
subscription request to the DCCF or NWDAF. When the requested data or
analytics is available for retrieval, the DCCF, NWDAF or MFAF sends a
notification containing fetch instructions to the consumer. The consumer must
then fetch the data or analytics before an expiry time as provided in the
fetch instructions.
NOTE: When this indication is set by the consumer, DCCF, NWDAF or MFAF
notifications to the consumer contain Fetch Instructions (see clauses 8.2.4,
7.4.4 and 9.3.2).
\- Exact time-based Notification: Notifications are sent to the Consumer at an
exact time, irrespective of whether the event occurs (example: every 30 min).
Exact time-based notifications may be periodic.
\- Increasing time window based notification: Notifications are sent to the
Consumer at an increasing periodicity (example: the first notification is sent
immediately, subsequent received notifications are sent after 5 min, then
after 10 min, then after 15 min, etc.).
For an ADRF endpoint, Formatting Instructions sent to the messaging framework
may further specify whether Nmfaf services are used to deliver notifications
to an ADRF, or whether the data are sent to the ADRF using a Nadrf service.
Processing instructions allow summarizing of notifications to reduce the
volume of data reported to the Data Consumer. The processing results in
summarizing of information from multiple notifications into a common report.
Processing of data for inclusion in each notification sent to consumers occurs
over a Processing Interval specified in the Processing Instructions.
Notifications sent to consumers may represent partial intervals if formatting
instructions or Event Reporting Information (as specified in TS 23.502 [3]
table 4.15.1.1-1) require that a notification be sent to the consumer before
the end of a processing interval. Processing Instructions are provided per
Event ID or Analytics ID and are applied to multiple notifications that result
from the same subscription and for the same Event ID or Analytics ID.
Processing Instructions, in addition to the Processing Interval, may specify
the parameter names, parameter values and the attributes to be determined and
reported to the Consumer. Processing Instructions may also specify aggregation
level (e.g. per-UEs, per AoIs) or temporal aggregation (e.g. per minute, per
hour).
The processed notifications may comprise the following depending on the Event
and Processing Instructions:
\- Event;
\- Processing Interval;
\- List of Event Parameter Name(s) and for each Event Parameter Name, one
Event Parameter Values and sets of the following attributes as indicated in
the processing instructions:
\- Event Spacing: Average and variance of the time interval separating two
consecutive occurrences of the same event and parameter value, or periodicity
for periodic reporting;
\- Event Duration: Average and variance of the Time for which the parameter
value applies;
\- Number of countable occurrences for the parameter (e.g.: Mobility
Registration Update);
\- Average, variance, most frequent value, least frequent value and skew of
the parameter (e.g.: number of UEs in an AoI);
\- Maximum and minimum parameter values (e.g.: number of UEs in an AoI).
Event Parameter Names are Event specific and not all attributes are applicable
for all parameter names. Examples of Event Parameter Names and Parameter
values are provided in table 5A.4-1.
Table 5A.4-1: Examples of Event Parameter Names, Parameter values
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Event | Event | Parameter | Attributes | | | parameter name | values | | +================+================+================+================+ | Location | TAI | TAI-7 | - Average and | | Report | | | variance of | | | | | the time | | | | | interval | | | | | between TA | | | | | boundary | | | | | crossings. | | | | | | | | | | - Number of | | | | | TA boundary | | | | | crossing. | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Number of UEs | Region | AMF-3 | - Average and | | in a Region | | | variance of | | | | | the number of | | | | | UEs in the | | | | | Region. | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | UE | CM State | Connected | - Average and | | Reachability | | | variance of | | (status | | | time between | | change) | | | CM connected | | | | | state | | | | | transitions. | | | | | | | | | | - Average and | | | | | variance of | | | | | the time spent | | | | | in CM | | | | | connected | | | | | state. | | | | | | | | | | - Number of | | | | | transitions to | | | | | CM connected | | | | | state. | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | PDU Session | DNN | Internet | - Average and | | Establishment | | | variance of | | | | | time between | | | | | PDU Session | | | | | establishments | | | | | to the | | | | | Internet DN. | | | | | | | | | | - Average and | | | | | variance of | | | | | the duration | | | | | of PDU | | | | | Sessions | | | | | established to | | | | | the Internet | | | | | DN. | | | | | | | | | | - Number of | | | | | PDU Session | | | | | establishments | | | | | to the | | | | | Internet DN. | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | PDU Session | PDU Session | Ethernet | - Average and | | Establishment | Type | | variance of | | | | | time between | | | | | Ethernet PDU | | | | | Session | | | | | e | | | | | stablishments. | | | | | | | | | | - Average and | | | | | variance of | | | | | the duration | | | | | of Ethernet | | | | | PDU Sessions. | | | | | | | | | | - Number of | | | | | Ethernet PDU | | | | | Session | | | | | e | | | | | stablishments. | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
## 5A.5 Historical Data Handling
ADRF or NWDAF as a Data Source:
\- When the DCCF receives a request for data that includes a period in the
past and ADRF is deployed, the DCCF may obtain data from ADRF as the Data
Source. The DCCF may also obtain historical data from an NWDAF. The data
obtained from the ADRF or NWDAF is delivered to Consumers / Notification
Endpoints according to a configured Delivery Option. The DCCF may determine
that requested data may be available in an ADRF or NWDAF based on ADRF
identification from the consumer, the data collection profile previously
registered by the ADRF or NWDAF or by querying the ADRF or NWDAF.
ADRF or NWDAF as a Data Recipient:
\- An ADRF or NWDAF may be a Consumer NF that initiates requests to the DCCF
for data, the ADRF or NWDAF may be specified as a notification endpoint by
another Consumer NF that wants to have data it requests archived, or the DCCF
may be configured to archive certain data in a ADRF (e.g. all data from an AMF
instance).
\- If the ADRF or NWDAF instance is not specified in a request for data by a
Consumer NF, the DCCF may select the ADRF or NWDAF instance based on
provisioned information or information received from the NRF.
\- Data is delivered to the ADRF or NWDAF according to a configured Delivery
Option (via DCCF or Messaging Framework).
# 5B Analytics Data Repository Functional Description
## 5B.1 General
The ADRF offers services that enable a consumer to store and retrieve data and
analytics. The analytics are produced by the NWDAF as described in clause 6.1
and data are collected as described in clause 6.2.
Data may be stored in the ADRF by:
\- a consumer sending the ADRF an Nadrf_DataManagement_StorageRequest
containing the data or analytics to be stored. The ADRF response provides a
result indication.
\- a consumer sending the ADRF an
Nadrf_DataManagement_StorageSubscriptionRequest requesting that the ADRF
subscribes to receive data or analytics for storage. The ADRF then subscribes
to the NWDAF or DCCF for data or analytics, providing ADRF Notification
Address (+Notification Correlation ID). Analytics or Data are subsequently
provided as notifications using DCCF, NWDAF or MFAF services
(Ndccf_DataManagement Nnwdaf_DataManagement or Nmfaf_3caDataManagement
service).
Data may be retrieved from the ADRF by:
\- a consumer sending an Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalRequest request to the
ADRF to retrieve data or analytics for a Storage Transaction Identifier or a
Fetch Instructions received from the ADRF in an
Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalNotify. The ADRF determines the availability of
the data or analytics in its repository and sends in the response to the
consumer either the data or analytics.
\- a consumer sending an Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalSubscribe request to
the ADRF to retrieve data or analytics for a specified data or analytics
collection time window. If the time window includes the future and the ADRF
has subscribed to receive the data or analytics, subsequent notifications
received by the ADRF are sent by the ADRF to the notification endpoint.
The ADRF determines the availability of the data or analytics and sends a
success/failure indication in the response to the consumer. The ADRF then
sends one or more notifications using an Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalNotify
to the Notification Address (+Notification Correlation ID) specified by the
consumer. The notification(s) either provide the data or analytics or provide
instructions to the endpoint to fetch the data or analytics using an
Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalRequest.
Data may be deleted from the ADRF by:
\- a consumer sending an Nadrf_DataManagement_Delete request.
An ADRF may be configured to register the data it is collecting with a DCCF.
The registration uses the Ndccf_ContextManagement service specified in clause
8.3.2. The registration may subsequently be used by the DCCF to obtain data
from the ADRF as described in clause 6.2.6.3.6.
# 6 Procedures to Support Network Data Analytics
## 6.0 General
This clause specifies procedures to support network data analytics function.
Clause 6.1 and clause 6.2 specify generic procedures which apply to all type
of analytics, while clause 6.3 and onwards specify procedures specific to some
type of analytics.
## 6.1 Procedures for analytics exposure
### 6.1.1 Analytics Subscribe/Unsubscribe
#### 6.1.1.1 Analytics subscribe/unsubscribe by NWDAF service consumer
This procedure is used by any NWDAF service consumer (e.g. including NFs/OAM)
to subscribe/unsubscribe at NWDAF to be notified on analytics information,
using Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription service defined in clause 7.2. This service
is also used by an NWDAF service consumer to modify existing analytics
subscription(s). Any entity can consume this service as defined in clause 7.2.
Figure 6.1.1.1-1: Network data analytics Subscribe/unsubscribe
1\. The NWDAF service consumer subscribes to or cancels subscription to
analytics information by invoking the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe/
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Unsubscribe service operation. The parameters
that can be provided by the NWDAF service consumer are listed in clause 6.1.3.
When a subscription to analytics information is received, the NWDAF determines
whether triggering new data collection is needed.
If the service invocation is for a subscription modification, the NF service
consumer includes an identifier (Subscription Correlation ID) to be modified
in the invocation of Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe.
2\. If NWDAF service consumer is subscribed to analytics information, the
NWDAF notifies the NWDAF service consumer with the analytics information by
invoking Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify service operation, based on the
request from the NWDAF service consumer, e.g. Analytics Reporting Parameters.
If the NWDAF provides a Termination Request, then the consumer cancels
subscription to analytics information by invoking the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Unsubscribe service operation.
#### 6.1.1.2 Analytics subscribe/unsubscribe by AFs via NEF
The analytics exposure to AFs may be performed via NEF by using analytics
subscription to NWDAF.
Figure 6.1.1.2-1 illustrates the interaction between AF and NWDAF performed
via the NEF.
Figure 6.1.1.2-1: Procedure for analytics subscribe/unsubscribe by AFs via NEF
0\. NEF controls the analytics exposure mapping among the AF identifier with
allowed Analytics ID and associated inbound restrictions (i.e, applied to
subscription of the Analytics ID for an AF) and/or outbound restrictions (i.e.
applied to notification of Analytics ID to an AF).
In this Release, AF is configured with the appropriated NEF to subscribe to
analytics information, the allowed Analytics ID(s) and with allowed inbound
restrictions (i.e. parameters and/or parameter values) for subscription to
each Analytics ID.
1\. The AF subscribes to or cancels subscription to analytics information via
NEF by invoking the Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Subscribe/
Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Unsubscribe service operation defined in TS 23.502 [3].
If the AF wants to modify an existing analytics subscription at NEF, it
includes an identifier (Subscription Correlation ID) to be modified in the
invocation of Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Subscribe. If the analytics information
subscription is authorized by the NEF, the NEF proceeds with the steps below.
2\. Based on the request from the AF, the NEF subscribes to or cancels
subscription to analytics information by invoking the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe/
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Unsubscribe service operation.
If the parameters and/or parameters values of the AF request comply with the
inbound restriction in the analytics exposure mapping, NEF forwards in the
subscription to NWDAF service the Analytics ID, parameters and/or parameters
values from the AF request.
If the request from AF does not comply with the restrictions in the analytics
exposure mapping, NEF may apply restrictions to the subscription request to
NWDAF (e.g. restrictions to parameters or parameter values of the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operations), based on operator
configuration and/or may apply parameter mapping (e.g. geo coordinate mapping
to TA(s)/Cell-id(s)).
The NEF records the association of the analytics request from the AF and the
analytics request sent to the NWDAF.
The NEF selects an NWDAF that supports analytics information requested by the
AF using the NWDAF discovery procedure defined in TS 23.501 [2].
If the AF request is for a modification of the existing analytics
subscription(s), the NEF invokes Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe to
modify the analytics subscription identified by an identifier (Subscription
Correlation ID) associated with the AF.
3\. If the NEF has subscribed to analytics information, the NWDAF notifies the
NEF with the analytics information or Termination Request by invoking
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify service operation.
4\. If the NEF receives the notification from the NWDAF, the NEF notifies the
AF with the analytics information or Termination Request by invoking
Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Notify service operation defined in TS 23.502 [3]. NEF
may apply outbound restrictions to the notifications to AFs (e.g. restrictions
to parameters or parameter values of the Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Notify service
operation) based on analytics exposure mapping and may apply parameter mapping
for external usage (e.g. TA(s), Cell-id(s) to geo coordinate). The AF checks
if a Termination Request is present in the Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Notify as
defined in step 2 in clause 6.1.1.1.
### 6.1.2 Analytics Request
#### 6.1.2.1 Analytics request by NWDAF service consumer
This procedure is used by the NWDAF service consumer (e.g. including NFs/OAM)
to request and get from NWDAF analytics information, using
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service defined in clause 7.3.
Figure 6.1.2.1-1: Network data analytics Request
1\. The NWDAF service consumer requests analytics information by invoking
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request service operation. The parameters that can be
provided by the NWDAF service consumer are listed in clause 6.1.3.
When a request for analytics information is received, the NWDAF determines
whether triggering new data collection is needed.
2\. The NWDAF responds with analytics information to the NWDAF service
consumer. The NWDAF checks if a Termination Request is indicated as defined in
step 2 in clause 6.1.1.1.
#### 6.1.2.2 Analytics request by AFs via NEF
The analytics exposure to AFs may be performed via NEF by using analytics
request to NWDAF.
Figure 6.1.2.2-1 illustrates the interaction between AF and NWDAF performed
via the NEF.
Figure 6.1.2.2-1: Procedure for analytics request by AFs via NEF
0\. NEF controls the analytics exposure mapping among the AF identifier with
allowed Analytics ID(s) and associated inbound restrictions (i.e. applied to
the Analytics ID requested by AF and/or outbound restrictions (i.e. applied to
the response of Analytics ID to AF).
In this Release, AF is configured, e.g. via static OAM configuration, with the
appropriated NEF to subscribe to analytics information, the allowed Analytics
ID(s) and with allowed inbound restrictions (i.e. parameters and/or parameter
values) for requesting each Analytics ID.
1\. The AF requests to receive analytics information via NEF by invoking the
Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Fetch service operation defined in TS 23.502 [3]. If
the analytics information request is authorized by the NEF, the NEF proceeds
with the steps below.
2\. Based on the request from the AF, the NEF requests analytics information
by invoking the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request service operation.
If the parameters and/or parameters values of the AF request comply with the
restriction in the analytics exposure mapping, NEF forwards in the
subscription to NWDAF service the Analytics ID, parameters and/or parameters
values from AF in the request to NWDAF.
If the request from AF does not comply with the restrictions in the analytics
exposure mapping, NEF may apply restrictions to the request to NWDAF (e.g.
restrictions to parameters or parameter values of the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request service operations) based on operator
configuration and/or may apply parameter mapping (e.g. geo coordinate mapping
to TA(s), Cell-id(s)).
The NEF records the association of the analytics request from the AF and the
analytics request sent to the NWDAF.
The NEF selects an NWDAF that supports analytics information requested by the
AF using the NWDAF discovery procedure defined in TS 23.501 [2].
3\. The NWDAF responds with the analytics information to the NEF.
4\. The NEF responds with the analytics information to the AF. NEF may apply
restrictions to the response to AFs (e.g. restrictions to parameters or
parameter values of the Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Fetch response service
operation) based on operator configuration. The AF checks if a Termination
Request is present and then follows as defined in step 2 in clause 6.1.1.1.
### 6.1.3 Contents of Analytics Exposure
The consumers of the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request service operations described in clause 7 provide
the following input parameters listed below.
\- A list of Analytics ID(s): identifies the requested analytics.
\- Analytics Filter Information: indicates the conditions to be fulfilled for
reporting Analytics Information. This set of optional parameter types and
values enables to select which type of analytics information is requested.
Analytics Filter Information is defined in the analytics related clauses.
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: indicates the object(s) for which Analytics
information is requested, entities such as specific UEs, a group of UE(s) or
any UE (i.e. all UEs).
\- (Only for Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe) A Notification Target
Address (+ Notification Correlation ID) as defined in clause 4.15.1 of TS
23.502 [3], allowing to correlate notifications received from NWDAF with this
subscription.
\- (Only for Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe) Subscription Correlation
ID: identifies an existing analytics subscription that is to be modified.
\- Related to analytic consumers that aggregate analytics from multiple NWDAF
subscriptions:
\- [OPTIONAL] (Set of) NWDAF identifiers of NWDAF instances used by the NWDAF
service consumer when aggregating multiple analytics subscriptions. See clause
6.1A.
\- Analytics Reporting Information with the following parameters:
\- (Only for Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe) Analytics Reporting
Parameters as per Event Reporting parameters defined in Table 4.15.1-1 of TS
23.502 [3].
NOTE 1: When the Analytics Reporting Parameters indicates a periodic reporting
mode and the periodicity of the report is equal to or greater than the
Supported Analytics Delay associated with the Analytics ID (if available)
defined in clause 6.2.6.2 of TS 23.501 [2], it is expected that the periodic
reporting can be provided by the NWDAF as requested.
\- (Only for Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe) Reporting Thresholds,
which indicate conditions on the level of each requested analytics that when
reached shall be notified by the NWDAF.
\- [OPTIONAL] Matching direction: A matching direction may be provided such as
below, above, or crossed. If no matching direction is provided, the default
direction is crossed.
\- [OPTIONAL] Acceptable deviation: An acceptable deviation from the threshold
level in the non-critical direction (i.e. in which the QoS is improving) may
be set to limit the amount of signalling.
\- Analytics target period: time interval [start..end], either in the past
(both start time and end time in the past) or in the future (both start time
and end time in the future). An Analytics target period in the past is a
request or subscription for statistics. An Analytics target period in the
future is a request or subscription for predictions. The time interval is
expressed with actual start time and actual end time (e.g. via UTC time). When
the Analytics Reporting Parameters indicate a periodic reporting mode, the
time interval can also be expressed as positive or negative offsets to the
reporting time, which indicates a subscription for predictions or statistics
respectively. By setting start time and end time to the same value, the
consumer of the analytics can request analytics or subscribe to analytics for
a specific time rather than for a time interval.
\- Time window for historical analytics: time interval [start..end]. The time
window for historical analytics indicates the time interval during which the
historical analytics was generated. If the time window for historical
analytics is included, the NWDAF only needs to provide the existing analytics,
and does not need to generate new analytics.
\- [OPTIONAL] Data time window: if specified, only events that have been
created in the specified time interval are considered for the analytics
generation.
\- [OPTIONAL] Preferred level of accuracy of the analytics (\"Low\",
\"Medium\", \"High\" or \"Highest\").
\- [OPTIONAL] Preferred level of accuracy per analytics subset (\"Low\",
\"Medium\", \"High\" or \"Highest\"). When a preferred level of accuracy is
expressed for a given analytics subset, it takes precedence for this subset
over the above preferred level of accuracy of the analytics. Analytics subsets
are defined in the \"Output Analytics\" clause of applicable analytics.
\- [OPTIONAL] Dataset Statistical Properties: information in order to
influence the data selection mechanisms to be used for the generation of an
Analytics ID, assuring that the generated Analytics ID reflects the
statistical characteristics of the data that are relevant for the NWDAF
consumer. The following dataset statistical properties are allowed:
\- Uniformly distributed datasets, which indicates the use of data samples
that are uniformly distributed according to the different aspects of the
requested analytics (e.g. equivalent data samples for each UE listed as a
Target of Analytics Reporting or for S-NSSAIs included in the Analytics Filter
Information).
\- Datasets with or without outliers, which indicates that the data samples
shall consider or disregard data samples that are at the extreme boundaries of
the value range.
\- Time when analytics information is needed (if applicable): indicates to the
NWDAF the latest time the analytics consumer expects to receive analytics data
provided by the NWDAF. It should not be set to a value less than the Supported
Analytics Delay of the selected NWDAF if applicable. If the time is reached
the consumer does not need to wait for the analytics information any longer,
yet the NWDAF may send an error response or error notification to the
consumer. \"Time when analytics information is needed\" is a relative time
interval as the gap with respect to analytics request /subscription (e.g. \"in
10 minutes\").
NOTE 2: If the analytics request contains the parameter \"Time when analytics
information is needed\" for Analytics ID(s), this parameter takes precedence
over the requested periodicity, if a periodic reporting mode is requested.
NOTE 3: If the Time when analytics information is needed is provided and it is
less than the Supported Analytics Delay per Analytics ID (if available)
defined in clause 6.2.6.2 of TS 23.501 [2], it is expected that the NWDAF
might not be able to treat the Analytics ID on time.
\- [OPTIONAL] Maximum number of objects requested by the consumer (max) to
limit the number of objects in a list of analytics per
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response.
\- [OPTIONAL] Preferred granularity of location information: TA level or cell
level.
\- [OPTIONAL] Preferred order of results when a list of analytics is returned,
possibly with a criterion for identifying the property of the results to which
the preferred ordering is applied.
\- [OPTIONAL] Maximum number of SUPIs (SUPImax) requested by the consumer to
limit the number of SUPIs in an object. When SUPImax is not provided, the
NWDAF shall return all SUPIs concerned by the analytics object. When SUPImax
is set to 0, the NWDAF shall not provide any SUPI.
\- [OPTIONAL] Output strategy: indicates the relevant factors for determining
when the analytics reported. The following values are allowed:
\- Binary output strategy: indicates that the analytics shall only be reported
when the preferred level of accuracy is reached within a cycle of periodic
notification as defined in the Analytics Reporting Parameters.
NOTE 4: If preferred level of accuracy is more important than providing an
output, then the binary strategy is used so that all analytics outputs have
equivalent confidence in the prediction.
\- Gradient output strategy: indicates that the analytics shall be reported
according with the periodicity defined in the Analytics Reporting Parameters
irrespective if the preferred level of accuracy has been reached.
NOTE 5: If having an analytics output is more important than reaching the
preferred level of accuracy, then the gradient output strategy is used so that
each NWDAF will timely provide the output indicating the confidence of the
prediction at the moment of the output generation.
NOTE 6: When no output strategy is included in the subscription, the analytics
output will be generated based on the gradient strategy and includes the
confidence of the prediction for the reporting period.
\- [OPTIONAL] Analytics metadata request: indicates a request from one NWDAF
to another NWDAF to provide the \"analytics metadata information\" related to
the produced output analytics. This input parameter indicates which parameters
in \"analytics metadata information\" are required to aggregate the output
analytics for the requested Analytics ID(s).
\- (Only for Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe) Consumer NF\'s serving
area or NF ID. During a pending analytics subscription transfer, this
information can be used by the NWDAF to find out if the analytics consumers
may change as described in clause 6.1B.2.
\- (Only for Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe) Information of previous
analytics subscription. When setting up the analytics generation, this
information may be used to retrieve analytics context from the previous NWDAF
in order to build upon the context that is already related to this
subscription as described in clause 6.1B.2.1.
The NWDAF provides to the consumer of the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify
or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request service operations described in clause 7, the
output information listed below:
\- (Only for Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify) The Notification Correlation
Information.
\- For each Analytics ID the analytics information in the requested Analytics
target period.
\- Timestamp of analytics generation: allows consumers to decide until when
the received information shall be used. For instance, an NF can deem a
received notification from NWDAF for a given feedback as invalid based on this
timestamp;
\- Validity period: defines the time period for which the analytics
information is valid.
NOTE 7: Validity period is determined by NWDAF internal logic and it is a
subset of Analytics target period.
\- Confidence: probability assertion, i.e. confidence in the prediction.
\- [OPTIONAL] For each Analytics ID the Termination Request, which notifies
the consumer that the subscription is requested to be cancelled as the NWDAF
can no longer serve this subscription, e.g. due to user consent revoked, NWDAF
overload, UE moved out of NWDAF serving area, etc.
\- [OPTIONAL] Analytics metadata information: additional information required
to aggregate the output analytics for the requested Analytics ID(s). This
parameter shall be provided if the \"Analytics metadata request\" parameter
was provided in the corresponding Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request service operation.
\- Number of data samples used for the generation of the output analytics;
\- Data time window of the data samples;
\- Dataset Statistical Properties of the analytics output used for the
generation of the analytics;
\- [OPTIONAL] Data source(s) of the data used for the generation of the output
analytics;
\- [OPTIONAL] Data Formatting and Processing applied on the data;
\- Output strategy used for the reporting of the analytics.
\- (Only for error response or error notification) Revised waiting time:
indicates to the consumer a revised waiting value for \"Time when analytics
information is needed\". Each NWDAF may include this as part of error response
or error notification to \"Time when analytics information is needed\" as
described in clause 6.2.5. Revised waiting time is the minimum time interval
recommended by NWDAF to use as \"Time when analytics information is needed\"
for similar future analytics requests/subscriptions.
### 6.1.4 Analytics Exposure using DCCF
#### 6.1.4.1 General
This clause specifies procedures for analytics exposure using DCCF services,
with two options: analytics can be exposed via DCCF, according to clauses
6.1.4.2 and 6.1.4.3, or can be exposed via a messaging framework according to
clauses 6.1.4.4 and 6.1.4.5. Which option to use is determined by DCCF
configuration.
#### 6.1.4.2 Analytics Exposure via DCCF
The procedure as depicted in Figure 6.1.4.2-1 is used by analytics consumer(s)
(e.g. NFs/OAM) to subscribe/unsubscribe to NWDAF analytics and be notified of
analytics information via the DCCF, using Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe
service operation. Whether a NWDAF service consumer directly contacts the
NWDAF or goes via the DCCF is based on NWDAF service consumer configuration.
Figure 6.1.4.2-1: Network data analytics subscription via DCCF
1\. Analytics consumer subscribes to analytics information via DCCF by
invoking the Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe (Nnwdaf service operation,
Analytics Specification, Formatting Instructions, Processing Instructions,
NWDAF (or NWDAF-Set) ID, ADRF Information) service operation. The analytics
consumer may specify one or more notification endpoints. Analytics consumer
decides to go via DCCF based on internal configuration. The \"Analytics
Specification\" provides Nnwdaf service operation specific parameters, e.g.
Analytics IDs, Target of Analytics Reporting and optional parameters used to
retrieve the analytics. The analytics consumer may provide the identity of the
NWDAF to collect analytics from. The analytics consumer may provide additional
information on possible notification endpoints or ADRF information so
analytics are archived.
2\. If the NWDAF instance or NWDAF Set is not identified by the analytics
Consumer, the DCCF determines the NWDAF instances that can provide analytics.
If the consumer requested storage of analytics in an ADRF but an ADRF ID is
not provided by the Analytics Consumer, or the collected analytics is to be
stored in an ADRF according to configuration on the DCCF, the DCCF selects an
ADRF to store the collected data.
3\. The DCCF determines whether the analytics requested in step 1 are already
being collected. If the requested analytics are already being collected by an
Analytics Consumer, the DCCF adds the new analytics consumer to the list of
analytics consumers that are subscribed for these analytics.
4\. If the analytics subscribed in step 1 partially matches an analytics that
is already being collected by the DCCF from an NWDAF and a modification of
this subscription to the NWDAF would satisfy both the existing analytics
subscriptions as well as the newly requested analytics, the DCCF invokes a
modification of the previous subscription via
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation (as specified in
clause 6.1.1.1) and the DCCF adds the analytics consumer to the list of
analytics consumers that are subscribed for these analytics.
If the analytics requested at step 1 are not already available or not being
collected yet, the DCCF subscribes to analytics from NWDAF using the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe procedure as specified in clause
6.1.1.1. The DCCF adds the analytics consumer to the list of analytics
consumers that are subscribed for these analytics.
5\. When new output analytics are available, the NWDAF notifies the analytics
information to the DCCF by invoking Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify
service operation.
6\. The DCCF uses Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify to send the analytics to all
notification endpoints indicated in step 1. Analytics sent to notification
endpoints may be processed and formatted by the DCCF so they conform to
delivery requirements for each analytics consumer or notification endpoint as
specified in clause 5A.4. The DCCF may store the analytics in the ADRF if
requested by the consumer or if required by DCCF configuration, using
procedure as specified in clause 6.2B.3.
NOTE: According to Formatting Instructions provided by the Analytics Consumer,
multiple notifications from a NWDAF can be combined in a single
Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify so many notifications from an NWDAF results in
fewer notifications (or one notification) to the Analytics Consumer.
Alternatively, a notification can instruct the analytics notification endpoint
to fetch the analytics from the DCCF.
7\. If a Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify contains a fetch instruction, the
notification endpoint sends a Ndccf_DataManagement_Fetch request to fetch the
analytics from the DCCF before an expiry time.
8\. The DCCF delivers the analytics to the notification endpoint.
9\. When the Analytics Consumer no longer wants analytics to be collected it
invokes Ndccf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe (Subscription Correlation ID), using
the Subscription Correlation Id received in response to its subscription in
step 1. The DCCF removes the analytics consumer from the list of analytics
consumers that are subscribed for these analytics.
10\. If there are no other Analytics Consumers subscribed to the analytics,
the DCCF unsubscribes with the NWDAF.
#### 6.1.4.3 Historical Analytics Exposure via DCCF
The procedure as depicted in Figure 6.1.4.3-1 is used by an analytics consumer
(e.g. NFs/OAM) to obtain historical analytics via the DCCF. Historical
analytics may be previously computed statistics or predictions stored in an
NWDAF or ADRF. Statistics may have been previously computed and stored in the
ADRF or NWDAF and can be identified by a \"target period\" in the past (see
clause 6.1.3). Requests for previously computed predictions have a \"Time
Window\", which specifies an allowable span for when the predictions may have
been computed. This allows the Analytics Consumer to request previously
computed predictions for a target period.
The analytics consumer requests analytics via the DCCF, using
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation. Whether the NWDAF service
consumer directly contacts the NWDAF/ADRF or goes via the DCCF is based on
configuration.
Figure 6.1.4.3-1: Historical Analytics Exposure via DCCF
1\. The analytics consumer requests analytics via DCCF by invoking the
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe (Nnwdaf service operation, Analytics
Specification, Time Window, Formatting Instructions, Processing Instructions,
ADRF ID or NWDAF ID (or ADRF Set ID or NWDAF Set ID) service operation as
specified in clause 8.2.2. The analytics consumer may specify one or more
notification endpoints to receive the analytics.
Parameter \"Nnwdaf service operation\" is the service operation used to
originally acquire the analytics and identifies this as a request for
analytics, \"Analytics Specification\" provides Nnwdaf service operation
specific parameters, e.g. Analytics IDs, Target of Analytics Reporting and
optional parameters used to retrieve the analytics. \"Time Window\" specifies
a past time period and comprises a start and stop time indicating when
predictions were computed and \"Formatting and Processing Instructions\" are
as defined in clause 5A.4. The analytics consumer may optionally include the
ADRF or NWDAF instance (or ADRF Set or NWDAF Set) ID where the stored
analytics resides.
2\. If an ADRF or NWDAF instance or ADRF or NWDAF Set ID is not provided by
the analytics consumer, the DCCF determines if any ADRF or NWDAF instances
might provide the analytics as described in clause 5A and clause 5B.
3\. (conditional) If the DCCF determines that an ADRF instance might provide
the analytics, or an ADRF instance or Set was supplied by the analytics
consumer, the DCCF sends a request to the ADRF, using
Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalSubscribe (Analytics Specification, Notification
Target Address=DCCF) service operation, as specified in clause 10.2. The ADRF
responds to the DCCF with an Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalSubscribe response
indicating if the ADRF can supply the analytics. If the analytics can be
provided, the procedure continues with step 5.
4\. (conditional) If the DCCF determines that an NWDAF instance might provide
the analytics or an NWDAF instance or Set was supplied by the Analytics
Consumer, the DCCF sends a request to the NWDAF using
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe as specified in clause 7.2.2.
5\. The ADRF uses Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalNotify or the NWDAF uses
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify to send the requested analytics (e.g. one
or more stored notifications archived from an NWDAF) to the DCCF. The
analytics may be sent in one or more notification messages.
6\. The DCCF uses Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify to send analytics to all
notification endpoints indicated in step 1. Notifications are sent to the
Notification Target Address(es) using the Analytics Consumer Notification
Correlation ID(s) received in step 1. Analytics sent to notification endpoints
may be processed and formatted by the DCCF, so they conform to delivery
requirements specified by the analytics consumer.
NOTE: According to Formatting Instructions provided by the analytics consumer,
multiple notifications from an ADRF or NWDAF can be combined in a single
Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify so many notifications from the ADRF or NWDAF
results in fewer notifications (or one notification) to the Analytics
Consumer. Alternatively, a Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify can instruct the
analytics notification endpoint to fetch the analytics from the DCCF before an
expiry time.
7\. If a notification contains a fetch instruction, the notification endpoint
sends a Ndccf_DataManagement_Fetch request as specified in clause 8.2.5 to
fetch the analytics from the DCCF.
8\. The DCCF delivers the analytics to the notification endpoint.
9\. When the analytics consumer no longer wants analytics to be collected or
has received all the analytics it needs, it invokes
Ndccf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe (Subscription Correlation ID), using the
Subscription Correlation Id received in response to its subscription in step
1.
10\. If the analytics are being provided by an ADRF and there are no other
analytics consumers subscribed to the analytics, the DCCF unsubscribes with
the ADRF using Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalUnsubscribe as specified in
clause 10.2.7.
11\. If the analytics are being provided by an NWDAF and there are no other
analytics consumers subscribed to the analytics, the DCCF unsubscribes with
the NWDAF using Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Unsubscribe service operation as
specified in clause 7.2.3.
#### 6.1.4.4 Analytics Exposure via Messaging Framework
The procedure as depicted in Figure 6.1.4.4-1 is used by analytics consumer(s)
(e.g. NFs/OAM) to subscribe/unsubscribe to NWDAF analytics and be notified of
analytics information, using Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation.
The 3GPP DCCF Adaptor (3da) Data Management service and 3GPP Consumer Adaptor
(3ca) Data Management service of the Messaging Framework Adaptor Function
(MFAF) are used to interact with the 3GPP Network and the Messaging Framework.
Whether a NWDAF service consumer directly contacts the NWDAF or goes via the
DCCF is based on NWDAF service consumer configuration.
Figure 6.1.4.4-1: Network data analytics subscription via DCCF
1\. Analytics consumer subscribes to analytics information via DCCF by
invoking the Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe (Nnwdaf service operation,
Analytics Specification, Formatting Instructions, Processing Instructions,
NWDAF (or NWDAF-Set) ID, ADRF Information, Analytics Consumer Notification
Target Address (+ Notification Correlation ID)) service operation. The
analytics consumer may specify one or more notification endpoints. Analytics
consumer decides to go via DCCF based on internal configuration. The
\"Analytics Specification\" provides Nnwdaf service operation specific
parameters, e.g. Analytics IDs, Target of Analytics Reporting and optional
parameters used to retrieve the analytics. The analytics consumer may provide
the identity of the NWDAF to collect analytics from. The analytics consumer
may provide additional information on possible notification endpoints or ADRF
information to archive analytics.
2\. If the NWDAF instance or NWDAF Set is not identified by the analytics
consumer, the DCCF determines the NWDAF instances that can provide analytics.
If the consumer requested storage of analytics in an ADRF but an ADRF ID is
not provided by the Analytics Consumer, or the collected analytics is to be
stored in an ADRF according to configuration on the DCCF, the DCCF selects an
ADRF to store the collected analytics.
3\. The DCCF determines whether the analytics requested in step 1 are already
being collected. If the requested analytics are already being collected by an
analytics consumer, the DCCF adds the new analytics consumer to the list of
analytics consumers that are subscribed for these analytics.
4\. The DCCF sends an Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure (Analytics Consumer
Information, MFAF Notification Information, Formatting Conditions, Processing
Instructions) to configure the MFAF to map notifications received from the
NWDAF to outgoing notifications sent to endpoints and to instruct the MFAF how
to format and process the outgoing notifications.
\"Analytics Consumer Information\" contains for each notification endpoint,
the analytics consumer Notification Target Address (+ Analytics Consumer
Notification Correlation ID) to be used by the MFAF when sending notifications
in step 7.
\"MFAF Notification Information\" is included if an NWDAF is already sending
the analytics to the MFAF. MFAF Notification Information identifies Event
Notifications received from the NWDAF and comprises the MFAF Notification
Target Address (+ MFAF Notification Correlation ID). If the MFAF does not
receive MFAF Notification information from the DCCF, the MFAF selects an MFAF
Notification Target Address (+ MFAF Notification Correlation ID) and sends the
MFAF Notification Information, containing the MFAF Notification Target Address
(+ MFAF Notification Correlation ID), to the DCCF in the
Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure Response.
5\. If the analytics subscribed in step 1 partially matches analytics that are
already being collected by the DCCF from a NWDAF and a modification of this
subscription to the NWDAF would satisfy both the existing analytics
subscriptions as well as the newly requested analytics, the DCCF invokes
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe (Subscription Correlation ID) with
parameters indicating how to modify the previous subscription (as specified in
clause 6.1.1.1). The DCCF adds the analytics consumer to the list of analytics
consumers that are subscribed for these analytics.
If the analytics requested at step 1 are not already available or not being
collected yet, the DCCF subscribes to analytics from the NF using
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe, setting the Notification Target
Address (+Notification Correlation ID)) to the MFAF Notification Target
Address (+ MFAF Notification Correlation ID) received in step 4. The DCCF adds
the analytics consumer to the list of analytics consumers that are subscribed
for these analytics.
6\. When new output analytics are available, the NWDAF uses
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify to send the analytics to the MFAF. The
Notification includes the MFAF Notification Correlation ID.
7\. The MFAF uses Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify to send the analytic to all
notification endpoints indicated in step 4. Notifications are sent to the
Notification Target Address(es) using the Analytics Consumer Notification
Correlation ID(s) received in step 4. Analytics sent to notification endpoints
may be processed and formatted by the MFAF, so they conform to delivery
requirements specified by the analytics consumer. The MFAF may store the
information in the ADRF if requested by consumer or if required by DCCF
configuration, using procedure as specified in clause 6.2B.3.
NOTE: According to Formatting Instructions provided by the Analytics Consumer,
multiple notifications from a NWDAF can be combined in a single
Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify, so many notifications from the NWDAF results
in fewer notifications (or one notification) to the analytics consumer.
Alternatively, a notification can instruct the analytics notification endpoint
to fetch the analytics from the MFAF before an expiry time.
8\. If a Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify contains a fetch instruction, the
notification endpoint sends a Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Fetch request to fetch
the analytics from the MFAF.
9\. The MFAF delivers the analytics to the notification endpoint.
10\. When the analytics consumer no longer wants analytics to be collected, it
invokes Ndccf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe (Subscription Correlation ID), using
the Subscription Correlation Id received in response to its subscription in
step 1. The DCCF removes the analytics consumer from the list of analytics
consumers that are subscribed for these analytics.
11\. If there are no other analytics consumers subscribed to the analytics,
the DCCF unsubscribes with the NWDAF.
12\. The DCCF de-configures the MFAF so it no longer maps notifications
received from the NWDAF to the notification endpoints configured in step 4.
#### 6.1.4.5 Historical Analytics Exposure via Messaging Framework
The procedure as depicted in Figure 6.1.4.5-1 is used by an analytics consumer
(e.g. NFs/OAM) to obtain historical analytics via the messaging framework.
Historical analytics may be previously computed statistics or predictions
stored in an NWDAF or ADRF. Statistics may be previously computed and stored
in the ADRF or NWDAF and can be identified by a \"target period\" in the past
(see clause 6.1.3). Requests for previously computed predictions have a \"Time
Window\", which specifies an allowable span for when the predictions may have
been computed. This allows the analytics consumer to request previously
computed predictions for a target period.
The analytics consumer requests analytics via the DCCF, using
Ndccf_DataManagement_Request service operation. Whether the NWDAF service
consumer directly contacts the NWDAF/ADRF, or goes via the DCCF is based on
configuration.
Figure 6.1.4.5-1: Historical Analytics Exposure via Messaging Framework
1\. The analytics consumer requests analytics via DCCF by invoking the
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe (Nnwdaf service operation, Analytics
Specification, Time Window, Formatting Instructions, Processing Instructions,
ADRF ID or NWDAF ID (or ADRF Set ID or NWDAF Set ID)). The analytics consumer
may specify one or more notification endpoints to receive the analytics.
2\. If an ADRF or NWDAF instance or ADRF or NWDAF Set ID is not provided by
the Analytics Consumer, the DCCF determines if any ADRF or NWDAF instances
might provide the analytics as described in clause 5A and clause 5B.
3\. The DCCF sends an Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure (Analytics Consumer
Information, Formatting Conditions, Processing Instructions) to configure the
MFAF to map notifications received from the ADRF or NWDAF to outgoing
notifications sent to endpoints and to instruct the MFAF how to format and
process the outgoing notifications.
\"Analytics Consumer Information\" contains for each notification endpoint,
the analytics consumer Notification Target Address (+ Analytics Consumer
Notification Correlation ID) to be used by the MFAF when sending
notifications. The MFAF selects an MFAF Notification Target Address (+ MFAF
Notification Correlation ID) and sends the MFAF Notification Information,
containing the MFAF Notification Target Address (+ MFAF Notification
Correlation ID), to the DCCF in the Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure
Response.
4\. (conditional) If the DCCF determines that an ADRF instance might provide
the analytics, or an ADRF instance or Set was supplied by the Analytics
Consumer, the DCCF sends a request to the ADRF, using
Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalSubscribe (Analytics Specification, MFAF
Notification Information) as specified in clause 10.2.6. The MFAF Notification
information contains the MFAF Notification Target Address (+ MFAF Notification
Correlation ID) received in step 3.
5\. The ADRF responds to the DCCF with an
Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalSubscribe response indicating if the ADRF can
supply the analytics. If the analytics can be provided, the procedure
continues with step 8.
6\. (conditional) If the DCCF determines that an NWDAF instance might provide
the analytics or an NWDAF instance or Set was supplied by the Analytics
Consumer, the DCCF sends a request to the NWDAF using
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe as specified in clause 7.2.2. The MFAF
Notification Information contains the MFAF Notification Target Address (+ MFAF
Notification Correlation ID) received in step 3.
7\. The NWDAF responds to the DCCF with an
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe response indicating if the NWDAF can
supply the analytics.
8\. The ADRF uses Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalNotify or the NWDAF uses
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify to send the requested analytics (e.g. one
or more stored notifications archived from an NWDAF) to the MFAF. The
analytics may be sent in one or more notification messages.
9\. The MFAF uses Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify to send analytics to all
notification endpoints indicated in step 3. Notifications are sent to the
Notification Target Address(es) using the Analytics Consumer Notification
Correlation ID(s) received in step 3. Analytics sent to notification endpoints
may be processed and formatted by the DCCF, so they conform to delivery
requirements specified by the analytics consumer.
NOTE: According to Formatting Instructions provided by the Analytics Consumer,
multiple notifications from an ADRF or NWDAF can be combined in a single
Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify so many notifications from the ADRF or NWDAF
results in fewer notifications (or one notification) to the Analytics
Consumer. Alternatively, a Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify can instruct the
analytics notification endpoint to fetch the analytics from the DCCF before an
expiry time.
10\. If a notification contains a fetch instruction, the notification endpoint
sends a Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Fetch request as specified in clause 9.3.3 to
fetch the analytics from the MFAF.
11\. The DCCF delivers the analytics to the notification endpoint.
12\. When the analytics consumer no longer wants analytics to be collected or
has received all the analytics it needs, it invokes
Ndccf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe (Subscription Correlation ID) as specified in
clause 8.2.3, using the Subscription Correlation Id received in response to
its subscription in step 1.
13\. If the analytics are being provided by an ADRF and there are no other
analytics consumers subscribed to the analytics, the DCCF invokes
Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalUnsubscribe as specified in clause 10.2.7 to
unsubscribe from the ADRF.
14\. If the analytics are being provided by an NWDAF and there are no other
analytics consumers subscribed to the analytics, the DCCF invokes
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Unsubscribe service operation as specified in
clause 7.2.3 to unsubscribe from the NWDAF
15\. The DCCF de-configures the MFAF so it no longer maps notifications
received from the NWDAF to the notification endpoints configured in step 3.
## 6.1A Analytics aggregation from multiple NWDAFs
### 6.1A.1 General
In a multiple NWDAF deployment scenario, an NWDAF instance may be specialized
to provide Analytics for one or more Analytics IDs. Each of the NWDAF
instances may serve a certain Area of Interest or TAI(s). Multiple NWDAFs may
collectively serve the particular Analytics ID. An NWDAF may have the
capability to support the aggregation of Analytics (per Analytics ID) received
from other NWDAFs, possibly with Analytics generated by itself.
The procedure for analytics aggregation from multiple NWDAFs is as defined in
clause 6.1A.3.
### 6.1A.2 Analytics Aggregation
The analytics aggregation from multiple NWDAFs is used to address cases where
an NWDAF service consumer requests Analytics ID(s) that requires multiple
NWDAFs to collectively serve the request. Analytic aggregation applies to
scenarios where NWDAF service consumer requests or subscribes to analytics
information with or without provisioning Area of Interest.
Aggregator NWDAF or aggregation point:
\- Is an NWDAF instance with additional capabilities to aggregate output
analytics provided by other NWDAFs. This is in addition to regular NWDAF
behaviour such as collecting data from other data sources to be able to
generate its own output analytics.
\- Is able to divide the area of interest, if received from the consumer, into
sub area of interest based on the serving area of each NWDAF to be requested
for analytics and then send analytics requests including the sub area of
interest as an Analytics Filter to corresponding NWDAFs. The Aggregator NWDAF
may maintain information on the discovered NWDAFs, including their supported
Analytics IDs, NWDAF Serving Areas, etc.
\- Has \"analytics aggregation capability\" registered in its NF Profile
within the NRF.
\- Supports the requesting and exchange of \"Analytics Metadata Information\"
between NWDAFs when required for the aggregation of output analytics.
\"Analytics Metadata Information\" is additional information associated with
the requested Analytics ID(s) as defined in clause 6.1.3.
\- Supports dataset statistical properties, output strategy and data time
window parameters per type of analytics (i.e. Analytics ID) as defined in
clause 6.1.3.
NRF:
\- Stores the NF Profile of the NWDAF instances, including \"analytics
aggregation capability\" for Aggregator NWDAFs and \"analytics metadata
provisioning capability\" when supported by the NWDAF.
\- Returns the NWDAF(s) matching the attributes provided in the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request, as specified in clause 5.2.7.3 of TS 23.502 [3].
NWDAF service consumer:
\- Requests or subscribes to receive analytics for one or more Analytics IDs,
as specified in clause 6.1 of the present document.
\- Uses the discovery mechanism from NRF as defined in clause 6.3.13 of TS
23.501 [2] to identify NWDAFs with analytics aggregation capability and other
capabilities (e.g. providing data/analytics for specific TAI(s)).
\- Can differentiate and select the preferred NWDAF in case multiple NWDAFs
are returned in the NWDAF discovery response based on its internal selection
criteria (considering the registered NWDAF capabilities and information in NRF
or UDM).
### 6.1A.3 Procedure for analytics aggregation
#### 6.1A.3.1 Procedure for analytics aggregation with Provision of Area of
Interest
The procedure depicted in figure 6.1A.3-1 is used to address cases where an
NWDAF service consumer requests Analytics ID(s) for an Area of Interest that
requires multiple NWDAFs that collectively serve the request.
Figure 6.1A.3.1-1: Procedure for analytics aggregation
1a-b. NWDAF service consumer discovers the NWDAF as specified in clause 5.2.
When NRF is used, NRF may return multiple NWDAF candidates matching the
requested capabilities, area of interest and supported Analytics ID(s). NWDAF
service consumer selects an NWDAF (e.g. NWDAF1) with analytics aggregation
capability (i.e. Aggregator NWDAF), based on its internal selection criteria,
considering registered NWDAF capabilities and information in NRF including the
Supported Analytics Delay per Analytics ID (if available).
2\. NWDAF service consumer invokes Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation from the selected
Aggregator NWDAF (e.g. NWDAF1). In the request, NWDAF service consumer
provides Analytics ID(s) (e.g. Analytics ID 1) Analytics Filter Information
(area of interest, e.g. TAI-1, TAI-2, TAI-n, if known to the NWDAF service
consumer), Target of Analytics Reporting (e.g. a single UE, a group of UEs or
any UE). It may also provide \"time when analytics information is needed\"
(e.g. T1). It is expected that T1 is equal or greater than the Supported
Analytics Delay per Analytics ID (if available) of the Aggregator NWDAF.
Otherwise, the aggregator NWDAF may reject the analytics request or analytics
subscription.
3\. On receiving the request in step 2, Aggregator NWDAF (e.g. NWDAF1), based
on e.g. configuration, queries to NRF including the Real-Time Communication
Indication per Analytics ID and queries to UDM for checking which NWDAF(s) is
serving the Target of Analytics Reporting. Considering the request from the
NWDAF service consumer (e.g. Analytics Filter Information, T1, etc.) and
Supported Delay per Analytics ID per NWDAF instance (when Real-Time
Communication Indication was included), Aggregator NWDAF determines the other
NWDAF instances that collectively can cover the area of interest indicated in
the request (e.g. TAI-1, TAI-2, TAI-n).
NOTE 1: In the discovery request sent to NRF, Aggregator NWDAF might indicate
\"analytics metadata provisioning capability\" (e.g. as query parameter),
thus, requesting to NRF to reply back with, if available, those NWDAF
instance(s) which also supports \"analytics metadata provisioning capability\"
functionality as indicated during particular NWDAF instance registration
procedure.
4-5. Aggregator NWDAF (e.g. NWDAF1) invokes Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation from each of the
NWDAFs discovered/determined in step 3 (e.g. NWDAF2 and NWDAF3).
The request may optionally indicate \"analytics metadata request\" parameter
to the determined NWDAFs (e.g. NWDAF-2 and/or NWDAF3), when analytics metadata
is supported by these NWDAFs.
The request or subscription to the determined NWDAFs (e.g. NWDAF2 and/or
NWDAF3) may also include the dataset statistical properties, output strategy
and data time window. This indicates to the determined NWDAFs that the
Analytics ID output shall be generated based on such parameters when
requested.
If \"time when analytics information is needed\" (T1) was provided in step 2,
the Aggregator NWDAF shall also provide a \"time when analytics information is
needed\" to the determined NWDAFs, with a smaller value compared with T1 (e.g.
T2).
NOTE 2: T2 in step 4-5 is smaller than T1 accounting for the analytics delay
and processing time within the Aggregator NWDAF itself.
6-7a-b. The determined NWDAFs (e.g. NWDAF-2 and/or NWDAF3) reply or notify
with the requested output analytics.
If \"analytics metadata request\" was included in the request received by such
NWDAF (in steps 4-5), the NWDAF additionally returns the \"analytics metadata
information\" used for generating the analytics output as defined in clause
6.1.3.
If the determined NWDAFs (e.g. NWDAF 2 and/or NWDAF 3) cannot reply or notify
with the requested output analytics before the expiry of T2, they may send an
error response or error notification to the Aggregator NWDAF including a
\"revised waiting time\".
8\. Aggregator NWDAF (e.g. NWDAF1) aggregates received Analytics information,
i.e. generates a single output analytics based on the multiple analytics
outputs and, optionally, the \"analytics metadata information\" received from
the determined NWDAFs (e.g. NWDAF2 and NWDAF3).
The Aggregator NWDAF (e.g. NWDAF1) may also take its own analytics for TAI-n
into account for the analytics aggregation.
9a-b. Aggregator NWDAF (e.g. NWDAF1) sends a response or notifies to the NWDAF
service consumer the aggregated output analytics for the requested Analytics
ID.
If the Aggregator NWDAF (e.g. NWDAF 1) cannot reply or notify with the
requested output analytics before the expiry of T1 or anticipates that it
cannot reply or notify with the requested output analytics before the expiry
of T1 (e.g. due to error notification in step 6-7a-b), it may send an error
response or error notification to the NWDAF service consumer including a
\"revised waiting time\". The NWDAF service consumer may optionally use the
\"revised waiting time\" to update the \"time when analytics information is
needed\" parameter (i.e. T1) for future analytics requests/subscriptions to
the same Aggregator NWDAF as defined in clause 6.2.5.2.
#### 6.1A.3.2 Procedure for Analytics Aggregation without Provision of Area of
Interest
The procedure depicted in Figure 6.1A.3.2-1 is used to address cases where an
NWDAF service consumer requests Analytics ID(s) without providing an Area of
Interest, but requires multiple NWDAFs to collectively serve the request.
Figure 6.1A.3.2-1: Procedure for analytics aggregation without provision of
Area of Interest
1\. This step is a NWDAF discovery procedure without providing any area of
interest. The service consumer discovers an aggregation NWDAF (e.g. NWDAF1) as
specified in clause 5.2. When NRF is used, NRF may return multiple NWDAF
candidates matching the requested capabilities and supported Analytics ID(s).
Depending on the requested Analytics ID, the NWDAF service consumer, e.g.
based on internal logic, can be able to determine which NWDAF should be
selected for providing the required data analytics. If not, the NWDAF service
consumer should select a NWDAF with large serving area from the candidate
NWDAFs which supports analytics aggregation, e.g. NWDAF1.
2\. NWDAF service consumer sends Analytics information or analytics
subscription request to the aggregator NWDAF, i.e. NWDAF1 in the Figure
6.1A.3.2-1. In the request, NWDAF service consumer provides the requested
Analytics ID(s), e.g. Analytics ID 1.
The NWDAF service consumer may also provide \"time when analytics information
is needed\" (e.g. T1). It is expected that T1 is equal or greater than the
Supported Analytics Delay per Analytics ID of the Aggregator NWDAF (if
available). Otherwise, the aggregator NWDAF may reject the analytics request
or analytics subscription.
Once receiving the request, the Aggregator NWDAF1 may decide to subscribe data
analytics from other NWDAF instances which can provide the requested data
analytics. Based on the Analytics ID, there are two cases for the Aggregator
NWDAF1 to subscribe data analytics from other NWDAF instances.
3a. If the data analytics requires UE location information, e.g. for the
Analytics IDs \"UE Mobility\", \"Abnormal behaviour\", or \"User Data
Congestion\", then:
\- 3a-1: (optional) The Aggregator NWDAF1 queries UDM to discover the NWDAF
serving the UE, if it is supported.
\- 3a-2: If step 3a-1 is not supported, was not executed, or did not return a
suitable NWDAF serving the UE, the Aggregator NWDAF1 determines the AMF
serving the UE as specified in the clause 6.2.2.1, then requests UE location
information from the AMF to be used in the query to NRF in step 4.
NOTE: If an Aggregator NWDAF receives an Analytics request for a group of UEs,
i.e. the Target of Analytics Reporting set to an Internal Group ID, it
performs NWDAF discovery based on location information of all UEs in the group
and then requests all discovered NWDAFs to provide the required analytics.
3b. If the data analytics does not require to collect UE location information,
e.g. for the Analytics IDs \"Service Experience\", \"NF load information\", or
\"UE Communication\", the Aggregator NWDAF1 can determine the NFs to be
contacted for data collection as specified in clause 6.2.2.1 and then it can
retrieve NF service area for each of the data source NF from NRF.
4\. (conditional) With the data obtained in step 3, the Aggregator NWDAF1
queries the NRF for discovering the required NWDAF, by sending an NF discovery
request including UE location (e.g. TAI-1) or NF serving area (e.g. TAI
list-1) as a filter to NRF and obtains candidates target NWDAF(s) that can
provide the required analytics. This step is skipped if a suitable NWDAF was
discovered in step 3a-1. Additionally the Aggregator NWDAF1 may include in the
NF discovery request the Real-Time Communication Indication per Analytics ID
to request Supported Delay per Analytics ID per NWDAF instance.
Depending on the discovered NWDAF instance(s), there can be two cases:
5a. If a single target NWDAF (e.g. NWDAF2) can provide the requested analytics
data, the Aggregator NWDAF (e.g. NWDAF1) can redirect the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request to that target NWDAF or request an analytics
subscription transfer to that target NWDAF, depending on the type of the
analytics request/subscription received by the NWDAF Service Consumer.
5b. If the Aggregator NWDAF decides to request data analytics from one or more
target NWDAFs, the steps 4-9 of the analytics aggregation procedure in clause
6.1A.3.1 are executed.
## 6.1B Transfer of analytics context and analytics subscription
### 6.1B.1 General
In a multiple NWDAFs deployment scenario, procedures for transfer of analytics
context and analytics subscription can be used to support the target NWDAF to
produce the needed analytics.
When the analytics consumer provides the target NWDAF with information on the
subscription that could be transferred from the source NWDAF, the target NWDAF
may initiate the transfer of analytics context. The analytics consumer
provides the information via Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service
operation. When the analytics consumer is an AMF, the old subscription
information (if related to a UE) may be provided by the source AMF to the
target AMF using a UE context transfer procedure as specified in TS 23.502
[3].
An analytics subscription transfer to the target NWDAF may be initiated by the
source NWDAF, followed by an analytics context transfer initiated by the
target NWDAF. An NWDAF may transfer one or more of its analytics subscriptions
to another NWDAF instance due to internal (e.g. load balancing, graceful
shutdown) or external triggers (e.g. UE mobility). For external triggers, the
NWDAF may subscribe to NF(s) to be notified about the corresponding events. As
for UE mobility, upon the UE location change event notified by the AMF
subscribed by the NWDAF, the NWDAF determines whether it can continue to
provide the analytics service. If the NWDAF cannot continue to serve the
consumer, it should either select a target NWDAF and initiate analytics
subscription transfer, or notify the analytics consumer that it cannot provide
the service anymore, so that the analytics consumer can select a new NWDAF.
Procedures for analytics subscription transfer allow one NWDAF instance to
transfer its ongoing analytics subscriptions to another NWDAF instance. The
transfer can be done for all subscriptions or just a selected subset of
subscriptions related to specific area(s), specific Analytics ID(s), specific
NF(s) and/or specific UE(s).
The procedure for prepared analytics subscription transfer can be used if the
source NWDAF instance anticipates that it will soon not be able to continue
its current analytics tasks.
### 6.1B.2 Analytics Transfer Procedures
#### 6.1B.2.1 Analytics context transfer initiated by target NWDAF selected by
the NWDAF service consumer
The procedure in Figure 6.1B.2.1-1 is used when an NF decides to select a new
NWDAF instance due to internal or external triggers, e.g. the NF starts
serving a UE with analytics subscription information received upon UE context
transfer procedure as described in TS 23.502 [3], or the NF starts to request
NF related analytics, or the NF receives a \"Termination Request\" for an
existing analytics subscription from an NWDAF. The NF sends to the target
NWDAF information about the NWDAF previously used for analytics subscription,
if available, in Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation. The
target NWDAF may initiate the transfer of the analytics context, using the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_ContextTransfer or Nnf_DataManagement_Subscribe service
operation.
The procedure in Figure 6.1B.2.1-1 is also used when an Aggregator NWDAF
decides to select a new NWDAF to request output analytics for analytics
aggregation. For example, upon receiving a Termination Request from one of the
NWDAFs that are collectively serving a request for analytics subscription as
specified in clause 6.1A, the Aggregator NWDAF queries the NRF or UDM to
select a target NWDAF as specified in clause 6.1A.3 using information e.g. the
UE location, the 5GC NFs (identified by their NF Set IDs or NF types) serving
the UE or to be contacted for data collection (if Area of Interest is not
provisioned for the requested analytics), or the subset of AoI (if Area of
Interest is provisioned for the requested analytics). Then, the Aggregator
NWDAF sends information about the NWDAF previously used for analytics
subscription, if available, in Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service
operation towards the selected target NWDAF.
Figure 6.1B.2.1-1: Analytics context transfer initiated by target NWDAF
selected by the NWDAF service consumer
1\. The NWDAF service consumer determines to select an NWDAF instance. The
consumer discovers and selects the target NWDAF as specified in clause 5.2.
2\. The consumer sends a request for analytics subscription to the target
NWDAF using Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation,
including information on the previous analytics subscription (i.e. NWDAF ID,
Analytics ID(s), SUPIs, Analytics Filter Information for UE-related Analytics
and Subscription Correlation ID) which relates to the requested analytics
subscription, if available. If the target NWDAF accepts the analytics
subscription request, it sends Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe response
with a Subscription Correlation ID.
If the target NWDAF does not receive information of previous analytics
subscription in step 2, for UE related Analytics, the target NWDAF may
discover previously used NWDAF in UDM as specified in clause 5.2.
NOTE 1: If the selected target NWDAF instance is the same as the source NWDAF
instance (as received from the other consumer in step 0), the target NWDAF
will update the existing analytics subscription to the new analytics consumer.
Following steps are skipped.
NOTE 2: The consumer can provide information on the previous analytics
subscription when, e.g. the consumer is an AMF and it received information
from the old AMF, see clause 5.2.2.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
3a. [Option 1] If the target NWDAF decides to request an analytics context
transfer from the previously used NWDAF, it may make use of information sent
in step 2 (e.g. the provided Subscription Correlation ID) and use the
analytics context transfer procedure as specified in clause 6.1B.3. The target
NWDAF may receive an ADRF ID or DCCF ID for collecting the historical data
and/or analytics.
3b-c. [Option 2] If the target NWDAF decides to only request historical data
and/or analytics, then it may collect the data and/or analytics via
Nnf_DataManagement_Subscribe service, where the NFs may be either the ADRF,
NWDAF or DCCF, as described in clauses 10.2.6, 7.4.2 and 8.2.2 respectively.
Target NWDAF is now ready to generate analytics information taking into
account the information received in step 3.
4\. [Optional] Source NWDAF may purge analytics context after completion of
step 3a, if performed and if not already done, unsubscribes from the data
source(s) and/or model source(s) that are no longer needed for the remaining
analytics subscriptions.
5\. [Optional] Target NWDAF may subscribe to relevant data source(s) and/or
model source(s), if it is not yet subscribed to the data source(s) and/or
model source(s).
#### 6.1B.2.2 Analytics Subscription Transfer initiated by source NWDAF
The procedure in Figure 6.1B.2.2-1 is used by an NWDAF instance to request the
transfer of analytics subscription(s) to another NWDAF instance, using the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Transfer service operation defined in clause
7.2.5.
If the source NWDAF discovers that the analytics consumer may change
concurrently to this procedure, the source NWDAF should not perform the
procedure. In such a case, the source NWDAF may send a message to indicate to
the analytics consumer that it will not serve this subscription anymore.
NOTE 1: To discover the possible change of analytics consumer, if the
Analytics ID is UE related, the source NWDAF takes actions responding to
external trigger (such as UE mobility), for example, checking if the Target of
Analytics Reporting is still within the serving area of the analytics
consumer, if the serving area information is available.
NOTE 2: Handling of overload situation or preparation for a graceful shutdown
are preferably executed inside an NWDAF Set, when available, therefore, not
requiring an analytics subscription transfer as described in this clause. The
procedure in Figure 6.1B.2.2-1 is applicable for analytics subscription
transfer across NF Sets or if the NWDAF is not deployed in a Set.
Figure 6.1B.2.2-1: Analytics subscription transfer initiated by source NWDAF
0\. The analytics consumer subscribes to analytics from source NWDAF. The
analytics consumer may send its NF ID or serving area, enabling NWDAF to
determine whether the following analytics subscription transfer procedure is
applicable. Optionally the source NWDAF subscribes to UE mobility events.
1\. [Optional] Source NWDAF determines, e.g. triggered by a UE mobility event
notification, to prepare an analytics subscription transfer to target
NWDAF(s), as specified in the procedure illustrated in clause 6.1B.2.3.
2\. Source NWDAF determines, e.g. based on the UE location information
received and the analytics consumer\'s serving area either directly received
in step 0 or indirectly received via NRF, to perform an analytics subscription
transfer to target NWDAF(s). Therefore, the source NWDAF determines the
analytics subscription(s) to be transferred to a target NWDAF.
3\. Source NWDAF performs an NWDAF discovery and selects the target NWDAF.
NWDAF discovery may be skipped if the target NWDAF had already been discovered
as part of a prepared analytics subscription transfer. In the case of
aggregated analytics from multiple NWDAFs, the source NWDAF may use the set of
NWDAF identifiers related to aggregated analytics (see clause 6.1.3) to
preferably select a target NWDAF that is already serving the consumer.
4\. Source NWDAF requests, using Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Transfer Request
service operation, a transfer of the analytics subscription(s) determined in
step 2 to the target NWDAF. The request contains a callback URI of the
analytics consumer. The request may also contain active data source ID(s) and
ML model related information, which are related to the analytics subscriptions
requested to be transferred, if not already provided as part of the prepared
analytics subscription transfer in the preparation procedure (see step 1). The
ML model related information contains the ID(s) of NWDAF(s) containing MTLF
that provided the trained models and may contain the file address(es) of the
trained ML model(s), where the file address(es) of the trained ML model(s) is
included only when the source NWDAF itself provides the trained ML model(s)
for the analytics subscription(s) being transferred. The request message may
also include \"analytics context identifier(s)\" indicating the availability
of analytics context for particular Analytics ID(s).
5\. Target NWDAF accepts the analytics subscription transfer and takes over
the analytics generation based on the information received from the source
NWDAF.
Target NWDAF may use the ML model related information, if provided in the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Transfer request. If the ID(s) of NWDAF(s)
containing MTLF is provided in the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Transfer
request and the NWDAF(s) containing MTLF is part of the locally configured set
of NWDAFs containing MTLF, target NWDAF may request or subscribe to the ML
model(s) from the indicated NWDAF(s) containing MTLF as specified in clause
6.2A and use the ML model(s) for the transferred analytics subscription. If
the file address(es) of the trained ML model(s) is provided and if the NWDAF
containing MTLF is part of the locally configured set of NWDAFs containing
MTLF, the target NWDAF may retrieve the ML model using the file address of the
trained ML model. If the provided ID(s) of NWDAF(s) containing MTLF are not
part of the locally configured set of ID(s) of NWDAFs containing MTLF, the
target NWDAF discovers the NWDAF(s) supporting MTLF that can provide trained
ML model(s) for the Analytics ID(s) as described in clause 5.2.
NOTE 3: If not yet done during a prepared analytics subscription transfer, the
target NWDAF allocates a new Subscription Correlation ID to the received
analytics subscriptions.
NOTE 4: The target NWDAF might already have received information on some/all
of the analytics subscriptions as part of the prepared analytics subscription
transfer request received in step 1 and, thus, might already have started to
prepare for the analytics generation, e.g. by having already subscribed to
relevant event notifications.
6\. Target NWDAF informs the analytics consumer about the successful analytics
subscription transfer using a Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify message. A
new Subscription Correlation ID, which was assigned by the target NWDAF, is
provided in the Subscription Correlation ID and the old Subscription
Correlation Id, which was allocated by the source NWDAF, is provided in the
Subscription Change Notification Correlation ID parameter of this message as
specified in clause 7.2.4.
NOTE 5: Notification correlation information in the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify message allows the analytics consumer to
correlate the notifications to the initial subscription request made with the
source NWDAF in step 0.
NOTE 6: The existing Analytics context in the source NWDAF is not deleted
directly but will be purged first when it was collected by the target NWDAF.
NOTE 7: If this subscription is used as input for analytics aggregation by the
analytics consumer, the analytics consumer might inform the other NWDAFs
instance participating in this analytics aggregation that the Set of NWDAF
identifiers of NWDAF instances used by the NWDAF service consumer for this
analytics aggregation (see clause 6.1.3) has changed using the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation.
7\. [Conditional] If \"analytics context identifier(s)\" had been included in
the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Transfer Request received in step 4, the
target NWDAF requests the \"analytics context\". The analytics context
transfer procedure is specified in clause 6.1B.3.
8\. [Optional] Target NWDAF subscribes to relevant data source(s), if it is
not yet subscribed to the data source(s) for the data required for the
Analytics.
9\. Target NWDAF confirms the analytics subscription transfer to the source
NWDAF.
10\. [Optional] Source NWDAF unsubscribes with the data source(s) that are no
longer needed for the remaining analytics subscriptions. In addition, Source
NWDAF unsubscribes with the NWDAF(s) containing MTLF, if exist, which are no
longer needed for the remaining analytics subscriptions.
NOTE 8: At this point, the analytics subscription transfer is deemed
completed, i.e. the source NWDAF can delete all information related to the
successfully transferred analytics subscription.
11-12. Target NWDAF at some point derives new output analytics based on new
input data and notifies the analytics consumer about the new analytics using a
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify message as specified in clause 6.1.1.
#### 6.1B.2.3 Prepared analytics subscription transfer
The procedure in Figure 6.1B.2.3-1 is used by an NWDAF instance to request
another NWDAF instance for a prepared analytics subscription transfer from the
source NWDAF instance, using the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Transfer service
operation defined in clause 7.2.5.
NOTE 1: The source NWDAF might determine that it needs to prepare to transfer
analytics to another NWDAF instance, e.g. when the source NWDAF estimates for
UE related analytics subscription that the UE might enter an area which is not
covered by the source NWDAF (e.g. by subscribing to AMF event exposure service
for UE mobility event notifications, by performing UE mobility analytics, or
by subscribing to another NWDAF providing UE mobility analytics). If the
source NWDAF discovers that the analytics consumer may change concurrently to
this procedure, the source NWDAF does not perform the procedure. If the
procedure makes use of predictions to determine the candidate NWDAFs, care
must be taken with regards to load and signalling cost when sending data to an
NWDAF that will not eventually start serving the UE.
NOTE 2: The source NWDAF might also determine that it needs to prepare to
transfer analytics subscriptions to another NWDAF instance, as the source
NWDAF wants to resolve an internal load situation or prepare for a graceful
shutdown.
NOTE 3: Handling of overload situation or preparation for a graceful shutdown
are preferably executed inside an NWDAF Set, when available.
Figure 6.1B.2.3-1: Prepared analytics transfer
0\. Analytics consumer subscribes to the source NWDAF for certain analytics as
specified in clause 6.1.1.
0a. Source NWDAF starts data collection from relevant data source(s) (e.g. NFs
or OAM) as specified in clause 6.2. Source NWDAF starts generating requested
analytics.
0b. [Conditional] (Only if the source NWDAF does not serve the whole PLMN and
the requested analytics involves UE related data) The source NWDAF subscribes,
using Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation, to receive notifications
on UE mobility events from AMF.
1\. The source NWDAF determines that it needs to prepare to transfer analytics
to another NWDAF instance.
2\. The source NWDAF discovers candidate target NWDAF instances (e.g. NWDAFy
and NWDAFz) supporting the requested analytics information for the predicted
target area(s). NWDAF discovery and selection is specified in clause 6.3.13 of
TS 23.501 [2]. In the case of aggregated analytics from multiple NWDAFs, the
source NWDAF may use the set of NWDAF identifiers related to aggregated
analytics (see clause 6.1.3) to preferably select a target NWDAF that is
already serving the consumer.
NOTE 4: In this procedure, NWDAFy and NWDAFz are examples for target NWDAF
instances that are candidates to take over those analytic subscriptions.
3-4. In the case of a prepared analytics subscription transfer, the source
NWDAF requests, using Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Transfer Request, to the
candidate target NWDAFs (e.g. NWDAFy and NWDAFz) to prepare for an analytics
subscription transfer by including a \"prepared analytics subscription
transfer indication\" in the request message. The request message includes
information on the analytics subscriptions to be transferred. The request
message may also include \"analytics context identifier(s)\" indicating the
availability of analytics context for particular Analytics ID(s).
The candidate target NWDAFs (e.g. NWDAFy and NWDAFz) respond to the request
from the source NWDAF using a Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Transfer Response
message.
5-6. [Conditional] If \"analytics context identifier(s)\" had been included in
the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Transfer Request received in step 4, the
determined target NWDAFs (e.g. NWDAFy and NWDAFz) may request the \"analytics
context\" from the source NWDAF by invoking the
\"Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_ContextTransferservice\" operation. The analytics
context transfer procedure is specified in clause 6.1B.3.
NOTE 5: The target NWDAFs (e.g. NWDAFy and NWDAFz) can allocate a new
Subscription Correlation ID to the received analytics subscriptions.
7\. [Optional] Based on the information received from the source NWDAF, the
target NWDAFs (e.g. NWDAFy and NWDAFz) start data collection from NFs or OAM
(as specified in clause 6.2) and analytics generation for the indicated
analytics subscriptions.
NOTE 6: After step 7, the source NWDAF initiates the analytics subscription
transfer to the target NWDAF as specified in steps 4 to 12 of the analytics
subscription transfer procedure illustrated in Figure 6.1B.2.2-1.
8\. The source NWDAF cancels the prepared analytics subscription transfer to a
candidate target NWDAF (e.g. NWDAFz), using
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Transfer Request include an \"analytics
subscription transfer cancel indication\". The target NWDAF (e.g. NWDAFz)
confirms the cancelation to the source NWDAF and, if applicable, deletes any
analytics data that is no longer needed. If the target NWDAF (e.g. NWDAFz), as
part of the analytics subscription preparation, had already subscribed to
entities to collect data or acquire ML model, it unsubscribes to those
entities if the subscriptions are not needed for other active analytics
subscriptions with the target NWDAF.
Step 8 may take place any time after step 4 if the NWDAF determines that the
candidate target NWDAF (e.g. NWDAFz) does no longer need to prepare for the
analytics subscription transfer. In particular, the source NWDAF shall cancel
the prepared analytics subscription transfer to all remaining candidate target
NWDAFs after one target NWDAF has accepted the analytics subscription transfer
(see NOTE 6).
### 6.1B.3 Analytics Context Transfer
The procedure depicted in Figure 6.1B.3-1 is used by an NWDAF instance to
request analytics context from another NWDAF instance, using the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_ContextTransfer service operation as defined in clause
7.3.3. This procedure, for example, can be invoked in the procedures described
in clause 6.1B.2 to request the transfer of relevant analytics context.
Figure 6.1B.3-1: Analytics Context Transfer
The procedure of analytics context information transfer comprises the
following steps:
1\. The consumer NWDAF requests analytics context by invoking
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_ContextTransfer request service operation. The parameters
that can be provided in the request are listed in clause 6.1B.4.
2\. The provider NWDAF responds with analytics context to the consumer NWDAF.
The analytics context that can be provided in the response is listed in clause
6.1B.4.
If the provider NWDAF stores analytics context (i.e. Historical output
Analytics and/or Data related to Analytics) in ADRF, the provider NWDAF may
include in the response the ADRF ID together with an indication of the
Analytics Context Type stored in the ADRF (i.e. Historical output Analytics
and/or Data related to Analytics).
Upon receiving the analytics context, the consumer NWDAF may:
\- provide the pending output analytics or historical analytics information to
the analytics consumer per the subscription/request;
\- use the historical data and analytics metadata in the analytics context to
generate analytics;
\- subscribe to data collected for analytics with the data sources indicated
in the analytics context;
\- if the ID(s) of the NWDAF(s) containing MTLF indicated in the analytics
context is part of the locally configured (set of) IDs of NWDAFs containing
MTLF, retrieve trained ML model(s) from the indicated NWDAF(s) containing MTLF
or based on the file address(es) of the trained ML model(s) and use for
analytics; and/or
\- subscribe to output analytics from the indicated NWDAFs that collectively
serve the transferred analytics subscription and perform analytics aggregation
on the output analytics using the analytics metadata information, based on the
analytics subscription aggregation information.
### 6.1B.4 Contents of Analytics Context
The Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_ContextTransfer service operation is used to transfer
analytics context from a source NWDAF instance to a target NWDAF instance,
whereby the target NWDAF consumes the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_ContextTransfer
service operation produced by the source NWDAF instance to request the
analytics context as depicted in Figure 6.1B.3-1.
The consumers of the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_ContextTransfer service operation
(as specified in clause 7.3.3) provide the following input parameters:
\- A list of analytics context identifier(s): identify a set of analytics
context that are available at the NWDAF instance providing this service and
that are requested to be transferred to the consumer NWDAF instance. The
analytics context identifier is provided as the following:
\- Subscription Correlation ID: identifies the analytics subscription for
which the related analytics context is requested; or
\- A set of SUPI and associated Analytics ID for UE related Analytics; or
\- An Analytics ID for NF related Analytics.
\- [OPTIONAL] Requested Analytics Context Type per analytics context
identifier: indicates which part of the analytics context the consumer wishes
to receive. Following values are specified:
\- Pending output Analytics;
\- Historical output Analytics;
\- Analytics subscription aggregation information;
\- Data related to Analytics;
\- Aggregation related information;
\- ML Model related information.
NOTE: A list of \"analytics context identifier(s)\" can be provided by the
source NWDAF to the target NWDAF in an analytics subscriptions transfer
request as described in clause 6.1B.2.2. Information allowing to identify an
analytics context can also be provided by the NWDAF consumer to the target
NWDAF in the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe request and based on this
information the target NWDAF derives the \"analytics context identifier\", as
defined in clause 6.1B.2.1.
The producer NWDAF provides to the consumer of the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_ContextTransfer service operation (as specified in clause
7.3.3), the output information listed below:
\- (Set of) Analytics context matching the input parameters of the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_ContextTransfer request. If no Requested Analytics
Context type parameters are available in the request, all available analytics
context types are sent. Analytics context includes the following information
parts, if available:
\- Analytics related:
\- Pending output analytics (i.e. not yet notified to the consumer).
\- Historical output analytics information. The content of the output
analytics is specified in clause 6.1.3 as output information of the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request service
operations.
\- Timestamp(s) of the last output analytics provided to the analytics
consumer(s). Value is set to 0 if no output analytics had been sent yet.
\- Analytics subscription aggregation information (only provided when
analytics context is related to analytics aggregation): information about the
analytics subscriptions that the source NWDAF has with the NWDAFs that
collectively serve the transferred analytics subscription, which includes IDs
and analytics metadata information of these NWDAFs for specific Analytics
ID(s) and optionally input parameters of analytics exposure as defined in
clause 6.1.3.
\- Data related to Analytics:
\- Historical data that is available at the source NWDAF and that is related
to the analytics to be handed over to the target NWDAF. If available, the time
period of the collected data, NF ID(s) of the data source(s) and information
(e.g. filter and event reporting parameters) on the subscriptions with those
data sources which were used to generate this historical data.
\- Aggregation related information: Related to analytic consumers that
aggregate analytics from multiple NWDAF subscriptions:
\- (Set of) NWDAF identifiers of NWDAF instances used by the NWDAF service
consumer when aggregating multiple analytic subscriptions.
\- ML Model related information:
\- ID(s) of NWDAF(s) containing MTLF: Instance/Set ID(s) of the NWDAF(s)
containing MTLF from which the source NWDAF currently subscribes to the ML
Model Information used for the analytics.
\- Optionally, file address(es) of the trained ML model(s), which is included
only when the source NWDAF itself provides the trained ML model(s) for the
analytics subscription(s) for which the related analytics context is
requested.
## 6.1C NWDAF Registration/Deregistration in UDM
### 6.1C.1 General
The procedures in this clause are applicable to UE-related analytics (e.g. UE
mobility analytics) for some network deployments, e.g. such with an NWDAF co-
located to an AMF or SMF, where the NWDAF is configured to register in UDM for
the UEs that it is serving or collecting data for and for the related
Analytics ID(s). This enables NWDAF service consumers to discover the NWDAF
instance that is already serving the UE for one or more Analytics ID(s).
### 6.1C.2 NWDAF Registration in UDM
Figure 6.1C.2-1 shows the procedures for registration of the NWDAF in UDM for
UE-related analytics.
Figure 6.1C.2-1: NWDAF registration in UDM
1\. NWDAF triggers a registration in UDM, e.g. based on local configuration in
the NWDAF, the reception of a new Analytics subscription request, start of
collection of UE related data or an OAM configuration action.
2\. The NWDAF registers into UDM for the served UE, by sending
Nudm_UECM_Registration request (UE ID, NWDAF ID, Analytics ID(s)).
3\. UDM sends a response to NWDAF.
### 6.1C.3 NWDAF De-registration from UDM
Figure 6.1C.3-1 shows the procedures for deregistration of the NWDAF in UDM.
Figure 6.1C.3-1: NWDAF de-registration from UDM
1\. NWDAF triggers a de-registration from a previous registration in UDM. This
trigger may be that, e.g. the NWDAF has purged the analytics context for the
UE (see clause 6.1B.4) for related Analytics ID(s), the NWDAF is no longer
collecting data related to the UE, or an administrative action.
2\. NWDAF sends Nudm_UECM_Deregistration request (UE ID, NWDAF ID, Analytics
ID(s)).
3\. UDM sends a response to NWDAF.
## 6.2 Procedures for Data Collection
### 6.2.1 General
The Data Collection feature permits NWDAF to retrieve data from various
sources (e.g. NF such as AMF, SMF, PCF, NSACF and AF; OAM), as a basis of the
computation of network analytics.
All available data encompass:
\- OAM global NF data,
\- Data available in NFs, e.g. behaviour data related to individual UEs or UE
groups (e.g. UE reachability) and pre-computed metrics covering UE populations
(e.g. number of UEs present in a geographical area), per spatial and temporal
dimensions (e.g. per region for a period of time),
\- NF data available in the 5GC (e.g. NRF),
\- Data available in AF.
When DCCF, ADRF, MFAF or NWDAF hosting DCCF or ADRF are present in the
network, the data collection also follows the principles described in clause
6.2.6.
The NWDAF shall use at least one of the following services:
\- the Generic management services as defined in TS 28.532 [6], the
Performance Management services as defined in TS 28.550 [7] or the Fault
Supervision services as defined in TS 28.545 [9], offered by OAM in order to
collect OAM global NF data.
\- the Exposure services offered by NFs in order to retrieve data and other
non-OAM pre-computed metrics available in the NFs.
\- Other NF services in order to collect NF data (e.g. NRF)
\- DCCF data management service to retrieve data using DCCF.
The NWDAF shall obtain the proper information to perform data collection for a
UE, a group of UEs or any UE:
\- For an Analytics ID, NWDAF is configured with the corresponding NF Type(s)
and/or event ID(s) and/or OAM measurement types.
\- NWDAF shall determine which NF instance(s) of the relevant NF type(s) are
serving the UE, the group of UEs or any UE, taking into account the S-NSSAI(s)
and area of interest as defined in clause 7.1.3 of TS 23.501 [2].
\- NWDAF invokes Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe services to collect data from the
determined NF instance(s) and/or triggers the procedure in clause 6.2.3.2 to
subscribe to OAM services to collect the OAM measurement.
The NWDAF performs data collection from an AF directly as defined in clause
6.2.2.2 or via NEF as defined in clause 6.2.2.3. According to the data
collection request, the AF may further perform data collection from UE (see
clause 6.4.2 and clauses 6.5.2-6.5.4) as defined in clause 6.2.8.
The NWDAF shall be able to discover the events supported by a NF.
Data collection procedures enables the NWDAF to efficiently obtain the
appropriate data with the appropriate granularity.
When a request or subscription for statistics or predictions is received, the
NWDAF may not possess the necessary data to perform the service, including:
\- Data on the monitoring period in the past, which is necessary for the
provision of statistics and predictions matching the Analytics target period.
\- Data on longer monitoring periods in the past, which is necessary for model
training.
Therefore, in order to optimize the service quality, the NWDAF may undertake
the following actions:
\- The NWDAF may return a confidence parameter as stated in clause 6.1.3
expressing the confidence in the prediction produced. Prediction may be
returned with zero confidence as described below. This confidence is likely to
grow in the case of subscriptions.
\- The value of the confidence depends on the level or urgency expressed by
the parameter \"preferred level of accuracy\" as listed in clause 6.1.3, the
parameter \"time when analytics information is needed\" as listed in clause
6.1.3 and the availability of data. If no sufficient data is collected to
provide an estimation for the preferred level of accuracy before the time
deadline, the service shall return a zero confidence. Otherwise, the NWDAF may
wait until enough data is collected before providing a response or a first
notification.
\- In order to be prepared for future requests on analytics from NFs/OAM, the
NWDAF, upon operator configuration, may collect data on its own initiative,
e.g. on samples of UEs and retain the data collected in the data storage.
NOTE 1: The NWDAF can send an error response to the analytics consumer to
indicate that statistics are unavailable if the NWDAF was not prepared for
future requests and did not collect data on its own initiative.
The volume and maximum duration of data storage is also subject to operator
configuration.
The NWDAF may decide to reduce the amount of data collected to reduce
signalling load, by either prioritizing requests received from analytics
consumers, or reducing the extent (e.g. duration, scope) of data collection,
or modifying the sampling ratios. When using sampling ratio, the NWDAF may,
depending on the analytics required and based on local configuration, provide
additional partitioning criteria to the NFs to allow for a better UEs
representation and to request that the NFs first partition the UEs before
applying sampling ratio (see Event Reporting Information as specified in TS
23.502 [3]). The NWDAF may provide one or multiple partitioning criteria in
its request for data collection from NFs.
The NWDAF may skip data collection phase when the NWDAF already has enough
information to provide requested analytics.
The data which NWDAF may collect is listed for each analytics in input data
clause and is decided by the NWDAF.
NOTE 2: NWDAF can skip data collection phase for some specific input data per
the requested analytics e.g. when some of the data is already available at
NWDAF for the requested analytics, or when NWDAF considers that some of the
data is not needed at all to provide the requested analytics as per the
analytics consumer request (e.g. based on preferred level of accuracy or based
on the time when analytics are needed).
Event exposure subscriptions for data collection from the AMF and the SMF may
need to survive after the removal of UE context in the AMF including event
exposure subscriptions, or upon the creation of new UE context in AMF or SMF.
In order for event exposure subscriptions in AMF and SMF to be (re)created in
these cases, the NWDAF may subscribe to the events in AMF and/or SMF via UDM
for a UE or group of UEs, as specified in clause 4.15.4.4 of TS 23.502 [3].
In hierarchical interactions among NWDAFs, without standalone DCCF, or co-
located DCCF, the efficiency of data collection can be achieved by inter-NWDAF
instance cooperation among NWDAF instances on different levels of the
hierarchy. An efficient data collection means that the same data required for
the same Analytics ID or different Analytics IDs should not be collected
multiple times by the different NWDAFs of the hierarchy.
### 6.2.2 Data Collection from NFs
#### 6.2.2.1 General
The Data Collection from NFs is used by NWDAF to subscribe/unsubscribe at any
5GC NF to be notified for data on a set of events.
The Data Collection from NFs is based on the services of AMF, SMF, UDM, PCF,
NRF, NSACF and AF (possibly via NEF):
\- Event Exposure Service offered by each NF as defined in clause 4.15 and
clause 5.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
\- other NF services (e.g. Nnrf_NFDiscovery and Nnrf_NFManagement in NRF as
defined in clause 4.17 of TS 23.502 [3])
This data collection service is used directly in order to retrieve behaviour
data for individual UEs or groups of UEs (e.g. UE reachability) and also to
retrieve global UE information (e.g. Number of UEs present in a geographical
area).
Table 6.2.2.1-1: NF Services consumed by NWDAF for data collection

NOTE 1: The present document specifies that NWDAF can collect some UPF input
data for deriving analytics, but how NWDAF collects these UPF input data is
not defined in this Release of the specification.
NOTE 2: There is no data collected from the PCF by the NWDAF defined in this
Release of the specification.
NOTE 3: The Nudm_EventExposure can be used when NWDAF uses the procedures
specified in clause 4.15.4.4 of TS 23.502 [3] to subscribe to AMF or SMF via
UDM.
To retrieve data related to a specific UE, there are two cases:
\- If no Area of interest is indicated by the consumer, the NWDAF shall first
determine which NF instances are serving this UE as stated in table 6.2.2.1-2
unless the NWDAF has already obtained this information due to recent
operations related to this UE.
\- If an Area of interest is indicated, the NWDAF can:
\- First determine the AMF serving the UE and subscribe UE location from the
AMF. Once the UE is in or moves into the Area of interest, the NWDAF
determines which NF instances are serving this UE as stated in table 6.2.2.1-2
unless the NWDAF has already obtained this information due to recent
operations related to this UE; or
\- Determine the NF instances of a given type of network function serving the
Area of interest by querying NRF unless the NWDAF has already obtained this
information due to recent operations related to this UE.
Table 6.2.2.1-2: NF Services consumed by NWDAF to determine which NF instances
are serving a UE
+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | Type of NF | NF to be | Service | Reference in | | instance | contacted by | | T | | (serving the | NWDAF | | S 23.502 [3] | | UE) to | | | | | determine | | | | +================+================+================+================+ | UDM | NRF | Nnr | 5.2.7.3 | | | | f_NFDiscovery | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | AMF | UDM | Nudm_UECM | 5.2.3.2 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | SMF | UDM | Nudm_UECM | 5.2.3.2 | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | BSF | NRF | Nnr | 5.2.7.3 | | | | f_NFDiscovery | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | PCF | BSF | Nb | 5.2.13.2 | | | | sf_Management | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | NEF | NRF | Nnr | 5.2.7.3 | | | | f_NFDiscovery | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | NWDAF | NRF | Nnr | 5.2.7.3 | | | | f_NFDiscovery | | | | UDM | | 5.2.3.2 | | | | Nudm_UECM | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+ | NSACF | NRF | Nnr | 5.2.7.3 | | | | f_NFDiscovery | | +----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
The UDM instance should be determined using NRF as described in clause 4.17.4
of TS 23.502 [3] and factors to determine as described in clause 6.3.8 of TS
23.501 [2].
The AMF, SMF instances should be determined using a request to UDM providing
the SUPI. To determine the SMF serving a PDU session, the NWDAF should in
addition provide the DNN and S-NSSAI of this PDU Session; otherwise the NWDAF
will obtain a list of possibly multiple SMFs (e.g. one per PDU session).
The BSF instance should be discovered using NRF thanks to optional request
parameters (e.g. DNN list, IP domain list, IPv4 address range, IPv6 prefix
range) as stated in clause 4.17.4 of TS 23.502 [3] or based on local
configuration at the NWDAF.
The PCF instance serving UE PDU Session(s) should be determined using a
request to BSF with the allocated UE address, DNN and S-NSSAI.
To collect data (e.g. current number of UEs registered in a network slice or
current number of PDU Sessions established in a network slice) from NSACF, the
NSACF instance should be discovered using NRF as specified in clause 6.3.22 of
TS 23.501 [2] or based on local configuration at the NWDAF.
When NWDAF receives a request addressed to an Internal Group ID from a
consumer, NWDAF may need to initiate data collection from several 5GC NFs,
such as AMF, SMF, UDM, PCF, AF (e.g. via NEF), etc. If an Area of interest is
indicated by the consumer, NWDAF may first discover the instances of the
required 5GC NFs deployed in the network, e.g. by querying NRF, otherwise:
\- For discovering the UDM, NWDAF can query the NRF with the Internal Group ID
as the target of the query.
\- For discovering AMF, SMF, PCF, NEF and AF, NWDAF may need to discover all
instances in the network by using the Nnrf_NFDiscovery service.
NOTE 4: It is assumed that all members of an Internal Group ID belong to the
same UDM Group ID. NWDAF can select a UDM instance supporting the UDM Group ID
of the Internal Group ID.
Then, if data needs to be collected from AMF, SMF, UDM and PCF, NWDAF may
initiate the data collection with the Internal Group ID as the target, e.g.
subscribing to the event exposure in all the instances of a given type of
network function. This subscription to all the instances of required source of
event exposure handles, e.g. mobility of UEs across AMFs, or initiation of new
PDU sessions with different allocated SMFs.
For collecting data from AMF and SMF, NWDAF may collect the data directly from
AMF and/or SMF, or indirectly via UDM, according to clause 4.15.4.4 of TS
23.502 [3]. The indirect method may be required if the event exposure
subscription from NWDAF, for a UE or group of UEs, needs to survive the
removal of UE context in the AMF including event exposure subscriptions, or
upon the creation of new UE context in AMF or SMF serving the UE or group of
UEs. In this case the UDM is responsible for (re)creating event exposure
subscriptions in AMF and SMF, as specified in clause 4.15.4.4 of TS 23.502
[3].
The NWDAF determines to collect data from a trusted AF supporting specific
Event ID(s) and serving specific application(s) based on internal
configuration.
The NEF instance that is serving a specific network slices and/or applications
of a UE should be determined using NRF using optional request parameters as
defined in clause 6.3.14 of TS 23.501 [2]
If NWDAF needs to collect data from an AF deployed outside the operator\'s
domain, the NWDAF shall contact NEF with a SUPI or Internal Group ID as the
target of the data collection. NEF is responsible for translation of SUPI to
GPSI, or internal to external group identifiers, by querying UDM, prior to
contacting the AF.
NOTE 5: It is assumed that an AF is provisioned with the list of UE IDs (GPSIs
or SUPIs) belonging to an External or Internal Group ID.
To retrieve required data for any UE, the NWDAF may subscribe to events from
the AMF and/or SMF instances it has determined, setting the target of event
reporting to \"any UE\" and the event filter(s) according to the Analytics
Filter Information. Alternatively, if the required data is communication
related and for any UE within an Area of interest, the NWDAF can obtain from
the AMF instances it has determined a list of UEs located within the Area of
Interest. Based on the obtained UE list, for each UE in the list, the NWDAF
retrieves the SMF serving the UE and the NWDAF subscribes to data from the
relevant SMF per each specific UE. The indirect event exposure subscription to
AMF or SMF via UDM is not available for \"any UE\" or \"any UE within an Area
of interest\". If the required data is collected from UE via AF as described
in clause 6.2.8 and the Target of Analytics Reporting received from consumer
is \"any UE\", the NWDAF may either set the target of event reporting to \"any
UE\" in the data collection request to the AF, or may determine a list of UEs
from AMF and/or SMF based on the Analytics Filter Information and send the
data collection request to the AF for the determined list of UEs.
NOTE 6: If NWDAF requires collecting data from either AMF or SMF for \"any
UE\" or \"any UE within an Area of Interest\", NWDAF can use the direct Event
Exposure subscription to AMF or SMF, since subscriptions to \"any UE\" or
\"any UE within an Area of Interest\" are persistent by nature in AMF or SMF,
due to not being linked to a UE context.
To retrieve data related to \"any UE\" based on Analytics Filter Information,
the NWDAF shall first determine which NF instances are matching the Analytics
Filter Information (see clause 6.7.5.1) as stated in table 6.2.2.1-3 unless
the NWDAF has already obtained this information due to recent operations
related to this Analytics Filter Information.
Table 6.2.2.1-3: NF Services consumed by NWDAF to determine which NF instances
are matching analytics filters
Type of NF instance (matching analytics filters) to determine NF to be
contacted by NWDAF Service Reference in TS 23.502 [3]
* * *
AMF, SMF NRF Nnrf_NFDiscovery 5.2.7.3
To retrieve data related to Analytics IDs for \"any UE\" with Analytics Filter
Information defining an area of interest in terms of TA or Cells and/or with
specific S-NSSAIs, NWDAF requires the network slice association information to
properly determine the AMFs to collect data from as well as the proper queries
to OAM for data collection.
NOTE 7: Examples of Analytics ID requiring NWDAF to use network slice
association information for data retrieval are: network performance clause
6.6.1; user data congestion clause 6.8.1; QoS Sustainability clause 6.9;
Dispersion Analytics clause 6.10.1; observed service experience for a Network
Slice clause 6.4.1; and slice load analytics clause 6.3.
The network slice association information comprises the TAs associated with
each AMF and for each TAI its associated access type, cells and list of
supported S-NSSAIs (including indication of S-NSSAIs restricted by AMF).
Additionally, the mapping of cells per TAI and supported S-NSSAIs (including
indication of S-NSSAIs restricted by AMF) for TAI for each AMF can change and
NWDAF shall obtain this accurate information in order to properly retrieve
data for analytics generation.
In order to derive the network slice association information, NWDAF may be
configured with the mapping of cells per TAI and the S-NSSAIs per TAI. NWDAF
may subscribe to the \"S-NSSAIs per TAI mapping\" event exposed by AMF. The
NWDAF may use the configured information (when the analytics subscription or
request is at cell granularity) and the area of interest in the analytics
subscription or request to retrieve from AMF the list of supported S-NSSAIs
(including indication of S-NSSAIs restricted by AMF) per TAI and access types
per TAI for each AMF in the required area of interest. NWDAF consumes the
\"S-NSSAIs per TAI mapping\" event exposed by AMF using, as target of event
reporting, the list of TAIs based on the area of interest received in the
Analytics Filter Information or identified by the mapping of the Cells per TAI
matching to the Cell granularity included in the Analytics Filter Information.
The AMF \"S-NSSAIs per TAI mapping\" event output contains, for each of the
TAIs requested by NWDAF, its associated access type and the list of supported
S-NSSAIs (including indication of S-NSSAIs restricted by AMF).
To retrieve data from SMFs for Analytics IDs subscription or requests for
\"any UE\" including Analytics Filter Information with specific Applications,
DNNs, DNAIs and area of interest per TA granularity, NWDAF shall first
discover the SMF serving the area of interest via NRF.
NOTE 8: Examples of Analytics ID requiring NWDAF to collect data related to
PDU sessions associated with an AoI with TA granularity are: network
performance clause 6.6.1; user data congestion clause 6.8.1, QoS
Sustainability clause 6.9.
NWDAF may directly consume events from the discovered SMF using the event
target set to \"any PDU session\" and event filters with the same parameters
of the Analytics Filter Information, i.e. list of Application IDs and/or DNNs
and/or DNAI and the area of interest related to the requested Analytics ID.
1\. When SMF supports the exchange of UE Location parameter when SMF interacts
with AMF via Nsmf_PDUSession_Create/Update/CreateSMContext/UpdateSMContext due
to session establishment, modification, or release, service request, or
handover procedures (as defined in clause 5.2.8.2 of TS 23.502 [3]), SMF can
directly map the PDU sessions to an AoI with TA granularity.
If there are any changes in PDU sessions in the area of interest, for the
Application ID and/or DNN and/or DNAI subscribed by NWDAF, SMF notifies the
detected changes to NWDAF via Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation,
enabling NWDAF to keep an updated map of SMF and PDU sessions associated with
the Analytics Filter Information in an area of interest.
2\. When SMF does not support the exchange of UE Location parameter when SMF
interacts with AMF but supports the mapping of PDU sessions per TA (as defined
in clause 5.6.11 of TS 23.501 [2]), SMF may subscribe to UE mobility event
notifications of AMF as described in clause 5.3.4.4 of TS 23.501 [2] using
event ID \"UE moving in or out of Area of Interest\" and Event Filters as
described in Table 5.2.2.3.1-1 from TS 23.502 [3] to retrieve the list of
SUPIs (and GPSIs if available) in the area of interest. Based on the retrieved
list of SUPIs in the area of interest, SMF identifies the PDU sessions in the
area of interest.
3\. When SMF does not support the exchange of UE Location parameter when SMF
interacts with SMF nor supports the mapping of PDU sessions per TA (as defined
in clause 5.6.11 of TS 23.501 [2]), SMF rejects the request from NWDAF. Upon
the reject, NWDAF identifies the need to create the mapping of PDU sessions
per TA. NWDAF subscribes to UE mobility event notifications of AMF as
described in clause 5.3.4.4 of TS 23.501 [2] using event ID \"UE moving in or
out of Area of Interest\" and Event Filters as described in Table 5.2.2.3.1-1
from TS 23.502 [3] to retrieve the list of SUPIs (and GPSIs if available) in
the area of interest. Based on the retrieved list of SUPIs in the area of
interest, NWDAF subscribes to the SMFs serving the UEs in the area of interest
and derives the mapping of PDU sessions per TA.
An NWDAF may require to discover and select other NWDAFs for UE related
analytics. In this case, the NWDAF may discover from UDM if an NWDAF is
already collecting data related to the UE, as specified in clauses 5.2 and
6.1C.
#### 6.2.2.2 Procedure for Data Collection from NFs
The procedure in Figure 6.2.2.2-1 is used by NWDAF to subscribe/unsubscribe at
NFs in order to be notified for data collection on a related event (s), using
Event Exposure Services as listed in Table 6.2.2.1-1. Depending on local
regulation requirements, user consent for UE related data collection and usage
of collected data may be required. User consent is defined for a specific
purpose such as, e.g. analytics or model training. NWDAF checks user consent
taking the purpose for data collection and usage of these data into account.
Figure 6.2.2.2-1: Event Exposure Subscribe/unsubscribe for NFs
1\. The NWDAF checks if data is to be collected for a user, i.e. SUPI or GPSI,
then, depending on local policy and regulations, the NWDAF checks the user
consent by retrieving the user consent information from UDM using Nudm_SDM_Get
including data type \"User consent\". If user consent is not granted, NWDAF
does not subscribe to event exposure for events related to this user and the
data collection for this SUPI or GPSI stops here.
2\. If the user consent is granted, the NWDAF subscribes to UDM to
notifications of changes on subscription data type \"User consent\" for this
user using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe.
3\. The NWDAF subscribes to or cancels subscription for a (set of) Event ID(s)
by invoking the Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe/Nnf_EventExposure_Unsubscribe
service operation.
NOTE 1: The Event ID(s) are defined in TS 23.502 [3].
4\. If NWDAF subscribes to a (set of) Event ID(s), the NFs notify the NWDAF
(e.g. with the event report) by invoking Nnf_EventExposure_Notify service
operation according to Event Reporting Information in the subscription.
When the Reporting type is provided at step 1, the NWDAF determines that the
events are disappeared, if the same events are included in the notification
compared to the previous notification. Otherwise, NWDAF determines the events
are newly appeared or changed. Also, the NWDAF restores the events that are
not included in the notification, but included in the previous notification.
If the Granularity of dynamics is applied to the subscription, the NWDAF shall
infer the events in the NF from the events in the previous notification with
the applied Granularity of dynamics.
NOTE 2: The Event Reporting Information are defined in TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 3: The NWDAF can use the immediate reporting flag as defined in Table
4.15.1-1 of TS 23.502 [3] to meet the request-response model for data
collection from NFs.
NOTE 4: This procedure is also used when the NWDAF subscribes for data from a
trusted AF.
5\. The UDM may notify the NWDAF on changes of user consent at any time after
step 2.
6-7. If user consent is no longer granted for a user for which data has been
collected, the NWDAF shall unsubscribe to any Event ID to collect data for
that SUPI or GPSI. The NWDAF may unsubscribe to be notified of user consent
updates from UDM for each SUPI for which data consent has been revoked.
#### 6.2.2.3 Procedure for Data Collection from AF via NEF
The procedure in Figure 6.2.2.3-1 is used by NWDAF to collect information from
AFs via the NEF.
NOTE 1: In this release, AF registers its available data to NWDAF via OAM
configuration at NEF.
The AF collectable data information includes: AF identification, AF service
identification (e.g. endpoint information of Naf_EventExposure), available
data to be collected per application (e.g. identified by Event ID(s)).
Figure 6.2.2.3-1: Data Collection from AF via NEF
1a. After the registration of AF available data at the NEF, NEF generates an
event exposure with new EventID to be associated with available data to be
collected from AF. NEF invokes Nnrf_NFManagement_NFUpdate_request service
operation to update its registration information (i.e. NEF Profile) including
the generated Event IDs and associated AF identification, Application ID(s)
(i.e. internal application ID or Application ID known in the core network).
1b. NRF stores the received NEF registration information including available
data to be collected from AF.
1c. NRF sends Nnrf_NFManagement_NFUpdate_response message to NEF.
1d. When NWDAF needs to discovery the available data from AFs and the
appropriated NEF to collect this data, NWDAF invokes
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request_request service operation using as parameter the NEF
NF Type, a list of Event ID(s) and optionally AF identification, application
ID.
1e. NRF matches the requested query for available data in AFs with the
registered NEF Profiles and sends this information via
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request_response message to NWDAF.
NOTE 2: After the registration and discovery procedure described in step 1,
NWDAF identifies the available data per AF per application and the proper NEF
to collect such data.
2\. The NWDAF subscribes to or cancels subscription to data in AF via NEF by
invoking the Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe or Nnef_EventExposure_Unsubscribe
service operation. If the event subscription is authorized by the NEF, the NEF
records the association of the event trigger and the NWDAF identity.
NOTE 3: User consent for retrieving user data in AF via NEF is not specified
in this Release.
3\. Based on the request from the NWDAF, the NEF subscribes to or cancels
subscription to data in AF by invoking the Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe/
Naf_EventExposure_Unsubscribe service operation.
4\. If the NEF subscribes to data in AF, the AF notifies the NEF with the data
by invoking Naf_EventExposure_Notify service operation according to Event
Reporting Information in the subscription.
5\. If the NEF receives the notification from the AF, the NEF notifies the
NWDAF with the data by invoking Nnef_EventExposure_Notify service operation.
When the Reporting type is provided at step 2, the NWDAF determines that the
events are disappeared, if the same events are included in the notification
compared to the previous notification. Otherwise, NWDAF determines the events
are newly appeared or changed. Also, the NWDAF restores the events that are
not included in the notification, but included in the previous notification.
If the Granularity of dynamics is applied to the subscription, the NWDAF shall
infer the events in the AF from the events in the previous notification and
the applied Granularity of dynamics.
#### 6.2.2.4 Procedure for Data Collection from NRF
The NWDAF may use NRF services and Network Function service framework
procedures as defined in clause 5.2.7 and clause 4.17 of TS 23.502 [3]:
\- NF/NF service discovery procedures (in clause 4.17.4 of TS 23.502 [3]) and
Nnrf_NFDiscovery service (in clause 5.2.7.3 of TS 23.502 [3]) in order to
dynamically discover the NF instances and services of the 5GC. Such discovery
may be performed on a periodic basis, or under specific circumstances.
\- NF/NF service status subscribe/notify procedures (in clause 4.17.7 of TS
23.502 [3]) and Nnrf_NFManagement service (in clause 5.2.7.2 of TS 23.502 [3])
in order to be notified about the change of status of an NF. The service
operations for obtaining status information are NFStatusSubscribe and
NFStatusNotify, from the Nnrf_NFManagement service.
The information provided by the NRF to the NWDAF with the
Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request and the Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusNotify service
operations are the NF Profiles and the NF services as defined in clause 5.2.7
of TS 23.502 [3]. Such information can be used to set-up and maintain a
consistent network map for data collection and also, depending on use cases,
to perform analytics (e.g. NF load analytics as defined in clause 6.5).
If the NWDAF needs to keep a consistent network map for data collection from
AMFs and SMFs associated with a list of TAs, the subscription to
NFStatusSubscribe for such type of NFs may include the list of TAs target.
#### 6.2.2.5 Usage of Exposure framework by the NWDAF for Data Collection
The NWDAF shall subscribe (and unsubscribe) to the Event exposure service from
NF(s) reusing the framework defined in clause 4.15 of TS 23.502 [3]. This
framework supports the possibility for the NWDAF to indicate/request:
\- Events-ID: one or multiple Event ID(s) defined in clause 4.15.1 of TS
23.502 [3].
\- Target of Event Reporting defined in clause 4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3]: the
objects targeted by the Events. Within a subscription, all Event ID(s) are
associated with the same target of event reporting. In the case of NWDAF, the
objects can be UE(s), UE group(s), any UE.
\- Event Filter Information defined in clause 4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3]. This
provides Event Parameter Types and Event Parameter Value(s) to be matched
against.
\- A Notification Target Address and a Notification Correlation ID as defined
in clause 4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3], allowing the NWDAF to correlate
notifications received from the NF with this subscription.
\- Event Reporting Information described in TS 23.502 [3] Table 4.15.1-1 and
the muted stored events exposure as described in clause 6.2.7.
\- Expiry time as defined in clause 4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3].
The notifications from NFs/AFs contain on top of the Event being reported (and
of dedicated information being reported for this event):
\- the Notification Correlation Information provided by the NWDAF in its
request;
\- (when applicable to the event) the Target Id e.g. UE ID (SUPI and if
available GPSI); and
\- a time stamp.
### 6.2.3 Data Collection from OAM
#### 6.2.3.1 General
The NWDAF may collect relevant management data from the services in the OAM as
configured by the PLMN operator.
‐ NG RAN or 5GC performance measurements as defined in TS 28.552 [8].
‐ 5G End to end KPIs as defined in TS 28.554 [10].
NWDAF shall use the following services to have access to the information
provided by OAM:
\- Generic performance assurance and fault supervision management services as
defined in TS 28.532 [6].
‐ PM (Performance Management) services as defined in TS 28.550 [7].
‐ FS (Fault Supervision) services defined in TS 28.545 [9].
Editor\'s note: The MDA services are to be defined by SA WG5 and NWDAF could
subscribe to them. The reference to SA WG5 specification will be added when
defined in SA WG5.
NWDAF can be configured to invoke the existing OAM services to retrieve the
management data that are relevant for analytics generation, which may include
NF resources usage information (e.g. usage of virtual resources assigned to
NF) and NF resource configuration information (e.g. life cycle changes of NF
resource configurations).
OAM perform the required configuration in order to provide the information
requested by NWDAF subscription and perform the tasks, e.g. data collection,
data processing, associated with the subscribed request from NWDAF.
Another usage of OAM services is when the target of data collection is a
specific UE, via MDT based retrieval of information:
\- Measurement collection for MDT as defined in TS 37.320 [20].
In addition, NWDAF can be provisioned with Network Slice information (i.e. as
defined by the NetworkSliceInfo specified in TS 28.541 [22]) when a slice is
created or modified via OAM configuration mechanism as defined in TS 28.541
[22] and TS 28.532 [6].
#### 6.2.3.2 Procedure for data collection from OAM
The interactions between NWDAF and OAM for data collection are illustrated in
Figure 6.2.3.2-1. The data collected depends on the use cases. This figure is
an abstraction of the OAM performance data file report management service that
is defined TS 28.532 [6]. The actual OAM services and reporting mechanisms
that NWDAF may use are specified in TS 28.532 [6], TS 28.550 [7] or TS 28.545
[9].
The flow below assumes the NWDAF is configured on how to subscribe to the
relevant OAM services.
OAM shall setup the required mechanisms to guarantee the continuous data
collection requested by NWDAF.
Figure 6.2.3.2-1: Data collection from OAM performance data file report
management service
1\. (Clause 11.6.1.3.2 of TS 28.532 [6]), Subscribe (Input): NWDAF subscribes
to the notification(s) related to the services provided by the management
service producer.
2\. (Clause 11.6.1.3.3 of TS 28.532 [6]), Subscribe (Output): management
service producer responses to NWDAF if the subscription is success or not.
3\. Data processing: management service producer prepares the data.
4\. (Clause 11.6.1.1 of TS 28.532 [6]), Notification (notifyFileReady):
management service producer notifies the data file is ready.
As the final step, NWDAF fetches data by using file transfer protocols as
defined in clause 11.6.2 of TS 28.532 [6].
NOTE 1: The call flow in Figure 6.2.3.2-1 only shows a subscribe/notify model
for the simplicity, however both request-response and subscription-
notification models are supported.
NOTE 2: NWDAF is configured with the Network Slice information (i.e.
NetworkSliceInfo including a DN (Distinguished Name) of the NetworkSlice
managed object relating to the network slice instance associated to the
S-NSSAI and NSI ID if available as defined in TS 28.541 [22]). Based on the
Network Slice information, the NWDAF uses the DN (Distinguished Name) to
identify the NetworkSlice managed object relating to the S-NSSAI and NSI ID
and consumes the management services to collect the management data of the
corresponding NetworkSlice managed object (including the NRF serving the
network slice, the NFs associated to the network slice, the NG RAN or 5GC
performance measurements defined in TS 28.552 [8], or the 5G end to end KPIs
defined in TS 28.554 [10]) provided by OAM.
### 6.2.4 Correlation between network data and service data
The Correlation information in input data which helps NWDAF correlate data
from different NFs, OAM and UE application(s) is defined in Table 6.2.4-1,
which is subject to all the network data analytics.
NOTE: For simplicity, the correlation information is not listed in the input
data per network data analytics.
Table 6.2.4-1: Correlation Information
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Correlation Information | Description | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Timestamp, IP address 5-tuple | To correlate the data from AF | | | and from UPF. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Timestamp, AN Tunnel Info | To correlate the UPF data and | | (Clause 9.3.2.2 of | OAM data which are reported by | | TS 38.413 [16]) | the RAN (e.g. Reference Signal | | | Received Power or Reference | | | Signal Received Quality as | | | defined in Table 6.4.2-3). | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Timestamp, UE IP address | To correlate the data from UPF | | | and SMF. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Timestamp, SUPI | To correlate data from SMF and | | | AMF. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Timestamp, SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI or | To correlate data from SMF and | | UE IP address | PCF. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Timestamp, RAN UE NGAP ID | To correlate the AMF data and | | | OAM data reported by the RAN | | (Clause 9.3.3.2 of | (e.g. Reference Signal Received | | TS 38.413 [16]) and Global RAN | Power or Reference Signal | | Node ID | Received Quality as defined in | | | Table 6.4.2-3). | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Timestamp, Application ID, IP | To correlate data from SMF and | | filter information | AF. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | Timestamp, UE ID or UE IP | To correlate data from 5GC NF | | address, Application ID, DNN, | (e.g. SMF, UPF) and UE | | S-NSSAI | Application (via the AF). | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
### 6.2.5 Time coordination across multiple NWDAF instances
#### 6.2.5.1 General
In certain situations, an NWDAF Service Consumer expects to receive analytics
by a given time. In particular, when an NWDAF Service Consumer is collecting
analytics from multiple NWDAFs it can be necessary to coordinate the timing of
the analytics subscriptions/requests from the same NWDAF service consumer.
The NWDAF Service Consumer may use \"time when analytics information is needed
parameter\" (see clause 6.1.3) as a dynamic timer to indicate the minimum time
it is going to wait (i.e. \"expected waiting time\") to receive the analytics
collected from multiple NWDAFs.
#### 6.2.5.2 Procedure for time coordination across multiple NWDAFs
Figure 6.2.5.2-1: Procedure for time coordination across multiple NWDAFs
1a-1b. On analytics request/subscription, the NWDAF Service Consumer indicates
the \"expected waiting time\" as \"time when analytics is needed\" parameter
to those NWDAFs from which it expects to receive the analytics latest by the
\"time when analytics information is needed\", using either the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service
operation. In this example, NWDAF1 and NWDAF2 are the NWDAFs with tightly
related analytics.
2a-2b. Each NWDAF generates the requested analytics based on data from related
data sources. In this example, NWDAF1 processes data from NF1 and NWDAF2
processes data from NF2.
3a-3b. [Optional] If the \"time when analytics information is needed\" is
reached, but the analytics is not ready, the NWDAF may indicate a \"revised
waiting time\" in an error response or error notification, using either the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify
service operation, depending on the service used in step 1.
4a-4b. [Optional] On receiving an indicated \"revised waiting time\" as part
of an error response or error notification, the NWDAF Service consumer may use
the \"revised waiting time\" to update the \"time when analytics information
is needed\" parameter for future analytics requests/subscriptions to the same
group of NWDAFs.
5a-5b. If the value of the \"time when analytics information is needed\" was
updated in step 4, the NWDAF Service Consumer, in future requests or within
current subscription, indicates the new expected waiting time as \"time when
analytics information is needed\" to all NWDAFs with tightly related
analytics, using either the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service operation.
NOTE 1: Steps 3a-3b and steps 4a-4b may happen in different orders depending
on the timing of analytics collection (from other NFs, e.g. NF1 or NF2) or
processing.
NOTE 2: Parameter \"time when analytics is needed\" as in steps 1a-1b, 3a-3b,
4a-4b and 5a-5b can be per individual Analytics ID.
### 6.2.6 Enhanced Procedures for Data Collection
#### 6.2.6.0 General
Data collection may be performed via DCCF, MFAF and ADRF, when such NFs are
deployed, or via NWDAF (hosting DCCF and/or ADRF). The NF services used for
DCCF, MFAF, ADRF and the NWDAF (hosting DCCF and/or ADRF) are listed in Table
6.2.6.0-1.
Table 6.2.6.0-1: NF Services for the enhanced data collection procedures
+------------------+--------------------------+-----------+ | Service producer | Service | Reference | +==================+==========================+===========+ | NWDAF | Nnwdaf_DataManagement | 7.4 | +------------------+--------------------------+-----------+ | DCCF | Ndccf_DataManagement | 8.2 | | | | | | | Ndccf_ContextManagement | 8.3 | +------------------+--------------------------+-----------+ | MFAF | Nmfaf_3daDataManagement | 9.2 | | | | | | | Nmfaf_3caDataManagement | 9.3 | +------------------+--------------------------+-----------+ | ADRF | Nadrf_DataManagement | 10.2 | +------------------+--------------------------+-----------+
DCCF, MFAF and NWDAF hosting DCCF shall use the same services listed in clause
6.2.1 from OAM and NFs (including AFs directly or via NEF) to collect data.
Additionally, the new services for data exposure from DCCF, MFAF, ADRF and
NWDAF (hosting DCCF and/or ADRF) as specified in clause 8, 9, 10 and 7.4 may
also be used for data collection.
The NWDAF, DCCF, ADRF shall obtain the proper information to perform data
collection for a UE, a group of UEs or any UE following the principles of
clause 6.2.1.
When NWDAF or DCCF need to discover the sources of data collection, they
follow the principles defined in clause 6.2.2.1 in the case of data collection
from NFs; in clause 5A.2 in the case of DCCF deployed in the network and
requiring data from NWDAFs or ARDFs that independently collect data; clause
5.2 in the case of NWDAF (hosting DCCFs) and collecting data from other
NWDAFs.
#### 6.2.6.1 Bulked Data Collection
##### 6.2.6.1.0 General
NWDAFs may provide bulked data to consumers as an alternative to providing
individual events (i.e. subscription to multiple event IDs to obtain the data
required for an analytics generation).
The bulked data is the set of data samples from the collected event
notifications to be used for an Analytics ID for a consumer of NWDAF. A data
sample may be a notification, in which case the bulked data may comprise a
group of received notifications, or a data sample may be information extracted
from a notification and processed, in which case the bulked data comprises the
processed information. The bulked data can be used for the purpose of
analytics inference or ML model training.
The bulked data is generated based on the set of data samples from event
notifications collected from NFs/OAM and the properties for the selection of
such data, Consumers of bulked data or operators may define different rules
(e.g. aggregation formats or processes) for generation of bulked data for
training or inference.
NFs capable to expose bulked data have the following capabilities:
\- Exposing runtime collected data (e.g. data from NFs/AFs/OAM retrieved via
notification mechanisms), or historical collected data (e.g. data from
NFs/AFs/OAM that were at some point collected, then stored), or both;
\- Applying selection processes of data samples or processing mechanisms for
the generation of the bulked data according to bulked data formatting and
processing instructions provided by consumers of the bulked data or defined by
an operator. The bulked data formatting and processing instructions may
include the formatting and processing instructions as specified in clause 5A.4
and further instructions as described in clause 6.2.6.1.1. Such instructions
define the allowed and/or restricted properties and/or processes to be applied
to the set of data from the collected event notifications to be used for the
bulked data, the properties and processes being:
\- The properties associated with the Bulked data formatting and processing
are filters over the data to be associated with the bulked data. The
properties for bulked data are defined as per Data Specification parameters in
clause 6.2.6.1.1.
\- The processes associated with the bulked data formatting and processing are
mechanisms applied to the data to be associated with the bulked data and are
defined according to the Formatting and Processing parameter defined in clause
5A.4 and the further instructions defined in clause 6.2.6.1.1. These processes
may comprise: definition if data to be used for composing the bulked data is
directly extracted from collected events, or the data is extracted from event
notification of the same event type and pre-processed, or both; applying
anonymization of data fields in the bulked data to avoid exposing undesired
information, aggregation levels (i.e. per cell, per UEs, or temporal, e.g. per
hours or days).
NOTE: Pre-process data from collected event notifications of the same event
type refers to the usage of data manipulation processes in order to aggregate,
concatenate, process data from multiple collected event notifications from the
same event type that results in a single processed value.
\- Having the mapping of the Service Operation that have to be used for
collecting data of the bulked data associated with an Analytics ID.
##### 6.2.6.1.1 Services for Bulked Data Collection
NWDAF may expose the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation with a
request for bulked data including the following input parameters:
\- Data Specification:
\- Event ID(s) or Analytics ID(s);
\- In the case of Event IDs, the Data Specification fields includes the fields
Target of Event Reporting and Event Filter Information as defined in clause
4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3] and Bulked Data Type parameter, which can be set to
\'\'raw data samples\'\' (i.e. data is directly extracted from collected
events) or \'\'pre-processed data samples\'\' (i.e. data from collected events
is processed and the processed data is included in the bulked data) or a
combination of both;
\- If the Analytics ID(s), the Data Specification fields contain:
\- Target of Reporting including a tuple with Analytics ID; Bulked Data Type,
which can be set to \'\'raw data samples\'\' (i.e. data is directly extracted
from collected events) or \'\'pre-processed data samples\'\' (i.e. data from
collected events is processed and the processed data is included in the bulked
data) or a combination of both;
\- Filter Information may include fields related to the Analytics ID such as:
Target of Analytics Information (e.g. any UE, list of UEs, groups of UEs);
Analytics Filter Information (e.g. area of interest, DNN, Application,
S-NSSAI). The Analytics ID also determines the Service Operation from NFs, OAM
to be used and type of data (i.e. Event IDs, OAM measurements) to be collected
and associated with the bulked data.
\- Service Operation in the case of Event ID, defines the service operation to
be used by NWDAF, DCCF, MFAF, or ADRF to request data (e.g.
Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe or OAM Subscribe)
\- Bulked Data Formatting and Processing: the parameters defined in clause
4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3] for Event Reporting Information and Formatting and
Processing instructions as defined in clause 5A.4.
\- A Notification Target Address (+ Notification Correlation ID), where the
Notification Correlation ID is the unique identification for the bulked data
being generated for the requesting consumer.
\- ADRF ID or NWDAF ID (or ADRF Set ID or NWDAF Set ID) storing historical
data (optional). If known to the consumer, this may be specified to direct a
DCCF or an NWDAF to the repository containing historical data.
\- (Optional) ADRF information indicating whether the collected data for the
generation of the bulked data are to be stored in an ADRF and optionally an
ADRF ID.
\- (Optional, in case the requested data is Event IDs) Data Source
identification to collect the data, e.g. NF Instance (or NF Set) ID from which
the data needs to be collected.
The output parameter of the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation
comprise the subscription correlation ID, which identifies the requested
bulked data.
The input parameters of Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Notify service operation shall
contain the Notification Correlation ID and the generated bulked data when the
fetch flag = false. When the fetch flag = true the notifications will contain
the Notification Correlation ID, the Fetch Correlation ID and a target address
where the generated bulked data may be retrieved. In the case of unsuccessful
bulked data generation, the notification will contain an indication of an
unsuccessful bulked data generation, optionally with expired bulked data
deadline.
The input parameters for the service operation Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Fetch
include: the Notification correlation ID (+list of Fetch Correlation ID),
which identifies the requested bulked data.
The output parameters for the service operation Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Fetch
include:
\- the generated bulked data.
The generated bulked data exposed by the above listed service operations
comprises:
\- the dataset (i.e. the resulting set of data samples and/or set of pre-
processed data samples from the collected event notifications) generated based
on the parameters of bulked data request and Bulked Data Formatting and
Processing;
\- timestamp when the data sample is associated with a bulked data.
#### 6.2.6.2 Procedure for Data Collection from NWDAF
The procedure in Figure 6.2.6.2-1 is used by NWDAF service consumer to invoke
the data management services at NWDAFs in order to retrieve runtime and
historical data.
Figure 6.2.6.2-1: Data Collection from NWDAF via Data Management Service
1\. NWDAF service consumer (e.g. NWDAF, DCCF) identifies that further data
from an NWDAF is required in order to perform some operation related to
Analytics ID. The triggers for further data collection are related to:
a) the local policies of NWDAF or DCCF (e.g. preparation for future requests
for Analytics ID as specified in clause 6.2.2.1);
b) a request for analytics generation requiring data not available or not
directly reachable via the NWDAF service consumer (e.g. out of the serving
area);
c) a request for model training;
d) a request for data collection that NWDAF service consumer cannot provide by
itself.
NOTE 1: If the NWDAF service consumer is a DCCF, the discovery of the proper
NWDAF is defined in clause 6.2.6.3.6. If the NWDAF service consumer is a
NWDAF, the NWDAF service consumer can discover the appropriate NWDAF(s) as
defined in clause 5.2.
2a. NWDAF service consumer invokes Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe service
from NWDAF to request a required data. The request comprises the Data
Specification as well as Data Formatting and Processing instructions as
defined in clause 5A.4, Notification Target Address (+ Notification
Correlation ID).
When the required data is Event IDs, the NWDAF service consumer may include
the Data Source, e.g. NF Instance (or NF Set) ID from which the data needs to
be collected.
The NWDAF service consumer may include ADRF information indicating whether the
data are to be stored in an ADRF and optionally an ADRF ID.
The NWDAF service consumer may include ADRF ID or NWDAF ID (or ADRF Set ID or
NWDAF Set ID) storing historical data (optional), directing NWDAF to the
repository containing historical data.
The NWDAF checks if required data is related to a user, i.e. SUPI or GPSI,
then, depending on local policy and regulations, as described in clause 6.2.9,
the NWDAF checks or has checked the user consent by retrieving the user
consent information from UDM using Nudm_SDM_Get including data type \"User
consent\". If user consent is not granted, NWDAF sends a response to the NWDAF
service consumer in step 2b, indicating that user consent for data collection
was not granted and the data collection for this SUPI or GPSI stops here. If
the user consent is granted, the NWDAF can provide the required data to the
NWDAF service consumer by performing the following steps 2b-7 and the NWDAF
subscribes to UDM to notifications of changes on subscription data type \"User
consent\" for this user using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe. When receiving the
notification that user consent has been revoked, the NWDAF shall provide a
Termination Request in Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Notify to request the NWDAF
service consumer to cancel the subscription to the required data.
2b. Based on the received request, NWDAF creates a new data for the requesting
consumer. NWDAF sends Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe service response with a
confirmation of successful request and the subscription correlation ID
identifying the requested data.
NOTE 2: Subscription Correlation ID allows the NWDAF service consumer to
request to NWDAF any changes in the generation of a requested data.
3\. NWDAF determines whether the request data is available at such NWDAF.
NWDAF maintains a local association of requested Event IDs or Analytics IDs to
the list of triggered event subscription identifications from data sources to
generate the requested data. Based on this local association, the NWDAF checks
if the data to be collected is available at itself. If the data is available,
NWDAF uses such data to generate the requested data.
When data sources are NFs, the NWDAF discovers the proper NFs as defined in
clause 6.2.2.1.
When the data sources are other NWDAFs, the NWDAF discovers the other NWDAFs
as defined in clause 5.2.
When the data source is DCCF, the NWDAF discovers the proper DCCF as defined
in clause 6.3.19 of TS 23.501 [2].
4a. (Optional) If NWDAF receives a request for data that is not available or
not reachable by such NWDAF (e.g. out of serving area), NWDAF determines the
sources for the data that is not available, if the information has not been
included in the subscription to the requested data.
4b. (Optional) NWDAF may trigger further data collection using any of the
available mechanisms in clause 6.2.2 (e.g. if the data subscribed in step 2a
partially matches data that are already being collected by the NWDAF from a
data source and a modification of the subscription to the data source would
satisfy both the existing data collection as well as the newly requested data)
and clause 6.2.6 (e.g. recursively using data collection services from other
needed NWDAFs, DCCFs, ADRFs, NFs).
NWDAF updates its local association of the mapping of the requested data
(Event ID or Analytics ID) to the identification of the request/subscription
for data collection from the further data sources.
5\. Based on the properties of the received request, NWDAF generates the
requested data including the available or collected data (e.g. from other
NWDAFs, DCCFs or ADRFs, NFs).
6a. If the fetch flag is set to true in step 2a, NWDAF waits until the
requested data is ready and sends a Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Notify service
message with fetch instructions.
The requested data is ready when the NWDAF has generated the data and
completed processing and formatting as described in clause 5A.4.
6b. If the fetch flag is set to false in step 2a, NWDAF uses the
Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Notify service to send the Notification Correlation ID
and requested data to the NWDAF service consumer.
7(a.b). Alternatively, if the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Notify service message
with fetch instructions is received in step 6a, the NWDAF service consumer
shall fetch the required data from NWDAF via Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Fetch
service operation within the fetch deadline specified in the fetch
instructions. The NWDAF service consumer invokes the
Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Fetch service operation with the input parameters
including the Fetch Correlation ID, that identifies the data to be fetched and
receives a response with the requested data.
8\. The NWDAF service consumer uses the requested data for performing further
processing. If the NWDAF service consumer is an NWDAF the requested data can
be used for analytics generation or model training or for further exposing
such data to other NWDAFs. If the NWDAF service consumer is a DCCF, the
requested data can be provided to a DCCF data consumer.
9\. When the NWDAF service consumer determines that no more data is required
or if receiving a Termination Request from the NWDAF, e.g. due to user consent
revocation for the data collection related to a user, it unsubscribes to the
requested data from NWDAF. If NWDAF had triggered further data collection in
Step 3a and 3b, NWDAF also unsubscribe to all data sources.
NOTE 3: It is also possible that instead of providing the dataset of the
generated data in steps 6a, 6b, 7b, the NWDAF provides a reference to where
the dataset can be retrieved by the NWDAF service consumer.
#### 6.2.6.3 Data Collection using DCCF
##### 6.2.6.3.1 General
This clause specifies procedures for data collection using the DCCF described
in clause 5A for cases other than obtaining analytics from an NWDAF (which is
specified in clause 6.1.2). Two options are supported: data delivered via the
DCCF, according to clauses 6.2.6.3.2 and 6.2.6.3.3 and data delivered via a
messaging framework according to clauses 6.2.6.3.4 and 6.2.6.3.5. Which option
to be used is determined by DCCF configuration.
##### 6.2.6.3.2 Data Collection via DCCF
The procedure depicted in Figure 6.2.6.3.2-1 is used by a data consumer (e.g.
NWDAF) to obtain data and be notified of events via the DCCF using
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation. Whether the data consumer
directly contacts the Data Source or goes via the DCCF is based on
configuration of the data consumer.
Figure 6.2.6.3.2-1: Data Collection via DCCF
1\. The data consumer subscribes to data via the DCCF by invoking the
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe (Service_Operation, Data Specification,
Formatting Instructions, Processing Instructions, NF (or NF-Set) ID, ADRF
Information) service operation as specified in clause 8.2.2. The data consumer
may specify one or more notification endpoints. If data to be collected is
subject to user consent: if the data consumer checked user consent, the data
consumer shall provide user consent check information (i.e. an indication that
it has checked user consent), otherwise, the data consumer shall provide a
purpose for the data collection.
Service_Operation is the service operation to be used by the DCCF to request
data (e.g. Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe or OAM Subscribe). Data Specification
provides Service Operation-specific parameters (e.g. event IDs, UE-ID(s),
target of event reporting) used to retrieve the data. Formatting and
Processing Instructions are as defined in clause 5A.4. The data consumer may
include the Data Source, e.g. NF Instance (or NF Set) ID from which the data
needs to be collected. The data consumer may include ADRF information
indicating whether the data are to be stored in an ADRF and optionally an ADRF
ID.
2\. The DCCF checks if data is to be collected for a user, i.e. SUPI or GPSI,
then, depending on local policy and regulations, the DCCF checks the user
consent by retrieving the user consent information from UDM using Nudm_SDM_Get
including data type \"User consent\" and taking into account purpose for data
collection as provided in step 1. If user consent is not granted, DCCF does
not subscribe to event exposure for events related to this user, the data
collection for this SUPI or GPSI stops here and DCCF sends a response to the
data consumer indicating that user consent for data collection was not
granted. If the user consent is granted, the DCCF subscribes to UDM to
notifications of changes on subscription data type \"User consent\" for this
user using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe.
If the data consumer is NWDAF and it provides user consent check information
(i.e. an indication that it has checked user consent) in
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe in step 1, which has been obtained by the NWDAF
from UDM before, then the DCCF can do data collection for a user based on the
user consent information from the NWDAF and skip retrieving it from UDM.
3\. The DCCF determine the NF type(s) and/or OAM to retrieve the data based on
the Service Operation requested in step 1. If the NF instance or NF Set ID is
not provided by the data consumer. the DCCF determines the NF instances that
can provide data as described in clause 5A.2 and clause 6.2.2.2. If the
consumer requested storage of data in an ADRF but the ADRF ID is not provided
by the data consumer, or the collected data is to be stored in an ADRF
according to configuration on the DCCF, the DCCF selects an ADRF to store the
collected data.
4\. The DCCF determines whether the data requested in step 1 are already being
collected, as described in clause 5A.2.
If the data requested are already being collected from the Data Source by a
data consumer, the DCCF adds the data consumer to the list of data consumers
that are subscribed for these data, then the DCCF determines that no
subscriptions to the Data Source need to be created or modified.
5\. If the data subscribed in step 1 partially matches data that are already
being collected by the DCCF from a Data Source and a modification of this
subscription to the Data Source would satisfy both the existing data
subscriptions as well as the newly requested data, the DCCF invokes
Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe (Subscription Correlation ID) with parameters
indicating how to modify the previous subscription (as specified in clause
5A.2). The DCCF adds the data consumer to the list of data consumers that are
subscribed for these data. If some of the newly requested data can only be
provided by new Data Source, the DCCF creates new subscription(s) to the new
Data Source for the newly requested data.
If the data requested at step 1 are not already available or not being
collected yet, the DCCF subscribes to data from the NF using the
Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation as specified in clause 5A.2 and
clause 6.2.2.2, with DCCF indicated as Notification Target Address. The DCCF
adds the data consumer to the list of data consumers that are subscribed for
these data.
6\. When new output data are available, the Data Source uses
Nnf_EventExposure_Notify to send the data to the DCCF.
7\. The DCCF uses Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify to send the data to all
notification endpoints indicated in step 1. Data sent to notification
endpoints may be processed and formatted by the DCCF so they conform to
delivery requirements for each data consumer or notification endpoint as
specified in clause 5A.4. The DCCF may store the information in ADRF if
requested by the consumer or if required by DCCF configuration, using
procedure as specified in clause 6.2B.3.
NOTE: According to Formatting Instructions provided by the data consumer,
multiple notifications from a Data Source can be combined in a single
Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify so many notifications from the Data Source result
in fewer notifications (or one notification) to the data consumer.
Alternatively, a notification can instruct the data notification endpoint to
fetch the data from the DCCF before an expiry time.
8a. If DCCF needs to retrieve data from OAM, procedure for data collection
from OAM as per steps 1-4 from clause 6.2.3.2 is used.
8b. The DCCF uses Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify to send the data to all
notification endpoints indicated in step 1. Data sent to notification
endpoints may be processed and formatted by the DCCF, so they conform to
delivery requirements for each data consumer or notification endpoint as
specified in clause 5A.4. The DCCF may store the information in ADRF if
requested by the consumer or if required by DCCF configuration, using
procedure as specified in clause 6.2B.3.
9\. If a Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify contains a fetch instruction, the
notification endpoint sends a Ndccf_DataManagement_Fetch request to fetch the
data from the DCCF.
10\. The DCCF delivers the data to the notification endpoint
11\. The UDM may notify the DCCF on changes of user consent at any time after
step 2. If user consent is no longer granted for a user for which data has
been collected and there are no other consumers for the data, the DCCF shall
unsubscribe to any Event ID to collect data for that SUPI or GPSI. The DCCF
shall further update or terminate affected subscriptions of the Data Consumer.
The DCCF may unsubscribe to be notified of user consent updates from UDM for
each SUPI for which user consent has been revoked.
12\. When the data consumer no longer wants data to be collected it invokes
Ndccf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe (Subscription Correlation ID), using the
Subscription Correlation Id received in response to its subscription in step
1. The DCCF removes the data consumer from the list of data consumers that are
subscribed for these data.
13\. If there are no other data consumers subscribed to the data, the DCCF
unsubscribes with the Data Source.
##### 6.2.6.3.3 Historical Data Collection via DCCF
The procedure depicted in figure 6.2.6.3.3-1 is used by data consumers (e.g.
NWDAF) to obtain historical data, i.e. data related to past time period. The
data consumer requests data using Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe service
operation. Whether the data consumer uses this procedure or directly contacts
the ADRF or NWDAF is based on configuration.
Figure 6.2.6.3.3-1: Historical Data Collection via DCCF
1\. The data consumer requests data via DCCF by invoking the
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe (Service_Operation, Data Specification, Time
Window, Formatting Instructions, Processing Instructions, ADRF ID or NWDAF ID
(or ADRF Set ID or NWDAF Set ID) service operation as specified in clause
8.2.2. The data consumer may specify one or more notification endpoints to
receive the data. If data to be collected is subject to user consent: if the
data consumer checked user consent, the data consumer shall provide user
consent check information (i.e. an indication that it has checked user
consent), otherwise, the data consumer shall provide a purpose for the data
collection.
\"Service_Operation\" is the service operation used to acquire the data from a
data source. \"Data Specification\" provides Service_Operation-specific
parameters (e.g. event IDs, UE-ID(s)) used to retrieve the data. \"Time
Window\" specifies a past time period and comprises a start and stop time.
\"Formatting and Processing Instructions\" are as defined in clause 5A4. The
data consumer may optionally include the ADRF or NWDAF instance (or ADRF Set
or NWDAF Set) ID where the stored data resides.
2\. The DCCF checks if data is to be collected for a user, i.e. SUPI or GPSI,
then, depending on local policy and regulations, the DCCF checks the user
consent by retrieving the user consent information from UDM using Nudm_SDM_Get
including data type \"User consent\" and taking into account purpose for data
collection as provided in step 1. If user consent is not granted, DCCF does
not subscribe to event exposure for events related to this user, the data
collection for this SUPI or GPSI stops here and DCCF sends a response to the
data consumer indicating that user consent for data collection was not
granted. If the user consent is granted, the DCCF subscribes to UDM to
notifications of changes on subscription data type \"User consent\" for this
user using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe.
If the data consumer is NWDAF and it provides user consent check information
(i.e. an indication that it has checked user consent) in
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe in step 1, which has been obtained by the NWDAF
from UDM before, then the DCCF can do data collection for a user based on the
user consent information from the NWDAF and skip retrieving it from UDM.
3\. If an ADRF or NWDAF instance or ADRF Set ID or NWDAF Set ID is not
provided by the data consumer, the DCCF determines if any ADRF or NWDAF
instances might provide the data as described in clause 5B and 5A.2.
NOTE 1: An ADRF or NWDAF might have previously registered data it is
collecting with the DCCF.
4\. (conditional) If the DCCF determines that an ADRF instance might provide
the data, or an ADRF instance or Set was supplied by the data consumer, the
DCCF sends a request to the ADRF, using
Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalSubscribe (Data Specification, Notification
Target Address=DCCF) service operation as specified in clause 10.2. The ADRF
responds to the DCCF with an Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalSubscribe response
indicating if the ADRF can supply the data. If the data can be provided, the
procedure continues with step 5.
5\. (conditional) If the DCCF determines that an NWDAF instance might provide
the data or an NWDAF instance or Set was supplied by the data consumer, the
DCCF sends a request to the NWDAF using Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe (Data
Specification, Notification Target Address=DCCF) as specified in clause 7.4.2.
6\. The ADRF uses Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalNotify or the NWDAF uses
Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Notify to send the requested data (e.g. one or more
stored notifications archived from a data source) to the DCCF. The data may be
sent in one or more notification messages.
7\. The DCCF uses Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify to send data to all notification
endpoints indicated in step 1. Notifications are sent to the Notification
Target Address(es) using the data consumer Notification Correlation ID(s)
received in step 1. Data sent to notification endpoints may be processed and
formatted by the DCCF, so they conform to delivery requirements specified by
the data consumer.
NOTE 2: According to Formatting Instructions provided by the data consumer,
multiple notifications from an ADRF or NWDAF can be combined in a single
Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify so many notifications from the ADRF or NWDAF
results in fewer notifications (or one notification) to the data consumer.
Alternatively, a Ndccf_DataManagement_Notify can instruct the data
notification endpoint to fetch the data from the DCCF before an expiry time.
8\. If a notification contains a fetch instruction, the notification endpoint
sends a Ndccf_DataManagement_Fetch request to fetch the data from the DCCF.
9\. The DCCF delivers the data to the notification endpoint.
10\. The UDM may notify the DCCF on changes of user consent at any time after
step 2. If user consent is no longer granted for a user for which data has
been collected and if there are no other consumers for the data, the DCCF
shall unsubscribe to any data collection for that SUPI or GPSI. The DCCF shall
further update or terminate affected subscriptions of the Data Consumer. The
DCCF may unsubscribe to be notified of user consent updates from UDM for each
SUPI for which user consent has been revoked.
11\. When the data consumer no longer wants data to be collected or has
received all the data it needs, it invokes Ndccf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe
(Subscription Correlation ID) as specified in clause 8.2.3, using the
Subscription Correlation Id received in response to its subscription in step
1.
12\. If the data are being provided by an ADRF and there are no other data
consumers subscribed to the data, the DCCF unsubscribes with the ADRF using
Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalUnsubscribe as specified in clause 10.2.7.
13\. If the data are being provided by an NWDAF and there are no other data
consumers subscribed to the data, the DCCF unsubscribes with the NWDAF using
Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe as specified in clause 7.4.3.
##### 6.2.6.3.4 Data Collection via Messaging Framework
This procedure depicted in Figure 6.2.6.3.4-1 is used by a data consumer (e.g.
NWDAF) to obtain data and be notified of events using the DCCF and a Messaging
Framework. The 3GPP DCCF Adaptor (3da) Data Management service and 3GPP
Consumer Adaptor (3ca) Data Management service of the Messaging Framework
Adaptor Function (MFAF) are used to interact with the 3GPP Network and the
Messaging Framework. Whether the data consumer directly contacts the Data
Source or goes via the DCCF is based on configuration.
Figure 6.2.6.3.4-1: Data Collection via Messaging Framework
1\. The data consumer subscribes to data via the DCCF by invoking the
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe (Service_Operation, Data Specification,
Formatting Instructions, Processing Instructions, NF (or NF-Set) ID, ADRF
Information, Data Consumer Notification Target Address (+ Notification
Correlation ID)) service operation as specified in clause 8.2.2. The data
consumer may specify one or more notification endpoints and the NF or NF set
to collect data from. If data to be collected is subject to user consent: if
the data consumer checked user consent, the data consumer shall provide user
consent check information (i.e. an indication that it has checked user
consent), otherwise, the data consumer shall provide a purpose for the data
collection.
Service_Operation is the service operation to be used by the DCCF to request
data (e.g. Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe or OAM Subscribe). Data Specification
provides Service_Operation-specific required parameters (e.g. event IDs, UE-
ID(s), target of event reporting) and optional input parameters used to
retrieve the data. Formatting and Processing Instructions are as defined in
clause 5A.4. The data consumer may optionally include the Data Source NF
Instance (or NF Set) ID. The data consumer may include ADRF information
indicating whether the data are to be stored in an ADRF and, optionally, an
ADRF ID.
NOTE 1: Data consumer requesting data to be stored in ADRF allows the
collected data to be available to other data consumers in the future.
2\. The DCCF checks if data is to be collected for a user, i.e. SUPI or GPSI,
then, depending on local policy and regulations, the NWDAF checks the user
consent by retrieving the user consent information from UDM using Nudm_SDM_Get
including data type \"User consent\" and taking into account purpose for data
collection as provided in step 1. If user consent is not granted, NWDAF does
not subscribe to event exposure for events related to this user, the data
collection for this SUPI or GPSI stops here and DCCF sends a response to the
data consumer indicating that user consent for data collection was not
granted. If the user consent is granted, the DCCF subscribes to UDM to
notifications of changes on subscription data type \"User consent\" for this
user using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe.
If the data consumer is NWDAF and it provides user consent check information
(i.e. an indication that it has checked user consent) in
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe in step 1, which has been obtained by the NWDAF
from UDM before, then the DCCF can do data collection for a user based on the
user consent information from the NWDAF and skip retrieving it from UDM.
3\. If the NF instance or NF Set ID is not provided by the data consumer, the
DCCF determines the NF instances that can provide data as described in clause
5A.2 and clause 6.2.2.2. If the consumer requested storage of data in an ADRF,
but the ADRF ID is not provided by the data consumer, or the collected data is
to be stored in an ADRF according to configuration on the DCCF, the DCCF
selects an ADRF to store the collected data.
4\. The DCCF determines whether the data requested in step 1 are already being
collected, as described in clause 5A.2.
If the data requested are already being collected from the Data Source by a
data consumer, the DCCF adds the data consumer to the list of data consumers
that are subscribed for these data, then the DCCF determines that no
subscriptions to the Data Source need to be created or modified.
5\. The DCCF sends an Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure (Data Consumer
Information, MFAF Notification Information, Formatting Conditions, Processing
Instructions) to configure the MFAF to map notifications received from the
Data Source to outgoing notifications sent to endpoints and to instruct the
MFAF how to format and process the outgoing notifications. The DCCF may also
instruct the MFAF to store data into ADRF by providing an ADRF ID, if
requested by the data consumer in step 1, together with the NF Id of the data
source.
Data Consumer Information contains for each notification endpoint, the data
consumer Notification Target Address (+ Data Consumer Notification Correlation
ID to be used by the MFAF when sending notifications in step 9.
MFAF Notification Information is included if a Data Source is already sending
the data to the MFAF. MFAF Notification Information identifies Event
Notifications received from the Data Sources and comprises the MFAF
Notification Target Address (+ MFAF Notification Correlation ID). If the MFAF
does not receive MFAF Notification information from the DCCF, the MFAF selects
a MFAF Notification Target Address (+ MFAF Notification Correlation ID) and
sends the MFAF Notification Information, containing MFAF Notification Target
Address (+ MFAF Notification Correlation ID), to the DCCF in the
Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure Response.
6\. If the data subscribed in step 1 partially matches data that are already
being collected by the DCCF from a Data Source and a modification of this
subscription to the Data Source would satisfy both the existing data
subscriptions as well as the newly requested data, the DCCF invokes
Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe (Subscription Correlation ID) with parameters
indicating how to modify the previous subscription (as specified in clause
5A.2). The DCCF adds the data consumer to the list of data consumers that are
subscribed for these data. If some of the newly requested data can only be
provided by new Data Source, the DCCF creates new subscription(s) to the new
Data Source for the newly requested data.
If the data requested at step 1 are not already available or not being
collected yet, the DCCF subscribes to data from the NF using the
Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe (Data Specification, MFAF Notification Target
Address (+ MFAF Notification Correlation ID)) service operation as specified
in clause 5A.2 and clause 6.2.2.2, using the MFAF Notification Target Address
(+ MFAF Notification Correlation ID) received in step 5. The DCCF adds the
data consumer to the list of data consumers that are subscribed for these
data.
7\. When new output data are available, the Data Source uses
Nnf_EventExposure_Notify to send the data to the MFAF. The Notification
includes the MFAF Notification Correlation ID.
8\. The MFAF uses Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify to send the data to all
notification endpoints indicated in step 6. Notifications are sent to the
Notification Target Address(es) using the Data Consumer Notification
Correlation ID(s) received in step 6. Data sent to notification endpoints may
be processed and formatted by the MFAF, so they conform to delivery
requirements specified by the data consumer. The MFAF may store the
information in ADRF if requested by consumer or if required by DCCF
configuration
NOTE 2: According to Formatting Instructions provided by the data consumer,
multiple notifications from a Data Source can be combined in a single
Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify, so many notifications from the Data Source
results in fewer notifications (or one notification) to the data consumer.
Alternatively, a notification can instruct the data notification endpoint to
fetch the data from the MFAF before an expiry time.
9\. If a Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify contains a fetch instruction, the
notification endpoint sends a Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Fetch request to fetch
the data from the MFAF.
10\. The MFAF delivers the data to the notification endpoint.
11\. The UDM may notify the DCCF on changes of user consent at any time after
step 2. If user consent is no longer granted for a user for which data has
been collected and if there are no other consumers for the data, the DCCF
shall unsubscribe to any Event ID to collect data for that SUPI or GPSI. The
DCCF shall further update or terminate affected subscriptions of the Data
Consumer. The DCCF may unsubscribe to be notified of user consent updates from
UDM for each SUPI for which user consent has been revoked.
12\. When the data consumer no longer wants data to be collected, it invokes
Ndccf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe (Subscription Correlation ID), using the
Subscription Correlation Id received in response to its subscription in step
1. The DCCF removes the data consumer from the list of data consumers that are
subscribed for these data.
13\. If there are no other data consumers subscribed to the data, the DCCF
unsubscribes with the Data Source.
14\. The DCCF de-configures the MFAF so it no longer maps notifications
received from the Data Source to the notification endpoints configured in step
5.
##### 6.2.6.3.5 Historical Data Collection via Messaging Framework
The procedure depicted in figure 6.2.6.3.5-1 is used by data consumers (e.g.
NWDAF) to obtain historical data, i.e. data related to past time period. The
data consumer obtains data using Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe service
operation as specified in clause 8.2.2, where the subscription results in one
or more notifications depending on how the data is retrieved from the ADRF or
NWDAF and how the data is formatted. Whether the data consumer uses this
procedure or directly contacts the ADRF or NWDAF is based on configuration.
Figure 6.2.6.3.5-1: Historical Data Collection via Messaging Framework
1\. The data consumer requests data via DCCF by invoking the
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe (Service Operation, Data Specification, Time
Window, Formatting Instructions, Processing Instructions, ADRF ID or NWDAF ID
(or ADRF Set ID or NWDAF Set ID) service operation as specified in clause
8.2.2. The data consumer may specify one or more notification endpoints to
receive the data. If data to be collected is subject to user consent: if the
data consumer checked user consent, the data consumer shall provide user
consent check information (i.e. an indication that it has checked user
consent), otherwise, the data consumer shall provide a purpose for the data
collection.
Service_Operation is the service operation used to acquire the data from a
data source, Data Specification provides Service_Operation-specific required
parameters (e.g. event IDs, UE-ID(s) and optional input parameters used to
retrieve the data. Time Window specifies a past time period and comprises a
start and stop time and Formatting and Processing Instructions are as defined
in clause 5A4. The data consumer may optionally include the ADRF or NWDAF
instance (or ADRF Set or NWDAF Set) ID where the stored data resides.
2\. The DCCF checks if data is to be collected for a user, i.e. SUPI or GPSI,
then, depending on local policy and regulations, the DCCF checks the user
consent by retrieving the user consent information from UDM using Nudm_SDM_Get
including data type \"User consent\" and taking into account purpose for data
collection as provided in step 1. If user consent is not granted, DCCF does
not subscribe to event exposure for events related to this user, the data
collection for this SUPI or GPSI stops here and DCCF sends a response to the
data consumer indicating that user consent for data collection was not
granted. If the user consent is granted, the DCCF subscribes to UDM to
notifications of changes on subscription data type \"User consent\" for this
user using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe.
If the data consumer is NWDAF and it provides user consent check information
(i.e. an indication that it has checked user consent) in
Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe in step 1, which has been obtained by the NWDAF
from UDM before, then the DCCF can do data collection for a user based on the
user consent information from the NWDAF and skip retrieving it from UDM.
3\. If an ADRF or NWDAF instance or ADRF Set ID or NWDAF Set ID is not
provided by the data consumer, the DCCF determines if any ADRF or NWDAF
instances might provide the data as described in clause 5B and 5A.2.
NOTE 1: An ADRF or NWDAF might have previously registered data it is
collecting with the DCCF.
4\. The DCCF sends an Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure (Data Consumer
Information, Formatting Conditions, Processing Instructions) to configure the
MFAF to map notifications received from the ADRF or NWDAF to outgoing
notifications sent to endpoints and to instruct the MFAF how to format and
process the outgoing notifications.
\"Data Consumer Information\" contains for each notification endpoint, the
data consumer Notification Target Address (+ Data Consumer Notification
Correlation ID) to be used by the MFAF when sending notifications. The MFAF
selects an MFAF Notification Target Address (+ MFAF Notification Correlation
ID) and sends the MFAF Notification Information, containing MFAF Notification
Target Address (+ MFAF Notification Correlation ID), to the DCCF in the
Nmfaf_3daDataManagement_Configure Response.
5\. (conditional) If the DCCF determines that an ADRF instance might provide
the data, or an ADRF instance or Set was supplied by the data consumer, the
DCCF sends a request to the ADRF, using
Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalSubscribe (Data Specification, MFAF Notification
Information) containing the MFAF Notification Target Address (+ MFAF
Notification Correlation ID) received in step 4 as specified in clause 10.2.
6\. The ADRF responds to the DCCF with an
Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalSubscribe response indicating if the ADRF can
supply the data. If the data can be provided, the procedure continues with
step 9.
7\. (conditional) If the DCCF determines that an NWDAF instance might provide
the data, or an NWDAF instance or NWDAF Set was supplied by the data consumer,
the DCCF sends a request to the NWDAF, using Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe
(Data Specification, MFAF Notification Information) as specified in clause
7.4.2. MFAF Notification Information contains the MFAF Notification Target
Address (+ MFAF Notification Correlation ID) received in step 4.
8\. The NWDAF responds to the DCCF with an Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe
response indicating if the NWDAF can supply the data.
9\. The ADRF uses Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalNotify or the NWDAF uses
Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Notify to send the requested data (e.g. one or more
stored notifications archived from a data source) to the MFAF. The data may be
sent in one or more notification messages.
10\. The MFAF uses Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify to send data to all
notification endpoints indicated in step 4. Notifications are sent to the
Notification Target Address(es) using the Data Consumer Notification
Correlation ID(s) received in step 4. Data sent to notification endpoints may
be processed and formatted by the MFAF, so they conform to delivery
requirements specified by the data consumer.
NOTE 2: According to Formatting Instructions provided by the data consumer,
multiple notifications from an ADRF or NWDAF can be combined in a single
Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify so many notifications from the ADRF or NWDAF
results in fewer notifications (or one notification) to the data consumer.
Alternatively, a Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Notify can instruct the data
notification endpoint to fetch the data from the MFAF before an expiry time.
11\. If a notification contains a fetch instruction, the notification endpoint
sends a Nmfaf_3caDataManagement_Fetch request as specified in clause 9.3.3 to
fetch the data from the MFAF.
12\. The MFAF delivers the data to the notification endpoint.
13\. The UDM may notify the DCCF on changes of user consent at any time after
step 2. If user consent is no longer granted for a user for which data has
been collected and if there are no other consumers for the data, the DCCF
shall unsubscribe to any data collection for that SUPI or GPSI. The DCCF shall
further update or terminate affected subscriptions of the Data Consumer. The
DCCF may unsubscribe to be notified of user consent updates from UDM for each
SUPI for which user consent has been revoked.
14\. When the data consumer no longer wants data to be collected or has
received all the data it needs, it invokes Ndccf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe
(Subscription Correlation ID), using the Subscription Correlation Id received
in response to its subscription in step 1.
15\. If the data are being provided by an ADRF and there are no other data
consumers subscribed to the data, the DCCF unsubscribes with the ADRF using
Nadrf_DataManagement_RetrievalUnsubscribe as specified in clause 10.2.7.
16\. If the data are being provided by an NWDAF and there are no other data
consumers subscribed to the data, the DCCF unsubscribes with the NWDAF using
Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe as specified in clause 7.4.3.
17\. The DCCF de-configures the MFAF so it no longer maps notifications
received from the ADRF or NWDAF to the notification endpoints configured in
step 4.
##### 6.2.6.3.6 Data collection profile registration
In some cases data consumers (e.g. NWDAF or ADRF) collect data from data
source NF directly, e.g. when NWDAF is co-located with 5GC NF.
To enable data consumers can get the data which has been collected by NWDAF or
ADRF directly (i.e. not via DCCF), the NWDAF or ADRF may register/update the
data collection profile to the DCCF during/after the procedure of data
collection. DCCF can then determine some requested data is available in NWDAF
or ARDF and can coordinate data collection based on the data collection
profile.
The procedure depicted in Figure 6.2.6.3.6-1 is used by data source (e.g.
NWDAF or ADRF) to register data profile to DCCF.
Figure 6.2.6.3.6-1: Procedure for the NWDAF or ADRF register data profile to
DCCF
1\. An ADRF or NWDAF instance is collecting or has collected data directly,
e.g. from collocated NF.
2\. The ADRF or NWDAF requests to register/update data collection profile
(Service Operation, Analytics/Data Specification, ADRF ID or NWDAF ID) to DCCF
by invoking the Ndccf_ContextManagement_Register or
Ndccf_ContextManagement_Update. The registration/ update request can be
triggered by the acceptation of subscription for data collection responded by
the data source (e.g. collocated NF), it can be before the start of data
collection or after the completion of data collection. DCCF determines the
data collection status of NWDAF or ADRF based on the Analytics/Data
Specification, i.e. DCCF determines whether the required data is being
collected or has been collected.
\"Service Operation\" identifies the service used to collect the data or
analytics from a Data Source (e.g.: Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe).
\"Analytics/Data Specification\" is the \"Service Operation\" specific
parameters that identify the collected data (i.e.: Analytics ID(s) / Event ID
(s), Target of Analytics Reporting or Target of Event Reporting, Analytics
Filter or Event Filter, etc.).
NWDAF ID or ADRF ID specify the ADRF or NWDAF which registers data collection
profile.
3\. The DCCF responds to the ADRF or NWDAF with a
Ndccf_ContextManagement_Register Response or Ndccf_ContextManagement_Update
Response.
4\. To obtain historical data and if the data consumer is configured to be
collect data via the DCCF using Ndccf_DataManagement_Subscribe service
operation, the data consumer uses the procedures described in clause 6.2.6.3.2
or clause 6.2.6.3.3.
5\. The ADRF or NWDAF requests to delete a registration of data collection or
analytics collection to the DCCF by invoking the
Ndccf_ContextManagement_Deregister.
### 6.2.7 Data Collection with Event Muting Mechanism
#### 6.2.7.1 General
Additional mechanisms to limit signalling between Event Producer NF (e.g. AMF,
SMF) and Event Consumer NF (NWDAF, DCCF) are provided, with the Event Provider
NFs enhanced with the optional capability of muting the notification of the
events while storing for a limited time and limited size the events until the
Event Consumer NF retrieves such mute stored events.
#### 6.2.7.2 Procedure for Data Collection with Event Muting Mechanism
The mute storage of events mechanism in the DCCF, the NWDAF, or NFs (if
configured to support event muting mechanism) reuses the Event Reporting
Information field of Event Exposure Framework to include the following flags:
\- Deactivate notification flag: The event consumer NF includes in the
subscription to an event ID the deactivation flag to indicate to the event
provider NF to collect, store the requested events but halt the notification
to the consumer. The number of stored events may be limited based on NF
configuration; when this number is reached, the NF continues to store new
events and deletes the oldest events.
\- Retrieval notification flag: The event consumer NF includes in an event
subscription modification request the subscription identification and the
retrieval notification flag to indicate to the event producer NF to send the
past collected events not already sent to this consumer NF. After sending the
past collected events the event producer continues to store events without
sending notifications to the event consumer.
Using the event muting mechanism NWDAF, DCCF can subscribe to events from NFs
such as AMF and SMF (if configured to support event muting mechanism), to
avoid constant notifications and retrieve the mute stored events when it
requires.
The procedure in Figure 6.2.7.2-1 is used by Event Consumer NF to control the
frequency of data collection from Event Producer NFs (except DCCF and NWDAF)
via Event Exposure. For data collection via DCCF and NWDAF, the consumer may
mute the notifications by using the formatting instructions as specified in
clause 5A.4.
Figure 6.2.7.2-1: Procedure for muting event notification
0a. The Event Consumer NF, such as NWDAF or DCCF, is configured with local
policies that are used to determine when the muted storage of events is
triggered.
0b. The Event Consumer NF, such as NWDAF or DCCF, may receive a request with
the Formatting and Processing parameters indicating Event Clubbing. The DCCF
or NWDAF may utilize event muting when collecting data from NFs (if configured
to support event muting mechanism).
1\. The Event Consumer NF, DCCF or NWDAF subscribes for a (set of) Event ID(s)
by invoking the Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation including in
event reporting information the deactivate notification flag.
If the Event Producer NF supports the deactivate notification flag, the Event
Producer NF sends a response back including the Subscription Correlation ID
and an indication of successful deactivation of notifications. The Event
Consumer NF may request the Event Producer NF to store data related to Event
ID(s), or aggregated data related to UE(s).
If the Event Producer NF does not support the deactivate notification flag,
the Event Producer NF sends a response back including an indication of
failure. In this case, the Event Consumer NF re-sends the subscription request
without including in the event reporting information the deactivate
notification flag.
NOTE: If the Event Producer NF receives a subscription without the deactivate
notification flag, the steps 2 - 6 are not executed and the Event Producer NF
performs the event notification as defined in clause 4.15 of TS 23.502 [3].
2\. Based on the request from Event Consumer NF, DCCF or NWDAF, the Event
Producer NF triggers a window of event collection for the Event Consumer NF,
DCCF or NWDAF subscription with the indication of \"deactivate notification
flag\". The Event Producer NF keeps the association between the Event ID,
Subscription Correlation ID (which identifies the consumer of the event),
subscriber information (e.g. notification target information) and the status
of the transaction between the Event Consumer NF, DCCF or NWDAF and the Event
Producer as \"collecting events / non-notification\".
3\. Based on local policies or based on the Notification Time Window indicated
in the Formatting and Processing parameters of the received request in step
0b, the Event Consumer NF, DCCF or NWDAF decides when to request the muted
stored events from the Event Producer NF.
4\. Event Consumer NF invokes the Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe service
operation from the Event Producer NF including, the Event ID, the Subscription
Correlation ID and the retrieval notification flag. These parameters denote
the identification of the transaction required by the Event Consumer NF, i.e.
retrieve muted stored events for a subscribed Event ID and trigger a new time
window of muted stored event generation without notification.
5\. Event Producer NF based on the parameters received in the request from
Event Consumer NF verifies whether there is a subscription to the requested
Event ID with a deactivate notification flag. In positive case, Event Producer
NF identifies and sends the past collected events muted during the period
between the received retrieval notification flag and the last deactivate flag
received from the Event consumer NF for the Event ID, the Subscription
Correlation ID.
6\. The Event Producer NF checks whether overall event reporting information
(e.g. the maximum time window for the subscription of such Event ID) has
expired. If yes, it does not trigger another round of event muted storage and
deactivates the subscription. If not expired, the Event Producer NF trigger
another time window for muted stored of produced events, sets back the
deactivated notification flag for the Event ID and Subscription Correlation
ID.
If the Event Consumer NF wants to change an existing subscription to an Event
Producer NF using muted stored events into a regular notification of events,
it shall invoke Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation from Event
Producer NF without deactivate notification flag.
### 6.2.8 Data Collection from the UE Application
#### 6.2.8.1 General
The NWDAF may interact with an AF to collect data from UE Application(s) as an
input for analytics generation and ML model training. The AF can be in the MNO
domain or an AF external to MNO domain. The data collection request from NWDAF
may trigger the AF to collect data from the UE Application. The AF in this
clause is referred as the Data Collection AF which is described in TS 26.531
[32].
The UE Application establishes a connection to the AF in the MNO domain or
external to MNO domain over user plane via a PDU session. The AF communicates
with the UE Application and collects data from UE Application.
For both an AF in trusted domain and an AF in untrusted domain (which supports
to collect data from a UE Application), the SLA between the operator and the
Application Service Provider (i.e. ASP) determines per Application ID in use
by the ASP:
\- The AF for the UE Application to connect to (e.g. based on an FQDN).
\- The information that the UE Application shares with the AF, subject to user
consent.
\- Possible Data Anonymization, Aggregation or Normalization algorithms (if
used).
\- The authentication information that enable the AF to verify the
authenticity of the UE\'s Application that provides data.
NOTE 1: The mutual authentication info that is used by the UE Application and
the AF and how user consent is obtained is out of SA WG2\'s scope.
The AF (which supports the data collection) is configured based on the SLA
above.
NOTE 2: Data Anonymization, Aggregation or Normalization algorithms within the
SLA are defined per individual UE.
A UE Application (which supports to providing data to an AF) is configured by
the ASP with the Application ID to use in the communication with the AF and
then the UE Application is configured per Application ID with the following
information:
\- The address of the AF to contact.
\- The parameters that the UE Application is authorized to provide to the AF.
\- The authentication information to enable the UE Application to verify the
authenticity of the AF that requests data.
NOTE 3: The authentication and authorization info that is used by the UE
Application and the AF for collection and how user consent is obtained is out
of SA2\'s scope.
NOTE 4: The configuration procedure for the above information from the ASP to
the UE\'s Application is out of SA WG2 scope.
NOTE 5: The Application ID configured in the UE Application can either be an
OSAppId as defined in TS 23.503 [4] or an OS independent Application
Identifier (e.g. for applications running on a web browser).
The Target for Event Reporting in the Naf_EventExposure request may be set to:
\- an external UE ID (i.e. GPSI) or an external Group ID, in case the AF is
located in the untrusted domain;
\- a SUPI or an internal Group ID, in case the AF is located within the
trusted domain.
The GPSI may be an External Identifier for individual UE as defined in TS
23.501 [2] that includes the domain name. This domain name and the Application
ID configured in the UE Application are different from each other.
#### 6.2.8.2 Procedure for data collection from the UE Application
##### 6.2.8.2.1 Connection establishment between UE Application and AF
The UE Application receives the data collection configuration from ASP. The
configuration information is as described in clause 6.2.8.1.
The UE Application establishes a user plane connection to the AF. Data
collection procedure from the UE Application is performed via the user plane
connection.
NOTE 1: Whether multiple user plane connections are established, or a single
user plane connection is established for different applications between each
UE Application and AF is based on implementation that is out of 3GPP scope.
NOTE 2: The Connection establishment procedure from the UE Application to the
AF as above is out of scope of the present specification. For the 3GPP defined
services, the Connection establishment procedure is in the scope of SA WG4.
For the non-3GPP defined services, the Connection establishment procedure is
out of 3GPP\'s scope.
NOTE 3: In order to preserve resources (e.g. battery, quota) for the end user,
a user plane connection to the AF can be established only when the UE has an
active PDU Session for the UE Application and it is actively using the network
(i.e. the user plane connection to the AF does not need to be established when
the UE Application is inactive, or used in an off-line mode).
Both direct data collection procedure (from the UE Application to the AF,
either in trusted domain or untrusted domain) and indirect data collection
procedure (from the UE Application to the Application server and from the
Application server to the AF) shall be supported. The data collection
procedure is described in TS 26.531 [32].
The AF retrieves and stores the IP address of the UE (in the PDU session used)
in order to request data collection from the UE Application. The UE IP address
is used by the AF to identify the user plane connection.
NOTE 4: An operator can deploy NAT functionality in the network; Data
collection from the UE Application when NAT is deployed is not specified in
this release of the specification.
The UE Application provides the Application ID configured in the UE
Application to the AF as described in TS 26.531 [32].
##### 6.2.8.2.2 AF registration and discovery
The AF registers its available NF profile to the NRF. The AF in trusted domain
registers to the NRF by using the Nnrf_NFManagement service that is defined in
clause 5.2.7.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. The AF in untrusted domain registers the
available NF profile to the NRF via the NEF as described in clause 6.2.2.3.
The AF discovery and selection is described in TS 23.502 [3].
##### 6.2.8.2.3 Data Collection Procedure from UE
Figure 6.2.8.2.3-1: Data Collection Procedure from UE
1\. An NF subscribes to analytics from the NWDAF as described in clause
6.1.1.1, that includes Analytics ID, Analytics Filter Information including
e.g. AoI, Internal Application ID(s) and Target of Analytics Reporting. NWDAF
may also initiate the data collection prior to this subscription.
NOTE: Subscription to analytics can be triggered directly towards NWDAF or can
be done via DCCF using procedure in clause 6.1.4.2.
2\. NWDAF discovers the AF that provides data collection (based on the AF
profiles registered in NRF) as described in TS 23.502 [3].
Step 3a is used for the AF in trusted domain while step 3b is used for the AF
in untrusted domain.
3a. NWDAF subscribes to the AF in trusted domain for UE data collection (i.e.
input data from UE for analytics), by using Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe as
defined in clause 5.2.19.2 of TS 23.502 [3]. The NWDAF request contains an
Application ID known in the core network and the UE Application provides the
Application ID configured in the UE Application. The AF binds the NWDAF
request for an Application Id and the UE data collection for an Application Id
configured in the UE.
3b. NWDAF subscribes to the AF in untrusted domain for UE data collection
(i.e. input data from UE for analytics), by using step 2 and step 3 of the
procedure that is described in Figure 6.2.2.3-1.
NOTE: For steps 3a and 3b, data collection can also be triggered using DCCF,
as specified in clause 6.2.6.3.
4\. The AF collects the UE data using either direct or indirect data
collection procedure in clause 6.2.8.2.1. The establishment of the connection
can be performed at any time prior to this. The AF links the data collection
request from step 3 to the user plane connection as described in clause
6.2.8.2.4.
NOTE 1: The Direct data collection and indirect data collection procedure is
described in TS 26.531 [32].
Step 5a is used for the AF in trusted domain while step 5b is used for the AF
in untrusted domain.
5a. The AF in trusted domain receives the input data from the UE and processes
the data (e.g. anonymizes, aggregates and normalizes) according to the SLA
that is configured in the AF described in clause 6.2.8.1 and Event ID(s) and
Event Filter(s) set during step 3a. The trusted AF then notifies the NWDAF on
the processed data according to the NWDAF subscription in step 3a.
5b. The AF in untrusted domain receives the input data from the UE and
processes the data (e.g. anonymizes, aggregates and normalizes) according to
the SLA that is configured in the AF described in clause 6.2.8.1 and Event
ID(s) and Event Filter(s) set during step 3b. The untrusted AF notifies the
NWDAF on the processed data by using step 5b (i.e. Step 4 and step 5 of the
procedure that described in Figure 6.2.2.3-1).
NOTE 2: If NWDAF requests the same data from multiple UEs, i.e. a determined
list of UEs or \"any UE\" as the Target of Analytics Reporting, the AF can
process (e.g. anonymize, aggregate and normalize) the data from multiple UEs
according to the Event ID(s) and Event Filter(s) received from NWDAF during
step 3a or 3b before notifying the NWDAF on the processed data in step 5a (if
the AF is in trusted domain) or step 5b (if the AF is in untrusted domain).
6\. The NWDAF produces analytics using the UE data received from the AF.
7\. The NWDAF provides analytics to the consumer NF.
If the Target of Analytics Reporting that was received from the consumer in
step 1 includes an Internal Group ID, NWDAF includes such Internal Group ID in
step 3a or step 3b to AF. In the case of step 3b, NEF translates the Internal
Group ID to an External Group ID.
If the Target of Analytics Reporting that was received from consumer in step 1
is \"any UE\", NWDAF may either set the target of event reporting to \"any
UE\" in step 3a or 3b to AF, or may determine a list of SUPIs from AMF and/or
SMF based on the Analytics Filter Information and sends the step 3a or 3b to
AF for the determined list of UEs.
NOTE 3: It is assumed that the AF is provisioned with the list of UE IDs
(GPSIs or SUPIs) belonging to an External or Internal Group ID.
##### 6.2.8.2.4 Correlation between UE data collection and the NWDAF data
request
##### 6.2.8.2.4.1 General {#general-14 .H6}
The UE IP address is used to identify the user plane connection established
between the UE application and the AF for data collection, while the AF
receives the Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe to request for the specific UE data
collection by using SUPI (for AF in trusted domain) or external UE ID (i.e.
GPSI) (for AF in untrusted domain). AF is required to correlate the UE IP
address to the SUPI or to GPSI.
If the AF supports requests addressed to External Group ID (for AF in
untrusted domain) or Internal Group ID (for AF in internal trust domain), the
AF must correlate the list of external UE ID (i.e. GPSI) or SUPI,
respectively, with the group(s) the UE belongs to, so that the AF can further
correlate the UE ID (external or internal) to the UE IP address.
AF may indicate in NF profile and register to NRF in clause 6.2.8.2.2 if it
supports to do the mapping itself or ask NWDAF to do it. If the AF is in a
trusted domain, it may also indicate the supported list of S-NSSAI, DNN
combinations to NRF in NF profile.
Accordingly, if AF supports the mapping, for AF in trusted domain, it is
required to correlate the UE IP address and SUPI as described in clause
6.2.8.2.4.2 after receiving the data collection request from NWDAF and there
is no mapping information storage in the AF. For AF in untrusted domain, the
procedure to correlate the UE IP address and GPSI is described in clause
6.2.8.2.4.4.
NWDAF may collect the mapping information as described in clause 6.2.8.2.4.4
before sending request to AF in step 3a or step 3b in Figure 6.2.8.2.3-1.
If the user plane session between the UE and the AF is released, the AF /
NWDAF shall remove the stored correlation information between UE IP address /
prefix and UE SUPI / GPSI.
For all procedures defined in this clause 6.2.8.2.4.3, a specific combination
of S-NSSAI/DNN shall be corresponding to a single PDU session for a UE to
access the AF (either in trusted domain or untrusted domain).
NOTE: Based on implementation, for the UE to access the Data Collection AF,
only a single PDU Session is allowed to be established to the Data Collection
AF, by configuring a specific S-NSSAI/DNN for the Data Collection AF only.
##### 6.2.8.2.4.2 AF in trusted domain correlates UE data collection and NWDAF
request {#af-in-trusted-domain-correlates-ue-data-collection-and-nwdaf-request
.H6}
If the AF receives the Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe/Request including Target
for Event Reporting set to SUPI and not including the UE\'s IP address and the
AF does not locally store the UE\'s IP address, the AF finds the PDU
session(s) serving the SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI from UDM and the allocated IPv4
address or IPv6 prefix or both from SMF as described in Figure 6.2.8.2.4.2-1.
Figure 6.2.8.2.4.2-1: AF in trusted domain correlates UE data collection and
NWDAF request
0\. At the establishment of the user plane connection between the UE
Application and the AF, the AF stores the UE IP address (for both direct and
indirect reporting) as described clause 6.2.8.2.1.
1\. The AF receives a request to retrieve input data as described in clause
6.2.8.2.3 including a SUPI. The AF finds the SMF serving the PDU session(s)
for this SUPI using Nudm_UECM_Get_Request including SUPI, type of requested
information set to SMF Registration Info and the S-NSSAI and DNN, as defined
in clause 5.3.2.5.7 in TS 29.503 [26].
2\. The UDM provides the SMF id and the corresponding PDU Session id, S-NSSAI,
DNN using Nudm_UECM_Get_Response to the AF. Using the AF supported S-NSSAI,
DNN and the received information from UDM, AF determines the PDU session used
for the user plane connection between UE and AF.
3\. The AF sends Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe to the SMF identified in step 2,
including the Target for Event Reporting set to the PDU Session id(s) provided
in step 2 and the Event ID set to IP address/prefix allocation/change.
4\. The SMF provides the allocated IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix to the AF.
5\. The AF correlates the UE data that includes the UE IP address and the
NWDAF request for a SUPI using the retrieved IPv4 address or IP v6 prefix.
If the user plane session between the UE and the AF is released, the AF shall
remove the stored correlation information between the UE IP address / prefix
and SUPI.
##### 6.2.8.2.4.3 AF in untrusted domain correlates UE data collection and
NWDAF request {#af-in-untrusted-domain-correlates-ue-data-collection-and-
nwdaf-request .H6}
If the AF receives the Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe from NWDAF, via NEF,
including Target for Event Reporting set to GPSI and not including the UE\'s
IP address and the AF does not locally store the UE\'s IP address, the AF
request the NEF to provide the allocated IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix or both
as described in Figure 6.2.8.2.4.3-1.
NOTE 1: The NWDAF can also provide the UE IP address to the AF as described in
clause 6.2.8.2.4.1.
Figure 6.2.8.2.4.3-1: AF in untrusted domain correlates UE data collection and
NWDAF request
0\. Same step as step 0 in figure 6.2.8.2.4.3-1.
1\. The AF receives a request to retrieve input data as described in clause
6.2.8.2.3 including a GPSI. The AF requests NEF to provide the IPv4address or
IPv6 prefix or both serving the PDU session for this GPSI towards the AF using
Nnef_UEAddress_Get_Request.
2\. The NEF is configured with the DNN, S-NSSAI to access this AF. The NEF
finds the SMF serving the PDU session(s) for this GPSI, DNN, S-NSSAI using
Nudm_UECM_Get_Request including type of requested information set to SMF
Registration Info and the S-NSSAI and DNN, as defined in clause 5.3.2.5.7 of
TS 29.503 [26].
NOTE 2: If there are more than one (DNN, S-NSSAI) combination to access this
AF, the NEF will find the SMF(s) serving the PDU session(s) to any of these
(DNN, S-NSSAI) combinations.
3\. The UDM provides the SMF id(s) and the tuple (PDU Session id (S-NSSAI,
DNN) using Nudm_UECM_Get_Response to the NEF. Using the configuration in NEF,
as described in step 2, the NEF determines the PDU session used for the user
plane connection between UE and AF.
4\. The NEF sends Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe to the SMF(s) identified in
step 3, including the Target for Event Reporting set to the PDU Session id(s)
provided in step 3 and the Event ID set to IP address/prefix
allocation/change.
5\. The SMF provides the allocated IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix or both to the
NEF.
6\. The NEF provides the allocated IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix or both
provided by SMF in step 5 to the AF.
7\. The AF correlates the UE data that includes the UE IP address and the
NWDAF request for the GPSI using the retrieved IPv4 address or IP v6 prefix.
If the user plane session between the UE and the AF is released, the AF shall
remove the stored correlation information between the UE IP address / prefix
and GPSI.
##### 6.2.8.2.4.4 NWDAF correlates UE data collection and NWDAF request for
trusted AF and untrusted AF {#nwdaf-correlates-ue-data-collection-and-nwdaf-
request-for-trusted-af-and-untrusted-af .H6}
NWDAF receives the analytics subscription from consumer and discover an AF as
described in clause 6.2.8.2.3. NWDAF finds the PDU session(s) serving the
SUPI, DNN, S-NSSAI from UDM and the allocated IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix from
SMF as described in Figure 6.2.8.2.4.4-1.
Figure 6.2.8.2.4.4-1: NWDAF correlates UE data collection and NWDAF request
1\. The NWDAF finds the SMF(s) serving the PDU session(s) for this SUPI or
GPSI using Nudm_UECM_Get_Request including SUPI or GPSI, type of requested
information set to SMF Registration Info and the list of S-NSSAI and DNN
combinations, as defined in clause 5.3.2.5.7 in TS 29.503 [26]. The NWDAF
acquires the DNN, S-NSSAI used to access the AF using Nnrf_NFDiscovery_Request
service operation or is configured with the DNN, S-NSSAI used to access the
AF.
2\. The UDM provides the SMF id(s) and the corresponding PDU Session id(s),
per S-NSSAI, DNN combination using Nudm_UECM_Get_Response to the NWDAF. Based
on the S-NSSAI, DNN used to access the AF in step 1, NWDAF determines the PDU
session used for the user plane connection between UE and AF.
3\. The NWDAF sends Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe to the SMF identified in step
2, including the Target for Event Reporting set to the PDU Session id(s)
provided in step 2 and the Event ID set to IP address/prefix
allocation/change.
4\. The SMF provides the allocated IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix to the NWDAF.
5\. Step 3a for AF in trusted domain or step 3b for AF in untrusted domain in
Figure 6.2.8.2.3-1 is performed with the exception that NWDAF sets the
allocated IPv4 address or IPv6 prefix that were received in step 4 as target
of event reporting.
If NWDAF subscribed for the PDU session used for the user plane connection
between the UE and the AF is released notification in step 3, the SMF informs
the NWDAF that the UE IP address / prefix is released via
Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify. Based on this information, the NWDAF shall remove
the stored correlation information between the UE IP address / prefix and
SUPI.
##### 6.2.8.2.4a Void
### 6.2.9 User consent for analytics
Depending on local policy or regulations, to protect the privacy of user data,
the data collection, ML model training and analytics generation for a SUPI or
GPSI, Internal or External_Group_Id or \"any UE\" may be subject to user
consent bound to a purpose, such as analytics or ML model training. The user
consent is subscription information stored in the UDM, which includes:
a) whether the user authorizes the collection and usage of its data for a
particular purpose;
b) the purpose for data collection, e.g. analytics or model training.
The NWDAF retrieves the user consent to data collection and usage from UDM for
a user, i.e. SUPI prior to collecting user data from an NF as described in
clause 6.2.2 and from a DCCF as described in clause 6.2.6.
If a request for analytics is for \"any UE\", meaning that the consumer
requests analytics for all UEs registered in an area, such as a S-NSSAI or DNN
or AoI, then the NWDAF resolves \"any UE\" into a list of SUPIs using the
Namf_EventExposure service with EventId \"Number of UEs served by the AMF and
located in an area of interest\" and retrieves user consent for each SUPI. If
a request for analytics is for an Internal or External Group Id, NWDAF
resolves it into a list of SUPIs and retrieves user consent for each SUPI.
If user consent for a user is granted, then the NWDAF subscribes to user
consent updates in UDM using Nudm_SDM_Subscribe service operation. Otherwise,
the NWDAF excludes the corresponding SUPI from the request to collect data and
generate analytics or ML model on the other users for which user consent is
granted if the request is for a group of UE or \"any UE.
When data is collected from the UE Application, the ASP is responsible to
obtain user consent to share data with the MNO.
If the UDM notifies that the user consent changed, then the NWDAF checks if
the user consent is not granted for the purpose of analytics or model
training. If user consent was revoked for a UE, the NWDAF stops data
collection for that UE. For analytics subscriptions to UE related analytics
with the Target of Analytics Reporting set to that UE, the NWDAF stops
generation of new analytics and stops providing affected analytics to
consumers. For ML model subscriptions with Target of ML Model Reporting set to
that UE, the NWDAF containing MTLF stops (re-)training of ML model(s) using
data from the UE and stops providing the ML model(s) to consumers (NWDAF
containing AnLF) for analytics. If the Target of Analytics Reporting or Target
of ML model Reporting is either an Internal or External Group Id or a list of
SUPIs or \"any UE\", the NWDAF skips those SUPIs that do not grant user
consent for the purpose of analytics or model training. The NWDAF may
unsubscribe to be notified of user consent updates from UDM for users for
which data consent has been revoked.
NOTE: The NWDAF can provide analytics or ML model to consumers that request
analytics or ML model for an Internal or External Group Id, or for \"any UE\",
skipping those users for which consent is not granted or is revoked.
The Analytics ID that needs to check user consent before collecting input data
are those that collect input data per user, i.e. per SUPI, GPSI, Internal or
External Group Id, or those with the Target of Analytics Reporting or Target
of ML model Reporting set to a SUPI, GPSI or External or Internal Group Id and
are described in clause 6.
## 6.2A Procedure for ML Model Provisioning
### 6.2A.0 General
This clause presents the procedure for the ML Model provisioning.
In this Release of the specification an NWDAF containing AnLF is locally
configured with (a set of) IDs of NWDAFs containing MTLF and the Analytics
ID(s) supported by each NWDAF containing MTLF to retrieve trained ML models.
An NWDAF containing AnLF may use NWDAF discovery for NWDAF containing MTLF
within the set of configured IDs of NWDAFs containing MTLF, if necessary. An
NWDAF containing MTLF may determine that further training for an existing ML
model is needed when it receives the ML model subscription or the ML model
request.
NOTE: ML Model provisioning/sharing between multiple MTLFs is not supported in
this Release of the specification.
### 6.2A.1 ML Model Subscribe/Unsubscribe
The procedure in Figure 6.2A.1-1 is used by an NWDAF service consumer, i.e. an
NWDAF containing AnLF to subscribe/unsubscribe at another NWDAF, i.e. an NWDAF
containing MTLF, to be notified when ML Model Information on the related
Analytics becomes available, using Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision services as defined
in clause 7.5. The ML Model Information is used by an NWDAF containing AnLF to
derive analytics. The service is also used by an NWDAF to modify existing ML
Model Subscription(s). An NWDAF can be at the same time a consumer of this
service provided by other NWDAF(s) and a provider of this service to other
NWDAF(s).
Figure 6.2A.1-1: ML Model for analytics subscribe/unsubscribe
1\. The NWDAF service consumer (i.e. an NWDAF containing AnLF) subscribes to,
modifies, or cancels subscription for a (set of) trained ML Model(s)
associated with a (set of) Analytics ID(s) by invoking the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe / Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Unsubscribe
service operation. The parameters that can be provided by the NWDAF service
consumer are listed in clause 6.2A.2.
When a subscription for a trained ML model associated with an Analytics ID is
received, the NWDAF containing MTLF may:
\- determine whether an existing trained ML Model can be used for the
subscription; or
\- determine whether triggering further training for an existing trained ML
models is needed for the subscription.
If the NWDAF containing MTLF determines that further training is needed, this
NWDAF may initiate data collection from NFs, (e.g. AMF/DCCF/ADRF), UE
Application (via AF) or OAM as described in clause 6.2, to generate the ML
model.
If the service invocation is for a subscription modification or subscription
cancelation, the NWDAF service consumer includes an identifier (Subscription
Correlation ID) to be modified in the invocation of
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe.
2\. If the NWDAF service consumer subscribes to a (set of) trained ML model(s)
associated to a (set of) Analytics ID(s), the NWDAF containing MTLF notifies
the NWDAF service consumer with the trained ML Model Information (containing a
(set of) file address of the trained ML model) by invoking
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation. The content of trained ML
Model Information that can be provided by the NWDAF containing MTLF is
specified in clause 6.2A.2.
The NWDAF containing MTLF also invokes the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify
service operation to notify an available re-trained ML model when the NWDAF
containing MTLF determines that the previously provided trained ML Model
required re-training at step 1.
When the step 1 is for a subscription modification (i.e. including
Subscription Correlation ID), the NWDAF containing MTLF may provide either a
new trained ML model different to the previously provided one, or re-trained
ML model by invoking Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify service operation.
### 6.2A.2 Contents of ML Model Provisioning
The consumers of the ML model provisioning services (i.e. an NWDAF containing
AnLF) as described in clause 7.5 and clause 7.6 may provide the input
parameters as listed below:
\- Information of the analytics for which the requested ML model is to be
used, including:
\- A list of Analytics ID(s): identifies the analytics for which the ML model
is used.
\- [OPTIONAL] ML Model Filter Information: enables to select which ML model
for the analytics is requested, e.g. S-NSSAI, Area of Interest. Parameter
types in the ML Model Filter Information are the same as parameter types in
the Analytics Filter Information which are defined in procedures.
\- [OPTIONAL] Target of ML Model Reporting: indicates the object(s) for which
ML model is requested, e.g. specific UEs, a group of UE(s) or any UE (i.e. all
UEs).
\- ML Model Reporting Information with the following parameters:
\- (Only for Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Subscribe) ML Model Reporting Information
Parameters as per Event Reporting Information Parameter defined in Table
4.15.1-1, TS 23.502 [3].
\- [OPTIONAL] ML Model Target Period: indicates time interval [start, end] for
which ML model for the Analytics is requested. The time interval is expressed
with actual start time and actual end time (e.g. via UTC time).
\- A Notification Target Address (+ Notification Correlation ID) as defined in
clause 4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3], allowing to correlate notifications received
from the NWDAF containing MTLF with this subscription.
The NWDAF containing MTLF provides to the consumer of the ML model
provisioning service operations as described in clause 7.5 and 7.6, the output
information as listed below:
\- (Only for Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision_Notify) The Notification Correlation
Information.
\- ML Model Information, which includes the ML model file address (e.g. URL or
FQDN) for the Analytics ID(s).
\- [OPTIONAL] Validity period: indicates time period when the provided ML
Model Information applies.
\- [OPTIONAL] Spatial validity: indicates Area where the provided ML Model
Information applies.
NOTE: Spatial validity and Validity period are determined by MTLF internal
logic and it is a subset of AoI if provided in ML Model Filter Information and
of ML Model Target Period, respectively.
### 6.2A.3 ML Model request
The procedure in Figure 6.2A.3-1 is used by an NWDAF service consumer, i.e. an
NWDAF containing AnLF to request and get from another NWDAF, i.e. an NWDAF
containing MTLF ML Model Information, using Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo services as
defined in clause 7.6. The ML Model Information is used by an NWDAF containing
AnLF to derive analytics. An NWDAF can be at the same time a consumer of this
service provided by other NWDAF(s) and a provider of this service to other
NWDAF(s).
Figure 6.2A.3-1: ML model Request
1\. The NWDAF service consumer (i.e. an NWDAF containing AnLF) requests a (set
of) ML Model(s) associated with a (set of) Analytics ID(s) by invoking
Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request service operation. The parameters that can be
provided by the NWDAF Service Consumer are listed in clause 6.2A.2.
When a request to an ML Model Information for the Analytics is received, the
NWDAF containing MTLF may:
\- determine whether an existing trained ML Model can be used for the request;
or
\- determine whether triggering further training for an existing trained ML
models is needed for the request.
If the NWDAF containing MTLF determines that further training is needed, this
NWDAF may initiate data collection from NFs, (e.g. AMF/DCCF/ADRF), UE
Application (via AF) or OAM as described in clause 6.2, to generate the ML
model.
2\. The NWDAF containing MTLF responds with the ML Model Information
(containing a (set of) file address of the trained ML model) to the NWDAF
service consumer by invoking Nnwdaf_MLModelInfo_Request response service
operation. The content of ML Model Information that can be provided by the
NWDAF containing MTLF is specified in clause 6.2A.2.
## 6.2B Analytics Data Repository procedures
### 6.2B.1 General
Collected data and analytics may be stored in ADRF, using procedure as
specified in clause 6.2B.2 and clause 6.2B.3. Collected data and analytics may
be deleted from ADRF, using procedure as specified in clause 6.2B.4.
### 6.2B.2 Historical Data and Analytics storage
The procedure depicted in figure 6.2B.2-1 is used by consumers (e.g. NWDAF,
DCCF or MFAF) to store historical data and/or analytics, i.e. data and/or
analytics related to past time period that has been obtained by the consumer.
After the consumer obtains data and/or analytics, consumer may store
historical data and/or analytics in an ADRF. Whether the consumer directly
contacts the ADRF or goes via the DCCF or via the Messaging Framework is based
on configuration.
Figure 6.2B.2-1: Historical Data and Analytics storage
1\. The consumer sends data and/or analytics to the ADRF by invoking the
Nadrf_DataManagement_StorageRequest (collected data with timestamp, analytics
with timestamp, Service Operation, Analytics Specification or Data
Specification) service operation.
2\. The ADRF stores the data and/or analytics sent by the consumer. The ADRF
may, based on implementation, determines whether the same data and/or
analytics is already stored or being stored based on the information sent in
step 1 by the consumer NF and, if the data and/or analytics is already stored
or being stored in the ADRF, the ADRF decides to not store again the data
and/or analytics sent by the consumer.
3\. The ADRF sends Nadrf_DataManagement_StorageRequest Response message to the
consumer indicating that data and/or analytics is stored, including when the
ADRF may have determined at step 2 that data or analytics is already stored.
### 6.2B.3 Historical Data and Analytics Storage via Notifications
The procedure depicted in figure 6.2B.3-1 is used by consumers (NWDAF, DCCF)
to store received notifications in the ADRF. The consumer requests the ADRF to
initiate a subscription for data and/or analytics. Data and/or analytics
provided in notifications as a result of the subsequent subscription by the
ADRF are stored in the ADRF.
Figure 6.2B.3-1: Historical Data and Analytics Storage via Notifications
1a-d. Based on provisioning or based on reception of a DataManagement
subscription request (e.g. see clause 6.2.6.3.2), the DCCF or the NWDAF
determines that notifications are to be stored in an ADRF.
2a-b. The DCCF or the NWDAF determines the ADRF where data and/or analytics
needs to be stored and requests that the ADRF subscribes to receive
notifications. The determination may be made based on configuration or
information supplied by the data consumer as described in clauses 6.1.4 and
6.2.6.3. The request to the ADRF specifies the data and/or analytics to which
the ADRF will subscribe by invoking the
Nadrf_DataManagement_StorageSubscriptionRequest service operation.
3\. [Optional] The ADRF may, based on implementation, determines whether the
same data and/or analytics is already stored or being stored, based on the
information sent in step 2 by the consumer.
4\. [Optional] If the data and/or analytics is already stored and/or being
stored in the ADRF, the ADRF sends
Nadrf_DataManagement_StorageSubscriptionRequest Response message to the
consumer indicating that data and/or analytics is stored.
5a-b. ADRF subscribes to the DCCF or the NWDAF to receive notifications,
providing its notification endpoint address and a notification correlation ID.
6\. The DCCF, the MFAF or the NWDAF sends Analytics or Data notifications
containing the notification correlation ID provided by the ADRF to ADRF
notification endpoint address. The Analytics or Data notifications shall
contain timestamp. The ADRF stores the notifications.
7a-b. The DCCF or the NWDAF determines that notifications no longer need to be
stored in the ADRF.
8a-b. The DCCF or the NWDAF requests that the ADRF unsubscribes to receive
notifications.
9a-b. The ADRF sends a request to the DCCF or the NWDAF to unsubscribe to data
notifications.
The NWDAF may interact with the Data Source and the DCCF may interact with the
Data Source and/or MFAF. Delivery notifications from the DCCF/MFAF or NWDAF to
the ADRF are subsequently halted.
### 6.2B.4 Data removal from an ADRF
The procedure depicted in figure 6.2B.4-1 is used by consumers (DCCF, NWDAF)
to remove data previously stored in an ADRF.
Figure 6.2B.4-1: Data Removal from an ADRF
1\. A consumer requests that specified data be deleted from the ADRF using
Nadrf_DataManagement_Delete request service operations.
2\. The ADRF deletes all copies of the stored data.
3\. The ADRF indicates the result (i.e. data deleted, data not found, data
found but not deleted) using Nadrf_DataManagement_Delete response service
operations.
## 6.3 Slice load level related network data analytics
### 6.3.1 General
The NWDAF provides slice load level information to a consumer NF on a Network
Slice level or a Network Slice instance level or both. The NWDAF is not
required to be aware of the current subscribers using the slice. The NWDAF
notifies slice specific network status analytics information to the consumer
NF that is subscribed to it. A consumer NF may collect directly slice specific
network status analytics information from NWDAF. This information is not
subscriber specific.
The NWDAF services as defined in the clause 7.2 and clause 7.3 are used to
expose slice load level analytics from the NWDAF to the consumer NF (e.g. PCF,
NSSF or AMF).
The consumer of these analytics shall indicate in the request or subscription:
\- Analytics ID = \"Load level information\";
\- Analytics Filter Information:
\- S-NSSAI and NSI ID;
NOTE: The use of NSI ID in the network is optional and depends on the
deployment choices of the operator. If used, the NSI ID is associated with
S-NSSAI. NSI ID is only applicable when the consumer of analytics is NSSF or
AMF.
\- optionally, the list of analytics subsets that are requested among those
specified in clause 6.3.3A;
\- an optional Area of Interest;
\- an optional list of NF types;
\- optionally, Load Level Threshold value;
\- optionally, \"maximum number of objects\" indicating the maximum number of
Network Slice instances expected in output, when the Analytics Filter
Information does not indicate an NSI ID; and
\- an Analytics target period indicating the time period over which the
statistics or predictions are requested.
### 6.3.2 Void

Otherwise slice instance load level related output analytics are provided
according to Tables 6.3.3A-1 and 6.3.3A-3.
The predictions are provided with a Validity Period, as defined in clause
6.1.3.
### 6.3.4 Procedures
Figure 6.3.4-1: Network Slice load analytics provided by NWDAF
Figure 6.3.4-1 shows the procedure for NWDAF to derive slice load analytics.
The steps are described as follows:
1\. A consumer NF subscribes to/requests a NWDAF using
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request service
operation (Analytics ID = Load level information and a set of Analytics
Filters (e.g. S-NSSAI, NSI ID, Area of Interest)).
2\. [OPTIONAL] If the NWDAF does not have already the slice information, it
gains the slice information from OAM (as described in clause 6.2.3) and
discovers from NRF the AMF, SMF and NSSF instance(s) relevant to the Analytics
Filters provided in the analytics subscription.
3\. [OPTIONAL] If the NSI ID(s) are not provided in the analytics subscription
by the consumer NF, the NWDAF invokes Nnssf_NSSelection_Get service operation
from NSSF to obtain the NSI ID(s) corresponding to the S-NSSAI in the
subscription.
NOTE: Step 4a to step 7 are conditional depending on the NWDAF internal logic
that determines the source(s) of data collection.
4a. [CONDITIONAL] The NWDAF may subscribe to input data in Table 6.3.2A-1 from
the OAM according to the data collection principles from the OAM described in
clause 6.2.3.
4b. [CONDITIONAL] The NWDAF may collect input data from the NRF (see clause
6.5) to derive slice instance resource usage statistics and predictions for a
Network Slice instance.
5\. [CONDITIONAL] The NWDAF may subscribe to the AMF(s) event exposure service
to collect data on the number of UEs currently registered on certain Network
Slice and, if available, its constituent Network Slice instance(s) as defined
in clause 6.3.2A. If required, the NWDAF may also collect the corresponding UE
IDs.
6\. [CONDITIONAL] The NWDAF may subscribe to the SMF(s) event exposure service
to collect data on the number of PDU sessions established and/or released at
the SMF on currently registered on certain Network Slice as defined in clause
6.3.2A. NWDAF can then use such collected data to determine the number of PDU
sessions established on i) a Network Slice; and ii) if available, on a Network
Slice instance by leveraging the data collected in step 5.
7\. [CONDITIONAL] The NWDAF may subscribe to one or multiple NSACFs to collect
data on either the number of UE registered in a S-NSSAI or the number of PDU
sessions established in a S-NSSAI as defined in clause 6.3.2A. When multiple
NSACFs are selected by the NWDAF for the S-NSSAI, the NWDAF aggregates the
reports from the NSACFs to derive the number of UEs registered in the S-NSSAI
or the number of PDU sessions established in the S-NSSAI.
8\. The NWDAF derives slice load analytics.
9\. The NWDAF delivers analytics to the consumer NF by invoking
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response
service operations.
## 6.4 Observed Service Experience related network data analytics
### 6.4.1 General
This clause specifies how NWDAF can provide Observed Service Experience (i.e.
average of observed Service MoS and/or variance of observed Service MoS
indicating service MOS distribution for services such as audio-visual
streaming as well as services that are not audio-visual streaming such as V2X
and Web Browsing services) analytics, in the form of statistics or
predictions, to a service consumer.
The Observed Service Experience analytics may provide one or more of the
following outputs:
\- Service Experience for a Network Slice: Service Experience for a UE or a
group of UEs or any UE in a Network Slice;
\- Service Experience for an Application: Service Experience for a UE or a
group of UEs or any UE in an Application or a set of Applications;
\- Service Experience for an Edge Application over a UP path: Service
experience for a UE or a group UEs or any UE in an Application or a set of
Applications over a specific UP path (UPF, DNAI and EC server);
\- Service Experience for an Application over a RAT Type or Frequency or both:
Service experience for a UE or a group of UEs in an Application or a set of
Applications over a RAT Type or over a Frequency or both as defined in Table
6.4.1-1.
Therefore, Observed Service experience may be provided as defined in clause
6.4.3. For example, individually per UE or group of UEs, or globally, averaged
per Application or averaged across a set of Applications on a Network Slice.
The service consumer may be an NF (e.g. PCF, NSSF, AMF), AF, or the OAM.
The consumer of these analytics shall indicate in the request or subscription:
\- Analytics ID = \"Service Experience\";
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: one or more SUPI(s) or Internal Group
Identifier(s), or \"any UE\";
\- Analytics Filter Information as defined in Table 6.4.1-1;
\- optionally, maximum number of objects and maximum number of SUPIs;
\- optionally, preferred level of accuracy of the analytics;
\- optionally, a list of analytics subsets that are requested (see clause
6.4.3)
\- optionally, preferred level of accuracy per analytics subset;
\- optionally, preferred order of results for the list of Application Service
Experiences and/or Slice instance service experiences: \"ascending\" or
\"descending\"; and
\- optionally, preferred granularity of location information: TA level or cell
level.

NOTE: A service consumer can use the Area of Interest in order to reduce the
amount of signalling that the analytics subscription or request generates.
\- An Analytics target period that indicates the time window for which the
statistics or predictions are requested;
\- In a subscription, the Notification Correlation Id and the Notification
Target Address;
\- Optionally, Reporting Thresholds, which apply only for subscriptions and
indicate conditions on the Service Experience to be reached in order to be
notified by the NWDAF (see Table 6.4.3-1 and Table 6.4.3-2).
The NWDAF shall notify the result of the analytics to the consumer as
specified in clause 6.4.3.
NWDAF collects the network data from AF (directly or via NEF) and from other
5GC NF(s) in order to calculate and provide statistics and predictions on the
observed service experience to a consumer NF or to OAM.
Based on the Analytics Filter information in Table 6.4.1-1 and the Target of
Analytics Reporting provided by the service consumer in the analytics
subscription or request, NWDAF determines whether service experience analytics
should be delivered for:
i) Application(s);
ii) Network Slice;
iii) both Application(s) and Network Slice;
iv) Edge Applications over a UP path;
v) Application(s) over RAT Type(s) and/or Frequency value(s).
If NWDAF is unable to differentiate based on the analytics subscription or
request, it provides service experience analytics for both Application(s) and
Network Slice.
If service experience for both Application(s) and Network Slice is desired but
the Target of Analytics Reporting or Analytics Filter information values (e.g.
Area of Interest) need to be different, separate subscriptions/requests may be
provided by the service consumer.
### 6.4.2 Input Data
The service data and performance data collected from the AF (including the
service data collected from the UE through the AF), the network data from
other 5GC NFs and the network data from OAM for observed service experience
are defined in Table 6.4.2-1, 6.4.2-1a, Table 6.4.2-2, Table 6.4.2-3 and Table
6.4.2-4 respectively.
Table 6.4.2-1: Service Data from AF related to the observed service experience
* * *
Information Source Description Application ID AF To identify the service and
support analytics per type of service (the desired level of service) IP filter
information AF Identify a service flow of the UE for the application Locations
of Application AF/NEF Locations of application represented by a list of
DNAI(s). The NEF may map the AF-Service-Identifier information to a list of
DNAI(s) when the DNAI(s) being used by the application are statically defined.
Service Experience AF Refers to the QoE per service flow as established in the
SLA and during on boarding. It can be either e.g. MOS or video MOS as
specified in ITU-T P.1203.3 [11] or a customized MOS for any kind of service
including those not related to video or voice. UE ID AF The list of UE ID(s)
that are associated with the Service Experience value(s). When the AF is
untrusted, GPSI(s) will be provided. When the AF is trusted SUPI(s) will be
provided. QoE metrics UE (via AF) QoE metrics observed at the UE(s). QoE
metrics and measurement as described in TS 26.114 [27], TS 26.247 [28], TS
26.118 [29], TS 26.346 [30], TS 26.512 [31] or ASP specific QoE metrics in TS
26.512 [31], as agreed in the SLA with the MNO, may be used. Timestamp AF A
time stamp associated to the Service Experience provided by the AF, mandatory
if the Service Experience is provided by the ASP. Application Server Instance
AF The IP address or FQDN of the Application Server that the UE had a
communication session when the measurement was made.
* * *
NWDAF subscribes to the service data from AF in the Table 6.4.2-1 either
directly for trusted AFs by invoking Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe service
(Event ID = Service Experience information, Event Filter information = Area of
Interest, Application ID) as defined in TS 23.502 [3], or indirectly for
untrusted AFs via NEF by invoking Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe service (Event
ID = Service Experience information, Event Filter information = Area of
Interest, Application ID) where NEF translates the Area of Interest into
geographic zone identifier(s). For the information whose source is UE (via
AF), the AF collects data from the UE as defined in clause 6.2.8.
NOTE: When the Service Experience is expressed as a customized MOS, the
customized MOS might be defined by the content provider or by the MNO and
might be based on the nature of the targeted service type (e.g. web browsing,
gaming, augmented reality, V2X, SMS).
Table 6.4.2-1a: Performance Data from AF
* * *
Information Source Description UE identifier AF IP address of the UE at the
time the measurements was made. UE location AF The location of the UE when the
performance measurement was made. Application ID AF To identify the service
and support analytics per type of service (the desired level of service). IP
filter information AF Identify a service flow of the UE for the application.
Locations of Application AF/NEF Locations of application represented by a list
of DNAI(s). The NEF may map the AF-Service-Identifier information to a list of
DNAI(s) when the DNAI(s) being used by the application are statically defined.
Application Server Instance address AF/NEF The IP address/FQDN of the
Application Server that the UE had a communication session when the
measurement was made. Performance Data AF The performance associated with the
communication session of the UE with an Application Server that includes:
Average Packet Delay, Average Loss Rate and Throughput. Timestamp AF A time
stamp associated to the Performance Data provided by the AF.
* * *
NWDAF subscribes to the performance data from AF in the Table 6.4.2-1a either
directly for trusted AFs by invoking Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe service
(Event ID = Performance Data, Event Filter information = Area of Interest,
Application ID) as defined in TS 23.502 [3], or indirectly for untrusted AFs
via NEF by invoking Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe service (Event ID =
Performance Data, Event Filter information = Area of Interest, Application ID)
where NEF translates the Area of Interest into geographic zone identifier(s).

NOTE 1: How NWDAF collects QoS flow Bit Rate, QoS flow Packet Delay, Packet
transmission and Packet retransmission information from UPF is not defined in
this Release of the specification.
NOTE 2: Care needs to be taken with regards to load and major signalling
caused when requesting Any UE. This could be achieved via utilization of some
event filters (e.g. Area of Interest for AMF), Analytics Reporting Information
(e.g. SUPImax), or sampling ratio as part of Event Reporting Information.
NWDAF subscribes to the network data from 5GC NF(s) in the Table 6.4.2-2 by
invoking Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe service operation with the following

### 6.4.4 Procedures to request Service Experience for an Application
Figure 6.4.4-1: Procedure for NWDAF providing Service Experience for an
Application
This procedure allows the consumer to request Analytics ID \"Service
Experience\" for a particular Application. The consumer includes both the
Application ID for which the Service Experience is requested and indicates
that the Target of Analytics Reporting is \"any UE\". If the Target for
Analytics Reporting is either a SUPI or an Internal-Group-Id the procedure in
clause 6.4.6 applies. At the same time, for an Application ID, a set of
initial QoS parameter combinations per service experience window (e.g. one is

A | | | | similar behaviour | | | | can be identified to | | | | specific ranges if | | | | the AF performs data | | | | processing (Data | | | | Anonymisation, | | | | Aggregation or | | | | Normalization) based | | | | on NWDAF request. | | | | UEs falling in the | | | | same range per UE | | | | attribute can form a | | | | collective attribute | | | | set. | | | | | | | | NOTE 3: The | | | | application ID(s) | | | | (either external or | | | | Internal) is | | | | optional. If the | | | | application ID(s) is | | | | not provided, the | | | | relevant application | | | | ID(s) can be | | | | identified by NWDAF | | | | based on the | | | | relevant event ID as | | | | registered in NRF as | | | | covered in | | | | clause 6.2.8.2.2. | | | | | | | | NOTE 4: List of UE | | | | IDs is optional and | | | | subject to support | | | | by the AF when | | | | processing the data | | | | based on NWDAF | | | | request. | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
Based on network configuration, NWDAF may discover the AF from the NRF as
defined in 6.2.8.2.2 (based on Collective Behaviour as Event ID or a
corresponding Application ID).
For AF in trusted domain, the NWDAF invokes step 3a in clause 6.2.8.2.3 by
using Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe service (Event ID = Collective Behaviour,
Event Filter information, Target of Event Reporting). The collective attribute
(see Table 6.5.2-5) can be indicated as part of event filter information as
defined in TS 23.502 [3]. Otherwise, the AF notifies for all collective
attributes within the area of interest.
For AF in untrusted domain, the NWDAF invokes step 3b in clause 6.2.8.2.3 by
using Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe (Event ID = Collective Behaviour, Event
Filter information, Target of Event Reporting). The collective attribute (see
Table 6.5.2-5) can be indicated as part of event filter information as defined
in TS 23.502 [3]. Otherwise, the AF via NEF notifies for all collective
attributes within the area of interest.
For Collective Behaviour of multiple UEs, NWDAF based on the configuration by
MNO may request certain type of data processing from the AF as part of event
filter information (e.g. for anonymisation, normalisation, aggregation). The
data processing requested by NWDAF is used to anonymise, normalise or
aggregate the same UE attribute from multiple UEs at the AF before notifying
to the NWDAF.
For each UE attribute of a specific UE, whether and how AF is processing the
data that is received from the UE depends on the SLA configured in AF (defined
in clause 6.2.8.1) and is not known by the NWDAF.
To determine NF load (per area of interest), NWDAF may collect and take into
account UE trajectory input data from the AF, defined in clause 6.7.2.2, Table
6.7.2.2-2 for UE mobility analytics in addition to MDT input data and /or
collective behaviour input data, defined in clause 6.5.2, Table 6.5.2-3 and
Table 6.5.2-5, respectively.
### 6.5.3 Output analytics
The NWDAF services as defined in the clause 7.2 and 7.3 are used to expose the
analytics. NF load statistics information are defined in Table 6.5.3-1. NF
load predictions information are defined in Table 6.5.3-2.
Table 6.5.3-1: NF load statistics

NOTE: The variations on per-instance NF load and resource usage could be
influenced by the number of running NF instances in addition to the load
itself.
The predictions are provided with a Validity Period, as defined in clause
6.1.3.
The number of resource status is limited by the maximum number of objects
provided as part of Analytics Reporting Information.
### 6.5.4 Procedures
The procedure depicted in Figure 6.5.4-1 allows a consumer NF to request
analytics to NWDAF for NF load of various NF instances as defined in 6.5.1.
Figure 6.5.4-1: NF load analytics provided by NWDAF
1\. The NF sends a request to the NWDAF for analytics for NF load for a
specific NF, using either the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription service. The Analytics ID is set to NF load
information, the Target of Analytics Reporting and the Analytics Filter
Information are set according to clause 6.5.1. The NF can request statistics
or predictions or both and can provide a time window.
2-5. If the request is authorized and in order to provide the requested
analytics, the NWDAF may need for each NF targeted instance to subscribe to
OAM services to retrieve the target NF resource usage and NF resources
configuration following steps captured in clause 6.2.3.2 for data collection
from OAM. The NWDAF may collect MDT input data per individual UE from OAM (see
Table 6.5.2-3). Steps 2-5 may be skipped when e.g. the NWDAF already has the
requested analytics.
6\. For Collective Behaviour attributes, if the request is authorized and in
order to provide the requested analytics, NWDAF may follow the UE Input Data
Collection Procedure via the AF as defined in clause 6.2.8 (see Table 6.5.2-4
and Table 6.5.2-5).
The NWDAF subscribes to the AF services as above invoking either
Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe or Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe service (Event ID
= Collective Behaviour, Event Filter information, Target of Event Reporting)
as defined in TS 23.502 [3]. The area of interest is set as part of Event
Filter information to specific TAs or AMF region. The UE data is collected
from UEs within the area of interest.
In the case of trusted AF, the NWDAF provides the Area of Interest as a list
of TAIs to the AF. In the case of untrusted AF, NEF translates the requested
Area of Interest provided as event filter by the NWDAF into geographic zone
identifier(s) that act as event filter for the AF.
For collective attributes as defined in Table 6.5.2-5, the AF processes (e.g.
anonymize, aggregate and normalize) the data from individual UEs per UE
attribute (see Table 6.5.2-4) based on Event Filters indicated by the NWDAF to
determine which ones display a collective behaviour within the area of
interest before notifying a collective attribute directly (trusted AF) or via
NEF (for untrusted AF) to the NWDAF. The AF will provide (per collective
attribute) e.g. the number of UEs that fulfil the collective attribute (within
an area of interest).
NOTE 1: The call flow only shows a subscription/notification model for the
simplicity, however both request-response and subscription-notification models
should be supported.
NOTE 2: If the target NF type is UPF, the NWDAF can collect the information as
listed in Table 6.5.2-2. How the NWDAF collects information is not defined in
this Release of the specification.
7a. The NWDAF subscribes to changes on the load and status of NF instances
registered in NRF and identified by their NF id from NRF using
Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusSubscribe service operation for each NF instance.
7b. NRF notifies NWDAF of changes on the load and status of the requested NF
instances by using Nnrf_NFManagement_NFStatusNotify service operation.
8\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics.
9\. The NWDAF provides requested NF load analytics to the NF along with the
corresponding Validity Period (only for predictions) or area of interest,
using either the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify, depending on the service used in step 1.
10-12. If at step 1 the NF has subscribed to receive continuous reporting of
NF load analytics, the NWDAF may generate new analytics and, when relevant
according to the Analytics target period and Reporting Threshold, provide them
along with the corresponding Validity Period (only for predictions) to the NF
upon reception of notification of new NF load information from OAM or NRF or
UE Input data notification via MDT or the AF (see Table 6.5.2-3 and Table
6.5.2-5).
NOTE 3: If the target NF type at step 1 is UPF, the NWDAF can generate new
analytics when receiving new information as listed in Table 6.5.2-2. How the
NWDAF receives such new information is not defined in this Release of the
specification.
## 6.6 Network Performance Analytics

### 6.6.4 Procedures
Figure 6.6.4-1: Procedure for subscription to network performance analytics
1\. The NF sends Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request (Analytics ID=\"Network Performance\", Target of
Analytics Reporting, Analytics Filter Information = \"Area of Interest\",
Analytics Reporting Information = (\"Reporting Thresholds\" and Analytics
target Period(s))) to the NWDAF.
2a-2d. The NWDAF discovers from NRF the AMF(s) belonging to the AMF Region(s)
that include(s) the Area of Interest and subscribes to NF load and status
information from NRF about these AMF(s).
3a-3b. The NWDAF subscribes to OAM services to get the status and load
information and the resource usage on the Area of Interest in clause 6.6.2,
following the procedure captured in Clause 6.2.3.2.
4a-4b. The NWDAF collects the number of UEs located in the Area of Interest
from AMF using Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe service, including the Target of
Event Reporting provided as an input parameter (i.e. any UE or Internal Group
Identifier).
5\. The NWDAF derives the requested analytics.
6\. The NWDAF sends Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response (Network Performance analytics,
Subscription Correlation Id, Confidence).
7-8. A change of network performance information, i.e. change in the gNB
status information, gNB resource usage, communication performance and mobility
performance in the area of interest at the observed period, is detected by
OAM, or a change in the NF load information is reported by NRF and is notified
to NWDAF.
9\. The NWDAF derives new analytics taking into account the most recent data
collected.
10\. When relevant according to the Analytics target period and Reporting
Thresholds, the NWDAF provides a notification using
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify (Network Performance analytics,
Subscription Correlation Id, Confidence).
## 6.7 UE related analytics
### 6.7.1 General
This clause specifies the UE related analytics which can be provided by NWDAF:
\- UE mobility analytics;
\- UE communication analytics;
\- Expected UE behavioural parameters related network data analytics; and
\- Abnormal behaviour related network data analytics.
The NWDAF service consumer may request for these analytics separately, or in a
combined way. As an example, an NWDAF service consumer may learn from the
NWDAF the expected UE behaviour parameters as defined in clause 4.15.6.3 of TS
23.502 [3] for a group of UEs or a specific UE, by requesting analytics for
both UE mobility (see clause 6.7.2) and for UE communication (see clause
6.7.3).
Depending on local regulations, the NWDAF retrieves user consent for the UE
with UDM prior to data collection as defined in clause 6.2.2.2 or clause
6.2.2.3. If user consent to collect data is not granted by the UE, the NWDAF
rejects/cancels any analytics subscriptions to any of the UE related analytics
with target for analytics set to the SUPI or GPSI of that UE. If the target
for analytics is either an Internal or External Group Id or a list of SUPIs or
\"any UE\", the NWDAF skips those SUPIs that do not grant user consent for the
purpose of analytics or model training.
NOTE: Possible uses of such analytics is for the AMF to learn about expected
UE behaviour to derive appropriate MICO mode configuration, or for an AF to
learn about expected UE behaviour to further provision 5GC with appropriate UE
parameters.
### 6.7.2 UE mobility analytics
#### 6.7.2.1 General
NWDAF supporting UE mobility statistics or predictions shall be able to
collect UE mobility related information from NF, OAM and to perform data
analytics to provide UE mobility statistics or predictions.
The service consumer may be a NF (e.g. AMF, SMF or AF).
The consumer of these analytics may indicate in the request:
\- Analytics ID = \"UE Mobility\".
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: a single UE (SUPI) or a group of UEs (an
Internal Group ID);
\- Analytics Filter Information optionally containing:
\- Area of Interest (AOI): restricts the scope of the UE mobility analytics to
the provided area;
\- Visited Area(s) of Interest (visited AOI(s)): additional filter to only
consider UEs that are currently (i.e. now) in the \"AOI\" and had previously
(i.e. in the \"Analytics target period\") been in at least one of the Visited
AOI(s). If this parameter is provided, the Analytics target period shall be in
the past (i.e. supported for statistics only);
NOTE 1: For LADN service, the consumer (e.g. SMF) provides the LADN DNN to
refer the LADN service area as the AOI.
\- An Analytics target period indicates the time period over which the
statistics or predictions are requested;
NOTE 2: For regular analytics scenarios, the Analytics target period is
associated with the Analytics Filter Information = AOI, while for the scenario
that Analytics ID=UE Mobility and Analytics Filter Information = (AOI and
visited AOI(s)), as described in this clause, the Analytics target period is
associated with the visited AOI(s) and to obtain the statistics for those UEs
that currently reside in the AOI and had previously (i.e. in the \"Analytics
target period\") been in at least one of the Visited AOI(s).
\- Optionally, maximum number of objects;
\- Preferred level of accuracy of the analytics;
\- Preferred order of results for the time slot entries: ascending or
descending time slot start;
\- Optionally, preferred granularity of location information: TA level or cell
level; and
\- In a subscription, the Notification Correlation Id and the Notification
Target Address are included.
#### 6.7.2.2 Input Data
The NWDAF supporting data analytics on UE mobility shall be able to collect UE
mobility information from OAM, 5GC and AFs. The detailed information collected
by the NWDAF could be MDT data from OAM, network data from 5GC and/or service
data from AFs:
\- UE mobility information from OAM is UE location carried in MDT data;
\- Network data related to UE mobility from 5GC is UE location information, UE
location trends or UE access behaviour trends, as defined in the Table
6.7.2.2-1;
Table 6.7.2.2-1: UE Mobility information collected from 5GC
* * *
Information Source Description UE ID AMF SUPI UE locations (1..max) AMF UE
positions >UE location TA or cells that the UE enters (NOTE) >Timestamp A time
stamp when the AMF detects the UE enters this location Type Allocation code
(TAC) AMF To indicate the terminal model and vendor information of the UE. The
UEs with the same TAC may have similar mobility behaviour. The UE whose
mobility behaviour is unlike other UEs with the same TAC may be an abnormal
one. Frequent Mobility Registration Update AMF A UE (e.g. a stationary UE) may
re-select between neighbour cells due to radio coverage fluctuations. This may
lead to multiple Mobility Registration Updates if the cells belong to
different registration areas. The number of Mobility Registration Updates N
within a period M may be an indication for abnormal ping-pong behaviour, where
N and M are operator\'s configurable parameters. UE access behaviour trends
AMF Metrics on UE state transitions (e.g. access, RM and CM states, handover).
UE location trends AMF Metrics on UE locations. NOTE: UE location includes
either the last known location or the current location, under the conditions
defined in Table 4.15.3.1-1 in TS 23.502 [3].
* * *
\- Service data related to UE mobility provided by AFs is defined in the Table
6.7.2.2-2;
Table 6.7.2.2-2: Service Data from AF related to UE mobility
* * *
Information Description UE ID Could be external UE ID (i.e. GPSI) Application
ID Identifying the application providing this information UE trajectory
(1..max) Timestamped UE positions >UE location Geographical area that the UE
enters >Timestamp A time stamp when UE enters this area NOTE: The application
ID is optional. If the application ID is omitted, the collected UE mobility
information can be applicable to all the applications for the UE.
* * *
Depending on the requested level of accuracy, data collection may be provided
on samples (e.g. spatial subsets of UEs or UE group, temporal subsets of UE
location information).
NOTE: Reporting current UE location can cause AMF to request NG-RAN to report
UE location and consequently extra signalling and load in NG-RAN and AMF. The
consumer retrieving data from AMF needs to use current location with care to
avoid excessive signalling.
#### 6.7.2.3 Output Analytics
The NWDAF supporting data analytics on UE mobility shall be able to provide UE
mobility analytics to consumer NFs or AFs. The analytics results provided by
the NWDAF could be UE mobility statistics as defined in table 6.7.2.3-1, UE
mobility predictions as defined in Table 6.7.2.3-2:
Table 6.7.2.3-1: UE mobility statistics
* * *
Information Description UE group ID or UE ID Identifies a UE or a group of
UEs, e.g. internal group ID defined in clause 5.9.7 of TS 23.501 [2], SUPI
(see NOTE 1). Time slot entry (1..max) List of time slots during the Analytics
target period > Time slot start Time slot start within the Analytics target
period > Duration Duration of the time slot > UE location (1..max) Observed
location statistics (see NOTE 2) >> UE location TA or cells which the UE stays
(see NOTE 3) >> Ratio Percentage of UEs in the group (in the case of a UE
group)
* * *

Duration of the time slot > UE location (1..max) Predicted location prediction
during the Analytics target period >> UE location TA or cells where the UE or
UE group may move into (see NOTE 3) >> Confidence Confidence of this
prediction >> Ratio Percentage of UEs in the group (in the case of a UE group)
* * *
NOTE: When Target of Analytics Reporting is an individual UE, one UE ID (i.e.
SUPI) will be included, the NWDAF will provide the analytics mobility result
(i.e. list of (predicted) time slots) to NF service consumer(s) for the UE.
NOTE 2: If Visited AOI(s) was provided in the analytics request/subscription,
the UE location provides information on the observed location(s) that the UE
or group of UEs had been residing during the Analytics Target Period.
NOTE 3: When possible and applicable to the access type, UE location is
provided according to the preferred granularity of location information.
The results for UE groups address the group globally. The ratio is the
proportion of UEs in the group at a given location at a given time.
The number of time slots and UE locations is limited by the maximum number of
objects provided as part of Analytics Reporting Information
The time slots shall be provided by order of time, possibly overlapping. The
locations shall be provided by decreasing value of ratio for a given time
slot. The sum of all ratios on a given time slot must be equal or less than
100%. Depending on the list size limitation, the least probable locations on a
given Analytics target period may not be provided.
#### 6.7.2.4 Procedures
The NWDAF can provide UE mobility related analytics, in the form of statistics
or predictions or both, directly to another NF. If the NF is an AF and when
the AF is untrusted, the AF will request analytics via the NEF and the NEF
will then convey the request to NWDAF.
NOTE: In the case of untrusted AF the Target of Analytics Reporting can be a
GPSI or an External Group Identifier that is mapped in the 5GC to a SUPI or an
Internal Group Identifier.
Figure 6.7.2.4-1: UE mobility analytics provided to an NF
1\. The NF sends a request (Analytics ID = UE mobility, Target of Analytics
Reporting = UE id or Internal Group ID, Analytics Filter Information = AOI,
Analytics Reporting Information= Analytics target period) to the serving NWDAF
for analytics information on a specific UE or a group of UEs, using either the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription service to derive UE
mobility information. The NF can request statistics or predictions or both.
For LADN service, the NF (i.e. SMF) provides LADN DNN as AOI in the Analytics
Filter Information.
If NF wants to obtain the aggregated mobility analytics of those UEs, that
currently reside in the AOI and had visited at least one of visited AOI(s)
during an Analytics target period, the NF may send a request for UE mobility
analytics with Analytics ID = UE mobility, Target of Analytics Reporting = UE
group ID or UE ID, Analytics Filter Information = (AOI, visited AOI(s)),
Analytics Reporting information = Analytics target period. In this case, the
requested mobility analytics is a statistics.
2\. If the request is authorized and in order to provide the requested
analytics, the NWDAF may subscribe to events with all the serving AMFs for the
requested UE(s), for notification of location changes. This step may be
skipped when e.g. the NWDAF already has the requested analytics available.
The NWDAF subscribes the service data for the requested UE(s) from AF(s) in
the Table 6.7.2.2-2 by invoking Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe service or
Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe (if via NEF) using event ID \"UE Mobility
information\" as defined in TS 23.502 [3].
The NWDAF collects UE mobility information from OAM for the requested UE(s),
following the procedure captured in clause 6.2.3.2.
NOTE 1: The NWDAF determines the AMF serving the UE or the group of UEs as
described in clause 6.2.2.1.
3\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics.
If in step 1 the NWDAF receives analytics subscription/request from NF to
obtain the aggregated mobility analytics of those UEs, which currently reside
in AOI and had visited at least one of visited AOI(s) during an Analytics
target period and if visited AOI(s) and AOI are covered by different NWDAFs,
in addition to the data collected in the AOI in step 2, the NWDAF can also
obtain UE mobility analytics in one of the visited AOI(s) during the Analytics
target period from other NWDAF instance(s) for the requested UE(s). Then the
NWDAF supporting analytics aggregation capability derives a UE ID list based
on the request from the NF in step 1 and the requested aggregated analytics
based on the data collected in the AOI in step 2 and UE mobility analytics in
one or more of the visited AOI(s) obtained from the other NWDAF instance(s).
UE visited locations in visited AOI(s) and AOI will be included in the
aggregated UE mobility analytics.
NOTE 2: If the visited AOI(s) and AOI are covered by different NWDAFs, then
consumer in the AOI firstly discovers a NWDAF supporting analytics aggregation
capability in the AOI from the NRF, as defined in clause 6.3.13 of TS 23.501
[2].
4\. The NWDAF provides requested UE mobility analytics to the NF, using either
the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify, depending on the service used in step 1.
The details for UE mobility analytics provided by NWDAF are defined in clause
6.7.2.3.
If in step 1 the NF wants to obtain the aggregated mobility analytics of those
UEs, that currently reside in the AOI and had visited at least one of visited
AOI(s) during an Analytics target period, the NWDAF will provide the requested
aggregated analytics for the UE(s) matching this criteria, i.e. the derived
mobility analytics can cover a subset of UEs compared to the Target of
Analytics Reporting as provided in step 1.
5-6. If at step 1, the NF has subscribed to receive notifications for UE
mobility analytics, after receiving event notification from the AMFs, AFs and
OAM subscribed by NWDAF in step 2, the NWDAF may generate new analytics and
provide them to the NF.
### 6.7.3 UE Communication Analytics
#### 6.7.3.1 General
In order to support some optimized operations, e.g. customized mobility
management, traffic routing handling, RFSP Index Management, QoS improvement
or Inactivity Timer optimization, in 5GS, an NWDAF may perform data analytics
on UE communication pattern and user plane traffic and provide the analytics
results (i.e. UE communication statistics or prediction) to NFs in the 5GC.
An NWDAF supporting UE Communication Analytics collects per-application
communication description from AFs. If consumer NF provides an Application ID,
the NWDAF only considers the data from AF, SMF and UPF that corresponds to
this application ID. NWDAF may also collect data from AMF.
The consumer of these analytics may indicate in the request:
\- Analytics ID = \"UE Communication\".
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: a single UE (SUPI) or a group of UEs (an
Internal Group ID).
\- Analytics Filter Information optionally including:
\- S-NSSAI;
\- DNN;
\- Application ID;
\- Area of Interest.
\- an optional list of analytics subsets that are requested (see clause
6.7.3.3);
\- An Analytics target period indicates the time period over which the
statistics or predictions are requested.
\- Preferred level of accuracy of the analytics.
\- Optional Preferred level of accuracy per analytics subset (see clause
6.7.3.3);
\- Optional preferred order of results for the list of UE Communications:
\- ordering criterion: \"start time\" or \"duration\",
\- order: ascending or descending;
\- Optionally, maximum number of objects;
\- In a subscription, the Notification Correlation Id and the Notification
Target Address are included.
#### 6.7.3.2 Input Data
The NWDAF supporting data analytics on UE communication shall be able to
collect communication information for the UE from 5GC. The detailed
information collected by the NWDAF includes service data related to UE
communication as defined in the Table 6.7.3.2-1.

NOTE 1: How NWDAF collects UE communication related data from UPF is not
defined in this Release of the specification.
NOTE 2: SMF collects N4 Session Level data from UPF independently of NWDAF
input data requests to SMF.
Depending on the requested level of accuracy, data collection may be provided
on samples (e.g. spatial subsets of UEs or UE group, temporal subsets of UE
communication information).
The application Id is optional. If the application Id is omitted, the
collected UE communication information can be applicable to all the
applications for the UE.
#### 6.7.3.3 Output Analytics
The NWDAF supporting UE Communication Analytics provides the analytics results
to consumer NFs. The analytics results provided by the NWDAF include the UE
communication statistics as defined in Table 6.7.3.3-1 or predictions as

NOTE: When Target of Analytics Reporting is an individual UE, one UE ID (i.e.
SUPI) will be included, the NWDAF will provide the analytics communication
result (i.e. list of (predicted) communication time slots) to NF service
consumer(s) for the UE.
The results for UE groups address the group globally. The ratio is the
proportion of UEs in the group for a given communication at a given time and
duration.
The number of UE communication entries (1..max) is limited by the maximum
number of objects provided as part of Analytics Reporting Information. The
communications shall be provided by order of time, possibly overlapping.
Depending on the list size limitation, the least probable communications on a
given Analytics target period may not be provided.
#### 6.7.3.4 Procedures
The NWDAF can provide UE communication related analytics, in the form of
statistics or predictions or both, to a 5GC NF.
Figure 6.7.3.4-1: Procedure for UE communication analytics
1\. 5GC NF to NWDAF: Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe (Analytics ID = UE
communication, Target of Analytics Reporting=SUPI, Analytics Filter
Information = (Application ID, Area of Interest, etc.)).
5GC NF sends a request to the NWDAF for analytics on a specific UE(s), using
either Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service.
The analytics type indicated by \"Analytics ID\" is set to \"UE
communication\". The Target of Analytics Reporting is set to SUPI or an
Internal Group Identifier and Analytics Filter may include Application ID and
Area of Interest.
2a-b. NWDAF to AF (Optional): Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe (Event ID, external
UE ID, Application ID, Area of Interest).
In order to provide the requested analytics, the NWDAF may subscribe per
application communication information, which is identified by Application ID,
from AFs for the UE. The Event ID \"UE Communication information\" as defined
in TS 23.502 [3] is used, which indicates communication report for the UE
which is requested by the 5GC NF in the step 1. The external UE ID is obtained
by the NWDAF based on UE internal ID, i.e. SUPI. In the case of external AF,
the NEF translates the requested Area of Interest into a list of geographic
zone identifier(s) as described in clause 5.6.7.1 of TS 23.501 [2].
This step is skipped if the NWDAF already has the requested analytics
available or has subscribed to the AF.
2c. NWDAF to SMF: Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe (Event ID, SUPI, Application
ID).
In order to provide the requested analytics, the NWDAF subscribes to
information of the UE and may subscribe to N4 Session related input data from
SMFs as defined in Table 6.7.3.2-1.
2d-e. N4 related input data is provided by UPF to SMF.
NOTE: The NWDAF request does not trigger any N4 session
Establishment/Modification procedure. N4 session related input is only
retrieved if UPF has already been triggered to send reports. UPF sends N4
session level reports, including PDU session Inactivity to SMF, according to
clause 4.4.2.2 of TS 23.502 [3].
2f. SMF provides the requested input data to NWDAF.
2g-h. NWDAF to AMF: Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe (Event ID, SUPI, Area of
Interest).
In order to provide the requested analytics, the NWDAF retrieves one or more
of Type Allocation code, UE connection management state, UE access behaviour
trends and UE location trends from AMF.
NOTE: The NWDAF determines the SMF serving the UE as described in clause
6.2.2.1.
3\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics, in the form of UE communication
statistics or predictions or both.
4\. NWDAF to 5GC NF: Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify.
The NWDAF provides requested UE communication analytics to the NF, using
either Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify, depending on the service used in step 1.
5-7. If the NF subscribed UE communication analytics at step 1, when the NWDAF
generates new analytics, it notifies the new generated analytics to the 5GC
NF.
### 6.7.4 Expected UE behavioural parameters related network data analytics
#### 6.7.4.1 General
The clause 6.7.4 defines how a service consumer learns from the NWDAF the
expected UE behaviour parameters as defined in clause 4.15.6.3 of TS 23.502
[3] for a group of UEs or a specific UE.
The service consumer may be an NF (e.g. AMF, AF), or the OAM.
The consumer of these analytics shall indicate in the request:
\- Analytics ID = \"UE Mobility\" or \"UE Communication\".
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: a single UE (SUPI) or a group of UEs (an
Internal Group ID).
NOTE: In the case of untrusted AF the Target of Analytics Reporting can be a
GPSI or an External Group Identifier that is mapped in the 5GC to a SUPI or an
Internal Group Identifier
\- An Analytics target period, which indicates the time period over which the
statistics or predictions are requested.
\- Analytics Filter Information optionally including:
\- Area of Interest (AOI);
\- S-NSSAI;
\- DNN;
\- Application ID;
\- an optional list of analytics subsets that are requested (see clause
6.7.3.3).
\- Optional maximum number of objects.
\- In a subscription, the Notification Correlation Id and the Notification
Target Address are included.
The NWDAF shall notify the result of the analytics to the consumer as
indicated in clause 6.7.4.3.
#### 6.7.4.2 Input Data
In order to produce \"UE Mobility\" analytics, the NWDAF collects UE mobility
information, UE location trends and/or UE access behaviour trends, as defined
in clause 6.7.2.2.
In order to produce \"UE Communication\" analytics, the NWDAF collects UE
communication information, UE communication trends, UE session behaviour
trends and/or UE access behaviour trends, as defined in clause 6.7.3.2.
#### 6.7.4.3 Output Analytics
The analytics results for \"UE Mobility\" are specified in Table 6.7.2.3-1 and
Table 6.7.2.3-2.
The analytics results for \"UE Communication\" are specified in Table
6.7.3.3-1 and Table 6.7.3.3-2.
#### 6.7.4.4 Procedures
##### 6.7.4.4.1 NWDAF-assisted expected UE behavioural analytics
Figure 6.7.4.4.1-1: NWDAF assisted expected UE behavioural analytics procedure
1\. 5GC NF (e.g. AMF, SMF and AF) to NWDAF: Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request
(Analytics ID, Target of Analytics Reporting, Analytics Filter Information) or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe (Analytics ID, Target of Analytics
Reporting, Analytics Filter Information).
The Analytics ID is set to \"UE Mobility\" or to \"UE Communication\",\" and
the consumer request analytics.
2\. If Analytics ID is set to \"UE Mobility\", the NWDAF collects data from
OAM, AMF and/or AF as specified in clause 6.7.2.4 step 2, unless the
information is already available.
If Analytics ID is set to \"UE Communication\", the NWDAF collects data from
AMF, SMF and/or AF as specified in clause 6.7.3.4 step 2, unless the
information is already available.
3\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics.
4\. NWDAF to 5GC NF: Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify.
The NWDAF provides requested Expected UE behaviour to the NF, using either
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify,
depending on the service used in step 1.
5-6. If the NF subscribed to at step 1, when the NWDAF generates new
analytics, it provides the new generated analytics to the NF.
### 6.7.5 Abnormal behaviour related network data analytics
#### 6.7.5.1 General
This clause defines how to identify a group of UEs or a specific UE with
abnormal behaviour, e.g. being misused or hijacked, with the help of NWDAF.
NOTE 1: The misused or hijacked UEs are UEs in which there are malicious
applications running or UEs which have been stolen.
The consumer of this analytics could be a 5GC NF. The 5GC NF subscribes
analytics on abnormal behaviour from a NWDAF based on the UE subscription,
network configuration or application layer request.
The NWDAF performs data analytics on abnormal behaviour if there is a related
subscription and returns exception reports that result from the analysis of
the correlations between behavioural variables. The exception reports contain
an Exception Level expressed in the form of a scalar value, possibly
supplemented by additional measurements.
The consumer of this analytics shall indicate in the request:
\- Analytics ID = \"Abnormal behaviour\";
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: a single UE, any UE or an Internal Group
Identifier;
\- An Analytics target period indicates the time period over which the
statistics or predictions are requested;
\- Analytics Filter Information optionally including:
\- expected UE behaviour parameters;
\- expected analytics type or list of Exception IDs with associated thresholds
for the Exception Level, where the expected analytics type can be mobility
related, communication related or both;
\- Area of interest;
\- Application ID;
\- DNN;
\- S-NSSAI.
NOTE 2: The expected analytics type generally indicates whether mobility or
communication related abnormal behaviour analytics or both are expected by the
consumer and the list of exception IDs indicates what specific analytics are
expected by the consumer. Either the expected analytics type or the list of
Exception IDs needs to be indicated, but they are not presented
simultaneously. When the expected analytics type is indicated, the NWDAF
performs corresponding abnormal behaviour analytics which are supported by the
NWDAF. The relation between the expected analytics type and Exception IDs is
defined in Table 6.7.5.1-1.
\- Optionally, maximum number of objects and maximum number of SUPIs;
\- In a subscription, the Notification Correlation Id and the Notification
Target Address are included.
Table 6.7.5.1-1: Relation between expected analytics type and Exception IDs
* * *
Expected analytics type Exception IDs matching the expected analytics type
mobility related Unexpected UE location, Ping-ponging across neighbouring
cells, Unexpected wakeup, Unexpected radio link failures. communication
related Unexpected long-live/large rate flows, Unexpected wakeup, Suspicion of
DDoS attack, Wrong destination address, Too frequent Service Access.
* * *
If the Target of Analytics Reporting is any UE, then the Analytics Filter
should at least include:
\- Area of Interest or S-NSSAI, if the expected analytics type or the list of
Exception IDs is mobility related.
\- Area of Interest, application ID, DNN or S-NSSAI, if the expected analytics
type or the list of Exception IDs is communication related.
If the Target of Analytics Reporting is any UE, the consumer of this analytics
shall request either mobility related only or communication related only
abnormal behaviour analytics, but not both at the same time.
The expected UE behaviour parameters that the consumer can indicate in the
request when known depend on the Exception ID that the consumer expects. They
may encompass UE behaviour parameters as defined in clause 4.15.6.3 of TS
23.502 [3] and other parameters. Table 6.7.5.1-2 shows the mapping between
each Exception ID and UE behaviour parameters.
Table 6.7.5.1-2: Description of Expected UE Behaviour parameters per Exception
ID
+----------------------------------------+------------------------------------+ | Exception ID | UE behaviour parameters to provide | +----------------------------------------+------------------------------------+ | Unexpected UE location | Expected UE Moving Trajectory | | | | | | Stationary Indication | +----------------------------------------+------------------------------------+ | Unexpected long-live/large rate flows | Periodic Time | | | | | | Scheduled Communication Time | | | | | | Communication Duration Time | +----------------------------------------+------------------------------------+ | Unexpected wakeup | Periodic Time | | | | | | Communication Duration Time | | | | | | Scheduled Communication Time | +----------------------------------------+------------------------------------+ | Suspicion of DDoS attack | Periodic Time | | | | | | Communication Duration Time | | | | | | Scheduled Communication Time | | | | | | Scheduled Communication Type | | | | | | Traffic Profile | | | | | | Expected transaction Dispersion | +----------------------------------------+------------------------------------+ | Too frequent Service Access | Periodic Time | +----------------------------------------+------------------------------------+ | Unexpected radio link failures | Expected UE Moving Trajectory | +----------------------------------------+------------------------------------+ | Ping-ponging across neighbouring cells | Expected UE Moving Trajectory | | | | | | Stationary Indication | +----------------------------------------+------------------------------------+
When the NWDAF detects those UEs that deviate from the expected UE behaviour,
e.g. unexpected UE location, abnormal traffic pattern, unexpected transaction
dispersion amount, wrong destination address, etc. the NWDAF shall notify the
result of the analytics to the consumer as specified in clause 6.7.5.3.
#### 6.7.5.2 Input Data
The Exceptions information from AF is as specified in Table 6.7.5.2-1.
On request of the service consumer, the NWDAF shall collect and analyse UE
behavioural information from the 5GC NFs (SMF, AMF, AF), or OAM as specified
in clauses 6.7.2.2 and 6.7.3.2 and/or expected UE behavioural parameters from
UDM as defined in clause 4.15.6.3, TS 23.502 [3], depending on Exception IDs.
NOTE: Care needs to be taken with regards to load by avoiding to cause major
extra signalling when collecting data for any UE.
Table 6.7.5.2-1: Exceptions information from AF
* * *
Information Description IP address 5-tuple To identify a data flow of a UE via
the AF (such as the Firewall or a Threat Intelligence Sharing platform)
Exceptions (1..max) (NOTE 1)  
>Exception ID Indicating the Exception ID (such as Unexpected long-live/large
rate flows and Suspicion of DDoS attack as defined in Table 6.7.5.3-2) of the
data flow. >Exception Level Scalar value indicating the severity of the
abnormal behaviour. >Exception trend Measured trend (up/down/unknown/stable)
NOTE 1: The Exceptions information and the UE behavioural information as
defined in clauses 6.7.2.2 and 6.7.3.2 could help NWDAF to train an Abnormal
classifier, which could be used to classify a UE behaviour data into Normal
behaviour or Exception.
* * *
#### 6.7.5.3 Output Analytics
Corresponding to the \"abnormal behaviour\" Analytics ID, the analytics result
provided by the NWDAF is defined in Table 6.7.5.3-1 and Table 6.7.5.3-2. When
the level of an exception trespasses above or below the threshold, the NWDAF
shall notify the consumer with the exception ID associated with the exception
if the exception ID is within the list of exception IDs indicated by the
consumer or matches the expected analytics type indicated by the consumer. The
NWDAF shall provide the Exception Level and determine which of the other
information elements to provide, depending on the observed exception.
Abnormal behaviour statistics information is defined in Table 6.7.5.3-1.
Table 6.7.5.3-1: Abnormal behaviour statistics
* * *
Information Description Exceptions (1..max) List of observed exceptions >
Exception ID The risk detected by NWDAF > Exception Level Scalar value

Target of Analytics Reporting > Amount Estimated number of UEs affected by the
Exception (applicable when the Target of Analytics Reporting = \"any UE\") >
Additional measurement Specific information for each risk (see Table
6.7.5.3-3)
* * *
Abnormal behaviour predictions information is defined in Table 6.7.5.3-2.
Table 6.7.5.3-2: Abnormal behaviour predictions

Exception (applicable when the Target of Analytics Reporting = \"any UE\") >
Additional measurement Specific information for each risk (see Table
6.7.5.3-3) > Confidence Confidence of this prediction
* * *
The predictions are provided with a Validity Period, as defined in clause
6.1.3.
The UE characteristics may provide a set of features common to all UEs
affected with the exception.
The number of exceptions and the length of the SUPI list shall respectively be
lower than the parameters maximum number of objects and Maximum number of
SUPIs provided as part of Analytics Reporting Information.
If PCF subscribes to notifications on \"Abnormal behaviour\", the NWDAF shall
send the PCF notifications about the risk, which may trigger the PCF to update
the AM/SM policies.
The NWDAF also sends the notification directly to the AMF or SMF, if the AMF
or SMF subscribes to the notification, so that the AMF or SMF may, based on
operator local policies defined on a per S-NSSAI basis (for AMF) or on a per
S-NSSAI, per DNN, or per (DNN,S-NSSAI) basis (for SMF), take actions for risk
solving.
If the AF subscribes to notifications on \"Abnormal behaviour\", the NWDAF
sends the notifications to the AF so that the AF may take actions for risk
solving.
The following Table 6.7.5.3-3 gives examples of additional measurement
provided by the NWDAF and examples of NF actions for solving each risk.
Table 6.7.5.3-3: Examples of additional measurements and NF actions for risk

#### 6.7.5.4 Procedure
Figure 6.7.5.4-1: Procedure for NWDAF assisted misused or hijacked UEs
identification
1a. A consumer NF subscribes to/requests NWDAF using
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe/ Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request
(Analytics ID = Abnormal behaviour, Target of Analytics Reporting = Internal-
Group-Identifier, any UE or SUPI, Analytics Filter Information).
A consumer NF may subscribe to/request abnormal behaviour
notification/response from NWDAF for a group of UEs, any UE or a specific UE.
The Analytics ID indicates the NWDAF to identify misused or hijacked UEs
through abnormal behaviour analytic.
1b. AF to NWDAF: Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request (Analytics ID, Target of Analytics Reporting =
External-group identifier, any UE or External UE ID, Analytics Filter
Information).
For untrusted AFs, the AF sends the subscription via a NEF, where the AF
invokes NEF service Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Subscribe or
Nnef_AnalyticsExposure_Fetch (Analytics ID, Target of Analytics Reporting =
External-group-identifier, any UE or External UE ID, Analytics Filter
Information).
An AF may also subscribe to/request abnormal behaviour notification/response
from NWDAF for a group of UEs, a specific UE or any UE, where the
subscription/request message may contain expected UE behaviour parameters
identified on the application layer. If an External-Group-Identifier is
provided by the AF, the NEF interrogates UDM to map the External-Group-
Identifier to the Internal-Group-Identifier and obtain SUPI list corresponding
to the Internal-Group-Identifier.
2\. [Conditional] NWDAF to AMF: Namf_EventExposure_Subscribe (Event ID(s),
Event Filter(s), Internal-Group-Identifier, any UE or SUPI).
The NWDAF sends subscription requests to the related AMF to collect UE
behavioural information if it has not subscribed such data.
NOTE 1: The NWDAF determines the related AMF(s) as described in clause
6.2.2.1.
The AMF sends event reports to the NWDAF based on the report requirements
contained in the subscription request received from the NWDAF.
If requested by NWDAF via Event Filter(s), the AMF checks whether the UE\'s
behaviour matches its expected UE behavioural information. In this case, the
AMF sends event reports to the NWDAF only when it detects that the UE\'s
behaviour deviated from its expected UE behaviour.
Depending on the Exception ID, the NWDAF may in addition perform data
collection from OAM as specified in clause 6.2.3.2.
3\. [Conditional] NWDAF to SMF: Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe (Event ID(s),
Event Filter(s), Internal-Group-Identifier, any UE or SUPI).
The NWDAF sends subscription requests to the related SMF(s) if it has not
subscribed to such data.
NOTE 2: Besides Analytics Filter Information, other mechanisms such as setting
maximum number of SUPIs and/ or using sampling ratio as part of Analytics
Reporting Parameters as per Event Reporting Information (clause 4.15.1 of TS
23.502 [3]) can be used by the analytics consumer to limit signalling load,
e.g. when the Target of Analytics Reporting is \"any UE\". The NWDAF can also
use sampling ratio, possibly with partition criteria, when subscribing towards
AMF and SMF.
NOTE 3: The NWDAF determines the related SMF(s) as described in clause
6.2.2.1.
The SMF sends event reports to the NWDAF based on the report requirements
contained in the subscription request received from the NWDAF.
If requested by NWDAF via Event Filter(s), the SMF checks whether the UE\'s
behaviour matches its expected UE behavioural information. In this case, the
SMF sends event reports to the NWDAF only when it detects that the UE\'s
behaviour deviated from its expected UE behaviour.
4\. The NWDAF performs data analytics for misused or hijacked UEs
identification. Based on the analytics and operator\'s policies the NWDAF
determines whether to send a notification to the consumer NF or AF.
5a. [Conditional] NWDAF to consumer NF (AMF or PCF or SMF depending on the
subscription): Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response (Analytics ID, Exception ID, Internal-
Group-Identifier or SUPI, Exception level) (which is used depending on the
service used in step 1a).
If the NWDAF determines to send a notification/response to the consumer 5GC
NFs, the NWDAF invokes Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response service operations. Based on the
notification/response, the 5G NFs adopt configured actions to
resolve/mitigate/avoid the risks as described in the Table 6.7.5.3-1.
5b. [Conditional] NWDAF to AF: Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response (Analytics ID, Exception ID, External UE
ID, Exception level) (which is used depending on the service used in step 1b).
If the NWDAF determines to send a notification/response to the consumer AF,
the NWDAF needs to include external UE ID of the identified UE into the
notification/response message.
NOTE 3: Based on the notification, the AF can adopt corresponding actions,
e.g. adjusting recommended TCP Window Size, adjusting recommended Service
Start and End.
NOTE 4: The call flow only shows a subscribe-notify model for the interaction
of NWDAF and consumer NF for simplicity instead of both request-response model
and subscription-notification model.
## 6.8 User Data Congestion Analytics
### 6.8.1 General
The NWDAF can provide user data congestion related analytics, by one-time
reporting or continuous reporting, in the form of statistics or predictions or
both, to another NF. User Data Congestion related analytics can relate to
congestion experienced while transferring user data over the control plane or
user plane or both. A request for user data congestion analytics relates to a
specific area or to a specific user. If the consumer of these analytics
provides a UE ID, the NWDAF determines the area where the UE is located. The
NWDAF then collects measurements per cell and uses the measurements to
determine user data congestion analytics.
The request for user data congestion related analytics indicates the location
area information where congestion related analytics is desired or indicates a
UE Identity that can be used by the NWDAF to determine the location area
information where congestion related analytics is desired. When requesting
user data congestion, the consumer may request the identifiers of the
applications that contribute the most to the traffic in the area. The consumer
may indicate how many applications should be reported by providing the maximum
number of applications in the request or subscription.
When the consumer of user data congestion related analytics subscribes to user
data congestion related analytics, it may indicate a threshold and the NWDAF
will provide analytics to the consumer when the congestion level crosses the
threshold. The consumer can indicate an S-NSSAI in the request when congestion
analytics are needed on a per slice level.
The service consumer may be an NF (e.g. NEF, AF, PCF).
The consumer of these analytics may indicate in the request or subscription
the following parameters, its content is described in the clause 6.1.3:
\- Analytics ID = \"User Data Congestion\".
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: either a single UE (SUPI), or \"any UE\".
NOTE: The Target of Analytics Reporting set to \"any UE\" applies when user
data congestion analytics relates to a specific Area of Interest.
\- Analytics Filter Information:
\- Area of Interest (i.e. list of TAIs or Cell IDs) which restricts the area
in focus (mandatory if Target of Analytics Reporting is set to \"any UE\",
optional otherwise);
\- an optional list of analytics subsets that are requested, (see clause
6.8.3);
\- Optional S-NSSAI, in order to obtain congestion analytics only on a given
slice.
\- Optional Reporting Threshold, which applies only for subscriptions and
indicates conditions on the congestion level (Network Status Indication, see
clause 6.8.3) to be reached in order to be notified by the NWDAF.
\- Preferred level of accuracy of the analytics;
\- Preferred order of results for the list of User Data Congestion statistics
or predictions:
\- ordering by Applicable Time Window, chronological or reverse chronological
order; or
\- ordering by Network Status Indication, ascending or descending;
\- Optional maximum number of objects;
\- An Analytics target period indicates the time period over which the
statistics or prediction are requested, either in the past or in the future.
\- In a subscription, the Notification Correlation Id and the Notification
Target Address are included.
The NWDAF notifies the result of the analytics to the consumer as indicated in
clause 6.8.3.
### 6.8.2 Input data
The detailed information collected by the NWDAF is defined in Table 6.8.2-1.
NOTE 1: Performance Measurements defined in TS 28.552 [8] represent resource
utilisation but do not, by themselves, indicate the event of congestion or
congestion levels. The NWDAF collects measurements from the OAM and how the
NWDAF derives Network Status Indication (NSI) is not specified.
Table 6.8.2-1: Data Collected from the NF and OAM related to User Data
Congestion Analytics
Information Source Description
* * *
UE Location AMF UE location information that NWDAF can use to derive the Area
of Interest. Measurements OAM Performance Measurements that will be used by
the NWDAF to determine congestion levels. Performance Measurements are related
to information transfer over the user plane and/or the control plane (e.g. UE
Throughput, DRB Setup Management, RRC Connection Number, PDU Session
Management and Radio Resource Utilization as defined in TS 28.552 [8]). The
NWDAF may obtain measurements by invoking management services that are defined
in TS 28.532 [6] and TS 28.550 [7].

NOTE 2: Care needs to be taken with regards to load and major signalling
caused when requesting \"any UE\". This can be achieved via utilization of
event filters (e.g. Area of Interest), Analytics Reporting Information (e.g.
maximum number of objects), or preferred sampling ratio provided by NWDAF to
the UPF and/or local UPF configuration of data collection for specific
application IDs, Packet Filter Sets and/or PFDs.
Additionally, NWDAF may use statistics or predictions on service experience as
specified in clause 6.4.3 as an input, e.g. for service experience in a given
area or service experience for some specific applications such as high
bandwidth applications.
### 6.8.3 Output analytics
The NWDAF outputs the user data congestion analytics for transfer over the
user plane, for transfer over the control plane, or for both. The output may
consist of statistics, predictions, or both. The detailed information provided
by the NWDAF is defined in Table 6.8.3-1 for statistics and in Table 6.8.3-2
for predictions.

The following list shows the applicability of the analytics subsets per
consumer:
\- Analytics subset \"List of top applications in UL (0..NU)\" and \"List of
top applications in DL (0..ND)\" are applicable to any consumer (e.g. PCF, AF,
NEF), The NWDAF decides if these Analytics subset is provided to an AF.
### 6.8.4 Procedures
#### 6.8.4.1 Procedure for one-time or continuous reporting of analytics for
user data congestion in a geographic area
The procedure as depicted in Figure 6.8.4.1-1 is used by an NF to retrieve
congestion analytics for a specific geographic area. The procedure can be used
to request a one-time or continuous reporting of congestion analytics.
Figure 6.8.4.1-1: Procedure for one-time or continuous reporting of analytics
for congestion in a geographic area
For one-time reporting:
1\. The NF sends Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request to NWDAF, indicating request for
analytics for congestion in a specific location. The NF can request statistics
or predictions or both. The Analytics ID is set to \"User Data Congestion\"
for transfer over user plane, control plane, or both, the Target of Analytics
Reporting is set to \"any UE\" and Analytics Filter Information set to include
a location (e.g. ECGI, TA) and an indication to provide the list of
applications that contribute the most to the traffic.
2-3. If the request is authorized and in order to provide the requested
analytics, the NWDAF may request the measurement information for the requested
location from OAM services following the data collection from OAM procedure as
captured in 6.2.3.2. If the NWDAF already has information about the requested
location, these steps are omitted. The NWDAF may obtain measurements by
invoking management services that are defined in TS 28.532 [6] and TS 28.550
[7].
If the request is to provide the list of applications that contribute the most
to the traffic, then the NWDAF collects input data from the AF for the
applications being served by AF(s) by invoking Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe
service or Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe (if via NEF) or collected from the UPF
or collected from both, AF and UPF.
4\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics.
5\. The NWDAF provides the analytics for congestion to the NF.
For continuous reporting:
6\. The NF sends Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe Request to the NWDAF,
indicating request for analytics for congestion in a specific location (e.g.
ECGI, TA), possibly with thresholds and including an indication to provide the
list of applications that contribute the most to the traffic. The NF can
request statistics or predictions or both. The type of analytics is set to
user data congestion analytics for transfer over user plane, control plane, or
both.
7-8. The NWDAF subscribes to OAM services following the data collection from
OAM procedure as captured in 6.2.3.2 to get measurement information for the
requested location, possibly providing measurement thresholds for example,
data congestion crossing values. The NWDAF may obtain measurements by invoking
management services that are defined in TS 28.532 [6] and TS 28.550 [7]. If a
request is to provide the list of applications that contribute the most to the
traffic, the NWDAF subscribes to the service data from AF by invoking
Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe service or Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe (if via
NEF) or from the UPF or from both.
9\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics.
10\. The NWDAF provides the analytics for congestion to the NF.
11a. A change of user data congestion status corresponding to crossing a
threshold set by the NWDAF at steps 7-8 is detected by OAM and notified to
NWDAF.
11b. The AF notifies the NWDAF with the input data as defined in table
6.8.2-2.
11c. The UPF provides the NWDAF with the input data as defined in table
6.8.2-2.
12\. The NWDAF derives new analytics.
13\. The NWDAF provides a notification for analytics for the user data
congestion to the NF.
#### 6.8.4.2 Procedure for one-time or continuous reporting of analytics for
user data congestion for a specific UE
The procedure as depicted in Figure 6.8.4.2-1 is used by an NF to retrieve
user data congestion analytics for a specific UE. The procedure can be used to
request a one-time or continuous reporting of user data congestion analytics.
Figure 6.8.4.2-1: Procedure for one-time or continuous reporting of analytics
for congestion for a specific UE
For one-time reporting:
1\. The NF sends Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request to NWDAF, requesting for
analytics for user data congestion for a specific UE id. The NF can request
statistics or predictions or both. The type of analytics is set to user data
congestion analytics for transfer over user plane, control plane, or both, the
Target of Analytics Reporting is set to UE id.
2-5. The NWDAF may already know the UE location. If not, the NWDAF checks the
UE location by first retrieving the AMF serving the UE (steps 2-3) and then by
interrogating the AMF about the UE location.
NOTE 1: The NF sends a request for a UE that is registered, so that NWDAF can
retrieve the UE location.
6-7. The NWDAF requests measurement information for the UE location from OAM
services (as captured in 6.2.3.2). These steps are omitted if the NWDAF
already has the information. The NWDAF may obtain measurements by invoking
management services that are defined in TS 28.532 [6] and TS 28.550 [7].
If the request is to provide the list of applications that contribute the most
to the traffic, then the NWDAF collects the input data from the UPF serving
the UE location, or from the AF(s) by invoking Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe
service or Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe (if via NEF) or collects input data
from both, AF and UPF. The input data is defined in Table 6.8.2-2.
8\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics.
9\. The NWDAF provides the analytics for congestion to the NF.
For continuous reporting:
10\. The NF sends Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe Request to the NWDAF.
The NF can request for statistics or for predictions or for both. The type of
analytics is set to user data congestion analytics for transfer over user
plane, control plane, or both.
11\. The NWDAF determines the UE location, either via internal information or
by applying the same steps as steps 2 to 5. The NWDAF then determines an area
of interest.
12-13. The NWDAF subscribes to OAM services (as captured in 6.2.3.2) to get
the measurement information for the UE location, possibly providing
measurement thresholds. The NWDAF may obtain measurements by invoking
management services that are defined in TS 28.532 [6] and TS 28.550 [7].
If the request is to provide the list of applications that contribute the most
to the traffic, then the NWDAF collects input data from the UPF serving the UE
location or from the AF(s) by invoking Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe service or
Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe (if via NEF) or collects from both, AF and UPF.
The input data is defined in Table 6.8.2-2.
14\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics.
15\. The NWDAF provides the analytics for user data congestion status
information to the NF.
16-17. The NWDAF subscribes to UE mobility event notification in order to be
informed when the UE moves out of the area of interest (in order to define a
new area of interest and request new information to OAM if the UE moves to a
different area).
18a. A change of user data congestion status corresponding to crossing a
threshold set by the NWDAF is detected by OAM and notified to NWDAF.
18b. The AF notifies the NWDAF with the input data as defined in table
6.8.2-2.
18c. The UPF provides the NWDAF with the input data as defined in table
6.8.2-2.
NOTE 2: How NWDAF collects information from UPF is not defined in this Release
of the specification.
19\. The NWDAF derives new analytics.
20\. The NWDAF provides a notification for analytics for the user data
congestion status information to the NF.
## 6.9 QoS Sustainability Analytics
### 6.9.1 General
The consumer of QoS Sustainability analytics may request the NWDAF analytics
information regarding the QoS change statistics for an Analytics target period
in the past in a certain area or the likelihood of a QoS change for an
Analytics target period in the future in a certain area. The consumer can
request either to subscribe to notifications (i.e. a Subscribe-Notify model)
or to a single notification (i.e. a Request-Response model).
The service consumer may be a NF (e.g. AF).
The request includes the following parameters:
\- Analytics ID = \"QoS Sustainability\";
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: any UE;
\- Analytics Filter Information:
\- QoS requirements (mandatory):
\- 5QI (standardized or pre-configured) and applicable additional QoS
parameters and the corresponding values (conditional, i.e. it is needed for
GBR 5QIs to know the GFBR); or
\- the QoS Characteristics attributes including Resource Type, PDB, PER and
their values;
\- Location information (mandatory): an area or a path of interest. The
location information could reflect a list of waypoints;
NOTE: In this Release, the consumer of the \"QoS Sustainability\" Analytics ID
will provide location information in the area of interest format (TAIs or Cell
IDs) which is understandable by NWDAF.
\- S-NSSAI (optional);
\- Optional maximum number of objects;
\- Analytics target period: relative time interval, either in the past or in
the future, that indicates the time period for which the QoS Sustainability
analytics is requested;
\- Reporting Threshold(s), which apply only for subscriptions and indicate
conditions on the level to be reached for the reporting of the analytics, i.e.
to discretize the output analytics and to trigger the notification when the
threshold(s) provided in the analytics subscription are crossed by the
expected QoS KPIs.
\- A matching direction may be provided such as crossed (default value),
below, or above.
\- An acceptable deviation from the threshold level in the non-critical
direction (i.e. in which the QoS is improving) may be set to limit the amount
of signalling.
The level(s) relate to value(s) of the QoS KPIs defined in TS 28.554 [10], for
the relevant 5QI:
\- for a 5QI of GBR resource type, the Reporting Threshold(s) refer to the QoS
flow Retainability KPI;
\- for a 5QI of non-GBR resource type, the Reporting Threshold(s) refer to the
RAN UE Throughput KPI.
\- In a subscription, the Notification Correlation Id and the Notification
Target Address.
The NWDAF collects the corresponding statistics information on the QoS KPI for
the relevant 5QI of interests from the OAM, i.e. the QoS flow Retainability or
the RAN UE Throughput as defined in TS 28.554 [10].
If the Analytics target period refers to the past:
\- The NWDAF verifies whether the triggering conditions for the notification
of QoS change statistics are met and if so, generates for the consumer one or
more notifications.
\- The analytics feedback contains the information on the location and the
time for the QoS change statistics and the Reporting Threshold(s) that were
crossed.
If the Analytics target period is in the future:
\- The NWDAF detects the need for notification about a potential QoS change
based on comparing the expected values for the KPI of the target 5QI against
the Reporting Threshold(s) provided by the consumer in any cell in the
requested area for the requested Analytics target period. The expected KPI
values are derived from the statistics for the 5QI obtained from OAM. OAM
information may also include planned or unplanned outages detection and other
information that is not in scope for 3GPP to discuss in detail.
\- The analytics feedback contains the information on the location and the
time when a potential QoS change may occur and what Reporting Threshold(s) may
be crossed.

the OAM statistics defined by operator.
### 6.9.3 Output analytics
The NWDAF outputs the QoS Sustainability analytics. Depending on the Analytics
target period, the output consists of statistics or predictions. The detailed
information provided by the NWDAF is defined in Table 6.9.3-1 for statistics
and Table 6.9.3-2 for predictions.

NOTE 1: The meaning of Confidence is based on the SLA, i.e. the consumer has
to understand the meaning of the different values of Confidence.
NOTE 2: The Analytics can contain multiple sets of the above information if
the location information reflected a list of waypoints.
The number of QoS sustainability analytics entries is limited by the maximum
number of objects provided as part of Analytics Reporting Information.
### 6.9.4 Procedures
Figure 6.9.4-1 depicts a procedure for \"QoS Sustainability\" analytics
provided by NWDAF.
Figure 6.9.4-1: \"QoS Sustainability\" analytics provided by NWDAF
1\. The consumer requests or subscribes to analytics information on \"QoS
Sustainability\" provided by NWDAF. The parameters included in the request are
described in clause 6.9.1.
The consumer may include multiple sets of parameters in order to provide
different combinations of \"Location information\" and \"Analytics target
period\" when requesting QoS Sustainability analytics.
2\. The NWDAF collects the data specified in clause 6.9.2 from the OAM,
following the procedure captured in clause 6.2.3.2.
3\. The NWDAF verifies whether the triggering conditions are met and derives
the requested analytics. The NWDAF can detect the need for notification based
on comparing the requested analytics of the target 5QI against the Reporting
Threshold(s) provided by consumer in any cell over the requested Analytics
target period.
4\. The NWDAF provides response or notification on \"QoS Sustainability\" to
the consumer.
## 6.10 Dispersion Analytics
### 6.10.1 General
Dispersion analytics identifies the location (i.e. areas of interest, TAs,
cells) or network slice(s) where a UE, or a group of UEs, or any UE disperse
most (if not all) of their data volume and sessions transactions (i.e. MM and
SM messages).
The NWDAF shall be able to provide dispersion statistics or predictions and
shall be able to collect UE dispersion related information from NFs.
Dispersion is the percentage of activity that a UE, or group of UEs, or any
UE, generates at a location or a slice during a period of interest. This
enables the operator to rank hot locations or slices by the various activities
and to identify the top contributors (i.e. UEs) for that activity. When heavy
UEs at a particular location or slice are detected/predicted and reported to a
policy entity, their QoS attributes, or access to an area of interest or a
slice can then be limited.
\- Data volume dispersion - The percentage of data traffic volume that a UE,
or a group of UEs, or any UE, generated at a location or in a slice during the
period of interest.
\- Transactions dispersion - The percentage of MM and SM messages that a UE,
or a group of UEs, or any UE, generated at a location or in a slice during the
period of interest.
The operator may classify and assign one of the three mobility classes per
dispersion characteristics for a UE or a group of UEs, or any UE as fixed,
camper or traveller. In addition, the operator may classify a UE as a Top-
Heavy UE in case its dispersion percentile rating, at a location or a slice,
is higher than a threshold value defined by the operator (e.g. 0.9
percentile), see percentile ranking in the output tables, clause 6.10.3. The
classification is based on either Data volume dispersion or Transactions
dispersion.
\- Data-Classification - fixed, camper, traveller data-classification per
thresholds assigned by the operator.
EXAMPLE: When a UE disperses, during the period of observation, most
(threshold=95%) of its data at a location or a slice, the dispersion data-
classification of the UE at that location or slice is \"fixed\".
\- Transaction-Classification - fixed, camper, traveller transactions-
classifications per thresholds assigned by the operator.
EXAMPLE: When a UE disperses, during the period of observation,
(threshold=40%) of its session transactions at a location or a slice, the
dispersion transaction-classification of the UE is camper at that location or
slice.
Based on the dispersion analytics, the analytics consumer can determine that a
data volume or transactions hot spot is formed when the volume of data or
amount of transactions dispersed by most of the UEs at the area of interest or
slice exceeds a certain data or transaction threshold established through
trend analysis or operator policy.
The consumer of dispersion analytics may indicate in its request:
\- Analytics ID = \"Dispersion Analytics\";
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: a single UE (SUPI), or a group of UEs (an
Internal Group ID), or any UE. \"Any UE\" is only supported in combination
with Analytics Filter Information (S-NSSAI, Area(s) of Interest, Top-Heavy UEs
indication, Fixed indication, Camper indication or Traveller indication) and
Dispersion Analytics type \"Data Volume Dispersion Analytics\" and/or
\"Transaction Dispersion Analytics\";
\- Analytics Filter Information:
\- optional list of TA(s), Area(s) of Interest, Cells, or S-NSSAI(s),
Application ID(s), Top-Heavy UEs, Fixed UEs, Camper UEs, Dispersion Analytics
type (Data Volume Dispersion Analytics (DVDA) or Transactions Dispersion
Analytics (TDA) or both); and
\- optional list of analytics subsets that are requested (see clause 6.10.3);
\- Preferred level of accuracy of the analytics;
\- Preferred level of accuracy per analytics subset (see clause 6.10.3);
\- Preferred order of results for the list of UE Dispersion Analytics
information:
\- ordering criterion:
\- For DDA, one of the following: \"time slot start\", \"data dispersion\",
\"data classification\", \"data ranking\", or \"data percentile ranking\";
\- For TDA, one of the following: \"time slot start\", \"transaction
dispersion\", \"transaction classification\", \"transaction ranking\", or
\"transaction percentile ranking\"; and
\- order: ascending or descending;
\- Analytics target period indicating the time period over which the
statistics or predictions are requested;
\- Optionally, maximum number of objects and maximum number of SUPIs;
\- Optionally, preferred granularity of location information: TA level or cell
level; and
\- In a subscription, the Notification Correlation Id and the Notification
Target Address are included.
NOTE 1: If one or multiple ID(s) are included in the filter information, the
output analytics will be reported per Application ID, otherwise the output
analytics is aggregated information per AOI or slice independent of the
applications.
NOTE 2: Care needs to be taken with regards to load when requesting analytics
for \"Any UE\". This could be achieved by utilizing event filters (e.g. Area
of Interest for AMF) and possible analytics filters including Top-Heavy UEs
and/or Fixed and/or Camper UEs and/or Analytics Reporting Information (e.g.
SUPImax), or sampling ratio as part of Event Reporting Information. The load
of analytics for \"Any UE\" can be alleviated by limiting the number of
S-NSSAI in the analytics filter.
### 6.10.2 Input Data
The NWDAF shall be able to collect UE dispersion information from NF(s) and
AFs. The information collected by the NWDAF is network data from 5GC NFs and
service data from AFs:
\- Data related to UE transactions dispersion and bound by location collected
from AMF and SMF are defined in the tables 6.10.2-1 and 6.10.2-2. This may
include individual transactions or SMF/AMF state transition information stored
as UE behaviour trends, which provides aggregated transaction information.
Table 6.10.2-1: Location based UE transactions dispersion information
collected from serving AMF
* * *
Information Source Description UE ID AMF SUPI. Type Allocation Code AMF
Terminal model and vendor information of the UE. UE locations (1..max) AMF UE

requested, the amount of UE transactions exchanged at the location in the
notified time period. UE access behaviour trends AMF Metrics on UE state
transitions (e.g. access, RM and CM states, handover). UE location trends AMF
Metrics on UE locations. NOTE: UE location provides one location per instance
while UE location trend provides multiple locations at once. One or both of
them may be used.

* * *
Data volume can be collected from the AF per UE across all the UE applications
provided by a particular AF or per UE per application when application IDs are
requested.
Data related to UE data volume dispersion, bound by a location or slice,
collected from the AF and UPF are defined in tables 6.10.2-3 through 6.10.2-6.
If the Target of Analytics Reporting is set to an Internal Group ID and the AF
is located in the untrusted domain, NEF translates it into an External Group
ID.
NOTE 1: It is assumed that the AF is provisioned with the list of UE IDs
(GPSIs or SUPIs) belonging to an External or Internal Group ID.
\- In table 6.10.2-3, the data volume is collected per UE from the AF. The
collected UE information is applicable across all the applications used by the
UE during the period.
Table 6.10.2-3: UE Data volume dispersion information collected from the AF
* * *
Information Source Description UE ID AF Internal or External UE ID (i.e. SUPI
or GPSI, respectively). Timestamp AF Time stamp of the collected information.
> Data Volume UL/DL AF Sum of UE data volume exchanged at the AF during the
period of observation.
* * *
\- In table 6.10.2-4, the AF reports data volume per UE per application in
relation to the start and stop of the application as indicated by the
application duration.
Table 6.10.2-4: UE data volume dispersion collected from the AF
+-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | Information | Source | Description | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | UE IP address | AF | UE IP address. | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | IP 5-tuple | AF | IP address 5-tuple. | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | Timestamp | AF | Timestamp of the collected | | | | information. | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | Application ID | AF | Identifier of the | | | | application at the AF. | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+ | Location of Application | AF/NEF | Location of application | | | | represented by a list of | | | | DNAI(s).

Data volume can also be collected from the UPF per UE IP address across all
applications or per UE for specific application(s).
\- In table 6.10.2-5, the data volume is collected per UE from the UPF. The
collected UE information is applicable across all applications used by the UE
between start and stop of the PDU session. The UPF reports volume per UE IP
address across all applications.
Table 6.10.2-5: UE data volume dispersion collected from serving UPF
* * *
Information Source Description UE IP address UPF UE IP address. Timestamp UPF
Time stamp of the collected information. Data Volume UL/DL UPF Sum of UE data
volume exchanged per UE across all applications. NOTE: The Data volume can be
reported either as total volume of the PDU session or periodically. It refers
to the Data volume exchanged between the start and stop of the PDU session.
When reported periodically, the period can be specified in the requested
analytic target period or configured as a default value in the UPF.
* * *
\- In table 6.10.2-6, the UPF reports data volume per UE for specific
application(s) in relation to the start and stop of the application as
indicated by the application duration.
There are two modes of data collection:
\- Non periodical: A mode where the data volume is requested and consequently
provided for the total volume of a PDU session.
\- Periodical: A mode where data volume is provided periodically between the
start and stop of a PDU session. The period can be specified in the requested
analytic target period or configured as a default value in the UPF.
For both modes of data collection, if there are multiple application sessions
for the UE PDU session, the NWDAF aggregates (i.e. sums up) the data volume
across all applications to obtain per UE information.

When reported | | | | periodically, the period | | | | can be specified in the | | | | requested analytic target | | | | period or configured as a | | | | default value in the UPF. | | | +-----------------------------+--------+-----------------------------+
The task of the NWDAF is to calculate the volume of data and amount of
transactions dispersed by the UE at each visited location during a period of
interest. The entry time and exit time to a location is provided by the AMF.
Collecting volume per UE and per specific application is optional and such
information can be provided by the UPF or AF.
The Correlation Information as defined in table 6.2.4-1 is used to correlate
the input data from AMF and SMF, the input data from SMF and UPF and the input
data from UPF and AF.
\- Slice information related to UE transactions dispersion from NF(s) are
defined in tables 6.10.2-7 and 6.10.2-8. This may include individual
transactions or SMF/AMF state transition information stored as UE behaviour
trends, which provides aggregated transaction information.
\- The Slice data volume collection is the same as listed in tables 6.10.2-3
to 6.10.2-6.

state transitions (e.g. access, RM and CM states, handover). NOTE: When a UE
moves to a new AMF during Analytics target period, timestamps for assigned
slices of the UE are set to the date and time of the new AMF. The NWDAF shall
aggregate (sum up) the amount of slice transactions, for the requested
Analytics target period, across the AMFs traversed by the UE.

* * *
The task of the NWDAF is to calculate the volume of data and amount of
transactions dispersed by the UE at each slice during a period of interest. A
time stamp of a slice assignment is provided by the AMF.
The Correlation Information as defined in table 6.2.4-1 is used to correlate
the input data from AMF and SMF, the input data from SMF and UPF and the input
data from UPF and AF.
Data collection may be provided on samples (e.g. spatial subsets of UEs or UE
group, temporal subsets of UE location information).
NOTE 2: How the data from UPF is retrieved is not specified in this release.
NOTE 3: The list of monitored transactions (MM and SM messages) is a subset of
the messages listed in clauses 8.2 and 8.3 of TS 24.501 [23].
NOTE 4: The Namf_EventExposure and Nsmf_EventExposure services in clauses
5.2.2.3 and 5.2.8.3 of TS 23.502 [3] provide the required transactions
information.
### 6.10.3 Output Analytics
#### 6.10.3.0 General
The NWDAF provides UE dispersion analytics, which can be statistics and/or
prediction for data volume and/or transactions dispersions, to consumer NFs or
AFs.
#### 6.10.3.1 Data Volume Dispersion Analytics
The data volume dispersion analytics results provided by the NWDAF can be for
a UE or group of UEs or \"any UE\" data volume dispersion statistics as
defined in table 6.10.3.1-1 and/or UE data volume dispersion predictions as
defined in table 6.10.3.1-2. If the analytics covers multiple UEs, the Data
dispersed, Data ranking and Data percentile ranking parameters are calculated
as the aggregated (i.e. summed up) data volume. When the Target of Analytics
Reporting is set as \"any UE\" the data volume dispersion analytics results
provided by the NWDAF can be for all UEs data volume dispersion statistics at
a location and/or the slice and/or data volume dispersion predictions at a
location and/or the slice.

The data volume dispersion analytics results provided by the NWDAF can also be
for a UE or group of UEs or \"any UE\" data volume dispersion statistics at a
given slice as defined in Table 6.10.3.1-3 and/or data volume dispersion
predictions as defined in Table 6.10.3.1-4. If the analytics covers multiple

### 6.10.4 Dispersion Analytic Procedure
The NWDAF can provide Dispersion analytics, in the form of statistics or
predictions, to an NF or AF.
Figure 6.10.4-1: UE Dispersion Analytics provided to an NF or AF
1\. The NF sends a request or subscription to the NWDAF for dispersion
analytics on a specific UE, any UE, or a group of UEs, using either the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription service. The NF can
request statistics or predictions or both. The Analytics ID is set to \"UE
Dispersion Analytics\", the Dispersion Analytic (DA) type is set to \"Data
Volume Dispersion Analytics\" (DVDA) or \"Transactions Dispersion Analytics\"
(TDA) and Analytic Filter Information = (Area of Interest, slice, target
period, optional UE class: Top-Heavy, Fixed, or Camper UEs). The NF or AF
provides the UE ID or Internal Group ID in the Target of Analytics Reporting.
2\. If the request is authorized and in order to provide the requested
analytics, the NWDAF may subscribe to events with all the serving AMFs, SMFs
of the requested UE(s) for notification of location changes or a slice change
(a slice change can be an additional slice or a deletion), or to obtain UE
location trends, UE access behaviour trends and UE session behaviour trends.
This step may be skipped when, e.g. the NWDAF already has the requested
analytics available.
The NWDAF subscribes to application service data from AF(s) by invoking
Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe service or Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe (via NEF).
The NWDAF can collect data volume information from the UPF, as listed in
tables 6.10.2-5 and 6.10.2-6 and clause 6.2.2.1, however, how information is
collected from UPFs is not defined in this Release of the specification.
NOTE: The NWDAF determines the AMF serving the UE, any UE, or the group of UEs
as described in clause 6.2.2.1.
3\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics.
4\. The NWDAF provides requested or subscribed UE dispersion analytics to the
NF, using either the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request Response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify, depending on the service used in step 1.
The details for UE dispersion analytics provided by NWDAF are described in
clause 6.10.3. The provided analytics enables the consumer to predict changing
network conditions such as data volume change at a location or a slice,
excessive signalling conditions at a location or a slice, etc.
5-6. If at step 1, the NF has subscribed to receive notifications for UE
dispersion analytics, after receiving event notification from the AMFs (e.g.
location change) or SMFs (e.g. slice change add/delete) subscribed by NWDAF in
step 2, the NWDAF may generate new dispersion analytics.
7\. The NWDAF provides the newly generated dispersion analytics to the NF. The
details for UE dispersion analytics provided by NWDAF are described in clause
6.10.3.
## 6.11 WLAN performance analytics
### 6.11.1 General
The NWDAF provides WLAN performance analytics to a service consumer NF. The
analytics results are generated based on the data from other 5GC NFs and OAM.
The analytics results, provided in the form of statistics or predictions,
contain quality and performance of WLAN connection of UE according to UE
location and SSID. The consumer can request either one-time or continuous
reporting.
The service consumer may be an NF (e.g. PCF).
If a service consumer is PCF, the WLAN performance analytics can be used to
update WLANSP as defined in TS 23.503 [4].
The consumer of these analytics may indicate in the request or subscription:
\- Analytics ID = \"WLAN performance\";
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: a single UE (SUPI), a group of UEs (an
Internal Group ID), or any UE;
\- Analytics Filter Information:
\- Area of Interest (list of TA or Cells);
\- SSID(s);
\- BSSID(s); and
\- optional list of analytics subsets that are requested (see clause 6.11.3);
\- An Analytics target period indicates the time period over which the
statistics or prediction are requested, either in the past or in the future;
\- Optional maximum number of objects;
\- Preferred level of accuracy of the analytics;
\- Preferred level of accuracy per analytics subset (see clause 6.11.3);
\- Preferred order of results for the list of WLAN performance information:

### 6.11.4 Procedures
Figure 6.11.4-1: Procedure for WLAN performance analytics
1\. The consumer NF sends a request to the NWDAF for WLAN performance
analytics using either the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription service. The Analytics ID is set to \"WLAN
performance\", the Target of Analytics Reporting and the Analytics Filter
Information are set according to clause 6.11.1. The consumer NF can request
statistics or predictions.
The analytics can be requested with the filter information (e.g. Area of
Interest or specific SSID(s)). When Area of Interest is provided, the
analytics results include WLAN performance information of all SSID(s) located
in the Area of Interest. When specific SSID(s) is provided, the analytics
results include WLAN performance information of a specific UE or all UE(s)
connected to the corresponding SSID(s).
2-3. The NWDAF subscribes to information related to PDU Session for WLAN (i.e.
Access Type is Non-3GPP and RAT Type is TRUSTED_WLAN) from SMF.
4\. The NWDAF collects WLAN measurement data for the period of analysis from
the OAM, following the procedure captured in clause 6.2.3.2.
NOTE: The NWDAF collects the data from the UPF as listed in Table 6.11.2.1.
How the NWDAF collects the data is not defined in this Release of the
specification.
5\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics with the collected data. Analytics
output parameters are listed in clause 6.11.3.
6\. The NWDAF provides the requested analytics to the NF, using either the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription service, depending on the
service used at step 1.
7\. If the NF subscribed the analytics at step 1, the NWDAF provides a new
analytics when it generated the new output.
## 6.12 Session Management Congestion Control Experience Analytics
### 6.12.1 General
According to the Session Management Congestion Control (SMCC) mechanisms, i.e.
DNN based congestion control defined in clause 5.19.7.3 of TS 23.501 [2] and
S-NSSAI based congestion control defined in clause 5.19.7.4 of TS 23.501 [2],
the SMF that is applying or has applied the SMCC mechanism does not store any
historical information related to which UEs is/was subject to backoff timer
settings. Therefore, fairness to apply the SMCC cannot be considered nor
guaranteed. For example, among UEs that use a PDU Session associated with
S-NSSAI#1, some of them may have experienced the S-NSSAI based high level of
congestion control (e.g. receiving NAS SM reject messages with a long backoff
timer) while some of the UEs may have experienced the S-NSSAI based low level
congestion control (e.g. receiving NAS SM reject messages with a short backoff
timer), within a specific period. The backoff timer provided to each UE can
vary, e.g. up to 70 hours.
The SMF service consumer may request the NWDAF to provide Session Management
Congestion Control Experience (SMCCE) statistical analytics for a specific DNN
and/or S-NSSAI. The SMF uses potential congestion condition as a trigger to
request the SMCCE analytics from the NWDAF.
The request by the SMF includes mainly the following parameters:
\- Analytics ID = \"Session Management Congestion Control Experience\".
\- Target of Analytics Reporting: one or more SUPI(s).
NOTE 1: The UE(s) contained in the Target of Analytics Reporting. These are
UE(s) that have the PDU Session for the DNN and/or S-NSSAI indicated by
Analytics Filter Information.
\- Analytics Filter Information:
\- DNN and/or S-NSSAI; and
\- optional list of analytics subsets that are requested (see clause 6.12.3);
\- Analytics target period: the time window for which the statistics are
requested.
NOTE 2: Predictions are not provided as output for the Session Management
Congestion Control Experience analytics.
### 6.12.2 Input Data
For the purpose of SMCCE analytics, the NWDAF collects the data as listed in
Table 6.12.2-1.

control.
* * *
As described in Table 6.12.2-1, the NWDAF subscribes to the network data from
SMF(s) by invoking Nsmf_EventExposure_Subscribe service (Event ID = Session
Management Congestion Control Experience for PDU Session, Target of Event
Reporting = one or more SUPI(s), Event Filter information = DNN and/or S-NSSAI
and target period).
### 6.12.3 Output Analytics

### 6.13.4 Procedures
#### 6.13.4.1 Analytics Procedure
Figure 6.13.4.1-1 shows the analytics procedure. The NWDAF can provide
analytics, in the form of statistics or predictions or both.
Figure 6.13.4.1-1: Redundant Transmission Experience analytics provided to an
NF
1\. The analytics consumer sends a request to the NWDAF for analytics on a
specific UE, any UE, or a group of UEs, using either the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo
or Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription service. The NF can request statistics or
predictions or both. The type of analytics is set to Redundant Transmission
Experience. The NF provides the UE id or Internal Group ID in the Target of
Analytics Reporting. Analytics Filter Information optionally contains DNN,
S-NSSAI, Area of Interest, etc.
2\. If the request is authorized and in order to provide the requested
analytics, the NWDAF may subscribe to events with all the serving AMFs for
notification of location changes and may subscribe to events with SMFs serving
PDU Session on URLLC service for notification of redundant transmission
related information.
The NWDAF may subscribe the service data from AF(s) by invoking
Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe service or Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe (if via
NEF).
The NWDAF collects UE mobility information and/or packet measurement
information from OAM, following the procedure captured in clause 6.2.3.2. The
NWDAF collects redundant transmission status from SMF.
NOTE: The NWDAF determines the AMF serving the UE, any UE, or the group of UEs
as described in clause 6.2.2.1.
This step may be skipped when e.g. the NWDAF already has the requested
analytics available.
3\. The NWDAF derives requested analytics.
4\. The NWDAF provide requested Redundant Transmission Experience analytics to
the NF, using either the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify, depending on the service used in step 1.
5-7. If at step 1, the NF has subscribed to receive notifications for
Redundant Transmission Experience analytics, after receiving event
notification from the AMFs, SMF, AFs and OAM subscribed by NWDAF in step 2,
the NWDAF may generate new analytics and provide them to the NF.
If a service consumer is SMF, the Redundant Transmission Experience analytics
can be used to make decision if that redundant transmission shall be performed
or (if activated) shall be stopped regarding the PDU session for URLLC
service.
## 6.14 DN Performance Analytics
### 6.14.1 General

### 6.14.4 Procedures to request DN Performance Analytics for an Application
Figure 6.14.4-1: Procedure for NWDAF providing DN Performance analytics for an
Application
The procedure illustrated in figure 6.14.4-1 allows an analytics consumer to
request Analytics ID \"DN Performance\" for a particular Application. The
analytics consumer includes the Application ID for which DN Performance is
requested. The consumer indicates the Target of Analytics Reporting (e.g.
\"any UE\") and may include as Analytic Filter Information the UPF anchor ID,
DNAI, or Application Server instance that DN performance analytics are
requested.
1\. Analytics consumer sends an Analytics request/subscribe (Analytics ID = DN
Performance Target of Analytics Reporting, Analytics Filter Information =
(Application ID, S-NSSAI, DNN, Area of Interest, UPF anchor ID, DNAI,
Application Server Address(es)), Analytics Reporting Information = Analytics
target period) to NWDAF by invoking a Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request or a
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Subscribe service.
2a. NWDAF subscribes to the performance data from AF defined in table 6.14.2-1
by invoking Nnef_EventExposure_Subscribe or Naf_EventExposure_Subscribe
service (Event ID = Performance Data, Application ID, Event Filter
information), Target of Event Reporting = Any UE) as defined in TS 23.502 [3].
NOTE 1: In the case of trusted AF, NWDAF provides the Area of Interest as a
list of TAIs to AF. In the case of untrusted AF, NEF translates the requested
Area of Interest provided as event filter by NWDAF into geographic zone
identifier(s) that act as event filter for AF.
2b. NWDAF subscribes to the network data from 5GC NF(s) defined in table
6.4.2-2 by invoking Nnf_EventExposure_Subscribe service.
2c. With the collected data, the NWDAF estimates the DN Performance for the
application.
3\. NWDAF provides the data analytics, to the analytics consumer by means of
either Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo_Request response or
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsSubscription_Notify, depending on the service used in step 1.
NOTE 2: For simplicity, the call flow only shows a request-response model for
the interaction of NWDAF and analytics consumer instead of both request-
response model and subscription-notification model.
If the analytics consumer is an SMF, the SMF may use the analytics to
determine the UPF and DNAI that offers the best user plane performance.
If the analytics consumer is an AF, the AF may use the analytics to determine
the DNAI that has the best user plane performance if Application Server
relocation is required.
