# 1 Scope
This document specifies the functional architecture, procedures and
information flows needed to support mission critical services in the IOPS mode
of operation. The IOPS mode of operation is defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [2].
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.346 [9] and
3GPP TS 22.280 [11].
The present document is applicable primarily to support mission critical
services in the IOPS mode of operation defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [2]. For
that, the mission critical services are supported using E-UTRAN access based
on the EPC architecture.
The functional architecture to support mission critical services in the IOPS
mode of operation can be used for public safety applications and also for
general commercial applications, e.g. utility companies and railways, for the
case of a backhaul failure.

# 4 Introduction
For the case of a backhaul failure, mission critical (MC) services (e.g. MCPTT
defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [5] and MCData defined in 3GPP TS 23.282 [6]) can
also be supported based on the availability of an isolated operation for
public safety (IOPS) MC system. The IOPS MC system provides MC services
support to the MC service UE via a single public land mobile network (PLMN)
dedicated to the IOPS mode of operation. This IOPS dedicated PLMN is provided
by an evolved packet system (EPS) supporting the IOPS mode of operation, as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [2].
A common functional architecture, including application plane and signalling
plane, to support MC services in the IOPS mode of operation is specified in
this document.
# 5 Architectural requirements

## 5.4 IP connectivity functionality
### 5.4.1 Description
The support of MC services in the IOPS mode of operation can be based on the
support of the IP connectivity functionality. The IP connectivity
functionality enables that MC services are provided by the MC service clients
via the IOPS MC connectivity function.
An IOPS MC connectivity function supporting the IP connectivity functionality
does not provide MC services. Instead, the IOPS MC connectivity function
enables discovering MC service users and provides IP connectivity for the
communication among the discovered MC service users, i.e. it distributes the
related IP traffic to the MC service UEs over IP unicast and/or multicast
transmissions. A MC service UE supporting the IP connectivity functionality in
the IOPS mode of operation enables transmitting the IP packets related to a MC
service communication over the IOPS MC connectivity function.

users requesting the support of the IP connectivity functionality.
[AR-5.4.2-d] The MC service UEs supporting the IP connectivity functionality
in the IOPS mode of operation shall enable transmitting the IP packets related
to a MC service communication over the IOPS MC connectivity function.
### 5.4.3 Bearer management requirements

IP connectivity functionality, as follows:
\- An APN for the IOPS related application signalling related to the IP
connectivity functionality support, e.g. for IOPS discovery, subscription and
notification.
\- An MC service APN for the communication with another MC user or group via
the IOPS MC connectivity function based on the IP connectivity functionality,
e.g. for the signalling and media.
[AR-5.4.3-b] The APNs for the IP connectivity functionality support shall be
made available to the MC service UEs either via UE (pre)configuration or via
initial UE configuration, as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].

function and the 3GPP system (IOPS EPS))
The MC-IOPS-6 reference point, which exists between the IOPS MC connectivity
function and the 3GPP system (IOPS EPS), is used to request the allocation and
activation of multicast transport resources, i.e. MBMS bearers, during the
IOPS mode of operation. The MC-IOPS-6 reference point uses the MB2-C interface
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [4].

# 9 Application of functional model to deployments
## 9.1 Overview
The IOPS architectural model includes application functions at the IOPS MC
system and UEs to support MC services in the IOPS mode of operation during a
backhaul failure. The IOPS MC system provides MC services support to the MC
service UE via a single PLMN dedicated to the IOPS mode of operation. The IOPS
mode of operation is described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [2].
The architectural model to support MC services in the IOPS mode of operation
consists of a signalling control plane and an application plane. The
signalling control plane provides the necessary signalling support for the
related IOPS application layer transactions, e.g. the registration and
discovery of UEs on the IOPS MC system. The IOPS application plane provides
the necessary support for the transport of the IOPS operation related
application data as well as the IP packets containing the MC service
application data to be distributed via the IOPS MC system.
The MC service application data includes all signalling control data and
application data (control and media) required to provide MC services between
MC service clients. The IP related transmissions are established over the IOPS
MC system via IP unicast and multicast transmissions.

with QoS in the IOPS mode of operation, as described in 3GPP TS 23.401 [2].
### 9.2.3 UE 1
The UE 1 is an MC service UE supporting the IOPS mode of operation. It
supports bearer services and applications to provide MC services over the IOPS
MC system. The UE 1 is composed of the following functional entities:
\- for MC services over the IOPS MC system, MC service client(s) as described
in clause 7.4.1.5;

### 10.1.1 General
The following clause describes a high level procedure used for the user
authentication in the IOPS mode of operation.
NOTE: The specific user authentication required in the IOPS mode of operation
needs to be specified by SA3.
Editor\'s Note: Adding reference to the IOPS user authentication procedure in
SA3 TS is FFS.
### 10.1.2 Procedure
A procedure for the user authentication in the IOPS mode of operation is
illustrated in figure 10.1.2-1.

procedure with the IOPS MC connectivity function.
## 10.2 IOPS discovery (IP connectivity functionality)
### 10.2.1 General
The support of the IP connectivity functionality in the IOPS mode of operation
enables that MC services are provided by the MC service clients via the IOPS
MC connectivity function. An IOPS MC connectivity function provides IP
connectivity for the communication among MC service users based on an IOPS
discovery procedure.
The IOPS discovery procedure enables that the IOPS MC connectivity function
discovers MC service users within the coverage of the system and receives
connectivity information required to establish a communication between
discovered users based on the IP connectivity functionality.
The following clauses specify the IOPS discovery procedure and information
flows for the IP connectivity functionality in the IOPS mode of operation.

service ID of the user requesting to be discovered Connectivity status M It
indicates the connectivity status of the requesting MC user on the system IOPS
discovery request periodicity M It indicates the periodicity at which the
requesting MC user is required to transmit IOPS discovery requests (NOTE)
NOTE: An MC user is required to periodically transmit an IOPS discovery
request. The periodic IOPS discovery requests are used by the IOPS MC
connectivity function to verify the availability of the MC user and its IP
connectivity information within the IOPS MC system.
* * *
### 10.2.3 Procedure
After an MC service user is authenticated on the IOPS MC connectivity
function, the IOPS discovery procedure is initiated by the MC users requesting
support of the IP connectivity functionality to the IOPS MC connectivity
function. If the IOPS MC connectivity function indicates the support of the IP
connectivity functionality, the MC service users can send an IOPS discovery
request.
The procedure for requesting support of the IP connectivity functionality by
the IOPS connectivity client to the IOPS MC connectivity function is described
in figure 10.2.3-1.
NOTE 1: The procedure for requesting support of the IP connectivity
functionality is only required when the IOPS connectivity client does not
contain information about the support of this functionality by the serving
IOPS MC connectivity function.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service user is authenticated on the IOPS MC connectivity function.
\- The MC service user has an active PDN connection to the IOPS MC
connectivity function for the specific IP connectivity functionality procedure
\- The IOPS connectivity client does not contain information about the support
of the IP connectivity functionality by the serving IOPS MC connectivity
function
Figure 10.2.3-1 IP connectivity functionality request in the IOPS mode of
operation
1\. The IOPS connectivity client requests to the IOPS MC connectivity function
the support of the IP connectivity functionality.
2\. The IOPS MC connectivity function indicates to the IOPS connectivity
client if the IP connectivity functionality is supported or not for the MC
user.
The procedure for the discovery of MC users in the IOPS mode of operation is
described in figure 10.2.3-2. The IOPS discovery is initiated by the MC users
to support MC services based on the IP connectivity functionality.
As part of the IOPS discovery procedure, an MC user can request higher
priority from the IOPS MC connectivity function by including a priority state
indication within the IOPS discovery request. Based on this indication, the
IOPS MC connectivity function can decide to handle with higher priority the
transactions related to the MC user, e.g. the distribution of packets related
to any MC communication from or to the corresponding MC user, subscriptions,
and notifications. When an MC user intends to establish an IOPS emergency
(group or private) call, the MC user can request a priority state from the
IOPS MC connectivity function.
The MC user\'s priority state remains unchanged until the MC user explicitly
changes it (i.e. by sending a new IOPS discovery request) or the discovery
status of the MC user changes to not-discovered on the IOPS MC connectivity
function.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service user is authenticated on the IOPS MC connectivity function.
\- The MC service user has an active PDN connection to the IOPS MC
connectivity function for the specific IP connectivity functionality procedure
\- The IOPS MC connectivity function has indicated to the IOPS connectivity
client the support of the IP connectivity functionality.
Figure 10.2.3-2 User discovery in the IOPS mode of operation
1\. The MC user sends an IOPS discovery request to the IOPS MC connectivity
function. The request includes providing connectivity information for the
support of MC services based on the IP connectivity functionality.
2\. The IOPS MC connectivity function stores the information received from the
MC user and registers the user\'s connectivity status as discovered.
3\. The IOPS MC connectivity function provides a response to the IOPS
connectivity client indicating the success or failure of the discovery of the
requesting MC user.
NOTE 2: The MC user shall send a new IOPS discovery request to update or
modify information elements.
NOTE 3: The IOPS MC connectivity function shall send a new IOPS discovery
response to the IOPS connectivity client for the case that the periodic IOPS
discovery request has not been received yet or when the IOPS discovery request
periodicity needs to be changed. The IOPS MC connectivity function can verify
the availability and IP connectivity information of the discovered MC user
within the IOPS MC system based on the reception of periodic IOPS discovery
requests.
## 10.3 IOPS subscription and notification (IP connectivity functionality)
### 10.3.1 General
The support of the IP connectivity functionality in the IOPS mode of operation
enables that MC services are provided by the MC service clients over the IOPS
MC connectivity function. An MC user that has been discovered by the IOPS MC
connectivity function can subscribe to be notified about the connectivity
information of other discovered MC users on the IOPS MC connectivity function.
Also, a discovered MC user can subscribe to be notified about the number of
other discovered MC users on the IOPS MC connectivity function within its
associated IOPS groups.
The following clauses specify the IOPS subscription and notification
procedures and information flows for the IP connectivity functionality in the
IOPS mode of operation.

## 10.4 Use of MBMS transmissions
### 10.4.1 General
An IOPS MC connectivity function can provide support for group communications
based on MBMS transmissions. MBMS transmissions can be used for the downlink
delivery of MC service application signalling and media to the MC service UEs
over MBMS bearers.
The use of MBMS transmissions in the IOPS mode of operation are based on the
related information flows and procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], 3GPP
TS 23.379 [5], and 3GPP TS 23.282 [6].
### 10.4.2 Information flows
#### 10.4.2.1 MapIOPSGroupToBearer (IP connectivity functionality)
Table 10.4.2.1-1 describes the information flow to associate a group session
based on the IP connectivity functionality to an MBMS bearer. It is sent from
the IOPS MC connectivity function to the MC service client.
Table 10.4.2.1-1: MapIOPSGroupToBearer (IP connectivity functionality)
Information element Status Description
* * *
IOPS MC service group ID M This element identifies the IOPS MC service group,
in which the group session is started. Media stream identifier M This element
identifies the media stream of the SDP used for the group session (e.g. MBMS
subchannel). TMGI (NOTE) O The MBMS bearer identifier if the media of the
group session is not sent on the same MBMS bearer as this MapIOPSGroupToBearer
message. Session acknowledgement indicator O Indication that the group session
requires acknowledgement from receiving MC service clients. NOTE: TMGI shall
be present if this message is sent over a different MBMS bearer than the media
of the group session; TMGI may be present if this message is sent over the
same MBMS bearer as the media of the group session.
#### 10.4.2.2 UnmapIOPSGroupFromBearer (IP connectivity functionality)
Table 10.4.2.2-1 describes the information flow to disconnect a group session
based on the IP connectivity functionality from an MBMS bearer. It is sent
from the IOPS MC connectivity function to the MC service client.
Table 10.4.2.2-1: UnmapIOPSGroupFromBearer
Information element Status Description
* * *
IOPS MC service group ID M This element identifies the IOPS MC service group,
in which the group session is started.
### 10.4.3 Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
The MC services in the IOPS mode of operation shall support the procedure for
using pre-established MBMS bearers as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [3] with the
following clarification:
\- The MC service server is the IOPS MC connectivity function.
The MCPTT service shall use the MCPTT-IOPS-2, MCPTT-IOPS-4, and MC-IOPS-6
reference points for this procedure.
The MCData service shall use the MCData-IOPS-2, MCData-IOPS-4, and MC-IOPS-6
reference points for this procedure.
The IOPS MC system may use pre-established MBMS bearers for distributing the
media associated to group sessions. Depending on the capacity of the MBMS
bearer, the bearer can be used to broadcast one or more group sessions in
parallel.
### 10.4.4 Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
The MC services in the IOPS mode of operation shall support the procedure for
using dynamic MBMS bearers as specified 3GPP TS 23.280 [3] with the following
clarification:
\- The MC service server is the IOPS MC connectivity function.
The MCPTT service shall use the MCPTT-IOPS-2, MCPTT-IOPS-4, and MC-IOPS-6
reference points for this procedure.
The MCData service shall use the MCData-IOPS-2, MCData-IOPS-4, and MC-IOPS-6
reference points for this procedure.
The IOPS MC system may use dynamic MBMS bearer establishment for distributing
the media associated to group sessions.
### 10.4.5 Group session connect and disconnect over MBMS (IP connectivity
functionality)
#### 10.4.5.1 General
MBMS bearers can be used for group sessions based on the IP connectivity
functionality. One MBMS bearer can be associated to one or more specific
groups or group sessions. Before sending packets related to a group session,
i.e. signalling and media, over an MBMS bearer, the IOPS MC connectivity
function transmits the association information between the group session and
the MBMS bearer. When the group session over the MBMS bearer is finished, this
temporary association information of a group session to specific resources on
a MBMS bearer is undone. Prior to the association of a group session to an
MBMS bearer the MBMS bearer is activated and announced to the MC service
clients.
#### 10.4.5.2 Procedure
##### 10.4.5.2.1 Group Session connect over MBMS
In figure 10.4.5.2.1-1 the MC service client 1 is the client that initiates a
group session, e.g. an MCPTT client initiating a group call. The MC service
client 1 may be within the MBMS service area. The MC service clients 2 ... n
represent MC service clients, e.g. MCPTT clients, receiving the group session
packets over an MBMS bearer. There may be other receiving MC service clients
both over unicast bearers and over this or other MBMS bearer(s), however, they
are not illustrated in this figure.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service user profile used for the IOPS mode of operation is pre-
provisioned in the MC service UEs
\- The IOPS MC service group ID and its associated IOPS group IP multicast
address are pre-configured in the MC service clients
\- The MC service users have an active PDN connection to the IOPS MC
connectivity function for the communication based on the IP connectivity
functionality
\- The MC service users are discovered by the IOPS MC connectivity function to
support MC services based on the IP connectivity functionality
Figure 10.4.5.2.1-1: Group session connect on MBMS bearer (IP connectivity
functionality)
1\. Activation and announcement of MBMS bearer availability.
2\. MC user at the MC service client 1 wants to initiate an MC service group
session with a specific IOPS MC service group based on the IP connectivity
functionality.
3\. The MC service client 1 transmits the related group session packets via
the IOPS MC connectivity function targeting the IOPS MC service group (i.e.
using the corresponding IOPS group IP multicast address)
4\. The IOPS MC connectivity function determines that the received packets
correspond to a group session. Therefore, the IOPS MC connectivity function
transmits a MapIOPSGroupToBearer message over a previously established MBMS
bearer to all users monitoring the MBMS bearer. The MapIOPSGroupToBearer
message includes association information between the group session and the
MBMS bearer. It includes the corresponding IOPS MC service group ID associated
to the IOPS group IP multicast address related to the group session.
5\. The IOPS MC connectivity function distributes the received group session
packets from the MC service client 1 to other MC service clients (e.g. MC
service clients 2 ... n) over the MBMS bearer.
NOTE: MC service clients receiving the group session packets over the MBMS
bearer only decode the packets that are addressed to their pre-configured IOPS
group IP multicast address(es). Otherwise, the MC service clients discard the
packets.
##### 10.4.5.2.2 Group session disconnect over MBMS
Figure 10.4.5.2.2-1 shows the high level procedure where an
UnmapIOPSGroupFromBearer message is transmitted from the IOPS MC connectivity
function to MC service clients to indicate that a group session is being
disconnected or dissociated from the MBMS bearer.
Figure 10.4.5.2.2-1: Group session disconnect on MBMS bearer (IP connectivity
functionality)
1\. A group session based on the IP connectivity functionality is ongoing; the
group session packets received from the MC service client 1 are distributed
over MBMS bearer to other MC service clients within the system.
2\. The IOPS MC connectivity function has determined to disconnect the group
session from the MBMS bearer for the MC service clients within the system.
NOTE: The IOPS MC connectivity function may decide to disconnect a group
session from an MBMS bearer if group session packets are not anymore received
addressing the corresponding IOPS MC service group (or IOPS group IP multicast
address).
3\. An UnmapGroupFromBearer message is transmitted from the IOPS MC
connectivity function to the MC service clients and possibly to the MC service
client 1 (if it is within the MBMS coverage area) on MBMS bearer(s).
## 10.5 MCPTT service
### 10.5.1 IOPS group call (IP connectivity functionality)
#### 10.5.1.1 General
The support of MCPTT group calls based on the IP connectivity functionality in
the IOPS mode of operation enables that the service is provided by the MCPTT
clients over the IOPS MC connectivity function. The IOPS MC connectivity
function provides IP connectivity for the communication among MCPTT users.
IOPS group calls based on the IP connectivity functionality can use pre-
configured information provided to MCPTT clients prior to the IOPS group call.
Therefore, when a MCPTT client initiates an IOPS group call it uses the pre-
configured IOPS group IP multicast address associated to the target IOPS MCPTT
group ID to establish the IOPS group call based on the IP connectivity
functionality. The related packets, i.e. signalling and media, of the IOPS
group call are transmitted to the IOPS MC connectivity function for
distribution to the corresponding discovered MC users of the target IOPS MCPTT
group.
The IOPS MC connectivity function can distribute the group session packets to
the discovered MC users over MBMS bearers as described in clause 10.4.5.
The IOPS MC connectivity function can also replicate and distribute the group
session packets over unicast transmissions to MCPTT UEs associated to the
target IOPS MCPTT group. MCPTT UEs receiving the group session packets are
associated to discovered MC users that included the target IOPS MCPTT group ID
in the IOPS discovery request, as described in clause 10.5.2.3.
The following clauses specify the IOPS group call procedures and information
flows for the IP connectivity functionality in the IOPS mode of operation.
#### 10.5.1.2 Information flows
##### 10.5.1.2.1 IOPS group call announcement
Table 10.5.1.2.1-1 describes the information flow for the IOPS group call

carrying the IOPS group call announcement to the IOPS MC connectivity function
for distribution to the corresponding IOPS group IP multicast address.
3\. The IOPS MC connectivity function determines that the received packets
correspond to a group session targeting a specific IOPS MCPTT group. The IOPS
MC connectivity function decides distributing the received group session
packets to the target MCPTT clients over MBMS and/or unicast transmissions.
4\. The IOPS MC connectivity function distributes the group session packets
carrying the IOPS group call announcement to the MCPTT clients from the target
IOPS MCPTT group.
5\. The MCPTT clients receiving the IOPS group call announcement join the IOPS
group call and notify the target MCPTT users about the IOPS group call.
6\. If confirm mode indication is included in the IOPS group call
announcement, the receiving MCPTT clients respond to the IOPS MCPTT group
indicating the result of the establishment of the announced IOPS group call.
The receiving MCPTT clients transmit the group session packets carrying the
IOPS group call response to the IOPS MC connectivity function for distribution
to the corresponding IOPS group IP multicast address.
NOTE 1: Step 6 can also occur prior to step 5.
7\. The IOPS MC connectivity function determines that the received packets
correspond to a group session targeting a specific IOPS MCPTT group. The IOPS
MC connectivity function decides distributing the received group session
packets to the target MCPTT clients over MBMS and/or unicast transmissions.
8\. The IOPS MC connectivity function distributes the group session packets
carrying the IOPS group call response to the MCPTT clients from the target
IOPS MCPTT group. The MCPTT clients recognize the IOPS group call originator
through the IOPS group call announcement and can check the participants of the
IOPS group call through the received response message.
9\. The MCPTT clients have successfully established the IOPS group call with
floor control based on the IP connectivity functionality.
NOTE 2: Due to the movement of the participants (in and out of the IOPS EPS
coverage) during the IOPS group call, the IOPS group call announcement is
periodically sent by the MCPTT client 1.
NOTE 3: The participating MCPTT clients do not need to respond to the periodic
IOPS group call announcement.
#### 10.5.1.4 IOPS emergency group call
The procedure in figure 10.5.1.4-1 illustrates the procedure for an IOPS MCPTT
emergency group call establishment based on the IP connectivity functionality.
The IOPS emergency group call is a special case of the IOPS group call setup
procedure described in clause 10.5.1.3, wherein the IOPS group call
announcement contains an indication that the IOPS group call is an IOPS
emergency group call. The group call participants can become aware of the IOPS
MCPTT group\'s in-progress emergency state based on the emergency indicator.
When an MCPTT client intends to initiate an IOPS emergency group call, the
MCPTT client can request higher priority from the IOPS MC connectivity
function via the IOPS discovery request.
An IOPS group call in-progress can be upgraded to an IOPS emergency group call
by including the emergency indicator within the periodic IOPS group call
announcement. An IOPS group call in-progress can also be upgraded by a
participating MCPTT client by sending an IOPS emergency group call upgrade to
the IOPS group.
The MCPTT user who initiated an IOPS emergency group call, or upgraded an IOPS
group call to an emergency group call, or an authorized user can cancel the
emergency state of the group call by sending an IOPS emergency group call
state cancel to the IOPS MCPTT group. The emergency state of the IOPS group
call remains active until the emergency group call ends or the in-progress
emergency state is cancelled.
Pre-conditions:
\- MCPTT user profile used for the IOPS mode of operation is pre-provisioned
in the MCPTT UEs;
\- The IOPS MCPTT group ID and its associated IOPS group IP multicast address
are pre-configured in the MCPTT clients;
\- MCPTT users have an active PDN connection to the IOPS MC connectivity
function for the communication based on the IP connectivity functionality;
\- MCPTT users affiliated to the target IOPS MCPTT group are discovered by the
IOPS MC connectivity function supporting the IP connectivity functionality;
\- The IOPC MC connectivity function may have established an MBMS bearer and
announced it to the MCPTT clients;
\- MCPTT client 1 may have retrieved group connectivity information from the
IOPS connectivity client related to the target IOPS MCPTT group;
\- MCPTT clients 1, 2 ... n are configured within the same IOPS MCPTT group.
Figure 10.5.1.4-1: IOPS emergency group call setup based on the IP
connectivity functionality
1\. The MCPTT user at MCPTT client 1 would like to initiate an IOPS emergency
group call with a specific IOPS MCPTT group based on the IP connectivity
functionality.
NOTE 1: The MCPTT client 1 may have previously requested higher priority from
the IOPS MC connectivity function using the IOPS discovery request.
2\. The MCPTT client 1 sends an IOPS group call announcement to the target
IOPS MCPTT group. The announcement contains an indication that the call is an
IOPS emergency group call. The MCPTT client 1 transmits the group session
packets carrying the IOPS group call announcement to the IOPS MC connectivity
function for distribution to the corresponding IOPS group IP multicast
address.
3\. The IOPS MC connectivity function determines that the received packets
correspond to a group session targeting a specific IOPS MCPTT group. The IOPS
MC connectivity function decides to distribute the received group session
packets to the target MCPTT clients over MBMS and/or unicast transmissions. If
the MCPTT client 1 requested a priority state from the IOPS MC connectivity
function, the IOPS MC connectivity function distributes the group session
packets with higher priority.
4\. The IOPS MC connectivity function distributes the group session packets
carrying the IOPS group call announcement to the MCPTT clients from the target
IOPS MCPTT group.
5\. The MCPTT clients receiving the IOPS group call announcement with an
emergency indicator join the IOPS emergency group call and notify the target
MCPTT users about the IOPS emergency group call. The IOPS MCPTT group\'s
emergency state is defined.
NOTE 2: Whilst the emergency state of the IOPS group call remains active,
other participating MCPTT clients of the group call may also request higher
priority from the IOPS MC connectivity function using the IOPS discovery
request.
6\. If confirm mode indication is included in the IOPS group call
announcement, the receiving MCPTT clients respond to the IOPS MCPTT group
indicating the result of the establishment of the announced IOPS emergency
group call. The receiving MCPTT clients transmit the group session packets
carrying the IOPS group call response to the IOPS MC connectivity function for
distribution to the corresponding IOPS group IP multicast address.
NOTE 3: Step 6 can also occur prior to step 5.
7\. The IOPS MC connectivity function determines that the received packets
correspond to a group session targeting a specific IOPS MCPTT group. The IOPS
MC connectivity function decides to distribute the received group session
packets to the target MCPTT clients over MBMS and/or unicast transmissions. If
any participating MCPTT client of the group call requested a priority state
from the IOPS MC connectivity function, the IOPS MC connectivity function
distributes the group session packets with higher priority.
8\. The IOPS MC connectivity function distributes the group session packets
carrying the IOPS group call response to the MCPTT clients from the target
IOPS MCPTT group. The MCPTT clients recognize the IOPS emergency group call
originator through the IOPS group call announcement and can check the
participants of the IOPS group call through the received response message.
9\. The MCPTT clients have successfully established the IOPS emergency group
call based on the IP connectivity functionality.
NOTE 4: Due to the movement of the participants (in and out of the IOPS EPS
coverage) during the IOPS emergency group call, the IOPS group call
announcement is periodically sent by the MCPTT client 1.
NOTE 5: The participating MCPTT clients do not need to respond to the periodic
IOPS group call announcement.
#### 10.5.1.5 IOPS group call release
Each MCPTT client may release itself from an ongoing IOPS group call without
the transmission of any signalling if the call has been inactive for a
specific duration.
NOTE: Inactivity time can be set according to the policy of the MCPTT service
provider.
### 10.5.2 IOPS private call (IP connectivity functionality)
#### 10.5.2.1 General
The support of MCPTT private calls based on the IP connectivity functionality
in the IOPS mode of operation enables that the service is provided by the
MCPTT clients over the IOPS MC connectivity function. The IOPS MC connectivity
function provides IP connectivity for the communication among MCPTT users.
When an MCPTT user wants to communicate with a specific target MCPTT user
based on the IP connectivity functionality, the MCPTT client retrieves the
connectivity information of the target MCPTT user (i.e. the MCPTT UE\'s IP
address) from the IOPS connectivity client. Then, the MCPTT clients enable
establishing the IOPS private call over the IOPS MC connectivity function. The
related session packets, i.e. signalling and media, of the IOPS private call
are transmitted to the IOPS MC connectivity function addressing the
corresponding target MCPTT UE\'s IP address.
NOTE: The IOPS connectivity client can only provide connectivity information
of the target MCPTT user if it is already available (see clauses 10.3 on IOPS
subscription and notification procedures).
The IOPS MC connectivity function distributes the received session packets
over unicast transmissions to the target MCPTT client.
IOPS private calls can be setup in two different commencement modes, automatic
commencement mode and manual commencement mode.
The following clauses specify the IOPS private call procedures and information
flows for the IP connectivity functionality in the IOPS mode of operation.

### 10.5.3 IOPS floor control (IP connectivity functionality)
#### 10.5.3.1 General
For MCPTT calls based on the IP connectivity functionality in the IOPS mode of
operation, floor control is performed by using floor control messages among
the MCPTT clients without a centralized MCPTT server. The MCPTT client can
transmit voice packets over the IOPS MC connectivity function once it is
granted the right to speak, either locally in the UE or by the reception of a
floor granted message from another MCPTT client.
The MCPTT client currently speaking performs the temporary floor arbitrator
during speaking since there is no centralized MCPTT floor control server. The
floor arbitrator controls the floor whether or not queue is supported, and
when floor is requested with override. If queue is supported, the MCPTT client
performing floor arbitrator grants the right to speak to the next speaker and
transfers the floor arbitrator role after completing the voice transfer and
releasing the floor. For IOPS group calls, the floor arbitrator also transfers
the floor control queue when granting the floor. The next MCPTT client
receiving the right to speak becomes the new floor arbitrator and, for IOPS
group calls, has the floor control queue.
For IOPS group calls, the group session packets carrying the floor control
messages can be transmitted by the IOPS MC connectivity function over MBMS
transmissions and can be monitored by all the members from the target IOPS
MCPTT group.
The following clauses specify the floor control procedures and information
flows for IOPS private calls and IOPS group calls based on the IP connectivity
functionality in the IOPS mode of operation.
#### 10.5.3.2 Information flows
##### 10.5.3.2.1 IOPS floor request
Table 10.5.3.2.1-1 describes the information flow for the IOPS floor request,
from the floor participant to another floor participant, which is used to
request the floor for media transfer. The packet(s) carrying the IOPS floor
request are transmitted from the requesting MCPTT client to the IOPS MC
connectivity function for distribution to the target MCPTT client.

high level floor control procedure during periods **when there is no
detectable talker in an IOPS group call based on the IP connectivity
functionality**.
NOTE 1: The description also applies to IOPS private calls.
Pre-conditions:
\- MCPTT user profile used for the IOPS mode of operation is pre-provisioned
in the MCPTT UEs.
\- MCPTT users have an active PDN connection to the IOPS MC connectivity
function for the communication based on the IP connectivity functionality
\- The IOPS MCPTT group ID and its associated IOPS group IP multicast address
are pre-configured in the MCPTT clients (for the case of an IOPS group call)
\- The IOPC MC connectivity function may have established an MBMS bearer and
announced it to the MCPTT clients
\- The MCPTT users are discovered by the IOPS MC connectivity function
supporting the IP connectivity functionality.
\- MCPTT clients has retrieved connectivity information from the target MCPTT
user (for the case of an IOPS private call).
\- An IOPS private call or IOPS group call based on the IP connectivity
functionality has been established. No participant is currently talking (i.e.
the floor is idle) and no floor arbitrator is identified.

the IP connectivity functionality (no floor contention)
1\. The MCPTT client 1 sends the IOPS floor request message to the target IOPS
MCPTT group. The MCPTT client 1 transmits the group session packets carrying
the IOPS floor request message to the IOPS MC connectivity function for
distribution to the corresponding IOPS group IP multicast address.
2\. The IOPS MC connectivity function determines that the received packets
correspond to a group session targeting a specific IOPS MCPTT group. The IOPS
MC connectivity function decides distributing the received group session
packets to the target MCPTT clients over MBMS and/or unicast transmissions.
3\. The IOPS MC connectivity function distributes the group session packets
carrying the IOPS floor request to the MCPTT clients from the target IOPS
MCPTT group.
4\. The MCPTT client 1 does not detect any floor contention. Floor contention
occurs when multiple floor requests may exist simultaneously.
NOTE 2: The mechanism for detecting floor contention in the IOPS mode of
operation is out of scope of the present document.
5\. The MCPTT client 1 sends the IOPS floor taken message to the IOPS MCPTT
group. The MCPTT client 1 transmits the group session packets carrying the
IOPS floor taken message to the IOPS MC connectivity function for distribution
to the corresponding IOPS group IP multicast address.
6\. The IOPS MC connectivity function determines that the received packets
correspond to a group session targeting a specific IOPS MCPTT group. The IOPS
MC connectivity function decides distributing the received group session

#### 10.6.1.3 IOPS one-to-one standalone SDS using signalling control plane
##### 10.6.1.3.1 General
When an MCData user initiates an IOPS standalone SDS data transfer with
another MCData user using the signalling control plane based on the IP
connectivity functionality, the MCData client retrieves the connectivity
information of the target MCData user (i.e. the MCData UE\'s IP address) from
the IOPS connectivity client. Then, the MCData client enables the IOPS SDS
data transfer over the IOPS MC connectivity function. The related session
packets, i.e. signalling messages, carrying the data are transmitted to the
IOPS MC connectivity function addressing the corresponding target MCData UE\'s
IP address.
NOTE: The IOPS connectivity client can only provide connectivity information
of the target MCData user if it is already available (see clauses 10.3 on IOPS
subscription and notification procedures).
The IOPS MC connectivity function distributes the received session packets
over unicast transmissions to the target MCData client.
##### 10.6.1.3.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 10.6.1.3.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user
is initiating an IOPS one-to-one MCData communication for sending standalone
SDS data over signalling control plane to another MCData user, with or without
disposition request. Standalone refers to sending unidirectional data in one
transaction.
Pre-conditions:
\- MCData user profile used for the IOPS mode of operation is pre-provisioned
in the MCData UEs.
\- MCData users have an active PDN connection to the IOPS MC connectivity
function for the communication based on the IP connectivity functionality.
\- The MCData users are discovered by the IOPS MC connectivity function
supporting the IP connectivity functionality.
\- MCData clients have retrieved connectivity information from target MCData
users.
Figure 10.6.1.3.2-1: IOPS one-to-one standalone SDS using signalling control
plane based on the IP connectivity functionality
1\. The MCData user at MCData client 1 would like to initiate an IOPS SDS data
transfer with the MCData user at MCData client 2 based on the IP connectivity
functionality. The MCData client 1 checks whether the MCData user 1 is
authorized to send an IOPS MCData standalone data request.
2\. The MCData client 1 retrieves the connectivity information of the target
MCData user from the IOPS connectivity client 1 (not shown in figure) and
sends an IOPS MCData standalone data request towards the MCData client 2. The
MCData client 1 transmits the session packets carrying the IOPS MCData
standalone data request to the IOPS MC connectivity function for distribution
to the corresponding target MCData UE 2\'s IP address.
The IOPS MCData standalone data request contains the data payload, i.e. the
SDS content. The request also contains a conversation identifier for message
thread indication and may contain a disposition request if indicated by the
user at MCData client 1.
3\. The IOPS MC connectivity function receives the session packets addressing
the MCData UE 2\'s IP address. The IOPS MC connectivity function checks if the
MCData UE 2\'s IP address corresponds to a discovered MC user in order to
distribute the received session packets. If it does, the IOPS MC connectivity
function distributes the received session packets to the target MCData client
over unicast transmissions.
4\. The IOPS MC connectivity function distributes the session packets carrying
the IOPS MCData standalone data request to the MCData client 2.
5\. Upon the receipt of the IOPS MCData standalone data request, the MCData
client 2 checks whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of
message or content to certain members due to, for example, location or user
privilege. If the policy assertion is positive and the payload is for MCData
user consumption (e.g. it is not application data, not command instructions,
etc.) then the MCData client 2 notifies the target MCData user.
The actions taken when the payload contains application data or command
instructions are based on the payload content. Payload content received by
MCData client 2 which is addressed to a known local non-MCData application
that is not yet running shall cause the MCData client 2 to start the local
non-MCData application (i.e., remote start application) and shall pass the
payload content to the just started application.
NOTE: If the policy assertion was negative, the MCData client 2 sends an
appropriate notification to MCData client 1.
6\. If MCData data disposition was indicated (for delivery, read or both)
within the request sent by the MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData
client 2 initiates the corresponding IOPS MCData data disposition
notification(s) towards the MCData client 1, i.e. addressing the MCData UE
1\'s IP address.
7\. The IOPS MC connectivity function receives the session packets addressing
the MCData UE 1\'s IP address. The IOPS MC connectivity function checks if the
MCData UE 1\'s IP address corresponds to a discovered MC user in order to
distribute the received session packets. If it does, the IOPS MC connectivity
function distributes the received session packets to the target MCData client
over unicast transmissions.
8\. The IOPS MC connectivity function distributes the session packets carrying
the IOPS MCData data disposition notification to the MCData client 1.
#### 10.6.1.4 IOPS group standalone SDS using signalling control plane
##### 10.6.1.4.1 General
IOPS group standalone SDS using signalling control plane based on the IP
connectivity functionality can use pre-configured information provided to
MCData clients prior to initiating the data service. When an MCData client
initiates an IOPS group standalone SDS based on the IP connectivity
functionality it uses the pre-configured IOPS group IP multicast address
associated to the target IOPS MCData group ID. The related group session
packets, i.e. signalling messages, carrying the data are transmitted to the
IOPS MC connectivity function for distribution to the corresponding discovered
MC users of the target IOPS MCData group.
The IOPS MC connectivity function can distribute the group session packets to
the discovered MC users over MBMS bearers as described in clause 10.4.5.
The IOPS MC connectivity function can also replicate and distribute the group
session packets over unicast transmissions to MCData UEs associated to the
target IOPS MCData group. MCData UEs receiving the group session packets are
associated to discovered MC users that included the target IOPS MCData group
ID within the IOPS discovery request, as described in clause 10.5.2.3.
##### 10.6.1.4.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 10.6.1.4.2-1 describes the case where an MCData user
is initiating an IOPS group MCData communication for sending standalone SDS
data over signalling control plane to an IOPS MCData group, with or without
disposition request. Standalone refers to sending unidirectional data in one
transaction.
Pre-conditions:
\- MCData user profile used for the IOPS mode of operation is pre-provisioned
in the MCData UEs.
\- The IOPS MCData group ID and its associated IOPS group IP multicast address
are pre-configured in the MCData clients.
\- MCData users have an active PDN connection to the IOPS MC connectivity
function for the communication based on the IP connectivity functionality.
\- MCData users affiliated to the target IOPS MCData group are discovered by
the IOPS MC connectivity function supporting the IP connectivity
functionality.
\- The IOPS MC connectivity function may have established an MBMS bearer and
announced it to the MCData clients.
\- MCData client 1 may have retrieved group connectivity information from the
IOPS connectivity client related to the target IOPS MCData group.
\- MCData clients 1, 2 ... n are configured within the same IOPS MCData group.
Figure 10.6.1.4.2-1: IOPS group standalone SDS using signalling control plane
based on the IP connectivity functionality
1\. The MCData user at MCData client 1 would like to initiate an IOPS SDS data
transfer with a specific IOPS MCData group based on the IP connectivity
functionality. The MCData client 1 checks whether the MCData user 1 is
authorized to send an IOPS MCData group standalone data request.
2\. The MCData client 1 sends an IOPS MCData group standalone data request to
the target IOPS MCData group. The MCData client 1 transmits the group session
packets carrying the IOPS MCData group standalone data request to the IOPS MC
connectivity function for distribution to the corresponding IOPS group IP
multicast address.
The IOPS MCData group standalone data request contains the data payload, i.e.
the SDS content. The request also contains a conversation identifier for
message thread indication and may contain a disposition request if indicated
by the user at MCData client 1.
3\. The IOPS MC connectivity function determines that the received packets
correspond to a group session targeting a specific IOPS MCData group. The IOPS
MC connectivity function decides distributing the received group session
packets to the target MCData clients over MBMS and/or unicast transmissions.
4\. The IOPS MC connectivity function distributes the group session packets
carrying the IOPS MCData group standalone data request to the discovered
MCData clients from the target IOPS MCData group.
5\. The MCData clients receiving the IOPS MCData group standalone data request
check whether any policy is to be asserted to limit certain types of message
or content to certain members due to, for example, location or user privilege.
If the policy assertion is positive and the payload is for MCData user
consumption (e.g. it is not application data, not command instructions, etc.)
then the MCData clients notify the target MCData users.
The actions taken when the payload contains application data or command
instructions are based on the payload content. Payload content received by an
MCData client which is addressed to a known local non-MCData application that
is not yet running shall cause the MCData client to start the local non-MCData
application (i.e., remote start application) and shall pass the payload
content to the just started application.
NOTE: If the policy assertion was negative, the corresponding MCData client
sends an appropriate notification to MCData client 1.
6\. If MCData data disposition was indicated (for delivery, read or both)
within the request sent by the MCData client 1, then the receiving MCData
clients initiate the corresponding IOPS MCData data disposition
notification(s) towards the MCData client 1, i.e. addressing the MCData UE
1\'s IP address.
7\. The IOPS MC connectivity function receives the session packets addressing
the MCData UE 1\'s IP address. The IOPS MC connectivity function checks if the
MCData UE 1\'s IP address corresponds to a discovered MC user in order to
distribute the received session packets. If it does, the IOPS MC connectivity
function distributes the received session packets to the target MCData client
over unicast transmissions.
8\. The IOPS MC connectivity function distributes the session packets carrying
the IOPS MCData data disposition notification to the MCData client 1.
## 10.7 MC IOPS notification
### 10.7.1 General
In the IOPS mode of operation, it is assumed that the IOPS MC system does not
have connectivity to the primary MC system due to the backhaul failure.
Therefore, the primary MC system cannot be aware of the initiation of the IOPS
operation and the corresponding activation of an IOPS MC connectivity function
within the primary MC system coverage.
When an IOPS MC system is active, MC service UEs can move around and may enter
and leave the IOPS MC system coverage, i.e. the MC service users may switch
from the active IOPS MC connectivity function to the MC service server of the
primary MC system, and vice versa.
In order to notify the primary MC service server about the active IOPS MC
connectivity function, when MC service users register to the primary MC
service server after being recently registered to the IOPS MC connectivity
function, the MC service users can provide information to the primary MC
service server about the active IOPS MC connectivity function and optionally
include associated dynamic information. The primary MC service server uses the
provided information to become aware of the active IOPS MC connectivity
function.
NOTE: Dynamic information can be, e.g., information about other available MC
service users or active MC service groups that the MC service user identified
while on the IOPS MC connectivity function. The primary MC service server can
use the dynamic information to determine that affiliated MC service users
might be registered on the active IOPS MC connectivity function and might not
be reachable on the system.
Upon the receipt of the notification, the primary MC service server may notify
other MC service users in the proximity of the IOPS MC system coverage about
the corresponding active IOPS MC connectivity function. This information can
be used by the MC service users to optimize the user experience, e.g. to
improve the switching time between systems and to obtain information about the
potential availability of other registered MC service users or active MC
service groups on the IOPS MC connectivity function.
### 10.7.2 Information flows

### 10.7.3 MC IOPS notification procedure
Figure 10.7.3-1 describes the IOPS MC notification procedure when an MC
service user has left an active IOPS MC system and enters the primary MC
system.
Pre-conditions:
\- There is an active IOPS MC connectivity function and the neighbouring cells
of the IOPS MC system are part of the primary MC system.
\- The MC service user 1 is initially registered to the IOPS MC connectivity
function for the support of MC services in the IOPS mode of operation. The MC
service user 1 is authorized to provide MC IOPS notifications to the primary
MC service server.
\- The MC service user 2 is registered to the primary MC service server and is
in the proximity of the IOPS MC system coverage.
\- MC server users 1 and 2 are members of the same MC service group or are
authorized to have a one-to-one MC service communication.
Figure 10.7.3-1: MC IOPS notification procedure
1\. An IOPS mode of operation is active and the MC service communication is
handled by the IOPS MC connectivity function. The MC service client 1 is
registered to the IOPS MC connectivity function.
2\. The MC service client 1 moves out of the coverage of the IOPS MC system
and registers to the primary MC service server.
3\. The MC service client 1 sends a MC IOPS notification to the primary MC
service server to provide information about an active IOPS MC connectivity
function in the area. This notification includes information about the active
IOPS MC connectivity function such as server URI, associated IOPS PLMN ID, and
location information. Also, the MC service client 1 may indicate which MC
service groups and MC service users were identified as active and available on
the IOPS MC connectivity function.
4\. The primary MC service server becomes aware of the active IOPS MC
connectivity function and can use the received information to determine that
affiliated MC service users might be registered on the active IOPS MC
connectivity function and might not be reachable on the system. If the primary
MC service server determines that the IOPS MC connectivity function is active
and identifies that affiliated MC service users are in the proximity of the
IOPS MC system, the primary MC service server may notify the corresponding MC
service users about the IOPS MC connectivity function.
NOTE 1: The primary MC service server can use received information from
different MC IOPS notifications (e.g. location information including the time
of measurement) and the information obtained from location information
subscriptions (as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3]) to determine if the IOPS MC
connectivity function might be still active. For instance, if information
received from location information subscriptions indicates that MC service
users are located within the notified active IOPS MC system coverage, the
primary MC service server can determine that the IOPS MC connectivity function
is no longer active.
5\. If the primary MC service server determines that the IOPS MC connectivity
function is active, it sends a MC IOPS notification to the MC service client 2
in proximity of the active IOPS MC system coverage. This information can be
used by the MC service user to become aware of the active IOPS MC connectivity
function. Hence, the MC service user might decide to not move into the IOPS MC
system coverage or to improve the switching time between the systems. Also,
the MC service user can be aware of the potential availability of MC service
users or active MC service groups on the IOPS MC connectivity function.
NOTE 2: The MC IOPS notification can be sent on an MBMS bearer configured
within the proximity of the active IOPS MC system to target multiple MC
service users. In this case, information about the active MC service IDs and
MC service group IDs is not included in the MC IOPS notification.
###### ## Annex A (normative): Configuration data for the support of MC
services in the IOPS mode of operation
# A.1 General
This Annex provides information about the static configuration data needed for
the support of MC services in the IOPS mode of operation.
The configuration data belong to one of the following categories:
\- MC service UE configuration data (see subclause A.2);
\- MC service user profile configuration data (see subclause A.3);
\- MC service group configuration data (see subclause A.4); and
\- MC service configuration data (see subclause A.5).
The configuration data in each configuration category corresponds to a single
instance of the category type i.e. the MC service UE, MC service group, MC
service user and MC service configuration data refers to the information that
will be stored against each MC service UE, MC service group, MC service user
and MC service.
NOTE: The configuration data described in this Annex together with
corresponding configuration data provided in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], 3GPP TS
23.379 [5] and 3GPP TS 23.282 [6] represent the complete set of data for each
configuration data category element.
The columns in the tables have the following meanings:
\- Reference: the reference of the corresponding requirement in 3GPP TS 22.346
[9] and 3GPP TS 22.280 [11] or the corresponding clause from either the
present document or the referenced document.
\- Parameter description: A short definition of the semantics of the
corresponding item of data, including denotation of the level of the parameter
in the configuration hierarchy.
\- When it is not clear to which functional entities the parameter is
configured, then one or more columns indicating this are provided where the
following nomenclature is used:
\- \"Y\" to denote \"Yes\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row needs to be
configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
\- \"N\" to denote \"No\" i.e. the parameter denoted for the row does not need
to be configured to the functional entity denoted for the column.
Parameters within a set of configuration data have a level within a hierarchy
that pertains only to that configuration data. The level of a parameter within
the hierarchy of the configuration data is denoted by use of the character
\">\" in the parameter description field within each table, one per level.
Parameters that are at the topâ€‘most level within the hierarchy have no \">\"
character. Parameters that have one or more \">\" characters are child
parameters of the first parameter above them that has one less \">\"
character. Parent parameters are parameters that have one or more child
parameters. Parent parameters act solely as a \"grouping\" of their child
parameters and therefore do not contain an actual value themselves i.e. they
are just containers for their child parameters.
Each parameter that can be configured online shall only be configured through
one online reference point. Each parameter that can be configured offline
shall only be configured through one offline reference point. The most recent
configuration data made available to the MC service UE shall always overwrite
previous configuration data, irrespective of whether the configuration data
was provided via the online or offline mechanism.
# A.2 MC service UE configuration data
MC service UE configuration data has to be known by an MC service UE after MC
service authorization. The CSC-4 reference point, specified in 3GPP TS 23.280
[3], is used for configuration between the configuration management server and
the configuration management client on the MC service UE when the MC service
UE is on-network.
MC service UE configuration data can be configured offline using the CSC-11
reference point specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].
Within each MC service, the MC service UE configuration data can be the same
or different across MC service UEs.
The MCPTT UE configuration data specified in table A.2-1 in 3GPP TS 23.379 [5]
is also used, as needed, in the IOPS mode of operation for the MCPTT service.
The MCData UE configuration data specified in table A.2-1 in 3GPP TS 23.282
[6] is also used, as needed, in the IOPS mode of operation for the MCData
service.
# A.3 MC service user profile configuration data
The MC service user profile configuration data is stored in the MC service
user database. The configuration management server is used to configure the MC
service user profile configuration data to the MC service user database

# A.4 Group configuration data
As specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], the group configuration data is stored in
the group management server. The group management server is used to configure
the group configuration data to the MC service UE (CSC-2). The group
configuration data can be configured offline using the CSC-12 reference point.
The common group configuration data specified in table A.4-1 in 3GPP TS 23.280
[3] is also used, as needed, in the IOPS mode of operation.
Table A.4-1 described below contains additional group configuration data
required to support MC services in the IOPS mode of operation.

# A.6 Initial MC service UE configuration data
Initial MC service UE configuration data is essential to the MC service UE to
successfully connect to the MC system, as described in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3].
The configuration data defined in table A.6-1 is additionally provided to the
MC service UE\'s clients to successfully connect to the IOPS MC system in the
IOPS mode of operation. The MC service UE\'s clients (e.g. MC service client,
IOPS connectivity client) obtain the data during the bootstrap process
(described in clause 10.1.1 in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3]), and can be configured on
the MC service UE offline using the CSC-11 reference point or via other means
e.g. as part of the MC service client\'s provisioning on the UE, using a
device management procedure.
