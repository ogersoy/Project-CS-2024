# Introduction
This document specifies a functional architecture for service enabler
architecture layer (SEAL) over 3GPP networks to support vertical applications
(e.g. V2X applications). This functional architecture will include common
application plane and signalling plane entities. A set of common services
(e.g. group management, configuration management, location management)
specified in this document can be shared across vertical applications.
The SEAL functional architecture takes into consideration the common
capabilities to support mission critical and other vertical applications.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the functional architecture for service enabler
architecture layer (SEAL) and the procedures, information flows and APIs for
each service within SEAL in order to support vertical applications over the
3GPP system. The present document is applicable to vertical applications using
E-UTRAN or NR access based on the EPC or 5GS architecture defined in 3GPP TS
23.401 [9] and 3GPP TS 23.501 [10]. To ensure efficient use and deployment of
vertical applications over 3GPP systems this specification for SEAL services
includes the group management, configuration management, location management,
identity management, key management and network resource management.
NOTE: In the present document, the multicast services offered by SEAL are only
applicable for EPS.

# 6 Generic functional model for SEAL services
## 6.1 General
The functional model for SEAL is organized into generic SEAL service
functional model and specific SEAL service functional models. The generic SEAL
service functional model will be used as the reference model for the specific
SEAL service functional models.
The following SEAL services are supported towards the vertical application
layer:
\- Location management;
\- Group management;
\- Configuration management;
\- Identity management;
\- Key management; and
\- Network resource management.
The generic functional model for the SEAL is organized into generic functional
entities to describe a functional architecture which addresses the application
layer support aspects for vertical applications. The on-network and off-
network functional model is specified in this clause.
## 6.2 On-network functional model description
Figure 6.2-1 illustrates the generic on-network functional model for SEAL.
Figure 6.2-1: Generic on-network functional model
In the vertical application layer, the VAL client communicates with the VAL
server over VAL-UU reference point. VAL-UU supports both unicast and multicast
delivery modes.
NOTE 1: The VAL-UU reference point is out of scope of the present document.
The SEAL functional entities on the UE and the server are grouped into SEAL
client(s) and SEAL server(s) respectively. The SEAL consists of a common set
of services (e.g. group management, location management) and reference points.
The SEAL offers its services to the vertical application layer (VAL).
NOTE 2: The functionalities and reference points of the vertical application
layer are out of scope of the present document.
NOTE 3: The vertical application layer may further consist of vertical
application enabler layer functionalities (specified by 3GPP) and application
specific functionalities, which is out of scope of the present document.
The SEAL client(s) communicates with the SEAL server(s) over the SEAL-UU
reference points. SEAL-UU supports both unicast and multicast delivery modes.
The SEAL client(s) provides the service enabler layer support functions to the
VAL client(s) over SEAL-C reference points. The VAL server(s) communicate with
the SEAL server(s) over the SEAL-S reference points. The SEAL server(s) may
communicate with the underlying 3GPP network systems using the respective 3GPP
interfaces specified by the 3GPP network system.
Editor\'s Note: SEAL-UU support for multicast delivery is FFS.
The specific SEAL client(s) and the SEAL server(s) along with their specific
SEAL-UU reference points and the specific network interfaces of 3GPP network
system used are described in the respective on-network functional model for
each SEAL service.
Figure 6.2-2 illustrates the functional model for interconnection between SEAL
servers.

In the vertical application layer, the VAL client of UE1 communicates with VAL
client of UE2 over VAL-PC5 reference point. A SEAL client of UE1 interacts
with the corresponding SEAL client of UE2 over SEAL-PC5 reference points. The
UE1, if connected to the network via Uu reference point, can also act as a UE-
to-network relay, to enable UE2 to access the VAL server(s) over the VAL-UU
reference point.
NOTE: The VAL-PC5 reference point is out of scope of the present document.
Editor\'s Note: The functionalities of reference points between the SEAL
clients of two UEs over SEAL-PC5 reference point is FFS.
The specific SEAL client(s) along with their specific SEAL-PC5 reference
points are described in the respective offâ€‘network functional model for each
SEAL service.

###### 6.4.3.1.3.1 General
The SIP core contains a number of sub-entities responsible for registration,
service selection and routing in the signalling control plane.
The SIP core shall be either:
1\. compliant with 3GPP TS 23.228 [15], i.e. the SIP core is a 3GPP IP
multimedia core network subsystem; or
2\. a SIP core, which internally need not comply with the architecture of 3GPP
TS 23.228 [15], but with the reference points that are defined in subclause
6.5.3 (if exposed), compliant to the reference points defined in 3GPP TS
23.002 [14].
The data related to the functions of the SIP core, e.g. for data for
application service selection, the identity of the serving registrar or
authentication related information may be provided by the PLMN operator
responsible for the bearer plane. In this case, the SIP database that is the
source of the data may be part of the HSS. Alternatively, this data may be
provided by the VAL service provider. In this case, the source of the data may
be the VAL service provider\'s SIP database.
###### 6.4.3.1.3.2 Local inbound / outbound proxy
The local inbound / outbound proxy functional entity acts as both an inbound
proxy and an outbound proxy for all SIP transactions. This functional entity
can provide the following functions:
\- NAT traversal;
\- Resource control;
\- Route/forward requests and responses to the user agents;
\- SIP signalling security; and
\- Depending on the PLMN operator policy, discovery and address resolution,
including E.164 numbers.
NOTE: In the IM CN subsystem, this functional entity is provided by the P-CSCF
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [15].
###### 6.4.3.1.3.3 Registrar finder
The registrar finder functional entity is responsible for:
a) Identifying the serving registrar / application service selection
functional entity. The serving registrar / application service selection
functional entity is identified using information provided either by the PLMN
operator\'s own SIP database or the VAL service provider\'s SIP database, and
optionally using the PLMN operator\'s internal information e.g. network
topology, registrar availability.
1) Registrar finder and registrar in the VAL service provider domain:
registrar finder in the VAL service provider\'s domain uses the information
from the VAL service provider\'s SIP database to identify the serving
registrar in the VAL service provider domain.
2) Registrar finder and registrar in the PLMN operator domain: registrar
finder uses information from PLMN operator\'s SIP database to identify the
serving registrar in the PLMN operator domain.
3) Registrar finder in PLMN operator domain and registrar in VAL service
provider domain: registrar finder uses information from the VAL service
provider\'s SIP database to identify the serving registrar in the VAL service
provider domain.
NOTE 1: The need for the registrar finder is deployment specific e.g. a
deployment that has only one registrar does not need the registrar finder and
the related SIP database information.
b) Providing discovery and address resolution, including E.164 numbers.
NOTE 2: In the IM CN subsystem, this is provided by the I-CSCF as defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [15].
###### 6.4.3.1.3.4 Registrar / application service selection
The registrar / application service selection functional entity provides the
following functions:
\- Registrar function (with integral provision of a location server) and also
acts as an inbound proxy (with access to the integral location server), and
outbound proxy for all SIP transactions where application service selection is
required. It registers the user and maintains the association of the location
and identity of the user in a location service. It provides notifications of
the registration states.
\- Supports authentication for identities provided within SIP signalling. Both
the registrar (with integral location server) and authentication functions are
supported by access either to the public network\'s own SIP database or the
VAL service provider\'s SIP database.
\- Can provide the application service selection for all SIP transactions,
possibly based on application service selection information stored by either
the public network\'s own SIP database or the VAL service provider\'s SIP
database.
\- Performs SIP signalling security.
NOTE: In the IM CN subsystem, this is provided by the S-CSCF as defined in
3GPP TS 23.228 [15].
##### 6.4.3.1.4 Diameter proxy
This functional entity acts as a proxy agent for Diameter messaging as
specified in IETF RFC 6733 [24].
The Diameter proxy, when used on the AAA-2 interface, is collocated with the
migration management server.
Other instances of the Diameter proxy may also be present in the SIP core /
IMS.
NOTE: The number of instances of the Diameter proxy is deployment specific.
#### 6.4.3.2 SIP database
##### 6.4.3.2.1 General
The SIP database contains information concerning the SIP subscriptions and
corresponding identity and authentication information required by the SIP
core, and such information as application service selection.
In deployment scenarios where the PLMN operator provides the SIP core, this
database is provided by the HSS.
In deployment scenarios where the VAL service provider provides the SIP core,
the SIP database may be provided by the VAL service provider.
Access to the data residing in the SIP database is restricted to the SIP core
entities that are specifically serving the subscriber/user whose data are
stored, i.e. registrars and registrar finders can access SIP databases only
when they are part of the same trust domain for the data being provided.
NOTE: The SIP database can be in a different network than the registrar finder
since the trust domain for the criteria for registrar selection can be
different than the trust domain for the signalling plane user identities.
The SIP database is responsible for storing the following user related
information:
\- signalling plane user identities: Numbering and addressing information;
\- signalling plane security information: SIP core access control information
for authentication and authorization;
\- VAL UE Location information at inter-system level: the SIP database
supports the user registration, and stores inter-system location information,
etc.; and
\- signalling plane subscription profile (including initial filter criteria).
The SIP database also generates signalling plane security information for
mutual authentication, communication integrity check and ciphering.
Based on this information, the SIP database is also responsible to support the
call control and session management entities of the SIP core.
The SIP database consists of the following functionalities:
\- support for control functions of the SIP core such as the Registrar and
Registrar finder. This is needed to enable subscriber usage of the SIP core
services. This functionality is independent of the access network used to
access the SIP core; and
\- authentication functionality required by the SIP core to authenticate the
VAL UE.
##### 6.4.3.2.2 SIP database logical functions
The SIP database provides the following logical functions:
a) mobility management;
\- provides the UE mobility through the SIP core.
b) registrar assignment support;
\- provides to the registrar finder the required capabilities for VAL services
based on VAL service provider requirements on a per-user basis, (e.g. whether
a particular registrar within the PLMN operator\'s network (e.g. a registrar
reserved for VAL service use or a registrar in a secure location) or a
registrar within the VAL service provider network is assigned.
c) call and/or session establishment support;
\- provides the call and/or session establishment procedures in the SIP core.
For terminating traffic, it provides information on which registrar currently
hosts the user.
d) user security information generation;
\- provides generation of user authentication, integrity and ciphering data
for the SIP core.
e) signalling plane security support;
\- provides authentication procedures to access VAL services by storing the
generated data for authentication, integrity and ciphering at the signalling
plane and by providing these data to the appropriate registrar.
f) user identification handling;
\- provides the appropriate relations among all the identifiers uniquely
determining the signalling plane identities in the SIP core e.g. IMS public
identities.
g) access authorisation; and
\- provides authorisation of the user for mobile access when requested by the
registrar e.g. by checking that the user is allowed to roam to that visited
network.
h) service authorisation support.
\- provides basic authorisation for terminating call/session establishment and
service invocation. The SIP database may update the registrar with filter
criteria to trigger the VAL server(s).
#### 6.4.3.3 HTTP entities
##### 6.4.3.3.1 HTTP client
This functional entity acts as the client for all hypertext transactions.
##### 6.4.3.3.2 HTTP proxy
This functional entity acts as a proxy for hypertext transactions between the
HTTP client and one or more HTTP servers. The HTTP proxy terminates a TLS
session on HTTP-1 with the HTTP client of the VAL UE allowing the HTTP client
to establish a single TLS session for hypertext transactions with multiple
HTTP servers that are reachable by the HTTP proxy.
The HTTP proxy terminates the HTTP-3 reference point that lies between
different HTTP proxies. It may provide a topology hiding function from HTTP
entities outside the trust domain of the VAL system.
The HTTP proxy shall be in the same trust domain as the HTTP clients and HTTP
servers that are located within a VAL service provider\'s network. There can
be multiple instances of an HTTP proxy e.g. one per trust domain.
NOTE: The number of instances of the HTTP proxy is deployment specific.
##### 6.4.3.3.3 HTTP server
This functional entity acts as the HTTP server for all hypertext transactions.
#### 6.4.3.4 LWP entities
##### 6.4.3.4.1 LWP client
This functional entity acts as the light-weight protocol client for all
transactions of the SEAL client executing in a constrained UE. A SEAL client
executing in an unconstrained UE may choose to use the LWP client if it is
available.
##### 6.4.3.4.2 LWP proxy
This functional entity acts as a proxy for transactions between the LWP client
and one or more LWP servers. The LWP proxy typically terminates a secure
transport protocol (e.g. DTLS, TLS or secure WebSocket) session on LWP-1
reference point with the LWP client of the VAL UE allowing the LWP client to
establish a single secure session for transactions with multiple LWP servers
that are reachable by the LWP proxy.
The LWP proxy can act as a cross-protocol LWP-HTTP proxy to enable LWP clients
to access resources on HTTP servers via the LWP-HTTP-2 reference point.
The LWP proxy terminates LWP-3 reference point that lies between different LWP
proxies. It may provide a topology hiding function from LWP entities outside
the trust domain of the VAL system.
The LWP proxy can also terminate LWP-HTTP-3 reference point for interworking
with another HTTP proxy. In this role it provides cross-protocol mapping and
may provide a topology hiding function from HTTP entities outside the trust
domain of the VAL system.
The LWP proxy shall be in the same trust domain as the LWP clients and LWP
servers that are located within a VAL service provider\'s network. There can
be multiple instances of a LWP proxy e.g. one per trust domain.
##### 6.4.3.4.3 LWP server
This functional entity acts as the LWP server for all LWP transactions of the
SEAL server.
NOTE: A SEAL client can act as LWP server for certain transactions as required
by the SEAL service.
#### 6.4.3.5 LWP usage
LWP is a generic representation of a light-weight protocol for use in
constrained environments. Realizations of the light-weight protocol (LWP)
functional entities and reference points to a particular protocol are defined
in the annexes of this specification.
LWP is a representation of a protocol to be used by the SEAL service enablers
on their respective SEAL-UU reference points when the SEAL client is executing
in a constrained UE. In this case the SEAL client should use the LWP-1
reference point with the LWP proxy and should use either the LWP-2 or the LWP-
HTTP-2 reference point for transport and routing of the related signalling
with the SEAL server.
Editor\'s note: Which procedures of a SEAL service enabler are not necessary
to be supported for a constrained UE is FFS.
A SEAL client executing in a non-constrained UE may choose to use the LWP-1
reference point with the LWP proxy and may use either the LWP-2 or the LWP-
HTTP-2 reference point for transport and routing of the related signalling
with the SEAL server.
LWP may be used for interactions between SEAL servers on their respective
SEAL-E reference points. For this usage the SEAL-E reference point shall use
the LWP-1 and either the LWP-2 or the LWP-3 reference point depending on the
trust relationship between the interacting SEAL servers.

# 7 Identities
## 7.1 User identity (User ID)
The VAL user presents the user identity to the identity management server
during a user authentication transaction, to provide the identity management
client a means for VAL service authentication. In general, since identity
management is a common SEAL service, it uses a set of credentials (e.g.
biometrics, secureID, username/password) that may not necessarily be tied to a
single VAL service. The user credentials uniquely identifies the VAL user to
the identity management server.
NOTE: The specific security and authentication mechanisms required in order to
use the user ID is specified in 3GPP TS 33.434 [29].
Editor\'s note: The naming and definition of the identities in subclause 7 may
require further study (e.g. renaming user identity to VAL user identity, and
renaming VAL user identity to VAL service user identity).
## 7.2 VAL user identity (VAL user ID)
The VAL user ID is a unique identifier within the VAL service that represents
the VAL user. For example, the VAL user ID may be a URI. The VAL user ID is
used for authentication and authorization purposes for providing the VAL
service towards the VAL user via the VAL UE. The VAL user ID also indicates
the VAL service provider with whom the VAL user has a VAL service agreement.
The VAL user may have VAL service agreement with several VAL service providers
and thus will have obtained unique VAL user ID per VAL service provider. The
VAL user ID can be used to access any SEAL service.
Based on the service agreement, VAL user ID may be mapped to a VAL UE ID.
## 7.3 VAL UE identity (VAL UE ID)
The VAL UE ID is a unique identifier within the VAL service that represents
the VAL UE. For example, the VAL UE ID for V2X service is mapped to the
StationID as specified in ETSI TS 102 894-2 [25]. The VAL UE ID is used to
address the VAL UE in order to send VAL messages or to access SEAL services.
Based on the service agreement, GPSI (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [38]) may
be used as VAL UE identity.
## 7.4 VAL service identity (VAL service ID)
The VAL service ID is a unique identifier that represents the VAL service. A
VAL server provides a list of VAL services towards the VAL users or VAL UE.
Each VAL service is uniquely identified by a VAL service ID, which is an
identifier of the VAL application providing that VAL service. The VAL service
ID can be used for policy mapping, QoS handling for VAL communication and VAL
message distribution. For example, an identifier of a V2X service, e.g. ITS-
AID or PSID specified in ETSI TS 102 965 [26] and ISO TS 17419 [27], can be
used as a V2X service ID.
## 7.5 VAL group identity (VAL group ID)
The VAL group ID is a unique identifier within the VAL service that represents
a set of VAL users or VAL UE according to the VAL service. The set of VAL
users may belong to the same or different VAL service providers. It indicates
the VAL application server where the group is defined.
## 7.6 VAL system identity (VAL system ID)
The VAL system ID is a globally unique identifier representing a VAL system.
## 7.7 VAL Stream ID
> **A VAL Stream ID is an identity used by the VAL server to identify a VAL
> stream.**

### 9.3.3 Event-triggered location reporting procedure
#### 9.3.3.1 General
The location management server provides location reporting configuration to
the location management clients, indicating what information the location
management server expects and what events will trigger the sending of this
information to the location management server. The decision to report location
information can be triggered at the location management client by different
conditions, e.g., the reception of the location reporting configuration,
initial registration, distance travelled, elapsed time, cell change, MBMS SAI
change, MBMS session change, leaving a specific MBMS bearer service area,
tracking area change, PLMN change, call initiation, or other types of events
such as emergency. The location report can include information described as
ECGI, MBMS SAIs, geographic coordinates and other location information.
#### 9.3.3.2 Fetching location reporting configuration
Figure 9.3.3.2-1 illustrates the procedure for fetching location reporting
configuration.
Pre-condition:
\- If multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used is activated
by the location management server.
\- The location management client is aware that the location reporting
configuration is available at the location management server.
Figure 9.3.3.2-1: Fetching location reporting configuration procedure
1\. The location management client sends location reporting configuration
request message to the location management server.
2\. The location management server sends location reporting configuration
message to the location management client(s) containing the initial location
reporting event triggers configuration (or a subsequent update) , e.g. minimum
time between consecutive reports, SAI changes, or ECGI changes for reporting
the location of the VAL UE. This message can be sent over a unicast bearer to
a specific location management client or as a group message over an MBMS
bearer to update the location reporting configuration for multiple location
management clients at the same time.
NOTE 1: The location reporting configuration information can be made part of
the user profile, in which case the sending of the message is not necessary.
NOTE 2: Different location management clients may be given different location
reporting criteria.
3\. The location management client stores or updates the location reporting
event triggers configuration. A location reporting event occurs, triggering
step 3.
#### 9.3.3.3 Location reporting
Figure 9.3.3.3-1 illustrates the procedure for location reporting.
Figure 9.3.3.3-1: Location reporting procedure
1\. The location management client sends a location information report to the
location management server, containing location information identified by the
location management server and available to the location management client.
2\. Upon receiving the report, the location management server updates location
of the reporting location management client. If the location management server
does not have location information of the reporting location management client
before, then just stores the reporting location information for that location
management client.
### 9.3.4 On-demand location reporting procedure
The location management server can request UE location information at any time
by sending a location information request to the location management client,
which may trigger location management client to immediately send the location
report.
Figure 9.3.4-1: On-demand location information reporting procedure
1\. Based on configurations such as periodical location information timer, or
location information request from other entities (e.g., another location
management client, VAL server), location management server initiates the
immediately request location information from the location management client.
2\. The location management server sends a location information request to the
location management client.
3\. VAL user or VAL UE is notified and asked about the permission to share its
location. VAL user can accept or deny the request
4\. The location management client immediately responds to the location
management server with a report containing location information identified by
the location management server and available to the location management
client.
5\. Upon receiving the report, the location management server updates location
of the reporting location management client. If the location management server
does not have location information of the reporting location management client
before, then just stores the reporting location information for that location
management client.
### 9.3.5 Client-triggered or VAL server-triggered location reporting
procedure
Figure 9.3.5-1 illustrates the high level procedure of client-triggered or VAL
server-triggered location reporting.
Figure 9.3.5-1: Client-triggered location reporting procedure
1\. Location management client 2 (authorized VAL user or VAL UE) or VAL server
sends a location reporting trigger to the location management server to
activate a location reporting procedure for obtaining the location information
of location management client 1.
NOTE: Step 1 can be performed when Location management client 2 or VAL server
require to update the location reporting trigger.
2\. Location management server checks whether location management client 2 or
VAL server is authorized to send a location reporting trigger. Depending on
the information specified by the location reporting trigger, location
management server initiates an on-demand location reporting procedure or an
event-triggered location reporting procedure for the location of location
management client 1.
3\. Once the location information of the location management client 1 is
available in the location management server by the on-demand location
reporting procedure, a location information report is sent to the location
management client 2 or VAL server.
### 9.3.6 Location reporting triggers configuration cancel
Figure 9.3.6-1 illustrates the procedure used for cancelling the location
reporting triggers configuration at the target Location management client.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The location management server has subscribed the location management
client 2 location with the location reporting event triggers.
2\. If multicast delivery mode is used, the MBMS bearer being used is
activated by the location management server.
Figure 9.3.6-1: Location reporting triggers configuration cancel
1\. The location management client 1 (authorized VAL user or VAL UE) or VAL
server sends a location reporting configuration cancel request to the location
management server (1a). The location management server sends the location
reporting configuration cancel request to the location management client 2 to
stop receiving the UE location information (1b). This message can be sent via
unicast or multicast.
NOTE: Step 1b can be initiated without step 1a.
2\. The location management client invalidates the location reporting triggers
configuration and no longer reports its location to the location management
server.
3\. The location management client 2 sends the location reporting
configuration cancel response to the location management server (3a) as an
acknowledgement. The location management server sends the location reporting
configuration cancel response to the location management client 1 (3b) as an
acknowledgement.
### 9.3.7 Location information subscription procedure
Figure 9.3.7-1 illustrates the high level procedure of location information
subscription request. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to VAL user
or VAL UE location information. This procedure is also used for intiating
tracking a UE\'s location.
Figure 9.3.7-1: Location information subscription request procedure
1\. The VAL server sends a location information subscription request to the
location management server to subscribe location information of one or more
VAL users or VAL UEs. The request may include an indication for supplementary
location information.
2\. The location management server shall check if the VAL server is authorized
to initiate the location information subscription request. Further, the
location management server may initiate location reporting configuration with
the location management client of the UE for immediate reporting.
3\. The location management server may optionally subscribe for UE location
information from 3GPP core network for the UE. If the indication for
supplementary location information is included in step 1, then UE location
information is obtained from the 3GPP core network.
4\. The location management server determines the UE location information of
the UE as received in steps 3 and 4.
5\. The location management server replies with a location information
subscription response indicating the subscription status and if immediate
reporting was requested, the location information of the VAL UE(s).
### 9.3.8 Event-trigger location information notification procedure
Figure 9.3.8-1 illustrates the high level procedure of event-trigger usage of
location information. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to location
information of VAL user or VAL UE. This procedure is also used for obtaining
latest UE\'s location for tracking purpose.
Figure 9.3.8-1: Event-trigger usage of location information procedure
1\. The location management server receives the latest location information of
the UE as per the location report procedure described in clause 9.3.3.3.
2\. The location management server may optionally receive the location
information of the UE from 3GPP core network. If the indication for
supplementary location information is included in the subscription, then UE
location information is obtained from the 3GPP core network.
3\. Based on the configurations, e.g., subscription, periodical location
information timer, location management server is triggered to report the
latest user location information to VAL server. The location management server
determines the location information of UE as received in steps 1 and 2,
including the supplementary location information (if indicated).
4\. The location management server sends the location information report
including the latest location information of one or more VAL users or VAL UEs
to the VAL server or to the location management client that has previously
configured.
5\. VAL server may further share this location information to a group or to
another VAL user or VAL UE.
NOTE: For other entities, the step 5 can be skipped if not needed.
### 9.3.9 On-demand usage of location information procedure
The VAL server can request UE location information at any time by sending a
location information request to the location management server, which may
trigger location management server to immediately send the location report.
Figure 9.3.9-1 illustrates the high level procedure of on demand usage of
location information. The same procedure can be applied for location
management client and other entities that would like to subscribe to location
information of VAL user or VAL UE.
Figure 9.3.9-1: On-demand usage of location information procedure
1\. VAL server sends a location information request to the location management
server.
2\. The location management server acquires the latest location of the UEs
being requested, by triggering an on-demand location report procedure as
described in subclause 9.3.4, or from PLMN operator.
3\. Then, location management server immediately sends the location
information report including the latest location information acquired of one
or more VAL users or VAL UEs.
4\. VAL server may further share this location information to a group or to
another VAL user or VAL UE.
NOTE: For other entities, the step 3 can be skipped if not needed.
### 9.3.10 Obtaining UE(s) information at a location
Figure 9.3.10-1 describes the procedure for obtaining UE(s) information at a
location.
Pre-condition:
\- The VAL server has a jurisdiction over a geographical area for which the
location management server is configured to operate.
\- The UE(s) in the geographical area have provided its location information
to the location management server.
Figure 9.3.10-1: Obtaining UE(s) information at a location
1\. The VAL server sends get UE information request to the location management
server. The request contains a location information and application defined
proximity range.
2\. The location management server determines the UE(s) whose location are
within the application defined proximity range of the location information
provided in step 1.
3\. The location management server sends get UE information response to the
VAL server with a list of UE(s) and its corresponding location information as
determined in step 1.
### 9.3.11 Monitoring Location Deviation
#### 9.3.11.1 General
The VAL server requests the Location Management Server to monitor the location
of the VAL UE in relation to an area of interest. The LMS fetches the VAL
UE\'s location information periodically from 3GPP core network as specified in
3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and also, using the Location Information procedures
specified in clause 9.3.7 and clause 9.3.10. With the periodic location
information of the UE from 3GPP core network and SEAL procedures, the LMS
server evaluates the current location of the VAL UE in relation to the area of
interest configured by the VAL server. If subscribed, the VAL server is
notified by the LMS server when the VAL UE relationship (e.g. inside or
outside) to the area of interest changes along with current location
information of the VAL UE.
#### 9.3.11.2 Monitoring Location Deviation procedure
Figure 9.3.11.2-1 describes the procedure for monitoring the VAL UE\'s
location in a given area of interest.
Pre-condition:
\- The LMS server authorized to consume the 3GPP core network service
(Monitoring events as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11]).
Figure 9.3.11.2-1: Monitoring VAL UE\'s location at a given location
1\. The VAL server sends Monitor Location Subscription Request to LMS server
including VAL UE Identifier, predetermined area of interest information,
notification interval and notification URI where the VAL server intends to
receive the notifications from LMS server regarding VAL UE\'s presence in a
given area.
\- \"Area of interest\" is the location information, which the VAL server
wishes to monitor the VAL UE\'s location adherence. This parameter can include
an area of interest information and other relevant parameters.
\- \"Notify_Interval\" represents the periodic interval in which the LMS
server needs to notify VAL UE\'s location information to the VAL server. When
the VAL UE moves away from the \" Area of interest\", then the LMS server
ignores the \"Notify_Interval\" and sends the location notification to the VAL
server immediately.
2\. LMS processes the Area of interest information in the request, and then
subscribes to UE location monitoring as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] with
appropriate parameters mapping. Based on the subscription, the LMS receives
the VAL UE location information periodically from the 3GPP core network.
Editor\'s note: How the LMS\'s processing of Area of Interest information and
the subscription of UE location monitoring based on Area of Interest are
related with procedures in 3GPP TS 23.502 and 3GPP TS 23.256 are FFS.
3\. LMS shall use the Location information procedures as specified in clause
9.3.7 and clause 9.3.10, to periodically obtain the VAL UE location
information. Based on the geographic information from the VAL server, the LMS
server may determine to additionally include the positioning methods in SEAL
LMS procedures to obtain location information.
4\. LMS server, after successful subscription according to steps 2 and 3,
sends Monitor Location Subscription response, indicating that the LMS server
accepts VAL server\'s request and will monitor the location of the VAL UE to
verify if the VAL UE is in the area of interest.
5a and 5b. LMS server processes the location information received from SEAL
Location Information procedures and the core network, and validates the
information. If the location information is matching, then the LMS shall check
if the VAL UE\'s current location is within the area of interest received in
step 1. The LMS will continue with step 6, step 7 and step 8 as applicable.
6\. If the location information received from Location management client and
the core network do not match, then the LMS server shall consider the VAL UE
as outside from its specified area of interest and shall notify (\"Notify
Mismatch Location\" message) the VAL server of the same, including VAL UE ID
and the location information from LMS and the core network in the notification
message.

# 10 Group management
## 10.1 General
The group management is a SEAL service that offers the group management
related capabilities to one or more vertical applications.
## 10.2 Functional model for group management
### 10.2.1 General
The functional model for the group management is based on the generic
functional model specified in clause 6. It is organized into functional
entities to describe a functional architecture which addresses the support for
group management aspects for vertical applications. The on-network and off-
network functional model is specified in this clause.
### 10.2.2 On-network functional model description
Figure 10.2.2-1 illustrates the generic on-network functional model for group
management.
Figure 10.2.2-1: On-network functional model for group management
The group management client communicates with the group management server over
the GM-UU reference point. The group management client provides the support
for group management functions to the VAL client(s) over GMâ€‘C reference point.
The VAL server(s) communicate with the group management server over the GM-S
reference point.
The group management server interacts with the NEF of the underlying 3GPP
network system via N33 reference point to perform group management procedures
for 5G Virtual Network (5GVN) groups.
### 10.2.3 Off-network functional model description
Figure 10.2.3-1 illustrates the off-network functional model for group
management.
Figure 10.2.3-1: Off-network functional model for group management
The group management client of the UE1 communicates with the group management
client of the UE2 over the GMâ€‘PC5 reference point.
### 10.2.4 Functional entities description
#### 10.2.4.1 General
The functional entities for group management SEAL service are described in the
following subclauses.
#### 10.2.4.2 Group management client
The group management client functional entity acts as the application client
for management of groups. A VAL system maintains groups corresponding to one
or more vertical applications. The group management client interacts with the
group management server. The group management client also supports
interactions with the corresponding group management client between the two
UEs.
The group management client functional entity is supported by the signalling
user agent and HTTP client functional entities of the signalling control
plane.
#### 10.2.4.3 Group management server
The group management server functional entity provides for management of
groups supported within the vertical application layer. The group management
server acts as CAPIF\'s API exposing function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222
[8]. The group management server also supports interactions with the
corresponding group management server in distributed SEAL deployments.
The group management server functional entity is supported by the SIP AS and
HTTP server functional entities of the signalling control plane.
All the group management clients supporting users belonging to a single group
are required to use the same group management server for that group. A group
management client supporting a user involved in multiple groups can have
relationships with multiple group management servers.
### 10.2.5 Reference points description
#### 10.2.5.1 General
The reference points for the functional model for group management are
described in the following subclauses.
#### 10.2.5.2 GM-UU
The interactions related to group management functions between the group
management client and the group management server are supported by GM-UU
reference point. This reference point utilizes Uu reference point as described
in 3GPP TS 23.401 [9] and 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
GM-UU reference point is used for VAL service signalling for VAL service data
management of the VAL service. The GM-UU reference point supports:
\- Configuration of group related data at the group management client by the
group management server; and
\- Configuration of group related data at the group management server by the
group management client.
The GM-UU reference point uses the HTTP-1/HTTP-2 reference points for
transport and routing of group management related signalling. The GM-UU
reference point uses the SIP-1/SIP-2 reference points for
subscription/notification related signalling.
#### 10.2.5.3 GM-PC5
The interactions related to group management functions between the group
management clients located in different VAL UEs are supported by GM-PC5
reference point. This reference point utilizes PC5 reference point as
described in 3GPP TS 23.303 [12].
#### 10.2.5.4 GM-C
The interactions related to group management functions between the VAL
client(s) and the group management client within a VAL UE are supported by
GM-C reference point.
#### 10.2.5.5 GM-S
The interactions related to group management functions between the VAL
server(s) and the group management server are supported by GM-S reference
point. This reference point is an instance of CAPIF-2 reference point as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [8].
GM-S reference point supports the VAL server to obtain group information
corresponding to the VAL service. The GM-S reference point uses HTTP-1/HTTP-2
reference points for transport and routing of group management related
signalling. The GM-S reference point uses SIP-2 reference point for
subscription/notification related signalling.
#### 10.2.5.6 GM-E
The interactions related to group management functions between the group
management servers in a distributed deployment are supported by GM-E reference
point.
Editor\'s Note: The functions enabled over GM-E reference point is FFS.
#### 10.2.5.7 N33
For group management procedures pertaining to a 5GVN group the group
management server interacts with the NEF of the underlying 3GPP network using
the dynamic 5G Virtual Network group management procedures exposed by the NEF
via the N33 reference point, as specified in TS 23.501 [10] and in TS 23.502
[11].
## 10.3 Procedures and information flows for group management
### 10.3.1 General
Group management procedures apply to on-network VAL service only.
Group creation provides a dedicated VAL group to individual VAL users to
enable the required communication for one or multiple VAL services. This
includes the normal group creation by administrators or by authorized user/UE.
The group management server supports the external group identifier within the
VAL group document to enable the SEAL servers to consume the NEF services for
the member UEs of the VAL group.
NOTE: If an authorized VAL user/UE wants to participate in a new group created
by the authorized VAL user/UE, then the authorized VAL user/UE needs to have
been included in the new group as a member.
### 10.3.2 Information flows for group management
#### 10.3.2.1 Group creation request
Table 10.3.2.1-1 describes the information flow group creation request from

response to the group management client or the VAL server.
### 10.3.8 Group announcement and join
#### 10.3.8.1 General
This subclause describes the procedures for establishing group communication
from the group management server to the group management clients.
#### 10.3.8.2 Procedure
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management client, group management server, VAL server and the
VAL clients belong to the same VAL system.
2\. The VAL server is aware of the users\' identities and is authorized to
form a VAL group.
Figure 10.3.8.2-1: Procedure for establishing VAL group communication between
the group management server and group management client1.
1\. The VAL server determines group information and the identity list to which
the group announcement shall be sent. The decision can be based on the list of
authorized UEs and other criteria (e.g. user consent, service, or vehicle
driving profile).
2\. The VAL server configures VAL group for Uu communication defined by VAL
Group ID for one or more VAL services with list of VAL Service ID with the
group management server.
3\. The group management server creates an empty group based on the
information provided in the Configure VAL group request. The group management
server stores the mapping between the VAL group ID and the external Group Id
in the VAL group document, along with a list of GPSIs corresponding to the
identity list provided by the VAL server. The group management server also
determines whether the group is for 5G LAN-Type communication and whether
Ethernet or IP (IPv4 and/or IPv6) transport shall be used for the 5G LAN-Type
communication.
4\. If 5G LAN-Type communication is to be used, the group management server
creates a 5GVN group in the 5GS via N33 using the create group procedure
specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10] clause 5.29.2 and 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause
4.15.6. The group management server creates the 5GVN group data and the 5GVN
group membership data defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] clause 4.15.6.3b to be
configured in the 5GS. To create the 5GVN group data the group management
server uses the 5G LAN-Type communication type information provided by the VAL
server to set the PDU session type (Ethernet or IP) and maps the VAL service
IDs to Application descriptors. To create the 5GVN group membership data the
group management server maps the VAL group ID to the External Group ID and
makes a list of GPSIs corresponding to the identity list provided by the VAL
server.
NOTE 1: This step is skipped for the case that a 5G LAN-Type communication is
not being used.
NOTE 2: The PDU session type, DNN, S-NSSAI provided within 5GVN group data
cannot be modified in the 5GS after the create procedure.
NOTE 3: The 5GS supports only a 1:1 mapping between DNN/S-NSSAI combination
and 5GVN group.
NOTE 4: The group management server maintains a mapping between DNN and
S-NSSAI of the 5GVN group and the VAL server requester identity based on
operator policy. How such mapping is configured is implementation specific and
out of the scope of this specification.
5\. The group management server announces the VAL group to the group
management clients. For a 5GVN group the announcement includes the
communication type (IP or Ethernet), DNN, and S-NSSAI corresponding to the
5GVN group.
6\. The group management client registers to VAL group communication using the
VAL Group ID.
7\. The group management server records the users who have registered to be
the members of the group.
8\. The group management server sends a VAL group registration response to the
group management client.
9\. The group management server sends a configure VAL group response to the
VAL server.
NOTE 5: Step 9 may occur any time after step 5.
10\. The group management server sends identity list notification about the
newly registered users to the other members of the group and VAL server, whose
subscription to receive notifications of newly registered VAL UE IDs is
successful in step 8 and step 9 respectively.
11\. The group management client may inform VAL client about the updated
identity list.
### 10.3.9 Group member leave
#### 10.3.9.1 General
This subclause describes the procedures for group member to leave the group by
de-registering.
#### 10.3.9.2 Procedure
Pre-conditions:
1\. Group is previously defined on the group management server including the
list of registered users and each member of the group and VAL server is aware
of it.
Figure 10.3.9.2-1: Procedure for group member leaving the group.
1\. The VAL client determines to de-register member from the group and group
management client is aware of it.
2\. The group management client initiates the group de-registration request
towards the group management server.
3\. The group management server checks the authorization of group de-
registration request and updates the group member list.
4\. The group management server sends a group de-registration response to the
group management client.
5\. The group management server sends identity list notification about the
leaving registered user to the other members of the group and the VAL server,
whose subscription to receive notifications of de-registered VAL UE IDs is
successful in step 7 and step 8 of the procedure in clause 10.3.8.2
respectively.
### 10.3.10 Temporary groups
#### 10.3.10.1 Temporary group formation within a VAL system
Figure 10.3.10.1-1 below illustrates the temporary group formation within a
VAL system.
Temporary groups are formed by combining two or more groups. The temporary
group formation is applicable only for groups configured with at least one
common VAL service. The temporary group formation shall be rejected if any of
the requested VAL services are not common to all the constituent VAL service
groups.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The group management client, group management server, VAL server and the
VAL group members belong to the same VAL system.
2\. The group management client has retrieved the group configurations of the
groups.
3\. The VAL server has subscribed to receive group management event
notifications.
Figure 10.3.10.1-1: Temporary group formation within a VAL system
1\. The group management client of the VAL user requests temporary group
formation operation to the group management server, which is the group
management server of one of the groups to be regrouped. The identities of the
groups being combined shall be included in this message. The group management
client may indicate the security level required for the temporary group. The
group management client may indicate the priority level required for the
temporary group.
2\. The group management server checks whether temporary group formation
operation is performed by an authorized VAL user, based on group policy. The
group management server checks whether group1 or group2 is a temporary group.
If group 1 or group2 is a temporary group, then the group regrouping will be
rejected, otherwise the group regrouping can proceed.
3\. The group management server creates and stores the information of the
temporary group, including the temporary VAL group ID, the VAL group ID of the
groups being combined, the priority level of the temporary group and the
security level of the temporary group. If the authorized VAL user does not
specify the security level and the priority level, the group management server
shall set the lowest security level and the highest priority of the
constituent groups. If VAL service types of the groups being combined are not
identical, group management server determines the overlapping part and stores
the VAL service list for the temporary group.
4\. The group management server notifies the VAL server regarding the
temporary group creation with the information of the constituent groups, i.e.
temporary VAL group ID, group1\'s VAL group ID and group2\'s VAL group ID. If
VAL service list is included, VAL server stores it and provides VAL service
types accordingly.
5\. The group management server notifies the VAL group members of the
constituent VAL groups by sending temporary group formation notification
messages.
6\. The VAL group members of the constituent VAL groups send individual
temporary group formation notification response messages.
7\. The group management server provides a temporary group formation response
to the group management client of the authorized VAL user. If VAL service list
is included, group management client stores it and initiates VAL service types
accordingly.
8\. The VAL group members of the constituent VAL groups individually request
group configuration data from the group management server for the temporary
group. The group configuration data includes security, priority, and other
parameters.

registration phase.
Figure 12.3.3.2-1: VAL user authentication and registration with Primary VAL
system, single domain
1\. In this step the identity management client begins the user authorization
procedure. The VAL user supplies the user credentials (e.g. biometrics,
secureID, username/password) for verification with the identity management
server. This step may occur before or after step 3. In a VAL system with
multiple VAL services, a single user authentication as in step 1 can be used
for multiple VAL service authorizations for the user.
2\. The signalling user agent establishes a secure connection to the SIP core
for the purpose of SIP level authentication and registration.
3\. The signalling user agent completes the SIP level registration with the
SIP core (and an optional third-party registration with the VAL service
server(s)).
NOTE 1: The VAL client(s) perform the corresponding VAL service authorization
for the user by utilizing the result of this procedure.
NOTE 2: Steps 2 and 3 are not required to be performed if the VAL service does
not use SIP.

# 14 Network resource management
## 14.1 General
The network resource management is a SEAL service that offers the network
resource management (e.g. unicast and multicast network resources) and
monitoring related capabilities to one or more vertical applications.
## 14.2 Functional model for network resource management
### 14.2.1 General
The functional model for the network resource management is based on the
generic functional model specified in clause 6. It is organized into
functional entities to describe a functional architecture which addresses the
support for network resource management aspects for vertical applications. The
on-network and off-network functional model is specified in this clause.
### 14.2.2 On-network functional model description
#### 14.2.2.1 Generic on-network functional model for network resource
management
Figure 14.2.2-1 illustrates the generic on-network functional model for
network resource management.
Figure 14.2.2.1-1: On-network functional model for network resource management
The network resource management client communicates with the network resource
management server over the NRM-UU reference point. The network resource
management client provides the support for network resource management
functions to the VAL client(s) over NRMâ€‘C reference point. The VAL server(s)
communicate with the network resource management server over the NRM-S
reference point.
The network resource management server communicates with the BM-SC via MB2-C
and xMB-C reference points to obtain and control the multicast resources from
the underlying 3GPP network system. The network resource management server
communicates with the PCRF via Rx reference point or communicates with the PCF
via N5 reference point to control the unicast resources from the underlying
3GPP network system. The network resource management server communicates with
the SCEF via T8 reference point or communicates with the NEF via N33 reference
point to perform event monitoring procedures from the underlying 3GPP network
system. The network resource management server interacts with NEF via N33 to
obtain QoS monitoring information from the 5GS.
#### 14.2.2.2 On-network functional model for network resource management for
TSN
The architecture for integration of the 5G with TSN [36] is depicted in Figure
14.2.2.2-1. The SEAL Network Resource Management (NRM) server acts as a TSN AF
(defined in [10] in clause 5.28.1). TSN CNC (defined in [35]) via the NRM-S
reference point configures the TSN flows in the 5GS. In this case the NRM-S
supports the IEEE 802.1Qcc management protocol. As a TSN AF the SEAL NRM
server interacts with the 5GS PCF over the N5 reference point to configure the
5G QoS and TSCAI parameters in the 5GS.
Figure 14.2.2.2-1: On-network functional model for network resource management
for TSN
NOTE: Whether DS-TT and UE are combined or are separate is up to
implementation.
Acting as the TSN AF the NRM server collects 5GS TSN Bridge information by
interaction with the 5GS via the N5 reference point, as described in in TS
23.502 [11] Annex F.1.
NRM server triggers via N5 the AF request procedure as described in 3GPP TS
23.502 [11] Annex F.2.
#### 14.2.2.3 On-network functional model for network resource management for
5G TSC
5G TSC refers to time sensitive communication service offered within the 5G
system (i.e. without integration with a TSN system) by the 5GS for the UEs
connected to the 5GS. The architecture for the 5G TSC is depicted in Figure
14.2.2.3-1. The SEAL NRM server acts as an AF towards the 5G Core Network and
performs coordination of QoS flows to fulfill the end-to-end QoS requirements
for the UEs involved in the TSC communication. It combines the roles of TSCTSF
and TSC CNC (similar to the TSN CNC in the TSN integration case), which means
that it controls the allocation of resources of TSC communication within the
boundaries of the 5G domain.
Upon request from a VAL server via the NRM-S reference point it configures the
TSC end-to-end QoS flows in the 5GS. In line with other SEAL service enablers
the SEAL NRM server provides a RESTful interface on the NRM-S reference point.
As a TSCTSF the SEAL NRM server interacts with the 5GS PCF over the N5
reference point to configure the 5G QoS and TSCAI parameters in the 5GS.
Figure 14.2.2.3-1: On-network functional model for network resource management
for 5G TSC
### 14.2.3 Off-network functional model description
Figure 14.2.3-1 illustrates the off-network functional model for network
resource management.
Figure 14.2.3-1: Off-network functional model for network resource management
The network resource management client of the UE1 communicates with the
network resource management client of the UE2 over the NRMâ€‘PC5 reference
point.

management of 3GPP system network resources (e.g. unicast, multicast) and
monitoring events to support the VAL applications. The network resource
management server acts as CAPIF\'s API exposing function as specified in 3GPP
TS 23.222 [8]. The network resource management server also supports
interactions with the corresponding network resource management server in
distributed SEAL deployments. The NRM server\'s role may be assumed by the VAL
server in some deployments, in which case, the VAL server performs the
procedures for network resource management of the NRM server.

### 14.3.3 Unicast resource management
#### 14.3.3.1 General
The following subclauses specify the procedures for unicast resource
management for vertical application layer. The NRM server sets up bearers and
may need to modify the bearers for an already established VAL service
communication.
Characteristics that may need to be modified include:
\- activation and deactivation of the bearer;
\- modification of the QoS characteristics of the bearer (e.g. bearer priority
adjustment); and
\- modification of GBR due to application requirement
NOTE: A VAL service communication can consist of both unicast and multicast
bearers which can all need modification due to the same event.
Vertical application layer specific pre-requisites and resultant behaviour by
functional entities in performing these procedures are specified in the
respective vertical application layer TS (e.g. for V2X application layer, see
3GPP TS 23.286 [7]).
Unicast resource management is supported with PCC interactions with SIP core
and PCC interactions with NRM server. The PCC procedures for EPS are specified
in 3GPP TS 23.203 [18] and the PCC procedures for 5GS are specified in 3GPP TS
23.503 [19].
#### 14.3.3.2 Unicast resource management with SIP core
##### 14.3.3.2.1 Request for unicast resources at VAL service communication
establishment
###### 14.3.3.2.1.1 General
The procedure defined in this subclause specifies how network resources are
requested at VAL service communication establishment. If concurrent sessions
are used the NRM server may utilize the capability of resource sharing
specified for underlying network policy and charging functions. The request
for resources includes application type, bandwidth, priority, application
identifier and resource sharing information.
###### 14.3.3.2.1.2 Procedure
The procedure is generic to any type of session establishment that requires
requests for network resources.
Procedures in figure 14.3.3.2.1.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the
requesting resource at session establishment.
Pre-condition:
\- The VAL client has requested VAL service communication with the VAL server.
Figure 14.3.3.2.1.2-1: Resource request at VAL service communication
establishment
1\. The VAL server sends request for resources to the NRM server.
2\. The NRM server evaluates the need for network resources and use of
resource sharing.
3\. The NRM server sends a session progress request containing request for
resources.
4\. PCC procedures are initiated from SIP core local inbound/outbound proxy.
5\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy sends a OK message to the NRM
server.
6\. The NRM server sends a resource response to the VAL server.
7\. The VAL service communication is established, and resources have been
allocated.
##### 14.3.3.2.2 Request for modification of unicast resources
###### 14.3.3.2.2.1 General
To modify unicast bearers, the NRM server shall send a resource modification
request containing the parameters to be modified for the UE.
Possible scenarios when this procedure may be used are:
> \- Modify the allocation and retention priority for unicast resources;
>
> \- Release and resume resources in-between VAL service communications; or
>
> \- Release and resume resources when a UE is able to receive the VAL service
> communications over multicast transmission
###### 14.3.3.2.2.2 Procedure
Procedures in figure 14.3.3.2.2.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the
modification of a unicast:
Pre-condition:
\- A VAL service communication is already in progress;
Figure 14.3.3.2.2.2-1: Bearer modification request
1\. The VAL server sends a resource modification request to the NRM server.
2a. The NRM server decides to modify the parameters of a unicast bearer.
2b. If the media bearer modification is not required, the NRM server sends a
resource modification response to the VAL server.
3\. The NRM server sends a session update which includes a resource
modification request containing the modified parameters of the unicast bearer.
4\. PCC procedures are initiated from SIP core local inbound/outbound proxy.
5\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy sends a OK message to the NRM
server.
6\. The NRM server sends a resource modification response to the VAL server.
7\. The VAL service communication continues with the modified unicast
resources.
NOTE 1: If the VAL service communication is transferred to multicast
transmission, the unicast resources could be temporarily be released.
NOTE 2: If multiple VAL service communication streams are sent to the UE,
additional bearer resources could be required during an established VAL
service communication. Pre-allocation of additional bearer resources already
at VAL service communication establishment could be useful.

Figure 14.3.3.3.1.2-1 illustrates the procedure for the network resource
adaptation.
Figure 14.3.3.3.1.2-1: Network resource adaptation
1\. The VAL server sends a network resource adaptation request to the NRM
server for one or more users belonging to one or more VAL services, and may
comprise one or more VAL UEs that will have updated resource requirement. This
requirement may be in the form of exact resources /resource pools to be used
or indication of bandwidth increase/decrease for the corresponding VAL UEs or
set of VAL UEs.
2\. The NRM server processes the request and applies / enforces the resource
adaptation per VAL UE.
3\. The NRM server retrieves UE IP address by using event monitoring
capability for PDU session status (or PDN connectivity status) and initiates
the PCC procedures for each VAL UE.
4\. The NRM server provides a network resource adaptation response to the VAL
server, providing information on the fulfilment of the network resource
adaptation request. This will include information either per VAL UE or per set
of VAL UEs, as indicated by the request of the VAL server in step 1.

#### 14.3.3.4 Unicast QoS monitoring
##### 14.3.3.4.1 Unicast QoS monitoring subscription procedure
###### 14.3.3.4.1.1 General
This subclause describes the high level procedure for unicast QoS monitoring
subscription. This procedure satisfies the requirements for monitoring of
unicast QoS for already allocated unicast resources to VAL communications.
###### 14.3.3.4.1.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.3.4.1.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure for unicast QoS
monitoring subscription.
Pre-conditions:
\- The VAL UE has an established connection in the 5GS
Figure 14.3.3.4.1.2-1: Unicast QoS monitoring subscription
1\. The VAL server sends a unicast QoS monitoring subscription request to the
NRM server either in conjunction with a request for unicast network resources
requiring QoS or when the unicast QoS connection is already established. The
NRM server checks if the VAL server is authorized to initiate the unicast QoS
monitoring request for the requested target VAL UEs, VAL group ID, or VAL
stream IDs.
NOTE: It is left for stage 3 to decide whether to combine the QoS monitoring
subscription request with the request for unicast resources.
2\. The NRM server interacts with the NEF to establish relevant QoS monitoring
subscriptions. The NRM server uses the NEF procedures for the AFsessionWithQoS
described in clause 5.2.6.9 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and the NEF procedures for
the AnalyticsExposure described in clause 5.2.6.16 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and
in particular the UE Communication Analytics described in clause 6.7.3 of 3GPP
TS 23.288 [34] and DN Performance Analytics described in clause 6.14 of 3GPP
TS 23.288 [34]. Based on the input received from the VAL server in step 1, the
NRM server determines the relevant NEF subscription procedures and the
parameters for these subscriptions, such as the QoS parameters to be measured
(e.g. packet delay, data rate, traffic volume), the frequency of reporting
etc. For the frequency of reporting which can be event triggered, periodic, or
when the PDU Session is released, the NRM server determines the following:
a) if the reporting frequency is event triggered:
> i) the corresponding reporting threshold to each QoS parameter;
>
> ii) minimum waiting time between subsequent reports;
b) if the reporting frequency is periodic, the reporting period.
3\. The NRM server responds with a unicast QoS monitoring subscription
response indicating the subscription status.

###### 14.3.3.4.2.1 General
This subclause describes the high level procedure for unicast QoS monitoring
notification.
###### 14.3.3.4.2.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.3.4.2.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure of unicast QoS
monitoring notification event.
Pre-conditions:
\- The VAL server has an active unicast QoS monitoring subscription with the
NRM server
Figure 14.3.3.4.2.2-1: Unicast QoS monitoring notification procedure
1\. The NRM server receives QoS monitoring data by means of notifications
provided by the NEF. The NRM server coordinates and combines the information
from the NEF notifications and determines whether to send a notification to
the VAL server based on the VAL server subscription\'s frequency of reporting.
For a VAL group or a list of VAL UEs, the NRM server aggregates QoS monitoring
data for each UE belonging to the group or the list; for a VAL stream, the NRM
server aggregates the QoS monitoring data for the stream. The NRM server
stores the QoS monitoring data as needed for later retrieval.
2\. The NRM server sends a unicast QoS monitoring notification including the
measured QoS data to the VAL server. If the reporting termination criteria is
met (e.g. number of reports reached, threshold reached), NRM server shall also
terminate the subscription.
##### 14.3.3.4.3 Unicast QoS monitoring subscription termination procedure

This subclause describes the high level procedure for unicast QoS monitoring
subscription termination.
###### 14.3.3.4.3.2 Procedure

monitoring subscription termination.
Pre-conditions:
\- The VAL server has an active unicast QoS monitoring subscription with the
NRM server
Figure 14.3.3.4.3.2-1: Unicast QoS monitoring subscription termination

1\. When the VAL server decides to terminate a unicast QoS monitoring
subscription, it sends a QoS monitoring unsubscribe request to the NRM server.
2\. The NRM server interacts with the NEF to terminate the related QoS
monitoring subscriptions.
3\. The NRM server sends a QoS monitoring unsubscribe response to the VAL
server.
##### 14.3.3.4.4 Unicast QoS monitoring data retrieval procedure
###### 14.3.3.4.4.1 General
This subclause describes the high level procedure for unicast QoS monitoring
data retrieval.
###### 14.3.3.4.4.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.3.4.4.2-1 illustrates the high level procedure of unicast QoS
monitoring data retrieval.
Figure 14.3.3.4.4.2-1: Retrieval of unicast QoS monitoring data
1\. The VAL server sends a unicast QoS monitoring data request to the NRM
server specifying the details of the requested data and the time period of
interest. The NRM server checks if the VAL server is authorized to initiate
the unicast QoS monitoring data request for the requested target VAL UEs, VAL
group ID, or VAL stream IDs.
2\. The NRM server determines if it has the requested data stored internally
or whether it needs to interact with the NEF to fetch the data using the
AnalyticsExposure described in clause 5.2.6.16 of 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and in
particular the UE Communication Analytics described in clause 6.7.3 of 3GPP TS
23.288 [34] and DN Performance Analytics described in clause 6.14 of 3GPP TS
23.288 [34]. The NRM server collects and processes the collected data to match
the measurement data requirement provided in the VAL server request.
3\. The NRM server responds with a unicast QoS monitoring data response with
the requested data or with a failure indication, and optionally the cause of
the failure, in case the requested data is not available.
### 14.3.4 Multicast resource management for EPS
#### 14.3.4.1 General
The VAL server utilizes the NRM server for multicast resource management.
To activate the multicast bearers in the EPS, the NRM server shall use the
Activate MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16] with the NRM
server performing the GCS AS function.
To deactivate the multicast bearers in the EPS, the NRM server shall use the
Deactivate MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16] with the NRM
server performing the GCS AS function.
To modify multicast bearers in the EPS, the NRM server shall use the Modify
MBMS Bearer procedure specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16] with the NRM server
performing the GCS AS function.
Editor\'s note: To support other modes of MBMS is FFS.
#### 14.3.4.2 Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
##### 14.3.4.2.1 General
In this scenario, upon triggered by VAL server, the NRM server pre-establishes
MBMS bearer(s) in certain pre-configured areas before the initiation of the
VAL service group communication session. When a user originates a request for
a VAL service group communication session for one of these areas, the pre-
established MBMS bearer(s) is used for the DL VAL service communication.
The following steps need to be performed prior to the start of the VAL service
group communication session over pre-established MBMS bearer:
\- Pre-establish MBMS bearer(s)
\- Announce the pre-established MBMS bearer to the NRM clients
When these preparation steps have been done the VAL service group
communication session using MBMS bearer can start.
The vertical application level communications are sent on the MBMS bearer.
Optionally a separate MBMS bearer could be used for the application level
control messages, due to different bearer characteristic requirements.
##### 14.3.4.2.2 Procedure
The procedure figure 14.3.4.2.2-1 shows only one of the receiving VAL clients
using an MBMS bearer. There might also be VAL clients in the same VAL service
group communication session that receive the communication on unicast bearers.
Figure 14.3.4.2.2-1: Use of pre-established MBMS bearers
1\. The VAL server sends a MBMS bearers request to the NRM server including
service description(s) for which the MBMS bearers are requested.
2a. The NRM server determines to activate MBMS bearer. The activation of the
MBMS bearer in EPS is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP
TS 23.468 [16]. This bearer will be used for the VAL service communication.
**_If local MBMS is requested in step 1, the NRM server uses the local MBMS
information provided by VAL server in step 1 or the local MBMS information
configured locally in the NRM server to activate the MBMS bearers. The NRM
server performs local MBMS procedures in line with the procedure of L.MBMS
based MBMS data delivery defined in 3GPP TS 23.285 [31]._**
2b. Optionally, the NRM server may also activate an MBMS bearer dedicated for
application level control signalling. The activation of the MBMS bearer is
done on MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [16]. **_If
local MBMS is requested in step 1, the NRM server uses the local MBMS
information provided by VAL server in step 1 or the local MBMS information
configured locally in the NRM server to activate the MBMS bearers. The NRM
server performs local MBMS procedures in line with the procedure of L.MBMS
based MBMS data delivery defined in 3GPP TS 23.285 [31]._**
NOTE 1: The procedure to determine the activation of MBMS bearers is
implementation specific.
3a. The NRM server passes the MBMS bearer info for the service description
associated with the pre-established MBMS bearer to the NRM client. The NRM
client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service
description.
3b. The NRM server may pass the MBMS bearer info for the service description
associated with the application control MBMS bearer to the NRM client. The NRM
client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBMS bearer, from the service
description.
NOTE 2: Step 3a and step 3b can be done in one MBMS bearer announcement
message.
4\. The NRM client stores the information associated with the TMGI(s). The NRM
service client uses the TMGI and other MBMS bearer related information to
activate the monitoring of the MBMS bearer by the VAL UE. The NRM client
shares the MBMS bearer related information with the VAL client.
5\. The NRM client that enters or is in the service area of at least one
announced TMGI indicates to the NRM server that the VAL UE is able to receive
VAL service communication over MBMS, whereby the NRM server may decide to use
the MBMS bearer instead of unicast bearer for VAL service communication
sessions based on available information at the NRM server including the MBMS
listening status report as described in clause 14.3.4.5.
NOTE 3: Step 5 is optional for the VAL UE on subsequent MBMS bearer
announcements.
6\. The NRM server provides a MBMS bearers response to the VAL server.
7\. A VAL service group communication session is established.
8\. As the VAL server transmits the VAL service communication over the MBMS
bearer, the VAL service communication packets are detected and delivered to
the VAL client.
#### 14.3.4.3 Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
##### 14.3.4.3.1 General
In this scenario, the VAL server uses a unicast bearer for communication with
the UE on the DL at the start of the group communication session. When the VAL
server triggers to use an MBMS bearer in EPS for the DL VAL service
communication, the NRM server decides to establish an MBMS bearer in EPS using
the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [16]. The NRM server provides MBMS
service description information associated with MBMS bearer(s), obtained from
the BM-SC, to the UE. The UE starts using the MBMS bearer(s) to receive DL VAL
service and stops using the unicast bearer for the DL VAL service
communication.
##### 14.3.4.3.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.4.3.2-1 illustrates the use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment.
Figure 14.3.4.3.2-1: Use of dynamic MBMS bearer establishment
1\. A VAL service group communication session is established.
2\. The downlink data is sent by unicast delivery.
3\. The VAL server sends MBMS bearers request to the NRM server.
4\. The NRM server establishes the MBMS bearer(s) for the VAL service group
communication session according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.468
[16]. Service description associated with the MBMS bearer(s) is returned from
the BM-SC. **_If local MBMS is requested in step 3, the NRM server uses the
local MBMS information provided by VAL server in step 3 or the local MBMS
information configured locally in the NRM server to activate the MBMS bearers.
The NRM server performs local MBMS procedures in line with the procedure of
L.MBMS based MBMS data delivery defined in 3GPP TS 23.285 [31]._**
5\. The NRM server provides service description information associated with
the MBMS bearer to the UE. The VAL UE obtains the TMGI from the announcement
message. This message may be sent on an application level control signalling
bearer.
6\. The VAL UE starts monitoring data over MBMS associated with the TMGI,
while in the service area associated with the TMGI.
7\. The VAL UE detects that it is able to receive data over MBMS associated
with the TMGI.
8\. The NRM client notifies the NRM server the MBMS listening status
associated to the monitored TMGI, (e.g. that it is successfully receiving the
TMGI). The NRM client may also notify the MBMS reception quality level of the
TMGI. The NRM server may decide to use the MBMS bearer instead of unicast
bearer for VAL service communication sessions based on available information
at the NRM server including the MBMS listening status report as described in
clause 14.3.4.5.
9\. The NRM server provides an MBMS bearer response to the VAL server with the
dynamic MBMS bearer(s) information. The VAL server stops sending VAL service
communication data over unicast way to the VAL client.
NOTE: The MBMS reception quality level may be used by the NRM server to make
an efficient decision to switch again to a unicast transmission or to take
measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality level indicates that
the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or reaching an
insufficient quality level for the reception of VAL services).
10\. A VAL service group communication session via dynamic MBMS bearer(s) is
established.
11\. The VAL server sends the downlink VAL service communication for the VAL
service group communication session over the MBMS.
#### 14.3.4.4 MBMS bearer announcement over MBMS bearer
##### 14.3.4.4.1 General
The MBMS announcement may be done on either a unicast bearer or a MBMS bearer.
Using a unicast bearer for MBMS bearer announcement provides an interactive
way of doing announcement. The NRM server will send the MBMS bearer
announcement message to the NRM client regardless if there is an MBMS bearer
active or the VAL client can receive the data on the MBMS bearer with
sufficient quality. The benefit of the existing procedure is that it gives a
secure way to inform the NRM client about the MBMS bearer and how to retrieve
the data on the MBMS bearer.
When there is more than one MBMS bearer active in the same service area for
VAL service, there are not the same reasons to use unicast bearer for
additional MBMS bearer announcement. Instead a MBMS bearer for application
level control signalling can be used to announce additional MBMS bearers.
The MBMS bearer announcement messages are sent on an MBMS bearer used for
application control messages. This bearer will have a different QoS setting
compared to an MBMS bearer used for VAL service communication, since
application signalling messages are more sensitive to packet loss.
##### 14.3.4.4.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.4.4.2-1 illustrates a procedure that enables the NRM server to
announce a new MBMS bearer.
Pre-conditions:
1\. An MBMS bearer used for VAL service application control messages must have
been pre-established and announced to the NRM client.
2\. Additional MBMS bearer information may have already been announced to the
NRM client.
Figure 14.3.4.4.2-1: MBMS bearer announcement over an MBMS bearer used for
application control messages
1\. The NRM client monitors an MBMS bearer that is used for VAL service
application signalling messages, such as bearer announcement messages.
2\. The NRM server activates a new MBMS bearer.
3\. The NRM server announces the MBMS bearer to the NRM client. The bearer may
have just been activated or may have already been running for some time. The
step may be repeated as needed.
4\. The NRM server sends a MBMS bearer announcement on the MBMS bearer used
for VAL application control messages. The MBMS bearer announcement contains
the identity of the MBMS bearer (i.e. the TMGI) and may optionally include
additional information about the newly announced bearer. Required and optional
MBMS bearer announcement details may have already been provided. In this case
the MBMS bearer identity could be used as a key for such MBMS bearer details.
5\. The NRM client start to monitor the newly announced MBMS bearer.
6\. If requested by the NRM server, the NRM client sends an acknowledgement of
the MBMS bearer to the NRM server.
7\. The NRM server de-announce the MBMS bearer.
8\. The NRM server sends a MBMS bearer de-announcement message that contains
the identity of the MBMS bearer.
9\. The NRM client stops monitoring the de-announced MBMS bearer.
The same procedure can also be used to modify existing MBMS bearer
announcement information. Example of such modification could be addition of
UDP ports or modification of codec in the SDP.
#### 14.3.4.5 MBMS bearer quality detection
##### 14.3.4.5.1 General
The NRM client and NRM server use this procedure to report and take action on
the MBMS bearer quality towards VAL service communications. A NRM client
monitors an MBMS bearer to enable receiving VAL service communication. Based
on the received quality (e.g. radio level quality, transport level quality),
the NRM client needs to inform the NRM server that the VAL UE is able to
receive the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer with sufficient
quality or not able to receive the VAL service communication on the MBMS
bearer with sufficient quality. Furthermore, based on the received quality,
the NRM client may notify the NRM server at which MBMS reception quality level
it has received the VAL service communication on the MBMS bearer.
The issue can be more complex since the NRM client needs to estimate the
quality of the bearer even in the scenario when there are no data currently
transmitted on the MBMS bearer. The reason for this is that an NRM client that
has entered an area with significantly degraded MBMS quality, might not even
notice that a VAL service communication is ongoing, meanwhile the NRM server
still assumes that the VAL UE can receive the VAL service communication being
broadcasted.
To estimate the MBMS bearer quality, for example as an equivalent BLER (Block
Error Rate), when no data is sent is implementation specific. This estimation
can be dependent on for example the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and
measurements from the reference signals from the eNB(s). Other metrics (e.g.
RTP packet loss) may be used to estimate the MBMS bearer quality.
Based on the MBMS bearer quality reported from the NRM clients, the NRM server
may decide to use the MBMS bearer for a group communication if a certain
number of NRM clients located in the MBMS service area are able to receive the
VAL service communication. And if a NRM client is not able to receive the VAL
service communication on the MBMS bearer, the NRM server may decide to switch
the user plane deliver mode for the NRM client from MBMS bearer to unicast
bearer.
##### 14.3.4.5.2 Procedure
The NRM client shall indicate the ability of the NRM client to receive the
MBMS bearer.
Pre-conditions:
1\. There is an MBMS bearer activated and the MBMS bearer information is
announced to the NRM client
2\. The NRM client is located in the MBMS broadcasting area
3\. The VAL UE monitors SIB-13 (or SIB-20) and (SC-)MCCH to receive the
modulation and coding scheme
4\. The VAL UE monitors the cell specific reference signal and when MBSFN
transmission is used, the MBSFN specific reference signals
Figure 14.3.4.5.2-1: MBMS bearer quality detection
1\. The NRM client determines that the MBMS bearer quality shall be reported
to the NRM server. The NRM client may determine the MBMS bearer quality by
using the BLER of the received data. When no data is received, the quality
estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding
scheme (MCS). The UE may also use predictive methods to estimate the expected
MBMS bearer quality (e.g. speed and direction) to proactively inform the NRM
server of an expected loss of the MBMS bearer quality. The NRM client may also
map the determined MBMS bearer quality to a MBMS reception quality level. The
MBMS reception quality level indicates at which specific MBMS bearer quality
level the VAL service communication has been received.
Editor\'s note: The set of MBMS reception quality levels and the mapping of
the determined MBMS bearer quality to those levels are FFS.
NOTE 1: When MBSFN transmission is used, the MBSFN reference signal needs to
be used and when SC-PTM is used the cell specific reference signal needs to be
used. With the measured reference signal, the reference signal received
quality (RSRQ) can be calculated.
2\. If the MBMS bearer quality reaches a certain threshold, the NRM client
sends an MBMS listening status report. The threshold is used to define the
MBMS listening status, which indicates if the MBMS bearer quality has been
acceptable or not to receive a specific VAL service communication. If the MBMS
bearer quality is mapped to a different MBMS reception quality level, the NRM
client may send an MBMS listening status report including the MBMS reception
quality level. Based on the MBMS listening status, if MBMS reception quality
level is received, then the NRM server may efficiently decide to switch to
another bearer (e.g., MBMS bearer or unicast bearer) or to take measures to
prepare such a switch and further notify the VAL server.
NOTE 2: Prior sending the MBMS listening status report, it could be beneficial
to also include information for different alternatives e.g. another MBMS
bearer might have better quality and could be a better option than a transfer
of the communication to unicast.
NOTE 3: The threshold used to indicate MBMS bearer quality depends on VAL
service type (i.e. V2X, MCPTT, MCVideo or MCData) and the metrics used. The
metrics used and the associated thresholds are out of scope of this
specification.
3\. The NRM server may send additional proposal for measurements e.g.
information about neighbouring MBMS bearers. This message may be an MBMS
bearer announcement message.
4\. The NRM server may send user plane delivery mode to VAL server based on
the MBMS listening status to preserve the service continuity as described in
clause 14.3.4.6 and clause 14.3.4.9.
#### 14.3.4.6 Service continuity in MBMS scenarios
##### 14.3.4.6.1 General
This subclause specifies service continuity scenarios when MBMS bearers are
used. There are different solutions for different scenarios.
##### 14.3.4.6.2 Service continuity when moving from one MBSFN to another
The service continuity solution described in this subclause is suitable in the
scenario when multiple MBMS bearers are used with the purpose to cover a
larger area. In VAL communications several VAL service communication streams
may be multiplexed in one MBMS bearer. Furthermore, one VAL service
communication stream may be sent on more than one MBMS bearer if the receiving
users are distributed over more than one MBMS service area. A VAL UE that is
interested in receiving a VAL service communication stream that is broadcasted
in both MBMS bearers is a candidate for this service continuity procedure.
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-1 illustrates a deployment scenario that provides service
continuity between two MBSFN areas. Two different MBMS bearers are activated
(TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), the activation of the bearers is done in the two MBSFN
areas (MBSFN 1 and MBSFN 2). The MBSFN areas 1 and 2 are partially
overlapping, meaning that some transmitting cells belong to both MBSFN area 1
and MBSFN area 2.
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-1: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-2 illustrates the procedure:
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-2: Service continuity when moving from one MBSFN to another
1\. The VAL UE is located in MBSFN 1 and can listen to TMGI 1. No additional
MBMS bearers that the NRM client is interested in are active in the current
cell.
2a. The NRM client notifies the NRM server that the VAL UE is successfully
receiving the VAL service communication over TMGI 1. The NRM client may also
notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 1.
2b. The NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
NOTE: The MBMS reception quality level may be used by the NRM server to make
an efficient decision to switch to another MBMS bearer or to a unicast bearer,
or to take measures to prepare such a switch (e.g. when the quality level
indicates that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or
reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of VAL services).
3\. The VAL UE moves into a new cell in which both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2 are
active. This cell is part of both MBSFN area 1 and MBSFN area 2, and broadcast
the same service on both TMGIs.
4\. The NRM client sends a location information report to the NRM server. For
that, the UE uses the SAI information found in the system information block
(SIB) transmitted by the radio cells.
5\. The NRM server sends to the NRM client a MBMS bearer announcement with
information related to TMGI 2 (if the NRM server had not done it before).
Hence, the NRM client knows that TMGI 2 transmits the same VAL service
communication.
6a. The NRM client notifies the NRM server that it is successfully receiving
TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The NRM client may also notify the MBMS reception quality
level per TMGI.
6b. The NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
7\. The VAL UE may receive the VAL service communication over both MBMS
bearers, i.e. TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. The VAL UE may also verify that it is the
same content sent on both bearers. The duplicated packets may also be used to
perform error corrections.
8\. The VAL UE moves into a new cell in MBSFN area 2, where only TMGI 2 is
active.
9a. The NRM client notifies the NRM server that the VAL UE is successfully
receiving the VAL service communication over TMGI 2. The NRM client may also
notify the MBMS reception quality level of TMGI 2.
9b. The NRM server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
10\. The VAL UE receives the VAL service communication only over TMGI 2.
This service continuity procedure mitigates the risk of packet loss that may
occur if the VAL UE would request to transfer the VAL service communication
stream to a unicast bearer when moving into the new area and then back to a
multicast bearer when the UE can listen to TMGI 2. However, it is still
required that the NRM client sends a location report (and MBMS listening
report), as described in steps 4-6 above. To send the location report and the
MBMS listening report by the NRM client to the NRM server a unicast bearer is
needed. The location report from the NRM client is required, since the NRM
server must know that the VAL UE has entered a new area and can only listen to
MBMS bearer active in that area. If this is not done the VAL server might send
a VAL service communication stream that the VAL UE is required to listen to on
the MBMS bearer 1, since the NRM server still assumes that the VAL:UE is
located in the MBSFN area 1.
The solution can be improved as illustrated in figure 14.3.4.6.2-3. In this
case two different MBMS bearers are activated (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2), these MBMS
bearers are used only for VAL service communication. An application level
signalling bearer is activated (TMGI 9), in both MBSFN areas. This bearer is
used for application level signalling messages that are sent on the MBMS
bearer TMGI 9. By using an application level signalling bearer (e.g. TMGI 9)
the VAL UEs can receive application control messages for all VAL service
communication going on in the areas of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2. A VAL UE that
is located in the area of TMGI 2 and is interested in a VAL service group
transmission (e.g. V2X) only going on in TMGI 1, can with the information
received in TMGI 9 initiate a unicast bearer and request to receive that
specific VAL service communication over a unicast instead. Without the
information received over TMGI 9 the NRM client must immediately report that
the VAL UE has left the broadcast area that the NRM server assumes that the
VAL UE is located in. With the use of TMGI 9 there is no immediate need for
the NRM client to inform the NRM server of a location change.
Figure 14.3.4.6.2-3: Two MBMS bearer using overlapping MBSFN areas with a
separate application signalling bearer
The procedural steps in this scenario will be the same as described above in
this subclause. However, in this scenario the NRM client is not required to
initiate a unicast bearer to send location report (or MBMS listening report).
The VAL UE may move between the two MBMS bearers (TMGI 1 and TMGI 2) without
the need to report an area change. A condition for this to work is that there
is an application level signalling bearer (TMGI 9) activated in the full area
(i.e. the area of both TMGI 1 and TMGI 2). The TMGI 9 will broadcast all
application control messages for all VAL service communications ongoing in
both areas. If the VAL UE is in coverage of one of the two MBMS bearers that
does not transmit the VAL service communication of interest the VAL UE can
report to the NRM server that it is not able to listen to the VAL service
communication over the MBMS bearer, which triggers the NRM server to switch to
a unicast bearer instead.
#### 14.3.4.7 MBMS suspension notification
##### 14.3.4.7.1 General
In this procedure the NRM client is requested by the NRM server to send a MBMS
suspension report. This request for MBMS suspension report can be included in
the MBMS bearer announcement and the NRM server may choose to only send this
request for MBMS suspension report to a subset of all NRM clients.
##### 14.3.4.7.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.4.7.2.-1 illustrates a procedure in which the NRM client notifies
the NRM server about an MBMS suspension decision in RAN.
The NRM server can decide on a subset of all VAL UEs in the MBMS broadcast
area that shall report on MBMS bearer suspension. When the NRM server makes
the decision of the VAL UE subset, consideration shall be taken to the
location of the VAL UEs, since VAL UEs\' location is dynamically changed. This
means that the MBMS suspension reporting instruction may need to be updated
regularly based on the VAL UEs mobility.
Pre-condition:
\- It is assumed that there is at least one active MBMS bearer
Figure 14.3.4.7.2-1: MBMS suspension notification
1\. The NRM server sends an MBMS suspension reporting instruction to the NRM
client.
NOTE: This message may be included in the MBMS bearer announcement message and
may be sent both on a unicast bearer and a multicast bearer.
2\. RAN decides to suspend the MBMS bearer, according to existing procedures
in 3GPP TS 36.300 [23].
3\. An MBMS suspension indication is sent in the MSI (MCH Scheduling
Information), according to existing procedures in 3GPP TS 36.300 [23].
4\. The NRM client detect the MBMS suspension and sends an MBMS suspension
report.
5\. Based on the MBMS suspsension report received, the NRM server determines
whether to switch to a new bearer (unicast or MBMS). If NRM server determines
to switch to unicast bearer, then the NRM server sends the user plane delivery
mode message to VAL server , and the VAL server sends the downlink data over
the new bearer.
The NRM client that is not instructed to send an MBMS suspension report shall
still detect the MBMS suspension indication from RAN (step 3). A NRM client
shall in this case not send other types of report (e.g. MBMS listening
reports).
The same procedure can be applied at MBMS resumption or other MBMS events that
may be detected by the NRM client.
#### 14.3.4.8 MBMS bearer event notification
##### 14.3.4.8.1 General
The NRM server is an instantiation of a GCS AS. For the NRM server to know the
status of the MBMS bearer, and thus know the network\'s ability to deliver the
VAL service, it is required that the network provides MBMS bearer event
notifications to the NRM server. The different events notified to the NRM
server include the MBMS bearer start result (e.g. when the first cell
successfully allocated MBMS resources), including information if any cells
fail to allocate MBMS resources to a specific MBMS bearer, the current status
of the MBMS bearer, MBMS bearer suspension/resume or overload scenarios.
Editor\'s note: The procedure defined in this sub clause requires an
enhancement to GCSE and RAN and is therefore subject to implementation in EPC
and RAN.
##### 14.3.4.8.2 Procedure
The procedure in figure 14.3.4.8.2-1 shows notification information flows from
NRM server to BM-SC.
Figure 14.3.4.8.2-1: MBMS bearer event notification
1\. The NRM server activates an MBMS bearer. The activation of the MBMS bearer
is done on the MB2-C reference point and according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [16].
2\. The BMSC will respond to the activation with an Activate MBMS bearer
response message, according to 3GPP TS 23.468 [16].
3\. The EPC and RAN will initiate the MBMS session start procedure according
to 3GPP TS 23.246 [17]. This procedure is outside the scope of this
specification.
4a. At the first indication of a successful MBMS session start procedure, the
BM-SC sends a MBMS bearer event notification, indicating that the MBMS bearer
is ready to use.
4b. The NRM server notifies user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
5\. The VAL server starts to use the MBMS bearer according to the MBMS
procedures in this specification.
6\. An event from RAN related to the MBMS session is received by the BM-SC.
7a. The BM-SC notifies the NRM server of certain MBMS related events including
references to affected MBMS services areas or list of cells. Example of such
events may be radio resources not available, overload, MBMS suspension.
7b. The NRM server notifies user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
8\. The NRM server may decide, based on the received events, to switch to
unicast transmission for relevant VAL UEs.
NOTE: Steps 6-8 should be seen as example events from the network that may
occur and possible actions taken by the NRM server. These steps may be done at
any time and repeatedly during the life time of an MBMS bearer.
#### 14.3.4.9 Switching between MBMS bearer and unicast bearer
##### 14.3.4.9.1 General
The NRM server monitors the bearers used for VAL service communications and
decides to switch between MBMS and unicast bearers.
##### 14.3.4.9.2 Procedure
Figure 14.3.4.9.2-1 shows the procedure for service continuity when a UE is
about to move out of MBMS coverage or getting into good MBMS coverage by
switching between MBMS bearer and unicast bearer.
Pre-condition:
\- It is assumed that a bearer (unicast or MBMS) has been activated by the VAL
server for downlink delivery.
Figure 14.3.4.9.2-1: Switching between MBMS delivery and unicast delivery
1\. The VAL UE detects changing MBMS bearer condition (good or bad MBMS
coverage) for the corresponding MBMS service. The method to detect is
implementation specific.
2\. The NRM client notifies the NRM server about the MBMS bearer condition for
the corresponding MBMS service by sending the MBMS listening status report.
NOTE 1: To efficiently notify the NRM server, e.g., when the NRM client
detects that the reception quality of the MBMS bearer is decreasing or
reaching an insufficient quality level for the reception of VAL services, the
NRM client proactively may send to the NRM server a MBMS listening status
report including the MBMS reception quality level.
3\. The NRM server makes the decision to switch between MBMS delivery and
unicast delivery based on available information at the NRM server including
the MBMS listening status report as described in clause 14.3.4.5. The NRM
server notifies a user plane delivery mode to the VAL server.
4\. The VAL server sends the downlink data over the new bearer (unicast or
MBMS) to the VAL client as per step 3.
NOTE 2: The new bearer (unicast or MBMS) may be set up on demand after step 3
or before.
5\. During the switching, the VAL client simultaneously receives downlink data
through both bearers (unicast bearer and MBMS bearer). If there is no downlink
data to the VAL client, this step can be skipped.
6\. The VAL client ceases to receive the downlink data through previous bearer
but continues receiving data through new bearer.
### 14.3.5 QoS/resource management for network-assisted UE-to-UE
communications
#### 14.3.5.1 General
This feature provides the SEAL NRM support for coordinated QoS/resource
management for network assisted UE-to-UE communications. Such capability may
be required for guaranteeing end-to-end QoS fulfilment (primarily for meeting
end-to-end latency requirements) in network assisted UE to UE communications
and may accommodate various vertical-specific application services, e.g.:
\- Network-assisted Command and Control (C2) communications in UASAPP [TS
23.255], where the UAV controller navigates its UAV over the 5GS;
\- Teleoperated Driving (ToD) in eV2XAPP [TS 23.286], where the a V2X UE
acting as server may remotely control a further V2X UE over the 5GS;
\- Network-assisted Device-to-Device communications in Factory of the Future
(FF) use cases, such as control-to-control communications.
#### 14.3.5.2 QoS/resource management capability initiation in network
assisted UE-to-UE communications
This procedure provides a mechanism for initiating the capability at the NRM
server for managing the end-to-end application QoS requirement fulfilment for
a network-assisted VAL UE to VAL UE session (comprising a PDU session for each
of the constituent links, e.g. VAL UE 1 to PLMN, and PLMN to VAL UE 2). **The
request may come from NRM client of either of the VAL UEs within the service
and will trigger the end-to-end QoS/resource management by the NRM server. The
triggering the end-to-end QoS management request can be initiated by the VAL
application at the VAL UE, and the conditions may depend on the requirements
of the VAL service, e.g. for UAS such triggering may be needed when a UAV is
in-flight, or for V2X such trigger may be initiated when a controlled VAL UE
enters an urban area.**
##### 14.3.5.2.1 Procedure
Figure 14.3.5.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure where the NRM server is
initiating the end-to-end QoS/resource management capability for network-
assisted UE-to-UE communications.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The NRM client is connected to the NRM server.
2\. The VAL UEs involved in the end-to-end session (VAL UE 1 and VAL UE 2) are
connected to one or more PLMNs and have ongoing PDU sessions.
3\. NRM server has used the \"Setting up an AF session with required QoS
procedure\" (clause 4.15.6.6 of TS 23.502).
Figure 14.3.5.2.1-1 end-to-end QoS management request / response
1\. The NRM client 1 (of VAL UE 1) sends to the NRM server an end-to-end QoS
management request for managing the QoS for the end-to-end application
session.
2\. The NRM server configures the application QoS parameters by decomposing
the end-to-end QoS requirements (VAL UE 1 to VAL UE 2) to application QoS
parameters for each individual session (e.g. network session for VAL UE 1 -and
network session for VAL UE 2) which are part of the end-to-end application
session.
3\. The NRM server sends to the NRM client 1 an end-to-end QoS management
response with a positive or negative acknowledgement of the request.
4\. The NRM server may also send a notification to NRM client 2 (of VAL UE 2)
to inform about the end-to-end QoS management initiation by the NRM server.
#### 14.3.5.3 Procedure for coordinated QoS provisioning operation in network
assisted UE-to-UE communications
This procedure provides a mechanism for ensuring the end-to-end application
QoS requirement fulfilment for the application service (which is between two
or more VAL UEs), considering that the QoS of one of the links may downgrade.
**It is assumed that the application session is ongoing, and both the source
and target VAL UEs are connected to 3GPP network (the same or different). The
communication between the VAL UEs is assumed to be in-direct / network-
assisted; hence two PDU sessions are established respectively (one per VAL
UE).**
##### 14.3.5.3.1 Procedure
Figure 14.3.5.3.1-1 illustrates the procedure where the NRM server supports
the coordinated QoS provisioning for network-assisted UE-to-UE communications.
Pre-conditions:
1\. NRM server has activated the end-to-end QoS/resource management
capability, as described in 14.3.5.2.1
2\. NRM server, acting as AF, has registered to receive QoS monitoring event
notifications from 5GC and notifications from VAL UEs (from both UEs), as
specified in TS 23.501.
Figure 14.3.5.3.1-1: NRM-assisted coordinated QoS provisioning for C2
communication
1a. A QoS downgrade trigger event is sent from the NRM client of the VAL UE 1
to the NRM server, denoting an application QoS degradation (experienced or
expected) e.g. based on the experienced packet delay or packet loss for the Uu
link (e.g. packet loss great than threshold value). **The conditions for
triggering the QoS downgrade indication from the NRM client is based on the
threshold that may be provided in advance by the NRM server (at the** end-to-
end QoS management response **by the NRM server in** 14.3.5.2.1**).**
1b. Alternatively, the NRM server receives a trigger event from the 5GC
(SMF/NEF), denoting a QoS downgrade notification for the VAL UE 1 session.
(described in clause 5.7.2.4.1b of 3GPP TS 23.501).
2\. The NRM server evaluates the fulfilment/non-fulfilment of the end-to-end
QoS based on the trigger event. NRM server may retrieve additional information
**based on subscription to support its evaluation. This could be** from the
5GC (**NEF Monitoring Events as in 23.502, QoS sustainability analytics as in
TS 23.288 [34]) or SEAL LMS (on demand location reporting for one or both VAL
UEs 1 and 2).**
Then, the NRM server, determines an action, which is the QoS parameter
adaptation of one or both links (QoS profile downgrade for the link receive
QoS notification control, and QoS upgrade for the link which can be upgraded).
3\. The NRM/SEAL server, acting as AF, sends to the 5GC (to SMF via NEF or to
PCF via N5) a request for a change of the QoS profile mapped to the one or
both network sessions (for VAL UE 1 and UE 2) or the update of the PCC rules
to apply the new traffic policy (as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 in clause
4.15.6.6a: AF session with required QoS update procedure).
4\. The NRM server sends an application QoS change notification to the
affected NRM clients, to inform on the adaptation of the QoS requirements for
the individual session.
### 14.3.6 Event Monitoring
#### 14.3.6.1 General
The VAL server utilizes the NRM server for monitoring the events related to
its VAL UEs and receive the event reports. The NRM server shall subscribe to
multiple core network services to fetch all the required events related to the
multiple VAL UEs served by the VAL server and report the same to the VAL
server with the event details.
To monitor and report the events related to the VAL UE from the 3GPP core
network, the NRM server shall use the Monitoring Events procedures as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11].
To monitor and report the analytics events related to the VAL UE, the NRM
server shall use the procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34].
#### 14.3.6.2 Monitoring Events Subscription Procedure
##### 14.3.6.2.1 General
The VAL server subscribes to the NRM server to monitor the events related to
VAL UE(s). Based on the VAL server request, the NRM server consumes the
relevant core network services to receive the events related to the VAL UE(s).
The related procedure is illustrated in the next clause.
##### 14.3.6.2.2 Procedure
The procedure for VAL server subscribing to the NRM server, to monitor the VAL
UE(s) related events is described in figure 14.3.6.2.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The NRM server is authorized to consume the core network services
(Monitoring events as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and Analytics services
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34]);
Figure 14.3.6.2.2-1: Monitoring Events Subscription Procedure
1\. The VAL server sends Monitoring Events Subscription request to the NRM
server, requesting the NRM server to monitor the events related to the VAL
UE(s) as per the subscription request, and shall include the information
related to the events that the VAL server is interested in.
2\. The NRM server shall check if the VAL server is authorized to initiate the
Monitoring Events Subscription request and if authorized, shall respond with
Monitoring Events Subscription Response message, indicating the successful
subscription status along with subscription information to the VAL server. The
VAL service ID may be used by the NRM server to derive event specific
information in 3GPP core network services (e.g. QoS requirement in analytics
event subscription), based on e.g. local configuration. The NRM server maps
the VAL group ID (if received) to the External Group ID known to the 3GPP core
network.
NOTE: The mapping between Monitoring profile ID and event details in the NRM
server can be pre-configured and/or dynamically built based on VAL server
request with explicitly sent event details, which is implementation specific.
3\. Based on the events of interest information in the subscription request
message, if applicable, the NRM server shall subscribe to the UE monitoring
events (like, LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY, COMMUNICATION_FAILURE etc.) for the set of
UEs (VAL UEs) in the subscription request, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502
[11].
4\. Based on the events of interest information in the subscription request
message, if applicable, the NRM server shall subscribe to the UE analytics
events (like ABNORMAL_BEHAVIOUR etc.) for the set of UEs (VAL UEs) in the
subscription request, as specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34].
#### 14.3.6.3 Monitoring Events Notification Procedure
##### 14.3.6.3.1 General
The NRM server receives the events related to VAL UE(s) from the 3GPP core
network. The NRM server reports the monitoring events information to the VAL
server.
##### 14.3.6.3.2 Procedure
The procedure for NRM server notifying the VAL server with VAL UE(s) related
events is described in figure 14.3.6.3.2-1.
Pre-conditions:
\- The VAL server has subscribed with NRM server using Monitoring Events
Subscription Procedure as specified in clause 14.3.6.2;
Figure 14.3.6.3.2-1: Monitoring Events Notification Procedure
1\. If applicable, the NRM server receives the VAL UE related monitoring event
notifications from the 3GPP core network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11].
2\. If applicable, the NRM server receives the VAL UE related Analytics event
notifications from the 3GPP core network as specified in 3GPP TS 23.288 [34].
3\. The NRM server notifies the VAL server about the events related to the VAL
UE in Notify Monitorng Events message. If multiple events are to be notified,
then the NRM server may aggregate the notifications and send to the VAL
server.
### 14.3.7 5G TSC resource management procedures
#### 14.3.7.1 General
The procedures related to the 5G TSC network resource management are described
in the following subclauses.
#### 14.3.7.2 TSC stream availability discovery procedure
The TSC stream availability discovery procedure is used by the VAL server to
discover the availability of resources for TSC communication for the given
stream specification (i.e., between the target UEs) prior to creating the
stream.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Each UE has an established Ethernet PDU session and DS-TTs are connected
to the 5GS TSC bridge. The traffic classes are configured on each DS-TT.
2\. The NRM server has collected the 5GS TSC bridge management and port
management information. The latter is related to the Ethernet ports located in
the DS-TTs including bridge delay per DS-TT Ethernet port pair per traffic
class.
3\. NRM server has calculated the bridge delay for each port pair, i.e.
composed of (ingress DS-TT Ethernet port, egress DS-TT Ethernet port)
including the UE-DS-TT residence time, packet delay budget (PDB) and
propagation delay for both UL from sender UE and DL to receiver UE.
Figure 14.3.7.2-1: TSC stream availability discovery procedure
1\. The NRM server receives a request from a VAL server on NRM-S reference
point to discover the connectivity and available QoS characteristics between
DS-TTs identified by the stream specification.
2\. The NRM server validates the connectivity between the DS-TTs connected in
the same 5GS TSC bridge based on the collected 5GS TSC bridge management and
port management information, identifies the traffic classes supported by the
DS-TTs and determines the end-to-end latency (including the UE-DS-TT residence
times, PDBs and propagation delay).
3\. NRM server responds to the VAL server with the stream specification and a
list of traffic specifications with the available end-to-end latency and the
traffic classes supported by the DS-TTs.
#### 14.3.7.3 TSC stream creation procedure
This procedure allows the VAL server to create a TSC stream. The TSC stream
creation procedure enables the VAL server to establish TSC connectivity with
the required QoS between the UEs connected to the 5GS after the stream
discovery procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. Each UE has an established Ethernet PDU session for its DS-TT port MAC
address.
2\. Connectivity between the DS-TTs has been validated by the TSC stream
availability discovery procedure.
3\. NRM server maintains mapping from the traffic class to TSC QoS.
Figure 14.3.7.3-1: TSC stream creation procedure
1\. NRM server receives a TSC stream creation request from a VAL server to
create a TSC stream identified by a VAL Stream ID, between DS-TT ports in the
stream specification and for the traffic class in the traffic specification.
2\. NRM server calculates the schedule for the VAL Stream ID based on the
information collected earlier from the 5GS via N5. It provides per-stream
filtering and policing parameters (e.g. as defined in IEEE 802.1Q [IEEE8021Q])
used to derive the TSC QoS information and related flow information. NRM
server also provides the forwarding rule (e.g. as defined in IEEE 802.1Q
[IEEE8021Q]) used to identify the DS-TT MAC address of the corresponding PDU
session. Based on the 5GS bridge delay information it determines the TSC QoS
information and TSC Assistance information for the stream.
3\. As a TSCTSF, the NRM server triggers via N5 the
Npcf_policy_Authorization_Create service operation as described in 3GPP TS
23.502 [11] for the TSC stream for both UL QoS flow (sender UE to UPF/bridge)
and DL QoS flow (UPF/bridge to receiver UE). The Policy Authorization request
includes the DS-TT port MAC address, TSC QoS information, TSC Assistance
Information (3GPP TS 23.501 [1], cl.5.27.2.3), flow bit rate, priority,
Service Data Flow Filter containing flow description including Ethernet Packet
Filters. The QoS flow will be assigned for the PDU session for the source MAC
address for the UL direction and for the PDU session for the destination MAC
address for the DL direction. This information is delivered to the DS-TT by
the 5GS.
Editor\'s note: Using gate control parameters for hold and forward buffering
is FFS.
4\. NRM server sends TSC stream creation response to the VAL server with the
result of TSC stream creation for the VAL Stream ID.
#### 14.3.7.4 TSC stream deletion procedure
This procedure allows the VAL server to delete a TSC stream.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The TSC stream is configured in the 5GS and the DS-TTs.
Figure 14.3.7.4-1: TSC stream deletion procedure
1\. NRM server receives a request from VAL server to delete a TSC stream for
with a VAL Stream ID.
2\. NRM server identifies the MAC addresses of the DS-TTs involved in the
stream based on the stored information for the VAL Stream ID.
3\. As a TSCTSF, the NRM server triggers via Nxx the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation defined in 3GPP TS 23.502
[11] for MAC addresses referred to by the VAL Stream ID. NRM server uses the
procedure to delete both UL QoS flow (sender UE to UPF/bridge) and DL QoS
flows (UPF/bridge to receiver UE) from the PDU sessions of the UEs referred to
by the VAL Stream ID.
4\. NRM server sends TSC stream deletion response to the VAL server with the
result of TSC stream deletion for the VAL Stream ID.
### 14.3.8 TSN resource management procedures
#### 14.3.8.1 General
The procedures related to the TSN network resource management are described in
the following subclauses.
#### 14.3.8.2 5GS TSN Bridge information reporting
Pre-conditions:
1\. There is already an established session between the TSN CNC and the NRM-S
acting as TSN-AF.
Figure 14.3.8.2-1: TSN Bridge information reporting procedure
1\. Acting as the TSN AF the NRM server collects 5GS TSN Bridge information by
interaction with the 5GS via the N5 reference point, as described in in TS
23.502 [11] Annex F.1. The NRM server stores the binding relationship between
5GS Bridge ID, MAC address of the DS-TT Ethernet port and also updates 5GS
bridge delay as defined in clause 5.27.5 of TS 23.501 [10]. The NRM server
retrieves txPropagationDelay and Traffic Class table from DS-TT and it also
retrieves txPropagationDelay and Traffic Class table from NW-TT.
2\. Whenever there is a new or updated bridge information the NRM server
interacts with the TSN CNC and reports the TSN Bridge information to register
a new TSN Bridge or update an existing TSN Bridge. The TSN CNC stores the TSN
Bridge information and confirms to the NRM server.
#### 14.3.8.3 5GS TSN Bridge configuration procedure
Pre-conditions:
1\. The TSN CNC has stored the 5GS TSN Bridge information received from the
NRM server acting as TSN AF.
2\. The NRM server acting as TSN AF has stored the 5GS TSN Bridge information
collected from the 5GS, as described in clause 14.3.8.2.
Figure 14.3.8.3-1: TSN Bridge configuration procedure
1\. The NRM server receives from the TSN CNC per-stream filtering, policing
parameters and related flow information according to IEEE 802.1Q [36] and it
uses them to derive TSN QoS information and related flow information. The TSN
AF uses this information to identify the DS-TT MAC address of the
corresponding PDU session.
2\. NRM server triggers via N5 the AF request procedure as described in 3GPP
TS 23.502 [11] Annex F.2. The AF request includes the DS-TT port MAC address,
TSC QoS information, TSC Assistance Information, flow bit rate, priority,
Service Data Flow Filter containing flow description including Ethernet Packet
Filters.
> 3\. NRM server responds with a TSN Bridge configuration.

# 15 Service-based interface representation of the functional model for SEAL
services
## 15.1 General
The functional models for SEAL services is represented using functional
entities and reference points between the functional entities as specified in
subclause 6. The vertical applications consume the SEAL services in the form
of APIs. Each SEAL service offers these APIs on a service-based interface to
all its consumer entities.
## 15.2 Functional model representation
Figure 15.2-1 illustrates the service-based interface representation of the
functional model for SEAL services.
Figure 15.2-1: SEAL generic functional model representation using service-
based interfaces
The SEAL function(s) exhibit the service-based interfaces which are used for
providing and consuming SEAL services. The service APIs are specified for each
SEAL function enabled over the service-based interface. The service-based
interfaces of specific SEAL services are specified in this document. All the
interactions with SEAL are governed based on the reference point interactions
of the functional models specified in subclause 6. VAL function represents the
functionalities of the VAL server.
NOTE: The service-based interface Sval for the VAL function is out of scope of
the present document.
The service APIs offered by the SEAL function(s) are published and discovered
on the CAPIF core function as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [8].
Editor\'s note: Refinement of the SEAL services in service-based interface
representation is FFS.

# 16 Network slice capability enablement
## 16.1 General
The network slice capability enablement is a SEAL service that offers network
slice capability enablement capabilities, such as support for vertical
application to slice re-mapping (which can be defined as the mapping of the
UEs running a vertical application to different slice), to one or more
vertical applications. In particular, network slice capability enablement uses
a network-based mechanism to apply the slice re-mapping based on the network
slice capability enablement server configuration, where the network slice
capability enablement server acting as AF influences the URSP rules for the
application traffic per UE by providing a guidance on the route selection
parameters (including the S-NSSAI and DNN mapping).
NOTE: The network slice capability enablement server, acts as an AF within the
trusted domain (MNO-owned, or trusted third party).
## 16.2 Functional model
### 16.2.1 General
The functional model for the network slice capability enablement is based on
the generic functional model specified in clause 6.2. It is organized into
functional entities to describe a functional architecture which addresses the
support for network slice capability enablement aspects for vertical
applications. Since the slicing is a feature which considers the Uu
interfaces, only the on-network functional model is specified in this clause.
### 16.2.2 Functional model description
Figure 16.2.2-1 illustrates the generic functional model for network slice
capability enablement.
Figure 16.2.2-1: Functional model for network slice capability enablement
The network slice capability enablement client communicates with the network
slice capability enablement server over the NSCE-UU reference point. The
network slice capability enablement client provides the support for network
slice capability enablement functions to the VAL client(s) over NSCEâ€‘C
reference point. The VAL server(s) communicates with the network slice
capability enablement server over the NSCE-S reference point. It is assumed
that the network slice capability enablement server is deployed at the 5G
system domain. The network slice capability enablement server, acting as AF,
may communicate with the 5G Core Network functions via NEF (N33) reference
point (for interactions with PCF).
### 16.2.3 Functional entities description
#### 16.2.3.1 General
The functional entities for network slice capability enablement SEAL service
are described in the following subclauses.
#### 16.2.3.2 Network slice capability enablement server
The network slice capability enablement server functional entity provides the
enablement of the network slicing aspects to support the VAL applications.
Such enablement supports the mapping or migration of one or more vertical
applications to one or more network slices (from a set of network slices, as
provided by the 3GPP network system) as described in procedure in clauses
16.3.2.3 and 16.3.2.4. Such adaptation assumes that the UE is subscribed to
more than one slice and is done via providing a guidance to update the URSP
rules at the 5GS (denoted in clause 16.3.3 as network-based mechanism).
#### 16.2.3.3 Network slice capability enablement client
The network slice capability enablement client functional entity acts as the
application client for the slice enablement. The network slice capability
enablement client interacts with the network slice capability enablement
server to trigger a network slice adaptation due to an application requirement
change. This trigger may be due to an application QoS requirement change, a
service operation change. The NSCE client may receive a network slice / DNN
re-mapping notification from the NSCE server. The NSCE client may optionally
notify the VAL client on the network slice / DNN re-mapping.
### 16.2.4 Reference points description
#### 16.2.4.1 General
The reference points for the functional model for network slice capability
enablement are described in the following subclauses.
#### 16.2.4.2 NSCE-UU
The interactions related to network slice capability enablement functions
between the network slice capability enablement server and the network slice
capability enablement client are supported by NSCE-UU reference point. This
reference point utilizes Uu reference point as described in 3GPP TS 23.501
[10].
#### 16.2.4.3 NSCE-C
The interactions related to network slice capability enablement functions
between the VAL client(s) and the network slice capability enablement client
within a VAL UE are supported by the NSCE-C reference point. The NSCE client
may receive an application requirement change over NSCE-C. Further, the NSCE
client may provide a notification on the network slice adaptation upon
successful adaptation of the slice to application mapping.
#### 16.2.4.4 NSCE-S
The interactions related to network slice capability enablement functions
between the VAL server(s) and the network slice capability enablement server
are supported by the NSCE-S reference point. This reference point is an
instance of CAPIF-2 reference point as specified in 3GPP TS 23.222 [8].
#### 16.2.4.5 N33
The reference point N33 supports the interactions between the network slice
capability enablement server and the NEF and is specified in 3GPP TS 23.501
[10]. N33 is used for the network-based mechanism for slice re-mapping, where
NSCE server acting as AF influences the URSP rules for the application traffic
per UE by providing a guidance on the route selection parameters (including
the S-NSSAI and DNN mapping), as specified in TS23.502 clause 4.15.6.10, TS
23.503 clause 6.6.2.2, TS 23.548 clause 6.2.4.
## 16.3 Procedures and information flows for network slice capability
enablement
### 16.3.1 General
### 16.3.2 Network slice adaptation for VAL application
#### 16.3.2.1 General
This subclause describes the procedure for network slice adaptation at the
Network Slice Capability Enablement (NSCE) server, based on a request from a
VAL server to adapt the network slice for the VAL application. This request is
handled between the NSCE server and the NSCE client per each VAL UE of the VAL
application.
#### 16.3.2.2 Information flows
##### 16.3.2.2.1 Network slice adaptation request
Table 16.3.2.2.1-1 describes the information flow network slice adaptation
request from the VAL server to the NSCE server.

#### 16.3.2.3 Procedure for VAL server-triggered and network-based network
slice adaptation for VAL application
Figure 16.3.2.3-1 illustrates the VAL server-triggered and network-based
procedure where the NSCE server supports the network slice adaptation with the
underlying 3GPP system for the VAL UEs of the VAL application.
Figure 16.3.2.3-1: Network slice adaptation for VAL application
1\. The VAL server sends a network slice adaptation request to the NSCE server
for the VAL application (and the VAL UEs within the VAL application). This
request may be in the form of exact requested network slice (and optionally
DNN) for all the VAL UEs of the VAL application; or indication that the VAL
application needs to be remapped to a different network slice (and optionally
DNN).
2\. The NSCE server processes the request and triggers the network slice
configuration per VAL UE within the VAL Application.
3\. The NSCE server acting as AF provides the updated S-NSSAI and DNN per VAL
UE. In particular, NSCE server sends this information to the PCF via NEF as
part of the AF-driven guidance for URSP determination to 5G system (as
specified in TS23.502 clause 4.15.6.10, TS 23.503 clause 6.6.2.2, TS 23.548
clause 6.2.4). This guidance may update the route selection parameters to
indicate different sets of PDU Session information (DNN, S-NSSAI) that can be
associated with applications matching the application traffic.
NOTE: NSCE server provides the updated S-NSSAI/DNN as a suggestion/guidance to
PCF; however it is up to PCF to decide whether to perform the slice/DNN re-
mapping
> 4\. Upon successful adaptation of the route selection parameters, the NSCE
> server provides a network slice adaptation response to the VAL server,
> providing information on the fulfilment of the network slice adaptation
> request per VAL application.
#### 16.3.2.4 Procedure for VAL UE-triggered and network-based network slice
adaptation for VAL application
Figure 16.3.2.4-1 illustrates the VAL UE-triggered and network-based procedure
where the NSCE server supports the network slice adaptation with the
underlying 3GPP system for the VAL UEs of the VAL application.
Pre-condition:
\- The NSCE client has connected to the NSCE server;
Figure 16.3.2.4-1: Network slice adaptation for VAL application
1\. The VAL client provides a new application requirement to the NSCE client,
indicating a new service profile for the VAL application. This may be in the
form of a change at the application QoS requirements, service operation
change, or other application-related parameters.
2\. The NSCE client sends a network slice adaptation trigger to the NSCE
server for the VAL application. This trigger may be in the form of exact
requested network slice (and optionally DNN) for the VAL UE of the VAL
application; or indication that the VAL application needs to be remapped to a
different network slice (and optionally DNN).
NOTE 1ï¼šHow the requested network slice is known by the NSCE client is out of
scope of this release.
3\. The NSCE server processes the request and triggers the network slice
configuration per VAL UE within the VAL Application.
NOTE 2ï¼šWhether and how the NSCE server triggers the network slice adaptation
for all the VAL UEs within the VAL Application is out of scope of this
release.
4\. The NSCE server acting as AF provides the updated S-NSSAI and DNN per VAL
UE. In particular, NSCE server sends this information to the PCF via NEF as
part of the AF-driven guidance for URSP determination to 5G system (as
specified in TS23.502 clause 4.15.6.10, TS 23.503 clause 6.6.2.2, TS 23.548
clause 6.2.4). This guidance may update the route selection parameters to
indicate different sets of PDU Session information (DNN, S-NSSAI) that can be
associated with applications matching the application traffic.
NOTE 3: NSCE server provides the updated S-NSSAI/DNN as a suggestion/guidance
to PCF; however it is up to PCF to decide whether to perform the slice/DNN re-
mapping
5\. The NSCE server may send a notification to the NSCE client indicating
success or failure.

###### ### Annex C (normative): Protocol realizations of LWP in the signalling
control plane
# C.1 General
This annex specifies protocol realizations of the light-weight protocol in the
signalling control plane.
# C.2 Usage of CoAP as LWP
This clause specifies how the CoAP protocol shall be used to realize the
generic light-weight protocol in the signalling control plane.
The Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) is a light-weight protocol defined
by IETF in RFC 7252 [32] and designed specifically for application layer
communication for constrained devices. CoAP provides a request/response
interaction model between application endpoints, supports built-in discovery
of services and resources, and includes key concepts of the Web such as URIs
and Internet media types. CoAP is designed to easily interface with HTTP for
integration with the Web while meeting specialized requirements such as
multicast support, very low overhead, and simplicity for constrained
environments. RFC 7252 [32] specifies bindings to UDP and DTLS. IETF RFC 8323
[33] specifies bindings to TCP, WebSocket and TLS.
Figure C.2-1 illustrates the functional model for the LWP signalling control
plane when CoAP is used as the LWP.
Figure C.2-1: Functional model for LWP signalling control plane when CoAP is
used as LWP
When CoAP is used to realize the generic light-weight protocol defined in
clause 6.2, then,
1\. CoAP client is a realization of the LWP client
2\. CoAP proxy is a realization of the LWP proxy, with the following
clarifications:
a. CoAP proxy shall be able to terminate a DTLS, TLS or secure WebSocket
session on LWP-1 reference point;
b. CoAP proxy shall be able to act as a cross-protocol CoAP-HTTP proxy to
support LWP-HTTP-2 and LWP-HTTP-3 reference points;
3\. CoAP server is a realization of the LWP server
4\. CoAP supports the interactions over LWP-1, LWP-2 and LWP-3 reference
points
5\. The usage of CoAP by the SEAL service enablers shall follow the rules set
out in clause 6.4.3.5.
