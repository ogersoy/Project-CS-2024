## 7.4 C2 Communication mode selection and switching
### 7.4.1 General
This feature introduces the UAS application enablement services for supporting
the selection and re-selection of C2 communication modes. In particular, the
UAE layer provides support for the following operations:
\- Support the switch between the Network-Assisted C2 communication and Direct
C2 communication (e.g. when the direct link becomes feasible/available, or
when a UAV is moving towards BVLOS or has poor direct link conditions, etc.)
as described in clause 7.4.2.4.
\- Support the switch between the Network-Assisted/Direct C2 communication and
UTM-Navigated C2 communication (e.g. for air traffic control, the UAV is
approaching a No Drone Zone, and detected potential security threats, etc.) as
described in clause 7.4.2.5.
\- Support the selection of the communication mode between: utilizing more
than one C2 communication links, and among applicable C2 communication links,
selecting a mode as the primary one as described in clause 7.4.2.3.
\- Activation for the support of the above operations in the UAE Server in the
UAE client is performed using procedure described respectively in clause
7.4.2.1 and clause 7.4.2.2.
Below, the different procedures for C2 communication mode selection and
switching are described using UAE Client assisted and UAE Server controlled
based mechanisms. Such functionality is supported by means of policies
delivered to the UAV/UAV-C via the UAE layer and assisting the dynamic
switching of C2 modes.
NOTE: For direct C2 communication mode, usage of ProSe/PC5 is not considered
in the present specification (e.g. direct wireless communication over a
technology outside the scope of 3GPP is assumed).
### 7.4.2 Procedures
#### 7.4.2.1 Management of C2 mode selection / switching capability
This procedure manages the C2 mode selection/switching capability at the UAE
server, based on an application request from UAS application specific server
(which can be the USS/UTM) to manage the C2 operation modes (direct, network-
assisted) of C2 communication for a UAS.
Figure 7.4.2.1-1 illustrates the procedure where the UAE server receives an
application request for managing the operation mode for C2 communications for
a UAS.
Pre-condition:
\- The UAV has received its UAS ID from the UAS application specific server.
Figure 7.4.2.1-1: C2 operation mode management request / response
1\. The UAS application specific server sends to the UAE Server a C2 operation
mode management request for managing the operation modes for the C2
communication for a UAS (consisting a UAV and a UAV-C) and to subscribe for
UAE notifications.
2\. The UAE Server sends to the UAS application specific server a C2 operation
mode management response with a positive or negative acknowledgement of the
request, based on capability of UAE server to undertake this task.
3\. UAE server executes C2 communication modes configuration according to
clause 7.4.2.2.
4\. After execution of C2 communication modes configuration, the UAE server
notifies the UAS application specific server with a C2 operation mode
management complete.
#### 7.4.2.2 C2 communication modes configuration
This procedure enables the configuration of the UAE Client, based on an
application request from UAS application specific server (which can be the
USS/UTM) to manage the C2 operation modes (direct, network-assisted) of C2
communication for a UAS.
Figure 7.4.2.2-1 illustrates the C2 communication modes configuration
procedure.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The UAS UEs are connected to 5GS and authenticated and authorized by UAS
application specific server as specified in clause 5.2 of 3GPP TS 23.256 [4].
2\. UAE Server has established a UAE session with the respective UAE Clients
as the UAE clients are successfully registered to the UAE server.
3\. UAE Server has performed the C2 mode switching/selection capability
initiation as in clause 7.4.2.1.
Figure 7.4.2.2-1: C2 communication modes configuration
1\. The UAE Server sends a C2 communication modes configuration request
including the UAS identifier, allowed C2 communication modes (e.g., direct,
network assisted, UTM-Navigated), primary and optionally secondary C2
communication mode and policy for switching. In the case of removal of C2
communication mode configuration parameters from the UAV or UAV-C, then the
request shall only include the UAS identifier.
2\. The UAE Client stores or removes the C2 communication mode configuration
parameters as per the information received in step 1.
3\. The UAE Client sends a C2 communication modes configuration response to
the UAE Server.
#### 7.4.2.3 C2 communication mode selection by UAE Client
This procedure provides a mechanism for the UAE client to select a primary C2
communication mode and optional secondary C2 communication mode based on C2
communication mode configuration enabled as described in clause 7.4.2.2.
Figure 7.4.2.3-1 illustrates the C2 communication mode selection and redundant
C2 link negotiation.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The UAE Clients are configured with a C2 communication modes configuration
as described in clause 7.4.2.2.
2\. UAE Server has activated the dynamic C2 mode switching capability, as
described in clause 7.4.2.1.
Figure 7.4.2.3-1: C2 communication mode selection
1\. UAE Clients (UAV and UAV-C) select a primary and secondary C2
communication mode based on C2 communication mode configuration.
2\. The UAE Client sends a C2 communication mode notification to the UAE
Server indicating the selected primary and secondary C2 communication modes
and associated C2 link information which may include UAE Client and peer
address information (e.g., IP/MAC address).
3\. The UAE Server stores the C2 communication modes and links information.
4a-4b. The UAE Server forwards the C2 communication mode and links information
to the UAS application specific server and receives a C2 communication mode
notification acknowledgement from the UAS application specific server.
5\. The UAE Server may forward the C2 communication mode notification
acknowledgement to the UAE Client.
6\. The UAV and UAV-C start C2 communication using the selected C2
communication mode.
NOTE: The details of step 6 are outside the scope of the present
specification.
#### 7.4.2.4 UAE layer assisted dynamic C2 mode switching
This procedure provides a mechanism for supporting dynamic switching between
direct and network assisted C2 communications, which may be required while the
UAV flight is ongoing, due to possible change of network conditions, expected
location/mobility of the UAV, unpredictable events etc.
Figure 7.4.2.4-1 illustrates the procedure where the UAE server supports the
dynamic C2 mode switching for network-assisted C2 communications.
Pre-conditions:
1\. UAE Server has activated the dynamic C2 mode switching capability, as
described in clause 7.4.2.1
2\. UAE Server has subscribed for using SEAL/LMS services and has configured
the location event reporting, based on 3GPP TS 23.434 [5].
3\. UAE Client has selected a C2 communication mode as described in clause
7.4.2.3, and UAV and UAV-C are engaged in C2 communication.
Figure 7.4.2.4-1: UAE-assisted dynamic C2 mode switching
1\. The UAE Client detects a condition for switching C2 communication mode
based on local conditions (e.g. using the C2 communication mode switching
policy) or based on a command from the UAS application specific server (as
described in clause 7.4.2.5). A C2-related trigger event report is sent from
the UAE Client of the UAV and/or the UAV-C to the UAE Server, denoting a
command from the UAS application specific server or an application QoS
attribute change (experienced or expected) e.g. based on the experienced
packet delay or packet loss for the Uu or direct link (e.g. packet loss
greater than a pre-defined threshold).
2\. Additionally, the UAE Server receives a location report for the UAV/UAV-C
by the SEAL\'s LM server. The report can be either periodical or event-based
(e.g. UAV moving towards an area covered by a different cell or different
operator), as specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [5] SEAL\'s LM server procedures
(UAE Server acting as a VAL server).
3\. The UAE Server determines the switching of the C2 mode from direct to
network assisted or vice versa or to UTM-Navigated**. If the switching is**
from direct to network assisted or vice versa, this is done by calculating the
relative actual or expected UAV-to-UAV-C location, as well as other factors
like QoS fulfilment/unfulfilment, augmented location, mobility/speed,
direction, topography, weather conditions.
4\. The UAE Server sends a C2 mode switching confirmation request to the UAS
application specific server, which includes the UAS identifier as well as the
cause for switching and the switching option (direct to network-assisted or
network-assisted to direct or to UTM-Navigated). The UAE Server sends this
request to obtain confirmation from the UAS application specific server before
proceeding with switching to UTM-Navigated. This step is optional in the case
of switching from direct to network assisted or vice versa.
5\. Conditional on Step 3, the UAE Server receives from the UAS application
specific server a C2 mode switching confirmation response indicating a
positive or negative result for the requested change.
6\. The UAE Server sends to the involved UAE Clients, a C2 operation mode
switching message which provides an instruction to the UAV and UAV-C to switch
to network-assisted mode or to direct mode or to UTM-Navigated. The UAV and
UAV-C start C2 communication using the indicated C2 communication mode (e.g.,
direct, network assisted, UTM-Navigated).
7\. If an emergency switch of the C2 communication is deemed necessary by the
UAE Client (e.g. sudden loss of the active C2 link), the UAE Client changes
the link prior to the steps 1-6, which are skipped. The UAE Clients send a C2
operation mode switching performed message to the UAE Server to confirm the
switching of the C2 communication mode.
#### 7.4.2.5 UAS application specific server triggered C2 communication mode
switching
This procedure provides a mechanism for supporting dynamic switching between
direct or network assisted C2 communications to UTM-Navigated, initiated by
the UAS application specific server (which can be the USS/UTM) after detecting
a C2 switching condition which may be required while the UAV enters a no-fly
zone. For example, the UAS application specific server needs to take over the
control of UAV and fly it to safety (see 3GPP TS 22.125 [2] clause 4.2).
Figure 7.4.2.5-1 illustrates a UAS application specific server triggered C2
communication mode switching.
Pre-conditions:
1\. UAE Server has activated the dynamic C2 mode switching capability, as
described in clause 7.4.2.1.
2\. UAE Client has selected a primary C2 communication mode as described in
clause 7.4.2.3, and UAV and UAV-C are engaged in (e.g., direct or network
assisted) C2 communication.
Figure 7.4.2.5-1: UAS application specific server triggered C2 communication
mode switching
1\. The UAS application specific client is instructed directly by a command
from the UAS application specific server to switch to UTM-Navigated mode.
NOTE: This procedure between the UAS application specific server and the UAS
application specific client is out of scope of the present document.
2\. The UAE Client initiates the procedure described in clause 7.4.2.4.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Support for edge deployments
The application architecture for supporting edge applications are specified in
3GPP TS 23.558 [7]. The UAS application layer as specified in clause 5 can be
deployed in edge computing environment.
Figure A-1 illustrates a UAS application layer deployment in edge computing
environments.
Figure A-1: UAS application layer deployment in edge computing environment
Figure A-1 illustrates how the UAS application architecture with EDGEAPP
support for edge deployments can be deployed. In a UE, the UAS application
specific client(s), UAE client and SEAL clients interact with the Edge Enabler
Client (EEC) via EDGE-5 reference point in order to consume edge services. In
an Edge Data Network (EDN), the UAS application specific server(s), UAE server
and SEAL servers acting as Edge Application Server (EAS), interacts with the
Edge Enabler Server (EES) via EDGE-3 reference point. The service provisioning
and EAS discovery enable the UAS application layer entities in the UE to
communicate with the application layer entities in the EDN. The interactions
between the entities and 5GS are not shown for the sake of simplicity.
NOTE: This clause illustrates an example edge deployment using edge enabler
layer. There can be other valid edge deployments enabled for UAS application
layer.
###### ## Annex B (Informative): Deployment models
## B.1 General
This clause describes deployments of the functional model specified in clause
5. The reference points utilized from underlying 3GPP network as specified in
clause 5.5 is represented as 3GPP interfaces in the deployment models.
NOTE: The representation of SEAL functionalities in the vertical deployment is
specified in 3GPP TS 23.434 [5].
## B.2 Deployment of UAE server
The UAE server deployments can be centralized and distributed.
### B.2.1 Centralized deployments
A centralized deployment is where a single UAE server offers the UAE
capabilities to one or more UAS application specific servers (e.g. USS/UTM).
The UAE server and the UAS application specific server can be co-located in a
single physical entity. The UAE server can be deployed either in the PLMN
operator domain or deployed in the UAS operator domain. The UAE server
connects with the 3GPP network systems (EPS, 5GS) in one or more PLMN operator
domain. When UAE server and UAS application specific server are co-located in
a single physical entity, the Us reference point between the UAE server and
the UAS application specific server is not used.
Figure B.2.1-1 illustrates a deployment of the UAE server and the UAS
application specific server in a single physical entity and deployed in UAS
operator domain. The UAE server can be deployed in a separate physical entity
from the UAS application specific server in the UAS operator domain. In such
deployments, the Us reference point is used for the communication between the
UAE server and the UAS application specific server.
Figure B.2.1-1: UAE server co-located with UAS application specific server in
a single physical entity
Figure B.2.1-2 illustrates a deployment of the UAE server in the PLMN operator
domain and the UAS application specific server in the UAS operator domain. The
Us reference point is used for the communication between UAS application
specific server and the UAE server. The UAE server can support multiple UAS
application specific servers.

systems in multiple PLMN operator domains
Figure B.2.1â€‘4 illustrates a deployment of the UAE server which provides UAE
capabilities to multiple UAS application specific servers over Us reference
point and connects to the 3GPP network systems (EPS, 5GS) in multiple PLMN
operator domain.
Figure B.2.1-4: Deployment of UAE server with connections to multiple UAS
application specific servers
### B.2.2 Distributed deployment
The distributed deployment is where multiple UAE servers are deployed either
in the UAS operator domain or in the PLMN operator domain. The distributed
deployment of the UAE servers provide geographical coverage or support
multiple PLMN operator domains in a geographical location. The UAE servers
interconnect via UAE-E and the Us reference point is used for interaction
between UAS application specific server and the UAE server.
Figure B.2.2-1 illustrates the deployment of UAE servers in multiple PLMN
operator domain and provides UAE capabilities to the UAS application specific
server deployed in the UAS operator domain. The UAS application specific
server connects via Us to the UAE servers.
Figure B.2.2-1: Distributed deployment of UAE servers in multiple PLMN
operator domain without interconnection between UAE servers
Figure B.2.2-2 illustrates the deployment of multiple UAE servers deployed in
multiple PLMN operator domains. The UAS application specific server connects
via Us to the UAE server. The interconnection between UAE servers is via UAE-E
and supports the UAS applications for the UAS UEs connected to the UAE servers
in multiple PLMN operator domains.

operator domain with interconnection between UAE servers
Figure B.2.2-3 illustrates the deployment of multiple UAE servers in PLMN
operator domain based on geographical coverage. The UAS application specific
server connects via Us to the UAE server 1. The UAE servers interconnect via
UAE-E and support the UAS communications to the UAS UEs (i.e., UAV, UAV-C)
connected to the UAE servers.

Figure B.2.2-4 illustrates the deployment of multiple UAE servers in the UAS
operator domain where UAE server 1 and UAE server 2 connect with 3GPP network
system of PLMN operator domain 1 and PLMN operator domain 2 respectively. The
UAS application specific server connects via Us to the UAE server 1. The UAE
servers interconnect via UAE-E and support the UAS applications for the UAS
UEs connected via both the PLMN operator domains.

###### ## Annex C (informative): Examples of usage of SEAL by UAS application
specific server
All procedures of SEAL services (e.g. GMS, LMS) are available directly for
usage by UAS application specific server. Some examples of the usage of SEAL
by the UAS application specific server is illustrated below:
\- Group creation procedures of Group Management server provides support for
the UAS applications (e.g. paired UAV and UAV-C are grouped) to provide a
dedicated group for the UAV and UAV-C to communicate with each other.
\- The UAS application specific server (e.g. USS/UTM) monitors the presence of
UAVs in a given geographic area by using the Monitoring Location Deviation
procedure of the LM server.
\- The UAS application specific server (e.g. USS/UTM) can directly fetch the
multiple UAV related events from NRM server (e.g. to detect any events related
to the UAV, the UAS application specific server can need multiple events
related to the UAV (UE) from the 3GPP core network).
\- The UAS application specific client and UAS application specific server can
utilize the resource management procedures of the NRM server to manage unicast
resources associated to SIP sessions.
