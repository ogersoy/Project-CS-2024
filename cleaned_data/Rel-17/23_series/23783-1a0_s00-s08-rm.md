# Introduction
## General
In the release 13, 14 and 15 timeframe a functional architecture, procedures
and information flows have been developed to provide MC services over LTE,
using E-UTRAN access based on the EPC architecture. The present document is a
study into the impacts on and the necessary changes in the Stage 2 Mission
Critical specifications to ensure that the set of Mission Critical services is
supported over the 5GS.
## Method
The Mission Critical specifications TS 23.280, TS 23.379, TS 23.281, TS 23.282
and TS 23.283 were reviewed, looking for terms and reference documents that
are E-UTRAN/EPS specific. The following list was identified:
\- UE-R, UE-to-network relay;
\- EPC-level roaming;
\- GCSE_LTE, MBMS, BM-SC, MB2-U, MB2-C, GC1, TMGI, MBSFN, ECGI, SAI, TS
23.246, TS 23.468, TS‑29.468;
\- PC5, ProSe, TS 23.303;
\- APN, PAP, CHAP;
\- QCI, TS 23.203; and
\- LTE, EPS, EPC, E-UTRAN, eNB, TS 23.401, TS 36.300, GSMA PRD IR.88, TS
36.331, HSS
Occurrences of these terms and reference documents are highlighted in copies
of the TS documents in the Annexes of the present document.
It was recognised that TS 23.280 has a lot of areas with E-UTRAN/EPS specific
terminology, while TS 23.379, TS 23.281 and TS 23.282 also have considerable
amount. TS 23.283 has hardly any E-UTRAN/EPS specific terminology.\ It was
also recognised that some clauses could be modified without difficulty to make
them also applicable to 5GS while (many) other clauses will require further
technical analysis due to differences in architecture and supported
functionality between E-UTRAN/EPS and 5GS.
It was decided to individually document proposals for the easy terminology
changes and to condense the clauses affected by differences in architecture
and supported functionality into key issues.
## Document structure
The present document is structured as follows:
\- Clause 4 proposes changes to clauses in the Mission Critical Specifications
that are identified to be also applicable to 5GS and that only require
terminology changes;
\- Clause 5 highlights key issues;
\- Clause 6 describes the solutions that address the key issues;
\- The evaluation of the solutions is described in clause 7; and
\- Clause 8 contains the conclusions of this report.
# 1 Scope
The present document analyses how to ensure that the set of Mission Critical
services is supported over the 5GS. Key issues are derived and solutions are
developed for the impacts on existing or new Stage 2 Mission Critical
specifications.

# 4 Subclauses in Mission Critical Specifications containing E-UTRAN/EPS
specific terminology
## 4.1 Introduction
This clause contains text proposals for clauses in the Mission Critical
specifications that currently contain E‑UTRAN/EPS specific terminology, which
are identified to be also applicable to 5GS and that will only require
terminology changes or minor extensions to make them applicable to 5GS.
## 4.2 TS 23.280
### 4.2.1 Proposed change to 1 Scope
This document specifies the common functional architecture, procedures and
information flows needed to support mission critical services including the
common services core architecture.
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2], 3GPP
TS 22.280 [3], 3GPP TS 22.281 [4] and 3GPP TS 22.282 [5].
The present document is applicable primarily to mission critical services
using E-UTRAN access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401
[17] [and using 5GS access based on the 5G System architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.501 [X]]{.underline}. Certain MC service functions such as dispatch and
administrative functions could also be supported via non-3GPP access networks
but no additional functionality is specified to support non-3GPP access.
The common functional architecture to support mission critical services can be
used for public safety applications and also for general commercial
applications e.g. utility companies and railways.
### 4.2.2 Proposed change to 2 References
Add reference:
[[X] 3GPP TS 23.501: \"System Architecture for the 5G System\".]{.underline}
[[Y] 3GPP TS 33.501: \"Security architecture and procedures for 5G System
\".]{.underline}
### 4.2.3 Proposed change to 3.2 Abbreviations
Insert abbreviation:
[5GC 5G Core Network]{.underline}
### 4.2.4 Proposed change to 4 Introduction
A common functional architecture to support MC services (i.e., MCPTT defined
in 3GPP TS 23.379 [16], MCVideo defined in 3GPP TS 23.281 [12], MCData defined
in 3GPP TS 23.282 [13]) including common application plane and signalling
plane entities is specified in this document.
Each MC service supports several types of communications amongst the users
(e.g. group call, private call). There are several common functions and
entities (e.g. group, configuration, identity) which are used by the MC
services.
The common functional architecture to support MC services utilises aspects of
the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9], the Proximity-based
Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [14], the Group
Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.468 [18] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS
23.237 [10].
The MC service UE primarily obtains access to a MC service via E-UTRAN, using
the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [17] [and using 5GS access
based on the 5G System architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.501
[X]]{.underline}. Certain MC service functions such as dispatch and
administrative functions can be supported using either MC service UEs in
E-UTRAN[, using MC service UEs in 5GS]{.underline} or using MC service UEs via
non-3GPP access networks. External applications usage of MC services can be
enabled via E-UTRAN[, 5GS]{.underline} or non-3GPP access networks.
NOTE: Dispatch consoles and devices used by MC service administrators are
considered MC service UEs in the common functional architecture to support MC
services.
### 4.2.5 Proposed change to 9.2.1.1 On-network architectural model diagram
Figure 9.2.1.1-1 below is the on-network architectural model for the MC system
solution, where the MC system provides one or more MC services via a single
PLMN.
Figure 9.2.1.1-1: On-network architectural model
### 4.2.6 Proposed change to 9.2.1.4 ~~EPS~~[E-UTRAN or 5G System]{.underline}
The ~~EPS~~[E-UTRAN or 5G System]{.underline} provides point-to-point and
point-to-multipoint bearer services with QoS.
### 4.2.7 Proposed change to 10.12.1 General
Mission critical priority and QoS management is situational. The MC Services
provides a real-time priority and QoS experience for the MC users, who have
significant dynamic operational requirements that determine their priority.
For example, the type of incident a responder is serving or the responder\'s
overall shift role needs to strongly influence a user\'s ability to obtain
resources from the ~~LTE system~~[E-UTRAN or 5G System]{.underline}.
Priority treatment applies on both application layer as well as on transport
layer. The details on how the priority level is evaluated and used is outside
the scope of this specification. What is specified is the necessary mechanisms
to apply the priority and QoS and map different priority parameters between
different entities, for example to map application layer priority to transport
layer priority.
One of the requirements for MC communication services is to coordinate the use
of priority levels between the different MC service servers. This priority
coordination is used to mitigate and manage the risk for network congestion
situations.

Editor\'s note: Proposed modification to cover both 4G and 5GS, using
highlighting, hard-strikeout of removed text and hard-underlining for new
text.
## 4.3 TS 23.281
### 4.3.1 Proposed change to 1 Scope
This document specifies the functional model, procedures and information flows
needed for the mission critical video (MCVideo) service. Support for both
MCVideo group streaming and MCVideo private streaming operating in on-network
and off-network modes of operation is specified.
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.280 [2], and
3GPP TS 22.281 [3].
The present document is applicable primarily to mission critical video service
~~using E-UTRAN access~~ based on the common functional architecture for
mission critical services defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6][,]{.underline} ~~and~~
using the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8] [ and the 5G System
architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [X]]{.underline}.
The MCVideo service can be used for public safety applications and also for
general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.
### 4.3.2 Proposed change to 2 References
Add reference:
[[X] 3GPP TS 23.501: \"System Architecture for the 5G System\".]{.underline}
### 4.3.3 Proposed change to 6.2.2.2 Common services core

functional architecture for MC services ~~over LTE~~ in 3GPP TS 23.280 [6].
### 4.3.X Proposed change to \ \
Editor\'s note: Proposed modification to cover both 4G and 5GS, using
highlighting, hard-strikeout of removed text and hard-underlining for new
text.
## 4.4 TS 23.282
### 4.4.1 Proposed change to 1 Scope
This document specifies the functional architecture, procedures and
information flows needed to support the Mission Critical Data (MCData)
services. MCData is a suite of services which utilizes the common functional
architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] to support MC services ~~over LTE
including the common services core~~.
MCData services suite consists of the following sub-services:
\- short data service (SDS);
\- file distribution (FD.
MCData features include:
\- conversation management;
\- transmission and reception control;
\- communication release; and
\- enhanced status.
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.282 [3] and
3GPP TS 22.280 [2].
The present document is applicable primarily to MCData service using E-UTRAN
access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [4] [ and using
5GS access based on the 5G System architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.501
[X]]{.underline}. Certain application functions of the MCData service could
also be supported via non-3GPP access networks but no additional functionality
is specified to support non-3GPP access.
The MCData service can be used for public safety applications and also for
general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.
### 4.4.2 Proposed change to 2 References
Add reference:
[[X] 3GPP TS 23.501: \"System Architecture for the 5G System\".]{.underline}
### 4.4.3 Proposed change to 4 Introduction
The MCData service suite provides a set of generic capabilities and specific
services to enable one-to-one and group data communications between MCData
users.
The MCData architecture utilises the common functional architecture to support
mission critical services ~~over LTE~~ defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] and
aspects of the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6], the Proximity-
based Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7], the Group
Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.468 [8], the Security of the Mission Critical Service in 3GPP TS 33.180
[13] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.237 [9] to
enable support of the MCData service.
The MCData UE primarily obtains access to the MCData service via E-UTRAN,
using the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [4] [ and using 5GS
access based on the 5G System architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.501
[X]]{.underline}. Certain application functions of MCData service can be
accessed using MCData UEs via non-3GPP access networks.
The MCData system provides the function to support interworking with LMR
systems defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [18].
### 4.4.X Proposed change to \ \
Editor\'s note: Proposed modification to cover both 4G and 5GS, using
highlighting, hard-strikeout of removed text and hard-underlining for new
text.
## 4.5 TS 23.283
### 4.5.1 Proposed change to 10.6.2.6 Emergency private call
An emergency private call to an LMR user will have emergency priority for the
portion of the call transported in the MCPTT system and the ~~LTE
EPS~~[E-UTRAN or 5G System]{.underline} but will not receive priority on the
LMR system in LMR systems that do not support emergency treatment for private
calls.
### 4.5.X Proposed change to \ \
Editor\'s note: Proposed modification to cover both 4G and 5GS, using
highlighting, hard-strikeout of removed text and hard-underlining for new
text.
## 4.6 TS 23.379
### 4.6.1 Proposed change to 1 Scope
This document specifies the functional architecture, procedures and
information flows needed to support the mission critical push to talk (MCPTT)
service. The MCPTT service utilizes the common functional architecture to
support MC services ~~over LTE~~ including the common services core defined in
3GPP TS 23.280 [16].Support for both MCPTT group calls and MCPTT private calls
operating in on-network and off-network modes of operation is specified.
The corresponding service requirements are defined in 3GPP TS 22.179 [2] and
3GPP TS 22.280 [17].
The present document is applicable primarily to MCPTT voice service using
E-UTRAN access based on the EPC architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8] [
and using 5GS access based on the 5G System architecture defined in 3GPP TS
23.501 [X]]{.underline}. Certain application functions of the MCPTT service
such as dispatch and administrative functions could also be supported via
non-3GPP access networks but no additional functionality is specified to
support non-3GPP access.
The MCPTT service requires preferential handling compared to normal
telecommunication services e.g. in support of police or fire brigade including
the handling of prioritised MCPTT calls for emergency and imminent threats.
The MCPTT service can be used for public safety applications and also for
general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.
In the present document, MCPTT calls between MCPTT users on different MCPTT
systems are considered.

### 4.6.4 Proposed change to 4 Introduction
The MCPTT service supports communication between several users (i.e. group
call), where each user has the ability to gain access to the permission to
talk in an arbitrated manner. The MCPTT service also supports private calls
between two users.
The MCPTT architecture utilises the common functional architecture to support
mission critical services ~~over LTE~~ defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] and
aspects of the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5], the Proximity-
based Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7], the Group
Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.468 [9] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS
23.237 [6] to enable support of the MCPTT service.
The MCPTT UE primarily obtains access to the MCPTT service via E-UTRAN, using
the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8] [ and using 5GS access
based on the 5G System architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.501
[X]]{.underline}. Certain application functions of MCPTT service such as
dispatch and administrative functions can be supported using either MCPTT UEs
in E-UTRAN[, using MCPTT UEs in 5GS]{.underline} or using MCPTT UEs via
non-3GPP access networks.
NOTE: Dispatch consoles and devices used by MCPTT service administrators are
considered MCPTT UEs in the MCPTT architecture.
MCPTT UEs that use non-3GPP access can only support a subset of the
functionality specified in this specification that is supported by the
non-3GPP access network.
The MCPTT system provides the function to support interworking with LMR
systems defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [20].

# 5 Key issues to ensure support of Mission Critical services over 5GS
## 5.1 Key issue 1: Service continuity between on-network MC services and UE-
to-network relay MC service
### 5.1.1 Description
Service continuity between on-network MC services and UE-to-network relay MC
services is currently not supported by 5GS.
This has impact to:
\- TS 23.280 subclause 5.1.1, 5.2.3, 8.3.1, 9.2.1.5, 9.2.1.6, 10.5.1, 10.5.2,
10.7.3.7.3, Annex B.1
The search terms to create the above list are: UE-R and UE-to-network relay.
Occurrences of these terms have been highlighted in a copy of the TS in annex
A of this report.
### 5.1.2 Architectural requirements
Editor\'s Note: Capture agreements on architectural requirements for solving
the key issue. This clause may be omitted if deemed unnecessary.
## 5.2 Key issue 2: 5GC level roaming
### 5.2.1 Description
5GC level roaming is FFS.
This has impact to:
\- TS 23.280 subclause 5.2.2, 5.2.9.2, 9.4
Occurrences of the term EPC-level roaming have been highlighted in a copy of
the TS in annex A of this report.
### 5.2.2 Architectural requirements
Editor\'s Note: Capture agreements on architectural requirements for solving
the key issue. This clause may be omitted if deemed unnecessary.
## 5.3 Key issue 3: Use of multicast
### 5.3.1 Description
Multicast/broadcast is a very critical feature for public safety related group
communication. The mission critical services over LTE benefit from the use of
multicast/broadcast. Multicast/Broadcast capabilities are expected to be
important in 5GS for mission critical applications.
The support of multicast/broadcast in 5GS is FFS. The lack of
multicast/broadcast support in 5GS will almost certainly impact the ability to
support mission critical services over 5GS.
This has impact to:
\- TS 23.280 subclause 5.2.1, 5.2.6, 5.2.7.1, 7.2, 7.3.1, 7.4.2.3.2, 7.5.3.2,

7.5.2.10, 10.6.2.5.2.4, 10.9.1.6, all of 10.10;
\- TS 23.281 subclause 5.5.4, 6.1.1, 6.2.2.3.2, 6.3.4B, 6.3.6, 6.3.7, all of
7.10; and
\- TS 23.282 subclause 5.4, 5.8.4, 5.12, 6.4.3.1.2, 6.4.4.1.4, 6.5.4.1.3,
6.6.4.1.3, 6.6.4.1.5, 6.7.4.1.3, all of 7.3, 7.5.2.1.11, 7.5.2.1.21,
7.5.2.7.2, 7.5.2.10.1, 7.5.2.10.2, 7.7.2.2.2.1, 7.7.2.3.2.1
The search terms to create the above list are: GCSE_LTE, MBMS, BM-SC, MB2-U,
MB2-C, GC1, TMGI, TMGIs, MBSFN, ECGI, SAI, SAIs, TS 23.246, TS 23.468 and TS

## 5.8 Key issue 8: Determine impacts of 5GS network slicing to MC services
### 5.8.1 Description
Network slicing will allow tailored networks for each individual
usage/organisation/service. Mission critical organizations with a high
diversity among the required services for daily operations would require
adapted performance provided by 5GS network slices.
The future mission critical communication will be based on adaptations to
reflect the individual needs. The current discussed and defined
functionalities have to be reflected on the given possibilities with 5GS
network slices. The following operative-tactical considerations have to be
taken into account by analysing and evaluating mission critical
functionalities and their usage within 5GS network slices. These aspects can
be either used separately or even in combination, which can multiple the
degrees of freedom on which mission critical functionalities have to perform.
A Service (MCPTT, MCData, MCVideo, MCIoT, etc.)
Figure 5.8.1-1 shows a service based approach to utilize mission critical
services. While these mission critical services are maybe isolated operated
within separated 5GS network slices including different RAN access, the
synchronisation between the media of each mission critical service still has
to be achieved. The synchronisation of separated 5GS network slices is
therefore a new technical design aspect of mission critical functionalities.
The following aspect is identified:
\- How a mission critical service based approach can be realized by utilizing
mission critical functionalities designed for a non 5GS network slice
environment.
Figure 5.8.1-1: Example of a service based approach
B Situation (every day, ad-hoc, major crisis, etc.)
5GS network slices can also be used in different situation, where mission
critical functionalities have to be extended or additional mission critical
services have to be provided. The mission critical architecture has to support
such utilization, while the dynamic and scopes are highly flexible.
The following aspect is identified:
\- How mission critical services can be utilized in a very territorial
flexible and dynamic manner.
C Location (nationwide average, city, industrial sides, rural areas, etc.)
Overlapping mission critical services based on the location and how these
functionalities will interact with each other is another degree of freedom, by
using 5GS network slices in combination with mission critical functionalities.
The following aspect is identified:
\- How mission critical services can be utilized in deployments with
separated, overlapping, different scope of functions, etc. areas.
D Duration (permanent, temporary)
Recovering data from a temporary utilization of a 5GS network slice for
mission critical purposes is a new aspect to be reflected by the mission
critical architecture. Each part of information shared, created, collected,
etc. during operation has to be made available for future use, mission
evaluation, other organizations, etc..
The following aspect is identified:
\- How mission critical services can be utilized in a very temporal flexible
manner, compared to a permanent use.
Gaps:
\- How mission critical identities can be utilized across different mission
critical 5GS network slices, e.g. MC IDs, MC service IDs, MC service group
IDs, etc.
\- How mission critical entities can be utilized across different mission
critical 5GS network slices, e.g. group management, identity management,
location management, etc.
\- How the addressing of MC service client information can be realized across
different mission critical 5GS network slices, e.g. location information
reports, etc.
\- How synchronisation of mission critical signalling and media across
different mission critical 5GS network slices can be realized, e.g. MCPTT to
MCVideo, MCVideo to MCData, MCPTT to MCData, etc.
\- How security mechanisms across different mission critical 5GS network
slices either with slice isolation or without can be realized, e.g. end-to-end
encryption, etc.
\- How scalability adaptions of the mission critical services provided over
5GS network slices can be realized, e.g. adding other mission critical
services to the already used one, increasing or reducing performance of
mission critical services, etc.
\- How the utilization of mission critical identities and information can be
realized, e.g. location information, created during a temporal utilization of
5GS network slices.

## 5.9 Key issue 9: IP-based wireline access to MC System located on 5GS
### 5.9.1 Description
Figure 5.9.1-1: One possible example of IP-based wireline access - Control
room architecture with connection to an MC System located on 5GS
Control rooms facilitate the infrastructure and working equipment for numerous
dispatchers to solve the daily operation and special missions. It must be
ensured that Mission Critical organisation´s control rooms have access to the
MC System when the 5GS technology is applied. Mission critical networks and
the control room (as the steering and managing part of it) have to be failsafe
and always be accessible. To reach these goals the most preferred interfacing
method for control rooms to mobile networks is based on a wired connection
beside wireless access which is mainly used in special scenarios or in absence
of fixed line infrastructure. A standardised interface is required between the
MC systems running on 5GS and the control room´s access networks.
Besides access via air interface, the IP-based wireline access protects not
only the dispatchers in case of an air interface failure, but also the users
under the supervision of a dispatcher or multiple dispatchers behind a
concentration point.
Editor\'s Note: The exact gaps need to be further analysed.

## 5.10 Key issue 10: Low latency and user/media plane capabilities
### 5.10.1 General
Various applications have different requirements regarding the latency of the
user data information, e.g. 3GPP TS 22.289 [15]. Specifically, in the data
area these vary in the range between ≤10ms up to a few hundred milliseconds.
In order to meet these extremely low latency requirements, Following the
current approach, bundled management of control plane and user plane may
require a large number of MC service servers in order to cater for a large
number of low latency transitions.
### 5.10.2 Potential gaps
The following aspects and potential gaps are identified :
\- Missing low latency user/media plane support
\- Necessary architectural adjustments that allows the unbundling of control
plane and media plane;
\- Necessary reference points that enables unbundled management between
user/media plane and control plane;
\- Necessary procedures and flows for unbundling control and media plane;
\- Necessary mechanisms for media plane relocation (PDU session relocation);
\- Study how to support the extremely low latency varying in the range between
≤10ms up to a few hundred milliseconds in MCData;
\- Study how to handle user migration while utililizing detached IPcon
capability function from the MC Service Server;

## 5.11 Key issue 11: MC system supporting MC service UEs accessing through
both 5GC and EPC
### 5.11.1 General
Deployment of 5G network may last a long time, and in the initial deployment
stage 5G network is not providing good coverage. There is scenario that some
MC service UEs accessing MC system through EPC while other MC service UEs
accessing MC system through 5GC (some dual mode UEs may accessing MC system
through EPC and 5G core simultaneously) and thus it leads to the requirement
on MC system to support MC service UEs accessing through both 5GC and EPC
concurrently.
### 5.11.2 Potential gaps
The following aspects and potential gaps are identified :
\- Necessary architectural requirements and functional enhancements to allow
one MC system to support MC service UEs accessing MC services through both 5GC
and EPC concurrently;
## 5.12 Key issue 12: Service continuity of MC UE mobility between MC system
over 5GS and EPC
### 5.12.1 General
Deployment of 5G network may last a long time, at least in the initial
deployment stage 5G network is not providing good coverage. There is scenario
that MC service UE in process of MC services (e.g. group call) moves across
boundary between 4G network service area and 5G network service area (It is
assumed that MC service UEs should support both EPC and 5GC network accessing
capability). The MC service UE mobility between EPC and 5GC may lead to IP
packets transmission interruption of signaling plane and media plane, which at
last affects service continuity perceived by application layer.
### 5.12.2 Potential gaps
The following aspects and potential gaps are identified :
\- Necessary architectural requirements and functional enhancements that
improves MC service continuity during MC service UE mobility between EPC and
5GC;
## 5.13 Key issue 13: MC service over 5G MBS
### 5.13.1 Description
The 5G multicast-broadcast service is specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
Editor\'s note: Some details is still under progress in SA2 and should be
considered if applicable for MC service. And the 5G MBS functionalities in
other working groups, e.g., SA4, SA3 and RAN, are still FFS and also need to
be considered if applicable.
The figure 5.13.1-1 is the 5G MBS system architecture defined in TS 23.247
[19] with new functions (e.g. MB-SMF, MB-UPF, MBSF, MBSTF) and new reference
points (e.g., Nmbsmf, Nmbsf), wherein the MBSF and MBSTF are optional
depending on the required functionalities and the MBSF may be collocated with
the NEF. The figure 5.13.1-2 is the 5G MBS architecture in reference point
representation. Furthermore, figure 5.13.1-3 the 5G MBS architecture which
enables eMBMS and 5G MBS inter-system service continuity as described in 3GPP
TS 23.247 [19].
This reference architecture support two modes: Transport Only Mode, and the
Full-Service Mode as defined in TS 23.246 [19]. Functionality may be different
for the two service modes.
Figure 5.13.1-1 5G MBS system architecture in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
Figure 5.13.1-2: 5G MBS system architecture in reference point representation
in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
Three configuration variants are specified with the reference architecture to
allow the AF/AS to interact with 5G core network.
Editor\'s note: Potential update to the architecture and reference point
towards the AF/AS is FFS in order to align with the latest SA2 5G MBS
architecture accordingly.
Figure 5.13.1-3: 5G MBS-eMBMS interworking system architecture at service
layer as in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
Based on the progress of 3GPP TS 23.247, there are several aspects that need
to be considered for MC service when utilizing the 5G MBS, including but not
limited to:
1) identify 5G MBS features and configuration options which are applicable for
MC service;
2) how and when to use the broadcast and multicast service for the group
communication;
3) how to make the group members aware of the broadcast/multicast service for
the group communication;
4) how to maintain the service continuity when switching between 5G MBS
delivery and unicast delivery;
5) how the DL media, application level control signalling (e.g., floor control
messages), group status is delivered to the UE via the 5G MBS.
6) whether and how the MC services require the local 5G MBS services. And if
required, how the MC service group communication is associated with the
broadcast/multicast service area.
7) how and when service requirements, e.g., required QoS requirements, are
provided to the 5GC for MC service group communication data transmitted over
5G MBS sessions for both broadcast and multicast.
8) how to support the service continuity when the MC service is provided via
both 4G eMBMS and 5G MBS?
9) identify the MC service application architecture supporting 5G MBS
10) identify the functionalities related to 5G MBS sessions for group
communication purposes, and address the differences between broadcast and
multicast sessions
11) how to de-announce the MBS session for the group members and subsequently
remove the MBS session
12) how the DL data and application-level control signalling is delivered for
specific MC services, e.g., MCPTT and MCVideo
13) how the MC service server can modify, i.e., update an MBS session with
aspects related to media and service requirements, included service area, or
update its status if applicable

5.14 Key issue 14: MC service over 5G ProSe
### 5.14.1 Description
The 5G ProSe service is specified in 3GPP TS 23.304 [21].
5G ProSe supports both the public safety service and commercial service. The
following features are supported in 5G Prose:
\- Authorization and Provisioning;
\- Direct Discovery;
\- Direct Communication including unicast, groupcast and broadcast;
\- UE-to-Network Relay (i.e., Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay or Layer-3 UE-to-
Network Relay) Discovery;
\- UE-to-Network Relay Communication via Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay or
Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay.
The figure 5.14.1-1 is the 5G system architecture for ProSe Services defined
in TS 23.304 [21]. In this architecture, 5G DDNMF supports dynamic 5G ProSe
Direct Discovery, and PCF provides the Authorization policy and parameters for
5G ProSe Direct Discovery and Communication, and Authorization policy and
parameters for 5G UE-to-Network Relay Discovery and Communication.
{width="4.21875in" height="4.260416666666667in"}
Figure 5.14.1-1 5G system architecture for ProSe in TS 23.304
The requirements on off network defined in TS 22.280, 22.179, 22.281, and
22.282 are mainly on following aspects :
\- provisioning for using off network MCX service;
\- off network group communication;
\- off network private communication;
\- Priority and communication type;
\- UE-to-UE relay and UE-to-Network Relay；
In MC service over 4G ProSe, the following features are designed based on the
SA1 requirements:
\- off network configurations in the UE configuration data, group
configuration data, user profile configuration;
\- off-network group call;
\- off-network private call;
\- supporting of UE-to-Network Relay.
Considering the 5G Prose, MC service requirements on off-network and MC
service over 4G prose, the following aspects and potential gaps are
identified:
1) Which 5G ProSe features are required by MC services;
2) Based on 1), how those features are used by MC service;
3) Whether the existing MC service over 4G prose procedures can be reused? if
can, if any necessary changes are needed?

## 5.15 Key issue 15: Use of 5QI\'s
### 5.15.1 Description
MC services usually use predefined 5QIs. MCData and potentially also MCVideo
QoS requirements are more diverse than those for MCPTT. In MCData requirements
in the context of packet latency and packet loss may vary, depending on the
application characteristics and therefore diverse transmission characteristics
can be expected.
The current approach of 5QI 70 only for the use by MC Data service
capabilities with a latency budget of 200ms in accordance to 3GPP TS 23.501
[10] and a reliability requirement (packet loss) of 10^-6^ and its application
is more of a deterministic interpretation. Operating all MCData service
capabilities exclusively with 5QI 70, the same queue is used in the
corresponding gNB scheduler and multiple MCData transport flows can only be
differentiated on the basis of priority. For example, a SDS exchange does not
usually require a packet loss of 10^-6^, but control command signalling
applications e.g. for train protection, depending on the degree of automation,
a latency budget range between 10ms and 200ms is required. The aim of the key
issue is to scrutinize whether other 5QIs can also be used for MCData service
capabilities and MCVideo capabilities.
The following issues will be addressed:
\- Does MCData only require the defined 5QI 70, or
\- Does MCVideo only require the defined 5QIs 67 and 4;
\- Can other predefined 5QIs used in accordance to 3GPP TS 23.501 used?
\- Potential use of operator-defined 5QIs for MCData and its influence on the
provision of transport resources.

# 6 Solutions to ensure support of Mission Critical services over 5GS
## 6.1 Solution 1: APN - Access to the Data Network
### 6.1.1 Description
#### 6.1.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue 5 on APN. For an adequate solution of key
issue 5, investigations and relevant adjustments for the area of QoS model are
also considered.
Hence, the present document describes the difference is required by 3GPP TR
23.793 between 4G EPS and 5GS in the context of:
\- EPS bearers versus 5G PDU sesssion;
\- Comparing the resouce control models and related QoS treatment;
\- APN allocation
\- Secondary authentication by DN-AAA server.
With 5GS, the perspective changes to the service-based architecture approach.
The resulting functions are addressed using reference points and support the
control and monitoring of the user transport services. With this realignment
in mind, adjustments are also required in the interaction between the MCX
service system and the 3GPP system in the 5GS context.
Hence, the following discource evaluates the differences between the EPS and
5GS and resulting adjustments in the 3GPP MC system specifications. The
following 3GPP Technical Specifications are included in the analysis:
\- 3GPP TS 23.003 [7];
\- 3GPP TS 23.401 [8];
\- 3GPP TS 23.203 [9];
\- 3GPP TS 23.501 [10];
\- 3GPP TS 23.502 [11];
\- 3GPP TS 23.503 [12]; and
\- 3GPP TS 33.501 [13].
#### 6.1.1.2 5GS Data Network (DN) access
A Data Network Name (DNN) is equivalent to an APN as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003
clause 9A and have an equivalent meaning and contains the same information.
In the 5GS context, a DNN can be used e.g. to:
\- Select the Session Management and User Plane for a PDU Session and its
corresponding N6 interface;
\- Determine policies that applies to the corresponding PDU Session.
#### 6.1.1.3 EPS versus 5GS QoS model
There are differnces in the QoS model between 4G EPS and 5GS. While the EPS
followed a rather rigid approach, 5GS uses a more flexible approach of
multiple different QoS flows within a PDU session as outlined in the figure
6.1.1.3‑1.
Figure 6.1.1.3-1 Differences between EPS and 5GS QoS model
An EPS bearer (3GPP TS 23.401) is the level of granularity for bearer level
QoS control in the EPC/E-UTRAN. That is, all traffic is mapped to the same EPS
bearer that receive the same bearer level packet forwarding treatment (e.g.
scheduling policy, queue management policy, rate shaping policy, RLC
configuration, etc.). Hence different bearer level packet forwarding
treatments require separate EPS bearers linked to the corresponding APNs
associated with a certain QoS profiles.
While an EPS Bearer with the priority, latency as well as packet error ratio
is firmly linked to the bearer, the QoS parameters migrate in the 5G QoS model
into individual flows which are detached from a bearer QoS. The 5G QoS model
(3GPP TS 23.501) is based on QoS flows that require guaranteed flow rate (GBR
QoS Flows) and QoS flows that do not require guaranteed flow rate (Non-GBR QoS
Flows). The QoS Flow is the finest granularity of QoS differentiation and uses
the QoS Flow ID (QFI) to identify a QoS flow in the 5G System. User Plane
traffic with the same QFI within a PDU Session receives the same traffic
forwarding treatment (e.g. scheduling, admission threshold). An QFI is used
for all PDU Session types and is unique within a PDU Session. The QFI may be
dynamically assigned or may be equal to a 5G QoS identifier (5QI). Within the
5GS, a QoS flow associated with the default QoS rule is required to be
established for a PDU Session and remains established throughout the lifetime
of the PDU Session. It can be concluded that each individual data packet
within the QoS flow can be provided with the QoS attributes. Hence, a QoS flow
is associated with QoS requirements (QoS Profile) as defined by QoS parameters
and QoS characteristics.
The parameter Allocation Retention Priority (ARP) contains information about
the priority level, the pre-emption capability and the pre-emption
vulnerability. The ARP priority level defines the relative importance of a
resource request and is independent to the priorities associated with the
QCIs/QIs. This allows deciding whether a bearer/flow establishment or
modification request can be accepted or needs to be rejected in case of
resource limitations (typically used for admission control of GBR traffic). It
can also be used to decide which existing bearers/flows are pre-empted during
transport resource limitations. The main difference between the use of ARP in
the EPS and 5GS case is that in EPS the ARP is available for the bearer and
thus applies to all users of the same bearer at the same time. In the case of
the 5GS, ARP can be used differently for each QFI and is therefore user-
specific and no longer bearer-specific.
Table 6.1.1.3-1 below compares the standardised QCI characteristics (3GPP TS
23.203 [9]) applicable within the EPS and the standardised QI characteristics
(3GPP TS 23.501 [10]) applicable for the 5GS. This consideration is limited to
the common signaling referenced by 3GPP TS 23.280 [2] and QCIs/QIs explicitely
used for MC services.

EPS QCI value | EPS Resource Type | EPS Priority Level | EPS Packet Delay Budget | EPS Packet Error Loss Rate | 5GS 5QI value | 5GS Resource Type | 5GS Default Priority Level | 5GS Packet Delay Budget | 5GS Packet Error Rate

From table 6.1.1.3-1 it can be seen that the QCI and its characteristics were
transferred one to one according to 5GS 5QI, with the exception that only
integer values were used for the priority level. Not shown in table 6.1.1.3-1,
the values for maximum data burst volume and averaging window were still
defined in the 5GS context, which are initially neglected in the rather
APN/architecture-driven consideration.
#### 6.1.1.4 Changes to the functional architecture
The Application Functions in the context with the MC system issues specific
requests that impact traffic steering e.g. QI handling for communication. The
5GS, in contrast to the EPC, uses the approaches based on service based
architecture. Accordingly, the interaction between AF and PCF is being
processed via the reference point N5.
#### 6.1.1.5 Data Network (DN) AAA Server authentication/authorization
An PDU Session establishment in the 5GS context to a DN may require
authentication/authorization the PDU Session establishment by an DN-AAA
Server. For this purpose, the user respectively the UE provides information
required to support user authentication by the DN over NAS session management.
After the successful DN authentication/authorization, a session is kept
between the 5GC and the DN-AAA. 3GPP TS 33.501 defines the use of EAP that is
controlled by the 5GC Session Management Function.
#### 6.1.1.6 Observation and conclusions
##### 6.1.1.6.1 Observation
An EPS bearer is limited in the flexibility of QoS handling in contrast to the
5GS model. The main distinguishing feature is the flexible use of the
priority, latency and reliability parameters in 5GS, which are not tied to a
bearer.
##### 6.1.1.6.2 Conclusion(s)
\- DNN(APN)
In the 5G QoS model, the flexibility within a PDU session is increased using
different applications and the associated different characteristics, i.e.
reliability and latency. The associated elimination of the rather strict
bearer to QoS profile approach would allow the use of a single DNN in the MC
service context.
For the backward compatibility from 5GS to EPS, the present APN approach
according to 3GPP TS 23.280 need to be maintained. For an 5GS only
environment, without considering the EPS backward compatibility, the number of
DNNs could be reduced. In addition, 3GPP TS 23.401 and also 3GPP TS 23.501
pursue the same approaches related to the PDU session type, e.g. IPv4 or IPv6.
\- Functional Model
> Due to the adapted 5GS interaction between AF and PCF via the reference
> point N5, an adjustment is proposed in the functional model for application
> plane and signalling plane in 3GPP TS 23.280.
\- QCI/QI values
> The individual values for latency, packet reliability etc. of the 5G QI
> definitions for MC services correspond to those of the EPS QCI definitions,
> with the exception that the priorities are only noted as integer values. To
> avoid possible overlaps between the application of QCI and 5G QI, dedicated
> chapters for the EPS and 5GS in 3GPP TS 23.280 are assumed.
\- Secondary authentication
Secondary authentication may be required using DN-AAA server (3GPP TS 23.501)
using EAP according to 3GPP TS 33.501.

##### 6.1.1.7.8 Proposed changes to 7.3.1 On-network functional model
Each MC service can be represented by an application plane functional model.
The functional model across MC services may be similar but is described by the
individual functional entities and reference points that belong to that MC
service. Within the application plane for an MC service there is a common set
of functions and reference points. The common set is shared across services.
This common set of functions and reference points is known as the common
services core.
Figure 7.3.1-1 shows the functional model for the application plane for an MC
system.
Figure 7.3.1-1: Functional model for application plane for an MC system using
EPS
The common services core functions and reference points shown in figure
7.3.1-1 are shared across each MC service. The description of the functions
and reference points specific to an MC service is contained in the
corresponding MC service TS.
In the model shown in figure 7.3.1-1, the following apply:
\- A specific MC service server is an instantiation of a GCS AS in accordance
with 3GPP TS 23.468 [18].
\- The functional alias management client is an integrated functional entity
of the configuration management client. The functional alias management client
is described in subclause 7.4.2.2.12.
\- The functional alias management server is an integrated functional entity
of the configuration management server. The functional alias management server
is described in subclause 7.4.2.2.13.

application plane of an MC service server and the signalling
plane.]{.underline}
Figure 7.3.1-3: Relationships between reference points of MC service
application plane and signalling control planes
NOTE 1: Application plane reference point CSC-7 makes use of SIP-2 reference
point when the group management servers are connected by a single SIP core.
Where they are joined by more than one SIP core, CSC-7 also makes use of the
SIP-3 reference point.
NOTE 2: For simplicity, the HTTP proxy, which provides the interconnection
between HTTP-1, HTTP-2 and HTTP-3 reference points, is not shown in figure
7.3.1-3.
NOTE 3: CSC-5, CSC-9, and CSC-15 make use of SIP-1 and SIP-2 reference points.
For simplicity, this mapping relationship is not shown in figure 7.3.1-3.
##### 6.1.1.7.9 Proposed changes to 10.1.1.1 MC service configuration on
primary MC system
Depicted in figure 10.1.1.1-1 is a MC service configuration time sequence of
the data related to specific MC service, representing the general lifecycle of
MC service UE using an MC service.
Figure 10.1.1.1-1 MC service UE configuration time sequence and associated
configuration data
The MC service UE is provided with initial UE configuration via a bootstrap
procedure that provides the MC service UE\'s clients (e.g. MC service client,
group management client, configuration management client, identity management
client, key management client, functional alias management client) with
critical information needed to connect to the MC system. This includes
PDN[/DN]{.underline} connection information corresponding to the configured MC
services on the MC service UE ([e.g.]{.underline} see \"EPS bearer
considerations\" in the 3GPP TS 23.379 [16]) and on-network server identity
information for all application plane servers with which the MC service UE
needs to interact. See annex A.6 for more information.
The MC service UE is provided with UE configuration, MC service user profile
configuration and group configuration via online configuration. While the MC
service UE is using the MC service it may receive online configuration
updates. If the MC service user profile configuration contains multiple MC
service user profiles for an authenticated MC service user, then the MC
service client and MC service server set the active MC service user profile to
the configured pre-selected MC service user profile after MC service
authorization (which can be updated by the MC service user using the procedure
specified in subclause 10.1.4.6). The active MC service user profile can be
changed by the MC service user to a different MC service user profile during
MC service service (see MC service TSs).
The MC service is configured with the service configuration (not shown in the
figure 10.1.1.1-1) which the MC service enforces during the entire phase of MC
service UE using the MC service.
Editor\'s note: The extent of MC services available to an MC service UE with
an unauthenticated MC user or unauthorized MC service user is described as
\'limited services\' in 3GPP TS 33.180 and is FFS.
Editor\'s note: The decision by the MC service UE to continue use of initial
configuration data after MC service authorisation or discontinue its use in
favour of configuration data obtained after MC service authorisation is FFS.
##### 6.1.1.7.10 Proposed changes to A.6 Initial MC service UE configuration
data
The initial MC service UE configuration data is essential to the MC service UE
to successfully connect to the MC system. The initial MC service UE
configuration data can be the same or different across MC service UEs.
Data in table A.6-1 is provided to the MC service UE\'s clients (e.g. MC
service client, group management client, configuration management client,
identity management client, key management client) during the bootstrap
process (see subclause 10.1.1), and can be configured on the MC service UE
offline using the CSC-11 reference point or via other means e.g. as part of
the MCPTT client\'s provisioning on the UE, using a device management
procedure.

The MCVideo UE shall use the APNs [or DNNs]{.underline} as defined in
subclause 5.2.7.0 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [6]. The MCVideo UE shall use the MC
services APN [or DNN]{.underline} as defined in subclause 5.2.7.0 of 3GPP TS
23.280 [6] for the SIP-1 reference point.
#### 6.1.1.9 Proposed changes to TS 23.282 5.8.1 General
The MCData UE shall use the APNs [or DNNs]{.underline} as defined in subclause
5.2.7.0 and table A.6-1 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5]. The MCData UE shall use the MC
services APN [or DNN]{.underline} as defined in subclause 5.2.7.0 and table
A.6-1 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] for the SIP-1 reference point.
#### 6.1.1.9a Proposed change to TS 23.282 7.13.6.2 Migration
A migrated MCData user may be provided with access to a local message store by
the partner MCData system of the migrated MCData user. The MCData user is
identified by the MCData ID used in the partner MCData system by that migrated
MCData user in order to access the message store. There is no connection
between this message store in the partner MCData system of the migrated MCData
user and any message store that the MCData user has access to in the primary
MCData system of that MCData user, and therefore access to a message store in
the partner MCData system does not provide a means of accessing stored content
in the primary MCData system of the migrated MCData user.
A migrated MCData user may be provided with a means of access to the message
store in the primary MCData system of that MCData user, e.g. by providing the
MCData user with a suitable APN[/DNN]{.underline} and appropriate IP routing,
or by use of the MCData IP connectivity service. Such access is outside the
scope of the present document.
#### 6.1.1.10 Proposed changes to TS 23.379 5.7.1 General
The MCPTT UE shall use the APNs [or DNNs]{.underline} as defined in subclause
5.2.7.0 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [16].
### 6.1.2 Solution evaluation
The proposed changes for the clauses 5.2.2, 5.2.7, 5.2.9, 7.3.1, and A.6
address the necessary adjustments for the area connectivity (DNN) and QoS in
order to operate the MC system using the 5GS. Hence, it is proposed to agree
the following changes to 3GPP TR 23.783 version 0.8.0.
## 6.2 Solution 2: Roaming aspects over 5GS
### 6.2.1 Description
### 6.2.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue 2 on 5GC level roaming.
The TS 23.501 [10] subclause 4.2.4 covers 5G System roaming models of:
> \- 5G System Roaming architecture -- Local Breakout (LBO), including
> reference point representation and service based interface representation.
>
> \- 5G System Roaming architecture -- Home Routed (HR), including reference
> point representation and service based interface representation.
The TS 23.228 [14] subclause Y.9.3 and M.3 specifies the architecture with
IMS-level roaming interfaces over 5GS, which includes voice over IMS with
local breakout.
In the above 5G roaming models the architectural requirements remain the same
with 4G roaming.
### 6.2.1.2 Proposed changes to TS 23.280 5.2.2 Roaming requirements
The MC applications can provide MC services to users in various PLMNs. [For MC
services over EPS, ~~R~~roaming]{.underline} is supported using EPC-level
roaming or IMS-level roaming. [ For MC services over 5GS, roaming is supported
using 5G System roaming or IMS-level roaming.]{.underline}
For EPC-level roaming [ and 5G System roaming]{.underline}, in order to
prioritise for network selection PLMNs that allow migration to partner MC
systems, the MC service UE\'s User Preferred PLMN Selector list (see 3GPP TS
22.011 [28]) may be configured with a list of PLMNs that can be used to
migrate to one or more partner MC systems (see subclause 5.2.9.2).
### 6.2.1.3 Proposed changes to TS 23.280 5.2.9 Migration
#### 6.2.1.3.1 Proposed changes to TS 23.280 5.2.9.2 PLMN utilisation
Migrated MC service users should utilise the HPLMN of the partner MC system to
access MC services in the partner MC system, however, utilising the HPLMN of
the primary MC system is not precluded.
NOTE 1: The above recommendation ensures the security policy of the partner MC
system is not compromised, the expected QCIs [ or 5QIs]{.underline} are used
on the RAN, and ensures service‑level delay requirements are consistently met
(which are especially at risk when the HPLMN of the primary MC system and
HPLMN of the partner MC system are far apart from a geographical point of
view).
NOTE 2: Whether the HPLMN of partner MC systems or the HPLMN of the primary MC
system is used to access MC services in partner MC systems is left to business
agreements between MC service providers, and is outside the scope of the
present document.
MC service users enabled for migration shall be provisioned with configuration
that specifies which PLMNs may be used to migrate to different MC systems.
If the HPLMN of a partner MC system is different from the HPLMN of the primary
MC system (i.e. migrating MC service users roam onto the HPLMN of the partner
MC system), then:
\- EPC‑level roaming [or 5G System roaming]{.underline} (see subclause 5.2.2)
is needed between the HPLMN of the primary MC system and HPLMN of the partner
MC system;
\- the HPLMN of the partner MC system needs to enable local break-out for the
APNs [ or DNNs]{.underline} specified in subclause 5.2.7 that identify the
PDNs [ or DNs]{.underline} of the partner MC system; and
\- the EPS [or 5GS]{.underline} subscriptions of the HPLMN of the primary MC
system utilised by the MC service users who are allowed to migrate to the
partner MC system need to be provisioned with, and local break-out enabled
for, the APNs [or DNNs]{.underline} specified in subclause 5.2.7 that identify
the PDNs [ or DNs]{.underline} of the partner MC system.
If the HPLMN of the partner MC system and the HPLMN of the primary MC system
are the same (i.e. migrating MC service users continue to use the HPLMN of
their primary MC system), then:
\- the EPS [or 5GS]{.underline} subscriptions of the HPLMN of the primary MC
system utilised by the MC service users who are allowed to migrate to the
partner MC system need to be provisioned with the APNs [or DNNs]{.underline}
specified in subclause 5.2.7 that identify the PDNs [ or DNs]{.underline} of
the partner MC system.
NOTE 3: Provisioning of APNs in all of the above includes provisioning of any
needed access credentials e.g. PAP, CHAP.
### 6.2.1.4 Proposed changes to TS 23.280 9.4 Architecture model for roaming
Roaming is achieved using either:
\- EPC-level roaming as defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [17]; or
\- IMS-level roaming as defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9].[;]{.underline}
[- 5G System roaming as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [X].]{.underline}
### 6.2.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
There are no new architectural requirements of 5G System roaming or IMS-level
roaming for the MC service application layer introduced.
### 6.2.3 Solution evaluation
This solution resolves the key issue #2 on 5GC level roaming and fully
addresses in the architectural requirements and architectural model for
roaming in TS 23.280.
## 6.3 Solution 3: 5GS resource control aspects
### 6.3.1 Description
#### 6.3.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue 6 on resource control in the 5GS context. At
this point, reference is also made to the passages of clause 6.1.1.3, which
clarify the different approaches of the 5GS QoS model and the EPS.
Resources in the 5GS context has a broader meaning, since in addition to the
usual 3GPP access also the non-3GPP access which encompasses wireless
terrestrial access, i.e. WiFi, as well as wireless non terrestrial access,
i.e. Satellite, and the wireline broadband access. Latter one alsoe addresses
the convergence between wireless and wireline. Accordingly, the new
possibilities are dealt first andcontinues with generally applicable resource
control aspects.
The following 3GPP Technical Specifications are included in the analysis:
3GPP TS 23.501 [10];
3GPP TS 23.503 [12];
#### 6.3.1.2 Proposed changes to 3GPP TS 23.280
##### 6.3.1.2.1 Proposed new subclause [5.2.7.2.3 Considerations for the 5GS
PDU session to the MC services DN 5.2.7.2.3.1 General]{.underline}
[5GS predefined 5QI sets shall be used, which are structured strictly
according to Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and non-Guaranteed Bit Rate (Non-GBR)
and are identified with the QoS Identifier 5QI. Within the two categories GBR

scheduling priority and averaging window. The 5QI range between 128 and 254
may be used for operator-specific 5QI values (see list below).]{.underline}
[- [1 -- 4] value range for guaranteed bit rate QoS flows;]{.underline}
[- 65, 66, 67 values for guaranteed bit rate QoS flows (assigned for MC

non-3GPP access which is asscociated with a Multi-Access PDU. The
correspoonding rules for the use of MA-PDUs in the MC]{.underline} [system
context shall be defined within the 5GC.]{.underline}
[The 5GS PDU session model is also applicable for wireline access starting at
the wireline access function according to 3GPP TS 23.501 [X].]{.underline}
[The 5GS use of Allocation Retention Priority (ARP) is associated with an
individual QoS flow as part of a PDU session and can be adjusted at any
time.]{.underline}
##### 6.3.1.2.2 Proposed changes to clause 7.2 Description of the planes
The following planes are identified:
a) application plane: The application plane provides all of the services (e.g.
call control, floor control, video control, data control) required by the user
together with the necessary functions to support MC service. It uses the
services of the signalling control plane to support those requirements. For
example, within the MCPTT service, the application plane also provides for the
conferencing of media, and provision of tones and announcements; and
b) signalling control plane: The signalling control plane provides the
necessary signalling support to establish the association of users involved in
an MC service, such as an MCPTT call or other type of MC services. The
signalling control plane also offers access to and control of services across
MC services. The signalling control plane uses the services of the bearer
plane.
For EPS [~~B~~b]{.underline}earers supporting these planes are defined ~~for
LTE~~ within 3GPP TS 23.401 [17]. The resource control that is needed to
support these planes is defined within 3GPP TS 23.203 [8]. The application
plane also relies on the use of multicast bearers established via procedures
defined in 3GPP TS 23. 468 [18] and 3GPP TS 23.246 [11].
[For 5GS PDU sessions and it corresponding QoS flow settings are defined
within 3GPP TS 23.501 [X]. The corresponding resource control to support these
planes is defined within 3GPP TS 23.503 [Z].]{.underline}
[Editor\'s note: The impact on 3GPP TS 23.468 and 3GPP TS 23.246 using 5GS is
FFS.]{.underline}
##### 6.3.1.2.3 Proposed change to 10.11.2 Request for unicast resources at
session establishment [ using EPS]{.underline}
The procedure defined in this subclause specifies how network resources are
requested at session establishment. If concurrent sessions are used the MC
service server may utilize the capability of resource sharing specified in
3GPP TS 23.203 [8]. The request for resources is sent to the PCRF on the Rx
reference point and includes media type, bandwidth, priority, application
identifier and resource sharing information.
The procedure is generic to any type of session establishment that requires
requests for network resources.
Procedures in figure 10.11.2-1 are the signalling procedures for the
requesting resource at session establishment.
Figure 10.11.2-1: Resource request at session establishment
1\. MC service client sends a call/session establishment request.
2\. MC service server receives evaluates the need network resources and use of
media resource sharing.

##### 6.3.1.2.4 Proposed new subclause [10.11.2a Request for unicast resources
at session establishment using 5GS]{.underline}
[The procedure defined in this subclause specifies how network resources are
requested at session establishment. If concurrent sessions are used the MC
service server may utilize the capability of resource sharing specified in
3GPP TS 23.503 [Z]. The request for resources is sent to the PCF on the N5
reference point and includes media type, bandwidth, priority, application
identifier and resource sharing information.]{.underline}
[The procedure is generic to any type of session establishment that requires
requests for network resources.]{.underline}
[Procedures in figure 10.11.2a-1 are the signalling procedures for the
requesting resource at session establishment.]{.underline}
[]{.underline}

[7. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the OK message to the
MC service server.]{.underline}
[8. The MC service call/session is established, and resources have been
allocated.]{.underline}
##### 6.3.1.2.5 Proposed new subclause [10.11.3a Request for modification of
unicast resources using 5GS]{.underline}
To modify unicast media bearers, the MC service server shall send a resource
modification request containing the parameters to be modified, using the call
control protocol via the SIP core to the UE.
Possible scenarios when this procedure may be used are:
> \- Modify the allocation and retention priority for unicast resources;
>
> \- Release and resume resources in-between MC service calls when using the
> chat model; or
>
> \- Release and resume resources when a UE is able to receive the MC service
> call over multicast transmission
Releasing resources for the media plane should give the option to allow the
SIP session to either be torn down or continue.
Procedures in figure 10.11.3a-1 are the signalling procedures for the
modification of a unicast:
Pre-conditions:
\- An MC service call or session is already in progress;
Figure 10.11.3a-1: Bearer modification request using 5GS
1\. MC service server decides to modify the parameters of a unicast bearer
(e.g. a request to upgrade the existing MC service call to an MC service
emergency or imminent threat call).
2\. MC service server sends a session update which includes a resource
modification request containing the modified parameters of the unicast bearer.
3\. PCC procedures (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.503 [Z]) initiated from SIP core
local inbound/outbound proxy over N5.
4\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the session update
request to the MC service client.
5\. The MC service client acknowledges the call control protocol request with
an OK message.
6\. The SIP core local inbound / outbound proxy forwards the OK message to the
MC service server.
7\. The MC service call continues with the modified unicast resources.
NOTE 1: If the MC service call is transferred to multicast transmission, the
unicast resources could be temporarily be released.
NOTE 2: If multiple audio streams are sent to the UE, additional media plane
resources could be required during an established session. Pre-allocation of
additional resources already at session establishment could be useful.
##### 6.3.1.2.7 Proposed change to 10.11.5.1 General
An MC service server that supports simultaneous sessions may need to share.
[A]{.underline}~~a~~ common priority on the EPS bearer for several MC service
group calls that may use different priorities on the application level. This
is achieved by including information for priority sharing on the request of
resources over Rx reference point to PCRF. All sessions associated with the
same priority sharing information will be handled by one EPS bearer, which
will have a priority based on the highest requested priority among the
sessions.
The use of the procedure defined in subclause 10.11.5.2 is dependent on
operator policy.
[5GS provides flexibility in the assignment of priorities within a PDU session
and the corresponding QoS flow. This is achieved by including information for
priority sharing on the request of resources over N5 reference point to the
PCF. A priority sharing indicator provided by the corresponding application
function indicates what media flows are allowed to share a priority. Together
with the supplied application identifier, the ARP priority is calculated.The
ARP pre-emption capability and the ARP pre-emption vulnerability are set
according to operator policies and/or regulatory requirements. Identical
indication(s) for resource sharing for multiple application function sessions,
the PCF may request to realize resource sharing for the corresponding set of
rules otherwise PCF makes policy decisions for the affected session
individually and generates rules for every media flow.]{.underline}
##### 6.3.1.2.8 Proposed new subclause 10.11.5.3 5GS related procedure
[Pre-conditions:]{.underline}
[- All previous resource requests from the MC service have included a priority
sharing information.]{.underline}
[]{.underline}
[Figure 10.11.5.3-1: Resource request including priority sharing information
using 5GS]{.underline}
[1. The MC service server decides based on a request from the MC service
client that the priority of an ongoing call must be adjusted.]{.underline}
[2. The MC service server requests a session update to the SIP core. This
request will contain information of priority sharing.]{.underline}
[3. The proxy function in the SIP core sends a request to the PCF over N5 to
request for modified priority. The request will include the priority sharing
information over N5.]{.underline}
[4. The PCRF acknowledges the request.]{.underline}
[5. PCC updates the priority for the media flow c that contains the SDFs
associated with the same priority sharing information. The priority is set to
highest priority of the original priority among all the PCC rules among those
SDFs that include the priority sharing indicator. No additional media flow is
created. The corresponding default QoS flow priority is updated
accordingly.]{.underline}
[6. The session update is forwarded to the MC service client.]{.underline}
[NOTE 1: The procedure defined above requires a PCC enhancement and is subject
to implementation in 5GS and IMS and can therefore only be used if supported
by 5GS and IMS.]{.underline}
[NOTE 2: If the 5GS and IMS does not support the priority sharing from
MC]{.underline} [system, no shared priority treatment applies, and a new media
flow will be setup based on 5QI/ARP combination.]{.underline}
##### 6.3.1.2.9 Proposed change to 10.11.6.1 General
The procedure in this sub clause specify how request for resource for floor
control (or transmission control in MCVideo and MCData) and for the media
plane can be handled independently.
[For the EPS, the]{.underline}~~This~~ procedure utilizes the Rx reference
point both between from the MC service server to the PCRF and from the SIP
core to the PCRF.
[For the 5GS, the procedure utilizes the N5 reference point both between from
the MC service server to the PCF and from SIP core to the PCF.]{.underline}
Resource for the transmission control are requested at session establishment,
in this case the IMS standard procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 23.228 [9]
are used. The session description shall in this procedure include bandwidth
information applicable for the transmission control traffic requirement. At
group call setup the request for resources for the media plane is triggered.
This request is sent directly from the MC service server to the PCRF [(EPS) or
to the PCF (5GS)]{.underline}.
The procedure is optional and is suitable when the procedures for pre-
established sessions are used, it may also be used to setup and tear down the
media plane used by between consecutive group calls in one communication
session using the chat call model.

[For an MCVideo call session request, resources shall be requested utilising
interaction with dynamic PCC. The MCVideo system shall request resources over
N5 to a PCF. It is recommended that the dedicated QoS flow(s) for video media
and control of the video media (i.e. MCVideo‑4 and MCVideo‑7) utilise the 5QI
values depending on the MCVideo mode of the MCVideo call/session, as per table
5.6.3-1. For transmission and reception control signalling, the 5QI value of
69 is recommended as specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [XX]. The request of

[The MCVideo audio media and video media may transmit over separate QoS flows,
in which case the priority for each QoS flow is determined by the operator

##### 6.3.1.4.1 Proposed changes to 4 Introduction
The MCData service suite provides a set of generic capabilities and specific
services to enable one-to-one and group data communications between MCData
users.
The MCData architecture utilises the common functional architecture to support
mission critical services ~~over LTE~~ defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [5] and
aspects of the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [6], the Proximity-
based Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7] [applicable
for EPS]{.underline}, the Group Communication System Enablers for LTE
(GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.468 [8], the MBMS User Service
architecture defined in 3GPP TS 26.348 [19] [for the use by the
EPS]{.underline}, the Security of the Mission Critical Service in 3GPP TS
33.180 [13] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.237
[9] to enable support of the MCData service.
The MCData UE primarily obtains access to the MCData service ~~via
E-UTRAN,~~using the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [4] [or 5GS
architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [xx]]{.underline}. Certain application
functions of MCData service can be accessed using MCData UEs via non-3GPP
access networks.
The MCData system provides the function to support interworking with LMR
systems defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [18].
##### 6.3.1.4.2 Proposed change for 5.4 File distribution capability
The MCData service shall support distribution of files for one-to-one and
group communications.
The MCData service shall allow the MCData user to send a file or a URL of a
file to another MCData user. The source of the file can originate either from
an MCData client or from a network functional entity. The generated URL shall
be a reference to a stored file to allow for subsequent retrieval. The file
storage policy may determine the availability of the file to be retrieved, and
is subject to expiry time and size limitations.
When the file delivery request is set by the sending user to mandatory
download, the MCData service shall proceed to deliver the file to the
recipient when possible. The file distribution mechanisms shall support both
unicast and broadcast delivery methods [considering EPS as shown in figure
5.4-1 or shall support unicast delivery method considering 5GS as shown in
figure 5.4-2.]{.underline}

count is FFS.
The MCData service shall support aggregation of download completion and
disposition notification reports when files are distributed to multiple
recipients.

retransmission;
\- identify and re-request the missing parts of an incompletely received file;
and
\- accept partial retransmissions and use them to reconstitute the original
file.
Editor\'s note: File repair when end-to-end encryption is used is FFS.
When employing [EPS based]{.underline} MBMS delivery:
\- MCData may use the MB2 interface specified in 3GPP TS 23.468 [8]. See also

#### 6.3.1.5 Proposed changes to 3GPP TS 23.379
##### 6.3.1.5.1 Proposed change to 4 Introduction
The MCPTT service supports communication between several users (i.e. group
call), where each user has the ability to gain access to the permission to
talk in an arbitrated manner. The MCPTT service also supports private calls
between two users.
The MCPTT architecture utilises the common functional architecture to support
mission critical services ~~over LTE~~ defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [16] and
aspects of the IMS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.228 [5], the Proximity-
based Services (ProSe) architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.303 [7], the Group
Communication System Enablers for LTE (GCSE_LTE) architecture defined in 3GPP
TS 23.468 [9] and the PS-PS access transfer procedures defined in 3GPP TS
23.237 [6] to enable support of the MCPTT service.
The MCPTT UE primarily obtains access to the MCPTT service ~~via
E-UTRAN,~~using the EPS architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.401 [8] [or 5GS
architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [xx]]{.underline}. Certain application
functions of MCPTT service such as dispatch and administrative functions can
be supported using either MCPTT UEs ~~in E-UTRAN~~ [with 3GPP
access]{.underline} or using MCPTT UEs via non-3GPP access networks.
NOTE: Dispatch consoles and devices used by MCPTT service administrators are
considered MCPTT UEs in the MCPTT architecture.
MCPTT UEs that use non-3GPP access can only support a subset of the
functionality specified in this specification that is supported by the
non-3GPP access network.
The MCPTT system provides the function to support interworking with LMR
systems defined in 3GPP TS 23.283 [20].
##### 6.3.1.5.2 Proposed new subclause [5.7.2a 5GS considerations]{.underline}

MCPTT initiated QoS flow, if the5GS QoS flow used for MCPTT call has higher
priority level (ARP) than the QoS flow(s) used for other application(s) and if
the QoS flows for non MCPTT application are pre-emptable. In this case, the
QoS flow for MCPTT call pre-empts one of the existing QoS flows when the
maximum number of 5GS QoS flows is established for other
applications.]{.underline}
[NOTE 1: Operator policy takes into account regional/national
requirements.]{.underline}
[The QoS flow for MCPTT emergency call shall have highest priority level among
MCPTT call types. The QoS flow for MCPTT imminent peril call shall have higher
priority level than one for MCPTT call.]{.underline}

##### 6.3.1.5.6 Proposed changes to 7.4.2.3.5 Media distribution function
The media distribution function is responsible for the distribution of media
to call participants. By means of information provided by the MCPTT server
(e.g. IP addresses, transport layer ports), it will provide the following
functionality:
\- provide for the reception of uplink MCPTT UE media transmission by means of
the MCPTT-7 reference point;
\- replicate the media as needed for distribution to those participants using
unicast transport;
\- distribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs by IP unicast transmission to those
participants utilizing unicast transport by means of the MCPTT-7 reference
point;
\- distribute downlink media to MCPTT UEs using [EPS]{.underline} multicast
downlink transport of media for the call by means of the MCPTT-8 reference
point; and
\- provide a media mixing function where multiple media streams are combined
(e.g. multi-talker control) into a single media stream for transmission to the
MCPTT UE.
NOTE 1: If media mixing function occurs within the media distribution
function, it operates independently of the media mixer in the UE.
NOTE 2: A media mixing function within the media distribution function is not
possible where the media is end to end encrypted.
Group configuration data determines whether audio mixing for multi-talker
control is applied by the media mixing function in the MCPTT server.
NOTE 3: If media mixing in the network is utilized, care should be taken to
minimize the feedback of the user\'s own voice from the mixed audio in order
to avoid echoes.
[NOTE 4: MCPTT-8 reference point cannot be utilized in this release using
5GS.]{.underline}
##### 6.3.1.5.7 Proposed change to 7.5.2.2 Reference point MCPTT-1 (between

3GPP TS 23.468 [9]. It is assumed that the MCPTT server is performing the
function of GCS AS. While 3GPP TS 23.468 [9] does not specify GC1 it does
include high level descriptions of certain interactions on GC1, including
those relating to the availability of multicast delivery for the application
client. The MCPTT-1 reference point fulfils the requirements of the GC1
reference point for MCPTT.
Messages supported on this interface may also include the MCPTT server
providing the MCPTT client with information describing the mapping of
transport resources to specific group calls.

#### 6.3.1.6 Request for unicast resources at session establishment using AF
session with required QoS via NEF
The procedure is applied to SIP based MC service sessions. In the procedure
the SIP core interacts with NEF for setting up QoS control and resource
allocation.
Editor\'s Note: The support of N33 reference point by the SIP core is FFS.
The procedure in figure 6.3.1.6-1 illustrates the originating side of the
request for unicast resource at session establishment using AF session with
required QoS procedure (as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] and 3GPP TS 23.503
[12]). For the terminating side the MC service server, SIP core and 5GS use
similar approaches (step 3 to step 8) for resource reservation for downlink
resources.
Figure 6.3.1.6-1: Request for unicast resources at session establishment using
AF session with required QoS (originating side) via NEF
1\. MC service client sends a call/session establishment request. The request
carries the QoS requirements (e.g. one or more QoS reference parameters) and
necessary information (e.g. UE\'s IP address) that can be further used for
setting up an AF session for the MC service with 5GS.
2\. MC service server evaluates the QoS requirements for the MC service
call/session. The MC service server may decide on a different QoS than
requested for the call/session.
3\. MC service server send a session progress request to the SIP core
containing the QoS requirements in SDP offer.
4\. The SIP core reserves resources for the call/session by setting up an AF
session with required QoS procedure with the NEF as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502
[11] subclause 4.15.6.6 and 3GPP TS 23.503 [12] subclause 6.1.3.22.
NOTE: If the SIP core is trusted to 5GC/PCF, it may interact directly with PCF
for the PCC interactions.
5\. The SIP core forwards session progress request to the MC service client.
6\. The MC service client acknowledges the session progress request with an OK
message.
7\. The SIP core forwards the OK message to the MC service server.
8\. The MC service call/session is established and resources have been
allocated.
#### 6.3.1.7 Request for unicast resource update in ongoing session using AF
session with required QoS update via NEF
The procedure is applied to SIP based MC service sessions. In the procedure
the SIP core interacts with NEF for QoS update and resource modification.
The procedure in figure 6.3.1.7-1 illustrates the request for unicast resource
update using AF session with required QoS update procedure (as defined in 3GPP
TS 23.502 [11] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [12]) for ongoing sessions.
Figure 6.3.1.7-1: Request for unicast resource update in ongoing session using
AF session with required QoS update via NEF
0\. The MC service call/session using unicast is ongoing.
1\. MC service server decides to update the QoS parameters of the session
(e.g. upon a request to upgrade the existing MC service call to an MC service
emergency or imminent threat call, receiving the QoS notification indicating
the QoS target can be no longer fulfilled, etc.).
2\. MC service server sends a session update to the SIP core which contains
the alternative service requirements or QoS information that can be further
derived to alternative QoS parameters at 5GS.
3\. The SIP core initiates AF session with QoS update procedure with the NEF
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [11] subclause 4.15.6.6a and 3GPP TS 23.503 [12]
subclause 6.1.3.22.
NOTE: If the SIP core is trusted to 5GC/PCF, it may interact directly with PCF
for the PCC interactions.
4\. The SIP core forwards the session update request to the MC service client.
5\. The MC service client acknowledges the request with an OK message.
6\. The SIP core forwards the OK message to the MC service server.
7\. The MC service call/session continues with the udated unicast resources.
### 6.3.2 Solution evaluation
The provided solution for 5GS resource control in the context of 3GPP TS
23.280, 3GPP TS 23.281, 3GPP TS 23.282 and 3GPP TS 23.379 are fully inclusive
and final.
## 6.4. Solution 4: Determine impacts of 5GS network slicing to MC services
### 6.4.1 Description
#### 6.4.1.1 General
This solution addresses key issue 8 impacts of of 5GS network slicing to the
MC system.
Network Slicing is a transport resource partioning concept that allows
differentiated treatment depending on individual user requirements. A user may
belong to different tenant types having different transport service
requirements and corresponding subscriptions.
The following 3GPP Technical Specifications are included in the analysis:
\- 3GPP TS 23.228 [14];
\- 3GPP TS 23.501 [10];
\- 3GPP TS 23.503 [12];
\- 3GPP TS 29.513 [16];
\- 3GPP TS 38.300 [17];
#### 6.4.1.2 Network slicing constituents
A network slice always consists of an access network part (3GPP and non-3GPP)
as well as core network part [10], [17], is applicable to control and user
plane, to mobility and to roaming. Network slicing is applicable to 5G NR as
well as E-UTRA connected to 5GC. Traffic for different slices of a user is
handled by different PDU sessions though different slice instances may have
slice specific PDU sessions using the same DNN.
#### 6.4.1.3 Network slicing subscription and authorisation
A subscription profile may contain one or more (Single) Network Slice
Selection Assistance Information (S-NSSAIs) one marked as a default S-NSSAI
[10]. An S-NSSAI can be subject to Network Slice-Specific Authentication and
Authorization.
Further details are in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
#### 6.4.1.4 Network slicing allocation and resource control
5G NR supports QoS differentiation within a slice and resource isolation
between slices [10]. Furthermore, a network slice may be available in the
whole PLMN or in one or more Tracking Areas of a PLMN. Network slicing on a
per slice instance, per DNN, or per both slice instance and DNN basis is as
well applicable to resources control.
The Application Function (e.g. IMS, MC system etc.) [12] is able to influence
UPF traffic routing also considering DNN, its network slice identification
information and other potential identifiers. With receipt by the PCF, the
PCF(s) transform(s) the AF requests into policies that apply to corresponding
PDU sessions.
Further details can be found in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10]
It is intended to use IMS service profile information [18] for controlling the
network slice allocation. For this purpose, the connection between IMS service
(e.g. application identifier), IMS service profile, application provider and,
if specified, the individual UE identification. If the individual UE
identification is not specified, this may affect all UEs that have provisioned
the application identifier in their subscription. It will result in an update
of the network slice selection policy for the individual user or group of
users. However, this will require also an update of the UE Route Selection
Policy (URSP) to determine the association of the application to an
established PDU session. The proposed use of an optional service type string
can be used to distinguish between IMS signalling and IMS media. The services
type media describes the different media types (Voice, Video etc.).
#### 6.4.1.5 Session binding
Session binding [16] is the association of the AF session information to only
one PDU session with its corresponding QoS flows. This applies when an
Application Function provide service information to the PCF which will be
associated with the described IP address and the corresponding PDU session.
The provision of the S-NSSAI is then important when multiple network slice
instances are active using the same DNN and potentially the IP address may be
allocated to PDU sessions in various network slice instances. How the AF
derives S-NSSAI is implementation specific.
#### 6.4.1.6 Assessment key issue 8 - gaps
How mission critical identities can be utilized across different mission
critical 5GS network slices, e.g. MC IDs, MC service IDs, MC service group
IDs, etc.
\- Network slicing tenant concept and the provisioning of S-NSSAIs are part of
the 5GS subscription and is related to the corresponding DNN. One network
slice and its S-NSSAI corresponds to one PDU session. A DNN allows to
establish up to 8 PDU sessions. If MC service identities are required for the
network slice determination the MC system may provide the relevant profile
information to the NEF to associate the information in the PCF and to update
the URSP.
\- Network slicing is applicable to wireless and wireline networks and
corresponding devices according to 3GPP TS 23.501. A mission critical device
can be a 3GPP-compliant device (i.e. MC UE) or a non-3GPP-compliant device.
Each MC device is able to utilize multiple DNNs and corresponding S-NSSAI
simultaneously.
How mission critical entities can be utilized across different mission
critical 5GS network slices, e.g. group management, identity management,
location management, etc.
\- The network slicing concept supports QoS and priority differentiation
within a slice to the individual QoS flow of a user. Depending on the mission
critical operator requirement the reference points applicable to mission
critical service can be either (non-exhaustive):
1\. Within one DNN having different network slice up to the PDU session
limitation;
2\. Multiple DNNs with/without network slices;
3\. Multiple DNNs with multiple network slices;
How the addressing of MC service client information can be realized across
different mission critical 5GS network slices, e.g. location information
reports, etc.
\- The AF (IMS/MC system) have to consider PDU session binding mechanism
according to 3GPP TS 29.513 [16].
How synchronisation of mission critical signalling and media across different
mission critical 5GS network slices can be realized, e.g. MCPTT to MCVideo,
MCVideo to MCData, MCPTT to MCData, etc.
\- Session binding provides the management between the DNN, PDU session and
related S-NSSAI identities.
\- The provision of MC service profile information to the NEF to align network
slice selection rule as well as the URSP;
How security mechanisms across different mission critical 5GS network slices
either with slice isolation or without can be realized, e.g. end-to-end
encryption, etc.
\- Network slicing as network transport resource partitioning concept can be
used for a multi-tenant approach and traffic isolation. The use of a network
slice can be subject to network slice specific authentication and
authorisation. The subject of end-to-end network slice encryption is not
supported.
How scalability adaptions of the mission critical services provided over 5GS
network slices can be realized, e.g. adding other mission critical services to
the already used one, increasing or reducing performance of mission critical
services, etc.
\- Generally, this is an engineering task that need to consider the estimated
traffic and will result to requirements of guaranteed and aggregated maximum
bitrate necessary for a network slice.
How the utilization of mission critical identities and information can be
realized, e.g. location information, created during a temporal utilization of
5GS network slices.
\- Mission critical identities are used exclusively for identification within
the service environment and their imapct on the 3GPP system is very limited.
The use of a network slice can be subject to certain geographic restrictions
within the 3GPP system. If it is desired to establish dependencies between MC
service identities, MC service capabilities and the use of network slices,
necessarily may be carried out at the application level.
### 6.4.2 Solution evaluation
This solution resolves the key issue #8 network slicing impact on MC system.
The questions raised in key issue 8 partially address engineering/deployment
topics as fundamental topics for the application of 5GS network slicing, and
the present solution mainly addresses 5G system aspects and possible
limitations. The use of network slicing is designed in such a way that it has
no functional restrictions on other 5GS functions.
The potential use of network slicing, for example in 3GPP TS 23.280, need to
be included in the clause that addresses transport resources and their
management. The addressed gaps with system aspects have been discussed
comprehensively and conclusively.
## 6.5 Solution 5: Flexible media distribution for low latency applications
### 6.5.1 Description
#### 6.5.1.1 General
Key issue 10 requires the simultaneous processing of different latency values
in the range of a few milliseconds up to a few hundred milliseconds. This is
required when a MC communication consists of one or multiple simultaneous
streams in the signalling/application plane and the media plane. Certain
applications with very low latency requirements may require distributed
application servers, such that an application server is always physically
close to a gNB in the RAN that is serving an MC UE. This may require mobility
aspects to be considered, which require to change the connectivity session
anchor for very low latencies not traversing the less latency-critical session
anchor. All this together impacts the current functional MC system
architecture regarding the media plane. Today\'s media distribution function
as integral part of the MC service server is there because of
unicast/multicast communication recording and for some service capabilities
like transmission/reception control.
The use case behind this key issue is to provide the necessary means to
support very low latency point to point communication between a mobile user
and a user located in a data network via a local access. The solution
considers the impact on control plane and user plane of mobility and potential
impact on low latency.
A media stream consisting of several protocols or simultaneously used for
multiple different categories of data exchanges e.g. within an IP connectivity
session. This require various latency approaches between the involved
endpoints within one media stream.
#### 6.5.1.2 Potential approaches
If going ahead with the integral media plane approach for media requiring low
latency, leads to a multiplication of MC service servers for local media
transitions within an operative domain to satisfy low latency applications. A
relocation of already assigned MC service servers depending on its
geographical position is therefore necessary. The change of a
signalling/application plane anchor necessarily entails a change of the
assigned IP address to the MC service user. Such change in the assignment IP
address triggers SIP re-registration, e.g. with IMS. Session/service
continuity may be guaranteed, but no IP address continuity which negatively
impacts the availability to fulfil low latency requirements.
Figure 6.5.1.2-1: Multiple MC service servers with an integral media
distribution function
Another approach provides the unbundling of the media distribution function
from the MC service server, where the MC service server still controls the
media distribution functions assigned to it. The MC service server forms the
signalling/application plane anchor and can control one or more media
distribution function anchors as remote peripheral units. Thus, the change
between media distribution anchors is always controlled by the same MC server
signalling/application plane anchor. This approach does not require a new
assignment of the IP address, so it does not trigger SIP re-registration with
the MC service server anchor to keep the signalling/application plane. This
approach enables IP continuity under the same anchor MC service server.
Figure 6.5.1.2-2: One MC service server controlling multiple media
distribution functions
#### 6.5.1.3 Use of EPS
With EPS accordant to 3GPP TS 23.401, this can only be done using different
APNs and associated bearers. Within this context the use of Local IP Access
(LIPA) functionality to differentiate between low latency and less latency-
critical applications are using a dedicated APN which will not allow the use
of different connectivity anchors.
#### 6.5.1.4 Use of 5GS
In accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 5GS enables the use of multiple connection
anchors using one data network with simultaneous handling of non-critical
latency applications via a central connectivity anchor and low latency
requirements via local connectivity session anchors. Hence low latency
applications will not traverse the central connectivity session anchor. UE
mobility triggers the relocation of connectivity anchors to keep track on
latency requirements. In this context, Session and Service Continuity modes
(3GPP TS 23.501) regulate IP continuity and the resulting media plane
interruption.
Figure 6.5.1.4-1 visualizes the use of 5GS with one central and several local
UPFs. The change of the UPF due to mobility will be handled by the 5GC session
management which allows preservation of IP Addresses (3GPP TS 23.501) used by
the media plane. As a result, the path of the media plane through the 3GPP
network will not be affected by the mobility.
Figure 6.5.1.4-1: Media distribution function as remote peripheral unit with
5GS
The different service and session continuity modes have an impact to the
service continuity in the media plane distribution. This need to be considered
in the development of a distributed media plane distribution management.
#### 6.5.1.5 EPS versus 5GS assessment
Comparing the two MC server/media distribution approaches taking into account
both EPS and 5GS, a simultaneous processing of low latency applications and
non-critical latency applications can only be supported using 5GS. With IP
address continuity and keeping low latency requirement, this can only be
achieved with the approach of unbundling the MC service server and the media
distribution function.
### 6.5.2 Solution unbundling MC service server and the media distribution
function
#### 6.5.2.1 MCData IPcon
##### 6.5.2.1.1 IPcon without media distribution point-to-point IPcon
This solution proposes the use of IP connectivity without involvement of the
Media distribution function. In such an approach the existing MCData IPcon
signalling reference point MCData-IPcon-1 is still used between the MCData
server and the MCData client. However, in this model the media plane reference
points MCData-IPcon-2 is not used, but functionality wise it is replaced by
the new reference point MCData-IPcon-5 which is defined directly between the
involved MCData clients.
MCData-IPcon-5 uses a transport link between the corresponding IPcon function
and carries bidirectional IP Data of the involved MCData clients.
This solution does not allow a central media plane recording therefore media
plane recording will be up to the corresponding MCData clients that supports
MCData-IPcon-5 reference point.

direct connection of the user plane data between MCData IPcon clients
### 6.5.3 Solution evaluation
Editor\'s Note: Use this section for evaluation at solution level.
## 6.6 Solution 6: Deployment scenarios
### 6.6.1 Description
This solution addresses the key issue #7 on deployment scenarios.
The contribution proposed updates and additions to subclause 9.2.1 (On-network
architectural model) and 9.2.2 (Deployment scenarios) of TS 23.280 for MC
services over 5GS.
The assessment is based on following references:
\- 3GPP TS 23.501 [10]: Definitions, Architecture model and concepts, High
level features, Network functions
\- GPP TS 23.502 [11]: System procedures (on IMS aspects)
\- 3GPP TS 23.228 [14]: IP-Connectivity Access Network specific concepts when
using 5GS to access IMS
#### 6.6.1.1 Proposed changes to 3GPP TS 23.280 subclause 9.2.2.1
Administration of MC service, SIP core and ~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}
##### 6.6.1.1.1 Proposed changes to 9.2.2.1.1 General
This subclause describes five different deployment scenarios in which
different administration of MC service, SIP core and ~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}
are described, together with the sensitivities of identities and other forms
of signalling in those scenarios.
In each of these scenarios, the owner of the devices at each plane may be
different from the organisation that administers these devices. For example,
the MC service provider may own some RAN components within the EPS even when
the EPS is administered by the PLMN operator, and the MC service UE may be
owned by an organisation that is independent from PLMN and MC service
providers.
##### 6.6.1.1.2 Proposed changes to 9.2.2.1.2 Common administration of all
planes
In this scenario, all planes (application services layer, SIP core and
~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}) are administered by the same party. This is
illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.2-1 below.
Figure 9.2.2.1.2-1: Common administration of all services by one operator
Although the identities in each plane are separate according to clause 8,
there is no particular sensitivity of identities and other information at the
application plane, and these may be exposed to the SIP core and the
~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}.
All authorisation and authentication mechanisms at each plane, i.e. the
application services layer, SIP core and ~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}, shall be
separate, but there may be no need for any restrictions in how these are
stored and managed; for example the same entity could provide services to each
of the application services layer, SIP core and ~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}.
##### 6.6.1.1.3 Proposed changes to 9.2.2.1.3 MC service provider separate
from SIP core and ~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.3-1, the MC service
provider is separate and independent from the PLMN operator, and the MC
service is administered independently of the ~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline} and SIP
core. The PLMN operator administers the ~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline} and the SIP
core.
Figure 9.2.2.1.3-1: MC service provider administers MC service separately from
SIP core and ~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}
The MC service provider may require that all application services layer
identities and other sensitive information are hidden both from the SIP core
and the ~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}.
When required by the MC service provider, all authentication and authorisation
mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer are
hidden from and not available to the PLMN operator.
##### 6.6.1.1.4 Proposed changes to 9.2.2.1.4 MC service provider administers
SIP core, separate from ~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.4-1, the MC service
provider administers the SIP core, and the MC services and SIP core are
independent of the PLMN operator.
Figure 9.2.2.1.4-1: MC service provider provision of SIP core, separate domain
from ~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}
The MC service provider may require that all identities and other sensitive
information at the application services layer are hidden from the
~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}. The MC service provider need not hide the identities
and signalling at the application services layer from the SIP core. However
the MC service provider may require that identities and other sensitive
information between SIP core and SIP client in the MC service UE are also
hidden from the ~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}.
All authentication and authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at
both application services layer and at SIP signalling plane may need to be
hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.
##### 6.6.1.1.5 Proposed changes to 9.2.2.1.5 SIP core partially administered
by both PLMN operator and MC service provider
In this scenario, as illustrated in figure 9.2.2.1.5-1, the SIP core is
partially administered by both parties, for example when the SIP core
registrar is administered by the MC service provider, but the SIP core
registrar finder and proxy is administered by the PLMN operator.
Figure 9.2.2.1.5-1: MC service provider partial provision of SIP core,
separate domain from ~~EPS~~[5GS]{.underline}
The MC service provider may require that all identities and signalling at the
application services layer are hidden from the EPS/5GS, and may require
identities and other sensitive information to be hidden from the PLMN operator
administered part of the SIP core.
All authentication and authorisation mechanisms, including security roots, at
the application services layer may need to be hidden from, and not available
to, the PLMN operator.
##### 6.6.1.1.6 Proposed changes to 9.2.2.1.6 PLMN operator administers SIP
core with SIP identities administered by MC service provider
In this scenario, the PLMN operator administers the SIP core. However, the
identities used by the SIP core (IMPI and IMPU) for MC service UEs served by
the MC service provider are provided from the SIP database of the MC service
provider.
Figure 9.2.2.1.6-1: MC service provider provides identities to PLMN operator
SIP core
The MC service provider may require that all identities and signalling at the
application services layer are hidden from the SIP core and EPS.
When required by the MC service provider, all authentication and authorisation
mechanisms, including security roots, at the application services layer may
need to be hidden from, and not available to, the PLMN operator.
The security roots (authentication keys) required for access to the signalling
control plane are not available to the PLMN operator as these are held in the
MC service provider\'s SIP database. However, derived parameters e.g.
authentication vectors are provided to the SIP core to allow signalling
control plane authentication to take place.
#### 6.6.1.2 Proposed new subclause 3GPP TS 23.280 [9.2.2.2a Deployment

### 6.6.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
This solution is based on new on-network functional model proposed which is
also aligned with the functional models in solution #1. The MC service server,
SIP core and MC service UE need to support 5GS reference points and
functionalities as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
### 6.6.3 Solution evaluation
This solution resolves the key issue #7 on deployment scenarios with the
necessary assessment and updates on deployment scenarios of TS 23.280 for 5GS
impacts.
## 6.7 Solution 7: MC service integration
### 6.7.1 General
Until now, the focus has mainly been on the operation of the MC system and
3GPP system under the same trusted domain, where the MC system can be allowed
to interact directly with relevant 5GS control plane functions. MC system
including the SIP core can also be deployed to indirectly interact with
relevant 5GC network functions using external exposure framework via Network
Exposure Functions (NEF) in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
These two approaches then also differ in the use of the 5GS reference points
having different capabilities provided to access relevant 5GC network
functions. In the following, therefore, the aspect of indirect interaction
approach from MC services/SIP core to 5GC network functions is specifically
addressed.
### 6.7.2 Common functional model impact
For the use of the indirect interaction between SIP core and relevant 5GS
network functions, N33 reference point towards 5GS Network Exposure Function
(NEF) need to be considered to coordinate the corresponding MC service
communication parameter with the PCF and the UE affecting the 5GS transport.
The common functional model for signalling control plane is to be extended
through the explicit use of the N33 reference point. In accordance to 3GPP TS
23.002 [20] applicable for SIP core or 3GPP TS 23.228 [14] applicable for IMS
N33 reference point is not supported.
Editor\'s Note: The use of N33 reference by the SIP core is FFS.
[Figure 6.7.2-1: Functional model for signalling control plane using
5GS]{.underline}
### 6.7.3 MC service\'s functional model impact
The MC service server can also be allowed to indirectly interact with relevant
5GS control plane network functions. At this point, the corresponding MC
service server uses N33 reference point towards 5GS Network Exposure Function
(NEF) to coordinate the corresponding communication with the PCF and the UE
affecting the 5GS transport. For MCData, as representative, the reference
point MCData-5 then uses the 3GPP system reference point N33 for the indirect
interaction option.
Figure 6.7.3-1: Generic MCData application plane functional model
NOTE: MCData was only mentioned here as a representative of the other MC
services. Functional model updates of all MC services are required in this
context.
The MCData-5 reference point, which exists between the MCData capability
function and the 5GS, is used, subject to the conditions below, by the MCData
capability function of the MCData server to obtain unicast communication flows
with appropriate QoS from the 5GS. It utilises the Rx/N5 or N33 reference
point of 5GS according to 3GPP TS 23.501 [10].
MCData-5, utilizing Rx/N5, may be used when the MCData service provider
directly interact with operator\'s relevant5GS network function for QoS
control.
MCData-5, utilizing N33 reference point, may be used when the MCData service
provider is limited by the operational agreement, i.e., indirect interaction
with operator\'s 5GS network functions for QoS control.
### 6.7.4 Solution evaluation
To allow indirect interaction with 5GS control plane network functions using
NEF via N33 reference point can only be made by the corresponding MC service
server. SIP core and IMS applicable 3GPP technical specifications do not
foresee and allow the support of N33 reference point.
## 6.8 Solution 8: 5G MBS impacts on MC Service functional models
### 6.8.0 General
5G Multicast Broadcast transport mode (MBS) aims to support multiple services
(e.g., MC service, V2X service, media streaming service).
With this regard the main MBS enhancements in 5G NR are:
\- Group scheduling mechanism to allow UEs to receive MBS service including
simultaneous operation with unicast reception
\- To deliver the MBS data traffic from MB-UPF to NG-RAN, namely, 5GC Shared
Delivery (SD) method applicable to multicast as well as broadcast and 5GC
Individual Delivery (ID). The use of Shared Delivery depends on MBS NG-RAN
capabilities which will select the appropriate delivery method.
\- Reliability enhancements by dynamic change of multicast/broadcast service
\- Supporting mobility to adapt to available delivery method (shared
delivery/individual delivery) and lossless handover to minimize the loss of
information
\- Reception of broadcast data irrespective of UE\'s Radio Resource Control
(RRC) states
\- Reception of multicast data in UE\'s Radio Resource Control (RRC) state
Connected (further enhancements in Rel-18)
\- MBS over legacy network node, for example, Release 15/16 network
The main use of 5G MBS for MC services is currently limited to the transport
only mode, which was already considered when using EPS. At this point, the
differences and influence on the MC service functional model for the use of 5G
MBS are therefore examined and highlighted accordingly.
Editor\'s note: The use of MBS for MC services within the full-service mode is
FFS depending on SA4.
### 6.8.1 Description
This solution is to address the key issue #13 on necessary changes when using
5G MBS for MC services.
With 5G MBS three levels determine the corresponding delivery mechanism
Application Function (AF), 5GC and NG-RAN, with 5GC and NR-RAN acting
independently of the AF. The AF may select between the modes broadcast
multicast and unicast, while 5GC determines the use of Shared or Individual
Delivery and NR-RAN determines if PTP or PTM is used for Shared Delivery.
Functional elements, such as mobility or localized areas, can only be found in
5GS with the corresponding functional extensions.
The subclause deals with the necessary adjustments for the MC service
functional models. This present solution illustrates the simplified the MC
service functional models using 5G MBS and specifies the necessary 5G MBS
functional blocks for MC services.
NOTE 1: The solution architecture requires continuous alignment with the
corresponding aspects in 3GPP TS 23.247.
The figure 6.8.1-1 illustrates an MC service functional model for 5G MBS,
based on transport-only mode with no LTE interworking.
Figure 6.8.1-1 MC service functional model application plane using 5G MBS
reference point representation
MC service media content and corresponding control messages can be exchanged
using MBS session and their corresponding MBS QoS flow(s), which are
communication pipes with one end in the 5G Core and the other end in the MC
service UE. The media content uses N6mb reference point towards corresponding
media functions in the 5G Core (i.e., with MB-UPF). For the corresponding
signalling in case of untrusted operations of the MC services N33 reference
point is applicable for interaction with the 5GC via NEF/MBSF. In case of
trusted operations, the MC service server interacts directly via Nmb13
reference point towards MB-SMF. In case of having dynamic PCC rule based MBS
sessions, the MC service server interacts with PCF either indirectly via N33
towards NEF/MBSF, or directly via N5 reference point.
The figure 6.8.1-2 illustrates an MC service functional model for 5G MBS,
based on transport-only mode and once interworking with LTE is facilitated via
MBSF and MBSTF.
Figure 6.8.1-2 MC service functional model application plane using 5G MBS
reference point representation with MBSF/MBSTF.
Figure 6.8.1-2 provides the reference points when the deployment includes MBSF
and MBSTF for interworking purposes with LTE within the transport only mode.
The media content uses Nmb8/MB2-U reference point towards the 5GC (MBSTF). For
the corresponding signalling, either N33 reference point is applicable for
untrusted MC services operation towards NEF (or towards collaboration of NEF
and MBSF deployment case) or Nmb10 is applicable towards MBSF for trusted
operation.
Editor\'s note: The use of MBS for MC services within the full-service mode
via MBSF/MBSTF, is FFS as it depends on the work progress done by SA4.
The uplink is always allocated as unicast transport resource, while the
downlink can be allocated as unicast transport resource for individual
delivery, as MBS transport resource for shared delivery or a combination of
both if multiple cells are involved.
The TMGI is still the core element to identify uniquely the MBS session.
Elements that are closely connected to the transport within the 5GS are only
managed there and are no longer used at the application level.
A 5G multicast/broadcast MBS session is uniquely identified via the MBS
session ID (i.e. a TMGI or source specific IP multicast address).
The MC service server has to consider TMGI to enable session binding with the
corresponding PCF. The necessary binding of appropriate QoS flow for an MBS
session will be within 5GS MBS.
The MC service server needs to consider the following functions to enable the
group communication over 5G MBS:
\- Mode determination: Whether to use Multicast, Broadcast, or/and unicast of
each group call
\- interfacing the NEF to request the corresponding MBS service
information/QoS requirements if dynamic PCC is applicable
\- interfacing with the NEF to use the TMGI for the corresponding 5G MBS
session, and to allocate the appropriate mode (multicast/broadcast)
\- announcing the MBS service information to MC service UEs involved in the
group communication
\- announcing the assignment of MBS session for a specific group call to
involved MC service UEs
\- signalling with MC service UE for receiving the broadcast MBS session
reception report and the multicast MBS session status report
\- interfacing with the MB-SMF/NEF for local MBS session configuration and
inform the MC service UE about the local MBS session information
The update to existing functional models for MCPTT to support 5G MBS based on
transport only mode is shown in figure 6.8.1-3.
Figure 6.8.1-3 MCPTT functional model for application plane supporting 5G MBS
The following reference point descriptions are applied:
**Reference point MCPTT-5 (between the MCPTT server and the 5GS)**
The MCPTT-5 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT server and the
5GS, is used, subject to the conditions below, by the MCPTT server to
establish an MBS session obtaining a unicast network resource with appropriate
QoS from the 5GS. It utilises N5reference point, or the Rx reference point, or
N33 reference point of 5GS according to 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
MCPTT-5, utilizing Nmb13 reference point, may be used when the MCPTT service
provider and the PLMN operator have an operational agreement where QoS control
is provided directly from the MCPTT service provider domain.
MCPTT-5, utilizing N33 reference point, may be used when the MCPTT service
provider is limited by the operational agreement, i.e., indirect interaction
with operator\'s 5GS network functions for QoS control.
MCPTT-5 is also used by the MCPTT server to configure the QoS requirements in
correspondence to the MBS session identifier if dynamic PCC is applicable.
NOTE 2: Any coordination between the P-CSCF use of N30/N29mb and the MCPTT
server use of N30/N29mb (via MCPTT-5) from the MCPTT service provider domain
is not specified in this release of this specification.
**Reference point MCPTT-6 (between the MCPTT server and the 5GS)**
The MCPTT-6 reference point, which exists between the MCPTT server and the
5GS, is used to create an MBS session obtaining multicast or broadcast
resources for MCPTT application usage. The MCPTT-6 reference point uses the
N33, Nmb13, Nmb10, MB2-C reference points in accordance to 3GPP TS 23.247
[19].
MCPTT-6, utilizing Nmb13 reference points, may be used when the MCPTT service
provider and the PLMN operator have an operational agreement where QoS control
is provided directly from the MCPTT service provider domain.
MCPTT-6, utilizing N33 reference point, may be used when the MCPTT service
provider is limited by the operational agreement, i.e., indirect interaction
with operator\'s 5GS network functions for QoS control.
MCPTT-6 is also used by the MCPTT server to configure the QoS requirements in
correspondence to the MBS session identifier if dynamic PCC is applicable.
MCPTT-6, utilizing Nmb10/MB2-C reference points, may be used when MCPTT
service provider interacts with MBSF directly either once interworking with
LTE is facilitated via MBSF/MBSTF, or for full-service mode.
**Reference point MCPTT-8 (between the media distribution function and the
media mixer)**
The MCPTT-8 reference point definition in 3GPP TS 23.379 [3] is applied. When
the MC service obtains 5GS transport capability, the MCPTT-8 reference point
uses the N6mb reference point according to 3GPP TS 23.247[19].
The MCPTT-8 reference point definition in 3GPP TS 23.379 [3] is applied. When
the MC service obtains 5GS full-service capability, the MCPTT-8 reference
point uses the Nmb8 reference point according to 3GPP TS 23.247[19].
The MCPTT-8 reference point definition in 3GPP TS 23.379 [3] is applied. When
the MC service provides interworking with LTE via MBSF/MBSTF, the MCPTT-8

23.247[19].
**Reference point MCPTT-9 (between the floor control server and the floor
participant)**
The MCPTT-9 reference point definition in 3GPP TS 23.379 [3] is applied. And
when MC service is over 5GS, the MCPTT-9 reference point uses the N6mb
reference point according to 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
The MCPTT-9 reference point definition in 3GPP TS 23.379 [3] is applied. And

The MCPTT-9 reference point definition in 3GPP TS 23.379 [3] is applied. And
when MC service is over 5GS, the MCPTT-9 reference point uses the MB2-U
reference point according to 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
NOTE 3: Transposition the corresponding MC service reference points are also
applicable to MCVideo and MCData.
### 6.8.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
MC service server functionality impact:
\- support of 5G MBS related functionalities by acting as the Application
Function (AF) in the 5G MBS architecture context in accordance to 3GPP TS
23.247 [19];
Reference points impact:
\- the MC service server need to support corresponding reference points
applicable for signalling and media in transport only mode (configuration
option 1) in accordance to 3GPP 23.247 Annex A.
### 6.8.3 Solution evaluation
The proposed solution defines the necessary adjustments to be able to process
MC services via 5G MBS in transport only mode.
The following items are addressed:
\- The common functional model of the MC system is not affected in the 5G MBS
context.
\- Transpose 5G MBS architecture and corresponding reference points to the
functional models for MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData considering the operational
arrangements (trusted/untrusted).
\- The separation between the 5GS transport and Application Functions in this
context MC service servers.
NOTE: Alignments with 3GPP TS 23.247 might be still necessary especially when
the use of some reference points are further clarified.
## 6.9 Solution 9: General use of 5G MBS services for MC service group
communications
### 6.9.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #13 and is intended to provide a high-level
description of the general use of 5G MBS services for MC service group
communications.
As being specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], the 5G MBS services rely on the
establishment of MBS sessions to deliver data in downlink as a point-to-
multipoint service from an application source to multiple end users. MBS
sessions consist of one or multiple MBS QoS flows addressing different service
requirements.
MBS sessions can be of two types: broadcast and multicast sessions. With
broadcast MBS sessions, the data is simultaneously distributed over the radio
interface to all users (UEs) located within a geographical area, i.e. a
configured broadcast coverage area. With multicast MBS sessions, the data is
simultaneously distributed to a dedicated set of users (UEs) over the radio
interface either by a point-to-point (PTP) delivery method or a point-to-
multipoint (PTM) delivery method.
For the support of MC service group communications using MBS sessions, a set
of procedures needs to be considered and executed as shown in figure
6.9.1.1-1.
Figure 6.9.1-1: General MBS sessions related procedures
In general, when the MC service server decides to use MBS sessions for MC
service group communications, the MC service server is first required to
configure with the 5GC one or more MBS sessions to deliver the data associated
to the MC service group communications. The creation request includes, among
other aspects, the MBS session type and required service requirements
associated to the MBS session.
NOTE 1: It is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to
use MBS sessions, either multicast or broadcast sessions, for MC service group
communications.
As part of the MBS session creation, specific MBS information like MBS session
ID and how the data can be provided to be distributed over the MBS session is
defined and available at the MC service server. An MBS session is initially
configured once the MC service server triggers a request towards the 5GC,
where the creation can either be performed with PCC via PCF or without PCC, as
described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. Furthermore, during the MBS session creation
step, unless the MB-SMF information is available, e.g., locally configured in
the MC service server or NEF/MBSF, the MC service server (directly or via
NEF/MBSF) performs an MBS-SMF discovery and selection towards the 5GS as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. For this purpose, the MC service server
utilizes the MBS session related information, among others, e.g., S-NSSAI(s),
DNS(s), and the MBS service area.
Based on the MBS session related information considered during the MBS session
creation, the MC service server can announce the corresponding MBS session(s)
to the target MC users via an MBS service announcement. As being defined in
3GPP TS 23.247 [19], the MBS service announcement shall include, among others,
the MBS session ID, session type, SDP information, and any other information
required to enable that MC service UEs can receive MC service data over an
specific MBS session.
Based on the session type received in the MBS service announcement, the MC
service UEs will be required to execute subsequent procedures to enable
receiving the corresponding MC service data over the MBS session. For the case
of multicast MBS sessions, MC service UEs will be required to request to the
5G system a session join to the corresponding multicast MBS session(s). Upon
the acceptance of the first requested UE session join, the corresponding
session is established. For the case of broadcast MBS sessions, session
establishment occurs by a session start, which is triggered by the MC service
server. Consequently, the MC service UEs will be required to start monitoring
broadcast transmissions associated to the corresponding broadcast MBS
session(s).
When the MC service server identifies that the target MC service users can
receive data over the MBS sessions, e.g. based on a notification from MC
service clients indicating the successful join of a multicast MBS session or
the successful monitoring of a broadcast MBS session (similar to the listening
status report used in MBMS), the MC service server can decide to transmit the
data (e.g. application control signalling or media associated to an MC service
group communication) over the established MBS session(s).
Before providing MC service data to be distributed over an MBS session, the MC
service server is required to indicate to the target MC service clients,
either over the MBS service announcement or additional signalling, specific
information related to how the specific MC service group communication is
transmitted over the MBS session. For instance, this information should
indicate the associated media stream used for the specific MC service group
communication within the MBS session.
For the case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service server can decide to
stop using a multicast MBS session for MC service group communications. For
that, the MC service server can request the specific MC service UE(s) to leave
the corresponding multicast MBS session(s) which leads to the MC service UE
sending a UE session leave request to the 5GS.
When the MC service server decides to fully stop using a configured MBS
session in the 5GS, the MC service server shall send a release request to the
5GC to release all resources associated to the corresponding MBS session.
The MC service server shall also indicate to the corresponding MC service
users that the MBS session will not be used anymore for the configured MC
service group communications. This will trigger, e.g., that MC service UEs
stop monitoring a session in case of broadcast MBS sessions or that MC service
UEs request leaving the session in the case of multicast MBS sessions and send
a delete request to the 5GC to delete the MBS session.
NOTE 2: It is implementation specific how the MC service server decides to
stop using a specific MBS session for a group communication, both in case of
broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.
Editor\'s note: The set of procedures described in figure 6.9.1.1-1 and in
general how to use them for MC service group communications are still FFS
based on the further specification of these procedures in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
### 6.9.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
MC service server and MC service UE are required to support the different 5G
MBS service functionalities described in clause 6.9.1 in order to enable the
support of MC service group communications over MBS sessions.
### 6.9.3 Solution evaluation
This solution is proposed to provide a high-level description of the general
use of 5G MBS services for MC service group communications. 5G MBS services
are being specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19] and therefore, the solution still
relies on the specification of the corresponding functionalities to be able to
properly address the described aspects.
## 6.10 Solution 10: MBS session configuration and service announcement
aspects
### 6.10.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #13 and focuses on MBS session configuration
and MBS service announcement aspects.
#### 6.10.1.1 MBS session configuration aspects
When the MC service server decides to use MBS sessions for MC service group
communications, the MC service server is first required to configure with the
5GC one or more MBS sessions to deliver the data associated to the MC service
group communications. As being specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], the MBS
session configuration request includes the MBS session type and required
service requirements associated to the MBS session. Among other aspects, the
MBS session configuration request may also include MBS service area
information, which can be Cell ID list, TAI list or geographical area
information.
NOTE 1: It is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to
use multicast or broadcast MBS sessions for MC service group communications.
Unless the MB-SMF information is already available at the MC service server,
e.g., it is locally configured, the MC service server (directly or via
NEF/MBSF) performs an MB-SMF discovery and selection. This can be done by
requesting this information towards the 5GS during a session configuration
phase, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. For this purpose, MBS broadcast or
multicast session related information, among others, e.g., S-NSSAI(s) and
DNN(s) are utilized during an MB-SMF discovery.
Moreover, the MC service can decide to configure one MBS session per MC
service group. In principle, an MBS session should be sufficient to handle all
MC service group communications related to the corresponding MC service group,
where different service requirements can be addressed by different MBS QoS
flows within the MBS session. For instance, if different required QoS
requirements are considered for application level control messages, e.g. floor
control messages, and media for an MCPTT group call, a QoS flow can be
configured for the application level control messages and another QoS flow for
the media.
However, for the case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service server could
also decide to configure more than one MBS session per MC service group to
deliver the same MC service data. This can avoid creating a one-to-one mapping
between the members of an MC service group and the dedicated set of UEs
associated to a multicast MBS session. Hence, the MC service server can hide
any sensitive MC service group configuration from the 5GC.
NOTE 2: It is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to
configure one or multiple MBS sessions to transmit the MC service data
associated to an MC service group.
As in eMBMS, the MC service server could also decide to not permanently
associated an MBS session to a specific MC service group or MC service group
communication. This could particularly be applicable for broadcast MBS
sessions where all MC service UEs within a broadcast service area may be able
to receive the same broadcasted data. However, for the case of multicast MBS
sessions where the same data is only distributed to a specific set of users,
the MC service server should, therefore, configure an MBS session per MC
service group. In the case of co-existence of eMBMS and 5G MBS , MC service
server may also trigger the eMBMS bearer establishment to the underlying
network entity (NEF, or BMSC, or joint entity of BMSC and MBSF) based on the
RAT capabilities information of affiliated users of the MC service group.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS how the MC service server knows the RAT capabilities
information of the affiliated users.
The MC service server can decide to configure MBS sessions based on different
conditions. For instance, the MC service server can configure one or multiple
MBS sessions based on MC service group status, e.g., when a specific group is
active with affiliated users. This can be considered regardless if any MC
service group communication has been initiated. The MBS session(s) can later
be used by the MC service server for the different MC group communications
associated to the specific MC service group. For this case and based on the MC
service group configuration, the MC service server can in advance provide
expected required service requirements to be associated to the MBS session.
Also, the MC service server may dynamically update MBS sessions, e.g., to
modify service areas or provide new required service requirements on demand.
For this purpose, the MC service server initiates an MBS session update
towards the 5GS. As described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], this can either be an
MBS session update to the MB-SMF when PCC is not used, or an MBS session
configuration update to the PCF when PCC is used.
Likewise, the MC service server can also decide to dynamically configure MBS
sessions on demand based on, e.g., the establishment of specific MC service
group communications, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [2] for MBMS transmissions.
In the case of co-existence, the MC service server may decide also trigger the
eMBMS bearer establishment to the underlying network entity (NEF, or BMSC, or
joint entity of BMSC and MBSF) if some of the affiliated users of the MC
service group communications are accessing over 4G RAT type and with eMBMS
capability.
NOTE 3: It is implementation specific whether the MC service server decides to
configure MBS sessions in a pre-established mode or dynamic mode.
For multicast MBS sessions, as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], three states
have been defined: configured state, active state and inactive state. Based on
these states, after an MBS session is configured and the required network
resources are reserved, the MC service server can request the multicast MBS
sessions to be either in active or inactive state. For instance, the MC
service server can request the configuration of an MBS session in inactive
state while there are neither active group communications associated to a
specific MC service group nor MC data to be transmitted yet. The inactive
session can then be activated to reserve radio resources hence send MC data.
The activation may also be triggered by the MC the 5GC (in specific MB-UPF)
once it receives the MC data to be transmitted. The MC service server may
activate the MBS session once the MC service data becomes available to be
transmitted over the multicast MBS sessions, e.g. when a group communication
is established for the corresponding MC service group. This can be by
explicitly sending a multicast MBS session activation request towards the 5GC.
Hence, network resources can be handled in a more efficient way.
NOTE 4: For broadcast MBS sessions, the session is activated and started as
part of session configuration procedures, and network resources both in NG-RAN
and core network are reserved, as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
As part of the MBS session configuration, specific MBS information like MBS
session ID and how the data can be provided to be distributed over the MBS
session is defined and available at the MC service server.
Also, the MC service server can request the configuration of an MBS session
with two modes: transport only mode or enhanced service mode. In the transport
only mode, the MC service data is transmitted transparently through the 5GS.
In the enhanced service mode, the MBS services may include additional
services, e.g., FEC.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS how the MC service server can request and use
different service modes (either full-service mode or transport only mode) for
the configuration of MBS sessions depending on the corresponding further
specification in other working groups, e.g., SA2 and SA4 related
specification.
#### 6.10.1.2 MBS service announcement aspects
When an MBS session is configured, the MC service server shall announce the
corresponding MBS session(s) to the target MC users via an MBS service
announcement. As being defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], the MBS service
announcement shall include, among others, the MBS session ID, session type,
SDP information, and any other information required to enable that MC service
UEs can receive MC service data over a specific MBS session.
Based on the MBS service announcement the MC service UE can become able to
receive MC service data over the MBS session.
Table 6.10.1.2-1 specifically describes the MBS service announcement to be
sent from the MC service server to MC service clients to enable that MC
service UEs can receive MC service group communication data over MBS sessions.

#### 6.10.1.3 Procedure
The procedure in figure 6.10.1.3-1 describes how MBS session configuration and
MBS service announcement can be used for the transmission of MC service group
communication data over either multicast or broadcast MBS sessions.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and
affiliated to the same MC service group X.
\- The MC service server has decided to use an MBS session for MC service
group communications associated to MC service group X.
\- The MC service server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF
discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally
configured.
Figure 6.10.1.3-1: MBS service announcement for multicast and broadcast MBS
sessions
1\. The MC service server decides to configure a multicast or broadcast MBS
session targeting the MC service group X, e.g., based on the affiliation
status of the group members. As being specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], the
MBS session configuration procedure is initiated by the MC service server by
requesting an MBS session to the 5GC, where the session can either be
configured with or without PCC. The MC service server provides, among others,
the MBS session type and service requirements, e.g. required QoS, for the MBS
session. The MC service server may also indicate how data can be distributed
to the 5GC to be transmitted over the MBS session. As a response, the MC
service server receives the MBS session ID and other parameters associated to
the configured MBS session.
1a. In 5G MBS and 4G eMBMS co-existence use case, MC service server may
retrieve RAT capabilities supported by affiliated group members of MC service
group X. Based on the retrieved RAT capabilities, MC service server may decide
to additionally pre-establish 4G MBMS bearer for the MC service group X as
defined in TS 23.280 [2].
NOTE 1: For broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established as part of the
session configuration procedures, hence the network resources are reserved
both in 5GC and NG-RAN.
NOTE 2: Step 1a can apply to all the deployment scenarios, with and without
NEF, with and without MBSF.
NOTE 3: If MBSF and BMSC are co-located, TMGI for 4G MBMS can be the same as
5G MBS session ID.
NOTE 4: It is implementation specific, that the MC service server can decide
whether to trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearer (or the creation of MBS
session) or unicast bearer (or unicast PDU session) to serve the MC service
UE.
2\. The MC service server provides the MC service clients affiliated to MC
service group X with the information related to the configured MBS session via
an MBS service announcement. As described in table 6.10.1.2-1, the service
announcement includes information such as the MBS session ID, MBS session mode
(broadcast or multicast service type), and SDP information.
Optionally, if 4G eMBMS bearer(s) is pre-established in step 1a, the service
announcement also includes information for 4G eMBMS bearer(s) or optionally
the MBMS service announcement (2a) is sent with 4G eMBMS bearer(s) as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [2].
NOTE 5: The service announcement can either be sent via unicast PDU session,
or via an existing MBS session, and it can be repeated as needed.
For multicast MBS sessions, further information related to the MBS session may
be sent to enable that MC service clients join the announced multicast MBS
session.
For broadcast MBS sessions, the session announcement may indicate if the MC
service server requires the MC service client to actively monitor and report
the quality of the announced broadcast MBS session.
3\. MC service clients store and process the received MBS session information.
4\. MC service clients may provide an MBS service announcement acknowledgment
to the MC service server to indicate the reception of the corresponding MBS
service announcement.
5\. Based on the MBS session mode; either multicast or broadcast, the
following actions take place.
5a. For multicast MBS sessions, if MC service client is accessing over 5G, MC
service clients initiate a UE session join request towards the 5GC using the
information provided via the MBS service announcement. Hence, upon the first
successful UE session join request, the multicast is then established, and the
radio resources are reserved. The established session can either be in active
or inactive state as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
5b. For broadcast MBS sessions, if MC service client is accessing over 5G, the
MC service clients start monitoring the reception quality of the broadcast MBS
session. If indicated in the MBS service announcement information, MC service
clients report the monitoring state back to the MC service server.
If 4G eMBMS bearer(s) information is provided in service announcement and UE
is accessing over EPS, the MC service clients may start monitoring the
reception quality of the broadcast MBS session. If indicated in the MBS
service announcement information, MC service clients report the monitoring
state back to the MC service server.
> 6\. The MC service clients provide a notification related to the announced
> MBS session in the form of an MBS listening status report.
NOTE 6: It is implementation specific whether the broadcast reception quality
level is determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow
level via e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference
signals from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.
### 6.10.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
MC service server and MC service clients are required to support the different
5G MBS service functionalities in order to enable the support of MC service
group communications over MBS sessions.
### 6.10.3 Solution evaluation
This solution is proposed to address MBS session configuration and MBS service
announcement aspects for the support of MC service group communications over
MBS sessions. 5G MBS services are being specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19] and
therefore, the solution still relies on the specification of the corresponding
functionalities to be able to properly address the described aspects.
## 6.11 Solution 11: MC service group data transmissions over 5G MBS sessions
### 6.11.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #13 and focuses on how data related to MC
service group communications with different service requirements can be
transmitted over multicast or broadcast MBS sessions.
The MC service server can decide to configure an MBS session per MC service
group to transmit the data related to the corresponding MC service group
communications. Such group communications can comprise different service
requirements. For that, multicast and broadcast MBS sessions need to be
configured with multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service
requirements, e.g., different required QoS, provided by the MC service server.
For instance, application-level control messages or media associated to a
group communication can comprise different QoS requirement. Also, different
type of group communications can comprise different QoS requirements, e.g.,
emergency group calls should be handled with a higher priority than normal
group calls.
The configuration of multiple MBS QoS flows to address different service
requirements is associated to the assignment of different streams (e.g.,
different ports) within an MBS session.
Based on the functionalities being specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], the MC
service server can request the configuration of an MBS session providing in
advance required service requirements. However, dynamically, the MC service
server should also be able to provide additional service requirements for a
configured MBS session, e.g., based on the establishment of an MC service
group communication with a specific required QoS.
Furthermore, the MBS session establishment procedure depends on the MBS
session mode, i.e., whether the MBS session is of a broadcast or a multicast
type. In case of broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established as part of
the session configuration procedure where the NEF/MBSF initiates an MBS
session start request towards the MB-SMF in order to reserve the network
resources.
NOTE 1: The MC service server allocates an MBS session ID once (via TMGI
allocation request towards NEF/MBSF as part of the MBS session configuration
procedure), but the MBS session of type broadcast can start multiple times as
indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19] upon request to start MC data transmission.
On the other hand, a multicast MBS session is established when the first UE
session join request being sent from an MC service client towards the 5GS is
being accepted. The UE session join request is sent by the MC service UE as a
NAS message in the form of a PDU session modification request towards the 5GS.
The message indicates the MBS session ID(s) which the MC service UE is
requesting to join, as discussed in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. The established
multicast MBS session can either have an active or inactive state, where the
former indicates the activation of radio resources hence transmitting the MC
data to the associated MC service group, and the latter indicates their
deactivation as no MC data is being transmitted. The MC service server may
trigger the activation of multicast MBS sessions once the MC service group is
established and active, as well as once the MC data is available for
transmission. For this purpose, the MC service server sends a multicast MBS
session activation request towards the 5GC indicating the MBS session ID to be
activated. Similar to the use of eMBMS, the MC service server shall provide
the associated information between a specific group communication and the
stream to be used within an MBS session. This information could be sent in
advance over the MBS service announcement or should be provided on demand over
an additional signalling message over the MBS session, e.g., like the
MapGroupToBearer in eMBMS. For that, table 6.11.1-1 defines the
MapGroupToSessionStream to be sent from the MC service server to MC service
clients to provide specific required information to receive the data related
to a group communication within an MBS session.
Table 6.11.1-1: MapGroupToSessionStream
Information element Status Description
* * *
MC service group ID M This element identifies the MC service group related to
a group communication to be delivered over the MBS session Media stream
identifier M This element identifies the media stream of the SDP used for the
group communication within the MBS session MBS session ID O The MBS session
identifier if the MapGroupToSessionStream message is not sent on the same
session as the MC media
In the case of co-existence, the MC service server may decide also trigger the
eMBMS bearer establishment to the underlying network entity (NEF, or BMSC, or
joint entity of BMSC and MBSF) if some of the affiliated group members of the
MC service group communications are accessing over 4G RAT type and with eMBMS
capability. For those affiliated group members accessing over 5G, MCX service
will also send the MapGroupToBearer as it defined in TS 23.280 [2].
#### 6.11.1.1 Procedure
The procedure in figure 6.11.1.1-1 describes how data related to a specific
group communication can be distributed over a configured MBS session which
consist of multiple QoS flows, i.e. addressing different service requirements.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and
affiliated to the same MC service group X.
\- The MC service server has decided to use an MBS session for MC service
group communications associated to MC service group X.
\- MC service clients 2 to n are within the MBS service area where the MBS
session is configured.
Figure 6.11.1.1-1: MC service group data transmission over MBS sessions
1\. The MC service server configures a multicast or broadcast MBS session
targeting group communications associated to MC service group X, as being
specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. Therefore, the MC service server can provide
default service requirements to be addressed by the MBS session, e.g.,
associated to MC 5QIs and specific allocation and retention priority (ARP) to
transmit the media associated to MC service group communications.
Optionally, the MC service server may decide also to trigger the eMBMS bearer
establishment to the underlying network entity (NEF, or BMSC, or joint entity
of BMSC and MBSF) if some of the affiliated group members of the MC service
group communications are accessing over 4G RAT type and with eMBMS capability.
The MBS session is announced and received by MC service client 2 to n, which
are within the MBS service area. The MC service server has identified that MC
service clients 2 to n can receive data over the MBS sessions, e.g. based on a
notification from the MC service clients indicating the successful join of the
multicast MBS session or a monitoring report of the broadcast MBS session
(similar to the listening status report used for MBMS).
4G eMBMS bearer is announced if established to MC service client x which are
accessing over EPS.
NOTE: It is implementation specific, that the MC service server can decide
whether to trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearer (or the creation of MBS
session) or unicast bearer (or unicast PDU session) to serve the MC service
UE.
2\. A new MC service group communication is established for the MC service
group X consisting of a specific required QoS, e.g., an MC service emergency
group communication. The group communication setup can be done over unicast.
2a. For broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established upon sending a
session start request as part of the MBS session configuration procedure,
which is described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
2b. For multicast MBS session, the session is established upon the acceptance
of the first UE session join request initiated from the MC service UE towards
the 5GS, as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. The multicast session can then
have either active or inactive state.
3\. The MC service server may send a multicast MBS session activation request
towards the 5GC in order to activate the multicast MBS session in case the
session has an inactive state. For this purpose, the MC service server
indicates the MBS session ID to be activated.
4\. Considering that the established group communication requires a specific
QoS, e.g., an MC service emergency group communication which requires higher
priority (i.e., better ARP), the MC service server requests an MBS session
update to the 5GS to provide the new required QoS, if not done during the MBS
session configuration in step 1. The MBS session configuration should then be
updated and an additional QoS flow may be configured.
5\. The MC service server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream to MC service
clients 2 to n over the configured MBS session providing the required stream
information to receive the media related to the specific established MC
service group communication within the MBS session.
5a. Optionally, MCX service will also send the MapGroupToBearer to those
affiliated group members if exist accessing over 5G as it defined in TS 23.280
[2].
6\. MC service clients process the MapGroupToSessionStream information to
receive the related media over the specific MBS session stream.
7\. MC service client 1 sends media to the MC service server over unicast to
be distributed for the established group communication.
8\. The MC service server distributes the media to MC service clients 2 to n
over the indicated stream within the established MBS session.
### 6.11.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
MC service server and MC service clients are required to support the different
5G MBS service functionalities in order to enable the support of MC service
group communications over MBS sessions.
### 6.11.3 Solution evaluation
This solution is proposed to address group data transmission over MBS sessions
considering different group service requirements. 5G MBS services are being
specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19] and therefore, the solution still relies on
the specification of the corresponding functionality to be able to properly
address the described aspects.
## 6.12 Solution 12: Dynamic multicast MBS session and service announcement
### 6.12.1 Description
This solution is to address the key issue #13 on use of multicast MBS session
for MC service data delivery in following aspects :
_1) identify 5G MBS features and configuration options which are applicable
for MC service;_
_3) how to make the group members aware of the broadcast/multicast service for
the group communication;_
This solution is based on the transport only mode. This solution provides the
procedure which allows the MC service server to make some preparations before
delivering the MC service data (e.g., DL media, application layer control
signallings such as e.g., floor control, service announcement) over the
multicast MBS session including the multicast MBS session configuration,
service announcement, UE join and session establishment.
#### 6.12.1.1 Procedure
In this procedure, the group communication session is already established and
the PDU session is used for the DL transmission. When the MC service server
decides to use an multicast MBS session for the DL transmission, the MC
service server interacts with 5GC to prepare the necessary network resource
for the multicast MBS delivery and instructs the UE to join the multicast MBS
session.
NOTE 1: The MC service server logic for determining when to establish the new
multicast MBS session is implementation specific.
The procedure in figure 6.12.1.1-1 shows only one of the receiving MC service
clients receiving the multicast MBS session. There might also be MC service
clients in the same MC group communication session that receive the
communication on PDU session.
Pre-conditions:
1\. No multicast MBS session exists or the existing multicast MBS session
fails to satisfy the QoS requirements.
2\. The MC service server may already retrieve the TMGI from the 5GC as
specified in TS 23.247 [19].
Figure 6.12.1.1-1: Dynamic multicast MBS session and service announcement
1\. An MC service group communication session is established as specified in
TS 23.379 [3], TS 23.281 [4], or TS 23.282 [5].
2\. The downlink data is sent via unicast delivery.
3\. The MC service server configures the multicast MBS session for the group
communication session according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.247
[19]. The multicast MBS session associated information is returned from the
5GC (e.g., TMGI, ingress address). If local MBS service is requested, the MC
service server provides the MBS service area information to the 5GC.
Optionally, the MC service server may decide also trigger the eMBMS bearer
establishment to the underlying network entity (NEF, or BMSC, or joint entity
of BMSC and MBSF) if some of the affiliated group members of the MC service
group communications are accessing over 4G RAT type and with eMBMS capability.
NOTE: It is implementation specific, that the MC service server can decide
whether to trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearer (or the creation of MBS
session) or unicast bearer (or unicast PDU session) to serve the MC service
UE.
4\. The MC service server provides service description information associated
with the multicast MBS session (e.g., MBS session ID (i.e., TMGI or source
specific IP multicast address), SDP information, announcement acknowledgment,
join status report indication). The join status report indication is included
to instruct the MC service clients to report the join status after it has
successfully joined the multicast MBS session and is able to receive the data
over the multicast MBS session.
If local MBS service is used, the MC service server includes the MBS service
area in the multicast MBS service announcement.
5\. The MC service client stores the MBS session ID and other associated
information.
Optionally, if 4G eMBMS bearer(s) is established in step 4 the service
announcement also includes information for 4G eMBMS bearer(s) or optionally
the MBMS service announcement (4a) is sent with 4G eMBMS bearer(s) as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [2].
6\. Based on the multicast MBS service announcement, the MC service client
determines to join the multicast MBS session with the received MBS session ID
as specified in 3GPP TS 23.247[19]. The multicast MBS session establishment is
triggered by the first accepted UE Join request.

##### 6.12.1.2.1 Multicast MBS service announcement

announcement from the MC service server to the MC service client.

### 6.12.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
MC service server functionality impact is supporting the 5G multicast MBS
session related functionalities by acting the AF in the 5G MBS architecture
including:
\- configuring the 5GS multicast MBS session;
\- Service announcement towards the UE;
The MC service client needs to support the handling of the multicast MBS
service announcement with multicast MBS session information.
### 6.12.3 Solution evaluation
This solution enables the MC service server to prepare the multicast network
resource for the MC group communication and make the UE to aware of the
multicast MBS session information to receive the data over this multicast MBS
session.
## 6.13 Solution 13: Pre-established multicast MBS session and service
announcement
### 6.13.1 Description
This solution is to address the key issue #13 on use of multicast MBS session
for MC service data delivery in following aspects :
_1) identify 5G MBS features and configuration options which are applicable
for MC service;_
_3) how to make the group members aware of the broadcast/multicast service for
the group communication;_
This solution is based on the transport only mode. This solution provides the
procedure which allows the MC service server to make some preparations before
delivering the MC service data (e.g., DL media, application layer control
signallings such as e.g., floor control, service announcement) over the
multicast MBS session including the multicast MBS session configuration,
service announcement, UE join and session establishment before the group
communication is established.
The following steps needs to be performed prior the MC group communication is
established:
\- The multicast MBS session configuration;
\- Announce the MBS session information to the MC service clients;
\- MC service UE joins the multicast MBS session and the multicast MBS session
is established.
NOTE 1: The MC service server logic for determining when to establish the new
multicast MBS session is implementation specific.
#### 6.13.1.1 Procedure
The procedure figure 6.13.1.1-1 shows only one of the receiving MC service
clients receiving the multicast MBS session. There might also be MC service
clients in the same MC group communication session that receive the
communication on PDU session.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The pre-established multicast session is pre-established for any group
communication or for a certain group communication, and it is able to satisfy
the MC group communication.
2\. The MC service server already retrieves the TMGI from the 5GC as specified
in TS 23.247 [19].
Figure 6.13.1.1-1: Pre-established multicast MBS session and service
announcement
1\. The MC service server configures the multicast MBS session for the group
communication session according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.247
[19]. The multicast MBS session associated information is returned from the
5GC (e.g., TMGI, ingress address). If local MBS service is requested, the MC
service server provides the MBS service area information to the 5GC.
2\. The MC service server provides service description information associated
with the multicast MBS session (e.g., MBS session ID (i.e., TMGI or source
specific IP multicast address), SDP information, announcement acknowledgment,
join status report indication). The join status report indication is included
to instruct the MC service client to report the join status after it has
successfully joined the multicast MBS session and is able to receive the data
over the multicast MBS session.
If local MBS service is used, the MC service server includes the MBS service
area in the multicast MBS service announcement.
3\. The MC service client stores the MBS session ID.
4\. After receiving the multicast MBS service announcement, the MC service
client determines to join the multicast MBS session with the received MBS
session ID as specified in 3GPP TS 23.247[19]. The multicast MBS session
establishment is triggered by the first accepted UE Join request.
5\. An MC service group communication session is established as specified in
TS 23.379 [3], TS 23.281 [4], or TS 23.282 [5]. The MC service server
determines to use the existing multicast MBS session for this group
communication.
6\. If the pre-established multicast MBS session fails to satisfy the group
communication, the MC service server interacts with the 5GC to update the
service requirement of the multicast MBS session.

This solution enables the MC service server to prepare the multicast network
resource for the MC group communication and make the UE to aware of the
multicast MBS session information to receive the data over this multicast MBS
session.
## 6.14 Solution 14: Dynamic broadcast MBS session and service announcement
### 6.14.1 Description
This solution is to address the key issue #13 on use of broadcast MBS session
for MC service data delivery in following aspects :
_1) identify 5G MBS features and configuration options which are applicable
for MC service;_
_3) how to make the group members aware of the broadcast/multicast service for
the group communication;_
This solution is based on the transport only mode. This solution provides the
procedure which allows the MC service server to make some preparations before
delivering the MC service data (e.g., DL media, application layer control
signallings such as e.g., floor control, service announcement) over the
broadcast MBS session including the broadcast MBS session configuration,
service announcement.
#### 6.14.1.1 Procedure
In this procedure, the group communication session is already established and
the PDU session is used for the DL transmission. When the MC service server
decides to use an broadcast MBS session for the DL transmission, the MC
service server prepares the necessary network resource for the broadcast
delivery.
NOTE 1: The MC service server logic for determining when to establish the
broadcast MBS session is implementation specific. e.g., based on the number of
the UEs that are a part of the group communication session reach to a certain
threshold.
The procedure figure 6.14.1.1-1 shows only one of the receiving MC service
clients receiving the broadcast MBS session. There might also be MC service
clients in the same MC group communication session that receive the
communication on PDU session. Pre-conditions:
1\. No broadcast MBS session exists or the existing broadcast MBS session
fails to satisfy the QoS requirements.
2\. The MC service server may already retrieve the MBS session ID (i.e., TMGI)
from the 5GC as specified in TS 23.247 [19].
Figure 6.14.1.1-1: Dynamic broadcast MBS session and service announcement
1\. An MC service group communication session is established as specified in
TS 23.379 [3], TS 23.281 [4], or TS 23.282 [5].
2\. The downlink data is sent via unicast delivery.
3\. The MC service server configures the broadcast MBS session for the group
communication session according to the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.247
[19]. The broadcast MBS session associated information (e.g., TMGI, ingress
address) is returned from the 5GC. If local MBS service is requested, the MC
service server provides the MBS service area information to the 5GC.
Optionally, the MC service server may decide also trigger the eMBMS bearer
establishment to the underlying network entity (NEF, or BMSC, or joint entity
of BMSC and MBSF) if some of the affiliated group members of the MC service
group communications are accessing over 4G RAT type and with eMBMS capability.
NOTE: It is implementation specific, that the MC service server can decide
whether to trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearer (or the creation of MBS
session) or unicast bearer (or unicast PDU session) to serve the MC service
UE.
4\. The MC service server provides service description information associated
with the broadcast MBS session (e.g., TMGI, SDP information, announcement
acknowledgment).
Optionally, if 4G eMBMS bearer(s) is established in step 3, the service
announcement also includes information for 4G eMBMS bearer(s) or optionally
the MBMS service announcement (3a) is sent with 4G eMBMS bearer(s) as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [2].
If local MBS service is used, the MC service server includes the MBS service
area in the broadcast MBS service announcement.
5\. The MC service client stores the TMGI(s) and other associated information.
6\. After receiving the broadcast MBS service announcement, the MC service
client starts to monitor the reception quality of the broadcast MBS session
immediately or when the UE enters the broadcast service area.

#### 6.16.1.1 Procedures
The procedure figure 6.16.1.1-1 shows only one of the receiving MC service
clients receiving the multicast MBS session. There might also be MC service
clients in the same MC group communication session that receive the
communication on PDU session.
Pre-conditions:
  1. The multicast MBS session is already configured and announced to the MC service clients as specified in clause 6.12 or 6.13.
  2. MC service UE has successfully joined the multicast MBS session and the multicast MBS session is established.
Figure 6.16.1.1-1: Data delivery over multicast MBS session
1\. An MC service group communication session has been established and the DL
data does not start yet or is transmitted over unicast delivery already.
2\. After the MC service UE has successfully joined the multicast MBS session
(e.g., receiving relevant PDU session modification accept message associated
the multicast MBS session), the MC service client sends the multicast session
status report to the MC service server indicating that it successfully joined
the multicast MBS session and is able to receive data over the multicast MBS
session
3\. The MC service server based on the multicast session status reports from
the participants e.g., all the affiliated group members or required affiliated
members have successfully joined the multicast MBS session, determines to
utilize the multicast MBS session for the group communication DL data (e.g.,
DL media, application control signalling) delivery.
4\. The MC service server sends the MapGroupToSessionStream messages to the
joined MC service client(s) via the multicast MBS session. The media stream
and MC service group ID are included to inform the MC service client to
receive the group communication data with the multicast MBS session. The
MapGroupToSessionStream message may be sent via the broadcast MBS session
periodically.
5\. If the acknowledgement indication is included in the
MapGroupToSessionStream, the MC service client(s) may send the acknowledgement
message to the MC service server.
6\. The MC service server starts to send the MC service data to via the
multicast MBS session immediately, or after a while from step 4, or based on
the acknowledgement message(s) received from the MC service client(s).
For the MC service client whose acknowledgement is not received due to e.g.,
entering CM-connected status late, the MC service server may also send the
MapGroupToSessionStream and the MC service data via the unicast delivery.
7\. The MC service client receives the DL data via the multicast MBS session.
If the DL data is already transmitted via the unicast delivery, the MC service
client(s) may receive the DL data via both the unicast delivery and multicast
MBS session for some time.
8\. In the case that the DL data is already transmitted via the unicast
delivery, if the acknowledgement of MapGroupToSessionStream from the MC
service client is received if applicable, the MC service server determines to
stop the unicast delivery to the joined users. The MC service server may also
determine to stop the unicast delivery to the joined users after some while
from sending DL data via the multicast MBS session.

This solution enables the MC service server to determine when to send MC
service data via the multicast MBS session and when to stop unicast delivery
towards the joined MC service users.
## 6.17 Solution 17: Data delivery over broadcast MBS session
### 6.17.1 Description
This solution is to address the key issue #13 on MC service data delivery over
broadcast MBS session in following aspects :
_5) how the DL media, application level control signalling (e.g., floor
control messages), group status is delivered to the UE via the 5G MBS._
This solution is based on the transport only mode. This solution provides the
procedure which allows the MC service client to report the broadcast reception
quality to the MC service server which is used to make the decision whether to
deliver the MC service data over the broadcast MBS session, and further stop
the unicast delivery for the participants who has received the MC service data
over broadcast.
An MC service client monitors the broadcast MBS session to receive MC service
data. Based on the received quality (e.g. radio level quality, RTP packet
loss), the MC service client needs to inform the MC service server that the MC
service client is able to receive the MC service media with sufficient quality
or not able to receive the MC service media session with sufficient quality
from the broadcast MBS. Furthermore, based on the received quality, the MC
service client may notify the MC service server at which broadcast reception
quality level it has received the MC service media on the broadcast MBS
session.
This estimation of the broadcast reception quality may be dependent on for
example the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and measurements from the
reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), RTP packet loss, BLER of the
received data.
The MC service data delivered over the broadcast MBS session may be:
> \- DL media;
>
> \- Transmission control message (e.g. floor taken);
>
> \- MBS service announcement;
>
> \- Group application paging;
>
> \- Group dynamic data (e.g. status of the group, group call is on-going or
> not);
>
> \- Group state (e.g. emergency alerts);
#### 6.17.1.1 Procedures
The procedure figure 6.17.1.1-1 shows only one of the receiving MC service
clients receiving the broadcast MBS session. There might also be MC service
clients in the same MC group communication session that receive the
communication on PDU session.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The broadcast MBS session is already configured, established and announced
to the MC service clients as specified in clause 6.15.
Figure 6.17.1.1-1: Data delivery over broadcast MBS session
1\. An MC service group communication session has been established and the DL
data does not start yet or the DL data is already transmitted over unicast
delivery.
2\. The MC service client that enters or is in the service area of the
announced TMGI determines that the broadcast reception quality is sufficient
to receive the broadcast data and shall be reported to the MC service server.
The MC service client may also map the determined broadcast reception quality
to a broadcast reception quality level. The broadcast reception quality level
indicates at which specific broadcast reception quality level the MC service
media has been received. Based on the report message, the MC service server
may efficiently decide to deliver the MC service data via the broadcast MBS
session.
NOTE 1: The set of MBS reception quality levels and the mapping of the
determined broadcast reception quality to those levels are implementation.
NOTE 2: It is implementation specific whether the broadcast reception quality
level is determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow
level via e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference
signals from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.
3\. The MC service client sends the MBS listening status report to the MC
service sever. The report may be sent multiple times due to the broadcast
reception quality level changes.
4\. The MC service server based on the reports from the participants e.g.,
numbers of participants which is able to receive data over broadcast MBS
session reach a certain threshold, determines to utilize the broadcast MBS
session for the MC service data (e.g., DL media, application layer control
signalling).
5\. The MC service server sends the MapGroupToSessionStream messages to the
joined MC service client(s) via the broadcast MBS session. The media stream
and MC service group ID are included to inform the MC service client to
receive the group communication data with the broadcast MBS session. The
MapGroupToSessionStream message may be sent via the broadcast MBS session
periodically.
6\. If the acknowledgement indication is included in the
MapGroupToSessionStream, the MC service client(s) may send the acknowledgement
message to the MC service server.
7\. The MC service server starts to send the MC service data to via the
broadcast MBS session immediately, or after a while from step 5, or based on
the acknowledgement message(s) received from the MC service client(s).
8\. The MC service client receives the DL data via the broadcast MBS session.
If the DL data is already transmitted via the unicast delivery, the MC service
client (s) may receive the DL MC service data via both the unicast delivery
and broadcast MBS session for some time.
9\. In the case that the DL data is already transmitted via the unicast
delivery, if the acknowledgement of MapGroupToSessionStream from the MC
service client is received if applicable, the MC service server determines to
stop the unicast delivery to the users who receives the data via the broadcast
MBS session. The MC service server may also determine to stop the unicast
delivery to these users after some while from sending DL data via the
broadcast MBS session.

##### 6.17.1.2.2 MapGroupToSessionStream
Refer to clause 6.16.1.2.2.
### 6.17.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
MC service client needs to support the MBS listening status report towards the
MC service server via the application layer after detecting the broadcast
reception quality changes.
MC service server needs to support the handling of the MBS listening status
report.
### 6.17.3 Solution evaluation
This solution enables the MC service server to determine when to send MC
service data via the broadcast MBS session and when to stop unicast delivery
towards the MC service users who is able to receive the MC service data over
the broadcast MBS session.
## 6.18 Solution 18: Service continuity for multicast MBS session
### 6.18.1 Description
This solution is to address the key issue #13 on MC service data delivery over
broadcast MBS session in following aspects :
_4) how to maintain the service continuity when switching between 5G MBS
delivery and unicast delivery._
This solution is based on the transport only mode.
Once the MC service UE has successfully joined the multicast MBS session, and
started to receive the MC service data via the multicast MBS session, then the
network mechanism specified in TS 23.247(e.g. mobility of Multicast MBS
session as specified in clause 6.3.1 of TS 23.247 and UP management as
specified in clause 6.7 of TS 23.247) will deliver the data from the MC
service server via the Individual MBS traffic delivery method or the 5GC
Shared MBS traffic delivery method towards the MC service UE. The MC service
server does not need to be aware of the MC service UE is in idle or connected
status and the UE mobility among NG-RAN(s) with different MBS capabilities
(i.e., support MBS or not support MBS).
### 6.18.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
Same impacts as the solution of Data delivery over multicast MBS session.
### 6.18.3 Solution evaluation
This solution relies on network mechanisms specified in TS 23.247 to maintain
the service continuity during the UE mobility without any extra application
layer mechanism.
## 6.19 Solution 19: Service continuity for broadcast MBS session
### 6.19.1 Description
This solution is to address the key issue #13 on MC service data delivery over
broadcast MBS session in following aspects :
_4) how to maintain the service continuity when switching between 5G MBS
delivery and unicast delivery._
This solution is based on the transport only mode.
This solution provides the procedure which allows the MC service client to
report the broadcast reception quality to the MC service server which is used
to make the decision whether to resume the unicast delivery to the MC service
UE(s) which suffering bad broadcast reception quality due to e.g., move out of
the broadcast service area.
An MC service client monitors the broadcast MBS session to receive MC service
data. Based on the received quality (e.g. radio level quality, RTP packet
loss), the MC service client needs to inform the MC service server that the MC
service client is able to receive the MC service media on the broadcast MBS
session with sufficient quality or not.
This estimation of the broadcast reception quality may be dependent on for
example the modulation and coding scheme (MCS) and measurements from the
reference signals from the NG-RAN node(s), RTP packet loss, BLER of the
received data.
#### 6.19.1.1 Procedures
The procedure in figure 6.19.1.1-1 illustrates the UE is receiving data via
broadcast MBS session and suffers bad broadcast reception quality due to e.g.,
moving out of the broadcast service area. It shows only one of the receiving
MC service clients receiving the broadcast MBS session.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC group communication is ongoing and the MC service data (e.g., DL
media, application layer control signalling) is transmitted via broadcast MBS
session.
2\. The MC service client is receiving the MC service data (e.g., DL media,
application layer control signalling) via the broadcast MBS session.
3\. The MC service client(s) already have the associated information (e.g.,
SDP) to receive the unicast delivery during the group communication
establishment phase.
Figure 6.19.1.1-1: Service continuity from broadcast to unicast
1\. An MC service group communication session is ongoing and the DL data is
transmitted over broadcast MBS session.
2\. The MC service client detects that it suffers bad broadcast reception due
to e.g., moving out of the broadcast service area of the announced TMGI. The
MC service client may determine the broadcast reception quality by using the
BLER of the received data. When no data is received, the quality estimation
can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding scheme (MCS).
3\. The MC service client sends MBS listening status report which indicates
the broadcast reception quality associated with the TMGI is not sufficient to
receive data. The MC service client may also map the determined broadcast
reception quality to a broadcast reception quality level. The broadcast
reception quality level indicates at which specific broadcast reception
quality level the MC service media has been received.
NOTE 1: It is implementation that the broadcast reception quality level can be
determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via
e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference signals
from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.
NOTE 2: The set of MBS reception quality levels and the mapping of the
determined broadcast reception quality to those levels are implementation.
NOTE 3: The frequency of MC service UE sending listening reports can be
limited to prevent signalling congestion. E.g. The MC service UE can stop
monitoring the broadcast reception quality and send the MBS listening status
report only once when it moves outside of the broadcast service area.
4\. The MC service server based on the report from the participant, determines
that the UE is not able to receive the data or the QoS requirements is not
satisfied. The MC service server determines to send the MC service data (e.g.,
DL media, application layer control signalling) via the unicast delivery to
the reported MC service client.
5\. If the unicast QoS flow is not satisfied, the MC service server interacts
with the 5GC to update the QoS requirements.
6\. The MC service server sends the MC service data via the unicast delivery
towards the MC service client which suffers bad broadcast reception quality.
7\. The MC service client then receives the DL MC service via both the unicast
delivery.
The procedure in figure 6.19.1.1-2 illustrates the UE which is switched to
unicast delivery after leaving the broadcast service area and again enters
into the broadcast service area where the NG-RAN is broadcasting the MC
service data of the ongoing group communication. The MC service client now is
able to receive the broadcast data again. It shows only one of the receiving
MC service clients receiving the broadcast MBS session.
Pre-conditions:
1\. The MC group communication is ongoing and the MC service data (e.g., DL
media, application layer control signalling) is transmitted via broadcast MBS
session in the broadcast service areas.
2\. The MC service client is receiving the MC service data (e.g., DL media,
application layer control signalling) via the unicast delivery.
3\. The MC service client has already received the broadcast MBS session
service announcement, MapGroupToSessionStream information and enters into the
broadcast service area again.
Figure 6.19.1.1-2: Service continuity from unicast back to broadcast
1\. An MC service group communication session is ongoing and the broadcast MBS
session is used to deliver the MC service data of the group communication. The
MC service client is receiving the MC service data via the unicast delivery.
2\. The MC service client detects that it is able to receive the broadcast
data due to e.g., moving into the broadcast service area of the announced
TMGI. The MC service client may determine the broadcast reception quality by
using the BLER of the received data. When no data is received, the quality
estimation can consider the reference signals and the modulation and coding
scheme (MCS).
3\. The MC service client sends MBS listening status report which indicates
the broadcast reception quality associated with the TMGI is sufficient to
receive data. The MC service client may also map the determined broadcast
reception quality to a broadcast reception quality level. The broadcast
reception quality level indicates at which specific broadcast reception
quality level the MC service media has been received.
NOTE 1: The set of MBS reception quality levels and the mapping of the
determined broadcast reception quality to those levels are implementation.
NOTE 2: It is implementation that the broadcast reception quality level can be
determined per MBS session, per media stream or per MBS QoS flow level via
e.g., measurements of radio level signalling such as the reference signals
from the NG-RAN node(s), packet loss.
4\. Based on the MapGroupToSessionStream received before, the MC service
client receives the DL MC service via both the broadcast MBS session and the
unicast delivery.
NOTE 3: If any information about the broadcast MBS session stream has changed,
the MC service server provides the MapGroupToSessionStream again.
5\. The MC service server based on the report from the participant, determines
to stop sending the MC service data (e.g., DL media, application layer control
signalling) via the unicast delivery to the reported MC service client. After
then, the MC service client receives the MC service data only via the
broadcast MBS session.
#### 6.19.1.2 Information flows
##### 6.19.1.2.1 MBS listening status report
Table 6.19.1.2.1-1 describes the information flow of MBS listening status
report from the MC service client to the MC service server.

Information element Status Description
* * *
MBS session ID(s) M The identity of the broadcast MBS session(s) being
monitored. It is the TMGI type. MC service ID M Identity of the MC service
user who is reporting the session status MBS listening status M The broadcast
listening status per TMGI. MBS reception quality level O The reception quality
level Unicast listening status O The unicast listening status associated with
the unicast delivery. NOTE: The set of quality levels helps service continuity
in broadcast scenarios. A reception quality level may help to make an
efficient switching decision to unicast delivery. How these levels are used is
implementation specific.
### 6.19.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
MC service client and MC service server need to support the MBS listening
status report.
### 6.19.3 Solution evaluation
This solution enables the service continuity when UE is moving out of the
broadcast service area and re-enter the broadcast service area again by
reporting the broadcast reception quality to the the MC service server.
Further the MC service server can determine whether to stop or resume the
unicast delivery toward the reported MC service client.
## 6.20 Solution 20: Selection of multicast and broadcast service for a group
communication
### 6.20.1 Description
This solution is to address the key issue #13 on how to select the broadcast
service or multicast service for a group communication.
This solution is based on the transport only mode.
Both the multicast MBS session and broadcast MBS session can be used to enable
the the point-to-multipoint tranmission for a group communication. When
selecting the multicast and broadcast service for a group communication the
following principles is considered:
\- During the group communication lifetime, either the multicast MBS service
or the broadcast MBS service is used to enable the point-to-multipoint
transmission for a group communication. Both or the dynamic switch between
multicast and broadcast session are not supported.
\- For a specific group communication, the selection of multicast MBS session
or broadcast MBS session is determined by the MC service server and
implementation specific. The following aspect maybe considered: the MC service
operator\'s policy, static group configuration e.g., specify the MBS session
type to be used in the group configuration data, or dynamically group
attributes e.g., group size, service type, group is a broadcast group etc.
\- If multiple selection criteria is used, the precedence shall be specified.
For example the order of precedence may be dynamically group attributes,
static group configuration, MC service operator\'s policy.
### 6.20.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MC service server needs to support the selection of multicast or broadcast
service for a group communication.
### 6.20.3 Solution evaluation
This solution provides a mechanism for the MC service server to select the
multicast or broadcast service to enable the point-to-multipoint transmission
for a group communication.
## 6.21 Solution 21: Use of MBS transmission in MCPTT
### 6.21.1 Description
This solution is to address the key issue #13 on MC service data delivery over
broadcast MBS session for MCPTT specific aspect.
Both the media packets as well as the application layer signaling e.g., floor
control messages to the receiving users may be sent via the same MBS session
with different MBS QoS flows, or via different MBS sessions.
For broadcast MBS sessions, MCPTT may use pre-established broadcast MBS
session for the different types of MCPTT group calls. Both pre-arranged group
calls and chat group calls can use the pre-established broadcast MBS session
for distributing the DL data. The broadcast MBS session can be used by any
group. Depending on the capacity of the MBMS bearer, the broadcast MBS session
can be used to broadcast one or more group calls in parallel. For multicast
MBS session, a multicast MBS session can be only used by one group at a time.
The MCPTT service shall support the procedure for using pre-established MBS
sessions as described in clause 6.13 and 6.15 and the MCPTT-1, MCPTT-6A,
MCPTT‑8 and MCPTT-9 reference points as defined in clause 6.8.
MCPTT may use dynamic MBS session establishment for the different types of
MCPTT group calls. Both pre-arranged group calls and chat group calls can use
the dynamic MBS session for distributing the DL data. The MCPTT service shall
support the procedure for using dynamic MBS sessions as as described in clause
6.12 and 6.14 and the MCPTT-1, MCPTT-6A, MCPTT‑8 and MCPTT-9 reference points
as defined in clause 6.8.
When using the procedures for pre-established or dynamic MBS session
establishment for MCPTT, the MCPTT server perform the procedure of call
connect and disconnect over MBS session as defined in clause 6.21.2 at the
group communication session establishment phase.
### 6.21.2 Call connect and disconnect over MBS session procedures
#### 6.21.2.1 General
MBS session can be used for MCPTT group calls. One MBS session may be not
permanently associated to one specific group or group call. Before sending
media packets of a group call over MBS session, the MCPTT server shall send
the association information between group call and the MBS session. The group
call setup procedure indicates the media stream within one MBS session that is
used for the specific group call. When the group call over the MBS session is
finished, this temporary association information of an MCPTT group call to
specific resources on a MBS session is undone. The procedure in figure
6.21.2.1-1 requires that the group session is setup before the media
transmission start. This eliminates the need for the receiving clients to
continuously use a unicast bearer. Prior to this the MBS session is activated
and announced to the MCPTT clients.
#### 6.21.2.2 Procedure
##### 6.21.2.2.1 Group call connect over MBS session
In figure 6.21.2.2.1-1 the MCPTT client 1 is the client that initiate an MCPTT
chat group call and also the transmitting client. MCPTT client 1 may, but does
not have to be in a broadcast service area if the MBS session is broadcast MBS
session. The MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client N represents MCPTT clients
receiving the MCPTT call over an MBS session. There may be other receiving
clients over unicast delivery or over this MBS session, however they are not
illustrated in this figure.
The same procedure as for chat group call can also be applied for pre-arranged
calls. However, that requires that the pre-arranged sessions are already
active. If a pre-arranged group session is initiated the use of pre-
established sessions are required.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MBS session is already established and announced to the participating
users. For multicast MBS session, the the participating users have
successfully joined the call and notify the MCPTT server. For the broadcast
MBS session, the participating users have notified the listening status to the
MCPTT server.
\- All users participating in the MCPTT group call are already affiliated to
the group.
\- All participating users have joined the group session.
Figure 6.21.2.2.1-1: Group call connect on MBS session
1\. MCPTT client 1 initiate the MCPTT group call by sending an initial floor
request over a PDU session to the MCPTT server (reference point MCPTT-4).
2\. The MCPTT server will send a MapGroupToMBSsession message over a
previously activated MBS session to all users that will receive the call via
the MBS delivery. The MapGroupToMBSsession message includes association
information between the group call and MBS session. The MapGroupToMBSsession
message includes MCPTT group ID and information about the media stream
identifier of the established MBS session and may include the MBS session
identifier (e.g., the TMGI) of the MBS session for the DL media. The message
is sent over reference point MCPTT-9.
If the acknowledgement indication is included in the MapGroupToMBSsession, the
MCPTT client(s) may send the acknowledgement message to the MCPTT server.
NOTE 1: Step 2 can be deferred until step 4 and the MapGroupToMBSsession
message can then be included in the floor taken message.
3\. The MCPTT server grants the right to transmit for MCPTT client 1 and by
that sends a floor granted message to the MCPTT client 1. This message is sent
over a unicast bearer (reference point MCPTT-4).
4\. A floor taken message is sent from the MCPTT server to all receiving
users. This message includes the MCPTT ID of the transmitting MCPTT client as
well as the MCPTT group ID. The message is sent over the MBS session. The
message is sent over reference point MCPTT-9.
5\. The media is sent from MCPTT client 1 to the MCPTT server over unicast
bearer and from the MCPTT server to the MCPTT client 2 and MCPTT client 3 over
the MBS session.
NOTE 2: Additional floor request messages in the same call will not trigger
the MapGroupToMBSsession message to be sent.
##### 6.21.2.2.2 Group call disconnect from MBS session
Figure 6.21.2.2.2-1 shows the high level procedure where an
UnmapGroupFromMBSsession message is sent by the MCPTT server to the MCPTT
clients to indicate that the MCPTT group call is being dissociated from the
MBS session.
Pre-conditions:
\- An MCPTT group call is ongoing; the DL media is delivered over MBS session
to MCPTT client 2 to MCPTT client N.
Figure 6.21.2.2.2-1: Group call disconnect from MBS session
1\. MCPTT server has determined to disconnect the call over the MBS session
for the MCPTT clients
3\. An UnmapGroupFromMBSsession message is sent by the MCPTT server to MCPTT
client 1 to MCPTT client N on via MBS session.
NOTE 1: The UnmapGroupFromMBSsession message can be sent as part of other
messages.

## 6.22 Solution 22: Use of MBS transmission in MCVideo
### 6.22.1 Description
This solution is to address the key issue #13 on MC service data delivery over
broadcast MBS session for MCVideo specific aspect.
Both the media packets as well as the application layer signaling e.g., floor
control messages to the receiving users may be sent via the same MBS session
with different MBS QoS flows, or via different MBS sessions.
For broadcast MBS sessions, MCVideo may use pre-established broadcast MBS
session for the different types of MCPTT group calls. Both pre-arranged group
calls and chat group calls can use the pre-established broadcast MBS session
for distributing the DL data. The broadcast MBS session can be used by any
MCVideo group. Depending on the capacity of the MBMS bearer, the broadcast MBS
session can be used to broadcast one or more group calls in parallel. For
multicast MBS session, a multicast MBS session can be only used by one MCVideo
group at a time. The MCVideo service shall support the procedure for using
pre-established MBS sessions as described in clause 6.13 and 6.15 and the
MCVideo-1, MCVideo-6A, MCVideo‑8 and MCVideo-9 reference points as defined in
clause 6.8.
MCVideo may use dynamic MBS session establishment for the different types of
MCVideo group calls. Both pre-arranged group calls and chat group calls can
use the dynamic MBS session for distributing the DL data. The MCVideo service
shall support the procedure for using dynamic MBS sessions as as described in
clause 6.12 and 6.14 and the MCVideo-1, MCVideo-6A, MCVideo‑8 and MCVideo-9
reference points as defined in clause 6.8.
When using the procedures for pre-established or dynamic MBS session
establishment for MCVideo, the MCVideo server perform the procedure of call
connect and disconnect over MBS session as defined in clause 6.22.2 at the
group communication session establishment step.
### 6.22.2 Call connect and disconnect over MBS session procedures
#### 6.22.2.1 General
MBS session can be used for MCVideo group calls. One MBS session may be not
permanently associated to one specific group or group call. Before sending
media packets of a group call over MBS session, the MCVideo server shall send
the association information between group call and the MBS session. The group
call setup procedure indicates the media stream within one MBS session that is
used for the specific group call. When the group call over the MBS session is
finished, this temporary association information of an MCVideo group call to
specific resources on a MBS session is undone. The procedure in figure
6.22.2.1-1 requires that the group session is setup before the media
transmission start. This eliminates the need for the receiving clients to
continuously use a unicast bearer. Prior to this the MBS session is activated
and announced to the MCVideo clients.
#### 6.22.2.2 Procedure
##### 6.22.2.2.1 Group call connect over MBS session
In figure 6.22.2.2.1-1 the MCVideo client 1 is the client that initiate an
MCVideo chat group call and also the transmitting client. MCVideo client 1
may, but does not have to be in a broadcast service area if the MBS session is
broadcast MBS session. The MCVideo client 2 to MCVideo client N represents
MCVideo clients receiving the MCVideo call over an MBS session. There may be
other receiving clients over unicast delivery or over this MBS session,
however they are not illustrated in this figure.
The same procedure as for chat group call can also be applied for pre-arranged
calls. However that requires that the pre-arranged sessions are already
active. If a pre-arranged group session is initiated the use of pre-
established sessions are required.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MBS session is already established and announced to the participating
users. For multicast MBS session, the the participating users have
successfully joined the call and notify the MCVideo server. For the broadcast
MBS session, the participating users have notified the listening status to the
MCVideo server.
\- All users participating in the MCVideo group call are already affiliated to
the group.
\- All participating users have joined the group session.

1\. MCVideo client 1 initiate the MCVideo group call by sending an initial
transmit media request over a PDU session to the MCVideo server (reference
point MCVideo-4).
2\. The MCVideo server will send a MapGroupToMBSsession message over a
previously activated MBS session to all users that will receive the call via
the MBS delivery. The MapGroupToMBSsession message includes association
information between the group call and MBS session. The MapGroupToMBSsession
message includes MCVideo group ID and information about the media stream
identifier of the established MBS session and may include the MBS session
identifier (e.g., the TMGI) of the MBS session for the DL media. The message
is sent over reference point MCVideo-9.
If the acknowledgement indication is included in the MapGroupToMBSsession, the
MCPTT client(s) may send the acknowledgement message to the MCPTT server.
NOTE 1: Step 2 can be deferred until step 4 and the MapGroupToMBSsession
message can then be included in the floor taken message.
3\. The MCVideo server grants the right to transmit for MCVideo client 1 and
by that sends a transmit media granted message to the MCVideo client 1\. This
message is sent over a unicast bearer (reference point MCVideo-4).
4\. A media transmission notification message is sent from the MCVideo server
to all receiving users. This message includes the MCVideo ID of the
transmitting MCVideo client as well as the MCVideo group ID. The message is
sent over the MBS session. The message is sent over reference point MCVideo-9.
5\. The users of MCVideo clients are informed about the details of video
transmission and the video transmitter.
6\. The MCVideo clients may send a receive media request to the MCVideo
server, to indicate the reception of media over the MBMS bearer.
7\. MCVideo server accepts the media receive request and sends a receive media
response message to MCVideo clients over a MBMS bearer by using reference
point MCVideo-9.
NOTE 2: The receive media response can also be sent by unicast to the MCVideo
clients that request to receive media over the MBMS bearer.
NOTE 3: Step 7 and 8 may be omitted when auto-receive transmission mode is
used, e.g. for emergency group calls.
8\. The media is sent from MCVideo client 1 to the MCVideo server over unicast
bearer and from the MCVideo server to the MCVideo client 2 and MCVideo client
3 over the MBS session.
NOTE 4: Additional floor request messages in the same call will not trigger
the MapGroupToMBSsession message to be sent.

### 6.23.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #13 and focuses on the UE leaving a certain
multicast MBS session. The MC service server can request one or several MC
service clients to leave the multicast MBS session by indicating its MBS
session ID. This can be triggered for example once no further MC media is
needed to be delivered to the targeted MC service group, the multicast MBS
session is no longer associated to the MC group, or a certain MC service
client is no longer authorized to receive data to the associated MC service
group. The provided solution is applicable only for multicast MBS sessions.
The UE session leave aspects are described in 3GPP TS23.247 [19].
Editor\'s note: The feasibility of re-assigning multicast MBS session to
different groups is FFS, and depends on SA2\'s supporting of authorization,
multicast MBS session update due to authorization update.
#### 6.23.1.1 Procedure
The procedure in figure 6.23.1.1-1 describes how MC service client(s) leaves a
certain multicast MBS session.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and
affiliated to the same active MC service group.
\- An MBS session is configured to address the corresponding MC service group
with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain multicast
service area. The session is announced and established for group communication
purposes for the MC service group.
\- MC service clients 1 to n have successfully joined the multicast MBS
session.
Figure 6.23.1.1-1: UE multicast MBS session leave
1\. The MC service server decides that one or several MC service clients
receives should leave a certain multicast MBS session. This can be triggered
for example once no further MC media is needed to be delivered to the targeted
MC service group, the multicast MBS session is no longer associated to the MC
group, or a certain MC service client is no longer authorized to receive data
to the associated MC service group.
2\. The MC service server sends an MBS session leave request towards the MC
service client(s) indicating the multicast MBS session ID.
Editor\'s note: Whether the MBS session leave request can be de-announcement /
UnMapGroupToMBSSession /de-affiliation is FFS.
3\. The MC service client(s) initiates an MBS session leave procedure to leave
the indicated MBS session in order to release the respective network
resources, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
4\. The MC service client(s) provides a response to the MC service server
indicating that they have left the corresponding multicast MBS session.
### 6.23.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MC service server and the MC service clients are required to support the
different functionalities related to the 5G MBS session, in order to support
the MC service group communications over 5G MBS sessions.
### 6.23.3 Solution evaluation
The provided soltuion addresses the UE MBS session leave aspects related to
group communication services over 5G MBS multicast sessions. The provided
solution is applicable only for multicast MBS sessions and relies on the 5G
MBS session specifications and functionalites specified in 3GPP TS 23.247
[19].
## 6.24 Solution 24: 5G MBS session release aspects
### 6.24.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #13 and focuses on the MBS session release
once no further MC media is needed to be delivered for an active MC service
group. The provided solution is applicable to both multicast and broadcast MBS
sessions.
The MC service server can decide to release a certain MBS session once it is
no longer further utilized for the associated MC service group communication,
e.g., the MC service group is no longer active, the MC media transmission is
over and no further MC data to be delivered. The MBS session release procedure
leads to releasing the network resources associated to that MBS session.
To release the MBS session, the MC service server sends an MBS session stop
request to the 5GC providing the corresponding MBS session ID. The MBS session
release request is sent to the MB-SMF (directly or via NEF/MBSF) when PCC is
not used, or towards the PCF when PCC is used. Further details are provided in
3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. Furthermore, the MC service server may remove all the
configuration related to the released MBS session (most likely to broadcast
MBS sessions) by triggering a TMGI-deallocation procedure towards the 5GC, as
described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
#### 6.24.1.1 Procedure
The procedure in figure 6.24.1.1-1 describes the MBS session release aspects
for group communication.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and
affiliated to the same active MC service group.
\- An MBS session is configured to address the corresponding MC service group
with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain
broadcast/multicast service area. The session is announced and established for
group communication purposes for the MC service group.
Figure 6.24.1.1-1: MBS session release for MC group communication.
1\. The MC service server may send an UnMapGroupFromSessionStream to the MC
service clients to disconnect the group call from the MBS session.
2\. The MC service server decides to release the MBS session (either multicast
or broadcast MBS sessions) for the associated MC group communication.
3\. The MC service server sends an MBS session release request towards the 5GC
(either directly or through NEF/MBSF) in order to release the configured MBS
session as discussed in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
4\. In case of active multicast MBS session, the 5GC triggers multicast MBS
session deactivation procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
5\. The 5GC removes the joined MC service UEs from the session to be released.
6\. The MC service server may trigger a TMGI de-allocation procedure towards
the 5GC to de-configure the indicated MBS session.
### 6.24.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MC service server and the MC service clients are required to support the
different functionalities related to the 5G MBS session, in order to support
the MC service group communications over 5G MBS sessions.
### 6.24.3 Solution evaluation
The provided soltuion addresses the MBS session release aspects related to
group communication services over 5G MBS sessions. The provided solution,
which is applicable for both multicast and broadcast MBS sessions, relies on
5G MBS session specifications and functionalites specified in 3GPP TS 23.247
[19].
## 6.25 Solution 25: 5G MBS session update for group communication
### 6.25.1 Description
This solution addresses key #13 and focuses on the requirements and aspects of
an MBS session update for MC service group communications. The solution is
applicable for both broadcast and multicast sessions.
The MC service server can configure one or several MBS sessions based on
certain service requirements, (e.g., QoS profile), a certain service area, or
associated for a certain active group with affiliated MC service clients.
However, during the life cycle of these MBS sessions, the MC service server
may need to update the MBS sessions to meet other emerging needs, e.g. service
requirements, or service area. For this purpose, the MC service server
provides information, among others, e.g., MBS session ID and service
requirements along with the MBS session update request towards the 5GS. This
update can be either done via an MBS session update without PCC to the MB-SMF
(directly or via NEF/MBSF), or an MBS session configuration update with PCC to
the PCF, as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. Furthermore, the MC service
server is able to change the state (active or inactive) of a multicast MBS
session via the update request.
#### 6.25.1.1 Procedure
The procedure in figure 6.25.1.1-1 describes the MBS session update procedure
for MC group communication. The described procedure is applicable for both
broadcast and multicast sessions.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and
affiliated to the same active MC service group.
\- The MBS session is configured with certain service requirements and
optionally with a certain broadcast/multicast service area. The session is
announced to be associated with the MC service group for group communication
purposes.
\- The MC service server has obtained the required information related to the
MB-SMF, either locally configured or during initial session configuration.
Figure 6.25.1.1-1: 5G MBS session update for MC group communication.
1\. An MBS session is established (either a multicast or a broadcast session)
and associated with a certain active MC group for group communication
purposes. In the case of a multicast MBS session, the MC service clients have
joined the session.
2\. The MC service server invokes an MBS session update request towards the
5GC once the need has emerged to modify the current service requirements
(e.g., required QoS) and/or the service area of the ongoing MBS session, or
further media and session related information. Along with the update request
and the MBS session ID to be updated, the MC service server provides the
required updates, e.g., service area and/or required QoS. The modification can
either be done via an MBS session update without PCC to the MB-SMF (directly
or via NEF/MBSF), or an MBS session configuration update with PCC to the PCF,
as described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC
service server may as well update the status (active or inactive) of the
multicast MBS session once needed.
NOTE 1: the updated service area information is required for local MBS and for
broadcast MBS services.
3\. Based on the needed requirements, the corresponding MBS session is
accordingly modified. The service requirements update may lead to a QoS
Flow(s) addition, modification, or removal, as described in 3GPP TS 23.247
[19].
4\. The MC service server receives an MBS session update response once the
requested modifications are performed, and the indicated MBS session is
updated accordingly.
5\. The MC service server may initiate a service announcement towards the MC
service clients associated with the ongoing session in order to announce the
updated information if required, e.g., the updated service area or SDP
information.
NOTE 2: the updated service area information is required for local MBS and for
broadcast MBS services.
6\. The MC service server sends an MapGroupToSessionStream as defined in
clause 6.11 over the configured MBS session providing the required information
to receive the media related to the established MC service group
communication.
7\. The MC service clients process the received information over the
MapGroupToSessionStream in order to receive the associated MC media over the
specific MBS session stream.
8\. MC service client 1 sends media to the MC service server over unicast to
be distributed for the established group communication.
9\. The MC service server distributes the MC media to the MC services clients
2 to n over the indicated streams.
### 6.25.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MC service server and the MC service clients are required to support the
different functionalities related to the 5G MBS session in order to support
the MC service group communications over 5G MBS sessions.
### 6.25.3 Solution evaluation
The provided soltuion addresses the MBS session release aspects related to
group communication services over 5G MBS sessions. The provided solution,
which is applicable for both multicast and broadcast MBS sessions, relies on
5G MBS session specifications and functionalites specified in 3GPP TS 23.247
[19].
## 6.26 Solution 26: MC service support over 5G ProSe
### 6.26.1 Description
This solution is to address the key issue #14 how the 5G ProSe supports MC
services.
The general description of MC service over 4G ProSe for MCPTT, MCVideo and
MCData are specified in TS 23.280, and the procedures of off-network group
call, private call in off-network and MC service using UE-to-Network Relay are
captured in TS 23.379, 23.281 and 23.282 respectively.
The following table provides evolution conditions in 5G ProSe on the features
matching the SA1 MC service requirements on off network communications.

In SA6, the off network procedures are designed with the network and
application layer being decoupled. Based on the above analysis, this solution
proposes to reuse the application layer procedures over 4G ProSe with proper
changes to support MC service over 5G ProSe specified in TS 23.304.
The application layer identities, procedures, information flows used in TS
23.280, TS 23.379, TS 23.281, and TS 23.282 are reused for MC service over 5G
ProSe with following differences:
(1) Off network group communication
\- The ProSe Layer-2 Group ID of the target MC service group may be used by
the ProSe layer as the target group info;
\- Group Member Discovery procedure in 3GPP TS 23.304 [X] is utilized to
enable for the call initiator to determine whether other members of the target
MC service group are in the proximity of the calling user prior to the
establishment of an off-network group communication.
\- The Groupcast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication procedure in 3GPP TS
23.304 [X] is utilized for the establishment of off-network group
communication and the following media plane traffic exchanges.
(2) Off network private communication
\- The MC service group ID and the user info ID of the target MC service user
are provisioned to the MC service client in the MC service user profile as
table 1, 2 and 3. Further the MC service client enables the ProSe layer to
determine the IP address for the communication with the target MCPTT UE by
providing the MC service group ID and user info ID of the target MCPTT user.
\- Group Member Discovery procedure in 3GPP TS 23.304 [X] is utilized to
enable for the call initiator to determine whether the called MC service user
are in the proximity of the calling user prior to the establishment of an off-
network private communication.
\- The Unicast mode 5G ProSe Direct Communication procedure in 3GPP TS 23.304
[X] is utilized for the establishment of off-network private communication and
the following media plane traffic exchanges.

(3) UE to Network Relay service
\- In addition to the Layer 3 IP routing service, the 5G ProSe UE-to-Network
relay also provides forwarding functionality that can relay any type of
traffic over the PC5 link. The Relay Service Code (RSC) is used in the UE-to-
Network Relay discovery, to indicate the connectivity service the UE-to-
Network Relay provides to the Remote UE. The RSCs are configured on the UE-to-
Network Relay and the Remote UE. The RSC can also indicate if the UE-to-
Network Relay is a Layer-3 or Layer-2 UE-to-Network Relay.
\- The application layer may determine to use Layer-2 or Layer-3 UE-to-Network
Relay for the MC services via provisioning the Relay Service Code(s).
NOTE: The decision to use Layer-2 or Layer-3 UE-to-Network Relay is
implementation.
(4) Priority and communication type
\- The PPPP (ProSe Per-Packet priority) is replaced by PC5 5QI (PQI).
### 6.26.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
MC service client need to support the handling of the MC service over 5G
ProSe.
### 6.26.3 Solution evaluation
This solution reuses the functionality and information flow defined in 4G to
support the MC service over 5G ProSe.
## 6.27 Solution 27: Use of predefined 5QIs
### 6.27.1 Description
Key issue 15 addresses the use of other predefined 5QIs than 5QI 70 in
accordance to 3GPP TS 23.501 [10]. In general, predefined QoS classes are
considered as a kind of harmonization. Its use also enables harmonized use in
different domains, e.g. when roaming, and are accordingly available globally,
which is a decisive aspect for the interoperability of deployments.
Predefined OoS classes do not require negotiation between UE and Non-Access
Stratum (NAS) or between NAS and the corresponding access. This results in a
time advantage when setting up an MC communication compared to the use of non-
predefined QoS classes (negotiation required).
According to those aspects, the use of predefined QoS classes is more in the
foreground. For this purpose, it is proposed to extend the number of
predefined 5QIs proposed for use for MCData service capabilities. ¨
Editor\'s Note: The extension of predefined 5QIs for the use by MCVideo are
FFS.
### 6.27.2 Solution to extend MCData 5QI use71
In order to provide more flexibility in the use of QoS classes (5QI) for
MCData service capabilities, it is proposed:
  * For discrete automation purposes to extend the range of QoS classes on the more stringend bound applicable using the guaranteed bit rate assurance with 5QI 82, 83 and 84.
\- For relaxed delay requirements, 5QI 10 is proposed to be added from the
predefined QoS class range in the context of latency.
Figure 6.27.2-1 5G system 5QIs for MCData service capabilities
### 6.27.3 Solution evaluation
The proposed solution considers the available predefined 5QIs for the use by
MCData capability. Those cannot be assigned exclusively by the network as it
is defined for the dedicated predefined MC service 5QI classes, e.g. 5QI 70.
If necessary, the use of 5QI 10, 82, 83, 84 by MC services requires an update
of Table 5.7.4-1 in 3GPP TS 23.501 [10] by adding a Note, e.g. such 5QIs
utilized by MC services can only be assigned upon request from the network
side.
## 6.28 Solution 28: MBS service de-announcement
### 6.28.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #13 and focuses on that the MBS session is
no longer used and the MC service client is informed with the MBS session de-
announcement, so that the MC client UE stops monitoring the broadcast MBS
session or leave the multicast MBS session.
This procedure is applied for both broadcast MBS session and multicast MBS
session.
#### 6.28.1.1 Procedure
The procedure in figure 6.28.1.1-1 describes the signalling and information
flows for the MBS service de-announcement.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and
affiliated to the same active MC service group.
\- An MBS session is configured to address the corresponding MC service group
with certain service requirements and optionally with a certain service area.
The MBS session is announced and established for group communication purposes
for the MC service group.
Figure 6.28.1.1-1: MBS service de-announcement
1 The MC service server removes the MBS session configuration as described in
TS 23.247 [19]. This can be triggered for example when no further MC media is
needed to be delivered to the targeted MC service group.
NOTE: Alternatively, the MC service server can first send de-announcement of
the MBS session to the MC service clients, and then perform step 1 after step
4.
2 The MC service server decides to de-announce an MBS session.
3 The MC service server sends an MBS service de-announcement message with the
MBS session ID towards the MC service client(s).
Upon receiving the MBS service de-announcement message, either 4a or 4b is
performed.
4a. If the MBS session identified by MBS session ID is broadcast MBS session,
the MC service client(s) stops monitoring the broadcast MBS session and
removes the broadcast MBS session related information.
4b. If the MBS session identified by MBS session ID is multicast MBS session,
the joined MC service client(s) initiates an MBS session leave procedure to
leave the indicated MBS session in order to release the respective network
resources, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
### 6.28.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MC service server and the MC service clients are required to support the
de-announcement related processing.
### 6.28.3 Solution evaluation
The provided soltuion addresses the MBS service de-announcement for MBS
session. The provided solution enables the MC service client to stop
monitoring the broadcast MBS session or leave the multicast MBS session to
save power, and also promote the efficient usage of network resources.
## 6.29 Solution 29: Use of broadcast and multicast MBS sessions in MCPTT
### 6.29.1 Description
This solution addresses the key issue #13 on MC service data delivery over
broadcast and multicast MBS session for group communication, in specific
MCPTT. This solution describes MCPTT group call connect and disconnect via MBS
sessions. This solution is applicable for both broadcast and multicast MBS
sessions. In the multicast MBS sessions, in order to the MCPTT UE to receive
the corresponding MC data, it needs to initiate a UE session join towards the
5GS indicating the request to join a specific multicast MBS session, which it
is aware of via the service announcement, as described in described in
solution 6.10.
After the MC media transmission is over, if the MCPTT server decides to stop
the corresponding MBS session, it sends an MBS session stop request towards
the 5GS, where the latter removes the joined MCPTT UEs from the corresponding
MBS session in case of multicast sessions.
The application layer signalling, such as the floor control messages, may be
transmitted along with the MC data over the same MBS session however with
different QoS requirements, or via other means such as unicast downlink or a
different MBS session.
### 6.29.2 Call connect over MBS session
The MCPTT server provides the MCPTT clients with the necessary information to
map a specific group call with the stream to be utilized within the announced
and established broadcast or multicast MBS session. Such information can be
provided via the MapGroupToSessionStream message.
Table 6.29.2-1 defines the MapGroupToSessionStream to be sent from the MCPTT
server to MCPTT clients to provide specific required information to receive
the data related to a group communication within an MBS session.
Table 6.29.2-1: MapGroupToSessionStream
Information element Status Description
* * *
MCPTT group ID M This element identifies the MCPTT group related to a group
communication to be delivered over the MBS session Media stream identifier M
This element identifies the media stream of the SDP used for the group
communication within the MBS session MBS session ID O Indicating the MBS
session ID, if the MapGroupToSessionStream is not sent over the same MBS
session
#### 6.29.2.1 Call connect over MBS session procedure
Figure 6.29.2.1-1 presents the procedure for a group communication call
connect over either broadcast or multicast MBS sessions.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCPTT clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated
to the same MCPTT group X.
\- The MCPTT server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF
discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally
configured.
\- The MCPTT server has decided to use an MBS session for the MCPTT service
group call associated with to the MCPTT group X.
\- The MCPTT clients 2 to n are within the MBS service area (if the session is
limited to an area) where the MBS session is configured.
Figure 6.29.2.1-1: Group call connect over broadcast and multicast MBS
sessions.
1 An MBS session is configured with the required QoS requirements announced
and established.
NOTE: In case of broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established as part of
session configuration procedures as described in TS 23.247 [19]. In case of
multicast MBS sessions, the session is established in step 2.
2 In the case of multicast MBS sessions, the MCPTT UE initiates a UE session
join towards the 5GS based on the session information provided to the MCPTT UE
during the service announcement step. This step is essential in order to
receive the corresponding MC data. The multicast MBS session is hence
established once the first initiated UE session join is accepted as indicated
in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
3 MCPTT client 1 initiates a group call by sending an initial floor request
over a unicast PDU session towards the MCPTT server.
4 The MCPTT server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream including the necessary
stream information for the MCPTT clients 2 to n to receive the MC media
related to the group call which is taken place within the associated MBS
session.
5 The MCPTT clients 2 to n process the MapGroupToSessionStream information and
may send a MapGroupToSessionStream Ack back to the MCPTT server if required.
6 The MCPTT server grants MCPTT client 1 the right to transmit media over the
associated MBS session and sends a floor granted message to client 1 over a
unicast PDU session.
7 A floor taken message is sent from the MCPTT server clients 2 to n
indicating the MCPTT ID of the transmitting client, i.e., MCPTT client 1 and
the associated MCPTT group ID. The floor taken message is transmitted over the
associated MBS session.
8 MCPTT client 1 sends the MC media over uplink unicast PDU session towards
the MCPTT server.
9 The MCPTT server sends the MC media over the indicated stream within the
associated MBS session to the MCPTT clients 2 to n.
### 6.29.3 Call disconnect over MBS session
The MCPTT server informs the MCPTT clients that the group call is being
disconnected from the specified broadcast or multicast MBS session once the MC
media transmission is over. For this purpose, the MCPTT server sends an
UnMapGroupFromSessionStream to indicate the stream information, which is no
longer available for the group communication.
Table 6.29.3-1 defines the UnMapGroupFromSessionStream to be sent from the
MCPTT server to MCPTT clients to indicate the dissociation of the group call
from the corresponding MBS session stream.
The MCPTT server may initiate an MBS session stop towards the 5GS, where the
latter removes the MCPTT clients to reserve the network resources in the 5GC
and NG-RAN.
Table 6.29.3-1: UnMapGroupFromSessionStream
Information element Status Description

session ID, if the information is sent over another MBS session or unicast
path
#### 6.29.3.1 Call disconnect over MBS session procedure
Figure 6.29.3.1-1 presents the procedure for a group communication call
disconnect over broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.
Figure 6.29.3.1-1: Group call disconnect over broadcast and multicast MBS
sessions.
1 The MC group communication is taking place over the associated MBS session.
MCPTT client 1 is sending the MC media over a unicast PDU session to the MCPTT
server.
2 The MCPTT sends the MC media over the associated MBS session to MCPTT
clients 2 to n.
3 After the MC media transmission is over, i.e., no further media to be sent
over the group communication, the MCPTT server sends an
UnMapGroupFromSessionStream to de-associate the group call from the MBS
session.
4 The MCPTT server may decide to stop the MBS session by sending an MBS
session stop request towards the 5GS indicating the MBS session ID to be
stopped.
NOTE: In case of multicast MBS sessions, the 5GS removes the MCPTT UEs 2 to n
from the multicast MBS session as a response to the session stop request.
Hence, the resources in both NG-RAN and 5GC are released.
### 6.29.4 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MCPTT server and the MCPTT clients are required to support the different
functionalities related to the 5G MBS session, in order to support the MCPTT
group communications over 5G MBS sessions.
### 6.29.5 Solution evaluation
The provided soltuion addresses the call connect and disconnect aspects
related to MCPTT service group communications, where the latter is to take
place over 5G MBS sessions. The provided solution, which is applicable for
both multicast and broadcast MBS sessions, relies on 5G MBS session
specifications and functionalites specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
## 6.30 Solution 30: Use of broadcast and multicast MBS sessions in MCVideo
### 6.30.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue #13 on MC service data delivery over
broadcast and multicast MBS sessions for group communication, in specific
MCVideo. This solution describes the MCVideo video call connect and disconnect
via MBS sessions, which is applicable for both broadcast and multicast MBS
sessions. Furthermore, this solution is also applicable for video chat group.
In the multicast MBS sessions, in order to the MCVideo UE to receive the
corresponding MC data, it has to initiate a UE session join towards the 5GS to
join multicast MBS session, which it is aware of via the service announcement
step described in solution 6.10.
After the MC media transmission is over, if the MCVideo server decides to stop
the corresponding MBS session, it sends an MBS session stop request towards
the 5GS, where the latter removes the joined MCVideo UEs from the
corresponding MBS session in case of multicast sessions.
The application layer signalling such as the transmit media request and
transmit media granted messages, may be transmitted along with the MC media
over the same MBS session however with different QoS requirements, or over
other means such as unicast downlink or a different MBS session.
### 6.30.2 Video call connect over MBS session
The MCVideo server provides the clients with necessary information for a
specific group video call, among others the session stream to be utilized
within the broadcast or multicast MBS session. Such information are provided
via the MapGroupToSessionStream message.
Table 6.30.2-1 defines the MapGroupToSessionStream to be sent from the MCVideo
server to MCVideo clients to provide specific required information to receive
the data related to a group communication within an MBS session.

not sent over the same MBS session
#### 6.30.2.1 Video call connect over MBS session procedure
Figure 6.30.2.1-1 presents the procedure for a group communication, in
specific, video call connect over either broadcast or multicast MBS sessions.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCVideo clients 1 to n are attached to the 5GS, registered and
affiliated to the same MCVideo group X.
\- The MCVideo server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF
discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally
configured.
\- The MCVideo server has decided to use an MBS session for the MCVideo
services associated to the MCVideo group X.
\- The MCVideo clients 2 to n are within the MBS service area (if the session
is limited to an area) where the MBS session is configured.
Figure 6.30.2.1-1: Group call connect via broadcast and multicast MBS
sessions.
1 An MBS session is configured with the required QoS requirements, announced
and established.
NOTE: In case of broadcast MBS sessions, the session is established as part of
session configuration procedures as described in TS 23.247 [19]. In case of
multicast MBS sessions, the session is established in step 2.
2 In the case of multicast MBS sessions, the MCVideo UEs initiate a UE session
join towards the 5GC based on the session information provided to the MCVideo
UE during the service announcement step. This step is essential in order to
receive the corresponding MC data. The multicast MBS session is hence
established once the request of the first initiated UE session join is
accepted as indicated in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
3 MCVideo client 1 initiates a MCVideo group communication, namely a video
group call, by sending an initial transmit media request over a unicast PDU
session towards the MCVideo server.
4 The MCVideo server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream including the necessary
stream information for the MCVideo clients 2 to n to receive the MC media
related to the group call which is taken place within the associated MBS
session.
5 The MCVideo clients 2 to n process the MapGroupToSessionStream information
and may send a MapGroupToSessionStream Ack back to the MCVideo server if
required.
6 The MCVideo server grants MCVideo client 1 the right to transmit media over
the associated MBS session and sends a transmit media grated message to client
1 over a unicast PDU session.
7 A media transmission notification message is sent from the MCVideo server to
the MC clients 2 to n over the associated MBS session. It indicates the
MCVideo ID of the transmitting client, i.e., MCVideo ID of service client 1
and the associated MC group ID.
8 MCVideo clients 2 to n process the notification message and get informed
about the necessary information of the video group call.
9 The MCVideo clients 2 to n may send a receive media request to the MCVideo
server, to indicate the reception of media over the associated MBS session. As
a result, the MCVideo server sends a corresponding response message.
10 MCVideo client 1 sends the MC media over a unicast PDU session towards the
MCVideo server.
11 The MCVideo server sends the MC media over the indicated stream within the
associated MBS session to the MCVideo clients 2 to n.
### 6.30.3 Video call disconnect over MBS session
The MCVideo server informs the MCVideo clients that the group call is being
dissociated from the specified broadcast or multicast MBS session once the MC
media transmission is over. For this purpose, the MCVideo server sends an
MapGroupFromSessionStream to indicate the stream information, which is no
longer available to the MC group.Table 6.30.3-1 defines the
UnMapGroupFromSessionStream to be sent from the MCVideo server to MCVideo
clients to indicate the dissociation of the group call from the corresponding
MBS session stream.
The MCVideo server may initiate an MBS session stop towards the 5GS, where the
latter removes the MCVideo clients to reserve the network resources in the 5GC
and NG-RAN.

#### 6.30.3.1 Video call disconnect over MBS session procedure
Figure 6.30.3.1-1 presents the procedure for a group call disconnect over
broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.
Figure 6.30.3.1-1: Group call disconnect via broadcast and multicast MBS
sessions.
1 The MC group call is taking place over the associated MBS session. MCVideo
client 1 is sending the MC media over a unicast PDU session to the MCVideo
server.
2 The MCVideo delivers the MC media over the associated broadcast or multicast
MBS session to MCVideo clients 2 to n.
3 After the MC media transmission is over, i.e., no further media to be sent
over the group communication, the MCVideo server sends an
UnMapGroupFromSessionStream to MCVideo clients 2 to n to indicate the de-
association of the group call from the corresponding MBS session stream.
4 The MCVideo server may decide to stop the MBS session by sending an MBS
session stop request towards the 5GS indicating the MBS session ID to be
stopped.
NOTE: In case of multicast MBS sessions, the 5GS removes the MCVideo UEs 2 to
n from the multicast MBS session as a response to the session stop request.
Hence, the resources in both NG-RAN and 5GC are released.
### 6.30.4 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MC service server and the MC service clients are required to support the
different functionalities related to the 5G MBS session, in order to support
the MC service group communications over 5G MBS sessions.
### 6.30.5 Solution evaluation
The provided soltuion addresses thevideo call connect and disconnect aspects
related to MCVideo service group communications, where the latter is to take
place over 5G MBS sessions. The provided solution, which is applicable for
both multicast and broadcast MBS sessions, relies on 5G MBS session
specifications and functionalites specified in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
## 6.31 Solution 31: Multicast MBS session activation and deactivation aspects
for group communications
### 6.31.1 Description
This solution focuses on key issue 13 related to 5G MBS session features and
configuration options related to MC services.
During the life cycle of multicast MBS sessions -- which is fully described in
3GPP TS 23.247 [19], an established multicast MBS session can have an active
or inactive state based on the establishment or the release of radio resources
for the specific session, respectively. In other words, a multicast MBS
session with an active state indicates that the radio resources are
established as well as are activated for the joined MC service UEs and MC data
is to be delivered over the associated MBS session. Whereas an inactive state
indicates their inactivation since there is currently no MC data to be
transmitted. Nevertheless, an inactive multicast MBS session is established,
with the MC service UEs still in joined status.
The transition between the two states is essential to manage the NR-RAN
resources efficiently and can be done via the MBS session activation and
deactivation procedures, which are only applicable for multicast MBS sessions.
The multicast MBS session activation procedure is either triggered by the 5GC
once the MB-UPF receives MC data to be transmitted hence notifies the MB-SMF,
or by the MC service server by sending an activation request towards the 5GC
(either directly to the MB-SMF or via NEF) indicating the TMGI to be
activated. Similarly, the multicast MBS session deactivation procedure is
triggered by the 5GC once no further MC data is at the MB-UPF to be sent to
the MC service UEs, or by the MC service server upon sending a deactivation
request towards the MC service server towards the 5GC (either directly to the
MB-SMF or via NEF) indicating TMGI to be deactivated. However, the introduced
solution focuses on the MBS session activation and deactivation procedures
being triggered by the MC service server.
#### 6.31.1.1 Multicast MBS session activation procedure
The procedure in figure 6.31.1.1-1 describes how the MC service server
triggers an MBS session activation procedure in order to activate an inactive
multicast MBS session, in order to establish radio resources and starts
transmitting MC data to the MC service UEs.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to
the same MC service group X.
\- The MC service server has decided to use a multicast MBS session for MC
service group communications associated to MC service group X.
\- The MC service server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF
discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally
configured.
\- The MBS session is configured and announced to address MC group
communication related to the associated MC service group X with certain
service requirements and optionally with a certain service area.
Figure 6.31.1.1-1: Multicast MBS session activation procedure.
1\. The multicast MBS session is established as the first UE session join
request, which is initiated by MC service UE towards 5GC, is accepted. At this
stage, the multicast MBS session is established but in an inactive state.
2\. The MC service server decides MC data is needed to be transmitted over the
multicast MBS session to the MC group X, hence it decides to activate the
multicast MBS session.
3\. The MC service sends an MBS session activation request towards the 5GC, in
specific either directly to the MB-SMF or via NEF, indicating the TMGI to be
activated.
4\. The 5GC changes the session status to "active" and finds the list of
joined MC service UEs associated with the session and activate the NG- RAN
resources for MC data delivery as detailed in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
5\. The 5GC may send an MBS session activation response to the MC service
server indicating that the requested multicast MBS session has been activated.
#### 6.31.1.2 Multicast MBS session deactivation procedure
The procedure in figure 6.31.1.2-1 describes how the MC service server
triggers an MBS session deactivation procedure in order to deactivate an
active established multicast MBS session, in order to release radio resources
once no further MC data is to be delivered.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to
the same MC service group X.
\- The MC service server has directly performed (or via NEF/MBSF) an MB-SMF
discovery and selection, unless the corresponding information is locally
configured.
\- A multicast MBS session is configured and announced to address the
corresponding MC service group with certain service requirements and
optionally with a certain multicast service area.
\- The MC service clients have already joined the multicast MBS session and
are able to receive the MC data over the associated MBS session.
Figure 6.31.1.2-1: Multicast MBS session deactivation procedure.
1\. The group communication associated with MC service group X takes place,
and the corresponding MC data is delivered over the associated multicast MBS
session. The MBS session has an active state.
2\. The MC service server decides to deactivate the multicast MBS session, as
no further MC data to be delivered to the MC service group X.
3\. The MC service server sends an MBS session deactivation request towards
the 5GC, in specific either directly to the MB-SMF or via NEF, indicating the
TMGI to be deactivated.
4\. The 5GC changes the session state to "inactive" and deactivate the radio
resources associated with the joined MC service UEs as described in 3GPP TS
23.247 [19].
5\. The 5GC may send an MBS deactivation response to the server indicating
that the requested multicast MBS session has been inactivated.
### 6.31.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MC service server and MC service clients are required to support the
different 5G MBS service functionalities in order to enable the support of MC
service group communications over MBS sessions.
### 6.31.3 Solution evaluation
This solution is proposed to address MBS session activation and deactivation
aspects for the support of MC service group communications over MBS sessions,
in specific multicast MBS sessions. It addresses the ability of the MC service
server to control the status of an established multicast 5G MBS session, hence
the reservation of radio resources for the corresponding multicast MBS
session.
## 6.32 Solution 32: Inter-system mobility between LTE and 5G
### 6.32.1 Description
This solution addresses key issue 13 related to the support of service
continuity when the same MC service is provided via both LTE and 5G
technologies. The solution focuses on inter-system mobility with interworking
being supported at the service layer as concluded in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19],
where the MC service server guides the MC service clients throughout the MC
data transmission switch between the LTE and 5G systems. For this purpose, the
location management client sends location related information to the location
management server, similar to the one defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [2], which is
triggered due to its location change -- in this case due to Radio Access
Technology (RAT) change, to inform the server hence the latter provides
guidance related to how to receive the MC services after the location update.
This solution covers both the deployment scenarios with/without MBSF/MBSTF.
The solution discusses four inter-system mobility related scenarios as
follows:
1\. Inter-system mobility from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS bearer, as in
6.32.1.1
2\. Inter-system mobility from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast bearer, as in
6.32.1.2
3\. Inter-system mobility from LTE eMBMS to 5G MBS session, as in 6.32.1.3
4\. Inter-system mobility from LTE eMBMS to 5G unicast PDU session, as in
6.32.1.4
In all the inter-system mobility related scenario described in 6.32.1.1,
6.32.1.2, 6.32.1.3 and 6.32.1.4, the function entity resides in 5GS may be NEF
(N33), or MBSF (Nmb10)/MBSTF (Nmb8), or MB-SMF (Nmb13)/PCF (N5).
NOTE: It is implementation specific, that the MC service server can decide
whether to trigger the establishment of eMBMS bearer (or the creation of MBS
session) or unicast bearer (or unicast PDU session) to serve the MC service UE
due to the mobility.
#### 6.32.1.1 Inter-system mobility from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS bearer
The procedure provided in figure 6.32.1.1-1 describes how the MC service
server maintains MC service continuity while the MC service UE switches from
5G to LTE network, where the MC service server is able to provide the MC
services to the clients over eMBMS bearer(s).
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to
the same MC service group X.
\- The MC services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.
\- The MC service client(s) is within the eMBMS service area.
\- It is assumed that the MC service client(s) has not received the eMBMS
service announcement while camping in 5GS.
Figure 6.32.1.1-1: Inter-system mobility from 5G MBS session to LTE eMBMS
bearer.
1\. An MC service group communication takes place, and the MC data is
delivered over 5G MBS session (either broadcast or multicast session mode),
which is associated to the MC service group X.
2\. The MC service UE performs handover to EPS.
3\. The MC service UE\'s location information is provided via the location
management client, triggered by RAT change, to the location management server,
where the latter provides the location information to the MC service server.
Editor\'s note: How MC Service server can determine inter system mobility
using location reports is FFS.
4\. The MC service server analyses the location information and decides how to
serve the client. If the MC service server decides to serve the client via
eMBMS bearer, it may send an eMBMS bearer announcement as described in 3GPP TS
23.280 [2]. This step is optional as the service announcement related
information could be sent in advance (implementation specific).
NOTE: Before the MC service UE handover to EPS, the eMBMS bearer may already
pre-established before the start of MC group communication, or established to
severing other affiliated MCX group member located in EPS coverage and with
eMBMS capability.
5\. If not already available, the MC service client stores the announced
TMGI(s), service area, and any relevant information to the eMBMS, which is
delivered via the bearer announcement. As a result, the MC service client
starts monitoring the bearer.
6\. The MC service client sends an eMBMS listening status report to inform the
server of its ability of receiving MC media over the specified bearer.
7\. The MC server sends the necessary information related to receiving the MC
media in the form of the MapGroupToBearer.
8\. The MC service group communication takes place over EPS, and the MC data
is transmitted over an eMBMS bearer.
#### 6.32.1.2 Inter-system mobility from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast bearer
The procedure provided in figure 6.32.1.2-1 describes how the MC service
server maintains MC service continuity while the MC service UE switches from
5G to LTE network, where the MC service server is unable to provide the MC
services to the client over eMBMS bearer.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to
the same MC service group X.
\- The MC services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.
Figure 6.32.1.2-1: Inter-system mobility from 5G MBS session to LTE unicast
bearer.
1\. An MC service group communication takes place, and the MC data is
delivered over 5G MBS session (either broadcast or multicast session mode),
which is associated to the MC service group X.
2\. The MC service UE performs handover to EPS.
3\. The MC service UE`s location information is provided via the location
management client, triggered by RAT change, to the location management server,
where the latter provides the location information to the MC service server.
Editor\'s note: How MC Service server can determine inter system mobility
using location reports is FFS.
4\. The MC service server may interact with the EPC for providing the required
media resources over the unicast bearer, if not already allocated.
5\. The MC service group communication takes place over EPS, and the MC data
is transmitted over a unicast bearer.
#### 6.32.1.3 Inter-system mobility from LTE eMBMS to 5G MBS session
The procedure provided in figure 6.32.1.3-1 describes how the MC service
server maintains MC service continuity while the MC service UE switches from
LTE network to 5G, where the MC service server is able to provide the MC
services to the client over 5G MBS sessions (either broadcast or multicast).
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the EPC and affiliated to the same MC
service group X.
\- The MC services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.
\- The MC service client(s) is within the service area (if the session is
limited to an area), where the MBS session is configured.
\- It is assumed that the MC service client(s) has not received the 5G MBS
service announcement while camping in EPS.
Figure 6.32.1.3-1: Inter-system mobility from LTE eMBMS bearer to 5G MBS
sessions (either broadcast or multicast).
1\. An MC service group communication takes place, and the MC data is
delivered over eMBMS bearer, which is associated to the MC service group X.
2\. The MC service UE performs handover to 5GS.
3\. The MC service UE`s location information is provided via the location
management client, triggered by RAT change, to the location management server,
where the latter provides the location information to the MC service server.
Editor\'s note: How MC Service server can determine inter system mobility
using location reports is FFS.
4\. The MC service server analyses the location information and decides how to
serve the client. If the MC service server decides to serve the client via 5G
MBS session, it may dynamically trigger the configuration of 5G MBS if 5G MBS
session is not available yet and send an MBS service announcement indicating
information among others the session mode to serve the MC service client and
the corresponding MBS session ID. This step is optional as the service
announcement related information could be sent in advance (implementation
specific).
NOTE: Before the MC service UE handover to 5G, the 5G MBS session may already
pre-configured before the start of MC group communication, or configured to
severing other affiliated MCX group member located in 5G coverage and with 5G
MBS capability.
5\. The MC service UE acts according to the MBS session mode provided to
receive the DL media.
5a. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the MC service UE performs a UE session
join towards the 5GC indicating the MBS session ID to join. It may as well
send a UE session join acknowledgement to the MC service server.
5b. In case of broadcast MBS sessions, the MC service UE starts monitoring the
broadcast MBS session.
6\. The MC service client sends an MBS listening status report to the server
indicating its ability to receive data over the indicated MBS session.
7\. The MC service server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream over the MBS session
providing the required stream information to receive the media related to the
group communication.
8\. The MC service client processes the received information related to the MC
data over the MBS session.
9\. The MC service group communication takes place over 5GS, and the MC data
is delivered over the broadcast or multicast MBS session.
#### 6.32.1.4 Inter-system mobility from LTE eMBMS to 5G unicast PDU session
The procedure provided in figure 6.32.1.4-1 describes how the MC service
server manages MC service continuity while the MC service UE switches from LTE
network to 5G, where the MC service server is able to provide the MC services
to the client over 5G MBS sessions (either broadcast or multicast).
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the EPC and affiliated to the same MC
service group X.
\- The MC services can be provided via both 5GS and EPS.
Figure 6.32.1.4-1: Inter-system mobility from LTE eMBMS bearer to 5G unicast
PDU session.
1\. An MC service group communication takes place, and the MC data is
delivered over eMBMS bearer, which is associated to the MC service group X.
2\. The MC service UE performs handover to 5GS.
3\. The MC service UE`s location information is provided via the location
management client, triggered by RAT change, to the location management server,
where the latter provides the location information to the MC service server.
Editor\'s note: How MC Service server can determine inter system mobility
using location reports is FFS.
4\. The MC service server may interact with the 5GC to request media resources
(if not already allocated) with specific requirements over unicast PDU
session, as it is able to serve the MC service client via unicast PDU session,
as described in 3GPP TS 23.289 [22].
5\. The MC service group communication takes place over 5GS, and the MC data
is delivered over unicast PDU session.
### 6.32.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The MC service server and MC service clients are required to support the
different 5G MBS service functionalities in order to enable the support of MC
service group communications over MBS sessions.
### 6.32.3 Solution evaluation
This solution addresses an essential aspect to ensure MC service continuity
between LTE eMBMS and 5G MBS. The solution provides the proper application
layer signalling that guides the MC service client throughout the mobility and
switch.
## 6.33 Solution 33: Service continuity for broadcast and multicast MBS
sessions
### 6.33.1 Description
The solution addresses key issue #13 related to service continuity when the MC
data delivery being switched between 5G MBS session and unicast PDU session.
The solution is applicable to both 5G MBS session modes: broadcast and
multicast MBS sessions, and emphasizes the importance of introducing the MBS
listening status report to both MBS session modes. The solution reflects on
possible service interrupt due to this switch, i.e., break- before-make.
Table 6.33.1-1 defines the information elements send via the MBS listening
status report, being send from the MC service client(s) to the MC service
server irrespective of the MBS session mode. The defined information elements
are similar to those defined in solution 19, with their validity to both
broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.

MBS session ID(s) M The identity of the MBS session(s) being reported. It can
either be an MBS session of broadcast or multicast mode MC service ID M
Identity of the MC service user who is sending the listening status report MBS
session listening status (s) M The broadcast listening status per MBS session
ID MBS session reception quality level O The reception quality level per MBS
session ID Unicast PDU session listening status O The unicast listening status
associated with the DL unicast PDU session NOTE: The set of quality levels
helps service continuity in broadcast and multicast scenarios. A reception
quality level may help to make an efficient switching decision to unicast
delivery. How these levels are used is implementation specific.
#### 6.33.1.1 Service continuity from broadcast and multicast MBS sessions to
unicast PDU session
The procedure shown in figure 6.33.1.1-1 describes how the MC service client
informs the MC service server its inability to receive MC data via MBS session
in the form of the MBS listening status report.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to
the same MC service group X.
\- The MC service server has decided to use an MBS session for MC service
group communications associated to MC service group X.
\- The MBS session is configured with certain QoS service requirements,
announced and established. In case of multicast MBS sessions, the session is
active.
Figure 6.33.1.1-1: Service continuity from broadcast and multicast MBS
sessions to unicast PDU session
1 A group communication takes place and the MC data along with any necessary
application layer signalling is transmitted to the MC service group X members
over the broadcast and multicast MBS session.
2 The MC service client(s) detects bad MBS session reception quality, this
could be due to moving out of service area.
3 As a result, the MC service client sends an MBS listening status report to
the MC service server indicating its MC service ID, MBS session ID(s) and the
corresponding reception quality received by the MC client, along with the
unicast PDU session. However, it is implementation specific how the reception
quality level can be determined per MBS session, per stream, or per QoS flow
stream.
4 The MC service server may interact with the 5GC for a dedicated QoS over the
unicast PDU session with QoS requirements that meet the service requirements.
5 The MC service server sends the MC data and any necessary application layer
signalling over the unicast PDU session.
NOTE: A possible service interruption may occur when switching from MBS
session to unicast PDU session due to break-before-make mechanism.
#### 6.33.1.2 Service continuity from unicast PDU session to broadcast and
multicast MBS session
The procedure shown in figure 6.33.1.2-1 describes how the MC service client
informs the MC service server its ability to receive MC data via MBS session
in the form of the MBS listening status report. The latter then facilitates
the reception of MC data over the MBS session, based on the session mode.
Pre-conditions:
\- MC service clients are attached to the 5GS, registered and affiliated to
the same MC service group X.
\- The MC service server has decided to use an MBS session for MC service
group communications associated to MC service group X.
\- The MBS session is configured with certain QoS service requirements,
announced and established.
\- The MC service client has already received the MBS service announcement
along with the necessary information to receive the MC data over the MBS
session once possible.
Figure 6.33.1.2-1: Service continuity from unicast PDU session to broadcast
and multicast MBS sessions
1\. A group communication takes place and the MC data along with any necessary
application layer signalling is transmitted to the MC service client a unicast
PDU session.
2\. The MC service client detects its ability to receive MC data over the
announced MBS session reception, this could be due to moving inside of the
service area.
3\. As a result, the MC service client sends an MBS listening status report to
the MC service server indicating its MC service ID, MBS session ID(s) and the
corresponding reception quality received by the MC client. However, it is
implementation specific how the reception quality level can be determined per
MBS session, per stream, or per QoS flow stream.
4\. Based on the MBS session mode, the MC service client takes the following
actions.
4a. In case of multicast MBS session, the MC service client performs a UE
session join towards the 5GC and sends a UE session join acknowledgement to
the MC service server.
4b. In case of broadcast MBS sessions, the MC service client starts to monitor
the broadcast MBS session.
5\. The MC service server sends a MapGroupToSessionStream to the MC service
client.
6\. The MC service server sends the MC data and any necessary application
layer signalling over the MBS session.
### 6.33.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
MC service server and MC service clients are required to support the different
5G MBS service functionalities in order to enable the support of MC service
group communication, including MC service continuity between broadcast and
multicast sessions and unicast sessions upon needed.
### 6.33.3 Solution evaluation
The proposed solution assures service continuity of MC group communications.
The solutions emphasize on the importance of MBS listening status report for
this matter, and for both MBS session modes.
## 6.34 Solution 34: Providing stored files in the MCData content server for
distribution over 5G MBS
### 6.34.1 Description
The file delivery capability are provided as one capabilities of MBSF /MBSTF.
The procedures and information flows for file distribution of MC Data group
are defined in 3GPP TS 23.282 [5].
When using 5G MBS, MCData server can determine to use either pre-created MBS
session or dynamic MBS session as defined in clause 7.3.3.1 for the
transmission file to MC Data group. When MBSF/MBSTF are deployed in 5GS,
MCData server could also determine to use File distribution capabilities
provided by MBSF/MBSTF for file distribution.
The solutions about usage of MBS session could be exactly the same as the
solutions of other MCX service type (could use the same conclusion in clause
8.2.3).
The solutions about usage of file distribution capability of MBSF/MBTSF is
described in this solution.
#### 6.34.1.1 Use of pre-created MBS user services
##### 6.34.1.1.1 General
In this scenario, the MCData server pre-creates MBS user service(s) in certain
pre-configured areas before the initiation of a group file distribution. When
a user originates a request for a file distribution in one of these areas, the
MCData server can use the pre-created MBS user service(s) for the DL media
transmission.
The MBS user service can be announced prior to the file distribution or within
the signalling message for the file distribution.
The MBS user service does not transmit application level control signalling.
##### 6.34.1.1.2 Procedure
The procedure figure 6.34.1.1.2-1 shows only one of the receiving MCData
clients using an MBS user service.
Pre-conditions:
\- The participating users are already affiliated.
Figure 6.34.1.1.2-1: Use of pre-created MBS user service
1\. The MCData server determines to create a MBS user service with a given an
MBS user service ID for the group communication session.
2\. The MCData server determines to use MBS user service provided by
MBSF/MBSTF for File distribution .It invokes the API over Nmb10/Nmb5 interface
for the related MBS user service.
NOTE 1: The procedure to determine the use of MBS user services is
implementation specific.
Editor\'s note: The APIs for MBS user services is FFS and up to SA4 definition
in TS 26.502.
3\. The MCData server passes using control plane signalling (Application
Service Announcement) the MBS user service information for the service
description associated with the pre-created MBS user service to the MCData
client. The MCData client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBS session,
included in the MBS user service description.
4\. The MCData client stores the information associated with the MBS user
service. The MCData client uses the TMGI and other MBS user service related
information to activate the monitoring of the MBS session. Or if the MBS
multicast session is used, MCData client should make a MBS session join to 5GS
as defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
5\. The MCData client that enters or is in the service area of at least one
announced TMGI indicates to the MCData server that the MCData client is able
to receive file distributed over MBS, whereby the MCData server may decide to
use this MBS user service instead of unicast session for MC communication
sessions.
NOTE 2: Step 3 is optional for the MCData UE on subsequent MBS user service
announcements.
6\. If the MCData server wants to deliver a file to a group, the MCData server
updates the MBS session to provide the file list when the pull ingest mode is
defined. The file list includes, among other information, the file URL to be
used by the MBSTF to fetch the file and the earliest fetch time.
Editor\'s note: The procedure and API for MCData service to use for providing
the file list is FFS and up to SA4 definition in TS 26.502.
7\. The MCData server signals the file transmission over the MBS user service
to the targeted MCData clients.
NOTE 3: After step 8, the file can be provided for distribution over the MBS
session. If the pull ingest mode is defined, the MBSTF fetches the file from
the indicated file URL. If the push ingest mode is defined, the MCData server
can start pushing the file to the corresponding URL.
8\. The file, distributed from MBSTF over 5G MBS session is received by the
MCData clients.
#### 6.34.1.2 Use of dynamic MBS user service establishment
Figure 6.34.1.2-1: Use of dynamic MBS user service establishment
1\. The MCData server determines to create a MBS user service with a given an
MBS user service id for the group communication session.
2\. The MCData server determines to use MBS user service provided by
MBSF/MBSTF for File distribution .It invokes the API over Nmb10/Nmb5 interface
for the related MBS user service.
NOTE 1: The procedure to determine the use of MBS user services is
implementation specific.
When the pull ingest mode is defined, the MCData server provides the file
list. The file list includes, among other information, the file URL to be used
by the MBSTF to fetch the file and the earliest fetch time. In response, the
MCData server gets the TMGI of the MBS session and the metadata of the MBS
user service. When the pull ingest mode is defined, the MCData server also
obtains the scheduling parameter for the file delivery. When the push ingest
mode is used, as part of the response from the MBSTF, the MCData server
obtains the URL to be used to push the file.
Editor\'s note: The APIs for MBS user services is FFS and up to SA4 definition
in TS 26.502.
3\. The MCData server passes using control plane signalling (Application
Service Announcement) the MBS user service information to the MCData client.
The MCData client obtains the TMGI, identifying the MBS session, from the MBS
user service description.
4\. The MCData client stores the information associated with the MBS user
service. The MCData client uses the TMGI and other MBS user service related
information to activate the monitoring of the MBS session. If MBS multicast
session is used, MCData client shall make a MBS session join to 5GS as defined
in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
5\. The MCData client that enters or is in the service area of at least one
announced TMGI indicates to the MCData server that the MCData client is able
to receive file distributed over MBS, whereby the MCData server may decide to
use this MBS user service instead of unicast session for MC communication
sessions.
6\. The MCData server signals the file transmission over the MBS user service
to the targeted MCData clients.
NOTE 2: After step 6, the file can be provided for distribution over the MBS
session. If the pull ingest mode is defined, the MBSTF fetches the file from
the indicated file URL. If the push ingest mode is defined, the MCData server
can start pushing the file to the corresponding URL.
7\. The file, distributed from MBSTF over 5G MBS session is received by the
MCData clients.
#### 6.34.1.3 Providing stored files in the MCData content server for
distribution over MBS
##### 6.34.1.3.1 General
As described in 3GPP TS 23.282 [5], the MCData content server provides a
repository area where authorized MCData users temporarily store files that are
intended to be shared with other MCData users. The distribution of such files
targeting a group of MCData users can be performed over MBS.
For the case that the MBSF/MBSTF are deployed, the file can be provided by the
MCData server to ingest the file into the MBSTF (e.g. pull or push) for
distribution over the MBS sessions.
Editor\'s note: It is FFS and up to SA4 definition on how to provide the APIs
for MCData to ingest the file in TS 26.502.
##### 6.34.1.3.2 File fetching by the MCData server
A file can be fetched by the MCData server from the MCData content server over
the MCData-FD-5 reference point using the file URL provided by MCData users.
The MCData server, thus, enables via the Nmb8 interface that the file is
ingested, either by pull or push, into the MBSTF for distribution over MBS.
NOTE 1: The file also becomes available for the case that the MCData server
decides to distribute the file over the Nmb8 interface to MCData users from
the target MCData group.
When the MCData server defines a pull ingest mode, the MCData server provides
via theNmb10/N33interface, the resource location from which the MBSTF will
fetch the file as well as other session properties.
When the MCData server defines a push ingest mode, the MCData server directly
ingests into the MBSTF via the Nmb8 interface the file obtained from the
MCData content server. The MBSF provides to the MCData server the URL to be
used to push the file(s).
NOTE 2: For the push ingest mode, the MCData server is always the functional
entity ingesting the file content into the MBSTF via the Nmb8 interface.
The procedure in figure 6.34.1.3.2-1 describes the case where the file to be
distributed over MBS is fetched by the MCData server from the MCData content
server.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCData users on the MCData client 1 to n belong to the same MCData
group and are already registered and affiliated for receiving MCData service.
\- The file to be distributed is uploaded to the MCData content server.
\- The MBSTF has the necessary permissions to fetch a file from the MCData
system.
Figure 6.34.1.3.2-1: File fetching by the MCData server for file distribution
over MBS
1\. The MCData server receives a request from the MCData client 1 to
distribute a file to a target MCData group. The MCData file distribution
request contains the resource location (i.e. the file URL) in the MCData
content server.
2\. The MCData server decides to fetch the file from the MCData content server
via the MCData-FD-5 reference point.
3\. The MCData server creates an MBS service and session for file delivery
using Nmb10/N33 procedures via the Nmb10/Nmb5 interface, as described in 3GPP
TS 26.502[. The MCData server indicates, among other session properties, the
ingest mode. For the case of pull ingest mode, the MCData server provides the
file URL from which the MBSTF will fetch the file. For the case of push ingest
mode, the MBSF provides to the MCData server the URL to be used to push the
file into the MBS session.
NOTE 3: Step 3 may also occur before step 2.
4\. The MCData server provides to the MCData users from the target MCData
group the application signalling related to the MBS session and the file
distribution.
5a. For the case that the file is ingested into the MBSTF based on the push
ingest mode, the MCData server pushes the file to the URL indicated by the
MBSF.
5b. For the case that the file is ingested into the MBSTF based on the pull
ingest mode, the MCData pulls the file from the provided file URL.
6\. The MBSTF distributes the file over the established MBS session.
##### 6.34.1.3.3 File fetching by the MBSF/MBSTF/NEF
When the MCData server defines a pull ingest mode, the MCData server can
alternatively provide to the MBSF/MBSTF/NEF the resource location in the
MCData content server (i.e. the file URL contained within the received file
distribution request). The MBSF/MBSTF/NEF, thus, will directly fetch the file
from the MCData content server.
NOTE 1: In order to the enable that the MBSTF fetches the file from the MCData
content server, the MCData content server supports theNmb10 to the MBSTF.
NOTE 2: For the case that the file is ingested into the MBSTF from the MCData
content server, only the pull ingest mode is supported. When push ingest mode
is required, the procedure is described in clause 6.2.1.2.1.
The procedure in figure 6.34.1.3.3-1 describes the case where the file to be
distributed over MBS is fetched by the MBSF/MBSTF/NEF from the MCData content
server.
Pre-conditions:
\- The MCData users on the MCData client 1 to n belong to the same MCData
group and are already registered and affiliated for receiving MCData service.
\- The file to be distributed is uploaded to the MCData content server.
\- The MBSF/MBSTF/NEF has the necessary permissions to fetch a file from the
MCData system.
Figure 6.34.1.3.3-1: File fetching by the MBSF/MBSTF/NEF for file distribution
over MBS
1\. The MCData server receives a request from the MCData client 1 to
distribute a file to a target MCData group. The MCData file distribution
request contains the resource location (i.e. the file URL) in the MCData
content server.
2\. The MCData server creates an MBS service and session for file delivery
usingNmb10/Nmb30 procedures via the xMB‑C interface, as described in 3GPP TS
26.348 [19]. The MCData server defines, among other session properties, the
ingest mode to pull. The MCData server provides the file URL from which the
MBSF/MBSTF/NEF will fetch the file from the MCData content server.
3\. The MCData server provides to the MCData users from the target MCData
group the application signalling related to the MBS session and the file
distribution.
4\. The MBSTF fetches the file from the MCData content server via the Nmb8
interface.
5\. The MBSTF distributes the file over the established MBS session. When the
target MCData clients have activated the reception for that service and are
located within the MBS area coverage, the MCData clients receive the file.
### 6.34.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
In addition to the functions and procedure defined in 3GPP TS 23.282 [5].
MCData services server should supported the required features for invoking of
File Distribution service of MBSF/MBSTF as the content provider.

To address sub-key issue#13.9, solution 8 provides the MC service application
architecture over 5G MBS in reference point representation in alignment with
3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. The solution provides an updated functional model for
application plane to support MC services including MCPTT, MCVideo and MCData
over 5GS and defines the reference points between the different nodes. These
architecture models are assumed to be for transport only mode. Furthermore,
the solution provides a list of functions done by the MC service server to
enable group communications over 5G MBS sessions.
To address sub-key issue#13.2, solution 9 provides a high-level overview and
description of the broadcast and multicast 5G MBS sessions. It provides an
understanding of the concepts related to the use of 5G MBS sessions for MC
group communications. The solution is based on the 5G MBS sessions aspects
defined in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], and it is recommended to understand and
identify the functional properties of 5G MBS sessions as it introduces the
proper procedures related to the use of 5G MBS sessions. Furthermore, the
solution discusses the life cycle of both broadcast and multicast MBS sessions
based on 3GPP TS 23.247 [19] and identifies the difference between types or
modes of MBS sessions (broadcast or multicast), and how each mode requires
different subsequent procedures for MC group communications. Similar to eMBMS
bearers, MBS sessions are first configured (with or without PCC) either as a
broadcast or multicast session mode and announced to the associated MC service
group. However, the session establishment stage depends on the mode of the
configured MBS session. Therefore, the MBS session mode is an essential
information element in MBS session related procedures - in specific MBS
session configuration and service announcement. Hence, it facilitates having
aligned procedures, which are common for both broadcast and multicast MBS
sessions. Finally, solution 20 discusses which MBS session mode to be
considered for a certain MC group communication. As it is implementation
specific it can be discarded in normative work.
To address sub-key issue#13.1, sub-key issue#13.3 and sub-key issue#13.7
similar to the concepts of eMBMS bearers, MC service server can either request
the configuration of MBS sessions to be either dynamically or prior to
application layer call setup (known as pre-established bearers in LTE).
Solutions 12 and 14 cover dynamically configured and announced sessions for
multicast MBS and broadcast MBS sessions, respectively. Furthermore, solution
10 addresses as well the MBS session configuration and service announcement
aspects rather in one procedure being common for both broadcast and multicast
MBS sessions via the use of the MBS session mode information element. These
solutions are aligned, however solution 10 emphasizes on the importance of MBS
listening status report for both MBS session modes, and the information
elements related to MBS service area may need to be revisited upon further
updates in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. Solutions 13 and 15 cover the same aspects for
pre-established multicast MBS and broadcast MBS sessions, respectively. In the
normative work, these solutions can be combined in one common procedure per
configuration option.
To address sub-key issue#13.5, solution 11 discusses MC data transmission over
both broadcast and multicast MBS sessions along with the required information
elements. Both solutions identify the required information elements associated
with the corresponding procedures. Furthermore, MC data transmission are
discussed in solutions 16 and 17 for multicast MBS sessions and broadcast MBS
sessions, respectively. They provide separate procedures per MBS session mode
where solution 11 is applicable to both modes. Solution 16 introduces
multicast session status report information being sent from the MC service
clients to the server indicating their successful join of the corresponding
multicast MBS session ID. This information however can also be achieved by
sending an acknowledgement of the MBS session UE join notification as
indicated in solution 10. Moreover, solution 11 is aligned with the life cycle
of MBS sessions described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19]. Moreover, solution 11
considers the aspects related to the ability of an MC service server to
activate the established multicast MBS session prior to MC data transmission.
During the broadcast MBS session configuration procedure, the session is also
established and starts delivering the MC data to the associated MC service
group. However, a configured multicast MBS session is only considered
established once the first UE session join performed by MC service UE(s) get
accepted. The multicast MBS session is then established and either has an
active or inactive state. Such aspects are clearly highlighted in solutions
31.
To address sub-key issue#13.3, The MC service server can configure several
broadcast and multicast MBS sessions with certain aspects, such as service and
media requirements, certain service area, or associated with a certain MC
service group. However, the MC service server is still capable of updating and
modifying any of the previously mentioned aspects once the need has emerged
during its life cycle of the sessions. Solution 25 discusses the MBS session
update procedure for MC group communication, which is applicable to both
broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.
To address sub-key issue#13.11, Once the MC service server decides that a
certain MBS session is no longer needed for any group communication purposes,
it can decide to release the session by triggering an MBS session release
procedure defined in solution 24. Furthermore, the server can decide to de-
announce it as in solution 28 so that the MC service client can stop
monitoring or perform a UE session leave in broadcast or multicast MBS
sessions, respectively.
To address sub-key issue#13.4, In terms of service continuity, two main
aspects are considered. First, intra-system service continuity which
facilitates the switch of MC data delivery between unicast PDU session and MBS
sessions (of both session modes) as in solutions 18, 19 and 33, where solution
33 provides a common procedure which is applicable to both broadcast and
multicast. Solution 18 provides guidance about SA2/RAN mechanism for
supporting of individual delivery and shared delivery for 5G MBS multicast. It
can be used as substitution of application layer mechanism as solution 33.
Solution 19 assumes that either unicast PDU session or MBS session is enabled,
whereas solution 33 assumes that both of them are enabled in alignment with
3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
To address sub-key issue#13.8, inter-system service continuity between LTE and
5G is discussed in solutions 32, where the MC service clients are guided via
the MC service server to switch between LTE and 5G (whether broadcast or
multicast MBS sessions) to ensure service continuity when the same MC service
is provided in both technologies.
To address sub-key issue#13.14 and sub-key issue#13.5, solutions 21 and 29 as
well as 22 and 30 discuss aspects related to MCPTT and MCVideo call connect
and disconnect over broadcast and multicast MBS sessions, respectively.
However, solutions 29 and 30 provide common procedures for broadcast and
multicast MBS sessions, and are aligned with the life cycle of MBS sessions
described in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19], and service announcement concepts in 3GPP TS
23.280 [2]. It is proposed to use the Sol#29 as the baseline candidate
solution in the normative work. Furthermore, solution #11 discusses MC DL
delivery for MC group communication in general, which can be considered for
normative work.
# 8 Conclusions
## 8.1 Key issues #2, 5, 6 and 8: Unicast communication
The analysis done for key issues 2, 5, 6 and 8 and the corresponding solutions
1, 2, 3 and 4 addressing the focus area unicast communication are recommended
for the normative work to support of MC services over 5GS.
## 8.2 Key issue #13: MC services over 5G MBS
### 8.2.1 General
The conclusion related to key issue # 13 is arranged as follows:
Clause 8.2.2 provides a comprehensive conclusion to key issue #13 related to
MC services over 5G MBS sessions.
Clause 8.2.3 provides detailed conclusions focused on the sub-issues within
key issue #13.
### 8.2.2 Comprehensive conclusion
The following aspects and observations to be considered as lessons learned
from the study and guidance to be taken into account in the normative work.
1\. Transport only service mode has been defined. Use cases related to full-
service mode -- such as file delivery, has not yet been fully discussed, as it
relies on work done in other work groups, e.g., SA2 and SA4.
2\. It is essential to include solutions which reflect the life cycle of
broadcast and multicast MBS sessions in alignment with 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
3\. Broadcast and multicast MBS sessions are identified via MBS session ID,
which may have any of two types: TMGI, and source specific IP multicast
address, where the latter is only valid for multicast MBS sessions.
Furthermore, the MBS session mode identifies the session type: broadcast or
multicast MBS sessions.
4\. Utilizing the MBS session mode information element is recommended to
provide common procedures which are applicable to broadcast and multicast MBS
sessions.
5\. Related to local MC services, broadcast MBS sessions are local MBS
sessions by default, whereas multicast MBS sessions may or may not be related
to a local service area. For local MBS services, i.e., for broadcast and local
multicast MBS sessions, the service area is to be provided to the MC service
clients during MBS service announcement.
6\. Recommendations or aspects regarding the choice of session mode (either
broadcast or multicast MBS sessions) can be excluded from normative work, as
it is an implementation specific matter.
7\. Regarding the term "pre-established", it is recommended to rather use the
term "pre-configured" instead, as the concept behind MBS session establishment
has different meaning than in LTE. Having a rather detailed look into the
multicast MBS session states, once established, a pre-configured multicast MBS
session may have state transition from NULL/Configured to "inactive" state
directly. Its state can then be triggered by MC service server or 5GC (MB-UPF)
to change between "active" and "inactive" based on the need of transmitting MC
data to the associated MC service group. However, dynamically configured
multicast MBS sessions need to be established directly into "active" state.
This is aligned with the multicast MBS session state model defined in 3GPP TS
23.247 [19]. Therefore, procedures related to dynamically configured multicast
MBS sessions needs to describe the session state, i.e., being established
directly with an "active" state, in alignment with 3GPP TS 23.247 [19].
8\. The MC service server can request the configuration of MBS
sessions/creation of MBS session (either broadcast or multicast MBS sessions)
either dynamically once the need has emerged, or prior to application layer
signalling call setup, i.e., pre-configured.
9\. The MC service server can configure several broadcast and multicast MBS
sessions with certain aspects, such as service and media requirements, certain
service area, or associated with a certain MC service group. However, the MC
service server is still capable of updating and modifying any of the
previously mentioned aspects once the need has emerged during its life cycle
of the sessions. The MBS session update for MC group communication is
applicable to both broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.
10\. Open issues and unfinalized aspects in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19] are still to
be considered and revisited during work related to MC services over 5G MBS
sessions. Current open issues in 3GPP TS 23.247 [19] include: first, changing
related to the terminology of the life cycle of MBS sessions, in specific MBS
session configuration step, and whether to utilize the term MBS session
configuration or management. Second, possible update on the service
announcement information elements related to MBS service area. Third, any
future update in MBS session configuration when PCC rule is considered, hence
related solutions may need to be revisited.
### 8.2.3 Conclusions based on sub-key issues
Related to 5G MBS features and configurations in sub key issue 13.1, it is
recommended to consider solution 10 as a common solution which is applicable
to broadcast and multicast MBS session. Related to dynamically configured MBS
sessions, solutions 12 and 14 can be combined in one solution being applicable
to broadcast and multicast MBS sessions.
Related to sub-key issue 13.2, solution 20 has brought some recommendations
and considerations on this matter. However, the choice between broadcast or
multicast MBS session is implementation specific, and not to be included in
normative work.
Whether broadcast or multicast MBS sessions, the members of MC service group
are provided with necessary information related to the associated session via
the MBS service announcement phase, as in sub-key issue 13.3. Solutions 10 to
15 discuss such aspects, where solution 10 can be considered for normative
work as it is applicable to both session modes.
In terms of MBS service continuity between unicast PDU session and multicast
and broadcast MBS session, i.e., sub key issue 13.4, solutions 18, 19 and 33
discuss related aspects, which can be merged and considered for normative
work.
In terms of MC data delivery, i.e., sub key issue #13.5, it is recommended to
consider solution 11 for MCX group communications and combined with solutions
16 and 17.
Related to local MBS sessions, i.e., sub key issue 13.6, they are addressed in
solutions 10 to 15. Once local MBS is considered, either in broadcast or local
multicast MBS sessions, the corresponding service area to be included in the
MBS service announcement. The solutions recommendations are aligned with sub-
key issue #13.3.
Sub key issue 13.7 discusses MC service requirements, i.e., QoS requirements
for group communications. The interaction between the MC service server and
the 5GC to provide the necessary service requirements are discussed in several
solutions, including solutions 10, 13 and 15. The solutions recommendation is
aligned with sub-key issue #13.3.
Solution 32 addresses MC service continuity between 5G and LTE networks, as
addressed in sub key issue 13.8. The MC service client is guided via
application layer signalling sent by the MC service server. The solution
considers all possible scenarios within the inter-system mobility (in terms of
the MBS sessions/bearer availability to serve the MC service client) and can
be considered for normative work.
Sub key issue 13.9 discusses application architecture related to 5G MBS.
Solution 8 provides a detailed functional model over the application plane to
enable MC services over 5G MBS including the reference point architecture. The
solution is related to transport only mode and can be considered for normative
work.
Focusing on sub key issue 13.10 related to 5G MBS functionalities, solution 9
provides a high-level overview and description of the broadcast and multicast
5G MBS sessions. It provides an understanding of the concepts related to the
use of 5G MBS sessions for MC group communications. The solution is
recommended to understand and identify the functional properties of 5G MBS
sessions as it introduces the proper procedures related to the use of 5G MBS
sessions. Furthermore, the solution discusses the life cycle of both broadcast
and multicast MBS sessions based on 3GPP TS 23.247 [19] and identifies the
difference between types or modes of MBS sessions (broadcast or multicast),
and how each mode requires different subsequent procedures for MC group
communications.
It is recommended to combine solution 8 and 9 together as they are
complementary to each other, and both can be considered for normative work.
Sub key issue 13.11 focuses on the removal of 5G MBS sessions. Solutions 24
and 28 consider the procedures associated to MBS session release and de-
announcement, respectively, both being triggered by the MC service server and
applicable to broadcast and multicast MBS sessions. The solutions describe the
subsequent behaviour of MC service clients. Furthermore, solution 23 focuses
on aspects related UE leaving a multicast MBS upon the request of MC service
server. Solutions 24 and 28 can be combined. The solutions provide different
use cases related to the removal or the un-use of MBS sessions and to be
considered in normative work.
Sub key issue 13.12 is rather MCX focused. Solutions 21 and 29 discussed MCPTT
group call connect and disconnect over 5G MBS sessions. Solution 29 can be
considered for normative work as it is aligned with the life cycle of MBS
sessions described in TS 23.247 [19] and is applicable to both broadcast and
multicast MBS sessions. Solutions 22 and 30 discussed MCVideo group call
connect and disconnect over 5G MBS sessions. Solution 30 can be considered for
normative work as it is aligned with the life cycle of MBS sessions described
in TS 23.247 [19] and is applicable to both broadcast and multicast MBS
sessions.
Finally, sub key issue 13.13 discusses the ability of the MC service server to
modify or influence the 5G MBS session state (if applicable). The MC service
server can update the service area, media or service requirements associated
with a certain broadcast and multicast MBS session have been discussed in
solution 25. Furthermore, its ability to trigger the activation or de-
activation of multicast MBS sessions is discussed in solution 31. Solutions 25
and 31 can be considered for normative work, as their underlying procedures
describe the ability of MC service server to control the media or service
requirements, targeted service area, as well as the NG-RAN resources
associated to a multicast MBS session via the MBS session activation or de-
activation.
Solution 32 can be considered as the basis for supporting service continuity
while UE preform inter-system mobility between 5G MBS and eMBMS for the
normative work.
## 8.3 Key issue#14: MC service over 5G ProSe
The Sol#26 addresses MC service support over 5G ProSe transport corresponding
to all technical aspects captured in key issue#14. 5G ProSe features required
by MC services are analyzed, the existing information flows used for MC
service over 4G ProSe can be reused, and the differences are specified. Sol#26
is thus considered as a candidate solution for the normative work to address
the key issue to support MC services over 5G ProSe.
