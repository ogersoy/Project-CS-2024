# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document is a technical report on LTE inter-band CA for 2 bands DL
with 2 bands UL under Rel-17 time frame. The purpose is to gather the relevant
background information and studies in order to address 2 bands DL/2 band UL
Inter-band Carrier Aggregation requirements for the Rel-16 band combinations
in Table 1-1.

This TR contains a band specific combination part. The actual requirements are
added to the corresponding technical specifications.
# 2 References {#references-1}
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 3 Definitions of terms, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Terms
For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in 3GPP TR 21.905
[1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes
precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905
[1].
**example:** text used to clarify abstract rules by applying them literally.
## 3.2 Symbols
For the purposes of the present document, the following symbols apply:
\ \
## 3.3 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR
21.905 [1] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if
any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].

# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for 2 bands DL/2 bands UL Inter-
band Carrier Aggregation under Rel-17 timeframe. The document covers each band
combination specific issues (i.e. one sub-clause defined per band combination)
## 4.1 TR maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the band
combination have been implemented.

Based on Table 5.2.2-1, there is an IMD3 hit on the Rx of band 8. However, it
is understood that this should not be an issue since it is related to the
cross modulation of band 28 UL with the modulation BW of band 8, and the
duplex distance is large enough for this to be manageable. As such, no
additional MSD is specified.

measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1-2 in TS 36.101 [4] and Table 6.5.3.1-2 in TS 38.101-1 [2] are
permitted for each assigned carrier used in the measurement due to 2^nd^,
3^rd^, 4^th^ or 5^th^ harmonic spurious emissions. Due to spreading of the
harmonic emission the exception is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency
range immediately outside the harmonic emission on both sides of the harmonic
emission. This results in an overall exception interval centred at the
harmonic emission of (2 MHz + N x L~CRB~ x 180 kHz), where N is 2, 3, 4, 5 for
the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^ or 5^th^ harmonic respectively. The exception is
allowed if the measurement bandwidth (MBW) totally or partially overlaps the
overall exception interval.
