# 4 General
The UTDOA architecture is described in TS 36.305 [2].
An LMU may be deployed in three ways:
● LMU class 1: LMU integrated into base station
● LMU class 2: LMU co-sited with base station and sharing antenna with the
base station
● LMU class 3: standalone LMU with own receive antenna
# 5 LMU RF Requirements
## 5.1 General
The requirements in clause 5 are expressed for a single receiver antenna
connector. For receivers with antenna diversity, the requirements apply for
each receiver antenna connector.
When the LMU is configured to receive multiple carriers for one or more UEs,
all RF requirements are applicable for each received carrier. For ACS,
blocking and intermodulation characteristics, the negative offsets of the
interfering signal apply relative to the lower edge and positive offsets of
the interfering signal apply relative to the higher edge.
Receiver test ports for LMU class 1 are illustrated in Figure 5.1-1. Receiver
test ports for LMU class 2 are illustrated in Figure 5.1-2. Receiver test
ports for LMU class 3 are illustrated in Figure 5.1-3. If any external
apparatus, e.g., a RX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices
is used, LMU RF requirements specified in this specification apply at the far
end antenna connector (port B); otherwise, the requirements apply at port A.
Requirements applicability for different LMU classes is summarized in Table
5.1-1.

### 5.1.1 Detection probability requirement and false alarm requirement
The performance metrics used in RF requirements are detection probability and
false alarm. The probability of detection is defined as the ratio of received
measurement reports to the total number of measurement requests. The false
alarm rate is the probability of detection of a signal that is not present,
and is defined as the percentage of the received measurement reports to the
total number of measurement requests with the measurement configuration of a
signal that is not present. The detection probability requirement is 99% and
the false alarm requirement is 0.1%. The detection probability requirement and
the false alarm requirement apply for any number of receive ports, any channel
bandwidth, and all frame structures.
### 5.1.2 Operating bands

The reference sensitivity power level P~REFSENS~ is the minimum mean power
received at the antenna connector at which a detection probability requirement
and a false alarm requirement shall be met for a specified reference
measurement channel.
### 5.2.1 Minimum requirement
The LMU shall receive the reference measurement channel while meeting the
detection probability and false alarm requirement in clause 5.1.1. The
reference measurement channel is described in Table 5.2.1-1 with parameters
specified in Annex A.

Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
an adjacent channel signal with a specified centre frequency offset of the
interfering signal to the band edge of a victim system. In this condition a
detection probability requirement and a false alarm requirement shall be met
for a specified reference measurement channel. The interfering signal shall be
an E-UTRA signal as specified in Annex C.
### 5.5.1 Minimum requirement
The LMU shall receive the reference measurement channel while meeting the
detection probability and false alarm requirement in clause 5.1.1. The
reference measurement channel is specified in Annex A with parameters
specified in Table 5.2.1-1.
The wanted and the interfering signal coupled to the BS antenna input are
specified in Tables 5.5.1-1 and 5.5.1-2 for narrowband blocking and in Table

The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or amplified
in a receiver that appear at the LMU receiver antenna connector. The
requirement specified in this clause, is to reduce the impact on a co-sited
BS, a different BS, or a different LMU.
### 5.7.1 Minimum requirement

co-sited with a BS, co-located with a different BS, or with another LMU.
## 5.8 Receiver intermodulation
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal. In this condition, a detection probability requirement and a false
alarm requirement shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel.
Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA signal as specified in
Annex C.
### 5.8.1 Minimum requirement
The LMU shall receive the reference measurement channel while meeting the
detection probability and false alarm requirement in clause 5.1.1, with a
wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering signals
coupled to the LMU antenna input, with the conditions specified in Tables
5.8.1-1 and 5.8.1-2 for intermodulation performance and in Tables 5.8.1-3,
5.8.1-4 and Table 5.8.1-5 for narrowband intermodulation performance. The

## 6.2 Requirements
For all measurements performed in parallel according to the LMU measurement
capability requirements, the UL RTOA measurement accuracy shall be fulfilled
according to the accuracy requirements as specified in clause 7.
The requirements for UL RTOA measurements for UE not configured with DRX are
specified in clauses 6.2.1 and 6.2.2 for FDD and TDD, respectively.
A UE configured with DRX does not transmit instances of periodic SRS while not
in Active Time state, TS 36.321 [4].
In this LTE release:
\- UL RTOA measurements may fail when the UE is configured with DRX while the
UL RTOA measurements are performed by LMUs.
\- UL RTOA measurement requirements for UE configured with DRX are not
specified.
### 6.2.1 Requirements for FDD without DRX
The LMU shall be able to perform UL RTOA measurements in all supported FDD
bands and meet the requirements in this clause.
The LMU shall be able to perform and report a UE\'s UL RTOA measurements,
based in its SRS transmissions, within ms as given below:
,
\- where is the SRS periodicity in ms, according to the srsConfiguration IE
received by the LMU from the E-SMLC via SLmAP [5];
\- is the number of SRS measurement occasions (depends on the applicable
bandwidth);
\- n is the number of requested UL RTOA measurements per carrier;
\- N is the minimum number of UL RTOA measurements per uplink carrier
frequency for different UEs that can be measured in parallel, and
\- =50 ms is a margin to account e.g. for the time necessary for sampling and
processing.
An SRS measurement occasion is a subframe that may contain SRS, according to
the srsConfiguration IE received by LMU from E-SMLC via SLmAP [5]. The UE may
drop some SRSs transmissions (see clause 6.2.4).
The same required measurement time applies irrespective of whether parallel UL
RTOA measurements are requested for a single frequency carrier, multiple
frequency carriers, or multiple frequency bands.
For all measurements performed in parallel according to the LMU measurement
capability requirements specified in clause 6.1 and the measurement
requirements specified in clause 6.2, the UL RTOA measurement accuracy shall
be fulfilled according to the accuracy requirements as specified in clause 7.
Note: Parameters, M and the applicable bandwidth are as specified in clause 7.
### 6.2.2 Requirements for TDD without DRX
The LMU shall be able to perform UL RTOA measurements in all supported TDD
bands and meet the requirements in this clause.
The LMU shall be able to perform and report a UE\'s UL RTOA measurements,
based on its SRS transmissions, within ms. When the SRS periodicity is greater
than 2 ms, the UL RTOA measurement requirements specified in clause 6.2.1
apply. For SRS periodicity =2 ms, is as defined below:
,
Where:
\- is the number of SRS measurement occasions (depends on the applicable
bandwidth),
\- N~SP~ is the number of downlink to uplink switch points in a radio frame,
\- _n_ is the number of requested UL RTOA measurements per carrier,
\- _N_ is the minimum number of UL RTOA measurements per uplink carrier
frequency for different UEs that can be measured in parallel, and
\- = 50 ms is a margin to account e.g. for the time necessary for sampling and
processing.
An SRS measurement occasion is a subframe that may contain SRS, according to
the srsConfiguration IE received by LMU from E-SMLC via SLmAP [5]. The UE may
drop some SRSs transmissions (see clause 6.2.4).
The same required measurement time applies irrespective of whether parallel UL
RTOA measurements are requested for a single frequency carrier, multiple
frequency carriers, or multiple frequency bands.
For all measurements performed in parallel according to the LMU measurement
capability requirements specified in , 6.1 and the measurement requirements
specified in clause 6.2, the UL RTOA measurement accuracy shall be fulfilled
according to the accuracy requirements as specified in clause 7.
Note: Parameters, M and the applicable bandwidth are as specified in clause 7.
### 6.2.3 UL RTOA Measurements upon Receiving SRS Configuration Update
UE SRS configuration may change for one or more cells, or the set of cells
with SRS configured for the UE may change during UL positioning.
Upon receiving an updated SRS configuration, the LMU shall continue the UL
RTOA measurement for a cell and report the measurement, while meeting the
requirements in Section 6, in the following two cases:
1\. The new SRS configuration for the cell is the same as the SRS
configuration for this cell before receiving the SRS configuration update.
2\. The new SRS configuration for the cell is a superset of the SRS
configuration for this cell received before the update, i.e. the updated SRS
configuration comprises the SRS configuration before the update but may also
have other SRS configured.
NOTE: Requirements specified in , 6 corresponding to the SRS periodicity
before the update apply in both cases above.
### 6.2.4 UL RTOA Measurements when Dropped SRS occurs
With or without DRX, dropped SRS may occur, e.g., due to measurement gaps,
autonomous gaps, interruptions due to CA, and other channel transmissions. UL
RTOA measurement performance may degrade when dropped SRS occur.
## 6.3 Measurement Reporting Delay
The requirements in clause 6 assume that the UL RTOA measurement report is not
delayed by other SLmAP signalling.
# 7 UL RTOA Measurement Accuracy Requirements
## 7.1 General
All accuracy requirements in Section 7.2 shall apply under the following
additional conditions:
\- All configured SRS have been transmitted by the UE,
\- DRX is not configured in the UE,
\- The maximum transmit power adjustment in the UE during the UL RTOA
measurement time is within the range of ±3.5 dB,
\- The maximum transmit timing adjustment in the UE during the UL RTOA
measurement time is within the range of ±4.5 Ts.

# 8 UL RTOA Measurement Report Mapping
The reporting range of the UL RTOA measurement is defined from 0×T~s~ to
9598×T~s~ with 2×T~s~ resolution. The mapping of the measured quantity is
defined in Table 8-1. The UL RTOA measurement is reported by the LMU to the
E-SMLC via SLmAP in ULRTOAMeasurements IE.

# 9 Search Window for UL RTOA Measurements
The E-SMLC may provide search window information to the LMU via the SLmAP [5],
which may be used by the LMU for configuring its receiver for performing UL
RTOA measurements. The search window parameters include:
\- expected propagation delay T (center of the search window), and
\- delay uncertainty ∆ (half width of the search window);
which together define the search window [T-∆;T+∆] centered at time T, and
where ∆ may be a timing advance measurement for serving cell.
The mapping for the two search window parameters is defined in Table 9-1 and
Table 9-2. The expected propagation delay is defined from 0×Ts to 9592×Ts with
8×Ts resolution. The delay uncertainty is defined from 0×Ts to 792×Ts with
8×Ts resolution.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Propagation Conditions
# B.1 Static Propagation condition
The propagation for the static performance measurement is an Additive White
Gaussian Noise (AWGN) environment. No fading or multi-paths exist for this
propagation model.
# B.2 Multi-path fading propagation conditions
Tables B.2-1 -- B.2.3 show multi-path delay profiles that are used for the
performance measurements in multi-path fading environment. All taps have
classical Doppler spectrum, defined as:
(CLASS) $\left( \right)\left( \left(_{} \right)^{} \right)^{}$ for $_{}_{}$.

###### ## Annex C (informative): Characteristics of the interfering signals
The interfering signal for the 1.4 MHz in-channel requirement shall be a
PUCCH. For the other requirements the interferer shall be a PUSCH containing
data and reference symbols. Normal cyclic prefix is used. The data content
shall be uncorrelated to the wanted signal and modulated according to clause 5
of TS 36.211. Mapping of the PUCCH and PUSCH modulation to receiver
requirement are specified in table C-1.1.
