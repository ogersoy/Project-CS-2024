# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply.\ A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**ACL functionality:** A functionality controlling the access to network
nodes. In case of Access Control Lists (ACL) functionality is applied in a
network node the network node may only accept connections from other peer
network nodes once the source addresses of the sending network node is already
known in the target node.
**CSG Cell** : an E-UTRAN cell broadcasting a CSG indicator set to true and a
CSG identity. This cell operates in Closed Access Mode as defined in TS 22.220
[28].
**DAPS Handover** : as defined in TS 36.300 [14].
**DCN-ID:** DCN identity identifies a specific decicated core network (DCN).
**Dual Connectivity** : as defined in TS 36.300 [14].
**Elementary Procedure:** S1AP consists of Elementary Procedures (EPs). An
Elementary Procedure is a unit of interaction between eNBs and the EPC. These
Elementary Procedures are defined separately and are intended to be used to
build up complete sequences in a flexible manner. If the independence between
some EPs is restricted, it is described under the relevant EP description.
Unless otherwise stated by the restrictions, the EPs may be invoked
independently of each other as standalone procedures, which can be active in
parallel. The usage of several S1AP EPs together or together with EPs from
other interfaces is specified in stage 2 specifications (e.g., TS 23.401 [11]
and TS 36.300 [14]).
An EP consists of an initiating message and possibly a response message. Two
kinds of EPs are used:
\- **Class 1:** Elementary Procedures with response (success and/or failure).
\- **Class 2:** Elementary Procedures without response.
For Class 1 EPs, the types of responses can be as follows:
Successful:
\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the elementary procedure
successfully completed with the receipt of the response.
Unsuccessful:
\- A signalling message explicitly indicates that the EP failed.
\- On time supervision expiry (i.e., absence of expected response).
Successful and Unsuccessful:
\- One signalling message reports both successful and unsuccessful outcome for
the different included requests. The response message used is the one defined
for successful outcome.
Class 2 EPs are considered always successful.
**eNB UE S1AP ID:** as defined in TS 36.401 [2].
**Hybrid Cell** : an E-UTRAN cell broadcasting a CSG indicator set to false
and a CSG identity. This cell operates in Hybrid Access Mode as defined in TS
22.220 [28].
**MME UE S1AP ID:** as defined in TS 36.401 [2].
**E-RAB: as defined in** TS 36.401 [2].
NOTE 1: The E-RAB is either a default E-RAB or a dedicated E-RAB.
**E-RAB ID** : the E-RAB ID uniquely identifies an E-RAB for one UE.
NOTE 2: The E-RAB ID remains unique for the UE even if the UE-associated
logical S1-connection is released during periods of user inactivity.
**Data Radio Bearer** : the Data Radio bearer transports the packets of an
E-RAB between a UE and an eNB. There is a one-to-one mapping between the E-RAB
and the Data Radio Bearer.
**Secondary Cell Group** : as defined in TS 36.300 [14].
**UE-associated signalling:** When S1-AP messages associated to one UE uses
the UE-associated logical S1-connection for association of the message to the
UE in eNB and EPC.
**UE-associated logical S1-connection: The UE-associated logical S1-connection
uses the identities _MME UE S1AP ID_** and **_eNB UE S1AP ID_** according to
definition in TS **23.401 [11]. For a received UE associated S1-AP message
the** MME identifies **the** associated UE based on the **_MME UE S1AP ID_**
IE and **the** eNB identifies **the** associated UE based on the **_eNB UE
S1AP ID_** IE _._ **The UE-associated logical S1-connection may exist before
the S1 UE context is setup in eNB.**

# 4 General
## 4.1 Procedure Specification Principles
The principle for specifying the procedure logic is to specify the functional
behaviour of the terminating node exactly and completely. Any rule that
specifies the behaviour of the originating node shall be possible to be
verified with information that is visible within the system.
The following specification principles have been applied for the procedure
text in clause 8:
\- The procedure text discriminates between:
1) Functionality which "shall" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall" perform a certain
function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node supports procedure
X but cannot perform functionality Y requested in the REQUEST message of a
Class 1 EP, the receiving node shall respond with the message used to report
unsuccessful outcome for this procedure, containing an appropriate cause
value.
2) Functionality which "shall, if supported" be executed
The procedure text indicates that the receiving node "shall, if supported,"
perform a certain function Y under a certain condition. If the receiving node
supports procedure X, but does not support functionality Y, the receiving node
shall proceed with the execution of the EP, possibly informing the requesting
node about the not supported functionality.
\- Any required inclusion of an optional IE in a response message is
explicitly indicated in the procedure text. If the procedure text does not
explicitly indicate that an optional IE shall be included in a response
message, the optional IE shall not be included. For requirements on including
_Criticality Diagnostics_ IE, see clause 10.
## 4.2 Forwards and Backwards Compatibility
The forwards and backwards compatibility of the protocol is assured by
mechanism where all current and future messages, and IEs or groups of related
IEs, include ID and criticality fields that are coded in a standard format
that will not be changed in the future. These parts can always be decoded
regardless of the standard version.
## 4.3 Specification Notations
For the purposes of the present document, the following notations apply:
Procedure When referring to an elementary procedure in the specification the
Procedure Name is written with the first letters in each word in upper case
characters followed by the word "procedure", e.g., E-RAB procedure.
Message When referring to a message in the specification the MESSAGE NAME is
written with all letters in upper case characters followed by the word
"message", e.g., MESSAGE NAME message.
IE When referring to an information element (IE) in the specification the
_Information Element Name_ is written with the first letters in each word in
upper case characters and all letters in Italic font followed by the
abbreviation "IE", e.g., _Information Element_ IE.
Value of an IE When referring to the value of an information element (IE) in
the specification the "Value" is written as it is specified in subclause 9.2
enclosed by quotation marks, e.g., "Value".
# 5 S1AP Services
S1AP provides the signalling service between E-UTRAN and the evolved packet
core (EPC) that is required to fulfil the S1AP functions described in clause
7. S1AP services are divided into two groups:
> Non UE-associated services: They are related to the whole S1 interface
> instance between the eNB and MME utilising a non UE-associated signalling
> connection.
>
> UE-associated services: They are related to one UE. S1AP functions that
> provide these services are associated with a UE-associated signalling
> connection that is maintained for the UE in question.
# 6 Services Expected from Signalling Transport
The signalling connection shall provide in sequence delivery of S1AP messages.
S1AP shall be notified if the signalling connection breaks.
# 7 Functions of S1AP
The S1AP protocol has the following functions:
\- E-RAB management function: This overall functionality is responsible for
setting up, modifying and releasing E-RABs, which are triggered by the MME.
The release and modification of E-RABs may be triggered by the eNB as well.
\- Initial Context Transfer function: This functionality is used to establish
an S1UE context in the eNB, to setup the default IP connectivity, to setup one
or more E-RAB(s) if requested by the MME, and to transfer NAS signalling
related information to the eNB if needed.
\- UE Capability Info Indication function: This functionality is used to
provide the UE Capability Info when received from the UE to the MME.
\- Mobility Functions for UEs in LTE_ACTIVE in order to enable
\- a change of eNBs within SAE/LTE (Inter MME/Serving SAE-GW Handovers) via
the S1 interface (with EPC involvement).
\- a change of RAN nodes between different RATs (Inter-3GPP-RAT Handovers) via
the S1 interface (with EPC involvement).
\- Paging: This functionality provides the EPC with the capability to page the
UE.
\- S1 interface management functions comprise the:
\- Reset functionality to ensure a well defined initialisation on the S1
interface.
\- Error Indication functionality to allow a proper error reporting/handling
in cases where no failure messages are defined.
\- Overload function to indicate the load situation in the control plane of
the S1 interface.
\- Load balancing function to ensure equally loaded MMEs within an MME pool
area
\- S1 Setup functionality for initial S1 interface setup for providing
configuration information
\- eNB and MME Configuration Update functions are to update application level
configuration data needed for the eNB and MME to interoperate correctly on the
S1 interface.
\- NAS Signalling transport function between the UE and the MME is used:
\- to transfer and reroute NAS signalling related information and to establish
the S1 UE context in the eNB.
\- to transfer NAS signalling related information when the S1 UE context in
the eNB is already established.
\- S1 UE context Release function: This functionality is responsible to manage
the release of UE specific context in the eNB and the MME.
\- UE Context Modification function: This functionality allows to modify the
established UE Context partly.
\- UE Context Resumption function: This functionality allows keeping the UE
Context in the eNB for a UE in RRC_IDLE that has been enabled to use User
Plane EPS Optimization (see TS 23.401 [11]) and to resume the RRC connection
without the need to re-establish the UE Context.
\- Status Transfer: This functionality transfers PDCP SN Status information
from source eNB to target eNB in support of in-sequence delivery and
duplication avoidance for intra LTE handover.
\- Trace function: This functionality is to control a trace session recording
for a UE in ECM_CONNECTED or to control an MDT session transferring MDT
measurements collected by the UE.
\- Location Reporting: This functionality allows MME to be aware of the UE's
current location.
\- LPPa Signalling transport: This functionality transfers LPPa messages
between eNB and E-SMLC over the S1 interface.
\- S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling function: This functionality is to carry CDMA2000
signalling between UE and CDMA2000 RAT over the S1 Interface.
\- Warning message transmission function:\ This functionality provides the
means to start and overwrite the broadcasting of warning message.
\- RAN Information Management (RIM) function: This functionality allows the
request and transfer of RAN information (e.g., GERAN system information)
between two RAN nodes via the core network.
\- Configuration Transfer function: This functionality allows the request and
transfer of RAN configuration information (e.g., SON information) between two
RAN nodes via the core network.
\- UE Radio Capability Match function. The functionality enables the eNB to
derive and provide an indication to the MME whether the UE radio capabilities
are compatible with the network configuration for voice continuity.
\- PWS Restart Indication function. The functionality enables the eNB to
inform the MME that PWS information for some or all cells of the eNB are
available for reloading from the CBC if needed.
\- PWS Failure Indication function. The functionality enables the eNB to
inform the MME that ongoing PWS operation for one or more cells of the eNB has
failed.
\- Connection Establishment Indication function. The functionality enables the
MME to complete the establishment of the UE-associated logical S1-connection.
\- Retrieve UE Information function. The functionality enables the eNB to
request UE information from the MME.
\- UE Information Transfer function. The functionality enables the MME to
transfer UE information to the eNB.
\- CP Relocation function. The functionality enables the initiation of the UE-
associated logical S1-connection for a NB-IOT UE using Control Plane CIoT EPS
Optimisation following a re-establishment request.
\- Report of Secondary RAT data volumes function. The functionality enables
the eNB to report Secondary RAT data usage information in case of EN-DC as
specified in TS 23.401 [11].
\- QMC function. The functionality enables the eNB to collect QoE measurements
from the UE.

are using the UE-associated signalling.
## 8.2 E-RAB Management procedures
### 8.2.1 E-RAB Setup
#### 8.2.1.1 General
The purpose of the E-RAB Setup procedure is to assign resources on Uu and S1
for one or several E-RABs and to setup corresponding Data Radio Bearers for a
given UE. The procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.1.2-1: E-RAB Setup procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message to
the eNB.
\- The E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message shall contain the information required by
the eNB to build the E-RAB configuration consisting of at least one E-RAB and
for each E-RAB to setup include an _E-RAB to be Setup Item_ IE.
Upon reception of the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message, and if resources are
available for the requested configuration, the eNB shall execute the requested
E-RAB configuration. For each E-RAB and based on the _E-RAB level QoS
parameters_ IE the eNB shall establish a Data Radio Bearer and allocate the
required resources on Uu. The eNB shall pass the _NAS-PDU_ IE and the value
contained in the _E-RAB ID_ IE received for the E-RAB for each established
Data Radio Bearer to the UE. The eNB does not send the NAS PDUs associated to
the failed Data radio bearers to the UE. The eNB shall allocate the required
resources on S1 for the E-RABs requested to be established.
If the _Correlation ID_ IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message
towards the eNB with L-GW function for LIPA operation, then the eNB shall use
this information for LIPA operation for the concerned E-RAB.
If the _SIPTO Correlation ID_ IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST
message towards the eNB with L-GW function for SIPTO\@LN operation, then the
eNB shall use this information for SIPTO\@LN operation for the concerned
E-RAB.
If the _Bearer Type_ IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message and is
set to \"non IP\", then the eNB shall not perform IP header compression for
the concerned E-RAB.
If the _Ethernet Type_ IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message and
is set to \"True\", then the eNB shall, if supported, take this into account
to perform header compression appropriately for the concerned E-RAB.
For each E-RAB for which the _Security Indication_ IE is included in the _E-
RAB To Be Setup Item IEs_ IE of the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message:
\- if the _Integrity Protection Indication_ IE is set to \"required\", then
the eNB shall, if supported by the eNB and the UE, perform user plane
integrity protection for the concerned E-RAB as specified in TS 33.401 [15],
and otherwise it shall reject the establishment of the concerned E-RAB with an
appropriate cause value.
\- if the _Integrity Protection Indication_ IE is set to \"preferred\", then
the eNB should, if supported by the eNB and the UE, perform user plane
integrity protection for the concerned E-RAB as specified in TS 33.401 [15].
\- if the _Integrity Protection Indication_ IE is set to \"not needed\", then
the eNB shall not perform user plane integrity protection for the concerned
E-RAB.
The E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message may contain
\- the UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate IE.
If the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP
REQUEST the eNB shall
\- replace the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate by the
received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context;
\- use the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for non-GBR Bearers for the
concerned UE.
If the _UE_ _Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is not contained in the E-RAB
SETUP REQUEST message, the eNB shall use the previously provided UE Aggregate
Maximum Bit Rate which is stored in the UE context.
The eNB shall establish or modify the resources according to the values of the
_Allocation and Retention Priority_ IE (priority level and pre-emption
indicators) and the resource situation as follows:
\- The eNB shall consider the priority level of the requested E-RAB, when
deciding on the resource allocation.
\- The priority levels and the pre-emption indicators may (individually or in
combination) be used to determine whether the E-RAB setup has to be performed
unconditionally and immediately. If the requested E-RAB is marked as "may
trigger pre-emption" and the resource situation requires so, the eNB may
trigger the pre-emption procedure which may then cause the forced release of a
lower priority E-RAB which is marked as "pre-emptable". Whilst the process and
the extent of the pre-emption procedure are operator-dependent, the pre-
emption indicators shall be treated as follows:
1\. The values of the last received _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE and
_Priority Level_ IE shall prevail.
2\. If the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE is set to "may trigger pre-emption",
then this allocation request may trigger the pre-emption procedure.
3\. If the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE is set to "shall not trigger pre-
emption", then this allocation request shall not trigger the pre-emption
procedure.
4\. If the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE is set to "pre-emptable", then this
E-RAB shall be included in the pre-emption process.
5\. If the _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE is set to "not pre-emptable", then
this E-RAB shall not be included in the pre-emption process.
6\. If the _Priority Level_ IE is set to "no priority" the given values for
the _Pre-emption Capability_ IE and _Pre-emption Vulnerability_ IE shall not
be considered. Instead the values "shall not trigger pre-emption" and "not
pre-emptable" shall prevail.
\- The E-UTRAN pre-emption process shall keep the following rules:
1\. E-UTRAN shall only pre‑empt E-RABs with lower priority, in ascending order
of priority.
2\. The pre-emption may be done for E-RABs belonging to the same UE or to
other UEs.
The eNB shall report to the MME, in the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message, the
result for all the requested E-RABs.
\- A list of E-RABs which are successfully established shall be included in
the _E-RAB Setup List_ IE.
\- A list of E-RABs which failed to be established, if any, shall be included
in the _E-RAB Failed to Setup List_ IE.
In case of the establishment of an E-RAB the EPC must be prepared to receive
user data before the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message has been received.
When the eNB reports unsuccessful establishment of an E-RAB, the cause value
should be precise enough to enable the MME to know the reason for an
unsuccessful establishment, e.g., "Radio resources not available", "Failure in
the Radio Interface Procedure".
The eNB shall, if supported, report in the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message
location information of the UE in the _User Location Information_ IE.
If the _User Location Information_ IE is included in the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE
message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.401 [11].
**Interactions with Handover Preparation procedure:**
If a handover becomes necessary during E-RAB Setup, the eNB may interrupt the
ongoing E-RAB Setup procedure and initiate the Handover Preparation procedure
as follows:
1\. The eNB shall send the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE message in which the eNB shall
indicate, if necessary
\- all the E-RABs fail with an appropriate cause value, e.g., "S1 intra system
Handover triggered", "S1 inter system Handover triggered" or "X2 Handover
triggered".
2\. The eNB shall trigger the handover procedure.
#### 8.2.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation
The unsuccessful operation is specified in the successful operation section.
#### 8.2.1.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB receives a E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message containing a _E-RAB Level
QoS Parameters_ IE which contains a _QCI_ IE indicating a GBR bearer (as
defined in TS 23.203 [13]), and which does not contain the _GBR QoS
Information_ IE, the eNB shall consider the establishment of the corresponding
E-RAB as failed.
If the eNB receives an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message containing several _E-RAB
ID_ IEs (in the _E-RAB To Be Setup List_ IE) set to the same value, the eNB
shall report the establishment of the corresponding E-RABs as failed in the
E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE with the appropriate cause value, e.g., "Multiple E-RAB
ID instances".
If the eNB receives an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message containing a _E-RAB ID_ IE
(in the _E-RAB To Be Setup List_ IE) set to the value that identifies an
active E-RAB (established before the E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message was
received), the eNB shall report the establishment of the new E-RAB as failed
in the E-RAB SETUP RESPONSE with the appropriate cause value, e.g., "Multiple
E-RAB ID instances".
If the eNB receives an E-RAB SETUP REQUEST message containing both the
_Correlation ID_ and the _SIPTO Correlation ID_ IEs for the same E-RAB, the
eNB shall consider the establishment of the corresponding E-RAB as failed.
### 8.2.2 E-RAB Modify
#### 8.2.2.1 General
The purpose of the E-RAB Modify procedure is to enable modifications of
already established E-RABs for a given UE. The procedure uses UE-associated
signalling.
#### 8.2.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.2.2-1: E-RAB Modify procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message to
the eNB.
\- The E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message shall contain the information required by
the eNB to modify one or several E-RABs of the existing E-RAB configuration.
Information shall be present in the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message only when any
previously set value for the E-RAB configuration is requested to be modified.
Upon reception of the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message, and if resources are
available for the requested target configuration, the eNB shall execute the
modification of the requested E-RAB configuration. For each E-RAB that shall
be modified and for which the _Transport Information_ IE is not included and
based on the new _E-RAB level QoS parameters_ IE the eNB shall modify the Data
Radio Bearer configuration and change allocation of resources on Uu according
to the new resource request. The eNB shall pass the _NAS-PDU_ IE received for
the E-RAB to the UE when modifying the Data Radio Bearer configuration. The
eNB does not send the NAS PDUs associated to the failed Data radio bearers to
the UE. The eNB shall change allocation of resources on S1 according to the
new resource request.
If the E-UTRAN failed to modify an E-RAB the E-UTRAN shall keep the E-RAB
configuration as it was configured prior the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST.
The E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message may contain the
\- the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE,
\- the _Secondary RAT Data Usage Request_ IE.
If the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is included in the E-RAB MODIFY
REQUEST, the eNB shall
\- replace the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate by the
received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context;
\- use the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for non-GBR Bearers for the
concerned UE.
If the _UE_ _Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is not contained in the E-RAB
MODIFY REQUEST message, the eNB shall use the previously provided UE Aggregate
Maximum Bit Rate which is stored in the UE context.
The modification of resources according to the values of the _Allocation and
Retention Priority_ IE shall follow the principles described for the E-RAB
Setup procedure.
If the _Transport Information_ IE is included in the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST
message, the eNB shall use the included information as the new S-GW address
and uplink packet destination for the relevant E-RAB as defined in TS 23.401
[11], and it shall ignore the _E-RAB Level QoS Parameters_ and _NAS-PDU_ IEs
for the same E-RAB.
The eNB shall report to the MME, in the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message, the
result for all the requested E-RABs to be modified.
\- A list of E-RABs which are successfully modified shall be included in the
_E-RAB Modify List_ IE.
\- A list of E-RABs which failed to be modified, if any, shall be included in
the _E-RAB Failed to Modify List_ IE.
When the eNB reports unsuccessful modification of an E-RAB, the cause value
should be precise enough to enable the MME to know the reason for an
unsuccessful modification, e.g., "Radio resources not available", "Failure in
the Radio Interface Procedure".
In case of a modification of an E-RAB the EPC must be prepared to receive user
data according to the modified E-RAB profile prior to the E-RAB MODIFY
RESPONSE message.
If the _Secondary RAT Data Usage Request_ IE set to \"requested\" was included
in the E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message, and the eNB supports EN-DC, LAA, LWA or
LWIP and has secondary RAT usage data to report, then the _Secondary RAT Usage
Report List_ IE shall be included in the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message.
The eNB shall, if supported, report in the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message
location information of the UE in the _User Location Information_ IE.
If the _User Location Information_ IE is included in the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE
message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in TS 23.401 [11].
**Interactions with Handover Preparation procedure:**
If a handover becomes necessary during E-RAB modify, the eNB may interrupt the
ongoing E-RAB Modify procedure and initiate the Handover Preparation procedure
as follows:
1\. The eNB shall send the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE message in which the eNB
shall indicate, if necessary
\- all the E-RABs fail with an appropriate cause value, e.g., "S1 intra system
Handover triggered", "S1 inter system Handover triggered" or "X2 Handover
triggered".
2\. The eNB shall trigger the handover procedure.
#### 8.2.2.3 Unsuccessful Operation
The unsuccessful operation is specified in the successful operation section.
#### 8.2.2.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB receives a E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message containing a _E-RAB Level
QoS Parameters_ IE which contains a _QCI_ IE indicating a GBR bearer (as
defined in TS 23.203 [13]) for a E-RAB previously configured as a non-GBR
bearer (as defined in TS 23.203 [13]), and which does not contain the _GBR QoS
Information_ IE, the eNB shall consider the modification of the corresponding
E-RAB as failed.
If the eNB receives an E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message containing several _E-RAB
ID_ IEs (in the _E-RAB to be Modified List_ IE) set to the same value, the eNB
shall report the modification of the corresponding E-RABs as failed in the
E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE with the appropriate cause value, e.g., "Multiple E-RAB
ID instances".
If the eNB receives an E-RAB MODIFY REQUEST message containing some _E-RAB ID_
IEs that eNB does not recognize, the eNB shall report the corresponding
invalid E-RABs as failed in the E-RAB MODIFY RESPONSE with the appropriate
cause value, e.g., "Unknown E-RAB ID".
### 8.2.3 E-RAB Release
#### 8.2.3.1 General
The purpose of the E-RAB Release procedure is to enable the release of already
established E-RABs for a given UE. The procedure uses UE-associated
signalling.
#### 8.2.3.2 Successful Operation
##### 8.2.3.2.1 E-RAB Release -- MME initiated
Figure 8.2.3.2.1-1: E-RAB Release procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message.
The E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message shall contain the information required by
the eNB to release at least one E-RAB in the _E-RAB To Be Released List_ IE.
If a _NAS-PDU_ IE is contained in the message, the eNB shall pass it to the
UE.
Upon reception of the E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message, the eNB shall execute the
release of the requested E-RABs. For each E-RAB to be released the eNB shall
release the corresponding Data Radio Bearer and release the allocated
resources on Uu. The eNB shall pass the value contained in the _E-RAB ID_ IE
received for the E-RAB to the radio interface protocol for each Data Radio
Bearer to be released. The eNB shall release allocated resources on S1 for the
E-RABs requested to be released.
The E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message may contain
\- the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE.
If the _UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is included in the E-RAB RELEASE
COMMAND the eNB shall
\- replace the previously provided UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate by the
received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate in the UE context; the eNB shall use
the received UE Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate for non-GBR Bearers for the
concerned UE.
If the _UE_ _Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate_ IE is not contained in the E-RAB
RELEASE COMMAND message, the eNB shall use the previously provided UE
Aggregate Maximum Bit Rate which is stored in the UE context.
The eNB shall report to the MME, in the E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE message, the
result for all the E-RABs to be released.
\- A list of E-RABs which are released successfully shall be included in the
_E-RAB Release List_ IE.
\- A list of E-RABs which failed to be released, if any, shall be included in
the _E-RAB Failed to Release List_ IE.
The eNB shall be prepared to receive an E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message on an
established UE-associated logical S1-connection containing an _E-RAB Release
List_ IE at any time and shall always reply to it with an E-RAB RELEASE
RESPONSE message.
The eNB shall, if supported, report in the E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE message
location information of the UE in the _User Location Information_ IE.
After sending an E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE message containing an E-RAB ID within
the _E-RAB Release List_ IE, the eNB shall be prepared to receive an E-RAB
SETUP REQUEST message requesting establishment of an E-RAB with this E-RAB ID.
If the _User Location Information_ IE is included in the E-RAB RELEASE
RESPONSE message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in TS
23.401 [11].
If the _Secondary RAT Usage Report List_ IE is included in the E-RAB RELEASE
RESPONSE message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in TS
23.401 [11].
##### 8.2.3.2.2 E-RAB Release Indication -- eNB initiated
Figure 8.2.3.2.2-1: E-RAB Release INDICATION procedure. Successful operation.
The eNB initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message
towards the MME.
The E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message shall contain at least one E-RAB released
at the eNB, in the _E-RAB Released List_ IE.
The eNB shall, if supported, report in the E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message
location information of the UE in the _User Location Information_ IE.
Upon reception of the E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message the MME shall normally
initiate the appropriate release procedure on the core network side for the
E-RABs identified in the E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message.
If the _User Location Information_ IE is included in the E-RAB RELEASE
INDICATION message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in TS
23.401 [11].
If the _Secondary RAT Usage Report List_ IE is included in the E-RAB RELEASE
INDICATION message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in TS
23.401 [11].
**Interaction with UE Context Release Request procedure:**
If the eNB wants to remove all remaining E-RABs, e.g., for user inactivity,
the UE Context Release Request procedure shall be used instead.
#### 8.2.3.3 Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB receives an E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message containing multiple _E-
RAB ID_ IEs (in the _E-RAB To Be Released List_ IE) set to the same value, the
eNB shall initiate the release of one corresponding E-RAB and ignore the
duplication of the instances of the selected corresponding E-RABs.
If the MME receives an E-RAB RELEASE INDICATION message containing multiple
_E-RAB ID_ IEs (in the _E-RAB Released List_ IE) set to the same value, the
MME shall initiate the release of one corresponding E-RAB and ignore the
duplication of the instances of the selected corresponding E-RABs.
If the eNB receives an E-RAB RELEASE COMMAND message containing some _E-RAB
ID_ IEs that eNB does not recognize, the eNB shall report the corresponding
invalid E-RABs as failed in the E-RAB RELEASE RESPONSE message with the
appropriate cause, e.g., "Unknown E-RAB ID".
### 8.2.4 E-RAB Modification Indication
#### 8.2.4.1 General
The purpose of the E-RAB Modification Indication procedure is to enable the
eNB to request modifications of already established E-RABs for a given UE. The
procedure uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.2.4.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.2.4.2-1: E-RAB Modification Indication procedure. Successful
operation.
The eNB initiates the procedure by sending an E-RAB MODIFICATION INDICATION
message to the MME.
The _Transport Layer Address_ IE and _DL GTP TEID_ IE included in the _E-RAB
To Be Modified Item IEs_ IE in the E-RAB MODIFICATION INDICATON message shall
be considered by the MME as the new DL address of the E-RABs. The _Transport
Layer Address_ IE and _DL GTP TEID_ IE included in the _E-RAB Not To Be
Modified Item IEs_ IE in the E-RAB MODIFICATION INDICATION message shall be
considered by the MME as the E-RABs with unchanged DL address
If the _Secondary RAT Usage Report List_ IE is included in the E-RAB
MODIFICATION INDICATION message, the MME shall handle this information as
specified in TS 23.401 [11].
The E-RAB MODIFICATION CONFIRM message shall contain the result for all the
E-RABs that were requested to be modified according to the _E-RAB To Be
Modified Item IEs_ IE of the E-RAB MODIFICATION INDICATION message as follows:
\- A list of E-RABs which are successfully modified shall be included in the
_E-RAB Modify List_ IE.
\- A list of E-RABs which failed to be modified, if any, shall be included in
the _E-RAB Failed to Modify List_ IE.
\- A list of E-RABs which are to be released, if any, shall be included in the
_E-RAB To Be Released List_ IE.
If the _E-RAB Failed to Modify List_ IE is received in the E-RAB MODIFICATION
CONFIRM message, the eNB shall either
\- release all corresponding E-UTRA and E-UTRAN resources for the concerned
E-RAB or
\- keep the previous transport information before sending the E-RAB
MODIFICATION INDICATION message unchanged for the concerned E-RAB.
If the _E-RAB To Be Released List_ IE is received in the E-RAB MODIFICATION
CONFIRM message, the eNB shall release all corresponding E-UTRA and E-UTRAN
resources for the concerned E-RAB.
If the _CSG Membership Info_ IE is included in the E-RAB MODIFICATION
INDICATION message, the MME shall use the information for CSG membership
verification as specified in TS 36.300 [14] and provide the result of the
membership verification in the _CSG Membership Status_ IE contained in the
E-RAB MODIFICATION CONFIRM message.
If _PLMN Identity_ IE is received in the _CSG Membership Info_ IE in the E-RAB
MODIFICATION INDICATION message, the MME shall use it for CSG membership
verification as specified in TS 36.300 [14].
When the MME reports unsuccessful modification of an E-RAB, the cause value
should be precise enough to enable the eNB to know the reason for an
unsuccessful modification.
If the _Tunnel Information for BBF_ IE is received in the E-RAB MODIFICATION
INDICATION message, the MME shall, if supported, use it in the core network as
specified in TS 23.139 [37].
If the _User Location Information_ IE is included in the E-RAB MODIFICATION
INDICATION message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in TS
23.401 [11].
**Interactions with E-RAB Setup procedure or E-RAB Modify procedure:**

### 8.3.2 UE Context Release Request (eNB initiated)
#### 8.3.2.1 General
The purpose of the UE Context Release Request procedure is to enable the eNB
to request the MME to release the UE-associated logical S1-connection due to
E-UTRAN generated reasons, e.g., "TX2~RELOCOverall~ Expiry". The procedure
uses UE-associated signalling.
#### 8.3.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.2.2-1: UE Context Release Request procedure. Successful operation.
The eNB controlling a UE-associated logical S1-connection initiates the
procedure by generating a UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message towards the
affected MME node.
The UE CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message shall indicate the appropriate cause
value, e.g., "User Inactivity", "Radio Connection With UE Lost", "CSG
Subscription Expiry", "CS Fallback triggered", "Redirection towards 1xRTT",
"Inter-RAT Redirection", "UE Not Available for PS Service", "Release due to
pre-emption", for the requested UE-associated logical S1-connection release.
If the _Secondary RAT Usage Report List_ IE is included in the UE CONTEXT
RELEASE REQUEST message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in
TS 23.401 [11].
**Interactions with UE Context Release procedure:**
The UE Context Release procedure should be initiated upon reception of a UE
CONTEXT RELEASE REQUEST message. If the UE was configured with EN-DC radio
resources at the time UE Context Release Request procedure was triggered, and
the PSCell information was available, the eNB shall store the PSCell
information in the UE context.
### 8.3.3 UE Context Release (MME initiated)
#### 8.3.3.1 General
The purpose of the UE Context Release procedure is to enable the MME to order
the release of the UE-associated logical connection due to various reasons,
e.g., completion of a transaction between the UE and the EPC, or completion of
successful handover, or completion of handover cancellation, or release of the
old UE-associated logical S1-connection when two UE-associated logical
S1-connections toward the same UE is detected after the UE has initiated the
establishment of a new UE-associated logical S1-connection, or the UE is no
longer allowed to access the CSG cell (i.e., the UE becomes a non-member of
the currently used CSG cell). The procedure uses UE-associated S1 connection.
#### 8.3.3.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.3.3.2-1: UE Context Release procedure. Successful operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND
message to the eNB.
The UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message shall contain the _UE S1AP ID pair_ IE
if available, otherwise the message shall contain the **_MME UE S1AP ID_ IE**.
The MME provides the _cause_ IE set to "Load Balancing TAU Required" in the UE
CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message sent to the eNB for all load balancing and
offload cases in the MME.
Upon reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMMAND message, the eNB shall
release all related signalling and user data transport resources and reply
with the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message. In case of eNB supporting L-GW
function for LIPA and/or SIPTO\@LN operation, the eNB shall also release any
related tunnel resources. In case of successful handover, the eNB using L-GW
function for SIPTO\@LN operation shall also request using intra-node
signalling the collocated L-GW to release the SIPTO\@LN PDN connection as
defined in TS 23.401 [11].
The eNB shall, if supported, report in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message
location information of the UE in the _User Location Information_ IE. If the
_PSCell Information_ IE is included in the _User Location Information_ IE, it
indicates the UE was configured with EN-DC radio resources at the eNB . Also,
if the _Time Since Secondary Node Release_ IE is included in the UE CONTEXT
RELEASE COMPLETE message, it indicates the time elapsed since EN-DC operation
in the eNB was stopped for the UE.
If the _User Location Information_ IE is included in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE
COMPLETE message, the MME shall handle this information as specified in TS
23.401 [11].
If the _Information on Recommended Cells and eNBs for Paging_ IE is included
in the UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message, the MME shall, if supported, store
it and may use it for subsequent paging.
If the _Cell Identifier and Coverage Enhancement Level_ IE is included in the
UE CONTEXT RELEASE COMPLETE message, the MME shall, if supported, store it and
use it for subsequent paging.
If the _Secondary RAT Usage Report List_ IE is included in the UE CONTEXT
RELEASE COMPLETE message, the MME shall handle this information as specified
in TS 23.401 [11].
#### 8.3.3.3 Abnormal Conditions
If the UE Context Release procedure is not initiated towards the eNB before
the expiry of the timer TS1~RELOCOverall~, the eNB shall request the MME to
release the UE context.
If the UE returns to the eNB before the reception of the UE CONTEXT RELEASE
COMMAND message or the expiry of the timer TS1~RELOCOverall~, the eNB shall
stop the TS1~RELOCOverall~ and continue to serve the UE.

## 8.4 Handover Signalling
### 8.4.1 Handover Preparation
#### 8.4.1.1 General
The purpose of the Handover Preparation procedure is to request the
preparation of resources at the target side via the EPC. There is only one
Handover Preparation procedure ongoing at the same time for a certain UE.
#### 8.4.1.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.4.1.2-1: Handover preparation: successful operation
The source eNB initiates the handover preparation by sending the HANDOVER
REQUIRED message to the serving MME. When the source eNB sends the HANDOVER
REQUIRED message, it shall start the timer TS1~RELOCprep.~ The source eNB
shall indicate the appropriate cause value for the handover in the _Cause_ IE.
The source eNB shall include the _Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE
in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message.
In case of intra-system handover, the information in the _Source to Target
Transparent Container_ IE shall be encoded according to the definition of the
_Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container_ IE. In case of handover to
UTRAN, the information in the _Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE
shall be encoded according to the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent
Container_ IE definition as specified in TS 25.413 [19] and the source eNB
shall include the _UE History Information_ IE in the _Source RNC to Target RNC
Transparent Container_ IE. If the handover is to GERAN A/Gb mode then the
information in the _Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE shall be
encoded according to the definition of the _Source BSS to Target BSS
Transparent Container_ IE as described in TS 48.018 [18]. If the handover is
to NG-RAN, the information in the _Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE
shall be encoded according to the _Source NG-RAN Node to Target NG-RAN Node
Transparent Container_ IE definition as specified in TS 38.413 [44].
When the preparation, including the reservation of resources at the target
side is ready, the MME responds with the HANDOVER COMMAND message to the
source eNB.
If the _Target to Source Transparent Container_ IE has been received by the
MME from the handover target then the transparent container shall be included
in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.
Upon reception of the HANDOVER COMMAND message the source eNB shall stop the
timer TS1~RELOCprep~ and start the timer TS1~RELOCOverall~.
In case of intra-system handover, the information in the _Target to Source
Transparent Container_ IE shall be encoded according to the definition of the
_Target eNB to Source eNB Transparent Container_ IE. In case of inter-system
handover to UTRAN, the information in the _Target to Source Transparent
Container_ IE shall be encoded according to the _Target RNC to Source RNC
Transparent Container_ IE definition as specified in TS 25.413 [19]. In case
of inter-system handover to GERAN A/Gb mode, the information in the _Target to
Source Transparent Container_ IE shall be encoded according to the _Target BSS
to Source BSS Transparent Container_ IE definition as described in TS 48.018
[18]. In case of inter-system handover to NG-RAN, the information in the
_Target to Source Transparent Container_ IE shall be encoded according to the
_Target NG-RAN Node to Source NG-RAN Node Transparent Container_ IE definition
as specified in TS 38.413 [44].
If the _Direct Forwarding Path Availability_ IE is included in the _Target NG-
RAN Node to Source NG-RAN Node Transparent Container_ IE within the HANDOVER
COMMAND message, the source eNB shall, if supported, use it for direct data
forwarding between the source SN and the target NG-RAN node.
If there are any E-RABs that could not be admitted in the target, they shall
be indicated in the _E-RABs to Release List_ IE.
If the _DL forwarding_ IE is included within the _Source eNB to Target eNB
Transparent Container_ IE of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message and it is set to
"DL forwarding proposed", it indicates that the source eNB proposes forwarding
of downlink data.
If the _Security Indication_ IE is included within the _Source eNB to Target
eNB Transparent Container_ IE of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message, it indicates
the security policy stored in the source eNB for the concerned E-RAB, as
specified in TS 33.401 [15].
If the _Security Result_ IE is included within the _Target eNB to Source eNB
Transparent Container_ IE of the HANDOVER COMMAND message, the source eNB
shall take it into account as the status of integrity protection configured by
the target eNB for the concerned E-RAB.
If the MME receives the _Direct Forwarding Path Availability_ IE in the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message indicating that a direct data path is available, it
shall handle it as specified in TS 23.401 [11].
If the _CSG Id_ IE and no _Cell Access Mode_ IE are received in the HANDOVER
REQUIRED message, the MME shall perform the access control according to the
CSG Subscription Data of that UE and, if the access control is successful or
if at least one of the E-RABs has a particular ARP value (see TS 23.401 [11]),
it shall continue the handover and propagate the _CSG Id_ IE to the target
side. If the access control is unsuccessful but at least one of the E-RABs has
a particular ARP value (see TS 23.401 [11]) the MME shall also provide the
_CSG Membership Status_ IE set to "non member" to the target side.
If the _CSG Id_ IE and the _Cell Access Mode_ IE set to "hybrid" are received
in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message, the MME shall provide the membership status
of the UE and the CSG Id to the target side.
The source eNB shall include the _SRVCC HO Indication_ IE in the HANDOVER
REQUIRED message if the SRVCC operation is needed as defined in TS 23.216 [9].
The source eNB shall indicate to the MME in the _SRVCC HO Indication_ IE if
the handover shall be prepared for PS and CS domain or only for CS domain. The
_SRVCC HO Indication_ IE is set according to the target cell capability and UE
capability. In case the target system is GERAN without DTM support or the UE
is without DTM support, the source eNB shall indicate "CS only" in the _SRVCC
HO Indication_ IE and "PS service not available" in _PS Service Not Available_
IE. In case the target system is either GERAN with DTM but without DTM HO
support and the UE is supporting DTM or the target system is UTRAN without PS
HO support, the source eNB shall indicate "CS only" in the _SRVCC HO
Indication_ IE. Otherwise, the source eNB shall indicate "PS and CS" in the
_SRVCC HO Indication_ IE.
In case of inter-system handover from E-UTRAN, the source eNB shall indicate
in the _Target ID_ IE, in case the target system is UTRAN, the Target RNC-ID

is involved), in case the target system is GERAN the Cell Global Identity
(including the Routing Area Code only in case the GERAN PS domain is involved)
of the cell, and in case the target system is NG-RAN the **Target NG-RAN Node
ID** of the NG-RAN node in the target system.
In case of inter-system handover from E-UTRAN to UTRAN, the source eNB shall,
if supported, include the _HO Cause Value_ IE in the _UE History Information_
IE of the HANDOVER REQUIRED message.
In case the SRVCC operation is performed and the _SRVCC HO Indication_ IE
indicates that handover shall be prepared only for CS domain, and if
\- the target system is GERAN, then the source eNB
\- shall encode the information in the _Source to Target Transparent
Container_ IE within the HANDOVER REQUIRED message, according to the
definition of the _Old BSS to New BSS information_ IE as specified in TS
48.008 [23], and
\- shall not include the _Source to Target Transparent Container Secondary_ IE
in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message;
\- the target system is UTRAN, then the source eNB
\- shall encode the information in the _Source to Target Transparent
Container_ IE within the HANDOVER REQUIRED message according to the definition
of the _Source RNC to Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE as specified in TS
25.413 [19],
\- shall include the _UE History Information_ IE in the _Source RNC to Target
RNC Transparent Container_ IE, and
\- shall not include the _Source to Target Transparent Container Secondary_ IE
in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message.
In case the SRVCC operation is performed, the _SRVCC HO Indication_ IE in the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message indicates that handover shall be prepared for PS and
CS domain, and if

\- shall encode the information in the _Source to Target Transparent
Container_ IE within the HANDOVER REQUIRED message according to the definition
of the _Source BSS to Target BSS Transparent Container_ IE as described in TS
48.018 [18],and
\- shall include the _Source to Target Transparent Container_ _Secondary_ IE
in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message and encode information in it according to the
definition of the _Old BSS to New BSS information_ IE as specified in TS
48.008 [23];
\- the target system is UTRAN, then the source eNB
\- shall encode the information in the _Source to Target Transparent
Container_ IE within the HANDOVER REQUIRED message according to the definition
of the _Source_ RNC to _Target RNC Transparent Container_ IE as specified in
TS 25.413 [19],
\- shall include the _UE History Information_ IE in the _Source RNC to Target
RNC Transparent Container_ IE, and
\- shall not include the _Source to Target Transparent Container Secondary_ IE
in the HANDOVER REQUIRED message.
In case the SRVCC operation is performed, the _SRVCC HO Indication_ IE in the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message indicates that handover shall be prepared only for
CS domain, and if
\- the target system is GERAN, then the MME
\- shall encode the information in the _Target to Source Transparent
Container_ IE within the HANDOVER COMMAND message according to the definition
of the _Layer 3 Information_ IE as specified in TS 48.008 [23], and
\- shall not include the _Target to Source Transparent Container Secondary_ IE
in the HANDOVER COMMAND message;
\- the target system is UTRAN, then the MME

of the _Target RNC to Source RNC Transparent Container_ IE as specified in TS
25.413 [19], and
\- shall not include the _Target to Source Transparent Container Secondary_ IE
in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.
In case the SRVCC operation is performed, the _SRVCC HO Indication_ IE in the
HANDOVER REQUIRED message indicates that handover shall be prepared for PS and
CS domain,
\- the target system is GERAN with DTM HO support, and if
\- the Handover Preparation procedure has succeeded in the CS and PS domain,
then the MME
\- shall encode the information in the _Target to Source Transparent
Container_ IE within the HANDOVER COMMAND message according to the definition
of the _Layer 3 Information_ IE as specified in TS 48.008 [23], and
\- shall include the _Target to Source Transparent Container_ _Secondary_ IE
in the HANDOVER COMMAND message and encode information in it according to the
definition of the _Target BSS to Source BSS Transparent Container_ IE as
specified in TS 48.018 [18];
\- the Handover Preparation procedure has succeeded in the CS domain only,
then the MME
\- shall encode the information in the _Target to Source Transparent
Container_ IE within the HANDOVER COMMAND message according to the definition
of the _Layer 3 Information_ IE as specified in TS 48.008 [23], and
\- shall not include the _Target to Source Transparent Container Secondary_ IE
in the HANDOVER COMMAND message;

in the HANDOVER COMMAND message.
If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the _DL GTP-TEID_ IE and the _DL
Transport Layer Address_ IE for a given bearer in the **_E-RABs Subject to
Forwarding List_** _IE,_ then the source eNB shall consider that the
forwarding of downlink data for this given bearer is possible.
If the HANDOVER COMMAND message contains the _UL GTP-TEID_ IE and the _UL
Transport Layer Address_ IE for a given bearer in the **_E-RABs Subject to
Forwarding List_** _IE,_ then it means the target eNB has requested the
forwarding of uplink data for this given bearer.
If the _DAPS Request Information_ IE is included for an E-RAB in the _Source
eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container_ IE within the HANDOVER REQUIRED
message, it indicates that the request concerns a DAPS Handover for that
E-RAB, as described in TS 36.300 [14].
If the _Direct Forwarding Path Availability_ IE is included in the _Target eNB
to Source eNB Transparent Container_ IE, the source eNB shall, if supported,
use it for direct data forwarding between the source SN and the target eNB as
specified in TS 37.340 [32].
**Interactions with E-RAB Management procedures:**
If, after a HANDOVER REQUIRED message is sent and before the Handover
Preparation procedure is terminated, the source eNB receives an MME initiated
E-RAB Management procedure on the same UE associated signalling connection,
the source eNB shall either:
1\. cancel the Handover Preparation procedure by executing the Handover Cancel
procedure with an appropriate cause value. After successful completion of the
Handover Cancel procedure, the source eNB shall continue the MME initiated
E-RAB Management procedure
or
2\. terminate the MME initiated E-RAB Management procedure by sending the
appropriate response message with an appropriate cause value, e.g., "S1 intra
system Handover Triggered", "S1 inter system Handover Triggered" to the MME
and then the source eNB shall continue with the handover procedure.
**Interaction with Handover Cancel procedures:**
If the _Security Result_ IE is not included in the _Target eNB to Source eNB
Transparent Container_ IE of the HANDOVER COMMAND message, and the _Security
Indication_ IE in the _Source eNB to Target eNB Transparent Container_ IE
indicated that some of the E-RABs required User Plane Integrity Protection,
the source eNB shall initiate the Handover Cancel procedure. The source eNB
may reattempt the handover but only for the E-RABs that do not require User
Plane Integrity Protection.
#### 8.4.1.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.4.1.3-1: Handover preparation: unsuccessful operation
If the EPC or the target system is not able to accept any of the bearers or a
failure occurs during the Handover Preparation, the MME sends the HANDOVER
PREPARATION FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value to the source eNB.
If the _CSG Id_ IE and no _Cell Access Mode_ IE are received in the HANDOVER
REQUIRED message and the access control is unsuccessful and none of the E-RABs
has a particular ARP value (see TS 23.401 [11]) the MME shall send the
HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message with an appropriate cause value to the
source eNB, except when one of the E-RABs has a particular ARP value (see TS
23.401 [11]). Upon reception, the source eNB may decide to prevent handover
for that UE towards CSG (Closed Access Mode) cells with corresponding CSG Id.
**Interaction with Handover Cancel procedure:**
If there is no response from the EPC to the HANDOVER REQUIRED message before
timer TS1~RELOCprep~ expires in the source eNB, the source eNB should cancel
the Handover Preparation procedure by initiating the Handover Cancel procedure
with the appropriate value for the _Cause_ IE. The source eNB shall ignore any
HANDOVER COMMAND message or HANDOVER PREPARATION FAILURE message received
after the initiation of the Handover Cancel procedure.
#### 8.4.1.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB receives at least one E-RAB ID included in the **_E-RABs Subject to
Forwarding List_** _IE without at least one valid associated tunnel address
pair (in either UL or DL), then the eNB shall consider it as a logical error
and act as described in subclause 10.4. A GTP tunnel address pair is
considered valid if both the GTP-TEID IE and the Transport Layer Address IE
are present._
### 8.4.2 Handover Resource Allocation
#### 8.4.2.1 General
The purpose of the Handover Resource Allocation procedure is to reserve
resources at the target eNB for the handover of a UE.
#### 8.4.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.4.2.2-1: Handover resource allocation: successful operation
The MME initiates the procedure by sending the HANDOVER REQUEST message to the
target eNB. The HANDOVER REQUEST message may contain the _Handover Restriction
List_ IE, which contains roaming or access restrictions.
If the _Handover Restriction List_ IE is contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST
message, the target eNB shall store this information in the UE context. This
information shall however not be considered whenever one of the handed over
E-RABs has a particular ARP value (TS 23.401 [11]).
The target eNB shall use the information in _Handover Restriction List_ IE if
present in the HANDOVER REQUEST message to
\- determine a target for subsequent mobility action for which the eNB
provides information about the target of the mobility action towards the UE;
\- select a proper SCG during dual connectivity operation.
If the _Handover Restriction List_ IE is not contained in the HANDOVER REQUEST
message, the target eNB shall consider that no roaming and no access
restriction apply to the UE.
Upon reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the eNB shall store the
received _UE Security Capabilities_ IE in the UE context and use it to prepare
the configuration of the AS security relation with the UE.
If the _SRVCC Operation Possible_ IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST
message, the target eNB shall store the content of the received _SRVCC
Operation Possible_ IE in the UE context and, if supported, use it as defined
in TS 23.216 [9].
Upon reception of the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the eNB shall store the
received _Security Context_ IE in the UE context and the eNB shall use it to
derive the security configuration as specified in TS 33.401 [15].
If the _Trace Activation_ IE is included in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the
target eNB shall if supported, initiate the requested trace function as
described in TS 32.422 [10]. In particular, the eNB shall, if supported:
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE does not include the _MDT Configuration_ IE,
initiate the requested trace session as described in TS 32.422 [10];
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _MDT Activation_ IE, within the
_MDT Configuration_ IE, set to "Immediate MDT and Trace", initiate the
requested trace session and MDT session as described in TS 32.422 [10];
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _MDT Activation_ IE, within the
_MDT Configuration_ IE, set to "Immediate MDT Only", "Logged MDT only" or
"Logged MBSFN MDT", initiate the requested MDT session as described in TS
32.422 [10] and the target eNB shall ignore _Interfaces To Trace_ IE, and
_Trace Depth_ IE.
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _MDT Location Information_ IE,
within the _MDT Configuration_ IE, store this information and take it into
account in the requested MDT session.
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _Signalling based MDT PLMN List_
IE, within the _MDT Configuration_ IE, the eNB may use it to propagate the MDT
Configuration as described in TS 37.320 [31].
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _MBSFN-ResultToLog_ IE, within
the _MDT Configuration_ IE, take it into account for MDT Configuration as
described in TS 37.320 [31].
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _MBSFN-AreaId_ IE in the _MBSFN-
ResultToLog_ IE, within the _MDT Configuration_ IE, take it into account for
MDT Configuration as described in TS 37.320 [31].
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _UE Application layer measurement
configuration_ IE, initiate the requested trace session and QoE Measurement
Collection function as described in TS 36.300 [14].
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _Bluetooth Measurement
Configuration_ IE, within the _MDT Configuration_ IE, take it into account for
MDT Configuration as described in TS 37.320 [31].
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _WLAN Measurement Configuration_
IE, within the _MDT Configuration_ IE, take it into account for MDT
Configuration as described in TS 37.320 [31].
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _MDT Configuration NR_ IE, store
and forward the _MDT Configuration NR_ IE to the SgNB, if the eNB has
configured EN-DC for the UE.
\- if the _Trace Activation_ IE includes the _Sensor Measurement
Configuration_ IE within the _MDT Configuration_ IE, take it into account for
MDT Configuration as described in TS 37.320 [31].
If the _CSG Id_ IE is received in the HANDOVER REQUEST message, the eNB shall
compare the received value with the CSG Id broadcast by the target cell.
If the _CSG Membership Status_ IE is received in the HANDOVER REQUEST message
and the _CSG Membership Status_ is set to "member", the eNB may provide the
QoS to the UE as for member provided that the CSG Id received in the HANDOVER
REQUEST messages corresponds to the CSG Id broadcast by the target cell.
If the _CSG Membership Status_ IE and the _CSG Id_ IE are received in the
HANDOVER REQUEST message and the CSG Id does not correspond to the CSG Id
broadcast by the target cell, the eNB may provide the QoS to the UE as for a
non member and shall send back in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message the
actual CSG Id broadcast by the target cell.
If the target cell is CSG cell or hybrid cell, the target eNB shall include
the _CSG ID_ IE in the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE message.
If the target eNB receives the _CSG Id_ IE and the _CSG Membership Status_ IE
is set to "non member" in the HANDOVER REQUEST message and the target cell is
a closed cell and at least one of the E-RABs has a particular ARP value (see
TS 23.401 [11]), the eNB shall send back the HANDOVER REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGE

### 8.7.1 Reset
#### 8.7.1.1 General
The purpose of the Reset procedure is to initialise or re-initialise the
E-UTRAN, or part of E-UTRAN S1AP UE-related contexts, in the event of a
failure in the EPC or vice versa. This procedure does not affect the
application level configuration data exchanged during, e.g., the S1 Setup
procedure.
The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
#### 8.7.1.2 Successful Operation
##### 8.7.1.2.1 Reset Procedure Initiated from the MME
Figure 8.7.1.2.1-1: Reset procedure initiated from the MME. Successful
operation.
In the event of a failure at the MME, which has resulted in the loss of some
or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the
eNB.
At reception of the RESET message, the eNB shall release all allocated
resources on S1 and Uu related to the UE association(s) indicated explicitly
or implicitly in the RESET message and remove the indicated UE contexts
including S1AP ID.
After the eNB has released all assigned S1 resources and the UE S1AP IDs for
all indicated UE associations which can be used for new UE-associated logical
S1-connections over the S1 interface, the eNB shall respond with the RESET
ACKNOWLEDGE message. The eNB does not need to wait for the release of radio
resources to be completed before returning the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
_If the RESET message contains the UE-associated logical S1-connection list
IE, then:_
_\- The eNB shall use the MME UE S1AP ID_ IE and/or the _eNB UE S1AP ID_ IE to
explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.
\- The eNB shall include in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message, for each UE
association to be reset, the _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IE in
the _UE-associated logical S1-connection list_ IE. The _UE-associated logical
S1-connection Item_ IEs shall be in the same order as received in the RESET
message and shall include also unknown UE-associated logical S1-connections.
Empty _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IEs, received in the RESET
message, may be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
\- If the _MME UE S1AP ID_ IE is included in the _UE-associated logical
S1-connection Item_ IE for a UE association, the eNB shall include the _MME UE
S1AP ID_ IE in the corresponding _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IE
in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
\- If the **_eNB UE S1AP ID_** IE is included in the _UE-associated logical
S1-connection Item_ IE for a UE association, the eNB shall include the _eNB UE
S1AP ID_ IE in the corresponding _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IE
in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
**Interactions with other procedures:**
If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except for
another Reset procedure) on the same S1 interface related to a UE association,
indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message, shall be aborted.
##### 8.7.1.2.2 Reset Procedure Initiated from the E-UTRAN
Figure 8.7.1.2.2-1: Reset procedure initiated from the E-UTRAN. Successful
operation.
In the event of a failure at the eNB, which has resulted in the loss of some
or all transaction reference information, a RESET message shall be sent to the
MME.
At reception of the RESET message the MME shall release all allocated
resources on S1 related to the UE association(s) indicated explicitly or
implicitly in the RESET message and remove the S1AP ID for the indicated UE
associations.
After the MME has released all assigned S1 resources and the UE S1AP IDs for
all indicated UE associations which can be used for new UE-associated logical
S1-connections over the S1 interface, the MME shall respond with the RESET
ACKNOWLEDGE message.
_If the RESET message contains the UE-associated logical S1-connection list
IE, then:_
_\- The MME shall use the MME UE S1AP ID_ IE and/or the _eNB UE S1AP ID_ IE to
explicitly identify the UE association(s) to be reset.
\- The MME shall include in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message, for each UE
association to be reset, the _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IE in
the _UE-associated logical S1-connection list_ IE. The _UE-associated logical
S1-connection Item_ IEs shall be in the same order as received in the RESET
message and shall include also unknown UE-associated logical S1-connections.
Empty _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IEs, received in the RESET
message, may be omitted in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
\- If the _MME UE S1AP ID_ IE is included in the _UE-associated logical
S1-connection Item_ IE for a UE association, the MME shall include the _MME UE
S1AP ID_ IE in the corresponding _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IE
in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
\- If the **_eNB UE S1AP ID_** IE is included in a _UE-associated logical
S1-connection Item_ IE for a UE association, the MME shall include the _eNB UE
S1AP ID_ IE in the corresponding _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IE
in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message.
**Interactions with other procedures:**
If the RESET message is received, any other ongoing procedure (except for
another Reset procedure) on the same S1 interface related to a UE association,
indicated explicitly or implicitly in the RESET message, shall be aborted.
#### 8.7.1.3 Abnormal Conditions
##### 8.7.1.3.1 Abnormal Condition at the EPC
If the RESET message includes the _UE-associated logical S1-connection list
IE, but_ neither the _MME UE S1AP ID_ IE nor the _eNB UE S1AP ID_ IE is
present for a _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IE, then the MME
shall ignore the _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IE. The MME may
return the empty _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IE in the _UE-
associated logical S1-connection list IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message._
##### 8.7.1.3.2 Abnormal Condition at the E-UTRAN
If the RESET message includes the _UE-associated logical S1-connection list
IE, but_ neither the _MME UE S1AP ID_ IE nor the _eNB UE S1AP ID_ IE is
present for a _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IE, then the eNB
shall ignore the _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IE. The eNB may
return the empty _UE-associated logical S1-connection Item_ IE in the _UE-
associated logical S1-connection list IE in the RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message._
##### 8.7.1.3.3 Crossing of Reset Messages
If a Reset procedure is ongoing in the eNB and the eNB receives a RESET
message from the peer entity on the same S1 interface related to one or
several UE associations previously requested to be reset, indicated explicitly
or implicitly in the received RESET message, the eNB shall respond with the
RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in 8.7.1.2.1.
If a Reset procedure is ongoing in the MME and the MME receives a RESET
message from the peer entity on the same S1 interface related to one or
several UE associations previously requested to be reset, indicated explicitly
or implicitly in the received RESET message, the MME shall respond with the
RESET ACKNOWLEDGE message as described in 8.7.1.2.2.
### 8.7.2 Error Indication
#### 8.7.2.1 General
The Error Indication procedure is initiated by a node in order to report
detected errors in one incoming message, provided they cannot be reported by
an appropriate failure message.
If the error situation arises due to reception of a message utilising UE
associated signalling, then the Error Indication procedure uses UE associated
signalling. Otherwise the procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
#### 8.7.2.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.7.2.2-1: Error Indication procedure, MME originated. Successful
operation.
Figure 8.7.2.2-2: Error Indication procedure, eNB originated. Successful
operation.
When the conditions defined in clause 10 are fulfilled, the Error Indication
procedure is initiated by an ERROR INDICATION message sent from the receiving
node.
The ERROR INDICATION message shall contain at least either the _Cause_ IE or
the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE. In case the Error Indication procedure is
triggered by utilising UE associated signalling the _MME UE S1AP ID_ IE and
the _eNB UE S1AP ID_ IE shall be included in the ERROR INDICATION message. If
one or both of _MME UE S1AP ID_ IE and the _eNB UE S1AP ID_ IE are not
correct, the cause shall be set to appropriate value, e.g., "Unknown or
already allocated MME UE S1AP ID", "Unknown or already allocated eNB UE S1AP
ID" or "Unknown or inconsistent pair of UE S1AP ID".
#### 8.7.2.3 Abnormal Conditions
Not applicable.
### 8.7.3 S1 Setup
#### 8.7.3.1 General
The purpose of the S1 Setup procedure is to exchange application level data
needed for the eNB and the MME to correctly interoperate on the S1 interface.
This procedure shall be the first S1AP procedure triggered after the TNL
association has become operational. The procedure uses non-UE associated
signalling.
This procedure erases any existing application level configuration data in the
two nodes and replaces it by the one received and clears MME overload state
information at the eNB. If the eNB and MME do not agree on retaining the UE
Contexts this procedure also re-initialises the E-UTRAN S1AP UE-related
contexts (if any) and erases all related signalling connections in the two
nodes like a Reset procedure would do. If the eNB initiating the S1 Setup
procedure supports a CSG cell, the procedure shall report the CSG ID(s) of the
supported CSGs.
#### 8.7.3.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.7.3.2-1: S1 Setup procedure: Successful Operation.
The eNB initiates the procedure by sending a S1 SETUP REQUEST message
including the appropriate data to the MME. The MME responds with a S1 SETUP
RESPONSE message including the appropriate data.
The exchanged data shall be stored in respective node and used for the
duration of the TNL association. When this procedure is finished, the S1
interface is operational and other S1 messages can be exchanged.
If the eNB initiating the S1 SETUP procedure supports one (or more) CSG
cell(s), the S1 SETUP REQUEST message shall contain the CSG ID(s) of the
supported CSG(s).
If the S1 SETUP REQUEST message contains the _eNB Name_ IE the MME may use
this IE as a human readable name of the eNB.
If the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the _MME Name_ IE the eNB may use
this IE as a human readable name of the MME.
If the _MME Relay Support Indicator_ IE is included in the S1 SETUP RESPONSE
message, the eNB shall consider this information when selecting an appropriate
MME for the Relay Node.
If the _UE Retention Information_ IE set to "ues-retained" was included in the
S1 SETUP REQUEST message, then the MME may accept the proposal to retain the
existing UE related contexts and signalling connections by including the _UE
Retention Information_ IE set to "ues-retained" in the S1 SETUP RESPONSE
message.
If the _NB-IoT Default Paging DRX_ IE is included in the S1 SETUP REQUEST
message, the MME will take it into account as specified in TS 36.300 [14].
If the _Connected en-gNB List_ IE is included in the S1 SETUP REQUEST message,
the MME shall take it into account as specified in TS 36.300 [14].
If the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the _ServedDCNs_ IE then the eNB
shall, if supported, use it as defined in TS 23.401 [11].
If the S1 SETUP RESPONSE message contains the _GUMMEI Type_ IE then the eNB
shall, if supported, use it to route the UE to the correct MME as specified in
TS 23.401 [11].
If the MME supports IAB, the MME shall include the _IAB Supported_ IE in the
S1 SETUP RESPONSE message. If the _IAB Supported_ IE is included in the S1
SETUP RESPONSE message, the eNB shall, if supported, store this information
and use it for further MME selection for the IAB-MT.
#### 8.7.3.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.7.3.3-1: S1 Setup procedure: Unsuccessful Operation.
If the MME cannot accept the setup, it should respond with a S1 SETUP FAILURE
and appropriate cause value.
If the S1 SETUP FAILURE message includes the _Time To Wait_ IE, the eNB shall
wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the S1 setup towards
the same MME.
#### 8.7.3.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB initiates the procedure by sending a S1 SETUP REQUEST message
including the _PLMN Identity_ IEs and none of the PLMNs provided by the eNB is
identified by the MME, then the MME shall reject the eNB S1 Setup Request
procedure with the appropriate cause value, e.g., "Unknown PLMN".
If none of the RATs indicated by the eNB in the S1 SETUP REQUEST message is
supported by the MME, then the MME shall fail the S1 Setup procedure with an
appropriate cause value.
### 8.7.4 eNB Configuration Update
#### 8.7.4.1 General
The purpose of the eNB Configuration Update procedure is to update application
level configuration data needed for the eNB and the MME to interoperate
correctly on the S1 interface. This procedure does not affect existing UE-
related contexts, if any.
#### 8.7.4.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.7.4.2-1: ENB Configuration Update procedure: Successful Operation.
The eNB initiates the procedure by sending an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message
to the MME including an appropriate set of updated configuration data that it
has just taken into operational use. The MME responds with ENB CONFIGURATION
UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to acknowledge that it successfully updated the
configuration data. If information element(s) is/are not included in the ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the MME shall interpret that the corresponding
configuration data is/are not changed and shall continue to operate the S1
with the existing related configuration data.
If the supported TA(s) is/are to be updated, the whole list of supported TAs,
including those that are not to be updated, shall be included in the
_Supported TAs_ IE. The MME shall overwrite the whole list of TAs.
If the supported CSG ID(s) is/are to be updated, the whole list of supported
CSG IDs, including those that are not to be updated, shall be included in the
_CSG Id List_ IE. The MME shall overwrite the whole list of CSG Ids.
If the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message contains the _eNB Name_ IE, the MME
may use this IE as a human readable name of the eNB.
If the _Default Paging DRX_ IE is included, the MME shall overwrite any
previously stored default paging DRX value for the eNB.
If the _NB-IoT Default Paging DRX_ IE is included in the ENB CONFIGURATION
UPDATE message, the MME shall overwrite any previously stored NB-IoT default
paging DRX value for the eNB.
If the _Connected en-gNB to be Added List_ IE is included in the ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the MME shall replace, if applicable, any
previously received information for the concerned en-gNBs and take it into
account as specified in TS 36.300 [14].
If the _Connected en-gNB to be Removed List_ IE is included in the ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the MME shall remove any stored information for
the concerned en-gNBs.
The updated configuration data shall be stored in both the eNB and the MME and
used for the duration of the TNL association or until any further update is
triggered by the eNB.
The eNB may initiate a further eNB Configuration Update procedure only after a
previous eNB Configuration Update procedure has been completed.
#### 8.7.4.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.7.4.3-1: ENB Configuration Update procedure: Unsuccessful Operation.
If the MME cannot accept the update, it shall respond with an ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.
If the ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message includes the _Time To Wait_
IE, the eNB shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the
ENB Configuration Update procedure towards the same MME. Both nodes shall
continue to operate the S1 with their respective configuration data.
#### 8.7.4.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB after initiating eNB Configuration Update procedure receives
neither an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKOWLEDGE nor an ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE
FAILURE message, the eNB may reinitiate a further eNB Configuration Update
procedure towards the same MME, provided that the content of the new ENB
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is identical to the content of the previously
unacknowledged ENB CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.
### 8.7.5 MME Configuration Update
#### 8.7.5.1 General
The purpose of the MME Configuration Update procedure is to update application
level configuration data needed for the eNB and MME to interoperate correctly
on the S1 interface. This procedure does not affect existing UE-related
contexts, if any.
#### 8.7.5.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.7.5.2-1: MME Configuration Update procedure: Successful Operation.
The MME initiates the procedure by sending an MME CONFIGURATION UPDATE message
including the appropriate updated configuration data to the eNB. The eNB
responds with an MME CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKNOWLEDGE message to acknowledge
that it successfully updated the configuration data. If information element(s)
is/are not included in the MME CONFIGURATION UPDATE message, the eNB shall
interpret that the corresponding configuration data is not changed and shall
continue to operate the S1 with the existing related configuration data.
If the served PLMNs is/are to be updated, the eNB shall overwrite the whole
list of PLMNs.
If the MME CONFIGURATION UPDATE message contains the _MME Name_ IE, the eNB
may use this IE as a human readable name of the MME.
The updated configuration data shall be stored in the respective node and used
for the duration of the TNL association or until any further update is
performed from the MME.
The MME may initiate a further MME Configuration Update procedure only after a
previous MME Configuration Update procedure has been completed.
If the MME CONFIGURATION UPDATE message contains the _ServedDCNs_ IE then the
eNB shall, if supported, use it as defined in TS 23.401 [11].
If the MME CONFIGURATION UPDATE message contains the _GUMMEI Type_ IE then the
eNB shall, if supported, use it to route the UE to the correct MME as
specified in TS 23.401 [11].
#### 8.7.5.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Figure 8.7.5.3-1: MME Configuration Update: Unsuccessful Operation.
If the eNB cannot accept the update, it shall respond with an MME
CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message and appropriate cause value.
If the MME CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message includes the _Time To Wait_ IE
the MME shall wait at least for the indicated time before reinitiating the MME
Configuration Update procedure towards the same eNB. Both nodes shall continue
to operate the S1 with the existing configuration data.
#### 8.7.5.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the MME neither receives an MME CONFIGURATION UPDATE ACKOWLEDGE nor an MME
CONFIGURATION UPDATE FAILURE message, the MME may reinitiate MME Configuration
Update procedure towards the same eNB provided that the content of the new MME
CONFIGURATION UPDATE message is identical to the content of the previously
unacknowledged MME CONFIGURATION UPDATE message.
### 8.7.6 Overload Start
#### 8.7.6.1 General
The purpose of the Overload Start procedure is to inform an eNB to reduce the
signalling load towards the concerned MME.
The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
#### 8.7.6.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.7.6.2-1: Overload Start procedure
The eNB receiving the OVERLOAD START message shall assume the MME from which
it receives the message as being in an overloaded state.
If the _Overload Action_ IE in the _Overload Response_ IE within the OVERLOAD
START message is set to
\- \"reject RRC connection establishments for non-emergency mobile originated
data transfer\" (i.e., reject traffic corresponding to RRC cause \"mo-data\",
\"mo-VoiceCall\" and \"delayTolerantAccess\" in TS 36.331 [16]), or
\- \"reject RRC connection establishments for signalling\" (i.e., reject
traffic corresponding to RRC cause \"mo-data\", \"mo-signalling\", \"mo-
VoiceCall\" and \"delayTolerantAccess\" in TS 36.331 [16]), or
\- \"only permit RRC connection establishments for emergency sessions and
mobile terminated services\" (i.e., only permit traffic corresponding to RRC
cause \"emergency\" and \"mt-Access\" in TS 36.331 [16]), or
\- \"only permit RRC connection establishments for high priority sessions and
mobile terminated services\" (i.e., only permit traffic corresponding to RRC
cause \"highPriorityAccess\" and \"mt-Access\" in TS 36.331 [16]), or
\- \"reject only RRC connection establishment for delay tolerant access\"
(i.e., only reject traffic corresponding to RRC cause \"delayTolerantAccess\"
in TS 36.331 [16]), or
> \- \"not accept RRC connection requests for data transmission from UEs that
> only support Control Plane CIoT EPS Optimisation\" (i.e. not accept traffic
> corresponding to RRC cause \"mo-data\" or \"delayTolerantAccess\" in TS
> 36.331 [16] for those UEs), or
\- \"only permit RRC connection establishments for high priority sessions,
exception reporting and mobile terminated services\" (i.e., only permit
traffic corresponding to RRC cause \"highPriorityAccess\", "mo-ExceptionData"
and \"mt-Access\" in TS 36.331 [16]),
the eNB shall:
\- if the _Traffic Load Reduction Indication_ IE is included in the OVERLOAD
START message and, if supported, reduce the signalling traffic indicated as to
be rejected by the indicated percentage,
\- otherwise ensure that only the signalling traffic not indicated as to be
rejected/not accepted is sent to the MME.
NOTE: When the Overload Action IE is set to \"only permit RRC connection
establishments for emergency sessions and mobile terminated services\",
emergency calls with RRC cause \"highPriorityAccess\" from high priority users
are rejected (see TS 24.301 [24]).
If the _GUMMEI List_ IE is present, the eNB shall, if supported, use this
information to identify to which traffic the above defined rejections shall be
applied.
If an overload action is ongoing and the eNB receives a further OVERLOAD START
message, the eNB shall replace the ongoing overload action with the newly
requested one. If the _GUMMEI List_ IE is present, the eNB replaces applicable
ongoing actions according to TS 36.300 [14], clauses 4.6.2, 4.7.4 and
19.2.2.12.
#### 8.7.6.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
### 8.7.7 Overload Stop
#### 8.7.7.1 General
The purpose of the Overload Stop procedure is to signal to an eNB the MME is
connected to that the overload situation at the MME has ended and normal
operation shall resume.
The procedure uses non-UE associated signalling.
#### 8.7.7.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.7.7.2.-1: Overload Stop procedure
The eNB receiving the OVERLOAD STOP message shall assume that the overload
situation at the MME from which it receives the message has ended and shall
resume normal operation for the applicable traffic towards this MME.
If the _GUMMEI List_ IE is present, the eNB shall, if supported, use this
information to identify which traffic to cease rejecting, and proceed
according to TS 36.300 [14], clauses 4.6.2, 4.7.4 and 19.2.2.12. If no
particular overload action is ongoing for a particular GUMMEI value, the eNB
shall ignore this value.
#### 8.7.7.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable.
## 8.8 S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling Procedures
### 8.8.1 General
The purpose of S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling procedures is to carry CDMA2000
signalling between UE and CDMA2000 RAT over the S1 Interface. This includes
signalling for pre-registration of UE with CDMA2000 HRPD network, signalling
for handover preparation for handover from E-UTRAN to CDMA2000 HRPD/1xRTT and
pre-registration and paging of UE with CDMA2000 1xRTT CS system. The CDMA2000
messages are not interpreted by the eNB, and their content is outside the
scope of this specification, however, additional information may be sent along
with the tunnelled CDMA2000 message to assist the eNB and the MME in the
tunnelling procedure. These procedures use an established UE-associated
logical S1-connection.
The CDMA2000 messages are transported in an IE of the DOWNLINK S1 CDMA2000
TUNNELLING or UPLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING messages.
### 8.8.2 Successful Operations
#### 8.8.2.1 Downlink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling
Figure 8.8.2.1-1: Downlink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling Procedure
If a CDMA2000 message needs to be sent from the MME to a given UE and a UE-
associated logical S1-connection exists for that given UE, the MME should send
a DOWNLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message to the eNB including the CDMA2000
message in the _CDMA2000-PDU_ IE. The eNB forwards the received _CDMA2000-PDU_
IE to the UE along with an indication of the RAT Type associated with the
_CDMA2000-PDU_ IE based on the _CDMA2000 RAT Type_ IE.
If the MME receives handover status information along with the tunnelled
downlink CDMA2000 message, the MME should include the handover status
information in the _CDMA2000 HO Status_ IE in the DOWNLINK S1 CDMA2000
TUNNELLING message.
If the DOWNLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message contains the _E-RABs Subject to
Forwarding List_ IE, it indicates that DL forwarding is available for the
indicated E-RABs towards the tunnel endpoint identified by the _DL GTP-TEID_
IE for those E-RABs.
#### 8.8.2.2 Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling
Figure 8.8.2.2-1: Uplink S1 CDMA2000 Tunnelling Procedure
When the eNB has received from the radio interface a CDMA2000 message to be
forwarded to the MME in which a UE-associated logical S1-connection for a
given UE exists, the eNB shall send the UPLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message
to the MME including the CDMA2000 message in the _CDMA2000-PDU_ IE.
If the MME receives the _CDMA2000 HO Required Indication_ IE set to "true" in
UPLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message, the MME shall send the necessary
handover preparation information to the CDMA2000 target RAT.
If the MME receives any of the _CDMA2000 1xRTT SRVCC Info_ IE, or the
_CDMA2000 1xRTT RAND_ IE in the UPLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message, the MME
shall forward the received information to the CDMA2000 1xRTT RAT.
If the MME receives the _E-UTRAN Round Trip Delay Estimation Info_ IE in the
UPLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message, the MME shall forward the received
information to the target HRPD access. The MME shall forward the received
_CDMA2000 Sector ID_ IE and _CDMA2000-PDU_ IE to the proper destination node
in the CDMA2000 RAT.
**Interactions with E-RAB Management procedures:**
If, after an UPLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message with _CDMA2000 HO Required
Indication_ IE set to "true" is sent before the DOWNLINK S1 CDMA2000
TUNNELLING message with _CDMA2000 HO Status_ IE is received, the source eNB
receives an MME initiated E-RAB Management procedure on the same UE associated
signalling connection, the source eNB shall terminate the MME initiated E-RAB
Management procedure by sending the appropriate response message with an
appropriate cause value, e.g., "S1 inter system Handover Triggered", to the
MME.
### 8.8.3 Unsuccessful Operation
Not applicable
### 8.8.4 Abnormal Conditions
If the eNB receives at least one E-RAB ID included in the _E-RABs Subject to
Forwarding Items_ IE without any associated DL GTP-TEID and DL Transport Layer
Address pair in the DOWNLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message, the eNB shall
consider it as a logical error and act as described in subclause 10.4.
The eNB shall ignore the _UL GTP-TEID_ IE and/or _UL Transport Layer Address_
IE in the _E-RABs Subject to Forwarding Items_ IE, when the IEs are included
in the DOWNLINK S1 CDMA2000 TUNNELLING message.
## 8.9 UE Capability Info Indication
### 8.9.1 General
The purpose of the UE Capability Info Indication procedure is to enable the
eNB to provide to the MME UE capability-related information.
### 8.9.2 Successful Operation
Figure 8.9.2-1: UE Capability Info Indication procedure. Successful operation.
The eNB controlling a UE-associated logical S1-connection initiates the
procedure by sending a UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message to the MME
including the UE capability information. The UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION
message may also include paging specific UE capability information within the
_UE Radio Capability for Paging_ IE. The UE capability information received by
the MME shall replace previously stored corresponding UE capability
information in the MME for the UE, as described in TS 23.401 [11].
If UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message contains the _LTE-M indication_ IE,
the MME shall, if supported, store this information in the UE context and use
it according to TS 23.401 [11].
If the UE indicates the support for UE Application Layer Measurement, the eNB
shall if supported include the UE Application Layer Measurement Capability IE
in the UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message. The MME shall, if supported,
store and use this information when initiating UE Application Layer
Measurement.
If UE CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message contains the _UE Radio Capability --
NR Format_ IE, the MME shall, if supported, use it according to TS 23.401
[11].
If the UE RADIO CAPABILITY INFO INDICATION message includes the _UE Radio
Capability for Paging_ IE and the _UE Radio Capability for Paging \-- NR
Format_ IE, the MME shall, if supported, use it according to TS 23.401 [11].
### 8.9.3 Abnormal Conditions

## 9.2 Information Element Definitions
### 9.2.0 General
Subclause 9.2 presents the S1AP IE definitions in tabular format. The
corresponding ASN.1 definition is presented in subclause 9.3. In case there is
contradiction between the tabular format in subclause 9.2 and the ASN.1
definition, the ASN.1 shall take precedence, except for the definition of
conditions for the presence of conditional elements, where the tabular format
shall take precedence.
The messages have been defined in accordance to the guidelines specified in TR
25.921 [40].
When specifying information elements which are to be represented by
bitstrings, if not otherwise specifically stated in the semantics description
of the concerned IE or elsewhere, the following principle applies with regards
to the ordering of bits:
\- The first bit (leftmost bit) contains the most significant bit (MSB);
\- The last bit (rightmost bit) contains the least significant bit (LSB);
\- When importing bitstrings from other specifications, the first bit of the
bitstring contains the first bit of the concerned information;
### 9.2.1 Radio Network Layer Related IEs
#### 9.2.1.1 Message Type

The meaning of the different cause values is described in the following table.
In general, "not supported" cause values indicate that the related capability
is missing. On the other hand, "not available" cause values indicate that the
related capability is present, but insufficient resources were available to
perform the requested action.

## 9.3 Message and Information Element Abstract Syntax (with ASN.1)
### 9.3.0 General
S1AP ASN.1 definition conforms to ITU-T Rec. X.691 [4], ITU-T Rec. X.680 [5]
and ITU-T Rec. X.681 [6].
The ASN.1 definition specifies the structure and content of S1AP messages.
S1AP messages can contain any IEs specified in the object set definitions for
that message without the order or number of occurrence being restricted by
ASN.1. However, for this version of the standard, a sending entity shall
construct a S1AP message according to the PDU definitions module and with the
following additional rules:
\- IEs shall be ordered (in an IE container) in the order they appear in
object set definitions.
\- Object set definitions specify how many times IEs may appear. An IE shall
appear exactly once if the presence field in an object has value
\"mandatory\". An IE may appear at most once if the presence field in an
object has value \"optional\" or \"conditional\". If in a tabular format there
is multiplicity specified for an IE (i.e., an IE list) then in the
corresponding ASN.1 definition the list definition is separated into two
parts. The first part defines an IE container list where the list elements
reside. The second part defines list elements. The IE container list appears
as an IE of its own. For this version of the standard an IE container list may
contain only one kind of list elements.
NOTE: In the above "IE" means an IE in the object set with an explicit ID. If
one IE needs to appear more than once in one object set, then the different
occurrences will have different IE IDs.
If a S1AP message that is not constructed as defined above is received, this
shall be considered as Abstract Syntax Error, and the message shall be handled
as defined for Abstract Syntax Error in subclause 10.3.6.
Subclause 9.3 presents the Abstract Syntax of S1AP protocol with ASN.1. In
case there is contradiction between the ASN.1 definition in this subclause and
the tabular format in subclause 9.1 and 9.2, the ASN.1 shall take precedence,
except for the definition of conditions for the presence of conditional
elements, where the tabular format shall take precedence.
### 9.3.1 Usage of private message mechanism for non-standard use
The private message mechanism for non-standard use may be used:
\- for special operator- (and/or vendor) specific features considered not to
be part of the basic functionality, i.e., the functionality required for a
complete and high-quality specification in order to guarantee multivendor
interoperability;
\- by vendors for research purposes, e.g., to implement and evaluate new
algorithms/features before such features are proposed for standardisation.
The private message mechanism shall not be used for basic functionality. Such
functionality shall be standardised.

# 10 Handling of Unknown, Unforeseen and Erroneous Protocol Data
## 10.1 General
Protocol Error cases can be divided into three classes:
\- Transfer Syntax Error.
\- Abstract Syntax Error.
\- Logical Error.
Protocol errors can occur in the following functions within a receiving node:
Figure 10.1-1: Protocol Errors in S1AP.
The information stated in subclauses 10.2, 10.3 and 10.4, to be included in
the message used when reporting an error, is what at minimum shall be
included. Other optional information elements within the message may also be
included, if available. This is also valid for the case when the reporting is
done with a response message. The latter is an exception to what is stated in
subclause 4.1.
## 10.2 Transfer Syntax Error
A Transfer Syntax Error occurs when the receiver is not able to decode the
received physical message. Transfer syntax errors are always detected in the
process of ASN.1 decoding. If a Transfer Syntax Error occurs, the receiver
should initiate Error Indication procedure with appropriate cause value for
the Transfer Syntax protocol error.
Examples for Transfer Syntax Errors are:
\- Violation of value ranges in ASN.1 definition of messages. E.g., if an IE
has a defined value range of 0 to 10 (ASN.1: INTEGER (0..10)), and 12 will be
received, then this will be treated as a transfer syntax error.
\- Violation in list element constraints. E.g., if a list is defined as
containing 1 to 10 elements, and 12 elements will be received, than this case
will be handled as a transfer syntax error.
\- Missing mandatory elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the
originator of the message).
\- Wrong order of elements in ASN.1 SEQUENCE definitions (as sent by the
originator of the message).
## 10.3 Abstract Syntax Error
### 10.3.1 General
An Abstract Syntax Error occurs when the receiving functional S1AP entity:
1\. receives IEs or IE groups that cannot be understood (unknown IE ID);
2\. receives IEs for which the logical range is violated (e.g., ASN.1
definition: 0 to 15, the logical range is 0 to 10, while values 11 to 15 are
undefined), and 12 will be received; this case will be handled as an abstract
syntax error using criticality information sent by the originator of the
message);
3\. does not receive IEs or IE groups but according to the specified presence
of the concerning object, the IEs or IE groups should have been present in the
received message.
4\. receives IEs or IE groups that are defined to be part of that message in
wrong order or with too many occurrences of the same IE or IE group;
5\. receives IEs or IE groups but according to the conditional presence of the
concerning object and the specified condition, the IEs or IE groups should not
have been present in the received message.
6\. receives IEs or IE groups for a functionality that is not supported.
Cases 1, 2 and 6 (not comprehended IE/IE group) are handled based on received
Criticality information. Case 3 (missing IE/IE group) is handled based on
Criticality information and Presence information for the missing IE/IE group
specified in the version of the specification used by the receiver. Case 4
(IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences) and Case 5
(erroneously present conditional IEs or IE groups) result in rejecting the
procedure.
If an Abstract Syntax Error occurs, the receiver shall read the remaining
message and shall then for each detected Abstract Syntax Error that belong to
cases 1-3 and 6 act according to the Criticality Information and Presence
Information for the IE/IE group due to which Abstract Syntax Error occurred in
accordance with subclauses 10.3.4 and 10.3.5. The handling of cases 4 and 5 is
specified in subclause 10.3.6.
### 10.3.2 Criticality Information
In the S1AP messages there is criticality information set for individual IEs
and/or IE groups. This criticality information instructs the receiver how to
act when receiving an IE or an IE group that is not comprehended, i.e., the
entire item (IE or IE group) which is not (fully or partially) comprehended
shall be treated in accordance with its own criticality information as
specified in subclause 10.3.4.
In addition, the criticality information is used in case of the missing IE/IE
group abstract syntax error (see subclause 10.3.5).
The receiving node shall take different actions depending on the value of the
Criticality Information. The three possible values of the Criticality
Information for an IE/IE group are:
\- Reject IE.
\- Ignore IE and Notify Sender.
\- Ignore IE.
The comprehension of different IEs or IE groups within a standard version or
between standard versions is not mandated. Any IE or IE group that is not
supported shall be considered not comprehended, even if another IE or IE group
for that EP from that standard version is comprehended, and action based on
criticality shall be applied.
The comprehension of different EPs within a standard version or between
different standard versions is not mandated. Any EP that is not supported
shall be considered not comprehended, even if another EP from that standard
version is comprehended, and action based on criticality shall be applied.
### 10.3.3 Presence Information
For many IEs/IE groups which are optional according to the ASN.1 transfer
syntax, S1AP specifies separately if the presence of these IEs/IE groups is
optional or mandatory with respect to RNS application by means of the presence
field of the concerning object of class S1AP-PROTOCOL-IES, S1AP-PROTOCOL-IES-
PAIR, S1AP-PROTOCOL-EXTENSION or S1AP-PRIVATE-IES.
The presence field of the indicated classes supports three values:
1\. Optional;
2\. Conditional;
3\. Mandatory.
If an IE/IE group is not included in a received message and the presence of
the IE/IE group is mandatory or the presence is conditional and the condition
is true according to the version of the specification used by the receiver, an
abstract syntax error occurs due to a missing IE/IE group.
If an IE/IE group is included in a received message and the presence of the
IE/IE group is conditional and the condition is false according to the version
of the specification used by the receiver, an abstract syntax error occurs due
to this erroneously present conditional IE/IE group.
### 10.3.4 Not comprehended IE/IE group
#### 10.3.4.1 Procedure Code
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality
information of the _Procedure Code_ IE according to the following:
**Reject IE:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure Code_ IE marked with "_Reject
IE_ " which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall
reject the procedure using the Error Indication procedure.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure Code_ IE marked with "_Ignore IE
and Notify Sender_ " which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall ignore the procedure and initiate the Error Indication
procedure.
**Ignore IE:**
\- If a message is received with a _Procedure Code_ IE marked with "_Ignore
IE_ " which the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall
ignore the procedure.
When using the Error Indication procedure to reject a procedure or to report
an ignored procedure it shall include the _Procedure Code_ IE, the _Triggering
Message_ IE, and the _Procedure Criticality_ IE in the _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE.
#### 10.3.4.1A Type of Message
When the receiving node cannot decode the _Type of Message_ IE, the Error
Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value.
#### 10.3.4.2 IEs other than the Procedure Code and Type of Message
The receiving node shall treat the different types of received criticality
information of an IE/IE group other than the _Procedure Code_ IE and _Type of
Message_ IE according to the following:
**Reject IE:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE group marked with "_Reject IE_ " which the receiving node does not
comprehend; none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed.
The receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the rejection of one
or more IEs/IE group using the message normally used to report unsuccessful
outcome of the procedure. In case the information received in the initiating
message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to
be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful outcome of the
procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and
initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
report unsuccessful outcome is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with "_Reject IE_ " which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication
procedure.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs marked with
"_Reject IE_ ", that the receiving node does not comprehend, the receiving
node shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate
local error handling.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE groups marked with "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " which the receiving
node does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the
not comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using
the understood IEs/IE groups, and report in the response message of the
procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored. In case the
information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a
value for all IEs that are required to be present in the response message, the
receiving node shall instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error
Indication procedure.
\- if a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
report the outcome of the procedure is received containing one or more IEs/IE
groups marked with "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " which the receiving node
does not comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using
the understood IEs/IE groups, and initiate the Error Indication procedure to
report that one or more IEs/IE groups have been ignored.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " which the receiving node does not
comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups, continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received (except for the reporting) using
the understood IEs/IE groups and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
**Ignore IE:**
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing one or more
IEs/IE groups marked with "_Ignore IE_ " which the receiving node does not
comprehend, the receiving node shall ignore the content of the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups and continue with the procedure as if the not
comprehended IEs/IE groups were not received using the understood IEs/IE
groups.
\- If a _response_ message is received containing one or more IEs/IE groups
marked with "_Ignore IE_ " which the receiving node does not comprehend, the
receiving node shall ignore the content of the not comprehended IEs/IE groups
and continue with the procedure as if the not comprehended IEs/IE groups were
not received using the understood IEs/IE groups.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with "_Reject IE_ " or
"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " using a response message defined for the
procedure, the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be
included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group.
When reporting not comprehended IEs/IE groups marked with "_Reject IE_ " or
"_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " using the Error Indication procedure, the
_Procedure Code_ IE, the _Triggering Message_ IE, _Procedure Criticality_ IE,
and the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be included in
the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group.
### 10.3.5 Missing IE or IE group
The receiving node shall treat the missing IE/IE group according to the
criticality information for the missing IE/IE group in the received message
specified in the version of this specification used by the receiver:
**Reject IE:**
\- if a received message _initiating_ a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "_Reject IE_ "; none of the
functional requests of the message shall be executed. The receiving node shall
reject the procedure and report the missing IEs/IE groups using the message
normally used to report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the
information received in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a
value for all IEs that are required to be present in the message used to
report the unsuccessful outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall
instead terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- if a received message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message
to report unsuccessful outcome is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality "_Reject IE_ ", the receiving node shall terminate the
procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- if a received _response_ message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality "_Reject IE_ , the receiving node shall consider the
procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local error handling.
**Ignore IE and Notify Sender:**
\- if a received message _initiating_ a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ ", the
receiving node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the
procedure based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and report
in the response message of the procedure that one or more IEs/IE groups were
missing. In case the information received in the initiating message was
insufficient to determine a value for all IEs that are required to be present
in the response message, the receiving node shall instead terminate the
procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- if a received message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message
to report the outcome of the procedure is missing one or more IEs/IE groups
with specified criticality "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ ", the receiving
node shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure
based on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error
Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
\- if a received _response_ message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ ", the receiving node
shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based
on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message and initiate the Error
Indication procedure to report that one or more IEs/IE groups were missing.
**Ignore IE:**
\- if a received message _initiating_ a procedure is missing one or more
IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "_Ignore IE_ ", the receiving node
shall ignore that those IEs are missing and continue with the procedure based
on the other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
\- if a received _response_ message is missing one or more IEs/IE groups with
specified criticality "_Ignore IE_ ", the receiving node shall ignore that
those IEs/IE groups are missing and continue with the procedure based on the
other IEs/IE groups present in the message.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "_Reject IE_ "
or "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " using a response message defined for the
procedure, the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be
included in the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group.
When reporting missing IEs/IE groups with specified criticality "_Reject IE_ "
or "_Ignore IE and Notify Sender_ " using the Error Indication procedure, the
_Procedure Code_ IE, the _Triggering Message_ IE, _Procedure Criticality_ IE,
and the _Information Element Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall be included in
the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE for each reported IE/IE group.
### 10.3.6 IEs or IE groups received in wrong order or with too many
occurrences or erroneously present
If a message with IEs or IE groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences
is received or if IEs or IE groups with a conditional presence are present
when the condition is not met (i.e., erroneously present), the receiving node
shall behave according to the following:
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure is received containing IEs or IE
groups in wrong order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present,
none of the functional requests of the message shall be executed. The
receiving node shall reject the procedure and report the cause value "Abstract
Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)" using the message normally used to
report unsuccessful outcome of the procedure. In case the information received
in the initiating message was insufficient to determine a value for all IEs
that are required to be present in the message used to report the unsuccessful
outcome of the procedure, the receiving node shall instead terminate the
procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure.
\- If a message _initiating_ a procedure that does not have a message to
report unsuccessful outcome is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong
order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node
shall terminate the procedure and initiate the Error Indication procedure, and
use cause value "Abstract Syntax Error (Falsely Constructed Message)".
\- If a _response_ message is received containing IEs or IE groups in wrong
order or with too many occurrences or erroneously present, the receiving node
shall consider the procedure as unsuccessfully terminated and initiate local
error handling.
When determining the correct order only the IEs specified in the specification
version used by the receiver shall be considered.
## 10.4 Logical Error
Logical error situations occur when a message is comprehended correctly, but
the information contained within the message is not valid (i.e., semantic
error), or describes a procedure which is not compatible with the state of the
receiver. In these conditions, the following behaviour shall be performed
(unless otherwise specified) as defined by the class of the elementary
procedure, irrespective of the criticality information of the IEs/IE groups
containing the erroneous values.
**[Class 1:]{.underline}**
Where the logical error occurs in a request message of a class 1 procedure,
and the procedure has a message to report this unsuccessful outcome, this
message shall be sent with an appropriate cause value. Typical cause values
are:
\- Semantic Error.
\- Message not compatible with receiver state.
Where the logical error is contained in a request message of a class 1
procedure, and the procedure does not have a message to report this
unsuccessful outcome, the procedure shall be terminated and the Error
Indication procedure shall be initiated with an appropriate cause value. The
_Procedure Code_ IE and the _Triggering Message_ IE within the _Criticality
Diagnostics_ IE shall then be included in order to identify the message
containing the logical error.
Where the logical error exists in a response message of a class 1 procedure,
the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully terminated and local error
handling shall be initiated.
**[Class 2:]{.underline}**
Where the logical error occurs in a message of a class 2 procedure, the
procedure shall be terminated and the Error Indication procedure shall be
initiated with an appropriate cause value. The _Procedure Code_ IE and the
_Triggering Message_ IE within the _Criticality Diagnostics_ IE shall then be
included in order to identify the message containing the logical error.
## 10.5 Exceptions
The error handling for all the cases described hereafter shall take precedence
over any other error handling described in the other subclauses of clause 10.
\- If any type of error (Transfer Syntax Error, Abstract Syntax Error or
Logical Error) is detected in the ERROR INDICATION message, it shall not
trigger the Error Indication procedure in the receiving Node but local error
handling.
\- In case a response message or Error Indication message needs to be
returned, but the information necessary to determine the receiver of that
message is missing, the procedure shall be considered as unsuccessfully
terminated and local error handling shall be initiated.
\- If an error that terminates a procedure occurs, the returned cause value
shall reflect the error that caused the termination of the procedure even if
one or more abstract syntax errors with criticality "ignore and notify" have
earlier occurred within the same procedure.
\- If an AP ID error is detected, the error handling as described in subclause
10.6 shall be applied.
## 10.6 Handling of AP ID
NOTE: **The "first message", the "first returned message" and the "last
message" as used below correspond to messages for a UE-associated logical
connection. The "first message" has a new AP ID from the sending node and the
"first returned message" is the first response message, which has a new APID
from the node sending the "first returned message". Thereafter the two APIDs
are included in all messages over the** UE-associated logical connection
unless otherwise allowed by the specification. The "last message" is a message
sent by a node in order to complete the termination of a given UE-associated
logical connection, such that no other messages for the same connection are
expected in either direction.
**If a node receives a first message that includes a remote AP ID which is
erroneous, e.g., an AP ID which has been stored previously for another** UE-
associated logical connection for the same peer node**, the receiving node
shall initiate an Error Indication procedure with inclusion of only the
previously received AP ID from the peer node and an appropriate cause value.
In this case, both nodes shall initiate a local release of any established**
UE-associated logical connection **having the erroneous AP ID as local or
remote identifier.**
**If a node receives a first returned message that includes a remote AP ID
which has been stored previously for another UE-associated logical connection
for the same peer node, or that includes an AP ID pair which is inconsistent
(e.g., the local AP ID is unknown or already allocated to another UE-
associated logical connection), the receiving node shall initiate an Error
Indication procedure with inclusion of the received AP IDs from the peer node
and an appropriate cause value. Both nodes shall initiate a local release of
any established** UE-associated logical connection **(for the same S1
interface) having these AP IDs as local or remote identifier.**
**If a node receives a message (other than the first or first returned
messages) that includes AP ID(s) identifying a logical connection which is
unknown to the node (for the same S1 interface):**
\- if this message is not the last message for this UE-associated logical
connection, the node shall initiate an Error Indication procedure with
inclusion of the received AP ID(s) from the peer node and an appropriate cause
value. Both nodes shall initiate a local release of any established UE-
associated logical connection (for the same S1 interface) having the erroneous
AP ID(s) as local or remote identifier.
\- if this message is the last message for this UE-associated logical
connection, the receiving node shall initiate a local release of any
established UE-associated logical connection (for the same S1 interface) that
have either the local or remote AP ID(s) as identifiers.
###### ## Annex A (informative): S1AP Transparent containers content
Transparent containers are used in order to transfer information from one RAN
node to another RAN node. Depending on the particular scenario the behaviour
of both involved RAN nodes may be either specified according to the same radio
system or according to different radio systems. During an inter-system
handover the source RAN node has to adopt to the target RAN node and its
requirements. Therefore the container content is encoded according to the
rules which are specified for the target radio system.
In S1AP, there is a single transparent container defined for transporting
information from the source to the target RAN node and a single transparent
container for transporting information from the target to the source RAN node
during handover preparation: the _Source to Target Transparent Container_ IE
and the _Target to Source Transparent Container_ IE, which may carry either
NG-RAN, E-UTRAN, UTRAN or GERAN specific information.
NOTE: The definition of generic transparent containers for handover purposes
allows to transport them through the core network in a RAT-agnostic way.
In subclause 8.4.1.2, it is described how the transparent container shall be
encoded with respect to the scenario in which it is used.
The table below is showing all possible scenarios and definitions according to
which the content of the transparent container shall be encoded. Additionally
the reference to the specification defining particular IE is given.

###### ## Annex C (informative): Processing of Transparent Containers at the
MME
The encoding of the _Source to Target Transparent Container_ and _Target to
Source Transparent Container_ IEs in this specification is different from the
one specified in TS 25.413 [19].
Irrespective of the mobility scenario (inter-RAT or intra-LTE), the MME always
processes these IEs in the following way:
\- The MME shall convey to the eNodeB the information received within
\- the GTPv1-C \"UTRAN transparent field\" of the \"UTRAN Transparent
