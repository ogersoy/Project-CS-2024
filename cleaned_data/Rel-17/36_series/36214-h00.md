# 4 Control of UE/E-UTRAN measurements
In this clause the general measurement control concept of the higher layers is
briefly described to provide an understanding on how L1 measurements are
initiated and controlled by higher layers.
With the measurement specifications L1 provides measurement capabilities for
the UE and E-UTRAN. These measurements can be classified in different reported
measurement types: intra-frequency, inter-frequency, inter-system, traffic
volume, quality and UE internal measurements (see the RRC Protocol [7]).
In the L1 measurement definitions, see clause 5, the measurements are
categorised as measurements in the UE (the messages for these will be
described in the MAC Protocol [6] or RRC Protocol [7] or LPP Protocol [11]) or
measurements in the E-UTRAN (the messages for these will be described in the
Frame Protocol or LPPa Protocol [12]).
To initiate a specific measurement, the E-UTRAN transmits a \'RRC connection
reconfiguration message\' to the UE including a measurement ID and type, a
command (setup, modify, release), the measurement objects, the measurement
quantity, the reporting quantities and the reporting criteria
(periodical/event-triggered), see [7] or E-SMLC transmits an \'LPP Request
Location Information message\' to UE, see [11].
When the reporting criteria are fulfilled the UE shall answer with a
\'measurement report message\' to the E-UTRAN including the measurement ID and
the results or an \'LPP Provide Location Information message\' to the E-SMLC,
see [11].
For idle mode, the measurement information elements are broadcast in the
System Information.
# 5 Measurement capabilities for E-UTRA
In this clause the physical layer measurements reported to higher layers are
defined.
## 5.1 UE measurement capabilities
The structure of the table defining a UE measurement quantity is shown below.
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Column field** | Comment | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Definition** | Contains the definition of the measurement. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Applicable for** | States in which state(s) it shall be possible | | | to perform this measurement. The following | | | terms are used in the tables: | | | | | | > RRC_IDLE; | | | > | | | > RRC_CONNECTED; | | | | | | Intra-frequency appended to the RRC state: | | | | | | > Shall be possible to perform in the | | | > corresponding RRC state on an | | | > intra-frequency cell; | | | | | | Inter-frequency appended to the RRC state: | | | | | | > Shall be possible to perform in the | | | > corresponding RRC state on an | | | > inter-frequency cell | | | | | | Inter-RAT appended to the RRC state: | | | | | | > Shall be possible to perform in the | | | > corresponding RRC state on an inter-RAT | | | > cell. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
### 5.1.1 Reference Signal Received Power (RSRP)
+--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Definition** | Reference signal received power (RSRP), is | | | defined as the linear average over the power | | | contributions (in [W]) of the resource | | | elements that carry cell-specific reference | | | signals within the considered measurement | | | frequency bandwidth. | | | | | | For RSRP determination the cell-specific | | | reference signals R~0~ according to TS 36.211 | | | [3] shall be used. If the UE can reliably | | | detect that R~1~ is available, it may use R~1~ | | | in addition to R~0~ to determine RSRP. | | | | | | If higher layers indicate measurements based | | | on discovery signals, the UE shall measure | | | RSRP in the subframes in the configured | | | discovery signal occasions. For frame | | | structure 1 and 2, if the UE can reliably | | | detect that cell-specific reference signals | | | are present in other subframes, the UE may use | | | those subframes in addition to determine RSRP. | | | | | | If higher layers indicate measurements based | | | on resynchronization signals (RSS), the UE | | | shall measure RSRP on the resynchronization | | | signal in the subframes in the configured | | | resynchronization signal occasions. | | | | | | The reference point for the RSRP shall be the | | | antenna connector of the UE. | | | | | | If receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the | | | reported value shall not be lower than the | | | corresponding RSRP of any of the individual | | | diversity branches. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Applicable for** | RRC_IDLE intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_IDLE inter-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED inter-frequency | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
NOTE 1: The number of resource elements within the considered measurement
frequency bandwidth and within the measurement period that are used by the UE
to determine RSRP is left up to the UE implementation with the limitation that
corresponding measurement accuracy requirements have to be fulfilled.
NOTE 2: The power per resource element is determined from the energy received
during the useful part of the symbol, excluding the CP.

If higher layers | | | indicate all OFDM symbols for performing RSRQ | | | measurements, then RSSI is measured from | | | all OFDM symbols of the DL part of measurement | | | subframes. If higher-layers indicate certain | | | subframes for performing RSRQ measurements, | | | then RSSI is measured from all OFDM symbols of | | | the DL part of the indicated subframes. | | | | | | If higher layers indicate measurements based | | | on discovery signals, RSSI is measured from | | | all OFDM symbols of the DL part of the | | | subframes in the configured discovery signal | | | occasions. | | | | | | The reference point for the RSRQ shall be the | | | antenna connector of the UE. | | | | | | If receiver diversity is in use by the UE, the | | | reported value shall not be lower than the | | | corresponding RSRQ of any of the individual | | | diversity branches. | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+ | **Applicable for** | RRC_IDLE intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_IDLE inter-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED intra-frequency, | | | | | | RRC_CONNECTED inter-frequency | +--------------------+------------------------------------------------+
