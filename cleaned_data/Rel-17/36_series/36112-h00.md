# 4 General Test Conditions and Declarations
## 4.1 Measurement uncertainties and test requirements
### 4.1.1 General
The requirements of this clause apply to all applicable tests in this
specification.
The Minimum Requirements are given in 36.111 [2] and test requirements are
given in this specification. Test Tolerances are defined in Annex F of this
specification. Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test. The
Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in 36.111 [2] to
create Test Requirements.
### 4.1.2 Acceptable uncertainty of Test System
The maximum acceptable uncertainty of the Test System is specified below for
each test, where appropriate. The Test System shall enable the stimulus
signals in the test case to be adjusted to within the specified tolerance and
the equipment under test to be measured with an uncertainty not exceeding the
specified values. All tolerances and uncertainties are absolute values, and
are valid for a confidence level of 95 %, unless otherwise stated.
A confidence level of 95% is the measurement uncertainty tolerance interval
for a specific measurement that contains 95% of the performance of a
population of test equipment.
For RF tests in Section 6, it should be noted that the uncertainties in
subclause 4.1.2 apply to the Test System operating into a nominal 50 ohm load
and do not include system effects due to mismatch between the LMU and the Test
System.

and 2.5 * BW~Channel~ above the last carrier frequency transmitted by the BS,
where BW~Channel~ is the channel bandwidth according to Table 5.6‑1, may be
excluded from the requirement. However, frequencies that are more than 10 MHz
below the lowest frequency of the BS downlink operating band or more than 10
MHz above the highest frequency of the BS downlink operating band (see Table
5.5-1) shall not be excluded from the requirement.
NOTE: If the above Test Requirement differs from the Minimum Requirement then
the Test Tolerance applied for this test is non-zero. The relationship between
Minimum Requirements and Test Requirements is defined in subclause 4.1 and the
explanation of how the Minimum Requirement has been relaxed by the Test
Tolerance is given in Annex G.
## 6.8 Receiver intermodulation
### 6.8.1 Definition and applicability
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal. In this condition a detection probability requirement and a false
alarm requirements shall be met for a specified reference measurement channel.
Interfering signals shall be a continuous wave signal and an E-UTRA signal as
specified in Annex C.
Test ports and the RF requirements applicability is as specified in [2], Table
5.1-1.
### 6.8.2 Minimum Requirement
The minimum requirement is in TS 36.111[2] subclause 5.8.1.
### 6.8.3 Test purpose
The test purpose is to verify the ability of the LMU receiver to inhibit the
generation of intermodulation products in its non-linear elements caused by
the presence of two high-level interfering signals at frequencies with a
specific relationship to the frequency of the wanted signal so the probability
of detection requirement and a false alarm requirement shall be met for a
specified reference measurement channel.
### 6.8.4 Method of test
#### 6.8.4.1 Initial conditions
Test environment: normal; see subclause D.2.
RF channels to be tested: B, M and T; see subclause 4.7.

###### ## Annex D (informative): Environmental requirements for the LMU
equipment
# D.1 General
For each test in the present document, the environmental conditions under
which the LMU is to be tested are defined.
# D.2 Normal test environment
When a normal test environment is specified for a test, the test should be
performed within the minimum and maximum limits of the conditions stated in
Table D.1.
Table D.1: Limits of conditions for Normal Test Environment
* * *
Condition Minimum Maximum Barometric pressure 86 kPa 106 kPa Temperature 15°C
30°C Relative Humidity 20 % 85 % Power supply Nominal, as declared by the
manufacturer  
Vibration Negligible
* * *
The ranges of barometric pressure, temperature and humidity represent the
maximum variation expected in the uncontrolled environment of a test
laboratory. If it is not possible to maintain these parameters within the
specified limits, the actual values shall be recorded in the test report.
NOTE: This may, for instance, be the case for measurements of radiated
emissions performed on an open field test site.
# D.3 Extreme test environment
The manufacturer shall declare one of the following:
1) the equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the IEC 60
721-3-3 [4];
2) the equipment class for the equipment under test, as defined in the IEC 60
721-3-4 [5];
3) the equipment that does not comply to the mentioned classes, the relevant
classes from IEC 60 721 documentation for Temperature, Humidity and Vibration
shall be declared.
NOTE: Reduced functionality for conditions that fall outside of the standard
operational conditions are not tested in the present document. These may be
stated and tested separately.
## D.3.1 Extreme temperature
When an extreme temperature test environment is specified for a test, the test
shall be performed at the standard minimum and maximum operating temperatures
defined by the manufacturer\'s declaration for the equipment under test.
**Minimum temperature:**
The test shall be performed with the environment test equipment and methods
including the required environmental phenomena into the equipment, conforming
to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-1 [6].
**Maximum temperature:**
The test shall be performed with the environmental test equipment and methods
including the required environmental phenomena into the equipment, conforming
to the test procedure of IEC 60 068-2-2 [7].
NOTE: It is recommended that the equipment is made fully operational prior to
the equipment being taken to its lower operating temperature.
# D.4 Vibration
When vibration conditions are specified for a test, the test shall be
performed while the equipment is subjected to a vibration sequence as defined
by the manufacturer's declaration for the equipment under test. This shall use
the environmental test equipment and methods of inducing the required
environmental phenomena in to the equipment, conforming to the test procedure
of IEC 60 068-2-6 [8]. Other environmental conditions shall be within the
ranges specified in clause D.2.
NOTE: The higher levels of vibration may induce undue physical stress in to
equipment after a prolonged series of tests. The testing body should only
vibrate the equipment during the RF measurement process.

environments shall be.
> Pressure: ±5 kPa.
>
> Temperature: ±2 degrees.
>
> Relative Humidity: ±5 %.
>
> DC Voltage: ±1,0 %.
>
> AC Voltage: ±1,5 %.
>
> Vibration: 10 %.
>
> Vibration frequency: 0,1 Hz.
The above values shall apply unless the test environment is otherwise
controlled and the specification for the control of the test environment
specifies the uncertainty for the parameter.
###### ## Annex E (informative): General Rules for statistical testing
# E.1 Error Definition
For the RF requirements testing, a correct event is when the LMU detects the
wanted signal with the false alarm rate as specified in TS 36.111 clause
5.1.1. To pass a RF requirements test, the detection probability has to be at
least 99% and the false alarm rate below 0.1%.
For the UL RTOA measurement testing, a correct event is when the LMU returns a
measurement response with a correct UL RTOA measurement within the time as
specified in clauses 7.2.5, 7.3.5 and 7.4.5, whichever applies. To pass a UL
RTOA measurement test, at least 90% of the events have to be correct.
For the UL RTOA measurement accuracy testing, a correct event is when the LMU
returns a measurement response with a correct UL RTOA measurement that has a
value less than or equal to the corresponding required value in Tables
8.2.5-1, 8.3.5-1, 8.4.5-1 and 8.5.5-1, whichever applies. To pass a UL RTOA
measurement accuracy test, at least 90% of the events have to be correct.
# E.2 Test Method
Each test is performed in the following manner:
a) Setup the required test conditions.
b) Record the number of samples tested and the number of correct events.
c) Stop the test when the number of correct events is sufficient to pass the
test or after a given time.
d) Once the test is stopped decide whether the test has been passed or not.
###### ## Annex F (informative): Test tolerances and derivation of test
requirements
# F.1 Test tolerances and derivation of test requirements
The Test Requirements in this specification have been calculated by relaxing
the Minimum Requirements of the core specification using the Test Tolerances
defined in clause 4. When the Test Tolerance is zero, the Test Requirement
will be the same as the Minimum Requirement. When the Test Tolerance is non-
zero, the Test Requirements will differ from the Minimum Requirements, and the
formula used for this relaxation is given in tables F.1, F.2 and F.3.
Note that a formula for applying Test Tolerances is provided for all tests,
even those with a test tolerance of zero. This is necessary in the case that
the Test System uncertainty is greater than that allowed in clause 4. In this
event, the excess error shall be subtracted from the defined test tolerance in
order to generate the correct tightened Test Requirements as defined in clause
4.
For example, a Test System having 0.9 dB accuracy for test 6.2.1 LMU Reference
sensitivity (which is 0.2 dB above the limit specified in clause 4.) would
subtract 0.2 dB from the Test Tolerance of 0.7 dB defined in clause 4. This
new test tolerance of 0.5 dB would then be applied to the Minimum Requirement
using the formula defined in Table F.1-1 to give a new wanted signal power of
-130.3 dBm for the reference sensitivity.
Using this same approach for the case where a test had a test tolerance of 0
dB, an excess error of 0.2 dB would result in a modified test tolerance of
-0.2 dB.

###### ## Annex G (informative): Measurement system setup
# G.1 Receiver RF Requirements Testing
The measurement set-ups in this clause are for the LMU RF requirements for
class 2 and class 3 LMUs specified in Section 5 of TS 36.111. The test ports
and the RF requirements applicability are as specified in Section 5.1 of TS
36.111. If any external apparatus, e.g., a RX amplifier, a filter or the
combination of such devices is used, LMU RF requirements apply and are tested
at the far end antenna connector (port B); otherwise, the requirements apply
at port A. No additional testing is necessary for class 1 LMUs, in addition to
base station conformance tests specified in TS 36.141.
Degradation of the base station DL performance and base station UL performance
may occur when LMU class 2 is co-sited with the base station; therefore the
impact on BS shall also be tested in conjunction with the LMU Receiver RF
conformance tests of this specification.
