# 1 Scope
The present document is a technical report for LTE-Advanced inter-band carrier
aggregation for x bands DL (x=3, 4, 5) with 2 bands UL under Rel-17 time
frame. The purpose is to gather the relevant background information and
studies in order to address Rel-17 band combinations that are related to x
bands (x=3, 4, 5) DL with 2 bands UL CA requirements in Table 1-1, 1-2, and
1-3.

## 3.1 Terms
For the purposes of the present document, the terms given in 3GPP TR 21.905
[1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes
precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905
[1].
**Carrier aggregation** : Aggregation of two or more component carriers in
order to support wider transmission bandwidths.
**Channel bandwidth:** The RF bandwidth supporting a single E-UTRA RF carrier
with the transmission bandwidth configured in the uplink or downlink of a
cell. The channel bandwidth is measured in MHz and is used as a reference for
transmitter and receiver RF requirements.
**Inter-band carrier aggregation: Carrier aggregation of component carriers in
different operating bands.**
**Mixed intra-band and inter-band carrier aggregation: Carrier aggregation of
component carriers in same operating band and different operating bands.**
NOTE: Carriers aggregated in each band can be contiguous or non-contiguous.

# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for LTE-A inter-band CA for x bands
(x=3, 4, 5) DL with 2 bands UL under Rel-17 time frame and the document is
divided into two different parts:
\- General part: this part covers some common issues of x bands (x=3, 4, 5) DL
with 2 bands UL regardless of band combinations
\- Specific band combination part: this part covers each band combination of x
bands (x=3, 4, 5) DL with 2 bands UL and its own specific issues independently
from each other (i.e. one sub-clause is defined per band combination)
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the band
combination have been implemented.
# 5 LTE-A inter-band CA for x bands DL with 2 bands UL: General part
## 5.1 UE RF part
### 5.1.1 UE general RF architecture
The UE RF architecture of the general part in TR 36.716-03-02 (Rel-16) can be
reused to define Maximum Sensitivity Degradation (MSD) for LTE-A inter-band CA
for x bands (x = 3, 4, 5) DL with 2 bands in Rel-17. This UE general RF
architecture is for TDD-FDD Carrier Aggregation (CA) band combinations in
Rel-17 and it only applies to LTE. Non-Standalone (NSA) DC/CA operation isn't
considered in this technical report.
Figure 5.1.1-1: Example of UE RF architecture using cascaded diplexer
### 5.1.2 General treatment of ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
Additional insertion loss from LTE-A inter-band CA for x bands DL / 1 UL can
be reused when new RF components are not necessary to be introduced. If there
will be a need for introducing the new RF components, then more detail
information shall be provided for a certain band combination.
### 5.1.3 Fallback CA mode and mandatory support of all paired 2 UL CA
configurations
Based on the agreed Way forward (R4-168853) in Rel-14, fallback CA mode has
been defined by RAN4.
### 5.1.4 General TX/RX requirements
#### 5.1.4.1 Transmitter requirements
For dual uplink inter-band CA operation, transmitter requirements have been
analyzed in TR36.860 and UEs supporting LTE-A inter-band CA for x bands (x= 3,
4, 5) DL with 2 bands UL can apply the common Tx requirements in Table
5.1.4.1-1.

#### 5.1.4.2 Receiver requirements
Like the transmitter requirements in the section 5.1.4.1, receiver
requirements have been analysed in TR36.860 for dual uplink inter-band CA
operation and additional requirements of UE RF receiver for LTE-A inter-band
CA for x bands (x = 3, 4, 5) DL with 2 bands UL can be found in Table
5.1.4.2-1. For some band combinations that are related to x bands (x = 3, 4,
5) DL with 2 bands UL without self-interference problem, the same requirements
of x bands DL/ 1 bands UL CA can be reused. The requirements (out-of-band
blocking and spurious response) of 2 bands DL / 2 bands UL can be covered by
applying the test method of one uplink (i.e. single carrier LTE and 2 bands DL
/ 1 band UL CA. Therefore, there will be no required to test the requirements
(out-of-band blocking and spurious response) for x bands DL with 2 bands UL.
Only REFSENS test will be required when all x bands DL and 2 bands UL are
activated at the same time. Lastly, a new MSD value shall be defined for a
band combination which has self-interference problem when two uplinks are
activated.

fall into the own Rx frequency of Band 3. And also the 4^th^ & 5^th^ IMDs fall
into the own Rx frequency of Band 8. The 5^th^ IMD falls into the own Rx
frequency of Band 20.

Band 38.
\- The 3rd harmonic of band 20 falls into the own Rx frequency of Band 38.
#### 6.4.1.3 MSD
According to the co-existence studies as above, there is no MSD requirements
caused by IMD when uplink CA configurations CA_1A-20A is paired with downlink
CA configuration CA_1A-20A-38A.
For the harmonic MSD requirements, it have already been solved in the fallback
combination of CA_20A-38A. Thus there are no additional MSD requirement for
the uplink CA configurations CA_1A-20A paired with downlink CA configuration
CA_1A-20A-38A.

When uplink CA configurations CA_1A-8A is paired with downlink CA
configuration CA_1A-8A-20A-38A there are no additional analysis of MSD because
it is solved in fallback band combination.

configuration, which means there is no need to consider additional MSD
requirements for this combination.

For 2UL/4DL LTE CA band combination, the additional MSD caused by the
intermodulation products of two ULs from CA_1A-20A falls into band 7 or band
38 would be defined. However, such MSD are discussed in the corresponding fall
back 2UL/3DL LTE CA band combination of CA_1A-7A-20A and CA_1A-20A-38A, where
no intermodulation products of two ULs from CA_1A-20A falls into band 7 or
band 38.

According to the co-existence studies analysis, when uplink CA configurations
CA_1A-20A is paired with downlink CA configuration CA_1A-7A-20A-38A there are
no additional analysis of MSD because they are solved in fallback band
combination.

Based on Table 8.2.1.2-1, the 3^rd^ IMD will interfere own Rx frequency of
Band 1. There are no harmonic or IMD products from Band 1 and Band 3 uplinks
which would desensitize Band 8 and Band 20 and Band 38 downlink.

When uplink CA configurations CA_1A-3A, CA_1A-8A and CA_3A-8A is paired with
downlink CA configuration CA_1A-3A-8A-20A-38A there is no additional analysis
of MSD because it is solved in fallback band combination.

The ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values are shown in table 8.2.1.4-1 and table

#### 8.3.1.2 Co-existence studies
For 2UL/5DL LTE CA band combination, the additional MSD caused by the
intermodulation products of two ULs from CA_1A-3A, CA_1A-20A and CA_3A-20A
falls into its own Rx bands such as band 3, band 7, band 20 or band 38 would
be defined.
According to the co-existence of the 2ULs for CA_1A-3A, CA_1A-20A and
CA_3A-20A, it can be found that:
\- There are no IMDs products fall into own Rx of Band 7, band 20 and band 38
for 2UL of CA_1A-3A
-There are no IMDs products fall into own Rx of Band 3, Band 7 and Band 38 for 2UL of CA_1A-20A.
-There are no IMDs products fall into own Rx of Band 1, but 2^rd^ IMDs products fall into own Rx of Band7 and Band 38 for 2UL of CA_3A-20A.
#### 8.3.1.3 MSD
According to the co-existence studies analysis, when uplink CA configurations
CA_1A-3A, CA_1A-20A and CA_3A-20A are paired with downlink CA configuration
CA_1A-3A-7A-20A-38A, there are no additional analysis of MSD because they are
solved in fallback band combination.
#### 8.3.1.4 ∆TIB and ∆RIB values
The same requirements of fallback combination can be applied.
