## 4.1 E-UTRAN measurements performed by the eNB
### 4.1.1 PRB usage
The objective of the PRB usage measurements is to measure usage of time and
frequency resources. A use case is cell load balancing, where PRB usage is
used for information signalled across the X2 interface. Another use-case is
OAM performance observability.
If there is one or more RNs served in a cell, for that cell the eNB performs
PRB usage measurements separately for all traffic (including transmissions
to/from RNs and UEs directly connected to the eNB) and for RN traffic.
#### 4.1.1.1 Total PRB usage
Protocol Layer: MAC
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------+ | **Definition** | Total PRB usage is calculated in the | | | time-frequency domain only.

NOTE: It is up to the eNB implementation how to calculate _P(T)_ with respect

subframes subject to restrictions due to TDM ICIC.

carries data corresponding to only one QCI and: $X(t) = 0$otherwise. It is up
to implementation if to take multiplexing into account or not.

The objective of this measurement is to measure the data volume transmitted or
received by the eNB in a configured measurement period, for the different PLMN
identities in a shared network. The measurement is performed per configured
PLMN ID per configured QoS profile criteria.
The QoS profile criteria may include one or more of the following criteria:
one QCI indicator, one GBR Indicator, one ARP Indicator, where
\- a QCI Indicator identifies one specific QCI value. QCI values range from 1
to 256. If the indicator is not set then all QCI values should be taken into
account.
\- a GBR Indicator identifies one GBR range value defined by OAM. If the
indicator is not set then all GBR ranges should be taken into account.
\- an ARP Indicator identifies one ARP priority value. ARP values range from 1
to 15. If the indicator is not set then all ARP priority values should be
taken into account.
The QoS profile criteria are satisfied when all the configured indicators are
matched. It is possible that none of the QoS parameters are configured in
which case the measurement is collected per configured PLMN ID.

The objective of the distribution of PRB usage measurements is to measure the
distribution of the usage of time and frequency resources. A use case is cell
load balancing, where PRB usage is used for information signalled across the
X2 interface. Another use-case is OAM performance observability.
If there is one or more RNs served in a cell, for that cell the eNB performs
PRB usage measurements separately for all traffic (including transmissions
to/from RNs and UEs directly connected to the eNB) and for RN traffic.

TTIs in the measurement. The measurement is performed per UE. Initial
buffering time in UE or eNB is excluded.
For an eNB serving one or more RNs, packets transmitted between the eNB and
