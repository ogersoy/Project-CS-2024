# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3GPP.
This TS specifies the stage 3 description of the Unstructured Supplementary
Service Data (USSD) operations within the 3GPP system.
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of this TS, it will be re-released by the TSG with an identifying
change of release date and an increase in version number as follows:
Version 3.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 Indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the specification;
# 1 Scope
The present document gives the stage 3 description of the Unstructured
Supplementary Service Data (USSD) operations.
The group of unstructured supplementary service data operations is divided
into two different classes:
‑ Network initiated unstructured supplementary service data operations (clause
5);
‑ Mobile initiated unstructured supplementary service data operations (clause
6).

# 4 Cross phase compatibility
For the mobile initiated USSD operations, a number of changes exist between
the present document and the protocol version 1 specification. For these
operations the main body of the present document assumes that all network
entities comply with this version of the service. In this case an additional
subclause defines the additional requirements for when one or more network
entities or the Mobile Station (MS) complies with the protocol version 1
specifications for the USSD operations.
# 5 Network initiated unstructured supplementary service data operations
## 5.1 Unstructured supplementary service data request
### 5.1.1 Normal operation
The network invokes an USSD request by sending a REGISTER message containing a
UnstructuredSS‑Request invoke component to the MS.
The MS shall respond to the request by sending a FACILITY message containing
the user\'s mobile subscriber\'s response in a return result component. The
network shall pass the data received in the response to the application
handling USSD operations and shall wait for the response of the application.
The application may either continue or terminate the dialogue.
When the application continues the dialogue, it may initiate another USSD
operation by sending a FACILITY message (see figure 5.2). The operation may
either be an USSD request or notification (see subclause 5.1.2).
When the application terminates the dialogue, the network shall clear the
transaction by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message. The MS may also clear the
transaction at any time by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message upon the request
of the user.
If the MS is unable to process the request received from the network, it shall
return an error indication by sending a FACILITY message containing a return
error component. Error values are specified in 3GPP TS 24.080.
When the MS receives an USSD operation in parallel to any call independent
supplementary service transaction, it shall respond with a return error
component in a RELEASE COMPLETE message, containing the \"USSD‑Busy\" error as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.080, to indicate the failure in handling a parallel
USSD operation. However, the network is allowed to initiate USSD operations in
parallel to call related transactions.

Figure 6.2: Mobile initiated USSD operation, network requests further
information
NOTE 1: The MS may clear the transaction at any time by sending a RELEASE
COMPLETE upon request of the user.
NOTE 2: The network may request further information several times. Only one
information request is shown. The network initiated USSD operation may also be
an USSD notification. Only a network initiated USSD request is shown.
## 6.2 Cross phase compatibility
### 6.2.1 Network only supports protocol version 1 of unstructured
supplementary service data operations
If a mobile initiated USSD request using protocol version 2 is rejected by the
network, and the reason for the rejection is indicated either by the problem
code \"unrecognized operation\" or a cause \"Facility rejected\", the MS shall
assume that the network only supports protocol version 1 of USSD operations.
The MS shall re‑attempt the request by using the appropriate protocol version
1 USSD operation without a SS version indicator if the unstructured data
entered by the user can be coded as an IA5 string.
### 6.2.2 Mobile station only supports protocol version 1 of unstructured
supplementary service data operations
A MS supporting only protocol version 1 invokes an USSD request by sending a
REGISTER message to the network containing a ProcessUnstructuredSsData invoke
component without a SS version indicator. In this situation the network is not
allowed to start a network initiated USSD operation. If the application
requires such an operation for its proper function, the USSD operation sent by
the MS shall be rejected by the application. The network shall terminate the
transaction by sending a RELEASE COMPLETE message with cause \"Facility
rejected\" (see 3GPP TS 24.008).
