where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the signalling control protocols needed to
support Mission Critical Data (MCData) communications as specified by 3GPP TS
23.282 [2]. The present document specifies both on-network and off-network
protocols.
The present document utilises the common functional architecture to support
mission critical services as specified in 3GPP TS 23.280 [3], in support of
MCData communications.
The MCData service can be used for public safety applications and also for
general commercial applications e.g. utility companies and railways.
The present document is applicable to User Equipment (UE) supporting the
MCData client functionality, and to application servers supporting the MCData
server functionality.

# 4 General
## 4.1 MCData overview
The MCData service supports communication between a pair of users (i.e. one-
to-one communication) and several users (i.e. group communication), where each
user has the ability to:
\- share data using Short Data Service (SDS);
\- share files using File Distribution (FD) service; and
\- exchange Data using IP Connectivity service.
SDS is provided in both, on-network and off-network while FD and IP
Connectivity is provided only in on-network in this release of the present
document.
The present document provides the signalling control protocol enhancements to
support the MCData architectural procedures specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [2].
For on-network communications, the present document makes use of the existing
IMS procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
The on-network procedures in this document allow an MCData user to:
\- send a standalone SDS using signalling control plane;
\- send a standalone SDS using media plane;
\- initiate a SDS session;
\- send a file using HTTP;
\- send a file using media plane;
\- establish an IP Connectivity session to exchange Data;
\- access the MCData message store; and
\- use a functional alias to identify the MCData user.
For off-network, the present document utilises the procedures for ProSe direct
discovery for Public Safety and the procedures for one-to-one ProSe direct
communication for Public Safety and one-to-many ProSe direct communication for
Public Safety, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.334 [25], and allows an MCData user
to:
\- send a standalone SDS using signalling control plane.
ProSe is only supported in EPS.
The MCData procedures provided by the present document refer to:
\- the media plane procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.582 [15];
\- the group management procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.481 [11];
\- the identity management procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.482 [24]; and
\- the security procedures defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26].
The MCData procedures provided by the present document access the
configuration parameters provided by 3GPP TS 24.483 [42] and 3GPP TS 24.484
[12].
The following procedures are provided within this document:
\- common procedures are specified in clause 6;
\- procedures for registration in the IM CN subsystem and service
authorisation are specified in clause 7;
\- procedures for affiliation are specified in clause 8;
\- procedures for on-network and off-network SDS are specified in clause 9;
\- procedures for on-network FD are specified in clause 10;
\- procedures for transmission and reception control are specified in clause
11;
\- procedures for dispositions and notifications are specified in clause 12;
\- procedures for communication release are specified in clause 13;
\- procedures for location reporting are specified in clause 17;
\- procedure for using MBMS transmission are specified in clause 19;
\- procedures for establishing an IP Connectivity session are specified in
clause 20;
\- procedures for the MCData message store are specified in clause 21; and
\- procedures for the use of functional alias are specified in clause 22.
The MCData UE primarily obtains access to the MCData service via E-UTRAN or
NG-RAN, using the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 [43] and 3GPP TS 24.501
[81].
## 4.2 Identity, URI and address assignments
### 4.2.1 Public Service identities
In order to support MCData, the following URI and address assignments are
assumed:
1) the participating MCData function is configured to be reachable using:
a) the public service identity of the participating MCData function serving
the MCData user.
### 4.2.2 MCData session identity
The MCData session identity is a SIP URI, which identifies the MCData session
between:
\- the MCData client and the participating MCData function; and
\- the participating MCData function and the controlling MCData function.
The MCData session identity shall be a GRUU as defined in IETF RFC 5627 [44]
assigned by the MCData server as per 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
The MCData session identity identifies the MCData session in such a way that
e.g.:
\- the IM CN subsystem is able to route an initial SIP request to the
controlling MCData function.
The controlling MCData function allocates a unique MCData session identity
hosted at the controlling MCData function for the MCData session at the time
of session establishment.
When protection of sensitive application data is required by the MCData
operator, the MCData session identity cannot contain identity information that
is classified as sensitive such as the MCData ID or the MCData Group ID, as
specified in clause 4.6.
The controlling MCData function sends the MCData session identity towards the
MCData client during MCData session establishment by including it in the
Contact header field of the final SIP response to a session initiation
request.
The participating MCData function allocates a unique MCData session identity
hosted at the participating MCData function for the MCData session when it
receives a MCData session identity in the Contact header field of a SIP
request or a SIP response from the controlling MCData function and includes it
in the Contact header field of the SIP request or SIP response sent towards
the MCData client. The participating MCData function maintains a mapping of
the MCData session identities it sends to the MCData client to the
corresponding MCData session identities received from the controlling MCData
function.
The MCData client can cache the MCData session identity until a time when it
is no longer needed.
### 4.2.3 MCData client ID
MCData client ID is described in clause 4.8 of the present document.
## 4.3 Pre-established sessions
When establishing a pre-established session, the MCData client negotiates the
media parameters, including establishing IP addresses and ports using
interactive connectivity establishment (ICE) as specified in IETF RFC 8445
[77] and IETF RFC 8839 [78] with the participating MCData function, prior to
using the pre-established session for establishing MCData communication with
other MCData users. The procedures for establishing, modifying and releasing a
pre-established session are defined in clause 18.
The pre-established session can later be used in MCData communication. This
avoids the need to negotiate media parameters (including evaluating ICE
candidates) and reserving bearer resources during the MCData communication
establishment that results in delayed MCData communication establishment.
## 4.4 Emergency Alerts
MCData emergency alerts can be initiated or cancelled as described in the
procedures of clause 16 which include:
\- MCData emergency alert initiation, on-network;
\- MCData emergency alert cancellation, on-network;
\- MCData emergency alert initiation, off-network; and
\- MCData emergency alert cancellation, off-network.
MCData emergency alerts are initiated to a target MCData group, and, if
successful and not already affiliated to that group, will result in the
initiator being implicitly affiliated to that MCData group.
Key aspects of MCData emergency alerts include:
\- **MCData emergency alert (MDEA) state:** the MCData client maintains the
internal MCData emergency alert state (MDEA, see clause G.4.1). The initial
setting is \"MDEA 1: no-alert\".
\- **MCData private emergency alert (MDPEA) state** : the MCData client
maintains the internal MCData private emergency alert state (MDPEA, see clause
G.4.12). The initial setting is \"MDPEA 1: no-alert\".
**\- Authorisations for emergency alerts:** MCData users need to be authorised
to initiate MCData emergency alerts and additionally need to be authorised to
cancel MCData emergency alerts initiated by them or by others. The parameters
related to these authorisations are specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [42] and 3GPP
TS 24.484 [12].
## 4.5 MCData Protocol
Clauses 15 describes the TLV based message formats used in MCData
communications. Each message consist of a series of information elements.
Annex I of 3GPP TS 24.379 [10] describes the standard format of the messages
and the encoding rules for each type of information element.
## 4.6 Protection of sensitive XML application data
In certain deployments, for example, in the case that the MCData operator uses
the underlying SIP core infrastructure from the carrier operator, the MCData
operator can prevent certain sensitive application data from being visible in
the clear to the SIP layer. The following data are classed as sensitive
application data:
\- MCData ID;
\- MCData group ID;
\- user location information;
\- alert indicator;
\- access token (containing the MCData ID);
\- MCData client ID; and
\- functional alias.
The above data is transported as XML content in SIP messages. in XML elements
or XML attributes.
Data is transported in attributes in the following circumstances in the
procedures in the present document:
\- an MCData ID, an MCData Group ID, and an MCData client ID in an XML
document published in SIP PUBLISH request for affiliation according to IETF
RFC 3856 [39];
\- an MCData ID or an MCData Group ID in XML document notified in a SIP NOTIFY
request for affiliation according to IETF RFC 3856 [39];
\- an MCData ID in application/resource-lists+xml document included in a SIP
MESSAGE or SIP INVITE request for one-to-one SDS or one-to-one FD, according
to IETF RFC 5366 [18];
\- an MCData ID and functional alias in an XML document published in SIP
PUBLISH request for functional alias management according to IETF RFC 3856
[39]; and
\- an MCData ID and functional alias in an XML document notified in a SIP
NOTIFY request for functional alias management according to IETF RFC 3856
[39].
3GPP TS 33.180 [26] describes a method to provide confidentiality protection
of sensitive application data in elements by using XML encryption (i.e.
xmlenc) and in attributes by using an attribute confidentiality protection
scheme described in clause 6.6.2.3 of the present document. Integrity
protection can also be provided by using XML signatures (i.e. xmlsig).
Protection of the data relies on a shared XML protection key (XPK) used to
encrypt and sign data:
\- between the MCData client and the MCData server, the XPK is a client-server
key (CSK); and
\- between MCData servers, the XPK is a signalling protection key (SPK).
The CSK (XPK) and a key-id CSK-ID (XPK-ID) are generated from keying material
provided by the key management server. Identity based public key encryption
based on MIKEY-SAKKE is used to transport the CSK between SIP end-points. The
encrypted CSK is transported from the MCData client to the MCData server when
the MCData client performs service authorisation as described in clause 7 and
is also used during service authorisation to protect the access token.
The SPK (XPK) and a key-id SPK-ID (XPK-ID) are directly provisioned in the
MCData servers.
Configuration in the MCData client and MCData server is used to determine
whether one or both of confidentiality protection and integrity protection are
required.
The following four examples give a brief overview of the how confidentiality
and integrity protection is applied to application data in this specification.
EXAMPLE 1: Pseudo code showing how confidentiality protection is represented
in the procedures in the document for sensitive data sent by the originating
client.
IF configuration is set for confidentiality protection of sensitive data
THEN
Encrypt data element using the CSK (XPK;
Include in an \ element of the XML MIME body:
(1) the encryption method;
(2) the key-id (XPK-ID);
(3) the cipher data;
Encrypt URIs in attribute using the CSK (XPK) by following clause 6.6.2.3;
ELSE
include application data into XML MIME body in clear text;
ENDIF;
EXAMPLE 2: Pseudo code showing how integrity protection is represented in the
procedures in the present document for data sent by the originating client.
IF configuration is set for integrity protection of application data
THEN
Use a method to hash the content;
Generate a signature for the hashed content using the CSK (XPK;
Include within a \ XML element of the XML MIME body:
(1) a cannonicalisation method to be applied to the signed information;
(2) the signature method used for generating the signature;
(3) a reference to the content to be signed;
(4) the hashing method used;
(5) the hashed content;
(6) the key-id (XPK-ID);
(7) the signature value;
ENDIF;
EXAMPLE 3: Pseudo code showing how confidentiality protection is represented
in the procedures in the present document at the server side when receiving
encrypted content.
IF configuration is set for confidentiality protection of sensitive data
THEN
Check that the XML content contains the \ element;
Check that the XML document contains a URI with the domain name for MC
Services confidentiality protection;
Return an error if the \ element or domain name for MC Services
confidentiality protection are not found;
Otherwise:
(1) obtain the CSK (XPK) using the CSK-ID (XPK-ID) in the received XML body;
(2) for encrypted data in elements, decrypt the data elements using the CSK;
(3) for encrypted URIs in attributes, decrypt the URIs using the CSK;
ENDIF;
EXAMPLE 4: Pseudo code showing how integrity protection is represented in the
procedures in the present document at the server side when receiving signed
content.
IF configuration is set for integrity protection of application data
THEN
Check that the XML content contains the \ element;
Return an error if the \ element is not found;
Otherwise:
(1) obtain the CSK (XPK) using the CSK-ID (XPK-ID) in the received XML body;
(2) verify the signature of the content using the CSK;
Return an error if the validation of the signature fails;
IF validation of the signature passes
THEN
decrypt any data found in \ elements;
decrypt any encrypted URIs found in attributes;
ENDIF;
ENDIF;
The content can be re-encrypted and signed again using the SPK between MCData
servers.
The following examples show the difference between normal and encrypted data
content. In this example consider the MCData client initiating a group
standalone SDS message using the signalling control plane.

## 4.7 Protection of TLV signalling and media content
The protection of TLV signalling and media content is based on 3GPP MCData
security solution as defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26].
For different security requirements of different information elements of a
MCData message, the information elements of MCData messages are bifurcated in
the following components:
\- **MCData** **Data signalling payload** : information elements necessary for
identification and management of the MCData messages e.g. conversation
identifiers, session identifiers, transaction identifiers, disposition
requests, etc. This payload is confidentiality and integrity protected between
the MCData Client and the MCData server.
\- **MCData** **Data payload** : the actual user payload for MCData user or
application consumption. This payload is end-to-end confidentiality and
integrity protected.
An SDS message can be sent over both, signalling plane and media plane. When
an SDS message is sent using signalling plane, the body included in the SIP
MESSAGE request, which carries MCData Data signalling payload, is protected
between each entity separately if protection is applied. On the other hand the
body included in the SIP MESSAGE request which carries the MCData Data payload
is end-to-end protected. The procedures for the protection of the SDS messages
over the signalling plane are specified in this document. Protection of SDS
message over media control plane is specified in 3GPP TS 24.582 [15].
For FD using HTTP and FD using media plane, the MCData Data signalling payload
sent over the signalling plane is protected between each entity separately if
protection is applied. The procedure for the protection of the file is
specified in 3GPP TS 24.582 [15].
The ciphering algorithm indicated in the Key Download procedure by the MCData
server shall be used to protect the MCData signalling fields (i.e. MCData
signaling parameters, Data signaling payload and end-to-end security
parameters).
## 4.7A Signalling security when using MBMS
Signalling security is established between the participating MCData function
and the MCData client.
The protection of MBMS subchannel control messages on the general purpose MBMS
subchannels can be done with MSCCKs (each identified by a corresponding MSCCK-
ID), distributed during MBMS bearer announcement (see clause 19.2.2). Each
general purpose MBMS subchannel is associated with an MSCCK and a
corresponding MSCCK‑ID. There can be multiple general purpose MBMS subchannels
deployed, each associated with its own MSCCK and corresponding MSCCK-ID. The
(MSCCK-ID, MSCCK) pair is provided for each general purpose MBMS subchannel
separately.
According to 3GPP TS 33.180 [26] clause 8.2, the MCData Payload Protection Key
(DPPK) referenced in clause 6.6 is a Multicast Signalling Keys (MuSiK),
(identified by a corresponding (MuSiK-ID)), distributed via MuSiK download
messages. The MSCCK and MuSiKs can be distributed independently of each other
and in any order and can also be used independently. Signalling supports
initial keying, as well as repeated re-keying and un-keying for both MSCCK and
MuSiKs.
The MuSiK download message contains an embedded MIME payload which is the
MIKEY payload containing the MuSiK and MuSiK-ID, as well as an embedded XML
payload potentially containing an explicit list of MCData group ids to which
the key applies. Both payloads are protected as described in 3GPP TS 33.180
[26], as they are transferred between the participating MCData function and
the MCData client. Within the XML payload, the list of MCData group ids is
protected as application sensitive data (see clause 4.8). Within the MIKEY
payload, the MuSiK is encrypted using the MCData ID of the served MCData
client. The payload is signed using a key associated to the identity of the
participating MCData function.
To distribute MuSiK, the participating MCData function uses the I_MESSAGE
format from clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS 33.180 [26], which includes associated
parameters. The participating function sets the Status associated parameter to
values defined in clause E.6.9 of 3GPP TS 33.180 [26], namely \"Not-revoked\"
when keying or rekeying and \"Revoked\" when unkeying, respectively. Upon
receipt, the MCData client validates the signature and, if valid, the MCData
client first examines the Status attribute and either marks the associated
security functions as \"not in use\" or stores the MuSiK and the MuSiK-ID, and
then replies with a success code; otherwise, the MCData client can reply with
a failure code. If a success code is not received from the MCData client in
response to the MuSiK download message, the participating MCData function
starts using only unicast towards the respective MCData client for the listed
groups.
The security context is initiated when the MBMS bearer is announced to the
MCData clients. The procedure involves the participating MCData function
creating an MBMS subchannel control key (MSCCK) and a corresponding key
identifier (MSCCK-ID) associated with the MBMS bearer when the MBMS bearer is
activated, and then transferring the MSCCK and the MSCCK-ID associated with
the MBMS bearer to served MCData clients using SIP signalling. The MSCCK is
encrypted using the MCData ID of the served MCData client and domain-specific
material provided from the KMS.
The MSCCK and the MSCCK-ID associated with the MBMS bearer are distributed
within a MIKEY payload within the SDP describing the general purpose MBMS
subchannel of the MBMS bearer. This payload is called a MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE,
as defined in IETF RFC 6509 [55], which ensures the confidentiality, integrity
and authenticity of the payload. The encoding of the MIKEY payload in the SDP
is described in IETF RFC 4567 [45] using an \"a=key-mgmt\" attribute. The
payload is signed using a key associated to the identity of the participating
MCData function. To distribute MSCCK, the participating MCData function uses
the I_MESSAGE format from clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS 33.180 [26], which includes
associated parameters.
The participating function sets the Status associated parameter to values
defined in clause E.6.9 of 3GPP TS 33.180 [26], namely \"Not-revoked\" when
keying or rekeying and \"Revoked\" when unkeying, respectively. Upon receipt,
the MCData client validates the signature and, if the signature is found valid
and the I_MESSAGE contains a Status attribute, the MCData client first
examines the Status attribute and either marks the associated security
functions as \"not in use\" or extracts and stores the encapsulated MSCCK and
the corresponding MSCCK-ID. The decrypted key is used as described in 3GPP TS
33.180 [26]. With the MSCCK successfully shared between the participating
MCData function and the served UEs, the participating MCData function is able
to securely send MBMS subchannel control messages to the MCData clients.
## 4.8 MCData client ID
The MCData client assigns the MCData client ID when the MCData client is used
for the first time. The MCData client generates the MCData client ID as
specified in clause 4.2 of IETF RFC 4122 [25].
The MCData client preserves the MCData client ID:
\- while the MCData client is SIP registered as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229
[5];
\- while the MCData client is not SIP registered as specified in 3GPP TS
24.229 [5] and the UE serving the MCData client is switched on;
\- while the UE serving the MCData client is switched off; and
\- while the UE serving the MCData client is power-cycled.
NOTE: MCData client ID is not preserved when the UE is reset to factory
settings.
## 4.9 Warning Header Field
### 4.9.1 General
The MCData server can include a free text string in a SIP response to a SIP
request. When the MCData server includes a text string in a response to a SIP
MESSAGE or SIP INVITE request the text string is included in a Warning header
field as specified in IETF RFC 3261 [4]. The MCData server includes the
Warning code set to 399 (miscellaneous warning) and includes the host name set
to the host name of the MCData server.
EXAMPLE: Warning: 399 \"200 user not authorised to transmit data\"
### 4.9.2 Warning texts
The text string included in a Warning header field consists of an explanatory
text preceded by a 3-digit text code, according to the following format in
Table 4.9.2-1.
Table 4.9.2-1 ABNF for the Warning text
warn-text =/ DQUOTE mcdata-warn-code SP mcdata-warn-text DQUOTE
mcdata-warn-code = DIGIT DIGIT DIGIT
mcdata-warn-text = *( qdtext \| quoted-pair )
Table 4.9.2-2 defines the warning texts that are defined for the Warning
header field when a Warning header field is included in a response to a SIP
request as specified in clause 4.9.1.

## 4.10 MCData emergency groups and emergency group communications
MCData emergency groups and emergency group communications as defined by 3GPP
TS 23.282 [2] are supported by the procedures in this specification. There are
a number of state variables used to manage MCData emergencies, including:
\- **MCData emergency (MED) state:** in accordance with 3GPP TS 23.282 [2],
indicates (see clause G.4.2) that the MCData user is in a life-threatening
situation. This MCData client state variable is changed via action by the
MCData user of the device or by an authorised MCData user. While the MCData
emergency state is set on the client, all communications originated by the
client will be MCData emergency communications, assuming the MCData user is
authorised for MCData emergency communications.
\- **in-progress emergency group (IPEG) state:** in accordance with 3GPP TS
23.282 [2], this state variable (see clause G.4.3) indicates whether or not
there is an MCData emergency group communication ongoing on the specified
group. This state is managed by the controlling MCData function. All group
communications originated on this MCData group when in an in-progress
emergency state are MCData emergency group communications until this state is
cancelled, regardless of the originator being (or not) in an MCData emergency
state.
\- **MCData emergency group (MDEG) state:** this is an internal state (see
clause G.4.4) managed by the MCData client which tracks the in-progress
emergency state of the group (see 3GPP TS 23.282 [2]) managed by the
controlling MCData function. Ideally, the MCData client would not need to
track the in-progress emergency group state, but doing so enables the MCData
client to request MCData emergency-level priority earlier than otherwise
possible. For example, if the MCData user wishes to join an MCData emergency
group communication and is not in MCData emergency state itself, the MCData
client should have emergency level priority. If it has knowledge of the in-
progress emergency state of the group, it can request priority by including a
Resource-Priority header field set to the MCPTT namespace specified in IETF
RFC 8101 [67], and appropriate priority level in the SIP INVITE request (or
SIP re-INVITE request).
\- **MCData emergency group communication** **(MDEGC) state** : this is an
internal state (see clause G.4.5) corresponding to an ongoing group
communication. The state is managed by the MCData client, which in conjunction
with the MCData emergency alert state (see clause 4.4), aids in managing the
MCData emergency state and related actions.
## 4.11 MCData imminent peril group communications
MCData imminent peril group communications as defined by 3GPP TS 23.282 [2]
are supported by the procedures in this specification. The following MCData
imminent peril group communications functionalities are specified in the
present document:
\- MCData imminent peril group communications origination;
\- upgrade of an MCData group communication to an MCData imminent peril group
communication;
\- upgrade from an MCData imminent peril group communication to an MCData
emergency group communication; and
\- cancellation of the in-progress imminent peril state of the group.
Key aspects of MCData imminent peril include:
\- adjusted EPS bearer priority for all participants when the in-progress
imminent peril state of the group is set whether or not they themselves
initiated an imminent peril group communication. For unicast bearers this is
achieved by using the Resource-Priority header field as specified in IETF RFC
4412 [74] with namespaces defined for use by MCPTT specified in IETF RFC 8101
[67], and for MBMS bearers this is achieved by having the participating MCData
function adjust the ARP (priority, PVI, PCI) and executing the Modify MBMS
Bearer Procedure per 3GPP TS 29.468 [57];
\- restoration of normal EPS bearer priority to the communication when the in-
progress imminent peril group state is cancelled; and
\- requires the MCData user to be authorised to either originate or cancel an
MCData imminent peril group communication.
Relationship to other MCData priority group communication types:
\- A normal MCData group communication can be upgraded to an MCData imminent
peril group communication;
\- An MCData imminent peril group communication can be upgraded to an MCData
emergency group communication;
\- An MCData imminent peril group communication or an MCData emergency group
communication (i.e., their respective \"in-progress\" states) can be
downgraded to a normal MCData group communication, but it is not possible to
directly downgrade an MCData emergency group communication to an MCData
imminent peril group communication;
\- MCData imminent peril functionality is only applicable to MCData group
communications, not MCData private communications; and
\- MCData imminent peril group communications have no associated alert
capabilities such as the MCData emergency alert capability which is associated
with MCData emergency group communications.
There are a number of states that are key in managing these aspects of MCData
imminent peril group communications, which include:
\- **MCData imminent peril group (MDIG) state** : this is an internal state of
the MCData client which in conjunction with the MCData imminent peril group
communication state aids the client in managing the use of the Resource-
Priority header field and related actions.
\- **MCData imminent peril group communication (MIGC) state** : this is an
internal state managed by the MCData client which in conjunction with the
MCData imminent peril group state aids the client in managing the use of the
Resource-Priority header field and related actions.
\- **In-progress imminent peril group (IPIG) state:** this a state of the
MCData group which is managed by the controlling MCData function. While an
MCData group is in an in-progress imminent peril group state, all participants
in group communications using this group will receive elevated priority.
The above states and their transitions are described in Annex G.
## 4.12 MCData emergency private communications
MCData emergency private communications refer to emergency one‑to‑one
communications. The following MCData emergency private communication
functionalities are specified in the present document:
\- MCData emergency private communication origination with optional MCData
emergency alert initiation;
\- upgrade of an MCData private communication to an MCData emergency private;
and
\- cancellation of the MCData emergency private communication priority.
Key aspects of MCData emergency private communications include:
\- adjusted EPS bearer priority for both participants whether or not they are
both in an emergency condition (i.e. both have their MCData emergency state
set). This is achieved by using the Resource-Priority header field as
specified in IETF RFC 4412 [74] with namespaces defined for use by MCPTT
specified in IETF RFC 8101 [67];
\- the initiator of the MCData emergency private communication can override
the other MCData user in the MCData emergency private communication unless
that user also has their MCData emergency state set;
\- restoration of normal EPS bearer priority to the communication according to
system policy (e.g., configured time limit for the emergency priority of an
MCData emergency private communication or cancellation of the emergency
condition of the private communication);
\- requires the MCData user to be authorised to either originate or cancel an
MCData emergency private communication;
\- requires the targeted MCData user to be authorised to receive an MCData
emergency private communication;
\- requests to originate MCData emergency private communications may also
include an indication of an MCData emergency alert; and
There are a number of states that are key in managing these aspects of MCData
emergency private communications, which include:
\- **MCData private emergency alert (MDPEA) state** : this is an internal
state of the MCData client which in conjunction with the MCData emergency
private communication state aids in managing the MCData emergency state and
related actions.
\- **MCData emergency private communication (MDEPC) state** : this is an
internal state managed by the MCData client which in conjunction with the
MCData emergency alert state aids in managing the MCData emergency state and
related actions.
\- **In-progress emergency private communication (IPEPC) state:** indicates
whether or not there is an MCData emergency private communication in-progress
for the two participants. This state is managed by the controlling MCData
function. All private communications originated between these two participants
when in an in-progress emergency private communication state are MCData
emergency private communications until this state is cancelled, whether or not
the originator is in an MCData emergency state.
\- **MCData emergency private priority (MDEPP) state:** this is an internal
state managed by the MCData client which tracks the in-progress emergency
private communication state of the private communication managed by the
controlling MCData function. Ideally, the MCData client would not need to
track the in-progress emergency private priority state, but doing so enables
the MCData client to request MCData emergency-level priority earlier than
otherwise possible. For example, if the MCData user wishes to join an MCData
emergency private communication and is not in the MCData emergency state, the
MCData client should have emergency level priority. If it has knowledge of the
in-progress emergency private priority state of the private communication
(i.e., the two participants), it can request priority by including a Resource-
Priority header field set to the MCPTT namespace specified in IETF RFC 8101
[67], and appropriate priority level in the SIP INVITE request (or SIP re-
INVITE request).
NOTE: The above states and their transitions are described in Annex G.

interconnected MCData system in a different trust domain.
An MCData gateway server acts as an application and security gateway with an
interconnected MCData system in a different trust domain.
An MCData gateway server provides topology hiding to the interconnected MCData
system in a different trust domain.
An MCData gateway server enforces local policies and local security.
An MCData gateway server can be an exit point from its MCData system to an
interconnected MCData system in a different trust domain, an entry point to
its MCData system from an interconnected MCData system in a different trust
domain, or both.
An MCData gateway server is transparent to controlling and participating
MCData functions and to controlling and non-controlling MCData functions. When
required for interconnection, MC gateway servers URIs are known and used by
MCData servers in place of the PSIs of the interconnected MCData server. The
MCData server does not need to know if it finally addresses directly a
controlling MCData function or an intermediate MCData gateway server.
To be compliant with the procedures in the present document, an MCData gateway
server shall:
\- support the MC gateway server procedures defined in 3GPP TS 23.280 [82] and
3GPP TS 23.282 [2]; and

\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\" in the Contact header field of the
SIP 200 (OK) response;
9) if the SIP re-INVITE request was received within an on-demand session,
shall include an SDP answer in the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SDP offer in
the incoming SIP re-INVITE request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] with the
clarifications given in clause 9.2.4.2.2 (for SDS session), or 10.2.5.2.2 (for
FD using media plane), as appropriate;
10) if the SIP re-INVITE request was received within a pre-established
session, shall include an SDP answer in the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SDP
offer in the incoming SIP re-INVITE request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5],
based upon the parameters already negotiated for the pre-established session;
NOTE: The SIP re-INVITE request can be received within an on-demand session or
a pre-established session. If the SIP re-INVITE request is sent within a pre-
established session, the SDP offer for the media parameters is expected to be
the same as was negotiated in the existing pre-established session.
11) shall send the SIP 200 (OK) response towards the MCData server according
to rules and procedures of 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]; and
12) shall interact with the media plane as specified in 3GPP TS 24.582 [15].
#### 6.2.7.5 MCData group in-progress emergency group state cancel
Upon receiving a request from an MCData user to cancel the in-progress
emergency condition on a MCData group on which there is no communication
ongoing, the MCData client shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance
with 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] and IETF RFC 3428 [6] with the clarifications given
below.
NOTE 1: This SIP MESSAGE request is assumed to be sent out-of-dialog.
The MCData client:
1) if the MCData user is not authorised to cancel the in-progress emergency
group state of the MCData group as determined by the procedures of clause
6.2.8.1.7, the MCData client:
a) should indicate to the MCData user that they are not authorised to cancel
the in-progress emergency group state of the MCData group; and
b) shall skip the remaining steps of the current clause;
2) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
(coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]), in a P-Preferred-Service header
field according to IETF RFC 6050 [7] in the SIP MESSAGE request;
3) shall include an Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media
feature tag containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
along with the \"require\" and \"explicit\" header field parameters according
to IETF RFC 3841 [8];
4) may include a P-Preferred-Identity header field in the SIP MESSAGE request
containing the public user identity of the originator as specified in 3GPP TS
24.229 [5];
5) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body as
specified in clause D.1 with the \ element containing the
\ element with:
a) the \ element set to the MCData group identity; and
b) the \ element set to a value of \"false\";
6) if the MCData user has additionally requested the cancellation of an MCData
emergency alert originated by MCData user, shall include an \
element set to a value of \"false\" in the \ element containing
the \ element;
7) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity identifying the
participating MCData function serving the group identity;
8) if the generated SIP MESSAGE request contains an \ element in
the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body, shall set the MCData
emergency alert state to \"MDEA 4: Emergency-alert-cancel-pending\"; and
9) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request according to rules and procedures of
3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
On receipt of a SIP MESSAGE request containing an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body with an \ element set to a value of
\"true\" and an \ matching the MCData client ID included in
the sent SIP MESSAGE request:
1) if an \ element is present in the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of received SIP MESSAGE request
and is set to a value of \"false\":
a) shall set the MCData emergency group state of the group to \"MDEG 1: no-
emergency\".
NOTE 3: The case where an \ element is set to true is possible
but not handled specifically above as it results in no state changes.
2) if the \ element in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body of the received SIP MESSAGE request is set to a value of \"true\"
and if the MCData emergency alert state is set to \"MDEA 4: emergency-alert-
cancel-pending\" and the sent SIP MESSAGE request contained an \
element set to value \"false\" in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body, shall set the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 3: emergency-
alert-initiated\"; and
NOTE 4: It would appear to be an unusual situation for the initiator of an
MCData emergency alert to not be able to clear their own alert. Nevertheless,
an MCData user can be configured to be authorised to initiate MCData emergency
alerts but not have the authority to clear them. Hence, the case is covered
here.
3) if the \ element in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body of the received SIP MESSAGE request is set to a value of \"false\"
and if the MCData emergency alert state is set to \"MDEA 4: emergency-alert-
cancel-pending\" and the sent SIP MESSAGE request contained an \
element set to value \"false\" in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body, shall:
a) set the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 1: no-alert\"; and
b) clear the MCData emergency state if not already cleared.
On receiving a SIP 4xx response, SIP 5xx response or SIP 6xx response to the
sent SIP MESSAGE request, the MCData client:
1) if the received SIP 4xx response, SIP 5xx response or SIP 6xx response
contains an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body as specified in
clause D.1 with the \ element containing the \
element with the \ element set to a value of \"true\" and the sent
SIP MESSAGE request contained an \ element set to value \"false\"
in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body and the MCData emergency
alert state is set to \"MDEA 4: emergency-alert-cancel-pending\", shall set
the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 3: emergency-alert-initiated\".
NOTE 5: In this case, \ element is set to true is possible but
not handled specifically above as it results in no state changes.
### 6.2.8 Priority communication conditions
#### 6.2.8.1 MCData emergency group communication and imminent peril
communication conditions
##### 6.2.8.1.1 SIP INVITE request or SIP REFER request for originating MCData
emergency group communications
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
When the MCData emergency state is set and the MCData user is authorised to
initiate an MCData emergency group communication on the targeted MCData group
as determined by the procedures of clause 6.2.8.1.8, the MCData client:
1) shall include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body in the
SIP INVITE request or SIP REFER request, an \ element set to
\"true\";
2) if the MCData emergency group communication state is set to \"MDEGC 1:
emergency-gc-capable\", shall set the MCData emergency group communication
state to \"MDEGC 2: emergency-communication-requested\";
3) if the MCData user has also requested an MCData emergency alert to be sent
and this is an authorised request for MCData emergency alert as determined by
the procedures of clause 6.2.8.1.6, and the MCData emergency alert state is
set to \"MDEA 1: no-alert\", shall:
a) set the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body to \"true\" and set the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 2:
emergency-alert-confirm-pending\"; and
b) include in the SIP INVITE request the specific location information for
MCData emergency alert as specified in clause 6.2.5.1;
4) if the MCData user has not requested an MCData emergency alert to be sent
and the MCData emergency alert state is set to \"MDEA 1: no-alert\", shall set
the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body
to \"false\"; and
5) if the MCData client emergency group state of the group is set to a value
other than \"MDEG 2: in-progress\", set the MCData client emergency group
state of the MCData group to \"MDEG 4: confirm-pending\".
NOTE 1: This is the case of an MCData user already being in the MCData
emergency state it initiated previously while originating an MCData emergency
group communication or MCData emergency alert. All group communications the
MCData user originates while in MCData emergency state will be MCData
emergency group communications.
When the MCData emergency state is clear and the MCData emergency group
communication state is set to \"MDEGC 1: emergency-gc-capable\" and the the
MCData user is authorised to initiate an MCData emergency group communication
on the targetted MCData group as determined by the procedures of clause
6.2.8.1.8, the MCData client:
1) shall set the MCData emergency state;
2) shall include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body in the
SIP INVITE request or SIP REFER request an \ element set to
\"true\" and set the MCData emergency group communication state to \"MDEGC 2:
emergency-communication-requested\" state;
3) if the MCData user has also requested an MCData emergency alert to be sent
and this is an authorised request for MCData emergency alert as determined by
the procedures of clause 6.2.8.1.6, shall:
a) include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body the \ element set to \"true\" and set the MCData emergency alert state to
\"MDEA 2: emergency-alert-confirm-pending\"; and
b) include in the SIP INVITE request the specific location information for
MCData emergency alert as specified in clause 6.2.5.1;
4) if the MCData user has not requested an MCData emergency alert to be sent,
shall set the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body to \"false\"; and
5) if the MCData client emergency group state of the group is set to a value
other than \"MDEG 2: in-progress\", shall set the MCData client emergency
group state of the MCData group to \"MDEG 4: confirm-pending\".
NOTE 2: This is the case of an initial MCData emergency group communication
and optionally an MCData emergency alert being sent. As the MCData emergency
state is not sent, there is no MCData emergency alert outstanding.
NOTE 3: An MCData group communication originated by an affiliated member of an
MCData group which is in an in-progress emergency state (as tracked on the
MCData client by the MCData client emergency group state), but is not in an
MCData emergency state of their own, will also be an MCData emergency group
communication. The \ and \ elements of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body do not need to be included in
this case and hence, no action needs to be taken in this clause.
##### 6.2.8.1.2 Resource-Priority header field for MCData emergency group
communications
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
If the MCData emergency group communication state is set to either \"MDEGC 2:
emergency-communication-requested\" or \"MDEGC 3: emergency-communication-
granted\" and this is an authorised request for an MCData emergency group
communication as determined by the procedures of clause 6.2.8.1.8, or the
MCData client emergency group state of the group is set to \"MDEG 2: in-
progress\", the MCData client shall include in the SIP INVITE request or SIP
REFER request a Resource-Priority header field populated with the values for
an MCData emergency group communication as specified in clause 6.2.8.1.15.
NOTE: The MCData client ideally would not need to maintain knowledge of the
in-progress emergency state of the group (as tracked on the MCData client by
the MCData client emergency group state) but can use this knowledge to provide
a Resource-Priority header field set to emergency level priority, which starts
the infrastructure priority adjustment process sooner than otherwise would be
the case.
If this is an authorised request to cancel the MCData emergency group
communication as determined by the procedures of clause 6.2.8.1.7, and the
MCData client emergency group state of the group is \"no-emergency\" or
\"cancel-pending\", the MCData client shall include in the SIP INVITE request
or SIP REFER request a Resource-Priority header field populated with the
values for a normal MCData group communication as specified in clause
6.2.8.1.15.
##### 6.2.8.1.3 SIP re-INVITE request for cancelling MCData in-progress
emergency group state
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
If the MCData emergency group communication state is set to \"MDEGC 3:
emergency-communication-granted\" and the MCData emergency alert state is set
to \"MDEA 1: no-alert\", the MCData client shall generate a SIP re-INVITE
request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] with the clarifications given below.
NOTE 1: This procedure assumes that the calling procedure has verified that
the MCData user has made an authorised request for cancelling MCData in-
progress emergency group state of the group.
The MCData client:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body as defined in clause D.1 with the \ element
set to \"false\";
2) shall clear the MCData emergency state; and
3) shall set MCData emergency group state of the MCData group to \"MDEG 3:
cancel-pending\"
NOTE 2: This is the case of an MCData user who has initiated an MCData
emergency group communication and wants to cancel it.
If the MCData emergency group communication state is set to \"MDEGC 3:
emergency-communication-granted\" and the MCData emergency alert state is set
to a value other than \"MDEA 1: no-alert\" and the MCData user has indicated
only the MCData emergency group communication should be cancelled, the MCData
client:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body as defined in clause D.1 with the \ element
set to \"false\"; and
2) shall set the MCData emergency group state of the MCData group to \"MDEG 3:
cancel-pending\".
NOTE 3: This is the case of an MCData user has initiated both an MCData
emergency group communication and an MCData emergency alert and wishes to only
cancel the MCData emergency group communication. This leaves the MCData
emergency state set.
If the MCData emergency group communication state is set to \"MDEGC 3:
emergency-communication-granted\" and the MCData emergency alert state is set
to a value other than \"MDEA 1: no-alert\" and the MCData user has indicated
that the MCData emergency alert on the MCData group should be cancelled in
addition to the MCData emergency group communication, the MCData client:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body as defined in clause D.1 with the \ element
set to \"false\";
2) if this is an authorised request to cancel an MCData emergency alert as
determined by the procedures of clause 6.2.8.1.6, shall:
a) include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body an \ element set to \"false\";
b) set the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 4: Emergency-alert-cancel-
pending\"; and
c) clear the MCData emergency state;
3) should, if this is not an authorised request to cancel an MCData emergency
alert as determined by the procedures of clause 6.2.8.1.6, indicate to the
MCData user that they are not authorised to cancel the MCData emergency alert;
and
4) shall set the MCData emergency group state of the MCData group to \"MDEG 3:
cancel-pending\".
NOTE 4: This is the case of an MCData user that has initiated both an MCData
emergency group communication and an MCData emergency alert and wishes to
cancel both.
##### 6.2.8.1.4 Receiving a SIP 2xx response to a SIP request for a priority
communication
In the procedures in this clause, a priority group communication refers to an
MCData emergency group communication or an MCData imminent peril group
communication.
On receiving a SIP 2xx response to a SIP request for a priority group
communication, the MCData client:
1) if the MCData emergency group communication state is set to \"MDEGC 2:
emergency-communication-requested\" or \"MDEGC 3: emergency-communication-
granted\":
a) shall set the MCData client emergency group state of the group to \"MDEG 2:
in-progress\";
b) if the MCData emergency alert state is set to \"MDEA 2: emergency-alert-
confirm-pending\" and the SIP 2xx response to the SIP request for a priority
group communication does not contain a Warning header field as specified in
clause 4.9 with the warning text containing the mcdata-warn-code set to
\"149\", shall set the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 3: emergency-
alert-initiated\";
c) shall set the MCData emergency group communication state to \"MDEGC 3:
emergency-communication-granted\"; and
d) shall set the MCData imminent peril group communication state to \"MDIGC 1:
imminent-peril-capable\" and the MCData imminent peril group state to \"MDIG
1: no-imminent-peril\"; or
2) if the MCData imminent peril group communication state is set to \"MDIGC 2:
imminent-peril-communication-requested\" or \"MDIGC 3: imminent-peril-
communication-granted\" and the SIP 2xx response to the SIP request for an
imminent peril group communication does not contain a Warning header field as
specified in clause 4.9, with the warning text containing the mcdata-warn-code
set to \"149\":
a) set the MCData imminent peril group communication state to \"MDIGC 3:
imminent-peril-communication-granted\"; and
b) set the MCData imminent peril group state to \"MDIG 2: in-progress\".
##### 6.2.8.1.5 Receiving a SIP 4xx response, SIP 5xx response or SIP 6xx
response to a SIP request for a priority group communication
In the procedures in this clause, a priority group communication refers to an
MCData emergency group communication or an MCData imminent peril group
communication.
Upon receiving a SIP 4xx response, a SIP 5xx response or a SIP 6xx response to
a SIP request for a priority group communication the MCData client:
1) if the MCData emergency group communication state is set to \"MDEGC 2:
emergency-communication-requested\" or \"MDEGC 3: emergency-communication-
granted\":
a) shall set the MCData emergency group communication state to \"MDEGC 1:
emergency-gc-capable\";
b) if the MCData client emergency group state of the group is \"MDEG 4:
confirm-pending\", shall set the MCData client emergency group state of the
group to \"MDEG 1: no-emergency\"; and
c) if the sent SIP request for a priority group communication contained an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with an \ element
set to a value of \"true\", shall set the MCData emergency alert state to
\"MDEA 1: \"no-alert\"; and
2) if the MCData imminent peril group communication state is set to \"MDIGC 2:
imminent-peril-communication-requested\" or \"MDIGC 3: imminent-peril-
communication-granted\":
a) shall set the MCData imminent peril group state to \"MDIG 1: no-imminent-
peril\"; and
b) shall set the MCData imminent peril group communication state to \"MDIGC 1:
imminent-peril-gc-capable\".
##### 6.2.8.1.6 Determining authorisation for initiating or cancelling an
MCData emergency alert
If the MCData client receives a request from the MCData user to send an MCData
emergency alert and:
1) if the \ element of the \ element
of a \ element of the \ element of the MCData user profile
document identified by the MCData ID of the calling MCData user (see the
MCData user profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is set to a value of
\"true\" and the group document (see 3GPP TS 24.481 [11]) of the MCData group
indicated by the MCData user does not contain a \ element that
contains a \ element set to the value \"true\";
and
2) if the \"entry-info\" attribute of the \ element of the
\ element contained within the \ element of the
\ element within MCData user profile document (see the
MCData user profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is set to a value of:
a) \"DedicatedGroup\", and if the \ element of the \ element
of the \ element of the \ element of the
\ element within MCData user profile document (see the
MCData user profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) contains the MCData group
identity of the MCData group targeted by the calling MCData user; or
b) \"UseCurrentlySelectedGroup\" and the \
element of the \ element of a \ element of the \
element of the \ element of the group document identified by the
MCData group identity targeted for the emergency alert is set to a value of
\"true\" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [11];
then the MCData emergency alert request shall be considered to be an
authorised request for an MCData emergency alert. In all other cases, it shall
be considered to be an unauthorised request for originating an MCData
emergency alert.
If the MCData client receives a request from the MCData user to cancel an
MCData emergency alert to an MCData group, and if the \ element of the \ element of a \ element of the
\ element of the MCData user profile document identified by the
MCData ID of the calling MCData user (see the MCData user profile document in
3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is set to a value of \"true\", then the MCData emergency
alert cancellation request shall be considered to be an authorised request to
cancel an MCData emergency alert. In all other cases, it shall be considered
to be an unauthorised request to cancel an MCData emergency alert.
##### 6.2.8.1.7 Determining authorisation for cancelling the in-progress
emergency state of an MCData group
When the MCData client receives a request from the MCData user to cancel the
in-progress emergency state of a group, the MCData client determines, based on
local policy (e.g., if the requester is dispatcher or initiator of the MCData
emergency group communication, etc.), whether to send the emergency group
state cancel request or not.
##### 6.2.8.1.8 Determining authorisation for originating a priority group
communication
When the MCData client receives a request from the MCData user to originate an
MCData emergency group communication the MCData client shall check the
following:
1) if the \ element of the \ element of a
\ element of the \ element of the MCData user profile document
identified by the MCData ID of the calling user (see the MCData user profile
document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is set to a value of \"true\" and
a) if the \"entry-info\" attribute of the \ element of the
\ element of the \ element contained
within the \ element of the MCData user profile document
(see the MCData user profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is set to a
value of \"DedicatedGroup\" and if the \ element of the \
element of the \ element contains the identity of the
MCData group targeted by the calling MCData user; or
b) if the \"entry-info\" attribute of the \ element of the
\ element of the \ element contained
within the \ element of the MCData user profile document
(see the MCData user profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is set to a
value of \"UseCurrentlySelectedGroup\";
then the MCData emergency group communication request shall be considered to
be an authorised request for an MCData emergency group communication only for
SDS session, SDS pre-established session or FD using media plane.
Editor\'s note: The restriction stated above, to limit the authorization for
emergency group communications and/or imminent peril group communication only
to certain types of MCData services is FFS.
In all other cases, the request to originate an MCData emergency group
communication shall be considered to be an unauthorised request to originate
an MCData emergency group communication.
When the MCData client receives a request from the MCData user to originate an
MCData imminent peril group communication the MCData client shall check the
following:
1) if the \ element of the \ element of a
\ element of the \ element of the MCData user profile document
identified by the MCData ID of the calling user (see the MCData user profile
document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is set to a value of \"true\" and:
a) if the \"entry-info\" attribute of the \ element of the
\ element contained within the \
element contained within the \ element of the MCData user
profile document (see the MCData user profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12])
is set to a value of \"DedicatedGroup\" and if the \
element contains the identity of the MCData group targeted by the calling
MCData user; or
b) if the \"entry-info\" attribute of the \ element of the
\ element contained within the \
element contained within the \ element of the MCData user
profile document (see the MCData user profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12])
is set to a value of \"UseCurrentlySelectedGroup\";
then the MCData imminent peril group communication request shall be considered
to be an authorised request for an MCData imminent peril group communication
only for SDS session, SDS pre-established session or FD using media plane.
Editor\'s note: The restriction stated above, to limit the authorization for
emergency group communications and/or imminent peril group communication only
to certain types of MCData services is FFS.
In all other cases, the request to originate an MCData imminent peril group
communication shall be considered to be an unauthorised request to originate
an MCData imminent peril group communication.
##### 6.2.8.1.9 SIP request for originating MCData imminent peril group
communications
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
When the MCData client receives a request from the MCData user to originate an
MCData imminent peril group communication, and this is an authorised request
for an MCData imminent peril group communication as determined by the
procedures of clause 6.2.8.1.8, the MCData client:
1) if the MCData client imminent peril group state is set to \"MDIGC 1:
imminent-peril-gc-capable\" and the in-progress emergency state of the group
is set to a value of \"false\":
a) shall include in the SIP request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body as defined in Annex D.1 with the \ element set to
\"true\" and set the MCData emergency group communication state to \"MDIGC 2:
imminent-peril-call-requested\" state; and
b) if the MCData client imminent peril group state of the group is set to a
value other than \"MDIG 2: in-progress\" shall set the MCData client emergency
group state of the MCData group to \"MDIG 4: confirm-pending\".
NOTE: An MCData group communication originated by an affiliated member of an
MCData group which is in an in-progress imminent peril state (as tracked on
the MCData client by the MCData client imminent peril group state) will also
have the priority associated with MCData imminent peril group communications.
The \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info MIME
body does not need to be included in this case, nor do any state changes
result, and hence no action needs to be taken in this clause.
##### 6.2.8.1.10 Determining authorisation for cancelling an imminent peril
group communication
When the MCData client receives a request from the MCData user to cancel an
MCData imminent peril group communication the MCData client shall:
1) if the \ element of the \ element of
a \ element of the \ element of the MCData user profile
document identified by the MCData ID of the calling user (see the MCData user
profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is set to a value of \"true\" the
MCData imminent peril communication cancellation request shall be considered
to be an authorised request to cancel the MCData imminent peril group
communication; or
2) if the \ element of the \ element of
a \ element of the \ element of the MCData user profile
document identified by the MCData ID of the calling user (see the MCData user
profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is set to a value of \"false\" the
MCData imminent peril communication cancellation request shall be considered
to be an unauthorised request to cancel the MCData imminent peril group
communication.
##### 6.2.8.1.11 SIP re-INVITE request for cancelling MCData in-progress
imminent peril group state
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
If the MCData imminent peril group communication state is set to \"MDIGC 3:
imminent-peril-call-granted\" or the MCData imminent peril group state of the
MCData group is set to \"MDIG 2: in-progress\", the MCData client shall
generate a SIP re-INVITE request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] with the
clarifications given below.
NOTE 1: This procedure assumes that the calling procedure has verified that
the MCData user has made an authorised request for cancelling the in-progress
imminent peril group state of the group.
The MCData client:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body as defined in clause D.1 with the \
element set to \"false\"; and
2) shall set MCData imminent peril group state of the MCData group to \"MDIG
3: cancel-pending\".
NOTE 2: This is the case of an MCData user who has initiated an MCData
imminent peril group communication and wants to cancel it, or another
authorised member of the group who wishes to cancel the in-progress imminent
peril state of the group.
##### 6.2.8.1.12 Resource-Priority header field for MCData imminent peril
group communications
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
When the MCData imminent peril group communication state is set to \"MDIGC 2:
imminent-peril-call-requested\" or \"MDIGC 3: imminent-peril-call-granted\"
and the MCData user is authorised to initiate an MCData imminent peril group
communication on the targeted MCData group as determined by the procedures of
clause 6.2.8.1.8, or the MCData client imminent peril state of the group is
set to \"MDIG 2: in-progress\", the MCData client:
1) shall include in the SIP INVITE request or SIP REFER request a Resource-
Priority header field populated with the values for an MCData imminent peril
group communication as specified in clause 6.2.8.1.15.
NOTE: The MCData client ideally would not need to maintain knowledge of the
in-progress imminent peril state of the group (as tracked on the MCData client
by the MCData client imminent peril group state) but can use this knowledge to
provide a Resource-Priority header field set to imminent peril level priority,
which starts the infrastructure priority adjustment process sooner than
otherwise would be the case.
When the MCData imminent peril group communication state is set to \"MDIGC 1:
imminent-peril-gc-capable\" and the MCData user is authorised to cancel MCData
imminent peril group communications as determined by the procedures of clause
6.2.8.1.10, or the MCData client imminent peril group state of the group is
\"MDIG 1: no-imminent-peril\" or \"MDIG 3: cancel-pending\", the MCData
client:
1) shall include in the SIP INVITE request or SIP REFER request a Resource-
Priority header field populated with the values for a normal MCData group
communication as specified in clause 6.2.8.1.15.
##### 6.2.8.1.13 Receiving a SIP INFO request in the dialog of a SIP request
for a priority group communication
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
Upon receiving a SIP INFO request within the dialog of the SIP request for a
priority group communication:
\- with the Info-Package header field containing the g.3gpp.mcdata-info
package name;
\- with the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body associated with the
info package according to IETF RFC 6086 [21]; and
\- with one or more of the \, \ and \ elements set in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body;
the MCData client:
1) shall send a SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP INFO request as specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [5];
2) if the MCData emergency group communication state is set to \"MDEGC 3:
emergency-call-granted\":
a) if the MCData emergency alert state is set to \"MDEA 2: emergency-alert-
confirm-pending\":
i) if the \ element is set to a value of \"false\", shall set the
MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 1: no-alert\"; and
ii) if the \ element is set to a value of \"true\", shall set the
MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 3: emergency-alert-initiated\";
3) if the MCData imminent peril group communication state is set to \"MDIGC 2:
imminent-peril-call-requested\" or \"MDIGC 3: imminent-peril-call-granted\":
a) if the \ element is set to a value of \"false\" and an
\ element is set to a value of \"true\", shall:
i) set the MCData imminent peril group state to \"MDIG 1: no-imminent-peril\";
ii) set the MCData imminent peril group communication state to \"MDIGC 1:
imminent-peril-capable\"; and
iii) set the MCData client emergency group state of the group to \"MDEG 2: in-
progress\"; and
NOTE 1: This is the case of an MCData client attempting to make an imminent
peril group communication when the group is in an in-progress emergency group
state. The MCData client will then receive a notification that the imminent
peril communication request was denied, however they will be participating at
the emergency level priority of the group. This could occur for example when
an MCData client requests an imminent peril communication to a group that they
are not currently affiliated with.
NOTE 2: the MCData client emergency group state above is the MCData client\'s
view of the in-progress emergency state of the group.
4) if the SIP request for a priority group communication sent by the MCData
client did not contain an \ element and if the MCData emergency
alert state is set to \"MDEA 4: Emergency-alert-cancel-pending\":
a) if the \ element contained in the SIP INFO request is set to a
value of \"true\", shall set the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 3:
emergency-alert-initiated\"; and
b) if the \ element contained in the SIP INFO request is set to a
value of \"false\", shall set the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 1:
no-alert\".
##### 6.2.8.1.14 SIP re-INVITE request for cancelling the in-progress
emergency group state of a group by a third-party
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
Upon receiving an authorised request to cancel an in-progress emergency group
state of a group as determined by the procedures of clause 6.2.8.1.7 from an
MCData user, the MCData client shall generate a SIP re-INVITE request
according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] with the clarifications given below.
The MCData client:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body as defined in clause D.1 with the \ element
set to \"false\";
2) shall set MCData emergency group state of the MCData group to \"MDEG 3:
cancel-pending\"; and
3) if the MCData user has indicated that an MCData emergency alert on the
MCData group originated by another MCData user should be cancelled and this is
an authorised request for an MCData emergency alert cancellation as determined
by the procedures of clause 6.2.8.1.6:
a) shall include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body an
\ element set a value of \"false\"; and
b) shall include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body an
\ element set to the MCData ID of the MCData user who
originated the MCData emergency alert.
NOTE: When an MCData emergency alert is cancelled by a MCData user other than
its originator, the \ element is needed to identify which
MCData emergency alert is being cancelled, as more than one MCData user could
have originated emergency alerts to the same group.
##### 6.2.8.1.15 Retrieving Resource-Priority header field values
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
When determining the Resource-Priority header field MCPTT namespace and
priority values as specified in IETF RFC 8101 [67] to be applied to an MCData
emergency group communication or an MCData emergency private (one-to-one)
communication, the MCData client:
1) shall retrieve the value of the \ element
contained in the \ element of the MCData service
configuration document (see the service configuration document in 3GPP TS
24.484 [12]); and
2) shall retrieve the value of the \ element
contained in the \ element of the MCData service
configuration document (see the service configuration document in 3GPP TS
24.484 [12]).
When determining the Resource-Priority header field MCPTT namespace and
priority values as specified in IETF RFC 8101 [67] to be applied to an MCData
imminent peril group communication, the MCData client:
1) shall retrieve the value of the \ element
contained in the \ element of the MCData
service configuration document (see the service configuration document in 3GPP
TS 24.484 [12]); and
2) shall retrieve the value of the \ element
contained in the \ element of the MCData
service configuration document (see the service configuration document in 3GPP
TS 24.484 [12]).
When determining the Resource-Priority header field MCPTT namespace and
priority values as specified in IETF RFC 8101 [67] to be applied to a normal
MCData group or private (one-to-one) communication, the MCData client:
1) shall retrieve the value of the \ element
contained in the \ element of the MCData service
configuration document (see the service configuration document in 3GPP TS
24.484 [12]); and
2) shall retrieve the value of the \ element
contained in the \ element of the MCData service
configuration document (see the service configuration document in 3GPP TS
24.484 [12]).
NOTE: The \"normal\" Resource-Priority header field value is needed to return
to a normal priority value from a priority value adjusted for an MCData
emergency group or private (one-to-one) communication or an MCData imminent
peril group communication. The \"normal\" priority received from the EPS by
use of the \"normal\" Resource-Priority header field value is expected to be
the same as the \"normal\" priority received from the EPS when initiating a
communication with no Resource-Priority header field included.
##### 6.2.8.1.16 Handling receipt of a SIP re-INVITE request for priority
group communication origination status within a pre-established session
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
Upon receipt of a SIP re-INVITE request within the pre-established session
targeted by the sent SIP REFER request, and if the sent SIP REFER request was
a request for an MCData emergency group communication or an MCData imminent
peril group communication, the MCData client:
1) if the MCData emergency group communication state is set to \"MDEGC 2:
emergency-call-requested\":
a) if there is no \ element or an \ element set
to a value of \"true\" contained in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body received in the SIP re-INVITE request, and if no \ element is included:
i) shall set the MCData client emergency group state of the group to \"MDEG 2:
in-progress\" if it was not already set; and
ii) shall set the MCData emergency group communication state to \"MDEGC 3:
emergency-call-granted\"; and
b) if the MCData emergency alert state is set to \"MDEA 2: emergency-alert-
confirm-pending\":
i) if the SIP re-INVITE request contains an \ element set to a
value of \"true\" or does not contain an \ element, shall set the
MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 3: emergency-alert-initiated\"; or
ii) if the SIP re-INVITE request contains an \ element set to a
value of \"false\", shall set the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 1:
no-alert\"; and
2) if the MCData imminent peril group communication state is set to \"MDIGC 2:
imminent-peril-call-requested:
a) if the sip re-INVITE request contains an \ element set
to a value of \"true\" or does not contain an \ element,
shall:
i) set the MCData imminent peril group communication state to \"MDIGC 3:
imminent-peril-call-granted\"; and
ii) set the MCData imminent peril group state to \"MDIG 2: in-progress\"; or
b) if the SIP re-INVITE request contains \ element set to a
value of \"false\" and an \ element set to a value of \"true\",
shall set the MCData client emergency group state of the group to \"MDEG 2:
in-progress\".
NOTE: This is the case of an MCData client attempting to make an imminent
peril group communication when the group is in an in-progress emergency group
state. The MCData client will then receive a notification that the imminent
peril communication request was denied, however they will be participating at
the emergency level priority of the group. This could occur, for example, when
an MCData client requests an imminent peril communication to a group that they
are not currently affiliated with.
##### 6.2.8.1.17 Priority group communication conditions upon receiving
communication release
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
Upon receiving a request to release the MCData emergency group communication
or an MCData imminent peril group communication in an MCData group session is
in-progress or is in the process of being established:
1) if the MCData emergency group communication state is set to \"MDEGC 2:
emergency-call-requested\":
a) shall set the MCData emergency group communication state to \"MDEGC 1:
emergency-gc-capable\";
b) if the MCData client emergency group state of the group is \"MDEG 3:

imminent-peril-capable\".
##### 6.2.8.1.18 Emergency private (one-to-one) communication conditions upon
receiving communication release
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
Upon receiving a request to release the MCData session when an MCData
emergency private communication is in-progress or is in the process of being
established:
1) if the MCData emergency private communication state is set to \"MDEPC 2:
emergency-call-requested\":
a) shall set the MCData emergency private communication state to \"MDEPC 1:
emergency-pc-capable\";
b) if the MCData emergency private priority state of the private communication

##### 6.2.8.3.6 SIP re-INVITE request for cancelling MCData emergency private
communication state
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
When the MCData emergency private communication state is set to \"MDEPC 3:
emergency-pc-granted\" and the MCData emergency alert state is set to \"MDPEA
1: no-alert\", the MCData client shall generate a SIP re-INVITE request
according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] with the clarifications given below.
NOTE 1: This procedure assumes that the MCData client in the calling procedure
has verified that the MCData user has made an authorised request for
cancelling MCData the in-progress emergency private communication state of the
communication.
The MCData client:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body, as defined in clause D.1, with the \
element set to \"false\";
2) shall clear the MCData emergency state; and
3) shall set MCData emergency private priority state of the MCData emergency
private communication to \"MDEPP 3: cancel-pending\".
NOTE 2: This is the case of an MCData user who has initiated an MCData
emergency private communication and wants to cancel it.
When the MCData emergency private communication state is set to \"MDEPPC 3:
emergency-pc-granted\" and the MCData emergency alert state is set to a value
other than \"MDPEA 1: no-alert\" and the MCData user has indicated only the

element set to \"false\"; and
2) shall set the MCData emergency private priority state of the MCData
emergency private communication to \"MDEPP 3: cancel-pending\";
NOTE 3: This is the case of an MCData user has initiated both an MCData
emergency private communication and an MCData emergency alert and wishes to
only cancel the MCData emergency private communication. This leaves the MCData
emergency state set.
When the MCData emergency private communication state is set to \"MDEPC 3:
emergency-pc-granted\" and the MCData emergency alert state is set to a value
other than \"MDPEA 1: no-alert\" and the MCData user has indicated that the
MCData emergency alert on the MCData private communication should be cancelled
in addition to the MCData emergency private communication, the MCData client:
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body as defined in annex D.1 with the \ element
set to \"false\";
2) shall, if this is an authorised request to cancel an MCData emergency alert
as determined by the procedures of clause 6.2.8.3.1.3:
a) include in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body an \ element set to \"false\"; and
b) set the MCData private emergency alert state to \"MDPEA 4: emergency-alert-
cancel-pending\";
3) if this is not an authorised request to cancel an MCData emergency alert as
determined by the procedures of clause 6.2.8.3.1.3, should indicate to the
MCData user they are not authorised to cancel the MCData emergency alert;
4) shall set the MCData emergency private priority state of the MCData to
\"MDEPP 3: cancel-pending\"; and
5) shall clear the MCData emergency state.
NOTE 4: This is the case of an MCData user that has initiated both an MCData
emergency private communication and an MCData emergency alert and wishes to
cancel both.
##### 6.2.8.3.7 Receiving a SIP INFO request in the dialog of a SIP request
for a priority private communication
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
Upon receiving a SIP INFO request within the dialog of the SIP request for a

initiated\"; and
b) if the \ element is set to a value of \"false\", shall set the
MCData private emergency alert state to \"MDPEA 1: no-alert\".
##### 6.2.8.3.8 SIP re-INVITE request for cancelling the MCData emergency
private communication state by a third-party
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
Upon receiving a request to cancel the MCData emergency private communication
state from an MCData user other than the originator of the MCData emergency
private communication, the MCData client shall generate a SIP re-INVITE
request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], with the clarifications given below.
The MCData client:
NOTE 1: This procedure assumes that the calling procedure has verified that
the MCData user has made an authorised request for cancelling the MCData
emergency private communication state of the communication.
1) shall include in the SIP re-INVITE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body, as defined in clause D.1, with the \

NOTE 2: When an MCData emergency alert is cancelled by a MCData user other
than its originator, the \ element is needed to identify which
MCData emergency alert is being cancelled, as conceivably each participant in
the MCData emergency private communication could have originated an MCData
emergency alert.
##### 6.2.8.3.9 Retrieving a KMS URI associated with an MCData ID
If the MCData client needs to retrieve a KMS URI associated to an identified
MCData ID for on network operation, the MCData client:
1) shall search for the \ entry of the
\ element of the \ element of the \ element within the MCData user profile document (see the MCData
user profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) where the
\ entry includes a \ element
with the \ element containing the identified MCData ID;
a) if the \ entry identified by MCData ID
is found and contains in the \ element a non‑empty \
element, shall retrieve the KMS URI contained therein; or
b) if the \ entry identified by MCData ID
is not found or the \ element is empty, shall retrieve the
\ element of the \ element of the \ element
of the UE initial configuration document (see the UE initial configuration
document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) and consider that to be the KMS URI
associated with the MCData ID.
If the MCData client needs to retrieve a KMS URI associated to an identified
MCData ID for off network operation, the MCData client:
1) shall search for /_\ _/\/Common/OneToOne/UserList/\/Entry/MCDataID
leaf node containing the identified MCData ID (see the MCData user profile MO

the MCData user profile MO in 3GPP TS 24.483 [42]); and
ii) if the MCDataIDKMSURI leaf node in the same
/\/\/Common/OneToOne/UserList/\/Entry/ interior node as the MCDataID
leaf node containing the identified MCData ID is not empty, shall consider its
value to be the KMS URI associated with the MCData ID; and
b) if the identified MCData ID is not found or if the /_\
_/\/Common/OneToOne/UserList/\/Entry/MCDataIDKMSURI leaf node is
empty:
i) shall retrieve /_\ _/OnNetwork/AppServerInfo/KMS leaf node (see the MCS
UE initial configuration document in 3GPP TS 24.483 [42]); and
ii) shall consider the value of the /_\ _/OnNetwork/AppServerInfo/KMS leaf
node to be the KMS URI associated with the MCData ID.

function
This clause is referenced from other procedures.
When generating a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]
and IETF RFC 3428 [6], the partcipating MCData function:
1) shall set the Request-URI of the SIP MESSAGE request to the public service
identity of the controlling MCData function;
NOTE 1: The public service identity can identify the controlling MCData
function in the local MCData system or in an interconnected MCData system.
NOTE 2: If the controlling MCData function is in an interconnected MCData
system in a different trust domain, then the public service identity can
identify the MCData gateway server that acts as an entry point in the
interconnected MCData system from the local MCData system.
NOTE 3: If the controlling MCData function is in an interconnected MCData
system in a different trust domain, then the local MCData system can route the
SIP request through an MCData gateway server that acts as an exit point from
the local MCData system to the interconnected MCData system.
NOTE 4: How the participating MCData function determines the public service
identity of the controlling MCData function serving the target MCData ID or of
the MCData gateway server in the interconnected MCData system is out of the
scope of the present document.

3) shall include a P-Asserted-Identity header field in the SIP MESSAGE request
to the public user identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header field contained
in the received SIP request specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
### 6.3.3 Retrieving a group document
This clause describes how an MCData server accesses a group document from a
group management server.
NOTE 1: The group document for a user or group regroup based on a
preconfigured group is the group document for the preconfigured group
restricted to the users or groups included in the regroup stored by the MCData
server at the time of the regroup creation and does not include a
\ element.
Upon receipt of a SIP request:
1) if the MCData server is not yet subscribed to the group document for the
group identity in the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the SIP request, the MCData
server shall subscribe to the \"xcap-diff\" event-package for the group
document of this group identity as specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [11];
NOTE 2: As a group document can potentially have a large content, the MCData
server can subscribe to the group document indicating support of content-
indirection as defined in IETF RFC 4483 [13], by following the procedures in
3GPP TS 24.481 [11].
2) upon receipt of a SIP 404 (Not Found) response as a result of attempting to
subscribe to the \"xcap-diff\" event-package for the group document of the
group identity in the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the SIP request as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.481 [11], the MCData server shall send the SIP 404 (Not Found)

document of the group identity in the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the SIP INVITE request as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [11], the MCData server shall send the SIP final
response with the warning text set to \"114 unable to retrieve group
document\" in a Warning header field as specified in clause 4.9 and shall not
continue with the rest of the steps;
### 6.3.4 Determining targeted group members for MCData communications
The MCData server shall only send MCData messages to affiliated group members.
The MCData server determines whether a user is affiliated to a group by
following the procedures in clause 6.3.5.
If the group is not a regroup based on a preconfigured group, the MCData
server determines the affiliated members from the entries contained in the
\ element of the group document by following the procedures specified in
clause 6.3.5.
If the group is a regroup based on a preconfigured group, the MCData server
determines the affiliated members from the list of users that was stored
during successful processing of the creation of the regroup per clause 23 by
following the procedures specified in clause 6.3.5.
NOTE 1: The term \"affiliated group members\" used above also includes those
members that are implicitly affiliated by the controlling MCData function.
### 6.3.5 Affiliation check
The MCData server shall determine that the MCData user, with MCData User ID,
is affiliated to the MCData group, with MCData Group ID, at the MCData client,
with MCData client ID, if the elements, as described in clause 8.3.3.2, exist
with their expected values, as below:
1\. an MCData group information entry with MCData group ID same as the MCData
group ID under consideration;
2\. in the MCData group information entry found in 1, an MCData user
information entry with the MCData ID same as the MCData ID under
consideration;
3\. in the MCData user information entry found in 2, an MCData client
information entry with MCData Client ID same as the MCData client ID under
consideration; and
4\. in the MCData user information entry found in 2, an expiration time, which
has not expired.

user (see the MCData user profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is set to a
value other than \"true\" the request for initiating an MCData imminent peril
communication shall be considered to be an unauthorised request for an MCData
imminent peril communication and skip the remaining steps;
2) if the \ element of the \ element
of the group document identified by the targeted MCData group identity is set
to a value other than \"true\" as specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [11], the
request for initiating an MCData imminent peril communication shall be
considered to be an unauthorised request for an MCData imminent peril
communication and skip the remaining steps;
3) if the \"entry-info\" attribute of the \ element of the
\ element contained within the \
element of the MCData user profile document (see the MCData user profile
document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is set to a value of \"DedicatedGroup\" and
if the MCData group identity targeted for the communication is contained in
the \ element of the \ element of the
\ element contained within the \
element (see the MCData user profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]); or
4) if the \"entry-info\" attribute of the \ element of the
\ element contained within the \
element of the MCData user profile document (see the MCData user profile
document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is set to a value of
\"UseCurrentlySelectedGroup\".
then the MCData imminent peril communication request shall be considered to be
an authorised request for an MCData imminent peril communication. In all other
cases, it shall be considered to be an unauthorised request for an MCData
imminent peril communication.

##### 6.3.7.2.7 Generating a SIP 403 response for priority communication
request rejection
If the controlling MCData function has received a SIP request with the
\ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body
is set to \"true\" and this is an unauthorised request for an MCData emergency
communication as determined by the procedures of clause 6.3.7.2.6, the
controlling MCData function shall:
1) include in the SIP 403 (Forbidden) response an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body as specified in Annex D.1 with the \ element
containing the \ element with the \ element set
to a value of \"false\" and the \ element set to a value of
\"false\".
### 6.3.8 Disposition Notifications
#### 6.3.8.1 Generating an FD Notification
In order to generate an FD notification, the participating MCData function:
1) shall generate an FD NOTIFICATION message as specified in clause 15.1.6;
and
2) shall include in the SIP request, the FD NOTIFICATION message in an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-signalling MIME body as specified in clause E.1.
When generating an FD NOTIFICATION message as specified in clause 15.1.6, the
participating MCData function:
1) if sending a file download accept notification, shall set the FD
disposition notification type IE as \"FILE DOWNLOAD REQUEST ACCEPTED\" as
specified in clause 15.2.6;
2) if sending a file download reject notification, shall set the FD
disposition notification type IE as \"FILE DOWNLOAD REQUEST REJECTED\" as
specified in clause 15.2.6;
3) if sending a file download deferred notification, shall set the FD
disposition notification type IE as \"FILE DOWNLOAD REQUEST DEFERRED\" as
specified in clause 15.2.6;
4) shall set the Conversation ID to the value of the Conversation ID that was
received in the FD message as specified in clause 15.2.9;
5) shall set the Date and time IE to the current time as specified in clause
15.2.8; and
6) if sending a file download completed notification:
a) shall set the FD disposition notification type IE as \"FILE DOWNLOAD
COMPLETED\" as specified in clause 15.2.6;
b) shall set the Message ID to the value of the Message ID that was received
in the FD message as specified in clause 15.2.10;
c) if the FD message was destined for the user, shall not include an
Application ID IE as specified in clause 15.2.7 and shall not include a
Extended application ID IE as specified in clause 15.2.24; and

included in the FD message as specified in clause 15.2.3; or
ii) an Extended application ID IE set to the value of the Extended application
ID that was included in the FD message as specified in clause 15.2.24.
## 6.4 Handling of MIME bodies in a SIP message
The MCData client and the MCData server shall support several MIME bodies in
SIP requests and SIP responses.
When the MCData client or the MCData server sends a SIP message and the SIP
message contains more than one MIME body, the MCData client or the MCData
server:
1) shall, as specified in IETF RFC 2046 [21], include one Content-Type header
field with the value set to multipart/mixed and with a boundary delimiter
parameter set to any chosen value;
2) for each MIME body:
a) shall insert the boundary delimiter;
b) shall insert the Content-Type header field with the MIME type of the MIME
body; and
c) shall insert the content of the MIME body;
3) shall insert a final boundary delimiter; and
4) if an SDP offer or an SDP answer is one of the MIME bodies, shall insert
the application/sdp MIME body as the first MIME body.
NOTE: The reason for inserting the application/sdp MIME body as the first body
is that if a functional entity in the underlying SIP core does not understand
multiple MIME bodies, the functional entity will ignore all MIME bodies with
the exception of the first MIME body. The order of multiple MCData application
MIME bodies in a SIP message is irrelevant.
When the MCData client or the MCData server sends a SIP message and the SIP
message contains only one MIME body, the MCData client or the MCData server:
1) shall include a Content-Type header field set to the MIME type of the MIME
body; and
2) shall insert the content of the MIME body.
## 6.5 Confidentiality and Integrity Protection of sensitive XML content
### 6.5.1 General
#### 6.5.1.1 Applicability and exclusions
The procedures in clauses 6.5 apply in general to all procedures described in
clause 9, clause 10, clause 12 and clause 13 with the exception that the
confidentiality and integrity protection procedures for the registration and
service authorisation procedures are described in clause 7.
#### 6.5.1.2 Performing XML content encryption
Whenever the MCData UE includes XML elements or attributes pertaining to the
data specified in clause 4.6 in SIP requests or SIP responses, the MCData UE
shall perform the procedures in clause 6.5.2.3.1.
Whenever the MCData server includes XML elements or attributes pertaining to
the data specified in clause 4.6 in SIP requests or SIP responses, the MCData
server shall perform the procedures in clause 6.5.2.3.2, with the exception
that when the MCData server receives a SIP request with XML elements or
attributes in an MIME body that need to be copied from the incoming SIP
request to an outgoing SIP request without modification, the MCData server
shall perform the procedures specified in clause 6.5.2.5.
NOTE: The procedures in clause 6.5.2.3.1 and clause 6.5.2.3.2 first determine
(by referring to configuration) if confidentiality protection is enabled and
then call the necessary procedures to encrypt the contents of the XML elements
if confidentiality protection is enabled.
#### 6.5.1.3 Performing integrity protection on an XML body
The functional entity shall perform the procedures in this clause just prior
to sending a SIP request or SIP response.
1) The MCData UE shall perform the procedures in clause 6.5.3.3.1; and
2) The MCData server shall perform the procedures in clause 6.5.3.3.2.
NOTE: The procedures in clause 6.5.3.3.1 and clause 6.5.3.3.2 first determine
if integrity protection of XML MIME bodies is required and then calls the
necessary procedures to integrity protect each XML MIME body if integrity
protection is required. Each XML MIME body has its own signature.
#### 6.5.1.4 Verifying integrity of an XML body and decrypting XML elements
Whenever the functional entity (i.e. MCData UE or MCData server) receives a
SIP request or a SIP response, the functional entity shall perform the
following procedures before performing any other procedures.
1) The functional entity shall determine if integrity protection has been
applied to an XML MIME body by following the procedures in clause 6.5.3.4.1
and if integrity protection has been applied:
a) shall use the keying information described in clause 6.5.3.2 and the
procedures described in clause 6.5.3.4.2 to verify the integrity of the XML
MIME body; and
b) if the integrity protection checks fail shall not perform any further
procedures in this clause;
2) The functional entity shall determine whether confidentiality protection
has been applied to XML elements in XML MIME bodies in a SIP request or SIP
response, pertaining to the data specified in clause 4.6, by following the
procedures in clause 6.5.2.4.1, and if confidentiality protection has been
applied:
a) shall use the keying information described in clause 6.5.2.2 along with the
procedures described in clause 6.5.2.4.2 to decrypt the received values; and
b) if any decryption procedures fail, shall not perform any further procedures
in this clause.
### 6.5.2 Confidentiality Protection
#### 6.5.2.1 General
In general, confidentiality protection is applied to specific XML elements and
attributes in XML MIME bodies in SIP requests and responses as specified in
clause 4.6.
Configuration for applying confidentiality protection is not selective to a
specific XML element or attribute of the data described in clause 4.6. If
configuration for confidentiality protection is turned on, then all XML
elements and attributes described in clause 4.6 are confidentiality protected.
If configuration for confidentiality protection is turned off, then no XML
content in SIP requests and SIP responses are confidentiality protected.
#### 6.5.2.2 Keys used in confidentiality protection procedures
Confidentiality protection uses an XPK to encrypt the data which (depending on
who is the sender and who is the receiver of the encrypted information) can be
a CSK or an SPK as specified in clause 4.6. An XPK-ID (CSK-ID/SPK-ID) is used
to key the XPK (CSK/SPK). It is assumed that before the procedures in this
clause are called, the CSK/CSK-ID and/or SPK/SPK-ID are available on the
sender and recipient of the encrypted content as described in clause 4.6.
The procedures in clause 6.5.2.3 and clause 6.5.2.4 are used with a XPK equal
to the CSK and a XPK-ID equal to the CSK-ID in the following circumstances as
described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]:
1) MCData client sends confidentiality protected content to an MCData server;
and
2) MCData server sends confidentiality protected content to an MCData client.
The procedure in clause 6.5.2.3 and clause 6.5.2.4 are used with a XPK equal
to the SPK and a XPK-ID equal to the SPK-ID when the MCData server sends
confidentiality protected content to an MCData server.
#### 6.5.2.3 Procedures for sending confidentiality protected content
##### 6.5.2.3.1 MCData client
If the \ element in the MCData Service
Configuration document as specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12] is set to \"true\"
or no \ element is present in the MCData Service
Configuration document, then sending confidentiality protected content from
the MCData client to the MCData server is enabled, and the MCData client:
1) shall use the appropriate keying information specified in clause 6.5.2.2;
2) shall perform the procedures in clause 6.5.2.3.3 to confidentiality protect
XML elements containing the content described in clause 4.6; and
3) shall perform the procedures in clause 6.5.2.3.4 to confidentiality protect
URIs in XML attributes for URIs described in clause 4.6.
If the \ element in the MCData Service
Configuration document as specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12] is set to
\"false\", then sending confidentiality protected content from the MCData
client to the MCData server is disabled, and content is included in XML
elements and attributes without encryption.
##### 6.5.2.3.2 MCData server
If the \ element in the MCData Service
Configuration document as specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12] is set to \"true\"
or no \ element is present in the MCData Service
Configuration document, then sending confidentiality protected content from
the MCData server to the MCData client is enabled. If the \ element of the \ element is set
to \"true\" in the MCData Service Configuration document as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.484 [12] or no \ element is present in the
MCData Service Configuration document, then sending confidentiality protected
content between MCData servers is enabled.
When sending confidentiality protected content, the MCData server:
1) shall use the appropriate keying information specified in clause 6.5.2.2;
2) shall perform the procedures in clause 6.5.2.3.3 to confidentiality protect
XML elements containing the content described in clause 4.6, and
3) shall perform the procedures in clause 6.5.2.3.4 to confidentiality protect
URIs in XML attributes for URIs described in clause 4.6.
If the \ element in the MCData Service
Configuration document as specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12] is set to
\"false\", then sending confidentiality protected content from the MCData
server to the MCData client is disabled, and then content is included in XML
elements and attributes without encryption.
If the \ element of the \ element in the MCData Service Configuration document as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12] is set to \"false\", then sending
confidentiality protected content between MCData servers is disabled, and
content is included in XML elements and attributes without encryption.
##### 6.5.2.3.3 Content Encryption in XML elements
The following procedures shall be performed by an MCData client or an MCData
server:
1) perform encryption as specified in W3C: \"XML Encryption Syntax and
Processing Version 1.1\", https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlenc-core1/ [28] clause 4.3,
using the \"AES-128-GCM algorithm HMAC\" as the encryption algorithm and the
XPK as the key; and
2) follow the semantic for the element of the MIME body as described in Annex
F of the present document, to include the encrypted content in the MIME body
ensuring that the necessary XML elements required for confidentiality
protection are included as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26].
##### 6.5.2.3.4 Attribute URI Encryption
The following procedures shall be performed by an MCData client or an MCData
server:
1) perform encryption as specified in [aes-gcm], using the \"AES-128-GCM
algorithm HMAC\" as the encryption algorithm and the XPK as the key, with a 96
bit randomly selected IV; and
2) replace the URI to be protected in the attribute by a URI constructed as
follows:
a) the URI schema is \"\";
b) the first part of the userinfo part is the base64 encoded result of the
encryption of the original attribute value;
c) the string \";iv=\" is appended to the result of step b);
d) the base64 encoding of the IV (section 5 of IETF RFC 4648 [30]) is appended
to the result of step c);
e) the string \";key-id=\" is appended to the result of step d);
f) the base64 encoding of the XPK-ID according to 3GPP 33.180 [26] is appended
to the result of step e);
g) the string \";alg=128-aes-gcm\" is appended to the result of step f); and
h) the string \"@\" followed by the domain name for MC Services
confidentiality protection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [31] is appended to
the result of step g).
#### 6.5.2.4 Procedures for receiving confidentiality protected content
##### 6.5.2.4.1 Determination of confidentiality protected content
The following procedure is used by the MCData client or MCData server to
determine if an XML element is confidentiality protected.
1) if an XML element contains the \ XML element, then the
content of the XML element is confidentiality protected; and
2) if an XML element does not contain the \ XML element, then
the content of the XML element is.not confidentiality protected.
The following procedure is used by the MCData client or MCData server to
determine if a URI in the XML attribute is confidentiality protected.
1) if an XML attribute is a URI with the domain name for MC Services
confidentiality protection as specified in the 3GPP TS 23.003 [31], then the
URI is confidentiality protected; and
2) if an XML attribute is a URI without the domain name for MC Services
confidentiality protection as specified in the 3GPP TS 23.003 [31], then the
URI is not confidentiality protected.
##### 6.5.2.4.2 Decrypting confidentiality protected content in XML elements
The following procedure shall be performed by an MCData client or an MCData
server to decrypt an individual XML element that has a type of \"encrypted\"
within an XML MIME body:
1) if the \ XML element or any of its sub-elements as described
in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26] are not present in the MIME body then send a SIP 403
(Forbidden) response with the warning text set to \"140 unable to decrypt XML
content\" in a Warning header field as specified in clause 4.9, and exit this
procedure. Otherwise continue with the rest of the steps;
2) perform decryption on the \ element as specified in W3C:
\"XML Encryption Syntax and Processing Version 1.1\",
https://www.w3.org/TR/xmlenc-core1/ [28] clause 4.4 to decrypt the contents of
the \ element contained within the \ element;
3) if the decryption procedure fails, then send a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response
with the warning text set to \"140 unable to decrypt XML content\" in a
Warning header field as specified in clause 4.9. Otherwise continue with the
rest of the steps; and
4) return success of this procedure together with the decrypted XML element.
##### 6.5.2.4.3 Decrypting confidentiality protected URIs in XML attributes
The following procedure shall be performed by an MCData client or an MCData
server to decrypt a URI in an attribute in a XML document:
1) the value between \";iv=\" and the next \";\" provides the base64 encoded
value of the 96 bit IV and the value between \";=key-id\" and the next \";\"
defines the key which has been used for encryption, i.e. \"CSK\" or \"SPK\";
and
2) the original URI is obtained by decrypting the base64 encoded string
between the \"\" URI prefix and the next \";\" using the \"AES-128-GCM
algorithm HMAC\" as the decryption algorithm with IV and key as determined in
step 1). This value replaces the encrypted URI as the value of the XML
attribute.
#### 6.5.2.5 MCData server copying received XML content
The following procedure is executed when an MCData server receives a SIP
request containing XML MIME bodies, where the content needs to be copied from
the incoming SIP request to the outgoing SIP request.
The MCData server:
1) shall copy the XML elements from the XML MIME body of the incoming SIP
request that do not contain a \ XML element, to the same XML
body in the outgoing SIP request;
2) for each encrypted XML element in the XML MIME body of the incoming SIP
request as determined by clause 6.5.2.4.1:
a) shall use the keying information described in clause 6.5.2.2 to decrypt the
content within the XML element by following the procedures specified in clause
6.5.2.4.2, and shall continue with the steps below if the encrypted XML
element was successfully decrypted;
b) if confidentiality protection is enabled as specified in clause 6.5.2.3.2,
then for each decrypted XML element:
i) shall re-encrypt the content within the XML element using the keying
information described in clause 6.5.2.2 and by following the procedures
specified in clause 6.5.2.3.3; and
ii) shall include the re-encrypted content into the same XML MIME body of the
outgoing SIP request; and
c) if confidentiality protection is disabled as specified in clause 6.5.2.3.2,
shall include the decrypted content in the same XML MIME body of the outgoing
SIP request.
3) for each encrypted XML URI attribute in the XML MIME body of the incoming
SIP request as determined by clause 6.5.2.4.1:
a) shall use the keying information described in clause 6.5.2.2 to decrypt the
URI value of the XML attribute by following the procedures specified in clause
6.5.2.4.3, and shall continue with the steps below if the encrypted XML
attribute value was successfully decrypted;
b) if confidentiality protection is enabled as specified in clause 6.5.2.3.2,
then for each decrypted XML element:
i) shall re-encrypt the URI value of the XML attribute using the keying
information described in clause 6.5.2.2 and by following the procedures
specified in clause 6.5.2.3.4; and
ii) shall include the re-encrypted attribute value into the same XML MIME body
of the outgoing SIP request; and
c) if confidentiality protection is disabled as specified in clause 6.5.2.3.2,
shall include the decrypted value in the same XML MIME body of the outgoing
SIP request.
### 6.5.3 Integrity Protection of XML documents
#### 6.5.3.1 General
Integrity protection can be applied to a whole XML MIME body. When integrity
protection is enabled, all XML MIME bodies transported in SIP requests and
responses are integrity protected. The following XML MIME bodies used in the
present specification in SIP signalling can be integrity protected:
\- application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml;
\- application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml;
\- application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-info+xml;
\- application/poc-settings+xml;
\- application/resources-list+xml;
\- application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-affiliation-command+xml;
\- application/pidf+xml; and
\- application/xcap-diff+xml.
If integrity protection is enabled, and one or more of the XML MIME bodies
complying to the types listed above are included in a SIP request or SIP
response, then a MIME body of type application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-signed+xml
specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [10] is included in the SIP request or SIP
response containing one or more signatures pointing to those XML MIME bodies
as illustrated in Figure 6.5.3.1-1.
In order to integrity protect the XML MIME bodies listed above in this clause
in SIP requests and SIP responses, the MCData client and MCData server shall,
for each MIME body, include the Content-ID header field as specified in IETF
RFC 2045 [32] containing a Content-ID (\"cid\") Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
as specified in IETF RFC 2392 [33].
Figure 6.5.3.1-1: Integrity Protection of XML MIME bodies in SIP requests and
SIP responses
Each MIME body that is integrity protected is assigned a unique signature.
Configuration for applying integrity protection is not selective to a specific
MIME body. If configuration for integrity protection is turned on, then all
XML MIME bodies in SIP requests and responses are integrity protected. If
configuration for integrity protection is turned off, then no XML MIME bodies
in SIP requests and SIP responses are integrity protected.
#### 6.5.3.2 Keys used in integrity protection procedures
Integrity protection uses an XPK to sign the data which (depending on who is
the sender and who is the receiver of the signed information) can be a CSK or
an SPK as specified in clause 4.6. An XPK-ID (CSK-ID/SPK-ID) is used to key
the XPK (CSK/SPK). It is assumed that before the procedures in clause 6.5.3.3
and clause 6.5.3.4 are called, the CSK/CSK-ID and/or SPK/SPK-ID are available
on the sender and recipient of the integrity protected content, as described
in clause 4.6.
The procedures in clause 6.5.3.3 and clause 6.5.3.4 shall be used with a XPK
equal to the CSK and a XPK-ID equal to the CSK-ID in the following
circumstances as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]:
1) MCData client sends integrity protected content to an MCData server; and
2) MCData server sends integrity protected content to an MCData client.
The procedure in clause 6.5.3.3 and clause 6.5.3.4 shall be used with a XPK
equal to the SPK and a XPK-ID equal to the SPK-ID when the MCData server sends
integrity protected content to an MCData server
#### 6.5.3.3 Sending integrity protected content
##### 6.5.3.3.1 MCData client
If the \ element in the MCData Service Configuration
document as specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12] is set to \"true\" or no
\ element is present in the MCData Service Configuration
document, then sending integrity protected content from the MCData client to
the MCData server is enabled, and the MCData client shall use the appropriate
keying information specified in clause 6.5.3.2 and shall perform the
procedures in clause 6.5.3.3.3 to integrity protect XML MIME bodies.
NOTE: Each XML MIME body is integrity protected separately.
If the \ element in the MCData Service Configuration

##### 6.5.3.3.3 Integrity protection procedure
The following procedure shall be performed by the MCData client and MCData
server to integrity protect the XML bodies defined by the MIME types listed in
clause 6.5.3.1:
1) include a Content-Type header field set to \"application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-
signed+xml\" defined in 3GPP TS 24.379 [10];
2) for each of the MIME types defined in clause 6.5.3.1 where the content
defined by these MIME types is to be integrity protected:
a) perform reference generation as specified in W3C: \"XML Signature Syntax
and Processing (Second Edition)\", http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core [29]
clause 3.1.1 using the SHA256 algorithm to produce a hash of the MIME body and
continue with the procedures below if reference generation is successful;
b) perform signature generation as specified in W3C: \"XML Signature Syntax
and Processing (Second Edition)\", http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core [29]
clause 3.1.2 using the HMAC-SHA256 signature method and the XPK as the key and
continue with the procedures below if signature generation is successful; and
3) follow the schema defined in Annex F.6.2 and the semantic described in
Annex F.6.3 to create the application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-signed+xml MIME body,
defined in 3GPP TS 24.379 [10], containing signatures referring to the XML
MIME bodies included in the SIP request or SIP response.
#### 6.5.3.4 Receiving integrity protected content
##### 6.5.3.4.1 Determination of integrity protected content
The following procedure is used by the MCData client or MCData server to
determine if an XML MIME body is integrity protected.
1) if the \ XML element is not present in the XML MIME body, then
the content is not integrity protected; and
2) if the \ XML element is present in the XML MIME body, then the
content is integrity protected.
##### 6.5.3.4.2 Verification of integrity protected content
The following procedure is used by the MCData client or MCData server to
verify the integrity of an XML MIME body:
1) if the required sub-elements of the \ as described in 3GPP TS
33.180 [26] are not present in the MIME body and if not present, are not known
to the sender and recipient by other means, then the integrity protection
procedure fails and exit this procedure. Otherwise continue with the rest of
the steps;
2) perform reference validation on the \ element as specified in
W3C: \"XML Signature Syntax and Processing (Second Edition)\",
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core [29] clause 3.2.1;
3) if reference validation fails, then send a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response
towards the functional entity with the warning text set to: \"139 integrity
protection check failed\" in a Warning header field as specified in clause
4.9, and do not continue with the rest of the steps in this clause;
4) obtain the XPK using the XPK-ID in the received XML body and use it to
perform signature validation of the value of the \ element as
specified in W3C: \"XML Signature Syntax and Processing (Second Edition)\",
http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core [29] clause 3.2.2;
5) if signature validation fails, then send a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response
towards the functional entity with the warning text set to: \"139 integrity
protection check failed\" in a Warning header field as specified in clause
4.9, and do not continue with the rest of the steps in this clause; and
6) return success of the integrity protection of the XML document passes the
integrity protection procedure.
## 6.6 Confidentiality and Integrity Protection of TLV messages
### 6.6.1 General
Signalling plane provides confidentiality and integrity protection for the
MCData Data signalling and MCData Data messages sent over the signalling
plane. Signalling plane security also provides the authentication of MCData
Data messages.
The signalling plane security is based on 3GPP MCData security solution
including key management and end-to-end protection as defined in 3GPP TS
33.180 [26].
Various keys and associated key identifiers protect the MCData Data signalling
and MCData Data messages carried on the signalling plane.
The MCData Data signalling messages may be:
1\. SDS SIGNALLING PAYLOAD;
2\. FD SIGNALLING PAYLOAD;
3\. SDS NOTIFICATION;
4\. FD NOTIFICATION;
5\. FD NETWORK NOTIFICATION;
6\. COMMUNICATION RELEASE;
7\. SDS OFF-NETWORK MESSAGE; or
8\. SDS OFF-NETWORK NOTIFICATION.
The MCData Data messages may be:
1\. DATA PAYLOAD.
In an on-network MCData communication for an MCData group, if protection of
MCData Data messages is negotiated, the GMK and the GMK-ID of the MCData group
protect the MCData Data messages sent and received by MCData clients;
In an on-network one-to-one MCData communications, if protection of MCData
Data messages is negotiated, the PCK and the PCK-ID protect the MCData Data
messages sent and received by MCData clients;
If protection of MCData Data signalling messages sent using unicast between
the MCData client and the participating MCData function serving the the MCData
client is negotiated, the CSK and the CSK-ID protect the MCData Data
signalling messages sent and received using unicast by the MCData client and
by a participating MCData function;
If protection of MCData Data signalling messages between the participating
MCData function and the controlling MCData function is configured, the SPK and
the SPK-ID protect the MCData Data signalling messages sent and received
between the participating MCData function and the controlling MCData function;
and
If protection of MCData is configured for an on-network MBMS MCData
communication, a MuSiK and the corresponding MuSiK-ID may be used to protect
transmissions on an MBMS bearer to and from MCData clients.
The GMK and the GMK-ID are distributed to the MCData clients using the group
document subscription and notification procedure specified in 3GPP TS 24.481
[11].
The PCK and the PCK-ID are generated by the MCData client initiating the
standalone SDS using signalling control plane or standalone one-to-one SDS
using media plane or one-to-one SDS session or one-to-one FD using media plane
and provided to the MCData client receiving the SIP signalling.
The CSK and the CSK-ID are generated by the MCData client and provided to the
participating MCData function serving the MCData client using SIP signalling.
The SPK and the SPK-ID are configured in the participating MCData function and
the controlling MCData function.
The MuSiK and the MuSiK-ID are distributed to the MCData clients as described
in clause 19.
The key material for creating and verifying the authentication signature (SSK,
PVT and KPAK) is provisioned to the MCData clients by the KMS as specified in
3GPP TS 33.180 [26].
### 6.6.2 Derivation of master keys for media and media control
Each MCData Payload Protection Key (DPPK) (i.e. GMK, PCK, CSK, SPK) and its
associated key identifier DPPK-ID (i.e. GMK-ID, PCK-ID, CSK-ID, SPK -ID)
described in clause 6.6.1 are used to derive a MCData Payload Cipher Key
(DPCK) and its associated DPCK-ID as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26].
DPCK and DPCK-ID are used in the protection of MCData Data signalling and
MCData Data messages as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26].
### 6.6.3 Protection of MCData Data signalling and MCData Data messages
#### 6.6.3.1 General
The MCData Data messages may be encrypted and integrity protected. When
encryption is applied to the entire message the MCData Data message shall be
encrypted as specified in clause 8.5.4 in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]. When encryption
is applied to the Payload IEs of the MCData Data message the Payload IEs shall
be encrypted as specified in clause 8.5.4 in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26].
The MCData Data signalling messages may be encrypted and integrity protected .
When encryption is applied the MCData Data signalling shall be encrypted as
specified in clause 8.5.4 in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26].
The MCData Data messages and the protected MCData Data messages may also be
end-to-end authenticated as specified in clause 8.5.5 in 3GPP TS 33.180 [15].
The MCData Protected Payload message as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]
inherits the message type from the MCData Data signalling messages and the
MCData Data messages with bits 7, 8 set according to clause 8.5.1 of 3GPP TS
33.180 [26] when entire MCData Data signalling messages and the MCData Data
messages protected.
#### 6.6.3.2 The MCData client
A MCData client transmitting MCData Data messages shall protect the MCData
Data messages using the related DPPK and DPPK-ID according to the negotiatd
protection method. For one-to-one communications PCK and PCK-ID shall be used
as DPPK and DPPK-ID. For group communications GMK and GMK-ID shall be used as
DPPK and DPPK-ID.
A MCData client transmitting MCData Data messages shall use the key material
provisioned by the KMS when generating the authentication signature.
A MCData client which receives protected MCData Data messages shall decrypt
and authenticate the protected MCData Data messages using the related DPPK and
DPPK-ID according to the negotiated protection method.
A MCData client which receives signed MCData Data messages shall verify the
signature using the signature, the identity of the originating MCData client
and the KPAK provisioned by the KMS.
A MCData client transmitting MCData Data signalling messages shall encrypt the
MCData Data signalling messages using CPK and CPK-ID if MCData Data signalling
messages protection is negotiated.
A MCData client which receives encrypted MCData Data signalling messages shall
decrypt the media control using CPK and CPK-ID.
#### 6.6.3.3 The participating MCData function
A participating MCData function which receives protected MCData Data messages
shall forward it to the next entity without any additional action related to
the security framework.
A participating MCData function, when receiving an encrypted MCData Data
signalling messages from a MCData client shall decrypt the encrypted MCData
Data signalling messages using the CSK and CSK-ID negotiated with the MCData
client which has sent the MCData Data signalling message. Then, the
participating MCData function shall forward the MCData Data signalling
messages to the controlling MCData function by encrypting the MCData Data
signalling messages using SPK and SPK-ID, if protection is configured between
the participating MCData function and the controlling MCData function.
A participating MCData function, when receiving an encrypted MCData Data
signalling messages from the controlling MCData function shall decrypt the
encrypted MCData Data signalling messages using the SPK and SPK-ID configured
between the participating MCData function and the controlling MCData function.
Then, the participating MCData function shall forward the MCData Data
signalling messages to the destination MCData client using the CSK and CSK-ID
if protection is negotiated between the participating MCData function and the
MCData client.
#### 6.6.3.4 The controlling MCData function
A controlling MCData function which receives protected MCData Data messages
shall forward it to the next entity without any additional action related to
the security framework.
A controlling MCData function, when receiving an encrypted MCData Data
signalling messages from a participating MCData function shall decrypt the
encrypted MCData Data signalling messages using the SPK and SPK-ID configured
between the participating MCData function and the controlling MCData function.
Then, the controlling MCData function shall forward the MCData Data signalling
messages to the participating MCData function serving the destination MCData
client by encrypting the MCData Data signalling messages using SPK and SPK-ID,
if protection is configured between the participating MCData function and the
controlling MCData function.
## 6.7 Stored files operational procedures
### 6.7.1 General
This clause describes the various operational procedures (e.g. retrieval of a
file, retrieval of a file\'s metadata, checking the availability of a file) of
the stored files for the general clients. The following procedures are common
for the functional entities which are required to fulfil the operational
requirements using the HTTP interface and support the role of both HTTP Client
and HTTP Server as defined in annex A of 3GPP TS 24.482 [24].
### 6.7.2 Retrieve the stored file procedure

## 6.8 Procedures at the MCData gateway
### 6.8.1 General
As described in clause 5.4, the MCData gateway servers are inserted in the
path between MCData functions that reside in MCData systems from different
trust domains.
This clause specifies the behavior of an MCData gateway server that acts as an
exit point from an MCData system or as an entry point in an MCData system.
Local policies enforcement covers a wide variety of actions that are left to
implementation. An example of local policies enforcement is given in clause
6.8.4.
### 6.8.2 MCData gateway server acting as an exit point from an MCData system
When acting as an exit point from a local MCData system to an interconnected
MCData system, the MCData gateway server receives SIP requests and SIP
responses intended for the controlling, non-controlling or participating
function in the interconnected MCData system.
When receiving an outgoing SIP message, the MCData gateway server acting as an
exit point:
1) shall identify the MCData system identity of the interconnected MCData
system from information elements in the outgoing SIP message, e.g. the
Request-URI;
2) may enforce local policy, and if local policy enforcement results in
rejecting a SIP request (e.g. not having a mutual aid relationship), the
MCData gateway shall reject the request by sending back a SIP 403 (Forbidden)
response including a warning text \"1xx service not authorized with the
interconnected system\", and the MCData gateway server shall not continue with
the rest of the steps;
3) may replace in the outgoing SIP message any addressing information linked
to the local MCData system topology with its own addressing information; this
includes;
a) the P-Asserted-Identity header field may be set to the MCData gateway
server\'s own URI; and
b) the Request-URI may be set to the public service identity of the targeted
function in the interconnected MCData system, or to the URI of the MCData
gateway server that acts as an entry point in the interconnected MCData
system; and
NOTE: How the MCData gateway server determines the public service identity of
the targeted MCData function in the interconnected MCData system or the URI of
the MCData gateway server in the interconnected MCData system is out of the
scope of the present document.
4) shall forward the outgoing SIP message according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
### 6.8.3 MCData gateway server acting as an entry point in an MCData system
When acting as an entry point in an MCData system from an interconnected
MCData system, the MCData gateway receives SIP requests and SIP responses
intended for the controlling, non-controlling or participating function in the
local MCData system.
When receiving an incoming SIP message, the MCData gateway server acting as an
entry point:
1) shall identify the MCData system identity of the interconnected MCData
system from the P-Asserted-Identity header field of the incoming SIP messages;
2) may enforce local policy and. if local policy enforcement results in
rejecting a SIP request (e.g. not having a mutual aid relationship), the
MCData gateway shall reject the request by sending back a SIP 403 (Forbidden)
response including a warning text \"180 service not authorized by the
interconnected system\", and the MCData gateway server shall not continue with
the rest of the steps;
3) should replace in the incoming SIP message its own addressing information
with the addressing information of the targeted MCData function in the local
MCData system:
a) the Request-URI should be set to the public service identity of the
targeted MCData function in the local MCData system; and
NOTE: How the MCData gateway server determines the public service identity of
the targeted MCData function in the local MCData system is out of the scope of
the present document.
4) shall forward the incoming SIP message according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
### 6.8.4 Local policies enforcement
Below is one example of local policy enforcement that can be handled by an
MCData gateway server.
If an MCData gateway server acting as an exit point receives a SIP request or
a SIP response that contains sensitive information that cannot be exposed to
the targeted interconnected system based on local policies but does not
prevent the service from being delivered (e.g. a functional alias), the MCData
gateway server can remove that information from the outgoing SIP message
before forwarding it.
# 7 Registration and service authorisation
## 7.1 General
This clause describes the procedures for SIP registration and MCData service
authorization for the MCData client and the MCData service. The MCData UE can
use SIP REGISTER or SIP PUBLISH for MCData service settings to perform service
authorization for MCData. The decision which method to use is based on
implementation and on availability of an access-token received as outcome of
the user authentication procedure as described in 3GPP TS 24.482 [24].
If another MC service client (e.g. MCPTT, MCVideo) is operating at the same
time on the same MC UE as the MCData client, then the MCData client shares the
same SIP registration as the other MC service clients. The SIP REGISTER
procedures in this clause are combined with the SIP REGISTER procedures for
the other operating MC service clients to create a single SIP REGISTER
request. If other MC service clients are already operating when the MCData
client registers then a re-registration is performed containing the parameters
for the other operating MC services.
Although the access-token can be the same for the MCData service as for other
MC services when performing service authorization for MCData along with other
MC services using SIP REGISTER multipart MIME bodies for each MC service are
included in the SIP REGISTER request. The MCData server can therefore receive
multipart MIME bodies in the SIP REGISTER request. Multiple contact addresses
(one per MC service client) can be included in a SIP REGISTER request provided
they all contain the same IP address and port number (see 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]
for further details of including multiple contact addresses in a single SIP
REGISTER request).
If the MCData client logs off from the MCData service but other MC service
clients are to remain registered the MC UE performs a re-registration as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] without the supported g.3gpp.mcdata media
feature tags and the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tags containing the values
of the supported MCData service ICSIs in the Contact header field of the SIP
REGISTER request but with the parameters for the remaining operating MC
service clients.
## 7.2 MCData client procedures
### 7.2.1 SIP REGISTER request for service authorisation
When the MCData client performs SIP registration for service authorisation the
MCData client shall perform the registration procedures as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.229 [5].
The MCData client shall include the following media feature tags in the
Contact header field of the SIP REGISTER request:
1) the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the value of
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\";
2) if SDS is supported then:
a) the g.3gpp.mcdata.sds media feature tag; and
b) the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the value of
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\"; and
3) if FD service is supported then:
a) the g.3gpp.mcdata.fd media feature tag; and
b) the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the value of
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.fd\".
NOTE 1: If the MCData client logs off from the MCData service but the MCData
UE remains registered the MCData UE performs a re-registration as specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [5] without the supported g.3gpp.mcdata media feature tags and
the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the supported MCData service
ICSIs in the Contact header field of the SIP REGISTER request.
If the MCData client, upon performing SIP registration:
1) has successfully finished the user authentication procedure as described in
3GPP TS 24.482 [24];
2) has available an access-token;
3) based on implementation decides to use SIP REGISTER for service
authorization;
4) confidentiality protection is disabled as specified in clause 6.5.2.3.1;
and
5) integrity protection is disabled as specified in clause 6.5.3.3.1;
then the MCData client shall include in the SIP REGISTER request an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body as defined in Annex D.1 with:
1) the \ element set to the value of the access token
received during the user authentication procedures; and
2) the \ element set to the value of the MCData client ID of
the originating MCData client.
NOTE 2: the access-token contains the MCData ID of the user.
If the MCData client, upon performing SIP registration:
1) has successfully finished the user authentication procedure as described in
3GPP TS 24.482 [24];
2) has an available access-token;
3) based on implementation decides to use SIP REGISTER for service
authorization; and
4) either confidentiality protection is enabled as specified in clause
6.5.2.3.1 or integrity protection is enabled as specified in clause 6.5.3.3.1;
then the MCData client:
1) shall include an application/mikey MIME body with the CSK as MIKEY-SAKKE
I_MESSAGE as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26] in the body of the SIP REGISTER
request;
2) if confidentiality protection is enabled as specified in clause 6.5.2.3.1,
shall include in the body of the SIP REGISTER request an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with the following
clarifications:
a) shall encrypt the received access-token using the CSK and include the
\ element set to the encrypted access-token, as specified
in clause 6.5.2.3.1; and
b) shall encrypt the MCData client ID of the originating MCData client using
the CSK and include the \ element set to the encrypted
MCData client ID;
3) if confidentiality protection is disabled as specified in clause 6.5.2.3.1,
shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body as defined in
Annex D.1 with:
a) the \ element set to the value of the access token
received during the user authentication procedures; and
b) the \ element set to the value of the MCData client ID of
the originating MCData client; and
4) if integrity protection is enabled as specified in clause 6.5.3.3.1, shall
use the CSK to integrity protect the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME
body by following the procedures in clause 6.6.3.3.3.
### 7.2.1AA SIP REGISTER request without service authorisation
When the MCData client performs SIP registration without service authorisation
the MCData client shall perform the registration procedures as specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
The MCData client shall include the following media feature tags in the
Contact header field of the SIP REGISTER request:
1) the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the value of
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\";
2) if SDS is supported then:
a) the g.3gpp.mcdata.sds media feature tag; and
b) the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the value of
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\"; and
3) if FD service is supported then:
a) the g.3gpp.mcdata.fd media feature tag; and
b) the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the value of
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.fd\".
NOTE: If the MCData client logs off from the MCData service but the MCData UE
remains registered the MCData UE performs a re-registration as specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [5], without the supported g.3gpp.mcdata media feature tags and
the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag containing the supported MCData service
ICSIs in the Contact header field of the SIP REGISTER request.
### 7.2.1A Common SIP PUBLISH procedure
This procedure is only referenced from other procedures.
When populating the SIP PUBLISH request, the MCData client shall:
1) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity identifying the
participating MCData function serving the MCData user;
2) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
(coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]), in a P-Preferred-Service header
field according to IETF RFC 6050 [7];
3) shall set the Event header field to the \"poc-settings\" value; and
4) shall set the Expires header field according to IETF RFC 3903 [34], to
4294967295, if the MCData user is not removing the MCData service settings,
otherwise to remove the MCData service settings the MCData client shall set
the Expires header field to zero.
NOTE 1: 4294967295, which is equal to 2^32^-1, is the highest value defined
for Expires header field in IETF RFC 3261 [4].
NOTE 2: The expiration timer of the MCData client service settings is only
applicable for the MCData client service settings from the MCData client that
matches the Instance Identifier URN. The expiration timer of MCData user
service settings is also updated in the MCData server if expiration timer of
MCData client service settings is updated in the MCData server.
NOTE 3: Removing the MCData service settings by setting the Expires header
field to zero, logs off the MCData client from the MCData service.
### 7.2.2 SIP PUBLISH request for service authorisation and MCData service
settings
If based on implementation the MCData client decides to use SIP PUBLISH for
MCData server settings to also perform service authorization and
1) has successfully finished the user authentication procedure as described in
3GPP TS 24.482 [24]; and
2) has available an access-token;
then the MCData client:

The MCData client shall send the SIP PUBLISH request according to 3GPP TS
24.229 [5].
On receiving the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP PUBLISH request the MCData
client may indicate to the MCData User the successful communication of the
MCData service settings to the MCData server.
### 7.2.4 Determination of MCData service settings
In order to discover MCData service settings of another MCData client of the
same MCData user or to verify the currently active MCData service settings of
this MCData client, the MCData client shall generate an initial SIP SUBSCRIBE
request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], IETF RFC 6665 [36], and IETF RFC 4354
[35].
In the SIP SUBSCRIBE request, the MCData client:
1) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity identifying the
originating participating MCData function serving the MCData user;
2) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body. In the

7) if the MCData client wants to fetch the current state only, shall set the
Expires header field according to IETF RFC 6665 [36], to zero.
In order to re-subscribe or de-subscribe, the MCData client shall generate an
in-dialog SIP SUBSCRIBE request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], IETF RFC 6665
[36], IETF RFC 4354 [35]. In the SIP SUBSCRIBE request, the MCData client:
1) shall set the Event header field to the \'poc-settings\' value;
2) shall include an Accept header field containing the \"application/poc-
settings+xml\" MIME type;
3) if the MCData client wants to receive the current status and later

MCData client identified by the \"id\" attribute according to IETF RFC 4354
[35] as the current Answer-mode indication of that MCData client; and
2) the \ element of the poc-settings+xml MIME
body for each MCData client identified by the \"id\" attribute according to
IETF RFC 4354 [35] as the active MCData user profile of that MCData client.
### 7.2.5 Receiving a CSK key download message
When the MCData client receives a SIP MESSAGE request containing:
1) a P-Asserted-Service header field containing the \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"; and
2) an application/mikey MIME body;
Then, if the key identifier within the CSB-ID of the MIKEY payload is a CSK-ID
(4 most-significant bits have the value \'2\'), the MCData client:
1) shall follow the security procedures in clause 9.2.1 of 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]
to extract the CSK. The client:
a) if the initiator field (IDRi) has type \'URI\' (identity hiding is not
used), the client:
i) shall extract the initiator URI from the initiator field (IDRi) of the
I_MESSAGE as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]. If the initiator URI deviates
from the public service identity of the participating MCData function serving
the MCData user, shall reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 488 (Not
Acceptable Here) response as specified in IETF RFC 4567 [45], and include
warning text set to \"136 authentication of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE failed\"
in a Warning header field as specified in clause 4.9 and shall not continue
with the rest of the steps; and
ii) shall convert the initiator URI to a UID as described in 3GPP TS 33.180
[26];
b) if the initiator field (IDRi) has type \'UID\' (identity hiding in use),
the client:
i) shall convert the public service identity of participating MCData function
serving the MCData user to a UID as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]; and
ii) shall compare the generated UID with the UID in the initiator field (IDRi)
of the I_MESSAGE as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]. If the two initiator
UIDs deviate from each other, shall reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP
488 (Not Acceptable Here) response as specified in IETF RFC 4567 [45], and
include warning text set to \"136 authentication of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE
failed\" in a Warning header field as specified in clause 4.9 and shall not
continue with the rest of the steps;
c) shall use the UID to validate the signature of the I_MESSAGE as described
in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26];
d) if authentication verification of the I_MESSAGE fails, shall reject the SIP
MESSAGE request with a SIP 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response as specified in
IETF RFC 4567 [45], and include warning text set to \"136 authentication of
the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE failed\" in a Warning header field as specified in
clause 4.9 and shall not continue with the rest of the steps;
e) shall extract and decrypt the encapsulated CSK using the participating
MCData function\'s (KMS provisioned) UID key as described in 3GPP TS 33.180
[26];
f) shall extract and store the algorithm to be used to protect the MCData
signalling fields; and
g) shall extract the CSK-ID, from the payload as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180
[26]; and
2) Upon successful extraction, the client shall replace the existing CSK and
CSK-ID associated with the participating MCData function, with the extracted
CSK and CSK-ID in the \'key download\' message.
## 7.3 MCData server procedures
### 7.3.1 General
The MCData server obtains information that it needs to implement service
authorization specific requirements from:
a) any received third-party SIP REGISTER request (e.g. including information
contained in the body of the third-party SIP REGISTER request) as specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [5]. The body will carry the SIP REGISTER request as sent by
the MCData client and may contain information needed for service
authorization; or
b) any received SIP PUBLISH request for MCData server settings containing the
g.3gpp.mcdata.sds media feature tag along with the \"require\" and
\"explicit\" header field parameters. The body of the SIP PUBLISH request will
contain information needed for service authorization.
### 7.3.1A Confidentiality and Integrity Protection
When the MCData server receives a SIP REGISTER request sent from the MCData
client contained within a message/sip MIME body of a received third-party SIP
REGISTER request or a SIP PUBLISH request, it first determines whether XML
MIME bodies included in the request are integrity protected. If XML MIME
bodies are integrity protected the MCData server validates the signature of
each of the XML MIME bodies. If the integrity protection check(s) pass or the
XML MIME bodies are not integrity protected, the MCData server then determines
whether the content in specific XML elements is confidentiality protected. If
XML content is confidentiality protected, the MCData server decrypts the
protected content.
Upon receiving:
\- a SIP REGISTER request containing an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body within a message/sip MIME body of the SIP REGISTER request sent from
the MCData client; or
\- a SIP PUBLISH request containing an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body and an application/poc-settings+xml MIME body;
the MCData server:
1) shall determine if integrity protection has been applied to XML MIME bodies
in the SIP request by following the procedures in clause 6.5.3.4.1 for each
XML MIME body;
2) if integrity protection has been applied, shall use the keying data
described in clause 6.5.3.2 and the procedures described in clause 6.5.3.4.2
to verify the integrity of each of the XML MIME bodies; and
3) if all integrity protection checks succeed, shall continue with the
remaining steps of this clause.
Upon receiving:
\- a SIP REGISTER request containing an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body with an \ element and an \
element within a message/sip MIME body of the SIP REGISTER request sent from
the MCData client; or
\- a SIP PUBLISH request containing an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body with an \ element and an \
element, and an application/poc-settings+xml MIME body;
the MCData server:
1) shall determine if confidentiality protection has been applied to the
\ element and the \ element in the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body, by following the procedures in
clause 6.5.2.4.1;
2) if confidentiality protection has been applied to the \ element and \ element:
a) shall use the keying information received in the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26], along with the procedures described in
clause 6.5.2.4.2 to:
i) decrypt the received access token in the \ element in
the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body; and
ii) decrypt the received MCData client ID in the \ element
in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body;
b) if the decryption procedure succeeds, shall identify the MCData ID and the
MCData client ID from the decrypted values; and
c) if the decryption procedure fails, shall determine that confidentiality
protection has not been successful;
3) if confidentiality protection has been applied to only one of the \ element or the \ element:
a) shall determine that confidentiality protection has not been successful;
4) if confidentiality protection has not been applied:
a) shall identify the MCData ID from \ element received
in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body; and
b) shall identify the MCData client ID from the \ element
received in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body.
Upon receiving a SIP PUBLISH request containing an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with an \
element, an \ element, and an application/poc-settings+xml
MIME body, the MCData server:
1) shall determine if confidentiality protection has been applied to the
\ element and the \ element in the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body by following the procedures in
clause 6.5.2.4.1;
2) if confidentiality protection has been applied to the \
element and the \ element:
a) shall use the keying information described in clause 6.5.2.2 along with the
procedures described in clause 6.5.2.4.2 to:
i) decrypt the received encrypted MCData ID in the \
element in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body; and
ii) decrypt the received encrypted MCData client ID in the \
element in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body;
b) if all decryption procedures succeed, shall identify the MCData ID and
MCData client ID from the decrypted values; and
c) if the decryption procedure fails, shall determine that confidentiality
protection has not been successful;
3) if confidentiality protection has been applied to only one of the \ element or \ element:
a) shall determine that confidentiality protection has not been successful;
4) if confidentiality protection has not been applied:
a) shall identify the MCData ID from the contents of the \
element in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body; and
b) shall identify the MCData client ID from the \ element
received in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body.
### 7.3.2 SIP REGISTER request for service authorisation
The MCData server shall support obtaining service authorization specific
information from the SIP REGISTER request sent from the MCData client and
included in the body of a third-party SIP REGISTER request.
NOTE 1: 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] defines how based on initial filter criteria the
SIP REGISTER request sent from the UE is included in the body of the third-
party SIP REGISTER request.
Upon receiving a third party SIP REGISTER request with a message/sip MIME body
containing the SIP REGISTER request sent from the MCData client containing an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with an \
element and an \ element within a message/sip MIME body of
the SIP REGISTER request sent from the MCData client, the MCData server:
1) shall identify the IMS public user identity from the third-party SIP
REGISTER request;
2) shall identify the MCData ID from the SIP REGISTER request sent from the
MCData client and included in the message/sip MIME body of the third-party SIP
REGISTER request by following the procedures in clause 7.3.1A;
2A) shall check if the number of maximum simultaneous authorizations supported
for the MCData user is specified in the \ element of the \ element contained in the \
element of the MCData user profile (see the user profile configuration
document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) and if present shall check whether it has
been reached. If reached, the MCData server shall not continue with the rest
of the steps in this clause;
2B) if the \ element of the \
element is not present in the \ element of the MCData user profile
(see the user profile configuration document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]), shall
check if the number of maximum simultaneous authorizations supported for any
MCData user as specified in the \ element of
the \ element contained in the \ element of the MCData
service configuration document (see the service configuration document in 3GPP
TS 24.484 [12]) has been reached. If reached, the MCData server shall not
continue with the rest of the steps in this clause;
3) shall perform service authorization for the identified MCData ID as
described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26];
4) if service authorization was successful, shall bind the MCData ID and the
MCData client ID to the IMS public user identity;
4a) if service authorization was successful and if the service authorization
request was from an MCData user who is previously MCData service authorized on
another MCData client (as determined by a comparison of the received MCData
client ID with the MCData client ID of existing bindings), keep the current
bindings and create a new binding between the MCData ID, the MCData client ID
and the IMS public user identity;
NOTE 2: The MCData server will store the binding MCData ID, MCData client ID,
IMS public user identity and an identifier addressing the MCData server in an
external database.
5) if a Resource-Share header field with the value \"supported\" is contained
in the \"message/sip\" MIME body of the third-party REGISTER request, shall
bind the MCData ID and the MCData client ID to the identity of the MCData UE
identified by the \"+g.3gpp.registration-token\" header field parameter in the
Contact header field of the incoming third-party REGISTER request; and
6) if more than one binding exists for the MCData ID, shall include in the SIP
200 (OK) response an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body as
specified in annex D.1 with a \ element set to the value
\"true\".
### 7.3.3 SIP PUBLISH request for service authorisation and service settings
The MCData server shall support obtaining service authorization specific
information from a SIP PUBLISH request for MCData server settings.
Upon receiving a SIP PUBLISH request containing:
1) an Event header field set to the \"poc-settings\" value;

in clause 4.9, and not continue with the rest of the steps in this clause;
3A) shall check if the number of maximum simultaneous authorizations supported
for the MCData user as specified in the \ element of the \ element contained in the \
element of the MCData user profile (see the MCData user profile service
configuration document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) has been reached. If reached,
the MCData server shall send a SIP 486 (Busy Here) response towards the MCData
client with the warning text set to: \"228 maximum number of service
authorizations reached\" in a Warning header field as specified in clause 4.9
and shall not continue with the rest of the steps in this clause;
3B) if the \ element of the \
element is not present in the \ element of the MCData user profile
(see the user profile configuration document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]), shall
check if the number of maximum simultaneous authorizations supported for any
MCData user as specified in the \ element of
the \ element contained in the \ element of the MCData
service configuration document (see the service configuration document in 3GPP

header field as specified in clause 4.9 and shall not continue with the rest
of the steps in this clause;
4) shall perform service authorization for the identified MCData ID as
described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26];
5) if service authorization was successful:
a) shall bind the MCData ID and MCData client ID to the IMS public user
identity;
b) if the service authorization request was from an MCData user who is
previously MCData service authorized on another MCData client (as determined
by a comparison of the received MCData client ID with the MCData client ID of
existing bindings), keep the current bindings and create a new binding between
the MCData ID, MCData client ID and the IMS public user identity; and
c) if a Resource-Share header field with the value \"supported\" was included
in the \"message/sip\" MIME body of the third-party REGISTER request, shall
bind the MCData ID and MCData client ID to the identity of the MCData UE
identified by the \"+g.3gpp.registration-token\" header field parameter in the
Contact header field of the third-party REGISTER request that contained this
IMS public user identity;
NOTE 1: The MCData server will store the binding MCData ID, MCData client ID,
IMS public user identity and an identifier addressing the MCData server in an
external database.
6) if service authorization was not successful, shall send a SIP 403
(Forbidden) response towards the MCData client with the warning text set to:
\"101 service authorisation failed\" in a Warning header field as specified in
clause 4.9, and not continue with the rest of the steps in this clause;
7) shall process the SIP PUBLISH request according to rules and procedures of
IETF RFC 3903 [34] and if processing of the SIP request was not successful, do
not continue with the rest of the steps;

a \ element set to the value \"true\";
10) shall download the MCData user profile from the MCData user database as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.283 [37] if not already stored at the MCData server and
use the \ element of the poc-settings event
package if included to identify the active MCData user profile for the MCData
client;
NOTE 2: If the \ element of the poc-settings
event package is included then only that MCData user profile is needed to be
downloaded from the MCData user database.
11) if there is no \ element included in the poc-
settings event package then if multiple MCData user profiles are stored at the
MCData server or downloaded for the MCData user from the MCData user database,
shall determine the pre-selected MCData user profile to be used as the active
MCData user profile by identifying the MCData user profile (see the MCData
user profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) in the collection of MCData user
profiles that contains a \ element; and
NOTE 3: If only one MCData user profile is stored at the MCData server or only
one MCData user profile is downloaded from the MCData user database, then by
default this MCData user profile is the pre-selected MCData user profile.
12) if an \ element is contained in the \
element of the MCData user profile document with one or more \ elements

# 8 Affiliation
## 8.1 General
Clause 8.2 contains the procedures for explicit affiliation at the MCData
client.
Clause 8.3 contains the procedures for explicit affiliation at the MCData
server serving the MCData user and the MCData server owning the MCData group.
Clause 8.3 contains the procedures for implicit affiliation at the MCData
server serving the MCData user and the MCData server owning the MCData group.
Clause 8.4 describes the coding used for explicit affiliation.
The procedures for implicit affiliation in this clause are triggered at the
MCData server serving the MCData user in the following circumstances:
\- on receipt of a SIP MESSAGE request from an MCData client when initiating
an MCData emergency alert targeted to an MCData group and the MCData client is
not already affiliated to the MCData group; and
\- on receipt of a SIP REGISTER request for service authorisation (as
described in clause 7.3.2) or SIP PUBLISH request for service authorisation
and service settings (as described in clause 7.3.3), as determined by
configuration in the MCData user profile document as specified in 3GPP TS
24.484 [12].
The procedures for implicit affiliation in this clause are triggered at the
MCData server owning the MCData group in the following circumstances:
\- on receipt of a SIP MESSAGE request from the MCData server serving the
MCData user when the MCData user initiates an MCData emergency alert targeted
to an MCData group and the MCData client is not already affiliated to the
MCData group.
## 8.2 MCData client procedures
### 8.2.1 General
The MCData client procedures consist of:
\- an affiliation status change procedure;
\- an affiliation status determination procedure;
\- a procedure for sending affiliation status change request in negotiated
mode to target MCData user;
\- a procedure for receiving affiliation status change request in negotiated
mode from authorized MCData user; and
\- a rules based affiliation status change procedure.
In order to obtain information about success or rejection of changes triggered
by the affiliation status change procedure for an MCData user, the MCData
client needs to initiate the affiliation status determination procedure for
the MCData user before starting the affiliation status change procedure for
the MCData user.
### 8.2.2 Affiliation status change procedure
In order:
\- to indicate that an MCData user is interested in one or more MCData
group(s) at an MCData client;
\- to indicate that the MCData user is no longer interested in one or more
MCData group(s) at the MCData client;
\- to refresh indication of an MCData user interest in one or more MCData
group(s) at an MCData client due to near expiration of the expiration time of
an MCData group with the affiliation status set to the \"affiliated\" state
received in a SIP NOTIFY request in clause 8.2.3;
\- to send an affiliation status change request in mandatory mode to another
MCData user;
\- to indicate that an MCData user is interested in one or more MCData
group(s) at an MCData client triggered by a location or functional alias
activation criteria;
\- to indicate that the MCData user is no longer interested in one or more
MCData group(s) at the MCData client client triggered by location or
functional alias deactivation criteria; or
\- any combination of the above;
the MCData client shall generate a SIP PUBLISH request according to 3GPP TS
24.229 [5], IETF RFC 3903 [34], and IETF RFC 3856 [39].
When the MCData user indicates that he is no longer interested in one or more
MCData group(s) at the MCData client, the MCData client shall first check
value of the \
element if present within the MCData user profile document (see the MCData
user profile document specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [50]). If the affiliation to
the group has been activated due to a rule being fulfilled and the \ element is present and
is set to a value of \"true\", the MCData client shall suppress the MCData
user\'s request.
NOTE 0: If the request is suppressed, a notification message can be displayed
to the user.
In the SIP PUBLISH request, the MCData client:
1) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity identifying the
originating participating MCData function serving the MCData user;
2) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body. In the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body, the MCData client shall
include the \ element set to the MCData ID of the MCData
user;
3) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
(coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]), in a P-Preferred-Service header
field according to IETF RFC 6050 [7];
4) if the targeted MCData user is interested in at least one MCData group at
the targeted MCData client, shall set the Expires header field according to
IETF RFC 3903 [34], to 4294967295;
NOTE 1: 4294967295, which is equal to 2^32^-1, is the highest value defined
for Expires header field in IETF RFC 3261 [4].
5) if the targeted MCData user is no longer interested in any MCData group at
the targeted MCData client, shall set the Expires header field according to
IETF RFC 3903 [34], to zero; and
6) shall include an application/pidf+xml MIME body indicating per-user
affiliation information according to clause 8.4.1. In the MIME body, the
MCData client:
a) shall include all MCData groups where the targeted MCData user indicates
its interest at the targeted MCData client;
b) shall include the MCData client ID of the targeted MCData client;
c) shall not include the \"status\" attribute and the \"expires\" attribute in
the \ element; and
d) shall set the \ child element of the \ root element to a
globally unique value.
The MCData client shall send the SIP PUBLISH request according to 3GPP TS
24.229 [5].
### 8.2.3 Affiliation status determination procedure
NOTE 1: The MCData UE also uses this procedure to determine which MCData
groups the MCData user successfully affiliated to.
In order to discover MCData groups:
1) which the MCData user at an MCData client is affiliated to; or
2) which another MCData user is affiliated to;
the MCData client shall generate an initial SIP SUBSCRIBE request according to
3GPP TS 24.229 [5], IETF RFC 3856 [39], and IETF RFC 6665 [36].
In the SIP SUBSCRIBE request, the MCData client:
1) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity identifying the
originating participating MCData function serving the MCData user;
2) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body. In the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body, the MCData client shall
include the \ element set to the MCData ID of the targeted
MCData user;
3) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
(coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]), in a P-Preferred-Service header
field according to IETF RFC 6050 [7];
4) if the MCData client wants to receive the current status and later
notification, shall set the Expires header field according to IETF RFC 6665
[36], to 4294967295;
NOTE 2: 4294967295, which is equal to 2^32^-1, is the highest value defined
for Expires header field in IETF RFC 3261 [4].
5) if the MCData client wants to fetch the current state only, shall set the
Expires header field according to IETF RFC 6665 [36], to zero; and
6) shall include an Accept header field containing the application/pidf+xml
MIME type; and
7) if requesting MCData groups where the MCData user is affiliated to at the
MCData client, shall include an application/simple-filter+xml MIME body
indicating per-client restrictions of presence event package notification
information according to clause 8.4.2, indicating the MCData client ID of the
MCData client.
In order to re-subscribe or de-subscribe, the MCData client shall generate an
in-dialog SIP SUBSCRIBE request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], IETF RFC 3856
[39], and IETF RFC 6665 [36]. In the SIP SUBSCRIBE request, the MCData client:
1) if the MCData client wants to receive the current status and later
notification, shall set the Expires header field according to IETF RFC 6665
[36], to 4294967295;
NOTE 3: 4294967295, which is equal to 2^32^-1, is the highest value defined
for Expires header field in IETF RFC 3261 [4].
2) if the MCData client wants to de-subscribe, shall set the Expires header
field according to IETF RFC 6665 [36], to zero; and
3) shall include an Accept header field containing the application/pidf+xml
MIME type.
Upon receiving a SIP NOTIFY request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], IETF RFC
3856 [39], and IETF RFC 6665 [36], if SIP NOTIFY request contains an
application/pidf+xml MIME body indicating per-user affiliation information
constructed according to clause 8.4.1, then the MCData client shall determine
affiliation status of the MCData user for each MCData group at the MCData
client(s) in the MIME body. If the \ child element of the \
root element of the application/pidf+xml MIME body of the SIP NOTIFY request
is included, the \ element value indicates the SIP PUBLISH request which
triggered sending of the SIP NOTIFY request.
### 8.2.4 Procedure for sending affiliation status change request in
negotiated mode to target MCData user
NOTE: Procedure for sending affiliation status change request in negotiated
mode to several target MCData users is not supported in this version of the
specification.
Upon receiving a request from the MCData user to send an affiliation status
change request in negotiated mode to a target MCData user, the MCData client
shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] and
IETF RFC 3428 [6]. In the SIP MESSAGE request, the MCData client:
1) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity identifying the
originating participating MCData function serving the MCData user;
2) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body. In the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body, the MCData client shall
include the \ element set to the MCData ID of the target
MCData user;
3) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
(coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]), in a P-Preferred-Service header
field according to IETF RFC 6050 [7] in the SIP MESSAGE request;
4) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-affiliation-command+xml MIME
body as specified in Annex D.3; and
5) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request according to rules and procedures of
3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
On receiving a SIP 2xx response to the SIP MESSAGE request, the MCData client
shall indicate to the user that the request has been delivered to an MCData
client of the target MCData user.
### 8.2.5 Procedure for receiving affiliation status change request in
negotiated mode from authorized MCData user
Upon receiving a SIP MESSAGE request containing:
1) the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\" (coded as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]), in a P-Asserted-Service header field
according to IETF RFC 6050 [7]; and
2) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-affiliation-command+xml MIME body with a
list of MCData groups for affiliation under the \ element and a
list of MCData groups for de-affiliation under the \ element;
then the MCData client:
1) shall send a 200 (OK) response to the SIP MESSAGE request;
2) shall seek confirmation of the list of MCData groups for affiliation and
the list of MCData groups for de-affiliation, resulting in an accepted list of
MCData groups for affiliation and an accepted list of MCData groups for de-
affiliation; and
3) if the user accepts the request:
a) shall perform affiliation for each entry in the accepted list of MCData
groups for affiliation for which the MCData client is not affiliated, as
specified in clause 8.2.2; and
b) shall perform de-affiliation for each entry in the accepted list of MCData
groups for de-affiliation for which the MCData client is affiliated, as
specified in clause 8.2.2.
### 8.2.6 Rules based affiliation status change procedure
#### 8.2.6.1 General
The MCData client can based on configuration decide to affiliate or de-
affiliate to a group.
#### 8.2.6.2 User profile defined rules
User profile based affiliation rules are controlled by the elements
\ or \ of the MCData user profile
document identified by the MCData ID of the MCData user (see the MCData user
profile document specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [50]). The rules can be composed
of location criteria (including heading and speed) or functional alias based
criteria. A rule is fulfilled if any of the location criteria and any of the
functional alias based criteria are met. These rules are evaluated whenever a
change of location occurs and whenever a functional alias is activated or
deactivated. If any defined rule is fulfilled, the MCData client shall
initiate the affiliation status change procedure as specified in clause 8.2.2.
NOTE: Hysteresis can be applied to location changes to avoid too frequent
affiliation changes. In addition, the definition of area entry and exit
criteria can be specified to provide a buffer space to minimize ping-ponging
into and out of an area.
#### 8.2.6.3 Group configuration defined rules
If the \ element of the \ element of
an MCS group document is present and the MCData client is within the area
specified in the \ element, the MCData client is
allowed to affiliate to the group.
If the \ element of the \ element of
an MCS group document is present and the MCData client is not within the area
specified in the \ element the MCData client shall
de-affiliate from the group.

is constructed according to IETF RFC 3863 [40] and:
1) contains a \ root element according to IETF RFC 3863 [40];
2) contains an \"entity\" attribute of the \ element set to the
MCData ID of the MCData user;
3) contains one \ child element according to IETF RFC 3863 [40] per
each MCData client of the \ element;
4) can contain a \ child element defined in the XML schema defined in
table 8.4.1.2-1, of the \ element set to an identifier of a SIP
PUBLISH request;
5) contains an \"id\" attribute of the \ element set to the MCData
client ID;
6) contains one \ child element of each \ element;
7) contains one \ child element defined in the XML schema defined
in table 8.4.1.2-1, of the \ element, for each MCData group in which
the MCData user is interested at the MCData client;
8) contains a \"group\" attribute of each \ element set to the
MCData group ID of the MCData group in which the MCData user is interested at
the MCData client;
9) can contain a \"status\" attribute of each \ element
indicating the affiliation status of the MCData user to MCData group at the
MCData client; and

## 9.1 General
The group administrator can disable the SDS service on a MCData group by
setting the \ element under the \ element, in the group document, to \"false\".
If the \ element under the \
element, in the group document, is set to \"false\" for a MCData group:
\- an MCData client should not use the procedures in the clauses of the parent
clause to send SDS to the said MCData group.
\- a terminating MCData controlling function should reject the request to send
SDS to the said MCData group.
## 9.2 On-network SDS
### 9.2.1 General

When the MCData user wishes to send:
\- a one-to-one standalone Short Data Service (SDS) message to another MCData
user; or
\- a group standalone Short Data Service (SDS) message to a pre-arranged group
;
the MCData client:
1) shall follow the procedures in clause 11.1 for transmission control; and
2) if the procedures in clause 11.1 are successful and the size of the payload
the MCData user wishes to send:
a) is less than or equal to the value contained in the \ element in the MCData service configuration document as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12], shall follow the procedures specified in
clause 9.2.2.2.1:

\ element set to \"one-to-one-sds\" or \"one-to-one-sds-
session\"; and
4) a Content-ID header field set to the \"cid\" URL;
the participating MCData function:
1) if unable to process the request due to a lack of resources or a risk of
congestion exists, may reject the SIP REFER request with a SIP 500 (Server
Internal Error) response. The participating MCData function may include a
Retry-After header field to the SIP 500 (Server Internal Error) response as
specified in IETF RFC 3261 [4] and skip the rest of the steps;
NOTE 1: If the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info MIME body included in the SIP
REFER request contains an \ element or \
element set to a value of \"true\", and this is an authorised request for
originating a priority communication, as determined by clause 6.3.7.2.6, the
participating MCData function can, according to local policy, choose to accept
the request.
2) shall determine the MCData ID of the calling user from public user identity
in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of the SIP REFER request;
3) if the participating MCData function cannot find a binding between the
public user identity and an MCData ID or if the validity period of an existing
binding has expired, then the participating MCData function shall reject the
SIP REFER request with a SIP 404 (Not Found) response with the warning text
set to \"141 user unknown to the participating function\" in a Warning header
field as specified in clause 4.9, and skip the rest of the steps;
4) shall determine whether the MCData user identified by the MCData ID is
authorised for MCData communications, as follows:

MCData ID is not allowed to initiate MCData communications, shall reject the
SIP REFER request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response with warning text set to
\"200 user not authorised to transmit data\" in a Warning header field as
specified in clause 4.9, and shall not continue with the rest of the steps in
this clause; and
ii) if the MCData user is not allowed to initiate emergency MCData
communications, as determined in clause 6.7.3.2.6, shall reject the SIP
request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response including warning text set to
\"233 user not authorised to initiate emergency communication\" in a Warning
header field as specified in clause 4.9 and shall not continue with the rest
of the steps;
5) if the received SIP REFER request does not contain an application/resource-
lists MIME body referenced by a \"cid\" URL in the Refer-To header field,
shall reject the SIP REFER request with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response
including warning text set to \"145 unable to determine called party\" in a
Warning header field as specified in clause 4.9, and skip the rest of the

MCData function, it shall reject the REFER request with a SIP 404 (Not Found)
response with the warning text \"142 unable to determine the controlling
function\" in a Warning header field as specified in clause 4.9, and skip the
rest of the steps;
NOTE 2: The public service identity can identify the controlling MCData
function in the local MCData system or in an interconnected MCData system.
NOTE 3: If the controlling MCData function is in an interconnected MCData
system in a different trust domain, then the public service identity can
identify the MCData gateway server that acts as an entry point in the
interconnected MCData system from the local MCData system.
NOTE 4: If the controlling MCData function is in an interconnected MCData
system in a different trust domain, then the local MCData system can route the
SIP request through an MCData gateway server that acts as an exit point from
the local MCData system to the interconnected MCData system.

### 9.2.6 SDS session using MBMS delivery in the media plane
The procedures for group SDS delivery using MBMS can be seen as extensions of
group SDS delivery using unicast session via the media plane.
Group SDS delivery using MBMS enables dynamic toggling between unicast and
MBMS delivery at any time during a session, assuming the proper bearers are
available. Only the terminating MCData clients and the respective associated
MCData terminating participating functions become aware of and involved in the
potential MBMS delivery.
The terminating participating function can signal the start/stop/resume MBMS
transmissions to the MCData client by using the media control plane Map Group
To Bearer and Unmap Group To Bearer messages, described in 3GPP TS 24.582
[15]. The media control plane signaling associates the TMGI of an announced
MBMS bearer with the MCData group ID of the communication and with the MBMS
transmission parameters (IP address and UDP port).
Guaranteed delivery for SDS when using MBMS can be achieved by the SDS
originator through use of dispositions (i.e. \"DELIVERED\") and SDS
NOTIFICATION mechanisms. It is up to the terminating participating function to
decide whether or not to use MBMS for a session, and it is possible that the
terminating participating function will not use MBMS delivery for SDS messages
without the \"DELIVERED\" disposition.

#### 10.2.1.3 Discovery of the Absolute URI of the media storage function
##### 10.2.1.3.1 General
In order to upload a file to the media storage function on the controlling
MCData function, the MCData UE if not aware of the absolute URI of the media
storage function, discovers the absolute URI of the media storage function.
##### 10.2.1.3.2 Void
##### 10.2.1.3.3 Participating MCData function procedures
On receipt of a \"SIP MESSAGE request for absolute URI discovery request for
participating MCData function\", the originating participating MCData
function:
1) if unable to process the request due to a lack of resources or a risk of
congestion exists, may reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 500 (Server
Internal Error) response. The participating MCData function may include a
Retry-After header field to the SIP 500 (Server Internal Error) response as
specified in IETF RFC 3261 [4] and skip the rest of the steps;
2) shall determine the MCData ID of the calling user from the public user
identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of the SIP MESSAGE request;

the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body in the SIP MESSAGE request;
NOTE 2: The public service identity can identify the controlling MCData
function in the local MCData system or in an interconnected MCData system.
NOTE 3: If the controlling MCData function is in an interconnected MCData
system in a different trust domain, then the public service identity can
identify the MCData gateway server that acts as an entry point in the
interconnected MCData system from the local MCData system.
NOTE 4: If the controlling MCData function is in an interconnected MCData
system in a different trust domain, then the local MCData system can route the
SIP request through an MCData gateway server that acts as an exit point from
the local MCData system to the interconnected MCData system.
NOTE 5: How the originating participating MCData function determines the
public service identity of the controlling MCData function serving the target
MCData ID or of the MCData gateway server in the interconnected MCData system
is out of the scope of the present document.
NOTE 6: How the local MCData system routes the SIP request through an exit
MCData gateway server is out of the scope of the present document.
5) if unable to identify the controlling MCData function, it shall reject the
SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 404 (Not Found) response with the warning text
\"142 unable to determine the controlling function\" in a Warning header field

client shall determine whether the group document contains a \
element that contains a \ element. If a
\ element exists and is set to the value
\"true\", then the media storage client:
1) should indicate to the MCData user that group file distribution is not
allowed on the indicated group; and
2) shall skip the remainder of this procedure.
The media storage client shall determine the value of the absolute URI
associated with the media storage function of the MCData content server from
the \ element of the MCPTT user profile document (see

The media storage client shall send HTTP requests over a TLS connection as
specified for the HTTP client in the UE in annex A of 3GPP TS 24.482 [24].
NOTE 1: The HTTP client encodes the MCData ID in the bearer access token of
the Authorization header field of an HTTP request as specified in 3GPP TS
24.482 [24].
NOTE 2: The HTTP client always sends the HTTP requests to an HTTP proxy. Annex
A of 3GPP TS 24.482 [24] indicates how the HTTP proxy forwards the HTTP
request to the HTTP server.
To upload a UE-stored file to media storage function on the MCData content
server, the media storage client:
1) shall generate an HTTP POST request as specified in IETF RFC 7230 [22] and
IETF RFC 7231 [23];
2) shall set the Request-URI to the absolute URI identifying the resource on a
media storage function;
3) shall set the Host header field to a hostname identifying the media storage
function;
4) shall set the Content-Type header field to multipart/mixed and with a
boundary delimiter parameter set to any chosen value;
5) if the file upload is for one-to-one file distribution, shall insert an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with:
a) the \ element set to a value of \"one-to-one-fd\"; and
b) the \ element set to the originating MCData ID;
6) if the file upload is for group file distribution, shall insert an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with:
a) the \ element set to a value of \"group-fd\";
b) the \ element set to the MCData group identity; and
c) the \ element set to the originating MCData ID;
7) if end-to-end security is required for a one-to-one communication, the
MCData client protects the binary data representing the file and prefixes the
protected binary data with security parameters as described in 3GPP TS 33.180
[26];
8) if
a) end-to-end security is not required for a one-to-one communication, or
b) the file upload is for group file distribution;
shall include the binary data representing the file with Content-Type field
set to application/octet-stream and Content-Length field set to the file size;
and
9) shall send the HTTP POST request towards the media storage function.
To upload a network-stored file to media storage function on the MCData
content server, the media storage client:
1) shall generate an HTTP POST request as specified in IETF RFC 7230 [22] and
IETF RFC 7231 [23];
2) shall set the Request-URI to the absolute URI identifying the resource on a
media storage function;
3) shall set the Host header field to a hostname identifying the media storage
function;
4) shall set the Content-Type header field to multipart/mixed and with a
boundary delimiter parameter set to any chosen value;
5) if the file upload is for one-to-one file distribution, shall insert an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with:
a) the \ element set to a value of \"one-to-one-fd\"; and
b) the \ element set to the originating MCData ID;
6) if the file upload is for group file distribution, shall insert an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with:
a) the \ element set to a value of \"group-fd\";
b) the \ element set to the MCData group identity; and
c) the \ element set to the originating MCData ID;
7) shall insert a message/external-body MIME according to rules and procedures
of IETF RFC 2017 [80] with:
a) the Content-Type header field set to message/external-body with:
i) the access-type parameter set to a value of \"URL\";
ii) the URL parameter set to an absolute URI identifying the URL of the
network-stored file being requested to download; and
NOTE 3: For the network-stored file available in the MCData message store the
above URL set as
//{serverRoot}/nms/{apiVersion}/{storeName}/{boxId}/objects/{objectId}/payload
as indicated by the object\'s payLoadURL as described in the \"Object\" data
structure in clause 5.3.2.1 of OMA-TS-REST_NetAPI_NMS-V1_0-20190528-C [66].
iii) the phantom body area of the message/external-body is not used and should
be left blank; and
8) shall send the HTTP POST request towards the media storage function.
On receipt of a HTTP 201 Created containing a Location header field with a URL
identifying the location of the resource where the file has been stored on the
media storage function, then the media storage client shall store this
information.
#### 10.2.2.2 Media storage function procedures
The media storage function on the MCData content server shall act as an HTTP
server as defined in annex A of 3GPP TS 24.482 [24].
NOTE 1: The HTTP server validates the MCData ID in the bearer access token of
the Authorization header field of an HTTP request as specified in 3GPP TS
24.482 [24].
On receipt of an HTTP POST request with a Request-URI identifying a resource
on the media storage function and message/external-body MIME is not included,
the media storage function:
1) shall decode the contents of application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME
body:
a) if the user indicated by \ element is not allowed
to upload files due to transmission control policy, shall return a HTTP 403
Forbidden response and not continue with the remaining steps in this clause;
b) If the \ element is set to:
a) \"one-to-one-fd\" and the Content-Length header under application/octet-
stream MIME is greater than \ element present in the
service configuration document as specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12], shall
generate and send a HTTP 413 Payload Too Large response and not continue with
the remaing steps in this clause;
b) \"group-fd\":
i) shall retrieve the group document associated with the group identity
indicated in the \ element by following the procedures in
clause 6.3.3, and shall continue with the remaining steps if the procedures in
clause 6.3.3 were successful;
ii) if the Content-Length header under application/octet-stream MIME is
greater than \ element present in the
group document retrieved in step i), shall generate and send a HTTP 413

7230 [22] and IETF RFC 7231 [23] with the following clarifications:
a) shall store the file in the resource location as identified by the Request-
URI; and
b) shall generate and send a HTTP 201 Created response containing a Location
header field with a URL identifying the location of the stored file.
On receipt of an HTTP POST request with a Request-URI identifying a resource
on the media storage function and message/external-body MIME is included, the
media storage function:
1) shall decode the contents of application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME
body:
a) if the user indicated by \ element is not allowed
to upload files due to transmission control policy, shall return a HTTP 403
Forbidden response and not continue with the remaining steps in this clause;
and
2) shall process the HTTP POST request by following the procedures in IETF RFC
7230 [22] and IETF RFC 7231 [23] with the following clarifications:

### 10.2.3 File download using HTTP
#### 10.2.3.1 Media storage client procedures
The media storage client shall send HTTP requests over a TLS connection as
specified for the HTTP client in the UE, in annex A of 3GPP TS 24.482 [24].
NOTE 1: The HTTP client encodes the MCData ID in the bearer access token of
the Authorization header field of an HTTP request as specified in 3GPP TS
24.482 [24].
NOTE 2: The HTTP client always sends the HTTP requests to an HTTP proxy. Annex
A of 3GPP TS 24.482 [24] indicates how the HTTP proxy forwards the HTTP
request to the HTTP server.
To download a file from the media storage function on the MCData content
server, the media storage client:
1) shall generate an HTTP GET request as specified in IETF RFC 7230 [22] and
IETF RFC 7231 [23] with a Request-URI set to an absolute URI identifying the
URL of the file being requested from the media storage function on the MCData
content server; and
2) shall send the HTTP GET request towards the media storage function on the
MCData content server.
On receipt of a HTTP 200 OK response containing the requested file, the MCData
client shall notify the user or application that the file has been
successfully downloaded.
#### 10.2.3.2 Media storage function procedures
The media storage function on the MCData content server shall act as an HTTP
server as defined in annex A of 3GPP TS 24.482 [24].
NOTE 1: The HTTP server validates the MCData ID in the bearer access token of
the Authorization header field of an HTTP request as specified in 3GPP TS
24.482 [24].
On receipt of an HTTP GET request with a Request-URI identifying a file, the
media storage function on the MCData content server:
1) if the MCData user is not allowed to download files due to reception
control policy, shall return an HTTP 403 Forbidden response;
2) shall process the HTTP GET request by following the procedures in IETF RFC
7230 [22] and IETF RFC 7231 [23], and shall return a HTTP 200 OK response
containing the requested file.
Editor\'s Note: [CR 0133, WI eMCData2] it is FFS to determine how the MCData
content server will apply reception control policy by accessing the
configuration documents (e.g service configuration and group configuration)
from the MCData server.
### 10.2.4 FD using HTTP
#### 10.2.4.1 General
The procedures in the clauses of the parent clause describe the SIP signalling
procedures for:
\- one-to-one file distribution using HTTP; and
\- group standalone file distribution using HTTP.
When the MCData user wishes to perform file distribution via HTTP, the MCData
client:
1) shall check that the file size is less than or equal to the:
a) \ element present in the group
document retrieved by the group management client as specified in 3GPP TS
24.481 [11], if the file upload is for a group file distribution; or
b) \ element present in the service configuration
document as specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12], if the file upload is for a one-
to-one file distribution;
2) if the size of the file:
a) is acceptable for upload as determined by step 1), shall determine the
value of the absolute URI associated with the media storage function of the
MCData content server from the \ element of the MCPTT
user profile document (see the MCPTT user profile document in 3GPP TS 24.484
[50]);
b) is not acceptable for upload, shall not continue with the remaining steps
in this clause;
3) shall request the media storage client to upload the file to the media
storage function by following the procedures in clause 10.2.2.1; and
4) shall initiate an FD request containing a file URL as specified in clause
10.2.4.2.1.
#### 10.2.4.2 MCData client procedures
##### 10.2.4.2.1 MCData client originating procedures
If a group standalone FD message is to be sent, the MCData client shall
determine whether the group document contains a \ element that
contains a \ element. If a \ element exists and is set to the value \"true\", then the
MCData client:
1) should indicate to the MCData user that group standalone FD is not allowed
on the indicated group; and
2) shall skip the remainder of this procedure.
The MCData client shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP
TS 24.229 [5] and IETF RFC 3428 [6] with the clarifications given below.
The MCData client:

element with the \ element set to the user provided
value;
3) if a group standalone FD message is to be sent:
a) if the \"/_\ _/\/Common/MCData/AllowedFD\" leaf node present in the
group document of the requested MCData group, configured on the group
management client as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [42] is set to \"false\",
shall reject the request for FD and not continue with the rest of the steps in
this clause; and
b) shall insert in the SIP MESSAGE request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body with:
i) the \ element set to a value of \"group-fd\";
ii) the \ element set to the MCData group identity;
iii) the \ element set to the MCData client ID of the

### 10.2.6 FD using MBMS delivery via MB2 interface
The procedures for group FD using MBMS delivery via MB2 interface can be seen
as extensions of group FD using unicast session for delivery via the media
plane.
Group FD using MBMS enables dynamic toggling between unicast and MBMS delivery
at any time during a session, assuming the proper bearers are available. Only
the terminating MCData clients and the respective associated MCData
terminating participating functions become aware of and involved in the
potential MBMS delivery.
The terminating participating function can signal the start/stop/resume MBMS
transmissions to the MCData client by using the media control plane Map Group
To Bearer and Unmap Group To Bearer messages, described in 3GPP TS 24.582
[15]. The media control plane signaling associates the TMGI of an announced
MBMS bearer with the MCData group ID of the communication and with the MBMS
transmission parameters (IP address and UDP port).
File download completed notifications can be requested to assess if the file
transfer was successful. It is up to the terminating participating function to
decide whether or not to use MBMS for a session, and it is possible that the
terminating participating function will not use MBMS delivery for FD unless a
file repair or retransmission capability is available.

# 12 Dispositions and Notifications
## 12.1 General
The procedures in clause 12 describe:
\- the on-network procedures for generating out-of-band dispositions for on-
network SDS and on-network FD;
\- the on-network procedures for generating network notifications for file
distribution; and
\- the off-network procedures for generating SDS dispositions.
The MCData client can send a disposition notification as a direct result of
receiving an MCData message (e.g. delivery notification) or can send a
disposition notification at a later time (e.g. read notification). In certain
circumstances the delivery and read notification can be delivered in one
notification message.
In-band dispositions are sent in the media plane as specified in 3GPP TS
24.582 [15].
## 12.2 On-network disposition notifications
### 12.2.1 MCData client procedures
#### 12.2.1.1 MCData client sends a disposition notification message
The MCData client shall follow the procedures in this clause to:
\- indicate to an MCData client that an SDS message was delivered, read or
delivered and read when the originating client requested a delivery, read or
delivery and read report;
\- indicate to the participating MCData function serving the MCData user that
an SDS message was undelivered. The participating MCData function can store
the message for later re-delivery;
\- indicate to an MCData client that a request for FD was accepted, deferred
or rejected; or
\- indicate to an MCData client that a file download has been completed;
Before sending a disposition notification the MCData client needs to
determine:
\- the group identity related to an SDS or FD message request received as part
of a group communication. The MCData client determines the group identity from
the contents of the \ element contained in the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the incoming SDS or FD
message request; and
\- the MCData user targeted for the disposition notification. The MCData
client determines the targetted MCData user from the contents of the \ element contained in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body of the incoming SDS or FD message request.
The MCData client shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP
TS 24.229 [5] and IETF RFC 3428 [6] with the clarifications given below.
The MCData client:
1) shall build the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in clause 6.2.4.1;
2) shall follow the rules specified in clause 6.4 for the handling of MIME
bodies in a SIP message when processing the remaining steps in this clause;
3) shall insert in the SIP MESSAGE request an application/resource-lists+xml
MIME body containing the MCData ID of the targeted MCData user, according to
rules and procedures of IETF RFC 5366 [18];
4) void;
5) if sending a disposition notification in response to an MCData group data
request, shall include an \ element set to the MCData
group identity in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body;
6) if requiring to send an SDS notification, shall generate an SDS
NOTIFICATION message and include it in the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in
clause 6.2.3.1;
7) if requiring to send an FD notification, shall generate an FD NOTIFICATION
message and include it in the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in clause
6.2.3.2; and
8) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request according to rules and procedures of
3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
#### 12.2.1.2 MCData client receives a disposition notification message
Upon receipt of a:
\"SIP MESSAGE request for SDS disposition notification for terminating MCData
client\"; or
\"SIP MESSAGE request for FD disposition notification for terminating MCData
client\";
the MCData client:
1) shall decode the contents of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-signalling
MIME body; and
2) shall deliver the notification to the user or application.
### 12.2.2 Participating MCData function procedures
#### 12.2.2.1 Participating MCData function receives disposition notification
from a MCData user
Upon receipt of a:
\- \"SIP MESSAGE request for SDS disposition notification for MCData server\";
or
\- \"SIP MESSAGE request for FD disposition notification for MCData server\";
the participating MCData function:
1) if unable to process the request due to a lack of resources or a risk of
congestion exists, may reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 500 (Server
Internal Error) response. The participating MCData function may include a
Retry-After header field to the SIP 500 (Server Internal Error) response as
specified in IETF RFC 3261 [4] and skip the rest of the steps;
2) shall determine the MCData ID of the calling user from the public user
identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of the SIP MESSAGE request;
NOTE 1: The MCData ID of the calling user is bound to the public user identity
at the time of service authorisation, as documented in clause 7.3.
3) if the participating MCData function cannot find a binding between the
public user identity and an MCData ID or if the validity period of an existing
binding has expired, then the participating MCData function shall reject the
SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 404 (Not Found) response with the warning text
set to \"141 user unknown to the participating function\" in a Warning header
field as specified in clause 4.9, and shall not continue with any of the
remaining steps;
4) void;
5) if the SIP MESSAGE is a \"SIP MESSAGE request for SDS disposition
notification for MCData server\" containing an SDS disposition notification
type set to a value of \"UNDELIVERED\", shall temporarily store the message
for re-delivery, shall start timer TD1 (SDS re-delivery timer) with the timer
value as specified in clause F.2.1, and shall not continue with the remaining
steps;
NOTE 2: The participating MCData function attempts re-delivery of the SDS
message after timer TD1 (SDS re-delivery timer) expiry.
6) if the SIP MESSAGE is a \"SIP MESSAGE request for SDS disposition
notification for MCData server \" containing an SDS disposition notification
type set to a value of \"DELIVERED\", \"READ\" or \"DELIVERED AND READ\" and
the message was temporarily stored for re-delivery, shall delete the message
from temporary store and shall stop TD1 (SDS re-delivery timer);

## 12.4 Network-triggered notifications for FD
### 12.4.1 General
#### 12.4.1.1 File availability expiry
When the controlling MCData function receives a \"SIP MESSAGE request for FD
using HTTP for controlling MCData function\" (referred to as FD request), it
starts a timer TDC2 (file availability timer). The timer value is derived from
the \"file availability\" information contained in metadata in the FD request
(if included) or by local policy. The timer running for the file is uniquely
associated to the Conversation ID and Message ID in the FD request.
The controlling MCData function tracks which MCData client(s) have downloaded
the file referenced by the file URL received in an FD request which is
associated to a Conversation ID and Message ID. On expiry of timer TDC2 (file
availability timer), the controlling MCData function sends a FD NETWORK
NOTIFICATION message with a notification type set to \"FILE EXPIRED
UNAVAILABLE TO DOWNLOAD\". The MCData client is notified that the file
associated with the Conversation ID and Message ID is no longer available to
download.
### 12.4.2 Controlling MCData function procedures
#### 12.4.2.1 Generation of a SIP MESSAGE request for notification
This clause is referenced from other procedures and is not run standalone.
The controlling MCData function
1) shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]
and IETF RFC 3428 [6];
2) shall include an Accept-Contact header field containing the
g.3gpp.mcdata.fd media feature tag along with the \"require\" and \"explicit\"
header field parameters according to IETF RFC 3841 [8] in the outgoing SIP
MESSAGE request;
3) shall include an Accept-Contact header field with the media feature tag
g.3gpp.icsi-ref with the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcdata.fd\" along with parameters \"require\" and
\"explicit\" according to IETF RFC 3841 [8] in the outgoing SIP MESSAGE
request;
4) shall follow the rules specified in clause 6.4 for the handling of MIME
bodies in a SIP message when processing the remaining steps in this clause;
5) shall include in an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the
outgoing SIP MESSAGE request:
\- the \ element set to the MCData ID of the MCData user;
and
\- the \ element set to a value of \"notify\";
6) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity of the terminating
participating MCData function associated to the MCData user to be invited;
NOTE 1: The public service identity can identify the terminating participating
MCData function in the local MCData system or in an interconnected MCData
system.
NOTE 2: If the terminating participating MCData function is in an
interconnected MCData system in a different trust domain, then the public
service identity can identify the MCData gateway server that acts as an entry
point in the interconnected MCData system from the local MCData system.
NOTE 3: If the terminating participating MCData function is in an
interconnected MCData system in a different trust domain, then the local
MCData system can route the SIP request through an MCData gateway server that
acts as an exit point from the local MCData system to the interconnected
MCData system.
NOTE 4: How the controlling MCData function determines the public service
identity of the terminating participating MCData function serving the target
MCData ID or of the MCData gateway server in the interconnected MCData system
is out of the scope of the present document.
NOTE 5: How the local MCData system routes the SIP request through an exit
MCData gateway server is out of the scope of the present document.
7) shall include the public service identity of the controlling MCData
function in the P-Asserted-Identity header field; and
8) shall include a P-Asserted-Service header field with the value
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.fd\".
#### 12.4.2.2 Expiry of timer TDC2 (file availability timer)
When timer TDC2 (file availability timer) associated to a specific
Conversation ID and Message ID expires, the controlling MCData function shall
identify a target set of MCData client(s) as being:
\- the MCData client that received a one-to-one file distribution using HTTP
for the associated Conversation ID and Message ID, but has not yet downloaded
the file; or
\- each MCData client that received a group standalone file distribution using
HTTP for the associated Conversation ID and Message ID, but have not yet
downloaded the file;
On expiry of timer TDC2 (file availability timer), for each identified MCData
client, the controlling MCData function:
NOTE: The file availability timer is associated to the Conversation ID and
Message ID that was present in the initial FD request.
1) shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request as specified in clause 12.4.2.1;
2) shall include an FD NETWORK NOTIFICATION message in an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-signalling MIME body of the SIP MESSAGE request

The participating MCData function shall follow the procedures in clause
10.2.4.3.2.
### 12.4.4 MCData client terminating procedures
On receipt of a SIP MESSAGE request containing an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
signalling MIME body with a FD NETWORK NOTIFICATION message, the MCData
client:
1) may reject the SIP MESSAGE request if there are not enough resources to
handle the SIP MESSAGE request;
2) if the SIP MESSAGE request is rejected in step 1), shall respond towards
the participating MCData function with a SIP 480 (Temporarily unavailable)

NOTE 1: The Number of payloads IE dictates the number of Payload IEs and
Security parameters and Payload IEs that are included in the message by the
sender. Multiple Payload IEs can be part of Security parameters and Payload IE
if end-to-end security is required, i.e. if there are multiple protected user
payloads, each one should be a separate Security parameters and Payload IE
containing a \"MCData Protected Payload message content\" with the message
type of \"MCData Protected Payload message content\" set according to 3GPP TS
33.180 [26].
NOTE 2: If end-to-end security is required for a one-to-one communication,
Security parameters and Payload IE is included. Otherwise, if end-to-end
security is not required for a one-to-one communication, Payload IE is
included. For group communication, Payload IE is included.
NOTE 3: Formatting of user payloads as part of the Security parameters and
Payload IE is specified in clause 15.2.13. The user payloads formatted as
specified in the clause 15.2.13 and protected as specified in the clause
8.5.4.1 of 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]. The Protected Payload (Ciphertext)
encapsulated in \"MCData Protected Payload message content\". Finally, the
entire \"MCData Protected Payload message content\" is encoded in the \"DATA
PAYLOAD message content\" as a \"Security parameters and Payload\" IE value.
NOTE 4: An entire \"DATA PAYLOAD message content\" can be protected for all
the user payloads. Otherwise, each user payloads are protected and
encapsulated in a separate \"Security parameters and Payload\" IEs of the
\"DATA PAYLOAD message content\".
NOTE 5: The MCData Protected Payload message do not inherits the message type
from the DATA PAYLOAD message when each user payloads are protected and
encapsulated in a separate \"Security parameters and Payload\" IEs of the
\"DATA PAYLOAD message content\". The bits 7, 8 set according to clause 8.5.1
of 3GPP TS 33.180 [26].

## 15.2 General message format and information elements coding
### 15.2.1 General
The least significant bit of a field is represented by the lowest numbered bit
of the highest numbered octet of the field. When the field extends over more
than one octet, the order of bit values progressively decreases as the octet
number increases.
Figure 15.2.1-1 shows an example of a field where the most significant bit of
the field is marked MSB and the least significant bit of the field is marked
LSB.

Editor\'s Note: The definitions of tag and attribute-value should be enhanced
to show the possible inclusion of an escape-character.
The tag can contain any visible (printing) 7-bit US-ASCII character except the
tag-value-delimiter unless the character defined as the tag-value-delimiter is
escaped using the escape-character.
The attribute-value can contain any visible (printing) 7-bit US-ASCII except
the value-end-delimiter and the escape-character unless the character defined
as the value-end-delimiter is escaped using the escape-character or the
character defined as the escape-character is escaped using the escape-
character. For example, if the escape-character is \'\\\', then the \'\\\'
character can be included in the attribute-value by using \'\\\\\'.

# 16 Emergency Alert
## 16.1 General
This clause describes the emergency alert procedures for on-network.
For on-network emergency alert, the procedures for originating and terminating
MCData clients, participating MCData function and controlling MCData function
are specified in clause 16.2.
For off-network emergency alert, the procedures for each functional entity is
specified in clause 16.3.
## 16.2 On-network emergency alert
### 16.2.1 Client procedures
#### 16.2.1.1 Emergency alert origination
Upon receiving a request from the MCData user to send an MCData emergency
alert, the MCData client shall determine whether or not it is authorised to
originate an emergency alert, by following the procedures in clause 6.2.8.1.6.
If the MCData emergency alert origination request is considered an
unauthorised request for an MCData emergency alert, the MCData client shall
indicate to the MCData user that an MCData emergency alert is not allowed on
this group and shall terminate this procedure.
If the request was authorised, but the MCData user has not indicated the
identity of the MCData group to receive the emergency alert, the MCData client
shall use, in descending order of preference, one of the following: the value
of the \ element of the \ element of the
\ element of the \ element in the MCData user
profile, if present; if not, the identity of the MCData group to which the
most recent communication or affiliation request was made by the MCData client
since last acquiring the MCData service. If an MCData group identity cannot be
determined, the MCData client shall indicate the fact to the MCData user and
shall terminate this procedure.
The MCData client shall generate a SIP MESSAGE as an out-of-dialog request, in
accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] and IETF RFC 3428 [6], and:
1) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
(coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]), in a P-Preferred-Service header
field according to IETF RFC 6050 [7] in the SIP MESSAGE request;
2) shall include an Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media
feature tag containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
along with the \"require\" and \"explicit\" header field parameters according
to IETF RFC 3841 [8];
3) may include a P-Preferred-Identity header field in the SIP MESSAGE request
containing a public user identity as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5];
4) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with the
\ element containing the \ element (see clause D.1)
with:
a) the \ element set to the MCData group identity;
b) the \ element set to a value of \"true\";
c) the \ element set to the MCData client ID of the
originating MCData client; and
d) if the MCData client is aware of active functional aliases and if an active
functional alias is to be included in the SIP MESSAGE request, the
\ element set to the URI of the used functional alias;
and
e) if the MCData user has requested an application priority, the \
element with the \ element set to the user provided
value;
5) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-info+xml MIME body
with a \ element included in the \ root element (see
clause D.4);
6) shall include in the \ element the specific location information
configured for the MCData emergency alert location trigger;
7) shall set the MCData emergency state if not already set;
8) shall set the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 2: emergency-alert-
confirm-pending\";
9) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity identifying the
participating MCData function serving the group identity; and
10) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request according to rules and procedures of
3GPP 24.229 [5];
On receiving a SIP 2xx response to the SIP MESSAGE request, the MCData client
shall set the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 3: emergency-alert-
initiated\" and shall give the MCData user an indication of success.
On receiving a SIP 4xx response a SIP 5xx response or a SIP 6xx response to
the SIP MESSAGE request, the MCData client shall set the MCData emergency
alert state to \"MDEA 1: no-alert\" and shall indicate the failure to the
MCData user.
NOTE: If no response is received after an implementation dependent amount of
time or if there is an indication of communication failure, the MCData client
can inform the user, and can clear the MCData emergency alert state or can
retry sending the emergency alert to the MCData participating server. The
MCData emergency state is left unchanged, as the MCData user presumably is in
the best position to determine whether or not there still is an emergency
situation and can use manual clearing, as necessary.
#### 16.2.1.2 Emergency alert cancellation
Upon receiving a request from the MCData user to send an MCData emergency
alert cancellation, the MCData client shall determine whether or not it is
authorised to cancel an emergency alert, as follows:
1) if the MCData emergency cancellation request is for an MCData emergency
alert originated by this MCData user, then the request shall be considered
authorised if \ element of the \
element of a \ element of the \ element of the MCData user
profile document identified by the MCData ID and profile index associated with
MCData user (see 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is present and is set to a value of
\"true\"; or
2) if the MCData emergency cancellation request is for an MCData emergency
alert originated by a different MCData user, then the request shall be
considered authorised if \ element of
the \ element of a \ element of the \ element of the
MCData user profile document identified by the MCData ID and profile index
associated with MCData user (see 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]) is present and is set to
a value of \"true\".
If the MCData emergency cancellation request is not considered authorised, the
MCData client shall indicate this fact to the requesting MCData user and shall
terminate this procedure.
If the authorised MCData emergency cancellation request is for an MCData
emergency alert originated by this MCData user and if there are more than one
outstanding emergency alerts from this MCData user and the MCData user has not
indicated which one to cancel, the MCData client shall terminate this
procedure after giving an indication of the condition to the MCData user.
The MCData client shall generate a SIP MESSAGE out-of dialog request in
accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] and IETF RFC 3428 [6] and:
1) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
(coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]), in a P-Preferred-Service header
field according to IETF RFC 6050 [7];
2) shall include an Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media
feature tag containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
along with the \"require\" and \"explicit\" header field parameters according
to IETF RFC 3841 [8];
3) may include a P-Preferred-Identity header field containing a public user
identity as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5];
4) if the MCData emergency alert was originated by this MCData user, shall
include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with the
\ element containing the \ element (see clause D.1)
with:
a) the \ element set to the MCData group identity;
b) the \ element set to a value of \"false\";
c) the \ element set to the MCData client ID of this MCData
client; amd
d) if the MCData client is aware of active functional aliases and if an active
functional alias is to be included in the SIP MESSAGE request, the
\ element set to the URI of the used functional alias;
5) if the MCData emergency alert was originated by a different MCData user,
shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with the
\ element containing the \ element (see clause D.1)
with:
a) the \ element set to the MCData group identity;
b) the \ element set to a value of \"false\";
c) the \ element set to the MCData ID of the MCData user who
originated the MCData emergency alert; and
d) if the MCData client is aware of active functional aliases, and an active
functional alias is to be included in the SIP MESSAGE request, the
\ set to the URI of the used functional alias;
5A) if the MCData user has additionally requested the cancellation of the in-
progress emergency state of the MCData group and this is an authorised request
for an in-progress emergency group state cancellation as determined by clause
6.2.8.1.7, shall include an \ element set to a value of
\"false\" in the \ element containing the \
element;
6) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity identifying the
participating MCData function serving the group identity;
7) if the generated SIP MESSAGE request does not contain an \
element in the application/vnd.3gpp.MCData-info+xml MIME body, shall set the
MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 4: emergency-alert-cancel-pending\";
and
8) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request according to rules and procedures of
3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
On receipt of a SIP MESSAGE request containing an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body with an \ element set to \"true\" and an
\ matching the MCData client ID included in the sent SIP
MESSAGE request and if the sent SIP MESSAGE request did not contain an
\ element in its application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME
body, the MCData client shall:
1) if the \ element in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body of the received SIP MESSAGE request is set to a value of \"false\":
a) set the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 1: no-alert\"; and
b) clear the MCData emergency state if not already cleared; and
2) if the \ element in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body of the received SIP MESSAGE request is set to a value of \"true\"
and if the MCData emergency alert state is set to \"MDEA 4: emergency-alert-
cancel-pending\":
a) set the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA 3: emergency-alert-
initiated\".
NOTE 1: It would appear to be an unusual situation for the initiator of an
MCData emergency alert to not be able to clear their own alert. Nevertheless,
an MCData user can be configured to be authorised to initiate MCData emergency
alerts but not have the authority to clear them. Hence, the case is covered
here.
3) if an \ element is present in the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of received SIP MESSAGE request
is set to a value of \"false\" and the sent SIP MESSAGE request contains an
\ element set to a value of \"false\":
a) shall set the MCData emergency group communication state of the group to
\"MDEGC 1: emergency-gc-capable\"; and
b) shall set the MCData emergency group state of the group to \"MDEG 1: no-
emergency\".
NOTE 2: The case where an \ element is set to true is possible
but not handled specifically above as it results in no state changes.
On receiving a SIP 4xx response, SIP 5xx response or SIP 6xx response to the
sent SIP MESSAGE emergency alert cancellation request, if the sent SIP MESSAGE
request did not contain an \ element in the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body and the MCData emergency alert
state is set to \"MDEA 4: emergency-alert-cancel-pending\":
1) if the received SIP 4xx response, SIP 5xx response or SIP 6xx response does
not contain an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with the
\ element containing the \ element containing the
\ element OR if it contains an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body with the \ element containing the \
element with the \ element set to a value of \"true\" (see clause
D.1), the MCData client shall set the MCData emergency alert state to \"MDEA
3: emergency-alert-initiated\".
#### 16.2.1.3 MCData client receives an MCData emergency alert or
communication notification
Upon receipt of a \"SIP MESSAGE request for emergency notification\", the
MCData client:
1) if the received SIP MESSAGE request contains an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with the \ element
set to a value of \"true\", may display to the MCData user the functional
alias of the originating MCData user, if provided, and should display to the
MCData user an indication of the MCData emergency alert and associated
information, including:
a) the MCData group identity contained in \ element
of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body;
b) the originator of the MCData emergency alert contained in the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME
body; and
c) the mission critical organization of the MCData emergency alert originator
contained in the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body;
NOTE 1: This is the case of the MCData client receiving the notification of
another MCData user\'s emergency alert.

the served MCData client
Editor\'s note: In the current release, support for emergency groups and
emergency group communications may be absent, partial or limited, namely only
provided to the extent of facilitating emergency alert functionality.
Upon receipt of a \"SIP MESSAGE request for emergency notification for
originating participating MCData function\", the participating MCData
function:
1) if unable to process the request due to a lack of resources or a risk of
congestion exists, may reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 500 (Server
Internal Error) response. The participating MCData function may include a
Retry-After header field in the SIP 500 (Server Internal Error) response as
specified in IETF RFC 3261 [4] and skip the rest of the steps;
NOTE 1: if the SIP MESSAGE request contains an emergency indication set to a
value of \"true\" or an alert indication set to a value of \"true\", the
participating MCData function can, according to local policy, choose to accept
the request.
2) shall determine the MCData ID of the calling user from the public user
identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of the SIP MESSAGE request,
and shall authorise the calling user;
NOTE 2: The MCData ID of the calling user is bound to the public user identity
at the time of service authorisation, as documented in clause 7.3.
3) if the MCData user is not affiliated with the MCData group as determined by
clause 8.3.2.11, shall perform the actions specified in clause 8.3.2.12 for
implicit affiliation;
4) if the actions for implicit affiliation specified in step 3) above were
performed but not successful in affiliating the MCData user due to the MCData
user already having N2 simultaneous affiliations, shall reject the \"SIP
MESSAGE request for emergency notification for originating participating
MCData function\" with a SIP 486 (Busy Here) response with the warning text
set to \"102 too many simultaneous affiliations\" in a Warning header field as
specified in clause 4.9 and skip the rest of the steps;
NOTE 3: N2 is the total number of MCData groups that an MCData user can be
affiliated to simultaneously as specified in 3GPP TS 23.282 [2].
NOTE 4: As this is a request for MCData emergency services, the participating
MCData function can choose to accept the request.
5) shall determine the public service identity of the controlling MCData
function associated with the group identity in the received SIP MESSAGE
request;

service identity of the controlling MCData function associated with the group
identified by the \ element contained in the \
element containing the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body in the incoming SIP MESSAGE
request;
NOTE 5: The public service identity can identify the controlling MCData
function in the local MCData system or in an interconnected MCData system.
NOTE 6: If the controlling MCData function is in an interconnected MCData
system in a different trust domain, then the public service identity can
identify the MCData gateway server that acts as an entry point in the
interconnected MCData system from the local MCData system.
NOTE 7: If the controlling MCData function is in an interconnected MCData
system in a different trust domain, then the local MCData system can route the
SIP request through an MCData gateway server that acts as an exit point from
the local MCData system to the interconnected MCData system.
NOTE 8: How the participating MCData function determines the public service
identity of the controlling MCData function serving the target MCData ID or of
the MCData gateway server in the interconnected MCData system is out of the
scope of the present document.
NOTE 9: How the local MCData system routes the SIP request through an exit
MCData gateway server is out of the scope of the present document.
8) shall copy the contents of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME
body in the received SIP MESSAGE request into an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
info+xml MIME body as specified in clause D.1 included in the outgoing SIP
MESSAGE request;
9) shall set the \ element of the \
element containing the \ element to the MCData ID determined in
step 2) above;

the public user identity in the P‑Asserted-Identity header field contained in
the received SIP MESSAGE request;
12) if the received SIP MESSAGE request contains an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body that contains a \ element, shall check if the status of the functional alias is
activated for the MCData ID. If the functional alias status is activated, then
the participating MCData function shall set the \
element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body in the outgoing
SIP MESSAGE request to the received value, otherwise shall not include a
\ element; and
13) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].

# 17 Location procedures
## 17.1 General
If the participating MCData function needs to obtain location information, the
participating MCData function configures the MCData client upon successful
MCData service authorization. The configuration contains information the
MCData client uses to set up filter criteria for when the MCData client shall
send location reports to the participating MCData function.
The participating MCData function can also explicitly request the MCData
client to send a location report.
The MCData client will, based on the received configuration or when explicitly
requested, send location reports.
The location information can be used by the participating MCData function to
determine whether to use MBMS bearers or not.
## 17.2 Participating MCData function location procedures
### 17.2.1 General
The participating MCData function has procedures to:
\- configure the location reporting at the UE;
\- request the UE to report the location of the UE; and
\- receive a location information report from the UE.
### 17.2.2 Location reporting configuration
The participating MCData function may configure the location reporting in the
MCData client by generating a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS
24.229 [5] and IETF RFC 3428 [6]. The participating MCData function:
1) shall include a Request-URI set to the URI from MCData service
authorization corresponding to the MCData ID of the MCData user;
2) shall include an Accept-Contact header field with the media feature tag
g.3gpp.icsi-ref set to the value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
along with parameters \"require\" and \"explicit\" in accordance with IETF RFC
3841 [8];
3) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with an
\ element containing the MCData ID of the MCData user to
receive the configuration;
4) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-info+xml MIME body
with the \ element contained in the \ root
element set to the desired configuration;
5) shall include the TriggerId attribute where defined for the sub-elements
defining the trigger criterion;
6) shall include the public service identity of the participating MCData
function in the P-Asserted-Identity header field;
7) shall include a P-Asserted-Service header field with the value
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"; and
8) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
### 17.2.3 Location information request
If the participating MCData function needs to request the MCData client to
report its location, the participating MCData functions shall generate a SIP
MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] and IETF RFC 3428 [6].
The participating MCData function:
1) shall include a Request-URI set to the URI from MCData service
authorization corresponding to the MCData ID of the MCData user;
2) shall include an Accept-Contact header field with the media feature tag
g.3gpp.icsi-ref set to the value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
along with parameters \"require\" and \"explicit\" in accordance with IETF RFC
3841 [8];
3) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with an
\ element containing the MCData ID of the MCData user;
4) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-info+xml MIME body
with a \ element contained in the \ root element;
5) shall include a P-Asserted-Service header field with the value
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"; and
6) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
### 17.2.4 Location information report
If the participating MCData function receives a SIP request containing:
1) a Content-Type header field set to \"application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-
info+xml\"; and
2) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-info+xml MIME body with a \
element included in the \ root element;
then the participating MCData function shall authorise the location report
based on the MCData ID received. If the MCData user is authorised to send a
location report the participating MCData function:
1) shall use the location information as needed;
2) shall follow the procedure of clause 6.3.7.1.7, if the MCData client has
entered into or exited from a group geographic area; and
3) shall follow the procedure of clause 6.3.7.1.6, if the MCData client has
entered into or exited from an emergency alert area.
NOTE: The \ element contains the event triggering identity in the
location information report from the UE, and can contain location information.
### 17.2.5 Abnormal cases
Upon receipt of a SIP request:
1) where the P-Asserted-Identity identifies a public user identity not
associated with an MCData user served by the participating MCData function; or
2) with a MIME body with Content-Type header field set to
\"application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml\" and with a \
element containing an MCData ID that identifies an MCData user served by the
participating MCData function;
then, when the SIP request contains:

2) an Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media-feature tag
with the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"; and
3) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-info+xml MIME body containing a
\ element or a \ element;
the participating MCData function shall remove the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-info+xml MIME body when sending a SIP
request.
## 17.3 MCData client location procedures
### 17.3.1 General
The MCData client sends a location report when one of the trigger criteria is
fulfilled or when it receives a request from the participating MCData function
to send a location report. To send the location report the MCData client can
use an appropriate SIP message that it needs to send for other reasons, or it
can include the location report in a SIP MESSAGE request.
To send a location report, the MCData client includes in the SIP MESSAGE
request an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-info+xml MIME body as
specified in clause D.4. The MCData client populates the elements in
accordance with its reporting configuration. Further location information may
also be included in the P-Access-Network-Info header field.
### 17.3.2 Location reporting configuration
Upon receiving a SIP MESSAGE request containing:
1) an Accept-Contact header field with the media feature tag g.3gpp.icsi-ref
set to the value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\";
2) a Content-Type header field set to \"application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-
info+xml\"; and
3) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-info+xml MIME body with a
\ root element included in the \ root element;
the MCData client:
1) shall store the contents of the \ elements;
2) shall set the location reporting triggers accordingly; and
3) shall start the minimumReportInterval timer.
### 17.3.3 Location information request
Upon receiving a SIP MESSAGE request containing:
1) an Accept-Contact header field with the media feature tag g.3gpp.icsi-ref
set to the value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\";
2) a Content-Type header field set to \"application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-
info+xml\"; and
3) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-info+xml MIME body with a
\ element included in the \ root element;
the MCData client:
1) shall send a location report as specified in clause 17.3.4; and
2) shall reset the minimumReportInterval timer.
### 17.3.4 Location information report
#### 17.3.4.1 Report triggering
If a location reporting trigger fires, the MCData client checks if the
minimumReportInterval timer is running. If the timer is running the MCData
client waits until the timer expires. When the minimumReportInterval timer
expires, the MCData client:
1) shall, if any of the reporting triggers are still true, send a location
information report as specified in clause 17.3.4.2.
If the MCData client receives a location information request as specified in
clause 17.3.3, the MCData client shall send a location report as specified in
clause 17.3.4.2.
#### 17.3.4.2 Sending location information report
If the MCData client needs to send a SIP request anyway (i.e. for reasons
other than explicit location reporting request or the firing of a configured
location trigger), the MCData client:
1) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-info+xml MIME body
and in the \ root element the MCData client shall include:
a) a \ element and, if the Report was triggered by a location request,
include the \ attribute set to the value of the \
attribute in the received Request;
b) \ child elements, if triggers have fired, where each element is
set to the value of the \ attribute associated with the triggers
that have fired; and
c) the location reporting elements corresponding to the triggers that have
fired, if at least one trigger has fired;
2) shall set the minimumReportInterval timer to the minimumReportInterval time
and start the timer; and
3) shall reset all triggers.
If the MCData client does not need to send a SIP request for reasons other
than explicit location reporting request or the firing of a configured
location trigger, the MCData client shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request in
accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] and IETF RFC 3428 [6]. The MCData client;
1) shall include in the Request-URI, the SIP URI received in the P-Asserted-
Identity header field in the received SIP MESSAGE request for location report
configuration;
2) shall include a Content-Type header field set to
\"application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-info+xml\";
3) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-location-info+xml MIME body
and in the \ root element include:
a) a \ element and if the Report was triggered by a location request
include the \ attribute set to the value of the \
attribute in the received Request;
b) \ child elements, if triggers have fired, where each element is
set to the value of the \ attribute associated with the triggers
that have fired; and
c) the location reporting elements corresponding to the triggers that have
fired, if at least one trigger has fired;
4) shall include an Accept-Contact header field with the media feature tag
g.3gpp.mcdata along with parameters \"require\" and \"explicit\" in accordance
with IETF RFC 3841 [8];
5) shall set the minimumReportInterval timer to the minimumReportInterval time
and start the timer;
6) shall reset all triggers; and
7) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
# 18 Pre-established session
## 18.1 General
The MCData client may establish one or more pre-established sessions to the
participating MCData function at any time after SIP registration and setting
the service settings as defined in clause 7.2.2 or clause 7.2.3.
The MCData client may use the pre-established session for originating
standalone SDS using media plane or SDS session after pre-established session
establishment.
The participating MCData function may use the pre-established session for
terminating standalone SDS using media plane or SDS session after pre-
established session establishment.
The use of a pre-established session requires the use of resource sharing as
specified in **3GPP TS 29.214** [49] **and** 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] by the
participating MCData function. The participating MCData function use of
resource sharing is defined in clause 18.2.
## 18.2 Participating MCData function use of resource sharing
The participating MCData function utilizes resource sharing either:
1) via the SIP core as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]; or
2) by directly interfacing to PCC to control resource sharing via the Rx
reference point as specified in **3GPP TS 29.214** [49].
If resource sharing is supported then the participating MCData function may
allow the use of pre-established sessions by the MCData client.
The participating MCData function can determine that the SIP core supports
resource sharing from the received third-party SIP REGISTER request if the
Resource-Share header field with the value \"supported\" is contained in the
\"message/sip\" MIME body of the third-party SIP REGISTER request as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
When using resource sharing the participating MCData function uses the
\"+g.3gpp.registration-token\" header field parameter in the Contact header
field of the third-party REGISTER request to identify the MCData UE that is
registering and to identify whether resource sharing and pre-established
sessions can be used with a specific MCData UE.
## 18.3 Pre-established session for MCData SDS communication
### 18.3.1 General
This clause describes the procedures to establish pre-established MCData
session which may be used for originating standalone SDS using media plane or
SDS session. The MCData client or the participating MCData function may
initiate the release of a pre-established session as defined in clause 18.3.3.
#### 18.3.1.1 SDP offer generation
When composing an SDP offer according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], IETF RFC 4975
[17], IETF RFC 6135 [19] and IETF RFC 6714 [20] the MCData client:
1) shall include an \"m=message\" media-level section for the MCData media
stream consisting of:
a) the port number;
b) a protocol field value of \"TCP/MSRP\" or \"TCP/TLS/MSRP\" for TLS;
c) an \"a=sendrecv\" attribute;
d) an \"a=path\" attribute containing its own MSRP URI;
e) set the content type as \"a=accept-types:application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
signalling application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-payload\"; and
f) set the a=setup attribute as \"actpass\".
#### 18.3.1.2 SDP answer generation
When composing the SDP answer according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], the
participating MCData function:
1) shall replace the IP address and port number in the received SDP answer
with the IP address and port number of the participating MCData function, for
the accepted media stream in the received SDP offer, if required; and
2) if the IP address is replaced shall insert its MSRP URI before the MSRP URI
in the \"a=path\" attribute in the SDP answer.
### 18.3.2 Session establishment
#### 18.3.2.1 MCData client procedures
When the MCData client initiates a pre-established session the MCData client
shall:
1) gather ICE candidates according to IETF RFC 8445 [77]; and
NOTE: ICE candidates are only gathered on interfaces that the MCData UE uses
to obtain MCData service.
2) generate an initial SIP INVITE request by following the UE originating
session procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], with the clarifications
given below.
The MCData client:
1) shall set the Request-URI of the SIP INVITE request to the public service
identity of the participating MCData function serving the MCData user;
2) may include a P-Preferred-Identity header field in the SIP INVITE request
containing a public user identity as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5];

to IETF RFC 3841 [8];
5) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\"
(coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]), in a P-Preferred-Service header
field according to IETF RFC 6050 [7] in the SIP INVITE request;
6) shall include an Accept-Contact header field with the media feature tag
g.3gpp.icsi-ref set to the value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcdata.sds\" along with parameters \"require\" and
\"explicit\" according to IETF RFC 3841 [8];
7) shall include the \"timer\" option tag in the Supported header field;
8) should include the Session-Expires header field according to IETF RFC 4028
[38] and should not include the \"refresher\" header field. The \"refresher\"
header field parameter shall be set to \"uac\" if included;

clarifications given in clause 18.3.1.1, and include ICE candidates in the SDP
offer as per IETF RFC 8839 [78]; and
11) shall send the SIP INVITE request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
Upon receiving a SIP 2xx response to the SIP INVITE request the MCData client:
1) shall interact with the media plane as specified in 3GPP TS 24.582 [15].
#### 18.3.2.2 Participating MCData function procedures
Upon receipt of a \"SIP INVITE request for establishing a pre-established
session\" the participating MCData function:
1) shall check whether the public service identity is allocated and if it is
not allocated, shall return a SIP 404 (Not Found) response and skip the rest
of the steps;
2) shall determine the MCData ID of the MCData user establishing the pre-
established session and perform actions to verify the MCData ID of the MCData
client and authorise the request according to local policy, and if not
authorised, the participating MCData function shall return a SIP 403
(Forbidden) response with the warning text set to \"225 User not authorized to
initiate pre-established session\" as specified in clause 4.9 and skip the

field of the third-party REGISTER request (see clause 18.2) and that this UE
identity matches the identity in the \"+g.3gpp.registration-token\" header
field parameter in the Feature-Caps header field in the \"SIP INVITE request
for establishing a pre-established session\";
5) if resource sharing is not supported or if there is no binding between the
MCData ID of the MCData user and the identity of the MCData UE identified by
the \"+g.3gpp.registration-token\" header field parameter in the Feature-Caps
header field or the participating MCData function does not support the pre-
established session, then the participating MCData function shall return a SIP
403 (Forbidden) response with the warning text set to \"226 function not
allowed due to pre-established session not supported\" as specified in clause
4.9 and skip the rest of the steps;

# 19 MBMS transmission usage procedure
## 19.1 General
This clause describes the participating MCData function and the MCData client
procedure for:
1) MBMS bearer announcements;
2) MBMS bearer listening status; and
3) MBMS bearer suspension status.
This clause contains references to the MBMS Subchannel control messages Map
Group To Bearer and Unmap Group To Bearer defined in 3GPP TS 24.582 [15].
## 19.2 Participating MCData function MBMS usage procedures
### 19.2.1 General
This clause describes the procedures in the participating MCData function for:
1) sending an MBMS bearer announcements to the MCData client;
2) receiving an MBMS bearer listening status from the MCData client; and
3) receiving an MBMS bearer suspension status from the MCData client.
### 19.2.2 Sending MBMS bearer announcement procedures
#### 19.2.2.1 General
The availability of a MBMS bearer is announced to MCData clients by means of
an MBMS bearer announcement message. One or more MBMS bearer announcement
elements are included in an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml
MIME body.
An MBMS bearer announcement message can contain new MBMS bearer announcements,
updated MBMS bearer announcements or cancelled MBMS bearer announcements or a
mix of all of them at the same time in an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-
usage-info+xml MIME body. Each initial MBMS bearer announcement message
announces one MBMS bearer intended to carry a general purpose MBMS subchannel
used for application level multicast signalling in a specified MBMS service
area and additionally, the message could also announce zero or more extra MBMS
bearers intended to carry additional media plane traffic.
NOTE: A new MBMS bearer announcement does not implicitly remove previously
sent MBMS bearer announcements if the previously sent MBMS bearer announcement
is not included in an MBMS bearer announcement message. However, the
application/sdp MIME body, if included in the new MBMS bearer announcement
message, fully replaces the existing application/sdp MIME body (which includes
the MSCCK security key used to protect the general purpose MBMS subchannel).
When and to whom the participating MCData function sends the MBMS bearer
announcement is based on local policy in the participating MCData function.
The following clauses describe how the participating MCData function:
1\. sends an initial MBMS bearer announcement message;
2\. updates a previously sent announcement of MBMS bearer(s);
3\. cancels a previously sent announcement of MBMS bearer(s); and
4\. keys, re-keys or un-keys MCData groups using Multicast Signalling Key
(MuSiK) via a key download procedure.
Prior to the participating MCData function transmitting on an MBMS bearer, the
participating MCData function:
1\. if necessary, shall instruct the local key management client to request
keying material from the key management server as described in 3GPP TS 33.180
[26];
2\. shall generate MSCCK(s) with the corresponding MSCCK-ID(s) and MuSiK(s)
with the corresponding MuSiK‑ID(s) as necessary; and
3\. shall distribute MSCCKs, MSCCK-IDs, MuSiKs and MuSiK-IDs to the MCData
clients, as needed, using the keying material received from the key management
server for security protection, as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26].
#### 19.2.2.2 Sending an initial MBMS bearer announcement procedure
For each MCData client that the participating MCData function is sending an
MBMS bearer announcement to, the participating MCData function:
1) shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]
and IETF RFC 3428 [6];
2) shall set the Request-URI to the URI received in the To header field in a
third-party SIP REGISTER request;
3) shall include an Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref
media-feature tag with the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
along with parameters \"require\" and \"explicit\" according to IETF RFC 3841
[8];
4) shall include a P-Asserted-Service header field with the value
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\";
5) shall include one application/sdp MIME body conforming to 3GPP TS 24.229
[5] where the application/sdp MIME body:
a) shall include the Content-Disposition header field with the value
\"render\";
b) should include one or more \"m=message\" media lines and media line
attributes conforming to IETF RFC 4566 [71] and IETF RFC 5888 [72], to be used
as the MBMS subchannel for media only. Additionally, the participating MCData
function:
NOTE 0: Unciphered packets (i.e. using RTP/UDP/IP encapsulation) and ciphered
packets (i.e. using SRTP/UDP/IP encapsulation) need separate media lines, with
different transport protocols.
i) shall set the c-line to the unspecified address (0.0.0.0), if IPv4, or to a
domain name within the \".invalid\" DNS top-level domain, if IPv6; and
ii) shall set the port number of the media line to 9; and
iii) shall set the \ sub-field of the media line to RTP/AVP for
unciphered traffic or to RTP/SAVP for ciphered traffic, to be used for the
MBMS subchannel associated to the media line; and
c) shall include one \"m=application\" media line to be used for the general
purpose MBMS subchannel. The media line shall include a valid multicast IP
address and a valid port number. If the protection of MBMS subchannel control
messages sent over this MBMS subchannel of the MBMS bearer is required, the
participating MCData function also includes an \"a=key-mgmt\" media-level
attribute. The participating MCData function:
i) shall encrypt the MSCCK to a UID associated to the targeted MCData ID and a
time related parameter as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26];
ii) shall generate a MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE using the encapsulated MSCCK and
MSCCK-ID as specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26];
iii) shall add the public service identity of the participating MCData
function to the initiator field (IDRi) of the I_MESSAGE as described in 3GPP
TS 33.180 [26];
iv) shall sign the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE using the public service identity of
the participating MCData function signing key provided in the keying material
together with a time related parameter, and add this to the MIKEY-SAKKE
payload, as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]; and
v) shall include the \"mikey\" key management and protocol identifier and the
signed MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE in the value of the a=key-mgmt\" media-level
attribute according to IETF RFC 4567 [45]; and
6) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body
defined in clause D.5 with the \ element set to \"1\" and one or more
\ elements associated with the pre-activated MBMS bearers. Each
set of an \ element:
a) shall include a TMGI value in the \ element;
NOTE 2: The same TMGI value can only appear in one \ element.
The TMGI value is also used to identify the \ when updating or
cancelling the \ element.
NOTE 3: The security key active for the general purpose MBMS subchannel on
which the mapping (i.e. the Map Group To Bearer message) of media to this MBMS
bearer was indicated, is used for MBMS subchannels on this MBMS bearer, unless
a different key or an indication of not using encryption is in place.
b) shall include the QCI value in the \ element;
c) if multiple carriers are supported, shall include the frequency to be used
in the \ element;
NOTE 4: In the current release, if the \ element is included, the
frequency in the \ element is the same as the frequency used for
unicast.
d) shall include one or more MBMS service area IDs in \
elements in the \ element;
NOTE 5: Initial mappings of groups to MBMS subchannels on an MBMS bearer for
the purpose of carrying media can occur only where the MBMS service area for
this bearer and the MBMS service area for the bearer carrying the general
purpose MBMS subchannel on which the Map Group To Bearer message is sent
intersect. However, once the mapping to this bearer was successful, the
reception by the MCData client can continue (until Unmap Group To Bearer is
received or until timeout) throughout the entire MBMS service area of this
bearer.
e) may include the \ element and set it to \"true\" value
or the \"false\" value;
NOTE 6: The participating function can choose to direct some clients not to
send an MBMS bearer suspension report when notified by RAN, by including the
\ element set to \"false\". The purpose is to prevent an
avalanche of identical reports sent by clients roughly at the same time, to
report the suspension of the same MBMS bearer. The way the participation
function determines which clients are to send or not to send the report is
outside the scope of the present document.
f) if the MBMS bearer is carrying the general purpose MBMS subchannel, shall
include one \element, giving the number of the \"m=application\" media
line in the application/sdp MIME body generated in step 5 above to be used for
the general purpose MBMS subchannel; and
g) if the packet headers are compressed with ROHC specified in RFC 5795 [60]
in this MBMS bearer, the \ element in the \ element in
the \ element shall include the \
element defined in clause D.5.3.
7) shall include the MBMS public service identity of the participating MCData
function in the P-Asserted-Identity header field;
8) shall include in a MIME body with Content-Type header field set to
\"application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml\", the \ element
set to the MCData ID of the user; and
9) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request towards the MCData client according to
3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
#### 19.2.2.3 Updating an announcement
When the participating MCData function wants to update a previously sent
announcement, the participating MCData function sends an MBMS bearer
announcement in an SIP MESSAGE request as specified in clause 19.2.2.2 where
the participating MCData function in the \ element to be
updated:
1) shall include the same TMGI value as in the MBMS bearer announcement to be
updated in the \ element;
NOTE 1: TMGI value is used to identify the \ when updating or
cancelling the \ element and can\'t be changed.
2) shall include the same or an updated value of the QCI in the \
element;
3) if a frequency was included in the previously sent announcement, shall
include the same value in the \ element;
NOTE 2: In the current release if the \ element is included, the
frequency in the \ element is the same as the frequency used for
unicast.
4) shall include the same list of MBMS service area IDs or an updated list of
MBMS service area IDs in \ elements in the \ element;
5) may include the same or an updated value in the \
element;
6) shall include the \ element with the same value as in the initial
\ element; and
7) shall include the same application/sdp MIME body as included in the initial
MBMS announcement.
#### 19.2.2.4 Cancelling an MBMS bearer announcement
When the participating MCData function wants to cancel an MBMS bearer
announcement associated with an \ element, the participating
MCData function sends an MBMS bearer announcement as specified in clause
19.2.2.2 where the participating MCData function in the \
element to be cancelled:
1) shall include the same TMGI value as in the \ element to be
cancelled in the \ element;
2) shall not include an \ element;
3) if the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body only
contains \ elements that are to be cancelled, shall not include
an \ element; and
4) if the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body only
contains \ elements that are to be cancelled, shall not include
an application/sdp MIME body.
#### 19.2.2.5 Sending a MuSiK download message
For each MCData client that the participating MCData function is intending to
use a Multicast Signalling Key (MuSiK), the participating MCData function
shall perform a key download procedure for a MuSiK and its corresponding
MuSiK‑ID. Two kinds of MuSiK download are possible: default MuSiK download and
explicit MuSiK download. The default MuSiK download is used to set, reset or
unset a MuSiK and its corresponding MuSiK‑ID and is applicable to all groups
supported by the MCData client, except for certain identified groups for which
MuSiKs and MUSiK‑IDs are assigned, reassigned or unassigned separately via
explicit MuSiK download. The default MuSiK and MUSiK‑ID can apply to all the
MCData clients supported by the participating MCData function and can be
overridden by the explicit MuSiK download which is selectively applied only to
the MCData clients using the explicitly identified groups. A group subject to
explicit MuSiK download, can be switched to the default MuSiK protection via a
default MuSiK download identifying that group. The participating MCData
function:
1) shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]
and IETF RFC 3428 [6];
2) shall set the Request-URI to the URI received in the To header field in a
third-party SIP REGISTER request;
3) shall include an Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref
media-feature tag with the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
along with parameters \"require\" and \"explicit\" according to IETF RFC 3841
[8];
4) shall include a P-Asserted-Service header field with the value
\"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\";
5) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body
defined in clause D.5 with the \ element set to \"1\", and either
a) containing an \ element with at least one
\ element associated with the MuSiK being downloaded; or
b) containing an \ element with zero or more
\ elements associated with the MuSiK being downloaded;
6) if protection for the group(s) in the specified list is to be provided
using the MuSiK, shall include an application/mikey MIME body with the MIKEY
message containing the encrypted MuSiK and the corresponding MuSiK-ID,
constructed as described in clauses 5.8.1 and 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 33.180 [26];
NOTE: Clause 9.2.1.3 of 3GPP TS 33.180 [26] shows an example on how to include
an application/mikey MIME body in a SIP message.
7) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request towards the MCData client according to
3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
The participating MCData function shall consider the key download successful
on receipt of a 200 OK message in response to the SIP MESSAGE request sent in
step 7).
A participating MCData function that does not receive a 200 OK message from a
specific MCData client shall use unicast with that MCData client, for the
groups for which the MuSiK was intended.
### 19.2.3 Receiving an MBMS bearer listening status from an MCData client
Upon receiving a \"SIP MESSAGE request for an MBMS listening status update\",
the participating MCData function shall handle the request in accordance with
3GPP TS 24.229 [5] and IETF RFC 3428 [6].
If the SIP MESSAGE request contains:
1) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body with an
\ element; and
2) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body containing an MCData ID
in the \ served by the participating MCData function;
then the participating MCData function:
1) shall verify that the public user identity in the P-Asserted-Identity
header field is bound to the MCData ID in the \ element in
the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body, and if that is the case:
a) if the \ element is set to \"listening\":
i) if a \ element is included, shall indicate to the media plane
that the MCData client in the session identified by the \ element
is now listening to the MBMS subchannel; and
ii) if \ element is included with the value \"true\", shall
indicate to the media plane that the MCData client is now listening to the
general purpose MBMS subchannel; and
b) if the \ element is set to \"not-listening\":
i) if a \ element is included, shall indicate to the media plane
that the MCData client in the sessions identified by the \
elements is not listening to the MBMS subchannel;
ii) if \ element is included with the value \"false\", shall
indicate to the media plane that the MCData client is no longer listening to
the general purpose MBMS bearer; and
iii) shall interact with the media plane as specified in 3GPP TS 24.582 [15].
NOTE 1: If the MCData client reports that the MCData client is no longer
listening to the general purpose MBMS subchannel it is implicitly understood
that the MCData client no longer listens to any MBMS subchannel in ongoing
conversations that the MCData client previously reported status \"listening\".
If the SIP MESSAGE request contains:
1) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body with an
\ element; and
2) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body containing an MCData ID
in the \ served by the participating MCData function;
then the participating MCData function:
1) shall verify that the public user identity in the P-Asserted-Identity
header field is bound to the MCData ID in the \ element in
the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body, and if that is the case:
a) if the \ element is set to \"suspending\":
i) shall consider that the bearer identified by the \ element
is about to be suspended and that the reduction or elimination of traffic on
that bearer and/or on some of the bearers indicated in the \
elements can potentially avoid the suspension; and
NOTE 2: An MBMS bearer is about to be suspended when RAN has notified the
clients of the decision to suspend the bearer, but the actual suspension,
which would occur at the end of the MCCH modification period, has not taken
place yet because the MCCH modification period has not yet expired.
ii) may take implementation/configuration specific immediate action for the
MCData client that reports the suspension as well as other MCData clients that
listen to the same bearer (e.g. moving traffic to unicast bearer(s)), reducing
transmission rate, eliminating traffic, modifying pre-emption priority); or
b) if the \ element is set to \"not-suspending\":
i) shall consider that the bearer identified by the \ element
is no longer about to be suspended; and
NOTE 3: An MBMS bearer is no longer about to be suspended when RAN has
notified the clients of the decision to no longer suspend the bearer after
having previously notified the clients that the bearer would be suspended at
the end of the MCCH modification period. The RAN notifications to first
suspend and subsequently not to suspend the same MBMS bearer would have to
come within the same MCCH modification period.
ii) may take implementation/configuration specific immediate action for the
MCData client that reports the suspension as well as other MCData clients that
listen to the same bearer (e.g. restoring traffic previously reduced or
eliminated from MBMS bearers upon reception of suspension information).
NOTE 4: If the MCData client reports that the MCData client is no longer
listening to MBMS subchannels associated with the MBMS bearer indicated in the
suspension information, it is implicitly understood that the suspension of
that MBMS bearer has actually occurred.
### 19.2.4 Abnormal cases
Upon receipt of a SIP MESSAGE request with an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body:
1) where the P-Asserted-Identity identifies a public user identity not
associated with MCData user served by the participating MCData function; or
2) with an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body and with a \ element containing an MCData ID that identifies an MCData user
served by the participating MCData function and an
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body containing one or
more \ elements;
then the participating MCData function shall send a SIP 403 (Forbidden)
response as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
## 19.3 MCData client MBMS usage procedures
### 19.3.1 General
This clause describes the procedures in the MCData client for:
1) receiving an MBMS bearer announcement from the participating MCData
function;
2) sending an MBMS bearer listening status report to the participating MCData
function; and
3) sending an MBMS bearer suspension status report to the participating MCData
function.
### 19.3.2 Receiving an MBMS bearer announcement
The MCData client associates each received application/sdp MIME body and each
received security key with a general purpose MBMS subchannel announced in the
same MBMS Bearer Announcement message. When receiving a Map Group To Bearer
message, the MCData client interprets its content (e.g. the m= line number) in
the context of the application/sdp MIME body associated with the general
purpose MBMS subchannel on which the Map Group To Bearer message was received.
When the MCData client receives a SIP MESSAGE request containing:
1) a P-Asserted-Service header field containing the \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"; and
2) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body containing one
or more an \ element(s);
then the MCData client for each \ element in the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body:
1) if the \ element is present:
a) if an \ element with the same value of the \ element is
already stored:
i) shall replace the old \ element with the \
element received in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME
body;
b) if there is no \ element with the same value of the \
element stored:
i) shall store the received \ element;
c) shall associate the received announcement with the received application/sdp
MIME body;
d) shall associate the received announcement with the received \
element;
e) shall store the MBMS public service identity of the participating MCData
function received in the P‑Asserted‑Identity header field and associate the
MBMS public service identity with the new \ element;
f) if a \"a=key-mgmt\" media-level attribute with the \"mikey\" key management
and protocol identifier and a MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE is included for the
general purpose MBMS subchannel defined in the \"m=application\" media line in
the application/sdp MIME body in the received SIP MESSAGE request,
i) shall extract the initiator URI from the initiator field (IDRi) of the
I_MESSAGE as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]. If the initiator URI deviates
from the public service identity of the participating MCData function serving
the MCData user, shall reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 488 (Not
Acceptable Here) response as specified in IETF RFC 4567 [45], and include
warning text set to \"136 authentication of the MIKEY-SAKE I_MESSAGE failed\"
in a Warning header field as specified in clause 4.9 and shall not continue
with the rest of the steps;
ii) shall convert the initiator URI to a UID as described in 3GPP TS 33.180
[26];
iii) shall use the UID to validate the signature of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE
as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26];
iv) if authentication verification of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE fails, shall
reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response
as specified in IETF RFC 4567 [45], and include warning text set to \"136
authentication of the MIKEY-SAKE I_MESSAGE failed\" in a Warning header field
as specified in clause 4.9 and shall not continue with the rest of the steps;
v) shall extract and decrypt the encapsulated MSCCK using the participating
MCData function\'s (KMS provisioned) UID key as described in 3GPP TS 33.180
[26]; and
vi) shall extract the MSCCK-ID, from the payload as specified in 3GPP TS
33.180 [26];
NOTE: With the MSCCK successfully shared between the participating MCData
function and the served UEs, the participating MCData function is able to
securely send MBMS subchannel control messages to the MCData clients.
g) shall listen to the general purpose MBMS subchannel defined in the
\"m=application\" media line in the application/sdp MIME body in the received
SIP MESSAGE request when entering an MBMS service area where the announced
MBMS bearer is available; and
h) shall check the condition for sending a listening status report as
specified in the clause 19.3.3; and
2) if no \ element is present:
a) shall discard a previously stored \ element identified by the
value of the \;
b) shall remove the association with the stored application/sdp MIME body and
stop listening to the general purpose MBMS subchannel;
c) if no more \ elements associated with the stored
application/sdp MIME body are stored in the MCData client, shall remove the
stored application/sdp MIME body; and
d) check the condition for sending a listening status report as specified in
the clause 19.3.3.
### 19.3.3 The MBMS bearer listening status and suspension report procedures

### 19.3.4 Receiving a MuSiK download message
When the MCData client receives a SIP MESSAGE request containing:
1) a P-Asserted-Service header field containing the \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"; and
2) with one of the following:
a) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body containing an
\ element with at least one \ subelement;
or
b) an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body containing an
\ element with zero or more \ subelements;
the MCData client shall:
1) if the received message contains an \ element,
set the impacted groups to be those groups identified by the \
subelements;
2) if the received message contains an \ element
without \ subelements, set the impacted groups to be all groups not
associated with currently valid explicit MuSiK downloads; and
3) if the received message contains an \ element
with \ subelements, first dissociate those groups identified by the
\ subelements from currently valid associations with explicit MuSiK
downloads and then set the impacted groups to be all groups not associated
with currently valid explicit MuSiK downloads.
If the key identifier within the CSB-ID of the MIKEY payload is a MuSiK-ID (4
most-significant bits have the value \'6\'), the MCData client:
1) shall process the MIKEY payload according to 3GPP TS 33.180 [26], as
follows:
a) if the initiator field (IDRi) has type \'URI\' (identity hiding is not
used), the client:
i) shall extract the initiator URI from the initiator field (IDRi) of the
I_MESSAGE as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]. If the initiator URI deviates
from the public service identity of the participating MCData function serving
the MCData client, shall reject the SIP MESSAGE request by sending a SIP 488
(Not Acceptable Here) response as specified in IETF RFC 4567 [45], and
including warning text set to \"136 authentication of the MIKEY-SAKKE
I_MESSAGE failed\" in a Warning header field as specified in clause 4.9 and
shall not continue with the rest of the steps; and
ii) shall convert the initiator URI to a UID as described in 3GPP TS 33.180
[26];
b) otherwise, if the initiator field (IDRi) has type \'UID\' (identity hiding
in use), the client:
i) shall convert the public service identity of participating MCData function
serving the MCData user to a UID as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]; and
ii) shall compare the generated UID with the UID in the initiator field (IDRi)
of the I_MESSAGE as described in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]. If the two initiator
UIDs deviate from each other, shall reject the SIP MESSAGE request by sending
a SIP 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response as specified in IETF RFC 4567 [45],
and including warning text set to \"136 authentication of the MIKEY-SAKKE
I_MESSAGE failed\" in a Warning header field as specified in clause 4.9 and
shall not continue with the rest of the steps;
c) otherwise, shall reject the SIP MESSAGE request by sending a SIP 488 (Not
Acceptable Here) response as specified in IETF RFC 4567 [45], and including
warning text set to \"136 authentication of the MIKEY-SAKKE I_MESSAGE failed\"
in a Warning header field as specified in clause 4.9 and shall not continue
with the rest of the steps;
d) shall use the UID to validate the signature of the I_MESSAGE as described
in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26];
e) if authentication verification of the I_MESSAGE fails or the I_MESSAGE does
not contain a Status attribute, shall reject the SIP MESSAGE request by
sending SIP 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response as specified in IETF RFC 4567
[45], and including warning text set to \"136 authentication of the MIKEY-
SAKKE I_MESSAGE failed\" in a Warning header field as specified in clause 4.9
and shall not continue with the rest of the steps; and
f) shall examine the Status attribute and shall either mark the associated
security functions as \"not in use\" or shall extract and store the
encapsulated MuSiK and the corresponding MuSiK-ID from the payload as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.180 [26]; and
2) for each of the impacted groups, shall either associate the status
\'security not in use\' or shall add/replace in the storage associated with
the group the MuSiK‑ID and the MuSiK, for use (decrypted) as security key.
NOTE: It is expected that the MCData client is capable of storing a different
MuSiK for each MCData group of interest.
The MCData client shall respond with SIP 200 OK only if it finds the message
syntactically correct and recognizes it as a valid and error-free MuSiK
download (default or explicit) message.
# 20 IP Connectivity
## 20.1 General
This clause describes the IP Connectivity procedures between two MCData
clients for on-network. Included are the procedures for MCData client

### 20.2.0a SDP offer generation
The SDP offer shall contain one SDP media-level section for MCData including
an attribute for IP Connectivity according to 3GPP TS 24.582 [15]. When
composing an SDP offer the MCData client shall:
1) set the IP address of the MCData client for the offered MCData IP
Connectivity session; and
NOTE: The MC service operator policy determines if the MCData client can use
an already assigned IP address or can request a new IP address following the
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 [43].
2) shall include an \"m=application\" media-level section as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.582 [15] consisting of:
a) the port number selected for the media plane as specified in 3GPP TS 24.582
[15] clause 13.5; and
b) the \'fmtp\' attribute as specified in 3GPP TS 24.582 [15] clause 13.6.
### 20.2.0b SDP answer generation
When the MCData client receives an initial SDP offer for a MCData including an
attribute for IP Connectivity, the MCData client shall process the SDP offer
and shall compose an SDP answer.
When composing an SDP answer, the MCData client:
1) shall accept the MCData media stream in the SDP offer;
2) shall set the IP address of the MCData client for the accepted MCData media
stream; and
NOTE: The MC service operator policy determines if the MCData client can use
an already assigned IP address or can request a new IP address following the
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.301 [43].
3) shall include an \"m=application\" media-level section for the accepted
MCData media stream consisting of:
a) the port number selected for the media plane as specified in 3GPP TS 24.582
[15] clause 13.5; and
b) the \'fmtp\' attribute as specified in 3GPP TS 24.582 [15] clause 13.6.
### 20.2.1 MCData client originating procedures
When a MCData client receives the request by a user or user application to
establish a IP Connectivity session with another MCData client the MCData
client shall generate a SIP INVITE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229
[5] with the clarifications given below. The MCData ID or the functional alias
of the target MCData client may be explicitly included in the request from the
user or user application. If the target MCData ID or functional alias is not
included in the request, the MCData client may implicitly determine the target
MCData ID by using the target IP Information included in the request to find a
match in the One-to-One communication list of the MCData user profile document
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [12]. If the MCData ID of the target MCData
client is determined implicitly by the target IP Information included in the
request, the client searches in leaves below
/\/\/Common/OnetoOne/UserList/\/Entry/IPInformation/\/Entry/ for a
match in the IP Information. The MCData ID is given by matching the user
entry.
The MCData client:
1) shall include the g.3gpp.mcdata.ipconn media feature tag and the
g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag with the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcdata.ipconn \" in the Contact header field of the SIP
INVITE request according to IETF RFC 3840 [16];
2) shall include an Accept-Contact header field containing the
g.3gpp.mcdata.ipconn media feature tag along with the \"require\" and
\"explicit\" header field parameters according to IETF RFC 3841 [8];
3) shall include an Accept-Contact header field with the g.3gpp.icsi-ref media
feature tag containing the value of \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcdata.ipconn\" along with the \"require\" and \"explicit\"
header field parameters according to IETF RFC 3841 [8];
4) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mcdata.ipconn\" (coded as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]),
in a P-Preferred-Service header field according to IETF RFC 6050 [7] in the
SIP INVITE request;
5) should include the \"timer\" option tag in the Supported header field;
6) should include the Session-Expires header field according to IETF RFC 4028
[38]. It is recommended that the \"refresher\" header field parameter is
omitted. If included, the \"refresher\" header field parameter shall be set to
\"uac\";
7) shall insert in the SIP INVITE request a MIME resource-lists body with the
MCData ID of the invited MCData user or the functional alias, according to
rules and procedures of IETF RFC 5366 [18];
8) shall contain an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with the
\ element containing the \ element with:
a) the \ element set to a value of \"one-to-one-ipconn\";
b) the \ set to \"true\" if the functional alias
is used as a target of the communication request;
c) if the MCData client is aware of active functional aliases and if an active
functional alias is to be included in the SIP INVITE request, the
\ element set to the URI of the used functional alias;
and
d) if the MCData user has requested an application priority, the \
element with the \ element set to the user provided
value.
9) shall set the Request-URI of the SIP INVITE request to the public service
identity identifying the participating MCData function serving the MCData
user;
NOTE 1: The MCData client is configured with public service identity
identifying the participating MCData function serving the MCData user.
10) may include a P-Preferred-Identity header field in the SIP INVITE request
containing a public user identity as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5];
11) shall include an SDP offer according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5] with the
clarifications given in clause 20.2.0a; and
12) shall send the SIP INVITE request towards the MCData server according to
3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
On receipt of a SIP 2xx response to the SIP INVITE request, the MCData client:
1) shall send a SIP ACK request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5];
2) shall start the SIP Session timer according to rules and procedures of IETF
RFC 4028 [38]; and
3) shall interact with the media plane as specified in 3GPP TS 24.582 [15]
clause 13.1.2.
Upon receiving a SIP 300 (Multiple Choices) response to the SIP INVITE request
the MCData client shall use the MCData ID of MCData user contained in the
\ element of the received application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info
MIME body as the MCData ID of the invited MCData user and shall generate an
initial SIP INVITE request by following the UE originating session procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5], with the clarifications given in this clause
and with the following additional clarifications:
1) shall insert in the newly generated SIP INVITE request a MIME resource-
lists body with the MCData ID of the invited MCData user in the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info MIME body in the
received SIP 300 (Multiple Choices) response;
2) shall not include a \ element into the
\ element of the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body; and
3) shall include a \ element into the \ element of the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body with the target functional
alias used in the initial SIP INVITE request for the IP connectivity session
establishment.
On receipt of a SIP 4xx response, a SIP 5xx response or a SIP 6xx response to
the SIP INVITE request, the MCData client:
1) shall indicate to the MCData user or user application that the IP
Connectivity session could not be established; and
2) shall send a SIP ACK request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
On receipt of an indication from the media plane indicating that the IP

#### 21.2.22.1 Message notification client procedures
Based on the channel type created as part of the notification channel creation
procedure (see clause 21.2.19. \"Create notification channel\"), the Message
notification client would determine if and how it needs to open (interact
with) the created channel for notification flow (i.e. using PULL or PUSH).
To open the notification channel for a PULL notification delivery method (i.e.
created channel is of type LongPolling), the Message notification client,
acting as an HTTP client shall follow the procedure described in clauses 6.3
of OMA-TS-REST_NetAPI_NotificationChannel-V1_0-20200319-C [76] as follows:

REST_NetAPI_NMS-V1_0-20190528-C [66] to have the client\'s local message store
updated accordingly; or
2) use the notification as a trigger to subsequently search the MCData message
store for the list of changes as specified in clause 21.2.17;
NOTE: The notifications about changes in the MCData message store can be used
by the message store client to synchronize its local message store with the
MCData message store in two distinguished ways which are listed in bullets
\"1\" and \"2\" above.
To open the notification channel for a PUSH notification delivery method over
WebSocket (i.e. created channel is of type WebSocket), the Message
notification client shall follow the procedure described in Appendix I of OMA-
TS-REST_NetAPI_NotificationChannel-V1_0-20200319-C [76] and use the channelURL
received from the MCData Notification server during the channel creation
procedure (see clauses 21.2.19 ) to create a WebSocket connection with the
MCData Notification server. The process of creating a WebSokect connection
between the Message notification client and the MCData Notification server
through which the MCData Notification server can send notifications to the
Message notification client is not RESTful.
If the created channel is of type NativeChannel, the Message notification
client, is not required to invoke the \"Open notification channel\" procedure
as defined in this clause. See clauses 5, 5.3.13, 5.3.14 of OMA-TS-
REST_NetAPI_NotificationChannel-V1_0-20200319-C [76] for description on
receiving notification over a NativeChannel.
#### 21.2.22.2 MCData Notification server procedures
Upon receipt of the HTTP POST request (i.e. PULL notification delivery method)

### 21.2.24 Retrieve file to store locally procedure
#### 21.2.24.1 Message store client procedures
To request the MCData message store to retrieve a file associated with a given
object Id from the MCData content server and store locally, the message store
client, acting as an HTTP client:
1) shall generate an HTTP POST request as a custom operation associated with a
stored object resource as described in clause 6.2 of OMA-TS-
REST_NetAPI_NMS-V1_0-20190528-C [66] where:
a) the request URI shall be set to:
//{serverRoot}/nms/{apiVersion}/{storeName}/{boxId}/objects/{objectId}/retrieve
NOTE: The above request URI states, the custom operation \"retrieve\" is
performed on an object resource identified by the {objectId}. For further
details on custom operations see clauses 4.4.2, 4.6.1.2 and C.4 in 3GPP TS
29.501 [79]).
b) the Host header field shall be set to a hostname identifying the message
store function; and
c) a valid MCData access token shall be included in the HTTP Authorization
header; and
2) shall send the HTTP POST request towards the message store function with
the request containing an \"Empty\" data structure as described in clause
5.3.2.35 of OMA-TS-REST_NetAPI_NMS-V1_0-20190528-C [66].
Upon receipt of an HTTP response, the message store client should follow the
procedure as described in clause 6.2.2 of OMA-TS-
REST_NetAPI_NMS-V1_0-20190528-C [66].
#### 21.2.24.2 Message store function procedures
Upon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the client, as per clause
21.2.24.1, the message store function acting as an HTTP server:
1) shall validate the MCData access token (with \"Bearer\" authentication
scheme) received in the Authorization header of the request as specified in
3GPP TS 24.482 [24];
2) if validation is successful then
a) shall process the HTTP POST request as follows:
i) shall locate the object as identified by the {objectId} in the request URI
ii) shall use the URL value of the \"href\" attribute within the
\"payloadPart\" IE of the object (see clause 5.3.2.1 of OMA-TS-
REST_NetAPI_NMS-V1_0-20190528-C [66]) and fetch the file from the MCData
content server as described in clause 6.7, provided that the URL is pointing
to a file in the MCData content server; and
iii) shall store the file locally and update the \"href\" attribute value of
the \"payloadPart\" IE accordingly (i.e. to point to the locally stored file)
provided the file was fetched from the MCData content server; and
3) shall generate and send an HTTP response, towards the message store client
indicating the result of the operation as described in clause 6.2.2 of OMA-TS-
REST_NetAPI_NMS-V1_0-20190528-C [66] with the following clarifications:
a) if the URL value of the \"href\" attribute within the \"payloadPart\" IE of
the object was already pointing to a file stored locally in the MCData message
store (i.e. the MCData message store did not need to fetch the file from the
MCData content server), an HTTP 200 OK response containing the \"Object\" data
structure as defined in clause 5.3.2.1 of OMA-TS-
REST_NetAPI_NMS-V1_0-20190528-C [66] shall be returned; and
b) if the object is updated (i.e. \"href\" value of the \"payloadPart\" IE
changed), a \"changedObject\" event notification (see clause 21.2.16) shall be
emitted if there exists a subscription (see clause 21.2.12A) to such an event
from a client.
NOTE: Returning an HTTP 200 OK response when the request is for fetching a
file which has already been fetched and stored locally in the MCData message
store allows proper processing of retried/duplicated requests (e.g. client
retrying the same request if the response to its previous request has not
arrived due to communication failure).
## 21.3 Control of communications storage procedures
### 21.3.1 General
This clause describes the MCData user control of communications storage into
message store procedures for on-network.
The control of communications storage procedures provides an option for the
MCData user to store the MCData communications in the MCData message store.
The MCData user(s) is configured with two levels of configurations to control
the storage.
1) The user profile is configured with two levels of configuration parameters
to control the storage of MCData communications in the message store:
a) The user profile allows control of storage of MCData communications in the
message store or not.
b) If the storage of MCData communication is allowed, the user profile allow
control of storage of private communication and group communication
separately.
2) During the communication, if the communication is enabled to be stored in
the message store (as stated in 1 above) the user will have the choice to
decide if the communication will be stored in the message store. So the user
has the total control if a communication will be stored or not.
The procedures for originating MCData clients and participating MCData
functions are specified in clause 21.3.
### 21.3.2 MCData Client procedures

# 22 Functional alias
## 22.1 General
Clause 22.2 contains the procedures for management of functional alias at the
MCData client, the MCData server serving the MCData user and the MCData server
owning the functional alias.
Clause 22.3 describes the coding used for management of functional aliases.
## 22.2 Procedures
### 22.2.1 MCData client procedures
#### 22.2.1.1 General
The MCData client procedures consist of:
\- a functional alias status change procedure;
\- a functional alias status determination procedure; and
\- a location based functional alias status change procedure.
In order to obtain information about success or rejection of changes triggered
by the functional alias status change procedure for an MCData user, the MCData
client needs to initiate the functional alias status determination procedure
for the MCData user before starting the functional alias status change
procedure for the MCData user.
#### 22.2.1.2 Functional alias status change procedure
In order:
\- to indicate that an MCData user requests to activate one or more functional
aliases;
\- to indicate that the MCData user requests to deactivate one or more
functional aliases;
\- to refresh indication of an MCData user interest in one or more functional
aliases due to near expiration of the expiration time of a functional alias
with the status set to the \"activated\" state received in a SIP NOTIFY
request in clause 22.2.1.3;
\- to indicate that the MCData client entering into or exiting from a location
area triggers one or more functional aliases to be activated;
\- to indicate that the MCData client entering into or exiting from a location
area triggers one or more functional aliases to be deactivated; or
\- any combination of the above;
the MCData client shall generate a SIP PUBLISH request according to TS 24.229
[5], IETF RFC 3903 [34], and IETF RFC 3856 [39].
When the MCData user requests to deactivate a functional alias, the MCData
client shall first check the \ element within the \ element of the \ element
corresponding to the functional alias within the \ list
element of the \ element of the \ element of the MCData
user profile document (see the MCData user profile document in TS 24.484
[12]). If the functional alias has been activated due to a location area
trigger and the \
element is set to a value of \"true\", the MCData client shall suppress the
MCData user\'s request.
NOTE 1: If the request is suppressed, a notification message can be displayed
to the user.
In the SIP PUBLISH request, the MCData client:
1) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity identifying the
originating participating MCData function serving the MCData user;
2) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body. In the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body, the MCData client shall
include the \ element set to the MCData ID of the MCData
user;
3) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
(coded as specified in TS 24.229 [5]), in a P-Preferred-Service header field
according to IETF RFC 6050 [7];
4) if the MCData client requests to activate one or more functional aliases,
shall set the Expires header field according to IETF RFC 3903 [34], to
4294967295;
NOTE 2: 4294967295, which is equal to 2^32^-1, is the highest value defined
for Expires header field in IETF RFC 3261 [4].
5) if the MCData client requests to deactivate one or more functional aliases,
shall set the Expires header field according to IETF RFC 3903 [34], to zero;
and
NOTE 3: Activation and deactivation of functional alias cannot be performed
with the same PUBLISH request.
6) shall include an application/pidf+xml MIME body indicating per-user
functional alias information according to clause 22.3.1. In the MIME body, the
MCData client:
a) shall include all functional aliases where the MCData user requests
activation for the MCData ID;
b) shall include the MCData client ID of the targeted MCData client;
c) shall not include the \"status\" attribute and the \"expires\" attribute in
the \ element;
d) if the MCData client has received an indication that take over of a
functional alias is possible and intends to take over a functional alias,
shall include a \ child element set to \"true\"; and
e) shall set the \ child element of the \ root element to a
globally unique value.
The MCData client shall send the SIP PUBLISH request according to TS 24.229
[5].
#### 22.2.1.3 Functional alias status determination procedure
NOTE 1: The MCData UE also uses this procedure to determine which functional
alias have been successfully activated for the MCData ID.
In order to discover functional aliases:
1) which which are activated for the MCData user; or
2) which another MCData user has activated;
the MCData client shall generate an initial SIP SUBSCRIBE request according to
TS 24.229 [5], IETF RFC 3856 [39], and IETF RFC 6665 [36].
In the SIP SUBSCRIBE request, the MCData client:
1) shall set the Request-URI to the public service identity identifying the
originating participating MCData function serving the MCData user;
2) shall include an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body. In the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body, the MCData client shall
include:
a) the \ element set to the MCData ID of the targeted
MCData user; and
b) the \ element in the \ element of the
\ element set to the value \"functional-alias-status-
determination\";
3) shall include the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\"
(coded as specified in TS 24.229 [5]), in a P-Preferred-Service header field
according to IETF RFC 6050 [7];
4) if the MCData client wants to receive the current status and later
notification, shall set the Expires header field according to IETF RFC 6665
[36], to 4294967295;
NOTE 2: 4294967295, which is equal to 2^32^-1, is the highest value defined
for Expires header field in IETF RFC 3261 [4].
5) if the MCData client wants to fetch the current state only, shall set the
Expires header field according to IETF RFC 6665 [36], to zero;
6) shall include an Events header field set to \"presence\"; and
7) shall include an Accept header field containing the application/pidf+xml
MIME type.
In order to re-subscribe or de-subscribe, the MCData client shall generate an
in-dialog SIP SUBSCRIBE request according to TS 24.229 [5], IETF RFC 3856
[39], and IETF RFC 6665 [36]. In the SIP SUBSCRIBE request, the MCData client:
1) if the MCData client wants to receive the current status and later
notification, shall set the Expires header field according to IETF RFC 6665
[36], to 4294967295;
NOTE 3: 4294967295, which is equal to 2^32^-1, is the highest value defined
for Expires header field in IETF RFC 3261 [4].
2) if the MCData client wants to de-subscribe, shall set the Expires header
field according to IETF RFC 6665 [36], to zero;
3) shall include an Events header field set to \"presence\"; and
4) shall include an Accept header field containing the application/pidf+xml
MIME type.
Upon receiving a SIP NOTIFY request according to TS 24.229 [5], IETF RFC 3856
[39], and IETF RFC 6665 [36], if SIP NOTIFY request contains an
application/pidf+xml MIME body indicating per-user functional alias
information constructed according to clause 22.3.1, then the MCData client
shall determine the status of the MCData user for each functional alias in the
MIME body. If the \ child element of the \ root element of
the application/pidf+xml MIME body of the SIP NOTIFY request is included, the
\ element value indicates the SIP PUBLISH request which triggered
sending of the SIP NOTIFY request.
If the MCData client detected a functional alias activation or deactivation,
it shall perform the procedure specified in clause 8.2.6.
#### 22.2.1.4 Location based functional alias status change procedure
If a location criterion for functional alias activation or de-activation is
met, the MCData client shall initiate the functional alias status change
procedure as specified in clause 22.2.1.2.
### 22.2.2 MCData server procedures
#### 22.2.2.1 General
The MCData server procedures consist of:
\- procedures of MCData server serving the MCData user; and
\- procedures of MCData server owning the functional alias.
#### 22.2.2.2 Procedures of MCData server serving the MCData user
##### 22.2.2.2.1 General
The procedures of MCData server serving the MCData user consist of:
\- a receiving functional alias status change from MCData client procedure;
\- a receiving subscription to functional alias status procedure;
\- a sending notification of change of functional alias status procedure;
\- a sending functional alias status change towards MCData server owning the
functional procedure; and
\- a functional alias status determination from MCData server owning the
functional alias procedure.
##### 22.2.2.2.2 Stored information
The MCData server shall maintain a list of MCData user information entries.
The list of the MCData user information entries contains one MCData user
information entry for each served MCData ID.
In each MCData user information entry, the MCData server shall maintain:
1) an MCData ID. This field uniquely identifies the MCData user information
entry in the list of the MCData user information entries; and
2) a list of functional alias information entries.
In each functional alias information, the MCData server shall maintain:
1) a functional alias ID. This field uniquely identifies the functional alias
information entry in the list of the functional alias information entries;
2) a functional alias status;
3) an expiration time;
4) a functional alias p-id-fa; and
5) a next publishing time.
##### 22.2.2.2.3 Receiving functional alias status change from MCData client
procedure
Upon receiving a SIP PUBLISH request such that:
1) Request-URI of the SIP PUBLISH request contains either the public service
identity identifying the originating participating MCData function serving the
MCData user, or the public service identity identifying the terminating
participating MCData function serving the MCData user;
2) the SIP PUBLISH request contains an application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml
MIME body containing the\ element which identifies an
MCData ID served by the MCData server;
3) the ICSI value \"urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mcdata\" (coded as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5]), in a P-Asserted-Service header field

the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the SIP PUBLISH request;
2) if the Request-URI of the SIP PUBLISH request contains the public service
identity identifying the originating participating MCData function serving the
MCData user, shall identify the originating MCData ID from public user
identity in the P-Asserted-Identity header field of the SIP PUBLISH request;
3) if the Request-URI of the SIP PUBLISH request contains the public service
identity identifying the terminating participating MCData function serving the
MCData user, shall identify the originating MCData ID in the \ element of the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-info+xml MIME body of the
SIP PUBLISH request;
4) if the originating MCData ID is different than the served MCData ID or the
originating MCData ID is not authorized to modify functional alias status of
the served MCData ID, shall send a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response and shall not
continue with the rest of the steps;
5) if the Expires header field of the SIP PUBLISH request is not included or
has nonzero value lower than 4294967295, shall send a SIP 423 (Interval Too

# 23 Regroup using a preconfigured group
## 23.1 General
In the procedures in this clause:
1) temporary group identity in an incoming SIP MESSAGE request refers to the
temporary group identity from the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-regroup+xml MIME body of the incoming SIP MESSAGE
request; and
2) preconfigured group identity in an incoming SIP MESSAGE request refers to
the the group identity from the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-regroup+xml MIME body of the incoming SIP MESSAGE
request.
Regroup using a preconfigured group refers to the creation of a user/group
regroup based on the configuration information associated with an existing
group that is referred to as the preconfigured group. A regroup takes its
entire configuration from the preconfigured group, including security keys. If
the preconfigured group document contains a \ element that contains
a \ element, that \ element is not included in the configuration of the regroup.
All MCData servers and all MCData clients are configured with the
preconfigured group to allow immediate use of the regroup for a call upon
creation of the regroup.
A regroup using a preconfigured group is initiated by the MCData client
referencing a preconfigured group document in the GMS. The advantage of
regroup using a preconfigured group is speed of setup of the group, especially
when large numbers of users (e.g., thousands) are involved. Control of the
regroup using a preconfigured group is focused in the controlling MCData
function. Creation and removal of a regoup is normally initiated by an MCData
client. Removal can also be initiated by the controlling MCData function.

regroup using preconfigured group.
On receiving a SIP 4xx response, a SIP 5xx response or a SIP 6xx response to
the SIP INVITE request:
1) should notify the MCData user of the failure to create the user regroup
using preconfigured group.
#### 23.3.1.2 Removing a regroup using preconfigured group
When the user requests the MCData client to remove a user regroup, the MCData
client uses the procedure in clause 23.2.1.2.
#### 23.3.1.3 Creating a user regroup using preconfigured group
The procedure in clause 23.2.1.3 is used by the MCData client when the MCData
server notifies the MCData client of the creation of a user regroup using
preconfigured group.
#### 23.3.1.4 Removing a user regroup using preconfigured group
The procedure in clause 23.2.1.4 is used by the MCData client when the MCData
server notifies the MCData client of the removal of a user regroup using
preconfigured group.
### 23.3.2 Participating MCData function procedures
#### 23.3.2.1 General
In the procedures in this clause:
1) temporary group identity in an incoming SIP MESSAGE request refers to the
temporary group identity from the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-regroup+xml MIME body of the incoming SIP MESSAGE
request; and
2) preconfigured group identity in an incoming SIP MESSAGE request refers to
the the group identity from the \ element of the
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-regroup+xml MIME body of the incoming SIP MESSAGE
request.
#### 23.3.2.2 Requesting a user regroup using a preconfigured group
Upon receipt of a \"SIP MESSAGE request to the originating participating
MCData function to request creation of a user regroup using preconfigured
group\", the originating participating MCData function:
1) if unable to process the request due to a lack of resources or a risk of
congestion exists, may reject the SIP MESSAGE request with a SIP 500 (Server
Internal Error) response. The originating participating MCData function may
include a Retry-After header field to the SIP 500 (Server Internal Error)
response as specified in IETF RFC 3261 [4]. The originating participating
MCData function shall skip the rest of the steps;
2) shall determine the MCData ID of the user from the public user identity in
the P-Asserted-Identity header field of the SIP MESSAGE request;
3) shall authorise the user. If the user profile identified by the MCData ID
does not contain an \ element set to \"true\", the originating
participating MCData function shall reject the \"SIP MESSAGE request to the
originating participating MCData function to request creation of a user
regroup using preconfigured group\" with a SIP 403 (Forbidden) response to the
SIP MESSAGE request, with warning text set to \"160 user not authorised to
request creation of a regroup\" in a Warning header field as specified in
clause 4.9, and shall not continue with the rest of these steps;
4) shall select a controlling MCData function to manage the regroup and
determine the public service identity of the controlling MCData function;
NOTE 1: The public service identity can identify the controlling MCData
function in the local MCData system or in an interconnected MCData system.
NOTE 2: If the controlling MCData function is in an interconnected MCData
system in a different trust domain, then the public service identity can
identify the MCData gateway server that acts as an entry point in the
interconnected MCData system from the local MCData system.
NOTE 3: If the controlling MCData function is in an interconnected MCData
system in a different trust domain, then the local MCData system can route the
SIP request through an MCData gateway server that acts as an exit point from
the local MCData system to the interconnected MCData system.
NOTE 4: How the originating participating MCData function determines the
public service identity of the controlling MCData function or of the MCData
gateway server in the interconnected MCData system is out of the scope of the
present document.
NOTE 5: How the local MCData system routes the SIP request through an exit
MCData gateway server is out of the scope of the present document.
NOTE 6: How the originating participating MCData function selects a
controlling MCData function to manage the regroup is a deployment decision.
5) shall generate an outgoing SIP MESSAGE request in accordance with 3GPP TS
24.229 [5] and IETF RFC 3428 [6] and:

e) shall copy the contents of the P-Asserted-Identity header field of the
incoming SIP MESSAGE request to the P-Asserted-Identity header field of the
outgoing SIP MESSAGE request; and
6) shall send the SIP MESSAGE request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].
Upon receipt of a SIP 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response to the above SIP
MESSAGE request, the originating participating MCData function:
1) shall select a different controlling MCData function to manage the regroup
and determine the public service identity of that controlling MCData function;
2) shall generate a SIP MESSAGE request as specified in this clause with the
Request-URI of the outgoing SIP MESSAGE request set to the public service
identity of the controlling MCData function selected in step 1); and
3) shall forward the SIP MESSAGE request according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].

SIP 200 (OK) response;
3) shall include the public service identity received in the P-Asserted-
Identity header field of the incoming SIP 200 (OK) response into the
P-Asserted-Identity header field of the outgoing SIP 200 (OK) response; and
4) shall send the SIP 200 (OK) response to the MCData client according to 3GPP
TS 24.229 [5].
Upon receipt of a SIP 4xx response that is not a 480 response, or a SIP 5xx or
6xx response to the above SIP MESSAGE request, the originating participating
MCData function:
1) shall generate a SIP response according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [5];
2) shall include Warning header field(s) that were received in the incoming
SIP response; and
3) shall forward the SIP response to the MCData client according to 3GPP TS
24.229 [5].

## D.5.3 Semantic
The \ element is the root element of the XML document.
The \ element contains the subelements:
1) \ containing the following elements:
a) \ element contains a string used to indicate the
MCData listening status:
\- The value \"listening\" indicates that the MCData client now is receiving
RTP media packets and/or RTCP control packets over the MBMS subchannel in the
session identified by the \ element or if the \
element is set to \"true\", that the MCData client is now listening to the
general purpose MBMS subchannel.
\- The value \"not-listening\" indicates that the MCData client has stopped
listening to the MBMS subchannel in the session identified by the \ element or, if the \ element is set to \"false\", that
the MCData client no longer listens to the general purpose MBMS subchannel.
Table D.5.3-1 shows the ABNF of the \ element.
Table D.5.3-1: ABNF syntax of values of the \ element
mbms-listening-status = listening-value / not-listening-value
listening-value = %x6c.69.73.74.65.6e.69.6e.67 ; \"listening\"
not-listening-value = %x6e.6f.74.2d.6c.69.73.74.65.6e.69.6e.67 ; \"not-
listening\"
b) \ element contains the value of the URI received in the Contact
header field received from the controlling MCData function when an on-demand
session was established, or from the participating MCData function in the
Connect message when the session was established over a pre-established
session. This element is mandatory if the \ element is not
present in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml MIME body.
c) \ element is a boolean with the following meaning:
\- True indicates that the MCData client is listening to the general purpose
MBMS subchannel associated to the TMGI(s) in the \ element(s) but have
not yet received a Map Group To bearer message for any session that the MCData
client is involved in.
\- False indicates that the MCData client is not listening to the general
purpose MBMS subchannel any longer.
Absence of the \ element requires that the \
element is present in the application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-mbms-usage-info+xml; and
d) \: element contains the TMGI. The \ element is coded as
described in 3GPP TS 24.008 [62] clause 10.5.6.13 excluding the Temporary
Mobile Group Identity IEI and Length of Temporary Mobile Group Identity
contents (octet 1 and octet 2 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [62] clause 10.5.6.13).
2) \: contains the following subelements:
a) \: element is a string used to indicate the MBMS
bearers intended suspension status:
\- The value \"suspending\" indicates that the RAN has decided to suspend the
referenced MBMS bearer(s) at the beginning of the next MCCH modification
period.
\- The value \"not-suspending\" indicates that the RAN has decided to revoke
its decision to suspend the referenced MBMS bearer(s) before the beginning of
the next MCCH modification period.
Table D.5.3-2 shows the ABNF of the \ element.
Table D.5.3-2: ABNF syntax of values of the \ element
mbms-suspension-status = suspending-value / not-suspending-value
suspending-value = %x73.75.73.70.65.6e.64.69.6e.67 ; \"suspending\"
not-suspending-value = %x6e.6f.74.2d.73.75.73.70.65.6e.64.69.6e.67 ; \"not-
suspending\"
b) \: a hex binary number denoting the total
number of occurrences of the \ and \ elements
reported as part of the MBMS bearer suspension status;
c) \: contains a TMGI that is being reported as about to be
suspended or as no longer about to be suspended; and
d) \: contains a TMGI that is not being reported as about to be
suspended or as no longer about to be suspended, but which shares the same MCH
with MBMS bearers reported in the \ elements;
3) \ element containing the following elements:
a) \: contains the TMGI. The \ element is coded as described in
3GPP TS 24.008 [62] clause 10.5.6.13 excluding the Temporary Mobile Group
Identity IEI and Length of Temporary Mobile Group Identity contents (octet 1
and octet 2 in 3GPP TS 24.008 [62] clause 10.5.6.13);
b) \: element contains QCI information used by the ProSe UE-Network Relay
to determine the ProSe Per-Packet Priority value to be applied for the
multicast packets relayed to Remote UE over PC5. QCI values are defined in
3GPP TS 23.203 [63];
c) \: element containing identification of frequency in case of
multi carrier support. The \ element is coded as specified in 3GPP
TS 29.468 [57];
NOTE 1: In the current release the frequency in the \ element is
the same as the frequency used for unicast.
d) \: element is a list of MBMS service area IDs for the
applicable MBMS broadcast area as specified in 3GPP TS 23.003 [31] for Service
Area Identifier (SAI), and with the encoding as specified in 3GPP TS 29.061
[64] for the MBMS-Service-Area AVP;
e) \: element is a positive integer that gives the number of the media
line containing the general purpose MBMS subchannel in the application/sdp
MIME body attached to the SIP MESSAGE request containing the MBMS
announcements;
f) \: element is a boolean with the following meaning:
\- True indicates that the MCData client is instructed to notify the MCData
server when it becomes aware of an intended change in the suspension status of
a listened MBMS bearer.
\- False indicates that the MCData client is instructed not to notify the
MCData server if it becomes aware of an intended change in the suspension
status of a listened MBMS bearer ; and
g) \ element can contain the following elements not shown in the XML
schema:
i) \ element: presence of the \ element
indicates that the flows delivered by the announced MBMS bearer are header
compressed with ROHC as specified in RFC 5795 [60] and RFC 3095 [61]; and
ii) \ element: of type integer restricted to the range 1 to 16383
indicating the maximum CID value that can be used by the header compressor,
see clause 5.1.2 in RFC 5795 [60]). If max-cid > 15 then the header compressor
uses the large CID representation. Else, the header compressor uses the small
CID representation;
4) \ is an element of type \"xs:integer\" indicating the version of
the application/vnd.3gpp.mbms-usage-info MIME body. In this version the
\ indicates \"1\"; and
5) \ element can contain the following elements:
a) \ that can contain:
i) a \ element containing the identity, in the form of a URI, of a
group for which the MuSiK download is performed; and
b) \ that can contain:
i) a \ element containing the identity, in the form of a URI, of a
group for which the MuSiK download is performed.
The recipient of the XML ignores any unknown element and any unknown
attribute.

vnd.3gpp.mcdata-signalling
Required parameters:

Security considerations:
General mechanisms for privacy and integrity protection of protocol parameters
exist. Those mechanisms as well as authentication and further security
mechanisms are described in 3GPP TS 24.229.
Security mechanisms specific to this MIME type are dependent upon the business
and trust relationship between the mission critical data communications
(MCData) operator and the SIP carrier operator. MCData operators may wish to
encrypt and integrity protect the content transported by this MIME type
indepedently of mechanisms provided by the transport layer. Such mechanisms
are being specified in Rel-14 by 3GPP SA3. Security mechanisms applied to
MCData signalling content is point-to-point (UE to server, server to server,
server to UE).
The information transported in this media type does not include active or
executable content.
This media type does not include provisions for directives that institute
actions on a recipient\'s files or other resources.
This media type does not include provisions for directives that institute
actions that, while not directly harmful to the recipient, may result in
disclosure of information that either facilitates a subsequent attack or else
violates a recipient\'s privacy in any way.
This media type does not employ compression.
Interoperability considerations:
The content transported within this MIME type needs to be interpreted by a
server as specific decisions are made based on the signalling content (e.g.
store disposition history). The final destination point of the content is the
terminating UE. Each UE and server that handles the content transported using
this MIME type shall understand the definition of the messages and protocol
elements as defined in 3GPP TS 24.282. Any messages and protocol elements not
defined by 3GPP TS 24.282 shall be ignored by the recipient UE or server.

# E.2 MIME type for transporting MCData payload content
Your Name:
\
Your Email Address:
\
Media Type Name:
Application
Subtype name:
vnd.3gpp.mcdata-payload
Required parameters:
None
Optional parameters:
None
Encoding considerations:
binary.
Security considerations:
General mechanisms for privacy and integrity protection of protocol parameters
exist. Those mechanisms as well as authentication and further security
mechanisms are described in 3GPP TS 24.229.
Security mechanisms specific to this MIME type are dependent upon the business
and trust relationship between the mission critical data communications
(MCData) operator and the SIP carrier operator. MCData operators may wish to
encrypt and integrity protect the content transported by this MIME type
indepedently of mechanisms provided by the transport layer. Such mechanisms
are being specified in Rel-14 by 3GPP SA3. Security mechanisms applied to
MCData payload are end-to-end (UE to UE).
The information transported in this media type does not include active or
executable content.
This media type does not include provisions for directives that institute
actions on a recipient\'s files or other resources.
This media type does not include provisions for directives that institute
actions that, while not directly harmful to the recipient, may result in
disclosure of information that either facilitates a subsequent attack or else
violates a recipient\'s privacy in any way.
This media type does not employ compression.
Interoperability considerations:
The content transported within MIME type does not need to be interpreted by a
server. It represents the payload that is delivered to the end-user or an
application of the end-user. Each UE and server that handles the content
transported using this MIME type shall understand the definition of the
messages and protocol elements as defined in 3GPP TS 24.282. Any messages and
protocol elements not defined by 3GPP TS 24.282 shall be ignored by the
recipient UE or server.
Published specification:
3GPP TS 24.282 \"Mission Critical Data (MCData) signalling control; Protocol

###### ## Annex H (informative): INFO packages defined in the present document
# H.1 Info package for indication of communication release
## H.1.1 Scope
This clause contains the information required for the IANA registration of
info package g.3gpp.mcdata-com-release in accordance with IETF RFC 6086.
## H.1.2 g.3gpp.mcdata-com-release info package
### H.1.2.1 Overall description
When one of the communication release conditions are met e.g. lack of bearer
capacity, limit for the maximum amount of data or time that a participant
transmits from a single request to transmit exceeded, the MCData server may
decide to release communication. Based on local policy and configuration,
MCData server can release the communication without prior notification to
MCData user; or it may send a notification to MCData user and allow the user
to request for extension if the MCData user wants to. With this notification,
MCData server may also request for more information related to ongoing
communication like amount of data remainnig to be transmitted. If MCData user
requests for extension of the MCData communication, MCData server can accept
or reject based on local policy.
### H.1.2.2 Applicability
This package is used to:
\- send MCData server\'s intent to release the communication to the MCData
client
\- send more data from MCData client to MCData server when requested
\- request extension of the MCData communication to MCData server.
\- send response for extension request from MCData server to MCData client.
### H.1.2.3 Appropriateness of INFO Package Usage
A number of solutions were discussed for sending MCData server\'s intent to
release the communication along with request for more data to MCData user. The
solutions were:
1) Use of the session related methods (e.g. SIP RE-INVITE 200 (OK) response.
2) Use of the SIP INFO method as described in IETF RFC 6086, by defining a new
info package.
The result of the evaluation of the above solutions were:
1) An SIP INVITE request will have three-way handshake, which may not be
optimal to transfer the required data.
2) The use of SIP INFO request was found as the most appropriate solution
since the SIP INFO request could be sent in the existing SIP session and can
carry QUERY response in 200 OK.
### H.1.2.4 Info package name
g.3gpp.mcdata-com-release
### H.1.2.5 Info package parameters
None defined
### H.1.2.6 SIP options tags
None defined
### H.1.2.7 INFO message body parts
The MIME type of the message body carrying application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-
signalling and application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-payload. Both
application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-signalling and application/vnd.3gpp.mcdata-payload
MIME type is defined in this specification.
### H.1.2.8 Info package usage restrictions
None defined.
### H.1.2.9 Rate of INFO Requests
Single INFO request generated after MCData server decides to release
communication with prior notification to MCData client and not requesting for
more data.
Two INFO requests generated after MCData server decides to release
communication with prior notification to MCData client and requesting more
data.
Two INFO requests generated after MCData client requests for extension of
communication.
### H.1.2.10 Info package security considerations
The security is based on the generic security mechanism provided for the
underlying SIP signalling. No additional security mechanism is defined.
### H.1.2.11 Implementation details and examples
UAC generation of INFO requests: See 3GPP TS 24.282: \"Mission Critical Data
(MCData) signalling control; Protocol specification\".
UAS processing of INFO requests: See 3GPP TS 24.282: \"Mission Critical Data
(MCData) signalling control; Protocol specification\".
###### ## Annex I (normative): MCData session control specific concepts for
the support of mission critical services over 5GS
# I.1 General
The present document applies to both EPS and 5GS. This annex lists the aspects
of MCData session control protocols which are different in 5GS from EPS.
Certain aspects that are only applicable to EPS are described in clause I.2. A
mapping of EPS-specific terms to their 5GS equivalents is provided in clause
I.3.
# I.3 Mapping of EPS-specific terms to 5GS
## I.3.1 Session aspects
In 5GS, the PDU session is the equivalent of a PDN connection in EPS. The
requirements and configurations for a PDN connection throughout this document
shall also apply to PDU sessions.
## I.3.2 Bearer aspects
When using the 5GS, a bearer is provided by a 5GS QoS flow. The requirements,
procedures, and configurations for a bearer throughout this document,
including those stating EPS explicitly (e.g., EPS bearer priority), shall also
apply to QoS flows.
## I.3.3 Resource sharing
In 5GS, the exchange of the QoS characteristics of the required resources
takes place by means of direct interaction between SIP core and PCF using N5
reference point or Rx reference point or indirectly utilizing N33 reference
point between MC service server and NEF. Thus, the requirements for resource
sharing of clause 18 apply with the following clarifications:
1) to control resource sharing, interfacing to PCF is using the N5 reference
point or the Rx reference point;
2) optionally, QoS characteristics for resources can be exchanged indirectly
utilizing N33 reference point between the MC service server and NEF.
# I.2 Aspects not applicable to 5GS
The following aspects of EPS mentioned in the present document are not
applicable to 5GS:
\- Proximity-services (ProSe) and the corresponding procedures; and
\- Multimedia Broadcast and Multicast Service (MBMS) and the corresponding
procedures.
#
