# 1 Scope
The present document defines Management Objects (MO) that are used to
configure the ProSe-enabled UE.
The MOs are compatible with the OMA Device Management (DM) protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and are defined using the OMA DM
Device Description Framework (DDF) as described in the Enabler Release
Definition OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2 [3].
The MOs consist of relevant parameters for provisioning and authorisation of
ProSe at the ProSe-enabled UE.
The protocol aspects for ProSe are described in 3GPP TS 24.334 [4].

# 4 ProSe Direct Services Provisioning MO
## 4.1 Overview
The ProSe Direct Services Provisioning MO is used to manage ProSe direct
discovery authorisation and provisioning information for a ProSe-enabled non-
public safety UE.
The MO identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-prose-direct-provisioning:1.0.
The UE may initiate the provision of all available information from the DPF,
using a client-initiated session Alert message of code \"Generic Alert\" (see
OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5]). When requesting all available information from
the DPF, the \"Type\" element of the OMA DM generic alert message shall be set
to \"urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-prose-direct-provisioning:1.0:provision\", the
\"LocURI\" element (inside the \"Source\" element) shall be set to the address
of the ProSe Direct Services Provisioning MO as specified by OMA-TS-
DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5] and the \"Data\" element is not included.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism (see OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2
[3]) may be used to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to
modify nodes and leaf objects of the ProSe Direct Services Provisioning MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible in the ProSe Direct Services
Provisioning MO as described in figure 4.1.1:

# 5 ProSe Public Safety Direct Services Provisioning MO
## 5.1 Overview
The ProSe Public Safety Direct Services Provisioning MO is used to manage
ProSe direct discovery and ProSe direct communication authorisation and
provisioning information for a ProSe-enabled public safety UE.
The MO identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-prose-public-safety-direct-
provisioning:1.0.
The UE may initiate the provision of all available information from the DPF,
using a client-initiated session Alert message of code \"Generic Alert\" (see
OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5]). When requesting all available information from
the DPF, the \"Type\" element of the OMA DM generic alert message shall be set

provisioning:1.0:provision\", the \"LocURI\" element (inside the \"Source\"
element) shall be set to the address of the ProSe Public Safety Direct
Services Provisioning MO as specified by OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5] and the
\"Data\" element is not included.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism (see OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2
[3]) may be used to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to
modify nodes and leaf objects of the ProSe Public Safety Direct Services
Provisioning MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible in the ProSe Public Safety
Direct Services Provisioning MO as described in figure 5.1.1 and figure 5.1.2,

# 6 EPC-level ProSe discovery Provisioning MO
## 6.1 Overview
The EPC-level ProSe discovery Provisioning MO is used to manage configuration
parameters related to the EPC-level ProSe discovery.
The MO identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-EPC-level-prose-discovery-
provisioning:1.0.
The UE may initiate the provision of all available information from the DPF,
using a client-initiated session Alert message of code \"Generic Alert\" (see
OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5]). When requesting all available information from
the DPF, the \"Type\" element of the OMA DM generic alert message shall be set
to \"urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-EPC-level-prose-discovery-
provisioning:1.0:provision\", the \"LocURI\" element (inside the \"Source\"
element) shall be set to the address of the EPC-level ProSe discovery
Provisioning MO as specified by OMA-TS-DM_Protocol-V1_2 [5] and the \"Data\"
element is not included.
The OMA DM Access Control List (ACL) property mechanism (see OMA-ERELD-DM-V1_2
[3]) may be used to grant or deny access rights to OMA DM servers in order to
modify nodes and leaf objects of the EPC-level ProSe discovery Provisioning
MO.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible in the EPC-level ProSe
discovery Provisioning MO as described in figure 6.1.1:
Figure 6.1.1: EPC-level ProSe discovery Provisioning MO
## 6.2 EPC-level ProSe discovery Provisioning MO parameters
### 6.2.1 General
This clause describes the parameters for the EPC-level ProSe discovery
Provisioning MO.
### 6.2.2 _\ _/ToConRef
The ToConRef interior node is used to allow application to refer to a
collection of connectivity definitions. Several connectivity parameters can be
listed for a given application under this interior node.
This interior node contains configuration parameters for establishment of the
PDN connection for reaching the HPLMN ProSe Function.

\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: N/A
### 6.2.3 _\ _/ToConRef/\

### 6.2.5 _\ _/Ext
The Ext is an interior node for where the vendor specific information about
the EPC-level ProSe discovery Provisioning MO is being placed (vendor meaning
application vendor, device vendor etc.). Usually the vendor extension is
identified by vendor specific name under the ext node. The tree structure
under the vendor identifier is not defined and can therefore include one or
more un-standardized sub-trees.
