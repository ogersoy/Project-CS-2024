# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the media plane control protocols and
interactions with the media needed to support Mission Critical Push To Talk
(MCPTT).
The present document specifies protocol for using pre-established session to
setup calls, floor control and managing MBMS subchannels over MBMS bearers on-
network and off-network protocols for floor control.
Mission critical communication services are services that require preferential
handling compared to normal telecommunication services, e.g. in support of
police or fire brigade. Floor control provides a mechanism for managing the
right to transmit at a point in time during an MCPTT call.
The MCPTT service and its associated media plane control protocols can be used
for public safety applications and also for general commercial applications
(e.g., utility companies and railways).
The present document is applicable to User Equipment (UE) supporting the floor
participant functionality, setting up calls using pre-established SIP sessions
and using MBMS bearers for group communication and to floor control servers
supporting these functions in the MCPTT system.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Overview
### 4.1.1 Floor Control
#### 4.1.1.1 General
In a PTT group call after the call is setup, at a given time only a single
group member is allowed to talk and all other affiliated group members listen
to this talker. The control action for obtaining this mode of operation is
known as floor control. The direct actors of floor control are the floor
participants and the floor control server. A floor participant does the floor
control related actions in the MCPTT client. The floor control server is the
decision maker of the floor control. In on-network the floor control server is
in the MCPTT server with the controlling role. In off-network no specific
floor control server exists. The current talker plays the role of floor
control server.
Floor control actions in on-network are described in clause 4.1.1.2. The
differences for off-network floor control are described in clause 4.1.1.3.
NOTE: End-user actions as operation of the PTT button illustrates
functionality but no end-user actions are mandated by the present document.
#### 4.1.1.2 On-network floor control
At any point in time a group member can request permission to talk.
When all group members are silent, a group member can press the PTT button,
meaning the request for permission to talk. The floor participant entity of
this user reflects this request to the floor control server by sending a Floor
Request message. If the floor control server decides to permit, it informs
this permission for this request by sending a Floor Granted message to the
requesting group member. The floor control server informs the initiation of
the talk to the other group members by sending a Floor Taken message. Once the
group member receives the permission, a permission indication (permission
tone) is generated by the client to inform the user that they can talk. The
media packets (encoded voice) are sent to the controlling MCPTT server and
from there they are distributed to all listeners of this group. The release of
the PTT button indicates the user\'s intention to end talking. Once the PTT
button is released, the floor participant sends a Floor Release message to the
floor control server indicating that this user has finished talking. This
cycle, starting from the Floor Granted message and ending with Floor Release
message, is known as \'talk burst\' or \'media burst\'.
In the beginning of a call the initial talk permission request can be implied
by the SIP message which initiates the call as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2]
without any specific Floor Request message. For ambient listening, the implied
talk permission request can be applied to the user on the originating side or
to the user on the terminating side.
A group member can also request permission to talk by sending a Floor Request
message during a talk burst. The floor control server can resolve this request
in several ways.
1\. If this request has higher priority than the ongoing talk burst, the floor
control server revokes the current talk burst by sending a Floor Revoke
message to the current talker. The current talker is interrupted and the
current media burst is ended by the current floor participant by sending a
Floor Release message. Then the floor control server sends a Floor Granted
message to the revoking user and send Floor Taken message to other group
members. Then a new media burst starts.
2\. If this request does not have higher priority and floor request queueing
is not used the floor control server rejects this request by sending a Floor
Deny message to the requester. Then a reject indication (reject tone) is
generated for the user. The ongoing talk burst continues.
3\. If request queueing is used the floor control server sends Floor Queue
Position Info message indicating that there is no permission but the request
is queued for potential permission when the current talk burst ends. Then a
\"queued\" indication is generated for the user. The ongoing talk burst
continues.
In the case of an ambient listening call, the user initially granted the floor
retains the floor for the duration of the call.
During a talk burst, a queued user can ask its position in the queue by
sending a Floor Queue Position Request message. Then the floor control server
provides the information by sending Floor Queue Position Info message. A
queued user can also remove itself from the queue by sending a Floor Release
message. This kind of message exchange during a talk burst does not affect the
ongoing talk burst.
If request queueing is used, by the end of a talk burst, the floor control
server gives the talk permission to the first pending request in the queue.
For this, it sends the same messages as in the beginning of a talk burst;
Floor Granted message to the permitted user and Floor Taken message to other
group members. The permitted user is expected to press the PTT button after
the permission tone within a well-defined short period of time. If PTT button
is pressed the media burst continues normally until it is released. If not,
the MCPTT client loses the talk permission.
If queueing is used the ordering in the queue is affected by the priority of
the users in the queue.
A floor request with pre-emptive priority can be granted without revoking the
current speaker. In this case media from both the overridden current talker
and the overriding MCPTT user is distributed to selected participants at the
same time. The list of participants that receive the overriding, overridden,
or both transmissions is based on configuration.
Pre-emptive priority without revoking the current talker is not applicable if
the group is configured for audio cut-in floor control.
If a group is configured as multi-talker group, floor request can be granted
to a group member which is allowed to talk in this group without revoking the
current talker, provided the number of simultaneous talkers is not greater
than \"maximum number of simultaneous talkers\". If the upper limit is reached
one of the talkers can be revoked or the current request can be denied based
on relative priorities. If configured, when the floor request of an allowed
user is not granted the participant requesting the floor may also be queued.
During silence (when no talk burst is ongoing), the floor control server can
send Floor Idle message to all floor participants from time to time. The floor
control server sends Floor Idle message in the beginning of silence.
Some of the floor control messages can be repeated as specified in state
machines specified in clause 6.
The call can be released after a long silence period.
#### 4.1.1.3 Off-network floor control
This clause describes the special features for off-network floor control with
respect to the on-network floor control.
In off-network no specific floor control server exists. All floor control
messages are sent to all group members.
When a floor control server gives talk permission it sends a Floor Granted
message. The information element which expresses the group member, to which
this talk permission is given, implies to the other group members that the
floor is taken. No other Floor Taken message is sent.
After silence, a floor participant asks for talk permission by sending a Floor
Request message. After a well-defined waiting period, if no response is
received, this floor participant sends a Floor Taken message indicating itself
in the information element which expresses the group member to which this talk
permission is given and continues the talk burst.
In off-network, the Floor Idle message is not used.
Some of the floor control messages can be repeated as specified in the state
machines specified in clause 7.
Audio cut-in floor control is not applicable for off-network.
#### 4.1.1.4 Determine on-network effective priority
The floor control server can determine how to handle a received Floor Request
message using a number of input parameters. Examples of input parameters that
the floor control server can use are:
1\. the floor priority, using the value of the Floor Priority field in the
Floor Request message;
2\. the \ element as specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [12];
3\. the \ element as specified in 3GPP TS
24.484 [13];
4\. the participant type, using the \ element specified in
3GPP TS 24.481 [12] or, in case a non-controlling MCPTT function is attached
to a group call, the \ value in the Track Info field in the
Floor Request message;
5\. the type of call indicated in the Floor Indicator field;
6\. the effective priority of the floor participant with the permission to
send media, and the current type of the call (e.g. normal, imminent-peril,
emergency, broadcast); and
7\. any other information in the group document specified in 3GPP TS 24.481
[12] or information stored in the controlling MCPTT function outside the scope
of the present document.
Using a local policy and the above input parameters the floor control server
can determine that a floor request is:
1\. pre-emptive such that the current talker is overridden;
2\. pre-emptive such that the current talker is revoked;
3\. not pre-emptive and put in the floor request queue, if queueing was
negotiated; or
4\. not-pre-emptive and rejected, if queueing was not negotiated.
#### 4.1.1.5 Determine off-network effective priority
The floor control participant can determine how to handle a received Floor
Request message using the following input parameters:
1\. the floor priority, using the value of the Floor Priority field in the
Floor Request message;
2\. the value of the
\"/\/\/Common/MCPTTGroupMemberList/\/UserPriority\" leaf node of the
sender of the Floor Request message, present in group configuration as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4];
3\. the value of the \"/\/OffNetwork/NumLevelHierarchy\" leaf node present
in service configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4];
4\. the type of call indicated in the Floor Indicator field; and
5\. the effective priority of the floor participant with the permission to
send media, and the current type of the call (e.g. normal, imminent-peril,
emergency).
Using the policy as described in clause 7.2.1.2, and the above input
parameters the floor control participant can determine that a floor request
is:
1\. pre-emptive such that the current talker is revoked;
2\. not pre-emptive and put in the floor request queue, if the value of
\"/\/\/OffNetwork/QueueUsage\" leaf node present in the group
configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4] is set to \"true\"; or
3\. not-pre-emptive and rejected, if the value of
\"/\/\/OffNetwork/QueueUsage\" leaf node present in the group
configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4] is set to \"false\".
### 4.1.2 Pre-established session call control
#### 4.1.2.1 General
An MCPTT client can pre-establish a session with the participating MCPTT
function for potential use when a call is setup. The establishment, the
modification and the release of a pre-established session are specified in
3GPP TS 24.379 [2].
NOTE: The establishment of a pre-established session, for potential use when a
call is setup, depends on the policy chosen by the MCPTT service provider.
A pre-established session can be used when initiating a pre-arranged group
call, a chat group call or a private call. Similarly, a pre-established
session can be released for reuse after the termination of a pre-arranged
group call, chat group call and private call.
The media plane control messages related to call setup over a pre-established
session are sent over the channel used for media plane control. The media
plane control messages related to the release of a call which was setup over a
pre-established session, without terminating the pre-established session, are
sent over the channel used for media plane control. The unicast channel for
media plane control is over the MCPTT-4 reference point.
#### 4.1.2.2 Call setup over pre-established session
For a pre-arranged group call, when the originator initiates the call setup
indicating the use of a pre-established session using SIP messages as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2], the participating MCPTT function (which
serves the originating MCPTT client) sends to the originating MCPTT client a
Connect message after the controlling MCPTT function accepts the initiation of
this call. After the reception of this Connect message the originating MCPTT
client sends an Acknowledgment message indicating that the connection is
accepted or indicating that the connection is not accepted. If the connection
is accepted by the originating MCPTT client, the floor control for this call
continues as specified in clause 6.
For a pre-arranged group call if the controlling MCPTT function as triggered
by an originating group member initiates a call as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379
[2], the participating MCPTT function which serves the terminating MCPTT
client sends a Connect message to all affiliated MCPTT clients of this group.
After the reception of the Connect message the terminating MCPTT client sends
an Acknowledgment message indicating that the connection is accepted or
indicating that the connection is not accepted. If the connection is accepted
by the terminating MCPTT client, the floor control for this call continues as
specified in clause 6.
NOTE: If a terminating client does not have an available pre-established
session, the call setup proceeds as in on-demand call setup as specified in
3GPP TS 24.379 [2].
For a chat group call, a group member can use a pre-established session when
joining the chat group using SIP messages as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2].
For a group member that has already joined the chat group call, the floor
control between the MCPTT client (floor participant) and the MCPTT server
(floor control server) continues as specified in clause 6.
For a private call the procedures for the originator are the same as for the
originator initiating a call for a pre-arranged call setup over a pre-
established session, with the difference that the recipient of the call is a
private user and not a pre-arranged group.
For a private call if the controlling MCPTT function as triggered by the
originator initiates a call as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2], the
participating MCPTT function (which serves the terminating MCPTT client) sends
a Connect message to the terminating MCPTT client served by the participating
MCPTT function if this MCPTT client has an available pre-established session
and the commencement mode is automatic. If the commencement mode is manual the
terminating MCPTT client is invited using SIP procedures as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.379 [2].
#### 4.1.2.3 Release of a call which uses a pre-established session
When a call is released by the controlling MCPTT function (as specified in
3GPP TS 24.379 [2]), the participating MCPTT function sends a Disconnect
message to all MCPTT clients which used a pre-established session for this
call. Then the call is released (see also 3GPP TS 24.379 [2]) and the pre-
established session can be used for another call.
When an MCPTT client leaves a call (as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2]) which
was setup over a pre-established session without releasing the pre-established
session, this pre-established session can be used for another call.
A call setup over a pre-established session can also be released by using the
specifications in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2] (without the use of Disconnect message).
As a result the pre-established session, which has been used for this call, is
also released.
### 4.1.3 MBMS subchannel control
#### 4.1.3.1 General
The participating MCPTT function can use an MBMS bearer for the DL
transmission of the media and the media control plane.
The participating MCPTT function decides to activate an MBMS bearer. After the
activation of the MBMS bearer, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.468 [6], the TMGI of
this MBMS bearer is announced to the MCPTT clients in the MBMS service area of
this MBMS bearer. This announcement enables the MCPTT client to listen
(decode/demodulate) this MBMS bearer. The activation of an MBMS bearer and the
announcement of the TMGI create a pool of MBMS subchannel resources without
any association to a group or other purposes.
The criteria for a participating MCPTT function to decide to activate and use
an MBMS bearer is implementation dependent.
An MBMS bearer can be used for the DL transmission for more than one group.
For this, additional parameters like destination UDP port are used for
enabling the differentiation of messages and packets belonging to different
groups over the same MBMS bearer by a receiving MCPTT client.
When a TMGI is announced a general purpose MBMS subchannel is created by
defining an association between the identity of the general purpose MBMS
subchannel (e.g. \'general purpose\') and the TMGI (of the activated and
announced MBMS bearer) together with the parameters (e.g. UDP port)
differentiating this general purpose MBMS subchannel in this MBMS bearer. The
parameters of this general purpose MBMS subchannel can be communicated to the
MCPTT clients in the MBMS service area of this MBMS bearer using unicast over-
the air transmission or can be pre-defined and stored in the MCPTT user
profile that is downloaded to the MCPTT UE.
#### 4.1.3.2 Start of a conversation
When a conversation is started (by an originating MCPTT client of a group) the
participating MCPTT function can allocate an MBMS subchannel for this group by
defining an association between this group (e.g. \'group id\') and the TMGI
(of the activated and announced MBMS bearer) with the parameters
differentiating this MBMS subchannel in this MBMS bearer. The parameters of
this MBMS subchannel are sent using the general purpose MBMS subchannel using
the Map Group To Bearer message. The Map Group To Bearer message is repeated
as long as the conversation is ongoing for improving the reception probability
and to allow MCPTT clients arriving late to listen to the MBMS subchannel.
The same MBMS subchannel can be used for media and media control plane of an
MCPTT group, subjected to the restrictions stated in IETF RFC 5761 [7].
#### 4.1.3.3 During a conversation
If an MBMS subchannel exists, the participating MCPTT function forwards the
media plane control messages, received from the controlling MCPTT function via
MBMS subchannel for media plane control. Only floor control messages which are
transmitted to more than one affiliated group member are forwarded to the MBMS
bearer (e.g. the Floor Taken and Floor Idle messages). The floor control
messages can be repeated a configurable number of times for improving the
reception probability. The participating MCPTT function forwards the media
packets, received from the controlling MCPTT function, via the MBMS subchannel
for media.
Amongst all affiliated group members under this participating MCPTT function,
the participating MCPTT function is informed or is enabled to deduce the group
members which do not or cannot receive the MBMS subchannels. The participating
MCPTT function forwards the media packets and the media plane control
messages, received from the controlling MCPTT function, to the group members
which do not or cannot receive the MBMS subchannels, using unicast bearers
allocated for media and media plane control respectively.
#### 4.1.3.4 Ending the conversation
The participating MCPTT function can de-allocate an MBMS subchannel after a
configurable period of silence in the conversation by removing the association
to this group by sending the Unmap Group To Bearer message over this MBMS
subchannel. The de-allocation of the MBMS subchannel frees the parameters used
for differentiating this MBMS subchannel in this MBMS bearer. Therefore, the
resources of a de-allocated MBMS subchannel can be reallocated for a
conversation of another group.
NOTE: The participating MCPTT function will activate MBMS bearers with general
QoS characteristics suitable for MCPTT service and will map MBMS subchannels
for media or media plane control only to MBMS bearers that can provide the QoS
required by media or media plane control.
#### 4.1.3.5 Starting a call over unicast bearers
The participating MCPTT function can prior to starting a call over unicast
bearers send an Application Paging message, using the MBMS subchannel, to the
group intended for the conversation. The procedures to initiate the
conversation over the unicast bearers then proceed as described in clause 10.
#### 4.1.3.6 Moving a conversation to unicast bearers
The participating MCPTT function can move an ongoing conversation from an MBMS
bearer to unicast bearers by first sending an Application Paging message using
the MBMS subchannel, and then sending an Unmap Group To Bearer message. After
the Unmap Group To Bearer message the conversation continues using the unicast
bearers.
#### 4.1.3.7 MBMS bearer announcement over an MBMS bearer
The participating MCPTT function can activate an MBMS bearer that previously
has been announced over a unicast bearer by sending an MBMS bearer
announcement over an MBMS bearer. The MCPTT client acknowledges that it can
listen to the MBMS bearer by sending a listening status report.
## 4.2 Internal structure of media plane control entities
### 4.2.1 Controlling MCPTT function
According to 3GPP TS 23.379 [5] the controlling MCPTT function is divided into
a floor control server and a media distribution function. In the present
document the internal structure of the MCPTT server is illustrated in figure
4.2-1.
NOTE: The real internal structure of the MCPTT server is implementation
specific but a possible internal structure is shown to illustrate the
procedures.
Figure 4.2.1-1: Internal structure of floor control in the controlling MCPTT
function
All entities in the controlling MCPTT function are assumed to have a direct
communication interface to the application and signalling plane. The interface
to the application and signaling plane carries information about SIP session
initialisation and SIP session release, SDP content, etc.
The reference point MCPTT-3 is described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [5].
The floor control interface towards the MCPTT client receives and transmits
the floor control messages from and to the MCPTT client via the participating
MCPTT function or non-controlling MCPTT function. The procedures are
controlled by a state machine described in clause 6.3.5. One state machine is
needed for each MCPTT client participating in an MCPTT call. A non-controlling
MCPTT function is seen by the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client
as an MCPTT client.
The floor control arbitration logic is performing the floor control. The floor
control arbitration logic is controlled by a state machine described in clause
6.3.4. One state machine is needed per MCPTT call.
The floor request queue is accessible both by the floor control interface
towards the MCPTT client for all MCPTT clients in the call and the floor
control arbitration logic.
The network media interface is receiving and sending media from and to the
associated MCPTT client via the participating MCPTT function or non-
controlling MCPTT function. The network media interface is out of scope of the
present document. One network media interface is needed for each MCPTT client
participating in an MCPTT call. A non-controlling MCPTT function is seen by
the network media interface as an MCPTT client.
The media distributor is controlled by the floor control arbitration logic.
The media distributor is out of scope of the present document. One media
distributor is needed per MCPTT call.
The internal interfaces are assumed to transport the following types of
information.
1\. The interface between the network media interface and the floor control
interface towards the MCPTT client:
a. Indication that the network media interface has started to receive media
packets from the associated MCPTT client or that media packets are no longer
received from the associated MCPTT client.
NOTE: It is an implementation option whether an indication e.g. is sent for
every received RTP media packet or only when the first packet is received and
then when no more RTP packets are received.
2\. The interface between the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client
and the floor control arbitration logic:
a. Floor control messages to and from the associated MCPTT client, requests to
create or delete the state machine instance for the associated MCPTT client.
The floor control messages to the floor control arbitration logic are limited
to floor control messages that will change the state of the floor.
3\. The interface between the network media interface and the media
distributor:
a. Media to and from associated MCPTT clients. This interface is out of scope
of the present document.
4\. The interface between the floor control arbitration logic and the media
distributor:
a. Requests to start or stop distributing media to participants in the MCPTT
call. Indication that the media distributor has started to receive media
packets from the network media interface associated with the MCPTT client with
the permission to send media or that media packets are no longer received from
the network media interface from the associated MCPTT client.
5\. The interface between the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client
and the floor request queue:
a. Requests to store received Floor Request messages in the queue or requests
to remove Floor Request messages from the queue and the queue content for
building the Floor Queue Position Info message.
6\. The interface between the floor control arbitration logic and the floor
request queue:
a. Requests to store received Floor Request messages in the queue or requests
to remove Floor Request messages from the queue. Indications that the queue is
modified.
### 4.2.2 MCPTT client
According to 3GPP TS 23.379 [5] the MCPTT client is divided into a floor
participant and a media mixer function. In the present document the internal
structure of the MCPTT client is illustrated in figure 4.2.2-1.
NOTE: The real internal structure of the MCPTT client is implementation
specific but a possible internal structure is shown to illustrate the logic
and the procedures.
Figure 4.2.2-1: Internal structure of the MCPTT client
All entities in the MCPTT client have a direct communication interface to the
application and signalling plane. The interface to the application and
signaling plane carries information about SIP session initialisation and SIP
session release, SDP content, etc.
The reference points MCPTT-4, MCPTT-7, MCPTT-8 and MCPTT-9 are described in
3GPP TS 23.379 [5].
The floor participant receives and sends floor control and pre-established
session control message over the unicast bearer.
The media mixer receives and sends RTP media packets over the unicast bearer.
The media mixer indicates to the floor participant when RTP media packets are
received and when RTP media packets are no longer received. The floor
participant instructs the media mixer on how to handle media received from the
user or received from the network either over the unicast bearer or over the
MBMS bearer.
The MBMS interface receives RTP media packets over the MBMS bearer. The RTP
media packets are forwarded to the media mixer.
The MBMS interface receives floor control messages and MBMS subchannel control
messages over the MBMS bearer. The MBMS interface forward received floor
control messages to the floor participants.
The floor participant receives indication from the MCPTT client when the MCPTT
user has pressed or released the PTT button. The MCPTT client can also provide
notification towards the MCPTT user. Voice received from the MCPTT user is, on
instruction from the floor participant, encoded by the media mixer and sent as
RTP media packets over the unicast bearer.
### 4.2.3 Participating MCPTT function
#### 4.2.3.1 General
The participating MCPTT function performs the participating role of an MCPTT
server as defined in 3GPP TS 23.379 [5]. The participating MCPTT function uses
media plane control (non-SIP) messages when taking part in the floor control
procedures as specified in clause 6, call over pre-established session as
specified in clause 9 and the use of MBMS Bearer procedures as specified in
clause 10. In the sequel the term \'controlling MCPTT function\' is used for
the entity which performs the controlling role of an MCPTT server.
The following clauses describe the assumed internal structure of a
participating MCPTT function and the role of the participating function in the
floor control procedures, the call over pre-established session procedures and
the use of MBMS Bearer procedures.
#### 4.2.3.2 Internal structure of the participating MCPTT function
In the present document the internal structure of the participating MCPTT
function is illustrated in figure 4.2.3.2-1.
NOTE: The real internal structure of the participating MCPTT function is
implementation specific but a possible internal structure is shown to
illustrate the logic and the procedures.
Figure 4.2.3.2-1: Internal structure of the MCPTT client
All entities in the participating MCPTT function have a direct communication
interface to the application and signalling plane. The interface to the
application and signalling plane carries information about SIP session
initialisation and SIP session release, SDP content, etc.
The reference points MCPTT-3, MCPTT-4, MCPTT-7, MCPTT-8 and MCPTT-9 are
described in 3GPP TS 23.379 [5].
The media and floor control message distribution receives media control
messages and RTP media packets to and from the MCPTT client and the
controlling MCPTT function and the non-controlling MCPTT function. Media plane
control messages and RTP packets are forwarded as received when unicast
bearers are used. If MBMS bearers are used for floor control messages, MBMS
subchannel control messages and RTP media packets are sent to the MBMS bearer
management.
The MBMS bearer management receives floor control message and RTP media
packets from the media and floor control message distribution when floor
control messages and RTP media packets are sent over an MBMS bearer. MBMS
bearer management also generates MBMS subchannel control message. Floor
control message, RTP media packets and MBMS subchannel control messages are
sent to the GCS AS for distribution over an MBMS bearer. The GCS AS is outside
the scope of the present specification.
#### 4.2.3.3 The roles of the participating MCPTT function
##### 4.2.3.3.1 For the floor control procedures
When a floor control message or a media packet is received from an MCPTT
client, in the MCPTT-4 and MCPTT-7 reference points respectively, the
participating MCPTT function forwards it to the controlling MCPTT function
over MCPTT-3 reference point or to the application and signalling plane. When
a floor control message or a media packet is received from the controlling
MCPTT function, over MCPTT-3 reference point or the application and signalling
plane, for MCPTT clients which do not use an MBMS subchannel, the
participating MCPTT function forwards the floor control message to the MCPTT
client over the MCPTT-4 and MCPTT-7 reference points respectively. For MCPTT
clients which use an MBMS subchannel, for floor control messages directed to
all of these MCPTT clients and for media packets, the participating MCPTT
function forwards a single floor control message or a single media packet
using the MBMS subchannel over MCPTT-9 and MCPTT-8 reference points
respectively.
When MCPTT clients are listening to the MBMS subchannel multiple copies of the
same media packet destined to each individual MCPTT client are sent by the
controlling MCPTT function while the participating MCPTT function only
forwards one single media packet over the MBMS bearer. Any optimizations for
not sending the media packet from the controlling MCPTT function to all MCPTT
clients are out of scope of the present document.
When MCPTT clients are listening to the MBMS subchannel multiple copies of the
same Floor Idle message and Floor Taken message destined to each individual
MCPTT client are sent by the controlling MCPTT function while the
participating MCPTT function only forwards one single Floor Idle or Floor
Taken message over the MBMS bearer. Any optimizations for not sending the
Floor Idle or Floor Taken message from the controlling MCPTT function to all
MCPTT clients are out of scope of the present document.
The participating MCPTT function specifications related to the floor control
are specified in clause 6.4 for unicast media and media plane control delivery
and in clause 10.3.3 for MBMS delivery.
##### 4.2.3.3.2 For the call over pre-established session procedures
For a pre-established session between an MCPTT client and the participating
MCPTT function, when a call is initiated over this pre-established session,
the participating MCPTT function informs the originating MCPTT client the
acceptance or rejection decision of the controlling MCPTT function by sending
Connect or Disconnect messages respectively over MCPTT-4 reference point. When
a call initiation is accepted by the controlling server and informed to the
participating MCPTT function, the participating MCPTT function informs the
terminating MCPTT client which has a pre-established session the initiation of
this call, using Connect message over MCPTT-4 reference point.
When the controlling MCPTT function informs the participating MCPTT function
that a call which is setup over a pre-established session is released (either
over the MCPTT-3 reference point or from application and signalling plane),
the participating MCPTT function informs the MCPTT client the release of this
call using Disconnect message over MCPTT-4 reference point. By the end of the
release of the call the pre-established session is reserved for possible
future use.
When an Acknowledgment message is received, over the MCPTT-4 reference point,
as result of a message informing the MCPTT client for the initiation, the
rejection or the release related to a call conducted over a pre-established
session, the participating MCPTT function communicates the positive or
negative acknowledgment information towards the controlling MCPTT function
according to the procedures in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2] (either over MCPTT-3
reference point or from application and signalling plane).
The participating MCPTT function specifications related to the call setup over
pre-established session are in clause 9.3.
##### 4.2.3.3.3 For the use of MBMS bearer procedures
In the initiation of a conversation, if the MBMS bearer management in the
participating MCPTT function decides to use an MBMS subchannel for the media
plane control messages and the media packets, the participating MCPTT function
sends a Map Group To Bearer message over the MCPTT-9 reference point, for
indicating the association information between the group identity of this call
and the TMGI of the MBMS bearer and additional parameters necessary for the
identification of this MBMS subchannel using the general purpose MBMS
subchannel already associated for the transmission of this information. In the
termination of a conversation the participating MCPTT function sends an Unmap
Group To Bearer message for terminating the association between the MBMS
subchannel in use for this conversation and the group identity.
The participating MCPTT function specifications related to the declaration of
the association between an MBMS bearer and related parameters and the MBMS
subchannel for media and media plane control are specified in clause 10.3.2
and clause 10.3.4.
### 4.2.4 Non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT group
According to 3GPP TS 24.379 [2] clause 5.3 the MCPTT server can act in a non-
controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT group role. In the present document the
internal structure of the non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT group is
illustrated in figure 4.2.4-1.
NOTE: The real internal structure of the MCPTT server is implementation
specific but a possible internal structure is shown to illustrate the logic
and the procedures.
Figure 4.2.4-1: Internal structure of the non-controlling MCPTT function
All entities in the non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT group are
assumed to have a direct communication interface to the application and
signalling plane. The interface to the application and signaling plane carries
information about SIP session initialisation and SIP session release, SDP
content, etc.
The floor participant interface receives and transmits the floor control
messages from and to the MCPTT client via the participating MCPTT function or
non-controlling MCPTT function. The procedures are controlled by a state
machine described in clause 6.5.5. One state machine is needed for each MCPTT
client participating in an MCPTT call. A non-controlling MCPTT function is
seen by the floor participant interface as an MCPTT client.
The floor control server interface is distributing floor control message to
and from the floor control server in the controlling MCPTT function or non-
controlling MCPTT function. The floor control server interface procedures are
described in clause 6.5.4. One floor control server interface is needed per
MCPTT call.
The network media interface is receiving and sending media from and to the
associated MCPTT client via the participating MCPTT function or non-
controlling MCPTT function. The network media interface is out of scope of the
present document. One network media interface is needed for each MCPTT client
participating in an MCPTT call. A non-controlling MCPTT function is seen by
the network media interface as an MCPTT client.
The media distributor is controlled by the floor control server interface. The
media distributor is out of scope of the present document. One media
distributor is needed per MCPTT call.
The internal interfaces are assumed to transport the following type of
information.
1\. The interface between the network media interface and the floor
participant interface:
a. Indication that the network media interface has started to receive media
packets from the associated MCPTT client and requests from the floor
participant interface to forward received RTP packets towards the media
distributor or to stop forward RTP media packets to the media distributor.
NOTE: It is an implementation option whether an indication e.g. is sent for
every received RTP media packet or only when the first packet is received.
2\. The interface between the floor participant interface and the floor
control server interface:
a. Floor control messages to and from the associated floor participant. The
floor control message to the floor control server interface are limited to
floor control messages that can result in an action towards the floor control
server.
3\. The interface between the network media interface and the media
distributor:
a. RTP media packets to and from associated MCPTT clients. This interface is
out of scope of the present document.
4\. The interface between the floor control server interface and the media
distributor:
a. Requests to start or stop distributing media to participants in the MCPTT
call. Indication that the media distributor has started to receive media
packets from the network media interface associated with the MCPTT client with
the permission to send media.
## 4.3 The media plane control channel
### 4.3.1 General
The media plane control channel is used for transport of messages associated
with the floor control protocol, the pre-established session call control
protocol and the MBMS bearer management protocol, all specified in the present
document.
### 4.3.2 Control channel realization
The media plane control channel is realized by sending RTCP APP packets on top
of UDP/IP. RTCP APP packets are defined in IETF RFC 3550 [3]. The MCPTT
specific coding of the RTCP APP packets is defined in clause 8 of the present
document.
### 4.3.3 Establishing a media plane control channel
#### 4.3.3.1 General
The MCPTT client and the MCPTT server use the SDP offer/answer mechanism in
order to negotiate the establishment of the media plane control channel. The
SDP offer/answer procedures for negotiating media plane control channel
capabilities are specified in clause 14. The ABNF is defined in clause 12.
The media description (\"m=\" line) associated with the media plane control
channel shall have the values as described in table 4.3.3.1-1.
Table 4.3.3.1-1: Media plane control channel media description
Media description element Value
* * *
\ \"application\" \ RTCP port \ \"udp\" \ \"MCPTT\"
The port used for RTCP messages associated with the media plane control
channel shall be different than ports used for RTCP messages associated with
other \"m=\" lines (e.g. RTP) in the SDP.
NOTE 1: As RTCP is used to transport messages on the media plane control
channel, the \"m=\" line port value indicates an RTCP port. This is different
from cases where an \"m=\" line is associated with an RTP-based stream, and
the \"m=\" line port value indicates an RTP port.
NOTE 2: In case the media plane control channel uses a different IP address
than other media described in the SDP, a media plane control channel specific
\"c=\" line also needs to be associated with the \"m=\" line associated with
the media plane control channel.
The format of the optional SDP fmtp attribute, when associated with the media
plane control channel, is described in clause 12.
The example below shows an SDP media description for a media plane control
channel.

## 6.2 Floor participant procedures
### 6.2.1 Floor participant procedures at MCPTT session initialization
Based on the negotiations during the call establishment specified in 3GPP TS
24.379 [2], a new instance of the \'Floor participant state transition diagram
for basic operation\', as specified in clause 6.2.4, shall be created for this
call.
The SIP INVITE request sent by the application and signalling plane:
1\. shall be regarded an implicit floor request when an implicit floor request
is negotiated; and
2\. shall not be regarded as an implicit floor request in case of a rejoin to
an already on-going group call.
NOTE: The floor participant can negotiate the use of prioritization of the
Floor Request message. In that case, the floor participant can request
permission to send media at a priority level that is either the same as or
lower than the highest priority that was permitted to the participant in the
MCPTT call initialization. If a floor participant is authorized for pre-
emptive priority in the MCPTT call it is good practise to always request
permission to send RTP media packets at a priority level that is lower than
pre-emptive priority unless the user explicitly requests to pre-empt the
current RTP media packets\' sender. In any case pre-emptive priority will have
no effect for audio cut-in floor control.
### 6.2.2 Floor participant procedures at MCPTT call release
The MCPTT call release (whether it is initiated by the floor participant or
floor control server) is a two-step procedure.
> Step 1 The floor participant stops sending floor control messages and the
> MCPTT client stops sending RTP media packets.
>
> Step 2 When the application and signalling plane has determined that the
> MCPTT call is released, the corresponding instance of the \'Floor
> participant state transition diagram for basic operation\' as specified in
> clause 6.2.4 is terminated and the floor participant releases all the used
> resources.
The user plane can initiate the release step 1, but the application and
signalling plane always initiates the release step 2.
### 6.2.3 Floor participant procedures at MCPTT call modification
Adding or removing media streams during an MCPTT call does not influence the
floor control procedures.
### 6.2.4 Floor participant state transition diagram for basic operation
#### 6.2.4.1 General
The floor participant shall behave according to the state diagram and the
state transitions specified in this clause.
Figure 6.2.4.1-1 shows the state diagram for \'Floor participant state
transition diagram for basic operation\'.
Figure 6.2.4.1-1: Floor participant state transition diagram for basic
operation.
State details are explained in the following clauses.
If an RTP media packet or a floor control message arrives in a state where
there is no specific procedure specified for the RTP media packets or the
received floor control message, the floor participant shall discard the floor
control message or the RTP media packet and shall remain in the current state.
NOTE 1: A badly formatted RTP packet or floor control message received in any
state is ignored by the floor participant and does not cause any change of the
current state.
NOTE 2: The state transition diagram is the same for groups configured for
audio cut-in floor control but the U: queued state should never be visited.
#### 6.2.4.2 State: \'Start-stop\'
##### 6.2.4.2.1 General
When a new instance of the \'Floor participant state transition diagram for
basic operation\' is initiated, before any floor control related input is
applied, the state machine is in \'Start-stop\' state. Similarly, when the
call is released the state machine shall return to the Start-Stop state.
##### 6.2.4.2.2 MCPTT call initiated, originating MCPTT user
When a call is initiated as described in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2], the floor
participant:
1\. shall create an instance of the \'Floor participant state transition
diagram for basic operation\';
2\. if the originating floor participant receives a floor control message
before it receives the SIP 200 (OK) response, shall store the floor control
message;
NOTE: The originating floor participant might receive a floor control message
before the SIP 200 (OK) response when initiating, joining or rejoining a call
because of processing delays of the SIP 200 (OK) response in the SIP core.
3\. if the established MCPTT call is a chat group call and the SIP INVITE
request is not an implicit floor request, shall enter the \'U: has no
permission\' state; and
4\. if for the established MCPTT call the SIP INVITE request is an implicit
floor request:
a. shall start timer T101 (Floor Request) and initialise counter C101 (Floor
Request) to 1;
b. shall enter the \'U: pending Request\' state; and
c. if the floor participant has received and stored a floor control message
before the reception of the SIP 200 (OK) response, shall act as if the floor
control message was received in the \'U: pending Request\' state after
entering the \'U: pending Request\' state.
When the floor participant is rejoining an ongoing MCPTT call as described in
3GPP TS 24.379 [2] the floor participant shall enter the \'U: has no
permission\' state.
##### 6.2.4.2.3 MCPTT call established, terminating MCPTT user
When an MCPTT call is established, the terminating floor participant:
1\. shall create an instance of a \'Floor participant state transition diagram
for basic operation\'; and
2\. shall enter the \'U: has no permission\' state.
NOTE: From a floor participant perspective the MCPTT call is established when
the application and signalling plane sends the SIP 200 (OK) response.
#### 6.2.4.3 State: \'U: has no permission\'
##### 6.2.4.3.1 General
The floor participant is in this state when the floor participant is not
sending RTP media packets or is not waiting for a floor control message
response.
In this state RTP media packets may be received and floor control messages can
be received.
##### 6.2.4.3.2 Receive Floor Idle message (R: Floor Idle)
Upon receiving a Floor Idle message, the participant:
1\. if the first bit in the subtype of the Floor Idle message is set to \'1\'
(Acknowledgment is required) as described in clause 8.2.2, shall send a Floor
Ack message. The Floor Ack message:
a. shall include the Message Type field set to \'5\' (Floor Idle); and
b. shall include the Source field set to \'0\' (the floor participant is the
source);
2\. may provide floor idle notification to the user, if it has not already
done so;
3\. shall stop the optional timer T103 (End of RTP media), if it is running;
and
4\. shall remain in the \'U: has no permission\' state.
##### 6.2.4.3.3 Receive Floor Taken message (R: Floor Taken)

## 6.3 Floor control server procedures
### 6.3.1 General
The floor control server arbitration logic in the floor control server shall
support the procedures in clauses 6.3.2 and 6.3.3 and shall behave according
to the floor control server state transition diagram for \'general floor
control operation\' in clause 6.3.4.
The floor control interface towards the MCPTT client in the floor control
server shall behave according to the floor control server state transition
diagram for \'basic floor control operation towards the floor participant\' as
specified in clause 6.3.5.
### 6.3.2 Controlling MCPTT function procedures at MCPTT call initialization
#### 6.3.2.1 General
The clause 6.3.2.2 describes the initial procedures when a new SIP session is
establishing a group session or a private session with floor control.
The clause 6.3.2.3 describes the procedures when a non-controlling MCPTT
function switches from the non-controlling mode to the controlling mode.
#### 6.3.2.2 Initial procedures
When an MCPTT call is established a new instance of the floor control server
state machine for \'general floor control operation\' is created.
For each MCPTT client added to the MCPTT call, a new instance of the floor
control server state machine for \'basic floor control operation towards the
floor participant\' is added.
If the optional \"mc_queueing\" feature is supported and has been negotiated
as specified in clause 14, the floor control server could queue the implicit
floor control request for the media-floor control entity.
The initial SIP INVITE request or SIP REFER request to establish an MCPTT chat
group call or to rejoin an ongoing MCPTT call is not handled as an implicit
floor control request message by the floor control server unless explicitly
stated in the SIP INVITE request or in the SIP REFER request.
The permission to send media to the inviting MCPTT client due to implicit
floor control request is applicable to both confirmed indication and
unconfirmed indication.
When the first unconfirmed indication is received from the invited
participating MCPTT function (see 3GPP TS 24.379 [2]) the floor control server
optionally can give an early indication to send RTP media packets, to the
inviting MCPTT client.
If an early indication to send RTP media packets is given to the inviting
MCPTT client, the floor participant is granted the permission to send media
and the MCPTT server buffers RTP media packets received from the MCPTT client
at least until the first invited MCPTT client accepts the invitation or until
the RTP media packet buffer maximum limit is exceeded.
If the MCPTT server does not support or does not allow media buffering then an
early indication to send RTP media packets is not given to the inviting MCPTT
client, the floor participant is granted the permission to send media when the
first invited MCPTT client accepts the media.
Before the floor control server sends the first floor control message in the
MCPTT call, the floor control server has to assign itself a SSRC identifier to
be included in media floor control messages and quality feedback messages if
the MCPTT server is supporting that option. A suitable algorithm to generate
the SSRC identifier is described in IETF RFC 3550 [3].
The floor participant and the floor control server can negotiate the maximum
priority level that the floor participant is permitted to request. The floor
control server can pre-empt the current sender based on the negotiated maximum
priority level that the floor participant is permitted to request and the
priority level included in the Floor Request message.
NOTE: The maximum priority level that a floor participant can use is
negotiated as specified in clause 14.3.3 and is based on group configuration
data retrieved by the controlling MCPTT function from the group management
server as described in 3GPP TS 24.481 [12] and service configuration data
retrieved by the controlling MCPTT function from the configuration management
server as described in 3GPP TS 24.484 [13].
For groups configured for audio cut-in floor control, pre-empting of the
current sender is not according to priority. Each new floor request results in
the floor being revoked from the current talker and being granted to the new
requesting talker.
The floor participant and the floor control server can negotiate queueing of
floor requests using the \"mc_queueing\" fmtp attribute as described in clause
14. If queueing is supported and negotiated, the floor control server queues
the floor control request if a Floor Request message is received when another
floor participant has the floor and the priority of the current speaker is the
same or higher. Queueing is not permitted for groups configured for audio cut-
in floor control.
#### 6.3.2.3 Switching from a non-controlling MCPTT function mode to a
controlling MCPTT function mode
When the MCPTT server switches from the non-controlling MCPTT function mode to
controlling MCPTT function mode a new instance of the floor control server
state machine for \'general floor control operation\' is created.
For each MCPTT client in the MCPTT call a new instance of the floor control
server state machine for \'basic floor control operation towards the floor
participant\' is added.
Any floor request in the passive floor request queue is moved to the active
floor request queue.
NOTE: The passive floor request queue is a floor request queue used by the
non-controlling MCPTT function as specified in clause 6.5.4 to monitor floor
request sent by floor participants controlled by the non-controlling MCPTT
function.
### 6.3.3 MCPTT floor control procedures at MCPTT call release
When an MCPTT client leaves an MCPTT call and the MCPTT call remains ongoing
with the other MCPTT clients, the floor control server follows a two-step
procedure.
> Step 1 The MCPTT server stops sending floor control messages and RTP media
> packets to the MCPTT client leaving the MCPTT call and, the MCPTT server
> discards floor control messages and RTP media packets received from the
> MCPTT client leaving the MCPTT call.
>
> Step 2 When the application and signalling plane has determined that the
> MCPTT call with this floor participant has been released, the corresponding
> instance of the floor control server state machine for \'basic floor control
> operation towards the floor participant\' is released.
When an MCPTT call is released, the floor control server follows a two-step
procedure.
> Step 1 The MCPTT server stops sending floor control messages and RTP media
> packets to all floor participants in the MCPTT call.
>
> Step 2 When the application and signalling plane has determined that the
> MCPTT call has been released, the corresponding instance of the floor
> control server state machine for \'general floor control operation\' are
> also terminated, along with any \'basic floor control operation towards the
> floor participant\' state machines for the floor participants of this call.
The floor control server state machine for general floor control operation
initiates the MCPTT call release depending on the release policy specified in
3GPP TS 24.379 [2].
### 6.3.4 Floor control server state transition diagram for general floor
control operation
#### 6.3.4.1 General
The floor control server arbitration logic in the floor control server shall
behave according to the state diagram and state transitions specified in this
clause.
Figure 6.3.4.1-1 shows the general floor control operation states (G states)
and the state transition diagram.
Figure 6.3.4.1-1: Floor control server state transition diagram for \'general
floor control operation\'
The floor control arbitration logic in the floor control server shall keep one
instance of the \'general floor control operation\' state machine per MCPTT
call.
If floor control messages or RTP media packets arrives in a state where there
is no procedure specified in the following clauses the floor control
arbitration logic in the floor control server:
1\. shall discard the floor control message;
2\. shall request the media distributor in the MCPTT server to discard any
received RTP media packet; and
3\. shall remain in the current state.
State details are explained in the following clauses.
#### 6.3.4.2 State: \'Start-stop\'
##### 6.3.4.2.1 General
When a new instance of the \'general floor control operation\' state machine
is initiated, before any floor control related input is applied, the state
machine is in \'Start-stop\' state. Similarly when the call is released the
state machine shall return to the \'Start-stop\' state or the related MCPTT
call is released.
##### 6.3.4.2.2 MCPTT call initialization
When an MCPTT call is initiated as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2] and
1\. if a confirmed indication is required and at least one invited MCPTT
client has accepted the invitation;
2\. if a confirmed indication is not required; or
3\. if the initialised MCPTT call is a temporary group session;
NOTE: A MCPTT group call is a temporary group session when the \ element is present in the \ element as specified in
3GPP TS 24.481 [12].
then the floor control arbitration logic in the floor control server:
1\. shall create an instance of the \'general floor control operation\' state
machine;
2\. shall wait for the \'basic floor control operation towards the floor
participant\' to be initialized before continuing the following steps;
3\. when the \'basic floor control operation towards the floor participant\'
state machine is initialized and the initialised session is not a temporary
group session:
a. if the \"mc_granted\" fmtp attribute is not negotiated as specified in
clause 14 or this is an ambient listening call:
i. if the floor control server is granting an implicit floor request at MCPTT
call establishment, shall act as if a Floor Request message was received and
perform the actions specified in clause 6.3.4.3.3; or
ii. if the floor control server is not granting an implicit floor request at
MCPTT call establishment, shall enter the\'G: Floor Idle\' state as specified
in clause 6.3.4.3.2; or
b. if the \"mc_granted\" fmtp attribute is negotiated as specified in clause
14 and this is not an ambient listening call, shall enter the \'G: Floor
Taken\' state as specified in clause 6.3.4.4.2; and
4\. if the \'basic floor control operation towards the floor participant\'
state machine is initialized and the initialised session is a temporary group
session, shall enter the \'G: Initialising\' state as specified in the clause
6.3.4.8.1.
#### 6.3.4.3 State: \'G: Floor Idle\'
##### 6.3.4.3.1 General
The floor control arbitration logic in the floor control server is in this
state when no MCPTT user currently has permission to send media.
Timer T4 (Inactivity) and timer T7 (Floor Idle) can be running when the floor
control arbitration logic in the floor control server is in this state.
##### 6.3.4.3.2 Enter the \'G: Floor Idle\' state
When entering this state from any state except the \'Start-stop\' state and if
no MCPTT client negotiated support of queueing floor requests as described in
clause 14, and the state machine specified in clause 6.3.6 does not exist, the
floor control arbitration logic in the floor control server:
1\. if there is a Track Info field associated with the floor control server
state transition diagram for \'general floor control operation\' stored, shall
remove the Track Info field from the storage;
2\. if the active floor request queue is empty the floor control server:
a. shall send Floor Idle message to all floor participants. The Floor Idle
message:
i. shall include a Message Sequence Number field with a Message Sequence

with Media Flow Control Indicator is set to \'1\', the floor control
arbitration logic in the floor control server:
1\. may allocate new bearer resources;
2\. shall notify the media distributor to start sending media to the MCPTT
client; and
3\. shall remain in the \'G: Floor Idle\' state.
#### 6.3.4.4 State: \'G: Floor Taken\'
##### 6.3.4.4.1 General
The floor control arbitration logic in the floor control server uses this
state when it has permitted one or more of the MCPTT clients in the MCPTT call
to send media.
Timer T1 (End of RTP media) is running when the floor control server is in
this state. If configured to support multi-talker floor control, one instance
of timer T1 (End of RTP media) is running per talker that is granted the
floor.
Timer T2 (End talking) can be running when the floor control server is in this
state. If configured to support multi-talker floor control, one instance of
timer T20 (Floor Granted) is running per talker that is granted the floor.
Timer T20 (Floor Granted) is running to guarantee reliable delivery of the
Floor Granted message, if the granted floor request was queued. If configured
to support multi-talker floor control, one instance of timer T20 (Floor
Granted) is running per talker that is granted the floor.
If configured to support multi-talker, then the floor control arbitration
logic maintains a list of MCPTT IDs of the currently granted talkers.

### 6.3.5 Floor control server state transition diagram for basic floor
control operation towards the floor participant
#### 6.3.5.1 General
The floor control interface towards the MCPTT client in the floor control
server shall behave according to the state diagram and state transitions
specified in this clause.
Figure 6.3.5.1-1 shows the states and state transitions for an associated
floor participant in the floor control server.
{width="5.704861111111111in" height="9.910416666666666in"}
Figure 6.3.5.1-1: Floor control server state transition diagram for basic
floor control operation towards the floor participant
The floor control interface towards the MCPTT client in the floor control
server shall create one instance of the \'basic floor control operations\'
state machine towards the MCPTT client for every floor participant served by
the floor control server as follows:
1\. For pre-arranged group call in case of an originating MCPTT call, the
\'basic floor control operation towards the floor participant\' state machine
shall be created when the MCPTT server sends the SIP 200 (OK) response towards
the originating MCPTT client.
2\. For pre-arranged group call in case of a terminating MCPTT call, the
\'basic floor control operation towards the floor participant\' state machine
shall be created when the floor control server receives the SIP 200 (OK)
response.
3\. For chat group call the \'basic floor control operation state machine
towards the floor participant\' shall be created when the MCPTT server sends
the SIP 200 (OK) response to the received initial SIP INVITE request.
The floor participant associated to the \'basic floor control operation
towards the floor participant\' state machine is here referred to as the
\"associated floor participant\".
The external inputs to the state machine are:
1\. directives coming from the floor control arbitration logic;
2\. floor control messages sent by the floor participants;
3\. media; and
4\. in certain cases, SIP messages used for call handling.
If floor control messages or RTP media packets arrives in a state where there
is no procedure specified in the following clauses, the floor control
interface towards the MCPTT client in the floor control server:
1\. shall discard the floor control message;
2\. shall request the network media interface in the MCPTT server to discard
any received RTP media packet; and
3\. shall remain in the current state.
State details are explained in the following clauses.
#### 6.3.5.2 State: \'Start-stop\'
##### 6.3.5.2.1 General
When a new instance of the \'basic floor control operations towards the floor
participant\' state machine is created, before any floor control related input
is applied, the state machine is in the \'Start-stop\' state. Similarly, when
the call is released the state machine shall return to the Start-Stop state.
An association between the floor control server and a floor participant in the
MCPTT client is created, when the state machine is created; and
1\. in case of an originating MCPTT call, when the MCPTT server sends the SIP
200 (OK) response to the originating MCPTT client; and
2\. in case of a terminating MCPTT call, when the floor control server
receives the SIP 200 (OK) response sent from the terminating MCPTT client.
##### 6.3.5.2.2 SIP Session initiated

operation\' state machine.
b. shall enter the state \'U: permitted\' as specified in the clause
6.3.5.5.2;
2\. if the associated MCPTT client rejoins an ongoing MCPTT call without an
implicit floor request or initiates or joins a chat group call without an
implicit floor request or attempts to initiate an already existing MCPTT call
without an implicit floor request, and
a. if an MCPTT call already exists but no MCPTT client has the permission to
send a media, the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client in the
floor control server:
i. should send a Floor Idle message to the MCPTT client. The Floor Idle
message:

clause 14.
NOTE 5: The initial implicit floor request will not result in pre-emption when
an MCPTT client is joining an ongoing MCPTT call. If the MCPTT client wants to
pre-empt the current MCPTT client that is sending media, an explicit floor
request with pre-emptive floor priority is required.
ii. shall insert the MCPTT client into the active floor request queue to the

The floor control arbitration logic in the floor control server shall keep one
instance of the \'dual floor control operation\' state machine for a floor
participant with pre-emptive floor priority where this MCPTT user is allowed
to talk without revoking a current speaker with lower flow priority.
NOTE: Only one MCPTT user with this type of pre-emptive floor priority can
exist within an MCPTT call.
The floor participant associated to the \'dual floor control operation\' state
machine is in the following clauses referred to as the overriding MCPTT
client.

controlling MCPTT function mode
##### 6.5.2.3.1 Overview
The switching from working in a controlling MCPTT functional mode to a non-
controlling MCPTT functional mode is a 2-step procedure.
> Step 1 The controlling MCPTT function prepares for acting as a non-
> controlling MCPTT function. The step 1 procedure is specified in clause
> 6.5.2.3.2.\ \ Before continuing with step 2 the application and signalling
> plane needs to receive a confirmation that the SIP session between the floor
> control server and the interface to the floor control server is established.
>
> Step 2 The controlling MCPTT functions starts acting as a non-controlling
> MCPTT function. The step 2 procedure is specified in clause 6.5.2.3.3.
##### 6.5.2.3.2 Preparing for the switch to non-controlling MCPTT function
(Step 1)
When receiving a request from the application and signalling plane to prepare
for merging with another group session, the floor control server:
1\. if in the \'G: taken\' state, shall provide information about current
speaker to the signalling and application plane;
NOTE: The signalling and application plane will use the information about the
current speaker to send a floor request in an SIP MESSAGE request as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.379.
2\. shall release the instant used for \'general floor control operation\';
and
3\. shall for each MCPTT client in the MCPTT group controlled by the
controlling MCPTT function and participating in the session:
a. generate a random temporary identifier between \'0\' and \'4294967295\';
b. store an association between the generated temporary identifier and the
floor participant interface;
c. store information about capabilities negotiated in the \"mc_queueing\" and
\"mc_priority\" fmtp attributes as specified in clause 14;
d. store information whether the MCPTT client requested privacy or not; and
e. initiate an instance of the \'floor participant interface state
transition\' state machine as specified in clause 6.3.5.8.3.
##### 6.5.2.3.3 Start acting as a non-controlling MCPTT function (Step 2)
When receiving a request from the application and signalling plane to finalize
the switch to non-controlling MCPTT function behaviour, the floor control
server:
1\. shall start acting as a floor control server interface;
2\. if an active floor request queue exists, for each queued floor request in
the active floor request queue:
NOTE: The active floor request queue was built up when the non-controlling
MCPTT function was acting as a floor control server.
a. shall send a Floor Request message to the floor control server. The Floor
Request:
i. shall include all fields included by the floor participant;
ii. if a Track Info field is included, shall include the temporary identifier
at the end of the \ value item; and
iii. if a Track Info field is not included, shall include a Track Info field
populated as follows:
A. shall include the \"mc_queueing\" fmtp attribute value negotiated as
specified in clause 14 in the \ value;
B. shall include a \ value based on the \
element specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [12], if value in the \
element is available, otherwise set the \ value to
\"unknown\"; and
C. shall include the temporary identifier as the first \ value;
3\. if an active floor request queue exists, shall move the active floor
request queue to a passive floor request queue; and
4\. shall perform the actions in the clause 6.5.4.
When receiving an indication from the application and signalling plane that an
MCPTT client has joined the session, the floor participant interface shall
perform the actions in clause 6.5.5.
### 6.5.3 The MCPTT call release procedure in the non-controlling MCPTT
function of an MCPTT group
When an MCPTT client leaves an MCPTT call and the MCPTT call remains ongoing
with the other MCPTT clients, the non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT
group follows a two-step procedure:
> Step 1 The floor participant interface stops sending floor control messages
> and RTP media packets to the MCPTT client leaving the MCPTT call and the
> floor participant interface discards floor control messages and RTP media
> packets received from the MCPTT client leaving the MCPTT call; and
>
> Step 2 When the application and signalling plane has determined that the
> session with this floor participant has been released, the corresponding
> instance of the \'floor participant interface state transition\' state
> machine is released.
When an MCPTT call is released, the floor control server interface follows a
two-step procedure:
> Step 1 The floor control server interface stops sending floor control
> messages and RTP media packets to MCPTT clients in the MCPTT call; and
>
> Step 2 When the application and signalling plane has determined that the
> MCPTT call has been released, resources in the floor control server
> interface are released, along with all \'floor participant interface state
> transition\' state machines.
The non-controlling MCPTT function of an MCPTT group can initiate an MCPTT
call release depending on the release policy specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2].
### 6.5.4 Floor control server interface procedures
#### 6.5.4.1 General
The floor control server interface is stateless with regards to the floor
control message received and sent.
The following clauses specifies what the floor control server interface shall

# 7 Off-network floor control
## 7.1 General
A floor control session may be initiated only if there is a successfully
established off-network call.
In off-network, floor control is performed using floor control messages among
the MCPTT clients without a centralized floor arbitrator. When off-network, if
a floor control session is active, the floor arbitrator and the floor
participant are co-located in the MCPTT client (see 3GPP TS 23.379 [5]).
During a floor control session the MCPTT client currently speaking serves as
the temporary floor arbitrator. All other MCPTT clients in the call play the
role of floor participant. When the floor arbitrator grants the floor to
another MCPTT client, that new MCPTT client, when starts to send media,
becomes the new floor arbitrator and the former (the MCPTT client which
granted the floor) becomes a floor participant.
The procedures in clause 7.2 are from the perspective of a single MCPTT
client. No special message other than floor control messages and media is used
for coordinating the floor arbitrator and floor participant status of the
separate MCPTT clients participating in the off-network call.
The floor control messages are always sent to all the participants of the
call. Therefore they can be monitored by any MCPTT client listening to the
call.
In a floor control session queueing of floor requests may be supported.
It is assumed that the MCPTT user presses the PTT button for requesting talk
permission and keeps it pressed until the request is resolved. If queueing of
floor requests is not supported, this request is either granted or rejected or
no answer is received. If the request is granted the user is notified with
talk permission tone (or equivalent) and the user continues to press the PTT
until the user finishes the talk burst. If the request is rejected or no
answer is received the user is notified and releases the PTT button.
If queueing of floor requests is supported, the MCPTT user shall be notified
when a floor request is queued and the MCPTT user shall release the PTT
button. When, after queueing, the floor is granted to this user the MCPTT user
shall be informed that the queued request is now granted. Then the MCPTT user
should press the PTT button within a short duration. Otherwise, the grant is
taken from this MCPTT user. An MCPTT user can appear in a queue only once. The
floor request queue is transferred from the former to the new floor
arbitrator.
After the initiation of a floor control session the MCPTT client behaves
according to the state machine presented in clause 7.2.3. The state machine is
designed such that in normal cases only one of the MCPTT clients, which
participates in the call, acts as floor arbitrator and all others act as floor
participants. However, there may be situations such that more than one MCPTT
client are at an internal state causing them to act as floor arbitrator. A
short sequence of floor control messages and RTP media packets are initiated
to resolve these situations.
## 7.2 Floor participant procedures
### 7.2.1 Floor participant procedures at MCPTT session initialization
This clause applies when no active floor control session exists.
Before a floor control entity is initiated a state machine with a single
state, named as \'Start-stop\' state, shall exist. At \'Start-stop\' state,
when the MCPTT client receives a request of the MCPTT call control entity to
initiate the floor control as originating client, then the MCPTT client shall
initiate a floor control entity and the floor control entity shall enter into
the \'O: has permission\' state. Otherwise, if MCPTT client receives a request
of the MCPTT call control entity to initiate the floor control as terminating
client, then the MCPTT client shall initiate a floor control entity and the
floor control entity for an MCPTT group call shall enter into the \'O:
silence\' state or for both MCPTT private call and MCPTT broadcast group call
shall enter the \'O: has no permission\' state.
Once the session is initiated, the initial floor control messages are sent
according to the state machine presented in clause 7.2.3. Normally, once the
session is started the originating MCPTT client has the floor implicitly. For
an on-going off-network group call, if an MCPTT client joins later, then it
starts the floor control session and takes the role of floor participant and
enters \'O: silence\' state.
#### 7.2.1.2 Determine off-network floor priority
Upon receiving a Floor Request message, to determine the floor priority of the
Floor Request message, the floor arbitrator:
1\. shall check the presence of Floor Priority field in the received Floor
Request message. If present, the floor arbitrator:
a. shall determine the floor priority of the Floor Request message by choosing
the lowest value from the following inputs:
i. the value of the Floor Priority field in the received Floor Request
message;
ii. the value of the \"/_\
_/\/Common/MCPTTGroupMemberList/\/UserPriority\" leaf node of the
sender of the Floor Request message, present in group configuration as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4]; and
iii. the value of the \"/\/OffNetwork/NumLevelHierarchy\" leaf node present
in service configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4]; and
2\. if the Floor Priority field is not present in the Floor Request message,
the floor arbitrator:
a. shall use the minimum value allowed for the Floor Priority as floor
priority of the Floor Request message.
Once the floor priority of the Floor Request message is determined, to
determine the effective priority of the Floor Request message, the floor
arbitrator:
1\. shall check the type of call indicated by the Floor Indicator field of the
received Floor Request message and:
a. if the type of call indicated by the Floor Indicator field is Normal call:
i. if the current type of the call is normal, shall continue to check the next
input parameter from step 2; and
ii if the current type of the call is emergency or imminent-peril and:
A. if the value of \"/\/\/OffNetwork/QueueUsage\" leaf node present in
the group configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4] is set to \"true\",
shall queue the floor request;
B. if the value of \"/\/\/OffNetwork/QueueUsage\" leaf node present in
the group configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4] is set to
\"false\", shall deny the floor request; and
C. shall skip step 2;
b. if the type of call indicated by the Floor Indicator field is Imminent
peril call and:
i. if the current type of the call is normal, shall pre-empt the current
talker, grant the floor request and skip step 2;
ii. if the current type of the call is imminent-peril, shall continue to check
the next input parameter from step 2; and
iii. if the current type of the call is emergency and:
A. if the value of \"/\/\/OffNetwork/QueueUsage\" leaf node present in
the group configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4] is set to \"true\",
shall queue the floor request;
B. if the value of \"/\/\/OffNetwork/QueueUsage\" leaf node present in
the group configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4] is set to
\"false\", shall deny the floor request; and
C. shall skip step 2; and
c. if the type of the call indicated by the Floor Indicator field is Emergency
call and:
i. if the current type of the call is normal or imminent-peril, shall pre-empt
the current talker and grant the floor request; and
ii. if the current type of the call is emergency and:
A. if the value of \"/\/\/OffNetwork/QueueUsage\" leaf node present in
the group configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4] is set to \"true\",
shall queue the floor request;
B. if the value of \"/\/\/OffNetwork/QueueUsage\" leaf node present in
the group configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4] is set to
\"false\", shall deny the floor request; and
iii shall skip step 2; and
2\. shall compare the determined floor priority of the received Floor Request
message to the effective priority of the current talker (determined at the
time of floor grant to the current talker) and:
a. if the effective priority of the current talker is equal to or higher than
the determined floor priority of the Floor Request message and:
i. if the value of \"/\/\/OffNetwork/QueueUsage\" leaf node present in
the group configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4] is set to \"true\",
shall queue the floor request; and
ii. if the value of \"/\/\/OffNetwork/QueueUsage\" leaf node present in
the group configuration as specified in 3GPP TS 24.483 [4] is set to
\"false\", shall deny the floor request; and
b. if the determined floor priority of the Floor Request message is higher
than that of the current talker, shall pre-empt the current talker and shall
grant the floor request.
### 7.2.2 Floor participant procedures at MCPTT call release
This clause applies when an active floor control session exists.
When the off-network call is released the floor control session is terminated.
The off-network floor control session can also be terminated when no media
transmission or reception takes place during floor control session hold time,
T230 (Inactivity). The termination of the floor control session as a result of
the expiry of timer T230 (Inactivity) may terminate the call session.
### 7.2.3 Floor participant state diagram -- basic operation
#### 7.2.3.1 General
The floor participant shall behave according to the state diagram and the
transitions specified in this clause.
The received floor messages and the RTP media packets are inputs to the state
machine according to their arrival order. They are not ignored unless
otherwise stated.
The MCPTT client also provides input to the state machine as request to talk
(press PTT button) or as end of talk (release PTT button).
Figure 7.2.3.1-1 show the \'Floor participant state diagram -- basic
operation\'.

there is no specific procedure specified for the RTP media packet or the
received floor control message, the floor participant shall discard the floor
control message or the RTP media packet and shall remain in the current state.
NOTE: A badly formatted RTP packet or floor control message received in any

# 8 Coding
## 8.1 Introduction
### 8.1.1 General
The media plane control protocols specified in the present document are based
on the RTCP Application Packets (RTCP: APP), as defined in IETF RFC 3550 [3],
but the media plane control messages do not conform to the rules for compound
RTCP packets or RTCP packet transmission.
Each media plane control message is one RTCP: APP packet. These RTCP: APP
packets are not to be sent in compound RTCP packets, but more than one media
plane control message can be sent in a single IP packet.
The three first 32-bit words in any of the media plane control protocols
defined in the present document are structured commonly as described in clause
8.1.2.
Outside tables, binary values are expressed with a decimal value with single
quotation marks e.g. 00000000 is \'0\', 00000001 is \'1\', 00000010 is \'2\'
and so on.
### 8.1.2 RTCP: APP message format
The definition of the fields in the RTCP APP packet is found in IETF RFC 3550
[3].
Table 8.1.2-1 shows the RTCP APP packet format.
Table 8.1.2-1: RTCP: APP message format

+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
**[P]{.underline}**
The padding bit P is set to \'0\'.
**[Subtype:]{.underline}**
Dependent upon the relevant set of media plane control messages, as identified
by the Name field, the possible Subtype values are defined in the following
tables:
\- Name field = \"MCPT\" (i.e. Floor control): Table 8.2.2.1-1
\- Name field = \"MCPC\" (i.e. Pre-established session call control): Table
8.3.2-1
\- Name field= \"MCMC\" (i.e. MBMS subchannel control): Table 8.4.2-1
\- Name field= \"MCNC\" (i.e. Notification control): Table 8.5.2-1
**[Length]{.underline}**
The length field in the RTCP header is the length of the packet in 32-bit
words, not counting the first 32-bit word in which the length field resides.
NOTE: The length field can indicate message size longer than specified in this
version of the protocol. This can be the case e.g. if message is of later
version of this protocol.
**[SSRC]{.underline}**
The content of this field is described for each floor control message
separately.
**[Name]{.underline}**
The 4-byte ASCII string in the RTCP header is used to define the set of media
plane control messages to be unique with respect to other APP packets that the
media plane might receive.
The present document specified the use of the following names:
1\. For the floor control protocol specified in the present document the ASCII
name string is: MCPT (Mission Critical Push-to-Talk).
2\. For the pre-established session call control protocol specified in the
present document the ASCII name string is: MCPC (Mission Critical Pre-
established Session Control).
3\. For the MBMS subchannel control protocol specified in the present document
the ASCII name string is: MCMC (Mission Critical MBMS subchannel Control).
**[Application-dependent data]{.underline}**
The application-dependent data contains zero or more application specific data
fields is specified in clause 8.1.3.
This part is encrypted if SRTCP is used.
**[Secure RTCP message part]{.underline}**
The content of the secure RTCP message part is in specified in clause 13 and
in IETF RFC 3711 [16].
### 8.1.3 Application specific data field
Each application specific data field is composed of:
1\. a field ID which is one octet long;
2\. a length value which is:
\- one octet long, if the field ID is less than 192; and
\- two octets long, if the field ID is equal to or greater than 192;
3\. a field value. The length in octets of the field value is indicated in the
length value; and
4\. a padding. The padding is zero, one, two, or three octets long. The value
of the padding octet(s) is set to zero by sender and ignored by receiver.
An application specific data field has always a multiple of 4 octets.
Table 8.1.3-1 shows the application dependent data field structure when the
field ID is less than 192. Table 8.1.3-2 shows the application dependent data
field structure when the field ID is equal to or greater than 192.

### 8.1.4 Handling of unknown messages and fields
When an RTCP APP message is received, the receiver shall:
1\. ignore the whole message, if the subtype is unknown;
2\. ignore the unspecified fields in the message (e.g. specified in future
version of the protocol); and
3\. ignore the syntactically incorrect optional fields.
## 8.2 Floor control
### 8.2.1 Introduction
The floor control messages are coded as described in clause 8.1.2 where the
floor control message is part of the application-dependent data.
For the floor control protocol the ASCII name string is: MCPT (Mission
Critical Push-to-Talk).
A list of floor control messages can be found in clause 8.2.2.1.
The same floor control messages are used for on-network, off-network floor
control and over the MBMS subchannel control channel.
In case of off-network, the floor participant that has the floor acts as the
floor control server (referred to as floor arbitrator in clause 7) in the
following clauses.
The floor control specific fields are specified in clause 8.2.3.
### 8.2.2 Floor control messages
#### 8.2.2.1 General
The table 8.2.2.1-1 provides a list of floor control messages.
Table 8.2.2.1-1: Floor control specific messages

For some messages the first bit (marked as x in the subtype) can be used to
indicate if the sender wants to have an acknowledgment. The x is coded as
follows:
\'0\' Acknowledgment is not required
\'1\' Acknowledgment is required
NOTE: Whether a message needs to be acknowledged or not is described in
clauses 6.
If an acknowledgment is required the Floor Ack message is used to acknowledge
the message.

The following clauses describe the coding of each field.
#### 8.2.3.2 Floor Priority field
The Floor Priority field describes the level of priority requested in a Floor
Request message or granted in a Floor Granted message. The max floor priority
that can be requested in a Floor Request message is negotiated between the
MCPTT client and the controlling MCPTT function using the \"mc_priority\" fmtp
parameter as specified in clause 14.
Table 8.2.3.2-1 describes the coding of the Floor Priority field.
Table 8.2.3.2-1: Floor Priority field coding

\|Floor Priority \|Floor Priority \|Floor Priority \|spare \|
\|field ID value \|Length value \|value \| \|
+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+-+
The \ value is a binary value and is set according to
table 8.2.3.1-2.
The \ value is a binary value and has the value \'2\'
indicating the total length in octets of the \ value item and
the spare bits.
The \ value consists of 8 bit parameter giving the floor
priority (\'0\' to \'255\') where \'0\' is the lowest priority and \'255\' is
the highest priority. If the Floor Priority field is not included in the
message the default priority is used as the Floor Priority value. The value of
the default priority is \'0\'. The default priority is sometimes referred to
as normal priority. Whether a floor priority is pre-emptive or not is
determined:
1\. for on-network by the floor control server as described in clause 4.1.1.4;
and
2\. for off-network by the floor arbitrator as described in clause 4.1.1.5.
The spare bits are set to zero.
#### 8.2.3.3 Duration field
The Duration field describes the time in seconds for which the granted party
is allowed to transmit.

# 9 Call setup control over pre-established session
## 9.1 General
The procedures described in this clause are applicable only after a pre-
established session is established between the participating MCPTT function
and the MCPTT client.
Once the use of an existing pre-established session is decided for a pre-
arranged group call or for a chat group call or for a private call, as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2], the participating MCPTT function shall inform
the MCPTT client that this pre-established session is to be used as described
in clause 9.3 and the MCPTT client shall respond as described in clause 9.2.
When a pre-arranged group call or a chat group call or a private call which
uses a pre-established session is released as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2],
the participating MCPTT function shall inform the MCPTT client that the use of
this pre-established session has ended as described in clause 9.3 and the
MCPTT client shall respond as described in clause 9.2.
Media and media plane control procedures between a participating MCPTT
function and MCPTT client for a pre-arranged group call or for a chat group
call or for a private call and setup over a pre-established session are not
affected by the use of the pre-established session.
Media plane security procedures for pre-established call control messages are
specified in clause 13.
## 9.2 MCPTT client
### 9.2.1 General
If the MCPTT client supports pre-established session, the MCPTT client shall
also support the behaviour implied by the state machine specified in this
clause. The specifications are on the reception or sending of media plane
control messages related to the call setup control over pre-established
session
An MCPTT client may have several pre-established sessions at a time.
### 9.2.2 Call setup control over pre-established session state machine
#### 9.2.2.1 General
A call setup control over pre-established state machine has two states: Pre-
established Session_Not_in_use and Pre-established Session_In_use. In addition
the \'Start-Stop\' state is specified for the initiation or the termination of
the state machine. The state transitions are partly controlled by the call
control procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2].
Figure 9.2.2.1-1 shows the call setup control over pre-established session
state machine and the state transitions.
Figure 9.2.2.1-1: Call setup control over pre-established session state
machine.
The MCPTT client shall create one instance of the call setup control over pre-
established state machine per pre-established session.
If a pre-established session call control message, a SIP request or RTP media
packet arrives in any state and there is no procedure specified in the clauses
below, the MCPTT client shall discard the pre-established session call control
message, SIP request or RTP media packet and shall remain in the current
state.
#### 9.2.2.2 State: \'Start-stop\'
##### 9.2.2.2.1 General
In this state no pre-established session exists
##### 9.2.2.2.2 Pre-established session started

participating MCPTT function, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2], the MCPTT
client:
1\. shall initialize any needed user plane resources for the pre-established
session as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2]; and
2\. shall enter the \'U: Pre-established session not in use\' state.
#### 9.2.2.3 State: \'U: Pre-established session not in use\'
##### 9.2.2.3.1 General
The \'U: Pre-established session not in use\' state is a stable state. The
MCPTT client is in this state when a pre-established session is established,
but it is not used for a call.
In this state the MCPTT client can receive call initiation message and floor
control messages.
##### 9.2.2.3.2 Receive Connect message (R: Connect)
Upon reception of a Connect message:
1\. if the MCPTT client accepts the incoming call the MCPTT client:
a. shall send the Acknowledge message with Reason Code field set to
\'Accepted\';
b. shall use only the media streams of the pre-established session which are
indicated as used in the associated call session Media Streams field, if the
Connect contains a Media Streams field;
c. shall create an instance of the \'Floor participant state transition
diagram for basic operation\' as specified in clause 6.2.4; and
d. shall enter the \'U: Pre-established session in use\' state; or
2\. Otherwise the MCPTT client:
a. shall send the Acknowledge message with the Reason Code field set to an
appropriate \ value; and
b. shall remain in \'U: Pre-established session not in use\' state.
##### 9.2.2.3.3 Pre-established session stopped
When the associated pre-established session between the MCPTT client and the
MCPTT server is released the MCPTT client:
1\. shall release any user plane resources including any running timers
associated with the pre-established session; and
2\. shall enter the \'Start-stop\' state and then the \'Call setup control
over pre-established session state machine\' is released.
##### 9.2.2.3.4 Receive Disconnect message (R: Disconnect)
Upon reception of a Disconnect message the MCPTT client:
1\. if the first bit in the subtype of the Disconnect message is set to \'1\'
(Acknowledgment is required), shall send the Acknowledge message with the
Reason Code set to \'Accepted\'; and
2\. shall remain in \'U: Pre-established session not in use\' state.
##### 9.2.2.3.5 Receive SIP 2xx response (R:2xx response)
Upon reception of a SIP 2xx response for the SIP REFER request sent to
initiate an MCPTT call session over a pre-established session as specified in
3GPP TS 24.379 [2], (to initiates a pre-arranged group call or private call or
to join a chat group call) the MCPTT client:
1\. shall create an instance of the \'Floor participant state transition
diagram for basic operation\' as specified in subclause 6.2.4; and
2\. shall enter the \'U: Pre-established session in use\' state.
##### 9.2.2.3.6 Receive SIP re-INVITE request (R: re-INVITE)
Upon sending the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP re-INVITE request for the
use of the Pre-established session initiating an MCPTT call session as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2] the MCPTT client:
1\. shall create an instance of the \'Floor participant state transition
diagram for basic operation\' as specified in subclause 6.2.4; and
2\. shall enter the \'U: Pre-established session in use\' state.

## 9.3 Participating MCPTT function
### 9.3.1 General
The participating MCPTT function shall support the behaviour implied by the
state machine specified in this clause. The specifications are on the sending
and reception of media plane control messages related to the call setup
control over a pre-established session
A participating MCPTT function may have several pre-established session at a
time for multiple MCPTT clients and multiple pre-established sessions per
MCPTT client.
### 9.3.2 Call setup control over pre-established session state machine for
the participating MCPTT function
#### 9.3.2.1 General
If the participating MCPTT function supports pre-established session, the
participating MCPTT function shall behave according to the \'pre-established
session state machine\' and state transitions specified in this clause.
The \'pre-established session state machine\' has three states: \'G: Pre-
established session not in use\' state, \'G: Pre-established session in use\'
state and \'G: Call releasing\' state, the state transitions are partially
controlled by the specifications in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2]. The \'Start-stop\'
state is the initial and final state.
Figure 9.3.2.1-1 shows the state diagram and the state transitions of the
\'pre-established session state machine\'.
Figure 9.3.2.1-1: State transitions of Pre-established Session state machine
The participating MCPTT function shall create one instance of the \'pre-
established session state machine\' per pre-established session per MCPTT
client.
State and state transition details are explained in the following clauses.
If a pre-established session call control message, SIP request, SIP response
or RTP media packet arrives in any state and there is no procedure specified
for it in this clauses below, the participating MCPTT function shall discard
the pre-established session call control message, SIP request, SIP response or
RTP media packet and remain in the current state.

# 10 MBMS subchannel control procedure
## 10.1 General
A participating MCPTT function sending floor control messages and RTP media
packets over a MBMS bearer shall support the procedures in the following
clauses.
The MBMS bearer can be used for conversations in group calls. Prior to using
the MBMS bearer the participating MCPTT function needs to activate the MBMS
bearer and announce the MBMS bearer as described in clause 4.1.3.
Floor control messages and RTP media packets received over the MBMS subchannel
are used as input to the floor participant state machine in the same way as
floor control messages and RTP media packets received over the unicast bearer.
Media plane security procedures for media and floor control messages sent over
the MBMS subchannels are specified in clause 13.
The participating MCPTT function can apply Robust header compression (ROHC)
(see RFC 5795 [20]) before pushing packets to the BM-SC with MB2-U, or can
request the BM-SC to apply ROHC, as described in 3GPP TS 29.468 [6].
## 10.2 MBMS subchannel control procedure for the participating MCPTT function
### 10.2.1 General
If the participating MCPTT function supports the MBMS subchannel control
procedure, the participating MCPTT function shall support the behaviour
implied by the state machine specified in this clause. The specifications are
on the reception of floor control messages from the controlling MCPTT
function, sending of floor control messages and the allocation/deallocation of
a MBMS subchannel for a conversation in a group session.
Figure 10.2.1-1 shows the participating MCPTT function MBMS subchannel control
state diagram.
Figure 10.2.1-1: Participating MCPTT function MBMS subchannel control state
diagram
If a floor control message or RTP media packet arrives in a state where there
are no procedures specified in the clauses below, the participating MCPTT
function shall discard the message.
### 10.2.2 State: \'Start-stop\'
#### 10.2.2.1 General
In this state:
\- no instance of the \'Participating MCPTT function MBMS subchannel control
state machine exists;
\- a pre-activated MBMS bearer may exist;
\- no conversation using a MBMS subchannel control is active but a group
session exists where a conversation over the unicast channel may be ongoing;
and
\- the participating MCPTT function handles floor control messages and RTP
media packets as for during normal operations described in clause 6.4.
#### 10.2.2.2 Send Map Group To Bearer message (R: Floor Request or Floor
Taken)
Upon receiving a Floor Request message or a Floor Taken message and when the
participating MCPTT function decides that an MBMS subchannel shall be used for
a conversation in an ongoing group session, the participating MCPTT function
needs to determine if the MBMS bearer has sufficient capacity for the new
conversation. If the new MBMS bearer has sufficient capacity the participating
MCPTT function:
NOTE: The participating MCPTT function can take that decision when receiving
the first Floor Request from a floor participant or when receiving a Floor
Taken message destined to one of the floor participants served by the
participating MCPTT client.
1\. shall create an instance of the \'Participating MCPTT function MBMS
subchannel control\' state machine;

clause 10.2.3.3.
If the MBMS bearer does not have sufficient capacity for the new conversation
the participating MCPTT function:
1\. may free capacity for the new conversation by transfering an existing
conversation over an MBMS bearer to unicast bearers following the procedure in
clause 10.2.3.12; or
2\. may use the MBMS bearer for the signaling messages, while using unicast
bearers for the media message.
### 10.2.3 State: \'M: A conversation is active\'
#### 10.2.3.1 General
In this state a MBMS subchannel exists and can be used by a group call.

#### 10.2.3.6 Timer T15 (Conversation) expired
Upon expiry of timer T15 (Conversation), the participating MCPTT function
shall:
1\. if the application indicates that there is no longer an MCPTT client
listening to the MBMS bearer,
a. shall release the instance of the \'Participating MCPTT function MBMS
subchannel management\' state machine used for the conversation; and
b. shall enter the \'Start-stop\' state; and
2\. if the application indicates that there are MCPTT client still listening
to the MBMS bearer:
a. shall send the Unmap Group To Bearer message over the MBMS subchannel. The
Unmap Group To Bearer message:
i. shall include the MCPTT Group ID field;
b. shall start timer T17 (Unmap Group To Bearer) and initialise counter C17
(Unmap Group To Bearer) to 1; and
c. shall remain in the \'M: A conversation is active\' state.
#### 10.2.3.7 Timer T16 (Map Group To Bearer) expired
Upon expiry of timer T16 (Map Group To Bearer), the participating MCPTT
function:
1\. shall send a Map Group To Bearer message over the general purpose MBMS
subchannel. The Map Group To Bearer message:
a. shall include a TMGI field;
b. shall include a MBMS Subchannel field; and
c shall include the MCPTT Group identifier field;
2\. shall restart timer T16 (Map Group To Bearer); and
3\. shall remain in the \'M: A conversation is active\' state.
#### 10.2.3.8 Timer T17 (Unmap Group To Bearer) expired
Upon expiry of timer T17 (Unmap Group To Bearer) less than the upper limit of
counter C17 (Unmap Group To Bearer) times, the participating MCPTT function:
1\. shall send the Unmap Group To Bearer message over the MBMS subchannel. The
Unmap Group To Bearer message:
a. shall include the MCPTT Group ID field; and
2\. shall restart the timer T17 (Map Group To Bearer re-transmit) and
increment counter C17 (Unmap Group To Bearer) by 1.
#### 10.2.3.9 Timer T17 (Unmap Group To Bearer) expired Nth time
Upon expiry of timer T17 (Unmap Group To Bearer) by the upper limit of counter
C17 (Unmap Group To Bearer), the participating MCPTT function:
1\. shall send the Unmap Group To Bearer message over the MBMS subchannel. The
Unmap Group To Bearer message:
a. shall include the MCPTT Group ID field; and
2\. shall release the instance of the \'Participating MCPTT function MBMS
subchannel management\' state machine used for the conversation.
#### 10.2.3.10 End conversation over the MBMS bearer (End conversation)
Upon receiving an indication from the application and signalling plane that
all MCPTT clients now listens to the unicast channel, the participating MCPTT
function:
1\. shall release the instance of the \'Participating MCPTT function MBMS
subchannel management\' state machine used for the conversation.
#### 10.2.3.11 Group call released
If the control and signalling plane indicates that the group call session is
released, the participating MCPTT function:
1\. shall send the Unmap Group To Bearer message over the MBMS subchannel. The
Unmap Group To Bearer message:
a. shall include the MCPTT Group ID field;
2\. shall stop timer T15 (Conversation), timer T16 (Map Group To Bearer) and
timer T17 (Unmap Group To Bearer), if running; and
3\. shall release the instance of the \'Participating MCPTT function MBMS
subchannel management\' state machine used for the conversation.
#### 10.2.3.12 Move conversation to unicast
If the participating MCPTT server decides that an ongoing conversation over an
MBMS bearer shall start using unicast bearers, the participating MCPTT
function may send an Application Paging message over the MBMS subchannel
associated with this conversation.
NOTE: The Application Paging message can be sent at the same time as the
conversation is started using unicast bearers, this will improve the MCPTT
access time since the Application Paging message in most cases will reach the
client quicker than using normal paging procedures.
## 10.3 MBMS subchannel control procedure for the MCPTT client
### 10.3.1 General
An MCPTT client that supports receiving floor control messages and RTP media
packets over an MBMS bearer shall support the procedures in the following
clauses.
The procedures in the following clauses assume that an MBMS bearer is active
and announced as described in clause 4.1.3.
NOTE: The floor control procedures described in clause 6.2 are not impacted
due to the use of an MBMS bearer.
### 10.3.2 Conversation over a pre-activated MBMS bearer is started
When receiving a Map Group To Bearer message over the general purpose MBMS
subchannel, the MBMS interface in the MCPTT client:
1\. shall associate the TMGI in the TMGI field, the MBMS subchannel for audio
and for floor control with the MCPTT group identity in the MCPTT Group ID
field.
### 10.3.3 Receive floor control messages and RTP media packets over a MBMS
subchannel
If the MBMS interface receives RTP media packets or floor control messages
over the MBMS subchannel, the MBMS interface in the MCPTT client:
1\. if there is an association between the TMGI, the MBMS subchannel for audio
and for floor control to an ongoing conversation in a group session:
a. shall forward the received floor control messages to the floor participant
in the conversation; and
b. if the received RTP media contains a different SSRC value than the SSRC
value used by the MCPTT client, shall forward the received RTP packets to the
media mixer in the conversation; and
2\. if there is no such association:
a. shall ignore the received floor control message or received RTP media
packet.
### 10.3.4 Conversation ended
When receiving the Unmap Group To Bearer message over a MBMS subchannel, the
MBMS interface in the MCPTT client:
1\. shall remove the association between the TMGI, the MBMS subchannel for
audio and for floor control from the conversation in the group session
identified by the MCPTT Group ID field, if such an association exists.
### 10.3.5 Receive Application Paging message
When receiving an Application Paging message over an MBMS subchannel, an MCPTT
client in idle mode shall make a service request to enter RRC Connected mode.
### 10.3.6 Receive MBMS bearer announcement over MBMS bearer
When receiving an MBMS bearer announcement message over an MBMS subchannel, an
MCPTT client shall acknowledge this message by sending an MBMS bearer
listening status report as as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2] clause 14.2.3.
## 10.4 Header compression
### 10.4.1 General
Packet headers can be compressed with ROHC (ref. RFC 5795 [20]) when delivered
over MBMS to save network resources.
The participating MCPTT function can apply ROHC before pushing packets to the
BM-SC over the MB2-U interface, or can request the BM-SC to apply ROHC, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.468 [6].
Header compression is done after media plane encryption and header
decompression is done before media plane decryption.
Header compression supported profiles for MCPTT are profile 0x0101 for
RTP/UDP/IP compression, specified in RFC 5225 [22], and profile 0x0000 for
sending uncompressed packets, specified in RFC 3075 [21]. MBMS subchannels
encoded with profile 0x0101 use a distinct CID (ROHC context ID). One common
CID may be used for all MBMS subchannels encoded with profile 0x0000.
Before establishing an MBMS bearer with header compression, the participating
MCPTT function determines the value for the MAX_CID parameter (clause 5.1.2 in
RFC 5795 [20]). If MAX_CID > 15 then the header compressor uses the large CID
representation. Else, the header compressor uses the small CID representation.
Only the unidirectional mode of operation (clause 4.4.1 in IETF RFC 3095 [21])
is used for MCPTT over MBMS.
### 10.4.2 Participating MCPTT function procedure for ROHC
If the participating MCPTT function decides to compress headers for a given
MBMS bearer, the participating MCPTT function:
1) shall declare the usage of ROHC within the MBMS bearer announcement, as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2];
2) if the participating MCPTT function asks the BM-SC to apply ROHC (procedure
10.7.3.12.3 of 3GPP TS 23.280 [23]), the participating MCPTT function shall
indicate the list of multicast IP and ports to be header compressed with
profile 0x0101 when activating or modifying a MBMS bearer (see 3GPP TS 29.468
[6]); and
3) if the participating MCPTT function applies ROHC (procedure 10.7.3.12.2 of
3GPP TS 23.280 [23]), the participating MCPTT function shall compress the
packet headers according to RFC 3095 [21] and RFC 5795 [20] for any packet to
be delivered to the MBMS bearer, using the unidirectional mode and without
ROHC segmentation.
### 10.4.3 MCPTT client procedure for ROHC
If usage of ROHC is declared within the MBMS bearer announcement, as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2], the MCPTT client:
1) shall decompress the received ROHC packets according to RFC 3095 [21] and
RFC 5795 [20]; and2) shall forward the decompressed packets to the media
mixer.
# 10A Additional MBMS procedures
## 10A.1 Group dynamic data notifications
Prior to using the MBMS bearer the participating MCPTT function needs to
activate the MBMS bearer and announce the MBMS bearer as described in clause
4.1.3. The participating MCPTT function uses the listening status reports to
decide for which users the participating MCPTT function sends the group
dynamic data notifications over MBMS, and for which users the participating
MCPTT function continues to use unicast bearers.
This procedure is used when MCPTT clients subscribe to group dynamic data.
When the terminating participating function receives a SIP NOTIFY request
towards a user listening to the MBMS subchannel that comes from the
controlling MCPTT function and is related to a subscription for group dynamic
data, the participating MCPTT function shall:
1\. respond to the SIP NOTIFY request with a SIP 200 (OK) request;
2\. map the information in the SIP NOTIFY request to the information elements
in clause 8.5.3; and
3\. send the Group Dynamic Data Notify message over the MBMS bearer.

# 12 Extensions within the present document
## 12.1 Session description types defined within the present document
### 12.1.1 General
This clause contains definitions for SDP parameters that are specific to SDP
usage with MCPTT and therefore are not described in an RFC.
### 12.1.2 SDP \"fmtp\" attribute for MCPTT
#### 12.1.2.1 General
This clause defines the structure and syntax of the SDP \"fmtp\" attribute,
when used to negotiate an MCPTT media plane control channel. The MCPTT media
plane control channel, and the protocols used on the control channel, is
described in the present specification.
#### 12.1.2.2 Semantics
In an SDP offer and answer, the \"mc_queueing\" fmtp attribute is used to
indicate support of the Floor Request message queueing mechanism, as defined
in the present specification.
In an SDP offer, the \"mc_priority\" fmtp attribute indicates (using an
integer value between \'1\' and \'255\') the maximum floor priority that the
offerer requests to be used with Floor Request messages sent by the offerer.
In an SDP answer, the attribute parameter indicates the maximum priority level
that the answerer has granted to the offerer. The value must be equal or less
than the value provided in the associated SDP offer.
NOTE 1: If the \"mc_priority\" fmtp attribute is not used within an SDP offer
or answer, a default priority value is assumed.
In an SDP offer, the \"mc_granted\" fmtp attribute parameter indicates that
the offerer supports the procedure where the answerer indicates, using the
fmtp attribute in the associated SDP answer, that the floor has been granted
to the offerer.
NOTE 2: When the \"mc_granted\" fmtp attribute is used in an SDP offer, it
does not indicate an actual request for the floor. The SDP
\"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute can be used to request the floor. In an
SDP answer, the attribute indicates that the floor has been granted to the
offerer.
NOTE 3: Once the offerer has been granted the floor, the offerer has the floor
until it receives a Floor Revoke message, or until the offerer itself releases
the floor by sending a Floor Release message, as described in the present
specification.
In an SDP offer, the \"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute indicates that the
offerer implicitly requests the floor (without the need to send a Floor
Request message). In an SDP answer, the attribute parameter indicates that the
answerer has accepted the implicit floor request. Once the answerer grants the
floor to the offerer, the answerer will send a Floor Granted message.
NOTE 4: The usage of the \"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute in an SDP
answer does not mean that the answerer has granted the floor to the offerer,
only that the answerer has accepted the implicit floor request.
In an SDP answer, the \"mc_ssrc\" fmtp attribute indicates ssrc value of the
offerer. The value may be equal to the value provided in the associated SDP
offer or different if a collision is detected. If the associated SDP offer
does not indicate the ssrc value then server can determine an appropriate
value. This value is returned in an SDP answer only if the answerer accepts
the implicit floor request offered in SDP.
In an SDP offer, the \"mc_no_floor_ctrl\" fmtp attribute indicates that the
offerer wants to use pre-established session call control during the session
without floor control over the offered media plane control channel. In an SDP
answer, the attribute parameter indicates that the answerer has accepted the
request to use the offered media plane control channel for pre-established
session call control during the session without floor control.

# 13 Media plane security
## 13.1 General
Media plane security provides integrity and confidentiality protection of
individual media streams and media plane control messages in MCPTT sessions.
The media plane security is based on 3GPP MCPTT security solution including
key management and end-to-end media and floor control messages protection as
defined in 3GPP TS 33.180 [18].
Various keys and associated key identifiers protect:
1\. RTP transported media;
2\. RTCP transported media control messages (i.e. RTCP SR packets, RTCP RR
packets, RTCP SDES packets);
3\. RTCP APP transported floor control messages;
4\. RTCP APP transported pre-established session call control messages; and
5\. RTCP APP transported MBMS subchannel control messages.

# 14 SDP offer/ answer procedures
## 14.1 General
The capabilities described in clause 4.3 are negotiated in the signalling and
application plane using SDP offer / answer in SIP requests or SIP responses as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2].
NOTE: If the group is configured for audio cut-in floor control the
\"mc_quueing\" and the \"mc_priority\" attributes are ignored as specified in
3GPP TS 24.379 [2].
This clause describes the details of the SDP offer / answer procedures with
regards to the MCPTT fmtp attribute in the \"m=application\" m-line.
## 14.2 Generating an SDP offer
### 14.2.1 General
When the offerer generates an SDP offer, in order to negotiate the
establishment of a media plane control channel, the offerer shall include a
media description (\"m=\" line) associated with the media plane control
channel. In addition, the offerer may associate an SDP fmtp attribute with the
media description.
NOTE: \"Initial offer\" refers to the offer when the media plane control
channel is initially negotiated. It might, or might not, be the initial offer
within the session.
### 14.2.2 \"mc_queueing\" fmtp attribute
The MCPTT client shall include the \"mc_queueing\" fmtp attribute in SDP
offers when queueing of floor request is supported.
The controlling MCPTT function shall include the \"mc_queueing\" fmtp
attribute in SDP offers when queueing of floor request is supported.
The non-controlling MCPTT function shall include the \"mc_queueing\" fmtp
attribute in SDP offers if the controlling MCPTT included the \"mc_queueing\"
fmtp attribute in the SDP offer.
### 14.2.3 \"mc_priority\" fmtp attribute
The MCPTT client shall include the \"mc_priority\" fmtp attribute when a floor
priority different than the default priority is required. The MCPTT client
should base floor priority on the configured value in 3GPP TS 24.484 [13].
When inviting an MCPTT client or an MCPTT group to a pre-arranged group call,
the controlling MCPTT function and the non-controlling MCPTT function shall
include in the \"mc_priority\" fmtp attribute with the value of the \ element in the \ element specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [12].
### 14.2.4 \"mc_granted\" fmtp attribute
The MCPTT client shall include the \"mc_granted\" fmtp attribute in the SDP
offer of an initial SIP INVITE request when it is acceptable for the MCPTT
client to receive a granted indication in the SIP 200 (OK) response to an
initial INVITE request.
NOTE: The use of \"mc_granted\" fmtp attribute in the SDP offer in SIP
requests does not replace or change the basic operation of Floor Granted
message as described in clause 6.
### 14.2.5 \"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute
The MCPTT client shall include the \"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute when
a SIP request shall be interpreted as an implicit floor request. If not
explicitly stated in procedures in the present document or in procedures in
3GPP TS 24.379 [2] that the \"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute shall be
included, the decision to include the \"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute
or not, is an implementation option.
### 14.2.6 \"mc_no_floor_ctrl\" fmtp attribute
When the MCPTT user wants to make a private call or a first-to-answer call
without floor control using a pre-established session, the MCPTT client shall
include the \"mc_no_floor_ctrl\" fmtp attribute in SDP offer of a SIP request.
The floor control related fmtp attributes shall not be included.
The MCPTT client shall include the \"mc_no_floor_ctrl\" fmtp attribute in SDP
offer of an initial SIP INVITE request for establishing pre-established
session when a floor control shall not be used during the private call or
first-to-answer call session. The floor control related fmtp attributes shall
not be included.
## 14.3 Generating the SDP answer
### 14.3.1 General
When the answerer receives an SDP offer, which contains a media description
for a media plane control channel, the answerer shall include a media
description associated with the media plane control channel in the answer. In
addition, the answerer may associate an SDP fmtp attribute with the media
description. The SDP fmtp attribute shall not include parameters that were not
present in the associated SDP offer.
### 14.3.2 \"mc_queueing\" fmtp attribute
The MCPTT client shall include the \"mc_queueing\" fmtp attribute in SDP
answers when queueing of floor request is supported.
The controlling MCPTT function shall include the \"mc_queueing\" fmtp
attribute in SDP answers when queueing of floor request is supported and the
\"mc_queueing\" fmtp attribute was included in the SDP offer.
The non-controlling MCPTT function shall include the \"mc_queueing\" fmtp
attribute in SDP answers if the controlling MCPTT function included the
\"mc_queueing\" fmtp attribute in the SDP offer.
NOTE: For MCPTT clients connected to the non-controlling MCPTT function, the
determination of if queueing is supported or not is determine case by case
using the Track Info field for each individual floor participant.
### 14.3.3 \"mc_priority\" fmtp attribute
If the \"mc_priority\" fmtp attribute is included in an SDP offer, the
controlling MCPTT function:
1\. if the \ element is present in the \ element
as specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [12] for the MCPTT user identified by the
\ element, shall not include a \"mc_priority\" fmtp attribute in the
SDP answer;
2\. if the \ element is not present in the \
element as specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [12] for the MCPTT user identified by
the \ element in the MCPTT group document:
a. shall determine the priority value to include in \"mc_priority\" fmtp
attribute of the SDP answer, by choosing the lowest value from the following
inputs:
i. the value of floor priority in the \"mc_priority\" fmtp attribute included
in the SDP offer;
ii. the value of the \ element in the MCPTT group document as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.481 [12]; and
iii the value of the \ element in the MCPTT
service configuration document as specified in 3GPP TS 24.484 [13]; and
b. shall include the priority value determined above in step 2a, in the
\"mc_priority\" fmtp attribute of the SDP answer.
If the \"mc_priority\" fmtp attribute is included in an SDP offer, the MCPTT
client and the non-controlling MCPTT function shall return the value included
in the SDP offer in the SDP answer.
### 14.3.4 \"mc_granted\" fmtp attribute
If the mc_granted\" fmtp attribute is included in an SDP offer, the
controlling MCPTT function:
1\. if the MCPTT call is not a temporary group session, may use the SIP 200
(OK) response to indicate that the implicit floor request is granted; and
2\. if the MCPTT call is a temporary group session, shall not indicate that
the implicit floor request is granted.
NOTE: A MCPTT group call is a temporary group session when the \ element is present in the \ element as specified in
3GPP TS 24.481 [12].
If the controlling MCPTT function grants the implicit request and decide to
use the SIPP 200 (OK) response to grant the implicit request, the controlling
MCPTT function shall include the \"mc_granted\" fmtp attribute in the SDP
answer.
If the controlling MCPTT function decides not to grant the implicit request,
the controlling MCPTT function shall not include the \"mc_granted\" fmtp
attribute in the SDP answer.
### 14.3.5 \"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute
If the \"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute is included in an SDP offer, the
MCPTT server shall accept the initial INVITE request to be an implicit request
for floor unless the MCPTT client is joining a chat group call or an ongoing
pre-arranged call and include the \"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute in
responses to the SIP request.
### 14.3.6 \"mc_ssrc\" fmtp attribute
If the \"ssrc\" media attribute is included in an SDP offer and the SIP
request shall be interpreted as an implicit floor request
(\"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp attribute is included), the MCPTT server shall
return the value included in the SDP offer or a new ssrc value if a collision
is detected or if the associated SDP offer does not indicate the ssrc value
then the server can determine an appropriate value in the SDP answer of
\"mc_ssrc\" fmtp attribute irrespective of whether \"mc_granted\" fmtp
attribute is present or not in the application m-line.
### 14.3.7 \"mc_no_floor_ctrl\" fmtp attribute
If the \"mc_no_floor_ctrl\" fmtp attribute is included in an SDP offer, the
MCPTT server shall accept the initial SIP INVITE request for establishing pre-
established session without the floor control support during the private call
or first-to-answer call session and include the \"mc_implicit_request\" fmtp
attribute in responses to the initial SIP INVITE request. Shall discard if any
floor control related fmtp attributes are included.
## 14.4 Offerer processing of the SDP answer
When the offerer receives an SDP answer, if an SDP fmtp attribute is
associated with the media description associated with the media plane control
channel, and if the attribute contains attribute parameters that were not
present in the associated offer, the offerer shall discard those attribute
parameters.
## 14.5 Modifying the media plane control channel
When an offerer generates a subsequent SDP offer, the offerer follows the
rules for generating an initial offer, as described in clause 14.2, with the
exception that the offerer shall not include the \'mc_granted\' SDP fmtp
attribute parameter in a subsequent offer. No semantics has been defined for
the \'mc_granted\' attribute parameter in a subsequent offer.
For the \'mc_implicit_request\' semantic is only defined for a subsequent SDP
offer when upgrading from normal to an emergency call using an SIP re-INVITE
request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2].
## 14.6 The use of SDP offer / answer procedures in off-network mode
### 14.6.1 General
The MCPTT client can negotiate the capabilities used in a private call using
PRIVATE CALL SETUP REQUEST message and PRIVATE CALL ACCEPT message as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2]. The PRIVATE CALL SETUP REQUEST message
contains the SDP offer and the PRIVATE CALL ACCEPT message contains the SDP
answer.
When initiating a group call or a broadcast group call using the GROUP CALL
ANNOUNCEMENT message or GROUP CALL BROADCAST message as specified in 3GPP TS
24.379 [2] the capabilities to be used during the call cannot be negotiated.
### 14.6.2 fmtp attribute \"mc_queueing\"
When initiating a private call and if the MCPTT client supports queueing of
floor requests, the MCPTT client shall include the fmtp attribute
\"mc_queueing\" in the SDP offer.
When an MCPTT client accepting the invitation to the private call receives an
SDP offer containing the fmtp attribute \"mc_queueing\" and if the MCPTT
client supports queueing of floor requests, the MCPTT client shall include the
fmtp attribute \"mc_queueing\" in the SDP answer.
When initiating a group call and if queueing of floor requests is supported,
the MCPTT client shall include the fmtp attribute \"mc_queueing\" in the SDP
offer.
NOTE: Participants in a group call where queueing is used acknowledge the
support of queueing in the Floor Indicator field in the Floor Request message.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Signalling flows
# A.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for media plane such as:
1\. On-network floor control signalling flows;
2\. Off-network floor control signalling flows;
2\. Pre-established session control signalling; and
3\. MBMS subchannel control signalling flows.
These signalling flows provide detailed signalling flows, which expand on the
overview information flows provided in 3GPP TS 23.379 [5].
# A.2 Introduction
## A.2.1 General
The signalling flows provided in this annex follow the methodology developed
in this specification.
## A.2.2 Key required to interpret signalling flows
In order to differentiate between messages for floor control, pre-established
call session control, MBMS subchannel control messages, SIP messages and RTP
media packets, the notation in figure A.2.2-1 is used.

Figure A.3.2-1 illustrates a case a user request floor and is granted the
floor during an ongoing MCPTT call.
Figure A.3.2-1: Floor request when the floor is idle
The user at MCPTT client A wants to talk and presses the push-to-talk button.
The steps of the flow are as follows:
1\. The floor participant in the MCPTT client A sends a Floor Request message
to the floor control server.
2\. When the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client A receives the
Floor Request message in the \'U: not permitted and Floor Idle\' state the
Floor Request message is forwarded to the floor control arbitration logic.
3\. When the floor control arbitration logic receives the Floor Request
message in the \'G: Idle\' state, the floor request is authorized. If the
floor request is authorized, the floor control arbitration logic sends the
Floor Granted message to the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client
A and changes the state to \'G: Floor Taken\'.
4\. The floor control interface towards the MCPTT client A forwards the Floor
Granted message to the floor participant in the associated MCPTT client and
changes the state to \'U: permitted\'.
5\. The floor control arbitration logic sends a Floor Taken message to all
other participants in the MCPTT call via the other floor control interfaces
towards the MCPTT clients.
When the Floor Taken message is received by the other floor control interfaces
towards the MCPTT clients the Floor Taken message is forwarded to the floor
participant in the associated MCPTT client and the state is changed to the
\'U: not permitted and Floor Taken\' state.
6\. On receipt of the Floor Granted message the floor participant in the
associated MCPTT client provides a grant notification to the MCPTT user,
changes the state to \'U: has permission\' and the MCPTT client A starts to
forward RTP media packets towards the MCPTT server.
7\. The media distributor distributes the RTP media packets to all other MCPTT
clients in the MCPTT call.
8\. When the user at MCPTT client A stops talking and releases the push-to-
talk button the floor participant in the MCPTT client A sends a Floor Release
message to the floor control server and enter the \'U: pending Release\'
state.
9\. When the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client A receives the
Floor Release message the Floor Release message is forwarded to the floor
control arbitration logic. The floor control interface towards the MCPTT
client A allows the last RTP media packets to be forwarded to the media
distributor in the MCPTT server.
10\. When the last RTP media packet is forwarded to the media distributor in
the MCPTT server the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client A sends
the Floor Idle message to the floor participant in associated MCPTT client A
and changes the state to \'U: not permitted and Floor Idle\'.
11\. When the floor control arbitration logic receives the Floor Release
message the last RTP media packets are allowed to be forwarded.
12\. When the last RTP media packets are distributed by the media distributor
the floor control arbitration logic sends a Floor Idle message to all
participants in the MCPTT call with the exception of the MCPTT client that was
permitted to send media and changes state to \'G: Floor Idle\'. The Floor Idle
message is forwarded by the other floor control interface towards MCPTT
clients. The state in the other floor control interface towards MCPTT clients
is changed to \'U: not permitted and Floor Idle\'.
## A.3.3 Floor request when floor is taken and queueing is not applied
Figure A.3.3-1 illustrates a case when a user requests the floor when the
floor is taken and queueing is not applied in the MCPTT call.
Figure A.3.3-1: Floor request when floor is taken when queueing is not applied
One of the users in the MCPTT call wants to speak and presses the push-to-talk
when the floor is already taken by the MCPTT client A.
1\. The floor participant in one of the other MCPTT clients sends the Floor
Request message towards the floor control server. The Floor participant enters
the \'U: pending Request\' state.
2\. When one of the other floor control interface towards MCPTT clients
receives a Floor Request message in the \'U: not permitted and Floor Taken\'
state and if:
\- the floor request does not include higher priority than the current user
permitted to talk requested; and
\- when queueing of floor requests are not negotiated;
then the other floor control interface towards MCPTT clients send a Floor Deny
message towards the floor participant in the associated MCPTT client.
When the floor participant in the associated MCPTT client receives the Floor
Deny message, the floor participant provides a deny notification to the user.
The Floor participant enters the \'U: has no permission\' state.
## A.3.4 Floor request when floor is taken and queueing is applied
Figure A.3.4-1 illustrates a case when a user request floor when the floor is
taken and queueing is applied in the MCPTT call.
Figure A.3.4-1: Floor request when floor is taken and queueing applied
The user at MCPTT client B wants to speak and presses the push-to-talk when
the floor is already taken by the MCPTT client A.
The steps of the flow is as follows:
1\. The floor participant in the MCPTT client B sends the Floor Request
message towards the floor control server.
2\. When the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client B receives a
Floor Request message in the \'U: not permitted and Floor Taken\' state and
if:
a. the floor request does not include higher priority than the user already
permitted to talk requested; and
b. when queueing of floor requests are negotiated as specified in clause 14;
then the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client B queues the Floor
Request message and sends a Floor Queue Position Info message towards the
floor participant in the MCPTT client B.
When the floor participant in MCPTT client B receives the Floor Queue Position
Info message the floor participant provides a queueing indication to the user
and enters the \'U: queued\' state.
3\. When the user at MCPTT client A stops talking and releases the push-to-
talk button the floor participant in the MCPTT client A sends a Floor Release
message to the floor control server and enters the \'U: pending Release\'
state.
4\. When the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client A receives the
Floor Release message the Floor Release message is forwarded to the floor
control arbitration logic.
5\. When the floor control arbitration logic receives the Floor Release
message the last RTP media packets are allowed to be forwarded. When the last
RTP media packets are distributed the floor control arbitration logic checks
the active floor request queue. In this example there is one floor request in
the queue and a Floor Granted message is sent towards the floor participant in
the MCPTT client B.
6\. The floor control interface towards MCPTT client B interface forwards the
Floor Granted message to the floor participant in MCPTT client B and changes
the state to \'U: permitted\'.
7\. The floor control arbitration logic sends a Floor Taken message to all
other participants in the MCPTT call via the other floor control interfaces
towards MCPTT clients.
When the Floor Taken message is received by the other floor control interface
towards MCPTT clients Floor Taken message is forwarded to the floor
participants in the associated MCPTT client. The floor participant in the
MCPTT client A changes the state to the \'U: not permitted and Floor Taken\'
state.
8\. On receipt of the Floor Granted message the floor participant in MCPTT
client B provides a grant notification to the MCPTT user, changes the state to
\'U: has permission\' and the MCPTT client A starts to forward RTP media
packets towards the MCPTT server.
9\. The media distributor distributes the RTP media packets to all other MCPTT
clients in the MCPTT call.
## A.3.5 Pre-emptive floor request when floor is taken
Figure A.3.5-1 shows the message flow when a user with pre-emptive priority
request floor when the floor is already taken by another user.
Figure A.3.5-1: Pre-emptive floor request when floor is taken
The user at MCPTT client B wants to interrupt the user at the MCPTT client
presses the push-to-talk indicating a pre-emptive priority.
The steps of the flow are as follows:
1\. The floor participant in the MCPTT client B sends the Floor Request
message towards the floor control server. The message includes a pre-emptive
priority.
2\. When the floor control interface towards MCPTT client interface in the
MCPTT server receives a Floor Request message in the \'U: not permitted and
Floor Taken\' state and since the Floor Request message includes a higher pre-
emptive priority than the user that is already permitted to send media the
floor control interface towards the MCPTT client sends the Floor Request
message to the floor control server arbitration logic.
3\. When the floor control server arbitration logic receives the Floor Request
message with the high pre-emptive priority, the floor control server
arbitration logic revokes the current talker\'s permission to talk by sending
a Floor Revoke message to the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client
A.
4\. The floor control interface towards MCPTT client A forwards the Floor
Revoke message to the floor participant in MCPTT A.
5\. When the floor participant in the MCPTT client A receives the Floor Revoke
message, the floor participant provides a floor revoke indication to the MCPTT
user, sends a Floor Release message and changes the state to \'U: pending
Release\'.
6\. When the floor control interface towards the MCPTT client A receives the
Floor Release message, the Floor Release message is forwarded to the floor
control server arbitration logic.
7\. When the floor control arbitration logic receives the Floor Release
message the last RTP media packets are allowed to be received. When the last
RTP media packets are distributed the floor control arbitration logic sends a
Floor Granted message towards the floor control interface towards the MCPTT
client B.
8\. The floor control interface towards MCPTT client receives the Floor
Granted message the Floor Granted message is sent to the floor participant in
MCPTT client B and changes the state to \'U: permitted\'.
9\. The floor control arbitration logic sends a Floor Taken message to all
other participants in the MCPTT call via the other floor control interfaces
towards the MCPTT clients.
When the Floor Taken message is received by the other floor control interfaces
to MCPTT clients the Floor Taken message is forwarded to the floor participant
in the associated MCPTT client. The floor participant in the MCPTT client A
changes the state to the \'U: not permitted and Floor Taken\' state.
10\. On receipt of the Floor Granted message the floor participant in MCPTT
client B provides a grant notification to the MCPTT user, changes the state to
\'U: has permission\' and the MCPTT client A starts to forward RTP media
packets towards the MCPTT server.
11\. The media distributor in the MCPTT server distributes the RTP media
packets to all other MCPTT clients in the MCPTT call.
# A.4 Off-network floor control signalling flows
## A.4.1 General
This clause provides the following message flow examples:
1\. floor request when the floor is idle is shown in clause A.4.2.1;
2\. floor request when floor is taken and queueing of floor requests is not
applied is shown in clause A.4.2.2;
3\. floor request when floor is taken and queueing of floor requests is
applied is shown in clause A.4.2.3; and
4\. pre-emptive floor request when floor is taken is shown in clause A.4.2.4.
## A.4.2 Off-network floor control during an MCPTT group call
### A.4.2.1 Floor request when the floor is idle
Figure A.4.2.1-1 illustrates a user\'s floor request when the floor is idle
i.e. there is no floor arbitrator.
Figure A.4.2.1-1: Floor request when the floor is idle
The user at MCPTT client A wants to talk and presses the push-to-talk button.
The steps of the flow are as follows:
1\. The floor participant in the MCPTT client A sends a Floor Request message
towards other MCPTT clients and starts timer T201 (Floor Request). MCPTT
client A moves to \'O: pending request\' state.
2\. On expiry of T201 (Floor Request) MCPTT client A re-sends the Floor
Request message and restarts timer T201 (Floor Request). This step has to be
repeated for a pre-configured number of times (3 times in the example figure)
before assuming that the floor is idle.
3\. On the expiry of the last iteration of timer T201 (Floor Request), MCPTT
client A sends a Floor Taken message towards other MCPTT client and assumes
the role of floor arbitrator. MCPTT client A moves to \'O: has permission
state\'.
4\. On receiving Floor Taken message, all other MCPTT clients move to \'O: has
no permission state\'.
### A.4.2.2 Floor request when floor is taken and queueing of floor requests
is not applied
Figure A.4.2.2-1 illustrates a user\'s floor request when the floor is taken
and queueing is not applied in the MCPTT call.
Figure A.4.2.2-1: Floor request when floor is taken when queueing is not
applied
One of the users in the MCPTT call wants to speak and presses the push-to-talk
when the floor is already taken by the MCPTT client B and queueing is not
applied.
1\. The floor participant in MCPTT client A sends the Floor Request message
towards other MCPTT clients. The Floor participant enters the \'O: pending
request\' state.
2\. On receiving Floor Request message, MCPTT client B sends a Floor Deny
message with MCPTT client A\'s ID towards all MCPTT clients.
3\. On receiving Floor Deny message, MCPTT client A moves back to \'O: has no
permission\' state.
### A.4.2.3 Floor request when floor is taken and queueing is applied
Figure A.4.2.3-1 illustrates a user\'s floor request when the floor is taken
and queueing is applied in the MCPTT call.
Figure A.4.2.3-1: Floor request when floor is taken and queueing applied
The users at MCPTT client A wants to speak and presses the PTT button when the
floor is already taken by the MCPTT client B.
The steps of the flow are as follows:
1\. The floor participant in the MCPTT client A sends the Floor Request
message towards other MCPTT clients. MCPTT client A moves to \'O: pending
request\' state and starts timer T201 (Floor Request).
2\. On expiry of timer T201 (Floor Request) MCPTT client A re-sends the Floor
Request message and restarts timer T201 (Floor Request). This step has to be
repeated for a pre-configured number of times before assuming that the floor
is idle.
3\. Receiving RTP media indicates that the floor is taken and a floor
arbitrator is present. Sending multiple requests till a reply to the request
is received helps reduce conflicts. Therefore, the counter associated to T201
(Floor Request) is reset every time RTP media is received.
4\. On receiving Floor Queue Position Info message from the floor arbitrator,
MCPTT client A stops timer T201 (Floor Request) and moves to \'O: queued\'
state. Any RTP media received in this state is rendered.
5\. When the user at MCPTT client B indicates to terminate RTP media
transmission, MCPTT client B sends Floor Granted message to the next (MCPTT
client A) in queue. MCPTT client B start timer T205 (Floor Granted request)
and moves to \'O: pending grant\' state.
6\. On receiving Floor Granted message, MCPTT client A starts timer T233
(pending user action) and waits for user to indicate start of RTP media
transmission.
7\. On expiry of timer T205 (Floor Granted) MCPTT client B re-sends the Floor
Granted message and restarts timer T205 (Floor Granted). This step has to be
repeated for a pre-configured number of times while no media is received from
MCPTT client A.
8\. Upon expiry of timer T205 (Floor Granted) for a preconfigured number of
times, MCPTT client B starts timer T233 (pending user action), waiting for RTP
media from MCPTT client A.
9\. MCPTT client A stops timer T233 (pending user action) upon user action.
MCPTT client A moves to \'O: has permission\' state and starts transmission of
RTP media as floor arbitrator.
10\. On receiving RTP media from MCPTT client A, MCPTT client B stops timer
T233 (pending user action) and moves to \'O: has no permission\' state.
### A.4.2.4 Pre-emptive floor request when floor is taken
Figure A.4.2.4-1 shows the message flow when a user requests floor with a pre-
emptive priority when the floor is already taken.
Figure A.4.2.4-1: Pre-emptive Floor request
The user at MCPTT client A, with higher priority than the current floor
arbitrator, wants to speak and presses the push-to-talk when the floor is
taken by the MCPTT client B.
The steps of the flow are as follows:
1\. The floor participant in the MCPTT client A sends the pre-emptive Floor
Request message towards other MCPTT clients and starts timer T201 (Floor
Request). MCPTT client A moves to \'O: pending request\' state.
2\. Upon receiving a higher priority floor request, MCPTT client B sends Floor
Granted message and start timer T205 (Floor Granted request) . Any RTP media
transmission is stopped and MCPTT client B moves to \'O: pending grant\'
state. User at MCPTT client B can be notified of the pre-emption and any RTP
media transmission is stooped.
3\. On expiry of timer T205 (Floor Granted) the MCPTT client B re-sends the
Floor Granted message and restarts timer T205 (Floor Granted). This step has
to be repeated for a pre-configured number of times, if no RTP media from
MCPTT client A.
4\. MCPTT client A moves to \'O: has permission\' state and assumes the role
of floor arbitrator upon receiving Floor Granted message.
5\. On receiving RTP media from MCPTT client A, MCPTT client B stops timer
T205 (Floor Granted) and moves to \'O: has no permission\' state.
# A.5 Pre-established session signalling flows
## A.5.1 General
In the following clauses signalling flows are presented for sample procedures
related to the call setup and the call release when pre-established session is
used.
The behaviour of an originating and terminating client is specified in clause
9.2. The behaviour of the participating MCPTT function is specified in clause
9.3
The behaviour of the controlling MCPTT function is specified in 3GPP TS 24.379
[2]
Only the names of the messages are indicated on the signal flow arrows. The
information elements of each message can be found in clause 9.2 and clause 9.3
for media plane control messages and in 3GPP TS 24.379 [2] for SIP messages.
The signalling flow diagrams also indicate the state of the MCPTT client and
the participating MCPTT function in the state machines specified in clause 9.2
and clause 9.3 respectively.
When the call initialization is accepted additional floor control dialogue is
also indicated in the signalling flow.
The following signalling flows are provided:
1\. call initialization at the originating side when the initialization is
accepted (clause A.5.2.1);
2\. call initialization at the originating side when the initialization is
rejected (clause A.5.2.2);

A.5.2.3); and
4\. call release (clause A.5.3).
## A.5.2 Call Initialization
### A.5.2.1 Originating Side when initialization accepted
Figure A.5.2.1-1 illustrates the flow of MCPT and MCPC messages when the call
initiation request sent by an originating MCPTT client is accepted by the
controlling MCPTT function. In this diagram it is assumed that the call
initiation request includes implicit floor request.
Figure A.5.2.1-1: Call initialization accepted; originating side
One of the users with a pre-established session initiates a call and the call
is accepted by the controlling MCPTT function. Steps 1 to 5 are conducted
using SIP messages (see 3GPP TS 24.379 [2]).
1\. A pre-established session is created between the origination MCPTT user
and the participating MCPTT server. The MCPTT client is in \'U: Pre-
established session not in use\" state and the participating MCPTT function is
in \'G: Pre-established session not in use\' state.
2\. The origination MCPTT client initiates a call as described in 3GPP TS 24
379 [2] by sending a SIP REFER message. The participating MCPTT function
enters into \'G: Pre-established session in use\' state.
3\. The participating MCPTT function sends SIP 200 (OK) to the originating
MCPTT client and then the originating MCPTT client enters into \'U:Pre-
established session in use\' state.

Figure A.5.2.2-1 illustrates the flow of MCPC messages when the call
initiation request by an originating MCPTT client is rejected.
Figure A.5.2.2-1: Call initialization rejected
One of the users with a pre-established session initiates a call and the call
is rejected by the controlling MCPTT function. Steps 1- 5 are conducted using
SIP messages (see 3GPP TS 24.379 [2]).
1\. A pre-established session is created between the origination MCPTT client
and the participating MCPTT server. The MCPTT client is in \'U:Pre-established
session not in use\" state and the participating MCPTT function is in \'G:
Pre-established session not in use\' state.
2\. The origination MCPTT client initiates a call as described in 3GPP TS
24.379 [2] by sending a SIP REFER message.The participating MCPTT function
enters into \'G:Pre-established session in use\' state.
3\. The participating MCPTT function sends SIP 200 (OK) to the originating
MCPTT client and then the originating MCPTT client enters into \'U:Pre-
established session in use\' state.
4-5.The participating MCPTT function sends a SIP INVITE message to the
controlling MCPTT function and receives SIP 4xx response from the controlling
MCPTT function. The participating MCPTT function enters into \'G: Call
Releasing\' state.
6\. The participating MCPTT server sends a Disconnect message to the
originating MCPTT client. The originating MCPTT client enters into \'U: Pre-
established session not in use\' state.
7\. The originating MCPTT client responds with an Acknowledge message. After
receiving the Acknowledge message the participating MCPTT function enters into
\'G:Pre-established session not in use\' state.
### A.5.2.3 Termination Side when call initialization accepted
Figure A.5.2.3-1 illustrates the flow of MCPC and MCPT messages when the call
initiation is informed to the terminating MCPTT client. In this figure it is
assumed that the call initiation request includes implicit floor request.
Although the figure shows only one terminating MCPTT client, the messaging
takes place with each one of the terminating MCPTT clients with a pre-
established session.
Figure A.5.2.3-1: Call initialization accepted; terminating side
When a call initiation is accepted by the controlling MCPTT function, the
terminating MCPTT client(s) with pre-established session is (are) informed.
Steps 1 to 3 are conducted using SIP messages (see 3GPP TS 24.379 [2]).
1\. A pre-established session is created between the terminating MCPTT user
and the participating MCPTT server. The MCPTT client is in \'U: Pre-
established session not in use\" state and the participating MCPTT function is
in \'G: Pre-established session not in use\' state.
2\. The controlling MCPTT server informs the participating MCPTT server the
call initiation by sending an SIP INVITE message. The participating MCPTT
function enters into \'G: pre-established session in use\' state.
3\. The participating MCPTT function sends SIP 200 (OK) to the controlling
MCPTT function.
4\. The participating MCPTT function sends a Connect message to the
terminating MCPTT client.

but the pre-established session used by this call is preserved.
Figure A.5.3-1: Call release for a call with pre-established session
A call with a pre-established session is released by preserving the pre-
established session used by this call. Steps 2 and 3 are conducted using SIP
messages (see 3GPP TS 24.379 [2]).
1\. A call using a pre-established session is being conducted. The MCPTT
client is in \'U:Pre-established session in use\' state and the participating
MCPTT function is in \'G: Pre-established session in use\' state.
2\. The call release decision is taken by the controlling MCPTT function and
informed to the participating MCPTT function as described in 3GPP TS 24.379
[2] by sending a SIP BYE message.
3\. The participating MCPTT function sends an SIP ACK message to the
controlling MCPTT function and enters into \'G: Call Releasing\' state.
4\. The participating MCPTT server sends a Disconnect message to the MCPTT
client of this pre-established session.

# A.6 MBMS subchannel control signalling flows
## A.6.1 General
The following clauses describe examples of how an MBMS bearer is managed
during group call.
The following signalling flows are provided:
\- announcing MBMS subchannels (clause A.6.2);
\- initiating a conversation and requesting floor, originating side (clause
A.6.3); and
\- releasing floor and ending a conversation (clause A.6.4).
## A.6.2 Announcing MBMS subchannels
This clause contains an example message flow illustrating how the
participating MCPTT function announces MBMS subchannels.
The pre-requisites to the flow are:
1\. The MCPTT client participates in an ongoing group session. The group
session can be either a chat group session or a pre-arranged group session.
2\. There is no conversation ongoing, i.e. the floor is idle.
3\. The group session has a small number of participants that depending on the
availability of MBMS subchannels can use a MBMS subchannel or the unicast
bearer when in an MBMS service area.
Figure A.6.2-1 shows the message flow.
Figure A.6.2-1: Announcing MBMS subchannels
The steps of the message flow are as follows:
1\. A group session is ongoing. This can be a chat group or a pre-arranged
group. The MCPTT session identity for this group is 12345\@controller1.mcptt-
op.net.
2\. The participating MCPTT function pre-activates MBMS bearers. The trigger
for doing this is implementation dependent but can be a result of received
location reports from MCPTT clients served by the participating MCPTT
function.
3-5. The participating MCPTT functions sends a SIP MESSAGE request to a
selected number of MCPTT clients. This can happen exactly after a pre-
activated MBMS bearer is created or when an MCPTT client registers or an MCPTT
user affiliates to a group. The SIP MESSAGE request contains:
a. the \"application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-mbms-usage-info\" MIME body with:
i. a reference to media line in the \"application/sdp\" MIME body where the
general purpose MBMS subchannels are defined in the \ element; and
ii. one or more \ elements where each announcement contains:
A. TMGI in the \ element identifying the announcement;
B. QCI in the \ element;
C. if multiple carrier are supported, frequency in the \ element;
D. a list of MBMS service areas in the \ element;
b. an \"application/sdp\" MIME body with:
i. one \"a=audio ...\" media line containing the relevant media-line
attributes. Where:
A. the IP address is set the unspecified address (0.0.0.0), if IPv4, or to a
domain name within the \".invalid\" DNS top-level domain; and
B the port number is set to \"9\".
i. one \"a=application ...\" media line to be used as the general purpose MBMS
subchannel; and
ii. optionally, one or more \"a=application ...\" media lines to be used as
the MBMS subchannel for floor control.
6-8. The MCPTT client acknowledges the SIP MESSAGE request by means of the SIP
200 (OK) response.
9\. The MCPTT client moves into an MBMS service area where the announced MBMS
bearer is available.
10-12. The MCPTT client sends a SIP MESSAGE request containing the
\"application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-mbms-usage-info\" MIME body containing:
a. the \ element set to the value \"listening\"; and
b. the \ set to \"true\".
13-15. The participating MCPTT function acknowledges the SIP MESSAGE request
by means of the SIP 200 (OK) response.
16\. The participating MCPTT server receives a Floor Request message from one
of the served MCPTT clients or a Floor Taken message from the controlling
MCPTT function indicating that a conversation is started in the group session.
17\. The participating MCPTT function decides to use one of the MBMS
subchannels in the pre-activated MBMS bearer for the conversation in the group
session.
18\. The participating MCPTT function sends the Map Group to Bearer messages
over the general purpose MBMS subchannel, the Map Group To Bearer message
contains:
a. the TMGI in the TMGI field;
b. the MCPTT Group Identity field in the MCPTT Group ID field;
c. the MBMS Subchannel field containing:
i. the TMGI,
ii. a reference to which media line to be used for audio; and
ii. optionally, a reference to the media line specifying the \"m=application
...\". If this reference is absent, floor control messages are sent over the
MBMS subchannel used for audio.
19-21. The MCPTT client sends a SIP MESSAGE request containing the
\"application/vnd.3gpp.mcptt-mbms-usage-info\" MIME body containing:
a. the \ element set to the value \"listening\";
b. the \ set to 12345\@controller1.mcptt-op.net; and
c. the TMGI;
22\. The MCPTT client starts listen to the MBMS subchannel(s) indicated in the
Map Group To Bearer message. Note that RTP media packets can now be received
over both the MBMS subchannel and the unicast channel (the same applies for
floor control messages) and the MCPTT client needs to ignore duplicated RTP
media packets and floor control messages.
23-25. The participating MCPTT function acknowledge with a 200 (OK) response
to the SIP MESSAGE request.
26\. When the MCPTT client receives the SIP 200 (OK) response the MCPTT client
stops listen to the unicast bearer.
## A.6.3 Initiating a conversation and requesting floor, originating side
This clause shows the signalling flow when an MCPTT client starts a
conversation in an ongoing group session using a pre-activated MBMS bearer.
Figure A.6.3-1 shows the signalling flow.
NOTE: The arrows and boxes with dotted lines represent events sent over the
MBMS bearer.
Figure A.6.3-1: Initiating a conversation and requesting floor
The MCPTT clients 1 to 4 participate in a group session. All MCPTT clients are
served by the same participating MCPTT function. The MCPTT clients 1 to 3 are
within an area where an MBMS bearer is available. The MCPTT client 4 is
outside this area and can only use a unicast bearer.
A MBMS subchannel exists and associated with a general purpose media plane
control channel which can be used to deliver MBMS subchannel control messages
of any group in this MBMS service area.
The steps of the flow are as follows:
1\. A group session is ongoing. At the moment none of the group members has
the permission to send media.
2\. The participating MCPTT function activates and announces an MBMS bearer as
described in clause A.6.2. The pre-activated MBMS bearer is not yet associated
with a particular group with participants served by this participating MCPTT
function.
3\. The user at the MCPTT client 1 presses the PTT button.
4-5. The floor participant 1 sends a Floor Request as specified in clause 6.2.
The Floor Request is forwarded by the participating MCPTT function to the
controlling MCPTT function.
6\. When the participating MCPTT function receives the Floor Request message
the participating MCPTT function determines that the previously activated and
announced MBMS bearer can be used for this conversation and sends the Map
Group to Bearer message over the general purpose MBMS subchannel to inform
about the start of the conversation. The Map Group to Bearer message includes
the TMGI, the MBMS subchannel for audio and floor control and the MCPTT group
identifier in the activated MBMS bearer used for the conversation. The
participating MCPTT function enters the \'M: A conversation is active\' state.
On receipt of the Map Group to Bearer message the MBMS interface in the MCPTT
client 1, 2 and 3 associates the conversation with the TMGI, the MBMS
subchannel for audio and floor control with the MCPTT group identifier in the
Map Group to Bearer message.
7-8. On receipt of the Floor Request message, the floor control server
function grants the floor participant 1 to send media by sending the Floor
Granted message. The participating MCPTT function forwards the message to the
floor participant 1 over the unicast bearer.
9-16. The floor control server sends the Floor Taken message towards all
participants. The participating MCPTT functions sends one Floor Taken message
over the MBMS subchannel associated with this group as declared in step 6 and
discards the remaining Floor Taken messages with the exception of the Floor
Taken messages towards participants not listening to the MBMS bearer, in this
example, the floor participant 4.
NOTE: The participating MCPTT function uses the message-sequence-number field
to determine if a Floor Taken message is already sent over the MBMS floor
control bearer or not.
17\. The floor control continues as described in clause A.5.2.
18\. When the Floor Granted message is received in the floor participant 1,
the floor participant 1 requests the MCPTT client to start encoding voice and
send RTP media packets. The MCPTT client 1 starts encoding voice from the
MCPTT user and sends RTP media packets over the unicast bearer towards the
participating MCPTT function. The participating MCPTT function forwards the
RTP media packets towards the controlling MCPTT function.
19-24. The controlling MCPTT function distributes the RTP media packets to all
MCPTT clients. The participating MCPTT function sends one media stream over
the MBMS subchannel associated with this group. If an MCPTT client is not
listening to the MBMS bearer, in this example the MCPTT client 4, the
participating MCPTT function forwards the RTP media packets to MCPTT client 1
over the unicast bearer.
As long as the conversation is active and the MBMS subchannel for this group
is available any of the MCPTT users can request floor and the Floor Taken,
Floor Idle and RTP packets are sent over the MBMS bearer.
## A.6.4 Releasing floor and ending a conversation
This clause describes how the participant 1 releases the floor and how the
participating MCPTT function decides to end the conversation.
Figure A.6.4-1 shows the signalling flow.
NOTE: The arrows and boxes with dotted lines represent events sent over the
MBMS bearer.
Figure A.6.4-1: Releasing floor and ending a conversation
The steps of the flow are:
1\. The MCPTT clients 1 to 4 participate in a group session. All MCPTT clients
are served by the same participating MCPTT function. The MCPTT clients 1 to 3
are within an area where a MBMS subchannel is used for the conversation. The
MCPTT client 4 is outside this area and can only use a unicast bearer. At the
moment the participant at MCPTT client 1 has the floor. The conversation over
the MBMS bearer started as described in clause A.6.4.
2\. The MCPTT user at the MCPTT client 1 releases the PTT button. The MCPTT
client 1 indicates to the floor participant 1 that the PTT button is released.
3-4. The floor participant 1 sends the Floor Release message over the unicast
bearer. The participating MCPTT function forwards the message to the
controlling MCPTT function.
5-13. The floor control server sends the Floor Idle message to all
participants. The participating MCPTT function sends the first received Floor
Idle message destined to an MCPTT client using the MBMS subchannel mentioned
in step 1. Any other Floor Idle messages destined to an MCPTT client listening
to the MBMS bearer are discarded. Any Floor Idle message destined to an MCPTT
client outside the MBMS bearer coverage, in this case the MCPTT client 4, is
forwarded over the unicast bearer to the floor participant.
14\. The conversation ends. The conversation timer expires and the
participating MCPTT server decides to end the conversation on this MBMS
subchannel.
The conversation timer is a relative long timer and needed to avoid that
inactive group sessions are unnecessarily occupying the MBMS subchannel. The
MBMS subchannel can then be reused by other conversations in other group
sessions.
15\. The participating MCPTT function sends the Unmap Group to Bearer message
over the MBMS subchannel. The MBMS interfaces in the MCPTT clients 1, 2 and 3
removes the association between the TMGI, the MBMS subchannel for audio and
for floor control and the MCPTT group identity.
16\. The participating MCPTT function continues to retransmit the Unmap Group
to Bearer message until all MCPTT clients has moved to unicast. When all MCPTT
client is listening to the unicast bearer, the participating MCPTT function
enter the \'M: No conversation is active\' state.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Media encapsulation for end-to-end
distribution using MBMS bearers
Table B-1 shows specific header field values of the media plane packet from
the originating MCPTT client, starting with the codec payload to the MCPTT
server, from where it is distributed in downlink via IP multicast over MBMS to
the terminating MCPTT clients. Each line represents a logical or physical
\"Entity\" which handles the incoming packet (or generated packet for the
first line) and passes it to the next \"Entity\" via the interface \"Reference
Point\" indicated in this line. Additional entries of the line represent
specific parts of the packet when it is put to the \"Reference Point\" by the
\"Entity\". The rightmost column is the inner part of the packet. The
parameters indicated in a column indicate the value of specific information
elements set by the \"Entity\" in the header encapsulating all the parts to
the right of the column.
All shown IP addresses (as s= for the source address and as d= as the
destination address) can be IPv4 or IPv6 and are considered routable as
necessary and distinct from each other within the same domain if they have
different designations: it is up to the implementations to handle local IP
addresses, perform NAT or use additional tunnelling. UDP ports of different
designations correspond to potentially different port numbers. The UDP port
numbers are designated as capital letter within squared brackets.
The unicast IP address IP~1~ and the sending UDP port [A] of the originator UE
are as specified in the SDP during the most recent setup for the SIP session
which precedes the MBMS distribution of MCPTT traffic. The multicast IP
address IP~5m~ and the associated receiving UDP port [H] used for the
distribution of media packets are provided to the terminating MCPTT clients
via MCPTT signalling.
The SSRC is set to a value that uniquely identifies the originating MCPTT
client during the (S)RTP session, in accordance to IETF RFC 3550 [3] and IETF
RFC 3711 [8].
The inner IP header, inner UDP port and (S) RTP header may be compressed with
ROHC as specified in clause 10.4.

NOTE 1: IP6 and [J] are provided to the participating MCPTT function by the BM-SC over MB2-C reference point during the MBMS bearer activation procedure. NOTE 2: IP7m is given to eNBs when they are informed that the activated MBMS Bearer will be transmitted by them. Then the eNBs join this IP multicast address. NOTE 3: The terminating MCPTT client starts listening for traffic on IP5m and [H] when the group/media stream is mapped to this multicast IP address and port number respectively, via MCPTT signalling (Map Group To Bearer message). NOTE 4: Specified in 3GPP TS 25.446 [9]. NOTE 5: Specified in 3GPP TS 29.281 [10]. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
###### ## Annex C (Informative): Floor control state machine transitions
tables
# C.1 Introduction
This annex contains state transitions tables.
# C.2 Off-network tables
## C.2.1 Off-network call floor control state machine transitions
The table is a representation of the off-network call floor control state
machine in terms of:
1) the resulting state, and
2) the actions to be done;
as a function of:
3) the current state, and
4) the trigger causing the transition.
The trigger is either an external event, an input coming externally to the
state machine or an auxiliary internal even like the expiry of a timer or a
counter.
Examples for an action to be done are the transmission of a message,
initiation of a timer or a counter etc.
Table C.2.1-1 shows the off-network group call floor control transitions.
