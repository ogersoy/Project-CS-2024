In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 Architectural Assumptions and Requirements
## 4.1 Architectural Assumptions
The following architectural assumptions apply:
\- The PDU sessions of the UE can be transferred when a UE moves from a PLMN
with Disaster Condition to a PLMN providing Disaster Roaming.
\- In principle, the Disaster Inbound Roamers can receive the same services in
a PLMN without Disaster Condition as non-disaster inbound roamers can receive
in the PLMN without Disaster Condition, subject to agreement between HPLMN of
the UE and the PLMN without Disaster Condition, regulations of the country,
and constraints of the PLMN without Disaster Condition.
\- The network functions except one or more RAN nodes of the PLMN with
Disaster Condition can be assumed to be still operational. One or more RAN
nodes of the PLMN with Disaster Condition are non-operational.
\- Architecture defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [4] is used as basis architecture
for supporting minimization of service interruption.
## 4.2 Architectural Requirements
The system shall satisfy the stage-1 requirements in TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31
and TS 22.011 [2] clause 3.2.2.
The solution shall enable a UE of a selected PLMN (HPLMN or VPLMN) with
Disaster Condition, to select and register on another PLMN without Disaster
Condition in UE\'s forbidden PLMN list when no other PLMN is available except
for PLMNs in UE\'s forbidden PLMN list and the PLMN without Disaster Condition
is able to accept Disaster Inbound Roamers from the PLMN with Disaster
Condition.
If the UE, with HPLMN subscription, was informed by the HPLMN that it should
apply Disaster Roaming when a Disaster Condition arises (in the HPLMN or a
VPLMN), the solution shall enable a UE to detect that a Disaster Condition
applies to PLMN D, where PLMN D is the UE\'s HPLMN or a PLMN not in the UE\'s
forbidden PLMNs list, regardless of whether the UE is registered in PLMN D or
not. When the UE detects that a Disaster Condition applies to PLMN D, the
solution shall enable the UE to select and to register on another PLMN without
Disaster Condition in the UE\'s forbidden PLMNs list when no other PLMN is
available except for PLMNs in the UE\'s forbidden PLMNs list and the PLMN
without Disaster Condition is able to accept Disaster Inbound Roamers from the
PLMN with Disaster Condition.
# 5 Key Issues
## 5.1 Key Issue #1: Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE
### 5.1.1 Description
According to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31.2.2:
_The 3GPP system shall enable UEs to obtain information that a Disaster
Condition applies to a particular PLMN or PLMNs._
_NOTE: If a UE has no coverage of its HPLMN, then obtains information that a
Disaster Condition applies to the UE\'s HPLMN, the UE can register with a PLMN
offering Disaster Roaming service._
According to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31.2.3:
_The 3GPP system shall provide means to enable that a Disaster Condition
applies to UEs of a specific PLMN._
When a Disaster Condition applies to a PLMN or PLMNs in an area, a UE is
located in the area, and the PLMN is HPLMN of the UE or was selected by the
UE, then the UE shall be able to obtain information that the Disaster
Condition applies to the PLMN.
NOTE: The interactions between this Key Issue and the Key Issue #7 (Prevention
of signalling overload in PLMNs without Disaster Condition) need to be
considered, since preventing UEs from overloading the PLMNs without Disaster
Condition could have an impact on how the UEs are notified that the Disaster
Condition applies.
The following questions are expected to be studied within this Key Issue:
\- How to deliver the information on the Disaster Condition of a PLMN in an
area to the UE located in the area;
\- Which network functions or entities are involved for the delivery of the
information;
\- Which PLMN(s) are responsible for the delivery of the information; and
\- What kind of information should be delivered to the UE.
## 5.2 Key Issue #2: Notification of applicability on Disaster Condition to
PLMNs without Disaster Condition
### 5.2.1 Description
According to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31.2.2:
Subject to regulatory requirements or operator\'s policy, the 3GPP system
shall support a PLMN operator to be made aware of the failure or recovery of
other PLMN(s) in the same country when the Disaster Condition is applies, or
when the Disaster Condition is not applicable.
The 3GPP system shall support means for a PLMN operator to be aware of the
area where Disaster Condition applies.
When a Disaster Condition applies to a particular PLMN or PLMNs, the PLMN(s)
without Disaster Condition in the same country shall be notified that Disaster
Condition applies to PLMN(s) or Disaster Condition no longer applies. Also as
per service requirement quoted above, the PLMN(s) in the same country can be
made aware of the area where Disaster Condition applies.
The following questions are expected to be studied within this Key Issue:
\- How to deliver the information on the Disaster Condition to the PLMNs
without Disaster Condition;
\- Who or which entity decides the Disaster Condition;
\- How to provide information on the area where Disaster Condition applies;
and
\- What kind of information, if any, should be delivered to the PLMNs without
Disaster Condition other than what is mentioned above.
NOTE: The interactions between this Key Issue and the Key Issue #8 (Prevention
of signalling overload by returning UEs in PLMN previously with Disaster
Condition) need to be considered, since preventing UEs from overloading a PLMN
previously with Disaster Condition could have an impact on how the PLMNs
without Disaster Condition are notified that the Disaster Condition no longer
applies.
## 5.3 Key Issue #3: Indication of accessibility from other PLMNs without
Disaster Condition to the UE
### 5.3.1 Description
According to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31.2.3:
The 3GPP system shall be able to provide a resource efficient means for a PLMN
to indicate to potential Disaster Inbound Roamers whether they can access the
PLMN or not.
When a Disaster Condition applies to a particular PLMN or PLMNs, one or more
PLMNs in the same country may be able to provide Disaster Roaming service to
the UEs of a PLMN with Disaster Condition. In this case, the PLMN providing
Disaster Roaming shall indicate that it can accommodate the Disaster Inbound
Roamers from a PLMN with Disaster Condition.
The following questions are expected to be studied within this Key Issue:
\- Which PLMN(s) are responsible for indicating their accesibility to Disaster
Inbound Roamers;
\- How other PLMN(s) than the PLMN with Disaster Condition indicate that they
can accommodate Disaster Inbound Roamer; and
\- What information can be provided to potential Disaster Inbound Roamers.
NOTE: The interactions between this Key Issue and the Key Issue #7 (Prevention
of signalling overload in PLMNs without Disaster Condition) need to be
considered, since preventing UEs from overloading a PLMN without Disaster
Condition could have an impact on whether and how the PLMN indicates that it
can accept Disaster Inbound Roamers.
## 5.4 Key Issue #4: Registration to the roaming PLMN without Disaster
Condition in case of Disaster Condition
### 5.4.1 Description
When the UE of a PLMN with Disaster Condition is notified of Disaster
Condition, according to conclusion of the Key Issue #1, and the UE selects the
other PLMN providing Disaster Roaming service, then the UE shall perform the
registration procedure in order to be registered to the PLMN. It is unclear
how the Disaster Roaming PLMN authenticates the UE and how to collect charging
information when the Disaster Condition applies.
According to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31.2.3:
3GPP system shall be able to collect charging information for a Disaster
Inbound Roamer with information about the applied disaster condition
According to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31.2.2:
The 3GPP system shall be able to support provision of service to Disaster
Inbound Roamer only within the specific region where Disaster Condition
applies.
As per this service requirement quoted, the Disaster Roaming PLMN shall be
able to consider the area of service to Disaster Inbound Roamers that is
limited to the region where Disaster Condition applies.
The following questions are expected to be studied within this Key Issue:
\- How a registration procedure initiated by Inbound Disaster Roamer is
performed;
\- How to authenticate Inbound Disaster Roamer during the registration
procedure;
\- Which network functions or entities are involved for the registration
procedure of Disaster Inbound Roamers;
\- How a Disaster Roaming PLMN can limit the area of service to Inbound
Disaster Roamers to the region where Disaster Condition applies;
\- How and which function to collect charging information for a Disaster
Inbound Roamer with information about the applied disaster condition; and
\- What other information, if any, is needed to be transferred between the UE
and the network during the initial registration procedure.
## 5.5 Key issue #5: PLMN selection when a \"Disaster Condition\" applies
### 5.5.1 Description
If the UE determines that a Disaster Condition applies as described in Key
Issue #1 \"Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE\", then the PLMN
selection procedure needs to be updated so the UE avoids selecting the PLMN
with Disaster Condition.
If the UE determines that a Disaster Condition applies as described in Key
Issue #1 \"Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE\", there is no
available PLMN except for PLMNs in the list of \"Forbidden PLMNs\", and one or
more available PLMNs indicate accessibility for the UE as described in Key
Issue #3 \"Indication of accessibility from other PLMNs without Disaster
Condition to the UE\", then the PLMN selection procedure needs to be updated
so that the UE selects one of the PLMNs indicating accessibility for the UE.
In addition, if there are more than one PLMN indicating accessibility for the
UE, then PLMN selection procedure needs to be updated for selecting one of
those PLMNs.
According to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31.2.3:
The 3GPP system shall be able to provide means to enable a UE to access PLMNs
in a forbidden PLMN list if a Disaster condition applies and no other PLMN is
available except for PLMNs in the forbidden PLMN list.
The following questions are expected to be studied within this key issue:
1) How the UE selects a PLMN if it is determined that a \"Disaster Condition\"
applies;
a) If the UE determines that a Disaster Condition applies as described in Key
Issue #1 \"Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE\", then how to update
PLMN selection procedure so that the UE avoids selecting the PLMN with
Disaster Condition.
b) If the UE determines that a Disaster Condition applies as described in Key
Issue #1 \"Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE\", there is no
available PLMN except for PLMNs in the list of \"Forbidden PLMNs\", and one or
more available PLMNs indicate accessibility for the UE as described in Key
Issue #3 \"Indication of accessibility from other PLMNs without Disaster
Condition to the UE\", then how to update PLMN selection procedure so that the
UE selects one of the PLMNs indicating accessibility for the UE.
c) if there are more than one PLMN indicating accessibility for the UE, then
how to update PLMN selection procedure for selecting one of those PLMNs.
NOTE: The interaction between this Key Issue and Key Issue #7 (Prevention of
signalling overload in PLMNs without Disaster Condition) should be considered,
since preventing UEs from overloading a PLMN without Disaster Condition might
have an impact on which PLMN the UEs should select.
2) How the UE handles the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" when selecting a PLMN
indicating accessibility for the UE in the bullet 1).
## 5.6 Key Issue #6: Notification that Disaster Condition is no longer
applicable to the UEs
### 5.6.1 Description
According to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31.2.2:
The 3GPP system shall be able to provide efficient means for a network to
inform Disaster Inbound roamers that a Disaster Condition is no longer
applicable.
According to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31.2.3:
Disaster Inbound Roamers shall perform network reselection when a Disaster
Condition has ended.
When a UE was camping on a PLMN offering Disaster Roaming service and was
being served by the PLMN, the network can notify Disaster Inbound Roamers that
Disaster Condition is no longer applicable. When a UE is notified that
Disaster Condition is no longer applicable, the UE shall perform network
reselection in order to return to its HPLMN in non-roaming scenario, or return
to its previous registered VPLMN in roaming scenario.
The following questions are expected to be studied within this Key Issue:
\- When and how to deliver the information that Disaster Condition is no
longer applicable to Disaster Inbound Roamers;
\- How to minimize interruption of the service receiving from Disaster Roaming
PLMN (e.g. emergency service or high priority service) when the UE is notified
that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable;
\- How to remove the stored information on Disaster Condition from the UE\'s
storage; and
\- How Disaster Inbound Roamer UEs perform network selection when notified
that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable.
NOTE: The interactions between this Key Issue and the Key Issue #8 (Prevention
of signalling overload by returning UEs in PLMN previously with Disaster
Condition) need to be considered, since preventing UEs from overloading the
PLMN previously with Disaster Condition could have an impact on how the UEs
are notified that the Disaster Condition is no longer applicable.
## 5.7 Key Issue #7: Prevention of signalling overload in PLMNs without
Disaster Condition
### 5.7.1 Description
According to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31.2.1:
_Subject to regulatory requirements or operator\'s policy, 3GPP system shall
be able to enable a UE of a given PLMN to obtain connectivity service (e.g.
voice call, mobile data service) from another PLMN for the area where a
Disaster Condition applies._
This means that when a Disaster Condition applies, all UEs of the PLMN with
Disaster Condition that are located in the area where the Disaster Condition
applies will look for another PLMN in that area and attempt to register on it
to obtain service. This could cause a large number of UEs to migrate from the
PLMN with Disaster Condition to another PLMN, and attempt registration at
around the same time, leading to signalling overload in the other PLMN due to
the massive influx of roamers. Consequently, mechanisms are needed to prevent
signalling overload in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition. This is also
reflected in the following service requirement of 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause
6.31.2.3:
The 3GPP system shall minimize congestion caused by Disaster Roaming.
These mechanisms should additionally take into account the fact that a new
Accesss Identity (Access Identity 3) to be used by Disaster Inbound Roamers
was introduced in 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.22.2.2.
_Table 6.22.2.2-1: Access Identities_
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | **_Access Identity number_** | **_UE configuration_** | +==================================+==================================+ | _..._ | _..._ | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | _3_ | _UE for which Disaster Condition | | | applies (note 4)_ | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | _..._ | _..._ | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | _(...)_ | | | | | | _NOTE 4: The configuration is | | | valid for PLMNs that indicate to | | | potential Disaster Inbound | | | Roamers that the UEs can access | | | the PLMN. See clause 6.31._ | | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
The following questions are expected to be studied within this Key Issue:
\- How to distribute the subscribers of the PLMN with Disaster Condition
between the PLMNs without Disaster Condition available in the area where the
Disaster Condition applies, so as to share the load as evenly as possible
between the PLMNs without Disaster Condition;
\- How to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition,
so as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the number of UEs
attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit;
\- How to use new Access Identity 3 for the purpose of Disaster Inbound Roamer
access control and signalling overload prevention in the PLMNs without
Disaster Condition;
\- How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
Disaster Inbound Roamers from attempting registration on the PLMN when the
PLMN can no longer accept Disaster Inbound Roamers due to congestion; and
\- How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
congestion on the 5GSM level that can be caused by 5GSM signalling generated
by Disaster Inbound Roamers.
## 5.8 Key Issue #8: Prevention of signalling overload by returning UEs in
PLMN previously with Disaster Condition
### 5.8.1 Description
According to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31.2.2:
_The 3GPP system shall be able to provide efficient means for a network to
inform Disaster Inbound roamers that a Disaster Condition is no longer
applicable._
And according to 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31.2.3:
_Disaster Inbound Roamers shall perform network reselection when a Disaster
Condition has ended._
This means that when a Disaster Condition is no longer applicable, all UEs of
the PLMN that was previously with Disaster Condition which are currently
served by another PLMN and are currently in 5GMM-IDLE mode will perform PLMN
reselection and return to the PLMN that was previously with Disaster
Condition. These UEs will then attempt to register to obtain service. This
could cause a large number of UEs to migrate from PLMNs without Disaster
Condition back to the PLMN which was previously with Disaster Condition, and
attempt registration at around the same time, leading to signalling overload
in the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition due to the massive return of
UEs. Consequently, means are needed to prevent signalling overload in the PLMN
previously with Disaster Condition. This is also reflected in the following
service requirement of 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] clause 6.31.2.3:
_The 3GPP system shall minimize congestion caused by Disaster Roaming._
The following question is expected to be studied within this Key Issue:
\- How to stagger the return of UEs to the PLMN previously with Disaster
Condition, so as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the
number of UEs attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit.
## 5.9 Key Issue #9: Handling of Disaster inbound roaming PLMNs in Manual PLMN
selection
### 5.9.1 Description
When a disaster happens, NW becomes unresponsive. As a normal reaction, when a
network gets unresponsive, the user can immediately go for a manual PLMN
selection.
There can be several PLMNs available in the area. So when the PLMNs are
presented to the user, the PLMNs may be for example preferred PLMN, forbidden
PLMNs etc. In the current implementation the UE can provide an indication to
upper layers on what type of PLMN it is and the upper layers can take action
on how they can be presented to the user.
If there are only forbidden PLMNs in the area, all the PLMNs will be displayed
as forbidden PLMNs to the user which can be misleading and prevent user from
selecting any of those PLMNs.
When the disaster condition happens, user will be denied service and the
normal reaction can be to look for a the available networks and the PLMNs are
presented to the user. As per the current design the PLMNs that support
disaster roaming, which are mostly forbidden PLMNs, will be indicated as
forbidden to the users.
This gives a wrong impression to the user that the PLMN is forbidden and will
not be chosen by the user. So it is porposed to study the following items for
manual PLMN selection
\- During Manual PLMN selection, how the upper layers are informed that some
of the forbidden PLMNs support disaster roaming.
\- What additional information, if any, need to be sent to the upper layers
when the PLMNs that support disaster roaming are sent to upper layers.
\- Should the PLMN which is under disaster condition be sent to the upper
layers if it becomes available?

## 6.1 Solution #1: Indicating to the UE, via non-3GPP access, the
applicability of a disaster condition to the 3GPP access of the same PLMN
### 6.1.1 Description
#### 6.1.1.1 Introduction
This solution corresponds to KI#1 on Notification of Disaster Condition to the
UE (see clause 5.1).
The solution also addresses one of the question in KI#7 on Prevention of
signalling overload in PLMNs without Disaster Condition, in particular:
_\- \"How to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster
Condition, so as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the
number of UEs attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable
limit\"._
#### 6.1.1.2 Detailed description
This solution is for a UE:
\- that supports the non-3GPP access in addition to the 3GPP access;
\- that supports NAS over the non-3GPP access;
\- that supports connecting to N3WIF;
\- that was registered to the same PLMN over 3GPP and non-3GPP access before
(and when) the disaster condition occurred;
\- that is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over the non-3GPP access; and
\- that does not register to another PLMN over the 3GPP access while the
disaster condition is ongoing.
Also, this solution is for a PLMN with a Disaster Condition (DC) and the PLMN:
\- has N3IWF, and the AMF of the PLMN supports the N2 connection from the
N3IWF; and
\- for which the non-3GPP access network is not affected by the Disaster
Condition.
The PLMN X experiences a disaster condition that impacts the 3GPP RAN. The
serving AMF determines that a UE which is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over the
non-3GPP access is within the area of the disaster condition.
The AMF makes this determination that the UE is within the area of the
disaster condition based on the last registration area that was provided to
the UE over the 3GPP access as follows:
\- the UE is also registered to the same AMF (and PLMN) over the non-3GPP
access and the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over the non-3GPP access;
\- the AMF determines that a disaster condition has occurred, where the
disaster area is within, or overlaps with, the registration area that was last
provided to the UE over the 3GPP access; and
\- the last registration area that was provided to the UE over the 3GPP access
UE has not changed.
The AMF notifies the UE with a NAS message, e.g. Configuration Update Command
message, about a disaster condition has occurred for the 3GPP access. The AMF
may provide a list of PLMNs, optionally in a prioritized order, that the UE
can use to register on a target PLMN which does not have a disaster condition.
To avoid numerous simultaneous registration attempts on a target PLMN, the AMF
may provide a \"wait timer\" that indicates a period during which the UE
should wait before attempting to register on a target PLMN.
The AMF may also provide the UE with an \"expected duration of disaster\" that
represents a time during which the disaster is expected to last and after
which UE can attempt to return to PLMN that experienced a disaster condition
over the 3GPP access.
NOTE: it is up to the AMF to use an \"expected duration of disaster\" timer as
this timer may not always be accurate with respect to the time when the
disaster condition actually ends.
When the UE receives a notification about the disaster condition, the UE,
based on local policy, may decide to register to another PLMN (without a
disaster condition) over the 3GPP access, or transfer its PDU session(s) from
the 3GPP access to the non-3GPP access.
If the UE determines to register to a PLMN (without a disaster condition) over
the 3GPP access, the UE uses the list of PLMN, if received from the network,
to register on a target PLMN. Additionally, if a \"wait timer\" is received
from the network, the UE starts a timer based on the received \"wait timer\"
value and attempts to registers to a target PLMN (without a disaster
condition) after this timer expires. Otherwise if no \"wait timer\" was
received, the UE can immediately attempt to register on a target PLMN. If
provided with an \"expected duration of disaster\" and the the indicated time
elapses, the UE may then attempt to return (and register over the 3GPP access)
to this PLMN if it is detected.
If the UE determines to not register with another PLMN (without a disaster
condition) over the 3GPP access and decides to transfer its PDU session(s)
from the 3GPP access to the non-3GPP access, the UE intiates the PDU session
establishment procedure to transfer one or more PDU session from the 3GPP
access to the non-3GPP access. The UE may deactivate the AS layer of its 3GPP
access to save power resulting from any PLMN search on the 3GPP access.
### 6.1.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The following impacts can be identified:
\- AMF
\- Notifying the UE over the non-3GPP access about a disaster condition that
has impacted the 3GPP access
\- Optionally providing a list of target PLMNs to the UE
\- Optionally providing a \"wait timer\" to stagger UE access to a target PLMN
\- Optionally providing an \"expected duration of disaster\" representing the
time that the disaster condition is expected to remain
\- UE
\- Handle of a notification over the non-3GPP access about a disaster
condition that impacted the 3GPP access
\- Optionally handling a list of PLMNs that the UE can use for registering in
a PLMN without a disaster condition
\- Optionally handling a \"wait timer\" to guard when the UE can attempt to
register on a target PLMN without a disaster condition
\- Optionally handling an \"expected duration of disaster\" timer to decide
when to attempt to return to the PLMN that faced the disaster condition.
\- Optionally deactivating the AS layer of the 3GPP access after being
notified of a disaster condition that affects the 3GPP access.
## 6.2 Solution #2: Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE via Non-3GPP
Access
### 6.2.1 Description
#### 6.2.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses Key Issue #1: Notification of Disaster Condition to
the UE in clause 5.1.
This solution is only applicable when the UE registers to 5G system via both
3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
#### 6.2.1.2 Detailed description
It is assumed that the disaster mainly hit the 3GPP access of a specific PLMN
in a specific area. This solution provides methods to support the notification
of Disaster Condition to the UE when the UE registers to 5G system via both
3GPP access and non-3GPP access.
The UE can register in the same PLMN or different PLMNs via 3GPP access and
non-3GPP access. The UE can register to PLMN via untrusted non-3GPP access or
trusted non-3GPP access. Therefore, there are total four scenarios illustrated
as below.
**Scenario 1: UE registers in PLMN with Disaster Condition via both 3GPP
access and untrusted non-3GPP access**
Figure 6.2.1.2-1. UE registers in PLMN with Disaster Condition via both 3GPP
access and untrusted non-3GPP access
**Figure** 6.2.1.2-1 **shows that the UE registers in the PLMN with Disaster
Condition via both 3GPP access and untrusted non-3GPP access. The disaster
mainly hit the 3GPP access, therefore the UE is only registers to the PLMN
with Disaster Condition via untrusted non-3GPP access now.**
**When the PLMN with Disaster Condition notifies the UE of Disaster Condition
via non-3GPP access, it is up to the UE whether select another PLMN without
Disaster Condition via 3GPP access or just stay in the current PLMN with
Disaster Condition via non-3GPP access.**
**Scenario 2: UE registers in PLMN with Disaster Condition via both 3GPP
access and trusted non-3GPP access**
Figure 6.2.1.2-2. UE registers in PLMN with Disaster Condition via both 3GPP
access and trusted non-3GPP access
Figure 6.2.1.2-2 shows that the UE registers in the PLMN with Disaster
Condition via both 3GPP access and trusted non-3GPP access. The disaster
mainly hit the 3GPP access, therefore the UE is only registers to the PLMN
with Disaster Condition via trusted non-3GPP access now.
**When the PLMN with Disaster Condition notifies the UE of Disaster Condition
via non-3GPP access, it is up to the UE whether select another PLMN without
Disaster Condition via 3GPP access or just stay in the current PLMN with
Disaster Condition via non-3GPP access.**
**Scenario 3: UE registers in PLMN with Disaster Condition via 3GPP access and
registers in PLMN without Disaster Condition via untrusted non-3GPP access**
Figure 6.2.1.2-3. UE registers in PLMN with Disaster Condition via 3GPP access
and registers in PLMN without Disaster Condition via untrusted non-3GPP access
**Figure** 6.2.1.2-3 **shows that the UE** registers in the PLMN with Disaster
Condition via 3GPP access and registers in the PLMN without Disaster Condition
via untrusted non-3GPP access**. The disaster mainly hit the 3GPP access or
the whole PLMN with Disaster Condition,** **therefore the UE is only registers
to the PLMN without Disaster Condition via untrusted non-3GPP access now. The
PLMN with Disaster Condition and the PLMN without Disaster Condition are in
the same country.**
**When the PLMN without Disaster Condition notifies the UE of Disaster
Condition via non-3GPP access, it is up to the UE whether select one PLMN
without Disaster Condition via 3GPP access or just stay in the current PLMN
without Disaster Condition via non-3GPP access.**
**Scenario 4: UE registers in PLMN with Disaster Condition via 3GPP access and
registers in PLMN without Disaster Condition via trusted non-3GPP access**
Figure 6.2.1.2-4. UE registers in PLMN with Disaster Condition via 3GPP access
and registers in PLMN without Disaster Condition via trusted non-3GPP access
**Figure.** 6.2.1.2-4 **shows that the UE** registers in the PLMN with
Disaster Condition via 3GPP access and registers in the PLMN without Disaster
Condition via trusted non-3GPP access**. The disaster mainly hit the 3GPP
access or the whole PLMN with Disaster Condition,** **therefore the UE is only
registers to the PLMN without Disaster Condition via trusted non-3GPP access
now. The PLMN with Disaster Condition and the PLMN without Disaster Condition
are in the same country.**
**When the PLMN without Disaster Condition notifies the UE of Disaster
Condition via non-3GPP access, it is up to the UE whether select one PLMN
without Disaster Condition via 3GPP access or just stay in the current PLMN
without Disaster Condition via non-3GPP access.**
**This solution proposes four different methods to notify the UE of Disaster
Condition via non-3GPP access. The proposed methods apply for all four
scenarios illustrated above.**
**Since the PLMN with Disaster Condition knows the disaster area and the PLMN
without Disaster Condition is notified of the disaster area based on solution
to KI#2: Notification of applicability on Disaster Condition to PLMNs without
Disaster Condition, only UEs in the disaster area are notified of Disaster
Condition.**
**[Method 1: AMF notifies the UE of Disaster Condition via non-3GPP
access]{.underline}**
Figure 6.2.1.2-5. AMF notifies the UE of Disaster Condition via non-3GPP
access
**The UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access.**
**Option 1** : The AMF initiates the NAS transport procedure via non-3GPP
access by sending the DL NAS TRANSPORT message to the UE, which includes an
indication that Disaster Condition applies or the PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with
Disaster Condition, the recommended disaster roaming PLMN list, etc.
NOTE 1: Which NF or how to trigger the AMF to initiate the NAS transport
procedure is based on the solution to KI#2: Notification of applicability on
Disaster Condition to PLMNs without Disaster Condition.
**Option 2** : The AMF initiates the generic UE configuration update procedure
via non-3GPP access by sending the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message to the
UE, which includes an indication that Disaster Condition applies or the PLMN
ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition, the recommended disaster roaming
PLMN list, etc.
When the UE is registered to PLMN with Disaster Condition via non-3GPP access,
the AMF of PLMN with Disaster Condition sends an indication to the UE that
Disaster Condition applies. When the UE is registered to PLMN without Disaster
Condition via non-3GPP access, the AMF of PLMN without Disaster Condition
sends PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition to the UE.
**[Method 2: N3IWF notifies the UE of Disaster Condition via untrusted
non-3GPP access]{.underline}**

untrusted non-3GPP access
**The UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access.**
1\. The N3IWF sends INFORMATIONAL Request message to the UE. The INFORMATIONAL
Request message includes an indication that Disaster Condition applies or the
PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition, the recommended disaster
roaming PLMN list, etc.
When the UE is registered to PLMN with Disaster Condition via non-3GPP access,
the N3IWF of PLMN with Disaster Condition sends an indication to the UE that
Disaster Condition applies. When the UE is registered to PLMN without Disaster
Condition via non-3GPP access, the N3IWF of PLMN without Disaster Condition
sends PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition to the UE.
**2\. The UE sends an empty INFORMATIONAL Response message to the N3IWF to
acknowledge the reception of the message.**
**[Method 3: TNGF notifies the UE of Disaster Condition via trusted non-3GPP
access]{.underline}**
Figure 6.2.1.2-7. The TNGF notifies the UE of Disaster Condition via trusted
non-3GPP access
**The UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access.**
1\. The TNGF sends INFORMATIONAL Request message to the UE. The INFORMATIONAL
Request message includes an indication that Disaster Condition applies or the
PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition, the recommended disaster
roaming PLMN list, etc.
When the UE is registered to PLMN with Disaster Condition via non-3GPP access,
the TNGF of PLMN with Disaster Condition sends an indication to the UE that
Disaster Condition applies. When the UE is registered to PLMN without Disaster
Condition via non-3GPP access, the TNGF of PLMN without Disaster Condition
sends PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition to the UE.
**2\. The UE sends an empty INFORMATIONAL Response message to the TNGF to
acknowledge the reception of the message.**
**[Method 4: TNAP advertises Disaster Condition to the UE]{.underline}**
Figure 6.2.1.2-8. The TNAP advertises Disaster Condition to the UE
**1\. The TNAP advertises** an indication that Disaster Condition applies or
the PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition, the recommended disaster
roaming PLMN list, etc **to the UE by using the ANQP protocol.**
When the UE is registered to PLMN with Disaster Condition via non-3GPP access,
the TNAP of PLMN with Disaster Condition advertises an indication to the UE
that Disaster Condition applies. When the UE is registered to PLMN without
Disaster Condition via non-3GPP access, the TNAP of PLMN without Disaster
Condition advertises PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition to the UE.
### 6.2.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE:
\- The UE supports handling of an indication that Disaster Condition applies
or the PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition, the recommended disaster
roaming PLMN list, etc.
\- Conditionally, the UE sends INFORMATIONAL Response message to N3IWF/TNGF
which acknowledges the reception of an indication that Disaster Condition
applies or the PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition, the recommended
disaster roaming PLMN list and etc.
AMF:
\- Optionally, the AMF sends an indication that Disaster Condition applies or
the PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition, the recommended disaster
roaming PLMN list and etc to the UE using DL NAS TRANSPORT message via NAS
transport procedure.
\- Optionally, the AMF sends an indication that Disaster Condition applies or
the PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition, the recommended disaster
roaming PLMN list and etc to the UE using CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message
via generic UE configuration update procedure.
N3IWF:
\- Optionally, the N3IWF sends an indication that Disaster Condition applies
or the PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition, the recommended disaster
roaming PLMN list and etc to the UE using INFORMATIONAL Request message.
TNGF:
\- Optionally, the TNGF sends an indication that Disaster Condition applies or
the PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition, the recommended disaster
roaming PLMN list and etc to the UE using INFORMATIONAL Request message.
TNAP:
\- Optionally, the TNAP advertises an indication that Disaster Condition
applies or the PLMN ID(s) of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition, the recommended
disaster roaming PLMN list and etc to the UE using ANQP protocol.
## 6.3 Solution #3: Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE by RAN
sharing
### 6.3.1 Description
It is assumed that when a disaster condition applies, an NG-RAN node of a PLMN
without a disaster condition becomes a shared RAN node between the PLMN
without a disaster condition and a PLMN where a disaster condition applies.
See Solution #9 for the details.
With the assumption above, since the UEs which were served by the PLMN where a
disaster condition applies can register to the same PLMN through the shared
RAN without any further changes, there is no need to notify the disaster
condition to the UE. However, the UEs can recognize that a disaster condition
applies to the current PLMN from the broadcast information, e.g. the barring
information of the cell on which the UE is camping includes any information
related to Access Identity 3.
NOTE 1: It is expected that the UE and the NG-RAN will be made capable of
handling Access Identity 3 via conclusions for Key Issue #7.
NOTE 2: When a UE recognizes that a disaster condition applies to the current
PLMN from the broadcast information, the UE considers itself configured with
Access Identity 3.
### 6.3.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE
The UE recognizes that a disaster condition applies to the current PLMN from
barring information containing information related to a disaster condition
(i.e. Access Identity 3).
NG-RAN
The NG-RAN should be enhanced to broadcast barring information related to
Access Identity 3.
## 6.4 Solution #4: Disaster condition information delivered to UE via
broadcast
### 6.4.1 Introduction
This paper proposes a solution for Key Issue#1:
Key Issue #1: Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE
In this solution, PLMN D is the PLMN with Disaster Condition and PLMN A is the
PLMN without Disaster Condition.
This solution addresses how to notify Disaster Condition to the UE.
### 6.4.2 Detailed description
In this solution, it is assumed that PLMN A can obtain the Disaster Condition
information based on the solution of KI#2. PLMN A broadcasts the Disaster
Condition information in the area where the Disaster Condition applies when
Disaster Condition starts in PLMN D.
The Disaster Condition information contains the indication that Disaster
Condition applies to PLMN D, disaster area (e.g. TA list), and recommended
PLMN(s). When the Disaster Condition happens to the current PLMN, the UE will
perform the PLMN selection based on the recommended PLMN(s).
PLMN A may broadcast the Disaster Condition information by MIB, SIB1, or SIBx.
If the information are broadcasted in SIBx rather than MIB or SIB1
(Considering that the Disaster Condition happens very infrequently, and
scarcity of wireless resources), UE shall request the system information in
SIBx on demand as specified in TS 38.331[13], clause 5.2.2.3, and the timing
of requesting the Disaster Condition information in SIBx should be determined
by UE.
A UE determines to request the Disaster Condition information in SIBx if the
UE supports the MINT feature and there is no available PLMN except for PLMNs
in the \"Forbidden PLMN\" data field in the UE.
If there is no assisted information (eg. the indication that Disaster
Condition applies to PLMN D, disaster area (e.g. TA list), and recommended
PLMN(s)) used for PLMN selection when Disaster Condition applies, UE should
request randomly the system information in SIBx from the available PLMN(s)
which are in the \"Forbidden PLMN\" data field.
NOTE: Extension of broadcast signalling is subject to agreement of RAN WGs.
### 6.4.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE:
\- support for receiving the Disaster Condition information via MIB, SIB, or
SIBx;
\- determine the timing of requesting the Disaster Condition information in
SIBx on demand from the PLMN A;
RAN of PLMN A:
\- support for providing the Disaster Condition information via broadcast.
## 6.5 Solution #5
### 6.5.1 Description
#### 6.5.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses the following key issue:
Key Issue #1: Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE
#### 6.5.1.2 Detailed description
The UE determines that Disaster Condition applies for a PLMN (called PLMN D)
when:
a) there is no available cell of PLMN D and broadcast signalling received via
an available cell of another PLMN (called PLMN A) indicates that PLMN A can
accept Disaster Inbound Roamers from PLMN D.
NOTE: Extension of broadcast signalling is subject to agreement of RAN WGs.
In order to enable UE\'s determination in case a the cell of PLMN A broadcasts
that PLMN A can accept Disaster Inbound Roamers from PLMN D, based on solution
selected for key issue #3.
UE\'s determination that the Disaster Condition applies for a PLMN is used in
solutions for Key Issue #5.
### 6.5.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The UE is impacted with determination that Disaster Condition applies for a
PLMN as described in clause 6.5.1.
Whether the NG-RAN of a PLMN without Disaster Condition is impacted with
additional broadcast of indication that the PLMN without Disaster Condition
can accept Disaster Inbound Roamers from a PLMN with Disaster Condition,
depends on solution selected for key issue #3.
NOTE: If the indication that the PLMN without Disaster Condition can accept
Disaster Inbound Roamers from a PLMN with Disaster Condition, is provided as
part of a PWS message, the broadcast in the RAN of the PLMN without Disaster
Condition can be done using existing PWS mechanisms.
## 6.6 Solution #6: O&M-based solution for Key Issue #2
### 6.6.1 Introduction
This solution addresses Key Issue #2: Notification of applicability on
Disaster Condition to PLMNs without Disaster Condition in clause 5.2.
### 6.6.2 Solution description
The Disaster Condition caused RAN unavailability can be treated as a network
fault. As per 3GPP TS 32.101 [5] for defining the legacy PLMN management
functional architecture, the fault management is a basic management function
provided by the PLMN NMS.
Furthermore, as per 3GPP TS 28.533 [6] for the SBA based NMS defined for 5GS,
the network fault supervision service is also a basic management service
provided by the PLMN NMS for the management of the 3GPP network.
The PLMN NMS can directly interface with different network elements within
3GPP network, including core network functions (e.g. AMF, SMF) and RAN nodes
(e.g. gNB) via O&M operations. The required O&M operations may or may not be
standardized, i.e. to use the proprietary implementation.
The O&M-based solution for each question within Key Issue #2 is described as
below:
_\"- How to deliver the information on the Disaster Condition to the PLMNs
without Disaster Condition;\"_
When the Disaster Condition applies to the UE\'s current seving PLMN, the
Disaster Condition can be detected by serving PLMN NMS automatically or
artificially. The serving PLMN NMS collects and stores the disaster PLMN ID
(i.e. the current serving PLMN ID) and disaster area information. Hereafter,
the serving PLMN NMS sends the disaster PLMN ID and disaster area information
to other PLMN NMS without Disaster Condition which can provide the disaster
roaming for the UE. The PLMN without Disaster Condition which can provide the
disaster roaming for the UE is called Disaster Roaming PLMN and used
hereafter. The Disaster Roaming PLMN NMS stores the received disaster PLMN ID
and disaster area information and sends them to its core network functions
(e.g. AMF) and RAN nodes (e.g. gNBs) based on the disaster area information,
i.e. the core network functions and RAN nodes have overlapped serving area
with the disaster area information.
NOTE: The communication between serving PLMN NMS and Disaster Roaming PLMN
NMS, between Disaster Roaming PLMN NMS and Disaster Roaming PLMN core network
functions and RAN nodes are implementation specific, e.g. via O&M operations.
_\"- Who or which entity decides the Disaster Condition;\"_
It is serving PLMN NMS to decide the Disaster Condition based on regulatory
requirements or operator policy of the serving PLMN (i.e. the PLMN with
Disaster Condition).
_\"- How to provide information on the area where Disaster Condition
applies.\"_
The serving PLMN NMS collects the disaster area information where Disaster
Condition applies. The PLMN NMS can know this disaster area information based
on O&M operations, e.g. by counting the number of fault gNBs due to Disaster
Condition and then collecting the TAs corresponding their coverage area.
The end-to-end flow of O&M-based solution for KI#2 can be shown in Figure
6.6.2:
Figure 6.6.2: End-to-end flow of O&M-based solution for KI#2
### 6.6.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
There is no impact on the UE.
NG-RAN of PLMN without Disaster Condition: To receive and store the disaster
PLMN ID and disaster area information sent by the PLMN NMS via O&M operations.
AMF of PLMN without Disaster Condition: To receive and store the disaster PLMN
ID and disaster area information sent by the PLMN NMS via O&M operations.
There are impacts on PLMN NMS but the required O&M operations may not to be
standardized, i.e. by proprietary implementation.
## 6.7 Solution #7
### 6.7.1 Description
#### 6.7.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses the following key issue:
Key Issue #2: Notification of applicability on Disaster Condition to PLMNs
without Disaster Condition
This solution enables a PLMN (called PLMN A) without Disaster Condition to
determine that Disaster Condition applies (or no longer applies) for another
PLMN (called PLMN D) in an area, based on means out-of-scope of 3GPP.
PLMN A and PLMN D are in the same country.
#### 6.7.1.2 Detailed description
A PLMN (called PLMN A) without Disaster Condition which is in the same country
as another PLMN (called PLMN D), is informed that Disaster Condition applies
(or no longer applies) for PLMN D in an area based on means out-of-scope of
3GPP.
The decision on applicability (or applicability no longer) of the Disaster
Condition for PLMN D is made by PLMN D, based on regulatory requirements or
operator policy of PLMN D.
If PLMN A is informed that Disaster Condition applies for PLMN D in an area
and PLMN A is able to accept Disaster Inbound Roamers from PLMN D in the area,
then PLMN A adds using O&M the PLMN ID of PLMN D into the \"disaster roaming
PLMN list\" configured in PLMN A\'s NG-RAN nodes serving the area.
If PLMN A is informed that Disaster Condition no longer applies for PLMN D in
an area, then PLMN A removes using O&M the PLMN ID of PLMN D from the
\"disaster roaming PLMN list\" configured in PLMN A\'s NG-RAN nodes serving
the area.
### 6.7.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The NG-RAN of the PLMN without Disaster Condition is impacted with possibility
to be configured with the \"disaster roaming PLMN list as described in clause
6.7.1.
There are impacts on PLMN NMS but the required O&M operations may not to be
standardized, i.e. by proprietary implementation.
## 6.8 Solution #8
### 6.8.1 Description
#### 6.8.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses the following key issue:
Key Issue #2: Notification of applicability on Disaster Condition to PLMNs
without Disaster Condition
This solution enables a PLMN (called PLMN A) without Disaster Condition to
determine that Disaster Condition applies (or no longer applies) for another
PLMN (called PLMN D) in an area, based on information received from the CBE
(Cell Broadcast Entity). The CBE could be a CBE that is operated under
responsibility of the regulator.
PLMN A and PLMN D are in the same country.
This solution requires deployment of CBE and CBC (and PWS-IWF) or CBCF.
#### 6.8.1.2 Detailed description
When PLMN D detects service interruptions and failures in PLMN D caused by a
disaster, PLMN D informs the CBE using means out of scope of 3GPP.
If the CBE decides subject to regulatory requirements that the Disaster
Condition applies for PLMN D and that UEs of PLMN D can use disaster roaming
in another PLMN (called PLMN A) in the area, the CBE provides the CBC or the
CBCF of PLMN A with a message (e.g. Disaster Roaming Command) with (updated)
\"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\" containing PLMN D and the area. If the
CBE provided a \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\" previously, the CBE
also indicates the previous \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\" in the
same message.
Upon receiving the message:
\- if PLMN A is able to provide disaster roaming to UEs of PLMN D in the area
as indicated in the (updated) \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\", the CBC
or the CBCF of PLMN A informs the CBE accordingly (e.g. by sending Disaster
Roaming Command Ack) and provides the (updated) \"disaster roaming PLMN and
area list\" to the AMF(s) of PLMN A which serve at least part of an area in
the (updated) \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\" or the previous
\"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\", if received; or
\- if PLMN A is unable to provide disaster roaming to UEs of PLMN D in the
area as indicated in the (updated) \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\",
the CBC or the CBCF of PLMN A informs the CBE accordingly (e.g. by sending
Disaster Roaming Command Reject).
When an AMF of PLMN A receives the \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\"
from the CBC (via the PWS-IWF) or the CBCF, the AMF removes the stored
\"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\", if any, and if the AMF serves at
least part of an area of the \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\" provided
by the CBC (via the PWS-IWF) or the CBCF, the AMF stores the \"disaster
roaming PLMN and area list\".
When PLMN D resolves the service interruptions and failures in PLMN D caused
by the disaster, PLMN D informs the CBE using means out of scope of 3GPP. If
the CBE decides subject to regulatory requirements that the Disaster Condition
no longer applies for PLMN D, the CBE provides the CBC or the CBCF with a
message with an updated \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\" not containing
PLMN D and the area, and the previous \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\".
Upon receiving the message, the CBC (via the PWS-IWF) or the CBCF provides the
updated \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\" to the AMF(s) of PLMN A which
serve at least part of an area in the updated \"disaster roaming PLMN and area
list\" or the previous \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\".
When the AMF receives the \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\" from the CBC
(via the PWS-IWF) or the CBCF, the AMF removes the stored \"disaster roaming
PLMN and area list\", if any, and if the AMF serves at least part of an area
of the \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\" provided by the CBC (via the
PWS-IWF) or the CBCF, the AMF stores the \"disaster roaming PLMN and area
list\".
Example flow can be found in figure 6.8.1.2-1.
Figure 6.8.1.2-1: CBE informing PLMN A without Disaster Condition with
deployed CBCF that UEs of PLMN D with Disaster Condition can use disaster
roaming in PLMN A
### 6.8.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The CBE is impacted with sending to the CBC or the CBCF a message (e.g.
Disaster Roaming Command) with (updated) \"disaster roaming PLMN and area
list\" and conditionally also the previous \"disaster roaming PLMN and area
list\", as described in clause 6.8.1.
The CBC (and the PWS-IWF) or the CBCF are impacted with sending to impacted
AMF(s) a message (e.g. Disaster Roaming Command) with (updated) \"disaster
roaming PLMN and area list\" and conditionally also the previous \"disaster
roaming PLMN and area list\", upon reception of the same from the CBE, as
described in clause 6.8.1, and with providing CBE with rejection (e.g.
Disaster Roaming Command Reject).
The AMF is impacted with managing the stored \"disaster roaming PLMN and area
list\", upon reception of the \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\" from the
CBC (via the PWS-IWF) or CBCF, as described in clause 6.8.1.
## 6.9 Solution #9: Notification of applicability on Disaster Condition to
PLMNs without Disaster Condition by RAN sharing
### 6.9.1 Description
When a government decides to initiate a disaster condition in an area for a
PLMN (PLMN~DC~), an AMF of PLMN~DC~ is informed that a disaster condition
applies to PLMN~DC~ associated with information on the disaster area.
NOTE 1: How the AMF of PLMN~DC~ is informed by the government, is out of the
scope of 3GPP.
After being informed, the AMF of PLMN~DC~ notifies to NG-RAN nodes of a PLMN
without disaster condition (PLMN~NO\ DC~) in the disaster area.
When a government decides to terminate a disaster condition, the AMF of
PLMN~DC~ is informed that a disaster condition no longer applies.
NOTE 2: How the AMF of PLMN~DC~ is informed by the government, is out of the
scope of 3GPP.
After being informed, the AMF of PLMN~DC~ notifies to the NG-RAN nodes of
PLMN~NO\ DC~ that a disaster condition no longer applies.
In order to be able to exchange an NGAP message when a disaster condition
applies or no longer applies, if PLMN~NO\ DC~ has an SLA to support disaster
condition applied to PLMN~DC~ in an area, the NG Setup procedure is performed
between all NG-RAN nodes of PLMN~NO\ DC~ covering the area and AMF(s) of
PLMN~DC~ covering the area in advance. Neither the AMFs nor the NG-RAN nodes
shall use the established N2 connection until a disaster condition applies.
### 6.9.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
NG-RAN
\- After the NG Setup with an AMF of a different PLMN, the NG-RAN node shall
not use the N2 connection until being notified, by the AMF, that a disaster
condition applies.
\- The NG-RAN needs to be able to interpret the notification in NGAP that a
disaster condition (no longer) applies.
AMF
\- After the NG Setup with an NG-RAN node of a different PLMN, the AMF shall
not use the N2 connection until a disaster condition applies.
\- The AMF needs to be able to send the notification in NGAP that a disaster
condition (no longer) applies.
## 6.10 Solution #10: Indication of accessibility from other PLMNs without
Disaster Condition to the UE by RAN sharing
It is assumed that when a disaster condition applies, an NG-RAN node of a PLMN
without a disaster condition becomes a shared RAN node between the PLMN
without a disaster condition and a PLMN where a disaster condition applies.
See Solution #9 for the details.
NOTE: The shared RAN node does not broadcast the same information which had
been broadcast by the NG-RAN node of a PLMN with a disaster condition. As a
result, several features such as CAG are not supported.
With the assumption above, since the UEs which were served by the PLMN where a
disaster condition applies can register to the same PLMN through the shared
RAN without any further changes, there is no need to newly indicate
accessibility. In this case, the broadcast information from the shared RAN
serves as an indication that the UE can access the cell.
### 6.10.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
NG-RAN
Because the NG-RAN node is shared to a PLMN to which a disaster condition
applies, there is a restriction in the number of networks that can be share
the NG-RAN node.
NOTE: The maximum number of networks (i.e. PLMNs and NPNs) broadcast by a cell
is 12 and 6 for an NR cell and an E-UTRA cell, respectively. For example, if a
gNB is shared to three other PLMNs for handling of disaster condition
according to Solution #9, the gNB can be shared to eight other networks.
## 6.11 Solution #11: DRS-supported PLMN list
### 6.11.1 Introduction
This is a solution for Key Issue#3, the principles are as follows:
Key Issue #3: Indication of accessibility from other PLMNs without Disaster
Condition to the UE.
The basic idea of this solution is to configure UE with a Disaster Roaming
Service (DRS)-supported PLMN list, the PLMN in the DRS-supported PLMN list is
able to provide the Disaster Condition roaming service for the UE from the
PLMN with Disaster Condition when the Disaster Condition happens.
### 6.11.2 Detailed description
For convenience on description, PLMN D is the PLMN with Disaster Condition and
PLMN A is the PLMN without Disaster Condition.
To make this solution work, a DRS-supported PLMN list is proposed to be
configured in the UE by the PLMN D before the Disaster Condition happens. The
PLMN in the DRS-Supported PLMN list does not have the roaming agreements with
the PLMN D but is able to provide the Disaster Condition roaming service for
the UE when the Disaster Condition happens to PLMN D.
The determination of the DRS-Supported PLMN list can be based on:
\- the indication of accessibility to Disaster Inbound Roamers from the PLMNs
without Disaster Condition before Disaster Condition happens; or
\- the agreements between PLMNs on the Disaster Condition handling.
The PLMN D can include the DRS-supported PLMN list in the following message
before the Disaster Condition happens:
\- REGISTRATION ACCEPT message; or
\- CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message.
NOTE: The DRS-supported PLMN list may be provided by the PLMN D to the UE over
non-3GPP access if any before the Disaster Condition happens.
The UE determines that PLMN A can accept \"Disaster Inbound Roamers\" from
PLMN D if:
a) PLMN A is in the DRS-supported PLMN list; and
b) PLMN A\'s NG-RAN cell broadcasts \"disaster roaming PLMN list\" including
PLMN ID of PLMN D (as defined in solution#13)
### 6.11.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE:
\- support for receiving DRS-supported PLMN list; and
\- support for determining the accessibility of other PLMNs without Disaster
Condition based on DRS-supported PLMN list.
UDM of HPLMN:
\- support for providing DRS-supported PLMN list.
AMF of registered PLMN (with Disaster Condition):
\- support for providing DRS-supported PLMN list.
## 6.12 Solution #12: Broadcast of disaster roaming indication
This solution addresses the Key Issue #3 \"Indication of accessibility from
other PLMNs without Disaster Condition to the UE\".
### 6.12.1 Detailed description
In the description, PLMN D is subject to **[d]{.underline}** isaster and PLMN
A is **[a]{.underline}** live and not subject to disaster.
PLMN A is informed of the disaster condition in PLMN D through any of the
solutions for Key Issue #2. Once the PLMN A is prepared to accept inbound
roamers from PLMN D, PLMN A shall update its broadcast information (System
Information) to include an indication of \"disaster roaming active\"
condition.
The design of the broadcast information shall take into account the following
requirements:
1\. During the PLMN search, a UE\'s first evaluation of suitability is based
on the PLMN ID broadcast by the cell. If the PLMN ID is present in the list of
forbiddden PLMNs or 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming, the UE will not
read further system information from the cell and will consider the cell as
not suitable. Hence an indication that a PLMN is providing disaster inbound
roaming has to be included along with its PLMN ID information.
2\. A UE that is a subscriber of PLMN B (another PLMN in the same area, but
not subject to disaster) may also be performing a PLMN search due to a loss of
coverage. In this case if the UE finds no cell of PLMN B but a cell of PLMN A
which is broadcasting the \"disaster roaming active\" condition, this may lead
to the UE assuming that PLMN B is experiencing a disaster condition. To avoid
this ambiguity, it is necessary to include in the broadcast information the
PLMN ID or a list of PLMN IDs that are subject to the disaster. This
information may be broadcast along with the indication of \"disaster roaming
active\" condition or in a separate System Information.
3\. The SIB1 message is size constrained. Adding another list of PLMN IDs may
not be scalable in some deployments (e.g., if there is already a high number
of network sharing PLMNs). It is prefereable to have a new system information
with PLMN IDs subject to disaster. This will also avoid impacts to PLMN A\'s
own subscribers, who need not acquire this new information.
4\. Broadcasting the \"disaster roaming active condition\" in SIB1 and not
broadcasting in SIB X additional PLMN IDs for which disaster roaming is active
indicates that disaster roaming is allowed for UEs from any PLMN. This is
useful for the case where all PLMNs in the area, except PLMN A, are facing
disaster condition.
#### 6.12.1.1 Broadcast Indication of Disaster Roaming condition
The PLMN A shall broadcast an indication that it is accepting UEs due to a
disaster condition. The \"disaster roaming active\" condition is indicated as
a single bit optional element in the _SIB1 of the cell._
_The PLMN A shall broadcast the list of PLMN IDs which are not operational due
to a disaster situation and whose subscribers or roaming UEs are allowed to
attempt to roam into PLMN A. This information is broadcast in a new SIB type._
NOTE: Introduction of new information in SIB1, introduction of new SIB type
and split of information between SIB1 and new SIB is subject to RAN2
agreement.
### 6.12.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
_NG-RAN: new fields in SIB1, new SIB X_
_UE: Cell selection and PLMN selection criteria_
## 6.13 Solution #13
### 6.13.1 Description
#### 6.13.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses the following key issue:
Key Issue #3: Indication of accessibility from other PLMNs without Disaster
Condition to the UE
This solution is based on a cell of a PLMN without Disaster Condition
broadcasting \"disaster roaming PLMN list\" indicating one or more PLMNs with
Disaster Condition for which the PLMN without Disaster Condition is able to
provide disaster roaming.
#### 6.13.1.2 Detailed description
When a PLMN without Disaster Condition (called PLMN A) is informed that
Disaster Condition applies for another PLMN (called PLMN D) in an area and
PLMN A is able to accept Disaster Inbound Roamers from PLMN D in the area,
then PLMN A configures PLMN A\'s NG-RAN cells serving the area to broadcast
\"disaster roaming PLMN list\" including PLMN ID of PLMN D.
NOTE 1: Extension of broadcast signalling is subject to agreement of RAN WGs.
Depending on solution selected for Key Issue #2, PLMN A\'s NG-RAN cells are
configured for broadcasting \"disaster roaming PLMN list\" using O&M or by the
AMFs of PLMN A.
A UE determines that PLMN A without Disaster Condition can accept Disaster
Inbound Roamers from PLMN D with Disaster Condition if:
a) PLMN A\'s NG-RAN cell broadcasts \"disaster roaming PLMN list\" including
PLMN ID of PLMN D;
b) PLMN A is in UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs; and
NOTE 2: If PLMN A is not in UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs, there is no need to
determine that PLMN A can accept Disaster Inbound Roamers from PLMN D - the UE
can select PLMN A and register in PLMN A using the legacy principles.
c) PLMN D is HPLMN of the UE or is not in UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs.
UE\'s determination that PLMN A without Disaster Condition can accept Disaster
Inbound Roamers from PLMN D with Disaster Condition is used in solutions for
Key Issue #5.
### 6.13.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The UE is impacted with determination that the PLMN without Disaster Condition
can accept Disaster Inbound Roamers from the PLMN with Disaster Condition as
described in clause 6.13.1.
The NG-RAN of the PLMN without Disaster Condition is impacted with additional
broadcast of \"disaster roaming PLMN list as described in clause 6.13.1.
Whether the AMF of the PLMN without Disaster Condition is impacted with
configuring NG-RAN of the PLMN without Disaster Condition to broadcast
\"disaster roaming PLMN list\" depends on solution selected for Key Issue #2.
NOTE: If the NG-RAN of the PLMN without Disaster Condition is configured using
O&M, the AMFs of the PLMN without Disaster Condition are not impacted.
## 6.14 Solution #14
### 6.14.1 Description
#### 6.14.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses the following key issue:
Key Issue #3: Indication of accessibility from other PLMNs without Disaster
Condition to the UE
This solution is based on a cell of a PLMN without Disaster Condition
broadcasting a PWS message containing \"disaster roaming PLMN list\"
indicating one or more PLMNs with Disaster Condition for which the PLMN
without Disaster Condition is able to provide disaster roaming.
This solution requires deployment of PWS.
#### 6.14.1.2 Detailed description
When CBE is informed that Disaster Condition applies for a PLMN (called PLMN
D) in an area and decides that a PLMN (called PLMN A) without Disaster
Condition is to serve Disaster Inbound Roamers from PLMN D in the area and
PLMN A is able to provide disaster roaming to UEs of PLMN D in the area, the
CBE will trigger the CBCF/PWS-IWF to broadcast a PWS message in PLMN A. The
PWS message will be composed as follows:
a) the Message Identifier is set to a newly reserved disaster-roaming-possible
value; and
b) the content of the PWS message contains the \"disaster roaming PLMN list\",
including PLMN ID of PLMN D.
A UE determines that PLMN A without Disaster Condition can accept Disaster
Inbound Roamers from PLMN D with Disaster Condition if:
a) the UE receives a PWS message via PLMN A\'s NG-RAN cell and:
1) the Message Identifier of the PWS message is set to the disaster-roaming-
possible value; and
2) the content of the PWS message contains the \"disaster roaming PLMN list\"
including PLMN ID of PLMN D; and
b) PLMN A is in UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs; and
NOTE: If PLMN A is not in UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs, there is no need to
determine that PLMN A can accept Disaster Inbound Roamers from PLMN D - the UE
can select PLMN A and register in PLMN A using the legacy principles.
c) PLMN D is HPLMN of the UE or is not in UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs.
### 6.14.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The UE is impacted with determination that the PLMN without Disaster Condition
can accept Disaster Inbound Roamers from the PLMN with Disaster Condition as
described in clause 6.14.1.
The CBE is impacted with composition of a PWS message of a particular Message
Identifier and a particular content as described in clause 6.14.1.
NOTE: The CBCF/PWS-IWF, the AMF and the NG-RAN of the PLMN without Disaster
Condition are not impacted as the PWS message is transported to the UE using
existing PWS mechanisms.
## 6.15 Solution #15: List if PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition
### 6.15.1 General
The solution aims to solve the below study items in key issue #3
\- Which PLMN(s) are responsible for indicating their accesibility to Disaster
Inbound Roamers;
\- How other PLMN(s) than the PLMN with Disaster Condition indicate that they
can accommodate Disaster Inbound Roamer; and
\- What information can be provided to potential Disaster Inbound Roamers.
UE is provided with \"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\".
The list can be configured in the USIM or stored in the ME. List can also be
dynamically updated via NAS signalling ( e.g when the UE is not in home
country).
### 6.15.2 Solution description
When a disaster happens, the serving PLMN get unresponsive and so it is good
to prepare the UE for disaster even before the disaster happens. So it is
always better to provide the UE with the information that it can use to
minimize the service interruption before the disaster happens in the form of a
\"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\". In reality the
\"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\" will contain the
forbidden PLMNs which are forbidden in normal scenarios.
NOTE 1: It is FFS on how many PLMNs can be configured in the \"List of PLMNs
to be used while in Disaster condition\" .
The list can be
a) Stored in the SIM card
b) Stored in the Non Volatile memory of the ME
c) Provided by NAS signalling messages.
Serving PLMN (HPLMN in most cases) can arrange the PLMNs in \"List of PLMNs to
be used while in Disaster condition\" in the particular order so as to direct
the UE to different PLMNs to avoid the overload on the network. In addition to
the PLMN IDs of the PLMN, there can be a timer associated which indicates a
\'minimum wait time\' that the UE should wait to perform registration on the
PLMN following a disaster condition.
The PLMNs that support disaster inbound roamers may indicate in the system
information if they supports disaster inbound roaming.
NOTE 2: It is up to RAN2 to decide how the PLMN that supports disaster inbound
roaming is indicated in the system information block.
If the UE gets an indication from a PLMN that it supports disaster inbound
roaming and if the PLMN is also present in the \"List of PLMNs to be used
while in Disaster condition\", then the UE can consider the PLMN for disaster
inbound roaming.
### 6.15.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
A new PLMN list is provided to the UE which is either pre-configured or
provisioned via NAS signalling.
\- UE needs to handle a new list which is \"List of PLMNs to be used while in
Disaster condition\".
\- AMF needs to provide the UE with a new list which is \"List of PLMNs to be
used while in Disaster condition\"
\- RAN needs to inform the UE whether it can accept inbound roamers.
## 6.16 Solution #16: Solution for indication of accessibility from other
PLMNs without Disaster Condition to the UE and for prevention of signalling
overload in PLMNs without Disaster Condition using Access Identities
### 6.16.1 Introduction
This is a solution for Key Issue #3 (Indication of accessibility from other
PLMNs without Disaster Condition to the UE) and Key Issue #7 (Prevention of
signalling overload in PLMNs without Disaster Condition).
The solution addresses all questions under Key Issue #3, as well as the first
and third questions to be studied under Key Issue #7, namely:
\- How to distribute the subscribers of the PLMN with Disaster Condition
between the PLMNs without Disaster Condition available in the area where the
Disaster Condition applies, so as to share the load as evenly as possible
between the PLMNs without Disaster Condition; and
\- How to use new Access Identity 3 for the purpose of Disaster Inbound Roamer
access control and signalling overload prevention in the PLMNs without
Disaster Condition.
### 6.16.2 Detailed description
The UE can be provisioned with one or more Access Identities allocated for
disaster roaming.
The Access Identities allocated for disaster roaming can be:
a) pre-configured in the ME;
b) pre-configured in the USIM;
c) sent to the UE by the network using the UE parameters update procedure
(before a Disaster Condition applies); or
d) sent to the UE by the network using the steering of roaming procedure
(before a Disaster Condition applies).
NOTE 1: The use of Access Identities other than Access Identity 3 for disaster
roaming is subject to SA1 agreement.
Only the Access identities allocated for disaster roaming provisioned by the
network are used by the UE, if both Access identities allocated for disaster
roaming provisioned by the network and pre-configured Access identities
allocated for disaster roaming are present. If no Access identities allocated
for disaster roaming are provisioned by the network, and the UE has pre-
configured Access identities allocated for disaster roaming in both the USIM
and the ME, then only the pre-configured Access identities allocated for
disaster roaming in the USIM are used.
Upon being notified that a Disaster Condition applies to the registered PLMN,
the UE shall determine which Access Identity it shall use when performing an
access attempt in a PLMN offering disaster roaming by applying a hash function
to its IMSI.
NOTE 2: The output of the hash function maps to one of the Access Identities
allocated for disaster roaming.
Upon being notified that a Disaster Condition applies, the PLMNs without
Disaster Condition shall set the bit in the _uac-BarringForAccessIdentity_
contained in \"UAC barring parameter\" in SIB for one or more of the Access
Identities allocated for disaster roaming to zero.
NOTE 3: For which Access Identities a PLMN without Disaster Condition sets the
bit to zero in the _uac-BarringForAccessIdentity_ contained in \"UAC barring
parameter\" in SIB is up to operator policy and roaming agreements. How many
bits the PLMN sets to zero can be commensurate to the capacity of the PLMN to
accommodate Disaster Inbound roamers.
NOTE 4: An NG-RAN node can adjust the rate at which access attempts of
Disaster Inbound Roamers are allowed during the access barring check with a
granularity which depends on the number of Access Identities allocated for
disaster roaming, e.g. if 4 Access Identities are allocated, the rate can be
set with a granularity of 25%.
NOTE 5: The use of the bitmap in _uac-BarringForAccessIdentity_ to indicate
accessibility to the Disaster Inbound Roamers deviates from the existing
semantic of uac-BarringForAccessIdentity and is subject to RAN2 agreement.
When performing disaster roaming PLMN selection, the UE shall not consider the
PLMNs which have not set the bit in the _uac-BarringForAccessIdentity_
contained in \"UAC barring parameter\" in SIB for the Access Identity which
the UE has determined to use to zero as PLMN selection candidates. If after
completing the procedure, the UE was unable to successfully register on a
PLMN, the UE shall randomly select a PLMN among the available PLMNs which have
set a bit to zero in the _uac-BarringForAccessIdentity_ contained in \"UAC
barring parameter\" in SIB for an Access Identity allocated for disaster
roaming different from the Access Identity which the UE has determined to use.
### 6.16.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE
\- support for handling of Access Identities allocated for disaster roaming.
UDM of HPLMN
\- optionally, support for providing Access Identities allocated for disaster
roaming.
AMF of registered PLMN (with Disaster Condition)
\- optionally, support for providing Access Identities allocated for disaster
roaming.
RAN of PLMNs indicating that they can accept Disaster Inbound Roamers:
\- support for determining for which Access Identities to set the bit to zero
in the _uac-BarringForAccessIdentity_ contained in \"UAC barring parameter\"
in SIB.
## 6.17 Solution #17: Confining the service area of an inbound disaster
roaming UE to the area of the disaster condition
### 6.17.1 Description
#### 6.17.1.1 Introduction
This solution corresponds to KI#4 on Registration to the roaming PLMN without
Disaster Condition in case of Disaster Condition (see clause 5.1), however the
solution is specific to the following aspect of KI#4:
\- _\"How a Disaster Roaming PLMN can limit the area of service to Inbound
Disaster Roamers to the region where Disaster Condition applies\"_.
This solution also corresponds to KI#6 and in particular the following aspects
of KI#6:
_\- When and how to deliver the information that Disaster Condition is no
longer applicable to Disaster Inbound Roamers;_
_\- How Disaster Inbound Roamer UEs perform network selection when notified
that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable._
#### 6.17.1.2 Detailed description
This solution assumes that the AMF in the PLMN without a disaster condition
knows the area of the disaster condition of the PLMN with the disaster
condition. For example, this can be based on the solution for KI#2 and in
particular on the solution for \"_How to provide information on the area where
Disaster Condition applies_ \".
When an inbound disaster roaming UE registers onto a PLMN without a disaster
condition, the serving AMF may determine a registration area for the UE such
that the 5GS tracking area list contains only those tracking area identities
(TAIs) that overlap with the known area of the disaster condition.
The AMF also sends the Service area list IE to the UE such that the TAIs in
the service area list are set to \"allowed tracking areas\" and shall only
contain the TAIs of the PLMN that overlap with the known area of the disaster
condition.
NOTE 1: how the AMF makes the determination of its TAIs which map to the area
of disaster condition of another PLMN is implementation specific.
To enable a finer control of the area where the inbound disaster roaming UE
can have service such that the area overlaps with the area of the disaster
condition, the AMF may provide a list of cell identities to the UE. This list
represents the list of (identifies of the) cell(s) that overlap with the area
of the disaster condition and on which the UE can get normal service.
Otherwise the UE will not get normal service if the UE is camped on any cell
for which the cell identity is not part of this list.
NOTE 2: how the AMF makes the determination of which cells map to the area of
disaster condition of another PLMN is implementation specific.
The UE may receive a list of cell identities from the AMF.
NOTE 3: the list of cell identities that is received from the AMF is not
provided by the NAS to the AS layer in the UE.
When the UE receives a list of cell identities from the AMF, the NAS in the UE
also receives the cell identity of the cell on which the UE is currently
camped from the AS layer in the UE.
NOTE 4: the NAS receives the cell identity of the cell on which the UE is
camped on from the AS layer in the UE using implementation specific means.
The UE verifies if the cell identity that is received from the AS layer is
part of the list of cell identities that was received from the AMF. If yes,
the UE remains in state 5GMM-REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE. Otherwise, if the
identity of the cell on which the UE is camped is not part of the received
list, the UE determines that it cannot get normal service and enters 5GMM-
REGISTERED.NON-ALLOWED-SERVICE state, and upon entering the 5GMM-
REGISTERED.NON-ALLOWED-SERVICE state and the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the UE
may trigger PLMN search to search for higher priority PLMN.
### 6.17.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The following impacts can be identified:
\- AMF
\- Optionally setting the 5GS tracking area list such that the contained TAIs
are only those that overlap with the known area of the disaster condition of
another PLMN
\- Providing a service area list to the UE such that it contains only those
TAIs that overlap with the known area of the disaster condition of another
PLMN
\- Optionally providing a list of cell identities represeting the cells on
which the UE can get normal service.
\- UE
\- Optionally handling a list of cell identities and entering 5GMM-
REGISTERED.NON-ALLOWED-SERVICE state if the UE camps on a cell for which the
cell identity is not part of this list as described in 6.17.1.2
\- Optionally triggering PLMN search upon entering the 5GMM-REGISTERED.NON-
ALLOWED-SERVICE state.
## 6.18 Solution #18: Registration to the roaming PLMN without Disaster
Condition in case of Disaster Condition via shared RAN
### 6.18.1 Description
It is assumed that when a disaster condition applies, an NG-RAN node of a PLMN
without a disaster condition becomes a shared RAN node between the PLMN
without a disaster condition and a PLMN where a disaster condition applies.
See Solution #9 for the details.
The UE can perform the registration procedure to the same PLMN using currently
available means via the shared RAN and the 5GCN of the PLMN where a disaster
condition applies. The area covered by the shared RAN can correspond to one or
more presence reporting areas (PRAs). The PRA IDs assigned to the PRAs are
preconfigured in the CHF, AMF, and PCF.
### 6.18.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
NG-RAN
NG-RAN nodes in a PLMN without a disaster condition having N2 connection with
AMF in a PLMN with disaster condition needs to support N3 connection with UPF
in a PLMN with disaster condition.
UPF
UPF in a PLMN with disaster condition needs to support N3 connection with NG-
RAN nodes in a PLMN without a disaster condition having N2 connection with AMF
in a PLMN with disaster condition.
## 6.19 Solution #19
### 6.19.1 General
This a solution for the below study items listed in key issue #4
\- How to authenticate Inbound Disaster Roamer during the registration
procedure;
\- How a Disaster Roaming PLMN can limit the area of service to Inbound
Disaster Roamers to the region where Disaster Condition applies; and
When the UE has roamed into a PLMN that supports disaster roaming, it is
important to consider that the PLMN is forbidden in normal scenarios and the
UE would have been rejected by the network.
So it is important to let the Network know that the registration request is
because of a disaster condition and not in any normal scenario because of the
following 2 reason
a) A genuine UE that is performing disaster roaming can be accepted.
b) A UE that is not doing disaster roaming, but attempts registration on that
PLMN needs to be rejected.
Also the disaster condition can be applicable only to a small region. So it is
important to restrict the UE to that region for disaster roaming.
### 6.19.2 Solution description
To solve the problem the UE needs to differentiate the registration request
due to disaster roaming and a normal registration request. So The UE needs to
use a new registration request type in the registration request message. This
will help the visiting NW to identify that the UE is performing a registration
followed by disaster condition. On receiving the new registration request type
in registration request message indicating \'disaster roaming\', AMF of the
visiting NW after verifying that the UE is coming from a disaster area (e.g
based on the TA where the UE is located) shall send an indication to the AUSF
of the HPLMN in the primary authentication that the registration is due to
disaster roaming. AUSF may authenticate the UE using this information. If the
Authentication is successful, the NW may accept the registration request from
such a UE if the network supports disaster roaming in that area from the
previously served PLMN of the UE. .
\- The registration type is used by the UE only if it has detected a disaster
condition and needs to move away from the serving PLMN.
NOTE: PLMN that supports disaster roaming can accept the registration request
from the UE if the UE indicates that it is performing registration request due
to a disaster condition and if the PLMN supports disaster roaming from the
previously served PLMN of that UE in that area.
\- Visiting NW can also assign the tracking areal list (TAI list) based on the
area where the disaster has happened. This also has the advantage that the UE
will perform a mobility and registration update procedure as soon as UE moves
out of the area.
### 6.19.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
A new registration type value will be used the UE so that the network needs to
treat the registration as a registration due to disaster condition. Also the
allocation of service area list and registration area list may also be
impacted.
\- UE needs to use a new registration type to indicate that it is performing
registration due to disaster roaming.
\- AMF of the PLMN providing disaster roaming needs to handle a new
registration type from the UE.
\- AUSF of the HPLMN may need to handle the authentication of the UE which is
registering due to disaster condition.
## 6.20 Solution #20
### 6.20.1 Description
#### 6.20.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses the following key issue:
Key Issue #4: Registration to the roaming PLMN without Disaster Condition in
case of Disaster Condition
This solution enables AUSF of the HPLMN of the UE to determine that the UE is
requesting disaster roaming in a PLMN (called PLMN A) without Disaster
Condition so that the AUSF starts authentication rather than rejecting the
authentication due to PLMN A being a forbidden PLMN for the UE.
This solution also enables UDM of the HPLMN of the UE to determine that the UE
is roaming using disaster roaming so that the UDM can provide the AMF with
UE\'s subscription data applicable for disaster roaming.
#### 6.20.1.2 Detailed description
If the UE determined that Disaster Condition applies for a PLMN (called PLMN
D), only PLMNs in the UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs are available, and the UE
selects a PLMN (called PLMN A) without Disaster Condition which accept
Disaster Inbound Roamers from PLMN D, then the UE registers using a regular
REGISTRATION REQUEST message sent in PLMN A.
NOTE: In this solution, whether the UE indicates that the registration is for
disaster roaming depends on whether UE capabilities not available in Rel-16
UEs are needed for disaster roaming.
If the UE does not have 5G-GUTI for PLMN D and PLMN D is not UE\'s HPLMN, then
the UE indicates PLMN D as the previously selected PLMN with Disaster
Condition, in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message sent in PLMN A.
When a UE is registering via NG-RAN node of PLMN A to AMF of PLMN A and:
\- PLMN ID of UE\'s 5G-GUTI;
\- PLMN ID of UE\'s SUCI (if UE\'s 5G-GUTI is not provided); or
\- previously selected PLMN with Disaster Condition indicated in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message (if UE\'s 5G-GUTI and UE\'s SUCI are not
provided);
identifies a PLMN with Disaster Condition in the area served by NG-RAN node
serving the UE (e.g. by PLMN ID being part of \"disaster roaming PLMN list\"
provided by NG-RAN node serving the UE or PLMN ID and the area served by the
RAN node serving the UE being in AMF\'s stored \"disaster roaming PLMN and
area list\") then
a) the AMF determines the previously selected PLMN with Disaster Condition as:
1) PLMN ID of UE\'s 5G-GUTI;
2) PLMN ID of UE\'s SUCI (if UE\'s 5G-GUTI is not provided); or
3) previously selected PLMN with Disaster Condition indicated in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message (if UE\'s 5G-GUTI and UE\'s SUCI are not
provided).
b) the AMF considers that the UE requests the disaster roaming and the AMF
includes the \"disaster roaming request\" indication in a primary
authentication related message (e.g. Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate
Request) sent towards the AUSF of the HPLMN of the UE. If the previously
selected PLMN with Disaster Condition is not UE\'s HPLMN the AMF also includes
the previously selected PLMN with Disaster Condition in the primary
authentication related message.
If the AUSF of the HPLMN of the UE receives a primary authentication related
message (e.g. Nausf_UEAuthentication_Authenticate Request) with the \"disaster
roaming request\", the serving network name indicates a PLMN in which the UE
is not allowed to roam in non-disaster condition and:
\- the previously selected PLMN with Disaster Condition is not received; or
\- the previously selected PLMN with Disaster Condition is received and the UE
is allowed to roam in non-disaster condition in the previously selected PLMN
with Disaster Condition;
then, the AUSF authenticates the UE (rather than rejecting the authentication)
and if the primary authentication is successful, and the AUSF informs the UDM
using Nudm_UEAuthentication_ResultConfirmation Request that the UE roams using
disaster roaming.
If the primary authentication is successful, the AMF determines that the UE
roams using disaster roaming.
If the UDM is informed that the UE roams using disaster roaming, when the AMF
requests UE\'s subscription data, the UDM can provide the AMF with the UE\'s
subscription data applicable for disaster roaming.
If the AMF is informed that the UE roams using disaster roaming, the AMF
informs the SMF serving a PDU session established by the UE that the UE roams
using disaster roaming. If the SMF is informed that the UE roams using
disaster roaming, the SMF informs the CHF that the UE roams using disaster
roaming. If the CHF is informed that the UE roams using disaster roaming, the
CHF includes the information in CDRs.
### 6.20.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The UE is impacted with conditional indicating the previously selected PLMN
with Disaster Condition, as described in clause 6.20.1.
The AMF of the PLMN without Disaster Condition is impacted by providing the
AUSF of the HPLMN of the UE with the \"disaster roaming request\" and
conditionally the previously selected PLMN with Disaster Condition, and by
providing the SMF serving a PDU session of the UE with information that the UE
roams using disaster roaming.
The SMF is impacted by providing the CHF with information that the UE roams
using disaster roaming.
The CHF is impacted by including information that the UE roams using disaster
roaming, in CDRs.
The AUSF of the HPLMN of the UE is impacted by performing the primary
authentication if \"disaster roaming request\" is received, as described in
clause 6.20.1 and providing information to the UDM, as described in clause
6.20.1.
The UDM of the HPLMN of the UE is impacted by providing the AMF of the PLMN
without Disaster Condition with the UE\'s subscription data applicable for
disaster roaming.
Whether the NG-RAN of the PLMN without Disaster Condition is impacted with
providing the AMF of the PLMN without Disaster Condition with \"disaster
roaming PLMN list\", depends on solution selected for key issue #3 and key
issue #2.
NOTE: If the AMF of the PLMN without Disaster Condition is provided (via the
CBCF/PWS-IWF) by the CBE with the \"disaster roaming PLMN and area list\", the
NG-RAN of the PLMN without Disaster Condition is not impacted.
## 6.21 Solution #21: Solution for PLMN selection when a \"Disaster
Condition\" applies
### 6.21.1 Introduction
This is a solution for Key Issue #5 (PLMN selection when a \"Disaster
Condition\" applies).
### 6.21.2 Detailed description
The UE can be provisioned with disaster roaming assistance information, which
the UE will use to select a PLMN upon being notified that a Disaster Condition
applies to the registered PLMN.
The disaster roaming assistance information can be:
a) pre-configured in the ME;
b) pre-configured in the USIM;
c) sent to the UE by the network using the UE parameters update procedure
(before a Disaster Condition applies);
d) sent to the UE by the network using the steering of roaming procedure
(before a Disaster Condition applies); or
e) signalled to the UE by the PLMNs without Disaster Condition (when a
Disaster Condition applies).
Only the disaster roaming assistance information provisioned by the network is
used by the UE, if both a disaster roaming assistance information provisioned
by the network and a pre-configured disaster roaming assistance information
are present. If no disaster roaming assistance information is provisioned by
the network, and the UE has a pre-configured disaster roaming assistance
information in both the USIM and the ME, then only the pre-configured disaster
roaming assistance information in the USIM is used.
The disaster roaming assistance information can consist of:
a) a prioritized list of PLMNs. In this case, the UE attempts registration on
the available PLMNs from the list in priority order;
NOTE 1: The prioritized list of PLMN can be UE-specific, so as to direct a
first group of UEs to PLMN 1, a second group of UEs to PLMN 2, and so on.
b) a weighted list of PLMNs. In this case, the UE performs a weighted random
draw among the available PLMNs from the list; or
NOTE 2: The weight assigned to each PLMN can be commensurate to the size of
the PLMN or the capacity of the PLMN to accommodate Disaster Inbound Roamers.
NOTE 3: Indication of the capacity of PLMNs without Disaster Condition to
accept Disaster Inbound Roamers, pre-configured in the UE or provided to the
UE using NAS signalling before the disaster, might not reflect the actual
state after the disaster, since the disaster can also make some RAN nodes of
PLMNs without Disaster Condition not operational.
c) an indication of the capacity of PLMNs without Disaster Condition to accept
Disaster Inbound Roamers e.g broadcast by the PLMNs which indicate that they
can accommodate Disaster Inbound Roamers. In this case, the UE performs a
weighted random draw among the available PLMNs taking into account the
capacity of each PLMN.
NOTE 4: The capacity of a PLMN without Disaster Condition to accept Disaster
Inbound Roamers can be determined by the PLMN without Disaster Condition based
on operator\'s policies e.g. the amount of resources allocated by the PLMN to
serve Disaster Inbound Roamers.
NOTE 5: Extension of broadcast signalling is subject to agreement of RAN WGs.
If the UE is notified that a Disaster Condition applies to the registered
PLMN, as specified in the solution(s) to Key Issue #1 (Notification of
Disaster Condition to the UE):
a) the UE shall perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [7]
clause 4.4.3.1.1 with the exceptions:
1) the UE shall not consider the PLMN with Disaster Condition as PLMN
selection candidate unless the PLMN is available in satellite NG-RAN; and
NOTE 6: Input from SA3 is needed regarding potential security risks resulting
from ignoring the HPLMN\'s coverage when the UE determines that the HPLMN is
with Disaster Condition.
2) for bullets iv) and v) in 3GPP TS 23.122 [7] clause 4.4.3.1.1, the UE shall
consider the available PLMNs which indicate that they can accommodate Disaster
Inbound Roamers as determined in solution(s) to Key Issue #3 (Indication of
accessibility from other PLMNs without Disaster Condition to the UE) as
highest priority, even if the PLMNs are in the UE\'s \"forbidden PLMNs\" list.
If more than one such PLMN is available, the order in which the UE attempts
registration is based on:
i) disaster roaming assistance information, if provisioned to the UE; or
ii) UE implementation; and
NOTE 7: How the UE determines the order can be impacted by the solution(s)
agreed for Key Issue #7 (Prevention of signalling overload in PLMNs without
Disaster Condition). For instance the order could be randomized at the UE, to
distribute the load between the available PLMNs.
b) if the UE was able to successfully register on a PLMN after performing
bullet a) above, the procedure ends and the UE camps on the selected PLMN as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [7], with the following exceptions:
1) if the selected PLMN is in the UE\'s \"forbidden PLMNs\" list, the UE shall
not remove the PLMN from the UE\'s \"forbidden PLMNs\" list;
2) if the selected PLMN is a VPLMN and:
i) the selected PLMN is in the UE\'s \"forbidden PLMNs\" list, the UE shall
not perform higher priority PLMN search until the UE is notified that the
Disaster Condition no longer applies as specified in solution(s) to Key Issue
#6 (Notification that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable to the UEs);
or
ii) the selected PLMN is not in the UE\'s \"forbidden PLMNs\" list, when
performing higher priority PLMN search as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [7]
clause 4.4.3.3.1, the UE shall not consider the PLMN with Disaster Condition
as PLMN selection candidate unless the PLMN is available in satellite NG-RAN;
and
3) if PLMN selection is subsequently triggered due to switch-on or recovery
from lack of coverage, the UE shall:
i) not consider the PLMN with Disaster Condition as PLMN selection candidate
unless the PLMN is available in satellite NG-RAN; and
ii) not consider an equivalent PLMN of the registered PLMN if the registered
PLMN is in the UE\'s \"forbidden PLMNs\" list, the UE is registered to that
PLMN for disaster roaming and the equivalent PLMN does not indicate that it
can accommodate Disaster Inbound Roamers as determined in solution(s) to Key
Issue #3 (Indication of accessibility from other PLMNs without Disaster
Condition to the UE).
### 6.21.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE
\- support for performing existing PLMN selection procedures with the
exceptions described in clause 6.21.2; and
\- support for handling of disaster roaming assistance information.
UDM of HPLMN
\- optionally, support for providing disaster roaming assistance information.
AMF of registered PLMN (with Disaster Condition)
\- optionally, support for providing disaster roaming assistance information.
AMF of PLMNs indicating that they can accept Disaster Inbound Roamers:
\- optionally, support for providing disaster roaming assistance information.
NG-RAN of PLMNs indicating that they can accept Disaster Inbound Roamers:
\- optionally, support for providing disaster roaming assistance information.
## 6.22 Solution #22: Considerations for PLMN selection when a \"Disaster
Condition\" applies
This solution addresses the Key Issue #5 \"PLMN selection when a \"Disaster
Condition\" applies\".
### 6.22.1 Detailed description
The disaster condition on a HPLMN/EHPLMN or a preferred PLMN affects the UE
behaviour in the PLMN search procedure.
#### 6.22.1.1 UE action for disaster roaming
System information broadcast in a PLMN informs UE whether disaster roaming is
allowed and whether it is allowed for a specific (set of) PLMN(s) or all PLMNs
.
While performing a PLMN search, if the available PLMN is in the forbidden PLMN
list or in the list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\", a UE may
select this PLMN temporarily ignoring its presence in the list of forbidden
PLMNs or in the list of 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming, if it is:
1\. either broadcasting \"disaster roaming active\" information in SIB1 and
not broadcasting SIB X with the list of PLMN IDs for which disaster roaming is
active
2\. or broadcasting \"disaster roaming active\" information in SIB1 and
broadcasting a PLMN ID that is either its HPLMN or any PLMN which is not in
its forbidden PLMN list in SIB X.
NOTE: Introduction of new information in SIB1, introduction of new SIB type
and split of information between SIB1 and new SIB is subject to RAN2
agreement.
_If the UE, due to the indication of \"disaster roaming active\" condition, is
registering to a PLMN which is listed in either the forbidden PLMN list or the
list of \"5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\" and this PLMN accepts the
registration, the UE shall not remove this PLMN from the forbidden PLMN list
or from the_ list of \" 5GS forbidden tracking areas for roaming\"_._
_If UE is camped on a PLMN indicating that it allows disaster roaming then the
UE shall assume that the PLMNs which are listed in SIB as being not
operational due to a disaster situation are not suitable/available and thus
may skip \"In VPLMN\" background PLMN search for higher priority PLMNs (see
23.122 clause 4.4.3.3) if no other higher priority PLMNs are listed in the
preferred PLMN lists for the current MCC._
### 6.22.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE: UE actions for PLMN search and roaming during disaster condition
## 6.23 Solution #23
### 6.23.1 Description
#### 6.23.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses the following key issue:
Key issue #5: PLMN selection when a \"Disaster Condition\" applies
The UE uses the determination that Disaster Condition applies for a PLMN
(called PLMN D) as determined in a solution for Key Issue #1 and determination
that another PLMN (called PLMN A) without Disaster Condition can accept
Disaster Inbound Roamers from PLMN D with Disaster Condition as determined in
a solution for Key Issue #3, to select PLMN A as the selected PLMN, despite
PLMN A being in UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs.
NOTE: If PLMN D needs to operate an NG-RAN cell for testing purposes, PLMN D
can configure the NG-RAN cell to broadcast cellReservedForOperatorUse set to
\"reserved\".
#### 6.23.1.2 Detailed description
The legacy principles for PLMN selection are extended as follows:
If:
\- the UE determines that Disaster Condition applies for PLMN D as determined
in a solution for Key Issue #1;
\- the UE determines that PLMN A without Disaster Condition can accept
Disaster Inbound Roamers from PLMN D with Disaster Condition as determined in
a solution for Key Issue #3;
\- PLMN D is UE\'s HPLMN or is not in UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs; and
\- PLMN A is in UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs;
then:
\- the UE shall consider PLMN A as an allowable PLMN.
\- in automatic PLMN selection, the UE shall consider PLMN A for selection
with the lowest priority. If there are several PLMNs A, the UE shall consider
PLMNs A for selection in random order.
NOTE: If a non-forbidden PLMN is available in 3GPP access (terrestrial or
satellite), the UE selects a non-forbidden PLMN in automatic PLMN selection.
If the UE determines that Disaster Condition applies for several PLMNs D, as
determined in a solution for Key Issue #1 and:
\- UE\'s RPLMN is one of those PLMNs D, the UE considers UE\'s RPLMN as the
selected PLMN D; or
\- UE\'s RPLMN is not one of those PLMNs D, the UE considers one of PLMNs D as
the selected PLMN D based on the priority of the PLMNs as described in 3GPP TS
23.122 [7] clause 4.4.3;
and in automatic PLMN selection above the UE only considers PLMNs A without
Disaster Condition which can accept Disaster Inbound Roamers from the selected
PLMN D.
If the UE selects PLMN A in UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs and the UE
successfully registers in PLMN A, the UE does not remove PLMN A from UE\'s
list of forbidden PLMNs.
### 6.23.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The UE is impacted with updated automatic PLMN selection as described in
clause 6.23.1.
## 6.24 Solution #24
### 6.24.1 General
The solution aims at solving the below study item in the key issue #5
How the UE selects a PLMN if it is determined that a \"Disaster Condition\"
applies;
a) If the UE determines that a \"Disaster Condition\" applies as described in
Key Issue #1 \"Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE\", then how to
update PLMN selection procedure so that the UE avoids selecting the PLMN with
\"Disaster Condition\".
b) How the UE handles the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" when selecting a PLMN
indicating accessibility for the UE in the bullet a).
Once the UE detects \"Disaster Condition\" based on the solution for key issue
#1, UE shall perform a PLMN selection and shall consider the list of \"List of
PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\" in the PLMN selection. In the
PLMN selection procedure, if the UE finds PLMN that is in the forbidden PLMN
list, UE shall consider the forbidden PLMN also for PLMN selection if they are
present in the \"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\".
Forbidden PLMNs shall be considered in the same order in which they are
present in the \"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\".
This is because the serving PLMN can arrange the PLMNs in a particular order
to distribute the UEs so that all the UEs does not try to attempt registration
on to the same PLMN for disaster roaming in case of a disaster condition and
if these PLMNs are available. When the UEs are registering in a particular
area (before the disaster has happened), AMF can assign the priority of the
PLMNs in the order in \"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\"
e.g. If there are 2 PLMNs, PLMN_1 and PLMN_2 supporting disaster roaming in a
particular area, then AMF can assign the list as {PLMN1, PLMN2} for UE_1 and
then {PLMN2, PLMN1} for UE_2.
As long as the \"Disaster Condition\" is applicable, PLMNs in the forbidden
list can be considered as available if they are present in the \"List of PLMNs
to be used while in Disaster condition\" and if those PLMNs indicate that they
support disaster roaming. Once the \"Disaster Condition\" is over, UE shall
treat the PLMNs in the forbidden PLMN list as forbidden. Otherwise no need for
any change for the forbidden PLMN list.
### 6.24.2 Solution description
Once the UE detects \"Disaster Condition\" based on the solution for key issue
#1, UE performs PLMN selection as follows
\- All the available PLMNs are sorted based on the PLMN selection algorithm
defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 clause 4.4.3.1.1 with the following changes
a) UE arranges the available PLMNs in the order mentioned in i, ii, iii, iv in
4.4.3.1.1 based on the PLMN if they PLMNs fall in those categories.
b) Each PLMNs that is present in the \"List of PLMNs to be used while in
Disaster condition\" and forbidden PLMNs list is considered in bullet v of
23.122 4.4.3.1.1 and is given lower priority than the PLMNs that are not in
the forbidden PLMN list.For bullets v in 4.4.3.1.1, all the PLMNs that are
present in the \"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\" are
sorted in the order in which they are present in \"List of PLMNs to be used
while in Disaster condition\" if the PLMNs also indicate that they support
disaster roaming. In normal scenario, these PLMNs are sorted in random order
based on the signal strength. (bullets v in 23.122 4.4.3.1.1).
c) UE selects the PLMN which is highest priority after following the above
procedure.
\- If only forbidden PLMNs are available and if they are present in \"List of
PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\" and if the PLMNs also indicate
that they support disaster roaming, those PLMNs are selected in the order in
which they are present in \"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster
condition\"
### 6.24.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
Changes needed in PLMN selection procedure defined in 3GPP TS 23.122 4.4.3.1.1
\- UE needs to update its PLMN selection.
## 6.25 Solution #25
### 6.25.1 Introduction
This is a solution for Key Issue #5: PLMN selection when a \"Disaster
Condition\" applies as specified in clause 5.5. Especially, this solution
tries to resolve the following issues in the Key Issue #5:
\- How the UE handles the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" when selecting a PLMN
indicating accessibility for the UE in the bullet 1).
This solution also tries to resolve the Key Issue #9: Handling of Disaster
inbound roaming PLMNs in Manual PLMN selection, as specified in clause 5.9.
In this solution, it is assumed that the UE determines that the Disaster
Condition applies to PLMN D (PLMN with Disaster Condition) based on the
solution for Key Issue #1 \"Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE\",
and the UE is notified that one or more PLMN A (PLMN without Disaster
Condition) can accept Disaster Inbound Roamer from PLMN D based on the
solution for Key Issue #3 \" Indication of accessibility from other PLMNs
without Disaster Condition to the UE\".
### 6.25.2 Detailed description
When the UEis notified that Disaster Condition applies to the PLMN D, and the
following conditions are met:
\- the PLMN D is UE\'s HPLMN or is not in UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs
\- the PLMN A is available at the UE\'s location;
\- the PLMN A can provide Disaster Roaming services to the Disaster Inbound
Roamer from PLMN D; and
\- the PLMN A is in UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs,
then the UE shall add the PLMN A to the list of \"alleviated forbidden PLMN\"
in the UE\'s storage. The UE shall delete the stored list if the USIM is
removed or if the UE is switched off.
In automatic network selection mode, the UE shall consider a PLMN in the list
of forbidden PLMN as allowable PLMN if the same entry exists in the list of
alleviated forbidden PLMN. Otherwise, PLMNs in the list of forbidden PLMN
shall not be considered as allowable PLMNs.
The priority of such PLMNs is the lowest in the order specified in clause
4.4.3.1.1 of 3GPP TS 23.122 [7]. This means:
i) either the HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or the
highest priority EHPLMN that is available (if the EHPLMN list is present) ;
ii) each PLMN/access technology combination in the \"User Controlled PLMN
Selector with Access Technology\" data file in the SIM (in priority order);
iii) each PLMN/access technology combination in the \"Operator Controlled PLMN
Selector with Access Technology\" data file in the SIM (in priority order) or
stored in the ME (in priority order);
iv) other PLMN/access technology combinations with received high quality
signal in random order;
v) other PLMN/access technology combinations in order of decreasing signal
quality; and
vi) PLMN/access technology combinations in the list of alleviated forbidden
PLMN.
In manual network selection mode, when NAS layer indicates the list of
available PLMNs as candidate PLMNs to the upper layer, NAS layer shall
indicate the PLMNs in the list of alleviated forbidden PLMN as available PLMNs
not in the list of forbidden PLMN to the upper layer, only if there is no PLMN
available other than those in the UE\'s list of forbidden PLMN. NAS layer may
provide additional information that \"a Disaster Condition applies to the PLMN
with Disaster Condition.\"
If the PLMN A which was in the list of forbidden PLMNs is selected by the UE
and the UE successfully registers in the PLMN A, the UE shall not remove PLMN
A from the list of forbidden PLMNs.
When the UE is notified that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable based
on the solution of Key Issue #6: Notification that Disaster Condition is no
longer applicable to the UEs, the UE shall delete the stored list of
alleviated forbidden PLMN, and apply normal network selection procedure as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [7].
### 6.25.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The UE is impacted with the introduction of the list of alleviated forbidden
PLMN list and the update to the automatic network selection.
## 6.26 Solution #26: PLMN selection base on DRS-Supported PLMN list
### 6.26.1 Introduction
This solution addresses the Key issue #5: the PLMN selection when a \"Disaster
Condition\" applies.
In the solution, PLMN D is the PLMN with Disaster Condition and PLMN A is the
PLMN without Disaster Condition.
### 6.26.2 Detailed description
In this solution, it is assumed that the UE determines that the Disaster
Condition applies to PLMN D based on the solution for Key Issue #1
\"Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE\".
If the UE has the information used for PLMN selection when a \"Disaster
Condition\" applies and there is no available non-forbidden PLMN, the UE
selects a PLMN without Disaster Condition based on the information.
This information contains Disaster Roaming service(DRS)-Supported PLMN list
used for PLMN selection when a \"Disaster Condition\" applies. The PLMN in the
DRS-Supported PLMN list does not have the roaming agreements with the PLMN D
but is able to provide the Disaster Condition roaming service for the UE when
the Disaster Condition happens to PLMN D. The UE may obtain these PLMN(s) in
the following ways:
1) pre-configured by HPLMN;
2) broadcasted by PLMN A; or
NOTE: How the PLMN A delivers the DRS-Supported PLMN list is based on the
solution for Key Issue #1 \"Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE\" or
the solution for Key Issue #3: Indication of accessibility from other PLMNs
without Disaster Condition to the UE.
3) delivered by PLMN D with NAS or AS message before a \"Disaster Condition\"
applies.
The UE selects a PLMN A among the available PLMNs under Disaster condition to
obtain Disaster Roaming service. The available PLMNs under Disaster condition
shall fulfill the following conditions:
a) PLMN A is in the DRS-supported PLMN list; and
b) There is an NG-RAN cell broadcasting PLMN ID of PLMN A.
When the UE in manual mode determines that the Disaster Condition applies to
the PLMN D selected by the user based on the solution for Key Issue #1
\"Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE\", the UE can automatically
select a PLMN which can provide Disaster Roaming service to the UE of PLMN D,
and the UE can provide an indication to the upper layers that the UE has
exited manual network selection mode.
If there are more than one available PLMN A, the UE can perform PLMN selection
based on the following crierions:
a) the priority order of Disaster Roaming service(DRS)-Supported PLMN list, if
any;
b) otherwise, select an available PLMN A randomly; or
c) UE implementation.
After the UE registers to the PLMN A, the UE shall still perform the higher
priority PLMN search periodly as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [7] clause
4.4.3.3.1. Once the UE finds that the HPLMN or a higher priority PLMN becomes
available, it shall perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [7]
clause 4.4.3.1.1.
The UE shall not remove the PLMN from the list of \"forbidden PLMNs\" when
selecting a PLMN indicating accessibility for the UE.
### 6.26.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE:
\- support for being pre-configured **the DRS-Supported PLMN list** by HPLMN;
or
\- support for obtaining **the DRS-Supported PLMN list** from the network;
\- support for PLMN selection using DRS-Supported PLMN list.
RAN nodes of PLMN A:
\- support for providing DRS-supported PLMN list.
AMF:
\- support for providing DRS-supported PLMN list via NAS message.
## 6.27 Solution #27: Indicating to the UE, via non-3GPP access, the end of a
disaster condition that was applicable to the 3GPP access of the same PLMN
### 6.27.1 Description
#### 6.27.1.1 Introduction
This solution corresponds to:
\- KI#6 on Notification that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable to the
UEs (see clause 5.6), and
\- KI#8 on Prevention of signalling overload by returning UEs in PLMN
previously with Disaster Condition (see clause 5.8)
#### 6.27.1.2 Detailed description
This solution is for a UE:
\- that supports the non-3GPP access in addition to the 3GPP access;
\- that supports NAS over the non-3GPP access;
\- that supports connecting to N3WIF;
\- that was registered to the same PLMN over 3GPP and non-3GPP access before
(and when) the disaster condition occurred;
\- that is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over the non-3GPP access; and
\- that does not register to another PLMN over the 3GPP access while the
disaster condition is ongoing.
Also, this solution is for a PLMN with a Disaster Condition (DC) and the PLMN:
\- has N3IWF, and the AMF of the PLMN supports the N2 connection from the
N3IWF; and
\- for which the non-3GPP access network is not affected by the Disaster
Condition.
Furthermore the UE was previously registered to the same PLMN over the 3GPP
access for which a DC had previously occurred, and for which the UE had
remained on the same PLMN over the non-3GPP access i.e. the UE did not
register over the 3GPP access on another PLMN without a disaster condition.
The serving AMF determines that a UE which is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over the
non-3GPP access is within the area where a previous disaster condition is no
longer applicable to the 3GPP access.
The AMF notifies the UE with a NAS message, e.g. Configuration Update Command
message that a disaster condition no longer applies to 3GPP access.
To avoid numerous simultaneous returns and consequently simultaneous
registration attempts on the same PLMN over the 3GPP access, the AMF may
provide a \"wait timer\" that indicates a period during which the UE should
wait before attempting to return and register to the same PLMN over the 3GPP
access.
When the UE receives, over the non-3GPP access, a notification that the
disaster condition on the 3GPP access has ended, the UE removes the stored
information about the disaster condition, if any. The UE returns to the same
PLMN over the 3GPP access by performing a registration procedure with the same
PLMN over the 3GPP access as follows:
\- if the UE had disabled the lower layers of the 3GPP access, the UE shall
enable the lower layers of the 3GPP access and peform a PLMN search
\- if the UE received a \"wait time\" from the AMF, the UE starts a timer and
registers to the PLMN over the 3GPP access after the timer expires. Otherwise,
if no \"wait time\" was received, the UE attempts to register immediately over
the 3GPP access to the same PLMN.
This same solution (as described above) can also be used in the case when,
following a disaster condition, the UE registers over the non-3GPP access with
another PLMN that is offering disaster roaming services.
In this case, the AMF of the PLMN that is offering disaster roaming service
determines that the UE\'s previous PLMN no longer experiences a disaster
condition. For a UE in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over the non-3GPP access, the AMF
informs the UE with a NAS message, sent over the non-3GPP access, that a
disaster condition on a previous PLMN is no longer applicable.
Upon reception of this indication, over the non-3GPP access, that a disaster
condition on a previous PLMN is no longer applicable, the UE performs PLMN
search on the 3GPP access and attempts to register to the previous PLMN.
### 6.27.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The following impacts can be identified:
\- AMF
\- Notifying the UE, over the non-3GPP access, that a disaster condition
related to the 3GPP access is no longer applicable
\- Optionally providing a \"wait timer\" to stagger the return of UEs over the
3GPP access
\- UE
\- Handle of a notification, over the non-3GPP access, that a disaster
condition related to the 3GPP access is no longer applicable
\- Optionally handling a \"wait timer\" to guard when the UE can return to
register on the same PLMN over the 3GPP access.
## 6.28 Solution #28: Solution for notification that Disaster Condition is no
longer applicable to the UEs
### 6.28.1 Introduction
This is a solution for Key Issue #6 (Notification that Disaster Condition is
no longer applicable to the UEs).
This solution can be used both over the 3GPP access and over the non-3GPP
access of the PLMN without Disaster Condition (PLMN A).
### 6.28.2 Detailed description
Upon being notified that a Disaster Condition in PLMN D no longer applies, a
PLMN without Disaster Condition (PLMN A) currently serving Disaster Inbound
Roamers may perform one or more of the following:
a) over the 3GPP access, turn off the broadcast indication (e.g. in SIB) that
a Disaster Condition in PLMN D applies;
NOTE 1: Extension of broadcast signalling is subject to agreement of RAN WGs.
NOTE 2: Dynamic update of broadcast signalling is subject to agreement of RAN
WGs.
b) for the Disaster Inbound Roamers in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, which previously
selected PLMN D:
1) perform a generic UE configuration update procedure with an indication that
the Disaster Condition in another PLMN no longer applies; or
2) perform a generic UE configuration update procedure with \"re-registration
requested\", then reject the UE\'s registration request with 5GMM cause #ZZZ
\"disaster condition in other PLMN no longer applies\"; or
If a Disaster Inbound Roamer has an emergency PDU session or a high priority
service, the AMF of PLMN A performs the handling above after release of the
emergency PDU session or after the high priority service is finished.
c) for the Disaster Inbound Roamers in 5GMM-IDLE mode which previously
selected PLMN D and which attempt to transition to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode by
initiating a registration or service request procedure, reject the UE\'s
request with 5GMM cause #ZZZ \"disaster condition in other PLMN no longer
applies\".
The AMF of PLMN A determines the previously selected PLMN of the Disaster
Inbound roamers when the Disaster Inbound Roamers register on PLMN A, as
specified in the solution(s) to Key Issue #4 (Registration to the roaming PLMN
without Disaster Condition in case of Disaster Condition).
Upon:
a) being notified by the lower layers that the indication (e.g. SIB flag)
broadcast by PLMN A that a Disaster Condition applies in PLMN D has been
turned off;
c) receiving a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with an indication that
the Disaster Condition in another PLMN no longer applies; or
d) receiving a REGISTRATION REJECT or SERVICE REJECT message with 5GMM cause
#ZZZ \"disaster condition in other PLMN no longer applies\";
the UE shall remove the stored indication that a Disaster Condition applies to
PLMN D, enter 5GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH and perform PLMN selection as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [7] clause 4.4.3.1.1.
### 6.28.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE
\- support for handling of the indication broadcast by PLMN A (e.g. SIB flag)
that a Disaster Condition in PLMN D applies;
\- support for CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with an indication that
the Disaster Condition in another PLMN no longer applies; and
\- support for 5GMM cause #ZZZ \"disaster condition in other PLMN no longer
applies\".
AMF of registered PLMN (without Disaster Condition)
\- optionally, support for CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message with an
indication that the Disaster Condition in another PLMN no longer applies; and
\- optionally, support for 5GMM cause #ZZZ \"disaster condition in other PLMN
no longer applies \".
RAN of registered PLMN (without Disaster Condition)
\- optionally, support for signalling the indication (e.g. SIB flag) that a
Disaster Condition in PLMN D applies.
## 6.29 Solution #29: O&M-based solution for Key Issue #6
### 6.29.1 Introduction
This solution addresses Key Issue #6: Notification that Disaster Condition is
no longer applicable to the UEs in clause 5.6.
### 6.29.2 Solution description
The Disaster Condition caused RAN unavailability can be treated as a network
fault. As per 3GPP TS 32.101 [5] for defining the legacy PLMN management
functional architecture, the fault management is a basic management function
provided by the PLMN NMS.
Furthermore, as per 3GPP TS 28.533 [6] for the SBA based NMS defined for 5GS,
the network fault supervision service is also a basic management service
provided by the PLMN NMS for the management of the 3GPP network.
The PLMN NMS can directly interface with different network elements within
3GPP network, including core network functions (e.g. AMF, SMF) and RAN nodes
(e.g. gNB) via O&M operations. The required O&M operations may or may not be
standardized, i.e. to use the proprietary implementation.
The O&M-based solution for each question within Key Issue #6 is described as
below:
When the Disaster Condition is no longer applicable to the serving PLMN, the
serving PLMN NMS detects the fault recovery/correction via O&M operations,
removes the stored disaster PLMN ID and disaster area information and then
sends an indicaiton to other Disaster Roaming PLMN NMS to inform that the
Disaster Condition is no longer applicable for it. The Disaster Roaming PLMN
NMS removes the stored disaster PLMN ID and disaster area information and then
sends an indicaiton to its AMFs which are providing the Disaster Roaming for
the Disaster Inbound Roamers. The Disaster Roaming PLMN AMF removes the stored
disaster PLMN ID and disaster area information if any, and informs the
Disaster Inbound Roamers currently registered to it that the Disaster
Condition is no longer applicable for its previous selected PLMN for which the
Disaster Condition is no longer applicable over NAS.
The Disaster Roaming PLMN AMF determines the previous selected PLMN of the
Disaster Inbound roamers when the Disaster Inbound Roamers register to the
Disaster Roaming PLMN, as specified in the solution(s) to Key Issue #4
(Registration to the roaming PLMN without Disaster Condition in case of
Disaster Condition).
NOTE 1: The Disaster Roaming PLMN NMS can also send the indicaiton to its RAN
nodes which are providing the Disaster Roaming for the Disaster Inbound
Roamers and then the RAN node informs the Disaster Inbound Roamers that the
Disaster Condition is no longer applicable for its previous selected PLMN for
which the Disaster Condition is no longer applicable over radio interface.
However this is not considered as an alternative in this solution.
_\"- How to minimize interruption of the service receiving from Disaster
Roaming PLMN (e.g. emergency service or high priority service) when the UE is
notified that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable;\"_
When the Disaster Roaming PLMN AMF was notified that the Disaster Condition is
no longer applicable for Disaster Inbound Roamers, to minimize interruption of
the service receiving from Disaster Roaming PLMN (e.g. emergency service or
high priority service), the AMF handles as following:
(1) When the Disaster Inbound Roamer is current in the connected mode:
In this case, when the user-plane resources was established for the Disaster
Inbound Roamer (i.e. the user data services are ongoing, including emergency
service or high priority service), then after the completion of the ongoing
user data services and before the release of the current N1 NAS signalling
connection, the AMF initiates a network-initiated de-registration procedure by
sending DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GMM cause #11 (PLMN not allowed)
to the UE (i.e. Disaster Inbound Roamer). After completion of the network-
initiated de-registration procedure, the AMF releases the current N1 NAS
signalling connection to move the UE to the idle mode.
NOTE 2: The AMF can based on the existing mechanism to know the completion of
the ongoing user data services, e.g. based on the N2 UE Context Release
Request from RAN.
(2) When the Disaster Inbound Roamer is current in the idle mode:
The AMF defers the handling to the next time when the UE moves to the
connected mode. When next time received a REGISTRATION REQUEST message or
SERVICE REQUEST message from the UE, the AMF rejects it with 5GMM cause #11
(PLMN not allowed).
NOTE 3: There is another alternative for the AMF actively pages the UE to move
to the connected mode and then initiate a network-initiated de-registration
procedure by sending DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with 5GMM cause #11 (PLMN
not allowed) to the UE. However, this is not considered as an alternative in
this solution due to it will consume a lot of radio resources considering due
to paging.
_\"- How to remove the stored information on Disaster Condition from the UE\'s
storage;\"_
Upon receipt of registration reject or service reject or de-registration
request with 5GMM cause #11 (PLMN not allowed), if the UE currently is
registered for the Disaster Roaming, then the UE knows the Disaster Condition
is no longer applicable to its previous selected PLMN and then removes the
stored information on Disaster Condition from the UE\'s storage.
_\"- How Disaster Inbound Roamer UEs perform network selection when notified
that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable.\"_
Upon receipt of registration reject or service reject or de-registration
request with 5GMM cause #11 (PLMN not allowed), if the UE currently is
registered for the Disaster Roaming, then the UE knows the Disaster Condition
is no longer applicable to its previous selected PLMN and then performs the
PLMN selection as legacy with the difference that to treat the previous
selected PLMN as higher priority.
The end-to-end flow of O&M-based solution for KI#6 can be shown in Figure
6.29.2-1 for the UE in the connected mode and in Figure 6.29.2-2 for the UE in
the idle mode:
Figure 6.29.2-1: End-to-end flow of O&M-based solution for KI#6, connected
mode
Figure 6.29.2-2: End-to-end flow of O&M-based solution for KI#6, idle mode
### 6.29.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
AMF:
\- Based on the notification of PLMN NMS via O&M operations that the Disaster
Condition is no longer applicable for Disaster Inbound Roamers, for the
Disaster Inbound Roamer in the connected mode, the AMF initiates a network-
initiated de-registration procedure by sending DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message
with 5GMM cause #11 (PLMN not allowed) to the UE.
\- Based on the notification of PLMN NMS via O&M operations that the Disaster
Condition is no longer applicable for Disaster Inbound Roamers, for the
Disaster Inbound Roamer in the idle mode, upon receipt of a REGISTRATION
REQUEST message or SERVICE REQUEST message from the UE, the AMF rejects it
with 5GMM cause #11 (PLMN not allowed).
UE:
\- Upon receipt of registration reject or service reject or de-registration
request with 5GMM cause #11 (PLMN not allowed), if the UE currently is
registered for the Disaster Roaming, the UE removes the stored information on
Disaster Condition from the UE\'s storage and performs the PLMN selection as
legacy with the difference that to treat the previous serving PLMN as higher
priority.
There are impacts on PLMN NMS but the required O&M operations may not to be
standardized, i.e. by proprietary implementation.
## 6.30 Solution #30: UE-based solution for Key Issue #6
### 6.30.1 Introduction
This solution addresses Key Issue #6: Notification that Disaster Condition is
no longer applicable to the UEs in clause 5.6.
### 6.30.2 Solution description
Disaster Roaming is still a roaming for the UE. In VPLMN, as per specified in
3GPP TS 23.122 [7], the UE shall periodically attempt to obtain service on its
HPLMN (if the EHPLMN list is not present or is empty) or one of its EHPLMNs
(if the EHPLMN list is present) or a higher priority PLMN/access technology
combinations listed in \"user controlled PLMN selector\" or \"operator
controlled PLMN selector\".
In non-roaming scenario, when Disaster Condition applies to the HPLMN, the UE
(i.e. Disaster Inbound Roamer) registered in the Disaster Roaming PLMN shall
also periodically attempt to obtain service on its HPLMN regardless of its
HPLMN has recovered from the Disaster Condition or not. During the periodic
scan, if its HPLMN is available (which clearly means Disaster Condition is no
longer applicable), the UE shall selects its HPLMN; otherwise, the UE still
stays at the current selected Disaster Roaming PLMN, i.e. the HPLMN is still
under Disaster Condition.
In roaming scenario, when Disaster Condition applies to the current serving
VPLMN, the UE (i.e. Disaster Inbound Roamer) registered in the Disaster
Roaming PLMN shall also periodically attempt to obtain service on a higher
priority VPLMN regardless of its previous serving VPLMN has recovered from the
Disaster Condition or not. In roaming scenario, once the UE has registered to
a VPLMN, normally, it means this VPLMN is the highest priority PLMN in the
current area for the UE. Hence, during the periodic scan, if its previous
serving VPLMN is available (which clearly means Disaster Condition is no
longer applicable), the UE shall selects its previous serving VPLMN;
otherwise, the UE still stays at the current selected Disaster Roaming PLMN,
i.e. the previous serving VPLMN is still under Disaster Condition.
Such periodic scan is controlled by a timer T with the range 6 minutes to 8
hours and the default value 1 hour. If the default value applies, at worst it
will defer the UE returning back to its previous serving PLMN for up to 1 hour
after Disaster Condition is no longer applicable to its previous serving PLMN.
Such deferring is acceptable as this is the worst case and also there is no
stage 1 requirements to enforce the UE has to return back immediately once
Disaster Condition is no longer applicable to its previous serving PLMN.
Considering Disaster Condition can be applicable for long time, e.g. several
hours, to avoid the UE frequently performing PLMN scan to drain the UE
battery, the default value (i.e. 1 hour) is preferred to be used for T in such
Disaster Roaming.
The UE based solution for each question within Key Issue #6 is described as
below:
\"- When and how to deliver the information that Disaster Condition is no
longer applicable to Disaster Inbound Roamers;\"
There is no need for the network to deliver the information that Disaster
Condition is no longer applicable to Disaster Inbound Roamers, i.e. nothing
needs to do at both the PLMN with Disaster Condition applied and also the
Disaster Roaming PLMN.
\"- How to minimize interruption of the service receiving from Disaster
Roaming PLMN (e.g. emergency service or high priority service) when the UE is
notified that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable;\"
This question is not applicable as the periodic scan in VPLMN can only be
perfomed by the UE at the idle mode.
\"- How to remove the stored information on Disaster Condition from the UE\'s
storage;\"
During the periodic scan, if the UE finds its previous serving PLMN is
available (which clearly means Disaster Condition is no longer applicable),
then the UE removes the stored information on Disaster Condition from the
UE\'s storage.
\"- How Disaster Inbound Roamer UEs perform network selection when notified
that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable.\"
The UE performs network selection as legacy periodic scan in VPLMN.
### 6.30.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE:
\- The default value (i.e. 1 hour) is preferred to be used for T in Disaster
Roaming.
\- The UE removes the stored information on Disaster Condition from the UE\'s
storage when it finds its previous serving PLMN is available.
No impact on NG-RAN and core network functions.
## 6.31 Solution #31
### 6.31.1 Introduction
This is a solution for Key Issue #6: Notification that Disaster Condition is
no longer applicable to the UEs, as specified in clause 5.6. This solution
also tries to resolve the Key Issue #8: Prevention of signalling overload by
returning UEs in PLMN previously with Disaster Condition, as specified in
clause 5.8.
In this solution, it is assumed that the UE is successfully registered to a
PLMN A (PLMN without Disaster Condition) based on the other key issues.
### 6.31.2 Detailed description
When the Disaster Condition is resolved and PLMN previously with Disaster
Condition is restored and becomes available, PLMN A providing Disaster Roaming
service are notified that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable.
While the UE is a Disaster Inbound Roamer and being served by PLMN A, the AMF
may take the following behaviors in order to return the Disaster Inbound
Roamers to the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition (PLMN D in this
solution).
a) For dispersing the UE\'s transitions to the PLMN D, the AMF may apply the
following behaviors only to part of the Disaster Inbound Roaming UEs at a
time, i.e. based on the mod value of SUPI;
b) If the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE state, the AMF may:
\- wait until the UE enters 5GMM-CONNECTED state, so that the PLMN A can
stagger the return of UEs to the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition; or
\- page the UE to request the establishment of a NAS signalling connection to
the UE;
c) If the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED state, then
1) The AMF may send a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message including the
information of Disaster Condition (Disaster Condition is no longer
applicable). After the completion of UE configuration update procedure, if the
UE has ongoing services with high priority (e.g. UE using emergency PDU
session, MPS/MCS UE or high priority UEs with AC11-15), then the UE waits
until the ongoing services are finished. When the UE finishes the ongoing
session or if the UE has no ongoing services with high priority, the UE shall
request the UE-initiated deregistration request, and enter the 5GMM-
DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH state in order to select the other PLMN, possibly the
PLMN previously with Disaster Condition; or
NOTE: Which services are considered as \"service with high priority\" is upto
the PLMN A\'s policy.
2) alternatively, the AMF may send DEREGISTRATION REQUEST with a new cause
\"Disaster Condition no longer applicable\" in order to deregister the
Disaster Inbound Roaming UEs directly. The UE shall enter the 5GMM-
DEREGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH state in order to select the other PLMN, possibly the
PLMN previously with Disaster Condition;
When the UE is deregistered from the PLMN A after being notified that Disaster
Condition is no longer applicable, the UE shall clear any information
regarding Disaster Condition from its memory.
The information of Disaster Condition in the CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND
shall include the indication that the Disaster Condition is no longer
applicable.
### 6.31.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The AMF is impacted to disperse the returning Inbound Roamers to the PLMN D,
to initiate UE configuration update procedure to notify the UE the end of
Disaster Condition, and to initiate deregistration procedure to the UE of
Disaster Inound Roamer.
The UE is impacted to be deregistered from the PLMN A when the UE is notified
that the Disaster Condition is no longer applicable.
## 6.32 Solution #32: The quick return to PLMN with Disaster Condition
### 6.32.1 Introduction
This is a solution for KI#6:
Key Issue #6: Notification that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable to
the UEs.
In this solution, the UE has registered with a PLMN without Disaster Condition
after Disaster Condition happened for Disaster Roaming service. The PLMN
without Disaster Condition initiates the deregistration procedure for the
Disaster Inbound Roamers when Disaster Condition is no longer applicable.
### 6.32.2 Detailed description
For convenience on description, PLMN D is the PLMN with Disaster Condition and
PLMN A is the PLMN without Disaster Condition.
When it is notified that the Disaster Condition is no longer applicable in
PLMN D:
\- for the UEs in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the AMF of PLMN A initiates the
deregistration procedure by sending a Deregistration Request message to the
Disaster Inbound Roamer from PLMN D. The Deregistration Request message
contains a cause value #XX \"disaster condition in PLMN with disaster
condition is resolved\" or an existing 5GMM cause value (e.g., 5GMM cause #11
(PLMN not allowed)) to indicate that the Disaster Condition in PLMN D is no
longer applicable. The Disaster Inbound Roamer performs the deregistration
procedure as described in 3GPP TS 23.502 [8] and deletes the corresponding
Disaster Condition parameters which include:
\- the parameters provisioned to UE when Disaster Condition applies (e.g.,
assistant information indicated in Key Issue #2 and Key Issue #3);
\- UE context in PLMN A (e.g., GUTI, Disaster Condition Areas, back-off timer,
etc.,); and
\- information for PLMN selection under Disaster Condition.
\- for the UEs in 5GMM-IDLE mode, the PLMN A may page UE to enter 5GMM-
CONNECTED and then perform deregistration procedure above.
If the Disaster Inbound Roamer has any ongoing emergency PDU session or high
priority service, the AMF shall not initiate the deregistration procedure
until the emergency PDU session is released and all the PDU sessions for the
high priority services are released.
After the completion of the deregistration procedure, the Disaster Inbound
Roamer performs the normal PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [7].
The Disaster Inbound Roamer may store the information on the previously
registered PLMN identity (i.e., the PLMN identity of PLMN D) before the
Disaster Condition started to assist the quick return to PLMN D.
### 6.32.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE:
\- support for 5GMM cause value #XX \"disaster condition in PLMN with disaster
condition is resolved\";
\- optionally, support for storing the information on the previously
registered PLMN identity.
AMF of PLMN without Disaster Condition:
\- support for 5GMM cause value #XX \"disaster condition in PLMN with disaster
condition is resolved\".
## 6.33 Solution #33
### 6.33.1 Description
#### 6.33.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses the following key issue:
Key Issue #6: Notification that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable to
the UEs
This solution enables the AMF of a PLMN without Disaster Condition to inform
the UE when the UE enters or is in the 5GMM-CONNECTED mode.
#### 6.33.1.2 Detailed description
If the AMF of a PLMN (called PLMN A) without Disaster Condition determined in
key issue #4 that a UE roams using disaster roaming due to a previously
selected PLMN with Disaster Condition (called PLMN D), then when the AMF
determines that Disaster Condition no longer applies for PLMN D in the area
served by NG-RAN node serving the UE:
\- if the UE is in the 5GMM-CONNECTED mode in 3GPP access, the AMF triggers
over 3GPP access the UE to perform mobility registration update and rejects
the mobility registration update with an indication that Disaster Condition no
longer applies for the other PLMN (e.g. a new 5GMM cause #YYY \"Disaster
Condition in other PLMN no longer applies\"). The indication triggers the UE
to remove stored determination that Disaster Condition applies for PLMN D.
\- if the UE in the 5GMM-IDLE mode in 3GPP access attempts to move to 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode in 3GPP access, the AMF rejects the initial NAS request with an
indication that Disaster Condition no longer applies for the other PLMN (e.g.
5GMM cause #YYY \"Disaster Condition in other PLMN no longer applies\"). The
indication triggers the UE to remove stored determination that Disaster
Condition applies for PLMN D.
If the UE has an emergency PDU session or a high priority service, the AMF
perform the handling above after release of the emergency PDU session or after
the high priority service is finished.
If the UE removes stored determination that Disaster Condition applies for a
higher priority PLMN, the UE enters the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH,
perform PLMN selection and attempts to perform mobility registration update.
### 6.33.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The UE is impacted with processing of the new 5GMM cause #YYY \"Disaster
Condition in other PLMN no longer applies\".
The AMF of the PLMN without Disaster Condition is impacted with sending the
new 5GMM cause #YYY \"Disaster Condition in other PLMN no longer applies\".
Depending on solution for Key Issue #2, the NG-RAN of the PLMN without
Disaster Condition is impacted with providing the AMF with the area served by
the RAN node serving the UE or with the \"disaster roaming PLMN list\" of the
NG-RAN node.
## 6.34 Solution #34
### 6.34.1 Description
#### 6.34.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses the following key issue:
Key Issue #6: Notification that Disaster Condition is no longer applicable to
the UEs
This solution enables the UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode to determine this on its own.
#### 6.34.1.2 Detailed description
The UE in 5GMM-IDLE removes the stored determination that Disaster Condition
applies for a PLMN if a cell of the PLMN becomes available when the UE
periodically attempts to obtain service on HPLMN, an EHPLMN or a higher
priority PLMN/access technology combinations.
If the UE removes the stored determination that Disaster Condition applies for
a higher priority PLMN, the UE enters the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH,
perform PLMN selection and attempts to perform mobility registration update.
### 6.34.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The UE is impacted with:
\- removal of the stored determination that Disaster Condition applies for a
PLMN if a PLMN\'s cell becomes available when the UE periodically attempts to
obtain service on HPLMN, an EHPLMN or a higher priority PLMN/access technology
combinations.
\- entering the state 5GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH, perform PLMN selection and
attempts to perform mobility registration update, if the UE removes the stored
determination that Disaster Condition applies for a higher priority PLMN.
## 6.35 Solution #35: Notification that Disaster Condition is no longer
applicable to the UEs by stopping RAN sharing
### 6.35.1 Description
It is assumed that an NG-RAN node of a PLMN without a disaster condition stops
being a shared RAN node when a disaster condition no longer applies. See
Solution #9 for the details.
With the assumption above, the UEs can come back to the NG-RAN nodes of a PLMN
to which a disaster condition had applied if the NG-RAN nodes of a PLMN
without a disaster condition becomes not shared anymore. Therefore, there is
no need to notify that disaster condition is no longer applicable to the UEs.
However, the UE can recognize that a disaster condition no longer applies to
the current PLMN from the broadcast information, e.g. the barring information
of the cell on which the UE is camping does not include any information
related to Access Identity 3.
NOTE: It is expected that the UE and the NG-RAN will be made capable of
handling Access Identity 3 via conclusions for Key Issue #7.
If the NG-RAN node of a PLMN without a disaster condition stops being a shared
RAN node, a UE in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode can no longer be served by the NG-RAN
node, i.e. from the UE perspective the cell that used to serve the UE
disappears. Then, the UE will camp on a cell of a PLMN where a disaster
condition had applied and perform the registration procedure.
There is no disaster-related information stored in the UE. Thus, there is no
need to remove the stored information on Disaster Condition from the UE\'s
storage.
### 6.35.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE
The UE recognizes that a disaster condition no longer applies to the current
PLMN from the barring information.
NG-RAN
While NG-RAN without a disaster condition is shared, it needs to broadcast
barring information related to Access Identity 3.
## 6.36 Solution #36
### 6.36.1 Introduction
This is a solution for Key Issue #7: Prevention of signalling overload in
PLMNs without Disaster Condition as specified in clause 5.7.
In this solution, it is assumed that the UE selects a PLMN without Disaster
Condition (PLMN A) providing Disaster Roaming services, based on the solutions
of Key Issue #3 and #5. The UE can be already registered to the PLMN A or can
be attempting initial registration to the PLMN A.
### 6.36.2 Detailed description
When the UE initiate one of the following 5GMM procedure to the PLMN providing
Disaster Roaming services:
\- initial registration procedure;
\- registration procedure for mobility and periodic update procedure; or
\- service request procedure,
the AMF may assess the level of congestion or signalling load created by the
Disaster Inbound Roamers, and proceed with the congestion control mechanism
for Disaster Inbound Roamer as follows.
a) AMF may reject the 5GMM request by sending reject message with the
following information
1) 5GMM cause value indicating that the resources are not sufficient for the
Disaster Inbound Roamers; and
2) value for back-off timer T3346;
b) If the UE receives a REJECT message with such information, the UE proceeds
as follows:
1) the UE enters 5GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH, and looks for any other
available PLMNs other than the serving PLMN. If there are one or more
candidates in the UE\'s location, the UE performs PLMN selection to select any
other available PLMN;
2) else, the UE runs timer T3346 with the received value, and do not attempt
to initiate any 5GMM proecedure except the deregistration procedure until the
timer T3346 is expired.
Any other aspects regarding the congestion control mechanism are same as
described in 3GPP TS 24.501 [9].
### 6.36.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The UE is impacted with the new 5GMM cause value and the behaviour with it.
The AMF is impacted with the new 5GMM cause value, and determination of
congestion.
## 6.37 Solution #37: Enabling a PLMN without Disaster Condition to
efficiently prevent Disaster Inbound Roamers from attempting registration on
the PLMN when the PLMN can no longer accept Disaster Inbound Roamers due to
congestion
### 6.37.1 Introduction
This is a solution for the following question of KI#7:
_\- How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
Disaster Inbound Roamers from attempting registration on the PLMN when the
PLMN can no longer accept Disaster Inbound Roamers due to congestion;_
### 6.37.2 Detailed description
To prevent the subscribers of the PLMN with Disaster Condition (i.e. \"PLMN
D\") perform registration to the PLMN without Disaster Condition (i.e. \"PLMN
A\"), the RAN of PLMN A will block the UE\'s attempts based on the \"RRC
Establishment Cause\" and a back-off time.
The above is achieved by the following steps of the registration procedure:
\- When the UE tries to establish an RRC connection in PLMN A, it will use a
new \"Establishment Cause\", e.g. \"Inbound Disaster Roamer\".
NOTE: Introduction of a new RRC Establishment Cause is subject to agreement of
RAN WGs.
\- the AMF has already reached a predefined threshold and has sent an
\"Overload Control\" message to the RAN entities (i.e. gNBs). In this Overload
Control message, the AMF has the option of informing the RAN entities that
connection attempts from \"Disaster Inbound Roamers\" shall be blocked
\- The RAN entities will then send an \"RRC Connection Reject\" message to the
UE with a back-off itmer
\- the RRC layer of the UE will inform the 5GMM layer of the back-off itmer
\- the 5GMM layer of the UE will then stop attempting connection establishment
for the duration of the back-off timer
\- the UE will retry connection establishment for the registration once the
back-off timer has expired
### 6.37.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
AMF:
\- Upon reaching a predefined threshold, the AMF sends an Overload Control to
RAN
UE:
\- Includes a new \"Establishment Cause\" in the RRC Connection Request
message when it tries to establish a new connection to register in a new PLMN
after it has been informed of a Disaster Condition in its HPLMN
RAN:
\- Receives an Overload Control from the AMF for particular attempts that are
triggered by UEs using a new \"Establishment Cause\" in the RRC Connection
Request message.
## 6.38 Solution #38: Prevention of signalling overload via barring factor for
Access Identity 3
### 6.38.1 Description
Within UAC-BarringInfoSet, an NG-RAN node can include barring factor for
Access Identity 3.
During the access barring check, if the UE NAS layer provides Access Identity
3 to the UE RRC layer together with an access category, the UE RRC layer
decides whether the access attempt is allowed or not based on the value of the
barring factor for Access Identity 3 associated with the access category and a
random number drawn if none of the bit(s) for other access identity(ies) in
_uac-BarringForAccessIdentity_ is set to zero.
NOTE: The change in the UAC-BarringInfoSet proposed in this solution is
subject to RAN2 agreement.
The 5GSM level congestion can be prevented by properly setting the values of
the barring factor for Access Identity 3 each of which is associated with an
access category. For example, if access attempts of disaster inbound roamers
related to DNN X should be reduced, the barring factor for Access Identity 3
associated with an operator-defined access category for DNN X can be adjusted.
### 6.38.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE
\- The UE needs to be able to read information related to Access identity 3 in
the barring information including barring factor for Access Identity 3.
\- The UE needs to determine whether an access attempt associated with Access
Identity 3 is allowed based on the value of the barring factor for Access
Identity 3
NG-RAN
\- The NG-RAN node needs to be able to include information related to Access
Identity 3 in the barring information including barring factor for Access
Identity 3.
## 6.39 Solution #39: Solution for prevention of signalling overload in PLMNs
without Disaster Condition by providing disaster roaming assistance
information to distribute roamers, and congestion mitigation
### 6.39.1 Introduction
This is a solution for Key Issue #7 (Prevention of signalling overload in
PLMNs without Disaster Condition).
The solution addresses the first, second and fourth questions to be studied
under Key Issue #7, namely:
\- How to distribute the subscribers of the PLMN with Disaster Condition
between the PLMNs without Disaster Condition available in the area where the
Disaster Condition applies, so as to share the load as evenly as possible
between the PLMNs without Disaster Condition;
\- How to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition,
so as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the number of UEs
attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit; and
\- How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
Disaster Inbound Roamers from attempting registration on the PLMN when the
PLMN can no longer accept Disaster Inbound Roamers due to congestion.
The solution assumes that PLMNs without Disaster Condition which indicate that
they can accept Disaster Inbound Roamers will accept Disaster Inbound Roamers
from any PLMN with Disaster Condition, up until the point when they reach a
congestion situation.
### 6.39.2 Detailed description
#### 6.39.2.1 Distribution of subscribers of the PLMN with Disaster Condition
between the PLMNs without Disaster Condition
The UE can be provisioned with disaster roaming assistance information, which
the UE will use to select a PLMN upon being notified that a Disaster Condition
applies to the registered PLMN.
The disaster roaming assistance information can be:
a) pre-configured in the ME;
b) pre-configured in the USIM;
c) sent to the UE by the network using the UE parameters update procedure
(before a Disaster Condition applies);
d) sent to the UE by the network using the steering of roaming procedure
(before a Disaster Condition applies); or
e) signalled to the UE by the PLMNs without Disaster Condition (when a
Disaster Condition applies).
Only the disaster roaming assistance information provisioned by the network is
used by the UE, if both a disaster roaming assistance information provisioned
by the network and a pre-configured disaster roaming assistance information
are present. If no disaster roaming assistance information is provisioned by
the network, and the UE has a pre-configured disaster roaming assistance
information in both the USIM and the ME, then only the pre-configured disaster
roaming assistance information in the USIM is used.
The disaster roaming assistance information can consist of:
a) a prioritized list of PLMNs. In this case, the UE attempts registration on
the available PLMNs from the list in priority order;
NOTE 1: The prioritized list of PLMN can be UE-specific, so as to direct a
first group of UEs to PLMN 1, a second group of UEs to PLMN 2, and so on.
b) a weighted list of PLMNs. In this case, the UE performs a weighted random
draw among the available PLMNs from the list; or
NOTE 2: The weight assigned to each PLMN can be commensurate to the size of
the PLMN or the capacity of the PLMN to accommodate Disaster Inbound Roamers.
c) an indication of the capacity of PLMNs without Disaster to accept Disaster
Inbound Roamers e.g broadcast by the PLMNs which indicate that they can
accommodate Disaster Inbound Roamers. In this case, the UE performs a weighted
random draw among the available PLMNs taking into account the capacity of each
PLMN.
NOTE 3: The capacity of a PLMN without Disaster Condition to accept Disaster
Inbound Roamers can be determined by the PLMN without Disaster Condition based
on operator\'s policies e.g. the amount of resources allocated by the PLMN to
serve Disaster Inbound Roamers.
NOTE 4: Extension of broadcast signalling is subject to agreement of RAN WGs.
#### 6.39.2.2 Staggering of arrival of Disaster Inbound Roamers
The UE can be provisioned with a disaster roaming wait range, which the UE
will use to determine how long to wait before initiating registration on the
selected PLMN after performing a PLMN selection triggered by a notification
that a Disaster Condition applies to the registered PLMN.
The disaster roaming wait range is set according to operator\'s policies and
can be:
a) pre-configured in the ME;
b) pre-configured in the USIM;
c) sent to the UE by the network using the UE parameters update procedure
(before a Disaster Condition applies); or
d) sent to the UE by the network using the steering of roaming procedure
(before a Disaster Condition applies).
Only the disaster roaming wait range value provisioned by the network is used
by the UE, if both a disaster roaming wait range value provisioned by the
network and a pre-configured disaster roaming wait range value are present. If
no disaster roaming wait range value is provisioned by the network, and the UE
has a pre-configured disaster roaming wait range value in both the USIM and
the ME, then only the pre-configured disaster roaming wait range value in the
USIM is used.
Upon selecting a candidate PLMN following a notification that a Disaster
Condition applies to the registered PLMN, the UE shall generate a random
number within the disaster roaming wait range by applying a hash function to
its IMSI and start a timer set to the generated random number. While the timer
is running, the UE shall not initiate registration. Upon expiration of the
timer, the UE shall initiate registration on the selected PLMN. If no disaster
roaming wait range is provisioned to the UE, the UE shall use a default
disaster roaming wait range. The default disaster roaming wait range is [0 --
5 min].
#### 6.39.2.3 Congestion mitigation in PLMNs without Disaster Condition
Upon encountering congestion due to the arrival of Disaster Inbound Roamers, a
PLMN without Disaster Condition indicating that it can accommodate Disaster
Inbound Roamers may perform one or more of the following:
a) turn off the indication (e.g. SIB flag) that the PLMN can accommodate
Disaster Inbound Roamers, so as to prevent new roamers from considering the
PLMN as PLMN selection candidate;
NOTE 1: Extension of broadcast signalling is subject to agreement of RAN WGs.
b) reject the Disaster Inbound Roamers\' registration or service requests with
5GMM cause #22 \"congestion\" and back-off timer T3346; or
c) reject the Disaster Inbound Roamers\' registration or service requests with
5GMM cause #YYY \"disaster inbound roamers not allowed\".
Upon receiving a REGISTRATION REJECT or SERVICE REJECT with 5GMM cause #YYY
\"disaster inbound roamers not allowed\", the UE shall perform PLMN selection
as specified in the solution(s) for Key Issue #5 (PLMN selection when a
\"Disaster Condition\" applies) with the addition that the UE shall not
consider the selected PLMN as candidate for PLMN selection.
The UE should maintain a list of PLMNs where 5GMM cause # YYY \"disaster
inbound roamers not allowed\" was received:
\- upon receiving 5GMM cause # YYY \"disaster inbound roamers not allowed\",
the UE should add the identity of the PLMN to the list of PLMNs where 5GMM
cause # YYY \"disaster inbound roamers not allowed\" was received and should
start timer TX if timer TX is not already running. The number of PLMNs that
the UE can store where 5GMM cause # YYY \"disaster inbound roamers not
allowed\" was received is implementation specific, but it shall be at least
one. The value of timer TX is UE implementation specific;
\- in automatic PLMN selection the UE shall not consider PLMNs where 5GMM
cause # YYY \"disaster inbound roamers not allowed\" was received as PLMN
selection candidates, unless no other PLMN is available; and
\- the UE shall delete stored information on PLMNs where 5GMM cause # YYY
\"disaster inbound roamers not allowed\" was received when the USIM is
removed, timer TX expires or the UE is notified that the Disaster Condition no
longer applies as specified in solution(s) to Key Issue #6 (Notification that
Disaster Condition is no longer applicable to the UEs).
NOTE 2: Using 5GMM cause #YYY rather than 5GMM cause #22 triggers the UE to
not consider the selected PLMN as candidate for PLMN selection until the USIM
is removed, timer TX expires or the UE is notified that the Disaster Condition
no longer applies, which avoids repeated rejections in case e.g. the PLMN
sending the reject is the only available PLMN in the area.
### 6.39.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE
\- support for handling of disaster roaming assistance information;
\- support for handling of disaster roaming wait range; and
\- support for 5GMM cause #YYY \"disaster inbound roamers not allowed\".
UDM of HPLMN

and
\- optionally, support for providing disaster roaming wait range.
AMF of registered PLMN (with Disaster Condition)

and
\- optionally, support for providing disaster roaming wait range.
AMF of PLMNs indicating that they can accept Disaster Inbound Roamers:

and
\- optionally, support for 5GMM cause #YYY \"disaster inbound roamers not
allowed\".
## 6.40 Solution #40: Enhancements to UAC barring information to prevent
congestion in disaster roaming PLMN
This solution addresses the Key Issue #7 \"Prevention of signalling overload
in PLMNs without Disaster Condition\".
### 6.40.1 Detailed description
It is important for the PLMN providing disaster roaming to avoid degradation
of service levels to its own subscribers due to the activities of incoming
UEs. For this reason, the network needs a method by which it can set
differential access barring levels for own subscribers and disaster roamers.
The usage of new Access Identity 3 allows network to differentiate inbound
roamers from own subscribers. But this alone would not be useful to mitigate
congestion caused by a sudden inflow of inbound roamers.
A new offset value is introduced to the unified access control barring
information. A UE which is registered or attempting registration in a PLMN
which is on the forbidden PLMN list or on the list of \"forbidden tracking
areas for roaming\", but which is broadcasting \"disaster roaming active\",
shall apply a uac-DisasterOffsetToBarringFactor to the uac-BarringFactor.
The uac-DisasterOffsetToBarringFactor indicates to the disaster roaming UEs
the offset value by which the BarringFactor must be reduced when evaluating
the access barring condition for that access category. The uac-
DisasterOffsetToBarringFactor is set per access category.
The uac-DisasterOffsetToBarringFactor is defined as a range of s5 till s95 in
steps of 5.
A disaster roaming UE computes the uac-BarringFactor for its access category
as
uac-BarringFactor = max (p00, (uac-BarringFactor - uac-
DisasterOffsetToBarringFactor))
NOTE: The addition of a new parameter to UAC Barring information is subject to
RAN2 agreement.
### 6.40.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
Unified access control: definition of a new offset for BarringFactor
## 6.41 Recommended PLMN without Disaster Condition
### 6.41.1 Introduction
This is a solution for the following question of KI#7, the principles are as
follows:
_\- How to distribute the subscribers of the PLMN with Disaster Condition
between the PLMNs without Disaster Condition available in the area where the
Disaster Condition applies, so as to share the load as evenly as possible
between the PLMNs_ _without Disaster Condition;_
This solution proposes to configure different UEs with a different recommended
PLMN list for supporting Disaster Condition roaming service.
### 6.41.2 Detailed description
To distribute the subscribers of the PLMN with Disaster Condition to the PLMNs
without Disaster Condition available in the area where the Disaster Condition
happens, the PLMN with Disaster Condition will provide UE a recommended PLMN
list with priority order before the Disaster Condition happens. Different UEs
will be provided with the different recommended PLMN list. When the Disaster
Condition happens to the current PLMN, the UEs will perform the PLMN selection
with the PLMN in the recommended PLMN list based on the priority order and
register to the recommended PLMN for Disaster Condition roaming service.
If all of those PLMNs in the recommended PLMN list are not available, the UE
will switch to limited service state.
NOTE 1: The recommended PLMN list may be provided to the UE over non-3GPP
access if any before the Disaster Condition happens.
As for how to determine the recommended PLMN list, it can be based on the
following information:
\- the agreements with PLMNs without Disaster Condition. For example, based on
the agreements with PLMNs without Disaster Condition the UEs in one area will
be accessed to PLMN#1, while the UEs in another area will be accessed to
PLMN#2.
NOTE 2: How to determine the recommended PLMN list is out of the scope.
### 6.41.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE:
\- support for PLMN selection with the recommended PLMN list;
UDM of HPLMN:
\- support for providing recommended PLMN list.
AMF of registered PLMN (with Disaster Condition):
\- support for providing recommended PLMN list;
## 6.42 Solution #42
### 6.42.1 Description
#### 6.42.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses the following key issue:
Key Issue #7: Prevention of signalling overload in PLMNs without Disaster
Condition
and the following questions of the key issue:
_\- How to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition,
so as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the number of UEs
attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit;_
_\- How to use new Access Identity 3 for the purpose of Disaster Inbound
Roamer access control and signalling overload prevention in the PLMNs without
Disaster Condition;_
_\- How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
Disaster Inbound Roamers from attempting registration on the PLMN when the
PLMN can no longer accept Disaster Inbound Roamers due to congestion._
This solution is based on extension of unified access control and on usage of
existing congestion control mechanisms of core network.
#### 6.42.1.2 Detailed description
When the UE selects a PLMN in the UE\'s forbidden PLMN list according to a
solution for Key Issue #5, the UE considers itself being configured with the
access identity 3.
Furthermore, a new access category X (= MO_Disaster_Roaming) will be
specified.
NOTE 1: pecification of a new access category requires SA1 agreement.
The UE will consider that an access attempt is of the access category X (=
MO_Disaster_Roaming), if the access attempt is triggered by registration in a
solution for Key Issue #4 and the registration is an initial registration or
the first mobility registration update in the PLMN in the UE\'s forbidden PLMN
list selected according to a solution for Key Issue #5.
In order to supress some registrations (an initial registration or the first
mobility registration update in the PLMN in the UE\'s forbidden PLMN list
selected according to a solution for Key Issue #5) in a solution for Key Issue
#4, the NG-RAN node of the PLMN without Disaster Condition and offering
disaster roaming will broadcast UAC-BarringInfoSet for the access category X
(= MO_Disaster_Roaming):
\- with uac-BarringFactor derived from the intended supression rate; and
NOTE 2: uac-BarringFactor in UAC-BarringInfoSet for access category X (=
MO_Disaster_Roaming) can be lower than uac-BarringFactor in UAC-BarringInfoSet
for the access category 3 (= MO_sig).
\- without indicating that access attempt is allowed for access identity 3.
NOTE 3: For an access category other than the access category X, access
attempts from disaster inbound roamers and access attempts from non-disaster
inbound roamers are subject to the same barring factor.
Additionally, the AMF of the PLMN providing the disaster roaming control can
use the existing congestion control mechanisms (e.g. NAS level mobility
management congestion control).
### 6.42.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The UE is impacted with determination of the access identity 3 and the new
access category X (= MO_Disaster_Roaming), as specified in clause 6.42.1.2.
The NG-RAN of the PLMN without Disaster Condition is impacted with broadcast
of barring rates for the new access category X, as specified in clause
6.42.1.2.
## 6.43 Solution #43: List if PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition
### 6.43.1 General
This solution aims at solving the below study items in key issue #7
a) How to distribute the subscribers of the PLMN with Disaster Condition
between the PLMNs without Disaster Condition available in the area where the
Disaster Condition applies, so as to share the load as evenly as possible
between the PLMNs without Disaster Condition;
b) How to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition,
so as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the number of UEs
attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit;
UE is provided with \"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\".
The order in which the PLMNs are arranged in the list by the HPLMN (or serving
PLMN) is the order in which the UE shall prioritize the forbidden PLMNs during
PLMN selection. Also the list is populated with a minium wait time per PLMN
which will help to reduce the signalling overload on the network following the
mass migration.
### 6.43.2 Solution description
When a disaster happens, the network will become unresponsive. So it is good
to prepare the UE for disaster even before the disaster happens. So it is
always better to provide the UE with the information that it can use to
minimize the service interruption before the disaster happens in the form of a
\"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\".The list can be
a) Stored in the SIM card
b) Stored in the Non Volatile memory of the ME
c) Provided by NAS signalling messages via 3GPP or non-3GPP access.
Serving PLMN can arrange the PLMNs in \"List of PLMNs to be used while in
Disaster condition\" in the particular order so as to direct the UE to
different PLMNs to avoid the overload on the network.
PLMNs in \"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\" are arranged
in a particular order by the serving PLMN. Serving PLMN knows exactly how many
PLMNs are there in an area before hand and so when assigning the \"List of
PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\", it provides the UE with a
priority order.
For example, consider the scenario where PLMN DC is the PLMN that is in
disaster condition. PLMN NDC_1 and PLMN NDC_2 are the 2 PLMNs that are Not in
Disaster condition and have coverage in the area where the disaster happened.
For UE1, PLMN DC can assign \"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster
condition\" as {PLMN NDC_1, PLMN NDC_2} and for UE2, PLMN DC can assign the
\"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\". As {PLMN NDC_2, PLMN
NDC_1}. If both the PLMNs NDC_1 and PLMN NDC_2 are available for the UEs, they
need to give priority to the order in which the PLMNs are populated in \"List
of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\".
So in this case UE1 will go to PLMN NDC1 and UE2 will go to PLMN NDC2. The
serving PLMN can thus equally distribute
In addition to the PLMN IDs of the PLMN, there can be a timer associated which
indicates a \'minimum wait time\' that the UE should wait to perform
registration on the PLMN following a disaster condition.
Each of the entry of PLMN in \"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster
condition\" is also associated with a \'minimum wait time\' timer which is
used to control the registration attempt. UE shall not perform a registration
until the \'minimum wait time\' timer has expired. This will also give the NW
a chance to provide service to the UEs based on its priority. For a high
priority device the value of the minimum wait time can be set to a very low
value.
Right now in NAS, a random timer value is used in some situations, advantages
of have a \'minimum wait time\' value is that the registration of the UEs can
be arranged in a more controlled way. Some UEs can also be given priority.
It can also be that the UE can have a random timer started after the minimum
wait time is over which will also ensure less signalling load on the network.
AMF knows the number of UEs registering in a particular area. So AMF can
assign the minimum wait time via NAS signalling so as to distribute the UEs
registration in case of a disaster. E.g the first 20 UEs can be assigned a
minimum wait time of 5 seconds, next 20 UEs a minimum wait time of 10 seconds
and so on.
### 6.43.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
Impacts on the PLMN selection functionality and also the timing of the
registration update procedure once the disaster has happened.
\- UE needs to handle the minimum wait time to control the timing of
registration update procedure.
\- AMF needs to provide UE with the minimum wait time.
## 6.44 Solution #44: Staggering of returning UEs trying to register in the
PLMN previously with Disaster Condition
### 6.44.1 Introduction
This is a solution for the following question of KI#8:
_\- How to stagger the return of UEs to the PLMN previously with Disaster
Condition, so as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the
number of UEs attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable
limit;_
### 6.44.2 Detailed description
To distribute and stagger the return of the subscribers of the PLMN with
Disaster Condition (i.e. \"PLMN D\"), the \"PLMN D\" will provide the UE with
a specific timer which, along with other parameters, will result into a
\"Window of Time\" over which the UE is allowed to make registration attempts
in \"PLMN A\".
The above is achieved by the following steps of the registration procedure:
\- the UE will inform the AMF of PLMN D that it supports MINT in the
Registration Request Message
\- the AMF then sends a specific timer, called T35yy, to the UE in the
Registration Accept.
\- the UE will insert timer T35yy, along with its unique ID, e.g. SUPI/PEI,
into an algorithm
\- the result of this operation will be a series of \"Window of Time\", defned
by an Initial Start Time, an Initial Stop Time, and a \"Wait Time\" between
consecutive (Window of Time) windows
\- the UE is then only allowed to perform registration attempts, when
returning to the PLMN D during an occurrence of the window(s) of time, where
the first occurrence of the window of time is from Initial Start Time to
Initial Stop Time, the second occurrence of window of time is from (Initial
Stop Time + Wait Time) to (Initial Stop Time + Wait Time + the window
duration), and so on
### 6.44.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
AMF:
\- Upon receipt of the Registration Request message, with the UE\'s indication
of support of the MINT feature, the AMF sends a new information element that
contains a new timer, called T35yy, to the UE in Registraion Accept message
UE:
\- Includes the support of MINT in its 5GMM capability IE
\- Upon reception of the new timer T35yy in Registration Accept message, it
calculates the \"Window of Time\" as well as the wait time
## 6.45 Solution #45: Prevention of signalling overload by returning UEs
### 6.45.1 Description
Any existing mechanisms used in the NG-RAN (e.g. UAC) and the 5GCN (NAS-level
congestion control) can be used.
### 6.45.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
None
## 6.46 Solution #46: Solution for prevention of signalling overload by
returning UEs in PLMN previously with Disaster Condition
### 6.46.1 Introduction
This is a solution for Key Issue #8 (Prevention of signalling overload by
returning UEs in PLMN previously with Disaster Condition).
This solution can be used both over the 3GPP access and over the non-3GPP
access of the PLMN without Disaster Condition (PLMN A).
### 6.46.2 Detailed description
Upon being notified that a Disaster Condition in PLMN D no longer applies, a
PLMN without Disaster Condition (PLMN A) currently serving Disaster Inbound
Roamers may perform one or more of the following:
a) over the 3GPP access, wait for an implementation specific amount of time
before turning off the indication (e.g. SIB flag) that a Disaster Condition in
PLMN D applies; or
NOTE 1: Waiting for an implementation specific amount of time ensures that
Disaster Inbound Roamers camping on PLMN 1 are notified that the Disaster
Condition no longer applies at a time different from the time when Disaster
Inbound Roamers camping on PLMN 2 are notified, thereby spreading out in time
the return of Disaster Inbound Roamers to the PLMN previously with Disaster
Condition.
NOTE 2: Extension of broadcast signalling is subject to agreement of RAN WGs.
NOTE 3: Input from SA1 is needed on whether delaying turning off the
indication (e.g. SIB flag) that a Disaster Condition in PLMN D applies
conflicts with regulatory requirements.
b) for the Disaster Inbound Roamers in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, which previously
selected PLMN D:
1) perform a generic UE configuration update procedure with an indication that
the Disaster Condition in another PLMN no longer applies; or
2) perform a generic UE configuration update procedure with \"re-registration
requested\", then reject the UE\'s registration request with 5GMM cause #ZZZ
\"disaster condition in other PLMN no longer applies\";
For both 1) and 2), the time when the procedure is triggered for each UE
should be randomized.
NOTE 4: Randomizing the time when the procedure is triggered for each UE
ensures that Disaster Inbound Roamers served by a given PLMN are notified that
the Disaster Condition no longer applies at different times and thus return to
the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition at different times.
NOTE 5: It is assumed that the AMF of PLMN A determines the previously
selected PLMN of the Disaster Inbound roamers when the Disaster Inbound
Roamers register on PLMN A, as specified in the solution(s) to Key Issue #4
(Registration to the roaming PLMN without Disaster Condition in case of
Disaster Condition).
The UE can be provisioned with a disaster return wait range, which the UE will
use to determine how long to wait before initiating registration on the PLMN
selected after being notified that a Disaster Condition no longer applies.
The disaster return wait range is set according to operator\'s policies and
can be:
a) pre-configured in the ME;
b) pre-configured in the USIM;
c) sent to the UE by the network using the UE parameters update procedure
(before a Disaster Condition applies);
d) sent to the UE by the network using the steering of roaming procedure
(before a Disaster Condition applies); or
e) sent to the UE by the PLMN without Disaster Condition in a CONFIGURATION
UPDATE COMMAND message with an indication that the Disaster Condition in
another PLMN no longer applies or a REGISTRATION REJECT message with new 5GMM
cause #ZZZ \"disaster condition in other PLMN no longer applies\".
Only the disaster return wait range value n provisioned by the network is used
by the UE, if both a disaster return wait range value provisioned by the
network and a pre-configured disaster return wait range value are present. If
no disaster return wait range value is provisioned by the network, and the UE
has a pre-configured disaster return wait range value in both the USIM and the
ME, then only the pre-configured disaster return wait range value in the USIM
is used.
Upon being notified that a Disaster Condition no longer applies (either by
detecting that the serving PLMN has turned off the indication that a Disaster
Condition in PLMN D applies, receiving a CONFIGURATION UPDATE COMMAND message
with an indication that the Disaster Condition in another PLMN no longer
applies, or receiving a REGISTRATION REJECT message with 5GMM cause #ZZZ
\"disaster condition in other PLMN no longer applies\"), the UE shall enter
5GMM-REGISTERED.PLMN-SEARCH and perform PLMN selection as specified in 3GPP TS
23.122 [7] clause 4.4.3.1.1. Upon selecting a PLMN, the UE shall generate a
random number within the disaster return wait range by applying a hash
function to its IMSI and start a timer set to the generated random number.
While the timer is running, the UE shall not initiate registration. Upon
expiration of the timer, the UE shall initiate registration on the selected
PLMN. If no disaster return wait range is provisioned to the UE, the UE shall
use a default disaster return wait range. The default disaster return wait
range is [0 -- 5 min]

## 6.47 Solution #47: Network controlled return of UEs at the end of disaster
condition
At the end of disaster condition, a coordinated action to return roaming UEs
to their own PLMN is required to avoid an exodus in the reverse direction.
This solution addresses the Key Issue #8 \"Prevention of signalling overload
by returning UEs in PLMN previously with Disaster Condition\".
### 6.47.1 Detailed description
In the description, PLMN D is subject to **[d]{.underline}** isaster and PLMN
A is **[a]{.underline}** live and not subject to disaster.
PLMN A providing disaster roaming services is informed of the end of disaster
condition in PLMN D though any of the solutions for Key Issue #6. This may
also include a start time at which to start returning the UEs.
#### 6.47.1.1 Staggered return of UEs controlled by AMF
In order to have a controlled return of the disaster roamers at the start time
indicated by the PLMN D, the time period for which PLMN A keeps the broadcast
indication active and the time period for which it accepts registration
requests by inbound roamers need to be different. This is illustrated in the
figure below.
Figure 6.47.1.1-1 Actions by disaster roaming PLMNs during various phases
Once it is determined that UEs can start to return to PLMN D, the AMF in PLMN
A enters a \'winding down\' phase for disaster roaming. The duration of this
phase is chosen by the networks such that it is larger than the periodic
registration timers configured for disaster roamer UEs. The PLMN A keeps the
broadcast indication of \"disaster roaming active\" in this phase.
Starting from \'winding down\' phase, the AMF:
\- responds to perioidic and mobility registration update requests from
disaster roaming UEs with a Registration Reject message with a reject cause
which is applicable to the normal roaming agreement for this subscriber (e.g.
5GMM cause #11 \"PLMN not allowed\" or #13 \"Roaming not allowed in this
tracking area\"). On receipt of this reject cause the UE will perform PLMN
search and find a suitable cell of PLMN D.
\- responds to an initial registration attempt from disaster inbound roamers
starting from the \'winding down\' phase with a Registration Reject message
according to its normal roaming policies.
\- for a UE in CM-CONNECTED state, if the UE has PDU sessions established and
AMF, based on local configurations, determines that transfer of PDU Sessions
from PLMN A to PLMN D is possible, sends a Configuration Update Command
including the configuration update indication IE with Registration Requested
but set to \"Registration Required\". The subsequent Registration Request by
the UE is rejected with 5GMM cause #13. On receipt of this reject cause the UE
will perform PLMN search and find a suitable cell of PLMN D.
\- for a UE in CM-CONNECTED state, if the UE does not have any PDU sessions
established or the AMF, based on local configurations, determines that
transfer of PDU Sessions from PLMN A to PLMN D is not possible, sends a
Deregistration Request with a reject casue which is applicable to the normal
roaming agreement for this subscriber (e.g. with detach type = \"re-
registration not required\" and 5GMM cause #11 \"PLMN not allowed\" or #13
\"Roaming not allowed in this tracking area\"). The AMF also considers the
ongoing services for deciding when to trigger the Deregistration procedure to
minimize interruption to the UEs. For example the AMF shall not interrupt an
ongoing IMS emergency session, and it should not interrupt an ongoing IMS VoNR
call, if possible. AMF may also decide not to trigger Deregistration for a UE
that has any active persistant bearer. On receipt of this Deregistration
message, the UE shall perform a PLMN search.
The above steps ensure that all disaster roamers that go into CM-CONNECTED
during the winding down phase are gracefully returned. The CM-IDLE roamers are
unaffected since the broadcast indication is not changed. At the end of the
\'winding down\' phase, the PLMN A stops the broadcast indication of
\"disaster roaming active\" condition. This step begins to return all Idle
mode roamers to their own PLMN.
#### 6.47.1.2 Randomized return of UEs
The recovered PLMNs are assumed to be able to handle a percentage of returning
UEs without a problem.
In this approach, the PLMN D indicates that a certain percentage of UEs can
return at a specific time and the remaining UEs shall randomize their return
time to PLMN D.
The AMF in PLMN A sends a \"UE Configuration Update\" message to the disaster
roaming UEs. In this message, the AMF indicates a timer T1 with a value such
that it does not expire before the start time indicated by PLMN D and a value
\'n\' (0 \n, the UE shall start a timer with value (1+x) * T1.
### 6.47.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
AMF: Implement a \"winding down\" phase where CM-Connected UEs are returned,
while keeping the broadcast indication for \"disaster roaming\" active.
UE: Accept a UE configuration update with an indication of a timer value and a
barring factor to compute the local back-off timer before leaving disaster
roaming PLMN.
## 6.48 Solution #48
### 6.48.1 Description
#### 6.48.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses the following key issue:
Key Issue #8: Prevention of signalling overload by returning UEs in PLMN
previously with Disaster ConditionThis solution is based on usage of existing
unified access control.
#### 6.48.1.2 Detailed description
RAN cells of the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition can control access of
returning UEs using the existing unified access control, by setting up UAC
parameters for access category 3 (= MO_sig).
### 6.48.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
None.
## 6.49 Solution #49: Minimum wait timer
### 6.49.1 Solution description
This solution aims at solving the below study item
\- How to stagger the return of UEs to the PLMN previously with Disaster
Condition, so as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the
number of UEs attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit.
UE is provided with \"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster condition\".
Also the list is populated with a minium wait time per PLMN which will help to
reduce the signalling overload on the network following the mass migration. So
when the UE returns to the HPLMN ( or previously served PLMN) UE can use the
same timer and wait for the minimum wait time before initiating registration
attempt in the previous PLMN.
### 6.49.2 Solution description
When a disaster happens, the network will become unresponsive. So it is good
to prepare the UE for disaster even before the disaster happens.
In addition to the PLMN IDs of the PLMN, there will be a timer associated
which indicates a \'minimum wait time\' that the UE should wait to perform
registration on the PLMN following a disaster condition.
Each of the entry of PLMN in \"List of PLMNs to be used while in Disaster
condition\" is also associated with a \'minimum wait time\' timer which is
used to control the registration attempt. After moving back to the previously
served PLMN from the VPLMN, UE shall not perform a registration until the
\'minimum wait time\' timer has expired. This will also give the NW a chance
to provide service to the UEs based on its priority. For a high priority
device the value of the minimum wait time can be set to a very low value.
It can also be a common timer for all PLMNs in the \"List of PLMNs to be used
while in Disaster condition\" and the same timer can be used for re-
registration at the previously served PLMN.
Right now in NAS, a random timer value is used in some situations, advantages
of have a \'minimum wait time\' value is that the registration of the UEs can
be arranged in a more controlled way. Some UEs can also be given priority.
It can also be that the UE can have a random timer started after the minimum
wait time is over which will also ensure less signalling load on the network.
### 6.49.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
Timer value provided to the UE which is used as a minimum wait time for
performing registration on moving back to the previously served PLMN.
\- UE needs to handle the minimum wait timer to control the timing of the
registration procedure.
\- AMF needs to provide a minimum wait time to the UE.
## 6.50 Solution #50: Providing information to the RAN of PLMN A
### 6.50.1 Introduction
This is a solution for the following question of KI#7:
_-_ \"_How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
congestion on the 5GSM level that can be caused by 5GSM signalling generated
by Disaster Inbound Roamers\"._
In this solution, PLMN D is the PLMN with Disaster Condition and PLMN A is the
PLMN that accepts inbound disaster roamers.
This solution assumes that
\- the UE has been informed of the Disaster Condition in PLMN D
\- the UE is about to register in PLMN A
### 6.50.2 Detailed description
The UE will provide the RAN of PLMN A with information to select proper AMF.
The above is achieved by the following steps below:
\- during the RRC Connection Establishment in PLMN A, the UE will send to the
RAN of PLMN A, an indication that it is an \"Inbound Roamer\" due to
\"Disaster Condition\". This new information is sent, in addition to the GUAMI
and 5G-S-TMSI of the UE
\- The RAN will then use these parameters in order to select a special AMF
that the PLMN A has designated for Disaster Inbound Roamers
\- In order to spread the inbound (disaster) roamers, the RAN nodes should be
configured by the operator to choose different AMF entities. This choice could
be based on the geographic area and/or a priority order.
NOTE: Whether the addition of the parameter to the RRC message is a feasible
solution is left for the RAN WGs to decide.
### 6.50.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE:
\- Needs to include a new indicaiton that the UE is a Diaster Inbound Roamer
during the RRC Connection establishment
## 6.51 Solution #51: PLMN selection when shared RAN is available in case of
disaster condition
### 6.51.1 Description
It is assumed that when a disaster condition applies, an NG-RAN node of a PLMN
without a disaster condition becomes a shared RAN node between the PLMN
without a disaster condition and a PLMN where a disaster condition applies.
See Solution #9 for the details.
After a disaster condition applies, a UE can perform PLMN selection (either
automatic or manual) as-is. As a result, the UE will select the same PLMN.
### 6.51.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
None.
## 6.52 Solution #52: New solution to KI#4: Using the existing mobility
restriction list to confine the UE service area in disaster roaming PLMN to
the area of the disaster condition
### 6.52.1 Description
#### 6.52.1.1 Introduction
This solution corresponds to KI#4 on Registration to the roaming PLMN without
Disaster Condition in case of Disaster Condition (see clause 5.1), however the
solution is specific to the following aspect of KI#4:
\- \"How a Disaster Roaming PLMN can limit the area of service to Inbound
Disaster Roamers to the region where Disaster Condition applies\".
#### 6.52.1.2 Detailed description
This solution assumes that the AMF in the PLMN without a disaster condition
knows the area of the disaster condition of the PLMN with the disaster
condition. For example, this can be based on the solution for KI#2 and in
particular on the solution for \"_How to provide information on the area where
Disaster Condition applies\"_.
Currently, the AMF provides a mobility restriction list to the RAN, where the
list can indicate any mobility restrictions for the UE as described in 3GPP TS
23.501 [4]:
_\"For a UE in CM-CONNECTED state the AMF shall indicate the Service Area
Restrictions of this UE to the RAN, using a Mobility Restriction List._
_...[skip]..._
_The RAN uses the Service Area Restrictions for target cell selection in Xn
and N2 based handover.\"_
This **[existing]{.underline}** function should be used to ensure that the
UE\'s service area is confined to the area of the disaster condition. As such,
the AMF determines, based on implementation methods (e.g. based on solutions
for KI#2), the cells where the UE can get service and provide the TACs of
these cells to the RAN. These TACs are indicated to be \"Allowed TACs\" as
part of the Mobility Restriction List IE that is defined in 3GPP TS 38.413.
Futhermore, the since there is no control on the UE services area in EPC, it
is required to make EPC a core network that is not allowed for the UE during
disaster roaming service. Again, this is an **[existing]{.underline}**
function as described in clause 5.3.4.1.1 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [4]:
\"_\- Core Network type restriction:_
_Defines whether UE is allowed to connect to 5GC only, EPC only, both 5GC and
EPC for this PLMN. The Core Network type restriction when received applies in
the PLMN either to both 3GPP and non-3GPP Access Types or to non-3GPP Access
Type only.\"_
The AMF should indicate it to the RAN to avoid handover to EPC where
requirements about service area confinement cannot be met. The AMF indicates
that EPC is not allowed for the UE in the \"Core Network Type Restriction\"
component of the Mobility Restriction List IE that is defined in 3GPP TS
38.413.
### 6.52.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
AMF: needs to set up the mobility restrictions according to the disaster area
(even though it does not have impact on N2 and on RAN).
However the allowed TACs that are provided to the RAN in the mobility
restriction list should correspond to the TACs of the cells that overlap with
the area of the disaster condition.
The AMF also indicates that EPC is not an allowed core network.
## 6.53 Solution #53: Staggering of UEs trying to register in the PLMN without
Disaster Condition
### 6.53.1 Introduction
This is a solution for the following question of KI#7:
_\- How to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition,
so as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the number of UEs
attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit;_
### 6.53.2 Detailed description
To distribute and stagger the arrival of the subscribers of the PLMN with
Disaster Condition (i.e. \"PLMN D\") to the PLMN(s) without Disaster Condition
(i.e. \"PLMN A\") available in the area where the Disaster Condition happens,
the \"PLMN D\" will provide the UE with a specific timer which, along with
other parameters, will result into a \"Window of Time\" over which the UE is
allowed to make registration attempts in \"PLMN A\".
The above is achieved by the following steps of the registration procedure:
\- the UE will inform the AMF of PLMN D that it supports MINT in the
Registration Request Message
\- the AMF then sends a specific timer, called T35xx, to the UE in the
Registration Accept Message along with a list of PLMN(s) that the UE may try
to register on in case a Disaster Condition applies.
\- in case there is more than one PLMN in the list provided by the AMF, the
AMF provides either a priority order for the PLMNs or different timers for
diferent PLMNs in the Registration Accept Message
\- the UE will insert timer T35xx, along with its unique ID, e.g. SUPI/PEI,
into an algorithm
\- the result of this operation will be a series of \"Window of Time\",
defined by an Initial Start Time and an Initial Stop time, and a \"Wait Time\"
between consecutive (Window of Time) windows
\- the UE is then only allowed to perform registration attempts in the PLMN A
during an occurrence of the window(s) of time, where the first occurrence of
the window of time is from Initial Start Time to Initial Stop Time, the second
occurrence of window of time is from (Initial Stop Time + Wait Time) to
(Initial Stop Time + Wait Time + the window duration), and so on
NOTE: How the network can determine the value of the specific timer before a
Disaster Condition applies is FFS.
### 6.53.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
AMF:
\- Upon receipt of the Registration Request message, with the UE\'s indication
of support of the MINT feature, the AMF sends a new information element that
contains a new timer, called T35xx, to the UE in Registraion Accept message
UE:
\- Includes the support of MINT in its 5GMM capability IE
\- Upon reception of the new timer T35xx in Registration Accept message, it
calculates the \"Window of Time\" as well as the wait time
## 6.54 Solution #54: Preventing 5GSM-level congestion on a PLMN without a
disaster condition
### 6.54.1 Description
#### 6.54.1.1 Introduction
This solution corresponds to KI#7 on Prevention of signalling overload in
PLMNs without Disaster Condition, however the solution focuses on prevention
of 5GSM signalling overload for which the following is listed as a question to
be answered in KI#7:
_How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
congestion on the 5GSM level that can be caused by 5GSM signalling generated
by Disaster Inbound Roamers._
#### 6.54.1.2 Detailed description
This solution provides a different method to address congestion control
compared to existing mechanisms that are reactive and may lead to cases in
which certain UEs have more PDU sessions established while others may have
much less or no PDU session established. This solution differs from existing
mechanism by:
a) making the 5GSM load control mechanism proactive;
b) ensuring that all UEs can request a similar number of PDU sessions (instead
of certain number UEs requesting much more PDU sessions prior to other UEs);
c) still permitting UEs to send 5GSM messages for established PDU sessions
e.g. to perform PDU session modification, which would not be possible if
existing 5GSM BO mechanisms are used as they would prohibit PDU session
modification.
The solution aims to enable a PLMN without a disaster condition to control the
level of 5GSM signalling that can be generated by disaster inbound roamer UEs
which may request the establishment of more than one PDU session following
their registration with the PLMN. The UEs may request more than one PDU
session within short periods of time and this can suddenly increase the load
on the SMFs. Other UEs that request one PDU session may not be successful due
to congestion caused by requests for multiple PDU sessions (by other UEs)
which have congested the SMF(s).
Without a method to evenly and proactively control and prevent congestion on
the 5GSM level, the SMFs in the PLMN may quickly be congested as a result of
the new multiple requests that can be made by each disaster inbound roamer,
which are in addition to requests from non-roaming UEs. Any SMF congestion
would potentially not enable non-roaming UEs, or more/other subsequent
disaster inbound roamer UEs to establish a new PDU session let alone more
sessions.
To proactively prevent 5GSM congestion, to spread the 5GSM signalling load
over time, and to also ensure that most of the UE can (with a higher chance)
establish at least one PDU session in the PLMN without a disaster condition,
the AMF may (as part of the registration procedure) indicate a limit on the
number of PDU sessions that a UE can request. This may be done when such
congestion control mechanism is activated at the AMF e.g. configured by OAM.
The limit represents a maximum number of PDU sessions that the UE can request
to establish, where:
\- this limitation may only be applicable for a specific period of time, if a
timer is provided by the AMF, or
\- this limitation remains until the network explicitly indicates otherwise.
NOTE 1: how the AMF determines this number is implementation specific e.g. as
configured by OAM. However, the AMF is not actively engaged in determining
load conditions in the SMFs in order to set this number.
The AMF may send a NAS message to modify this number based on local policies
or e.g. as configured by OAM.
If (during the registration procedure) a disaster inbound roamer UE receives a
limit on the number of PDU session that can be requested, then the UE shall
not request the establishment of additional PDU sessions when the number of
PDU session that the UE has established is equal to this indicated maximum
limit.
NOTE 2: when the maximum number of PDU session is reached, new requests from
upper layers does not lead to any sort of re-prioritization of established PDU
sessions compared to new requests. As such, upper layer requests for new PDU
sessions are not to be handled.
NOTE 3: receiving a limit on the number of PDU session from the network cannot
be used by the UE to perform PLMN reselection.
If the UE additionally receives a timer value with this limit, the UE starts a
timer with the indicated value and UE enforces this limitation for the
duration of the timer. Otherwise, if no timer value is received, the UE
applies this limitation until explicitly told otherwise by the AMF.
### 6.54.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The following impacts can be identified:
\- AMF
\- Optionally providing a maximum number of PDU sessions that a UE can
establish after registration or modify the restriction
\- Optionally providing a timer value representing the period of time during
which a restriction on the number of PDU session can apply
\- UE
\- Optionally handle an indicated restriction on the total number of PDU
session that the UE can request, and enforce the restriction accordingly
\- Optionally enforce the restriction for a specific period of time only, if
such timer value is provided

## 6.57 Solution #57: Registration to PLMN providing Disaster Roaming service
and to PLMN with Disaster Condition when no roaming interfaces are in place
### 6.57.1 Description
#### 6.57.1.1 Introduction
This solution is Key Issue #4 \"Registration to the roaming PLMN without
Disaster Condition in case of Disaster Condition\".
This solution targets the scenario where there are no roaming interfaces in
place between the PLMN without Disaster Condition (PLMN A) and the PLMN with
Disaster Condition (PLMN D).
The following are the main features of the solution:
\- PLMN A is aware that disaster happened in PLMN D and configured to accept
registration requests from disaster inbound roamers from PLMN D without
primary network authentication.
\- PLMN D allows connectivity service to the disaster inbound roamers only to
restricted destinations, e.g. PLMN D (or an N3IWF in PLMN D).
\- The UE is informed correspondingly, so that the UE initiates registration
with PLMN D via the N3IWF.
\- The SMF/UPF may monitor the UP traffic to determine whether the
registration with PLMN D is successful. If it is determined that the
registration is not successful, the AMF initiates UE deregistration procedure.
#### 6.57.1.2 Detailed solution description
Figure 6.57.1.2-1: UE registering with PLMN D via N3IWF using connectivity
provided from PLMN A
The steps of the solution are as follows:
1\. The UE applies the network selection procedure for disaster condition,
e.g. as described in other Key Issues. As a result, the UE selects to camp on
a cell from PLMN A.
2\. The UE initiates registration procedure with PLMN A. The UE indicates in
the RRC signalling or in the NAS REGISTRATION REQUEST message that the
registration is due to disaster conditions. The NAS REGISTRATION REQUEST
message includes the UE\'s subscription concealed identifier (SUCI), which is
based on the HPLMN SUPI. If PLMN D is not the HPLMN, the UE includes the
identity of PLMN D in the message.
3\. The AMF determines that the registration is by the UE from PLMN D and is
due to disaster conditions in PLMN D. Since the AMF cannot communicate with
PLMN D due to missing roaming agreements, the AMF determines to apply:
a) a registration without performing the primary authentication procedure PLMN
A applies unauthenticated registration which is similar to Emergency
registration with no USIM. The AMF may request the PEI of the UE; or
b) a local registration, which requires the AMF having local configuration
data applicable for disaster conditions (e.g the configuration data may be
configured from the OAM). The AMF performs a NAS security mode command (SMC)
procedure and the UE transmits, in a secure way, its subscriber permanent
identifier (SUPI) to the AMF, where it is stored to be used for signalling
exchange with the SMF for e.g. charging purposes.
NOTE 1: The end-to-end details of security protocol for the NAS message
exchange during the registration is to be determined by SA3. Potential
security risks resulting from accepting registration requests from the
disaster inbound roamers from PLMN D without primary network authentication
are to be checked by SA3.
4\. The AMF sends REGISTRATION ACCEPT message to the UE including an allowed
NSSAI having a single S-NSSAI identifying a network slice that provides
disaster condition services in PLMN A. The AMF indicates also to the UE that
only a single PDU session is allowed which can be used for communication with
destination addresses.
NOTE 2: The UE is supposed to establish PDU session with an N3IWF in PLMN D.
5\. The UE sends a UL NAS TRANSPORT message containing a PDU SESSION
ESTABLISHMENT REQUEST message to the AMF. The AMF selects an SMF (e.g. by
applying the disaster configuration data) and sends an
Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContext request to SMF requesting to establish a PDU
session for the UE. The AMF may indicate that the requested PDU session is due
to disaster condition and also to include PLMN A ID from the SUCI from step 2.
6\. Based on the local configuration data for disaster in the SMF and the
additional indication from the AMF:
a) The SMF decides to apply restricted data connectivity for the requested PDU
session so that communication with destination addresses in PLMN D is only
supported. The SMF restricts the bit rate of the PDU sessions and configures
the UPF to perform deep packet inspection (DPI) to determine if the UE has
successfully registered to PLMN D via the N3IWF.
b) If the local registration is performed so the AMF stores the UE\'s SUPI and
also transmits to the SMF, the SMF uses the SUPI as a key in the signalling
exchange with the charging function (CHF) and to generate charging data
records (CDRs) for this UE.
NOTE 3: SA5 needs to be consulted for the whether charging based on PEI or
SUCI can be performed for an unauthenticated UE of PLMN D while roaming in
PLMN A.
7\. The SMF sends a PDU SESSION ESTABLISHMENT ACCEPT message to the UE. This
message indicates that data connectivity over the PDU session is limited to
destination address of the N3IWF in PLMN D. The UE triggers registration to
PLMN D via the N3IWF.
8\. -- 9. The UE performs 5G registration via untrusted non-3GPP access via
the N3IWF with PLMN D.
10\. The UPF determines whether the UE has successfully registered to PLMN D
via the N3IWF, e.g. by performing deep-packet inspection (DPI) and analysing
the traffic exchange via the PDU session. The UPF informs the SMF with the
result and the SMF forwards this information to the AMF. The SMF decides to
increase the bit rate of the PDU session.
11\. The AMF verifies whether the UE has successfully registered with PLMN D
or the UE has registered to PLMN A in an attempt to misuse PLMN A. In the
latter case, the AMF initiates deregistration procedure.
The SMF in PLMN A may collect offline charging data for the disaster inbound
roamers using the PLMN D ID as key. PLMN D may also collect charging data for
the UE.
NOTE 4: Charging record is collected for all inbound disaster roamers as a
group and not individually.
### 6.57.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
Impacts to AMF:
\- Allowing unauthenticated registration for restricted service for disaster
condition; and
\- initiating deregistration if the UE does not successfully register with
PLMN D.
Impacts to SMF:
\- Establishing a PDU session for restricted connectivity to PLMN D; and
\- configuring the UPF to monitor if the UE misbehaves.
Impacts to CHF:
\- Collecting the charging information in PLMN A if the UE is not
authenticated.
Impacts to UE:
\- After receiving an indication that the registration and PDU sessions are
limited to destination to PLMN D, the UE triggers registration to PLMN D via
the N3IWF.
## 6.58 Solution #58: Transitioning to Connected Mode over non-3GPP access by
a UE in Idle Mode
### 6.58.1 Introduction
This is a solution for the following question of KI#1:
_\- How to deliver the information on the Disaster Condition of a PLMN in an
area to the UE located in the area_
In this solution, PLMN D is the PLMN with Disaster Condition and PLMN A is the
PLMN that accepts inbound disaster roamers.
This solution assumes that
\- the UE is registered in the PLMN D over both 3GPP and non-3GPP Accesses
\- the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE Mode in non-3GPP access
### 6.58.2 Detailed description
Since there is no mechanism defined for \"Paging\" over the non-3GPP Access,
the network (i.e. the AMF) has no means to contact the UE, when it is in 5GMM-
IDLE Mode, in order to deliver the information on a possible disaster
condition. Therefore, the UE needs to transition to 5GMM-CONNECTED Mode in
order for the network to communicate with it.
The above is achieved by the following steps below:
\- when the UE detects that there is an issue with the 3GPP Access (e.g. it
cannot decode any SIB from the 3GPP RAN, it cannot find a suitable cell, RRC
Connection failure, loss of signal in the current cell, etc.), it will
transition to 5GMM-CONNECTED Mode, over the non-3GPP access
\- the AMF will inform the UE of possible disaster condition in PLMN D when
the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED Mode over non-3GPP access
### 6.58.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
UE:
\- Transitions from 5GMM-IDLE to 5GMM_CONNECTED Mode, over the non-3GPP
access, when it detects certain failure in the 3GPP access.
AMF:
\- Needs to inform the UE of possible disaster condition in PLMN D when the UE
is in 5GMM-CONNECTED Mode over non-3GPP access
## 6.59 Solution #59
### 6.59.1 Description
#### 6.59.1.1 Introduction
This solution addresses the following key issue:
Key Issue #1: Notification of Disaster Condition to the UE
#### 6.59.1.2 Detailed description
Before disaster condition occurs, the UE would have performed registration
procedure to receive normal services in its HPLMN or a VPLMN. The UDM via the
AMF informs the UE whether it is allowed, or not allowed, to receive disaster
inbound roaming services using the UE parameters update via UDM control plane
procedure. This indication may be e.g. \"UE is not allowed to receive Disaster
Inbound Roaming service\" or \"UE is allowed to receive Disaster Inbound
Roaming service\".
NOTE 1: the AMF of the serving PLMN does not change this indication that is
received from the UDM but simply forwards the value of this indication using
an appropriate IE of the NAS message, as specified for the UE parameters
update via UDM control plane procedure in 3GPP TS 23.502 [8].
The UDM stores this new indication in the subscription information and
provides it to the AMF as specified for the UE parameters update via UDM
control plane procedure in 3GPP TS 23.502 [8].
The AMF provides this indication as received from UDM, as specified for the UE
parameters update via UDM control plane procedure in 3GPP TS 23.502 [8].
NOTE 2: the expectation of this solution is that a UE which receives the \"UE
is not allowed to receive Disaster Inbound Roaming service\" would be that the
UE does not use disaster roaming service for the entire duration of the
disaster condition.
The UE determines that disaster roaming service can be used when:
a) The UE is notified about a disaster condition (e.g. as described in any of
the solutions from KI#1); and
b) HPLMN has not configured the UE before the disaster condition with \"UE is
not allowed to receive Disaster Inbound Roaming service\".
### 6.59.2 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
The UE is impacted with determination whether it can use disaster roaming
services based on a received indication.
The UDM is impacted to store the subscription information on whether or not
the UE can use disaster roaming services, and provides that to the UE via the
AMF using the UE parameters update via UDM control plane procedure in 3GPP TS
23.502 [8].
## 6.60 Solution #60: Manual PLMN selection during disaster condition
When the disaster condition happens, user will be denied service and the
normal reaction can be to look for a the available networks and the PLMNs are
presented to the usre. As per the current design the PLMNs that support
disaster roaming, which are mostly forbidden PLMNs, will be indicated as
forbidden to the users.
This gives a wrong impression to the user that the PLMN is forbidden and will
not be chosen by the user. So it is porposed to study the following items for
manual PLMN selection
\- During Manual PLMN selection, how the upper layers are informed that some
of the forbidden PLMNs support disaster roaming.
\- What additional information need to be sent to the upper layers when the
PLMNs that support disaster roaming are sent to upper layers.
\- Should the PLMN which is under disaster condition be sent to the upper
layers if it becomes available?
### 6.60.1 Solution description
To solve the key issues described in the above section, when the user performs
a manual PLMN selection,
if the UE finds PLMNs that support disaster roaming and only forbidden PLMNs
are available, the UE shall send an indication along with the PLMN ID that the
PLMN supports disaster roaming to the upper layers. This will help the user
understand that such a PLMN can actually provide service and can be selected.
### 6.60.3 Impacts on existing nodes and functionality
None.
# 7 Evaluations
## 7.1 Evaluation on solutions of Key Issue #1
Solution #1 provides a solution for key issue #1 when:
a) the UE is in coverage of a non-3GPP access;
b) the UE is registered to the same AMF over 3GPP and non-3GPP access when the
Disaster Condition occurs; and
c) the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over the non-3GPP access when the Disaster
Condition occurs.
Solution #1 does not change the existing UE behaviour when the UE is out-of-
coverage of serving PLMN in 3GPP access and Disaster Condition does not apply
to the serving PLMN.
Solution #2 provides a solution for key issue #1:
a) using method 1 when:
1) the UE is in coverage of a non-3GPP access; and
2) the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over non-3GPP access when the Disaster
Condition occurs;
b) using method 2 when:
1) the UE is in coverage of a untrusted non-3GPP access; and
2) the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over untrusted non-3GPP access when the
Disaster Condition occurs;
c) using method 3 when:
1) the UE is in coverage of a trusted non-3GPP access; and
2) the UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over trusted non-3GPP access when the
Disaster Condition occurs; and
d) using method 4 when the UE is in coverage of a trusted non-3GPP access.
Solution #2 does not change the existing UE behaviour when the UE is out-of-
coverage of serving PLMN in 3GPP access and Disaster Condition does not apply
to the serving PLMN.
Solution #3 (which references Solution#9 for details):
a) does not provide a solution for key issue #1 when the RAN node of PLMN
without Disaster Condition is shared by maximum number of PLMNs when the
Disaster Condition start applying for a PLMN;
b) PLMN without Disaster Condition needs to understand core network deployment
of PLMN where the Disaster Condition might happen in future, and PLMN with
Disaster Condition needs to understand RAN deployment of PLMN without Disaster
Condition, as:
1) to setup the N2 connection to appropriate AMF, NG-RAN node of PLMN without
Disaster Condition needs to know AMF(s) of PLMN where the Disaster Condition
might happen in future serving the area of the NG-RAN node - see the clause
6.9.1 stating \"_In order to be able to exchange an NGAP message when a
disaster condition applies or no longer applies, if PLMN~NO\ DC~ has an SLA to
support disaster condition applied to PLMN~DC~ in an area, the NG Setup
procedure is performed between all NG-RAN nodes of PLMN~NO\ DC~ covering the
area and AMF(s) of PLMN~DC~ covering the area in advance._ \"; and
2) to trigger appropriate RAN nodes to become shared RAN nodes, AMF of PLMN
with Disaster Condition needs to know which area the RAN nodes of PLMN without
Disaster Condition serve - see the clause 6.9.1 stating \"_After being
informed, the AMF of PLMN~DC~ notifies to NG-RAN nodes of a PLMN without
disaster condition (PLMN~NO\ DC~) in the disaster area._ \";
c) works only when the UE is in coverage of a NG-RAN cell of a PLMN without
Disaster Condition which can be shared by the PLMN with Disaster Condition.
Solution #3 does not change the existing UE behaviour when the UE is out-of-
coverage of serving PLMN in 3GPP access and Disaster Condition does not apply
to the serving PLMN.
Solution#4 works only when the UE is in coverage of a NG-RAN cell of a PLMN
without Disaster Condition.
Solution #4 does not change the existing UE behaviour when the UE is out-of-
coverage of serving PLMN in 3GPP access and Disaster Condition does not apply
to the serving PLMN.
Solution#5 works only when the UE is in coverage of a NG-RAN cell of a PLMN
without Disaster Condition which is willing to provide disaster roaming to UEs
of PLMN with Disaster Condition.
Solution #5 does not change the existing UE behaviour when the UE is out-of-
coverage of serving PLMN in 3GPP access and Disaster Condition does not apply
to the serving PLMN.
Solution #58 provides a solution for key issue #1 when:
a) the UE is in coverage of a non-3GPP access;
b) the UE is registered to the same AMF over 3GPP and non-3GPP access when the
Disaster Condition occurs; and
c) the UE is in 5GMM-IDLE mode over the non-3GPP access when the Disaster
Condition occurs.
Solution #58 requires the UE to perform actions when the UE is out-of-coverage
of serving PLMN in 3GPP access, regardless whether the Disaster Condition
applies to the serving PLMN. Thus, Solution #58 changes the existing UE
behaviour also when the UE is out-of-coverage of the serving PLMN in 3GPP
access and Disaster Condition does not apply to the serving PLMN. The
additional UE handling performed when the UE is out-of-coverage of the serving
PLMN in 3GPP access and Disaster Condition does not apply to the serving PLMN,
wastes UE\'s battery power and generates unnecessary load on the network over
non-3GPP access.
Solution #59 does not describe how to deliver the information on the Disaster
Condition of a PLMN in an area, to the UE located in the area. Solution #59
expects re-use of other solution for key issue #1.
NOTE: Solution #59 enables HPLMN to configure the UE to restrict usage of
disaster roaming.
Solution #4 broadcasts more broadcast information (indication that Disaster
Condition applies to PLMN D, disaster area (e.g. TA list), and recommended
PLMN(s)) than solution #5 broadcasts (PLMN A can accept Disaster Inbound
Roamers from PLMN D). Information broadcast in solution#5 is sufficient to
enable the UE to select a PLMN providing Disaster Roaming when a Disaster
Condition applies in a PLMN with Disaster Condition.
Given that the Disaster Condition impacts 3GPP access only (as \"_The network
functions except one or more RAN nodes of the PLMN with Disaster Condition can
be assumed to be still operational. One or more RAN nodes of the PLMN with
Disaster Condition are non-operational._.\"), UEs impacted by the Disaster
Condition support 3GPP access and can but do not have to support non-3GPP
access. Thus, informing the UE about Disaster Condition being applicable to a
PLMN:
\- via 3GPP access will enable **all UEs impacted by the Disaster Condition**
to determine that Disaster Condition applies, subject to availabity of
coverage of a PLMN in 3GPP access; and
\- via non-3GPP access will enable **a subset of UEs impacted by the Disaster
Condition** **only** (i.e. UEs supporting 3GPP access and non-3GPP access
only) to determine that Disaster Condition applies, subject to availabity of
non-3GPP access and availablity of a network support for non-3GPP access.
Given that:
\- the RAN sharing based approach requires that PLMN without Disaster
Condition understands core network deployment of PLMN where the Disaster
Condition might happen in future, and PLMN with Disaster Condition understands
RAN deployment of PLMN without Disaster Condition; and
\- the disaster roaming use case addresses PLMNs not normally cooperating
(PLMN without Disaster Condition in the list of forbidden PLMNs of the UE of
PLMN with Disaster Condition);
it is not reasonable to expect such deployment information sharing, and
updates of configuration of the network nodes, between the involved PLMNs,
solely for disaster roaming functionality.
## 7.2 Evaluation on solutions of Key Issue #2
All solutions for KI#2 have no UE impact.
Except Solution #8, all other solutions have RAN impact.
Except Solution #7, all other solutions have CN impact.
Solution #6 relies on O&M operations which need not to be standardized, i.e.
by proprietary implementation. The required RAN impacts and CN impacts can
also be implemented via the O&M operations. This solution involves CT1 and
RAN2 but the main required work is just to document that disaster condition
notification is performed via O&M operations.
Solution #7 uses means out-of-scope of 3GPP for disaster condition
notification between PLMN D and PLMN A and uses O&M operations within PLMN A
to configure PLMN A\'s NG-RAN nodes. Hence, the required RAN impacts can be
implemented via the O&M operations and if the O&M operations needs to be
standardized, then SA5 needs to be involved.
Solution #8 requires deployment of CBE and CBC (and PWS-IWF) or CBCF while
these network entities or NFs are originally deployed for CBS/PWS which is an
optional feature for an operator. Hence, for a regulator or an operator which
has not deployed the CBE and CBC (and PWS-IWF) or CBCF for CBS/PWS, then it
will be a big CAPEX to implement Solution#8 for MINT. This solution involves
CT1 to specify stage 2 message flow and parameters between CBE and CBC (and
PWS-IWF) or CBCF, and between CBC (and PWS-IWF) or CBCF and AMF for \"disaster
roaming PLMN and area list\" handling. This solution also involves CT4 to
specify stage 3 SBI service operations related to \"disaster roaming PLMN and
area list\" handling.
Solution #9 relies on the RAN sharing between PLMN D and PLMN A and the UE is
still served by the same PLMN D via the shared RAN of PLMN A. Solution #9
further requires the setup of N2 connection between NG-RAN nodes of PLMN A and
one or more AMFs of PLMN D in advance before disaster condition applies to
PLMN D in an area which may waste NGAP resources. This solution involves RAN3
to setup N2 connection between the AMF of the PLMN D and the NG-RAN of PLMN A
for disaster condition notification. There is no CT1 involvement as how the
AMF of PLMN D is notified for disaster condition is out of the scope of 3GPP.
## 7.3 Evaluation on solutions of Key Issue #3
The solutions for this key issue can be classified into 5 categories as below:
Category A: Pre-provisioned information before disaster condition
Solution #11 proposes Disaster Roaming Service (DRS)-supported PLMN list. This
is a list of PLMNs where disaster roaming is allowed for the UE. The list is
provisioned and kept up-to-date by a PLMN (say PLMN D), before disaster
occurs, using NAS signalling. If the list does not contain all the forbidden
PLMNs in the country of the serving PLMN, there is no guarantee that a PLMN in
the DRS-supported PLMN list will actually provide the disaster roaming service
when the disaster condition starts applying for the serving PLMN. Solution#11
also requires that NG-RAN cell of PLMN that provides disaster roaming shall
broadcast the list of PLMNs for which disaster roaming is offered (similar to
Solution #13). The UE determines the accessibility of the PLMN without
Disaster Condition based on a combination of broadcast information (list of
PLMNs) and Disaster Roaming Service (DRS)-supported PLMN list provided to UE
in security protected signalling. This solution requires that PLMN with
Disaster Condition performs notification of applicability of Disaster
Condition and of disaster area to one or more PLMNs which have been configured
in DRS-supported PLMN list of at least one UE of PLMN with Disaster Condition
located in the disaster area and that at least one of those PLMNs having at
least one functioning NG-RAN node offer disaster roaming to the UEs of PLMN
with Disaster Condition. Sol#11 also enables PLMN D to provide the UE with the
DRS-supported PLMN list over non-3GPP access at time of Disaster Condition
applying to PLMN D. However, this is limited to scenarios for example, when
the UE supports non-3GPP access and is in coverage of a non-3GPP access.
Solution #15 introduces \"List of PLMNs to be used in disaster condition\" to
be provisioned by the serving PLMN prior to a disaster condition. The pre-
provisioning can be in the USIM, stored in the ME or provided over NAS
signalling. UE relies on indication from system information for identifying
whether a PLMN offers disaster roaming, which are always sent without
ciphering or integrity protection. This solution requires that PLMN with
Disaster Condition performs notification of applicability of Disaster
Condition and of disaster area to all PLMNs which has been configured in
\"List of PLMNs to be used in disaster condition\" of at least one UE of PLMN
with Disaster Condition located in the disaster area and that all those PLMNs
having at least one functioning NG-RAN node in the disaster area offer
disaster roaming to the UEs in disaster area. The provisioning of \"List of
PLMNs to be used in disaster condition\" is performed using NAS signalling,
which can be integrity protected if the authentication has been successful.
The \"List of PLMNs to be used in disaster condition\" applicable to the UE
can also be provided by a PLMN without Disaster Condition, during a rejected
registration in that PLMN but only if the following conditions are satisfied:
i) PLMN with Disaster Condition provides the \"List of PLMNs to be used in
disaster condition\" to the PLMNs without Disaster Condition,
ii) the PLMNs without Disaster Condition provide the \"List of PLMNs to be
used in disaster condition\" to the UE without changes,
iii) the UE selects and attempts to register in the PLMN without Disaster
Condition (i.e. manual PLMN selection is used, the PLMN without Disaster
Condition is not in the UE\'s list of forbidden PLMNs or the PLMN without
Disaster Condition is in UE\'s \"List of PLMNs to be used in disaster
condition\"),
iv) the UE is successfully authenticated in the PLMN without Disaster
Condition and
v) the PLMN without Disaster Condition activates integrity protection of the
NAS messages.
In these two solutions, UE makes use of a pre-provisioned list of PLMNs to
(prioritise and) select a PLMN offering disaster roaming. The pre-provisioned
list can also be provisioned over NAS signalling. It is possible in certain
scenarios that all PLMNs in the pre-provisioned list are damaged by the same
disaster - in such a case, even if PLMN D negotiates after disaster with
another PLMN to provide the disaster roaming (called PLMN Az) to UEs of PLMN
D, the UEs of PLMN D will be unable to select PLMN Az. If the list contains
all forbidden PLMNs in the country of the serving PLMN, the list can be long.
Solution #16: Pre-provisioned disaster roaming access identities
This solution addresses whole of KI#3 and part of KI#7. The solution proposes
use of new access identities (in addition to Access Identity 3) provisioned by
the network to be used by the UEs at the time of disaster roaming. The PLMNs
offering disaster roaming for a certain access identity is required to set the
corresponding bit in _uac-BarringForAccessIdentity_ to indicate that a UE that
has chosen that access identity is allowed to select the PLMN. The information
is provided by HPLMN, so when the UE roams, the HPLMN needs to provide the
access identities appropriate for the visited country. Solution requires a
PLMN offering disaster roaming to accept disaster inbound roamers which use
access identity for which the bit in the uac-BarringForAccessIdentity is set
to zero, from any PLMN with disaster condition in a given disaster area.
Setting a bit corresponding to an access identity to zero implies that network
can provide access without subject to barringFactor to UEs using that Access
Identity.
Category B: System information broadcast at the time of disaster condition
Sol#13 identifies the information to be broadcast by the PLMN offering
disaster roaming (a disaster roaming PLMN List). This solution requires that
PLMN with Disaster Condition performs notification of applicability of
Disaster Condition and of disaster area to one or more PLMNs which can provide
disaster roaming in the area, those PLMNs being selected by the PLMN with
Disaster Conditon, and that at least one of those PLMNs having at least one
functioning NG-RAN node in the disaster area offering disaster roaming to the
UEs in disaster area.
Sol#12 proposes similar information as in Sol#13 and additionally proposes a
split of the information in various SIB messages. This solution requires that
PLMN with Disaster Condition performs notification of applicability of
Disaster Condition and of disaster area to one or more PLMNs which can provide
disaster roaming in the area, those PLMNs being selected by the PLMN with
Disaster Conditon, and that at least one of those PLMNs having at least one
NG-RAN node in the disaster area offering disaster roaming to the UEs in
disaster area.
These solutions are similar in content of broadcast information they are
proposing. Sol#12 had additional analysis on how the information could be
split in various SIB messages to limit the impact from new system information
broadcast to disaster roamers. For PLMN selection, UE relies on information
from system information messages which are always sent without ciphering or
integrity protection.
Category C: PWS broadcast at the time of disaster condition
Sol#14 proposes a new PWS message in the PLMN providing disaster roaming to
inform UEs. The PWS message indicates a list of PLMNs for which disaster
roaming is offered. This solution requires that PLMN with Disaster Condition
performs notification of applicability of Disaster Condition and of disaster
area to CBE and CBE notifies one or more PLMNs which can provide disaster
roaming in the area, those PLMNs being selected by CBE, and that at least one
of those PLMNs having at least one NG-RAN node in the disaster area offering
disaster roaming to the UEs in disaster area. The PWS SIB broadcast has to
continue for the duration the PLMN is offering disaster roaming. This implies
that all UEs (own subscribers and non-disaster roamers) are required to read
the PWS SIB, which is an existing requirement.
Category D: Dynamic sharing of RAN
Sol#10: proposes the concept of dynamic shared RAN. In this solution, UE finds
the PLMN it is interested in (HPLMN or VPLMN) as one of the shared PLMNs in
another cell. This solution requires that all PLMNs have a redundant N2 and N3
link with another NG-RAN node providing overlapping coverage in areas where
disaster roaming service has to be offered. This implies the following:
\- NG-RAN node of PLMN without Disaster Condition needs to know AMF(s), of
PLMN where the Disaster Condition might happen in future, serving the area of
the NG-RAN node to setup the N2 connection to appropriate AMF.
\- AMF of PLMN with Disaster Condition needs to know which area the RAN nodes,
of PLMN without Disaster Condition, serve to trigger appropriate RAN nodes to
become shared RAN nodes Category E: Provisioning of information over non-3GPP
AN at the time of disaster
Parts of solution#11, solution#1 and solution#2 (Methods 1, 2 and 3) address
Key Issue#3 in a similar way. These solutions propose that a list of PLMNs
which provide disaster roaming can be provided over non-3GPP access network by
the PLMN with disaster condition or the PLMN without disaster condition at the
time of disaster. However, this is limited to scenarios, for example, when the
UE and the PLMN support non-3GPP access and UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over
non-3GPP access. Furthermore, if the PLMN without Disaster Condition provides
the list of PLMNs which provide disaster roaming, it requires that:
i) PLMN with Disaster Condition provides the \"List of PLMNs to be used in
disaster condition\" to the PLMNs without Disaster Condition; and
ii) the PLMNs without Disaster Condition provide the \"List of PLMNs to be
used in disaster condition\" to the UE without changes.
Additionally solution#2 Method 4 specifies a way in which TNAP of PLMN with
disaster condition or PLMN without disaster condition informs UE about the
PLMN(s) that provide disaster roaming. This is applicable in cases where UE is
in coverage of an AP that supports ANQP. The advertise messages may not be
ciphered or may not be integrity protected if the UE receives this in pre-
associated state. Furthermore, if the PLMN without Disaster Condition provides
the list of PLMNs which provide disaster roaming, it requires that:
i) PLMN with Disaster Condition provides the \"List of PLMNs to be used in
disaster condition\" to the PLMNs without Disaster Condition; and
ii) the PLMNs without Disaster Condition provide the \"List of PLMNs to be
used in disaster condition\" to the UE without changes.
**Observation 1:**
Category A solutions depend on UEs being pre-configured with information
required for disaster roaming (List of PLMNs for disaster roaming in
Solution#11 and Solution#15 / Access Identities allocated for disaster roaming
in Solution#16). This category of solutions enables the HPLMN, based on
subscription, to configure UEs to perform disaster roaming following a
disaster condition.
**Observation 2:**
Category B solutions depend only on SIB broadcast messages for informing UEs
about PLMNs offering disaster roaming. This category of solutions offer more
flexibility to the PLMNs to react according to the current disaster situation
than Category A solutions where each UE has to be provided updated
configurations.
**Observation 3:**
Category C solution is limited by support of PWS functionality in both PLMN
and UE.
**Observation 4:**
Category D solution requires that AMF in PLMNs create, test and maintain
redundant N2 and N3 links with at least one another NG-RAN node providing
overlapping coverage.
**Observation 5:**
Category E solutions apply to networks and UEs that support non-3GPP access.
## 7.4 Evaluation on solutions of Key Issue #4
This clause presents an evaluation of the solutions that address only the
following specific aspect of KI#4:
_\- How a Disaster Roaming PLMN can limit the area of service to Inbound
Disaster Roamers to the region where Disaster Condition applies_
Both solutions #19 and 17# have a common solution which reuses existing
mechanims to confine the UE to a certain area by determining a UE registration
area such that it corresponds to the area of the disaster condition. The
solutions require that the AMF determines the registration area for a UE based
on the area of the disaster condtion.
Solution #17 also provides the AMF with the option to use the service area
list that can be used in the case when the registration area contains TAIs
that are more than the TAIs of the area that is considered to correspond to
the area of the disaster condition. Again this does not have new impacts to
the AMF or the UE, noting that the AMF only needs to determine the service
area restriction based on the area of the disaster condition. This implies
that the UE will not be able to get service when the UE is in a non-allowed
area.
Solution #17 enables further provides the AMF with the option to have finer
control and determination of the area where the UE can get disaster roaming
service by defining a service area based on a set of cells. This requires the
AMF to provide a set of cell identities where this set would correspond to the
area with the disaster condition. The UE which receives this information is
also required to determine whether it should be in state 5GMM-
REGISTERED.NORMAL-SERVICE or 5GMM-REGISTERED.NON-ALLOWED-SERVICE. The
determination in the UE is based a check of the cell identity on which the UE
is camped, where the UE gets this information from the AS layer by
implementation specific means.
Solution #17 enables the UE to optionally perform PLMN search when the UE
enters 5GMM-REGISTERED.NON-ALLOWED-SERVICE based on check of the cell identity
on which the UE is camped and is in 5GMM-IDLE mode. If the UE does not perform
PLMN search in this situation, the UE will not be able to get service. If the
UE is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode after the UE enters 5GMM-REGISTERED.NON-ALLOWED-
SERVICE based on check of the cell identity on which the UE is camped, the UE
will not be able to get service.
The use of the service area restriction based on TAIs, as described above for
solution #17, can lead to cases in which the UE may move into a non-allowed
area that is considered to be non-allowed because of the serving PLMN\'s
service area restrictions that are not related to confining the UE\'s service
area during disaster roaming. In this case, the UE that implements PLMN search
after entering 5GMM-REGISTERED.NON-ALLOWED-SERVICE, and is in 5GMM-IDLE mode,
can lead to unnecessary PLMN search as the UE would still be in an area that
corresponds to the disaster area. If this happens, then increased UE power
consumption would occur from this unnecessary PLMN search.
While solutions #17 and #19 relate to the determination of the registration
area, etc, which is relevant to the AMF and the UE, solution #52 is relevant
to the AMF and the RAN and as such is independent of, and complementary to,
solutions #17 and #19.
Solution #52 requires the AMF to use the existing mobility restriction list
and to set the contents of the service area (e.g. allowed area) such that it
corresponds to the area of the disaster condition and to indicate that EPS is
not allowed as a core network for the UE. Other than this, solution #52 does
not introduce any new impacts on the N2 protocol interface.
Solutions #18 #20, #57 do not address this aspect.
This clause presents an evaluation of the solutions that address only the
following specific aspects of KI#4.
_\- How a registration procedure initiated by Inbound Disaster Roamer is
performed;_
_\- What other information, if any, is needed to be transferred between the UE
and the network during the initial registration procedure.Solutions #18, #19,
#20 and #57 tries to solve the above issues identified in KI#4_
Solution #18 assumes that when a disaster condition applies, an NG-RAN node of
a PLMN without disater condition becomes a shared RAN between PLMN without a
disaster condition and a PLMN where a disaster condition applies. With this
assumption, there is no need to change the registration procedure in the UE
and in the network.
Solution #19 proposes the usage of a new registration type when the UE
performs a registration update procedure in the PLMN that supports disaster
roaming following a disaster condition in the previously severd PLMN. The new
registration type will help the AMF to identify the UE that is performing
registration procedure for disaster roaming.
Solution #20 proposes that when the UE performs a registration procedure for
disaster roaming, if the UE includes 5G-GUTI in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message and does not indicate the PLMN with Disaster Condition in the
REGISTRATION REQUEST message, the network uses the PLMN ID in the UE\'s
5G-GUTI to determine the PLMN that was serving the UE which had disaster
condition. If UE does not have a 5G-GUTI assigned by the PLMN with disaster
condition, and the PLMN with disaster condition is not the HPLMN or the PLMN
with disaster condition is HPLMN and the UE does not provide SUCI, then the UE
indicates the PLMN with disaster condition in the REGISTRATION REQUEST
message. Indication of the PLMN with disaster condition in the REGISTRATION
REQUEST message (when the UE does not have a 5G-GUTI assigned by the PLMN with
disaster condition, and the PLMN with disaster condition is not the HPLMN or
the PLMN with disaster condition is HPLMN and the UE does not provide SUCI)
will help the AMF to identify the PLMN with Disaster Condition that would have
served UE if the disaster condition had not happened. This helps the AMF to
decide on whether to provide disaster roaming service to the UE. AMF also
checks whether the TA where the UE is registering is part of the disaster area
of the UE\'s PLMN with disaster condition. If AMF determines that the PLMN
with Disaster Condition in the registration request, SUCI or 5G-GUTI identify
a PLMN with disaster condition and the TA is part of disaster area of the PLMN
with disaster condition, then AMF handles the registration request.
Solution #57 proposes the usage of a new registration type in the registration
request message which is similar to #19.This solution also proposes the usage
of new indication in RRC signalling that caries the registration request to
indicate that the RRC signalling is due to disaster roaming. This solution
also proposes the usage of the PLMN ID in the 5G-GUTI by the network to
determine the PLMN that had disaster condition. If the PLMN that went into
disaster is not the HPLMN of the UE, then this solution proposes to include
the identity of PLMN that went into disaster condition in the registration
request towards the network.
Observation 1: Solution #19 and solution #57 proposes the usage of a new
registration type in the registration request message sent by the UE to the
network trying to register for disater roaming. This new indication will help
the network to identify the that the UE\'s registration request is for
disaster roaming. This indication is also helpful for the network in
identifying the UEs that support the MINT functionality thereby providing
service to those UEs. This solution does not provide the network with enough
information about the PLMN that has gone into disaster condition.
Observation 2: Solution #20 and solution #57 proposes the ways for the network
(during registration update procedure for disaster roaming) to get information
on the PLMN that was serving the UE or the PLMN that would have served the UE
if the disaster condition had not happened. This information is useful for the
network to determine whether disaster roaming service needs to be provided to
the UE.Solution #20 also adds an additional check to see if the UE is
registering in a TA which is part of the disaster area of the PLMN indicated
by the UE This solution for some cases ( when the UE is registered on a PLMN
and has a valid 5G-GUTI) does not differentiate whether the registration
update request from a UE is due to disaster roaming or if the registration
request is from a legacy UE.
## 7.5 Evaluation on solutions of Key Issue #5
Solution #21:
\- the solution refers to solutions of KI#3 for discovery of PLMNs offering
disaster roaming.
\- prohibits the UE in automatic selection to select available PLMN D when the
UE is informed that Disaster Condition applies for PLMN D, with exception of
the PLMN D being available in satellite access. If the UE is located at the
border of disaster area, this prevents the UE from selecting and camping on
PLMN D on PLMN D\'s cells located outside of the disaster area. Furthermore,
this violates 3GPP TS 22.261 [3] statement \"_The 3GPP system shall be able to
provide means to enable a UE to access PLMNs in a forbidden PLMN list if a
Disaster condition applies and no other PLMN is available except for PLMNs in
the forbidden PLMN list._ \".
\- specifies that in automatic selection the UE considers PLMNs offering
disaster roaming in bullet iv and v of 3GPP TS 23.122 [7] clause 4.4.3.1.1,
i.e. with higher priority that any non-forbidden PLMN in bullet iv and v of
3GPP TS 23.122 [7] clause 4.4.3.1.1. This violates 3GPP TS 22.261 [3]
statement \"_The 3GPP system shall be able to provide means to enable a UE to
access PLMNs in a forbidden PLMN list if a Disaster condition applies and no
other PLMN is available except for PLMNs in the forbidden PLMN list._ \".

automatic selection based on disaster roaming assistance information, if
provisioned in the UE, or UE implementation.
\- if the selected PLMN is in the UE\'s \"forbidden PLMNs\" list, the UE does
not remove the PLMN from the UE\'s \"forbidden PLMNs\" list.- describes
solution only when the PLMN with Disaster Condition is UE\'s RPLMN.
Solution #22:
\- the solution does not refer to solutions of KI#3 for discovery of PLMNs
offering disaster roaming. Instead, the solution enables selection of PLMN A
offering disaster roaming to a UEs of PLMN D with Disaster Condition
broadcasts a list of PLMNs D for which the broadcasting PLMN A offers disaster
roaming. Such handling has characteristics similar to characteristics of
solutions #12 identified in evaluation of KI#3.
\- enables the UE in automatic selection to select available PLMN D when the
UE is informed that Disaster Condition applies for PLMN D. If the UE is
located at the border of disaster area, this enables the UE to select and camp
on PLMN D on PLMN D\'s cells located outside of the disaster area.

system shall be able to provide means to enable a UE to access PLMNs in a

available except for PLMNs in the forbidden PLMN list._ \".
\- does not specify priority of PLMNs offering disaster roaming in automatic
selection, in relation to the bullets of 3GPP TS 23.122 [7] clause 4.4.3.1.1
\- does not specify ordering in automatic selection when there are several
PLMNs offering disaster roaming.

being UE\'s RPLMN but does not specify how to select PLMN with Disaster
Condition when the UE does not have RPLMN or UE\'s RPLMN is not available,
there is no available non-forbidden PLMN and there are several non-forbidden
PLMNs with Disaster Condition.
Solution #23:
\- the solution refers to solutions of KI#3 for discovery of PLMNs offering
disaster roaming.
\- enables the UE in automatic selection to select available PLMN D when the
UE is informed that Disaster Condition applies for PLMN D. If the UE is

access PLMNs in a forbidden PLMN list if a Disaster condition applies and no
other PLMN is available except for PLMNs in the forbidden PLMN list._ \".

available non-forbidden PLMN and there are several non-forbidden PLMNs with
Disaster Condition.

characteristics similar to characteristics of solution #15 identified in
evaluation of KI#3.

## 7.6 Evaluation on solutions of Key Issue #6
All solutions for KI#6 have UE impact.
Except Solution #28, #33 and #35, all other solutions for KI#6 have no RAN
impact, Solution #33 has possible RAN impact based on solution for KI#2.
Except Solution #30, #34 and #35, all other solutions for KI#6 have CN impact.
Solution #27 requires the UE to register to a PLMN over non-3GPP access. The
registered PLMN over non-3GPP access can be the same PLMN as or different PLMN
from the PLMN with Disaster Condition. Solution #27 further assumes that the
non-3GPP access network is not affected by the Disaster Condition for the case
that the UE remains registered to the PLMN with Disaster Condition over the
non-3GPP access. Also for the case when the UE does not register to another
PLMN offering disaster service over the 3GPP access, the solution requires the
UE to enable the lower layers of the 3GPP access if the UE had disabled the
lower layers of the 3GPP access, where the disabling of the lower layers of
the 3GPP access was optional for the UE.
Solution #28 provides two ways for disaster no longer applicable notification
to the UEs: (1) RRC based notification and (2) NAS based notification. RRC
based notification requires a new broadcast indication (e.g. in SIB) to
indicate that a Disaster Condition in PLMN D applies or not. NAS based
notification requires a new NAS indication (e.g. a new 5GMM cause value
\"disaster condition in other PLMN no longer applies\") to the UE. NAS based
notification can be performed over both the 3GPP access and over the non-3GPP
access of PLMN A. There is no paging for NAS based notification for UEs in
idle mode. Based on this new indication, the UE still stays in the registered
state when performing PLMN selection for return back. RRC based notification
only involves RAN2 while NAS based notification only involves CT1.
Solution #29 proivdes one way for disaster no longer applicable notification
to the UEs, i.e. NAS based notification. This solution reuses the existing
handling for the case when the UE is accessing a forbidden PLMN, i.e. the
network provides an existing 5GMM cause value #11 (PLMN not allowed) as an
indication that a Disaster Condition in PLMN D is no longer applicable. There
is no paging for UEs in idle mode. As per existing UE handling, the UE will
enter the deregistered state when performing PLMN selection for return back.
No new indication is required for Solution #29.
Solution #30 and Solution #34 rely on UE performing the periodic PLMN scan in
VPLMN which is an existing mechanism for the roaming. There is no need for the
network to provide an indication that a Disaster Condition in PLMN D is no
longer applicable as the UE can detect this by performing PLMN scan. However,
these solutions cannot guarantee the UE can detect the Disaster Condition in
PLMN D is no longer applicable in time and hence the UE cannot return back to
PLMN D quickly after the Disaster Condition is no longer applicable. There is
no impact on both NG-RAN and 5GCN of PLMN A.
Solution #31 provides one way for disaster no longer applicable notification
to the UEs, i.e. NAS based notification. This solution requires a new NAS
indication (e.g. a new 5GMM cause value \"Disaster Condition no longer
applicable\") to the UE. For UEs in idle mode, the network either pages the UE
or waits until the UE enters 5GMM-CONNECTED state. Based on this new
indication, the UE will enter the deregistered state when performing PLMN
selection for return back.
Solution #32 provides one way for disaster no longer applicable notification
to the UEs, i.e. NAS based notification. This solution requires a new NAS
indication (e.g. a new 5GMM cause value \"Disaster Condition no longer
applicable\") to the UE. For UEs in idle mode, the network needs to page the
UE. Based on this new indication, the UE will enter the deregistered state
when performing PLMN selection for return back.
Solution #33 provides one way for disaster no longer applicable notification
to the UEs, i.e. NAS based notification. This solution requires a new NAS
indication (e.g. a new 5GMM cause value \"Disaster Condition in other PLMN no
longer applies\") to the UE. There is no paging for NAS based notification for
UEs in idle mode. Based on this new indication, the UE still stays in the
registered state when performing PLMN selection for return back.
Solution #35 relies on the RAN sharing between PLMN D and PLMN A and the UE is
still served by the same PLMN D via the shared RAN of PLMN A. For disaster no
longer applicable notification to the UEs, Solution #35 relies on the shared
RAN to stop broadcast barring information related to Access Identity 3. This
solution only involves RAN2 and no new work to be done in CT1.
Solutions #28, #30, #34, #35 provide solution for a UE in 5GMM-IDLE mode over
3GPP access.
Solutions #28, #29, #31, #32, #33 provide solution for a UE transiting from
5GMM-IDLE mode to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access.
Solutions #28, #29, #31, #32 #33, #35 provide solution for a UE in 5GMM-
CONNECTED mode over 3GPP access.
Solution #27 provides solution for a UE not registered over 3GPP access for
duration of the Disaster Condition of the PLMN with Disaster Condition.
Solutions #28, #30, #33, #34, #35 enable preserving PDU sessions of the UE
when moving from the PLMN providing disaster roaming to the PLMN previously
with Disaster Condition, subject to agreement between the PLMN providing
Disaster Roaming and the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition.
Solutions #29, #31, #32 do not enable preserving PDU sessions of the UE when
moving from the PLMN providing disaster roaming to the PLMN previously with
Disaster Condition.
Solution #27 does not state whether it enables or not preserving PDU sessions
of the UE when moving from the PLMN providing disaster roaming to the PLMN
previously with Disaster Condition, subject to agreement between the PLMN
providing Disaster Roaming and the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition.
## 7.7 Evaluation on solutions of Key Issue #7
**[Solution #1:]{.underline}**
a) only addresses the following question of Key Issue #7:
_How to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition, so
as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the number of UEs
attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit_
b) provides a solution for the question above of Key Issue#7 if all of the
following conditions are met:
1) the UE:
i) supports the non-3GPP access in addition to the 3GPP access;
ii) supports connecting to N3WIF;
iii) was registered to the same PLMN over 3GPP and non-3GPP access before (and
when) the disaster condition occurred; and
iv) is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over the non-3GPP access; and
2) the PLMN with Disaster Condition:
i) has N3IWF; and
ii) has a non-3GPP access network which is not affected by the Disaster
Condition.
As such, Solution #1 cannot be the only solution to progress to normative
phase and other solutions also need to be specified for fully address Key
Issue #7;
c) enables the network to provide the UE with an \"expected duration of
disaster\" timer. This timer may not always be accurate with respect to the
time when the disaster condition actually ends;
d) enables the network to provide the UE with a list of PLMNs, optionally
prioritized, for disaster roaming, which is similar to what is proposed in
Solutions #39, #41 and #43; and
e) relies on providing a \"wait timer\" to the UE to stagger the arrival of
UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition, which is similar to what is
proposed in Solutions #39, #43 and #53.
**[Solution #16:]{.underline}**
a) only addresses the following questions of Key Issue #7:
_How to distribute the subscribers of the PLMN with Disaster Condition between
the PLMNs without Disaster Condition available in the area where the Disaster
Condition applies, so as to share the load as evenly as possible between the
PLMNs without Disaster Condition; and_
_How to use new Access Identity 3 for the purpose of Disaster Inbound Roamer
access control and signalling overload prevention in the PLMNs without
Disaster Condition;_
As such, Solution #16 is not sufficient to fully address Key Issue #7 and must
be supplemented by other solutions addressing the remaining questions; and
b) enables pre-configuration in the UE, or provisioning of the UE over NAS
signalling, with the information required to distribute the UEs between the
PLMNs which can accommodate Disaster Inbound Roamers;
c) makes use of existing SIB parameters;
d) requires SA1 agreement to allocate new Access Identity values for disaster
roaming; and
e) requires RAN2 agreement to update the semantics of uac-
BarringForAccessIdentity.
**[Solution #36:]{.underline}**
a) only addresses the following question of Key Issue #7:
_How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
Disaster Inbound Roamers from attempting registration on the PLMN when the
PLMN can no longer accept Disaster Inbound Roamers due to congestion;_
As such, Solution #36 is not sufficient to fully address Key Issue #7 and must
be supplemented by other solutions addressing the remaining questions; andb)
relies on rejecting Disaster Inbound Roamers with a new 5GMM cause value
indicating that the resources are not sufficient for the Disaster Inbound
Roamers that triggers the UE to look for another PLMN, which is similar to
what is proposed in Solution #39.
**[Solution #37:]{.underline}**
a) only addresses the following question of Key Issue #7:
_How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
Disaster Inbound Roamers from attempting registration on the PLMN when the
PLMN can no longer accept Disaster Inbound Roamers due to congestion;_
As such, Solution #37 is not sufficient to fully address Key Issue #7 and must
be supplemented by other solutions addressing the remaining questions;
b) requires RAN2 agreement to create a new RRC establishment cause; and
c) does not enable the UE to know that the rejection is due to congestion
caused by the arrival of Disaster Inbound Roamers.
**[Solution #38:]{.underline}**
a) only addresses the following questions of Key Issue #7:
_How to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition, so
as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the number of UEs
attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit;_
_How to use new Access Identity 3 for the purpose of Disaster Inbound Roamer
access control and signalling overload prevention in the PLMNs without
Disaster Condition;_
_How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
Disaster Inbound Roamers from attempting registration on the PLMN when the
PLMN can no longer accept Disaster Inbound Roamers due to congestion; and_
_How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
congestion on the 5GSM level that can be caused by 5GSM signalling generated
by Disaster Inbound Roamers._
As such, Solution #38 is not sufficient to fully address Key Issue #7 and must
be supplemented by other solutions addressing the remaining questions;
b) proposes to change the way that barring is applied for Access Identities,
by associating a barring factor with Access Identity 3, whereas per current
RAN2 specifications, barring factors are only associated with Access
Categories. This requires RAN2 agreement.
**[Solution #39:]{.underline}**
a) only addresses the following questions of Key Issue #7:
_How to distribute the subscribers of the PLMN with Disaster Condition between
the PLMNs without Disaster Condition available in the area where the Disaster
Condition applies, so as to share the load as evenly as possible between the
PLMNs without Disaster Condition;_
_How to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition, so
as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the number of UEs
attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit; and_
_How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
Disaster Inbound Roamers from attempting registration on the PLMN when the
PLMN can no longer accept Disaster Inbound Roamers due to congestion._
As such, Solution #39 is not sufficient to fully address Key Issue #7 and must
be supplemented by other solutions addressing the remaining questions;
b) enables the network to provide the UE with a prioritized or weighted list
of PLMNs for disaster roaming, which is similar to what is proposed in
Solutions #1, #41 and #43;
c) relies on providing a \"disaster roaming wait range\" to the UE to stagger
the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition, which is similar
to what is proposed in Solutions #1, #43 and #53;
d) proposes a new 5GMM cause value that can be used by the PLMNs without
disaster when they encounter congestion due to the arrival of Disaster Inbound
Roamers and that trigger the UE to look for another PLMN, which is similar to
what is proposed in Solution #36; and
e) proposes the use of a broadcast indicator to indicate that the PLMN can
accommodate / no longer accommodate Disaster Inbound Roamers, which requires
feedback from RAN2 and SA3.
**[Solution #40:]{.underline}**
a) only addresses the following questions of Key Issue #7:
_How to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition, so
as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the number of UEs
attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit;_
_How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
Disaster Inbound Roamers from attempting registration on the PLMN when the
PLMN can no longer accept Disaster Inbound Roamers due to congestion; and_
_How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
congestion on the 5GSM level that can be caused by 5GSM signalling generated
by Disaster Inbound Roamers._
As such, Solution #40 is not sufficient to fully address Key Issue #7 and must
be supplemented by other solutions addressing the remaining questions; and
b) proposes to change the way that barring is applied for Access Identities,
by introducing a new offset value to the unified access control barring
information. This requires RAN2 agreement. This solution enables the disaster
roaming PLMN to setup stricter barring factor only affecting Disaster Inbound
Roamer UE for any access category it may use while in that PLMN.
**[Solution #41:]{.underline}**
a) only addresses the following question of Key Issue #7:
_How to distribute the subscribers of the PLMN with Disaster Condition between
the PLMNs without Disaster Condition available in the area where the Disaster
Condition applies, so as to share the load as evenly as possible between the
PLMNs without Disaster Condition;_
As such, Solution #41 is not sufficient to fully address Key Issue #7 and must
be supplemented by other solutions addressing the remaining questions; and
b) enables the network to provide the UE with a prioritized list of
recommended PLMNs for disaster roaming, which is similar to what is proposed
in Solutions #1, #39 and #43.
**[Solution #42:]{.underline}**
a) only addresses the following question of Key Issue #7:
_How to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition, so
as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the number of UEs
attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit;_
_How to use new Access Identity 3 for the purpose of Disaster Inbound Roamer
access control and signalling overload prevention in the PLMNs without
Disaster Condition; and_
_How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
Disaster Inbound Roamers from attempting registration on the PLMN when the
PLMN can no longer accept Disaster Inbound Roamers due to congestion._
As such, Solution #42 is not sufficient to fully address Key Issue #7 and must
be supplemented by other solutions addressing the remaining questions; and
b) relies on the creation of a new Access Category, which is subject to SA1
agreement. Additionally, for an Access Category other than the Access Category
X, access attempts from Disaster Inbound Roamers and access attempts from non-
Disaster Inbound Roamers are subject to the same barring factor.
**[Solution #43:]{.underline}**
a) only addresses the following question of Key Issue #7:
_How to distribute the subscribers of the PLMN with Disaster Condition between
the PLMNs without Disaster Condition available in the area where the Disaster
Condition applies, so as to share the load as evenly as possible between the
PLMNs without Disaster Condition;_
_How to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition, so
as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the number of UEs
attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit;_
As such, Solution #43 is not sufficient to fully address Key Issue #7 and must
be supplemented by other solutions addressing the remaining questions;
b) enables the network to provide the UE with a prioritized list of PLMNs for
disaster roaming, which is similar to what is proposed in Solutions #1, #39
and #41; and
c) relies on providing a \"minimum wait time\" to the UE to stagger the
arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition, which is similar to
what is proposed in Solutions #1, #39 and #53.
**[Solution #53:]{.underline}**
a) only addresses the following question of Key Issue #7:
_How to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs without Disaster Condition, so
as to spread out registration attempts over time and keep the number of UEs
attempting to register simultaneously within a manageable limit;_
As such, Solution #53 is not sufficient to fully address Key Issue #7 and must
be supplemented by other solutions addressing the remaining questions; and
b) enables configuring the UE (before the Disaster Condition occurs) with a
timer, which the UE will use along with its unique ID (e.g. SUPI/PEI) to
compute a series of windows of time during which the UE is allowed to attempt
registration upon arriving in the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition,
hence relies on putting restrictions on the time when the UE can initiate
registration as well as reattempt registration in the PLMN without Disaster
Condition, which is similar to what is proposed in Solutions #1, #39 and #43.
**[Solution #54:]{.underline}**
a) only addresses the following question of Key Issue #7:
_How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
congestion on the 5GSM level that can be caused by 5GSM signalling generated
by Disaster Inbound Roamers;_
As such, Solution #54 is not sufficient to fully address Key Issue #7 and must
be supplemented by other solutions addressing the remaining questions; and
b) enables a PLMN offering disaster roaming to indicate to a Disaster Inbound
Roamer, during the registration procedure, a maximum number of PDU sessions
which the UE is allowed to request to establish, and to optionally provide a
timer during which this maximum number is applicable. The PLMN can also either
modify this number or remove any limitation.
**[Solution #55:]{.underline}**
a) only addresses the following question of Key Issue #7:
_How to enable a PLMN without Disaster Condition to efficiently prevent
congestion on the 5GSM level that can be caused by 5GSM signalling generated
by Disaster Inbound Roamers;_
As such, Solution #55 is not sufficient to fully address Key Issue #7 and must
be supplemented by other solutions addressing the remaining questions; and
b) does not specify any new mechanism and instead proposes that existing
mechanisms (DNN based congestion control triggered by the AMF or by the SMF,
and S-NSSAI only or S-NSSAI and DNN based congestion control triggered by the
AMF or by the SMF) are sufficient. The network triggers those mechanisms
towards a particular UE so if required by operator policy, the network can
trigger one or more of them towards a Disaster Inbound Roamer.
**[Summary:]{.underline}**
The following key points can be observed from the evaluation above:
**Observation 1:** None of the solutions address all questions of Key Issue
#7, which suggests that it will be necessary to combine components from
different solutions for normative work.
**Observation 2:** One solution (Solution #1) relies on the use of non-3GPP
access in specific conditions. It is not sufficient to address Key Issue #7 in
all cases, but it could co-exist with solutions based on the use of 3GPP
access.
**Observation 3:** Four solutions (Solutions #1, #39, #41 and #43) rely on the
use of a prioritized list of PLMNs provided to the UE to distribute the
subscribers of the PLMN with Disaster Condition between the PLMNs without
Disaster Condition. When the disaster condition happens the congestion
situation may be changing dynamically. A finer adjustment by the PLMNs
offering disaster roaming is not possible when this information is pre-
provisioned. The pre-configured distribution among various PLMNs achieves the
intended distribution only if all these are available in the disaster area. It
requires the operator to create, maintain up-to-date and provision such
information to all subscribers and roamers. The pre-configured information
cannot apply to roamers who has not registered with the PLMN with disaster
condition earlier.
**Observation 4:** Four solutions (Solutions #1, #39, #43 and #53) rely on
putting restrictions on the time when the UE can initiate registration on the
PLMN without Disaster Condition to stagger the arrival of UEs in the PLMNs
without Disaster Condition. The specific methods proposed in each of these
solutions can be compared as follows:
a) As compared to only providing a \"wait timer\" (as in Solution #1), a timer
used to compute a series of windows of time (as in Solution #53) or a
\"minimum wait time\" (as in Solution #43), providing a range and having the
UE draw a random value within that range (as in Solution #39 has the advantage
of providing an upper bound for the wait time, thereby limiting the service
interruption;
b) As compared to only providing a \"wait timer\" (as in Solution #1),
providing a timer which the UE uses to compute a randomized series of windows
(as in Solution #53) or providing a range and having the UE draw a random
value within that range (as in Solution #39) has the advantage of removing the
need for the network to allocate different \"wait timer\" values to different
UEs to achieve spreading out the registration attempts over time, since the
randomization of the registration time is done at the UE;
c) As compared to providing a \"wait timer\" (as in Solution #1) or a
\"minimum wait time\" (as in Solution #43) or providing a range and having the
UE draw a random value within that range (as in Solution #39), providing a
timer which the UE uses to compute a randomized series of windows (as in
Solution #53) has the advantage of enforcing back-off of the UE in case the UE
was unable to register during a window of time, and retry of the UE during the
next occurrence of the window of time;
d) Configuring the UE with \"wait timer\" before the Disaster Condition (as in
Solution #1) or providing a timer which the UE uses to compute a randomized
series of windows (as in Solution #53) makes it less flexible for networks to
adapt to actual congestion situation at the time of arrival of roamers. For
example, if the affected area/number of UEs is small, the PLMN without
Disaster Condition would not be able to reduce the minimum wait duration or
the time between the consecutive windows for registration; and
e) As compared to providing a \"wait timer\" (as in Solution #1), providing a
\"minimum wait time\" (as in Solution #43), providing a range and having the
UE draw a random value within that range (as in Solution #39) or providing a
timer which the UE uses to compute a randomized series of windows (as in
Solution #53), using UAC and NAS-level congestion control has the advantage
that restrictions are put on the time when the UE can initiate registration
only in case of actual congestion, which avoids delay in registration when
there is no congestion.
**Observation 5:** Two solutions (Solutions #36 and #39) rely on the use of
new 5GMM cause value indicating that the resources are not sufficient for the
Disaster Inbound Roamers and which triggers the UE to look for another PLMN.
This could result into a UE trying in sequence to register with all PLMNs
offering Disaster Roaming to the UE and getting rejected in all those PLMNs.
**Observation 6:** Three solutions (Solutions #38, #40 and #42) build on top
of Unified access control concept which was introduced in 5GS with an
intention to avoid diverse Reject with back-off timer (RRC, NAS) mechanisms
and provide a unified access control framework.
**Observation 7:** Solutions #38, #54 and #55 address the 5GSM congestion
aspect of Key issue #7. The specific methods proposed in each of these
solutions can be compared as follows:
a) Solution #38 does not introduce any new mechanism to handle 5GSM load from
Disaster Inbound Roamers, but assumes that access-stratum level and 5GMM-level
congestion control mechanisms are sufficient in addition to existing 5GSM
congestion control mechanisms;
b) Solution #54 is based on providing the AMFs with an optional maximum limit
of PDU sessions and an optional time that are provided to Inbound disaster
roamers at registration. O&M is given as an example of how the values are
determined. Once the maximum number of PDU sessions is reached, new requests
from upper layers does not lead to any sort of re-prioritization of
established PDU sessions compared to new requests. As such, upper layer
requests for new PDU sessions are not to be handled. Additionally, receiving a
limit on the number of PDU session from the network cannot be used by the UE
as a trigger to perform PLMN reselection. The PLMN can also either modify this
number or remove any limitation. Solution #54 is optional for the network to
use and implement, but needs to be mandatory for the UE to implement. Solution
#54 prevents Disaster Inbound Roamers to establish more than a certain minimum
number of PDU sessions which can reduce 5GSM signalling generated by Disaster
Inbound Roamers; and
c) Solution #55 proposes that the UE property of being a Disaster Inbound
Roamer can be taken into account at evaluation of congestion control when
using existing 5GSM congestion control mechanisms. If network knowledge of
Disaster Inbound Roamers is added as part of solutions to other Key issues,
the use of such knowledge in existing 5GSM congestion control may even be
solved by implementation. The solution states that the network can use this
method based on operator policy. If some Disaster Inbound Roamers request a
high number of PDU sessions in a short period of time, action needs to be
taken by the network to apply existing mechanisms in order to prevent a
situation where other Disaster Inbound Roamers cannot establish any PDU
session.

## 7.8 Evaluation on solutions of Key Issue #8
**[Solution #27:]{.underline}**
a) provides a solution for Key Issue#8 if all of the following conditions are
met:
1) the UE:
i) supports the non-3GPP access in addition to the 3GPP access;
ii) supports connecting to N3WIF; and
iii) is in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode over the non-3GPP access; and
2) the PLMN with Disaster Condition or a PLMN offering disaster roaming has
N3WIF;
As such, Solution #27 cannot be the only solution to progress to normative
phase and other solutions also need to be specified for fully address Key
Issue #7; and
b) enables providing a \"wait timer\" to the UE to stagger the return of UEs
to the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition, hence relies on putting
restrictions on the time when the UE can initiate registration on the PLMN
previously with Disaster Condition, which is similar to what is proposed in
Solutions #44, #45, #46, #47 and #49.
**[Solution #31:]{.underline}**
a) relies on the AMF\'s notifying only part of the Disaster Inbound Roamers at
a time that the Disaster Condition is no longer applicable, e.g. based on the
mod value of SUPI, to stagger the return of UEs to the PLMN previously with
Disaster Condition;b) requires paging the UEs that are in 5GMM-IDLE mode to
bring them to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode and notify them that the Disaster Condition
has ended over NAS signalling, which is costly in terms of dedicated
signalling;
c) for the UEs in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode, the AMF either sends a CONFIGURATION
UPDATE COMMAND message including the information that the Disaster Condition
is no longer applicable or sends a DEREGISTRATION REQUEST message with a new
5GMM cause value; and
d) requires the UE to de-register from the PLMN without Disaster Condition
before returning to the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition, which
prevents the UE from attempting to transfer ongoing PDU sessions.
**[Solution #44:]{.underline}**
a) enables configuring the UE (before the Disaster Condition occurs) with a
timer, which the UE will use, along with a unique ID (e.g. the UE\'s
SUPI/PEI), to compute a series of windows of time during which the UE is
allowed to attempt registration upon returning to the PLMN previously with
Disaster Condition, hence relies on putting restrictions on the time when the
UE can initiate registration on the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition.
This solution is similar to what is proposed in Solutions #27, #45, #46, #47
and #49, but differs from all of them in the way the \"windows of time\" are
calculated as it depends on not only a timer but also UE\'s unique ID, hence
staggering the UEs and spreading the registration attempts even more.
**[Solution #45:]{.underline}**
a) does not specify any new mechanism and instead proposes that existing
mechanism (e.g. UAC, NAS-level congestion control) are sufficient; and
b) Through the use of UAC and NAS-level congestion control, can also put
restrictions on the time when the UE can initiate registration on the PLMN
previously with Disaster Condition, which is similar to what is proposed in
Solutions #27, #44, #46, #47 and #49.
**[Solution #46:]{.underline}**
a) enables the network to optionally wait for an implementation specific
amount of time before turning off a broadcast indication that the Disaster
Condition applies. This requires RAN2 and SA3\'s feedback;
b) enables the network to randomize the times when the UEs in 5GMM-CONNECTED
are notified that the Disaster Condition no longer applies (via a generic UE
configuration update procedure with an indication that the Disaster Condition
in another PLMN no longer applies, or via a generic UE configuration update
procedure with \"re-registration requested\" followed by a reject of the UE\'s
registration request with 5GMM cause #ZZZ \"disaster condition in other PLMN
no longer applies\"); and
c) enables the network to configure the UE with a \"disaster return wait
range\" from which the UE draws a random wait time which determines how long
the UE has to wait before registering upon returning to the PLMN previously
with Disaster Condition, hence relies on putting restrictions on the time when
the UE can initiate registration on the PLMN previously with Disaster
Condition, which is similar to what is proposed in Solutions #27, #44, #45,
#47 and #49.
**[Solution #47:]{.underline}**
a) enables the AMF to stagger return of UEs by rejecting the registration
requests from Disaster Inbound Roamers when the Disaster Condition no longer
applies, while continuing to broadcast the indication that a Disaster
Condition applies for a time T after that point;
b) for the UEs in 5GMM-CONNECTED mode:
1) if the UE has ongoing PDU sessions which can be transferred to the PLMN
previously with Disaster Condition, the AMF initiates a generic UE
configuration update procedure with \"re-registration requested\" followed by
a reject of the UE\'s registration request with with 5GMM cause #13 to trigger
the UE to perform PLMN selection; and
2) if the UE does not have any ongoing PDU session or the UE has ongoing PDU
sessions which cannot be transferred to the PLMN previously with Disaster
Condition, the AMF performs a network-initiated de-registration procedure with
5GMM cause #11 or #13 to trigger the UE to de-register and then perform PLMN
selection; and
c) enables the PLMN without Disaster Condition to configure the Disaster
Inbound Roamers with a timer T1 and a factor n which the UE will use to
determine how long the UE has to wait before registering upon returning to the
PLMN previously with Disaster Condition, with the maximum wait time being 2 *
T1, hence relies on putting restrictions on the time when the UE can initiate
registration on the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition, which is similar
to what is proposed in Solutions #27, #44, #45, #46 and #49.
**[Solution #48:]{.underline}**
a) does not specify any new mechanism and instead proposes that RAN cells of
the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition can control access of returning
UEs using the existing unified access control, by setting up UAC parameters
for access category 3 (= MO_sig).
**[Solution #49:]{.underline}**
a) enables the network to provision the UE with a minimum wait time per PLMN
offering Disaster Roaming, hence relies on putting restrictions on the time
when the UE can initiate registration on the PLMN previously with Disaster
Condition, which is similar to what is proposed in Solutions #27, #44, #45,
#46 and #47. In this solution, once the minimum wait time is over, UE can use
a random timer to trigger a registration update request.
**[Summary:]{.underline}**
The following key points can be observed from the evaluation above:
**Observation 1:** One solution (Solution #27) relies on the use of non-3GPP
access in specific conditions. It is not sufficient to address Key Issue #7 in
all cases, but it could co-exist with solutions based on the use of 3GPP
access.
**Observation 2:** Six solutions (Solutions #27, #44, #45, #46, #47 and #49)
rely on putting restrictions on the time when the UE can initiate registration
on the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition to stagger the return of UEs in
the PLMNs previously with Disaster Condition. Solution #46 additionally
proposes to have a wait time that runs at the network side before the network
turns off the indication that a Disaster Condition applies, to further stagger
the return of the UEs in 5GMM-IDLE mode and Solution #44 uses, in addition to
a timer, UE\'s unique ID for the calculation of windows of time when the UE is
allowed to attempt registration. Similar to Solution #44, Solution #46 also
uses a unique ID by applying a hash function to the UE\'s IMSI number. The
specific method proposed in each of these solutions can be compared as
follows:
a) As compared to only providing a \"wait timer\" (as in Solution #27), a
timer used to compute a series of windows of time (as in Solution #44) or a
\"minimum wait time\" (as in Solution #49), providing a range and having the
UE draw a random value within that range (as in Solution #46), or providing a
timer T1 and a factor n (as in Solution #47) has the advantage of providing an
upper bound for the wait time, thereby limiting the service interruption;
b) As compared to only providing a \"wait timer\" (as in Solution #27),
providing a timer which the UE uses along with its unique ID to compute a
randomized series of windows (as in Solution #44) , providing a range and
having the UE draw a random value within that range (as in Solution #46) or
providing a timer T1 and a factor n (as in Solution #47) has the advantage of
removing the need for the network to allocate different \"wait timer\" values
to different UEs to achieve spreading out the registration attempts over time,
since the randomization of the registration time is done at the UE;
c) As compared to providing a \"wait timer\" (as in Solution #27) or a
\"minimum wait time\" (as in Solution #49), providing a range and having the
UE draw a random value within that range (as in Solution #46) or providing a
timer T1 and a factor n (as in Solution #47), providing a timer which the UE
uses, along with its unique ID, to compute a randomized series of windows (as
in Solution #44) has the advantage of enforcing back-off of the UE in case the
UE was unable to register during a window of time, and retry of the UE during
the next occurrence of the window of time;
d) Configuring the UE with \"wait timer\" before the Disaster Condition (as in
Solution #49) makes it less flexible for networks to adapt to actual
congestion situation at the time of return. For example, if the affected
area/number of UEs is small, the PLMN with Disaster Condition would not be
able to reduce the minimum wait duration or the time between the consecutive
windows for registration; and
**Observation 3:** Two solutions (Solutions #45 and #48) propose that using
existing mechanisms (UAC, NAS-level congestion control) are sufficient to to
address Key Issue #8 via the use of a specific barring factor for Access
Category 3 (MO_sig) which will be used by UEs to register on the PLMN
previously with Disaster Condition and the use of reject with back-off timer
in case of congestion.
**Observation 4:** Two solutions (Solutions #31 and #46) propose to use a new
5GMM cause value to notify the Disaster Inbound Roamers that the Disaster
Condition no longer applies.
**Observation 5:** Two solutions (Solution #46 and Solution #47) propose the
return of UEs under network control. Solution #46 achieves this by randomizing
the time at which UEs in 5GMM_CONNECTED mode are notified that Disaster
Condition no longer applies. Solution #47 staggers the return of UEs by
prioritizing returning 5GMM_CONNECTED mode UEs before returning the remaining
UEs that are in IDLE mode.
## 7.9 Evaluation on solutions of Key Issue #9
Solutions #51, #56 and #60 and part of solution #25 aim at solving the key
issue #9.
Solution #56 and #60 proposes that if during manual PLMN selection, all the
available PLMNs are forbidden PLMNs and there are PLMNs that supports disaster
roaming, then the UE may indicate to upper layers that the PLMN support
disaster roaming.
Solution #56 also proposes that during manual PLMN selection, once the MS has
registered on a PLMN without Disaster Condition which is selected by the user,
before the MS is notified that the Disaster Condition no longer applies, the
MS shall not automatically register on a different PLMN unless the new PLMN is
declared as an equivalent PLMN by the registered PLMN and the new PLMN can
accommodate Disaster Inbound Roamers.
Solution #25 proposes that if during manual PLMN selection, all the available
PLMNs are forbidden PLMNs and if there are PLMNs that supports disaster
roaming, then the NAS layer provides information about the PLMNs that support
disaster roaming as not in the list of forbidden PLMNs to the upper layer. In
addition to this, Solution #25 also proposes that in manual PLMN selection,
the NAS layer may also provide information that the PLMN that is in disaster
condition has a disaster condition.
However, in rel-17, the assumption is that the disaster condition is due to
the unavailability of RAN. In that case the PLMN that is in disaster condition
will not be available for PLMN selection. If that PLMN is available, it can be
safely assumed that the disaster condition is over and so no need to send any
indication.
Solution #51 proposes that no changes are needed if the RAN is shared between
the PLMN that is in disaster condition and PLMN that supports disaster
roaming.
# 8 Conclusions
## 8.1 Conclusions on Key Issue #1
**The solution #3 is not progressed in the normative phase of FS_MINT-CT.**
A solution:
\- which informs the UE about Disaster Condition over 3GPP access; and
\- with minimal information broadcast over 3GPP access of a PLMN offering
disaster roaming to UEs of a PLMN with Disaster Condition, sufficient to
enable the UEs to determine that a Disaster Condition applies to the PLMN with
Disaster Condition;
shall be progressed in normative phase.
Solutions which inform the UE about Disaster Condition over non-3GPP access
are **not progressed in the normative phase of FS_MINT-CT in Release** 17.
In the area where a PLMN can provide normal services to a UE, this PLMN is not
considered as a PLMN with Disaster Condition in that area for that UE.
If a UE can get service from the PLMN with Disaster Condition over non-3GPP
access, the UE is not eligible for disaster roaming service.
No further enhancement is needed for handling security risks resulting from
using broadcast signalling to convey information related to disaster roaming.
## 8.2 Conclusions on Key Issue #2
**The solution #9 is not progressed in the normative phase of FS_MINT-CT.**
The notification between the PLMN with Disaster Condition and PLMN without
Disaster Condition is out of 3GPP scope.
NOTE: The information that has been listed in SA1 requirements will need to be
exchanged for the feature to work.
Roaming agreements for the disaster roaming between PLMN with Disaster
Condition and PLMN providing disaster roaming is out of scope of 3GPP**.**
## 8.3 Conclusions on Key Issue #3
For Key Issue#3, the following aspects are concluded.
\- The solution #10 is not progressed in the normative phase of FS_MINT-CT.
\- The UE shall perform disaster roaming only if HPLMN has configured the UE
with a \'list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\' with at least one
entry in it. The list is either pre-configured in the USIM or provided by the
HPLMN following a successful registration procedure.
\- The UE shall not perform disaster roaming if HPLMN has not configured the
UE with a \'list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\' or the number
of elements in the list is zero.
\- While roaming, the Registered PLMN may provide the \'list of PLMN(s) to be
used in disaster condition\' after a successful registration procedure. The UE
shall ignore this information if \'list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster
condition\' is empty .
\- Registered PLMN(s) may provision \'list of PLMN(s) to be used in disaster
condition\' over non-3GPP access before a disaster condition.
\- PLMN offering disaster roaming shall indicate accessibility for disaster
roamers through SIB messages. The indication may contain the list of PLMN(s)
with Disaster condition for which disaster roaming is offered.
\- The solution #14 is not progressed in the normative phase of FS_MINT-CT.
\- UE of PLMN D with Disaster Condition shall determine that PLMN A offers
disaster roaming when PLMN A\'s NG-RAN cell broadcasts PLMN ID of PLMN D in
the list of PLMN(s) with Disaster Condition for which disaster roaming is
offered by PLMN A. For PLMN selection, the UE shall prioritize the determined
PLMNs offering the disaster roaming which are also included in UE\'s \'list of
PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\', above the determined PLMNs
offering the disaster roaming which are not included in UE\'s \'list of
PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\'. If the \'list of PLMN(s) to be
used in disaster condition\' is non-empty and there are no determined PLMNs
offering the disaster roaming which are also included in UE\'s \'list of
PLMN(s) to be used in disaster condition\', the UE shall perform disaster
roaming in a PLMN determined as per the conclusion of KI#5 offering the
disaster roaming which is not included in UE\'s \'list of PLMN(s) to be used
in disaster condition\'.
NOTE: the design of the SIB messages is defined by RAN WG2.
If a UE can get service from the PLMN with Disaster Condition over non-3GPP
access, the UE is not eligible for disaster roaming service.
No further enhancement is needed for handling security risks resulting from
using broadcast signalling to convey information related to disaster roaming.
## 8.4 Conclusions on Key Issue #4
**The solution #18 is not progressed in the normative phase of FS_MINT-CT.**
The higher priority PLMN search can be modified under the Disaster Condition.
The AMF of PLMN providing disaster roaming should be able to distinguish the
registration request from the normal UEs and the registration request for the
disaster roaming.
With regards to the following aspect from KI#4:
_\- How a Disaster Roaming PLMN can limit the area of service to Inbound
Disaster Roamers to the region where Disaster Condition applies_ ;
the following interim conclusions are made for the normative phase:
\- The AMF in the PLMN offering disaster roaming service determines a
registration area for the UE such that the 5GS tracking area list contains
only those tracking area identities (TAIs) that overlap with the area of the
disaster condition.
\- The AMF in the PLMN offering disaster roaming service provides the mobility
restriction list to the RAN with the service area information set to the area
that corresponds with the area of the disaster condition, and also indicating
that EPC is not an allowed core network.
The following conclusions are reached for other aspects:
\- When the UE performs a registration procedure due to disaster roaming in a
PLMN which supports disaster roaming, UE will indicate a new registration type
in the REGISTRATION REQUEST message to differentiate between normal
registration and registration due to disaster roaming.
\- If the UE does not have a valid 5G-GUTI assigned by the PLMN with disaster
condition and:
\- the PLMN with Disaster Condition is not HPLMN of the UE; or
\- the PLMN with Disaster Condition is HPLMN of the UE and the UE does not
provide SUCI;
in addition to the new registration type, the UE also indicates the PLMN with
Disaster Condition in the registration request.
\- Upon receiving REGISTRATION REQUEST message with a new registration type
for disaster roaming, AMF of PLMN providing disaster roaming:
\- checks that the UE\'s PLMN with Disaster Condition which is determined from
the PLMN with Disaster Condition indicated in the registration request, SUCI
or 5G-GUTI, provided by the UE, is a PLMN with Disaster Condition for which
the PLMN of the AMF provides disaster roaming; and
\- checks that the UE is registering in a TA which is part of the disaster
area of the UE\'s PLMN with Disaster Condition.
If both the above checks are successful PLMN A handles the request further,
otherwise PLMN A rejects the request.
## 8.5 Conclusions on Key Issue #5
**The solution #51 is not progressed in the normative phase of FS_MINT-CT.**
The higher priority PLMN search can be modified under the Disaster Condition.
The following will be progressed in **the normative phase of FS_MINT-CT:**
1) concluded solution of KI#3 shall be used for discovery of PLMNs offering
disaster roaming.
2) the solution shall enable the UE in automatic selection to select available
PLMN D even if the UE is informed that Disaster Condition applies for PLMN D.
3) the UE in automatic selection shall consider PLMNs offering disaster
roaming in automatic selection in bullet vi of 3GPP TS 23.122 [7] clause
4.4.3.1.1.
4) if there are several PLMNs offering disaster roaming, they shall be ordered
according to the information configured by PLMN D, if available, or in random
order.
5) the PLMN providing disaster roaming shall not be removed from the list of
forbidden PLMNs.
6) when UE\'s RPLMN is not available, there is no available non-forbidden
PLMN, no PLMN offers disaster roaming to UEs of UE\'s RPLMN, and an available
PLMN offers disaster roaming to UEs of a non-forbidden PLMN with Disaster
Condition, the UE shall select the PLMN offering disaster roaming to UEs of
the non-forbidden PLMN with Disaster Condition. If there are several non-
forbidden PLMNs with Disaster Condition, the UE shall consider the PLMN with
Disaster Condition based on the priority of the PLMNs as described in 3GPP TS
23.122 [7] clause 4.4.3.
7) in automatic network selection mode, reselection to an EPLMN is allowed
only if the EPLMN can provide the UE with disaster roaming as determined
according to the conclusions of KI#3 as specified in clause 8.3.
NOTE: Aspects of leaving manual selection in solution #26 can be studied in
normative phase.
For automatic selection, [access to CAG cell of a PLMN for which the UE is not
configured is not allowed.]{.underline}
If a UE can get service from the PLMN with Disaster Condition over non-3GPP
access, the UE is not eligible for disaster roaming service.
No further enhancement is needed for handling security risks resulting from
using broadcast signalling to convey information related to disaster roaming.
## 8.6 Conclusions on Key Issue #6
**The solution #35 is not progressed in the normative phase of FS_MINT-CT.**
The higher priority PLMN search can be modified under the Disaster Condition.
Solution #30 and #34 will be progressed to normative work to enable the UE to
detect that Disaster Condition in PLMN D is no longer applicable without
network notification and then to perform the PLMN selection, e.g. in order to
return to PLMN D. This is treated as a pure UE based solution for Key Issue
#6.
NOTE 1: Conclusions for network based solutions will be decided during the
normative phase.
NOTE 2: Impacts due to SA1 LS response (C1-213550) will be determined during
the normative phase.
The solutions utilizing 3GPP access based approach will be the basis solutions
for the Key Issue #6 on the notification that Disaster Condition is no longer
applicable to the UEs.
No further enhancement is needed for handling security risks resulting from
using broadcast signalling to convey information related to disaster roaming.
## 8.7 Conclusions on Key Issue #7
It is proposed to adopt the following conclusion principles:
\- none of the solutions in the present specification fully address Key Issue
#7, as a result it will be necessary to combine components from different
solutions for normative work;
\- the non-3GPP access (of the PLMN with Disaster Condition, or of a PLMN
without Disaster Condition), if available, can optionally be used to provide
information on the Disaster Condition;
\- the network can optionally provision the UE with a prioritized list of
PLMNs for disaster roaming;
NOTE 1: Whether the prioritized list of PLMNs for disaster roaming is pre-
configured in the UE and/or signalled to the UE will be decided during the
normative phase.
\- the network can optionally put restrictions on the time when the UE can
initiate the registration procedure upon arriving in the PLMN without Disaster
Condition; and
NOTE 2: Whether these restrictions are signalled, pre-configured, or computed
at the UE (possibly based on signalled or pre-configured parameters) will be
decided during the normative phase.
\- for mitigating congestion on the 5GMM layer, enhancements to existing
mechanisms for congestion/overload mitigation (NAS level congestion control,
RAN overload control, UAC) can be considered in normative phase as long as
they are optional to support for the UE and the network.
\- Among Solutions #38, #40, and #42 which address UAC after selecting a PLMN
without disaster condition, Solution #42 will not not be progressed in the
normative phase.
The existing mechanisms available at the AMF and the SMF for mitigation of
overload/congestion are used for 5GSM layer congestion mitigation during the
disaster roaming service.
No further enhancement is needed for handling security risks resulting from
using broadcast signalling to convey information related to disaster roaming.
## 8.8 Conclusions on Key Issue #8
It is proposed to adopt the following conclusion principles:
\- the non-3GPP access (of the PLMN with Disaster Condition, or of a PLMN
without Disaster Condition), if available, can optionally be used to provide
information on the Disaster Condition;
\- the network can optionally put restrictions on the time when the UE can
initiate the registration procedure upon returning to the PLMN previously with
Disaster Condition;
NOTE: Whether these restrictions are signalled, pre-configured, or computed at
the UE (possibly based on signalled or pre-configured parameters) will be
decided during the normative phase.
\- a PLMN providing disaster roaming can optionally page Disaster Inbound
Roamers to trigger their return to the PLMN previously with Disaster
Condition. Whether and how long the PLMN waits before paging the Disaster
Inbound Roamers upon being notified that a Disaster Condition no longer
applies is up to operator\'s policy; and
\- A PLMN providing disaster roaming can optionally trigger Disaster Inbound
Roamers to return to the PLMN previously with Disaster Condition when the
Disaster Inbound Roamers attempt to transit to 5GMM-CONNECTED mode.
No further enhancement is needed for handling security risks resulting from
using broadcast signalling to convey information related to disaster roaming.
## 8.9 Conclusions on Key Issue #9
It is concluded that:
\- The solution #51 is not progressed in the normative phase of FS_MINT-CT.
\- The PLMN providing disaster roaming shall not be removed from the list of
forbidden PLMNs.
\- for manual network selection if only forbidden PLMNs are available and UE
detects that some of those forbidden PLMNs support disaster roaming, then the
UE may send an indication to the upper layers that those PLMNs support
disaster roaming.
\- in manual network selection mode, reselection to an EPLMN is allowed only
if the EPLMN can provide the UE with disaster roaming as determined according
to the conclusions of KI#3 as specified in clause 8.3.
For manual selection, access to CAG cell of a PLMN for which the UE is not
configured is allowed only when the CAG cell indicates that manual selection
is possible.
If a UE can get service from the PLMN with Disaster Condition over non-3GPP
access, the UE is not eligible for disaster roaming service.
