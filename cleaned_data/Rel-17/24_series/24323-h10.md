# 1 Scope
This document defines the IMS service level tracing management object. The
management object is compatible with OMA Device Management protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA DM
Device Description Framework as described in the Enabler Release Definition
OMA-ERELD _DM-V1_2 [3].
The IMS service level tracing management object consists of relevant
parameters that can be managed for IMS service level tracing capabilities
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [5].

# 4 IMS service level tracing management object
The IMS service level tracing management object is used to manage
configuration settings of the UE for IMS service level tracing. The management
object covers parameters for IMS service level trace related capabilities. The
management object enables the management of the settings on behalf of the end
user.
The management object Identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-ims_slt:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA DM 1.2.
The following nodes and leaf objects are possible under the Service Level
Tracingnode:
