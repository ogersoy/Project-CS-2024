Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.

incorporated in the document.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the unstructured supplementary service data
(USSD) using IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem (IMS) management
object (MO). The MO is compatible with OMA device management protocol
specifications, version 1.2 and upwards, and is defined using the OMA DM
device description framework as described in the enabler release definition
OMA-ERELD_DM-V1_2 [2].
The USSD using IMS (USSI) MO consists of relevant configuration parameters
that can be managed for the UE\'s USSI capabilities specified in 3GPP TS
24.390 [3].

# 4 USSI MO
The USSI MO is used to manage settings of the UE for USSI. The USSI MO covers
configuration parameters for a UE that supports the USSI capabilities
specified in 3GPP TS 24.390 [3].
The MO identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-ussi:1.0.
Protocol compatibility: This MO is compatible with OMA DM 1.2.

# 5 MO configuration parameters
## 5.1 General
This clause describes the configuration parameters for the USSI MO.
## 5.2 Node: /_\ _
This interior node acts as a placeholder for one or more accounts for a fixed
node.
\- Occurrence: OneOrMore
\- Format: node
\- Access Types: Get
\- Values: N/A
The interior node is mandatory if the UE supports USSI capabilities specified
in 3GPP TS 24.390 [3]. Support for a UE is defined by the UE role as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.390 [3].
NOTE: One node is normally used. More nodes are only used in case the terminal
supports multiple UICCs.
## 5.3 /_\ _/Name
The Name leaf is a name for the USSI settings.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: chr
\- Access Types: Get
\- Values: \
## 5.4 /_\ _/USSD_using_CS_domain_only
The USSD_using_CS_domain_only leaf indicates HPLMN operator preference for
invocation of originating USSD requests using the mechanism specified in 3GPP
TS 24.090 [5]. This equates to \"USSD requests are to be invoked via the CS
domain\" as described in 3GPP TS 23.221 [4].
NOTE: In absence of this configuration parameter, originating USSD request are
invoked in domain used for originating voice sessions as described in 3GPP TS
23.221 [4].
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: null
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: null
## 5.4A /_\ _/3GPP_PS_data_off
The interior node contains configuration parameters for 3GPP PS data off.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: node
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: N/A
## 5.4B /_\ _/3GPP_PS_data_off/USSI_exempt
The leaf indicates whether the USSI is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service.
\- Occurrence: One
\- Format: bool
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: 0, 1
0 - Indicates that the USSI is not a 3GPP PS data off exempt service.
1 - Indicates that the USSI is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service.
NOTE: This MO is used when the UE is in the HPLMN or the EHPLMN, or the UE is
in the VPLMN and the USSI_roaming_exempt node is not configured.
## 5.4C /_\ _/3GPP_PS_data_off/USSI_roaming_exempt
The leaf indicates whether the USSI is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service when
the UE is in the VPLMN.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: bool
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: 0, 1
0 - Indicates that the USSI is not a 3GPP PS data off roaming exempt service.
1 - Indicates that the USSI is a 3GPP PS data off roaming exempt service.
## 5.4D /_\ _/SNPN_Configuration
This interior node contains configuration parameters regarding a UE operating
in SNPN access operation mode.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: node
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: N/A
## 5.4E /_\ _/SNPN_Configuration/\
This interior node acts as a placeholder for a list of:
a) SNPN identity; and
b) configuration parameters.
NOTE: For each of the elements in the list, a) must be present and at least
one parameter of b) needs to appear.
A configuration parameter in an /\/SNPN_Configuration/\ node other than
the SNPN_identifier, is applicable when the UE selects an entry of \"list of
subscriber data\":
a) with the SNPN identity of the subscribed SNPN which is the same as the SNPN
identity in the SNPN_identifier leaf.
\- Occurrence: OneOrMore
\- Format: node
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: N/A
## 5.4F /_\ _/SNPN_Configuration/\/SNPN_identifier
This leaf indicates the SNPN identity of the subscribed SNPN for which the
list of configuration parameters are applicable.
> \- Occurrence: One
>
> \- Format: chr
>
> \- Access Types: Get, Replace
>
> \- Values: \\
The PLMN and NID are in the format defined by 3GPP TS 23.003 [6], with each
digit of the MCC and MNC of the PLMN and each digit of the assignment mode and
NID value of the NID encoded as an ASCII character.
## 5.4G /_\ _/SNPN_Configuration/\/3GPP_PS_data_off
The interior node contains configuration parameters for 3GPP PS data off.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: node
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: N/A
## 5.4H /_\ _/SNPN_Configuration/\/3GPP_PS_data_off/ USSI_exempt
The leaf indicates whether the USSI is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service.
\- Occurrence: One
\- Format: bool
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: 0, 1
0 - Indicates that the USSI is not a 3GPP PS data off exempt service.
1 - Indicates that the USSI is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service.
NOTE: This MO is used when the UE is in the subscribed SNPN, or the UE is in
the non-subscribed SNPN and the USSI_non-subscribed_exempt node is not
configured.
## 5.4I /_\ _/SNPN_Configuration/\/3GPP_PS_data_off/ USSI_non-
subscribed_exempt
The leaf indicates whether the USSI is a 3GPP PS data off exempt service when
the UE is in the non-subscribed SNPN.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: bool
\- Access Types: Get, Replace
\- Values: 0, 1
0 - Indicates that the USSI is not a 3GPP PS data off non-subscribed exempt
service.
1 - Indicates that the USSI is a 3GPP PS data off non-subscribed exempt
service.
## 5.5 /_\ _/Ext
The Ext is an interior node for where the vendor specific information about
the USSI management is being placed (vendor meaning application vendor, device
vendor etc.). Usually the vendor extension is identified by vendor specific
name under the ext node. The tree structure under the vendor identified is not
defined and can therefore include one or more un-standardized sub-trees.
\- Occurrence: ZeroOrOne
\- Format: node
\- Access Types: Get
\- Values: N/A
###### ## Annex A (informative): USSI MO DDF
This DDF is the standardized minimal set. A vendor can define its own DDF for
the complete device. This DDF can include more features than this minimal
standardized version.
