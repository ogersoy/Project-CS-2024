# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the management object (MO) for Multi-Device and
Multi-Identity in IMS.
The MO for Multi-Device (MuD) and Multi-Identity (MiD) in IMS is compatible
with OMA device management protocol specifications, version 1.2 and upwards,
and is defined using the OMA DM device description framework as described in
the enabler release definition OMA-ERELD_DM-V1_2 [2].
The MO for Multi-Device and Multi-Identity in IMS consists of relevant
configuration parameters that can be managed for a UE supporting the UE role
specified in 3GPP TS 24.174 [3].
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 4 Multi-Device and Multi-Identity management object
The MO for Multi-Device and Multi-Identity in IMS is used to manage settings
of the UE for Multi-Device and Multi-Identity in IMS. Figure 4-1 gives an
overview of the configuration parameters of this MO. The conventions used in
this specification are as defined in OMA-TS-DM_TND [4] with the following
modifications:
\- interior nodes are drawn as rectangles, not rectangles with rounded
corners; and
\- leaf nodes are plain text, not rectangles.
The MO for Multi-Device and Multi-Identity in IMS covers configuration
parameters for a UE supporting Multi-Device and Multi-Identity in IMS
specified in TS 24.174 [3].
The MO identifier is: urn:oma:mo:ext-3gpp-mudmid:1.0.
