# 4 General description
The UE can contain a UAE client (UAE-C). The UAE-C and the UAE server (UAE-S)
are located in the UAE layer. The UAE layer can offer the UAE capabilities to
the UAS application specific layer. The UAE layer can utilize SEAL services
provided by SEAL, which may include location management, group management,
configuration management, identity management, key management and network
resource management (see 3GPP TS 23.434 [4]).
The UAE-C communicates with the UAE-S over the U1-AE interface (see 3GPP TS

another UE over unicast Uu interface (including LTE-Uu or NG-RAN-Uu) (see 3GPP
TS 23.255 [2]). Both the UAE-C and the UAE-S can act as an HTTP client or an
HTTP server (see IETF RFC 7231 [5]). The HTTP protocol interactions are
described in detail in clause 6.
By means of using the U1-AE interface:
a) Communications between UAVs within a geographical area using unicast Uu can
be provided as defined by clause 6.2;
b) C2 communication mode selection and switching can be provided as defined by
clause 6.3;
c) UAS UE registration can be provided as defined by clause 6.4;
d) UAS UE de-registration can be provided as defined by clause 6.5; and
e) UAS UE registration update can be provided as defined by clause 6.6.
# 5 SEAL services
The UAE layer can utilize following SEAL services to support UAS services:
a) group management as specified in 3GPP TS 24.544 [6];
b) location management as specified in 3GPP TS 24.545 [7];
c) configuration management as specified in 3GPP TS 24.546 [8];
d) identity management as specified in 3GPP TS 24.547 [9]; and
e) network resource management as specified in 3GPP TS 24.548 [10].

## 7.4 Data semantics
The \ element is the root element of the XML document. The \ element contains the \,
\, \, \, \,
\, \ and \ sub-elements.
\ element contains the following
elements:
a) \, an element contains identification of the UAS, which could be in
form of identifier for the UAS, e.g. group ID, or collection of individual
identifiers for the UAV and UAV-C, e.g. CAA ID, GPSI, IP address;
b) \, an element contains the
following elements:
1) \, an element contains the
identification of the type of the C2 mode switching to be supported by the UAE
server, which could be either from direct to network-assisted C2, or from
network-assisted to direct C2 or to UTM navigated;
2) \, an element contains a string set to
\"direct\", \"network assisted\", or \"USS/UTM navigated\";
3) \, an element contains a string set to
\"direct\", or \"network assisted\" used to indicate the primary C2
communication mode;
4) \, an element contains a string set to
\"direct\", or \"network assisted\" used to indicate the secondary C2
communication mode;
5) \, an element contains a string set to the
parameters for C2 switching, which are the QoS thresholds on active and target
link, and
c) \, an element contains a string set to either \"positive\" or
\"negative\" used to indicate the positive or negative result of the C2 mode
switching configuration response.
\ element contains the following
elements:
a) \, an element contains identification of the UAS, which could be in
form of identifier for the UAS, e.g. group ID, or individual identifiers for
the UAV and UAV-C, e.g. CAA ID, GPSI, IP address;
b) \, an element contains a string set
to \"direct\", or \"network assisted\" used to indicate the selected primary
C2 communication mode;
c) \, an element contains a string
set to \"direct\", or \"network assisted\" used to indicate the selected
secondary C2 communication mode; and
d) \, an element contains a string set to either \"yes\" or
\"not\" used to indicate the acknowledgement of selected C2 communication
mode(s).
\ element contains the following elements:
a) \, an element contains a string set to the identifier of the
UAE client which indicates the QoS downgrade; and
b) \, an element contains a string indicating
the expected or actual application QoS/QoE parameters which were changed (i.e.
latency, throughput, reliability, jitter).
\ element contains the following elements:
a) \, an element contains a string set to the identifier of the
UAE server which instructs the UAS to apply the C2 mode switching;
b) \, an element contains a string
set to either \"direct to network-assisted\" or \"network-assisted to direct\"
used to indicate the type of the C2 mode switching to be applied;
c) \, an element contains a string set to the time validity for
the C2 switching requirement; and
d) \, an element specifying a geographical area for which
the C2 switching applies and has the following sub-elements:
1) \, an optional element specifying the area as a polygon
specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS 23.032 [xx]; and
2) \, an optional element specifying the area as an
ellipsoid arc specified in clause 5.7 of 3GPP TS 23.032 [xx].
\ element contains the following elements:
a) \, an element contains the unique identifier of a UAV which
requests the sending of the UAV application message. The UAV-id is in the form
of a 3GPP UE ID (e.g. GPSI, External Identifier) or CAA level UAV ID as
assigned by civil aviation authorities (e.g. FAA) via USS/UTM;
b) \, an element contains the range
information over which the UAV application message is to be sent;
c) \, an element contains the application payload that is
to be delivered to the other UAVs; and
d) \, an element contains a string set to either \"yes\" or
\"not\" used to indicate the acknowledgement of communications between UAVs
within a geographical area.
\ element contains the following
elements:
a) \, an element contains a string set to either \"positive\" or
\"negative\" used to indicate the positive or negative result of the
reception.
\ element contains the following elements:
a) \, an element contains the unique identifier of a UAV which
initiates the UAS UE registration procedure;
b) \, an element contains the information (e.g. UAS UE IP
address) the UAS UE needs to provide to the UAE-S;
c) \, an element contains the time during
which the UAS UE wants to stay registered to the UAE-S for receiving UAV
application messages from the UAS application specific server;
d) \, an element contains the time during which the UAS
UE can stay registered to the UAE-S for receiving UAV application messages
from the UAS application specific server; and
e) \, an element contains a string set to either \"success\" or
\"failure\" indicating success or failure of the UAS UE registration.
\ element contains the following elements:
a) \, an element contains the unique identifier of a UAV which
initiates the UAS UE de-registration procedure; and
b) \, an element contains a string set to either \"success\" or
\"failure\" indicating success or failure of the UAS UE de-registration.
## 7.5 MIME types
