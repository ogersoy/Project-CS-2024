# 1 Scope
IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem centralized services (ICS)
allow for the delivery of consistent IMS services to the user regardless of
the attached access type (e.g. CS domain access or IP-CAN).
The present document provides the protocol details for the realization of ICS
based on the Session Initiation protocol (SIP), the Session Description
Protocol (SDP), the I1 protocol, and the protocols of the 3GPP Circuit-
Switched (CS) domain (e.g. CAP, MAP, ISUP, BICC and the NAS call control
protocol for the CS access).
This document makes no ICS specific enhancements to SIP or SDP beyond those
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
The present document is applicable to User Equipment (UEs), MSC Servers and
Application Servers (AS) providing ICS capabilities.

# 4 Overview of IP Multimedia (IM) Core Network (CN) subsystem centralized
services (ICS)
## 4.1 General
ICS allows for the delivery of consistent IMS services to the user regardless
of the attached access type (e.g. CS domain access or IP-CAN). ICS provides
communication services such that all services, and service control, are based
on IM CN subsystem mechanisms and enablers. This includes enabling IM CN
subsystem services when using CS access for the media bearer.
When using a CS access network only, or when using a PS access networks that
does not support the full duplex speech component of an IM CN subsystem
service in conjunction with a CS access network, the CS core network is
utilized to establish a circuit switch access according to e.g. 3GPP TS 24.008
[7] or 3GPP2 C.S0001-D [37] to provide bearers for voice, data, and fax media
of IM CN subsystem sessions.
If the PS access network does support the full duplex speech component of an
IMS service then existing IM CN subsystem session procedures are used as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
ICS provides mechanisms to support the use of CS media bearer for IM CN
subsystem sessions. With ICS, IM CN subsystem sessions using CS media are
treated as standard IM CN subsystem sessions for the purpose of service
control.
Sessions originated by ICS subscribers in both the IM CN subsystem and in the
CS domain are subject to anchoring in the IM CN subsystem. Similarly, voice
calls terminated to ICS subscribers are anchored in the IM CN subsystem. When
anchoring occurs, such sessions have a path to the SCC AS from either the CS
access domain or the IM CN subsystem so that the SCC AS can be used to provide
service centralization.
In order for the above to occur, the following procedures are supplied within
this specification:
\- procedures for call origination are specified in Clause 7;
\- procedures for call modification initiated from the ICS UE are specified in
Clause 8;
\- procedures for call modification initiated towards an ICS UE are specified
in Clause 9;
\- procedures for call termination are specified in Clause 10;
\- procedures for session release are specified in Clause 11; and
\- procedures for supplementary service invocation for ICS are specified in
Clause 12.
## 4.2 Underlying network capabilities
ICS assumes the use of a number of underlying network capabilities:
1) provision by the home network operator of an ICS specific AS on the IM CN
subsystem, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11];
2) signalling within the CS domain (both within the home network and between
the home network and any visited network) supported using either ISUP (as
defined in ITU-T Recommendations Q.761 to Q.764 [28]) or BICC (as defined in
ITU-T Recommendations Q.1902.1 to Q.1902.6 [29]);
3) provision of CAMEL Phase 2 or later (as specified in 3GPP TS 29.078 [21])
at the MSC Server;
4) if the MSC Server is not enhanced for ICS, interworking between the CS
domain and the IM CN subsystem is provided by an MGCF in accordance with 3GPP
TS 29.163 [22]. In addition, as an operator option, a support of IMS
Centralized Services (ICS) may be signalled to the MGCF in a SIP initial
request for dialog or a response associated with the SIP initial request; and
5) capability of the IP-CAN to support full duplex speech component, for
example as used in IMS multimedia telephony.
## 4.3 URI and address assignments
In order to support ICS to a subscriber the following URI and address
assignments are assumed:
a) the ICS UE will be configured to be reachable in both the IM CN subsystem
and the CS domain by one to many public telecommunication numbers which should
be correlated between the CS domain and IM CN subsystem. The subscriber\'s IM
CN subsystem profile will need to be provisioned with a tel URI, either as the
default public user identity or associated with it, equivalent to a DN (e.g.
MSISDN) in the subscriber\'s CS profile associated with speech/audio (e.g.
TS11).
b) void
c) a PSI DN is assigned that can reach an ICS application that can support the
ICS capabilities for that ICS UE. The PSI DNs can be dynamically allocated at
the time that the call is rerouted to the IM CN subsystem for ICS purposes.
The PSI DN is used specifically in the case of Gm or I1 service control for
the purpose of CS bearer setup and does not apply to other procedures. The IM
CN subsystem is configured to treat the PSI DN as a PSI;
d) a non ICS UEs which are not registered in the IM CN subsystem might still
be attached to the CS network at an MSC. In this scenario, a CSRN is assigned
for routing the call to the CS domain;
e) an MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall use a private user identity and public
user identity specifically reserved for IM CN subsystem registrations from an
MSC Server. This is to avoid conflicts in IM CN subsystem registration by a UE
and an MSC Server registering on behalf of the same subscriber. The identities
reserved for ICS identities are defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [4]; and an MSC
Server shall use only those public user identities representing E.164 numbers
from the subscriber\'s IM CN subsystem profile to originate and terminate
calls;
f) an MSC Server enhanced for ICS is provisioned with a string that identifies
the visited network at the home network. The string needs to be different than
the value provisioned to a P-CSCF, as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11], in
order to distinguish between a P-CSCF and an MSC Server enhanced for ICS; and
g) an IMRN is assigned that can reach an ICS application that can support the
ICS capabilities for that UE. IMRNs can be dynamically allocated. The IM CN
subsystem is configured to treat the IMRN as a PSI.
> h) an MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall provide a home network domain name
> from the subscriber\'s IMSI as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [4].
## 4.4 Guidelines for use of media feature tags
NOTE: When the values appropriate for use with a media feature tag are of
string type, then when included in Contact, Accept-Contact or Reject-Contact
header fields, the value of the media feature tag is preceded by \"\\" according to IETF RFC 3840 [34] and IETF RFC 3841 [35A].
## 4.5 Networks where IMSVoPS is not homogeneously supported
In order to support sessions with IMS PS voice in a network where IMSVoPS is
not homogeneously supported, it is assumed that filter criteria causes all
sessions with IMS PS voice to be anchored in an SCC AS. Configuration of QoS
assignment for IMS PS voice of the sessions need to be aligned with the
initial filter criteria and SCC AS determination that a SIP INVITE request
establishes a session with IMS PS voice.
# 5 Functional entities
## 5.1 Introduction
This clause associates the functional entities described for the IM CN
subsystem and for the CS domain, with the ICS roles described in the stage 2
architecture document (see 3GPP TS 23.292 [6]).
## 5.2 User Equipment (UE)
A UE establishing the service control signalling path over Gm, that is
compliant with this specification shall implement the role of ICS UE
capabilities defined in:
\- subclause 6.2;
\- subclause 7.2 apart from subclause 7.2.4;
\- subclause 8.2;
\- subclause 9.2;
\- subclause 10.2 apart from subclause 10.2.5; and
\- subclause 11.2 apart from subclause 11.2.4.
A UE that is compliant with this specification may support establishing the
service control signalling path over I1. A UE that supports establishing the
service control signalling path over I1 shall implement the role of ICS UE
capabilities defined in:
\- subclause 7.2.4;
\- subclause 10.2.5; and
\- subclause 11.2.4.
## 5.3 MSC Server enhanced for ICS
Where the MSC server is supporting I2, the MSC server is enhanced for ICS. The
MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall provide the UA role as defined in Annex A of
3GPP TS 24.229 [11], with the exceptions and additional capabilities as
described in subclauses 6.3, 7.3, 8.3, 9.3, 10.3 and 11.3.
## 5.4 Application Server (AS)
The SCC AS provides the following roles:
a) ICS User Agent (IUA) as defined in 3GPP TS 23.292 [6] subclause 5.3.1;
b) Terminating Access Domain Selection (T-ADS) as defined in 3GPP TS 23.292
[6] subclause 5.3.1; and
c) an AS performing 3rd party call control acting as a routeing B2BUA as
defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11] subclause 5.7.5.1.
An AS implementing the ICS application shall implement one or more of the
roles IUA or T-ADS. Both roles can be co-located.
3GPP TS 24.294 [11B] defines mechanisms for the support of establishing the
service control signalling path over I1. Support of such a mechanism is
optional for the SCC AS.
# 6 Roles for registration in the IM CN subsystem
## 6.1 Introduction
This clause specifies procedures that are related to registration in the IM CN
subsystem that are required for support of ICS. Both when the ICS UE generates
the registration and when the MSC Server enhanced for ICS generates the
registration is covered.
Subclause A.3 gives examples of signalling flows for registration.
## 6.2 ICS UE
In the present document, \"ICS is enabled for the UE\" refers to all of the
following conditions:
\- the ICS MO ICS_Capabilities_Enabled leaf node (see 3GPP TS 24.286 [43]) is
set to enabled; and
\- the ability of simultaneous use of a CS bearer and use of PS for the
service control signalling path.
Prior to performing IMS registration the ICS UE shall check that the ICS MO
ICS_Capabilities_Enabled leaf node (see 3GPP TS 24.286 [43]) is set to enabled
for this ICS UE; otherwise ICS is disabled for this ICS UE and the ICS UE
shall perform as in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11] and in 3GPP TS 24.008 [7].
If the ICS UE has an IMEI, prior to performing registration, the ICS UE shall
generate an instance id based on its IMEI as defined in 3GPP TS 23.003 [4].
If ICS is enabled for the UE then the ICS UE registers to IM CN subsystem as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11] and includes its capabilities in the Contact
header field. The ICS UE shall include in the Contact header field:
a) a g.3gpp.ics media feature tag set to \"principal\" as specified in annex
B.2;
b) a g.3gpp.accesstype media feature tag set to one of the following text
strings based on the access network technology being used by the UE to
register, as follows:
\- \"wlan\": the UE is using WLAN access technology;
\- \"cellular\": the UE is using cellular access technology;
\- \"docsis\": the UE is using DOCSIS access technology;
\- \"dsl\": the UE is using DSL access technology;
\- \"ethernet\": the UE is using Ethernet access technology;
Additionally to ensure that the text string is unique for that registration
flow the UE shall append a unique numerical single digit value for each
registration flow to the text string value above (e.g \"wlan1\"); and
c) a sip.instance media feature tag containing the instance ID;
## 6.3 MSC Server enhanced for ICS
### 6.3.1 General
Prior to performing registration on behalf of a UE, the MSC Server enhanced
for ICS shall generate
\- a private user identity;
\- an instance id;
\- a temporary public user identity; and
\- a home network domain name to address the REGISTER request to;
in accordance with the procedures as described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [4].
NOTE: The condition when the MSC Server enhanced for ICS initiates
registration on behalf of a UE is described in 3GPP TS 29.292 [24].
Prior to performing registration on behalf of a UE, the MSC Server enhanced
for ICS shall obtain the IMEI of the UE using procedures as defined in 3GPP TS
24.008 [7]. The IMEI shall be used to create the instance id as defined in
3GPP TS 23.003 [4].
### 6.3.2 Initial registration
On sending a REGISTER request, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall:
1) set the Request-URI to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home network
used to address the REGISTER request;
2) set the From header field to the SIP URI that contains the temporary public
user identity to be registered;
3) set the To header field to the SIP URI that contains the temporary public
user identity to be registered;
4) populate an Authorization header field, with:
\- the username directive, set to the value of the private user identity;
\- the realm directive, set to the domain name of the home network;
\- the integrity-protected directive, set to \"auth-done\";
\- the uri directive, set to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home
network;
\- the nonce directive, set to an empty value; and
\- the response directive, set to an empty value;
5) set the Contact header field to include the SIP URI containing the IP
address or FQDN of the MSC Server enhanced for ICS in the hostport parameter.
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall include a \"+sip.instance\" header field
parameter containing the instance ID. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall
include a
a) g.3gpp.icsi-ref media feature tag as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11] the
value for the IMS Multimedia Telephony Communication Service as specified in
3GPP TS 24.173 [9]; and
b) g.3gpp.ics media feature tag set to server as specified in subclause annex
B.
6) set the Via header field to include the IP address or FQDN of the MSC
Server enhanced for ICS in the sent-by field;
7) a registration expiration interval value of 600 000 seconds as the value
desired for the duration of the registration;
NOTE 1: The registrar (S-CSCF) might decrease the duration of the registration
in accordance with network policy. Registration attempts with a registration
period of less than a predefined minimum value defined in the registrar will
be rejected with a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response.
8) populate the Supported header field with the option tag \"gruu\";
9) populate the Require header field with the option tag \"path\";
10) populate the Path header field with:
\- a SIP URI identifying the MSC Server enhanced for ICS;
\- an indication that requests routed in this direction of the path (i.e. from
the S-CSCF towards the MSC Server enhanced for ICS) are expected to be treated
as for the terminating case;
NOTE 2: This indication can e.g. be in a parameter in the URI, a character
string in the user part of the URI or be a port number in the URI.
\- if the MSC server supports indicating the traffic leg associated with a URI
as specified in IETF RFC 7549 [50], the user is roaming and if required by
local policy, append an \"iotl\" SIP URI parameter with a value set to
\"homeB-visitedB\" to the SIP URI in the Path header field;
11) populate the P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header
field parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [18] and a type 1
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall set
the type 1 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter to a value that identifies the
sending network of the request. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall not
include the type 1 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter;
12) populate the P-Visited-Network-ID header field with the value of a pre-
provisioned string that identifies the network of the MSC server at the home
network as specified in subclause 4.3;
13) include a P-Access-Network-Info header field as specified in 3GPP TS
24.229 [11] with the latest known access-type or access-class. The P-Access-
Network-Info header field shall contain:
a) an access-type field set to \"3GPP-GERAN\", \"3GPP-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-
UTRAN-TDD\",, \"3GPP-E-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-E-UTRAN-TDD\" or an access-class
field set to\"3GPP-GERAN\", \"3GPP-UTRAN or \"3GPP-E-UTRAN\";
NOTE 2: The SC UE is registered with an E-UTRAN access-type or access-class
when performing combined attached to LTE. If CSFB occurs, the access-type or
access-class in SIP messages establishing the call will be changed to the
UTRAN or the GERAN access-type or access-class. No re-registration is required
when CSFB occurs. However, if it is time for re-registration (see subclause
6.3.5) the MSC server uses the GERAN or UTRAN access-type or access-class if
the UE has not yet returned to LTE.
b) if available, a \"cgi-3gpp\", \"utran-sai-3gpp\" or an \"utran-cell-
id-3gpp\" parameter;
> c) if available a \"local-time-zone\" parameter;
>
> d) if supported, a \"daylight-saving-time\" parameter; and
e) a \"network-provided\" parameter; and
14) forward the request as specified in subclause 6.3.3. If the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS fails to forward the REGISTER request, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS shall abort the initial IMS registration attempt.
The MSC server enhanced for ICS shall not include the \"reg-id\" header field
parameter in the Contact header field and the \"outbound\" option-tag in a
Supported header field the in REGISTER request.
On receiving a 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS shall:
1) store the expiration time of the registration for the public user
identities found in the To header field value;
2) store the list of service route values contained in the Service-Route
header fields preserving the order and bind the list to the contact address,
in order to build a proper preloaded Route header field value for new dialogs
and standalone transactions when using this contact address. The MSC Server
enhanced for ICS shall store this list during the entire registration period
of the respective public user identity;
3) void;
4) store as the default public user identity the first URI in the list of URIs
present in the P-Associated-URI header field;
5) treat the identity under registration as a barred public user identity, if
it is not included in the P-Associated-URI header field;
6) find the Contact header field within the response that matches the one
included in the REGISTER request. If this contains a \"pub-gruu\" parameter or
a \"temp-gruu\" parameter or both, then store the value of those parameters as
the GRUUs for the UE in association with the public user identity that was
registered;
7) store the values received in the P-Charging-Function-Addresses header
field;
8) if a \"term-ioi\" header field parameter is received in the P-Charging-
Vector header field, store the value of the received \"term- ioi\" header
field parameter; and
NOTE 3: Any received \"term-ioi\" header field parameter will contain a type 1
IOI. The type 1 IOI identifies the home network of the registered user.
9) if a \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter is received in the P-Charging-
Vector header field, store the value of the received \"transit-ioi\" header
field parameter.
On receiving a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response to the REGISTER request, the
MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall:
\- send another REGISTER request populating the registration expiration
interval value with an expiration timer of at least the value received in the
Min-Expires header field of the 423 (Interval Too Brief) response.
On receiving a 408 (Request Timeout) response or 500 (Server Internal Error)
response or 504 (Server Time-Out) response to a REGISTER request, the MSC
server enhanced for ICS shall perform the procedures for initial registration
as described in this subclause.
On receiving a 3xx response or a 480 (Temporarily Unavailable) response or a
503 (Service Unavailable) response response to a REGISTER request, the MSC
server enhanced for ICS shall:
1) select a different exit or entry point as described in subclause 6.3.3; and
2) perform the procedures for initial registration as described in this
subclause.
When the timer F expires at the MSC Server enhanced for ICS, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS shall:
1) select a different exit or entry point as described in subclause 6.3.3; and
2) perform the procedures for initial registration as described in this
subclause.
After an unsuccessful initial registration attempt, if the Retry-After header
field was present in the received 4xx, 5xx or 6xx response to the REGISTER
request, the MSC server enhanced for ICS shall not automatically attempt any
further initial registration for an implementation dependant time of at least
the amount of time indicated in the received Retry-After header field.
NOTE 4: In all signalling procedures, the MSC server is assuming trusted node
authentication (see 3GPP TS 24.229 [11], subclause 4.2B.1.
After a first unsuccessful initial registration attempt, if the Retry-After
header field was not present and the initial registration was not performed as
a consequence of a failed reregistration, the MSC server shall not wait more
than 5 minutes before attempting a new registration.
After a maximum of 2 consecutive unsuccessful initial registration attempts,
the MSC server enhanced for ICS shall implement the mechanism defined in
subclause 4.5 of IETF RFC 5626 [49] for new registration attempts. The MSC
server enhanced for ICS shall use the values of the parameters \"max-time\"
and \"base-time (if all failed)\", of the algorithm defined in subclause 4.5
of IETF RFC 5626 [49]. If no values of the parameters \"max-time\" and \"base-
time (if all failed)\" have been configured by operator policy, the default
values defined in in subclause 4.5 of IETF RFC 5626 [49] shall be used.
After an unsuccessful initial registration attempt, the MSC server can fall
back to the procedures for non ICS UE attached to a legacy MSC for call
establishment as described in 3GPP TS 23.292 [6], until a successful initial
registration attempt is completed.
### 6.3.3 Sending the REGISTER request
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall send the REGISTER request as follows:
1) if the MSC Server enhanced for ICS is located in the visited network, and
local policy requires the application of IBCF capabilities in the visited
network towards the home network, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall send
the REGISTER request to an IBCF in the visited network.
NOTE 1: The list of exit points can be either provisioned in the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS or obtained as specified in IETF RFC 3263 [30].
NOTE 2: If the MSC Server enhanced for ICS sends the request to an IBCF in the
visited network, the IBCF can determine the entry point of the home network,
using the same mechanisms as described in NOTE 1 above. In that case the MSC
Server enhanced for ICS does not need to determine the entry point of the home
network.
2) determine the entry point of the home network and send the request to that
entry point.
NOTE 3: The list of entry points can be either provisioned in the MSC Server
enhanced for or obtained as specified in IETF RFC 3263 [30].
If the MSC Server enhanced for ICS fails to send the REGISTER request to any
exit or entry point, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall abort the
registration attempt.
### 6.3.4 Subscription to the registration-state event package
Upon receipt of a SIP 200 (OK) response to the initial registration, the MSC
Server enhanced for ICS shall generate a SIP SUBSCRIBE request for the event
package in accordance with IETF RFC 3680 [33], using the updated procedures
for the subscribe and notify in IETF RFC 6665 [32], with the following
elements:
\- a Request-URI set to a SIP URI that contains the default public user
identity received in the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP REGISTER request;
\- a From header field set to a SIP URI that contains the default public user
identity received in the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP REGISTER request;
\- a To header field set to a SIP URI that contains the default public user
identity received in the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP REGISTER request;
\- a Route header field set to values received in the Service-Route header
field saved from the SIP 200 (OK) response to the last registration.
1) If the MSC Server enhanced for ICS is located in the visited network, and
local policy requires the application of IBCF capabilities in the visited
network towards the home network, select an IBCF in the visited network and
add the URI of the selected IBCF to the topmost Route header field;
2) If the MSC Server enhanced for ICS is located in the visited network and
the MSC server enhanced for ICS supports indicating the traffic leg as
specified in IETF RFC 7549 [50], then the MSC server enhanced for ICS if
required by local policy may:
a) if the bottommost URI does not contain the \"tokenized-by\" URI parameter,
append the \"iotl\" SIP URI parameter set to \"visitedA-homeA\" to the URI of
the bottommost Route header field; and
b) if the bottommost URI contains the \"tokenized-by\" URI parameter, append
the \"iotl\" SIP URI parameter set to \"visitedA-homeA\" to the URI of the
second Route header field from the bottom;
\- an Event header field set to the \"reg\" event package;
\- an Expires header field set to a value higher than the registration
expiration interval value indicated in the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP

ICS;
\- a P-Asserted-Identity header field set a SIP URI that contains the default
public user identity received in the SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP REGISTER
request;
\- a P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header field
parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [27] and with the type 1
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter. The MSC server enhanced for ICS shall set
the type 1 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter to a value that identifies the
network in which the MSC server enhanced for ICS resides. The MSC server
enhanced for ICS shall not include the type 1 \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter parameter; and
\- a P-Access-Network-Info header field set as specified for the access
network technology as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
Upon receipt of a dialog establishing SIP NOTIFY request, as specified in IETF
RFC 6665 [32], associated with the SIP SUBSCRIBE request, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS shall:
1) store the information for the established dialog;
2) store the expiration time as indicated in the \"expires\" header field
parameter of the Subscription-State header field, if present, of the SIP
NOTIFY request. Otherwise the expiration time is retrieved from the Expires
header field of the 2xx response to SIP SUBSCRIBE request;
3) store the value of the \"term-ioi\" header field parameter and the value of
the \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector
header field, if present; and
4) follow the procedures specified in IETF RFC 6665 [32].
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall automatically refresh the subscription
for the reg event package for a previously registered public user identity for
the period of time in which that registration remains active. The MSC Server
enhanced for ICS shall refresh the subscription either 600 seconds before the
expiration time if the initial subscription was for greater than 1200 seconds,
or when half of the time has expired if the initial subscription was for 1200
seconds or less. If a SIP SUBSCRIBE request to refresh a subscription fails
with a non-481 response, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall still consider
the original subscription valid for the duration of the most recently known
\"Expires\" value according to IETF RFC 6665 [32]. Otherwise, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS shall consider the subscription invalid and start a new
initial subscription according to IETF RFC 6665 [32].
Upon receipt of a SIP NOTIFY request for the dialog associated with the
subscription to the reg event package with a state attribute \"active\", i.e.
registered is received for one or more public user identities, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS shall:
1) store the information for the established dialog;
2) store the expiration time indicated in the \"expires\" header field
parameter of the Subscription-State header field, if present, of the SIP
NOTIFY request. Otherwise the expiration time is retrieved from the Expires
header field of the 2xx response to SIP SUBSCRIBE request;
3) store the indicated public user identities as registered;
4) for each public user identity indicated in the notification that contains a
\ element or a \ element or both (as defined in IETF RFC
5628 [35]) store the value of those elements in association with the public
user identity;
5) store the value of the \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter and the value of
\"transit-ioi\" header field parameter received in the P-Charging-Vector
header field, if present; and
6) follow the procedures specified in IETF RFC 6665 [32].
When sending a final response to the SIP NOTIFY request, the MSC server
enhanced for ICS shall insert in the P-Charging-Vector header field the
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter, if received in the request, and a type 1
\"term-ioi\" header field parameter. The MSC server enhanced for ICS shall set
the type 1 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter to a value that identifies the
network in which the MSC server enhanced for ICS resides, and the type 1
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter is set to the previously received value of
type 1 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter.
### 6.3.5 Reregistration
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS can perform the reregistration of a previously
registered public user identity with its contact address at any time after the
initial registration has been completed.
Unless the MSC Server enhanced for ICS has determined that a continued
registration is not required, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall reregister
an already registered public user identity if that subscriber is still
registered to that VLR. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall register the
already registered public user identity either 600 seconds before the
expiration time if the previous registration was for greater than 1200
seconds, or when half of the time has expired if the previous registration was
for 1200 seconds or less, or when the MSC Server enhanced for ICS intends to
update its capabilities according to IETF RFC 3840 [34].
On sending the REGISTER request for reregistration, the MSC Server enhanced
for ICS shall populate headers as described in subclause 6.3.2.
If the MSC Server enhanced for ICS fails to forward the REGISTER request, the
MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall abort the reregistration attempt.
NOTE: This will not affect the UE\'s CS domain registration status at the MSC
Server enhanced for ICS or HSS or HLR.
On receiving a 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS shall perform the actions defined for 200 (OK) response
handling in subclause 6.3.2.
On receiving a 423 (Interval Too Brief) response to the REGISTER request, the
MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall perform the actions defined for 423
(Interval Too Brief) response handling in subclause 6.3.2.
On receiving a 408 (Request Timeout) response or 500 (Server Internal Error)
response or 504 (Server Time-Out) response for a reregistration, the MSC
Server enhanced for ICS shall perform the procedures for initial registration
as described in subclause 6.3.2.
On receiving a 3xx response response or a 480 (Temporarily Unavailable)
response or a 503 (Service Unavailable) response for a reregistration, the MSC
server enhanced for ICS shall:
1) select a different exit or entry point as described in subclause 6.3.3; and
2) perform the procedures for initial registration as described in subclause
6.3.2.
When the timer F expires at the MSC Server enhanced for ICS, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS shall:
1) select a different exit or entry point as described in subclause 6.3.3; and
2) perform the procedures for initial registration as described in subclause
6.3.2.
### 6.3.6 Deregistration
#### 6.3.6.1 S-CSCF initiated deregistration
Upon receipt of a NOTIFY request on the dialog which was generated during
subscription to the reg event package on behalf of the UE, as described in
subclause 6.3.4, including a \ element which was registered by
the MSC Server enhanced for ICS with either:
\- the state attribute set to \"terminated\" and the event attribute within
the \ element belonging to this UE set to \"expired\", \"probation\",
\"unregistered\", \"rejected\" or \"deactivated\"; or
\- the state attribute set to \"active\" and the state attribute within the
\ element belonging to this UE set to \"terminated\", and the event
attribute within the \ element belonging to this UE set to
\"expired\", \"probation\", \"unregistered\", \"rejected\" or \"deactivated\";
the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall remove all stored information for these
public user identities and remove these public user identities from the list
of the public user identities that are registered for this user. In case of a
\"deactivated\" event attribute, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall start
the initial registration procedure as described in subclause 6.3.1. In case of
a \"rejected\" event attribute, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall release
all IMS dialogs related to those public user identities.
#### 6.3.6.2 MSC Server enhanced for ICS initiated deregistration
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS initiated deregistration procedure consists of
the MSC Server enhanced for ICS sending a REGISTER request on behalf of the UE
upon receipt of any indication that the subscriber is no longer active at this
MSC Server enhanced for ICS. On receiving Location Cancellation request, the
MSC Server enhanced for ICS should delay sending the REGISTER request for
deregistration for a specific time in order to ensure that the registration
request from the target MSC Server arrives at the Sâ€‘CSCF prior to the
deregistration request from the source MSC Server.
NOTE 1: Terminating calls received while the MSC server delays the sending of
the REGISTER request for deregistration are handled according to 3GPP TS
29.292 [24], subclause 5.4.2.
If the source MSC server enhanced for ICS receives a NOTIFY request
(indicating that its registration of the UE has been terminated, as described
in subclause 6.3.4) on the dialog which was generated during subscription to
the reg event package on behalf of the UE, while the timer is still running,
the source MSC server shall not initiate the deregistration procedure on
behalf of the UE.
Prior to sending a REGISTER request for deregistration, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS shall release all IMS dialogs related to the public user
identity that is going to be deregistered or to one of the implicitly
registered public user identities.
On sending a REGISTER request for deregistration, the MSC Server enhanced for
ICS shall:
1) set the Request-URI to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home network
used to address the REGISTER request;
2) set the From header field to the SIP URI that contains the temporary public
user identity to be deregistered;
3) set the To header field to the SIP URI that contains the temporary public
user identity to be deregistered;
4) set the Contact header field set to include the SIP URI containing the IP
address or FQDN of the MSC Server enhanced for ICS in the hostport parameter.
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall include a +sip.instance parameter
containing the instance ID that was used during registration;
5) set the Via header field to include the IP address or FQDN of the MSC
Server enhanced for ICS in the sent-by field;
5A) populate an Authorization header field, with:
\- the username directive, set to the value of the private user identity;
\- the realm directive, set to the domain name of the home network;
\- the integrity-protected directive, set to \"auth-done\";
\- the uri directive, set to the SIP URI of the domain name of the home
network;
\- the nonce directive, set to an empty value; and
\- the response directive, set to an empty value;
6) a registration expiration interval value set to the value of zero;
11) populate the P-Charging-Vector header field with the \"icid-value\" header
field parameter populated as specified in 3GPP TS 32.260 [18] and a type 1
\"orig-ioi\" header field parameter. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall set
the type 1 \"orig-ioi\" header field parameter to a value that identifies the
sending network of the request. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall not
include the type 1 \"term-ioi\" header field parameter; and
7) send the request as specified in subclause 6.3.3.
On receiving the 200 (OK) response to the REGISTER request, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS shall:
1) remove all registration details relating to this public user identity; and
2) if a \"term-ioi\" header field parameter is received in the P-Charging-
Vector header field, store the value of the received \"term-ioi\" header field
parameter.
3) if a \"transit-ioi\" header field parameter is received in the P-Charging-
Vector header field, store the value of the received \"transit-ioi\" header
field parameter.
On receiving a 481 (Call Leg/Transaction Does Not Exist) response to the
REGISTER request, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall remove all
registration details relating to this public user identity.
NOTE 2: Other final responses than 200 (OK) and 481 (Call Leg/Transaction Does
Not Exist) responses might require the MSC Server enhanced for ICS to perform
cleanup such as removing details related to that public user identity. The
details of such actions are not specified in this version of the
specification.
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS shall consider any existing subscription to
the reg event package cancelled (i.e. as if the MSC Server had sent a
SUBSCRIBE request with an Expires header field containing a value of zero).
## 6.4 SCC AS
The SCC AS can obtain registration state information that it needs to
implement ICS specific requirements from:
a) any received third-party REGISTER request (e.g. including information
contained in the body of the third-party REGISTER request) as specified in
3GPP TS 24.229 [11];
b) any received reg event package as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11]; or
c) the Sh interface as specified in 3GPP TS 29.328 [25] and 3GPP TS 29.329
[26].
NOTE: Obtaining registration state information from HSS using Sh interface
does not allow the SCC AS to know the capabilities supported by the user
registered UE(s), including the used IP-CAN(s).
# 7 Roles for call origination
## 7.1 Introduction
This clause specifies the procedures for call origination for when an ICS UE
originates a session, establishing the service control signalling path either
over the Gm interface or the I1 interface, and when a non-ICS UE originates a
session achieving IMS service control via an MSC server enhanced for ICS. The
associated procedures for the SCC AS and MSC server enhanced for ICS are also
specified in this clause.
Subclause A.4 provides examples of signalling flows for call origination.
## 7.2 ICS UE
### 7.2.1 General
This clause specifies the procedures for call origination by an ICS UE.
Annex A.4 gives examples of signalling flows for call origination.
### 7.2.2 ICS UE using Gm
There are no ICS specific requirements for the origination of calls that may
be subject to ICS.
If ICS is enabled for the UE then when the ICS UE originates a call using Gm
reference point, the ICS UE shall:

## 7.4 SCC AS
### 7.4.1 General
The following subclauses describe the procedures at the SCC AS for call
origination. In such scenarios, the SCC AS serves the originating ICS UE. The
SCC AS shall follow procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11] with the
additional procedures described in this specification in subclauses 7.4.2 and
7.4.3. These subclauses describe the procedures for the SCC AS when using
service control over Gm and CS, respectively.
### 7.4.2 SCC AS for service control over Gm
#### 7.4.2.1 CS bearer is requested by the ICS UE
When the SCC AS receives an initial SIP INVITE request from the ICS UE due to
initial filter criteria, the SCC AS shall:
1) store the information received in the SIP INVITE request, including the
Request-URI, P-Asserted-Identity header field, Accept header field, Call-ID
header field, To and From header fields including tags, Contact header field
including associated media feature tags, Accept-Contact header field, the
Record-Route header field(s), and the received non-audio SDP information;
1A) construct a Route header field(s) from the Record-Route header field(s)
that was received in the initial SIP INVITE request, and save the constructed
Route header field(s) for inclusion in the subsequent in dialog requests sent
towards the ICS UE;
2) if the SDP contains:
i) a \"c=\" line with nettype portion set to \"PSTN\" as described in IETF RFC
7195 [36];
ii) a CS media \"m=\" line with media portion set to audio, port portion set
to \"9\" and nettype portion set to \"PSTN\" as described in IETF RFC 7195
[36]; and
NOTE: If both i) and ii) are true, the ICS UE is requesting that the media
bearer is to be set up over the CS domain.
iii) an a=setup attribute set to \"active\" and an a=connection attribute set
to \"new\"; and
iv) an a=cs-correlation attribute set to \"callerid\" along with the MSISDN,
of the ICS UE in the CS domain, in international E.164 number format
then the SCC AS shall send a SIP 183 (Session Progress) response towards the
originating ICS UE in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [11] with the following
additions:
i) an SDP answer, in accordance with IETF RFC 7195 [36], containing a \"c=\"
line with the nettype portion set to \"PSTN\" and with the addrtype portion
set to \"E164\" and the fmt portion set to a SCC AS PSI DN, in international
E.164 number format. The SCC AS PSI DN that identifies the stored information
in step 1) and associated with the SCC AS;
ii) an a=setup attribute set to \"passive\";
iii) an a=connection attribute set to \"new\";
iv) an a=cs-correlation attribute set to \"callerid\"; and
v) indicate local preconditions not met.
3) When the SCC AS receives an initial SIP INVITE request with the Request-URI
containing a valid SCC AS PSI DN encoded as a tel URI (see IETF RFC 3966 [42])
or SIP URI with the \"user\" SIP URI parameter set to \"phone\", in accordance
with 3GPP TS 23.003 [4], subclause 13.5 as allocated in the above step 2 and
with the P-Asserted-Identity header field containing the E.164 number received
in the a=cs-correlation attribute contained in the SDP offer in the SIP INVITE
request received from the ICS UE then the SCC AS shall:
i) use the SCC AS PSI DN that was allocated in step 2 and E.164 number
received in the a=cs-correlation attribute contained in the SDP offer from the
SIP INVITE request received from the ICS UE to correlate the previously stored
information against this session with the incoming SIP INVITE request.
ii) act as a routing B2BUA, and generate an initial SIP INVITE request toward
the terminating UE and include the information received in the SIP INVITE
received in step 1 with the following exceptions:
a) if a Privacy type of \"id\" is received in the SIP INVITE request received
initial SIP INVITE request with the Request-URI containing the SCC AS PSI DN
then the Privacy type shall be set to type of \"id\";
b) an SDP offer with the media that combines the stored SDP offer from the ICS
UE received in the SIP INVITE request from the ICS UE and the SDP offer
received in SIP INVITE request with the Request-URI containing the SCC AS PSI
DN in accordance with the rules of IETF RFC 3264 [31];
c) replace the Record-Route header field(s) received in the initial SIP INVITE
request with a new **Record-Route** header field that only contains a SIP URI
pointing to the SCC AS; and
d) set the **Contact** header field to include the contents of the Contact
header received in the received initial SIP INVITE request, except the
g.3gpp.ics media feature tag.
Upon receiving a SIP 18x response from the remote UE the SCC AS shall:
1) send a SIP 18x response on the leg with the ICS UE. If the receiving
response includes an SDP answer, the SIP 18x response shall include an SDP
answer, and use a different dialog from that of the first SIP 183(Session
Progress) response sent by the SCC AS;
1A) include in the SIP 18x response on the leg withsent the ICS UE the
**Contact** header field that contains the contents of the Contact header
received in the SIP 18x response from the terminating UE;
1B) include in the SIP 18x response sent on the leg with the ICS UE the
Record-Route header field(s) that was constructed by the SCC AS adding its SIP
URI to the saved Record-Route header field(s) that was received in the initial
SIP INVITE request; and
2) send a SIP 18x response on the leg with the CS domain.
The SDP answers shall be in accordance with rules for SDP answer as specified
in IETF RFC 3264 [31].
When the SCC AS is aware of that preconditions are met on all legs the SCC AS
shall send a SIP UPDATE request towards the remote UE indicating that local
preconditions are met.
Upon receiving a SIP 200 (OK) response from the remote UE, the SCC AS shall
send a SIP 200 (OK) response on both the leg with the ICS UE and on the leg
with the CS domain. The SCC AS may, based on operator policy, include a
Feature-Caps header field defined in IETF RFC 6809 [48] with a \"+g.3gpp.ics\"
header field parameter as described in clause B.4. If the response includes an
SDP answer, the SCC AS shall send an SDP answer on the leg with the ICS UE and
on the leg with the CS domain. The SDP answers shall be in accordance with
rules for SDP answer as specified in IETF RFC 3264 [31].
When the SCC AS has received a SIP ACK request on both the leg with the CS
domain and on the leg with the ICS UE, the SCC AS shall respond to the initial
SIP INVITE request with a final 200 (OK) response on the same dialog on which
the second 18x was sent to the ICS UE.
#### 7.4.2.2 Non CS bearer is requested by the ICS UE
When the SCC AS receives an initial SIP INVITE request due to initial filter
criteria, which does not include a request for CS media, the SCC AS shall act
as a routing B2BUA as described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
### 7.4.3 SCC AS for service control over CS
When the SCC AS receives SIP INVITE request due to originating IMRN, the SCC
AS shall:
NOTE 1: Allocation of the IMRN is outside the scope of this specification.
1) operate as an application server providing 3^rd^ party call control, and
specifically as an initiating B2BUA, as specified in subclause 5.7.5 of 3GPP
TS 24.229 [11] for this request and all future requests and responses in the
same dialog;
2) set the Request-URI of the outgoing initial SIP INVITE request to a tel-URI
which represents the original called party number of the call as initiated in
the CS domain. The tel-URI may be available from information associated with
the received IMRN or from the History-Info header field;
3) set the To header field of the outgoing initial SIP INVITE request to a
tel-URI which represents the original called party number of the call as
initiated in the CS domain. The tel-URI may be available from information
associated with the received IMRN or from the History-Info header field;
4) if the SCC AS has received a History-Info header field indicating only one
diversion, not include the History-Info header field;
5) append the \"orig\" SIP URI parameter to the S-CSCF URI included in the
Route header field of the outgoing initial SIP INVITE request;
6) set the P-Asserted-Identity header field of the outgoing SIP INVITE request
and to a tel-URI which represents the calling party number of the call
initiated in the CS domain. This is either available from information
associated against the received IMRN or is the value as received in
P-Asserted-Identity header field of the incoming SIP INVITE request; and
NOTE 2: It can happen that the P-Asserted-Identity header field is not
included in the incoming SIP INVITE request.
7) if required and the SCC AS has the network provided location information
available and a P-Access-Network-Info header field is not received, insert the
P-Access-Network-Info header field as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11] in the
incoming SIP INVITE request. The P-Access-Network-Info header field shall
contain:
a) an access-type field set to \"3GPP-GERAN\", \"3GPP-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-
UTRAN-TDD\", or an access-class field set to\"3GPP-GERAN\", \"3GPP-UTRAN\";
b) a \"cgi-3gpp\" or \"utran-sai-3gpp\" parameter;
> c) if available a \"local-time-zone\" parameter;
>
> d) if available a \"daylight-saving-time\" parameter; and
e) a \"network-provided\" parameter.
NOTE 2a: The method for determining User Location Information (e.g. CGI or
SAI) and/or local Time Zone Information at the SCC AS is implementation
dependant.
The SCC AS should in the outgoing SIP requests and SIP responses include the
same values as received in the incoming SIP requests and SIP responses in all
other header fields with the exception given in this subclause and in
subclause 5.7.5 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [8].
The SCC AS will handle the Privacy header field in the outgoing SIP INVITE
request in the following way. The SCC AS shall either:
\- if a Privacy header field is received in the incoming INVITE request,
include the Privacy header field as received in the incoming INVITE request;
or
\- if a value is associated to IMRN and indicates that the presentation of the
calling party number is restricted in the CS domain, include a Privacy header
field with the value set to \"id\".
On completion of the above procedure, the call is anchored in the SCC AS.
NOTE 3: After completion of anchoring the call in SCC AS, the allocated IMRN
is available for reuse.
### 7.4.4 SCC AS for service control over I1
#### 7.4.4.1 General
When the SCC AS receives an initial I1 Invite message from the ICS UE via the
I1interface, the SCC AS shall:
1) perform the procedures in accordance with subclause 6.2.1.3.1.2 in 3GPP TS
24.294 [11B];
2) allocate the SCC AS PSI DN which is specified as an E.164 number, and shall
identify the stored information in step 1) and associate with the SCC AS PSI
DN;
3) generate and send an I1 Progress message with Reason set to 183 \"Call
Progress\", in accordance with subclause 6.2.1.3.1.3 in 3GPP TS 24.294 [11B]

I1 Invite message was received.
Subsequently, the SCC AS will wait for an initial SIP INVITE request from the
CS domain (via MGCF) with the Request-URI set to the allocated SCC AS PSI DN,
upon receiving the initial SIP INVITE request from the CS domain the SCC AS
shall:
0) check that the Request URI is
i) set to a valid SCC AS PSI DN as allocated in the above step 2, and
ii) the SCC AS PSI DN is encoded as a tel URI (see IETF RFC 3966 [42]) or SIP
URI with the \"user\" SIP URI parameter set to \"phone\", in accordance with
3GPP TS 23.003 [4], subclause 13.5;

tag with the preference \"explicit\"; and
\- if the R bit was set to \"1\" the SCC AS shall qualify the media feature
tag with the preference \"require\"; and
c) a Reject Accept information element as specified in subclause 7.3.2.11 in
3GPP TS 24.294 [11B] insert the feature tags as received into the Reject
Contact header field of the outgoing SIP INVITE request;
d) if a Privacy type of \"id\" is received in the SIP INVITE request from the
CS domain then the Privacy type shall be set to type of \"id\"; and
ii) an SDP offer with the media received in the SDP offer conveyed to the SCC
AS in the SIP INVITE request received from the CS domain; and
3) send the generated initial SIP INVITE request toward the remote UE as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
Upon receiving a SIP 18x response from the remote UE, the SCC AS shall send
the SIP 18x response toward the CS domain. The response includes an SDP answer
received from the remote UE.
If the SCC AS receives a SIP 180 (Ringing) response from the remote UE, the
SCC AS shall send the SIP 180 (Ringing) response towards the CS domain. In
addition, the SCC AS may send an I1 Progress message with Reason set to 180
\"Ringing\" toward the ICS UE over the I1 interface, in accordance with
subclause 6.2.1.3.1.4 in 3GPP TS 24.294 [11B].
Upon receiving a SIP 200 (OK) response from the remote UE, the SCC AS shall

[48] with a \"+g.3gpp.ics\" header field parameter as described in clause B.4.
If the SIP 200 (OK) response includes an SDP answer, the SCC AS shall include
the SDP answer in the SIP 200 (OK) response sent towards the CS domain.
Upon receving a SIP ACK request (indicating receipt of CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
in the CS domain) from the CS domain, the SCC AS shall send:
1) an I1 Success message in accordance with subclause 6.2.1.3.1.5 in 3GPP TS
24.294 [11B] toward the UE; and
2) a SIP ACK request towards the remote UE.
#### 7.4.4.2 Failure handling
If the SCC AS receives a status line as specified in subclause 7.2 of IETF RFC
3261[45] with status code value 3xx to 6xx as specified in subclause 21.3-21.6
of IETF RFC 3261 [45], the SCC AS shall:

c) when the CS resources are available to the UE, the ICS UE shall send an SDP
offer including an indication that the related local preconditions for QoS for
audio as met as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
When the ICS UE originates a non-CS bearer call using Gm reference point, the
ICS UE shall act in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
#### 9.2.2.3 ICS UE is offered PS media
If the ICS UE is offered media in the PS domain using Gm reference point, the
ICS UE shall act as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
#### 9.2.2.4 ICS UE is offered media both in CS and PS domain
If the ICS UE is offered media both in the PS domain using Gm reference point
and the CS domain using a service control signalling path over Gm, the ICS UE
shall act as specified in subclause 10.2.2.4.
#### 9.2.2.5 SCC AS removes a CS bearer
When the ICS UE receives a SIP INVITE request from the network containing SDP

CS bearer resources in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.008 [8].
#### 9.2.2.6 SCC AS removes PS media
If the ICS UE is instructed to remove a media stream in the PS domain using Gm
reference point, the ICS UE shall remove the media stream as specified in 3GPP
TS 24.229 [11].
## 9.3 MSC server enhanced for ICS
No special procedure is required for call modification procedure at the MSC
server enhanced for ICS.
## 9.4 SCC AS
### 9.4.1 Terminating Access domain selection
When the SCC AS receives on an existing session a SIP re-INVITE request or a
SIP UPDATE request to add media stream(s) towards the ICS UE the SCC AS shall
\- perform Terminating Access Domain Selection (T-ADS) based upon criteria
described in 3GPP TS 23.292 [6];
\- if T-ADS results in choosing to deliver all media in the PS domain, skip
the following steps and continue with call termination in the IM CN subsystem
as specified in subclause 9.4.3; and
\- if T-ADS results in choosing to deliver media in the CS domain, and using
Gm for service control, acting as a B2BUA, the SCC AS shall act in accordance
with subclause 9.4.2.
### 9.4.2 SCC AS adds a CS bearer
When the SCC AS receives on an existing session a SIP re-INVITE request to add
media stream(s) towards the ICS UE the SCC AS shall:
1) allocate an SCC AS PSI DN associated with the SCC AS and the INVITE request
from the originating UE;
2) create a SIP INVITE request based upon the request from the originating UE
and include the following:
i) the Request URI set to the earlier received contact address
ii) an SDP offer based on the received SDP offer from the originator and
including the following:
\- in the SDP offer include additional CS media \"m=\" line with media portion
set to audio, port portion set to \"9\", proto portion set to \"PSTN\" and fmt
portion set to\"-\" as described in IETF RFC 7195 [36];
\- in the SDP offer include, a \"c=\" line with the nettype portion set to
\"PSTN\" and with the addrtype portion set to \"E164\" and the connection-
address portion set to the SCC AS PSI DN allocated in step 1), in
international E.164 number format, in accordance with IETF RFC 7195 [36];
an a=setup attribute set to \"passive\";
\- an a=connection attribute set to \"new\";
an a=cs-correlation attribute set to \"callerid\";
\- an indication that preconditions are not met; and
3) route the created SIP INVITE request towards the terminating ICS UE.
When the SCC AS has received the 18x response containing the SDP answer
accepting an audio stream over a circuit-switched bearer from the ICS UE and
receives the initial SIP INVITE request with the Request-URI containing a
valid SCC AS PSI DN encoded as a tel URI (see IETF RFC 3966 [42]) or SIP URI
with the \"user\" SIP URI parameter set to \"phone\", in accordance with 3GPP
TS 23.003 [4], subclause 13.5 as allocated in the above step 1 and with the
P-Asserted-Identity header field containing the E.164 number received in the
a=cs-correlation attribute contained in the SDP answer in the response to the
SIP INVITE request received from the ICS UE then, the SCC AS shall:
NOTE: The SCC AS could receive the SIP INVITE request before the SIP 18x
response. IETF RFC 7195 [36] provides guidance on handling this situation.
1) use the SCC AS PSI DN and E.164 number received in the a=cs-correlation
attribute contained in the SDP answer from the response to the SIP INVITE
request received from the ICS UE to correlate the SCC AS PSI DN against the
incoming SIP INVITE request from the originating UE.
2) send a response to the initial SIP INVITE request with the Request-URI
containing the SCC AS PSI DNin accordance with 3GGP TS 24.229 [11], indicating
local preconditions met.
When the SCC AS has received the 18x response containing the SDP answer
accepting an audio stream over a circuit-switched bearer from the ICS UE and
the SIP INVITE request with the Request-URI containing the SCC AS PSI DN
number, the SCC AS shall prepare an SDP answer to be sent to the remote UE.
The SDP answer shall be based on the SDP answer received from the ICS UE and
the SDP offer received from the CS domain. If the \"m=\" line of the SDP offer
from the CS domain includes more than one codecs the SCC AS shall delete the
lowest priority codecs. The status line in the response sent to the remote UE
shall be the same as received in the 18x response from the ICS UE. The SDP
answer sent to the remote UE shall be in accordance with IETF RFC 3264 [31].
When the SCC AS gets aware that the remote precondition is fulfilled on the
leg towards the remote UE and on the leg with the CS domain, the SCC AS shall
send a SIP UPDATE request to the ICS UE indicating that precondition is met.
When the SCC AS receives precondition is met onthe leg with the CS domain the
SCC AS shall:
1) send a SIP 200 (OK) for the SIP UPDATE request on the leg with the CS
domain; and
2) send a SIP 200 (OK) for the SIP INVITE request on the leg with the CS
domain. The SCC AS may, based on operator policy, include a Feature-Caps
header field defined in IETF RFC 6809 [48] with a \"+g.3gpp.ics\" header field
parameter as described in clause B.4.
### 9.4.3 SCC AS adds PS media
When the SCC AS receives an SDP offer on an existing session a request to add
or modify a non-voice stream towards the ICS UE the SCC AS shall act in
routing AS in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
### 9.4.4 SCC AS removes a CS bearer
If the SCC AS receives an SDP offer from the originating UE that indicates
that all the CS media streams are removed, the SCC AS shall send a SIP INVITE
request towards the IM CN subsystems as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11]. The
SCC AS shall populate the SIP INVITE request as follows:
\- the Request URI set to the contact address of the terminating ICS UE; and
\- an indication that the CS bearer will not be used any longer by setting the
port number to zero for the CS media \"m=\" line with nettype portion set to
\"PSTN\" as described in IETF RFC 7195 [36].
### 9.4.5 SCC AS add/remove CS video media
In case of a CS bearer with video media already used for the session and the
SCC AS decides to add or remove CS video media to/from the existing CS bearer,
the SCC AS shall apply the procedure in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [11]
and the CS SDP as described in IETF RFC 7195 [36].
# 10 Roles for call termination
## 10.1 Introduction
This clause specifies the procedures for call termination to an ICS UE and a
non-ICS UE. The following procedures describe Terminating Access Domain
Selection at both the SCC AS and terminating ICS UE, to decide the service
control type for the terminating side of the session. Service control
signalling path over Gm for an ICS UE and IMS service control for a non ICS UE
via an MSC server enhanced for ICS are specified. Procedures specific to the
SCC AS and MSC server enhanced for ICS are also described.
Subclause A.5 provides examples of signalling flows for call termination.
## 10.2 ICS UE
### 10.2.1 General
This clause specifies the procedures for call termination by an ICS UE.
Subclause A.5 gives examples of signalling flows for call termination.
### 10.2.2 ICS UE using Gm
#### 10.2.2.1 General
Subclause 10.2.2 describes the behaviour of the terminating ICS UE.
#### 10.2.2.2 Call control over Gm and all media over IP bearer
When the ICS UE receives a SIP INVITE request containing SDP for establishing
a session using just an IP bearer or if the ICS UE decides to use an IP bearer
as determined by the procedures in subclause 10.2.2.4, then the ICS UE shall
establish this session in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [11] with the
following clarification:
\- if the SIP INVITE request contains a Target-Dialog header field containing
dialog parameters that correspond to an existing dialog (or a dialog in the
process of being established) between the ICS UE and SCC AS the ICS UE shall
treat the SIP INVITE request as another dialog that is part of the same
session as the dialog identified by the dialog parameters contained in the
Target-Dialog header field;
\- if the SIP INVITE request does not contain a Target-Dialog header field but
there is an existing dialog (or a dialog in the process of being established)
between the ICS UE and SCC AS the SCC AS shall check if the dialog parameters
for this request correspond to the dialog parameters received in a Target-
Dialog header field received on an existing dialog (or a dialog in the process
of being established) between the ICS UE and SCC AS and if so then the ICS UE
shall treat the SIP INVITE request as another dialog that is part of the same
session as the dialog that the Target-Dialog header field was received on.
NOTE: The second case is to cover the possibility that requests can arrive out
of the order that they were sent
#### 10.2.2.3 Call control over Gm and voice or voice and video over CS bearer
When:
1) the ICS UE receives a SIP INVITE request containing an SDP offer to
establish a CS bearer according to IETF RFC 7195 [36] and if the SIP response

b) a \"cgi-3gpp\" or \"utran-sai-3gpp\" parameter;
c) if available a \"local-time-zone\" parameter;
d) a \"network-provided\" parameter; and
e) if available a \"daylight-saving-time\" parameter.
The MSC server enhanced for ICS shall implement call termination as specified
in 3GPP TS 29.292 [24].
When initiating a SIP failure response to any received request, depending on
operator policy, the MSC server enhanced for ICS may insert a Response-Source
header field with an \"fe\" header field parameter constructed with the URN
namespace \"urn:3gpp:fe\", the fe-id part of the URN set to \"msc-server\" and
the \"role\" header field parameter set to \"msc-server-ics\" in accordance
with subclause 7.2.17 of 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
## 10.4 SCC AS
### 10.4.1 General
The following subclauses describe the procedures at the SCC AS for call
termination. In such scenarios, the SCC AS serves the terminating UE. The SCC
AS shall follow procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11] with the
additional procedures described in the subsequent subclauses. These subclauses
describe the procedures for the SCC AS when using service control over Gm, I1
and CS, respectively.
### 10.4.2 Terminating Access Domain Selection
When the SCC AS serving the terminating UE receives an initial SIP INVITE
request due to initial filter criteria and a session used for IMS PS voice
does not exist for the UE, the SCC AS may perform:
o) the procedures as described in 3GPP TS 29.328 [25] to determine if IMS
voice over PS session is supported or unknown over the Radio Access Technology
the UE is current on.
The SCC AS shall:
1) if a:
\- session used for IMS PS voice does not exist for the UE and T-ADS
functionality based upon criteria described in 3GPP TS 23.292 [6] results in
choosing to deliver all media in the PS domain and to one or more registered
contact(s) for the URI in the Request-URI of the SIP INVITE request; or
\- session used for IMS PS voice exists for the UE;
and:
a) the registered contact(s) contain(s) the g.3gpp.ics media feature tag set
to \"principal\" then:
i) insert the Accept-Contact header field containing the media feature tag
g.3gpp.ics set to the value \"principal\" along with the parameters
\"require\" and \"explicit\" into the SIP INVITE request; and
ii) follow the SCC AS procedures as in subclause 10.4.3;
b) the registered contact(s) contain(s) the g.3gpp.accesstype media feature
tag but do not contain the g.3gpp.ics media feature tag set to \"principal\",
then:
i) insert the Reject-Contact header field set to the g.3gpp.ics media feature
tag into the SIP INVITE request; and
ii) follow the SCC AS procedures as defined in subclause 10.4.3;
c) the registered contact(s) do not contain the g.3gpp.ics media feature tag
set to \"principal\"and do not contain the g.3gpp.accesstype media feature tag
then:
i) insert the Reject-Contact header field set to the g.3gpp.ics and the
g.3gpp.accesstype media feature tags into the SIP INVITE request; and
ii) forward the SIP INVITE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [2];
NOTE: Where there is a mixture of contacts with or without the g.3gpp.ics
media and g.3gpp.accesstype feature tags, the SCC AS can send more than one
SIP INVITE request.
2) if T-ADS functionality based upon criteria described in 3GPP TS 23.292 [6]
results in choosing to deliver media in the CS domain, and using CS domain
service control:
a) at least one registered contact(s) contain(s) the g.3gpp.ics media feature
tag set to \"server\", then follow the SCC AS procedures as defined in
subclause 10.4.5; and
b) no registered contact(s) contain the g.3gpp.ics media feature tag set to
\"server\", then follow the SCC AS procedures as defined in subclause 10.4.7;
3) if one or more registered contacts for the URI in the Request-URI of the
SIP INVITE request contains the g.3gpp.ics media feature tag set to
\"principal\", and if T-ADS functionality based upon criteria described in
3GPP TS 23.292 [6] results in choosing to deliver media in the CS domain, and
using Gm for service control, then follow the SCC AS procedures defined in
subclause 10.4.4;
3a) if:
i) one or more registered contacts for the URI in the Request-URI of the SIP
INVITE request contains the g.3gpp.ics media feature tag set to
\"principal\"or if local policy determines that the terminating UE is an ICS
UE; and
ii) if T-ADS functionality based upon criteria described in 3GPP TS 23.292 [6]
results in choosing to deliver media in the CS domain, and using I1 as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.294 [11b] for service control;
then follow the SCC AS procedures defined in subclause 10.4.8; and
4) if one or more registered contacts for the URI in the Request-URI of the
SIP INVITE request contains the g.3gpp.ics media feature tag set to
\"principal\", and if T-ADS functionality based upon criteria described in
3GPP TS 23.292 [6] results in preferring the ICS UE to execute T-ADS to select
an appropriate domain for the media bearer, the SCC AS shall create a SIP
INVITE request based upon the incoming request including containing within the
SDP offer with an RTP-based IP bearer and an alternative circuit-switched
bearer as described in subclause 10.4.6 for the ICS UE to execute T-ADS.
### 10.4.3 SCC AS for call termination in IM CN
When the SCC AS serving the terminating ICS UE receives an initial SIP INVITE
request due to initial filter criteria and the T-ADS results in choosing to
deliver media in the PS domain, the SCC AS shall act as a B2BUA, and
\- if multiple contacts are registered in the PS domain and the T-ADS chooses
to establish different media types using different IP-CANs, the SCC AS shall
for each selected PS domain IP-CAN create a SIP INVITE request in accordance
with 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] and shall include, in this request;
i) an Accept-Contact header field containing the g.3gpp.accesstype media
feature tag containing the value associated at registration with the selected
PS domain IP-CAN;
NOTE 1: The SCC AS can determine which g.3gpp.accesstype media feature tag
values to use by taking into account the access-type and access-class of the
P-Access-Network-Info header and the value of the g.3gpp.accesstype media
feature tag. The values in the 3gpp.accesstype media feature tag does not
necessarily always identify an IP-CAN.
NOTE 2: It is possible that a handover between different IP-CANs can take
place without a reregistration of the UE and corresponding update of access-
type and access-class (e.g. from \"3GPP-UTRAN\" to \"3GPP-E-UTRAN\"). The SCC
AS needs to take this possibility into account when determining the IP-CAN to
use.
NOTE 3: If the SCC AS wants to preclude the request to be sent to the UE by
the S-CSCF (through sequential forking) over a different IP-CAN than the one
it explicitly selected, it needs to include the parameters \"require\" and
\"explicit\" along with the g.3gpp.accesstype media feature tag. If it intends
to allow the S-CSCF to fork between different IP-CANs, it can do that by
excluding those parameters.
NOTE 4: If the SCC AS wants to preclude the SIP INVITE request to be sent to
UEs by the S-CSCF (through forking) that are registered via an IP-CAN that is
not suitable for the media described in the SDP, it can select the UE by
including an Accept-Contact header field containing a sip.instance media
feature tag of the selected UE along with the parameters \"require\" and
\"explicit\", or by using a public GRUU of the selected UE as the Request URI.
ii) if an existing leg for this session already exists or is in the process of
being established between the SCC AS and the UE using a different IP-CAN then
a Target-Dialog header field containing the dialog parameters for that
existing dialog between the SCC AS and the UE; and
NOTE 5: The SCC AS includes a Target-Dialog header field in the SIP INVITE
request so that the ICS UE can correlate different requests as part of the
same session.
iii) SDP for the media type(s) selected to be established using this IP-CAN.
\- if multiple contacts are registered in the PS domain and the T-ADS chooses
to establish all the media types over the same IP-CAN, the SCC AS shall create
a SIP INVITE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] and shall include,
in this request:
i) an Accept-Contact header field containing the g.3gpp.accesstype media
feature tag containing the value associated at registration with the selected
PS domain IP-CAN;
NOTE 6: The SCC AS can determine which g.3gpp.accesstype media feature tag
values to use by taking into account the access-type and access-class of the
P-Access-Network-Info header field and the value of the g.3gpp.accesstype
media feature tag. The values in the 3gpp.accesstype media feature tag does
not necessarily always identify an IP-CAN.
NOTE 7: It is possible that a handover between different IP-CANs can take
place without a reregistration of the UE and corresponding update of access-
type and access-class (e.g. from \"3GPP-UTRAN\" to \"3GPP-E-UTRAN\"). The SCC
AS needs to take this possibility into account when determining the IP-CAN to
use.
NOTE 8: If the SCC AS wants to preclude the request to be sent to the UE by
the S-CSCF (through sequential forking) over a different IP-CAN than the one
it explicitly selected, it needs to include the parameters \"require\" and
\"explicit\" along with the g.3gpp.accesstype media feature tag. If it intends
to allow the S-CSCF to fork between different IP-CANs, it can do that by
excluding those parameters.
NOTE 9: If the SCC AS wants to preclude the SIP INVITE request to be sent to
UEs by the S-CSCF (through forking) that are registered via an IP-CAN that is
not suitable for the media described in the SDP, it can select the UE by
including an Accept-Contact header field containing a sip.instance media
feature tag of the selected UE along with the parameters \"require\" and
\"explicit\", or by using a public GRUU of the selected UE as the Request URI.
ii) if an existing leg for this session already exists or is in the process of
being established between the SCC AS and the UE using a different IP-CAN then
a Target-Dialog header field containing the dialog parameters for that
existing dialog between the SCC AS and the UE; and
NOTE 10: The SCC AS includes a Target-Dialog header field in the SIP INVITE
request so that the UE can correlate different requests as part of the same
session.
iii) SDP for all the media types contained in the initial SIP INVITE request.
\- if only a single contact is registered in the PS domain the SCC AS shall
create a SIP INVITE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [2] and shall
include, in this request:
i) SDP for all the media types contained in the initial SIP INVITE request.
If the SCC AS receives a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response, from:
\- a UE:
i. not including any SDP body; or
ii. including an SDP body:
a) without a media description (\"m=\") indicating \"audio\";
b) with a media description (\"m=\") only indicating \"audio\" with the
\ subfield set to \"PSTN\" and with a connection data line (\"c=\")
with \ set to \"PSTN\";
then, the SCC-AS may follow the procedures in:
1) subclause 10.4.5 if one or more registered contacts for the URI in the
Request-URI of the initial SIP INVITE request contains the g.3gpp.ics media
feature tag set to \"server\"; or
2) subclause 10.4.7.
If the SCC AS receives a18x response including an SDP answer with a media
description (\"m=\") set to \"audio\" and port portion set to \"0\", the SCC
AS may follow the procedures in subclause 10.4.5 or subclause 10.4.7.
### 10.4.4 SCC AS for call control over Gm and voice or voice and video over
CS
When the SCC AS serving the ICS UE receives an initial SIP INVITE request due
to initial filter criteria and the T-ADS results in choosing to deliver media
in the CS domain, the SCC AS shall act as a B2BUA, the SCC AS shall:
0) store the information received in the initial SIP INVITE request received
from the remote UE;
1) allocate an SCC AS PSI DN which is specified as an E.164 number, and shall
identify and be associated with the stored information in step 1) and
associated with the SCC AS ;
2) create a SIP INVITE request and include:
a) a Request-URI set to the value of the Request-URI as received in the
incoming SIP INVITE request;
b) a dedicated Accept-Contact header field with a with the value of the
g.3gpp.ics media feature tag set to \"principal\", and append \"require\" and
\"explicit\";
NOTE 1: Other media feature tags can also be included in the dedicated Accept-
Contact header field if the media feature tags have the same requirements on
the \"explicit\" and \"require\" parameter.
b1) an Accept-Contact header field with the values received in the Accept-
Contact header field in the incoming SIP INVITE except for any g.3gpp.ics
media feature tags; and
NOTE 2: According to IETF RFC 3841 [35A] when the value of the \"explicit\"
and \"require\" parameters are different for media feature tag values they
will be placed in separate Accept-Contact header fields.
c) an SDP offer based on the received SDP from the originator and including
the following:
i) in the SDP offer towards the terminating ICS UE, include an additional
media line with media portion set to audio, port portion set to \"9\", proto
portion set to \"PSTN\" and fmt portion set to \"-\", as described in IETF RFC
7195 [36] and may also include a CS video media stream according to the
initial SIP INVITE received by the SCC AS;
ii) a media level \"c=\" line, , with the nettype portion set to \"PSTN\" and
with the addrtype portion set to \"E164\" and the connection-address portion
set to the SCC AS PSI DN allocated in step 1), in international E.164 number
format, in accordance with IETF RFC 7195 [36];
iii) an a=setup attribute set to \"passive\"
iv) an a=connection attribute set to \"new\";
v) an a=cs-correlation attribute set to \"callerid;
vi) codecs based on local policy and the received SDP offer from the remote
UE; and
vii) an indication that preconditions are not met;
d) a new Record-Route header field that contains only a SIP URI pointing to
the SCC AS; and
e) a **Contact** header field that includes the contents of the Contact header
field received in the incoming initial SIP INVITE request; and
3) route the created SIP INVITE request towards the ICS UE.
When the SCC AS has received the 18x response containing the SDP answer
accepting an audio stream over a circuit-switched bearer from the ICS UE and
receives a SIP INVITE request with the Request-URI a valid SCC AS PSI DN as
allocated in the above step 1and with the P-Asserted-Identity header field
containing the E.164 number received in the a=cs-correlation attribute
contained in the SDP answer from the response to the SIP INVITE request
received from the ICS UE thenthe SCC AS shall:
1) check that the SCC AS PSN DN is encoded as a tel URI (see IETF RFC 3966
[42]) or SIP URI with the \"user\" SIP URI parameter set to \"phone\", in
accordance with 3GPP TS 23.003 [4], subclause 13.5.
NOTE 3: The SCC AS could receive the SIP INVITE request before the SIP 18x
response. IETF RFC 7195 [36] provides guidance on handling this situation.
2) use the SCC AS PSI DN and E.164 number received in the a=cs-correlation
attribute contained in the SDP answer from the response to the SIP INVITE
request received from the ICS UE to correlate the SCC AS PSI DN with the SIP
INVITE request from the remote UE; and
3) send a response to the initial SIP INVITE request with the Request-URI
containing the SCC AS PSI DN in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [11],
indicating local preconditions met.
When the SCC AS receives a 18x response containing the SDP answer accepting an
audio stream over a circuit-switched bearer from the ICS UE and the SIP INVITE
request with the Request-URI containing the SCC AS PSI DN number, the SCC AS
shall generate a SIP 18x response toward the remote UE that includes the
information received in the SIP 18x response with the following exceptions:
a) prepare an SDP answer to be sent to the originating UE. The SDP answer
shall be based on the SDP answer received from the ICS UE and the SDP offer
received from the initial SIP INVITE request with the Request-URI containing
the SCC AS PSI DN. If the \"m=\" lines of the SDP offer from the CS domain
includes more than one codecs the SCC AS shall delete the lowest priority
codecs. The status line in the response sent to the originating UE shall be
the same as received in the 18x response from the ICS UE. The SDP answer sent
to the remote UE shall be in accordance with IETF RFC 3264 [31];
b) replace the Record-Route header field(s) received in the SIP 18x response
with a new **Record-Route** header field that only contains a SIP URI pointing
to the SCC AS; and
c) set the **Contact** header field to include the contents of the Contact
header received in the SIP 183 (Session Progress) response, except the
g.3gpp.ics media feature tag.
When the SCC AS gets aware that the remote precondition is fulfilled on the
leg with the remote UE and on the leg with the CS domain, the SCC AS shall
send a SIP UPDATE request to the ICS UE indicating that precondition is met.
When the SCC AS receives preconditions are met on the leg with the CS domain
the SCC AS shall:
1) send a SIP 200 (OK) for the SIP UPDATE request on the leg with the CS
domain; and
2) send a SIP 200 (OK) for the SIP INVITE request on the leg with the CS
domain.
### 10.4.5 SCC AS for call termination to CS network via MSC Server enhanced
for ICS
If the SCC AS receives:
\- an initial SIP INVITE request due to the initial filter criteria;
\- a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response from the UE:

(\"m=\") set to \"audio\" and port portion set to \"0\"; or
\- a 500 (Server Internal Error) response, which include a Reason header
field, with a protocol value set to \"FAILURE_CAUSE\" in the \"protocol\"
header field parameter and the \"cause\" header field parameter set to either
\"2\" or \"3\" in accordance with subclause 7.2A.18.12.2 of 3GPP TS 24.229
[11];
then the SCC AS may select to complete session establishment in the CS domain
via an MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
If the SCC AS selects to complete session establishment in the CS domain via
an MSC Server enhanced for ICS, the SCC AS shall act as a B2BUA, the SCC AS
shall create a SIP INVITE request in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [11] with
the following information;
1) shall set the Request-URI to the value of the Request-URI as received in
the incoming SIP INVITE request; and
2) include in Accept-Contact header fields:
\- the values received in the Accept-Contact header field(s) in the incoming
SIP INVITE request except for any g.3gpp.ics media feature tags
\- a g.3gpp.ics media feature tag with the value set to \"server\", appended
with the value \"explicit\" and \"require\".
NOTE: According to IETF RFC 3841 [35A] when the value of the \"explicit\" and
\"require\" parameters are different for media feature tag values they will be
placed in separate Accept-Contact header fields.
### 10.4.6 SCC AS allowing UE to execute T-ADS
When the SCC AS serving the terminating ICS UE receives an initial SIP INVITE
request due to initial filter criteria and the T-ADS results in allowing the
ICS UE to execute T-ADS, the SCC AS shall act as a B2BUA, the SCC AS shall:
1) allocate an SCC AS PSI DN associated with the SCC AS and the SIP INVITE
request from the originating UE;
2) create a SIP INVITE request and include the following:
a) set the Request-URI to the value as received in the Request-URI in the
incoming SIP INVITE request;
b) a dedicated Accept-Contact header field with the value of the g.3gpp.ics
media feature tag set to \"principal\", appended with the value \"explicit\"
and \"require\";
NOTE 1: Other media feature tags can also be included in the dedicated Accept-
Contact header field if the media feature tags have the same requirements on
the \"explicit\" and \"require\" parameter.
b1) an Accept-Contact header field with media feature tag values received in
the Accept-Contact header field(s) in the incoming SIP INVITE request except
for any g.3gpp.ics media feature tags; and
NOTE 2: According to IETF RFC 3841 [35A] when the value of the \"explicit\"
and \"require\" parameters are different for feature tag values they will be
placed in separate Accept-Contact header fields.
c) within the SDP offer based on the received SDP from the originator, for
every media line indicating audio set the following:
i) transport protocol within the media line to RTP-based IP bearer;
ii) related connection line to the value as received from the originator; and
iii) additional a-lines as defined in IETF RFC 5939 [40], IETF RFC 7006 [39],
IETF RFC 7195 [36] and IETF RFC 6871 [41] indicating that:

number format. The SCC AS PSI DN identifies the stored information and is
associated with the SCC AS;
\- the related preconditions of the originating side are not met as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11]; and
NOTE 3: In the case when the UE chooses to use the CS bearer, the resources
are not available in the MGCF. Therefore, regardless on the current status of
the resource reservation at the originating side, the SCC AS sets the
preconditions to not met.
3) route the created SIP INVITE request towards the ICS UE.
Upon receipt of a SIP response to this SIP INVITE request, including an SDP
answer indicating that the UE has chosen the RTP-based IP bearer, the SCC AS
shall proceed in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
When the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request with the Request-URI containinga
valid SCC AS PSI DN encoded as a tel URI (see IETF RFC 3966 [42]) or SIP URI
with the \"user\" SIP URI parameter set to \"phone\", in accordance with 3GPP
TS 23.003 [4], subclause 13.5 as allocated in the above step 1 then the SCC AS
shall proceed as defined in subclause 10.4.4.
When the SCC AS has received the SIP 18x response containing the SDP answer
accepting an audio stream over a circuit-switched bearer from the ICS UE;
a) and the UE indicates that service control will be via I1, and I1 is
supported on the SCC AS, the SCC AS shall generate an I1 Invite message to the
terminating ICS UE as specified in subclause 6.2.1.3.2.1 with the additions in
accordance to the procedures in 3GPP TS 24.294 [11]; or
b) otherwise, the SCC AS shall proceed as defined in subclause 10.4.4.
If the SCC AS receives a SIP 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response, from a UE:

b) with a media description (\"m=\") only indicating \"audio\" with the
\ subfield set to \"PSTN\" and with a connection data line (\"c=\")
with \ set to \"PSTN\";
then, the SCC-AS may follow the procedures in:
1) subclause 10.4.5 if one or more registered contacts for the URI in the
Request-URI of the initial SIP INVITE request contains the g.3gpp.ics media
feature tag set to \"server\"; or
2) subclause 10.4.7.
If the SCC AS receives a SIP 18x response including an SDP answer with a media
description (\"m=\") set to \"audio\" and port portion set to \"0\", the SCC
AS may follow the procedures in subclause 10.4.5 or subclause 10.4.7.
### 10.4.7 SCC AS for call termination over CS
If the SCC AS receives:
\- an initial SIP INVITE request due to the initial filter criteria;
\- a 488 (Not Acceptable Here) response from the UE:
i. not including any SDP body; or
ii. including an SDP body:
a) without a media description (\"m=\") indicating \"audio\"; or
b) with a media description (\"m=\") only indicating \"audio\" with the
\ subfield set to \"PSTN\" and with a connection data line (\"c=\")
with \ set to \"PSTN\";
\- a 18x response from the UE including an SDP answer with a media description
(\"m=\") set to \"audio\" and port portion set to \"0\";

header field, with a protocol value set to \"FAILURE_CAUSE\" in the
\"protocol\" header field parameter and the \"cause\" header field parameter
set to either \"2\" or \"3\" in accordance with subclause 7.2A.18.12.2 of 3GPP
TS 24.229 [11]; or
\- a 500 (Server Internal Error) response from the MSC server enhanced for
ICS, which includes a Reason header field with a \"protocol\" header field
parameter set to \"Q.850\" and a \"cause\" header field parameter set to value
\"20\";
then the SCC AS may select to breakout to the CS domain.
If the SCC AS selects to breakout to the CS domain, the SCC AS retrieves via
procedures as defined in subclause 6.4 the correlation MSISDN associated with
the private user identity associated with the public user identity which is
the served party of the session. The SCC AS shall, based on the correlation
MSISDN, fetch a CSRN for routing the call to the CS domain. To perform CS
breakout, the SCC AS shall act as B2BUA and shall create the SIP INVITE
request in accordance to the procedures in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11] with the header
fields as follows:
1) set the Request-URI of the outgoing SIP INVITE request to the CSRN;
2) set the To header field of the outgoing SIP INVITE request to the CSRN; and
NOTE 1: How the CSRN gets selected by the SCC AS is out of the scope of this
specification.
3) if according to operator policy, include a Feature-Caps header field
according to IETF RFC 6809 [48] with a \"+g.3gpp.ics\" header field parameter
as described in clause B.4.
If required and the SCC AS has the network provided location information
available, insert the P-Access-Network-Info header field in the SIP response
to the initial SIP INVITE request as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11]. The
P-Access-Network-Info header field shall contain:
a) an access-type field set to \"3GPP-GERAN\", \"3GPP-UTRAN-FDD\", \"3GPP-
UTRAN-TDD\", or an access-class field set to \"3GPP-GERAN\", \"3GPP-UTRAN\";
b) a \"cgi-3gpp\" or \"utran-sai-3gpp\" parameter;
c) if available a \"local-time-zone\" parameter;
d) if available a \"daylight-saving-time\" parameter; and
e) a \"network-provided\" parameter.
NOTE 2: The method for determining User Location Information (e.g. CGI or SAI)
and/or UE Time Zone Information at the SCC AS is implementation dependant.
### 10.4.8 SCC AS for call control over I1 and media over CS
#### 10.4.8.0 SCC AS sends I1 Invite message
When the SCC AS receives an initial SIP INVITE request from the remote UE
destined for the serving ICS UE, and if upon performing the T-ADS, the SCC AS
selects to deliver the media via the CS domain using the I1 protocol, the SCC
AS shall:
1) store the information received in the initial SIP INVITE request received
from the remote UE;
2) allocate the SCC AS PSI DN which is specified as an E.164 number, and shall
identify and be associated with the stored information in step 1); and
3) use the information received in the initial SIP INVITE request to generate,
store and forward an I1 Invite message toward the ICS UE in accordance with
subclause 6.2.1.3.2.1 in 3GPP TS 24.294 [11B].
When the SCC AS receives a SIP INVITE request from the CS domain (via MGCF)
with the Request-URI set to the allocated SCC AS PSI DN., the SCC AS shall:
0) check that the Request URI is
i) set to a valid SCC AS PSI DN as allocated in the above step 2, and
ii) the SCC AS PSI DN is encoded as a tel URI (see IETF RFC 3966 [42]) or SIP
URI with the \"user\" SIP URI parameter set to \"phone\", in accordance with
3GPP TS 23.003 [4], subclause 13.5;
If the SCC AS PSI DN is valid and if the Timer(s) as specified in subclause
7.5.3.2.2.2 in 3GPP TS 24.294 [11B] has not expired, the SCC AS shall:
1) correlate the received SCC AS PSI DN contained in the Request URI of the
SIP INVITE request received from the CS domain with the information saved in
step 2 above;
2) send an 18x message that contains the SDP answer toward the remote UE. The
SDP answer shall be based on the SDP offer received in the SIP INVITE request
from the CS domain; and
3) create a response towards the CS domain in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.229
[11]. The response towards the CS domain shall contain the SDP answer. The SDP
answer sent towards the CS domain is based on the SDP offer received in the
initial SIP INVITE request previously received from the remote the UE.
If the SCC AS receives an I1 Progress message (with Reason field set to either
180 \"Ringing\" or 183 \"Call Progress\") over the I1 interface prior to
receiving the SIP INVITE request from the CS domain, the SCC AS shall use the
I1 Progress message in accordance with subclause 6.2.1.3.2.2 in 3GPP TS 24.294
[11B] and wait until the SIP INVITE request from the CS domain is received.
When the SCC AS receives an indication from the CS domain that the media
resources are available (e.g. the SCC AS receives a SIP message from the MGCF)
and upon receiving an I1 Progress message with Reason field set to 180
\"Ringing\", the SCC AS shall forward a SIP 180 (Ringing) response to the
remote UE.
Upon receiving an I1 Success message from the ICS UE, the SCC AS shall forward
a SIP 200 (OK) response to the remote UE.
Upon receiving a SIP ACK request from the remote UE, the SCC AS shall send a
SIP ACK request towards the CS domain.
#### 10.4.8.1 SCC AS receives a I1 Bye message
When the SCC AS enhanced for I1 receives a binary I1 Bye message using the I1
session control channel:
a) if there are no more I1 service control sessions using the CS bearer, then
the SCC AS shall not transmit a I1 Success message using the I1 session
control channel back to the ICS UE. If there are other I1 service control
sessions using the CS bearer, then the SCC AS shall perform the procedures as
in accordance with subclause 6.2.3.3.3 in 3GPP TS 24.294 [11B];
b) based on the value of the Call-Id information element included in the I1
Bye message, the SCC AS shall transmit the following SIP requests:
\- if there are no more I1 service control sessions using the CS bearer
associated with the value of the Call-Id information element, if a SIP BYE
request from the CS domain has not been received, send a SIP BYE request to
the CS domain; and
\- release the SIP session by sending a SIP BYE request towards the B-party
associated with the value of the Call-ID information element.
#### 10.4.8.2 SCC AS receives a SIP Bye message from the CS domain
When the SCC AS enhanced for I1 receives a SIP BYE from the CS domain for a CS
bearer:
\- the CS bearer release timer shall be cleared, if set;
\- respond with a SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP BYE request;
#### 10.4.8.3 SCC AS receives a SIP BYE message from a remote ICS UE
When the SCC AS receives a SIP BYE request from a remote ICS UE, it shall:
\- respond with a SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP BYE request;
\- release the I1 session using an I1 Bye message according to subclause
6.2.3.3.1 in 3GPP TS 24.294 [**11B**];
\- if there are no more I1 service control sessions using the CS bearer, set a
CS bearer release timer value.
If the CS bearer release timer expires and no SIP BYE from the CS domain was
released, the SCC AS shall release the CS bearer by sending a SIP BYE request
to the CS domain. If the SCC AS receives an I1 Success act in accordance to
subclause 6.2.3.3.2 in 3GPP TS 24.294 [**11B**].
#### 10.4.8.4 SCC AS receives SIP error from remote UE
If the SCC AS receives a stastus line as specified in subclause 7.2 of IETF
RFC 3261[45] with status code value 3xx to 6xx as specified in subclause
21.3-21.6 of IEFF RFC 3261 [45], the SCC AS shall:
a) send an I1 Failure message in accordance with subclause 6.2.1.4 in 3GPP TS
24.294 [11B] toward the UE.
# 11 Roles for session release
## 11.1 Introduction
This clause specifies session release procedures for when an ICS UE releases a
session using a service control signalling path over Gm and when a non-ICS UE
has IMS service control via an MSC server enhanced for ICS. The associated
procedures for the SCC AS are also specified in this clause; specifically, the
CS bearer release procedures when using Gm are described. The clause also
specifies the SCC AS procedures when it detects the loss of service control
signalling path over Gm. The session release procedures specific to an MSC
server enhanced for ICS are also described.
## 11.2 ICS UE
### 11.2.1 General
This clause specifies the procedures for session release by an ICS UE.
### 11.2.2 ICS UE using Gm
The ICS UE shall support session release suitable for ICS via Gm reference
point as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
If the ICS UE uses a CS bearer, the UE shall release the resources in
accordance with 3GPP TS 24.008 [7] for 3GPP systems, to release the CS bearer.
NOTE: The order of releasing the CS or PS resources is an implementation
issue.
### 11.2.3 ICS UE using CS
The ICS UE shall implement the bearer release towards SCC AS suitable for ICS
via CS domain in accordance with 3GPP TS 24.008 [7] for 3GPP systems.

The following subclauses describe the procedures at the SCC AS for session
release. In such scenarios, the SCC AS serves the terminating ICS UE. The SCC
AS shall follow procedures specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11] with the
additional procedures described in this specification in subclauses 11.4.2 and
11.4.3. These subclauses describe the procedures for the SCC AS when using
service control over Gm and CS, respectively.
### 11.4.2 SCC AS for service control over Gm
When the SCC AS receives a SIP BYE request the SCC AS shall:
1) determine if the SIP BYE request was originated due to release of a service
control session or if the SIP BYE requested was originated in the CS domain as
a result of ICS UE bearer release procedures; and
2) if the SIP BYE request was received from an endpoint involved in the
session to be released, this indicates a user\'s desire to release the service
control session forward the SIP BYE request towards the other endpoint
involved in the session.
The SCC AS distinguishes the SIP BYE requests generated by the MGCF and the
SIP BYE requests from the ICS UE by the associated dialog IDs.
When the SCC AS receives a SIP BYE request from the ICS UE, the SCC AS shall:
\- forward the SIP BYE request towards the remote leg in accordance with the
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11]; and
\- if the CS bearer is not used by any other session, send a SIP BYE request
towards the MGCF, in accordance with the procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229
[11], to release the CS bearer.
When the SCC AS receives a SIP BYE request from the MGCF, the SCC AS shall do
the following for every session associated with the ICS UE which has a CS
bearer:
\- if the session includes other PS media in addition to the CS media, the SCC
AS shall send a SIP re-INVITE or a SIP UPDATE request towards
\- the access leg, removing the CS media by setting the port number to zero
for the CS media \"m=\" line set to \"PSTN\" as described in IETF RFC 7195
[36]; and
\- the remote leg, removing the corresponding audio media by setting the port
number to zero; and
\- if the session only contains CS media, the SCC AS shall send a SIP BYE
request towards both the access and remote legs in accordance to the
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
### 11.4.3 SCC AS procedure upon loss of Gm service control
If the SCC AS detects the ICS UE is not reachable over Gm service control, the
SCC AS shall for every held session associated with the ICS UE send a SIP BYE
request towards the other UE involved in the session in accordance with the
procedures defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [11].
NOTE: The exact mechanism for detecting loss of Gm by SCC AS is implementation
dependent.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Example signalling flows
# A.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex includes signalling flows for ICS which provide examples of ICS
specific behaviour. Therefore, signalling flows that would otherwise be
identical to examples of normal behaviour without ICS are not included in this
annex.
In many cases, the signalling flows in this annex expand on the overview
information flows provided in 3GPP TS 23.292 [6].
# A.2 Introduction
## A.2.1 General
The signalling flows provided in this annex follow the methodology developed
in 3GPP TS 24.228 [10]. The following additional considerations apply:
a) 3GPP TS 24.228 [10] shows separate signalling flows with no configuration
hiding between networks, and with configuration hiding between networks. There
is no ICS specific functionality associated with hiding, and therefore such
separate signalling flows are not show in the present document;
b) 3GPP TS 24.228 [10] does not show the functionality between the S-CSCF and
the AS. As ICS can depend on the functionality provided by SCC AS, the
signalling flows between S-CSCF and SCC AS are shown in the present document;
c) 3GPP TS 24.228 [10] breaks down the functionality of the various CSCFs. In
the present document this is only shown for registration. For all other flows
the CSCFs are collapsed into a single entity labelled \"Intermediate IM CN
subsystem entities\";
NOTE: 3GPP TS 24.228 [10] is an informative specification that is no longer
maintained and cannot be used for specifying ICS requirements. It is not
intended that the reader refer to 3GPP TS 24.228 [10] beyond the subclause on
methodology.
d) where entities are combined as in c) above, and the signalling flow is
directed to such a combined entity, the contents of the signalling flow
represent the contents of the sending entity;
e) where entities are combined as in c) above and the signalling flow
originates at such a combined entity, the contents of the signalling flow
represent the contents of the receiving entity; and
f) ordering of headers within a table does not follow the conventions of 3GPP
TS 24.228 [10].
## A.2.2 Key required to interpret signalling flows
The key to interpret signalling flows specified in 3GPP TS 24.228 [10]
subclauses 4.1 and 4.2 applies with the additions specified below:
\- sip:234150999999999\@ics.mnc015.mcc234.3gppnetwork.org represents the
temporary public user ID used for registration.
\- sip:sccas.home1.net represents the address of the SCC AS on the originating
side.
\- sip:sccas2.home2.net represents the address of the SCC AS on the
terminating side.
Each signalling flow table contains descriptions for headers where the content
of the header is new to that signalling flow, as is already performed in 3GPP
TS 24.228 [10].
However, 3GPP TS 24.228 [10] includes extensive descriptions for the contents
of various headers following each of the tables representing the contents of
the signalling flows. Where the operation of the header is identical to that
shown in 3GPP TS 24.228 [10], then such text is not reproduced in the present
document.
Additional text can also be found on the contents of headers within 3GPP TS
24.228 [10] in addition to the material shown in the present document.
In order to differentiate between messages for SIP and media, the notation in
figure A.2-1 is used.
Figure A.2-1: Signalling flow notation
# A.3 Signalling flows for registration
## A.3.1 Signalling flows for CS UE IMS registration when using an MSC Server
enhanced for ICS
Figure A.3.1-1 shows the registration in the IM CN subsystem performed by the
MSC Server enhanced for ICS, on behalf of a UE. The registration is triggered
upon a CS attach of the UE. In this example the MSC Server is enhanced for ICS
and is capable of translating NAS signalling received from the UE to SIP and
vice versa. In this example an IBCF is not used.
Figure A.3.1-1 MSC Server enhanced for ICS performs registraton on behalf of
the UE
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
**1\. CS attach (UE A to MSC)**
As a result of some stimulus, UE A performs CS attachment procedure as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [7].
**2\. Authentication and Update Location (MSC/VLR to HLR/HSS)**
MSC/VLR retrieves authentication vectors for the received IMSI as specified in
3GPP TS 29.002 [20] and challenges UE A as specified in 3GPP TS 24.008 [7].
After successful authentication, the MSC/VLR sends update location to the
HSS/HLR as specified in 3GPP TS 29.002 [20]. HSS/HLR returns subscriber data
for the IMSI that was sent by the MSC/VLR.
**3\. CS attach accept (MSC to UE A)**
The CS attach request is accepted by the network, an accept message is sent to
the MS.
**4\. IMS Registration evaluation**
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS evaluates whether it needs to perform
registration with the IM CN subsystem. This can be based on subscriber data
received from the HSS/HLR.
**5\. IMS address discovery**
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS derives a home network domain name as
described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [4]. The home network domain is used to perform
DNS queries to locate the I-CSCF in the home network.
**6\. REGISTER request (MSC Server enhanced for ICS to I-CSCF) -- see example
in table A.3.1-6**
The purpose of this request is to register a private user identity and a
temporary public user identity derived from the subscriber\'s IMSI on behalf
of the user with an S-CSCF in the home network. This request is routed to the
I-CSCF in the home network. In this example no IBCF is employed.

**R-URI:** Contains the home network domain name that was derived from the
subscribers IMSI as described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [4]. In the given example, the
IMSI of the subscriber is 234150999999999.
**From:** the temporary public user identity that was derived form the
subscribers IMSI as described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [4]. In the given example, the
IMSI of the subscriber is 234150999999999.
**To:** the temporary public user identity that was derived form the
subcribers IMSI as described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [4]. In the given example, the
IMSI of the subscriber is 234150999999999.
**Contact:** The point-of-presence representing UE A, i.e. an IP address at
the MSC Server enhanced for ICS allocated for UE a. The Contact header field
contains an instance ID and a feature tag indicating that the MSC Server is
acting as an MSC Server enhanced for ICS services.
NOTE: In all signalling procedures, the MSC server is assuming trusted node
authentication (see 3GPP TS 24.229 [11], subclause 4.2B.1.
**7\. Cx: User registration status query procedure**
The I-CSCF employs network domain security mechanisms to ensure that the
REGISTER request was received from a trusted node. The I-CSCF makes a request
for information related to the Subscriber registration status by sending the
private user identity, public user identity and visited domain name to the HSS
as specified in see 3GPP TS 29.228 [23]. The HSS returns the S-CSCF required
capabilities and the I-CSCF uses this information to select a suitable S-CSCF.
**8\. REGISTER request (I-CSCF to S-CSCF) -- see example in table A.3.1-8**
I-CSCF forwards the REGISTER request to the selected S-CSCF.

**9\. Cx: S-CSCF Registration Notification**
Based on configuration data, the S-CSCF knows that the subscriber has already
been authenticated by the MSC Server enhanced for ICS. The S-CSCF informs the
HSS that the user has been registered. Upon being requested by the S-CSCF, the
HSS will also include the user profile in the response sent to the S-CSCF. For
detailed message flows see 3GPP TS 29.228 [23].
**10\. 200 (OK) response (S-CSCF to I-CSCF) - see example in table A.3.1-10**
The S-CSCF sends a 200 (OK) response to the I-CSCF indicating that
Registration was successful.

**12\. iFC evaluation**
Select the filter criteria for originating session case and check the REGISTER
request for the temporary public user identity against the initial filter
criterion with the highest priority. In this example there is a match for the
SCC AS and therefore the S-CSCF will send a third party REGISTER request to
the SCC AS. In this example the filter criteria contains an Include Register
Request XML element and an Include Register Response XML element.
**13\. REGISTER request (S-CSCF to SCC AS) - see example in table A.3.1-13**
The S-CSCF sends a third party REGISTER request containing in the body the
incoming REGISTER request from the PN UE and the 200 (OK) response to the
incoming REGISTER request to the SCC AS.

# A.4 Signalling flows for call origination
## A.4.1 Signalling flows for ICS UE origination with CS media using Gm
reference point when using an MSC Server enhanced for ICS
Figure A.4.1-1 shows the origination of a call from an ICS UE using CS bearers
controlled through the IM CN subsystem. In this example the MSC Server is
enhanced for ICS and is capable of translating NAS signalling received from
the ICS UE to SIP and vice versa. If the MSC is not enhanced for ICS,
translation of NAS signalling to ISUP is required before routing towards a
MGCF for interworking with the IM CN subsystem, as shown in subclause A.4.2.
Figure A.4.1-1: ICS UE Origination with CS media using Gm reference point when
using an MSC Server enhanced for ICS
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
1\. **Determination of call establishment**
As a result of some stimulus to establish a session with voice media, the ICS
UE based on a combination of user policy, and access technology availability,
decides to establish the service control signalling using the IM CN subsystem.
The ICS UE initiates service control signalling in the IM CN subsystem towards
the SCC AS by sending a SIP INVITE request to the intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities.
2\. **SIP INVITE request (ICS UE to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) --
see example in table A.4.1-2.**

**Request-URI:** the SIP URI or tel URI of the called party. In this example
the tel URI of the called party is included in the tel URI.
The SDP included in this SIP INVITE request indicates that the session is to
be setup using CS bearers as described in IETF RFC 7195 [36].
3\. **SIP 100 (Trying) response (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to ICS
UE)**
The intermediate IM CN subsystem entities respond to the ICS UE with a SIP 100
(Trying) response
There is no ICS specific content in this response.
4\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
The S-CSCF evaluates initial filter criteria for the served ICS user and as a
result routes the SIP INVITE request towards the SCC AS.
5\. **SIP INVITE request (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to SCC AS) --
see example in table A.4.1-5.**

6\. **SIP 100 (Trying) response (SCC AS to intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities)**
The SCC AS responds to the intermediate IM CN subsystem entities with a SIP
100 (Trying) response.
There is no ICS specific content in this response.
7\. **SCC AS allocates an SCC AS PSI DN to the ICS UE**
The SCC AS stores the information received in the initial INVITE request and
associates an **SCC AS** PSI DN with this request. The **SCC AS** PSI DN is
returned in a SIP to the ICS UE together with an inidcation that CS bearer
establishment is to be initiated by the ICS UE. For this example the **SCC
AS** PSI DN is chosen as +1212556666.

The **SCC AS** PSI DN is returned in the SDP body using the mechanisms
described in IETF RFC 7195 [36].
9\. **SIP 183 (Session Progress) response (intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities to ICS UE)**
The SIP 183 (Session Progress) response is routed towards the ICS UE from the
intermediate IM CN subsystem entities.
10\. **SIP PRACK request and SIP 200 (OK) response**
The ICS UE sends a SIP PRACK request towards the SCC AS via the intermediate
IM CN subsystem entities as a result of receiving the reliably sent SIP 183
(Session Progress) response containing the SDP answer.
Upon receipt of the SIP PRACK request, the SCC AS responds with a SIP 200 (OK)
response towards the ICS UE via the intermediate IM CN subsystem entities.
The is no ICS specific content in these SIP messages.
NOTE: In the event that the SCC AS does not receive a PRACK request, the SCC
AS is capable of handling a new SIP INVITE request sent from the ICS UE as per
normal SIP procedures. In this case a new **SCC AS** PSI DN would be returned
to the ICS UE in the SIP 183 (Session Progress) response.
11\. **ICS UE proceeds to setup CS bearers**
Upon receipt of the **SCC AS** PSI DN, the ICS UE proceeds with setting up the
call using CS bearers.
12\. **SETUP message (ICS UE to MSC Server enhanced for ICS)**
The ICS UE initiates the call over CS bearers by sending a SETUP message to
the MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
Specifically for this signalling flow, the SETUP message includes:
\- Called Party Number information element = [(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number ),
(Number digits = 1212556666)] . The Called Party Number information element is
set to the **SCC AS** PSI DN.
\- Bearer Capability information element = [(information transfer capability =
speech), (speech versions = FR AMR, GSM EFR, GSM FR)]
\- Supported Codec List information element = {[(SysID 1 = UMTS), (Codec
Bitmap for SysID 1 = UMTS AMR 2)], [(SysID 2 = GSM), (Codec Bitmap for SysID 2
= FR AMR, GSM EFR, GSM FR)]}
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS knows the calling party number corresponding
to the UE.
13\. **CALL PROCEEDING** **message (MSC Server enhanced for ICS to ICS UE)**
Upon receipt of the SETUP message from the ICS UE, the MSC Server enhanced for
ICSresponds with a CALL PROCEEDING message. There is no ICS specific content
in this message.
14\. **SIP INVITE request (MSC Server enhanced for ICS to intermediate IM CN
subsystem entities) -- see example in table A.4.1-14**
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS maps the received SETUP message to a SIP
INVITE request which is addressed to the IUA PSI DN.

## A.4.2 Signalling flows for ICS UE origination with CS media using Gm
reference point when using an MSC Server not enhanced for ICS
Figure A.4.2-1 shows the origination of a call from an ICS UE using CS bearers
controlled through the IM CN subsystem. In this example the MSC Server is not
enhanced for ICS thus translation at the MGCF of ISUP message to SIP messages
is required.
Figure A.4.2-1: ICS UE Origination with CS media using Gm reference point when
using an MSC Server not enhanced for ICS
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
1-13: These steps are identical to steps 1-13 described in subclause A.4.1.
14\. **ISUP IAM (MSC Server not enhanced for ICS to MGCF)**
The MSC Server not enhanced for ICS maps the received SETUP message to an ISUP

numbering plan], (type of number = international number), (Number digits =
12125556666)]. The Called Party Number is set to the **SCC AS** PSI DN, as
received in the SETUP message.
\- Calling Party Number parameter = [(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number),
(Number digits = 12125551111)]
15\. **SIP INVITE request (MGCF to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) --

Figure A.4.3-1 shows the origination of a call from a CS UE which uses NAS
signalling towards the MSC Server enhanced for ICS. The CS UE is controlled by
an MSC Server enhanced for ICS. In this example the CS UE supports more than
one speech codec. The MSC Server enhanced for ICS is supporting codec
negotiation. The MSC Server is enhanced for ICS and is capable of translating
NAS signalling received from the CS UE to SIP and vice versa.
Figure A.4.3-1: CS UE Origination with CS media when using an MSC Server
enhanced for ICS -- multiple codecs used
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
1\. **SETUP message (CS UE to MSC Server enhanced for ICS)**
As a result of some stimulus to establish a session with voice media, the CS
UE initiates service control signalling towards the MSC Server enhanced for
ICS by sending a SETUP message.
Specifically for this signalling flow, the SETUP message includes:
\- Called Party Number information element = [(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number ),
(Number digits =12125552222)]
\- Bearer Capability information element = [(information transfer capability =
speech), (speech versions = FR AMR, GSM EFR, GSM FR)]
\- Supported Codec List information element = {[(SysID 1 = UMTS), (Codec
Bitmap for SysID 1 = UMTS AMR 2)], [(SysID 2 = GSM), (Codec Bitmap for SysID 2
= FR AMR, GSM EFR, GSM FR)]}
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS knows the calling party number corresponding
to the CS UE
2\. **Call proceeding message (MSC Server enhanced for ICS to CS UE)**
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS acknowledges the receipt of the SETUP message
by sending a call proceeding message to the CS UE.
3-4. **Provide IP addresses and RTP information**
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS provides the media gateway with the possible
codecs. The MGW provides the MSC Server enhanced for ICS with media
information eg IP information and RTP information.
5\. **SIP INVITE request (MSC Server enhanced for ICS to IM CN subsystem
entities) -- see example in table A.4.3-5.**

12\. **SIP 100 (Trying) response (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to SCC
AS)**
The SCC AS responds to the intermediate IM CN subsystem entities with a SIP
100 (Trying) response.
There is no ICS specific content in this response.
13\. **SIP INVITE request (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to IMS UE)**
The intermediate IM CN subsystem entities route the SIP INVITE request to IMS
UE.
14\. **SIP 100 (Trying) response (UE B to intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities)**
UE B responds to the intermediate IM CN subsystem entities with a SIP 100
(Trying) response.
There is no ICS specific content in this response.
15-18. **SIP 180 (Ringing) response (UE B to MSC Server enhanced for ICS via
intermediate IM CN subsystem entities)**
UE B responds to the received SIP INVITE request with a SIP 180 (Ringing)
response and alerts IMS UE. The response contains no SDP body and contains no
ICS specific content.
In this example the SCC AS includes in the Contact header field the contents
of the Contact header field received in the SIP 180 (Ringing) response from
the terminating side. The SIP 180 (Ringing) response also includes the Record-
Route header field(s) that was constructed by the SCC AS adding its SIP URI to
the saved Record-Route header field(s) that was received in the initial SIP
INVITE request in step 9.
19-20. **Send ringing tone.**
At the receipt of the SIP 180 (Ringing) response the MSC Server enhanced for
ICS orders the MGW to send a ringing tone towards CS UE.
21**. Alerting (MSC Server enhanced for ICS to CS UE)**
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS sends an alerting message to the UE.
22-25 **SIP 200 OK (INVITE) from MSC Server enhanced for ICS to IMS UE via
intermediate IM CN subsystem entities**
IMS UE sends a SIP 200 (OK) response to the received SIP INVITE request when
IMS UE answers the call. The SIP 200 (OK) also include the SDP answer.
In this example the SCC AS includes in the Contact header field the contents
of the Contact header field received in the SIP 200 (OK) response from the
terminating side.
**26-27- Through connection in both directions**
At the receipt of the SIP 200 (OK) (INVITE) the MSC Server enhanced for ICS
orders the MGW to through connects in both directions.

message.
30-33. **SIP ACK request (MSC Server enhanced for ICS to IMS UE via
intermediate IM CN subsystem entities)**
Upon receiving the CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT from the CS UE A, the MSC Server
enhanced for ICS forwards a SIP ACK request to the SCC AS via the intermediate
IM CN Subsystem entities.
There is no ICS specific content in this request.
## A.4.5 Signalling flows for CS UE origination when using an MSC Server not
enhanced for ICS
Figure A.4.5-1 shows the origination of a call in the CS domain when using an
MSC server not enhanced for ICS. The originating UE can be an ICS UE or can be
a UE without ICS capabilities.
Figure A.4.5-1: CS UE origination when using an MSC Server not enhanced for
ICS
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
1 **Determination of call establishment domain**
As a result of some stimulus to establish a full-duplex, voice-only call, the
UE based on a combination of user policy, and access technology availability,
decides to establish the call using the CS domain.
2\. **SETUP message (UE to VMSC)**
After establishment of the MM connection, the UE initiates the CS call towards
the destination UE by sending out the SETUP message.
Specifically for this signalling flow, the SETUP message includes:
\- Called Party Number information element = [(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number ),
(Number digits = 12125552222)]
\- Bearer Capability information element = [(information transfer capability =
speech), (speech versions = FR AMR, GSM EFR, GSM FR)]
\- Supported Codec List information element = {[(SysID 1 = UMTS), (Codec
Bitmap for SysID 1 = UMTS AMR 2)], [(SysID 2 = GSM), (Codec Bitmap for SysID 2
= FR AMR, GSM EFR, GSM FR)]}
The VMSC knows the calling party number corresponding to the UE.
3\. **Origination triggers**
4\. **Redirection to IM CN subsystem**
The call is redirected to the IM CN subsystem. The mechanism for redirection
is out of scope of ICS requirements and can be based upon the use of an IP
Multimedia Routing Number (IMRN) for redirecting the signalling towards the
SCC AS. How an IMRN is retrieved is outside the scope of this specification.
5\. **ISUP IAM** (**VMSC to MGCF)**
The VMSC initiates the CS call towards the MGCF by sending out the IAM
message.
Specifically for this signalling flow, the IAM includes:
\- Called Party Number parameter = [(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number ),
(Number digits = 12415553333)]
\- Calling Party Number parameter = [(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number ),
(Number digits = 12125551111)]
\- USI parameter = 3.1 kHz audio
The Called Party Number parameter represents the IMRN allocated for this call.
6\. **SIP INVITE request (MGCF to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) \--
see example in table A.4.5-6**
The MGCF initiates a SIP INVITE request, containing an initial SDP to the
intermediate IM CN subsystem entities.

7\. **SIP INVITE request (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to SCC AS) --
see example in table A.4.5-7**
The IMRN is a PSI. The intermediate IM CN subsystem entities are configured to
route this PSI to the SCC AS. In this particular case, the I-CSCF performs the
routeing over the Ma interface. For this example, there is no IBCF before the
I-CSCF and no intermediate entities Record-Route the request.

entities)**
There is no ICS specific content to this response.
The SCC AS responds to the intermediate IM CN subsystem entities with a SIP
100 (Trying) response.
9\. **Retrieve original calling and called party information**
The SCC AS acts as a routeing B2BUA. The SCC AS retrieves the original called
party number and calling party number associated with the IMRN and places the
called party number in the Request-URI and the To header field of the outgoing
request.
How to retrieve the original called party and calling party numbers associated
with the IMRN are considered to be out of scope of this specification.
10\. **SIP INVITE request (SCC AS to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) --
see example in table A.4.5-10**
The SCC AS forwards the SIP INVITE request to the S-CSCF serving the
originating user within the IM CN subsystem. In this case it is assumed that
the user is registered within the IM CN subsystem.
In this example the SCC AS includes the contents of the Contact header from
the received SIP INVITE request The SCC AS modifies the message in accordance
with routeing B2BUA functionality, e.g. mapping of From, To, Cseq and Call-ID
header fields from one side of the B2BUA to the other.

## A.4.6 Signalling flows for ICS UE origination when using I1 interface
Figure A.4.6-1 shows ICS UE origination signalling flows using I1 when the MSC
server. The MSC server can be enhanced for ICS but need not be.
Figure A.4.6-1: ICS UE origination signalling flows
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
1\. **Determination of call establishment**
As a result of some stimulus to establish a session with voice media, the ICS
UE based on a combination of user policy, and access technology availability,
decides to establish the service control signalling using the IM CN subsystem.
2\. **I1 Invite message (ICS UE to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities).**
The ICS UE initiates service control signalling in the IM CN subsystem towards
the SCC AS by sending an I1 Invite message.
Specifically for this signalling flow, the I1 Invite message includes:
\- Protocol Information = 0x11
\- Message Type = I1 Invite
\- Reason = MO (0x000)
\- Call ID = (0x100)
\- Sequence-ID = (0x1)
\- To-id = [(international number), (12125556666)]
\- From-id = [(international number), (12125551111)]
7\. **SCC AS allocates an IUA PSI DN to the ICS UE**
The SCC AS stores the information received in the initial I1 Invite message
and associates an IUA PSI DN with this request. The IUA PSI DN is returned in
a I1 Progress message to the ICS UE together with an indication that CS bearer
establishment is to be initiated by the ICS UE. For this example the IUA PSI
DN is chosen as +1212556666.
8\. **I1 Progress message (SCC AS to ICS UE via I1 protocol)**
Specifically for this signalling flow, the I1 Progress message includes:
\- Protocol Information = 0x11
\- Message Type = I1 Progress
\- Reason = 0x0 183
\- Call ID = (0x100)
\- Sequence-ID = 0x1
\- SCC-AS-id information element = [(Code specific = E.164 number), (number
digits = 1212556666)]. This is the allocated SCC AS PSI DN
\- Session-identifier information element = [(Code specific = E.164 number),
(number digits = 1212557777)]. This is the allocated SCC AS STI
11\. **ICS UE proceeds to setup CS bearers**
Upon receipt of the IUA PSI DN, the ICS UE proceeds with setting up the call
using CS bearers.
12\. **CC SETUP message (ICS UE to MSC server)**
The ICS UE initiates the call over CS bearers by sending a CC SETUP message to
the MSC server.
Specifically for this signalling flow, the CC SETUP message includes:
1) Called Party Number information element = [(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number ),
(Number digits = 1212556666)]. The Called Party Number information element is
set to the IUA PSI DN.
2) Bearer Capability information element = [(information transfer capability =
speech), (speech versions = FR AMR, GSM EFR, GSM FR)]
3) Supported Codec List information element = {[(SysID 1 = UMTS), (Codec
Bitmap for SysID 1 = UMTS AMR 2)], [(SysID 2 = GSM), (Codec Bitmap for SysID 2
= FR AMR, GSM EFR, GSM FR)]}
The MSC server knows the calling party number corresponding to the UE.
13\. **CC CALL PROCEEDING** **message (MSC server to ICS UE)**
Upon receipt of the CC SETUP message from the ICS UE, the MSC server responds
with a CC CALL PROCEEDING message. There is no ICS specific content in this
message.
14\. **SIP INVITE request (MSC server to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities
via MGCF) -- see example in table A.4.6-14**
The MSC server maps the received CC SETUP message to an ISUP IAM. The MGCF
maps the ISUP IAM to a SIP INVITE request which is addressed to the IUA PSI
DN.

contact address by the MSC Server enhanced for ICS during registration.
9\. **SIP 100 (Trying) response (from MSC Server enhanced for ICS to
intermediate IM CN subsystem entities)**
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS responds to the intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities with a SIP 100 (Trying) response. There is no ICS specific content in
this response.
10\. **SETUP message (from MSC Server enhanced for ICS to CS UE)**
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS identities the subscriber using the Request-
URI and initiates the paging procedure towards the terminating CS UE. After
the CS UE has successfully accessed the network, the MSC Server enhanced for
ICS sends a SETUP message towards the CS UE according to 3GPP TS 24.008 [7],
providing the interworking as described in 3GPP TS 29.292 [24].
Specifically for this signalling flow, the SETUP message includes:
\- Calling Party BCD Number information element = [(Numbering plan identifier
= ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number ),
(Presentation indicator=presentation allowed), (Screening indicator=network
provided), (Number digits = 1212551111)]
\- Bearer Capability 1 information element = [(information transfer capability
= speech)]
11\. **CALL CONFIRMED message (from CS UE to MSC Server enhanced for ICS)**
The CS UE sends a CALL CONFIRMED message towards the MSC Server enhanced for
ICS according to 3GPP TS 24.008 [7]. Specifically for this signalling flow,
the CALL CONFIRMED message includes:
\- Supported Codec List information element = {[(SysID 1 = UMTS), (Codec
Bitmap for SysID 1 = UMTS AMR2)], [(SysID 2 = GSM), (Codec Bitmap for SysID 2
= FR AMR, GSM EFR, GSM FR)]}
In this example, no Bearer Capability 1 information element is returned.
As the node terminating the out of band transcoder control procedures as
specified in 3GPP TS 23.153 [4A], the MSC Server enhanced for ICS selects a
single selected codec.
12\. **Reserve / Configure RTP (from MSC Server enhanced for ICS to CS-MGW)**
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS performs CS-MGW selection and requests the CS-
MGW to prepare for network side bearer establishment. The MSC Server enhanced
for ICS removes the video media description from the SDP offer and then
requests reservation and configuration of a local RTP endpoint. The MSC Server
enhanced for ICS also sends the selected speech codec and the remote user
plane RTP information received from the SDP offer to the CS-MGW. The MSC
Server enhanced for ICS receives the local RTP endpoint information from the
CS-MGW.
13\. **SIP 183 (Session Progress) response (from MSC Server enhanced for ICS
to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) - see example in table A.5.1-13**
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS returns an SDP answer. The video media
description has been removed and only the audio media description is included.

The SDP answer in the 183 (Session Progress) response contains a single
selected codec and a request for confirmation of when remote preconditions are
met.
14-16. **SIP 183 (Session Progress) response (from intermediate IM CN
subsystem entities to SCC AS)**
The SIP 183 (Session Progress) response is routed to the originating IM CN
subsystem via the SCC AS and intermediate IM CN subsystem entities. In this
example the SCC AS includes the contents of the Contact header from the
received SIP 183 (Session Progress) response except the g.3gpp.ics media
feature tag which is removed by the SCC AS. When sending the SIP 183 (Session
Progress) response to the initial INVITE request (i.e. received in step 4
above), the SCC AS includes its SIP URI in the Record-Route header field and
forwards the SIP 183 (Session Progress) response to the originating IM CN
subsystem.
17-20. **SIP PRACK request and SIP 200 (OK) response**
The SIP PRACK request and its SIP 200 (OK) response are routed end-to-end
between the originating IM CN subsystem, intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities, SCC AS and MSC Server enhanced for ICS. There is no specific ICS
content in these messages. In this example the SCC AS includes the contents of
the Contact header from the received SIP PRACK request.
21-24. **SIP UPDATE request and SIP 200 (OK) response**
When the originating endpoint has completed its resource reservation, the
intermediate IM CN subsystem entities receive an UPDATE request. The UPDATE
request and its SIP 200 (OK) response are routed end-to-end between the
originating IM CN subsystem, intermediate IM CN subsystem entities, SCC AS and
MSC Server enhanced for ICS. There is no specific ICS content in these
messages. In this example the SCC AS includes the contents of the Contact
header from the received SIP UPDATE request.
25\. **Assignment**
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS performs access bearer assignment.
For UTRAN access this involves invocation of the Prepare Bearer and Change
Through Connection procedures with the CS-MGW, followed by sending a RAB
ASSIGNMENT REQUEST message to the UTRAN. The NAS Synchronization Indicator
information element is included to identify the selected codec and codec
configuration.
For GERAN access this involves invocation of the Reserve Circuit and Change
Through Connection procedures with the CS-MGW, followed by sending a
ASSIGNMENT REQUEST to the GERAN.
26\. **ALERTING message (from CS UE to MSC Server enhanced for ICS)**
The CS UE sends an ALERTING message to the MSC Server enhanced for ICS
according to 3GPP TS 24.008 [7].
27\. **Start tone (from MSC Server enhanced for ICS to CS-MGW)**
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS instructs the CS-MGW to start ringback tone.
28\. **SIP 180 (Ringing) response (from MSC Server enhanced for ICS to

The MSC Server enhanced for ICS does not include \"100rel\" in the Require
header field as the 180 (Ringing) response does not contain SDP and therefore
need not be sent reliably.

**Contact:** the MSC Server enhanced for ICS includes the GRUU received at
registration, the media feature tag g.3gpp.icsi-ref set to \"urn%3Aurn-7%3gpp-
service.ims.icsi.mmtel\" and the media feature tag g.3gpp.ics set to
\"server\".
35-37. **SIP** **200 (OK) response**
The 200 (OK) response is routed to the originating IM CN subsystem via the SCC
AS and intermediate IM CN subsystem entities. In this example the SCC AS
includes the contents of the Contact header from the received SIP 200 (OK)
response except the g.3gpp.ics media feature tag which is removed by the SCC
AS.
38\. **CONNECT ACK request (from MSC Server enhanced for ICS to CS UE)**
After through-connecting the traffic channel, the MSC Server enhanced for ICS
sends a CONNECT ACKNOWLEDGEMENT message to the CS UE according to 3GPP TS
24.008 [7].

the MSC Server enhanced for ICS. There is no ICS specific content in this
message.
## A.5.2 Signalling flows for termination to a CS UE not registered in IMS
Figure A.5.2-1 shows the termination of a call to a CS UE not registered in
the IM CN subsystem.
Figure A.5.2-1: CS UE Termination to UE not registered in the IM CN subsystem
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
**Steps 1 through 5 are identical to the example is subclause A.5.1.**
6\. **Domain selection**
The SCC AS acting performs terminating access domain selection based on
operator and user preferences, registration and call states; in this example,
the user is not registered in the IM CN subsystem and the SCC AS selects
breakout to the CS domain to terminate the call.
7\. **CSRN retrieval**
The SCC AS determines the CS domain Routing Number (CSRN).
NOTE: CSRN retrieval is implementation specific.
8\. **SIP INVITE request (from SCC AS to intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities) - see example in table A.5.2-8**
The SCC AS acting as a routing B2BUA generates a SIP INVITE request.

**Request-URI** : the CSRN.
**Feature-Caps** : The header field contains g.3gpp.ics feature-capability
indicator indicating support of IMS Centralized Services.
**Via:** the SCC AS, acting as a B2BUA, replaces the Via header field with one
containing only its own SIP URI.
9\. **SIP 100 (Trying) response (from intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to
SCC AS)**
The intermediate IM CN subsystem entities respond to the SCC AS with a SIP 100
(Trying) response. There is no ICS specific content in this response.
10\. **SIP INVITE request (from intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to
BGCF)**
The S-CSCF determines the destination is in the CS domain (e.g. after ENUM/DNS
translation fails to translate the CSRN in tel URI format to a globally
routeable SIP URI). The S-CSCF forwards the INVITE request to a BGCF in the
local network.
11\. **SIP 100 (Trying) response (from BGCF to intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities)**
The BGCF responds to the intermediate IM CN subsystem entities with a SIP 100
(Trying) response. There is no ICS specific content in this response.
12\. **SIP INVITE request (from BGCF to MGCF)**
The BGCF analyzes the destination address and allocates a MGCF to handle the
termination. The BGCF forwards the INVITE request to the MGCF.
In this example, the BGCF does not add itself to the Record-Route header field
and will therefore not be in the session path of subsequent SIP requests.
13\. **SIP 100 (Trying) response (from MGCF to BGCF)**
The MGCF responds to the MGCF with a SIP 100 (Trying) response. There is no
ICS specific content in this response.
14-18. **SIP 183 (Session Progress) response**
The SIP 183 (Session Progress) response is routed to the originating IM CN
subsystem via the SCC AS and intermediate IM CN subsystem entities. In this
example the SCC AS includes the contents of the Contact header from the
received SIP 183 (Session Progress) response.
19-22. **SIP PRACK request and SIP 200 (OK) response**
The SIP PRACK request and its SIP 200 (OK) response are routed end-to-end
between the originating IM CN subsystem, intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities, SCC AS and MGCF. There is no specific ICS content in these messages.
In this example the SCC AS includes the contents of the Contact header from
the received SIP PRACK request.
23-26. **SIP UPDATE request and SIP 200 (OK) response**
When the originating endpoint has completed its resource reservation, the
intermediate IM CN subsystem entities receive an UPDATE request. The UPDATE
request and its SIP 200 (OK) response are routed end-to-end between the
originating IM CN subsystem, intermediate IM CN subsystem entities, SCC AS and
MGCF. There is no specific ICS content in these messages. In this example the
SCC AS includes the contents of the Contact header from the received SIP
UPDATE request.
27-31. **SIP** **180 (Ringing) response (from MGCF to intermediate IM CN
subsystem entities)**
The SIP 180 (Ringing) response is routed to the originating IM CN subsystem
via the SCC AS and intermediate IM CN subsystem entities. The MGCF does not
include \"100rel\" in the Require header field as the 180 (Ringing) does not
contain SDP and therefore need not be sent reliably.
32-36. **SIP** **200 (OK) response**
The 200 (OK) response is routed to the originating IM CN subsystem via the SCC
AS and intermediate IM CN subsystem entities.
37-41. **SIP ACK request**
A SIP ACK request is routed end-to-end from the originating IM CN subsystem to
the MGCF. There is no ICS specific content in this message.
## A.5.3 Signalling flows for termination to an ICS UE with CS media using Gm
reference point when using an MSC server enhanced for ICS
Figure A.5.3-1 shows the termination of a call to an ICS UE using CS bearers
controlled through the IM CN subsystem. In this example the MSC Server is
enhanced for ICS and is capable of translating NAS signalling received from
the ICS UE to SIP and vice versa.
Figure A.5.3-1: ICS UE termination with CS media using Gm reference point when
using an MSC Server enhanced for ICS
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
1\. **SIP INVITE request (originating IM CN subsystem to intermediate IM CN
subsystem entities in terminating network) -- see example in table A.5.3-1**
In this example, the originating UE initiates a voice call though its home IM
CN subsystem (home2) with a terminating UE which is ICS capable which is in a
different network (home1).

NOTE 1: This example assumes the session was originated from a 3GPP Release 8
IMS UE and thus includes the ICSI value defined for MMTel in the Contact
header field and Accept Contact header field. However, termination procedures
for ICS do not rely upon the MMTel ICSI value being present in the incoming
request.
2\. **SIP 100 (Trying) response (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to
originating IM CN subsystem)**
The intermediate IM CN subsystem entities respond to the originating IM CN
subsystem with a SIP 100 (Trying) response. There is no ICS specific content
in this response.
3\. **Evaluation of initial filter criteria**
The S-CSCF evaluates initial filter criteria for the served ICS user and as a
result routes the SIP INVITE request towards the SCC AS.
NOTE 2: for terminating scenario, the SCC AS is configured as the last AS in
the terminating iFC chain.
4\. **SIP INVITE request (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to SCC AS) --
see example in table A.5.3-4**
As a result of iFC evaluation, the S-CSCF routes the INVITE request to the SCC
AS.

5\. **SIP 100 (Trying) response (SCC AS to intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities)**
The SCC AS responds to the intermediate IM CN subsystem entities with a SIP
100 (Trying) response. There is no ICS specific content in this response.
6\. **Terminating Access Domain Selection**
The SCC AS performs Terminating Access Domain Selection and chooses the CS
domain for the setup of the media.
7\. **SIP INVITE request (SCC AS to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) --
see example in Table A.5.3-7.**
The SCC AS, acting as a routing B2BUA, generates a SIP INVITE request based
upon the received SIP INVITE request and send it to the intermediate subsystem
entities. The SDP indicates that the ICS UE B should establish a CS media
bearer.

12\. **SIP 183 (Session Progress) response (intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities to SCC AS)**
The SIP 183 (Session Progress) response is routed towards the SCC AS.
13\. **SETUP message (ICS UE B to MSC Server enhanced for ICS)**
The ICS UE B inititates bearer setup in the CS domain by sending a SETUP
message to the MSC Server enhanced for ICS.
Specifically for this signalling flow, the SETUP message includes:
\- Called Party Number information element = = [(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number ),
(Number digits = 1212556666)]. The Called Party Number information element is
set to the **SCC AS** PSI DN.
\- Bearer Capability information element = [(information transfer capability =
speech), (speech versions = FR AMR, GSM EFR, GSM FR)]
\- Supported Codec List information element = {[(SysID 1 = UMTS), (Codec
Bitmap for SysID 1 = UMTS AMR 2)], [(SysID 2 = GSM), (Codec Bitmap for SysID 2
= FR AMR, GSM EFR, GSM FR)]}
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS knows the calling party number corresponding
to the ICS UE B.
14\. **CALL PROCEEDING message (MSC Server enhanced for ICS to ICS UE B)**
Upon receipt of the SETUP message from the ICS UE B, the MSC Server enhanced
for ICS responds with a CALL PROCEEDING message. There is no ICS specific
content in this message.
15\. **SIP INVITE request (MSC Server enhanced for ICS to intermediate IM CN
subsystem entities) -- see example in table A.5.3-15.**
The MSC Server enhanced for ICS maps the received SETUP message to a SIP
INVITE request which is routed towards the intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities. The INVITE request is addressed to the **SCC AS** PSI DN in the
Request-URI.

## A.5.4 Signalling flows for termination to an ICS UE with CS media using Gm
reference point when using an MSC Server not enhanced for ICS
Figure A.5.4-1 shows the termination of a call to an ICS UE using CS bearers
controlled through the IM CN subsystem. In this example the MSC Server is not
enhanced for ICS thus translation at the MGCF of ISUP message to SIP messages
is required.
Figure A.5.4-1: ICS UE termination with CS media using Gm reference point when
using an MSC Server not enhanced for ICS
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
1-12. These steps are identical to steps 1-12 described in subclause A.5.3
(Signalling flows for termination to an ICS UE with CS media using Gm
reference point when using an MSC Server enhanced for ICS)
13\. **ISUP IAM message (MSC Server not enhanced for ICS to MGCF)**
The MSC Server not enhanced for ICS maps the received SETUP message to an ISUP
IAM message that is routed towards the MGCF.
Specifically for this signalling flow, the IAM includes:
\- Called Party Number parameter = [Numbering plan identifier = ISDN/telephony
numbering plan], (type of number = international number), (Number digits =
12125556666)]. The Called Party Number is set to the **SCC AS** PSI DN, as
received in the SETUP message.
\- Calling Party Number parameter = [(Numbering plan identifier =
ISDN/telephony numbering plan), (type of number = international number),
(Number digits = 12125552222)]
14\. **SIP INVITE request (MGCF to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) --
see example in Table A.5.4-14.**

## A.5.5 Signalling flows for termination to an ICS UE with CS media using Gm
reference point when using an MSC Server enhanced for ICS and UE assisted
T-ADS
Figure A.5.5-1 shows the termination of a call to an ICS UE using CS bearers
controlled through the IM CN subsystem. In this example the MSC Server is
enhanced for ICS and is capable of translating NAS signalling received from
the ICS UE to SIP and vice versa. In this example, the UE supports UE assisted
terminating access domain selection.
Figure A.5.5-1: ICS UE termination with CS media using Gm reference point when
using an MSC Server enhanced for ICS -- UE assisted T-ADS
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
1-5: **These steps are identical to steps 1-5 described in subclause A.5.3.**
The SDP shows that local preconditions on the originating side are met.
6\. **Terminating Access Domain Selection**
The SCC AS performs initial T-ADS selecting IMS for the service control
signalling when UE-B is registered in the IMS.
7\. **SIP INVITE request (SCC AS to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) --

# A.6 Signalling flows for supplementary service invocation for ICS
## A.6.1 Communication Hold/Resume with Announcement
Figure A.6.1-1 provides the example flow for ICS Communication Hold/Resume
with Announcement over Gm reference point for the ICS UE. The SCC AS shown
together with MRF is for the purpose of simplifying the signalling flow.
Figure A.6.1-1: ICS Communication Hold/Resume with Announcement over Gm
reference point
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
**1\. Session establishment**
It is assumed that as a result of ICS UE origination procedure defined in
subclause A.4.2 .ICS UE A establish a multimedia session with UE B.
**2\. SIP re-INVITE request (ICS UE A to intermediate IM CN subsystem
entities) -- see example in table A.6.1-2.**
UE-A sends a re- INVITE request to UE-B to hold the session. Hold is done by
changing the SDP attribute:
\"a=sendonly\", if the stream was previously a sendrecv media stream;
\"a=inactive\", if the stream was previously a recvonly media stream.

## A.6.2 Explicit Communication Transfer using Gm reference point, ICS UE as
transfer recipient
Figure A.6.2-1 describes how IMS consultative ECT is performed when ICS UE is
playing the role of transfer recipient using Gm reference point. The UE A has
a held call with UE C and a held call with ICS UE B before transfer.
Figure A.6.2-1: IMS Consultative ECT via Gm for ICS UE (transfer recipient)
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
**1\. Session establishment and Communication HOLD**
It is assumed that as a result of ICS UE origination procedure defined in
subclause A.4.2 , ICS UE B establish a multimedia session with UE A and
session between UE A and UE C on HOLD according to the procedure specified in
subclause A.6.1.
**2\. SIP REFER request (UE A to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) \--
see example in table A.6.2-2.**
UE A initiates transfer of ICS UE B to UE C by sending a REFER request to ICS
UE B as specified in 3GPP TS 24.173 [9]
It contains following parameters.
**Request-URI:** contains the public GRUU of ICS UE B.
**Refer-To** : contains the GRUU of UE C.
**Referred-By:** contains the public user identity of the referring user. As
in this example, the referring user UE A has decided to indicate its own
identity to the referred user.
**Target-Dialog** : contains the dialog parameters of the dialog between UE-A
and UE B.

**3\. SIP REFER request (intermediate IM CN subsystem entities to SCC AS) \--
see example in table A.6.2-3**
The intermediate IM CN subsystem entities forward the REFER request to SCC AS
via Transferor AS, the Transferor AS will change the Refer-To header field
value to ECT Session Identifier that is shown as private-URI in the flow,
according to 3GPP TS 24.629 [19].

## A.6.3 Communication Waiting
### A.6.3.1 Communication Waiting when using Gm
Figure A.6.3.1-1 illustrates the signalling flows for the Communication
Waiting service when using Gm service control. This example shows an active
session between the UE C and the ICS UE B with CS media bearer. The waiting
session between UE A and the ICS UE B reuses CS media bearer. There can be
other cases where the active session uses an IP media bearer and the waiting
session uses a CS bearer and thus the CS bearer needs to be established.
Alternatively the active session can use a CS bearer and T-ADS decision for
the waiting call can result in deciding to use an IP media bearer.
Figure A.6.3.1-1: Signalling flows for Communication Wait using Gm service
control
The details of the signalling flows are as follows:
1\. **Active session between UE C and ICS UE using CS bearers for media**
An active session exists between UE C and ICS UE. The ICS UE uses CS bearers
for the audio media.
**2\. SIP INVITE request (UE A to intermediate IM CN subsystem entities) \--
see example in table A.6.3.1-2.**
UE A originates a SIP INVITE request in order to establish a session with ICS
UE, and thus the SIP INVITE request is forwarded towards the intermediate IM
CN subsystem entities in the terminating network.
