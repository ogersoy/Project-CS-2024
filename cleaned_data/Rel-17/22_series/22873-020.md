# 5 Use cases
## 5.1 Conference call with AR holography
### 5.1.1 Description
International companies have offices all over the world. The staffs of the
company may have conference calls very often. If AR holography can be applied
in the conference call, and AR holography data can be transmitted in the
conference call session, all the staffs can feel the expression and action of
the other parties, or even communicate with each other through body gestures.
It just feels like having face-to-face meeting at the same location. It can
really improve the immersive experience of the conference.
### 5.1.2 Pre-conditions
User A, user B and user C are the staffs of the same company but in different
location. They always have to discuss their product schemes through conference
call. Each of their own office has AR holography camera.
### 5.1.3 Service Flows
  1. User A, user B and user C plan to have a conference call to discuss the latest product scheme.
  2. Each of them goes to their own office in which there is an AR holography camera.
  3. When meeting begins, they all initiate the AR holography camera. The AR cameras scan their whole bodies, then have the data processed in a dedicated device to build up the models of themselves.
  4. All the AR holography data will be uploaded to the IMS Application Server.
  5. After rendering, the AR holography data will be distributed to each end user in the conference call.
  6. When people who's in the conference call pick up their AR glasses, they can see the AR holography images of the other parties. The images can be updated in real time when conference call is processing.
Editor's note: The service flow may need to be improved.
### 5.1.4 Post-conditions
People in the IMS conference call can see the action and expression of the
other parties. They can present the product with their body gestures. They can
communicate and interact with each other (e.g., shaking hands, etc.). It just
feels like having face-to-face meeting at that moment.

Heading levels within an annex are used as in the main document, but for
Heading level selection, the \"A.\", \"B.\", etc. are ignored. e.g. **A.1.2**
is formatted using **_Heading 2_** style.
