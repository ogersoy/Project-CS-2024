### 6.1.2 Void
### 6.1.3 Void
### 6.1.4 Support of basic IP connectivity

adaptation to terminal capabilities, user preferences, subscriber priorities,
network conditions and/or other operator-defined criteria. Session adaptation
shall be under the control of the operator.
The Evolved Packet System shall support session control for multi-party
sessions (e.g. user-to-group) and shall provide a scalable solution.
In order to support the efficient routing of IP traffic, local breakout (see
Section 7.1.2) shall be supported.

one active PDN connections exchanging traffic with more than one peer
(external network or other UE), when the network policies and user
subscription allow it.
If a UE is under the coverage of 3GPP access and one or more non-3GPP
accesses, it shall be possible for the UE to communicate using multiple
accesses simultaneously.
The Evolved Packet System shall provide the system operator with the means to
control the number of simultaneously active PDN connections and combinations
thereof to and from a UE.
A single application running on the UE shall not be required to send and
receive traffic through multiple PDNs.
## 6.3 Quality of Service
The Evolved Packet System shall have the ability to provide a quality of
service equal to or better than the QoS requirements specified for GSM and
UMTS. Quality of Service from the customer\'s perspective is to be considered
in phases as specified in ETSI TS 102 250-1[6].
Figure 2: Phases of service use from customer\'s point of view
Figure 2 shows the different phases (Quality of Service aspects) during
service use from the customer\'s point of view.
The meaning of these QoS aspects are:
1) **Network Access:** The network indication on the display of the mobile is
a signal to the customer that he can use the service of this network operator
(or any other means to indicate to the user that a network is available).
2) **Service Access:** If the customer wants to use a service, the network
operator should provide him as fast as possible access to the service.
3) **Service Integrity:** This describes the Quality of Service during service
use.
4) **Service Retainability:** Service Retainability describes the termination
of services (in accordance with or against the will of the user).
In particular the Evolved Packet System shall provide for the following:
\- There should be no perceptible deterioration of audio quality of a voice
call during and following handover between dissimilar CS and PS access
networks, and transitions between PS access networks supporting different IP
protocol versions.
\- There should be no loss of data, as a result of handovers between
dissimilar fixed and mobile access systems, including those that support
different versions of the IP protocol.
\- There should be no discernable difference in perceived service quality for
users receiving services via unicast and users receiving the same service via
multicast.
\- The Evolved Packet System shall support QoS differentiations for unicast
bearers.
\- The Evolved Packet System shall support QoS backwards compatibility to
earlier 3GPP QoS releases.
\- It shall be possible for the Evolved Packet System to maintain end-to-end
QoS without modification when the terminal moves from one access system to a
new access system, and the new access system supports the required QoS.
\- It shall be possible for the Evolved Packet System to change QoS, when the
terminal moves from one access system to a new access system and the new
access system can not provide the same QoS as the old access system or the new
access system can provide higher QoS.
\- It shall be possible for the Evolved Packet System to support service
continuity for a terminal changing access system and the new access system
cannot provide the same QoS as the old one.
\- The Evolved Packet System shall support transport QoS differentiations for
multicast bearers.
\- It shall be possible for the Evolved Packet System to maintain QoS within a
multicast session without QoS changes for other members of the session when a
terminal joins or leaves the multicast session or moves to a new access
system.
\- The Evolved Packet System network shall support a minimum of 8 levels of
QoS in parallel.
\- The Evolved Packet System network shall support a minimum of 4 parallel RT
QoS levels with the appropriate QoS differentiation.
Note 1: The requirement for the number of simultaneously supported QoS levels
is independent of any MBMS QoS levels.
\- Multiple RT services, with similar QoS requirements, shall be served by the
same RT QoS level and multiple NRT services, with similar QoS requirements,
shall be served by the same NRT QoS level.
The maximum number of parallel RT and NRT services shall not be limited in the
Evolved Packet System including the UE. Only the number of parallel RT and NRT
QoS levels are limited to the upper value supported by the Evolved Packet
System.
\- Differentiated handling based on QoS is needed for different traffic types.
\- The Evolved Packet System shall support parallel operation of RT and NRT
services per user.
Note 2: The different QoS levels provided for RT and NRT services would be
differentiated with regards to e.g. maximum end-to-end delay, packet size,
packet drop percentage, etc. Bandwidth is not used to define a QoS level.
## 6.4 Support of Multicast and Broadcast Services
The Evolved Packet System shall be able to support Multicast and Broadcast
Services which shall be enhanced especially from some aspects, e.g. optimized
service provisioning procedures, better performance compared to current MBMS
system, and support of multiple access systems.
## 6.5 Support of Emergency Calls
The Evolved Packet System shall support IMS emergency calls applicable to the
PS domain, defined in TS 22.101 [21]
## 6.6 Differentiated paging for voice over E-UTRAN terminations
More efficient radio resource usage can be achieved by using a more aggressive
paging profile for voice over E-UTRAN services than for other services using
the IMS signaling bearer, requiring a distinction to be made between voice
over E-UTRAN and non-voice over E-UTRAN traffic.
As a network option, the EPS shall support a mechanism to apply a different
paging policy to E-UTRAN access for voice services vs. other services using
the IMS signaling bearer.

which context information is related with streaming route.
The 3GPP system shall be able to collect context information related to update

system shall support the operator or the 3rd party to configure which user
profile information belonging to the application server should be shared with
the 3GPP system.
According to operator's policy, the 3GPP system shall support the SHE which is
deployed in different local area (no matter belongs to operator or the 3rd
party) to configure which radio environment information can be shared to the
application layer which is hosted in the SHE.
According to operator's policy, the 3GPP system shall support the SHE which is
deployed in different local area (no matter belongs to operator or the 3rd

\- information on prioritized communication such as user subscription profile
and priority level, priority services (e.g., MPS, Emergency, and Public
Safety), application used for priority communications (e.g., voice, video, and
data) and traffic associated with priority communications (signalling and
media).
## 6.10 Support of MUSIM UE
### 6.10.1 Description
With the growing demand in the consumer market, some commercially deployed UEs
support more than one USIM (typically two)-. For example, a user can use the
MUSIM UE to install another USIM with local data service when traveling, or to
have both a work related USIM and a personal USIM. With support of MUSIM UEs
in the 3GPP system, the system performance and user experiences are expected
to be improved.

need to leave the current region. An operator may define network regions e.g.,
according to administrative domains. Local breakout is applicable for user-to-
user traffic as well as for 3GPP-operator provided services (including
internet access).
Local breakout shall be allowed independently from the access system being
used.
Local breakout shall be allowed in both the non-roaming and the roaming case.
The use of local breakout shall be authorised by the HPLMN. If local breakout
is not authorised, the user plane traffic shall be handled in the home routed
mode.
### 7.1.3 Fixed Access Systems
The Evolved Packet System shall be able to support fixed access systems with
very limited or no mobility functionality.
The Evolved Packet System shall be able to support mobility within and across
3GPP and non-3GPP access systems including fixed access systems
### 7.1.4 Service continuity
#### 7.1.4.1 General
Service shall be maintained during and following changes of 3GPP access
systems and non 3GPP systems.
Service shall be maintained during and following a change of network in either
direction between a Rel-7 and earlier network and an Evolved Packet System.
It shall be possible to support Inter-PLMN handover with seamless service
continuity within a 3GPP specified access system (UTRAN, E-UTRAN).
When the access system changes, Multicast and Broadcast services shall be able
to continue with their corresponding Multicast and Broadcast services, if the
corresponding services are provided in the target access system.
NOTE: Corresponding Multicast and Broadcast services are the Multicast and
Broadcast services in the target access system which is associated to the
Multicast and Broadcast services in the source access system, providing
similar service experience, e. g. with same content but different bit-rate.
The 3GPP system shall minimise packet loss during inter- and/or intra- access
technology changes for some or all connections associated with a UE.

Figure 4: Inter-PLMN handover with seamless service continuity within a 3GPP
specified access system
#### 7.1.4.2 Service continuity at domain and RAT change for TS 11, TS 12 and
equivalent PS service
It shall be possible to support continuity of an established voice call, i.e.
between a TS11, TS12 and an equivalent PS service, when the UE moves between
two different domains and RATs. The user experience shall be as far as
possible unaffected by the change of domain and RAT. The RAT change procedure
executed to enable service continuity for an established voice call shall
target an interruption time not higher than 300 ms.
RAT change and domain selection shall be under the control of the registered
PLMN. When the UE is roaming, it shall be possible for the VPLMN to take into
account any user\'s HPLMN operator policy.
To support service continuity of an established voice call a UE shall not be
required to support simultaneous radio transmission via different 3GPP defined
RATs
NOTE: In the case of CS emergency calls (TS12) the service continuity at
domain and RAT change can only be performed if IMS emergency calls are
supported by the target system.
#### 7.1.4.2A Voice Call Service continuity between 3GPP defined RATs and non
3GPP defined RATs
Continuity of an established voice call, i.e. between a TS11 and an equivalent
PS service, when the UE moves between 3GPP defined RATs and non 3GPP defined
RATs, shall be supported provided that the non-3GPP defined RATs is connected
to the 3GPP system via the Evolved Packet Core.
The user experience shall be as far as possible unaffected by the change of
RAT.
#### 7.1.4.3 Service continuity between E-UTRAN and 3GPP2 accesses on Evolved
Packet Core
The Evolved Packet System shall support bidirectional service continuity
between cdma2000 1xRTT Revision A [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]
and E-UTRAN.
Note 1: if bi-directional support is not practical, service continuity from
E-UTRAN to cdma2000 1xRTT Revision A should have the higher priority.
Note 2: The CS component of cdma2000 1xRTT Revision A is not expected to be
connected to the Evolved Packet Core.
The Evolved Packet System shall support bidirectional service continuity
between cdma2000 HRPD (1xEV-DO) Revision A [17], [14], [15], [16] and E-UTRAN
for best effort and real-time applications.
The Evolved Packet System shall support bidirectional service continuity
between cdma2000 HRPD (1xEV-DO) Revision 0 [18], [14], [15], [16] and E-UTRAN
for best effort applications.
#### 7.1.4.4 Service continuity between 3GPP and WiMAX access on Evolved
Packet Core
The Evolved Packet System shall support bidirectional service continuity
between Mobile WiMAX [20], [22], [23], [24] and GERAN PS.
The Evolved Packet System shall support bidirectional service continuity
between Mobile WiMAX [20], [22], [23], [24] and UTRAN PS.
The Evolved Packet System shall support bidirectional service continuity
between Mobile WiMAX [20], [22], [23], [24] and E-UTRAN.
NOTE: The above requirements assume that the service continuity takes place
through the Evolved Packet Core.
### 7.1.5 Access network discovery
To avoid unnecessary background scan by the UE and to facilitate service
continuity by the UE it shall be possible for the VPLMN and the HPLMN to
provide the UE with access network information pertaining to locally supported
non-3GPP access technologies, in a resource efficient and secure manner. This
mechanism is meant to facilitate changes, including service continuity,
between 3GPP access systems and non 3GPP access systems and vice versa. The
information may be restricted to the access technologies the UE can use. To
reduce battery drain, a UE should minimise the frequency of scanning for
different access technologies.
When discovering non-3GPP accesses a UE shall be able to receive information
from a non-3GPP access network concerning to which PLMN, or PLMNs, the
non-3GPP access network provides access.
NOTE: The capability to provide such information by a non-3GPP access network
is out of scope of 3GPP.
When a UE receives service via a non-3GPP access it shall be possible for the
PLMN that provides the non-3GPP access to indicate local availability of 3GPP
access to the UE,, in a secure manner, subject to capabilities of the non-3GPP
access network.
### 7.1.6 Steering of access
When a UE is accessing the Evolved Packet Core via E-UTRA, the operator of the
PLMN that provides the access (registered PLMN or RPLMN for short) may request
the UE to use - any or a specific - non-3GPP RAT. Similarly, if a UE is
accessing the Evolved Packet Core via a non-3GPP RAT then the RPLMN may want
to request the UE to use E-UTRA. The reason for such steering may be load
balancing (for camped- and traffic load balancing), operator policy, private
networks/home cells, service based mobility control etc.
The RPLMN shall be able to download on the UE a list of preferred access
technologies in priority order. If, while the UE is registered on that PLMN,
an access technology with higher priority than the one currently used is
detected, the UE shall attempt to use the higher priority access network to
access the RPLMN.
The UE shall only perform access technology selection within the RPLMN.
In case the UE is connected to the PLMN via a non-3GPP access, then the PLMN
reselection procedures specified for that access technology may be executed.
Note 1: The PLMN operator may provide access to the Evolved Packet Core either
through an own access network (E-UTRA or non-3GPP access) or in collaboration
with an access network operator that operates a non-3GPP access network.
Note 2: A specific non-3GPP RAT may e.g. be identified by RAT type and the
access network name (as advertized by the access network), or a list of access
network names.
The HPLMN may also provide the UE with a list of preferred access technologies
in priority order for use in the RPLMN. Only one list of preferred access
technologies can be active at a time and the list provided by the RPLMN takes
precedence over the list provided by the HPLMN. The list of preferred access
technologies received from the VPLMN is specific to that VPLMN and PLMNs
equivalent to it.
### 7.1.7 CS fallback
#### 7.1.7.1 General
For those services delivered via the HPLMN that the HPLMN only supports in the
CS domain (e.g. voice services), when such services are invoked while the UE
is configured to use CS Fallback and registered in the E-UTRAN (either in the
HPLMN or in a VPLMN), it shall be possible for the EPS to request the UE to
perform a change of radio access technology in order to deliver the service
over UTRAN or GERAN or 1xRTT.
In the case of an incoming CS service to a UE that is registered for CS
services and active in E-UTRAN, the EPS shall transfer the CLI to the UE if
available and the calling party has not restricted the presentation, prior to
triggering CS fallback. Depending on UE configuration and when the UE is in
connected mode, the user or an application on behalf of the user may request
to accept or reject CS fallback before performing a change of radio access
technology. The default behaviour of the UE is to accept the CS fallback.
CS fallback shall not be applicable to an Indirect 3GPP Communication.
NOTE: An Evolved ProSe UE-to-Network Relay that is also in a Direct 3GPP
Communication with the network may be subject to CS fallback in the Direct
3GPP Communication. In this case, any Indirect 3GPP Communication supported by
the Evolved ProSe UE-to-Network Relay would have to be discontinued.
#### 7.1.7.2 Roaming in a VPLMN not supporting CS fallback
When a UE that is configured to use CS fallback registers over E-UTRAN in a
VPLMN not supporting CS fallback the default behaviour of the UE is to attempt
to select a GERAN/UTRAN/1xRTT CS radio access technology in the VPLMN or in a
PLMN equivalent to the VPLMN. The default behaviour of the UE is not to
autonomously attempt to (re-)select the E-UTRAN for the duration of the time
the UE stays in a VPLMN and PLMNs equivalent to the VPLMN.
The default behaviour may be changed based on user preference settings.
The UE may offer the user to perform a PLMN scan and display the list of
available PLMNs. The selection of a different PLMN is performed using the
manual mode.
### 7.1.8 Service Reachability
The Evolved Packet System may provide functionality to enable user access to
PLMN IP-based services from outside of the PLMN\'s domain via non-3GPP access
technologies under conditions where there are IP traffic-flow restrictions
(e.g. allow only HTTP traffic). Such functionality is known as Service
Reachability.
When the Evolved Packet System provides Service Reachability, the following
requirements apply:
\- pre-existing EPS security shall be maintained; and
\- the third party that placed the IP traffic-flow restriction shall be able
to prohibit Service Reachability by blocking PLMN IP-based services
intentionally.
Note 1: Examples of a third party include enterprises and internet service
providers whose traffic restriction lie outside the operator\'s domain.
Note 2: Service Reachability can also be achieved by the network operator
remotely configuring the elements with firewall function, provided there is a
trust relationship between the network operator and the operator of the
elements with firewall function.
## 7.2 IFOM Service requirements
Simultaneous active mode of operation is an optional capability for multimode
UEs, which support 3GPP and WLAN access. UE supporting simultaneous active
mode of operation between one set of technologies may not be capable to
support simultaneous active mode of operation between a different technology
set (e.g. due to radio interference limitations).
The following requirements apply to the case of UEs with multiple interfaces
which will simultaneously connect to 3GPP access and one single WLAN access.
\- It shall be possible to provide service continuity when the UE moves from
the 3GPP access to WLAN access and vice versa.
\- If the UE is under the coverage of more than one access, including 3GPP and
WLAN accesses and communicates using multiple accesses simultaneously, it
shall be possible to select one access when a flow is started and re-
distribute the flows to/from a UE between accesses while connected.
\- It shall be possible for the operator to enable and control via policies
the simultaneous usage of multiple accesses.
\- It shall be possible to distribute IP flows to/from a UE between available
accesses based on the characteristics of the flows and the capabilities of the
available accesses, subjected to user\'s preferences and operator\'s policies.
\- It shall be possible for the operator to define policies for the control of
the distribution of IP flows between available accesses. Each policy shall
include a list of preferred accesses and whether the policy may be overridden
by the user\'s preferences.
NOTE: The possibility of manual selection or user override is not precluded.
> These policies may be defined per APN, per IP flow class under any APN or
> per IP flow class under a specific APN. The IP flow class identifies a type
> of service (e.g. IMS voice) or an operator defined aggregation of services.
>
> The policies apply with the following priority order:
  1. Policies per IP flow class under a specific APN.
  2. Policies per IP flow class under any APN.
  3. Policies per APN.
\- Distribution of flows to/from a UE between available accesses based on the
characteristics of the flows and/or the capabilities of the available accesses
shall be possible for flows exchanged by both operator controlled (e.g. IMS)
and non operator controlled (e.g. web and mail access) applications/services.
\- It shall be possible to move all the flows to/from a UE out of a certain
access in case the UE loses connectivity with that access (e.g. UE moves out
of coverage of a WLAN access while maintaining connectivity through the 3GPP
access).
\- Re-distribution of flows to/from a UE between accesses may be triggered by
changes to the characteristics of the flows (e.g. QoS requirements) or the
capabilities of the available accesses (e.g. due to network congestion,
mobility event, or UE discovers a new access) during the connection.
# 7A Requirements for Proximity Services
## 7A.0 General
The requirements listed in this clause (7A) exclude GSM and UMTS. Proximity
Services shall not impact either of GSM and UMTS.
## 7A.0A Feature description (Informative)
### 7A.0A.1 ProSe Discovery
ProSe Discovery identifies that ProSe-enabled UEs are in proximity of each
other, using E-UTRA (with or without E-UTRAN) or EPC when permission,
authorisation and proximity criteria are fulfilled. The proximity criteria can
be configured by the operator.
The use of ProSe Discovery must be authorised by the operator, and the
authorisation can be on a \"per UE\" basis, or a \"per UE per application\"
basis. An authorised application can interact with the ProSe Discovery feature
to request the use of certain ProSe Discovery preferences.
The network controls the use of E-UTRAN resources used for ProSe Discovery for
a ProSe-enabled UE served by E-UTRAN.
ProSe Discovery can be used as a standalone process (i.e. it is not
necessarily followed by ProSe Communication) or as an enabler for other
services.
### 7A.0A.2 ProSe Communication
ProSe Communication enables establishment of new communication paths between
two or more ProSe-enabled UEs that are in Communication Range. The ProSe
Communication path could use E-UTRA or WLAN. In the case of WLAN, only ProSe-
assisted WLAN direct communication (i.e. when ProSe assists with connection
establishment management and service continuity) is considered part of ProSe
Communication.
The network controls the use of E-UTRAN resources used for ProSe Communication
for a ProSe-enabled UE served by E-UTRAN. The use of ProSe Communication must
be authorised by the operator.
According to operator policy a UE\'s communication path can be switched
between an EPC Path and a ProSe Communication path and a UE can also have
concurrent EPC and ProSe Communication paths.
ProSe Communication is also facilitated by the use of an Evolved ProSe UE-to-
Network Relay, which acts as a relay between E-UTRAN and Evolved ProSe Remote
UEs. The use of this relay function is controlled by the network.
For Public Safety specific usage:
\- ProSe Communication can start without the use of ProSe Discovery if the
Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs are in Communication Range.
\- Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs must be able to establish the communication
path directly between Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs, regardless of whether
the Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE is served by E-UTRAN, as well as being able
to participate in ProSe Group Communication or ProSe Broadcast Communication
between two or more Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs which are in proximity.
Any of the involved Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs need to have authorisation
from the operator.
> \- In addition, ProSe Communication can also take place over a ProSe UE-to-
> UE Relay, a form of relay in which a Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE acts as
> a ProSe E-UTRA Communication relay between two other Public Safety ProSe-
> enabled UEs.
## 7A.1 General Requirements for Proximity Services
Based on operator policy and user choice, the proximity of two ProSe-enabled
UEs shall be determinable; for example, using direct radio signals or via the
operator network.
Subject to user and operator settings, the 3GPP system shall be able to
support the usage of WLAN direct discovery.
In the case the ProSe-enabled UE supports WLAN direct discovery, the 3GPP
network shall be able to configure applications in the UE to use E-UTRA direct
discovery or WLAN direct discovery or both for discovering other ProSe-enabled
UEs.
ProSe Discovery shall be able to determine whether or not other ProSe-enabled
UEs are of interest to a discovering ProSe-enabled UE. A ProSe-enabled UE is
of interest to a discovering ProSe-enabled UE if its proximity needs to be
known by one or more authorised applications.
Subject to user and operator settings, a ProSe-enabled UE shall be able to be
discoverable only by other ProSe-enabled UEs in proximity that are explicitly
permitted by the discoverable ProSe-enabled UE.
NOTE: \'explicitly permitted\' refers to Restricted ProSe Discovery.
Subject to user and operator settings, a ProSe-enabled UE shall be able to be
discoverable by all other ProSe-enabled UEs in proximity without explicit
permission. The ProSe-enabled UEs can be served by the same or different PLMN,
including when roaming.
NOTE: \'without explicit permission\' refers to Open ProSe Discovery.
All requirements for ProSe Discovery also apply when one or both of the ProSe-
enabled UEs involved in ProSe Discovery are roaming in a VPLMN.
Operator policy disabling or limiting individual ProSe features shall override
any user choice.
The following requirements apply to the case where ProSe-enabled UEs use
E-UTRA to determine proximity of other ProSe-enabled UEs:
\- The operator shall be able to dynamically control the proximity criteria
for ProSe Discovery. Examples of the criteria include radio range and
geographic range.
\- ProSe Discovery shall support a minimum of three range classes -- for
example short, medium and maximum range.
\- The operator shall be able to authorise per subscription the maximum range
class ProSe Discovery is allowed to use.
\- The ProSe Discovery process shall enable authorised applications to request
and to use a certain range class when discovering other ProSe-enabled UEs.
\- The ProSe Discovery process shall enable authorised applications to request
and to use a certain range class when the ProSe-enabled UE is being discovered
by other ProSe-enabled UEs.
NOTE: For the case where ProSe-enabled UEs use WLAN direct discovery to
determine proximity of other ProSe-enabled UEs, the range is determined by the
underlying technology.
The operator shall be able to dynamically control the proximity criteria for
any ProSe E-UTRA Communication (including ProSe E-UTRA Communication between
two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication and ProSe Broadcast
Communication). Examples of the criteria include: Communication Range, channel
conditions, achievable QoS.
The impact of ProSe Discovery and ProSe Communication on E-UTRA radio usage,
network usage and battery consumption should be minimized. This requirement
applies to any ProSe E-UTRA Communication between two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe
Group Communication, ProSe Broadcast Communication, and ProSe-assisted WLAN
direct communication.
ProSe shall support the simultaneous operation of a large number of
applications on a ProSe-enabled UE, ensuring that the 3GPP system provides
ProSe Discovery proximity information only to applications that were
authorised by the 3GPP operator.
An application on a ProSe-enabled UE shall be able to use ProSe Discovery to
request EPC ProSe to determine the proximity of another ProSe-enabled UE; EPC
ProSe shall be able to determine proximity of two ProSe-enabled UEs and inform
the requesting application of their proximity.
The operator shall be able to enable or disable the ProSe Discovery feature in
its network.
The system shall be capable of monitoring communication characteristics (e.g.
channel condition, QoS of the path, volume of traffic etc.) on the ProSe
E-UTRA Communication path, regardless of whether there is an existing data
session on the EPS path. This requirement applies to any ProSe E-UTRA
Communication between two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication and
ProSe Broadcast Communication. The monitored communication characteristics on
the ProSe E-UTRA Communication path (e.g. channel condition, QoS of the path,
volume of traffic etc.) may be different for ProSe E-UTRA Communication
between two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication and ProSe Broadcast
Communication.
The establishment of a user traffic session on the ProSe E-UTRA Communication
path and the switching of user traffic between a ProSe E-UTRA Communication
path and an EPC Path are under control of the network. This requirement
applies to any ProSe E-UTRA Communication between two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe
Group Communication and ProSe Broadcast Communication.
The Radio Access Network shall control the radio resources associated with the
ProSe E-UTRA Communication path. This requirement applies to any ProSe E-UTRA
Communication between two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication and
ProSe Broadcast Communication.
The ProSe mechanism shall enable the operator to change the communication path
of a user traffic session to a ProSe Communication path or EPC Path without
negatively affecting the QoS of the session. This requirement is not
applicable to ProSe Group Communication and ProSe Broadcast Communication.
The ProSe mechanism shall enable the operator to change the communication path
of a user traffic session of a ProSe-enabled UE to a ProSe Communication path
or EPC Path without negatively affecting the communication paths (including
ProSe Communication paths) of other ongoing user traffic sessions of this or
other ProSe-enabled UEs. This requirement is not applicable to ProSe Group
Communication and ProSe Broadcast Communication.
The ProSe mechanism shall enable the operator to change the communication path
of a user traffic session to a ProSe Communication path or EPC Path based upon
the QoS requirements of the session and the QoS requirements of other ongoing
sessions of this or other ProSe-enabled UEs. This requirement is not
applicable to ProSe Group Communication and ProSe Broadcast Communication.
The system shall be capable of selecting the most appropriate communications
path (ProSe Communication path or EPC Path), according to operator
preferences. This requirement is not applicable to ProSe Group Communication
and ProSe Broadcast Communication. The criteria for evaluation may include the
following, although not restricted to:
\- System-specific conditions: backhaul link, supporting links or EPC
performance;
\- Cell-specific conditions: for example cell loading;
\- ProSe and EPC Path conditions: Communication Range, channel conditions and
achievable QoS;
\- Service-type conditions: APN, service discriminator.
Subject to operator policy and user consent, the system shall be capable of
establishing a new user traffic session with a ProSe E-UTRA Communication
path, and maintaining both of the ProSe E-UTRA Communication path and the
existing EPC Path, when the UEs are determined to be in Communication Range
allowing ProSe E-UTRA Communication. This requirement applies to any ProSe
E-UTRA Communication between two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication
and ProSe Broadcast Communication. The UEs can be:
\- Served by the same PLMN, including when roaming; or
\- Served by different PLMNs, including when roaming.
NOTE: ProSe E-UTRA Communication between UEs served by different PLMNs can be
subject to the availability of suitable radio resources (e.g. shared RAN in a
MOCN/GWCN environment).
The 3GPP system shall be capable of moving a user traffic session from the EPC
Path to a ProSe E-UTRA Communication path, when the ProSe-enabled UEs are
determined to be in Communication Range allowing ProSe E-UTRA Communication.
This requirement applies to any ProSe E-UTRA Communication between two ProSe-
enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication and ProSe Broadcast Communication.
The 3GPP system shall be capable of moving a user traffic session from a ProSe
E-UTRA Communication path to an EPC Path. At a minimum, this functionality
shall support the case when the ProSe E-UTRA Communication path is no longer
feasible. This requirement applies to any ProSe E-UTRA Communication between
two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication and ProSe Broadcast
Communication.
When switching user traffic sessions between the ProSe E-UTRA Communication
and EPC Paths triggered by the network, disruption to the user shall be
minimized. This requirement is not applicable to ProSe Group Communication and
ProSe Broadcast Communication.
When switching user traffic sessions between the ProSe E-UTRA Communication
and EPC Paths triggered by the ProSe-enabled UE, disruption to the user shall
be minimized. This requirement is not applicable to ProSe Group Communication
and ProSe Broadcast Communication.
The HPLMN operator shall be able to authorize the ability of a ProSe-enabled
UE to use ProSe Communication, separately for the HPLMN and for roaming in
VPLMNs. This requirement applies to any ProSe E-UTRA Communication between two
ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication, ProSe Broadcast Communication
and ProSe-assisted WLAN direct communication.
The HPLMN operator shall be able to authorize the ability of a ProSe-enabled
UE to use ProSe Communication to communicate with ProSe-enabled UEs served by
a different PLMN. This requirement applies to any ProSe E-UTRA Communication
between two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication, ProSe Broadcast
Communication and ProSe-assisted WLAN direct communication.
The VPLMN operator shall be able to turn on or off the ability for all the
inbound roamers from a specific PLMN to use ProSe Communication. This
requirement applies to any ProSe E-UTRA Communication between two ProSe-
enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication, ProSe Broadcast Communication and
ProSe-assisted WLAN direct communication.
ProSe proximity information shall be suitable for integration with the
Location and Presence information used by the network to offer its services.
ProSe shall be able to accommodate potentially large numbers of concurrently
participating ProSe-enabled UEs.
ProSe Discovery and ProSe Communication shall be available to ProSe-enabled
UEs that are registered to a PLMN and are served by an E-UTRAN of said PLMN
even if potentially served by different eNBs. Whether or not UEs are served by
the same eNB, E-UTRAN resources involved in ProSe will be under real time 3GPP
network control.
The network shall be able to collect Discovery information from a ProSe-
enabled UE regarding which ProSe-enabled UEs are discovered to be in its
proximity. Restrictions due to regulation on data collection apply.
ProSe shall:
\- Allow a ProSe-enabled UE to selectively discover ProSe-enabled UEs of
interest;
\- Ensure that 3GPP UE/subscriber identifiers are not disclosed to
unauthorised parties when ProSe is used;
\- Allow both granting and revocation of discovery permissions;
\- Enable applications to individually request the setting of discovery
parameters, such as discovery range class.
A minimum set of ProSe Discovery and ProSe Communication capabilities for
applications may be defined and present on ProSe-enabled UEs, providing ProSe
features for applications.
The operator network shall be able to continuously control the use of E-UTRAN
resources for ProSe Discovery and ProSe E-UTRA Communication between UEs, as
long as these UEs are served by E-UTRAN and using operator\'s spectrum. This
requirement applies to any ProSe E-UTRA Communication between two ProSe-
enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication and ProSe Broadcast Communication.
Potential negative impact of ProSe on the E-UTRAN services should be
minimized. This requirement applies to any ProSe E-UTRA Communication between
two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication, ProSe Broadcast
Communication, and ProSe-assisted WLAN direct communication.
Subject to operator policies MOCN networks shall support establishing ProSe
Communication between ProSe-enabled UEs camping on the same radio access
network but served by different MOCN PLMNs. This requirement applies to any
ProSe E-UTRA Communication between two ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group
Communication, ProSe Broadcast Communication and ProSe-assisted WLAN direct
communication.
## 7A.2 Public Safety Specific Requirements for Proximity Services
A Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE with ProSe Discovery enabled for discovery of
other public safety UEs shall be able to discover other discoverable public
safety UEs, without network interaction if allowed by the operator, even when
served by E-UTRAN whether or not ProSe E-UTRA Communication is used (including
whether or not ProSe Group Communication or ProSe Broadcast Communication are
used).
NOTE: A network operator can provide additional services for public safety UEs
that are under 3GPP network coverage, such as providing accurate location
information through GPS data.
A user of a Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE shall be able to activate or
deactivate the UE\'s ProSe Discovery feature while served by E-UTRAN, if
allowed by the operator whether or not ProSe E-UTRA Communication is used
(including whether or not ProSe Group Communication or ProSe Broadcast
Communication are used).
ProSe shall not be available to ProSe-enabled UEs not served by E-UTRAN,
except in the following cases:
\- Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs can use ProSe when operating on public
safety spectrum even when not served by E-UTRAN. In this case, at least a one-
time pre-authorization to use ProSe is needed.
\- A Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE with ProSe Discovery enabled shall be able
to discover other discoverable Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs when some or
all of the Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs involved in ProSe Discovery are not
served by E-UTRAN, whether or not ProSe E-UTRA Communication is used
(including whether or not ProSe Group Communication or ProSe Broadcast
Communication are used).
A Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE shall be capable of determining autonomously
whether or not a discovered ProSe-enabled UE is a public safety UE.
The configuration of a Public Safety ProSe-enabled UE that allows the Public
Safety ProSe-enabled UE to discover other discoverable Public Safety ProSe-
enabled UEs shall be independent from its configuration to allow or not to
allow other Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs to discover it.
Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs whether they are served by E-UTRAN or not,
shall be capable of establishing a secure ProSe E-UTRA Communication on a
ProSe E-UTRA Communication path and exchange user traffic on public safety
spectrum, assuming they are in Communication Range, are authenticated and
authorised. This requirement applies to ProSe E-UTRA Communication between two
Public Safety ProSe-enabled UEs, ProSe Group Communication and ProSe Broadcast
Communication.
ProSe-enabled UEs shall not be able to use ProSe Discovery and/or
Communication services when in Limited Service state, except for Public Safety
ProSe-enabled UEs which shall be treated as out-of-coverage under the
following circumstances:
\- It cannot find a suitable cell of the selected PLMN
\- It receives a \"PLMN not allowed\" response to a registration request
\- It receives a \"GPRS not allowed\" response to a registration request

operator to provide additional access resources on a dynamic basis and to
provide service to more customers (e.g. at mass events).
Note 2: The degree of automation provided for network attachment is yet to be
determined, but is intended to simplify (or completely automate)
administration procedures.
## A.2 Use cases for Fixed Mobile Convergence
A family has purchased a family subscription plan that is independent of
access (e.g. fixed or wireless) and location (e.g. both when at home and away
from home). The subscription contains at least the following components:
  * Internet access: Operator specific service such as firewall and content filtering (parental control) independent of access for selected devices within the family. The service should be available at home, within the home mobile network and when roaming to a visited mobile network.
  * Voice/Multimedia: QoS and mobility between home WLAN and LTE wide area
  * Charging schemas connected to access type, preference and location
  * Video: Premium Video on Demand Service incl. guaranteed bandwidth and QoS regardless of access network.
**Description**
**Use case 1: Internet access with Parental control and personal firewall**
The kids leave their house and take a bus to their grandparents\' house.
The operator specific services, like parental control and personal firewall,
are invoked for specific users and terminals from both fixed network and from
mobile network; this allows the kids to get the same service and filtering
inside the home, in the bus going to grandparents and at the grandparents. In
this use case the grandparents have a separate service provider than the
family but the services will still be provided by the service provider where
the family has a subscription.
**Use case 2: Voice/Multimedia and Charging**
The father travels home after work while talking on the phone with his
colleague.
The ongoing Voice/Multimedia call between the father and his colleague is
maintained while switching over between LTE Wide area and residential fixed
broadband WLAN network. Once the call is switched over to WLAN charging for
home-based access is applied. Bandwidth and QoS is maintained for the duration
of the call to guarantee the same service delivery.
**Use case 3: Video**
The kids in the backseat of the car are watching an Internet TV show on their
laptop using LTE while driving home from the grandparent\'s house.
The TV show is sent from an Internet TV provider. Once home the terminal
detects indoor WLAN coverage where the subscriber has a WLAN Residential
Gateway connected to his Fixed Broadband network. The user or the terminal
automatically may select to switch the IP connection to the wireline broadband
connection and enable the user to resume watching the same TV show on the same
laptop, possibly with a better quality picture as allowed by the available
bandwidth, user-specific policy, network policy and QoS setting.
**Use case 4: H(e)NB/Femtocell**
**A subscriber desires to improve coverage and access speed for their 3GPP
device in their home. They purchase and install a small eNodeB (Femtocell AP)
device for their home which attaches to the home LAN and establishes a
connection back to the subscriber\'s mobile service provider network. The
mobile network provider coordinates with the broadband access provider to
deliver proper bandwidth and QoS to support a good QoE for calls and data
sessions made within the home that access services from the mobile network.
The Femtocell also allows some types of data traffic to be shared with the
home LAN, including traffic for Internet applications. Local traffic can be
discerned and accounted for differently than traffic that is carried on the
mobile network.**
**Use case 5: Application Mobility**
**A subscriber is in a multimedia call on their mobile device, and then wishes
to change the device they are using to a fixed network attached device (e.g.
Set Top Box / TV). The multimedia call is handed over from the mobile network
to the fixed network after the subscriber chooses to transfer the multimedia
call to a STB / TV. Bandwidth and QoS is maintained for the large screen
experience to be meaningful. Accounting and settlement is supported among the
application and network service providers, and reflects the changes to the
access technology and required bandwidth.**
**Use case 6: Common Quota**
A Common Quota (CQ) can be assigned for both fixed and mobile accesses for a
limited time period for a defined set of subscriptions. During each session
the network elements monitor the CQ which may be consumed by one or more
devices over either the wireless or fixed networks.
When a defined percentage of the CQ and/or all the CQ has been consumed, one
or more subscribers in the defined set can be notified of the event (e.g. via
SMS and/or email).
When the CQ has been consumed the access to the services is blocked.
**Use case 7: Video On Demand Service**
Video On Demand (VoD) service is provided to the subscriber via the Set Top
Box to the TV or to the PC. A user orders a VoD service interacting with the
VoD infrastructure, which sends a resource request to the network. The user
may also request mid-session requests triggering the increase/decrease of
network resources. The requests will be accepted or rejected according to the
available network resources.
**Use case 8: Broadband Access Wholesale**
In Broadband network the wholesale scenario is quite important as it may be
required by the regulation, known as unbundling (access, connectivity and
services). For example the operator of the broadband access network lease/sell
transport of the connection through its own network from the user to the buyer
/ leased network. So in the wholesale scenario the renting operator has the
end-to-end Service responsibility to the customer and is viewed as the
\"Retailer\" of the service or application. While the leasing network operator
has the responsibility for the access network and for the connectivity.
###### ## Annex B (Normative): Void
###### ## Annex B1 (Informative): Interworking between Mobile Operators and
Data Application Providers
This Annex provides various scenarios and use cases applicable for
interworking between mobile operators and data applications.
## B1.1 Scenarios
Figure 1 shows the non-roaming scenario where the mobile operator owns the EPS
as well as application layer entities. Access and IP connectivity is provided
by the mobile operator. Application platforms, also provided by the mobile
operator, shown in the figure connect to the core network directly.
Application platforms could be application servers (e.g. Video on Demand
Server, PSS Server, MTC Server, etc.). Applications developed using APIs (e.g.
REST, GSMA OneAPI) and resident on the API Gateway are connected to the
operator core network via the API Gateway. The dashed lines between Operator
CN and IMS as well as API Gateway are already specified.

Figure 1: Operator owned non-roaming scenario
Figure 2 provides the non-roaming scenario where the mobile operator does not
own all the application layer entities. Access and IP connectivity is provided
by the mobile operator. The 3rd party Application Platforms in this figure
could be application servers (e.g. Video on Demand Server, PSS Server, MTC
Server, etc.) or could be 3rd party software development platforms. The
horizontal line represents the demarcation between the mobile operator domain
and the 3rd party application provider domain. The mobile operator and 3rd
party application providers may have agreements.
{width="6.6930555555555555in" height="3.2993055555555557in"}
Figure 2: Collaborative non-roaming scenario
Figure 3 provides the roaming scenario for both the above owned and
collaborative scenarios. This figure shows the home-routed scenario where all
traffic is routed to home mobile operator EPS and applications are delivered
via roaming agreements between mobile operators.

Figure 3: Operator owned/collaborative roaming scenario -- Home Routed
Figure 4 provides the roaming scenario between mobile operators and 3rd party
application provider domains. In this scenario the application provider has
agreements with visited mobile operator. This figure shows the local-breakout
scenario where all traffic is routed to application domain from the visited
operator network.

## B1.2 Use cases
### B1.2.1 Use cases for owned / collaborated scenarios.
**Pre-conditions**
A data application provider X develops an application customized for streaming
high definition movies to the mobile end user over 3GPP access.
The data application provider X develops this application specifically for a
mobile network operator (MNO) Y. The data application provider X hosts this
application and establishes agreements with a mobile network operator (MNO) Y
to pilot the service. Authentication and charging are provided by the MNO Y.
The data application provider X can collaborate with other MNOs as well.
Alice has subscribed to a 3GPP device and video services from the MNO Y.
**Use case 1: Authentication and Authorization**
Alice gets onto a train for 4-hour long ride to a neighboring country. She
turns on her device and looks at the movie catalog. She decides to view a
movie and selects the movie offered by the data application provider X and
watches it without worrying about the radio access network she is using and
any additional login/password procedures.
**Use case 2: Allocation of resources and other policy interactions**
All along the MNO Y manages the resources and the QoS needed for high
definition movie streaming to Alice. On the train, Alice gets distracted by
the scenery and misses a few scenes. She rewinds and views the missing scenes.
**Use case 3: Simultaneous interactions with multiple application providers**
Alice comes across an interesting gadget in the movie and decides to pause on
that scene and get a higher resolution closeup view. The close up view prompts
an advertisement to pop up for the gadget. Based on this advertisement, Alice
purchases the gadget. She is given the choice of paying immediately or being
charged on her MNO monthly bill. She decides to charge to her MNO bill.
**Use case 4: Roaming**
Alice continues watching the movie and the train crosses the country border.
She starts roaming into another MNO Z, which has roaming agreement with MNO Y.
The movie quality is unaltered in the process of roaming.
**Use case 5: Charging**
She gets a bill from the MNO at the end of the month which includes the price
for the movie she watched on the train and the gadget she purchased.
