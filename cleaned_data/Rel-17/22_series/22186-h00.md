# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Categories of requirements to support eV2X scenarios
Different V2X scenarios require the transport of V2X messages with different
performance requirements for the 3GPP system. This Technical Specification
specifies service requirements to enhance 3GPP support for V2X scenarios in
the following six areas:
\- General Aspects: interworking, communication-related requirements valid for
all V2X scenarios
\- Vehicles Platooning
\- Advanced Driving
\- Extended Sensors
> \- Remote Driving
\- Vehicle quality of service Support
Vehicles Platooning enables the vehicles to dynamically form a group
travelling together. All the vehicles in the platoon receive periodic data
from the leading vehicle, in order to carry on platoon operations. This
information allows the distance between vehicles to become extremely small,
i.e., the gap distance translated to time can be very low (sub second).
Platooning applications may allow the vehicles following to be autonomously
driven.
Advanced Driving enables semi-automated or fully-automated driving. Longer
inter-vehicle distance is assumed. Each vehicle and/or RSU shares data
obtained from its local sensors with vehicles in proximity, thus allowing
vehicles to coordinate their trajectories or maneuvers. In addition, each
vehicle shares its driving intention with vehicles in proximity. The benefits
of this use case group are safer traveling, collision avoidance, and improved
traffic efficiency.
Extended Sensors enables the exchange of raw or processed data gathered
through local sensors or live video data among vehicles, RSUs, devices of
pedestrians and V2X application servers. The vehicles can enhance the
perception of their environment beyond what their own sensors can detect and
have a more holistic view of the local situation.
Remote Driving enables a remote driver or a V2X application to operate a
remote vehicle for those passengers who cannot drive themselves or a remote
vehicle located in dangerous environments. For a case where variation is
limited and routes are predictable, such as public transportation, driving
based on cloud computing can be used. In addition, access to cloud-based back-
end service platform can be considered for this use case group.
Vehicle quality of service support enables a V2X application to be timely
notified of expected or estimated change of quality of service before actual
change occurs and to enable the 3GPP System to modify the quality of service
in line with V2X application's quality of service needs. Based on the quality
of service information, the V2X application can adapt behaviour to 3GPP
System's conditions. The benefits of this use case group are offerings of
smoother user experience of service.
4.2 Level of Automation
A relevant aspect of advanced V2X applications is the Level of Automation
(LoA), which reflects the functional aspects of the technology and affects the
system performance requirements. In accordance with the levels from SAE [4],
the LoA are: 0 -- No Automation, 1 -- Driver Assistance, 2 -- Partial
Automation, 3 -- Conditional Automation, 4 -- High Automation, 5 -- Full
Automation.
A distinction is drawn between lower levels and higher levels based on whether
the human operator or the automated system is primarily responsible for
monitoring the driving environment.
The 3GPP system provides the performances expected for all levels of
automation

5.6 Requirements to support vehicle quality of service
[R.5.6-001] The 3GPP system shall be able to provide a standardized interface
to V2X applications to enable the V2X application to adjust its service
offerings based on the quality of service of the ongoing connection or on the
estimated quality of service.
[R.5.6-002] The 3GPP system shall be able to authenticate and authorize V2X
application for requesting information on the quality of service of the
ongoing connection or on the estimated quality of service.
[R.5.6-003] The 3GPP system shall be able to provide quality of service
information to the V2X application in a resource efficient way.
[R.5.6-004] The 3GPP system shall be able to support an efficient and secure
mechanism to gather information (e.g. location information, reliability
information, timing information, latency information, velocity information),
in order to generate information about quality of service in a resource
efficient way.
[R.5.6-005] The 3GPP system shall be able to support continuity of reporting
estimated quality of service for a UE even when the PLMN serving the UE
changes.
[R.5.6-006] The 3GPP system shall be able to provide V2X applications with
estimated quality of service information for a certain geographic area and
time.
[R.5.6-007] The 3GPP system shall be able to provide a V2X application with
quality of service parameters that can be provisioned for connection for a
certain geographic area in a certain time.
[R.5.6-008] The 3GPP system shall be able to notify V2X applications with
updated estimation of unfulfillment (or re-fulfilment) of quality of service
for a certain geographic area, at least a certain amount of time before when
the actual change occurs.
[R.5.6-009] On request by the V2X application, the 3GPP system shall be able
to provide information on whether connectivity with specific quality of
service is expected to be fulfilled in a certain geographical area and at a
certain time.
[R.5.6-010] The 3GPP network shall notify a V2X application that the current
quality of service of a UE's ongoing communication might be unfulfilled (or
re-fulfilled) in the future.
[R.5.6-011] The 3GPP system shall be able to support negotiating quality of
service alternatives with the V2X application.
[R.5.6-012] The 3GPP system shall be able to provide V2X applications with
updated quality of service from the quality of service alternatives previously
negotiated by the V2X application, when the quality of service of the UE's
ongoing connection changes.
[R.5.6-013] The 3GPP system shall be able to support a V2X application to
request connectivity with specific quality of service parameter for a certain
geographic area and time.
[R.5.6-014] The 3GPP system shall be able to provide a V2X application with
response on whether the request of connectivity service with specific quality
of service parameter for a certain geographic area and a certain time is
accepted or not.

###### ## Annex B (informative): Relation between TS 22.185 and this TS
3GPP Technical Specification on Service Requirements for V2X Services [3] was
developed with focus on basic safety aspect and non-safety aspect using LTE-
based technology. This Technical Specification on Enhancement of 3GPP Support
for V2X Services was developed with focus on enhancements of V2X Use Case
scenarios, including more rigorous functional requirements for advanced
features that cannot be achieved by [3].
###### ## Annex C (informative): Relationship between V2X applications and V2X
requirements
In this specification, performance requirements for various scenarios are
defined. KPIs of the various scenarios are not mutually exclusive. When
several V2X applications are simultaneously running in the vehicle, total
performance requirement to serve that vehicle is not the sum of individual
performance requirement of each V2X application:
\- Different use cases or applications may use and share same V2X message. For
example, according to ETSI TS 102.637, information included in a DENM message
can be used by multiple applications such as emergency electronic brake
lights, wrong way driving warning and so on. Thus, there is no need for each
application to generate separately V2X messages.
\- According to ETSI EN 302.665, V2X application layer is separated from V2X
Facilities layer. V2X applications do not have V2X message handling
capabilities, and this is left to V2X Facilities layer. Because V2X Facilities
layer serves all V2X applications, the V2X Facilities layer can optimize V2X
message handling, by considering overall requirements of different V2X
applications.
Figure C-1 shows one of example configuration where multiples V2X applications
and one common V2X message handling entity exist. Because only one driving
wheel, one accelerator and one brake exist in a vehicle, the applications in a
vehicle may either be combined or operate in a harmonized fashion. Then, V2X
messages are also used in a harmonized fashion.

Annex D (informative):\ Role model for service exposure for Estimation
In relation to the service requirements in section 5.6, following figure shows
the role model for the involved entities. Data gathering entity gathers
relevant data that can be used as an input to estimation entity. The data can
be statistical data, historical data and etc. Based on the data provided by
data gathering entity, estimation entity makes an estimation that is requested
by third parties. The result of estimation is provided from 3GPP system to
third party. While interface from 3GPP system toward third party and interface
among entities within 3GPP system is standardized, how actual estimation
mechanism is performed within estimation entity or how much the estimation is
accurate is out of 3GPP scope.
