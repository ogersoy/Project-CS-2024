# Introduction
Interest in using cellular connectivity to support Uncrewed Aerial Systems
(UAS) is strong, and the 3GPP ecosystem offers excellent benefits for UAS
operation. Ubiquitous coverage, high reliability and QoS, robust security, and
seamless mobility are critical factors to supporting UAS command and control
functions. In parallel, regulators are investigating safety and performance
standards and Registration and licensing programs to develop a well-
functioning private and civil UAS ecosystem which can safely coexist with
commercial air traffic, public and private infrastructure, and the general
population.
The 3GPP system can provide control plane and user plane communication
services for UAS. Examples of services which can be offered to the UAS
ecosystem includes data services for command and control (C2), telematics,
UAS-generated data, remote identification, and authorisation, enforcement, and
regulation of UAS operation.
# 1 Scope
The present document identifies the requirements for operation of Uncrewed
Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) via the 3GPP system.
This includes requirements for meeting the business, security, and public
safety needs for the remote identification and tracking of UAS linked to a
3GPP subscription.

# 4 Overview on UAS
## 4.1 General
An Uncrewed Aerial System (UAS) is the combination of an Uncrewed Aerial
Vehicle (UAV), sometimes called a drone, and a UAV controller. A UAV is an
aircraft without a human pilot onboard -- instead, in some cases. the UAV can
be controlled from an operator via a UAV controller and will have a range of
autonomous flight capabilities. The communication system between the UAV and
UAV controller is, within the scope of this specification and in some
scenarios, provided by the 3GPP system. The UAS model considers also the
scenario where the UAV controller communicates with the UAV via mechanisms
outside the scope of 3GPP.
UAVs range in size and weight from small, light aircraft often used for
recreational purposes to large, heavy aircraft which are often more suited to
commercial applications. Regulatory requirements vary across this range and
vary on a regional basis.
The communication requirements for UAS cover both the Command and Control
(C2), and uplink and downlink data to/from the UAS components towards both the
serving 3GPP network and network servers. The applicable C2 communication
modes is depicted in clause 4.2.
Uncrewed Aerial System Traffic Management (UTM) is used to provide a number of
services to support UAS and their operations including but not limited to UAS
identification and tracking, authorisation, enforcement, regulation of UAS
operations, and also to store the data required for UAS(s) to operate. It also
allows authorised users (e.g., air traffic control, public safety agencies) to
query the identity and metadata of a UAV and its UAV controller.
## 4.2 C2 Communication
When using 3GPP network as the transport network for supporting UAS services,
the following C2 communication are considered to provision UAS services by
guaranteeing QoS for the C2 communication:
**Direct C2 communication** : the UAV controller and UAV establish a direct C2
link to communicate with each other and both are registered to the 5G network
using the radio resource configured and scheduled provided by the 5G network
for direct C2 communication.
**Network-Assisted C2 communication** : the UAV controller and UAV register
and establish respective unicast C2 communication links to the 5G network and
communicate with each other via 5G network. Also, both the UAV controller and
UAV may be registered to the 5G network via different NG-RAN nodes. The 5G
network needs to support mechanism to handle the reliable routing of C2
communication.
**UTM-Navigated C2 communication** : the UAV has been provided a pre-scheduled
flight plan, e.g. array of 4D polygons, for autonomous flying, however UTM
still maintains a C2 communication link with the UAV in order to regularly
monitor the flight status of the UAV, verify the flight status with up-to-date
dynamic restrictions, provide route updates, and navigate the UAV whenever
necessary.
In general, Direct C2 communication and Network-Assisted C2 communication are
used by a human-operator using a UAV controller. UTM-Navigated C2
communication is used by the UTM to provide cleared flying routes and routes
updates. In order to ensure the service availability and reliability of the C2
communication for UAS operation, especially when the UAV is flying beyond line
of sight (BLOS) of the operator, redundant C2 communication links can be
established for any C2 communication links from UAV controller or UTM to a
UAV.
For reliability and service availability consideration, it is possible to
activate more than one C2 communication with one as a backup link for C2
communication or switch among the applicable links for C2 communication.
\- For example, Direct C2 communication can be used at first and then switch
to the Network-Assisted C2 communication when the UAV is flying BLOS.
\- For example, UTM-navigated C2 communication can be utilized whenever
needed, e.g. for air traffic control, the UAV is approaching a No Drone Zone,
and detected potential security threats, etc.
There are four control modes considered in the C2 communication for the UAV
operation that are with different requirements, e.g. on message intervals,
sizes, and end to end latencies, etc., including steer to waypoints, direct
stick steering, automatic flight by UTM and approaching autonomous navigation
infrastructure.
  * Steer to waypoints: the control message contains flight declaration, > e.g. waypoints, sent from the UAV controller or UTM to the UAV. > The control mode is used in both of direct C2 communication and > network-assisted C2 communication.
  * Direct stick steering: the control message contains direction > instructions sending from the UAV controller to the UAV while > optionally video traffic is provided as feedback from the UAV to > the UAV controller. The control mode is used in both of direct C2 > communication and network-assisted C2 communication.
  * Automatic flight by UTM: the control message contains a > pre-scheduled flight plan, e.g. array of 4D polygons, sent from > the UTM to the UAV, which thereafter flies autonomously with > periodic position reporting. The control mode is used in > UTM-Navigated C2 communication.
  * Approaching autonomous navigation infrastructure: the control > message contains direction instructions, e.g. waypoints, altitudes > and speeds from the UTM to the UAV. When the UAV is > landing/departing, the UTM coordinates more closely with > autonomous navigation infrastructure, e.g. vertiport or package > distribution center. The control mode is used in UTM-Navigated C2 > communication.

# 7 Performance requirements
## 7.1 KPIs for services provided to the UAV applications
The 5G system shall be able to provide uncrewed aerial vehicle with the
service performance requirements reported in Table 7.1-1.
UAV originated QoS in the table refers to the QoS of Uplink data (e.g. from
UAV to the network side). UAV terminated QoS is the QoS of downlink data (e.g.
from the network side to UAV).
The data transmitted by the 5G system includes data collected by hardware
devices installed on UAV such as cameras, e.g. pictures, videos and files. It
is also possible to transmit some software calculation or statistical data,
e.g. UAV management data. The service control data transmitted by the 5G
system may be based on application triggers, such as switch, rotation,
promotion and demotion control of equipment on UAV. Various UAV applications
may require different uplink and downlink QoS at the same time. The 5G system
may simultaneously provide services to other users on the ground (e.g., the
KPIs for rural and urban scenarios as defined in 7.1 of TS 22.261 [4]) in the
same area without service degradation.

## 7.4 Other requirements
[R-7.4-001] The 5G system shall support a mechanism to switch between C2
communication modes for UAS operation, e.g. from indirect C2 communication to
direct C2 communication, and ensure the disconnect time is below the latency
requirements.
[R-7.4-002] The 3GPP system shall enable concurrent communications between the
UAV-controller and UAV and between the UTM and the UAV that may require
different KPIs.
[R-7.4-003] The 3GPP system shall be capable of switching between the KPIs, as
requested by the UAV-controller or the UTM, within [500ms].
###### ## Annex A (informative): UAS Reference Model
## A.1 UAS Reference Model in 3GPP ecosystem
Figure B.1-1: UAS model in 3GPP ecosystem.
In the UAS reference model:
\- a UAS is composed of one UAV and one UAV controller in this illustration
\- UAVs are connected over cellular connectivity
\- a UAV can be controlled by a UAV controller connected via the 3GPP mobile
network
\- a UAV can be controlled by a UAV controller not connected via the 3GPP
mobile network, using a C2 interface not in 3GPP scope
\- a UAV controller connected via the 3GPP mobile network can control one or
more UAV(s)
\- the UAS exchanges application data traffic with a UTM
NOTE: Several types of UAV controllers exist, e.g. hand-held UAV controllers,
PCs/WSs and automated or manual functions that are part of the UTM. The
mechanisms to ensure which UAV controller is active and controlling the UAV is
out of scope of 3GPP.
