# Introduction
The present document is structured in a similar manner to ETSI TS 181 005 [2]
and the main clause numbering from this point in the document onwards
therefore follows that document, with the scope of those clauses also
following that of ETSI TS 181 005 [2].
As well as the interconnection of NGCN equipment to the NGN, the NGN can be
used to host various business communication capabilities on behalf of an
enterprise. These are:
a) virtual leased line, where NGCN sites are interconnected through the NGN;
b) business trunking application, where the NGN hosts transit capabilities
between NGCNs, break-in capabilities from NGN to NGCN and break-out
capabilities from NGCN to NGN; and
c) hosted enterprise services, where an NGN hosts originating and/or
terminating business communication capabilities for business communication
users that are directly attached to an NGN.
These hosted capabilities may be hosted using the different capabilities
described in different clauses in ETSI TS 181 005 [2] and therefore where
appropriate the various clauses of the present document are broken up to
further describe interconnection requirements, and these various hosted
capabilities, as follows:
x.1 General;
x.2 NGN/NGCN interconnection requirements;
x.3 Specific requirements for hosted enterprise services;
x.4 Specific requirements for business trunking application; and
x.5 Specific requirements for virtual leased line.
This structure has been followed in 3GPP TS 22.519, even though 3GPP TS 22.228
[6] (the equivalent specification) is structured in a different manner.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies network requirements:
\- to support connection and interoperation of business communication
capabilities (either hosted in NGCN or NGN) to the NGN; and
\- to support connection and interoperation of business communication
capabilities to other business communication capabilities (either hosted in
NGCN or NGN); and
\- to support connection and interoperation of business communication
capabilities to other business communication capabilities located in or
connected to the ISDN and PSTN; and
\- to support PABX functionality (hosted enterprise services) in an NGN.
NOTE 1: Network requirements to support connection of NGCN directly connected
to an NGN are specified.
NOTE 2: Attachment of legacy PBX functionality to the NGN is not specified in
the present document. It is assumed that existing legacy service requirements
apply in this case.
The present document also specifies network requirements for communication
between NGCN capabilities (including user equipment) to other NGCN
capabilities of the same enterprise through the NGN (e.g. geographically
separated).
The present document does not specify NGCN services, nor does it specify
network based application services provided to a user of an NGCN.

takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[10].
**business communication: any communication that is either:**
  * originated in an NGCN; or
  * terminated in an NGCN; or
  * originated in the NGN on behalf of an enterprise; or
  * terminated in the NGN on behalf of an enterprise;
and which is subject to special arrangements between the NGN operator and the
enterprise

NOTE: A business trunking application may also provide additional services
beyond basic breakin, breakout and transit capabilities to the NGCN.
**corporate network user identifier:** identifies a corporate network user on
communications entering, leaving or transiting the NGN, either representing an
originating corporate network user or as a globally routable target identity
**Corporate telecommunication Network (CN):** sets of enterprise premises
equipment, owned by or managed on behalf of an enterprise that are located at
geographically dispersed locations and are interconnected to provide
telecommunication services to a defined group of users belonging to that
enterprise

## 4.1 General
### 4.1.1 Types of traffic
The traffic generated or received on behalf of an NGCN can be either:
1) traffic sent to the NGN for processing according to normal rules of the
NGN. This type of traffic is known as public network traffic;
2) traffic sent to the NGN for processing according to an agreed set of rules
specific to an enterprise. This type of traffic is known as private network
traffic. Private network traffic is normally within a single enterprise, but
private network traffic can also exist between two different enterprises if
not precluded for regulatory reasons.
NOTE: An enterprise network may separately distinguish private network calls
that originate in the NGN from private network calls that originate in the
enterprise; this does not form part of the present document.
The NGN shall distinguish public network traffic from private network traffic.
The NGN shall distinguish private network traffic belonging to one enterprise
from that belonging to another enterprise.
Private network traffic may require different handling in the NGN compared to
public network traffic, see for example clause 4.1.7 on regulatory
requirements.
Except between closely-related enterprises where regulations permit, the NGN
shall treat traffic between enterprises as public network traffic. In such
cases, as part of the capabilities provided to the enterprise, the NGN can
provide break-out and/or break-in capabilities on behalf of each enterprise.
For private network traffic the NGN shall be transparent to any extensions of
the chosen signalling protocol, except where there is a specific need for NGN
intervention required to deliver the service requested by the enterprise
customer.
### 4.1.2 Business communication capabilities
The NGN can provide the following capabilities to an enterprise:
a) virtual leased line, where NGCN sites are interconnected through the NGN.
No additional capabilities are provided by the NGN;
b) business trunking application, where the NGN hosts transit capabilities
between NGCNs, break-in capabilities from NGN to NGCN and break-out
capabilities from NGCN to NGN. A business trunking application may also host
additional capabilities beyond basic break-in, break-out and transit
capabilities to the NGCN. Typically there is no corporate network terminal
equipment connected directly to an NGN. The capabilities provided are defined
in clause 4.4;
c) hosted enterprise services, where an NGN hosts originating and/or
terminating business communication capabilities for business communication
users that are directly attached to an NGN and have an IMS service
subscription for this application in this NGN. This is known commonly as IP-
Centrex. The capabilities provided are defined in clause 4.3.
NOTE: NGCNs will not necessarily use IMS in their support of session-based
capabilities.
### 4.1.3 Business models
Additionally to the business domain relationships as specified in 3GPP TS
22.228 [6] the NGN shall support the following business domain relationships:
a) NGCN to IMS relationship: NGCN is attached to an Access network that is
connected to the NGN IMS with which the NGCN has a service agreement as shown
in figure 4.1, the relationship is with the home IMS.
Figure 4.1
d) NGCN to Access network relationship: NGCN is connected to an Access Network
as shown in figure 4.2. The relationships given in 3GPP TS 22.228 [6] would
normally be sufficient to enable connectivity with the NGN, providing there is
a relationship between the NGCN and the IMS. Relationship b may be required in
some cases.
Figure 4.2
NOTE: The Access Networks to which the various NGCN sites are connected may
belong to different operators.
The following business model relationship is shown as it plays a role in some
scenarios. The present document assumes the business relationships described
in item a) and b) and those as assumed from 3GPP TS 22.228 [6] in order to
create communications in support of this relationship:
e) NGCN to NGCN relationship: The relationship between two NGCNs is shown in
figure 4.3.
Figure 4.3
NOTE: Both NGCN 1 and NGCN 2 have their own relationship with an NGN. NGCN 1
and NGCN 2 may also represent parts of the same NGCN. Additionally NGCN 1 and
NGCN 2 may have relationships with different NGNs, which may belong to the
same or different operators.
Where the figures and text identify \"IMS\" forming the business relationship;
this can apply also to the usage of other subsystems in the NGN architecture.
Additionally to the interconnect models as specified in 3GPP TS 22.228 [6],
the NGN shall support:
\- an interconnect model where bi-lateral Service Level Agreements are
established between an NGCN and an NGN.
Business trunking applications are normally provided by the home IMS and
relationship a) is used to establish these capabilities, which in turn uses
relationships given in 3GPP TS 22.228 [6] for the access network related
relationship. Hosted enterprise services are normally provided by the home
IMS, the existing business relationships as specified in 3GPP TS 22.228 [6]
being sufficient to establish such capabilities.
Virtual leased line services can be supported directly using relationship b,
or it can be supported using relationship a) with the IMS which in turn uses
relationships given in 3GPP TS 22.228 [6] for the access network related
relationship.
Roaming of NGCN users is supported by either:
\- a combination of business model relationship a) with relationships in 3GPP
TS 22.228 [6] relationship with the visited IMS. No relationship is required
between the home NGCN and the visited NGN or access network.
Roaming of NGN users to NGCN is supported by:
\- a combination of business model relationship a) with relationships in 3GPP
TS 22.228 [6] relationship with the home IMS. No relationship is required
between the home IMS and the visited NGCN.
The service offering to an NGCN may be restricted by the capabilities of the
access network, the business agreement between the access network operator and
the NGN operator and the business agreement between the NGCN and NGN
operators.
### 4.1.4 Number, naming and addressing
3GPP TS 22.228 [6] provides requirements for the support of numbering to end
users of the NGN which apply equally for public network traffic generated by,
or received by a business communication capability.
For private network traffic generated by, or received by, a business
communication capability, the requirements of 3GPP TS 22.228 [6] apply along
with the following additional requirements:
1) the NGN shall support tel-URIs that encode a PNP number, the PNP used by
the enterprise shall be uniquely identified in this tel URI.
NOTE: Ensuring the uniqueness of the PNP identifier can be achieved by using a
domain name associated with the enterprise, that the PNP belongs to.
For public and private network traffic generated by, or received by, a
business communication capability, the requirements of 3GPP TS 22.228 [6]
apply along with the following additional requirements:
1) the NGN shall support usage of SIP URIs with a domain belonging to an
enterprise, and any usage of SIP URIs with a domain hosted by the enterprise;
and
```{=html}
``` 3) the NGN shall support usage of SIP URIs where more than one domain
belong to the same enterprise, and any usage of SIP URIs where more than one
domain is hosted by the same enterprise;
4) the NGN shall support usage of SIP URIs where a domain belonging to an
enterprise, is partly hosted in NGCN and partly hosted in NGN.
URIs prefixed with \"IM\" and \"Pres\" are supported as specified in 3GPP TS
22.228 [6].
### 4.1.5 Identification of session originator and terminator
As defined in 3GPP TS 33.203 [3] a trust domain is used for the management of
identities within enterprise network interconnection.
For identification, the requirements described in 3GPP TS 22.228 [6] are
supported to NGN users and users of business communications capabilities as
follows:
1) when the business communication capability is outside the trust domain, the
NGN asserts an identity that the NGN associates (by means of subscription
data) with the enterprise, in addition to delivering the identity of the
enterprise user as provided by the NGCN and which is not asserted by the NGN;
2) when the business communication capability is inside the trust domain, the
NGN presents the identity of the enterprise user as the asserted identity. The
NGN shall accept the asserted identity received from the NGCN; and
3) in order to support interworking with the PSTN/ISDN, and for other
purposes, an alias identity of the enterprise user can be needed. An alias set
for an enterprise user consists of:
a) a SIP URI not in the form of a public telecommunication number; and
b) one of either:
\- a public telecommunications number that reaches the same enterprise user;
or
\- a private network number that reaches the same enterprise user.
For enterprise users, it is the responsibility of the enterprise to provide
the alias set. The NGN shall be able to receive alias sets from the NGCN.
NGNs shall be able to deliver alias sets (of any user) to the NGCN.
The above requirements apply to the identities of both session originator and
session terminator.
### 4.1.6 Charging and accounting requirements
An enterprise can account for traffic in its business communication
capabilities whether hosted in an NGCN or NGN.
For public network traffic, the requirements of 3GPP TS 22.115 [8] apply.
For public network traffic, the enterprise and the NGN operator shall be able
to identify each other across any interconnection interface, including intra-
NGN interfaces to hosted business communication capabilities. For private
network traffic, any involved enterprise shall be able to identify each other
across any interconnection interface between its business communication
capabilities.
Any business communication capability hosted in an NGN shall be able to
account for private network traffic to the enterprise in the same manner as
exists for an NGN operator to account for their own traffic.
Additionally, for private network traffic, the enterprise and the NGN operator
shall be able to identify each other across any interconnection interface.
### 4.1.7 Regulatory requirements
#### 4.1.7.1 Lawful intercept
Lawful Intercept should be handled according to TS 33.106 [9].
#### 4.1.7.2 Emergency service
Both public network traffic and private network traffic may carry emergency
calls.
An emergency call identified as public network traffic shall be handled in
accordance with the emergency call requirements of the NGN, i.e. in accordance
with the requirements of 3GPP TS 22.228 [6].
In case of a public network traffic emergency call, an NGN shall forward
geographical location information received from an NGCN and possibly use it
for routing to an appropriate PSAP. This can be subject to both privacy and
regulatory requirements.
Routeing of calls identified as emergency calls in private network traffic is
outside the scope of NGN documents. The NGN shall not handle such calls as
specified in 3GPP TS 22.228 [6]. This also applies to a hosted NGCN
capability.
NOTE 1: Many enterprises will require the call to be routed to a private PSAP.
NOTE 2: Private numbering plans or dialling plans used within an enterprise
can reuse national emergency numbers (e.g. 112 in Europe) for other purposes
and can use a different number to denote an emergency call.
NOTE 3: Where an enterprise operates a private PSAP, it can require that calls
be routed to the private PSAP (or to one of several private PSAPs) or to a
public PSAP depending on circumstances. For example, for a caller physically
located within a particular enterprise site, routing to the private PSAP for
that site can be required, whereas for callers physically located elsewhere
routing to the public PSAP could be required.
#### 4.1.7.3 Identifying malicious communications
A call identified as public network traffic shall be handled in accordance
with the malicious call identification requirements of the NGN, i.e. in
accordance with the requirements of 3GPP TS 22.228 [6].
Identification of malicious calls in private network traffic is outside the
scope of NGN documents. The NGN shall not handle such calls as specified in TS
181 005 [2]. This also applies to a hosted NGCN capability.
NOTE: Separate regulatory requirements can apply for private network traffic,
or there is the possibility of no regulatory requirements at all.
#### 4.1.7.4 Anonymous communications rejection
A call identified as public network traffic shall be handled in accordance
with the anonymous call rejection requirements of the NGN, i.e. in accordance
with the requirements of 3GPP TS 22.228 [6].
Requirements for handling of anonymous calls in private network traffic are
outside the scope of NGN documents. The NGN shall not handle such calls as
specified in 3GPP TS 22.228 [6]. This also applies to a hosted NGCN
capability.
NOTE: Separate regulatory requirements can apply for private network traffic,
or there is the possibility of no regulatory requirements at all.
### 4.1.8 Mobility
#### 4.1.8.1 Roaming
The business models as expressed in 3GPP TS 22.228 [6] and clause 4.1.3 of the
present document allow several roaming scenarios. Important roaming scenarios
in the context of business communication are highlighted in this clause. These
scenarios apply whether the NGCN functionality is external to the NGN, or
hosted in the NGN.
For all scenarios both terminal mobility and personal mobility should be
supported as defined in 3GPP TS 22.228 [6].
An NGCN user should be able to register and receive service from their NGCN
while roaming to:
a) another NGCN site of the same NGCN and interconnected by the NGN; or
b) the NGN to which the NGCN is directly connected; or
c) the NGN to which the NGCN is indirectly connected via another NGN.
Over and above the roaming capabilities provided in 3GPP TS 22.228 [6], an NGN
user should be able to register and receive service from their NGN while
roaming to:
a) an NGCN connected to the NGN; or
b) an NGCN indirectly connected to the NGN;
subject to agreement with the NGCN.
### 4.1.9 Routing requirements
#### 4.1.9.1 Routing to a NGCN user
The NGN shall support routing to NGCN users that do not have an IMS service
subscription in the NGN, but can be reached through an NGCN site that has a
business trunking arrangement with an NGN.
NOTE: In this case an NGCN site has an IMS subscription, the corporate network
users in a NGCN do not need their own IMS service subscription, since they are
owned and managed by the NGCN. What this requirement achieves is that these
corporate network users can be reached from the public part of the NGN by
addressing them directly using a public address.
#### 4.1.9.2 number range based routing
The NGN shall support routing based on Recommendation ITU-T E.164 [1] number
ranges.
NOTE: To be able to route to corporate network users in an NGCN, it should be
possible to route only on a specific number range that is assigned to such an
NGCN.
### 4.1.10 Communication admission control
The NGN shall support Communication Admission Control on a per NGCN site
basis. The NGN operator defines the set of rules or policies under which this
should occur, and the NGCN operator should be able to configure the capability
within those rules and policies. It shall be possible to set the following
thresholds on a per direction basis (i.e. incoming and outgoing
communications):
\- maximum number of simultaneous session-oriented communications;
\- maximum number of simultaneous streams per communication;
\- maximum number of immediate messages.
Communications coming in excess to the allowed threshold may be accepted or
rejected.
NOTE: The enterprise may select values for communication admission control
that correspond to the Service Level Agreement (SLA) between the enterprise
and the operator. If this occurs, then communications coming in excess of the
allowed threshold which are accepted may be subject to specific charging
rules.
### 4.1.11 Geographical location
An NGN shall be able to provide to an NGCN the geographical location
information of an NGCN user. This can be subject to privacy requirements.
NOTE 1: An NGCN can use the geographical location information for example to
provide location based services to the NGCN user.
NOTE 2: The source of geographical location information may be an NGN or an
NGCN UE.
## 4.2 NGN/NGCN interconnection requirements
### 4.2.1 NGCN site identifier
NGN shall support identification of an NGCN site, for authentication and
authorization purposes.
NOTE 1: The NGCN site identification is needed to be able to let the NGN
determine which NGCN site a communication is originating from.
NOTE 2 An NGCN may have more than one NGCN site and hence more than one NGCN
site identifier associated.
### 4.2.2 Corporate network user identifier
In addition to the Naming, Numbering and Addressing requirements expressed in
3GPP TS 22.228 [6]and in clause 4.1.4 of the present document the NGN shall
provide the capability to uniquely identify NGCN users. NGCN user identities
are assigned by an NGCN operator.
NOTE 1: This does not exclude scenarios where one organization acting as an
NGN operator also in another role administers the NGCN of an enterprise on
behalf of that enterprise.
NOTE 2: The above requirement ensures that for communications from an NGCN
user to an NGN user the NGN user\'s OIP service can present the correct
identity of the calling NGCN user.
NOTE 3: The above requirement ensures that for communications from an NGN user
to an NGCN user the NGN user\'s TIP service can present the correct identity
of the called NGCN user.
NOTE 4: The above requirement ensures that NGN users can call NGCN users that
have identities within the set of identities that are available to that NGCN
under the business trunking arrangement for that NGCN.
### 4.2.3 Authentication and security requirements
Authentication and Security with regard to connection of an NGCN to the NGN
shall comply with security requirements specified in 3GPP TS 33.203 [3] and
3GPP TS 33.210 [4].
## 4.3 Specific requirements for hosted enterprise services
### 4.3.1 Security requirements for hosted enterprise services
When HES are being provided, a UE which is directly attached to or roams into
an IMS network (via UNI) shall comply to the IMS access security requirements
as specified in 3GPP TS 33.203 [3].
### 4.3.2 Capabilities provided to a HES user
The capabilities provided by such hosting towards HES users are not specified
further by the present document, except that such hosting can form an integral
part of any business communication support.
### 4.3.3 Capabilities provided to the enterprise
#### 4.3.3.1 Break-in
HES can provide break-in. Break-in is where public network traffic is accepted
from the public network and delivered to the HES user.
#### 4.3.3.2 Break-out
HES can provide break-out. Break-out is where private network traffic is
routed in the NGCN, or other business communication capability, to a point
where it can enter an NGN on terms advantageous to the NGCN operator. An HES
providing break-out therefore converts private network traffic to become
public network traffic. The purpose of this capability is to allow a call from
within the NGCN, or other business communication capability, to reach a user
outside the enterprise (e.g. in the NGN). The NGN operator defines the set of
rules or policies under which this should occur, and the NGCN operator should
be able to configure the capability within those rules and policies. As an
example, these rules and policies may be selected for tariff reasons, and the
point where the capability is applied may be dependent on both geographic
location and the NGN operator involved.
When break-out is provided, the HES shall convert any identities provided as
private network numbers to valid public telecommunication numbers.
## 4.4 Specific requirements for business trunking application
### 4.4.1 Routeing capabilities
#### 4.4.1.1 Overview
The business trunking application can provide a number of special routeing
capabilities. Examples of these are as follows:
\- Break-in.
\- Break-out.
\- Bulk rerouting.
#### 4.4.1.2 Break-in
A business trunking application can provide break-in. Break-in is where public
network traffic is routed in the NGN to a point where it can enter an NGCN, or
other business communication capability, on terms advantageous to the NGCN
operator. A business trunking application providing break-in therefore
converts public network traffic to become private network traffic. The purpose
of this capability is to allow a call from outside the NGCN to reach a user
within the enterprise. The NGN operator defines the set of rules or policies
under which this should occur, and the NGCN operator should be able to
configure the capability within those rules and policies. As an example, these
rules and policies may be selected for tariff reasons (for example such that
the NGCN operator can reduce the tariff to the calling user), and the point
where the capability is applied may be dependent on both geographic location
and the NGN operator involved.
#### 4.4.1.3 Break-out
A business trunking application can provide break-out. Break-out is where
private network traffic is routed in the NGCN, or other business communication
capability, to a point where it can enter an NGN on terms advantageous to the
NGCN operator. A business trunking application providing break-out therefore
converts private network traffic to become public network traffic. The purpose
of this capability is to allow a call from within the NGCN, or other business
communication capability, to reach a user outside the enterprise (e.g. in the
NGN). The NGN operator defines the set of rules or policies under which this
should occur, and the NGCN operator should be able to configure the capability
within those rules and policies. As an example, these rules and policies may
be selected for tariff reasons, and the point where the capability is applied
may be dependent on both geographic location and the NGN operator involved.
When break-out is provided, the business trunking application shall convert
any identities provided as private network numbers to valid public
telecommunication numbers.
#### 4.4.1.4 Bulk rerouting
A business trunking application can provide bulk rerouting. Bulk rerouting is
where private network traffic (possibly after break-in) destined for a
terminating NGCN site is routed to an alternative NGCN site or answer point.
This allows the NGCN site to be removed from service, e.g. overnight when it
is not attended, or under fault conditions. The NGN operator defines the set
of rules or policies under which this should occur, and the NGCN operator
should be able to configure the capability within those rules and policies.
These can include:
a) not reachable (e.g. all calls to a particular NGCN site are diverted to a
configured destination in case IP connectivity is lost between the network and
this NGCN site);
b) congestion; and
c) time and date (e.g. all calls to a particular NGCN site are rerouted to a
configured destination during closed hours).
### 4.4.2 Communication barring
Communication barring enables network rejection of incoming communications
that fulfil certain globally provisioned or configured conditions for a
particular NGCN site. The NGN operator defines the set of rules or policies
under which this should occur, and the NGCN operator should be able to
configure the capability within those rules and policies. The decision to
reject a communication shall be independent of the actual communication target
(i.e. which line behind the NGCN site is being targeted by the session).
# 5 PSTN/ISDN emulation service
Not in the scope of the present document.
# 6 Codecs services
Requirements on codec support in the network from TS 181 005 [2] clause 6
apply.
# 7 Network attachment requirements
## 7.1 General
Network attachment requirements from 3GPP TS 22.228 [6] apply.
## 7.2 Specific requirements for virtual leased line
### 7.2.1 Security requirements for virtual leased line
When Virtual Leased Line is being provided, the NGN shall comply to the
Communications and Data Security Requirements for Network Domain Security as
specified in 3GPP TS 33.210 [4].
# 8 CPE configuration
CPE in the context of the present document is NGCN site equipment that
connects to an NGN. Requirements on CPE configuration support in the network
from 3GPP TS 22.228 [8] clause 5 apply. No specific requirements for CPE
configuration support have been identified for business communication in this
release.
# 9 Control of processing overload
In addition to the control of processing overload requirements in TS 181 005
[2] clause 10, an NGN shall have mechanisms available to control overload at
the interconnect between that NGN and an NGCN. Where NGCN sites from multiple
enterprises are served by the same processing resource an NGN shall ensure
that overload affects traffic from and to NGCN sites of multiple enterprises,
and other traffic, fairly.
An NGN shall be able to provide to an NGCN site processing overload control
information, the NGCN site shall use this to regulate the load presented to
the NGN. How an NGCN site regulates the load presented to an NGN is outside
the scope of the present document.
An NGCN site shall be able to provide to an NGN processing overload control
information, an NGN shall use this to regulate the load presented to an NGCN
site.
NOTE: HES users will be treated in the same manner as ordinary NGN users.
# 10 IP addressing
Requirements on IP addressing support in the network from 3GPP TS 22.228 [6]
apply. For business communication capabilities hosted in an NGN, the IP
addressing support of that NGN applies.
# 11 NGN interconnection
Requirements on NGN interconnection support in the network from 3GPP TS 22.228
[6] apply. No specific requirements for NGN interconnection support have been
identified for business communication in this release.
# 12 Transport stratum
## 12.1 NGN/NGCN interconnection requirements
### 12.1.1 Redundancy support
An NGN may support the connection of multiple NGCN sites belonging to the same
enterprise, where an NGCN site B may serve as a redundant site for another
NGCN site A. Redundancy is needed to ensure reachability of the NGCN users
located in site A via the redundant site B.
When an NGN detects that an NGCN site cannot accept (totally or partially)
communications or detects a failure at the interconnect with the NGCN site,
then an NGN shall support failover mechanisms to the NGCN site serving as
redundant NGCN site.
## 12.2 Specific requirements for virtual leased line
NGN may provide the following capabilities:
\- A virtual leased line, where NGCN sites are interconnected transparently on
IP level through the NGN. (IP level VPN) No additional capabilities are
provided by the NGN.
\- A virtual leased line, where an NGCN UE (not directly connected to an NGCN
site, but connected at the transport stratum to the NGN) and an NGCN site are
interconnected transparently on IP level through the NGN. (IP level VPN) No
additional capabilities are provided by the NGN.
