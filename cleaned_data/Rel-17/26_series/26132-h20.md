# Introduction
The present document specifies test methods to allow the minimum performance
requirements for the electro-acoustic characteristics of GSM, 3G, LTE, NR and
WLAN terminals when used to provide narrowband, wideband, super-wideband or
fullband telephony to be assessed.
The objective for narrowband services is to reach a quality as close as
possible to ITU-T standards for PSTN circuits. However, due to technical and
economic factors, there cannot be full compliance with the general
characteristics of international telephone connections and circuits
recommended by the ITU-T.
The performance requirements are specified in TS 26.131; the test methods and
considerations are specified in the main body of the text.
# 1 Scope
The present document is applicable to any terminal capable of supporting
narrowband, wideband, super-wideband or fullband telephony, either as a stand-
alone service or as the telephony component of a multimedia service. The
present document specifies test methods to allow the minimum performance
requirements for the electro-acoustic characteristics of GSM, 3G, LTE, NR and
WLAN terminals when used to provide narrowband, wideband, super-wideband or
fullband telephony to be assessed.
NOTE For 3G, LTE, NR and WLAN, acoustic requirements are specified in TS
26.131, test methods are specified in TS 26.132. For GSM, most acoustic
requirements are specified in TS 43.050, test methods are specified in TS
51.010. These specifications are in many cases harmonized with or even refer
to TS 26.131 and TS 26.132. See TS 43.050 and TS 51.010 for details. The
reason for including GSM, UMTS, LTE, NR and WLAN terminals within the scope of
the present specification is to avoid, whenever possible, duplication of test
method descriptions for terminals supporting multiple access technologies..

# 4 Interface Definitions
## 4.1 General
The interfaces required to define terminal electro-acoustic characteristics
are the acoustical interfaces, the air interface and the point of interconnect
(POI), see Figure 1.
MTSI speech aspects are specified by TS 26.114 [39].
4.2 Air interfaces
The Air Interfaces for GSM, 3G, LTE and NR are specified by GSM 05, 3GPP 45,
3GPP 25, 3GPP 36 and 3GPP 38 series specifications, and the Air Interface for
WLAN access to EPC is specified by WLAN access to EPC as defined in 3GPP TS
23.402 [48] and TS 24.302 [49].
Measurements can be made using a system simulator (SS) comprising the
appropriate radio terminal equipment and speech transcoder. The delays, losses
and gains introduced by the test equipment shall be accounted for.
4.3 Acoustical interfaces
The POI with the public switched telephone network (PSTN) is considered to
have a relative level of 0 dBr.
Five classes of acoustical interface are considered in this specification:
\- Handset UE including softphone UE used as a handset;
\- Headset UE including softphone UE used with headset;
\- Vehicle Mounted Hands-free UE including softphone UE mounted in a vehicle;
\- Desktop-mounted hands-free UE including softphone UE with external
loudspeaker(s) used in hands-free mode;
\- Hand-held hands-free UE including softphone UE with internal loudspeaker(s)
used in hands-free mode.
(See definition of softphone in Clause 3.1)
NOTE: The test setup for a softphone UE shall be derived according to the
following rules:
\- When using a softphone UE as a handset: the test setup shall correspond to
handset mode.
\- When using a softphone UE with headset: the test setup shall correspond to
headset mode.
\- When a softphone UE is mounted in a vehicle: the test setup shall
correspond to vehicle-mounted hands-free mode.
\- When using a softphone UE in hands-free mode:
\- When using internal loudspeaker(s), the test setup shall correspond to
hand-held hands-free.
\- When using external loudspeaker(s), the test setup shall correspond to
desktop-mounted hands-free.
## 4.4 Electrical interfaces
An electrical interface is considered in this specification and details on
standardized analogue (wired) and digital (wired and wireless) headset
interfaces can be found in clause 5.1.6. For the electrical interface, the POI
in sending / receiving direction is respectively defined as the input / output
of the reference speech coder of the system simulator.
Any of the UE types mentioned in clause 4.3 providing an electrical interface
can be considered as Electrical Interface UE. These may be available as
analogue and/or digital interface type (see clause 5.1.6). The interface types
used for testing shall be reported.
# 5 Test configurations
This section describes the test setups for terminal acoustic testing.
The configurations are shown for one-channel (mono) operation, configurations
for two-channel (stereo) operation is for further study.
NOTE: If the terminal has several mechanical configurations (e.g., sliding
design open or closed), all manufacturer-defined configurations shall be
tested.
## 5.1 Setup for terminals
The general access to terminals is described in figure 1. The preferred
acoustic access to GSM, 3G, LTE, NR and WLAN terminals is the most realistic
simulation of the \"average\" subscriber. This can be made by using HATS (head
and torso simulator), with appropriate ear simulation and appropriate
mountings of handset terminals to the HATS in a realistic but reproducible
way. Hands-free terminals shall use the HATS or free field microphone
techniques in a realistic but reproducible way.
HATS is described in ITU-T Recommendation P.58 [15], appropriate ears are
described in ITU-T Recommendation P.57 [14] (Type 3.3), proper positioning of
handsets in realistic conditions is found in ITU-T Recommendation P.64, and
the test setups for various types of hands-free terminals can be found in
ITU-T Recommendation P.581.
Unless stated otherwise, if a volume control is provided, the setting is
chosen such that the nominal RLR is met as close as possible.
The preferred way of testing is the connection of a terminal to the system
simulator with exact defined settings and access points. The test sequences
are fed in either electrically using a reference codec, using the direct
signal processing approach, or acoustically using ITU-T specified devices.
The system simulator shall simulate the access network and core network
including the speech encoding/decoding specified for the test (e.g. AMR-NB or
AMR-WB) but excluding further transcoding beyond linear PCM, see Figure 1.
Unless specified otherwise for the respective test, the radio conditions on
the air interface shall have a block error rate of 0% and the jitter in the IP
transport for MTSI-based speech shall be ≤ 1 ms.
NOTE 1: For WLAN connections, an RF shielded room may be one way to achieve
these requirements on block error rate and jitter. Otherwise, care should be
taken with potential sources of radio interference and their impact.
In case of MTSI-based speech, the reference client shall allow to synchronize
to the clock of the device under test and include a de-jitter buffer to
equalize possible jitter in the signal received from the UE.
When operating with synchronized clock, the de-jitter buffer shall be a static
de-jitter buffer and the jitter buffer management shall not compensate for
clock skew. The reference client shall not lose or discard packets, shall not
trigger retransmission, and shall not use error concealment or time-warping.
The initial jitter buffer size (filling level) shall be higher than the
maximum expected network jitter and the maximum jitter buffer size shall be at
least twice the initial size. During jitter buffer reset, the de-jitter buffer
shall be emptied/filled to the initial buffer size. In case of buffer over- or
underruns, the reference client shall give a warning and it shall be reported.
NOTE 2: A static de-jitter buffer is a first-in-first-out (FIFO) buffer which
at the beginning buffers packets until a given initial buffer size is reached.
Due to changing network delays the filling level of the de-jitter buffer can
change, but the sum of network delay and jitter buffer delay is constant (as
opposed to an adaptive jitter buffer management). The filling level of the de-
jitter buffer represents the de-jitter buffer delay.
For measurements with unsynchronized clock e.g. the measurement of clock skew,
jitter buffer over- and underruns cannot be avoided due to the unsynchronized
clocks. Under the assumption of jitter-free condition the initial jitter
buffer size (filling level) shall be chosen such that the maximum clock skew
can be compensated without any loss of packets for a given time. For the
measurement of clock skews the jitter buffer size should be chosen such that
for clock skew of up to 100ppm no loss of packets due to buffer over- or
under-run shall occur for a sequence of 160s.
For LTE and NR connections, the system simulator shall be configured for FDD
operation, with a default or dedicated bearer (EPC) and QoS flow (5GC) and
reference measurement channel scheduling that provides enough resource block
allocation for transmitting a full speech packet within a transmission time
interval of 1ms. No HARQ re-transmissions shall occur. TDD operation, TTI
bundling, connected DRX and other forms of scheduling (e.g. SPS) are for
further study.
The test setup has to ensure proper clock synchronization of the test
equipment to the UE. Clock skew shall be negligible and packet loss shall not
occur during the test.
NOTE 3: Any clock skew may result in improper delay calculation or in wrong
positioning of the analysis window.

NOTE: Connection to PSTN should include electrical echo control (EEC).
Figure 1: Interfaces (MRP, ERP/DRP..., Air interface and Point of
interconnect) for specification of terminal acoustic characteristics
### 5.1.1 Setup for handset terminals
A suitable position shall be defined for each handset UE and documented in the
test report. When using a handset UE, the handset is placed on HATS as
described in ITU-T Recommendation P.64 Annex E [18].
The positioning for such handset UEs is defined in ITU-T Recommendation P.64
Annex D.5 and E.3 [18].
The criteria for determining the ECRP follows this order:
\- At the manufacturer defined position (MECRP), if provided.
> \- If not, at the centre of the earpiece as defined in Annex E of ITU-T
> P.64, if the handset features a traditional earpiece.
\- If not (handset provides a non-traditional earpiece, e.g., UE with
vibrating display designed for sound radiation, with acoustic outlet at the
top edge or non-visible outlet):
\- A graphical user interface showing the location of optimal sound radiation,
if provided.
\- If not, through an objective determination procedure of ECRP as described
in Annex H, if possible.
\- If not, after a subjective determination by the test operator of the
optimal holding position.
The position of the handset positioner fork positions and support pins shall
also be documented by means of d~z~/d~y~ coordinates according to the
definitions in ITU-T Recommendation P.64 Annex D.5 and E.3 [18].
The artificial mouth shall conform to ITU-T Recommendation P.58 [15]. The
artificial ear shall conform to ITU-T Recommendation P.57 [14]. Type 3.3 ear
shall be used and positioned on HATS according to ITU-T Recommendation P.58
[15].
**Position and calibration of HATS**
The sending and receiving characteristics shall be tested with the HATS. It
shall be indicated what application force was used. If not stated otherwise in
TS 26.131, an application force of 8 ± 2 N shall be used.
The horizontal positioning of the HATS reference plane shall be guaranteed
within ± 2º.
### 5.1.2 Setup for headset terminals
Recommendations for the setup and positioning of headsets are given in ITU-T
Recommendation P.380. If not stated otherwise, headsets shall be placed in
their recommended wearing position. Some insert earphones might not fit
properly in Type 3.3 ear simulators. For such insert type headsets, an ITU-T
Recommendation P.57 [14] Type 2 ear simulator may be used in conjunction with
the HATS mouth simulator. The HATS should be equipped with two artificial ears
as specified in ITU-T Recommendation P.57 [14]. For binaural headsets two
artificial ears are required.
### 5.1.3 Setup for hands-free terminals
#### 5.1.3.1 Vehicle-mounted hands-free
If not stated otherwise, the artificial head (HATS -- head and torso
simulator, according to ITU‑T Recommendation P.58 [15]) is positioned in the
driver\'s seat for the measurement as shown in figure 3a. The position has to
be in line with the average users' position; therefore, all positions and
sizes of users have to be taken into account. Typically, all except the
tallest 5% and the shortest 5% of the driving population have to be
considered. The size of these persons can be derived, e.g., from the
\'anthropometric data set\' for the corresponding year (e.g., based on data
used by car manufacturers). The position of the HATS (mouth/ears) within the
positioning arrangement is given individually by each car manufacturer. The
position used has to be reported in detail in the test report. If no
requirements for positioning are given the distance from the microphone to the
MRP is defined by the test lab.
By using suitable measures (e.g., marks in the car, relative position to
A-pillar, B-pillar, height from the floor, etc.) an exact reproduction of the
artificial head position must be possible at any later time.
NOTE -- Different positions of the artificial head may greatly influence the
test results. Depending on the application, different positions of the
artificial head may be chosen for the tests. It is recommended to check the
worst-case position, e.g., those positions where the SNR and/or the speech
quality in send may be worst.

#### 5.1.3.2 Desktop hands-free
For HATS test equipment, the definition of hands-free terminals and setup for
desktop hands-free terminals can be found in ITU-T Recommendation P.581.
Measurement setup using a free-field microphone and a discrete P.51 [13]
artificial mouth for desktop hands-free terminals can be found in ITU-T
Recommendation P.340.The positioning for different types of desktop hands-free
terminals is given in ETSI TS 103 738 [29] and ETSI TS 103 740 [31].
#### 5.1.3.3 Hand-held hands-free
Either HATS or a free-field microphone with a discrete P.51 [13] artificial
mouth may be used to measure a hand-held hands-free type UE.
If HATS measurement equipment is used, it shall be configured to the hand-held
hands-free UE according to figure 4. The HATS should be positioned so that the
HATS Reference Point is at a distance _d_ ~HF~ from the centre point of the
visual display of the Mobile Station. The distance _d_ ~HF~ is specified by
the manufacturer. A vertical angle θ~HF~ may be specified by the manufacturer.
Where it is not specified, the nominal distance _d_ ~HF~ shall be 42 cm and
θ~HF~ shall be 0º.
NOTE: The nominal distance of 42 cm corresponds to the distance between the
HATS reference point and lip-plane (12 cm) with an additional 30 cm giving a
realistic figure as a reference usage of hand-held terminals.

Figure 4: Configuration of hand-held hands-free UE relative to the HATS
If a free-field microphone and a discrete P.51 [13] mouth are used, they shall
be configured to the hand-held hands-free UE according to figure 5 for
receiving measurements and figure 6 for sending measurements. The microphone
should be located at a distance _d_ ~HF~ from the centre of the visual display
of the UE. The mouth simulator should be located at a distance _d_ ~HF~-12 cm
from the centre of the visual display of the UE. The distance _d_ ~HF~ is
specified by the manufacturer. Where it is not specified the nominal distance
_d_ ~HF~ shall be 42 cm.

### 5.1.4 Position and calibration of HATS
The horizontal positioning of the HATS reference plane shall be guaranteed
within ± 2° for testing hands-free equipment.
The HATS shall be equipped with a Type 3.3 Artificial Ear. For hands-free
measurements the HATS shall be equipped with two artificial ears. The pinnae
are specified in Recommendation P.57 [14] for Type 3.3 artificial ears. The
pinnae shall be positioned on HATS according to ITU-T Recommendation P.58
[15].
The exact calibration and equalization procedures as well as how to combine
the two ear signals for the purpose of measurements can be found in ITU-T
Recommendation P.581.
If not stated otherwise, the HATS shall be diffuse-field equalized using
values from ITU-T Recommendation P.58 [15]. For 1/3-octave band measurements,
the inverse of the nominal diffuse field curve in P.58 table 3 shall be used.
For 1/12-octave band measurements, the inverse of the nominal diffuse field
curve in P.58 Annex A shall be used. For measurements requiring diffuse-field
correction values for frequencies other than those used in the P.58 tables,
linear interpolation on a log frequency scale from the P.58 Annex A values
shall be used.
For hand-held hands-free UE, the setup corresponding to \'portable hands-
free\' in ITU-T Recommendation P.581 should be used.
### 5.1.5 Test setup for quality in the presence of ambient noise measurements
#### 5.1.5.1 Handset
The setup for simulating realistic ambient noises and the positioning of the
HATS in a lab-type environment is described in ETSI ES 202 396‑1 [35].
ETSI ES 202 396‑1 [35] contains a description of the recording arrangement for
realistic ambient noises, a description of the setup for a loudspeaker
arrangement suitable to simulate an ambient noise field in a lab-type
environment and a database of realistic ambient noises, part of which is used
for testing the terminal performance with a variety of conditions.
Two different methods (Method 1 and Method 2) for equalization and calibration
of the loudspeakers are allowed and specified below. The method selected for
the test setup (Method 1 or Method 2) shall be reported. Method 2 is preferred
over Method 1 due to the improved cross-lab reproduction accuracy reported in
clause 5 of TR 26.921 [52].
Method 1:
The equalization and calibration procedure for this test setup given in ETSI
ES 202 396‑1 [35] shall be used.
This method works semi-automated and requires manual adjustment steps during
the equalization procedure. The equalization is carried out in the frequency
range between 50 Hz and 10 kHz.
Method 2:
The equalization and calibration procedure for this test setup given in Clause
7 of ETSI TS 103 224 [43] shall be used. During the equalization procedure, a
so-called "reference sound" is needed for verification purposes. In this case,
the noise type "TrainStation_bin" of Clause 8 of ETSI TS 103 224 [43] (time
range 15.0 to 22.5s) shall be used.
NOTE: Clause 7 of ETSI TS 103 224 [43] describes recording and reproduction
arrangement for an (almost) arbitrary number of microphones and loudspeakers.
In order to produce ambient noise field compatible to Method 1, a flexible
setup with two recording/playback channels (binaural noise signals) and a 4.0
(or 4.1) loudspeaker configuration is used.
In contrast to the Method 1 according to ETSI ES 202 396‑1 [35], a fully
automated equalization procedure including reduction of cross-talk is provided
by Method 2. The equalization is carried out in the frequency range between 50
Hz and 20 kHz.
#### 5.1.5.2 Hand-held hands-free
For hand-held hands-free UE, the test setup for simulating realistic ambient
noises and the position of the HATS in a lab-type environment is described in
ETSI TS 103 224 [43]. The setup in ETSI ES 202 396‑1 [35] may also be used as
described below.
ETSI TS 103 224 [43] contains a description of the recording arrangement for
realistic ambient noises, a description of the setup for loudspeaker
arrangement suitable to simulate an ambient noise field in a lab type
environment, and a database of realistic ambient noises, part of which is used
for testing the hands-free UE performance. Note that TS 103 224 [43] provides
improved reproduction accuracy in terms of frequency and spatial
characteristics, and so is recommended for testing hands-free UE. The
equalization setup and the test setup is shown in Figs. 15a1 -- 15a5.

Figure 15a3: Detailed positioning of the hands-free UE
The setup in ETSI ES 202 396‑1 [35] may be used for testing hands-free UE,
provided that after the equalization and calibration procedure for handset UE
are completed, the HATS is removed from the calibration location in the test
room, and the hands-free UE under test is placed at the calibration location.
The HATS is then placed in a location with respect to the hands-free UE under
test, as described in Clause 5.1.3.2 and 5.1.3.3. The equalization setup and
the test setup is shown in Figs. 15a4 and 15a5. Each ambient noise in the
database of ETSI TS 103 224 [43] is available in a version compatible with
reproduction using ETSI ES 202 396‑1 [35].

### 5.1.6 Test setup for electrical interfaces
#### 5.1.6.1 Wired analogue connection
UE testing via analogue connection shall be carried out with a universal wired
headset interface, which complies with the electrical and physical
characteristics described in clause 6 of ITU‑T P.381 [53]. In case the UE is
not equipped with this type of socket, but an associated adapter/converter is
provided, testing shall be conducted with this additional equipment instead.
In case also no associated adapter/converter is provided, but an USB‑C port
supporting the _Audio Adapter Accessory Mode_ according to Annex A of [56] is
available, testing shall be conducted with a generic analogue adapter (Annex A
of [56]). Other implementations of analogue electrical interfaces (wired or
wireless) are out of scope.
Figure 15a5b illustrates the setup required for testing analogue electrical
interfaces. The electric output impedance of the reference interface of the
test equipment shall be in the range of 1 Ω and 10 kΩ. The corresponding
electric input impedance shall be 32 Ω +/- 2 Ω. The common ground impedance
(between sending and receiving sides) for the test system shall be ≤ 0.05 Ω.
If not specified otherwise, the nominal signal levels are:
\- -60 dBV in send direction (input to electrical interface UE), which
corresponds to an acoustic level of -4.7 dBPa at the MRP, i.e., a default
sensitivity of \~55 dBV/Pa.
\- -39 dBV in receive direction (for an electrical interface UE providing
stereo/diotic output), for a nominal volume setting (if present).
For the receive direction, it is expected that the output signals of the
electrical interface UE are identical or at least very close. If not specified
otherwise, all measurements in receive shall be conducted with just one of the
two channels. For such measurements, the used channel shall be reported.
For testing echo and double talk scenarios, an artificial feedback of the
receive signal into the sending path shall be used. This echo path shall be
realized in a digital way, e.g., part of the test system. Analogue
realizations, e.g., a stand-alone device, are for further study.
To apply a certain echo loss (in dB), it is typically assumed that the nominal
level for send and receive path are identical. For analogue electrical
interface, the difference in nominal levels of -21 dB shall be considered in
test setups.
For measurements without artificial echo loss, the feedback path is disabled.
NOTE: It is assumed that mainly passive third-party devices are connected via
analogue electrical interface to the UE, which do not contain any typical
signal processing capabilities (like e.g., echo cancellation or noise
reduction). Thus, all tests specified for this interface are comparable to
handset UE or headset UE, i.e. they expect that any possible signal processing
is applied in the UE.
{width="5.9006944444444445in" height="4.6125in"}
Figure 15a5b: Test setup for analogue electrical headset interface
#### 5.1.6.2 Digital connection
Figure 15a5c illustrates the setup required for testing digital electrical
interfaces of a UE. Such testing is possible with different types of wired and
wireless technologies and requires a digital reference interface in the test
system. The present document is only applicable to USB and Bluetooth
interfaces, other digital interfaces are out of scope.
For some combinations of digital electrical interface and codec type, the
overall audio bandwidth may be lower as specified in clause 5.4. In such
cases, the electrical interface UE shall be tested according to the overall
audio bandwidth.
EXAMPLE: Electrical interface UE is connected via Bluetooth transmission in
wideband mode to the test equipment. The telephony part of the UE operates
with EVS codec in super-wideband mode. Tests for this combination are
conducted according to clause 8 (wideband mode) instead of clause 9 (super-
wideband mode).
For testing echo and double talk scenarios, an artificial feedback of the
receive signal into the sending path shall be used. This echo path shall be
realized as part of the test system. The received and decoded signal from the
UE is fed back into the sending direction, in advance to the
encoding/protocol/hardware layer. For measurements without artificial echo
loss, the feedback path is disabled.
Digital levels for send and receive direction are specified in dBm0, referring
to the same definition as for the input/output of the terminal and the system
simulator (see clause 5.2).
In contrast to the analogue interface, devices connected to the UE via digital
interface may either provide active (includes signal processing for send
and/or receive direction) or passive (comparable to analogue headsets, see
clause 5.1.6.1) functionalities. Tests are only applicable in case of typical
signal processing for telecommunication (e.g., noise reduction, echo
cancellation) takes places only in the UE and not in the equipment to be
connected. If necessary and if the digital interface and the associated
protocols support the exchange of commands/meta-information, the electrical
interface UE shall be configured in such away that carries out its own signal
processing. Performance tests according to clauses 7-10 are not applicable in
case the signal processing in the UE cannot be enabled in any way for the
electrical interface.
In some cases, a digital headset with higher computing capabilities may
provide and signal its own signal processing when connecting to the electrical
interface UE. It is expected that the UE will take the headset\'s capabilities
into account to avoid possible tandem signal processing. For this purpose, a
minimum set of transparency tests are described in Annex G and shall be
conducted in advance to the actual testing. The results of the transparency
tests shall be reported.
A full set of appropriate transparency tests can be found in Recommendation
ITU-T P.383 [55], but further testing beyond Annex G is out of scope for the
present document.
{width="6.541666666666667in" height="4.5625in"}
Figure 15a5c: Test setup for digital electrical headset interface
The digital reference interface shall comply with the accuracy requirements
for test equipment described in clause 5.3.
It is expected that the volume control at the digital electrical interface UE
does not have a direct effect on the signal in receive direction. In most
cases, the volume setting at the connected equipment with acoustical interface
(e.g., a digital headset) is remote-controlled instead.
In consequence, the digital reference interface shall not attenuate or amplify
the digitally transmitted signal at the electrical interface in case the
volume control at the UE is changed. On the other hand, test methods are only
applicable for a single volume setting. Tests shall be conducted with volume
control set to maximum at the UE.
NOTE: For sake of simplicity and clarity, this single volume setting is
regarded as \"nominal volume\" in the test descriptions of the following
clauses.
Since it is expected that the signal level at the electrical interface UE is
independent of the type of equipment connected (e.g., monaural, or binaural
headset), test methods related to binaural listening generally do not apply.
## 5.2 Setup of the electrical interfaces of test equipment
### 5.2.1 Codec approach and specification
In this approach, a codec is used to convert the digital input/output bit-
stream of the system simulator to the equivalent analogue values. With this
approach a system simulator simulating the radio link to the terminal under
controlled and error-free conditions is required, unless otherwise specified
for the respective test. The system simulator has to be equipped with a high-
quality codec with characteristics as close as possible to ideal.
Definition of 0 dBr point:
D/A converter - a Digital Test Sequence (DTS) representing the codec
equivalent of an analogue sinusoidal signal with an RMS value of 3,14 dB below
the maximum full‑load capacity of the codec shall generate 0 dBm across a 600
ohm load;
A/D converter - a 0 dBm signal generated from a 600 ohm source shall give the
digital test sequence (DTS) representing the codec equivalent of an analogue
sinusoidal signal with an RMS value of 3,14 dB below the maximum full‑load
capacity of the codec.
**Narrowband telephony testing**

the system simulator shall use the EVS speech codec as defined in 3GPP TS 26
series of specifications at 32 kHz sampling rate, mono, at the source coding
bit-rate of 24,4 kbit/s unless specified otherwise for the respective test
case. The system simulator should support all operation modes of EVS speech
codec, the complete EVS RTP payload format, and all SDP attributes as
specified in TS 26.445 Annex A; it should be possible to control all the SDP
attributes declared and negotiated by the system simulator.
**Fullband telephony testing**
For testing of a LTE, NR or WLAN terminal supporting fullband telephony, the
system simulator shall use the EVS speech codec as defined in 3GPP TS 26
series of specifications at 48 kHz sampling rate, mono, at the source coding
bit-rate of 24,4 kbit/s.
### 5.2.2 Direct digital processing approach
In this approach, the digital input/output bit-stream of the terminal
connected through the radio link to the system simulator is operated upon
directly.
**Narrowband telephony testing**
For testing of a GSM, 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN terminal supporting narrowband
telephony, the system simulator shall use the AMR speech codec as defined in
the 3GPP TS 26 series of specifications, at the source coding bit-rate of 12,2
kbit/s.
**Wideband telephony testing**
For testing of a GSM, 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN terminal supporting wideband
telephony, the system simulator shall use the AMR-WB speech codec as defined
in the 3GPP TS 26 series of specifications, at the source coding bit rate of
12,65 kbit/s.
**Super-wideband telephony testing**
For testing of a LTE, NR or WLAN terminal supporting super-wideband telephony,
the system simulator shall use the EVS speech codec as defined in 3GPP TS 26
series of specifications in super-wideband mode, at 32 kHz sampling rate,
mono, at the source coding bit-rate of 24,4 kbit/s. The system simulator
should support all operation modes of EVS speech codec, the complete EVS RTP
payload format, and all SDP attributes as specified in TS 26.445 Annex A; it
should be possible to control all the SDP attributes declared and negotiated
by the system simulator.
**Fullband telephony testing**
For testing of a LTE, NR or WLAN terminal supporting fullband telephony, the
system simulator shall use the EVS speech codec as defined in 3GPP TS 26
series of specifications in fullband mode, at 48 kHz sampling rate, mono, at
the source coding bit-rate of 24,4 kbit/s.
## 5.3 Accuracy of test equipment
Unless specified otherwise, the accuracy of measurements made by test
equipment shall not exceed the requirements defined in table 1a.

table 1 of ITU‑T Recommendation P.79 [16], bands 4 to 17. For the calculation,
the averaged measured level at the electrical reference point for each
frequency band is referred to the averaged test signal level measured in each
frequency band at the MRP.

Recommendation P.79 [16], table 1.

English single talk sequence described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22]. The
test signal level shall be -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or

complete test signal sequence.
b) The handset terminal is setup as described in clause 5. The receiving
sensitivity shall be calculated from each band of the 14 frequencies given in

d) DRP-ERP correction is used. No leakage correction shall be applied.
#### 7.2.2.3 Receiving loudness rating (RLR) in the presence of background
noise
This test shall be performed with the volume control at the maximum setting.
a) The downlink test signal to be used for the measurements shall be composed
from the British-English material of clause 7.3 in ITU-T Recommendation P.501
[22]. The signal is a concatenation of the following parts (see also Figure
15a6):
1) The complete female short conditioning sequence (which includes a leading 5
s silence which is here used for conditioning the UE under noise-only
conditions). The level shall be -16 dBm0 active speech level (ITU-T P.56)
measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent analogue point.
2) Pause 1 sec.
3) The first 5 s of the male short conditioning sequence. The level shall be
-16 dBm0 active speech level (ITU-T P.56) measured at the digital reference
point or the equivalent analogue point.
4) The complete single-talk sequence. The test signal level shall be -16 dBm0
measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent analogue point. The
test signal level is calculated over the complete single-talk test sequence.
b) The background noise playback shall be set up and calibrated according to
handset related descriptions in ETSI TS 103 224 or ES 202 396-1. The \"Pub
Noise (Pub)\" recording is used. This scenario is available for both playback
systems and is described in sub-clause 8.2 of TS 103 224 (8-channel recording)
and sub-clause 8.2 of ES 202 396-1 (binaural recording). The type of
background noise reproduction used for the test shall be reported.
c) The handset terminal is setup as described in clause 5 and the relevant
noise playback specification, TS 103 224 or ES 202 396-1. Set the volume
control to maximum.
d) The start of the recording of the artificial ear signal and the start of
the background noise playback shall be synchronized to ensure consistent
timing of repeated recordings, and allow background noise cancellation by
subtraction in the time domain as described below. The noise playback shall be
looped with a 20 ms crossfade at the loop point.
e) The background noise and downlink speech stimulus are applied and a
recording of the artificial ear DRP signal is performed. The sound file is
saved (file1). The playback is stopped.
f) The recording described in e) is repeated, this time with muted downlink
signal. The soundfile is saved (file2).
g) A subtraction of the samples is performed (file1-file2). The resulting time
signal contains the output of the UE to the artificial ear, where the
background noise has been essentially eliminated. For further analysis, the
duration of the conditioning sequence and the receive delay from POI to DRP is
discarded, resulting in a time signal containing only the single-talk
sequence.
h) The RLR is calculated according to sub-clause 7.2.2.2.

### 7.2.3 Connections with desktop and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE
Vehicle-mounted hands-free UE should be tested within the vehicle (for totally
integrated vehicle hands-free systems) or in a vehicle simulator, as described
in 3GPP TS 03.58 [11].
Free-field measurements for vehicle-mounted hands-free are for further study.

sensitivity shall be calculated from each band of the 14 frequencies given in
table 1 of ITU‑T Recommendation P.79 [16], bands 4 to 17. For the calculation,
the averaged measured level at the electrical reference point for each
frequency band is referred to the averaged test signal level measured in each
frequency band at the MRP.
c) The sensitivity is expressed in terms of dBV/Pa and the SLR shall be

Recommendation P.79 [16], table 1.
#### 7.2.3.2 Receiving Loudness Rating (RLR)

English single talk sequence described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22]. The
test signal level shall be -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or
the equivalent analogue point. The test signal level is calculated over the
complete test signal sequence.
b) The hands-free terminal is setup as described in clause 5. If a HATS is
used, then it is free-field equalized as described in ITU-T Recommendation
P.581. The equalized output signal of each artificial ear is power-averaged
over the total duration of the analysis; the right and left artificial ear
signals are voltage-summed for each 1/3-octave frequency band; these
1/3-octave band data are considered as the input signal to be used for
calculations or measurements. The receiving sensitivity shall be calculated
from each band of the 14 frequencies given in table 1 of ITU‑T Recommendation
P.79 [16], bands 4 to 17.
> For the calculation, the averaged measured level at each frequency band is

1 of ITU‑T Recommendation P.79 [16].
d) No leakage correction shall be applied. The hands-free correction, as
described in ITU‑T Recommendation P.340 shall be applied. To compute the
receiving loudness rating (RLR) for a hands-free terminal (see also ITU-T
Recommendation P.340), when using the combination of left and right artificial
ear signals from the HATS, the HFL~E~ has to be 8 dB instead of 14 dB. For
further information see ITU-T Recommendation P.581.

signals are voltage-summed for each 1/3-octave frequency band; these
1/3-octave band data are considered as the input signal to be used for

## 7.3 Idle channel noise (handset, headset and electrical interface UE)
7.3.0 Overview
For idle noise measurements in sending and receiving directions, care should
be taken that only the noise is windowed out by the analysis and the result is
not impaired by any remaining reverberation or by noise and/or interference
from various other sources. Some examples are air-conducted or vibration-
conducted noise from sources inside or outside the test chamber, disturbances
from lights and regulators, mains supply induced noise including grounding
issues, test system and system simulator inherent noise as well as radio
interference from the UE to test equipment such as ear simulators, microphone
amplifiers, etc.
The following steps shall be followed in advance to both measurement
directions:
a) The test environment shall comply with the conditions described in
subclause 6.1.
b) The terminal should be configured to the test equipment as described in
subclause 5.1.
c) A test signal may have to be intermittently applied to prevent 'silent
mode' operation of the MS. This is for further study.
d) An optional activation sequence may be used, to e.g., override a voice
activity detection. In this case, the additional test signal shall be suitable
regarding level and bandwidth, like e.g., the composite source signals
described in clause 7.10.
To improve repeatability, the test sequence (optional activation followed by
the noise level measurement) may be contiguously repeated one or more times.
### 7.3.1 Sending (handset and headset UE)

be followed.
a) In advance to the noise level measurement, an optional activation sequence

b) The noise level at the output of the SS is measured with psophometric
weighting. The psophometric weighting filter is described in ITU-T
Recommendation O.41.
c) The measured part of the noise shall be 170,667 ms (which equals 8192
samples in a 48 kHz sample rate test system). The spectral distribution of the
noise is analyzed with an 8k FFT using windowing with ≤ 0,1 dB leakage for non
bin-centered signals. This can be achieved with a window function commonly
known as a \"flat top window\". Within the specified frequency range, the FFT
bin that has the highest level is searched for; the level of this bin is the
maximum level of a single frequency disturbance.
d) The total noise powers obtained from such repeats shall be averaged. The
total result shall be 10 * log~10~ of this average in dB.
e) The single frequency maximum powers obtained from such repeats shall be
averaged. The total result shall be 10*log~10~ of this average in dB.
### 7.3.2 Receiving (handset and headset UE)

field correction. The A-weighting filter is described in IEC 61672 [38].
c) The measured part of the noise shall be 170,667 ms (which equals 8192
samples in a 48 kHz sample rate test system). The spectral distribution of the
noise is analyzed with an 8k FFT using windowing with ≤ 0.1 dB leakage for non
bin-centred signals. This can be achieved with a window function commonly
known as a \"flat top window\". Within the specified frequency range, the FFT
bin that has the highest level is searched for; the level of this bin is the
maximum level of a single frequency disturbance.
d) The total noise powers obtained from such repeats shall be averaged. The
total result shall be 10*log~10~ of this average in dB.
e) The single frequency maximum powers obtained from such repeats shall be
averaged. The total result shall be 10*log~10~ of this average in dB.

spectrum of the acoustic signal produced by the artificial mouth is calibrated
under free-field conditions at the MRP. The test signal level shall be -4,7

a) The handset UE is setup as described in clause 5. The application force
shall be 13 N on the Type 3.3 artificial ear.
b) Where a user operated volume control is provided, the measurements shall be
carried out at the nominal setting of the volume control. In addition the
measurement is repeated at the maximum volume control setting. It is expected
that for other positions of the volume control setting a consistent behaviour
to that of the nominal and maximum settings should be observed. Additional
measurements for these positions are not required.
c) Measurements shall be made at 1/12-octave intervals as given by the R.40

inclusive. The averaged measured level at DRP in each frequency band is

ERP correction is used.

the electrical sidetone path disabled and both sets of results shall be
reported. In case the STMR is below the limit also with the electrical
sidetone path disabled, the result shall not be regarded as a failure.
Disconnecting the call is normally disabling the electrical sidetone path;
otherwise the UE can be switched off to enter the wanted state.
### 7.5.2 Headset UE
a) The test signal to be used for the measurements shall be the British-
English single talk sequence described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22]. The
spectrum of the acoustic signal produced by the artificial mouth is calibrated
under free-field conditions at the MRP. The test signal level shall be -4,7
dBPa measured at the MRP. The test signal level is calculated over the

Recommendation P.79 [16], using m = 0.225 and the weighting factors in table

### 7.5.3 Hands-free UE (all categories)
No requirement other than echo control.
### 7.5.3a Electrical interface UE

and to -16 dBm0 for digital connections. The test signal level is calculated

carried out at the nominal setting of the volume control. In addition, the
measurement is repeated at the maximum volume control setting. It is expected
that for other positions of the volume control setting a consistent behaviour
to that of the nominal and maximum settings should be observed. Additional
measurements for these positions are not required.
d) Measurements shall be made at 1/12-octave intervals as given by the R.40
series of preferred numbers in ISO 3 [54] for frequencies from 100 Hz to 8 kHz
inclusive. The averaged measured level at the electrical receiving reference
interface in each frequency band is referred to the averaged reference signal
level measured in each frequency band.
e) The measured sidetone sensitivity is corrected by a default sensitivity of
22.9 dBPa/V for analogue and 2.1 dBPa/V for digital connections (corresponding
both to a binaural narrowband RLR of 8 dB). This correction transfers the
measured electrical sensitivity via an ideal headset (assuming a flat transfer
function regarding ERP) to the acoustical domain.
NOTE: The difference in dB between nominal receiving levels of analogue (-39
dBV) and digital (-16 dBm0 = ‑18.2 dBV) connection equals 20.8 dB. This offset
is taken into account for the default sensitivity of the analogue connection
(22.9 dBPa/V - 20.8 dB = 2.1 dBPa/V).
f) The sidetone path loss and the STMR (in dB) shall be calculated from
formula 5-1 of ITU-T P.79 [16], using m=0.225 and the weighting factors in
Table 3 of ITU-T P.79 [16]. Leakage correction shall not be applied.
### 7.5.4 Sidetone delay for handset, headset or electrical interface UE
a) The handset or headset terminal is setup as described in clause 5.
b) The test signal is a CS-signal complying with ITU-T Recommendation P.501
using a PN-sequence with a length, T, of 4 096 points (for a 48 kHz sample
rate test system). The duration of the complete test signal is as specified in
ITU-T Recommendation P.501. The level of the signal shall be ‑4,7 dBPa at the
MRP for handset or headset UE. For electrical interface UE, the level of the
signal shall be -60 dBV for analogue and to -16 dBm0 for digital connections.
.
c) The cross-correlation function Φxy(τ) between the input signal Sx(t)
generated by the test system in send direction and the output signal Sy(t)
measured at the artificial ear (for handset/headset UE) or at the electrical
reference interface (for electrical interface UE) is calculated in the time
domain:
$\Phi_{\text{xy}}(\tau) = \frac{1}{T}\int_{t = \frac{-
T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}}S_{x}(t) \cdot S_{y}(t + \tau)$
d) The measurement window, _T_ , shall be identical to the test signal period,
T, with the measurement window synchronized to the PN-sequence of the test
signal.
e) The sidetone delay is calculated from the envelope E(τ) of the cross-
correlation function Φxy(τ).The envelope E(τ) is calculated by the Hilbert
transformation H {xy(τ)} of the cross-correlation:
$H\left{ \text{xy}(\tau) \right} = \sum_{u = - \infty}^{+
\infty}\frac{\Phi_{\text{xy}}(u)}{\pi(\tau - u)}$
$E(\tau) = \sqrt{\left\lbrack \Phi_{\text{xy}}(\tau) \right\rbrack^{2} +
\left\lbrack H\left{ \text{xy}(\tau) \right} \right\rbrack^{2}}$
f) For handset/headset UE:\ The first maximum of the envelope function occurs
in correspondence with the direct sound produced by the artificial mouth; the
second one occurs with a possible delayed sidetone signal. The difference
between the two maxima corresponds to the sidetone delay.\ \ For electrical
interface UE:\ Since there is no direct sound produced by the artifical mouth
and captured by the artifical ear, the maximum of the envelope function
directly corresponds to the sidetone delay. The send and receive delays of the
analogue electrical reference interface shall be subtracted from the
determined sidetone delay.
NOTE: It is assumed that the measured sidetone delay is less than T/2.
## 7.6 Stability loss
Where a user-controlled volume control is provided it is set to maximum.
**Handset UE:** The handset is placed on a hard plane surface with the
earpiece facing the surface.
**Headset UE:** The requirement applies for the closest possible position
between microphone and headset receiver within the intended wearing position.
NOTE: Depending on the type of headset it may be necessary to repeat the
measurement in different positions.
**Hands-free UE (all categories):** No requirement other than echo loss.
Before the actual test a training sequence consisting of the British-English
single talk sequence described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] is applied.
The training sequence level shall be -16 dBm0 in order to not overload the
codec.
The test signal is a PN-sequence complying with ITU-T Recommendation P.501
with a length of 4 096 points (for a 48 kHz sampling rate system) and a crest
factor of 6 dB instead of 11 dB. The PN-sequence is generated as described in
P.501 with W(k) constant within the frequency range 200-4000 Hz and zero
outside this range. The duration of the test signal is 250 ms. With an input
signal of ‑3 dBm0, the attenuation from input to output of the system
simulator shall be measured under the following conditions:
a) The handset or the headset, with the transmission circuit fully active,
shall be positioned on a hard plane surface with at least 400 mm free space in
all directions; the earpiece shall face towards the surface as shown in figure
15c;
b) The headset microphone is positioned as close as possible to the
receiver(s) within the intended wearing position;
c) For a binaural headset, the receivers are placed symmetrically around the
microphone.

NOTE: All dimensions in mm.
Figure 15c. Test configuration for stability loss measurement on handset or
headset UE
The attenuation from input to output of the system simulator shall be measured
in the frequency range from 200 Hz to 4 kHz. The spectral distribution of the
output signal is analysed with a 4k FFT (for a 48 kHz sample rate test
system), thus the measured part of the output signal is 85.333 ms. To avoid
leakage effects, the frequency resolution of the FFT must be the same as the
frequency spacing of the PN-sequence.
## 7.7 Acoustic echo control
### 7.7.1 General
The echo loss (EL) presented by the GSM, 3G, LTE or NR networks at the POI
should be at least 46 dB during single talk. This value takes into account the
fact that UE is likely to be used in a wide range of noise environments.
The calculation of weighted terminal coupling loss (TCLw) is based on the
attenuation from reference point input to reference point output versus
frequency bands. The following common measurement steps are applicable for all
types of UE described below:
a) The attenuation from reference point input to reference point output shall
be measured using the compressed real speech signal described in clause 7.3.3
of ITU-T P.501 [33]. The test signal level shall be ‑10 dBm0.
b) The first 17,0 s of the test signal (6 sentences) are discarded from the
analysis to allow for convergence of the acoustic echo canceller. The analysis
is performed over the remaining length of the test sequence (last 6
sentences).
c) The analysis shall be conducted in 1/3-octave band intervals between 300 to
3400 Hz as given by the R.10 series of preferred numbers in ISO 3 [54]. For
the calculation, the averaged measured echo level at each frequency band is
referred to the averaged test signal level measured in each frequency band.
d) The TCLw is calculated according to ITU-T Recommendation G.122 [8], annex
B, clause B.4 (trapezoidal rule).
### 7.7.2 Acoustic echo control in a hands-free UE
The hands-free UE is setup in a room with acoustic properties similar to a
typical \"office-type\" room; a vehicle-mounted hands-free UE should be tested
in a vehicle or vehicle simulator, as specified by the UE manufacturer (see
also 3GPP TS 03.58 [11]). The ambient noise level ≤ 70 dBPa(A).
The TCLw is measured and calculated according to clause 7.7.1.
### 7.7.3 Acoustic echo control in handset UE
The handset UE is set up according to clause 5. The ambient noise level shall
be ≤ ‑64 dBPa(A).
The TCLw is measured and calculated according to clause 7.7.1.
### 7.7.4 Acoustic echo control in a headset UE
The headset UE is set up according to clause 5. The ambient noise level shall
be ≤ ‑64 dBPa(A The TCLw is calculated according to clause 7.7.1The TCLw is
calculated according to clause 7.7.1.
### 7.7.5 Acoustic echo control in a electrical interface UE
The electrical interface UE is setup according to clause 5.1.6. In order to
simulate an acoustic echo, the electrical reference interface shall introduce
an echo loss of 30 dB.
The TCLw is measured and calculated according to clause 7.7.1.
## 7.8 Distortion
### 7.8.1 Sending distortion
The handset, headset, or hands-free UE is setup as described in clause 5. The
electrical interface UE is setup as described in clause 5.1.6.
The test signal used is a sine‑wave signal with a frequency of 1020 Hz. The
sine-wave signal level shall be calibrated to the following RMS levels
\- For handset, headset, or hands-free UE: 5, 0, ‑4.7, ‑10, ‑15 and ‑20 dBPa
at the MRP.
\- For electrical interface UE with analogue connection: -50, -55, -60, -65,
-70 and -75 dBV at the output of the electrical reference interface.
\- For electrical interface UE with digital connection: -6, -11, -16, -21, -26
and -31 dBm0 at the output of the electrical reference interface.The duration
of the sine-wave signal is recommended to be 360 ms. The manufacturer shall be
allowed to request tone lengths up to 1 s. The measured part of the signal for
analysis are integer multiple of 85.333 ms and shall be at least 170.667 ms
(which equals 2 * 4096 samples in a 48 kHz sample rate test system). The times
are selected to be relatively short in order to reduce the risk that the test
tone is treated as a stationary signal.
It is recommended that an optional activation signal be presented immediately
preceding each test signal to ensure that the UE is in a typical state during
measurement. An appropriate speech or speech-like activation signal shall be
chosen from ITU-T Recommendations P.501 [22] or P.50 [10]. A recommendation
for the use of an activation signal as part of the measurement is defined in
figure 16. The RMS level of the active parts of this activation signal is
recommended to be equal to the subsequent test tone RMS level. In practice,
certain types of processing may be impacted due to the introduction of the
activation signal. The manufacturer shall be allowed to specify disabling of
the activation signal. It shall be reported whether an activation signal was
used or not, along with the characteristics of the activation signal, as
specified by the manufacturer.
The ratio of the signal to total distortion power of the signal output of the
SS shall be measured with the psophometric noise weighting (see ITU‑T
Recommendations G.712 [21], O.41 [23] and O.132 [27]). The psophometric filter
shall be normalized (0 dB gain) at 800 Hz as specified in ITU-T Recommendation
O.41 [23]. The weighting function shall be applied to the total distortion
component only (not to the signal component).
For measurement of the total distortion component an octave-wide band-stop
filter shall be applied to the signal to suppress the sine-wave signal and
associated coding artefacts. The filter shall have a lower passband ending at
0.7071 * f~S~, and an upper passband starting at 1,4142 * f~S~, where f~S~ is
the frequency of the sine-wave signal. The passband ripple of the filter shall
be ≤ 0.2 dB. The attenuation of the band-stop filter at the sine-wave
frequency shall be ≥ 60 dB. Alternatively, the described characteristics can
be implemented by an appropriate weighting on the spectrum obtained from an
FFT (transformation length 4096, 75% overlap, Hann window). The total
distortion component is defined as the measured signal within the frequency
range 200 Hz to 4 kHz, after applying psophometric and stop filters (hence no
correction for the lost power due to the stop filter, known as \"bandwidth
correction\", shall be applied).
To improve repeatability, considering the variability introduced by speech
coding and voice processing, the test sequence (activation signal followed by
the test signal) may be contiguously repeated one or more times. The single
signal-to-total-distortion power ratios obtained from such repeats shall be
averaged. The total result shall be 10 * log~10~ of this average in dB.

The activation signal consists of a \"Bandlimited composite source signal with
speech-like power density spectrum\" signal according to ITU-T Recommendation
P.501 [22] with 48,62 ms voiced part (1), 200 ms unvoiced part (2) and 101,38
ms pause (3), followed by the same signal but polarity inverted (4, 5, 6),
followed by the voiced part only (7). The pure test tone is applied and after
50 ms settling time (8), the analysis is made over the following 170,667 ms
(9).
NOTE 1: Void.
NOTE 2: In order to ensure that the correct part of the signal is analyzed,
the total delay of the terminal and SS may have to be determined prior to the
measurement.
NOTE 3: For hands-free terminals tested in environments defined in subclause
6.1.2, care should be taken that the reverberation in the test room, caused by
the activation signal, does not affect the test results to an unacceptable
degree, referring to subclause 5.3.
### 7.8.2 Receiving distortion
The handset, headset, or hands-free UE is setup as described in clause 5. The
electrical interface UE is setup as described in clause 5.1.6.
The test signal used is a sine‑wave signal with frequencies 315, 408, 510, 816
and 1020 Hzspecified in clause 5.8 of 3GPP TS 26.131. The signal level shall
be ‑16 dBm0, except for the sine‑wave signal with a frequency 1020 Hz that
shall be applied at the signal input of the SS at the following levels: 0, ‑3,
‑10, ‑16, ‑20, ‑30, ‑40, ‑45 dBm0. The test signals have to be applied in this
sequence, i.e., from high levels down to low levels.
The duration of the sine-wave signal is recommended to be 360 ms. The
manufacturer shall be allowed to request tone lengths up to 1 s. The measured
part of the signal shall be 170.667 ms (which equals 2 * 4096 samples in a 48
kHz sample rate test system). The times are selected to be relatively short in
order to reduce the risk that the test tone is treated as a stationary signal.
It is recommended that an optional activation signal be presented immediately
preceding each test signal to ensure that the UE is in a typical state during
measurement. An appropriate speech or speech-like activation signal shall be
chosen from ITU-T Recommendations P.501 [22] or P.50 [10]. A recommendation
for the use of an activation signal as part of the measurement is defined in
figure 17. The RMS level of the active parts of this activation signal is
recommended to be equal to the subsequent test tone RMS level for low and
medium test levels. To avoid saturation of the SS speech encoder, it is
recommended for high test levels that the activation signal level be adjusted
such that its peak level equals the peak level of the test tone. In practice,
certain types of processing may be impacted due to the introduction of the
activation signal. The manufacturer shall be allowed to specify disabling of
the activation signal. It shall be reported whether an activation signal was
used or not, along with the characteristics of the activation signal, as
specified by the manufacturer.
The ratio of the signal to total distortion power shall be measured at
\- the applicable acoustic measurement point (DRP with diffuse-field
correction for handset and headset modes; free field for hands-free modes) in
case of handset, headset, or hands-free UE.
\- the applicable electric measurement point (input to the electrical
reference interface) in case of electrical interface UE.
Psophometric noise weighting (see ITU‑T Recommendations G.712 [21], O.41 [23]
and O.132 [27]) shall be applied to the measured signal.). The psophometric
filter shallbe normalized to have 0 dB gain at 800 Hz as specified in ITU-T
Recommendation O.41 [23]. The weighting function shall be applied to the total
distortion component only (not to the signal component).
For measurement of the total distortion component an octave-wide band-stop
filter shall be applied to the signal to suppress the sine-wave signal and
associated coding artefacts. The filter shall have a lower passband ending at
0,7071 * f~S~, and an upper passband starting at 1,4142 * f~S~, where f~S~ is
the frequency of the sine-wave signal. The passband ripple of the filter shall
be ≤ 0.2 dB. The attenuation of the band-stop filter at the sine-wave
frequency shall be ≥ 60 dB. Alternatively, the described characteristics can
be implemented by an appropriate weighting on the spectrum obtained from an
FFT (transformation length 4096, 75% overlap, Hann window). The total
distortion component is defined as the measured signal within the frequency

coding and voice processing, the test sequence (activation signal followed by

## 7.9 Void
## 7.10 Delay
### 7.10.0 UE Delay Measurement Methodologies
For UMTS circuit-switched operation and MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN
access in error and jitter free conditions, the sum of the UE delays in the
sending and receiving directions (T~S~+T~R~) shall be measured according to
the methods described in clauses 7.10.1 and 7.10.2. In the event that the
delays of the test equipment in send and/or receive directions are not stable
between calls or cannot be accurately determined, the alternative method
described in clause 7.10.3 may be used to obtain (T~S~+T~R~) and the measured
instability or inaccuracy observed when the methods described in 7.10.1 and
7.10.2 were performed shall be recorded in the test report. The test method(s)
used and all results obtained shall also be recorded in the test report.
For MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access in conditions with simulated
packet arrival time variations, the sum of the UE delays in the sending and
receiving directions (T~S~+T~R-jitter~) and the objective speech quality in
the receive direction shall be measured according to the method described in
clause 7.10.4.
For MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, prior to the actual
measurements, the clock skew between UE and reference client shall be
compensated by adjusting the clock of the reference client to match the clock
of the UE (as stated in clause 5). The inaccuracy of the clock skew adjustment
shall be less than 1ppm measured according to the procedure in Annex D.
It shall be ensured that the packet generation by the reference client and the
packet treatment of the test equipment are free of jitter.
### 7.10.1 Delay in sending direction (Handset UE)
The handset terminal is setup as described in clause 5.1.1.
The UE delay in the sending direction is obtained by measuring the delay
between MRP and the electrical access point of the test equipment and
subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment from the measured
value.
{width="6.333333333333333in" height="2.2395833333333335in"}
Figure 17b1: Different entities when measuring the delay in sending direction
The delay measured from MRP to the electrical access point of the test
equipment is T~S~ + T~TES~.
T~TES~: The delay between the last bit of a speech frame at the system
simulator antenna and the first electrical event at the electrical access
point of the test equipment.
1\. For the measurements, a Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T
Recommendation P.501 [22] is used. The pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the
CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use
a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal
level is -4,7 dBPa at the MRP.
2 The reference signal is the original signal (test signal). The setup of the
handset/headset terminal is made corresponding to clause 5.1.
3\. The delay is determined by cross-correlation analysis between the measured
signal at the electrical access point and the original signal. The measurement
is corrected by subtracting the test equipment delay T~TES~.
4\. The delay is measured in ms and the maximum of the cross-correlation
envelope is used for the determination.
For MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, a variability of up to 20ms
may be expected between different calls due to the synchronization between the
speech frame processing in the sending UE and the bits of the speech frames at
the UE antenna. This synchronization is attributed to the UE sending delay
according to the definition of the UE delay reference points. Hence, the
maximum value of the UE sending delay obtained from at least 5 individual
calls shall be reported as the UE delay in the sending direction. All values
shall be reported in the test report.
A further variability of up to 20ms may be expected between different calls
due to the synchronization between the speech frames at the UE antenna and the
speech frame processing in the receiving reference client of the test system.
In an end-to-end call this synchronization of the frames will only take place
at the receiver, and this variability of the measurement shall be deduced from
the UE sending delay. Hence, if the reference client of the test equipment
does not adjust for the effect of the speech frame synchronization (as
specified by the manufacturer of the reference client), this maximum
uncertainty shall be subtracted from measured maximum value reported as the UE
sending delay in order to compensate for the uncertainty of the test
equipment. This correction value (i.e. maximum uncertainty) shall be reported
in the test report.
### 7.10.1a Delay in sending direction (headset UE)
The UE delay in the sending direction is obtained by measuring the delay
between MRP and the electrical access point of the test equipment and
subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment from the measured
value.

NOTE: The test setup only applies to headsets connected by wire. Wireless
headsets (e.g. connected by Bluetooth) are currently out of scope.
The test method is the same as for handset UE (clause 7.10.1).
### 7.10.1b Delay in sending direction (electrical interface UE)
The UE delay T~S~ in the sending direction is obtained by measuring the delay
between output of the electrical reference interface and the electrical access
point of the test equipment; delays introduced by the test equipment are
subtracted from the measured value.

The overall delay measured from output of the electrical reference interface
to the electrical access point of the test equipment is T~S~ + T~TES~, as
illustrated in Figure 17b2a.
The test method is the same as for handset UE (clause 7.10.1), except that the
source levels are as follows:
\- for analogue connections, -60 dBV at electrical reference interface output.
\- for digital connection, -16 dBm0 at electrical reference interface output.
### 7.10.2 Delay in receiving direction (handset UE)
The handset terminal is setup as described in clause 5.
The UE delay in the receiving direction is obtained by measuring the delay
between the electrical access point of the test equipment and the DRP and
subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment from the measured
value.

direction
The delay measured from the electrical access point of the test equipment to
DRP is T~R~ + T~TER~.
T~TER~: The delay between the first electrical event at the electrical access
point of the test equipment and the first bit of the corresponding speech
frame at the system simulator antenna.
Before the actual test for MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access a
conditioning sequence consisting of the British-English single talk sequence
described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] is applied for convergence of the
jitter buffer management of the UE. The conditioning sequence level shall be
-16 dBm0 in order to not overload the codec.
1\. For the measurements a Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T
Recommendation P.501 [22] is used. The pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the
CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use
a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate).The test signal
level is -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent
analogue point.
2 The reference signal is the original signal (test signal). The setup of the
handset/headset terminal is in correspondence to clause 5.1.
3\. The delay is determined by cross-correlation analysis between the measured
signal at the electrical access point and the original signal. The measurement
is corrected by subtracting the test equipment delay T~TER~.
4\. The delay is measured in ms and the maximum of the cross-correlation
envelope is used for the determination.
For MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, a variability of up to 20ms
may be expected between different calls due to the synchronization between the
bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna and the speech frame processing in
the receiving UE. This synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay
according to the definition of the UE delay reference points. Hence, the
maximum value of the UE receiving delay obtained from at least 5 individual
calls shall be reported as the UE delay in the receiving direction. All values
shall be reported in the test report.
### 7.10.2a Delay in receiving direction (headset UE)
The UE delay in the receiving direction is obtained by measuring the delay
between the electrical access point of the test equipment and the DRP and
subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment from the measured
value.

### 7.10.2b Delay in receiving direction (electrical interface UE)
The UE delay T~R~ in the receiving direction is obtained by measuring the
delay between the electrical access point of the test equipment and the input
of the electical reference interface; delays introduced by the test equipment
are subtracted from the measured value.

equipment to the input of the electrical reference interface is T~R~ + T~TER~,
as illustrated in Figure 17b4a.
The test method is the same as for handset UE (clause 7.10.2).
### 7.10.3 Delay in sending + receiving direction using \"echo\" method
(handset UE)
The UE delay is obtained by measuring the delay between the MRP and the DRP
and subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment from the measured
value.
{width="5.99375in" height="3.814583333333333in"}
Figure 17b4bis: Different entities when measuring the delay in sending +
receiving direction
The delay measured from MRP to DRP is (T~S~ + T~R~ + T~SS~).
T~SS~: The delay between the last bit of a speech frame at the system
simulator antenna and the first bit of the looped back speech frame at the
system simulator antenna.
Before the actual test for MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access a
conditioning sequence consisting of the British-English single talk sequence
described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] is applied for convergence of the
jitter buffer management of the UE. The conditioning sequence level shall be
-16 dBm0 in order to not overload the codec.
1\. For the measurements a Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T
Recommendation P.501 [22] is used. It is recommended to use a pn sequence of
32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal level is -4.7 dBPa
at the MRP.
2\. The system simulator is configured for \"loopback\" or \"echo\" operation
with the additional loopback delay as specified below when applicable. In
\"loopback\" or \"echo\" operation, the packets in the sending direction are
routed to the receiving direction by the system simulator.
3\. The reference signal is the original signal (test signal). The setup of
the mobile station is in correspondence to clause 5.1.
4\. The mouth-to-ear delay is determined by cross-correlation analysis between
the measured signal at DRP and the original signal. The analysis window for
the cross-correlation shall start at an instant T > 50ms in order to discard
the cross-correlation peaks corresponding to the direct acoustic path from
mouth to ear and possible delayed sidetone signal. The measurement is
corrected by subtracting the system simulator delay T~SS~ to obtain the T~S~ +
T~R~ delay.
5\. The delay is measured in ms and the maximum of the cross-correlation
envelope is used for the determination.
For MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, a variability of the UE
delay with up to 20ms in the respective sending and receiving direction may be
expected due to the synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE
to the bits of the speech frame on the UE antenna. This synchronization is
attributed to the UE delay according to the definition of the UE delay
reference points. Hence, the UE delay shall be reported as the maximum value
from at least 5 separate calls each with a different loopback delay T~SS~ in
at least 5 steps of 4ms in the full range from 0 to 16ms. All values shall be
reported in the test report.
### 7.10.3a Delay in sending + receiving direction using \"echo\" method
(headset UE)
The UE delay is obtained by measuring the delay between the MRP and the DRP
and subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment, T~SS~, from the
measured value.
The test method is the same as for handset UE (clause 7.10.3).
### 7.10.3b Delay in sending + receiving direction using \"echo\" method
(electrical interface UE)
The UE delay is obtained by measuring the delay between the input and output
of the electrical reference interface; delays introduced by the test equipment
and system simulator, T~SS~, is subtracted from the measured value.
The test method is the same as for handset UE (clause 7.10.3), except that the
source levels are as follows:
\- for analogue connections, -60 dBV at electrical reference interface output.
\- for digital connection, -16 dBm0 at electrical reference interface output.
### 7.10.4 Delay and speech quality in conditions with packet arrival time
variations and packet loss (handset, headset, electrical interface UE)
#### 7.10.4.1 Delay in sending direction
The UE delay in the sending direction, T~S~, shall be measured in jitter and
error free conditions according to clause 7.10.0.
#### 7.10.4.2 Delay in receiving direction
For this test it shall be ensured that the call is originated from the UE.
NOTE 1: Differences have been observed between UE originated calls and UE-
terminated calls. For better consistency, calls from the UE are used.
The test signal consists of 3 repeats of the Composite Source Signal (CSS)
according to ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] followed by a speech signal of
160s. During the first two CSS signals the terminal can adapt its jitter
buffer. The third CSS is used for measuring the delay in constant-delay
condition, and the speech signal is used for delay and quality measurement in
the packet impairment condition.
Constant delay T~c~ corresponding to the minimum delay of the profile (i.e.
the compensation value for the profile) shall be added at the beginning of the
different delay/loss profiles, to avoid unecessary delay jumps between the two
measurement phases and realistic conditions for the second measurement test
phase.
In receiving direction, the delay between the electrical access point of the
test equipment and reference point (RP), T~TEAP-RP~(t) = T~R-jitter~(t) +
T~TER,~ is measured in two successive phases:
1) First the delay in constant-delay condition T~TEAP-RP-constant~ is measured
as described in steps 1 to 4, clause 7.10.2 /7.10.2a/7.10.2b, using the third
CSS signal. The constant delay T~c~ is subtracted from T~TEAP-RP-constant~ to
obtain T~R-constant~.
2) Then the delay with packet impairment T~R-jitter~(t) is measured
continuously for a speech signal during the inclusion of packet delay and loss
profiles in the receiving direction RTP voice stream.
The reference point is defined as follows:
\- for handset and headset UE, the reference point is the DRP.
\- for electrical interface UE, the reference point is the input of the
electrical reference interface.
Packet impairments shall be applied between the reference client and system
simulator eNodeB. Separate calls shall be established for each packet
impairment condition.
The start of the delay profiles must be synchronized with the start of the
downlink speech material reproduction (compensated by the delay between
reproduction and the point of impairment insertion, i.e. the delay of the
reference client) in order to ensure a repeatable application of impairments
to the test speech signal. Tests shall be performed with DTX enabled in the
reference client.
NOTE 2: RTP packet impairments representing packet delay variations and loss
in LTE transmission scenarios are specified in Annex E. These LTE jitter/loss
profiles are reused also for tests with WLAN and NR access. Care must be taken
that the system simulator uses a dedicated bearer with no buffering/scheduling
of packets for transmission.
For the CSS signal repeated 3 times, the pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the
CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use
a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal
level is -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent
analogue point.
For the speech signal, 8 English test sentences according to ITU-T P.501 Annex
C.2.3, normalized to an active speech level of -16dBm0, are used (2 male, 2
female speakers). The sequences are concatenated in such a way that all
sentences are centered within a 4.0s time window, which results in an overall
duration of 32.0s. The sequences are repeated 5 times, resulting in a test
file 160.0s long. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE
jitter buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Equivalent
implementations of the concatenation by repeating the test sentences in
sequence may be used.
For the delay calculation with the speech signal, a cross-correlation with a
rectangular window length of 4s, centered at each sentence of the stimulus
file, is used. The process is repeated for each sample. For each cross
correlation, the maximum of the envelope is obtained producing one delay value
per sentence.
The UE delay in the receive direction, T~R-jitter~(t), is obtained by
subtracting the delay introduced by the test equipment and the simulated
transport network packet delay introduced by the delay and loss profile (as
specified for the respective profile in Annex E) from the first electrical
event at the electrical access point of the test equipment to the first bit of
the corresponding speech frame at the system simulator antenna, T~TER~, from
the measured T~TEAP-DRP~(t).
The difference D~T~ between maximum receiving delay obtained with at least 5
individual calls (see clause 7.10.2) and the delay T~R-constant~ measured for
the CSS signal in constant delay condition is calculated. The quantity \"Call-
to-Call Variability Adjustment\" (CCVA) = max(0,D~T~) shall be added to the
obtained delay for the speech signal T~R-jitter~(t).
For stationary packet delay variation test conditions (test condition 1 and
2), the first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the jitter buffer
management and are discarded from the analysis. The CCVA-adjusted UE delay
(T~R-CCVA~(t) = T~R-jitter~(t) + CCVA) in the receiving direction shall be
reported as the maximum value excluding the two largest values of the
remaining sequence of the 38 sentence delay values, i.e. the 95-percentile
value of T~R-CCVA~(t). The T~R-CCVA~ values for all 40 sentences shall be
reported in the test report.
NOTE 3: The synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE to the
bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna may lead to a variability of up to
20 ms of the measured UE receive delay between different calls. This
synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay according to the
definition of the UE delay reference points The effect of this possible call-
to-call variation is taken into account with the CCVA = max(0,D~T~) value.
#### 7.10.4.3 Speech quality loss in conditions with packet arrival time
variations and packet loss
For the evaluation of speech quality loss in conditions with packet arrival
time variations and packet loss, the test signal described in clause 7.10.4.2
shall be used. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE jitter
buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Two 48 kHz recordings are
used to produce the speech quality loss metric:
\- A recording obtained in jitter and error free conditions with the test
signal described in clause 7.10.4.2 (reference condition)
\- A recording obtained during the application of packet arrival time
variations and packet loss as described in clause 7.10.4.2 (test condition)
The speech quality of the signal is estimated using the measurement algorithm
described in ITU-T Recommendation P.863 [44] in super-wideband mode. For
narrowband speech, the method according to Appendix III of P.863 [44] shall be
used. Level pre-alignment to -26 dBov of recordings shall be used -- see
P.863.1 clause 10.2 [45].
NOTE: For the analysis of acoustical measurements, ITU-T P.863 [44] assumes
diffuse-field equalized recordings. For this reason, signals at DRP are
diffuse-field corrected for testing handset and headset UE. For electrical
interface UE, only the level pre-alignment is applied.
A score shall be computed for each 8s speech sentence pair and averaged to
produce a mean MOS-LQO value for the reference and test conditions.
MOS-LQO~REF~$= (\sum_{i = 1}^{\text{19}}{\text{MOS} -
\text{LQO}_{\text{reference}}}(i)\frac{)}{\text{19}}$
MOS-LQO~TEST~$= (\sum_{i = 1}^{\text{19}}{\text{MOS} -
\text{LQO}_{\text{testcondition}}}(i)\frac{)}{\text{19}}$
NOTE: This evaluation of the speech quality requirement is only applicable to
test conditions with a stationary statistic of the packet delay variation.
Evaluation of the speech quality for a test condition with non-stationary
packet delay variations is for further study.
The synchronization between stimuli and degraded condition shall be done by
the test system before applying the P.863 algorithm on each sentence pair.
### 7.10.5 UE send clock accuracy
The UE clock accuracy in send direction shall be measured according to Annex
D.
NOTE1: For this specific measurement, care should be taken about the clock
accuracy of the test equipment. See Table 1a.
NOTE2: As required in clause 5, prior to the actual measurements for MTSI-
based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, the clocks of the reference client
and the UE have to be synchronized. This measurement of UE send clock accurary
does not need to be repeated and can be obtained from this setup procedure.
### 7.10.6 UE receiving with clock skew
For further study.
## 7.11 Echo control characteristics
### 7.11.1 Test set-up and test signals
The device is set up according to clause 5. The ambient noise level shall be ≤
‑64 dBPa(A).
The test shall be performed with the British-English \"long\" double-talk and
conditioning speech sequences from ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22], with the
signals in the receiving direction band limited according to clause 5.4.
A description of the test stimuli is presented in Table 2a and Table 2b. The
test sequence is composed of an initial conditioning sequence of 23,5 s and a
double talk sequence of 35 s. For the analysis, the double talk sequence is
divided into two segments, a first double-talk sequence with single short
near-end words (0 -- 20 s), and a second double-talk sequence with continuous
double talk (20 -- 35 s).
The sending speech during double-talk and the \"near-end speech only\" are
recorded individually, with the \"near-end speech only\" sequence recorded
with silence in the receiving direction. The time-alignment of the two
recorded sequences is performed off-line during the analysis.

* * *
The level of the signal of the artificial mouth shall be -4,7 dBPa measured at
the MRP. For electrical interface UE, the level of the signal shall be
calibrated to -60 dBV for analogue and to -16 dBm0 for digital connections. In
order to obtain a reproducible time alignment as seen by the UE, the send
signal (artificial mouth, electrical reference interface output) shall be
delayed by the amount of the receiving direction delay. For the purpose of
this alignment, the receiving direction delay for handset and headset modes is
defined from the system simulator input to the artificial ear or the
electrical reference interface, respectively. For hands-free modes, the
downlink delay is defined from the system simulator input to the acoustic
output from the UE loudspeaker.
The level of the downlink signal shall be -16 dBm0 measured at the digital
reference point or the equivalent analogue point.
For electrical interface UE, an echo loss of 30 dB as described in clause
5.1.6 shall be simulated in the electrical reference interface.
### 7.11.2 Test method
The test method measures the duration of any level difference between the
sending signal of a double-talk sequence (where the echo canceller has been
exposed to simultaneous echo and near-end speech) and the sending signal of
the same near-end speech only. The level difference is classified into eight
categories according to Figure 17b5 and Table 2c, representing various degrees
of \"Full duplex operation\", \"Near-end clipping\", and \"Residual echo\".
NOTE 1: The limits for specifying the categories in Figure 17b5 and Table 2c
are provisional pending further analysis and validation.
NOTE 2: The categories in Figure 17b5 and Table 2c are labelled in a
functional order and the subjective impression of the respective categories is
for further study.
NOTE 3: To reduce potential issues associated with low-frequency test room
noise, a [4^th^]-order high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of [100] Hz
can be applied before the level computation.

The T~R-CCVA~ values for all 40 sentences shall also be reported in the test
report.
NOTE 3: The synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE to the
bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna may lead to a variability of up to
20 ms of the measured UE receive delay between different calls. This
synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay according to the
definition of the UE delay reference points. The effect of this possible call-
to-call variation is taken into account with the CCVA = max(0,D~T~) value.
### 7.13.2 Speech quality loss histogram
For the evaluation of speech quality loss in conditions with packet arrival
time variations and packet loss, the speech test signal described in clause
7.13.1 shall be used. Two 48 kHz recordings are used to produce the speech
quality loss metric:
\- A recording obtained in jitter and error free conditions with the test
signal described in clause 7.13.1 (reference condition)
\- A recording obtained during the application of packet arrival time
variations and packet loss as described in clause 7.13.1 (test condition)
The speech quality of the signal is estimated using the measurement algorithm
described in ITU-T Recommendation P.863 [44] in super-wideband mode. For
narrowband speech, the method according to Appendix III of P.863 [44] shall be
used. Level pre-alignment to -26 dBov of recordings shall be used -- see
P.863.1 clause 10.2 [45].
NOTE: For the analysis of acoustical measurements, ITU-T P.863 [44] assumes
diffuse-field equalized recordings. For this reason, signals at DRP are
diffuse-field corrected for testing handset and headset UE. For electrical
interface UE, only the level pre-alignment is applied.
A score shall be computed for each 8s speech sentence pair. The MOS-LQO values
for the reference and test conditions shall be reported in the form of an
histogram covering the range of measured values with a step of 0.1 and the
values for all 20 sentences pairs shall also be reported in the test report.
The following pseudo code provides an example implementation for the
histogram:
> lo=min(floor(MOS-LQO _~test\ condition~_(i=1...20)/0.1)*0.1)
>
> hi=max(ceil(MOS-LQO _~test\ condition~_(i=1...20)/0.1)*0.1)
>
> [n,x]=hist(MOS-LQO _~test\ condition~_(i=1...20),lo:0.1:hi)
>
> bar(x,n)
The synchronization between stimuli and degraded condition shall be done by
the test system before applying the P.863 algorithm on each sentence pair.
# 8 Wideband telephony transmission performance test methods
## 8.1 Applicability
The test methods in this clause shall apply when testing a UE that is used to
provide wideband telephony, either as a stand-alone service, or as part of a
multimedia service.
The application force used to apply the handset against the artificial ear
shall be 8 ± 2 N. For the headset case, the application of the headset shall
comply with ITU-T Recommendation P.57 [14].
## 8.2 Overall loss/loudness ratings
### 8.2.1 General
The SLR and RLR values for GSM, 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN networks apply up to the
POI. However, the main determining factors are the characteristics of the UE,
including the analogue to digital conversion (ADC) and digital to analogue
conversion (DAC). In practice, it is convenient to specify loudness ratings to
the Air Interface. For the normal case, where the GSM, 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN
network introduce no additional loss between the Air Interface and the POI,
the loudness ratings to the PSTN boundary (POI) will be the same as the
loudness ratings measured at the Air Interface.
### 8.2.2 Connections with handset UE
#### 8.2.2.1 Sending loudness rating (SLR)
a) The test signal to be used for the measurements shall be the British-
English single talk sequence described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22]. The
spectrum of the acoustic signal produced by the artificial mouth is calibrated
under free-field conditions at the MRP. The test signal level shall be --4,7
dBPa measured at the MRP. The test signal level is calculated over the
complete test signal sequence.
b) The handset terminal is setup as described in clause 5. The sending
sensitivity shall be calculated from each band of the 20 frequencies given in
table G.1 of ITU‑T Recommendation P.79 Annex A [16], bands 1 to 20. For the

each frequency band is referred to the averaged test signal level measured in
each frequency band at the MRP.
c) The sensitivity is expressed in terms of dBV/Pa and the SLR shall be
calculated according to ITU‑T Recommendation P.79 [16], formula (A-23b), over
bands 1 to 20, using m = 0,175 and the sending weighting factors from ITU‑T
Recommendation P.79 Annex A [16], table A2.
#### 8.2.2.2 Receiving loudness rating (RLR)

English single talk sequence described ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22]. The
test signal level shall be -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or
the equivalent analogue point. The test signal level is calculated over the
complete test signal sequence.
b) The handset terminal is setup as described in clause 5. The receiving
sensitivity shall be calculated from each band of the 20 frequencies given in
table A.2 of ITU‑T Recommendation P.79 Annex A [16], bands 1 to 20. For the
calculation, the averaged measured level at each frequency band is referred to
the averaged test signal level measured in each frequency band.

d) DRP-ERP correction is applied. No leakage correction shall be applied.
#### 8.2.2.3 Receiving loudness rating (RLR) in the presence of background
noise
This test shall be performed with the volume control at the maximum setting.
a) The downlink test signal to be used for the measurements shall be composed
from the British-English material of clause 7.3 in ITU-T Recommendation P.501
[22]. The signal is a concatenation of the following parts (see also Figure
15a6):
1) The complete female short conditioning sequence (which includes a leading 5
s silence which is here used for conditioning the UE under noise-only
conditions). The level shall be -16 dBm0 active speech level (ITU-T P.56)
measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent analogue point.
2) Pause 1 sec.
3) The first 5 s of the male short conditioning sequence. The level shall be
-16 dBm0 active speech level (ITU-T P.56) measured at the digital reference
point or the equivalent analogue point.
4) The complete single-talk sequence. The test signal level shall be -16 dBm0
measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent analogue point. The
test signal level is calculated over the complete single-talk test sequence.
b) The background noise playback shall be set up and calibrated according to
handset related descriptions in ETSI TS 103 224 or ES 202 396-1. The \"Pub
Noise (Pub)\" recording is used. This scenario is available for both playback
systems and is described in sub-clause 8.2 of TS 103 224 (8-channel recording)
and sub-clause 8.2 of ES 202 396-1 (binaural recording). The type of
background noise reproduction used for the test shall be reported.
c) The handset terminal is setup as described in clause 5 and the relevant
noise playback specification, TS 103 224 or ES 202 396-1. Set the volume
control to maximum.
d) The start of the recording of the artificial ear signal and the start of
the background noise playback shall be synchronized to ensure consistent
timing of repeated recordings, and allow background noise cancellation by
subtraction in the time domain as described below. The noise playback shall be
looped with a 20 ms crossfade at the loop point.
e) The background noise and downlink speech stimulus are applied and a
recording of the artificial ear DRP signal is performed. The sound file is
saved (file1). The playback is stopped.
f) The recording described in e) is repeated, this time with muted downlink
signal. The soundfile is saved (file2).
g) A subtraction of the samples is performed (file1-file2). The resulting time
signal contains the output of the UE to the artificial ear, where the
background noise has been essentially eliminated. For further analysis, the
duration of the conditioning sequence and the receive delay from POI to DRP is
discarded, resulting in a time signal containing only the single-talk
sequence.
> h) The RLR is calculated according to sub-clause 8.2.2.2.
### 8.2.3 Connections with desktop and vehicle-mounted hands-free UE
Vehicle-mounted hands-free UE should be tested within the vehicle (for the
totally integrated vehicle hands-free systems) or in a vehicle simulator, as
described in 3GPP TS 03.58 [11].
Free-field measurements for vehicle-mounted hands-free are for further study.
#### 8.2.3.1 Sending loudness rating (SLR)
a) The test signal to be used for the measurements shall be the British-
English single talk sequence described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22]. The
spectrum of the acoustic signal produced by the artificial mouth is calibrated
under free-field conditions at the MRP. The test signal level shall be --4,7
dBPa measured at the MRP. The test signal level is calculated over the
complete test signal sequence. The broadband signal level then is adjusted to
--28,7 dBPa at the HFRP or the HATS HFRP (as defined in ITU-Recommendation
P.581) and the spectrum is not altered.
> The spectrum at the MRP and the actual level at the MRP (measured in
> 1/3-octaves) are used as references to determine the sending sensitivity
> SmJ.
b) The hands-free terminal is setup as described in clause 5. The sending
sensitivity shall be calculated from each band of the 20 frequencies given in
table A.2 of ITU‑T Recommendation P.79 Annex A [16], bands 1 to 20. For the

each frequency band at the MRP.
c) The sensitivity is expressed in terms of dBV/Pa and the SLR shall be
calculated according to ITU‑T Recommendation P.79 [16], formula (A-23b), over
bands 1 to 20, using m = 0,175 and the sending weighting factors from ITU‑T
Recommendation P.79 Annex A [16], table A.2.
#### 8.2.3.2 Receiving loudness rating (RLR)
a) The test signal to be used for the measurements shall be the British-
English single talk sequence described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22]. The
test signal level shall be ‑16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or
the equivalent analogue point. The test signal level is calculated over the
complete test signal sequence.
b) The hands-free terminal is setup as described in clause 5. If a HATS is
used, then it is free-field equalized as described in ITU-T Recommendation
P.581. The equalized output signal of each artificial ear is power-averaged
over the total duration of the analysis; the right and left artificial ear
signals are voltage-summed for each 1/3-octave frequency band; these
1/3-octave band data are considered as the input signal to be used for
calculations or measurements. The receiving sensitivity shall be calculated
from each band of the 20 frequencies given in table A.2 of ITU‑T
Recommendation P.79 Annex A [16], bands 1 to 20.

A.2 of ITU‑T Recommendation P.79 Annex A [16].
d) No leakage correction shall be applied. The hands-free correction as
described in ITU‑T Recommendation P.340 shall be applied. To compute the
receiving loudness rating (RLR) for a hands-free terminal (see also ITU-T
Recommendation P.340), when using the combination of left and right artificial
ear signals from the HATS, the HFL~E~ has to be 8 dB instead of 14 dB. For
further information see ITU-T Recommendation P.581.

Recommendation P.340) when using the combination of left and right artificial
ear signals from the HATS the HFL~E~ has to be 8 dB, instead of 14 dB. For

[16], bands 1-20, m = 0.175 and the weighting factors for JLR according to

## 8.3 Idle channel noise (handset, headset and electrical interface UE)
8.3.0 Overview
For idle noise measurements in sending and receiving directions, care should
be taken that only the noise is windowed out by the analysis and the result is
not impaired by any remaining reverberation or by noise and/or interference
from various other sources. Some examples are air-conducted or vibration-
conducted noise from sources inside or outside the test chamber, disturbances
from lights and regulators, mains supply induced noise including grounding
issues, test system and system simulator inherent noise as well as radio
interference from the UE to test equipment such as ear simulators, microphone
amplifiers, etc.
The following steps shall be followed in advance to both measurement
directions:
a) The test environment shall comply with the conditions described in
subclause 6.1.
b) The terminal should be configured to the test equipment as described in
subclause 5.1.
c) A test signal may have to be intermittently applied to prevent 'silent
mode' operation of the MS. This is for further study.
d) An optional activation sequence may be used, to e.g., override a voice
activity detection. In this case, the additional test signal shall be suitable
regarding level and bandwidth, like e.g., the composite source signals
described in clause 8.10.
To improve repeatability, the test sequence (optional activation followed by
the noise level measurement) may be contiguously repeated one or more times.
### 8.3.1 Sending (handset and headset UE)
In advance to the measurement, the general steps listed in clause 8.3.0 shall
be followed.
a) In advance to the noise level measurement, an optional activation sequence
may be used.
b) The noise level at the output of the SS is measured with A‑weighting. The
A-weighting filter is described in IEC 61672 [38].
c) The measured part of the noise shall be 170,667 ms (which equals 8192
samples in a 48 kHz sample rate test system). The spectral distribution of the
noise is analyzed with an 8k FFT using windowing with ≤ 0,1 dB leakage for non
bin-centered signals. This can be achieved with a window function commonly
known as a \"flat top window\". Within the specified frequency range, the FFT
bin that has the highest level is searched for; the level of this bin is the
maximum level of a single frequency disturbance.
d) The total noise powers obtained from such repeats shall be averaged. The
total result shall be 10 * log~10~ of this average in dB.

c) The measured part of the noise shall be 170,667 ms (which equals 8192
samples in a 48 kHz sample rate test system). The spectral distribution of the
noise is analyzed with an 8k FFT using windowing with ≤ 0,1 dB leakage for non
bin-centered signals. This can be achieved with a window function commonly
known as a \"flat top window\". Within the specified frequency range the FFT
bin that has the highest level is searched for; the level of this bin is the
maximum level of a single frequency disturbance.
d) The total noise powers obtained from such repeats shall be averaged. The
total result shall be 10 * log~10~ of this average in dB.
e) The single frequency maximum powers obtained from such repeats shall be

the electrical sidetone path disabled and both sets of results shall be
reported. In case the STMR is below the limit also with the electrical
sidetone path disabled, the result shall not be regarded as a failure.
Disconnecting the call is normally disabling the electrical sidetone path;
otherwise the UE can be switched off to enter the wanted state.
### 8.5.2 Headset UE
The test signal to be used for the measurements shall be the British-English
single talk sequence described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22]. The
spectrum of the acoustic signal produced by the artificial mouth is calibrated
under free-field conditions at the MRP. The test signal level shall be --4,7
dBPa measured at the MRP. The test signal level is calculated over the
complete test signal sequence.
a) The headset UE is set up as described in clause 5.
b) Where a user operated volume control is provided, the measurements shall be
carried out at the nominal setting of the volume control. In addition the

correction (L~E~) shall be applied. DRP-ERP correction is used.
e) In case the STMR is below the limit, the measurement shall be repeated with
the electrical sidetone path disabled and both sets of results shall be
reported. In case the STMR is below the limit also with the electrical
sidetone path disabled, the result shall not be regarded as a failure.
Disconnecting the call is normally disabling the electrical sidetone path;
otherwise the UE can be switched off to enter the wanted state.
### 8.5.3 Hands-free UE (all categories)
No requirement other than echo control.
### 8.5.3a Electrical interface UE
a) The test signal to be used for the measurements shall be the British-
English single talk sequence described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22]. The
active speech level of the signal shall be calibrated to -60 dBV for analogue
and to -16 dBm0 for digital connections. The test signal level is calculated
over the complete test signal sequence.b) The reference signal to be used for
the calculation shall be the same as the test signal and is calibrated to ‑4.7
dBPa (independent of analogue or digital connection).
c) Where a user operated volume control is provided, the measurements shall be
carried out at the nominal setting of the volume control. In addition, the
measurement is repeated at the maximum volume control setting. It is expected
that for other positions of the volume control setting a consistent behaviour
to that of the nominal and maximum settings should be observed. Additional
measurements for these positions are not required.
d) Measurements shall be made at 1/12-octave intervals as given by the R.40
series of preferred numbers in ISO 3 [54] for frequencies from 100 Hz to 8 kHz
inclusive. The averaged measured level at the electrical receiving reference
interface in each frequency band is referred to the averaged reference signal
level measured in each frequency band.
e) The measured sidetone sensitivity is corrected by a default sensitivity of
21.7 dBPa/V for analogue and 0.9 dBPa/V for digital connections (corresponding
both to a binaural wideband RLR of 8 dB). This correction transfers the
measured electrical sensitivity via an ideal headset (assuming a flat transfer
function regarding ERP) to the acoustical domain.
NOTE: The difference in dB between nominal receiving levels of analogue (-39
dBV) and digital (-16 dBm0 = -18.2 dBV) connection equals 20.8 dB. This offset
is taken into account for the default sensitivity of the analogue connection
(21.7 dBPa/V - 20.8 dB = 0.9 dBPa/V).
f) The sidetone path loss and the STMR (in dB) shall be calculated from
formula 5-1 of ITU-T P.79 [16], using m=0.225 and the weighting factors in
Table 3 of ITU-T P.79 [16]. Leakage correction shall not be applied.
### 8.5.4 Sidetone delay for handset, headset or electrical interface UE
a) The handset or headset terminal is setup as described in clause 5.
b) The test signal is a CS-signal complying with ITU-T Recommendation P.501
using a PN-sequence with a length, T, of 4 096 points (for a 48 kHz sample
rate test system). The duration of the complete test signal is as specified in
ITU-T Recommendation P.501. The level of the signal shall be ‑4,7 dBPa at the
MRP for handset or headset UE. For electrical interface UE, the level of the
signal shall be -60 dBV for analogue and to -16 dBm0 for digital connections.
c) The cross-correlation function Φxy(τ) between the input signal Sx(t)
generated by the test system in send direction and the output signal Sy(t)
measured at the artificial ear (for handset/headset UE) or at the electrical
reference interface (for electrical interface UE) is calculated in the time
domain:
$\Phi_{\text{xy}}(\tau) = \frac{1}{T}\int_{t = \frac{-
T}{2}}^{\frac{T}{2}}S_{x}(t) \cdot S_{y}(t + \tau)$ (1)
d) The measurement window, _T_ , shall be identical to the test signal period,
T, with the measurement window synchronized to the PN-sequence of the test
signal.
e) The sidetone delay is calculated from the envelope E(τ) of the cross-
correlation function Φxy(τ). The envelope E(τ) is calculated by the Hilbert
transformation H {xy(τ)} of the cross-correlation:
$H\left{ \text{xy}(\tau) \right} = \sum_{u = - \infty}^{+
\infty}\frac{\Phi_{\text{xy}}(u)}{\pi(\tau - u)}$ (2)
$E(\tau) = \sqrt{\left\lbrack \Phi_{\text{xy}}(\tau) \right\rbrack^{2} +
\left\lbrack H\left{ \text{xy}(\tau) \right} \right\rbrack^{2}}$ (3)
f) For handset/headset UE:\ The first maximum of the envelope function occurs
in correspondence with the direct sound produced by the artificial mouth; the
second one occurs with a possible delayed sidetone signal. The difference
between the two maxima corresponds to the sidetone delay.\ \ For electrical
interface UE:\ Since there is no direct sound produced by the artifical mouth
and captured by the artifical ear, the maximum of the envelope function
directly corresponds to the sidetone delay. The send and receive delays of the
analogue electrical reference interface shall be subtracted from the
determined sidetone delay.
NOTE: It is assumed that the measured sidetone delay is less than T/2.
## 8.6 Stability loss
Where a user-controlled volume control is provided it is set to maximum.
**Handset UE:** The handset is placed on a hard plane surface with the
earpiece facing the surface.
**Headset UE:** The requirement applies for the closest possible position
between microphone and headset receiver within the intended wearing position.
NOTE: Depending on the type of headset it may be necessary to repeat the
measurement in different positions.
**Hands-free UE (all categories):** No requirement other than echo loss.
Before the actual test a training sequence consisting of the British-English
single talk sequence described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] is applied.
The training sequence level shall be ‑16 dBm0 in order to not overload the
codec.
The test signal is a PN-sequence complying with ITU-T Recommendation P.501
with a length of 4 096 points (for a 48 kHz sampling rate system) and a crest
factor of 6 dB instead of 11 dB. The PN-sequence is generated as described in
P.501 with W(k) constant within the frequency range 100-8000 Hz and zero
outside this range. The duration of the test signal is 250 ms. With an input
signal of ‑3 dBm0, the attenuation from input to output of the system
simulator shall be measured under the following conditions:
a) The handset or the headset, with the transmission circuit fully active,
shall be positioned on a hard plane surface with at least 400 mm free space in
all directions. The earpiece shall face towards the surface as shown in figure
17c;
b) The headset microphone is positioned as close as possible to the
receiver(s) within the intended wearing position;
c) For a binaural headset, the receivers are placed symmetrically around the
microphone.

NOTE: All dimensions in mm.
Figure 17c. Test configuration for stability loss measurement on handset or
headset UE
The attenuation from input to output shall be measured in the frequency range
from 100 Hz to 8 kHz. The spectral distribution of the output signal is
analysed with a 4k FFT (for a 48 kHz sample rate test system), thus the
measured part of the output signal is 85,333 ms. To avoid leakage effects the
frequency resolution of the FFT must be the same as the frequency spacing of
the PN-sequence.
## 8.7 Acoustic echo control
### 8.7.1 General
The echo loss (EL) presented by the GSM, 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN networks at the
POI should be at least 46 dB during single talk. This value takes into account
the fact that UE is likely to be used in a wide range of noise environments.
The calculation of terminal coupling loss (TCL) is based on the attenuation
from reference point input to reference point output versus frequency bands.
The following common measurement steps are applicable for all types of UE
described below:
a) The attenuation from reference point input to reference point output shall
be measured using the compressed real speech signal described in clause 7.3.3
of ITU-T P.501 [33]. The test signal level shall be ‑10 dBm0.
b) The first 17,0 s of the test signal (6 sentences) are discarded from the
analysis to allow for convergence of the acoustic echo canceller. The analysis
is performed over the remaining length of the test sequence (last 6
sentences).
c) The analysis shall be conducted in 1/3-octave band intervals as given by
the R.10 series of preferred numbers in ISO 3 [54]. For the calculation, the
averaged measured echo level at each frequency band is referred to the
averaged test signal level measured in each frequency band.
d) The TCL is calculated according to ITU-T Recommendation G.122 [8], annex B,
clause B.4 (trapezoidal rule), but using the frequency range between 300 to
6700 Hz (instead of 300 Hz to 3400 Hz).
### 8.7.2 Acoustic echo control in a hands-free UE
The hands-free UE is setup in a room with acoustic properties similar to a
typical \"office-type\" room; a vehicle-mounted hands-free UE should be tested
in a vehicle or vehicle simulator, as specified by the UE manufacturer (see
also 3GPP TS 03.58 [11]). The ambient noise level shall be ≤ -70 dBPa(A).
The TCL is measured and calculated according to clause 8.7.1.
### 8.7.3 Acoustic echo control in a handset UE
The handset UE is set up according to clause 5. The ambient noise level shall
be ≤ -64 dBPa(A).
The TCL is measured and calculated according to clause 8.7.1.
### 8.7.4 Acoustic echo control in a headset UE
The headset is set up according to clause 5. The ambient noise level shall be
≤ -64 dBPa(A).
The TCL is measured and calculated according to clause 8.7.1.
### 8.7.5 Acoustic echo control in a electrical interface UE
The electrical interface UE is setup according to clause 5.1.6. In order to
simulate an acoustic echo, the electrical reference interface shall introduce
an echo loss of 30 dB.
The TCL is measured and calculated according to clause 8.7.1.
## 8.8 Distortion
### 8.8.1 Sending distortion
The handset, headset, or hands-free UE is setup as described in clause 5 . The
electrical interface UE is setup as described in clause 5.1.6.
The test signal used is a sine-wave signal with frequencies of 315, 408, 510,
816 and 1020 Hz. The sine-wave signal level shall be calibrated to the
following RMS levels:
\- For handset, headset, or hands-free UE: ‑4.7 dBPa at the MRP for all
frequencies. For the sine-wave with a frequency of 1020 Hz, levels of 5, 0,
‑4.7, ‑10, ‑15, ‑20 dBPa shall be applied.
\- For electrical interface UE with analogue connection: ‑60 dBV for all
frequencies at the output of the electrical reference interface. For the sine-
wave with a frequency of 1020 Hz, levels of -50, -55, -60, -65, -70 and -75
dBV shall be applied.
\- For electrical interface UE with digital connection: ‑16 dBm0 for all
frequencies at the output of the electrical reference interface. For the sine-
wave with a frequency of 1020 Hz, levels of -6, -11, -16, -21, -26 and -31
dBm0 shall be applied.
The test signals have to be applied in this sequence, i.e., from high levels
down to low levels.
The duration of the sine-wave signal is recommended to be 360 ms. The
manufacturer shall be allowed to request tone lengths up to 1 s. The measured
part of the signal for analysis are integer multiple of 85.333 ms and shall be
at least 170,667 ms (which equals 2 * 4096 samples in a 48 kHz sample rate
test system). The times are selected to be relatively short in order to reduce
the risk that the test tone is treated as a stationary signal.
It is recommended that an optional activation signal be presented immediately
preceding each test signal to ensure that the UE is in a typical state during
measurement (see Note 1.). An appropriate speech or speech-like activation
signal shall be chosen from ITU-T Recommendations P.501 [22] or P.50 [10]. A
recommendation for the use of an activation signal as part of the measurement
is defined in figure 18. The RMS level of the active parts of this activation
signal is recommended to be equal to the subsequent test tone RMS level. In
practice, certain types of processing may be impacted due to the introduction
of the activation signal. The manufacturer shall be allowed to specify
disabling of the activation signal. It shall be reported whether an activation
signal was used or not, along with the characteristics of the activation
signal, as specified by the manufacturer.
The ratio of the signal to total distortion power of the signal output of the
SS shall be measured with the psophometric noise weighting (see ITU‑T
Recommendations G.712 [21], O.41 [23] and O.132 [27]). The psophometric filter
shall be normalized (0 dB gain) at 800 Hz as specified in ITU-T Recommendation
O.41 [23]. The weighting function shall be applied to the total distortion
component only (not to the signal component).
For measurement of the total distortion component an octave-wide band-stop
filter shall be applied to the signal to suppress the sine-wave signal and
associated coding artefacts. The filter shall have a lower passband ending at
0.7071 * f~S~, and an upper passband starting at 1.4142 * f~S~, where f~S~ is
the frequency of the sine-wave signal. The passband ripple of the filter shall
be ≤ 0,2 dB. The attenuation of the band-stop filter at the sine-wave
frequency shall be ≥ 60 dB. Alternatively, the described characteristics can
be implemented by an appropriate weighting on the spectrum obtained from an
FFT (transformation length 4096, 75% overlap, Hann window). The total
distortion component is defined as the measured signal within the frequency
range 100 Hz to 6 kHz, after applying psophometric and stop filters (hence no
correction for the lost power due to the stop filter, known as \"bandwidth
correction\", shall be applied).
To improve repeatability, considering the variability introduced by speech
coding and voice processing, the test sequence (activation signal followed by
the test signal) may be contiguously repeated one or more times. The single
signal-to-total-distortion power ratios obtained from such repeats shall be
averaged. The total result shall be 10 * log~10~ of this average in dB.

Figure 18: Recommended activation sequence and test signal.
The activation signal consists of a \"Bandlimited composite source signal with
speech-like power density spectrum\" signal according to ITU-T Recommendation
P.501 [22] with 48,62 ms voiced part (1), 200 ms unvoiced part (2) and 101,38
ms pause (3), followed by the same signal but polarity inverted (4, 5, 6),
followed by the voiced part only (7). The pure test tone is applied and after
50 ms settling time (8), the analysis is made over the following 170,667 ms
(9).
NOTE 1: Depending on the type of codec the test signal used may need to be
adapted. If a sine-wave is not usable, an alternative test signal could be a
band-limited noise signal centered on the above frequencies.
NOTE 2: Void.
NOTE 3: Void.
NOTE 4: In order to ensure that the correct part of the signal is analyzed,
the total delay of the terminal and SS may have to be determined prior to the
measurement.
NOTE 5: For hands-free terminals tested in environments defined in subclause
6.1.2, care should be taken that the reverberation in the test room, caused by
the activation signal, does not affect the test results to an unacceptable
degree, referring to subclause 5.3.
### 8.8.2 Receiving distortion
The handset, headset, or hands-free UE is setup as described in clause 5. The
electrical interface UE is setup as described in clause 5.1.6.
The test signal used is a sine‑wave signal with frequencies 315, 408, 510, 816
and 1020 Hz . The signal level shall be ‑16 dBm0, except for the sine‑wave
signal with a frequency 1020 Hz that shall be applied at the signal input of
the SS at the following levels: 0, ‑3, ‑10, ‑16, ‑20, ‑30, ‑40, ‑45 dBm0. The
test signals have to be applied in this sequence, i.e., from high levels down
to low levels.
The duration of the sine-wave signal is recommended to be 360 ms. The
manufacturer shall be allowed to request tone lengths up to 1 s. The measured
part of the signal shall be 170,667 ms (which equals 2 * 4096 samples in a 48
kHz sample rate test system). The times are selected to be relatively short in
order to reduce the risk that the test tone is treated as a stationary signal.
It is recommended that an optional activation signal be presented immediately
preceding each test signal to ensure that the UE is in a typical state during
measurement (see Note 1.). An appropriate speech or speech-like activation
signal shall be chosen from ITU-T Recommendations P.501 [22] or P.50 [10]. A
recommendation for the use of an activation signal as part of the measurement
is defined in figure 19. The RMS level of the active parts of this activation
signal is recommended to be equal to the subsequent test tone RMS level for
low and medium test levels. To avoid saturation of the SS speech encoder, it
is recommended for high test levels that the activation signal level is
adjusted so that its peak level equals the peak level of the test tone. In
practice, certain types of processing may be impacted due to the introduction
of the activation signal. The manufacturer shall be allowed to specify
disabling of the activation signal. It shall be reported whether an activation
signal was used or not, along with the characteristics of the activation
signal, as specified by the manufacturer.
The ratio of the signal to total distortion power shall be measured at:
\- the applicable acoustic measurement point (DRP with diffuse-field
correction for handset and headset modes; free field for hands-free modes) in
case of handset, headset, or hands-free UE.
\- the applicable electric measurement point (input to the electrical
reference interface) in case of electrical interface UE.
Psophometric noise weighting (see ITU‑T Recommendations G.712 [21], O.41 [23]
and O.132 [27]) shall be applied to the measured signal. The psophometric
filter shall be normalized to have 0 dB gain at 800 Hz as specified in ITU-T
Recommendation O.41 [23]. The weighting function shall be applied to the total
distortion component only (not to the signal component).
For measurement of the total distortion component an octave-wide band-stop
filter shall be applied to the signal to suppress the sine-wave signal and
associated coding artefacts. The filter shall have a lower passband ending at
0,7071 * f~S~, and an upper passband starting at 1,4142 * f~S~, where f~S~ is
the frequency of the sine-wave signal. The passband ripple of the filter shall
be ≤ 0,2 dB. The attenuation of the band stop filter at the sine-wave
frequency shall be ≥ 60 dB. Alternatively the described characteristics can be
implemented by an appropriate weighting on the spectrum obtained from an FFT
(transformation length 4096, 75% overlap, Hann window). The total distortion
component is defined as the measured signal within the frequency range 100 Hz
to 6 kHz, after applying psophometric and stop filters (hence no correction
for the lost power due to the stop filter, known as \"bandwidth correction\",
shall be applied).
To improve repeatability, considering the variability introduced by speech
coding and voice processing, the test sequence (activation signal followed by
the test signal) may be contiguously repeated one or more times. The single
signal-to-total-distortion power ratios obtained from such repeats shall be
averaged. The total result shall be 10 * log~10~ of this average in dB.

Figure 19: Recommended activation sequence and test signal.
The activation signal consists of a \"Bandlimited composite source signal with
speech-like power density spectrum\" signal according to ITU-T Recommendation
P.501 with 48,62 ms voiced part (1), 200 ms unvoiced part (2) and 101,38 ms
pause (3), followed by the same signal but polarity inverted (4, 5, 6),
followed by the voiced part only (7). The pure test tone is applied and after
50 ms settling time (8), the analysis is made over the following 170,667 ms
(9).
NOTE 1: Void.
NOTE 2: Void.
NOTE 3: In order to ensure that the correct part of the signal is analyzed,
the total delay of the terminal and SS may have to be determined prior to the
measurement.
NOTE 4: For hands-free terminals tested in environments defined in subclause
6.1.2, care should be taken that the reverberation in the test room, caused by
the activation signal, does not affect the test results to an unacceptable
degree, referring to subclause 5.3.

## 8.10 Delay
### 8.10.0 UE Delay Measurement Methodologies
For UMTS circuit-switched operation and MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN
access in error and jitter free conditions, the sum of the UE delays in the
sending and receiving directions (TS+TR) shall be measured according to the
methods described in clauses 8.10.1 and 8.10.2. In the event that the delays
of the test equipment in send and/or receive directions are not stable between
calls or cannot be accurately determined, the alternative method described in
clause 8.10.3 may be used to obtain (TS+TR) and the measured instability or
inaccuracy observed when the methods described in 8.10.1 and 8.10.2 were
performed shall be recorded in the test report. The test method(s) used and
all results obtained shall also be recorded in the test report.
For MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access in conditions with simulated
packet arrival time variations, the sum of the UE delays in the sending and
receiving directions (T~S~+T~R-jitter~) and the objective speech quality in
the receive direction shall be measured according to the method described in
clause 8.10.4.
For MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, prior to the actual
measurements, the clock skew between UE and reference client shall be
compensated by adjusting the clock of the reference client to match the clock
of the UE (as stated in clause 5). The inaccuracy of the clock skew adjustment
shall be less than 1ppm measured according to the procedure in Annex D.
It shall be ensured that the packet generation by the reference client and the
packet treatment of the test equipment are free of jitter.
### 8.10.1 Delay in sending direction (handset UE)
The handset terminal is setup as described in clause 5.1.1.
The UE delay in the sending direction is obtained by measuring the delay
between MRP and the electrical access point of the test equipment and
subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment from the measured
value.
Figure 19b1: Different entities when measuring the delay in sending direction
The delay measured from MRP to the electrical access point of **the test
equipment** is T~S~ + T~TES~.
T~TES~: The delay between the last bit of a speech frame at the system
simulator antenna and the first electrical event at the electrical access
point of the test equipment.
1\. For the measurements, a Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T
Recommendation P.501 [22] is used. The pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the
CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use
a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal
level is -4,7 dBPa at the MRP.
2 The reference signal is the original signal (test signal). The setup of the
handset/headset terminal is made corresponding to clause 5.1.
3\. The delay is determined by cross-correlation analysis between the measured
signal at the electrical access point and the original signal. The measurement
is corrected by subtracting the test equipment delay T~TES~.
4\. The delay is measured in ms and the maximum of the cross-correlation
function is used for the determination.
For MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, a variability of up to 20ms
may be expected between different calls due to the synchronization between the
speech frame processing in the sending UE and the bits of the speech frames at
the UE antenna. This synchronization is attributed to the UE sending delay
according to the definition of the UE delay reference points. Hence, the
maximum value of the UE sending delay obtained from at least 5 individual
calls shall be reported as the UE delay in the sending direction. All values
shall be reported in the test report.
A further variability of up to 20ms may be expected between different calls
due to the synchronization between the speech frames at the UE antenna and the
speech frame processing in the receiving reference client of the test system.
In an end-to-end call this synchronization of the frames will only take place
at the receiver, and this variability of the measurement shall be deduced from
the UE sending delay. Hence, if the reference client of the test equipment
does not adjust for the effect of the speech frame synchronization (as
specified by the manufacturer of the reference client), this maximum
uncertainty shall be subtracted from measured maximum value reported as the UE
sending delay in order to compensate for the uncertainty of the test
equipment. This correction value (i.e. maximum uncertainty) shall be reported
in the test report.
### 8.10.1a Delay in sending direction (headset UE)
The UE delay in the sending direction is obtained by measuring the delay
between MRP and the electrical access point of the test equipment and
subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment from the measured
value.
Figure 19b2: Different entities when measuring the delay in sending direction
with a headset connected via cable
NOTE: The test setup only applies to headsets connected by wire. Wireless
headsets (e.g. connected by Bluetooth) are currently out of scope.
The test method is the same as for handset UE (clause 8.10.1).
### 8.10.1b Delay in sending direction (electrical interface UE)
The UE delay T~S~ in the sending direction is obtained by measuring the delay
between output of the electrical reference interface and the electrical access
point of the test equipment; delays introduced by the test equipment are
subtracted from the measured value.
{width="6.694444444444445in" height="2.013888888888889in"}
Figure 19b2a: Different entities when measuring the delay in sending direction
through electical interface UE
The overall delay measured from output of the electrical reference interface
to the electrical access point of the test equipment is T~S~ + T~TES~, as
illustrated in Figure 19b2a.
The test method is the same as for handset UE (clause 8.10.1), except that the
source levels are as follows:
\- for analogue connections, -60 dBV at electrical reference interface output.
\- for digital connection, -16 dBm0 at electrical reference interface output.
### 8.10.2 Delay in receiving direction (handset UE)
The handset terminal is setup as described in clause 5.
The UE delay in the receiving direction is obtained by measuring the delay
between the electrical access point of the test equipment and the DRP and
subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment from the measured
value.
Figure 19b3: Different entities when measuring the delay in receiving
direction
The delay measured from the electrical access point of the test equipment to
DRP is T~R~ + T~TER~.
T~TER~: The delay between the first electrical event at the electrical access
point of the test equipment and the first bit of the corresponding speech
frame at the system simulator antenna.
Before the actual test for MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access a
conditioning sequence consisting of the British-English single talk sequence
described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] is applied for convergence of the
jitter buffer management of the UE. The conditioning sequence level shall be
-16 dBm0 in order to not overload the codec.
1\. For the measurements, a Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T
Recommendation P.501 [22] is used. The pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the
CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use
a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate).The test signal
level is -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent
analogue point.
2 The reference signal is the original signal (test signal). The setup of the
handset/headset terminal is in correspondence to clause 5.1.
3\. The delay is determined by cross-correlation analysis between the measured
signal at the electrical access point and the original signal. The measurement
is corrected by subtracting the test equipment delay T~TER~.
4\. The delay is measured in ms and the maximum of the cross-correlation
function is used for the determination.
For MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, a variability of up to 20ms
may be expected between different calls due to the synchronization between the
bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna and the speech frame processing in
the receiving UE. This synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay
according to the definition of the UE delay reference points. Hence, the
maximum value of the UE receiving delay obtained from at least 5 individual
calls shall be reported as the UE delay in the receiving direction. All values
shall be reported in the test report.
### 8.10.2a Delay in receiving direction (headset UE)
The UE delay in the receiving direction is obtained by measuring the delay
between the electrical access point of the test equipment and the DRP and
subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment from the measured
value.
Figure 19b4: Different entities when measuring the delay in receiving
direction with a headset connected via cable
NOTE: The test setup only applies to headsets connected by wire. Wireless
headsets (e.g. connected by Bluetooth) are currently out of scope.
The test method is the same as for handset UE (subclause 8.10.2).
### 8.10.2b Delay in receiving direction (electrical interface UE)
The UE delay T~R~ in the receiving direction is obtained by measuring the
delay between the electrical access point of the test equipment and the input
of the electical reference interface; delays introduced by the test equipment
are subtracted from the measured value.
{width="6.694444444444445in" height="2.013888888888889in"}
Figure 19b4a: Different entities when measuring the delay in receiving
direction through electical interface UE
The overall delay measured from the electrical access point of the test
equipment to the input of the electrical reference interface is T~R~ + T~TER~,
as illustrated in Figure 19b4a.
The test method is the same as for handset UE (clause 8.10.2).
### 8.10.3 Delay in sending + receiving direction using \"echo\" method
(handset UE)
The UE delay is obtained by measuring the delay between the MRP and the DRP
and subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment from the measured
value.
Figure 19b4bis: Different entities when measuring the delay in sending +
receiving direction
The delay measured from MRP to DRP is (T~S~ + T~R~+ T~SS~).
T~SS~: The delay between the last bit of a speech frame at the system
simulator antenna and the first bit of the looped back speech frame at the
system simulator antenna.
Before the actual test for MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access a
conditioning sequence consisting of the British-English single talk sequence
described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] is applied for convergence of the
jitter buffer management of the UE. The conditioning sequence level shall be
-16 dBm0 in order to not overload the codec.
1\. For the measurements a Composite Source Signal (CSS) according to ITU-T
Recommendation P.501 [22] is used. It is recommended to use a pn sequence of
32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal level is -4.7 dBPa
at the MRP.
2\. The system simulator is configured for \"loopback\" or \"echo\" operation
with the additional loopback delay as specified below when applicable. In
\"loopback\" or \"echo\" operation, the packets in the sending direction are
routed to the receiving direction by the system simulator.
3\. The reference signal is the original signal (test signal). The setup of
the mobile station is in correspondence to clause 5.1.
4\. The mouth-to-ear delay is determined by cross-correlation analysis between
the measured signal at DRP and the original signal. The analysis window for
the cross-correlation shall start at an instant T > 50ms in order to discard
the cross-correlation peaks corresponding to the direct acoustic path from
mouth to ear and possible delayed sidetone signal. The measurement is
corrected by subtracting the system simulator delay T~SS~ to obtain the T~S~ +
T~R~ delay.
5\. The delay is measured in ms and the maximum of the cross-correlation
envelope is used for the determination.
For MTSI-based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, a variability of the UE
delay with up to 20ms in the respective sending and receiving direction may be
expected due to the synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE
to the bits of the speech frame on the UE antenna. This synchronization is
attributed to the UE delay according to the definition of the UE delay
reference points. Hence, the UE delay shall be reported as the maximum value
from at least 5 separate calls each with a different loopback delay TSS in at
least 5 steps of 4ms in the full range from 0 to 16ms. All values shall be
reported in the test report.
### 8.10.3a Delay in sending + receiving direction using \"echo\" method
(headset UE)
The UE delay is obtained by measuring the delay between the MRP and the DRP
and subtracting the delays introduced by the test equipment, T~SS~, from the
measured value.
The test method is the same as for handset UE (clause 8.10.3).
### 8.10.3b Delay in sending + receiving direction using \"echo\" method
(electrical interface UE)
The UE delay is obtained by measuring the delay between the input and output
of the electrical reference interface; delays introduced by the test equipment
and system simulator, T~SS~, is subtracted from the measured value.
The test method is the same as for handset UE (clause 8.10.3), except that the
source levels are as follows:
\- for analogue connections, -60 dBV at electrical reference interface output.
\- for digital connection, -16 dBm0 at electrical reference interface output.
### 8.10.4 Delay and speech quality in conditions with packet arrival time
variations and packet loss (handset, headset, electrical interface UE)
#### 8.10.4.1 Delay in sending direction
The UE delay in the sending direction, T~S~, shall be measured in jitter and
error free conditions according to clause 8.10.0.
#### 8.10.4.2 Delay in receiving direction
For this test it shall be ensured that the call is originated from the UE.
NOTE 1: Differences have been observed between UE-originated calls and UE-
terminated calls. For better consistency, calls from the UE are used.
The test signal consists of 3 repeats of the Composite Source Signal (CSS)
according to ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] followed by a speech signal of
160s. During the first two CSS signals the terminal can adapt its jitter
buffer. The third CSS is used for measuring the delay in constant-delay
condition, and the speech signal is used for delay and quality measurement in
the packet impairment condition.
Constant delay T~c~ corresponding to the minimum delay of the profile (i.e.
the compensation value for the profile) shall be added at the beginning of the
different delay/loss profiles, to avoid unecessary delay jumps between the two
measurement phases and realistic conditions for the second measurement test
phase.
In receiving direction, the delay between the electrical access point of the
test equipment and the reference point (RP), T~TEAP-RP~(t) = T~R-jitter~(t) +
T~TER,~ is measured in two successive phases:
> 1) First the delay in constant-delay condition TTEAP-DRP-constant is
> measured as described in steps 1 to 4, clause 8.10.2/8.10.2a/8.10.2b, using
> the third CSS signal. The constant delay T~c~ is subtracted from T~TEAP-RP~
> to obtain T~R-constant~.
2) Then the delay with packet impairment T~R-jitter~(t) is measured
continuously for a speech signal during the inclusion of packet delay and loss
profiles in the receiving direction RTP voice stream.
The reference point is defined as follows:
\- for handset and headset UE, the reference point is the DRP.
\- for electrical interface UE, the reference point is the input of the
electrical reference interface.
Packet impairments shall be applied between the reference client and system
simulator eNodeB. Separate calls shall be established for each packet
impairment condition.
The start of the delay profiles must be synchronized with the start of the
downlink speech material reproduction (compensated by the delay between
reproduction and the point of impairment insertion, i.e. the delay of the
reference client) in order to ensure a repeatable application of impairments
to the test speech signal. Tests shall be performed with DTX enabled in the
reference client.
NOTE 2: RTP packet impairments representing packet delay variations and loss
in LTE transmission scenarios are specified in Annex E. These LTE jitter/loss
profiles are reused also for tests with WLAN and NR access. Care must be taken
that the system simulator uses a dedicated bearer with no buffering/scheduling
of packets for transmission.
For the CSS signal repeated 3 times, the pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the
CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use
a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal
level is -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent
analogue point.
For the speech signal, 8 English test sentences according to ITU-T P.501 Annex
C.2.3, normalized to an active speech level of -16dBm0, are used (2 male, 2
female speakers). The sequences are concatenated in such a way that all
sentences are centered within a 4.0s time window, which results in an overall
duration of 32.0s. The sequences are repeated 5 times, resulting in a test
file 160.0s long. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE
jitter buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Equivalent
implementations of the concatenation by repeating the test sentences in
sequence may be used.
For the delay calculation with the speech signal, a cross-correlation with a
rectangular window length of 4s, centered at each sentence of the stimulus
file, is used. The process is repeated for each sample. For each cross
correlation, the maximum of the envelope is obtained producing one delay value
per sentence.
The UE delay in the receive direction, T~R-jitter~(t), is obtained by
subtracting the delay introduced by the test equipment and the simulated
transport network packet delay introduced by the delay and loss profile (as
specified for the respective profile in Annex E) from the first electrical
event at the electrical access point of the test equipment to the first bit of
the corresponding speech frame at the system simulator antenna, T~TER~, from
the measured T~TEAP-DRP~(t).
The difference D~T~ between maximum receiving delay obtained with at least 5
individual calls (see clause 7.10.2) and the delay T~R-constant~ measured for
the CSS signal in constant delay condition is calculated. The quantity \"Call-
to-Call Variability Adjustment\" (CCVA) = max(0,D~T~) shall be added to the
obtained delay for the speech signal T~R-jitter~(t).
For stationary packet delay variation test conditions (test condition 1 and
2), the first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the jitter buffer
management and are discarded from the analysis. The CCVA-adjusted UE delay
(T~R-CCVA~(t) = T~R-jitter~(t) + CCVA) in the receiving direction shall be
reported as the maximum value excluding the two largest values of the
remaining sequence of the 38 sentence delay values, i.e. the 95-percentile
value of T~R-CCVA~(t). The T~R-CCVA~ values for all 40 sentences shall be
reported in the test report.
NOTE 3: The synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE to the
bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna may lead to a variability of up to
20 ms of the measured UE receive delay between different calls. This
synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay according to the
definition of the UE delay reference points The effect of this possible call-
to-call variation is taken into account with the CCVA = max(0,D~T~) value.
#### 8.10.4.3 Speech quality loss in conditions with packet arrival time
variations and packet loss
For the evaluation of speech quality loss in conditions with packet arrival
time variations and packet loss, the test signal described in clause 8.10.4.2
shall be used. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE jitter
buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Two 48 kHz recordings are
used to produce the speech quality loss metric:
\- A recording obtained in jitter and error free conditions with the test
signal described in clause 8.10.4.2 (reference condition)
\- A recording obtained during the application of packet arrival time
variations and packet loss as described in clause 8.10.4.2 (test condition)
The speech quality of the signal is estimated using the measurement algorithm
described in ITU-T Recommendation P.863 [44] in super-wideband mode. Level
pre-alignment to -26 dBov of recordings shall be used -- see P.863.1 clause
10.2 [45].
NOTE: for the analysis of acoustical measurements, P.863 [44] assumes diffuse-
field equalized recordings. For this reason, signals at DRP are diffuse-
fieldcorrected for testing handset and headset UE. For electrical interface
UE, only the level pre-alignment is applied.
A score shall be computed for each 8s speech sentence pair and averaged to
produce a mean MOS-LQO value for the reference and test conditions.
MOS-LQO~REF~$= (\sum_{i = 1}^{\text{19}}{\text{MOS} -
\text{LQO}_{\text{reference}}}(i)\frac{)}{\text{19}}$
MOS-LQO~TEST~ $= (\sum_{i = 1}^{\text{19}}{\text{MOS} -
\text{LQO}_{\text{testcondition}}}(i)\frac{)}{\text{19}}$
NOTE: This evaluation of the speech quality requirement is only applicable to
test conditions with a stationary statistic of the packet delay variation.
Evaluation of the speech quality for a test condition with non-stationary
packet delay variations is for further study.
The synchronization between stimuli and degraded condition shall be done by
the test system before applying the P.863 algorithm on each sentence pair.
### 8.10.5 UE send clock accuracy
The UE clock accuracy in send direction shall be measured according to Annex
D.
NOTE1: For this specific measurement, care should be taken about the clock
accuracy of the test equipment. See Table 1a.
NOTE2: As required in clause 5, prior to the actual measurements for MTSI-
based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, the clocks of the reference client
and the UE have to be synchronized. This measurement of UE send clock accurary
does not need to be repeated and can be obtained from this setup procedure.
### 8.10.6 UE receiving with clock skew
For further study.
## 8.11 Echo control characteristics
### 8.11.1 Test set-up and test signals
The device is set up according to clause 5. The ambient noise level shall be ≤
‑64 dBPa(A).
The test shall be performed with the British-English \"long\" double-talk and
conditioning speech sequences from ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22], with the
signals in the receiving direction band limited according to clause 5.4.
A description of the test stimuli is presented in Table 2e and Table 2f. The
test sequence is composed of an initial conditioning sequence of 23,5 s and a
double talk sequence of 35 s. For the analysis, the double talk sequence is
divided into two segments, a first double-talk sequence with single short
near-end words (0 -- 20 s), and a second double-talk sequence with continuous
double talk (20-35 s).
The sending speech during double-talk and the \"near-end speech only\" are
recorded individually, with the \"near-end speech only\" sequence recorded
with silence in the receiving direction. The time-alignment of the two
recorded sequences is performed off-line during the analysis.

The level of the signal of the artificial mouth shall be - 4.7 dBPa measured
at the MRP. For electrical interface UE, the level of the signal shall be
calibrated to -60 dBV for analogue and to -16 dBm0 for digital connections. In
order to obtain a reproducible time alignment as seen by the UE, the send
signal (artificial mouth, electrical reference interface output) shall be
delayed by the amount of the receiving direction delay. For the purpose of
this alignment, the receiving direction delay for handset and headset modes is
defined from the system simulator input to the artificial ear or the
electrical reference interface, respectively. For handsfree modes, the
downlink delay is defined from the system simulator input to the acoustic
output from the UE loudspeaker.
The level of the downlink signal shall be -16 dBm0 measured at the digital
reference point or the equivalent analogue point.
For electrical interface UE, an echo loss of 30 dB as described in clause
5.1.6 shall be simulated in the electrical reference interface.
### 8.11.2 Test method
The test method measures the duration of any level difference between the
sending signal of a double-talk sequence (where the echo canceller has been
exposed to simultaneous echo and near-end speech) and the sending signal of
the same near-end speech only. The level difference is classified into eight
categories according to Figure 19b5 and Table 2g, representing various degrees
of \"Full duplex operation\", \"Near-end clipping\", and \"Residual echo\".
NOTE: The limits for specifying the categories in Figure 19b5 and Table 2g are
provisional pending further analysis and validation.
NOTE: The categories in Figure 19b5 and Table 2g are labelled in a functional
order and the subjective impression of the respective categories is for
further study.
NOTE: To reduce potential issues associated with low-frequency test room
noise, a [4^th^]-order high-pass filter with a cut-off frequency of [100] Hz
can be applied before the level computation.

The T~R-CCVA~ values for all 40 sentences shall also be reported in the test
report.
NOTE 3: The synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE to the
bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna may lead to a variability of up to
20 ms of the measured UE receive delay between different calls. This
synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay according to the
definition of the UE delay reference points. The effect of this possible call-
to-call variation is taken into account with the CCVA = max(0,D~T~) value.
### 8.13.2 Speech quality loss histogram
For the evaluation of speech quality loss in conditions with packet arrival
time variations and packet loss, the speech test signal described in clause
8.13.1 shall be used. Two 48 kHz recordings are used to produce the speech
quality loss metric:
\- A recording obtained in jitter and error free conditions with the test
signal described in clause 8.13.1 (reference condition)
\- A recording obtained during the application of packet arrival time
variations and packet loss as described in clause 8.13.1 (test condition)
The speech quality of the signal is estimated using the measurement algorithm
described in ITU-T Recommendation P.863 [44] in super-wideband mode. Level
pre-alignment to -26 dBov of recordings shall be used -- see P.863.1 clause
10.2 [45].
NOTE: For the analysis of acoustical measurements, ITU-T P.863 [44] assumes
diffuse-field equalized recordings. For this reason, signals at DRP are
diffuse-field corrected for testing handset and headset UE. For electrical
interface UE, only the level pre-alignment is applied.
A score shall be computed for each 8s speech sentence pair. The MOS-LQO values
for the reference and test conditions shall be reported in the form of an
histogram covering the range of measured values with a step of 0.1 and the
values for all 20 sentences pairs shall also be reported in the test report.
The following pseudo code provides an example implementation for the
histogram:
> lo=min(floor(MOS-LQO _~test\ condition~_(i=1...20)/0.1)*0.1)
>
> hi=max(ceil(MOS-LQO _~test\ condition~_(i=1...20)/0.1)*0.1)
>
> [n,x]=hist(MOS-LQO _~test\ condition~_(i=1...20),lo:0.1:hi)
>
> bar(x,n)
The synchronization between stimuli and degraded condition shall be done by
the test system before applying the P.863 algorithm on each sentence pair.
# 9 Super-wideband telephony transmission performance test methods
## 9.1 Applicability
The test methods in this clause shall apply when testing a UE that is used to
provide super-wideband telephony, either as a stand-alone service, or as part
of a multimedia service.
The application force used to apply the handset against the artificial ear
shall be 8 ± 2 N. For the headset case, the application of the headset shall

## 9.2 Overall loss/loudness ratings
### 9.2.1 General
The SLR and RLR values for GSM, 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN networks apply up to the
POI. However, the main determining factors are the characteristics of the UE,
including the analogue to digital conversion (ADC) and digital to analogue
conversion (DAC). In practice, it is convenient to specify loudness ratings to
the Air Interface. For the normal case, where the GSM, 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN
network introduce no additional loss between the Air Interface and the POI,
the loudness ratings to the PSTN boundary (POI) will be the same as the
loudness ratings measured at the Air Interface.

## 9.3 Idle channel noise (handset, headset and eletrical interface UE)
9.3.0 Overview
For idle noise measurements in sending and receiving directions, care should
be taken that only the noise is windowed out by the analysis and the result is
not impaired by any remaining reverberation or by noise and/or interference
from various other sources. Some examples are air-conducted or vibration-
conducted noise from sources inside or outside the test chamber, disturbances
from lights and regulators, mains supply induced noise including grounding
issues, test system and system simulator inherent noise as well as radio
interference from the UE to test equipment such as ear simulators, microphone
amplifiers, etc.
The following steps shall be followed in advance to both measurement
directions:
a) The test environment shall comply with the conditions described in
subclause 6.1.
b) The terminal should be configured to the test equipment as described in
subclause 5.1.
c) A test signal may have to be intermittently applied to prevent 'silent
mode' operation of the MS. This is for further study.
d) An optional activation sequence may be used, to e.g., override a voice
activity detection. In this case, the additional test signal shall be suitable
regarding level and bandwidth, like e.g., the composite source signals
described in clause 9.10.
To improve repeatability, the test sequence (optional activation followed by
the noise level measurement) may be contiguously repeated one or more times.

with A‑weighting. The A-weighting filter is described in IEC 61672 [38].
c) The measured part of the noise shall be 170,667 ms (which equals 8192
samples in a 48 kHz sample rate test system). The spectral distribution of the
noise is analyzed with an 8k FFT using windowing with ≤ 0,1 dB leakage for non
bin-centered signals. This can be achieved with a window function commonly
known as a \"flat top window\". Within the specified frequency range, the FFT
bin that has the highest level is searched for; the level of this bin is the
maximum level of a single frequency disturbance.
d) The total noise powers obtained from such repeats shall be averaged. The
total result shall be 10 * log~10~ of this average in dB.
e) The single frequency maximum powers obtained from such repeats shall be
averaged. The total result shall be 10 * log~10~ of this average in dB.

DRP with diffuse-field correction. The A-weighting filter is described in
IEC61672 [38].
The measured part of the noise shall be 170,667 ms (which equals 8192 samples
in a 48 kHz sample rate test system). The spectral distribution of the noise
is analyzed with an 8k FFT using windowing with ≤ 0,1 dB leakage for non bin-
centered signals. This can be achieved with a window function commonly known
as a \"flat top window\". Within the specified frequency range the FFT bin
that has the highest level is searched for; the level of this bin is the
maximum level of a single frequency disturbance.
.
d) The total noise powers obtained from such repeats shall be averaged. The
total result shall be 10 * log~10~ of this average in dB.
e) The single frequency maximum powers obtained from such repeats shall be
averaged. The total result shall be 10 * log~10~ of this average in dB.

Where a user-controlled volume control is provided it is set to maximum.
**Handset UE:** The handset is placed on a hard plane surface with the
earpiece facing the surface.
**Headset UE:** The requirement applies for the closest possible position
between microphone and headset receiver within the intended wearing position.
NOTE: Depending on the type of headset it may be necessary to repeat the

**Hands-free UE (all categories):** No requirement other than echo loss.

The training sequence level shall be ‑16 dBm0 in order to not overload the

outside this range. The duration of the test signal is 250 ms. With an input
signal of ‑3 dBm0, the attenuation from input to output of the system
simulator shall be measured under the following conditions:
a) The handset or the headset, with the transmission circuit fully active,
shall be positioned on a hard plane surface with at least 400 mm free space in
all directions. The earpiece shall face towards the surface as shown in figure

NOTE: All dimensions in mm.
Figure 20. Test configuration for stability loss measurement on handset or
headset UE
The attenuation from input to output shall be measured in the frequency range
from 100 Hz to 16 kHz. The spectral distribution of the output signal is
analysed with a 4k FFT (for a 48 kHz sample rate test system), thus the
measured part of the output signal is 85,333 ms. To avoid leakage effects the
frequency resolution of the FFT must be the same as the frequency spacing of
the PN-sequence.
## 9.7 Acoustic echo control
### 9.7.1 General
The echo loss (EL) presented by the GSM, 3G, LTE, NR or WLAN networks at the
POI should be at least 46 dB during single talk. This value takes into account
the fact that UE is likely to be used in a wide range of noise environments.
NOTE: A test method fully adapted to super-wideband acoustic echo control is
for further study
The calculation of terminal coupling loss (TCL) is based on the attenuation
from reference point input to reference point output versus frequency bands.
The following common measurement steps are applicable for all types of UE
described below:
a) The attenuation from reference point input to reference point output shall
be measured using the compressed real speech signal described in clause 7.3.3
of ITU-T P.501 Amendment 1 [33]. The test signal level shall be ‑10 dBm0.
b) The first 17,0 s of the test signal (6 sentences) are discarded from the
analysis to allow for convergence of the acoustic echo canceller. The analysis
is performed over the remaining length of the test sequence (last 6
sentences).
c) The analysis shall be conducted in 1/3-octave band intervals as given by
the R.10 series of preferred numbers in ISO 3 [54]. For the calculation, the
averaged measured echo level at each frequency band is referred to the
averaged test signal level measured in each frequency band.
d) The TCL is calculated according to ITU-T Recommendation G.122 [8], annex B,
clause B.4 (trapezoidal rule), but using the frequency range between 300 to
6700 Hz (instead of 300 Hz to 3400 Hz).
### 9.7.2 Acoustic echo control in a hands-free UE
The hands-free UE is setup in a room with acoustic properties similar to a
typical \"office-type\" room; a vehicle-mounted hands-free UE should be tested
in a vehicle or vehicle simulator, as specified by the UE manufacturer (see
also 3GPP TS 03.58 [11]). The ambient noise level shall be ≤ -70 dBPa(A).
The TCL is measured and calculated according to clause 9.7.1.
### 9.7.3 Acoustic echo control in a handset UE
The handset UE is set up according to clause 5. The ambient noise level shall
be ≤ -64 dBPa(A).
The TCL is measured and calculated according to clause 9.7.1.

≤ -64 dBPa(A). The TCL is measured and calculated according to clause 9.7.1.

test signal properties for super-wideband described in clause 5.4).
### 9.10.2b Delay in receiving direction (electrical interface UE)
The test method is the same as in wideband (see clause 8.10.2b, observing the

### 9.10.3 Delay in sending + receiving direction using \"echo\" method
(handset UE)

### 9.10.3a Delay in sending + receiving direction using \"echo\" method
(headset UE)
The test method is the same as in wideband (see clause 8.10.3a, observing the

### 9.10.3b Delay in sending + receiving direction using \"echo\" method
(electrical interface UE)
The test method is the same as in wideband (see clause 8.10.3b, observing the
test signal properties for super-wideband in clause 5.4).
### 9.10.4 Delay and speech quality in conditions with packet arrival time
variations and packet loss (handset, headset, electrical interface UE)
#### 9.10.4.1 Delay in sending direction
The test method is the same as in wideband (see clause 8.10.4.1).
#### 9.10.4.2 Delay in receiving direction
For this test it shall be ensured that the call is originated from the UE.
NOTE 1: Differences have been observed between UE originated call and UE-
terminated call. For better consistency calls from the UE are used.
The test signal consists of 3 repeats of the Composite Source Signal (CSS)
according to ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] followed by a speech signal of
160s. During the first two CSS signals the terminal can adapt its jitter
buffer. The third CSS is used for measuring the delay in constant-delay
condition, and the speech signal is used for delay and quality measurement in
the packet impairment condition.
Constant delay T~c~ corresponding to the minimum delay of the profile (i.e.
the compensation value for the profile) shall be added at the beginning of the
different delay/loss profiles, to avoid unecessary delay jumps between the two
measurement phases and realistic conditions for the second measurement test
phase.
In receiving direction, the delay between the electrical access point of the
test equipment and the reference point (RP), T~TEAP-RP~(t) = T~R-jitter~(t) +
T~TER,~ is measured in two successive phases:
1 First the delay in constant-delay condition T~TEAP-RP-constant~ is measured
as described in steps 1 to 4, clause 9.10.2/ 9.10.2a/9.10.2b, using the third
CSS signal. The constant delay T~c~ is subtracted from T~TEAP-DRP~ to obtain
T~R-constant~.
2 Then the delay with packet impairment T~R-jitter~(t) is measured
continuously for a speech signal during the inclusion of packet delay and loss
profiles in the receiving direction RTP voice stream.
The reference point is defined as follows:
\- for handset and headset UE, the reference point is the DRP.
\- for electrical interface UE, the reference point is the input of the
electrical reference interface.
Packet impairments shall be applied between the reference client and system
simulator eNodeB. Separate calls shall be established for each packet
impairment condition.
The start of the delay profiles must be synchronized with the start of the
downlink speech material reproduction (compensated by the delay between
reproduction and the point of impairment insertion, i.e. the delay of the
reference client) in order to ensure a repeatable application of impairments
to the test speech signal. Tests shall be performed with DTX enabled in the
reference client.
NOTE 2: RTP packet impairments representing packet delay variations and loss
in LTE transmission scenarios are specified in Annex E. These LTE jitter/loss
profiles are reused also for tests with WLAN and NR access. Care must be taken
that the system simulator uses a dedicated bearer with no buffering/scheduling
of packets for transmission.
For the CSS signal repeated 3 times, the pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the
CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use
a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal
level is -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent
analogue point.
For the speech signal, 8 English test sentences according to ITU-T P.501 Annex
C.2.3, normalized to an active speech level of -16dBm0, are used (2 male, 2
female speakers). The sequences are concatenated in such a way that all
sentences are centered within a 4.0s time window, which results in an overall
duration of 32.0s. The sequences are repeated 5 times, resulting in a test
file 160.0s long. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE
jitter buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Equivalent
implementations of the concatenation by repeating the test sentences in
sequence may be used.
For the delay calculation with the speech signal, a cross-correlation with a
rectangular window length of 4s, centered at each sentence of the stimulus
file, is used. The process is repeated for each sample. For each cross
correlation, the maximum of the envelope is obtained producing one delay value
per sentence.
The UE delay in the receive direction, T~R-jitter~(t), is obtained by
subtracting the delay introduced by the test equipment and the simulated
transport network packet delay introduced by the delay and loss profile (as
specified for the respective profile in Annex E) from the first electrical
event at the electrical access point of the test equipment to the first bit of
the corresponding speech frame at the system simulator antenna, T~TER~, from
the measured T~TEAP-DRP~(t).
The difference D~T~ between maximum receiving delay obtained with at least 5
individual calls (see clause 7.10.2) and the delay T~R-constant~ measured for
the CSS signal in constant delay condition is calculated. The quantity \"Call-
to-Call Variability Adjustment\" (CCVA) = max(0,D~T~) shall be added to the
obtained delay for the speech signal T~R-jitter~(t).
For stationary packet delay variation test conditions (test condition 1 and
2), the first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the jitter buffer
management and are discarded from the analysis. The CCVA-adjusted UE delay
(T~R-CCVA~(t) = T~R-jitter~(t) + CCVA) in the receiving direction shall be
reported as the maximum value excluding the two largest values of the
remaining sequence of the 38 sentence delay values, i.e. the 95-percentile
value of T~R-CCVA~(t). The T~R-CCVA~ values for all 40 sentences shall be
reported in the test report.
NOTE 3: The synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE to the
bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna may lead to a variability of up to
20 ms of the measured UE receive delay between different calls. This
synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay according to the
definition of the UE delay reference points The effect of this possible call-
to-call variation is taken into account with the CCVA = max(0,D~T~) value.
#### 9.10.4.3 Speech quality loss in conditions with packet arrival time
variations and packet loss
The test method is the same as in wideband (see clause 8.10.4.3, observing the
test signal properties for super-wideband described in clause 5.4).
### 9.10.5 UE send clock accuracy
The UE clock accuracy in send direction shall be measured according to Annex
D.
NOTE1: For this specific measurement, care should be taken about the clock
accuracy of the test equipment. See Table 1a.
NOTE2: As required in clause 5, prior to the actual measurements for MTSI-
based speech with LTE, NR or WLAN access, the clocks of the reference client
and the UE have to be synchronized. This measurement of UE send clock accurary
does not need to be repeated and can be obtained from this setup procedure.
### 9.10.6 UE receiving with clock skew
For further study.
## 9.11 Echo control characteristics
### 9.11.1 Test set-up and test signals
The test method is the same as for wideband (see sub-clause 8.11.1, observing
the signal properties for super-wideband described in sub-clause 5.4).
### 9.11.2 Test method
The test method is the same as for wideband (see sub-clause 8.11.2, observing
the signal properties for super-wideband described in sub-clause 5.4).

The test method is the same as for wideband (see sub-clause 8.11.2.2).
#### 9.11.2.3 Classification into categories
The test method is the same as for wideband (see sub-clause 8.11.2.3).
## 9.12 Send speech quality and noise intrusiveness in the presence of ambient
noise
### 9.12.1 Handset UE
The speech quality in sending for super-wideband systems is tested based on
ETSI TS 103 281 [50]. This test method leads to three MOS-LQO~fb~ quality
numbers:
\- N-MOS-LQO~fb~: Transmission quality of the background noise
\- S-MOS-LQO~fb~: Transmission quality of the speech
\- G-MOS-LQO~fb~: Overall transmission quality
The test arrangement is given in clause 5.1.5. For connections with handset
UE, the measurement is conducted for 8 noise conditions as described in Table
2i. The measurements should be made in the same unique and dedicated call. The
noise types shall be presented according to the order specified in Table 2i.

1) Before starting the measurements, the calibration procedure described in
clause 9.5 of ETSI TS 103 281 [50] shall be performed with the UE in handset
mode. Also, a proper conditioning sequence shall be used. The conditioning
sequence shall be comprised of the four additional sentences 1-4 described in
ETSI TS 103 281 [50], applied to the beginning of the 16-sentence test
sequence.
NOTE: The sequence of speech samples concatenated for the test signal,
consisting of alternating talkers in the sending direction, reduces the
overall test time but may represent an unrealistic behaviour for certain voice
enhancement technologies. Alternative concatenations are for further study.
2) The send speech signal consists of the 16 sentences of speech as described
in ETSI TS 103 281 [50] The test signal level is - 1.7 dBPa at the MRP,
measured as active speech level per ITU-T P.56 [37]. Two signals are required
for the tests:
\- The clean speech signal is used as the undisturbed reference (see ETSI TS
103 281 [50])
\- The send signal is recorded at the POI.
3) N-MOS-LQO~fb~, S-MOS-LQO~fb~ and G-MOS-LQO~fb~ are calculated according to
the Model A objective predictor described in ETSI TS 103 281[50] on a per
sentence basis and averaged over all 16 sentences. The final results are
derived as follows:
\- S-MOS-LQO~fb~ = S-MOS-LQO~fb_modelA~
\- N-MOS-LQO~fb~ = 1.438*N-MOS-LQO~fb_modelA~ -- 1.959
\- G-MOS-LQO~fb~ = G-MOS-LQO~fb_modelA~
4) The measurement is repeated for each ambient noise condition described in
Table 2i.
5) The average of the results derived from all ambient noise types is
calculated.
NOTE: Recent investigations indicated an improved prediction performance when
combining both models A and B. The usage of model B according to ETSI TS 103
281 [50] is for further study, pending a commercially available
implementation.
### 9.12.2 Hand-held hands-free UE
For connections with hand-held hands-free UE, when using the simulation method
described in TS 103 224 [43], the measurement is conducted for 5 noise
conditions as described in Table 2i2. When using the ES 202 396-1 method, the
equivalent binaurally recorded noises described in Table 2i2, and available in
the source file directory of TS 103 224 [43], are used.

### 9.12.3 Electrical interface UE
The speech quality in sending for super-wideband systems is tested based on
ETSI TS 103 281 [50]. This test method leads to three MOS-LQO~fb~ quality
numbers:
\- N-MOS-LQO~fb~: Transmission quality of the background noise
\- S-MOS-LQO~fb~: Transmission quality of the speech
\- G-MOS-LQO~fb~: Overall transmission quality
For the measurement of electrial interface UE, pre-recorded noisy speech
signals according to Annex B of Recommendation ITU‑T P.381 [53] shall be used.
These noisy test sequences are available for the eight noise types described
in Table 2i and were captured at the electrical output of a representative
analogue headset. The corresponding speech level at MRP was calibrated to -1.7
dBPa, as described in clause 9.12.1. All test signals also include the proper
conditioning sequence described in ETSI TS 103 281 [50], which is applied to
the beginning of the 16-sentence test sequence.
Annex B of Recommendation ITU‑T P.381 [53] also provides a recording without
ambient noise and without Lombard correction (-4.7 dBPa at MRP). This silence
condition is needed for the calibration procedure described in clause 9.5 of
ETSI TS 103 281 [50].
1) The test arrangement is given in clause 5.1.6. For analogue interfaces, the
noisy test sequences according to Annex B of Recommendation ITU‑T P.381 [53]
shall be calibrated in a way that -26 dBov correspond to ‑60 dBV. For digital
interfaces, -26 dBov shall correspond to -16 dBm0.
2) Before starting the measurements, the calibration procedure described in
clause 9.5 of ETSI TS 103 281 [50] shall be performed with the electrical
interface UE. A recording in silence as per Annex B of Recommendation ITU‑T
P.381 [53] shall be used for the measurement.
3) The first noisy test sequence is inserted into electrical interface UE and
then recorded at the POI. Two signals are required for the prediction model:
\- The clean speech signal is used as the undisturbed reference (see ETSI TS
103 281 [50])
\- The send signal is recorded at the POI.
4) N-MOS-LQO~fb~, S-MOS-LQO~fb~ and G-MOS-LQO~fb~ are calculated according to
the Model A objective predictor described in ETSI TS 103 281[50] on a per
sentence basis and averaged over all 16 sentences. The final results are
derived as follows:
\- S-MOS-LQO~fb~ = S-MOS-LQO~fb_modelA~
\- N-MOS-LQO~fb~ = 1.438*N-MOS-LQO~fb_modelA~ -- 1.959
\- G-MOS-LQO~fb~ = G-MOS-LQO~fb_modelA~
5) The measurement is repeated for each ambient noise condition described in
Table 2i. For each of these noise types, a corresponding test signal is
available in Annex B of Recommendation ITU‑T P.381 [53].
6) The average of the results derived from all ambient noise types is
calculated.
## 9.13 Jitter buffer management behaviour (handset, headset and electrical
interface UE)
### 9.13.0 General
For MTSI-based speech-only with LTE, NR or WLAN access, a jitter buffer is
used in receiving to handle the variation in packet receiver timing. To
minimize the additional latency introduced by the jitter buffer, adaptation is
used to minimize delay while preventing packet losses due to packet delivery
timing variations. See clause 8 of TS 26.114 [39] for the definition of jitter
buffer and minimum performance requirements on JBM.
The test method is used to characterize different possible strategies and
trade-offs in the design of JBM implementations used in MTSI terminals.
### 9.13.1 Delay histogram
For this test it shall be ensured that the call is originated from the UE.
NOTE 1: Differences have been observed between UE originated calls and UE-
terminated calls. For better consistency, calls from UE are used.
The test signal consists of 3 repeats of the Composite Source Signal (CSS)
according to ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22] followed by a speech signal of
160s. During the first two CSS signals the terminal can adapt its jitter
buffer. The third CSS is used for measuring the delay in constant-delay
condition, and the speech signal is used for delay and quality measurement in
the packet impairment condition.
Constant delay T~c~ corresponding to the minimum delay of the profile (i.e.
the compensation value for the profile) shall be added at the beginning of the
different delay/loss profiles, to avoid unnecessary delay jumps between the
two measurement phases and realistic conditions for the second measurement
test phase. In receiving direction, the delay between the electrical access
point of the test equipment and the reference point (RP), T~TEAP-RP~(t) =
T~R-jitter~(t) + T~TER,~ is measured in two successive phases:
1) First the delay in constant-delay condition T~TEAP-DRP-constant~ is
measured as described in steps 1 to 4, clause 9.10.2/9.10.2a/9.10.2b, using
the third CSS signal. The constant delay T~c~ is subtracted from T~TEAP-RP~ to
obtain T~R-constant~.
2) Then the delay with packet impairment T~R-jitter~(t) is measured
continuously for a speech signal during the inclusion of packet delay and loss
profiles in the receiving direction RTP voice stream.
The reference point is defined as follows:
> \- for handset and headset UE, the reference point is the DRP.
>
> \- for electrical interface UE, the reference point is the input of the
> electrical reference interface.
Packet impairments shall be applied between the reference client and system
simulator eNodeB. Separate calls shall be established for each packet
impairment condition.
The start of the delay profiles must be synchronized with the start of the
downlink speech material reproduction (compensated by the delay between
reproduction and the point of impairment insertion, i.e. the delay of the
reference client) in order to ensure a repeatable application of impairments
to the test speech signal. Tests shall be performed with DTX enabled in the
reference client.
NOTE 2: RTP packet impairments representing packet delay variations and loss
are specified in Annex F. Care must be taken that the system simulator uses a
dedicated bearer with no buffering/scheduling of packets for transmission.
For the CSS signal repeated 3 times, the pseudo random noise (pn)-part of the
CSS has to be longer than the maximum expected delay. It is recommended to use
a pn sequence of 32 k samples (with 48 kHz sampling rate). The test signal
level is -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or the equivalent
analogue point.
For the speech signal, 8 English test sentences according to ITU-T P.501 Annex
C.2.3, normalized to an active speech level of -16dBm0, are used (2 male, 2
female speakers). The sequences are concatenated in such a way that all
sentences are centred within a 4.0s time window, which results in an overall
duration of 32.0s. The sequences are repeated 5 times, resulting in a test
file 160.0s long. The first 2 sentences are used for convergence of the UE
jitter buffer manager and are discarded from the analysis. Equivalent
implementations of the concatenation by repeating the test sentences in
sequence may be used.
For the delay calculation with the speech signal, a cross-correlation with a
rectangular window length of 4s, centered at each sentence of the stimulus
file, is used. The process is repeated for each sample. For each cross
correlation, the maximum of the envelope is obtained producing one delay value
per sentence.
The UE delay in the receive direction, T~R-jitter~(t), is obtained by
subtracting the delay introduced by the test equipment and the simulated
transport network packet delay introduced by the delay and loss profile (as
specified for the respective profile in Annex F) from the first electrical
event at the electrical access point of the test equipment to the first bit of
the corresponding speech frame at the system simulator antenna, T~TER~, from
the measured T~TEAP-DRP~(t).
The difference D~T~ between maximum receiving delay obtained with at least 5
individual calls (see clause 9.10.2) and the delay T~R-constant~ measured for
the CSS signal in constant delay condition is calculated. The quantity \"Call-
to-Call Variability Adjustment\" (CCVA) = max(0,D~T~) shall be added to the
obtained delay for the speech signal T~R-jitter~(t).
The UE delay in the receiving direction shall be reported in the form of an
histogram covering the range of measured CCVA-adjusted values (T~R-CCVA~(t) =
T~R-jitter~(t) + CCVA) with a step of 20 ms. The following pseudo code
provides an example implementation for the histogram:
> lo=min(floor(T~R-CCVA~(t=1...40)/20)*20)
>
> hi=max(ceil(T~R-CCVA~(t=1...40)/20)*20)
>
> [n,x]=hist(T~R-CCVA~(t=1...40),lo:20:hi)
>
> bar(x,n)
The T~R-CCVA~ values for all 40 sentences shall also be reported in the test
report.
NOTE 3: The synchronization of the speech frame processing in the UE to the
bits of the speech frames at the UE antenna may lead to a variability of up to
20 ms of the measured UE receive delay between different calls. This
synchronization is attributed to the UE receiving delay according to the
definition of the UE delay reference points. The effect of this possible call-
to-call variation is taken into account with the CCVA = max(0,D~T~) value.
### 9.13.2 Speech quality loss histogram
For the evaluation of speech quality loss in conditions with packet arrival
time variations and packet loss, the speech test signal described in clause
9.13.1 shall be used. Two 48 kHz recordings are used to produce the speech
quality loss metric:
\- A recording obtained in jitter and error free conditions with the test
signal described in clause 7.13.1 (reference condition)
\- A recording obtained during the application of packet arrival time
variations and packet loss as described in clause 9.13.1 (test condition)
The speech quality of the signal is estimated using the measurement algorithm
described in ITU-T Recommendation P.863 [44] in super-wideband mode. Level
pre-alignment to -26 dBov of recordings shall be used -- see P.863.1 clause
10.2 [45].
NOTE: For the analysis of acoustical measurements, ITU-T P.863 [44] assumes
diffuse-field equalized recordings. For this reason, signals at DRP are
diffuse-field corrected for testing handset and headset UE. For electrical
interface UE, only the level pre-alignment is applied
A score shall be computed for each 8s speech sentence pair. The MOS-LQO values
for the reference and test conditions shall be reported in the form of an
histogram covering the range of measured values with a step of 0.1 and the
values for all 20 sentences pairs shall also be reported in the test report.
The following pseudo code provides an example implementation for the
histogram:
> lo=min(floor(MOS-LQO _~test\ condition~_(i=1...20)/0.1)*0.1)
>
> hi=max(ceil(MOS-LQO _~test\ condition~_(i=1...20)/0.1)*0.1)
>
> [n,x]=hist(MOS-LQO _~test\ condition~_(i=1...20),lo:0.1:hi)
>
> bar(x,n)
The synchronization between stimuli and degraded condition shall be done by
the test system before applying the P.863 algorithm on each sentence pair.

factor of 6 dB instead of 11 dB. The PN-sequence is generated as described in
P.501 with W(k) constant within the frequency range 100-20000 Hz and zero
outside this range. The duration of the test signal is 250 ms. With an input
signal of ‑3 dBm0, the attenuation from input to output of the system
simulator shall be measured under the following conditions:
a) The handset or the headset, with the transmission circuit fully active,
shall be positioned on a hard plane surface with at least 400 mm free space in

headset UE
The attenuation from input to output shall be measured in the frequency range
from 100 Hz to 20 kHz. The spectral distribution of the output signal is
analysed with a 4k FFT (for a 48 kHz sample rate test system), thus the
measured part of the output signal is 85,333 ms. To avoid leakage effects the
frequency resolution of the FFT must be the same as the frequency spacing of
the PN-sequence.

###### ## Annex E (normative): Packet delay and loss profiles for UE delay
testing of MTSI-based speech with LTE access
# E.1 General
This Annex provides packet delay and loss profiles to be inserted on the IP
packets in the test system when testing the UE delay and speech quality for
MTSI-based speech with LTE access in jitter and error conditions. The profiles
are based on the assumption that one IP packet corresponds to 20ms of the
speech sequence. In order to preserve the synchronization of the elements in
the profile and the timing of the speech sequence (e.g. the RTP time stamp)
when the speech codec does not produce one packet every 20ms, e.g. during
speech codec DTX operation, the profiles needs to be sub-sampled in accordance
with the rate of production of the packets containg the speech frames.
The variation in the packet arrival time and the loss rate of the speech
packets experienced by the receiving UE in an LTE connection will vary
depending on several parameters and operating conditions of the LTE network.
Standardized characteristics with respect to Packet Delay Budget (PDB) and
Packet Error Loss Rate (PELR) for different QoS Class Identifiers (QCI) for an
LTE access network are defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 [42]:
\- The PDB of a QCI defines an upper bound for the time that a packet may be
delayed between the UE and the PCEF. For a certain QCI the value of the PDB is
the same in uplink and downlink. The purpose of the PDB is to support the
configuration of scheduling and link layer functions (e.g. the setting of
scheduling priority weights and HARQ target operating points). The PDB shall
be interpreted as a maximum delay with a confidence level of 98 percent.
\- The PELR of a QCI defines an upper bound for the rate of SDUs (e.g. IP
packets) that have been processed by the sender of a link layer protocol (e.g.
RLC in E‑UTRAN) but that are not successfully delivered by the corresponding
receiver to the upper layer (e.g. PDCP in E‑UTRAN). Thus, the PELR defines an
upper bound for a rate of non congestion related packet losses. The purpose of
the PELR is to allow for appropriate link layer protocol configurations (e.g.
RLC and HARQ in E‑UTRAN). For a certain QCI the value of the PELR is the same
in uplink and downlink.
The stipulated PDB and PELR as defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 for QCI1 intended for
Conversational Voice services results in that on each link 99 percent of the
packets will be successfully delivered over an LTE air interface with a
maximum delay of less than 80ms with a confidence level of 98 percent.
# E.2 Simulation model for generating packed delay and loss profiles
This clause describes a simulation model that generates packet arrival time
variations and packet loss experienced by the receiving UE for MTSI-based
speech with an end-to-end LTE access.
The model is derived solely for the purpose of testing the UE delay for MTSI-
based speech with LTE access. As discussed in Section E.1, several LTE network
parameters have a significant impact on the packet delay variations
experienced by the UE. This model includes the effect of the DRX cycle, the
BLER on the MAC/PHY layer, the HARQ re-transmission and RMC scheduler [46]. In
addition, jitter in the EPC and the effect of the mis-alignment of the DRX-
cycle between the uplink and downlink eNBs are included.
The model is described in Table E.1 and operates on the following input
parameters
\- Uplink and downlink block error rate (BLER), respectively.
\- Maximum number of HARQ re-transmissions on uplink and dowblink,
respectively.
\- DRX cycle length.
\- Time differnce between the uplink and the downlink eNB DRX cycle.
\- Maximum and minimum network delay between the uplink and the downlink eNB.
The random number generator used in the model produces pseudorandom values
drawn from the standard uniform distribution on the open interval (0, 1).
The model generates packet delay and loss profiles for two different test
system configurations of the UE delay:
\- When the system simulator is transparent in the downlink at the MAC/PHY
layer and does not operate in DRX. This approach requires the variations of
the delay due to downlink HARQ re-transmissions and mapping to the DRX cycle
to be simulated. In this case, the model simulates the delay and jitter
profiles for the packets from the antenna of the sending UE to the antenna
receiving UE (end-to-end simulation). This is the testing condition used in
3GPP TS 26.132.
\- When the system simulator is configured for error insertion in the downlink
at the MAC/PHY layer and DRX operation, and the system simulator implements
the HARQ re-transmissions and the mapping of the packets to the DRX cycle time
at the downlink. In this case, the model simulates the delay and loss profiles
from the sending UE up to the receiving eNB. This testing condition is
currently not used in 3GPP TS 26.132.
It should be noted that the model does not fully utilize the PDB for QCI1 as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.203 and does not include temporary variations of the
packet arrival time variation and the loss rate that may be experienced during
e.g. hand-over or congestion. Hence, the packet delay and loss profiles
generated by the model do not fully exercise the conditions that the jitter
buffer management of the UE may be exposed to in LTE systems and the profiles
generated by the model are only intended for the testing of the UE delay in
stationary operating conditions.

Three delay and loss profiles simulating the packet delay variations and
packet loss that a UE may experience in stationary operating conditions with
20ms, 40ms DRX and 40ms DRX with higher BLER, respectively, are generated from
the model with the parameter settings as described in Table E.2. The delay

###### ## Annex F (normative): Packet delay and loss profiles for jitter
buffer management behaviour
# F.1 General
This Annex provides packet delay and loss profiles to be inserted on the IP
packets in the test system when testing the UE delay and speech quality for
speech-only with LTE or WLAN access in jitter and error conditions, to
characterise the jitter buffer management behaviour. The profiles are based on
the assumption that one IP packet corresponds to 20ms of the speech sequence.
In order to preserve the synchronization of the elements in the profile and
the timing of the speech sequence (e.g. the RTP time stamp) when the speech
codec does not produce one packet every 20ms, e.g. during speech codec DTX
operation, the profiles needs to be sub-sampled in accordance with the rate of
production of the packets containg the speech frames.
# F.2 Packet delay and loss profiles

###### ## Annex G (informative): Transparency tests for electrical interface
UE via Bluetooth
# G.1 Introduction
Digital headsets that are connected via Bluetooth to electrical interface UE
may perform speech signal processing such as equalization, automatic gain
control, noise reduction and/or echo cancellation on its own. These types of
headsets are often equipped with higher signal processing capabilities and the
electrical interface UE should then deactivate its noise reduction and echo
cancellation functions to avoid possible tandem signal processing.
The tests described in the following clauses apply only for the electrical
interface UE of type Bluetooth. Their intention is to detect the
absence/presence of certain signal processing functionalities in the
electrical interface UE that are intended to be deactivated in case certain
flags and commands are signalled by the reference interface.
For Bluetooth connections, certain commands and flags are available in the
communication protocol stack of the hands-free profile. When a connection
between electrical interface UE and reference interface (see clause 5.1.6.2)
is established, the following two commands according to [57] shall be
configured accordingly by the reference interface:
1) AT+BRSF (Bluetooth Retrieve Supported Features): this command may be used
from the UE to discover signal processing capabilities of the connected
headset or reference interface. The answer to this request shall set bit 0 to
1, which indicates that the connected reference interface provides signal
processing capabilities.
2) AT+NREC=0 (Noise Reduction and Echo Canceling): this command shall be
executed from the reference interface to the electrical interface UE.
According to the Bluetooth specification [57], it is expected that the
electrical interface UE disables its own signal processing
# G.2 Presence of noise reduction
The intention of this test is to check whether a noise reduction of the
electrical interface UE is active or not when a Bluetooth headset or reference
interface connects with settings according to Clause G.1.
**Requirement:**
The noise reduction should not be active for electrical interface UE in this
case. The range of attenuation of the simulated background noise should be
less than 4 dB, when a simulated background noise is inserted at the send
input.
**Test Method:**
1) The test signal to be used for the measurement shall be pink noise of 20 s
duration and calibrated to the default level of -16 dBm0. The noise shall have
a bandwidth between 200 Hz to 3.6 kHz for narrowband and 100 Hz to 7 kHz for
wideband, super-wideband and fullband mode.
2) The electrical interface is setup as described in clause 5.1.6 and the test
signal is transmitted in send direction.
3) The transmitted signal is measured at the output of the system simulator
and is referred to the test signal as level versus time analysis according to
IEC 61672 [38], using an integration time of 250 ms. The result represents the
attenuation of the pink noise (simulated background noise) versus time.
> 4) The calculated attenuation vs time is corrected by the SJLR measured with
> the same connection parameters and as specified in clause 7.2.6 for
> narrowband, 8.2.6 for wideband, 9.2.6 for super-wideband or 10.2.6 for
> fullband mode.
NOTE: For super-wideband and fullband mode, the bandwidth of the test signal
is the same as in wideband, due to current limitations in the Bluetooth
connection regarding maximum audio bandwidth. An upper limit of 7 kHz of the
pink noise signal is sufficient to accurately evaluate the level analysis.
However, this limitation is expected to be resolved by super-wideband
capabilities in Bluetooth and the test method might be updated accordingly.
# G.3 Presence of echo cancellation
The intention of this test is to check whether an echo cancellation of the
electrical interface UE is active or not when a Bluetooth headset or reference
interface connects with settings according to Clause G.1.
**Requirement:**
Echo Cancellation should not be active for electrical interface UE in this
case. The echo loss measured should be 20 dB ± 2 dB when an artificial echo
path of 20 dB is introduced between receive and send path.
**Test method**
1) The compressed real speech signal as described in clause 7.3.3 of ITU-T
P.501 [33] shall be used as a test signal, which shall be band-limited
according to clause 5.4 and calibrated to a level of -10 dBm0.
2) The electrical interface is setup as described in clause 5.1.6 with enabled
echo path, and the test signal is transmitted in receive direction.
3) The first 17.0 s of the test signal (six sentences) are discarded from the
analysis to allow for convergence of the acoustic echo canceller (EC). The
analysis is performed over the remaining length of the test sequence (last six
sentences).
4) The analysis shall be conducted in 1/3-octave band intervals as given by
the R.10 series of preferred numbers in ISO 3 [54]. For the calculation, the
averaged measured echo level at each frequency band is referred to the
averaged test signal level measured in each frequency band.
5) The echo loss is calculated according to ITU-T Recommendation G.122 [8],
annex B, clause B.4 (trapezoidal rule). For narrowband mode, the default
frequency range from 300 Hz to 3 400 Hz is used. For wideband, super-wideband,
and fullband mode, the frequency range from 300 Hz to 6 700 Hz is used
instead.
6) The calculated echo loss is corrected by the sum of SJLR and RJLR measured
with the same connection parameters and as specified in clause 7.2.6 for
narrowband, 8.2.6 for wideband, 9.2.6 for super-wideband or 10.2.6 for
fullband mode.
###### ## Annex H (informative): Determination of ECRP for handset providing
non-traditional earpiece
# H.1 Overview
The ECRP for handset UEs providing an acoustic outlet is defined according to
Annex E.1 and E.2 of Recommendation ITU-T P.64 [18]. This positioning approach
cannot be used for handsets without a traditional ear cap. Instead, Annex E.3
of [18] can be used, which specifies ECRP of a handset device in terms of
distances from the upper edge (d~y~) and from a centre/symmetry line (d~z~).
With these definitions, a manufacturer-defined ECRP (MECRP) can be specified
for testing such devices.
However, in case MECRP is not available or not provided by the manufacturer,
the method described in the following allows at least a suitable and
reproducible positioning of a handset.
NOTE: Even though the method described in the following mimics user behaviour,
i.e., multiple typical positions, the determination of a custom ECRP may not
result in optimal performance. Whenever available, the use of MECRP is
preferred.
# H.2 Grid Positions
Several shifts of 1 cm in Z~e~ and Y~e~ direction according to Table H.1 are
evaluated around an initial and arbitrarily chosen ECRP at d~z~=0 mm and
d~y~=20 mm (according to definitions of Annex E.3 of [18]).

H.3 Measurement procedure
## H.3.1 Overview
The iterative procedure to determine ECRP and nominal volume applies for all
bandwidths and can be conducted in two different ways, as described in clause
H.3.2 and H.3.3. Both methods shall be supported by the test equipment. The
procedure in clause H.3.2 is recommended, the procedure in H.3.3 may be used
as an alternative. The procedure used for testing shall be reported.
## H.3.2 Evaluation of all shifts per volume setting
1) The handset terminal is setup as described in clause 5 and the volume
control is set to maximum. In case a manufacturer-defined nominal volume
control setting is provided, this setting shall be used.
2) The test signal to be used for the measurements shall be the British-
English single talk sequence described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22]. The
test signal level shall be -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or
the equivalent analogue point. Level calculation and bandwidth-specific pre-
filtering shall be applied according to clause 5.4 on the test signal.
3) Receive loudness rating (RLR) and receive frequency response (RFR) are
calculated from the same recording:
\- RFR is calculated according to clause 7.4.2 for narrowband, clause 8.4.2
for wideband, clause 9.4.2 for super-wideband and 10.4.2 for fullband.
\- RLR is calculated according to clause 7.2.2.2 for narrowband, clause
8.2.2.2 for wideband, clause 9.2.2.2 for super-wideband and 10.2.2.2 for
fullband.
4) The measurement shall be carried out for the initial ECRP shift (S0) and
for each mandatory shift according to Table H.1 (S1-S4). It is recommended to
consider the optional shifts (S5-S8) as well.
5) For the current volume control setting...
a) The repeated RFR measures at each frequency band are linearily averaged
across shifts, resulting in an average RFR spectrum.
b) The number of nominal RLR values (2 dB ± 3 dB) are counted.
6) If manufacturer-defined nominal volume control setting is provided:\ No
further iterations are required.\ \ If no manufacturer-defined nominal volume
control setting is provided:\ Steps 2) to 5) are repeated for volume control
decreased by one step until all RLR values obtained more than 5 dB across all
shifts.
7) The maximum number of valid RLR values is determined across all measured
volume control settings. Each volume setting providing this amount of valid
RLR values are considered for the next step of the analysis. If multiple
volume control settings obtain the same amount of nominal RLR values, all of
them are considered for the next analysis step.\ If nominal volume setting
cannot be achieved at any shift and volume setting (i.e., all RLR values are
either too high or too low), it is not possible to determine the ECRP with the
present method.
8) For each single shift providing the determined nominal volume setting, the
absolute difference (in dB) to the average RFR is calculated within the
bandwidth-dependent frequency range according to clause 5.4. The shift
providing nominal RLR and lowest difference to the average RFR (see step 4) is
considered as the ECRP for testing.
## H.3.3 Evaluation of all volume settings per shift:
It is also possible to apply the method in a transposed way, i.e., for each
shift, all volume steps are consecutively evaluated. The results obtained this
way are equivalent to the ones of the default order. However, due to the non-
applicable stop condition (see step 6), in some cases it might be necessary to
conduct more measurements than for the default order to obtain the same ECRP
result.
1) The handset terminal is setup as described in clause 5 and the volume
control is set to maximum. In case a manufacturer-defined nominal volume
control setting is provided, this setting shall be used. An arbitrary shift
according to Table H.1 is applied. It is recommended to start at the initial
ECRP shift S0.
2) The test signal to be used for the measurements shall be the British-
English single talk sequence described in ITU-T Recommendation P.501 [22]. The
test signal level shall be -16 dBm0 measured at the digital reference point or
the equivalent analogue point. Level calculation and bandwidth-specific pre-
filtering shall be applied according to clause 5.4 on the test signal.
3) Receive loudness rating (RLR) and receive frequency response (RFR) are
calculated from the same recording:
\- RFR is calculated according to clause 7.4.2 for narrowband, clause 8.4.2
for wideband, clause 9.4.2 for super-wideband and 10.4.2 for fullband.
\- RLR is calculated according to clause 7.2.2.2 for narrowband, clause
8.2.2.2 for wideband, clause 9.2.2.2 for super-wideband and 10.2.2.2 for
fullband.
4) If manufacturer-defined nominal volume control setting is provided:\ No
further iterations are required.\ \ If no manufacturer-defined nominal volume
control setting is provided:\ Steps 2) to 3) are repeated for volume control
decreased by one step until minimum volume setting is reached.
5) Steps 2) to 4) are repeated for each mandatory shift according to Table H.1
(S0-S4). It is recommended to consider the optional shifts (S5-S8) as well.
6) After RFR and RLR measurements are completed, the following calculations
are performed for each volume setting:
a) The repeated RFR measures at each frequency band are linearily averaged
across shifts, resulting in an average RFR spectrum.
b) The number of nominal RLR values (2 dB ± 3 dB) are counted.
7) The maximum number of valid RLR values is determined across all volume
control settings. Each volume setting providing this amount of valid RLR
values are considered for the next step of the analysis. If multiple volume
control settings obtain the same amount of nominal RLR values, all of them are
considered for the next analysis step.\ If nominal volume setting cannot be
achieved at any shift and volume setting (i.e., all RLR values are either too
high or too low), it is not possible to determine the ECRP with the present
method.
8) For each single shift providing the determined nominal volume setting, the
absolute difference (in dB) to the average RFR is calculated within the
bandwidth-dependent frequency range according to clause 5.4. The shift
providing nominal RLR and lowest difference to the average RFR (see step 4) is
considered as the ECRP for testing.
