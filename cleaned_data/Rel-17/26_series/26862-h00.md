# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP).
This Technical Report collects information related to enable "Immersive
Teleconferencing and Telepresence for Remote Terminals" (ITT4RT) in 3GPP MTSI.
ITT4RT is expected to enable scenarios with two-way audio and one-way
immersive video, e.g., a remote single user wearing an HMD participates in a
conference will send audio and optionally 2D video (e.g., of a presentation,
screen sharing and/or a capture of the user itself) but receives stereo or
immersive voice/audio and immersive video captured by an omnidirectional
camera in a conference room connected to a fixed network.
This Technical Report serves in addition to the specification in TS 26.114 or
TS 26.223 to capture a broader scope of technical solution for ITT4RT. One the
one hand this can present more details while keeping the TS documents lean and
on the other hand to serve as a basis for further work.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 Use Cases
## 4.1 Main ITT4RT Use Case
A group of colleagues is having a meeting in conference room A (see Figure 1).
The room consists of a conference table (for physically present participants),
a 360-degree camera[^1], and a view screen. Two of their colleagues, Bonnie
(B) and Clyde (C) are travelling and join the meeting through a conference
call.
â€¢ Participants in conference room A use the screen to display a shared
presentation and/or video streams coming from Bonnie and Clyde.
â€¢ Bonnie joins the conference from her home using a Head Mounted Display (HMD)
and a camera that captures her video. She has a 360-degree view of the
conference room.
â€¢ Clyde joins the conference from the airport using his mobile phone. He/she
also has a 360-degree view of the conference room on his mobile screen and
uses his mobile camera for capturing his own video.
Both Bonnie and Clyde can see the screen in the conference room as part of the
360-degree video. They also have the option to bring into focus any of the
incoming video streams (a presentation or the other remote participant's
camera feed) using their own display devices. The manner in which this focused
stream is displayed is a function of their display device and is not covered
in this use case.
Within the 3GPP MTSI TS 26.114 [7] and Telepresence TS 26.223 [8]
specifications, the above use case can be realized in two possible
configurations, which are explained below. The participants are referred to as
A, B and C from here onwards.
In the first scenario, shown in Figure 2.1, the call is set up without the
support of any media-aware network elements. Both remote participants, B and
C, send information about their viewport orientation to A, which in turn sends
them a viewport-dependent video stream from the omnidirectional camera.
{width="4.638888888888889in" height="3.9305555555555554in"}
Figure 4.1.1 - 360-degree conference call
In the second scenario, the call is setup using a network function, which may
be performed by either a Media Resource Function (MRF) [7] or a Media Control
Unit (MCU) [8]. In this case, the MRF/MCU receives a viewport-independent
stream from A. Both B and C, send viewport orientation information to the
MRF/MCU and receive viewport-dependent streams from it. Figure 4.1.1
illustrates the scenario. The A/V channel for conversational non-immersive
content also flows through the MRF/MCU in the figure.
{width="4.666666666666667in" height="2.9166666666666665in"}
Figure 4.1.2 - A 360-degree conference call via MRF/MCU
The use case aims to enable immersive experience for remote terminals joining
teleconferencing and telepresence sessions, with two-way audio and one-way
immersive video, e.g., a remote single user wearing an HMD participates to a
conference will send audio and optionally 2D video (e.g., of a presentation,
screen sharing and/or a capture of the user itself), but receives stereo or
immersive voice/audio and immersive video captured by an omnidirectional
camera in a conference room connected to a fixed network.
Private side communication is also expected to be enabled as part of this use
case. For instance, two users attending the conference may wish to talk
privately and do not want to be heard by others. In this case, the audio
information exchanged between these two users do not need to be transmitted to
others, and the content of their conversation may be protected and only be
fully rendered on their devices. Others may know that these users are
interacting but would not be able to hear the specific content.
A special variation of this use case is when the 360 camera capture occurs not
in a conference room but on a user device.
In the third scenario, multiple conference rooms are sending 360-degree video
to an MRF/MCU. The rooms may choose to receive 2D video streams from other
participants including one of the other rooms, which is displayed on the
screen in the room. A pictorial representation is shown in Figure 4.1.3.
{width="6.138888888888889in" height="3.6527777777777777in"}
Figure 4.1.3: Multiple rooms with 360-degree video
Furthermore,
> â€¢ The remote (single) users can choose to view any one or none (e.g., when
> only viewing the screenshare) of the available 360-degree videos from the
> multiple rooms. Switching from one room to another may be triggered
> manually, or using other mechanisms, such as, viewing direction or dominant
> speaker. However, for the case of the dominant speaker, it is important to
> consider effects of motion sickness while switching from one video to
> another as the user might not be sufficiently prepared for the switch.
>
> â€¢ The MRF/MCU may signal to pause the receiving 360-degree video from any of
> the rooms that do not currently have any active viewers. The streams can be
> resumed if and when there are viewers [9].
>
> â€¢ The presentation/screenshare stream is distributed to the single users and
> the rooms as a separate stream and can be identified using an explicit
> "a=content:slides" SDP field [7]. The single users may view the stream as an
> overlay on top of the 360-degree video.
>
> â€¢ If the area of interest in the 360-degree video is limited (the preferred
> FoV is defined and negotiated between the participants) or the motion
> outside the FoV is limited, the background area (outside the viewport) can
> be transmitted as a still image to maintain continuity in the 360-degree
> view. The still-image may be updated at regular intervals or as needed.
>
> â€¢ A still-image background area can also be used for placing overlays and
> avoiding unnecessary bandwidth utilization. In the scenario in the figure,
> this background area would be the wall with the screen and the presentation
> overlay may be placed on top of the screen for a better visual experience.
>
> â€¢ Overlays may also be used for other 2D streams. These include videos from
> the single users and 2D video streams from the other rooms. Spatial audio
> can be associated with overlays when placed in the 360-degree view, i.e.,
> the sound can appear to originate from the placement of the overlay, not
> necessarily associated with the elements within the video.
>
> â€¢ MRF/MCU based media processing may be used for creating 360-degree views
> combining multiple input sources, e.g., 360-degree video with limited FoV,
> still image for background, overlays of screenshare and other 2D videos,
> etc., when the device capabilities are limited.
## 4.2 Use Case Extension 1: Viewport sharing among remote participants
{width="5.0625in" height="4.041666666666667in"}
Figure 4.2.1 Viewport sharing between remote participants w/o MRF/MCU
Figure 4.2.1 illustrates viewport sharing capability added to the above use
case. When B is presenting to the conference or B is communicating with C, C
may be interested in B's focus or her 360-degree viewport, especially when B
is interacting with anything or anyone in room A. In such case, C would
request to follow B's viewport. Upon permission from B, C may follow B's
viewport on his own display device regardless of C's orientation. In this
scenario, room A may multicast (i.e., send the same information using unicast
to different receivers as in usual MTSI/Telepresence) viewport dependent
stream with embedded B's viewport metadata to both B and C. C's device will
follow embedded viewport metadata and playback the same viewport presented to
B.
{width="5.229166666666667in" height="5.1875in"}
Figure **4**.2.2 Viewport sharing between remote participants w/ MRF/MCU
Figure 4.2.2 shows the second scenario where the call is setup using a MRF or
MCU. The MRF/MCU may receive C's viewport sharing request and check B's
permission for such request. Once B's permission is confirmed, MRF/MCU may
forward the viewport dependent stream with B's viewport metadata embedded to
C. C's device will follow embedded viewport metadata and playback the same
viewport presented to B.
Viewport sharing feature may require capability of party A or MRF/MCU to
forward B's viewport-dependent video stream to C after request/response
signalling exchange, and embed B's viewport metadata into the stream.
## 4.3 Use Case Extension 2: Viewport-dependent stream for display device
Participants in conference room A may have their own display device (HMD, AR
glass or mobile phone) to receive a 360-degree video stream (viewport
independent or dependent stream) from room A, or conversational video from
remote participant B or C. For a large conferencing room, some participants
might not sit close to the view screen or other participants he or she would
like to communicate, a display device may offer high quality view of room A
regardless where the participant sits. A viewport-independent or viewport
dependent 360-video stream may send to participant's display device.
{width="5.0in" height="4.104166666666667in"}
Figure 4.3.1 Proposed viewport sharing use case w/o MRF/MCU
Figure 4.3.1 shows the first scenario, the call is setup without the support
of a MRF or MCU. B and C send viewing orientation information to A and receive
corresponding viewport-dependent streams from the omnidirectional camera. For
the participants with their own display device, the display device may receive
360-degree viewport-independent video from omnidirectional camera, or
viewport-dependent video stream by sending orientation information to A.
{width="4.951388888888889in" height="5.0625in"}
Figure 4.3.2 Proposed viewport sharing use case via MRF/MCU
Figure 4.3.2 shows a second scenario, the call is setup using a MEF or MCU. In
this case, the viewport dependent streaming may be handled by MRF or MCU. For
the participants with their own display device, the display device may receive
360-degree viewport-independent video from omnidirectional camera, or
viewport-dependent video by sending orientation information to MRF/MCU.
## 4.4 Use Case Extension 3: Viewport sharing for second display device
When a remote participant B or C is presenting or communicate to the room A,
participants in room A with their own display device may be interested in B or
C's focus or interaction on specific viewport of 360-degree video captured by
omnidirectional camera, these participants may request to follow B or C's
viewport and receive the same viewport-dependent stream sending to B or C.
{width="5.138888888888889in" height="4.326388888888889in"}
Figure 4.4.1 Viewport sharing to second display w/o MRF/MCU
Figure 4.4.1 shows the first scenario, the call is setup without MEF or MCU.
Participants in room A with their own display device may like to follow B's
viewport, participant sends the request to B and is authorized by B. The
viewport-dependent video for B is then played back on authorized participant
display device with embedded viewport information, the display device would
follow embedded viewport information to render the viewport regardless
participant's orientation.
{width="5.597222222222222in" height="5.25in"}
Figure 4.4.2 Proposed viewport sharing use case via MRF/MCU
Figure 4.4.2 shows a second scenario, the call is setup using a MEF or MCU. In
this case, the viewport sharing request may be handled by MRF or MCU, MRF or
MCU receive the request from participants and confirm the authorization from
B. MRF or MCU then sends viewport-dependent video streams with embedded B's
viewport metadata to B and her followers in room A.
## 4.5 Use Case Extension 4: Separate stream for presentation content
John (a participant in conference room A) shares his current computer screen
to present his work. This presentation audio/video stream is displayed in the
conference room A, but also broadcasted (i.e., sending the same information
using unicast to different receivers as in usual MTSI/Telepresence, same for
the two instances of \"broadcasted\" below in this subclause and in subclause
3.5) to all other remote participants (in other conference rooms and for the
VR users). While john is still presenting Alice (who is also in the conference
room A) adds her screen to be shared with supportive materials for John's
presentation, resulting into two streams being displayed in the room and
broadcasted to all other remote participants.
## 4.6 Use Case Extension 5: Applications to 3GPP FLUS
MTSI-based FLUS as defined in TS 26.238 [10] relies on the use of RTP/RTCP-
based protocols as defined in TS 26.114. Immersive video and immersive
audio/speech may be delivered uplink using MTSI-based FLUS. Thus, even though
FLUS is outside the scope of the current ITT4RT work item, the normative
specification resulting from the ITT4RT work item could be (and are not
required to be) reused in providing the immersive video and immersive
audio/speech support for MTSI-based FLUS including (i) recommendations of
audio and video codec configurations to deliver high quality VR experiences,
(ii) constraints on media elementary streams and RTP encapsulation formats,
(iii) recommendations of SDP configurations for negotiating of immersive video
and voice/audio capabilities and (iv) RTP/RTCP-based signalling for indication
of viewport information to enable viewport-dependent media processing and
delivery. In that regard, potential solutions described in clauses 6 and 9
could also be applicable for live uplink streaming scenarios using MTSI-based
FLUS.
For immersive video support over MTSI-based FLUS, both in-camera stitching and
network-based stitching can be considered. In case of camera stitching,
stitched immersive video is sent from the FLUS source (i.e., MTSI sender) to
the FLUS sink (e.g., MTSI receiver, which is either in the UE, e.g., as a
remote viewer, or in the network, e.g., as a media gateway). This is where
immersive video gets delivered uplink using MTSI-based FLUS, and the normative
specification output of ITT4RT becomes relevant. In case of network-based
stitching, different 2D captures are sent from the FLUS sources (MTSI senders)
to the FLUS sink (MTSI receiver as a media gateway) in the network and the
media gateway server performs decoding, stitching, and re-encoding to produce
the immersive video, which is then distributed to the remote viewers using
MTSI or other means. In this case, only 2D video gets delivered using MTSI-
based FLUS and immersive video is only delivered in the non-FLUS portion of
the link, i.e. downlink. If MTSI-based means are used to deliver the immersive
video to the remote viewers, only then the normative specification output of
ITT4RT could be applicable.
## 4.7 Use Case Extension 6: Multiple Overlays
### 4.7.1 Scenario 1
{width="5.722916666666666in" height="4.069444444444445in"}
Figure 4.7.1.1 Multiple Overlays - Scenario 1
A user is streaming an immersive video, from a teleconference room A. Room A
uses screen share to display two streams (overlay 1, overlay 2).
> â€¢ The sender needs to send information about the overlays such as number of
> overlays, layering, priority etc to the user via SDP offer.
>
> â€¢ The user based on its resource availability may decide if he/she wants to
> receive all the overlays or just a subset of overlays. This is conveyed back
> to the sender via SDP answer.
>
> â€¢ The sender needs to inform the user if he/she is allowed to use multiple
> overlays. It may be possible that sender might not want the receiver to
> stream multiple overlays to avoid possible distractions. One such scenario
> is when multiple overlay videos are available and the user may be allowed to
> stream just one of the overlays.
### 4.7.2 Scenario 2
{width="6.5in" height="4.122916666666667in"}
Figure 4.7.2.1 Multiple Overlays - Scenario 1
This scenario consists of multi-party teleconference. A user is streaming an
immersive video, from a teleconference room A. Room A uses screen share to
display one stream (overlay 1). The overlay from room B is not shared by A.
For the user to stream overlays which are not shared by A:
> â€¢ Firstly, the sender needs to inform the user if he/she is allowed to use
> multiple overlays as described in scenario 1.
>
> â€¢ Secondly, the sender of the 360-degree video may inform the user at the
> receiver if the user is allowed to use overlays from streams other than the
> ones shared by the sender. This is based on the content type of the overlays
> shared by A. The rationale behind the sender asserting control is that the
> sender might not want the receiver to mix overlays which may possibly cause
> a distraction to the user.
>
> â€¢ Thirdly, the sender may inform the user if he/she is allowed to overlap
> overlays. A possible example may be when the sender side is presenting and
> does not want other overlays to overlap with its presentation stream.
>
> â€¢ Lastly if the user's resource availability is limited, default preference
> maybe given to the sender's overlay as compared to streaming overlays from
> other sources.
## 4.8 Use Case Extension 7: Audio mixing of multiple streams in ITT4RT
### 4.8.1 Use Case
The assumptions are as the following:
> 1\. The sender's conference room has a 360 video with one audio stream (In
> reality, it may have multiple streams but for simplicity of the use case, we
> only consider one audio stream).
>
> 2\. The sender may have one or more overlays each of which may have its own
> audio stream.
>
> 3\. The receiver receives the audio stream from the sender's room as well as
> the audio streams from one or more overlays.
The above assumption is shown in the following figures:
{width="6.496527777777778in" height="3.8979166666666667in"}
Figure 4.8.1.1 - 360-degree conference call
Note that as is shown in the figure the overlay video has its own overlay
audio. Its audio either may be mixed at the sender with the room's audio and
sent as a single stream, or it needs to be delivered as a separate stream. If
it is mixed in the sender, the sender needs to decode the overlay's audio, mix
it with the room's audio and encode the mix again for transmission. If it is
sent as a separate stream, then it can be mixed with the room's audio at the
receiver. This contribution focuses on the audio mixing at the receiver.
The following use-cases are considered for audio mixing:
> â€¢ Case 1: Providing the recommended mixing gain at the receiver's end for
> rooms and overlay audios.
>
> â€¢ Case 2: Changing the recommended mixing gain by sender during a portion of
> the session to dominate the overlay audio (e.g. reducing the room's chatter
> when the overlay audio is important) or the room audio (e.g. when speaker in
> the room wants the remote audience focus on his speech)
# 5 Requirements
> â€¢ Multiple single-user participants are supported.
>
> â€¢ Communications between the single users can be conventional
> MTSI/Telepresence communications. MSMTSI could be used, and if that is used,
> then media data can be transmitted in separate media streams, and the layout
> of different participants is up to the client application/implementation.
>
> â€¢ One 360 camera per location in multi-party conference scenarios involving
> multiple physical locations are allowed.
>
> â€¢ Both in-camera stitching and network-based stitching are supported.
>
> o In case of camera stitching, stitched immersive video is sent from the
> conference room to the conferencing server (e.g., MSMTSI MRF or any other
> media gateway) and then from the conferencing server to the remote
> participants. If this is a one-to-one conversational session between the
> conferencing room and the remote participant, a media gateway in the middle
> might not be necessary.
>
> o In case of network-based stitching, different 2D captures are sent from
> the conference room to the conferencing server and the conferencing server
> performs decoding, stitching, and re-encoding to produce the immersive
> video, which is then distributed to the remote participants.
>
> â€¢ It is recommended that MTSI and IMS Telepresence endpoints support codec,
> protocol and transport capabilities relevant for encoding, delivery and

# 6 Architecture
## 6.1 General
The current MTSI service architecture depicted in Figure 4.1 of TS 26.114 [7]
is applicable for immersive teleconferencing. No further architectural gaps
are identified.
In terms of the reuse of existing MTSI functionality, the following may be
observed:
> 1- For in-camera stitching, stitched immersive video is sent from the
> conferencing room to the conferencing server (e.g., MSMTSI MRF) or directly
> to the remote participant (e.g., one-to-one conversation) in one or more RTP
> streams (e.g., established via SDP). Multiple RTP streams may be used in
> case tile or sub-picture based delivery optimization is in use.
>
> 2- For network-based stitching, multiple RTP streams are established (e.g.,
> via SDP, using MSMTSI) between the conferencing server and conference room,
> each of which carries a particular 2D capture. These RTP streams are then
> sent from the conference room to the conferencing server and the
> conferencing server performs decoding, stitching, and re-encoding to produce
> one or more RTP streams containing the immersive video, which are then
> distributed to the remote participants (e.g., again via MSMTSI). Multiple
> RTP streams may be used for the immersive video in case tile or sub-picture
> based delivery optimization is in use.
## 6.2 Potential architecture extensions
### 6.2.1 Network-based Media Processing
#### 6.2.1.1 Introduction
MPEG Network-based Media Processing (NBMP) in ISO/IEC 23090-8 [13] may be used
to establish media processing tasks for network-based stitching at MRF/MCU
sink to be performed on received media components from an ITT4RT-Tx client. In
particular, the NBMP Workflow Description Document for the 360-degree video
stitching workflow may be provided to the MRF/MCU, which would then use the
information during negotiation of the media streams to be used in the session
and subsequent media plane processing. In addition to 360-degree video
stitching, NBMP can also be used for initiating other media processing
workflows in MRF/MCU such as guided transcoding, overlaying on image or video
backgrounds or viewport-dependent content customization.
#### 6.2.1.2 Example Architecture
An example architecture for establishing an NBMP workflow for ITT4RT is shown
in Figure 6.2.1.1. In this case the NBMP client resides in the AS, and is
responsible for providing the NBMP workflow description to the MRF, which
contains the NBMP workflow manager. The MRF would establish the necessary
media flows for accessing the media from the ITT4RT-Tx client (NBMP media
source). The required tasks (e.g. stitching, VDP etc. ) can be set up in the
MRF before delivering the processed media to the ITT4RT-Rx client (NBMP media
sink). The establishment of media flows, e.g., unstitched video from an
ITT4RT-Tx client, viewport-dependent 360-degree video to an ITT4RT-Rx client,
is done in accordance with MTSI specification by the MRF. The AS is aware of
the capabilities and address of the MRF. Further details on workflow
description document exchange is considered out-of-scope of this document. If
further normative work is needed for Mr,Cr interface between the AS and MRF to
support NBMP is left FFS.

# 7 Potential Solutions
## 7.1 Frame packing of overlays
Frame packing can be used when delivering overlays as a single RTP stream. The
overlay source with frame packed overlays can be:
> 1\. an RTP stream with an overlay source frame packed with a 360-degree
> video or with another overlay such that it is decodable by a single decoder.
>
> 2\. an RTP stream with one or more overlay sources; frame packing is used
> for more than one overlay source.
Overlays frame-packed with 360-degree video or with other overlay streams
require a single decoder, whereas overlay video that is encoded and delivered
separately from the 360-degree video and other overlay streams requires
multiple decoders and may require synchronization, depending on the use case.
However, having a separate overlay stream allows more freedom to use a higher
resolution for the overlay. Furthermore, packing the overlay as part of the
360-degree video would also affect the resolution of the 360-degree content.
### 7.1.1 SDP Signalling and Examples
Frame packed stream may be described with the following attribute included in
the packed stream's media description:
a=itt4rt_framepacking: \ \ \ .... \
The list of ids is an identifier for the source media packed in the stream. If
the attribute is omitted in the response, the stream consists of only the
source identified by the first identifier. The ids are the mid values in the
media description of the individually encoded media streams of the same media
source. The parameter PPC is a binary value that defines the packed picture
content:
Table 7.1.1.1: PPC parameter
PPC (Binary Value) Packed Streams
* * *
001b Only overlay 010b Only 360-degree content 011b 360-degree content +
overlay
The attribute itt4rt_framepacking may be used for identifying packed overlays
even when individually encoded streams are not offered for those overlays. In
this case the ids will not be the mid values, but the overlay_id described in
the 3gpp_overlay attribute. The ids would appear in the order they appear in
the RHE so that each can be associated with the packed stream.
In the following example in Figure 7.1.1.1, an overlay is offered as an
individual stream with the mid B. The same overlay is also offered as frame
packed with the 360-degree video with mid A as indicated by the
itt4rt_framepacking attribute.

An alternative answer is shown below in Figure 7.1.1.3, in which the overlay

itt4rt_framepacking attribute is removed from the 360-degree video media
description so the overlay is not frame packed.

### 7.1.2 Bitstream Signalling
NOTE: Whether RTP header extensions provide a feasible method for bitstream
signalling or if a different mechanism can be used for this purpose is FFS.
The RWP SEI message may be used to carry the packing information. However, it
does not define the role of the packed regions i.e., 360-degree video and
overlay, nor does it indicate the layering order. Therefore, an RTP header
extension (RHE) can be considered for carrying the packing information (packed
and projected regions), layering order and type of stream (overlay/360-degree
video).
The packed frame can be delivered with RTP header extension as shown in Figure
7.1.2.1 (this example shows two packed regions: one overlay region and one
360-degree video):

Figure 7.1.2.1: Potential RTP Header extension for frame-packed overlays
Projected_Region_Width (or Pkd_RegWid), Projected_Region_Height (or
Pkd_Rg_Ht), Projected_Region_Top and Projected_Region_Left are the width,
height, top offset and left offset, respectively, of the projected region.
Packed_Region_Width, Packed_Region_Height, Packed_Region_Top and
Packed_Region_Left are the width, height, top offset and left offset of the
packed region.
The 8-bit ID is the local identifier as defined in [7]. The length field
defines that 54 bytes follow (in this example). The field N_Regions gives the
total number of packed regions (n), which is 2. The value QR is the index of
the packed region that follows in this extension header. The index of the
picture (QR) is assigned based on quality, with the highest quality picture
always being the first (0) and lowest one being the last (n-1). The LYR field
provides the layer of the packed region. This is the same as the layering
order defined for OMAF. In case of one 360-degree video and one overlay, the N
regions will be two, with LYR = 0 for background and LYR = 1 for overlay. The
TT field provides the transform type which is one of the following:
0: no transform
1: mirroring horizontally
2: rotation by 180 degrees (counter-clockwise)
3: rotation by 180 degrees (counter-clockwise) before mirroring horizontally
4: rotation by 90 degrees (counter-clockwise) before mirroring horizontally
5: rotation by 90 degrees (counter-clockwise)
6: rotation by 270 degrees (counter-clockwise) before mirroring horizontally
7: rotation by 270 degrees (counter-clockwise)
In case of more than one layer, the layers are included in ascending order
with the lowest layer described first. If more than one region belongs to a
single layer, the multiple regions for the same layer occur consecutively in
ascending order of the QR value.
## 7.2 Conditional overlays
### 7.2.1 Introduction
According to the MPEG OMAF specification SC29WG11_N19435, a sender may have a
recommended viewport (as defined in section 7.14.3.1) as an area of interest
to be displayed as an overlay. The overlay can be treated as conditional by
the receiver and displayed only when the area is not within the viewport, as
defined in Section G.5, in this case using a sender specified "condition".
In ITT4RT, the same concept can be used to receive an overlay only when a
certain condition is met. The region can be defined by the receiver UE instead
of the sender's recommended viewport as in the case of OMAF to cater to the
conversational and real-time aspects.
A conditional overlay is defined as an overlay that is activated (i.e.,
transmitted by the sender) as an overlay media stream when a certain condition
is met, and deactivated when the condition is no longer met. RTP stream of an
overlay can be activated or paused by an ITT4RT-Rx client using pause/resume
as specified in TS 26.114 for this purpose.
The following solution may be of relevance when overlays are frame packed with
other media or if the ITT4RT-Rx client wants the control of the overlay
activation/deactivation to be at the ITT4RT-Tx client.
In this case, the capability is advertised by the ITT4RT-Tx client to the
ITT4RT-Rx clients using SIP/SDP. Possible use cases where a conditional
overlay may be employed (the overlay activation condition is described in
italic):
> â€¢ displaying a region of interest of the 360-degree video when the viewport
> is not overlapping with that region of interest. The capability may be used
> for extending the FoV for _devices when two areas of interest do not fit
> within the FoV of the device._
### 7.2.2 Potential solution using RTCP
A solution for the use of conditional overlays is described below.
> â€¢ The ITT4RT-Tx client indicates the capability to support conditional
> overlays using the SDP field a=rtcp-fb:* 3gpp-conditional-overlay. The field
> indicates that the ITT4RT-Tx client is capable of receiving RTCP feedback
> messages from the ITT4RT-Rx client indicating the region for enabling a
> conditional overlay.
>
> â€¢ The ITT4RT-Rx client indicates in an RTCP conditional overlay feedback
> packet the region of the sphere it wishes to receive as a conditional
> overlay, along with the condition associated with it. The RTCP feedback has
> the following fields:
>
> o Conditional_overlay id
>
> o Azimuth of the center of the sphere region with respect to the origin of
> the omnidirectional content coordinate system. The unit is expressed in
> degrees in the range of [0, 360].
>
> o Elevation of the centre of the sphere region with respect to the origin of
> the omnidirectional content coordinate system. The unit is expressed in
> degrees in the range of [0, 180].
>
> o Azimuth range specifies the azimuth range of the conditional overlay
> through the center point of the sphere region. The unit is expressed in
> degrees in the range of [0, 360].
>
> o Elevation range specifies the elevation range of the conditional overlay
> through the center point of the sphere region. The unit is expressed in
> degrees in the range of [0, 180].
>
> o The condition for activating the conditional overlay defined as the
> maximum ratio of overlap between the conditional region defined above and
> the viewport for it to be activated. For example, if the value is 0; this
> implies that if the ratio of the portion of the conditional overlay region
> covered by the viewport to the size of the conditional overlay is 0, then
> the overlay is activated (no overlap).
>
> â€¢ The ITT4RT-Tx client will deliver the indicated region as an overlay
> stream to the ITT4RT-Rx client when the condition is met. An RTP header
> extension can be used to indicate the actual region that is transmitted as
> overlay to the ITT4RT-Rx client depending on sender limitations. The support
> for this extension is indicated in the SDP using a=extmap:7 urn:3gpp:cond-
> overlay-sent.
>
> â€¢ The ITT4RT-Rx client may cancel conditional overlays by sending a
> cancellation RTCP conditional overlay message with a list of the appropriate
> conditional overlay ids.
An example condition may be:
> â€¢ Condition: 0.5. Upon receiving this RTCP message, the ITT4RT-Tx client
> will respond by activating the overlay if the overlap of the conditional
> region and the viewport is between 0 and 50% at any time until the
> conditional overlay is either cancelled or the session ends.
### 7.2.3 Potential solution using SDP
An ITT4RT-Tx client may, in its SDP offer, indicate the capability to support
conditional overlays for a particular 360 video using the attribute
a=3gpp_conditional_overlay. The ITT4RT-Rx client includes the same attribute
in the SDP answer to show it also supports conditional overlay.
Once the media stream is established, the ITT4RT-Rx client may select a region
of interest it wants to receive as an overlay. It can then signal to the
ITT4RT-Tx client using the SDP offer of the same 360-degree video but
indicating within the request:
a = 3gpp_conditional_overlay:\
The parameters azimuth, azimuth_range, elevation, elevation_range and
condition are the same as previously defined for the RTCP solution. An example
for a conditional overlay request is : a = 3gpp_conditional_overlay: 0, 90, 0,
45, 0.5; requesting an overlay of the region centered at the global center 0,0
with the dimensions 90 degrees horizontally and 45 degrees vertically, which
is transmitted whenever the overlap is between 0 and 50%.
