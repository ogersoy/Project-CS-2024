# 4 General
The EVS coder provides enhanced AMR-WB backward compatible operation over all
nine source bit rates from 6.6 kbit/s to 23,85 kbit/s, including AMR-WB
backward compatible DTX operation. This backward compatible operation is
referred to AMR-WB interoperable (AMR-WB IO).
Frames generated by an EVS AMR-WB IO encoder can be decoded by an AMR-WB
decoder, without the need for transcoding. Correspondingly, frames generated
by an AMR-WB encoder can be decoded by an EVS AMR-WB IO decoder, without the
need for transcoding.
In addition to encoder and decoder enhancements, the AMR-WB backward
compatible functions in the EVS coder provide the following extra
functionalities compared to the AMR-WB coder specified in [11] to [17] and
[20]:
\- Support of input and output sampling frequencies other than 16 kHz (i.e. 8,
32, 48 kHz)
\- Inclusion of jitter buffer management for AMR-WB backward compatible
functions
\- Switching between AMR-WB IO bit rates and primary EVS bit rates at any 20
ms speech frame boundary
The present document is mandatory for implementation in all network entities
and UEs supporting the EVS codec.
In the case of discrepancy between the EVS codec backward compatible functions
described in the present document and its ANSI-C code specification contained
in [3] the procedure defined by [3] prevails. In the case of discrepancy
between the procedure described in the present document and its ANSI-C code
specification contained in [4] the procedure defined by [4] prevails. In the
case of discrepancy between the procedure described in the present document
and its ANSI-C code specification contained in [22] the procedure defined by
[22] prevails.
