In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 Procedures for Data Collection and Reporting
## 4.1 General
This clause specifies the stage 3 procedures for data collection and
reporting.
## 4.2 Network-side procedures
### 4.2.1 General
This clause specifies the procedures used between network-side entities for UE
data collection and reporting, along with related functionality pertaining to
the provisioning, management, and delivery of such data between the Data
Collection AF and consumer entities.
### 4.2.2 Data Collection AF registration with NRF
This clause specifies the use of the _Nnrf_NFManagement_ service API as
defined in TS 29.510 [7] and invoked by a Data Collection AF instance to
register its profile with the NRF in order to enable the discovery of the Data
Collection AF by consumer entities.
### 4.2.3 Data collection and reporting provisioning
#### 4.2.3.1 General
An Application Service Provider, via its Provisioing AF, may use the
procedures in this clause to supply data collection and reporting provisioning
information, as defined in clause 4.2 of TS 26.531 [7], to the Data Collection
AF via reference point R1 in the form of Data Reporting Configuration
resources. A given Data Reporting Configuration comprises instructions and
other information to be followed/used by data collection clients in their
collection, processing and reporting to the Data Collection AF of UE data for
the associated application service. In addition, a Data Reporting
Configuration instance may contain data exposure restrictions for use by the
Data Collection AF in controlling access by consumers to event data pertaining
to the UE data that it has collected.
The provisioning process begins with the Provisioning AF using the procedures
defined in clause 4.2.3.2 to create a Provisioning Session resource as an
umbrella for subsequent Data Reporting Configuration resources.
The process then proceeds with the Provisioning AF using the procedures
defined in clause 4.2.3.3 to provide the Data Collection AF with one or more
Data Reporting Configuration resources. Each set of provisioning information
pertains to one application, identified by its External Application
Identifier, and one type of exposed event, uniquely identified in the 5G
System by its Event ID, as defined in clause 4.15.1 of TS 23.502 [3].
#### 4.2.3.2 Provisioning Session procedures
##### 4.2.3.2.1 General
Prior to provisioning of data collection and reporting , the Provisioning AF
shall create a new Provisioning Session. The following CRUD operations are
used to manage Provisioning Session resources. Additional details are provided
under clause 6.
##### 4.2.3.2.2 Create Provisioning Session
This procedure shall be used by the Provisioning AF to create a new
Provisioning Session. The HTTP POST method shall be used for this purpose.
Upon successful creation, the Data Collection AF shall respond with a _201
(Created)_ response message that includes the resource identifier of the newly
created Provisioning Session in the body of the reply, and along with the URL
of the resource, including its resource identifier, shall be returned as part
of the HTTP Location header field.
##### 4.2.3.2.3 Retrieve Provisioning Session properties
This procedure is used by the Provisioning AF to obtain the properties of an
existing Provisioning Session from the Data Collection AF. The HTTP GET method
shall be used for this purpose.
##### 4.2.3.2.4 Update Provisioning Session properties
The Update operation is not allowed on Provisioning Session resources.
##### 4.2.3.2.5 Destroy Provisioning Session
This procedure is used by the Provisioning AF to destroy a Provisioning
Session. The Data Collection AF shall use the HTTP DELETE method for this
purpose.
As a side-effect of destroying a Provisioning Session, the Data Collection AF
shall release any associated resources, purge any cached data, and delete all
UE data reporting configurations associated with this Provisioning Session.
#### 4.2.3.3 Data Reporting Configuration procedures
##### 4.2.3.3.1 General
Upon the successful creation of a Provisioning Session, the Provisioning AF
shall use the procedures defined in this clause to configure UE data
collection and reporting functionality specific to an application in the Data
Collection AF. This clause defines the basic procedures. Additional details
are provided under clause 6.3.
##### 4.2.3.3.2 Data Reporting Configuration entity
A given instance of a Data Reporting Configuration resource is identified by
the _dataReportingConfigurationId_ property of the
_DataReportingConfiguration_ resource, and applies to one type of data
collection client. The properties of this resource, as defined in the
following clauses, pertain to UE data collection and reporting by different
data collection clients to the Data Collection AF, and control of access by
different consumer entities to event data exposed by the Data Collection AF.
The type of a Data Reporting Configuration resource is identified by the
_dataCollectionClientType_ property of the _DataReportingConfiguration_
resource as specified in clause 6.3.2.2.
NOTE 1: The _dataCollectionClientType_ property corresponds to the _Data
collection client type_ parameter in table 4.6.2-1 of TS 26.531 [7].
The Data Reporting Configuration resource shall include one or more sets of
instructions for data collection clients on the collection and reporting of UE
data to the Data Collection AF, and may contain one or more sets of data
exposure restrictions, expressed as Data Access Profiles (see clause 6.3.2.3),
each one determining the level of access by event consumer entities to the
event-related UE data reported to the Data Collection AF. A Data Access
Profile defines the granularity of access to a particular subset of collected
event data parameters for the Event ID of concern. This granularity is
expressed as a set of data aggregation functions along the time, user, and
location dimensions. The subset of parameters to be exposed is identified
using a controlled vocabulary specific to the Event ID. An authorization
procedure is in place to determine which Data Access Profile is granted to a
particular event consumer entity.
NOTE 2: The process of matching event consumers to Data Access Profiles is
implementation-specific and therefore beyond the scope of the present
document.
##### 4.2.3.3.3 Create Data Reporting Configuration
This procedure is used by the Provisioning AF to create a Data Reporting
Configuration resource within the scope of a particular Provisioning Session.
The HTTP POST method shall be used for this purpose and the request message
body may include a _DataReportingConfiguration_ resource, as specified under
clause 6.3.2.2.
Upon success, the Data Collection AF shall respond with a _201 (Created)_
response message and the resource URL for the newly-created Data Reporting
Configuration resource shall be returned in the Location header field.
If the procedure is unsuccessful, the Data Collection AF shall provide an
error response status code as defined in clause 5.3.3.
This procedure may be performed multiple times to provision different Data
Reporting Configurations in the scope of a particular Provisioning Session.
##### 4.2.3.3.4 Retrieve Data Reporting Configuration
This procedure is used by the Provisioning AF to obtain the properties of an
existing Data Reporting Configuration resource from the Data Collection AF.
The HTTP GET method shall be used for this purpose.
If successful, the Data Collection AF shall respond with a _200 (OK)_ and the
requested _DataReportingConfiguration_ resource shall be returned in the body
of the HTTP response message.
If the procedure is unsuccessful, the Data Collection AF shall provide an
error response status code as defined in clause 5.3.3.
##### 4.2.3.3.5 Update Data Reporting Configuration
The update operation is invoked by the Provisioning AF to initially upload the
representation of a Data Reporting Configuration resource created using the
procedure in clause 4.2.3.3.3 or, in the case of an existing Data Reporting
Configuration resource, to entirely replace or modify certain properties of
that resource. All available properties may be updated. The HTTP PATCH or HTTP
PUT methods shall be used for the update operation.
If the procedure is successful, the Data Collection AF shall respond with a
_200 (OK)_ reflecting the successful update operation.
If the procedure is unsuccessful, the Data Collection AF shall provide a
response code as defined in clause 5.3.3.
##### 4.2.3.3.6 Destroy Data Reporting Configuration
This operation is used by the Provisioning AF to destroy a Data Reporting
Configuration resource and to terminate the related UE data reporting
procedure. The HTTP DELETE method shall be used for this purpose.
As a result, the Data Collection AF should release any associated resources,
deliver any pending data to subscribed recipients, as appropriate to the Event
ID in question, and delete any corresponding configurations.
If the procedure is successful, the Data Collection AF shall respond with a
_200 (OK)_ response message.
If the procedure is unsuccessful, the Data Collection AF shall provide an
error response status code as defined in clause 5.3.3.
### 4.2.4 Configuration of Indirect Data Collection Client
#### 4.2.4.1 General
Indirect reporting operation involves first a UE Application instance sending
domain-specific UE data to an Application Service Provider (ASP) server
instance across reference point R8. That UE data is passed from to an Indirect
Data Reporting Client function operated by the Application Service Provider to
be subsequently sent as data reports, possibly in processed form, to a Data
Collection AF instance. Operation of the latter procedure is conditioned upon
the Indirect Data Collection Client having acquired its data collection and
reporting configuration from the Data Collection AF by means of the
_Ndcaf_DataReporting_ service (either directly across the reference point R3
or via an equivalent service exposed by the NEF, depending on whether the
Indirect Data Collection Client and the Data Collection AF reside in the same
or separate trust domains).
The Indirect Data Collection Client shall obtain its configuration by invoking
the _Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession_ service operation, as described under
clause 7.2,2,3.1.
The configuration information is contained in a generic data collection and
reporting configuration envelope that shall include at minimum the baseline
configuration parameters defined in clause 4.6.3 of TS 26.531 [7]. In
particular, the configuration shall specify the domain-specific parameters
associated with the specified Event ID(s) to be reported to the Data
Collection AF.
#### 4.2.4.2 Indirect Data Collection Client retrieves its initial
configuration by creating a Data Reporting Session
The call flow in figure 4.2.4.2â€‘1 shows the interaction between the Indirect
Data Collection Client and the Data Collection AF at the initial configuration
of the Indirect Data Collection Client.
**Figure 4.2.4.2-1: Initial configuration of Indirect Data Collection Client**
The steps in this procedure are as follows:
> 1\. The Indirect Data Collection Client invokes the
> _Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession_ service operation by sending an HTTP
> POST request to the Data Collection AF (see clauses 7.2.2.2 and 7.2.2.3.1).
> A _DataReportingSession_ resource entity (see clause 7.3.2.1) is included in
> the request message body, but only properties _externalApplicationId_ and
> _supportedDomains_ are present (because the other properties are unknown to
> the Indirect Data Collection Client).
>
> 2\. In its _201 Created_ response, the Data Collection AF provides a
> _DataReportingSession_ resource entity in the message body, which expands
> the content of the request message body in step 1 by adding the properties
> _sessionId_ , _validUntil_ , _reportForDomains_ and _reportingCondition_.
> The _validUntil_ property of the provided _DataReportingSession_ should be a
> time in the future.
The Indirect Data Collection Client is now configured.
#### 4.2.4.3 Updating and renewing data collection and reporting configuration
##### 4.2.4.3.1 Introduction
The data collection and reporting configuration may change as a result of
subscriptions to events exposed by the Data Collection AF, for example, as a
result of narrower or wider filters applied to an event subscription. There
are two ways for a modified data collection and reporting configuration to be
acquired by the Indirect Data Collection Client:
1\. The Indirect Data Collection Client invokes the
_Ndcaf_DataReporting_RetrieveSession_ service operation (see clause
4.2.4.3.2).
2\. The Data Collection AF supplies a _DataReportingSession_ in response to a
data report submitted by the Indirect Data Collection Client (see clause
4.2.4.3.3).
##### 4.2.4.3.2 Indirect Data Collection Client retrieves up-to-date
configuration
This operation is typically performed when the _validUntil_ property of the
current _DataReportingSession_ stored in the Indirect Data Collection Client
is about to expire.

**Figure 4.2.4.3.2-1: Indirect Data Collection Client retrieves up-to-date
DataReportingSession**
The steps in this procedure are as follows:
> 1\. The Indirect Data Collection Client requests the _DataReportingSession_
> for the current session by using the _Ndcaf_DataReporting _RetrieveSession_
> service operation (see clauses 7.2.3.2 and 7.2.3.3.1).
>
> 2\. The Data Collection AF provides the latest _DataReportingSession_ in the
> message body of a _200 OK_ response. The _validUntil_ property of the
> provided _DataReportingSession_ should be a time in the future. In addition,
> the Data Collection AF may change properties _reportForDomains_ and
> _reportingCondition_.
##### 4.2.4.3.3 DataReportingSession updated in response to data reporting
See clause 4.2.6.
#### 4.2.4.4 Indirect Data Collection Client destroys Data Reporting Session
The Indirect Data Collection Client may destroy a Data Reporting Session and
the data collection and reporting configuration it represents by invoking the
_Ndcaf_DataReporting_DestroySession_ service operation.
**Figure 4.2.4.4-1: Indirect Data Collection Client destroys
DataReportingSession**
The steps in this procedure are as follows:
> 1\. The Indirect Data Collection Client invokes the
> _Ndcaf_DataReporting_DestroySession_ service operation by sending an HTTP
> DELETE request to the Data Collection AF (see clauses 7.2.3.2 and
> 7.2.3.3.3).
>
> 2\. The Data Collection AF acknowledges the destruction of the session and
> its configuration with a _204 No Content_ response.
### 4.2.5 Configuration of Application Server
#### 4.2.5.1 General
An Application Server (AS) instance, as a type of data collection client,
acquires its domain-specific data collection and reporting configuration from
a Data Collection AF instance by means of the _Ndcaf_DataReporting_ service
(either directly across reference point R4 or via an equivalent service
exposed by the NEF, depending on whether the AS and the Data Collection AF
reside in the same or separate trust domains).
Similar to clause 4.2.4, the AS shall obtain its configuration by invoking the
_Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession_ service operation, as described under
clause 7.2.2.3.1.
The configuration information is contained in a generic data collection and
reporting configuration envelope that shall include at minimum the baseline
configuration parameters defined in clause 4.6.3 of TS 26.531 [7]. The
configuration shall specify the domain-specific parameters associated with the
specified Event ID(s) to be reported to the Data Collection AF.
#### 4.2.5.2 Application Server retrieves its initial configuration by
creating a Data Reporting Session
The call flow in figure 4.2.5.2â€‘1 shows the interaction between the
Application Server and the Data Collection AF at the initial configuration of
the Application Server.
**Figure 4.2.5.2-1: Initial configuration of Application Server**
The steps in this procedure are as follows:
> 1\. The Application Server invokes the _Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession_
> service operation by sending an HTTP POST request to the Data Collection AF
> (see clauses 7.2.2.2 and 7.2.2.3.1). A _DataReportingSession_ resource
> entity (see clause 7.3.2.1) is included in the request message body, but
> only properties _externalApplicationId_ and _supportedDomains_ are present
> (because the other properties are unknown to the Application Server).
>
> 2\. In its _201 Created_ response, the Data Collection AF provides a
> _DataReportingSession_ resource entity in the message body, which expands
> the content of the request message body in step 1 by adding the properties
> _sessionId_ , _validUntil_ , _reportForDomains_ and _reportingCondition_.
> The _validUntil_ property of the provided _DataReportingSession_ should be a
> time in the future.
The Application Server is now configured.
#### 4.2.5.3 Updating and renewing data collection and reporting configuration
##### 4.2.5.3.1 Introduction
The data collection and reporting configuration may change as a result of
subscriptions to events exposed by the Data Collection AF, for example, as a
result of narrower or wider filters applied to an event subscription. There
are two ways for a modified data collection and reporting configuration to be
acquired by the Application Server:
1\. The Application Server invokes the _Ndcaf_DataReporting_RetrieveSession_
service operation (see clause 4.2.5.3.2).
2\. The Data Collection AF supplies a _DataReportingSession_ in response to a
data report submitted by the Application Server (see clause 4.2.5.3.3).
##### 4.2.5.3.2 Application Server retrieves up-to-date configuration
This operation is typically performed when the _validUntil_ property of the
current _DataReportingSession_ stored in the Application Server is about to
expire.
**Figure 4.2.5.3.2-1: Application Server retrieves up-to-date
DataReportingSession**
The steps in this procedure are as follows:
> 1\. The Application Server requests the _DataReportingSession_ for the
> current session by using the _Ndcaf_DataReporting _RetrieveSession_ service
> operation (see clauses 7.2.3.2 and 7.2.3.3.1).
>
> 2\. The Data Collection AF provides the latest _DataReportingSession_ in the
> message body of a _200 OK_ response. The _validUntil_ property of the
> provided _DataReportingSession_ should be a time in the future. In addition,
> the Data Collection AF may change properties _reportForDomains_ and
> _reportingCondition_.
##### 4.2.5.3.3 DataReportingSession updated in response to data reporting
See clause 4.2.7.
#### 4.2.5.4 Application Server destroys Data Reporting Session
The Application Server may destroy a Data Reporting Session and the data
collection and reporting configuration it represents by invoking the
_Ndcaf_DataReporting_DestroySession_ service operation.
**Figure 4.2.5.4-1: Application Server destroys DataReportingSession**
The steps in this procedure are as follows:
> 1\. The Application Server invokes the _Ndcaf_DataReporting_DestroySession_
> service operation by sending an HTTP DELETE request to the Data Collection
> AF (see clauses 7.2.3.2 and 7.2.3.3.3).
>
> 2\. The Data Collection AF acknowledges the destruction of the session and
> its configuration with a _204 No Content_ response.
### 4.2.6 Indirect data reporting
After acquiring its data collection and configuration from the Data Collection
AF, and in accordance with this configuration, the Indirect Data Collection
Client shall send reporting domain-specific data reports to the Data
Collection AF by invoking the _Ndcaf_DataReporting_Report_ service operation
across reference point R3 as described under clause 7.2.3.4.1. The data
reports shall be supplied in a generic data report envelope that includes at
minimum the baseline information for data reporting defined in clause 4.6.4 of
TS 26.531 [7].
The call flow in figure 4.2.6â€‘1 shows the procedure for indirect data
reporting.
> NOTE: It is assumed that the Indirect Data Collection Client is already
> configured per the procedures specified in clause 4.2.4.
>

> _DataReport_ (see clause 7.3.2.3).
2\. In the HTTP response the Data Collection AF may provide an up-to-date
_DataReportingSession_. The Application Server shall take note of any changes
and act accordingly.
### 4.2.8 Event subscription, management and publication
This clause pertains to the use of the _Naf_EventExposure_ service API as
defined in TS 29.517 [5] and invoked by the NWDAF or an Application Server
Provider AF to subscribe to and receive UE data related event information from
a Data Collection AF.
## 4.3 UE-to-network procedures
### 4.3.1 General
This clause specifies the procedures used between the UE and Network Functions
in support of provisioning a data collection and reporting configuration in
the UE's Direct Data Collection Client, and subsequent reporting of the
collected UE data to the Data Collection AF.
### 4.3.2 Configuration of Direct Data Reporting Client
#### 4.3.2.1 General
A Direct Data Reporting Client instance acquires its domain-specific data
collection and reporting configuration from a Data Collection AF instance by
means of the _Ndcaf_DataReporting_ service across reference point R2.
The Direct Data Reporting Client shall obtain its configuration by invoking
the _Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession_ service operation, as described under
clause 7.2.2.3.1.
The configuration information is contained in a generic data collection and
reporting configuration envelope that shall include at minimum the baseline
configuration parameters defined in clause 4.6.3 of TS 26.531 [7]. The
configuration shall specify the domain-specific parameters associated with the
specified Event ID(s) to be reported to the Data Collection AF.
#### 4.3.2.2 Direct Data Collection Client retrieves its initial configuration
by creating a Data Reporting Session
The call flow in figure 4.3.2.2â€‘1 shows the interaction between the Direct
Data Collection Client and the Data Collection AF at the initial configuration
of the Direct Data Collection Client.
Figure 4.3.2.2-1: Initial configuration of Direct Data Collection Client
The steps in this procedure are as follows:
1\. The Direct Data Collection Client invokes the
_Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession_ service operation by sending an HTTP POST
request to the Data Collection AF (see clauses 7.2.2.2 and 7.2.2.3.1). A
_DataReportingSession_ resource entity (see clause 7.3.2.1) is included in the
request message body, but only properties _externalApplicationId_ and
_supportedDomains_ are present (because the other properties are unknown to
the Direct Data Collection Client).
2\. In its _201 Created_ response, the Data Collection AF provides an extended
version of the _DataReportingSession_ resource entity in the message body,
adding the properties _sessionId_ , _validUntil_ , _reportForDomains_ and
_reportingCondition_ to the entity received from the Direct Data Collection
Client in step 1. The _validUntil_ property of the provided
_DataReportingSession_ should be a time in the future.
The Direct Data Collection Client is now configured.
#### 4.3.2.3 Updating and renewing data collection and reporting configuration
##### 4.3.2.3.1 Introduction
The data collection and reporting configuration may change as a result of
subscriptions to events exposed by the Data Collection AF, for example, as a
result of narrower or wider filters applied to an event subscription. There
are two ways the data collection and reporting configuration can be updated or
renewed by the Direct Data Collection Client:
1\. The Direct Data Collection Client invokes the
_Ndcaf_DataReporting_RetrieveSession_ service operation (see clause
4.3.2.3.2).
2\. The Data Collection AF supplies a _DataReportingSession_ in response to a
data report submitted by the Direct Data Collection Client (see clause
4.3.2.3.3).
##### 4.3.2.3.2 Direct Data Collection Client retrieves up-to-date
configuration
This operation is typically performed when the _validUntil_ property of the
current _DataReportingSession_ stored in the Direct Data Collection Client is
about to expire.
Figure 4.3.2.3.2-1: Direct Data Collection Client retrieves up-to-date
DataReportingSession
The steps in this procedure are as follows:
1\. The Direct Data Collection Client requests the _DataReportingSession_ for
the current session by using the _Ndcaf_DataReporting_RetrieveSession_ service
operation (see clauses 7.2.3.2 and 7.2.3.3.1).
2\. The Data Collection AF provides the latest _DataReportingSession_ in the
message body of a _200 OK_ response. The _validUntil_ property of the provided
_DataReportingSession_ should be a time in the future. In addition, the Data
Collection AF may change properties _reportForDomains_ and
_reportingCondition_.
##### 4.3.2.3.3 DataReportingSession updated in response to data reporting
See clause 4.3.3.
#### 4.3.2.4 Direct Data Collection Client destroys Data Reporting Session
The Direct Data Collection Client may destroy a Data Reporting Session and the
data collection and reporting configuration it represents by invoking the
_Ndcaf_DataReporting_DestroySession_ service operation.
Figure 4.3.2.3-1: Direct Data Collection Client destroys DataReportingSession
The steps in this procedure are as follows:
1\. The Direct Data Collection Client invokes the
_Ndcaf_DataReporting_DestroySession_ service operation by sending an HTTP
DELETE request to the Data Collection AF (see clauses 7.2.2.2 and 7.2.3.3.3).
2\. The Data Collection AF acknowledges the destruction of the session and its
configuration with a _204 No Content_ response.
### 4.3.3 Direct data reporting
After acquiring its data collection and configuration from the Data Collection
AF, and in accordance with this configuration, the Direct Data Collection
Client shall send domain-specific data reports to the Data Collection AF by
invoking the _Ndcaf_DataReporting_Report_ service operation across reference
point R2 as described under clause 7.2.3.4.1. The data reports shall be
supplied in a generic data report envelope that includes at minimum the
baseline information for data reporting defined in clause 4.6.4 of TS 26.531
[7].
The call flow in figure 4.3.3â€‘1 shows the procedure for direct data reporting.
NOTE: It is assumed that the Direct Data Collection Client is already
configured per the procedures specified in clause 4.3.2.
Figure 4.3.3-1: Direct data reporting
1\. When the _reportCondition_ of a _DataReportingSession_ is fulfilled, the
Direct Data Collection Client invokes the _Ndcaf_DataReporting_Report_ service
operation (see clauses 7.2.2.2 and 7.2.3.4.1) by issuing an HTTP POST request
to the Data Collection AF. The request message body is a _DataReport_ (see
clause 7.3.2.3).
2\. In the HTTP response the Data Collection AF may provide an up-to-date
_DataReportingSession_. The Direct Data Collection Client shall take note of
any changes and act accordingly.
## 4.4 UE-internal procedures
### 4.4.1 General
This clause specifies the procedures used by internal UE entities, namely a UE
Application and the associated Direct Data Collection Client, in support of UE
data collection by the Direct DC-Client for subsequent reporting to the DC-AF.
As described in clause 4.2 of TS 26.531 [7], the UE Application shares
relevant data with the Direct Data Collection Client via reference point R7
using the API specified in clause 8. In this release, such data sharing is
enabled by UE Application configuration via R7 as specified in the subsequent
clauses.
The Direct Data Collection Client is presumed to operate as a background
service, and its functionality is invoked upon activation of the UE
Application (whose role or task is domain-specific).
Each running instance of a UE Application compliant with the present document
shall be associated with a dedicated instance of the Direct Data Collection
Client, i.e., a separate logical _data collection and reporting context_
exists for each pair of UE Application instance and Data Collection Client
instance. If there are multiple UE Applications running concurrently on a UE,
each UE Application requires a unique data collection and reporting context
mapped to a separate Data Reporting Session at reference point R2.
### 4.4.2 Application registration procedure
Upon activation, the UE Application requests its UE data collection and
reporting configuration from the Direct Data Collection Client by invoking the
_registerUeApplication_ method at reference point R7. The UE Application
provides as input parameters its External Application Identifier, Application
Service Provider identifier, and information on its callback listener (for
receiving notifications from the Direct Data Collection Client). Using another
input parameter, the UE Application also indicates its consent for the UE
identity (i.e. GPSI) to be included in Data Reports sent to the Data
Collection AF.
As a consequence, the Direct Data Collection Client establishes a new Data
Reporting Session with the Data Collection AF using the procedure specified in
clause 4.3.2.2. The _Ndcaf_DataReporting_CreateSession_ invocation includes
the GPSI of the UE (if consent is given by the UE Application) or otherwise
the Direct Data Collection Client shall instead generate an opaque client
reporting identifier that is globally unique and stable (e.g. a UUID) and
include this in the invocation of the service operation.
If successful, the Direct Data Collection Client returns a UE data collection
and reporting configuration to the UE Application based on the information
returned by the Data Collection AF in the newly created Data Reporting Session
resource. As indicated in TS 26.531 [7], a generic envelope containing that
data collection and reporting configuration information is employed and its
content, as indicated in table 4.6.3-1 of [7], is reporting domain-specific.
### 4.4.4 Data reporting procedure
The UE Application reports data to the Direct Data Collection Client by
invoking the _reportUeData_ method on the Direct Data Collection Client at
reference point R7.
As a consequence, the Direct Data Collection Client may report the UE data
provided by invoking the procedure specified in clause 4.3.3. Depending on the
Data Reporting Configuration, the Direct Data Collection Client may instead
store the UE data and forward it later.
### 4.4.5 Configuration update procedure
The Direct Data Collection Client notifies the UE Application of changes to
the UE data collection and reporting configuration by sending a
_dataCollectionAndReportingâ€ŒConfigurationâ€ŒChanged_ callback notification.
The UE Application responds by invoking the
_getDataCollectionAndâ€ŒReportingConfiguration_ method at reference point R7 to
obtain the new configuration and acts upon it accordingly.
### 4.4.6 Procedure for changing consent to report the UE identifier
The UE Application can change its consent to reveal the GPSI of the UE in Data
Reports sent to the Data Collection AF during the course of a data reporting
session by invoking the _setUserConsent_ method on the Direct Data Collection
Client at reference point R7.
As a consequence, the Direct Data Collection Client shall destroy the current
Data Reporting Session and create a new one that includes either the GPSI of
the UE or the opaque client reporting identifier, according to whether consent
is granted or withdrawn.
### 4.4.7 Procedure for changing the opaque client reporting identifier
The UE Application may reset the opaque client reporting identifier at any
time by invoking the _resetClientReportingâ€ŒIdentifier_ method at reference
point R7.
As a consequence, the Direct Data Reporting Client shall destroy the current
Data Reporting Session. It shall generate a new opaque client reporting
identifier (e.g. UUID) and shall include this value when invoking the
procedure to create a replacement Data Reporting Session specified in clause
4.3.2.2.
### 4.4.8 Application deregistration procedure
Upon deactivation, the UE Application revokes its data collection and
reporting context by invoking the _deregisterUeâ€ŒApplication_ method at
reference point R7.
As a consequence, the Direct Data Collection Client shall destroy the Data
Reporting Session using the procedure specified in clause 4.3.2.4 after first
flushing any unreported UE data using the procedure specified in clause 4.3.3.

## 5.5 Explanation of API data model notation
The data models in the following API clauses are specified using the following
notational conventions:
1\. Data models are expressed as an unordered list of JSON properties [28]
with one property defined in each row of the data model table.
2\. The _Data type_ column defines the type of the property, according to JSON
notation [28].
3\. The keyword _Array_ in the _Data type_ column indicates that zero or more
elements of the data type in brackets are included. The number of elements in
the array may additionally be constrained by normative text in the
_Description_ column.
4\. The _Cardinality_ column defines whether a property is optional or
mandatory. An array with cardinality 0 indicates that the array property is
optional in the data structure. An array with cardinality 1 indicates that the
property is mandatory in the data structure, even when the array is empty.
5\. The keyword _Object_ in the _Data type_ column indicates a structured sub-
object of an unnamed type whose properties are defined inline in the indented
table rows immediately afterwards. The _Object_ type may be combined with the
_Array_ type.
6\. In the case of data types specifying RESTful resources, the additional
_Usage_ column defines the property behaviour for each CRUD Operation as
follows:
\- \"C\" (Create), \"R\" (Read) and \"U\" (Update) refers to the CRUD
procedure during which the property is present in the resource type. (The
Delete operation never takes any input data type.)
\- \"RO\" signifies a read-only property. Only the API provider function is
permitted to modify the property value. The API invoker can only read the
value.
\- \"RW\" signifies a read/write property. The API provider and API invoker
may both modify the property value.
7\. An additional read-only property (denoted \"C: ---\" and \"R: RO\") is
included at the start of all data models defining resources that are members
of a RESTful collection. This property is populated by the API provider at the
point of creation with the unique identifier of the resource within its parent
collection, and the value of this property corresponds to the leaf path
element in the RESTful URL of the created resource.
# 6 Ndcaf_DataReportingProvisioning service

  * In the event that the AS and the Data Collection AF are located in different trust domains, e.g., the former entity resides within the trusted domain and the latter entity resides outside the trusted domain (as in clause A.4 of TS 26.531 [7]), the NEF shall be employed to mediate the interactions between them, via the _Nnef_Dataâ€ŒReporting_ service API specified in TS 29.522 [27].
# 8 UE Data Collection, Reporting and Notification API
## 8.1 Overview
This clause specifies the UE Data Collection, Reporting and Notification API
used by internal UE entities, namely a UE Application and the associated
Direct Data Collection Client, in support of UE data collection by the Direct
Data Collection Client for subsequent reporting to the Data Collection AF, and
related exchange of notifications.
As noted in clause 4.3 of TS 26.531 [7] this API is not used when the Direct
Data Collection Client is embedded in the UE Application (i.e., Collaboration
E according to clause A.6 of [7]). However, this clause can serve as guidance
to the design of the internal APIs for a UE Application with an embedded
Direct Data Collection Client.
The UE architecture depicting the overall interactions between the UE
Application and the Direct Data Collection Client is shown in figure 8.1-1.
**Figure 8.1â€‘1: UE architecture for data collection, reporting and
notification via R7 API**
## 8.2 Direct Data Collection Client state model
### 8.2.1 Overview
Figure 8.2.1-1 represents an informative Direct Data Collection Client state
model in order to properly describe the methods invoked on the R7 API. Five
different states as indicated in the diagram are described in table 8.2.1-1.
Figure 8.2.1-1: State model diagram
The depicted Direct Data Collection Client is dedicated to a corresponding UE
Application and would correspond to a context-specific instance in the case
where a single logical Direct Data Collection Client supports multiple UE
Applications in the UE. The state model does not imply any implementation
requirements for an instance of the Direct Data Collection Client, but rather
is intended for use as a model to support the description of the R7 API.
State changes may occur as result of:
\- Registration or deregistration of the UE Application at the Direct Data
Collection Client.
\- Data collection and reporting configuration request by the UE Application.
\- Data report received by the Direct Data Collection Client.
\- Notification received by the Direct Data Collection Client (e.g., of a busy
condition at, or impending failure/crash of, the UE Application).
\- Timeout at the Direct Data Collection Client due to inactivity or prolonged
busy state of the UE Application.
Table 8.2.1-1 defines the states of the Direct Data Collection Client.
Table 8.2.1-1: States of Direct Data Collection Client
State Definition
* * *
_IDLE_ The Direct Data Collection Client has not yet registered a UE
Application, or a previous registration has been revoked due to explicit
deregistration request from that UE Application, or upon receiving
notification of an impending fatal error condition at the UE Application, or
upon local timer expiration due to inactivity or prolonged busy state of the
UE Application. _REGISTERED_ The Direct Data Collection Client has received
valid registration from a UE Application. Having obtained the UE data
collection and reporting configuration for that UE Application, it is now
ready to provide the UE data collection and reporting configuration to the UE
Application. _READY_ The Direct Data Collection Client has received a valid
request from and returns a UE data collection and reporting configuration to,
the registered UE Application. _ACTIVE_ The Direct Data Collection Client has
received a UE data report, or a notification from the registered UE
Application that the latter has recovered from a previously busy/stalled
condition and is ready to send UE data reports to the Data Collection AF.
_BUSY_ The Direct Data Collection Client enters this state upon having
received notification that its registered UE Application is in a temporarily
busy state and unable to perform UE data reporting.
### 8.2.2 Direct Data Collection Client internal operations
This aspect is for further study.
### 8.2.3 Starting and stopping the Direct Data Collection Client
The Direct Data Collection Client (instance) shall be started (i.e.,
transition from _IDLE_ to _REGISTERED_ state) upon receiving a valid
registration over R7 from a UE Application. Correspondingly, the Direct Data
Collection Client shall be stopped (transition to _IDLE_ state from one of
several possible operating states) due to occurrence of one of the
corresponding conditions as described in table 8.2.1-1.
## 8.3 Methods
### 8.3.1 Overview
Table 8.3.1-1 provides an overview of the methods and notifications defined
for the UE Data Collection, Reporting and Notification API at reference point
R7. Different types of method are indicated, namely:
1\. State change of the Direct Data Collection Client triggered by the UE
Application action (registration or deregistration).
2\. Request from the UE Application to the Direct Data Collection Client for a
UE data collection and reporting configuration.
3\. Acknowledgment and related response information returned by the Direct
Data Collection Client to the UE Application for a successful UE Application
registration event.
4\. Data report by the UE Application to the Direct Data Collection Client
according to the previously obtained configuration.
5\. Notification from the UE Application to the Direct Data Collection Client.
