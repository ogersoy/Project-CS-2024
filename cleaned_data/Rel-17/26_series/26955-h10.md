**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of

# Introduction
Predictions on mobile video consumption are ever increasing. Different studies
point to dominance of video traffic in 5G networks reaching from 65% total
traffic in the short-term all the way to 90% by the end of the decade. Video
is expected to be integral for services such as enhanced mobile media (such as
mobile streaming services), home broadband and TV (for example in the context
of 5G fixed wireless access services), immersive and interactive media in the
context of eXtended Realities (XR) and cloud gaming as well as new media
services from new verticals. This indicates that the user experience and
efficiency of 5G networks will be heavily impacted by the quality of video
compression technologies that are used with 5G services. Efficient video
compression and decompression technologies required dedicated hardware for
power and resource efficient real-time execution but are at the same time
complex and costly in terms of implementation on integrated platforms. Hence,
typically state-of-the-art video compression technologies last for several
years and are used as generic service enablers for different applications and
services, including traditional streaming and conversational services, but
also new media services. This document analyzes the currently defined 3GPP-
defined video compression technologies for their suitability for existing and
emerging services in the context of 5G and identifies gaps and optimization
potentials that would warrant the introduction of new video compression
technologies.
# 1 Scope
The present technical report documents relevant interoperability requirements,
performance characteristics and implementation constraints of video codecs in
5G services, and characterizes video codecs, in particular 3GPP defined codecs
H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC in order to have a benchmark for the addition of
potential future video codecs. For this purpose, the document:
\- Collects a summary of the video coding capabilities in 3GPP services.
\- Collects a subset of relevant scenarios for video codecs in 5G-based
services and applications, including video formats (resolution, frame rates,
colour space, etc.), encoding and decoding requirements, adaptive streaming
requirements.
\- Collects relevant and exemplary test conditions and material for such
scenarios, including test sequences.
\- Defines performance metrics for such scenarios with focus on objective
performance metrics.
\- Collects relevant interoperability functionalities and enabling elements
for video codecs in different 5G services such as MTSI and Telepresence (i.e.
RTP based conversational communications), or 5G media streaming (e.g. based on
DASH/CMAF) supporting the identified scenarios.
\- Collects relevant criteria and key performance indicators for the
integration of video codecs in 5G processing platforms, taking into account
factors such as encoding and decoding complexity in the context of the defined
scenarios.
\- Provides anchors for the existing codecs H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC in the
context of the above scenarios and document the findings in a consistent
manner and characterizes H.265/HEVC against H.264/AVC
\- Provides initial information on EVC video codec developed in ISO/IEC SC29
WG 4 and H.266/VVC video codec developed in JVET (ITU-T SG16 Q6 and ISO/IEC
SC29 WG 5) in the context of the above scenarios, including test streams and
characterization results.
\- Provides initial information AV1 video codec developed by the Alliance for
Open Media in the context of the above scenarios, including test streams and
characterization results.

# 4 Overview of video codec capabilities in 3GPP services in Release 17
## 4.1 Introduction
This clause summarizes the video coding capabilities in relevant existing 5G
services as of Release-16. Video codecs introduced in this clause are referred
to as 3GPP video codecs.
In Release 17, two video codecs are prominently referenced and available,
namely H.264 (AVC) [7] and H.265 (HEVC) [8].
Both codecs are defined as part of the TV Video Profiles in 3GPP TS 26.116 [3]
and are also the foundation of the VR Video Streaming Profiles in 3GPP TS
26.118 [4]. The highest defined profile/level combinations are:
\- H.264 (AVC) Progressive High Profile Level 5.1 [7] with the following
additional restrictions and requirements:
o the maximum VCL Bit Rate is constrained to be 120Mbps with cpbBrVclFactor
and cpbBrNalFactor being fixed to be 1250 and 1500, respectively.
o the bitstream does not contain more than 10 slices per picture
\- H.265 (HEVC) Main 10 Profile Main Tier Level 5.1 [8] without any
restrictions
Both codecs are also defined for other 3GPP-based services. More details on
the codec capabilities and the necessary interoperability requirements for
different services are collected in the remainder of this clause.
## 4.2 TV Video Profiles
The TV Video Profiles in TS 26.116 [3] address coded representations of TV
distribution signals up to UHD-1 phase 2. Table 4.2-1 provides an overview of
the TV relevant formats considered in the context of 3GPP TV Video Profiles.
In the context of TV Video Profiles, the following aspect are defined:
\- **Bitstream** : A media bitstream that conforms to a video encoding format
and certain Operation Point.
\- **Operation Point** : A collection of discrete combinations of different
content formats including spatial and temporal resolutions, colour mapping,
transfer functions, etc. and the encoding format.

Each one of the Operation Points is associated with a video coding
specification and a particular Profile, Level, and Tier (for HEVC). The
combination of a specific profile, level, and tier indicate the maximum
decoding capabilities, such as chroma format, resolution, frame rate, and bit
depth, that can be supported by a decoder conforming to such combination of
parameters. An operation point is also associated with additional bitstream
constraints defined in TS 26.116 [3], clause 4. Table 4.2-2 summarizes the
video coding specification profile, tier, and level associated with each
operation point.

For TV Video profiles, interoperability with ISO BMFF based systems and the
DASH Streaming is of most relevance. Hence, for a codec to be used in the
context of TV Video Profiles, the following is defined in terms of
interoperability:
  1. The receiver requirements on elementary stream level
  2. The encapsulation of an elementary stream into an ISO Base Media File Format track
  3. The provisioning of the media as part of the DASH Adaptation Set to support seamless switching
  4. All MPD-level signalling for the codec to support capability discovery
For details, refer to TS 26.116 [3], clause 4 and clause 5.
## 4.3 VR Video Profiles
The VR profiles for streaming applications defined in TS 26.118 [4] address
the coded representation of 360 VR distribution signals. Table 4.3-1 provides
an overview of the 360 VR relevant formats considered in the context of 3GPP
VR profiles. The VR profiles follow the same logic as the TV Video profiles,
they represent a list of interoperability points that are amended by the 3GPP
services such as 5G Media Streaming (5GMS) described in the following clause.

## 4.4 5G Media Streaming
### 4.4.1 Introduction
5G Media Streaming (5GMS) services are associated with a series of 5GMS
profiles, each of which contains a set of capability requirements associated
with a service scenario. Default profiles (for downlink and uplink streaming)
are also defined in case no other profile is claimed to be supported. The

## 4.5 Multimedia Telephony Services over IMS
### 4.5.1 Introduction
The Multimedia Telephony Services over IMS (MTSI) specification 3GPP TS 26.114
[2] covers the media aspects of 3GPP conversational services. For MTSI
services the UE is associated with both encoder and decoder requirements.
Therefore, the support for a given video codec with its profile and level is
interpreted as the ability to:
\- encode any video input which characteristics fit in the level limits and
produce a bitstream conformant with the codec profile.
\- decode any bitstream in the codec/profile/level configuration.
NOTE: Additional constraints related to conversational services such as
decoding process, location of the parameter sets are defined in TS 26.114 [2],
clause 5.2.2.
### 4.5.2 H.264 (AVC)
TS 26.114 [2], in clause 5.2.2 requires the support of H.264 (AVC) [7]
Constrained Baseline Profile (CBP) Level 1.2.
TS 26.114 [2], in clause 5.2.2 also recommends H.264 (AVC) [7] Constrained
High Profile (CHP) Level 3.1.
### 4.5.3 H.265 (HEVC)
TS 26.114 [2] requires the support of H.265 (HEVC) [8] Main Profile, Main
Tier, Level 3.1 except for constrained terminals for which it is only
recommended.
### 4.5.4 Encapsulation format
MTSI is built upon the Real Time Protocol (RTP) for which the payload formats
are specified in TS 26.114 [2], clause 7.4.3.
## 4.6 Messaging Services
3GPP TS 26.140 [32] specifies the media types, formats and codecs for the MMS
within the 3GPP system. The document extends to codecs for speech, audio,
video, still images, bitmap graphics, and other media in general, as well as
scene description, multimedia integration and synchronization schemes.
Specifically, for video, the following capabilities are defined:
\- TS 26.140 [32] requires the support of H.264 (AVC) [7] Constrained Baseline
Profile (CBP) Level 1.3.
\- TS 26.140 [32] recommends the support of H.264 (AVC) [7] High Profile Level
3.1 with frame_mbs_only_flag=1 by MMS clients supporting HDTV video content at
a resolution of 1280x720 (720p) with progressive scan at 30 frames per second.
\- TS 26.140 [32] also recommends the support of H.265 (HEVC) [8] Main
Profile, Main Tier, Level 3.1.
NOTE: The specification has not been updated since 2014.
## 4.7 Screen Content Coding
3GPP TS 26.223 [35] specifies a client for the IMS-based telepresence service
supporting conversational speech, video and text transported over RTP.
Telepresence is defined as a conference with interactive audio-visual
communications experience between remote locations, where the users enjoy a
strong sense of realism and presence between all participants (i.e. as if they
are in same location) by optimizing a variety of attributes such as audio and
video quality, eye contact, body language, spatial audio, coordinated
environments and natural image size.
As specified in 3GPP TS 26.223 [35] clause 5.2, telepresence UEs are required
to support:
\- H.264 (AVC) [7] Constrained High Profile (CHP), Level 3.1,
\- H.264 (AVC) [7] Constrained Baseline Profile (CBP), Level 1.2 (for
interworking with MTSI clients),
\- H.265 (HEVC) [8] Main Profile, Main Tier, Level 4.1.
As specified in 3GPP TS 26.223 [35], Telepresence UEs are also recommended to
support dedicated HEVC extensions defined specifically for such types of
content:
\- H.265 (HEVC) [8] Screen-Extended Main, Main Tier, Level 4.1,
\- H.265 (HEVC) [8] Screen-Extended Main 4:4:4, Main Tier, Level 4.1.
# 5 Test and Characterization Framework for Video Codecs
## 5.1 Overview
This clause defines the characterization framework for video codecs for
relevant 3GPP scenarios. For this purpose, the following is applied:
\- A set of relevant scenarios is defined. The scenarios reflect a typical
application for video codecs in 5G systems and networks. The scenarios are
introduced in clause 6 and may be extended in future versions of this
document.
\- For each scenario, one or several reference sequences are defined that
serve as the baseline for anchor generation.
\- For each test scenario, one or several anchors are defined and generated.
For details on anchors, please refer to clause 5.3. For anchor generation,
reference software tools are used as introduced in clause 5.4. Anchors for
specific scenarios follow certain general encoding constraints documented in
clause 5.6.
\- For each of the anchors, metrics are provided. Metrics are documented in
detail in clause 5.5.
\- Tests for new codecs can be developed and generated. They are equivalent to
anchor generation, but possibly for other codecs. Tests are introduced in
clause 5.7.
\- Codecs are to be characterized against anchors. Characterization is
documented in terms of expected bitrate savings for a codec, and may include
additional comparison parameters such as complexity increase, etc. The basic
characterization framework is introduced in clause 5.8.
\- Verification of the provided anchors and tests is needed. A process for
verification is introduced in clause 5.9.
An overview of the anchor generation framework and the anchor metrics is
provided in Figure 5.1-1. An integral part of this Technical Report is the
following information:
\- Formats to store reference and anchor sequences
\- Reference sequences for each of the defined scenarios
\- Reference software encoders
\- Anchor configuration files
\- Anchor bitstreams in a well-defined anchor bitstream format
\- A anchor metric computation based on a reference sequence, anchor bitstream
and an anchor sequence.
\- Conforming decoders to generate an anchor sequence from an anchor bitstream
\- Anchor metrics in a well-defined storage format.
NOTE: as the anchor sequences can be generated by conforming decoders, anchor
sequences are not included in this document.

Figure 5.1-1 Anchor Generation Framework and Anchor Metrics Generation
## 5.2 Reference Sequences
This document provides reference sequences that are used to generate anchors
and are also made available in order to generate test bitstreams for other
codecs. Reference sequences are selected to be representative for a scenario.
Reference sequences are described in Annex C of this document along with their
properties and their licenses. A format for raw reference sequences based on a
JSON schema is defined in clause B.2.
Annex D describes how to upload new proposed reference sequences and how to
download the reference sequences.
## 5.3 Anchors
Anchors provide a baseline that a tested method can be compared against.
Anchors defined in this specification use a codec/profile/level that exists in
an existing 3GPP specification as introduced in clause 4.
Anchor tuples are collected to address different qualities and bitrates that
can then be used for evaluation over a larger set of operation points.
The following principles apply to anchor definitions:
\- Each scenario typically has several well-defined anchors
\- An anchor is a combination of:
\- Explanation on anchor relevance
\- Reference sequence
\- Reference encoder
\- Encoder configuration matching scenario requirements
\- Encoding complexity estimation, if available
\- Variable encoder configuration to create multiple quality/bitrate variants
(using for example QP variations or other bitrate/quality evaluation tools).
\- Anchor tuples creating multiple variants, each including
\- Anchor bitstream
\- Anchor Metrics
\- Additional recommended anchor information includes
\- MD5 check sum of the complete reconstructed yuv file (anchor sequence)
\- Output picture log from reference encoder
\- Output picture log from reference decoder
Anchors and anchor tuples are an integral part of this document.
Anchor tuples should be created over a wide range of parameters to provide
sufficient data and overlap with expected test results to support the
generation of characterization results (see clause 5.7).
The workflow for the generation of anchor tuples is shown in Figure 5.3-1.
{width="6.5in" height="3.6041666666666665in"}
Figure 5.3-1: Anchor Tuple Generation Framework and Anchor Tuple Metrics
Generation
Anchors are provided according to the format as defined in Annex B.3.
## 5.4 Reference Software Tools
Anchors bitstreams for each anchor codec are generated with their
corresponding reference software. Reference software and reference
configurations are documented in each scenario under clause 6 to permit
repeatability of the anchor generation.
For H.264/AVC generated anchor bitstreams, H.264/AVC reference software (AVC
Joint Model) has been used.
AVC reference software implementing H.264 (AVC) High Profile called JM and its
versions can be downloaded from in the repository
http://iphome.hhi.de/suehring/tml/download/. To generate the anchor
bitstreams, JM19 is used with JM19 tag:
https://vcgit.hhi.fraunhofer.de/jvet/JM/-/commit/aab15e2e0315eca92368048170f1f546e357f328.
The software is referred to as JM19.
For H.265/HEVC generated anchor bitstreams, H.265/MPEG-H HEVC reference
software (HEVC Test Model) has been used.
HEVC reference software implementing H.265 (HEVC) Main Profile and H.265
(HEVC) Main 10 Profile called HM and its versions can be downloaded from in
the repository https://vcgit.hhi.fraunhofer.de/jct-vc/HM-/tags/.
HEVC reference software implementing H.265 (HEVC) Screen-Extended Main 10
Profile is called SCC (Screen Content Coding Model) software and is available
from https://vcgit.hhi.fraunhofer.de/jct-vc/HM/-/tags/HM-16.21+SCM-8.8.
Test bitstreams for tested codecs are generated with their corresponding
reference software. Test reference software and configurations are documented
in clause 8.
## 5.5 Metrics
### 5.5.1 General
Each anchor bitstream gets assigned multiple performance metrics, in
particular:
\- the bitrate as defined in clause 5.5.2,
\- If Standard Dynamic Range (SDR) is used, then the quality metrics in clause
5.5.4 apply.
\- If High Dynamic Range (HDR) is used, then the quality metrics in clause
5.5.5 apply.
An overview of the metrics is provided below. These metrics are implemented in
software scripts defined in Annex E. This software is used to compute and
report all the metrics. The detailed configuration for the software is
provided in clause 5.5.7 for SDR metrics and clause 5.5.8 for HDR metrics.
A detailed reporting schema for metrics is provided in clause 5.5.6.
Metrics for test streams are expected to follow the same principles.
Subjective evaluation of anchors and test streams is not considered in this
report.
### 5.5.2 Bitrate
Anchors and test streams are provided as bitstream files generated by
reference software encoders. The file size of the bitstream provides a
reasonable measure for the efficiency of codec in terms of compression
efficiency, together with a distortion/quality metrics as defined in clauses
5.5.3 and 5.5.4. However, in some cases the bitstream includes information
that is irrelevant for the reconstruction but may be useful for example for
debug and cross-check issues. An example for such information is the md5 hash
for each reconstructed frame. While such information is useful, it is expected
to be not counted when evaluating the compression efficiency.
In order to define a meaningful and comparable value for the size of the
bitstream, the effective file size _EFS_ is defined as the size of the
encapsulated bitstream
  * including all information that is needed for reconstruction of the anchor sequence,
  * excluding all information that is not needed for reconstruction of the anchor sequence.
Each reference encoder or even each scenario may define an EFS. Note that the
EFS is always expressed in octets.
Furthermore, in order to normalize the results, the compression efficiency is
most suitably expressed by dividing the _EFS_ by the duration of the encoded
reference sequence, referred to _duration_ in seconds.
Based on these considerations, the bitrate _Bitrate_ of an anchor or test
stream is defined as:
_Bitrate_ = 8 * _EFS_ / (1000 * _duration_) in kbit/s (5.5.2-1)
### 5.5.3 Quality Metrics - General
For quality metrics, a set of well-established metrics are re-used. All
defined metrics define a single number when comparing the sample values of the
original reference sequence $orig(x,y,t,c)$ and reconstructed and decoded
sequence $dec(x,y,t,c)$. In this case for each colour component _c=_(_Y,U,V_)
and each frame of the video sequence _t_ =1, ..., _N,_ describe the sample
positions within a luma image of width $W_{Y}$ and height $H_{Y}$, as well as
within a chroma image of width $W_{U} = W_{V} = \frac{W_{Y}}{2}$ and height
$H_{U} = H_{V} = \frac{H_{Y}}{2}$ and the reconstructed anchor or test
sequence.
For all metrics, it is assumed that the original sequence and the decoded
sequence have 10 bit precision, i.e. the range of the values is between 0 and
1023. Should a sequence have less than 10 bit, i.e. 8 bit, then the metric is
computed by applying an 8 bit to 10 bit conversion by appending 2 trailing 0s.
The following basic metrics per frame are defined. For an individual frame _t_
and each colour component _c_ , the mean square error $MSE(t,c)$ is calculated
for colour component channel $dec(t,Y)$ of the decoded output image and the
colour component channel $orig(t,Y)$ of the original image according to
$MSE(t,c) = \frac{1}{W*H}\sum_{y = 0}^{H - 1}{\sum_{x = 0}^{W - 1}\left(
\text{dec}\left( x,y,t,c \right) - origY\left( x,y,t,c \right) \right)^{2}},$
(5.5.3-1)
where $W$ and $H$ are the width and height of the colour component,
respectively. The PSNR value for the frame _t_ and each colour component _c_
is then calculated as:
$\text{PSNR}\left( t,c \right) = \min\left\lbrack 10*log10\left(
\frac{1020^{2}}{\text{MSE}\left( t,c \right)} \right),999.99 \right\rbrack\
\text{in\ dB}$ (5.5.3-2)
Then the PSNR for each bitstream is computed as the sum of all individual
frame PSNR values divided by the number of frames in the sequence, i.e.
$\text{PSNR}\left( c \right) = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{t = 1}^{N}{\text{PSNR}(t,c)}\
\text{in\ dB}$ (5.5.3-3)
This definition follows the definition of PSNR in [44].
### 5.5.4 SDR Quality Metrics
#### 5.5.4.1 Overview
Based on the introduction in clause 5.5.3, for standard dynamic range (SDR)
sequences, the following metrics are used:
\- Peak-Signal to Noise Ratio _PSNR_(_Y_) of luma component as defined in
clause 5.5.3,
\- Peak-Signal to Noise Ratio _PSNR_(_U_) of chroma component U as defined in
clause 5.5.3,
\- Peak-Signal to Noise Ratio _PSNR_(_V_) of chroma component V as defined in
clause 5.5.3,
\- Average colour component PSNR, _PSNR_ over all colour components _PSNR_ :
_PSNR_ = (6*_PSNR_(_Y_) + _PSNR_(_U_) + _PSNR_(_V_))/ 8
\- Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Metric _MS-SSIM_ , as specified in [54],
[55] and [56] and defined in clause 5.5.4.2
\- Video Multimethod Assessment Fusion (VMAF) _VMAF_ , as specified in [57].
See clause 5.5.7 on the use of the associated software implementation [59] to
compute VMAF.
The exact definition for all SDR quality metrics is based on the software
scripts as defined in clause 5.5.7. A reporting scheme for SDR metrics is
defined in clause 5.5.6.
#### 5.5.4.2 Structural similarity metric MS-SSIM
The multi-scale SSIM method is illustrated in Figure 5.5.4-1. Taking the
original reference sequence $orig(x,y,t,c)$ and reconstructed and decoded
sequence $dec(x,y,t,c)$ image signals as the input (referred to as **x** and
**y** in Figure 5.5.4-1), the system iteratively applies a low-pass filter and
downsamples the filtered image by a factor of 2. The original image is indexed
as scale 1, and the highest scale as scale _M_ , which is obtained after _M_

calculated and denoted as C~j~ (**x** , **y**) and S~_j_ ~ (**x** , **y**),
respectively. The luma component (inappropriately named as the luma component

_BD-Rate Gain_ is computed according to the Common Test Condition (CTC) method
used in JVET and specified in [44]. According to the IETF draft on \"Video
Codec Testing and Quality Measurement\" [70], clause 4.2, the _BD-Rate Gain_
is defined as a measure of the bitrate reduction offered by a codec or codec
feature, while maintaining the same quality as measured by objective metrics.
The rate change is computed as the average percent difference in rate over a
range of qualities. Metric score ranges are not static - they are calculated
either from a range of bitrates of the reference codec, or from quantizers of
a third, anchor codec. Given an anchor codec and test codec, the _BD-Rate
Gain_ values are calculated as follows:
  1. Rate/quality points are calculated for the anchor and test code as (Q~anchor~[i], R~anchor~[i]), i=1, ..., N~anchor~ and (Q~test~[i], R~test~[i]), i=1, ..., N~test~
     * At least four points need to be computed, i.e. N~test~ >=4 and N~test~ >=4. These points should be the same quantizers when comparing two versions of the same codec.
     * Additional points outside of the range should be discarded.
  2. The rates R~anchor~[i]and R~test~[i] are converted into logarithmic scale.
  3. A piecewise cubic hermite interpolating polynomial is fit to the points for each codec to produce functions of log-rate in terms of quality measure. Interpolation functions require that two quality values are different. Hence, if provided data does have identical quality values, the higher rate point is adjusted to a slightly higher value that is withing the rounding error of the identical value, for example if twice 23.24 is reported, value 1 is set to 23.240 and the second value is set to 23.241.
  4. Quality ranges are chosen by the maximum of the minimum value of any of the two codecs and the minimum of the maximum value of any of the two codecs, i.e.
     * min_range = max (min(Q~anchor~[i]), min(Q~test~[i]))
     * max_range = min (max(Q~anchor~[i]), max(Q~test~[i]))
  5. The log-rate is numerically integrated over the metric range for each curve, using at least 1000 samples and trapezoidal integration.
  6. The resulting integrated log-rates are converted back into linear rate, and then the percent difference is calculated from the anchor to the test codec. This difference is reported as the _BD-Rate Gain_.
  7. The plot is provided in linear scale for bitrate and for quality metric, and the "gain" of test against anchor is shown in green, where as if there would be a loss, a loss would be shown in "red". The points in the linear domain are plotted also using piecewise cubic hermite polynomial interpolation.
As described in [44], the PSNR ranges of two curves generally do not overlap
completely, and the current practice is to avoid measuring the part of the
area between curves that are extrapolated rather than interpolated, which can
give unpredictable results if the non-overlapping parts are large. Therefore,
the area between the two curves is only measured in the region where there is
an overlap. If two curve overlap is only in a very small region, the BD-rate
will be calculated using only a small (and possibly atypical) part of the
available data. Therefore, it is important that the overlap is substantial for
the BD-rate value to be meaningful.
With the availability of _quality_ data for the anchor and the test, _Overlap_
is defined as follows:
$$Overlap = 100 \bullet \ \frac{\min_{}\left( \max_{i}\left(
Q_{\text{anchor}}\lbrack i\rbrack \right),\ \max_{i}\left(
Q_{\text{test}}\lbrack i\rbrack \right) \right) - \ \max_{}\left(
\min_{i}\left( Q_{\text{anchor}}\lbrack i\rbrack \right),\ \min_{i}\left(
Q_{\text{test}}\lbrack i\rbrack \right) \right)}{\max_{}\left( \max_{i}\left(
Q_{\text{anchor}}\lbrack i\rbrack \right),\ \max_{i}\left(
Q_{\text{test}}\lbrack i\rbrack \right) \right) - \ \min_{}\left(
\min_{i}\left( Q_{\text{anchor}}\lbrack i\rbrack \right),\ \min_{i}\left(
Q_{\text{test}}\lbrack i\rbrack \right) \right)}$$
The characterization of the codecs in the framework is documented when the
overlap is substantial.
An example for BD-rate computation and the associated values is provided in
Figure 5.8-2.

Figure 5.8-2: _BD-Rate Gain_ computation example
The JVET Excel files for the CTC include a VBS script bdrate() to compute the
BD-Rate performance between a test codec and a reference from four or five
rate-distortion points. However, to address different corner cases as well as
to ensure applicability to the reported csv metrics files, the above algorithm
is converted into a script python to generate the _BD-Rate Gain_ for a codec
under test vs. an anchor. Details on the script compare.py are available here
https://github.com/haudiobe/5GVideo, please refer to Annex F.
For providing the _BD-Rate Gain_ values for a single reference sequence and
configuration, the following is used
> Usage: python3 compare.py -s \ \
>
> Example: python3 compare.py -s S1-T01-264 S1-T01-265
For providing the _BD-Rate Gain_ values for all reference sequences of one
configuration, The following is used
> Usage: python3 compare.py -c \ \ configuration>
>
> Example: python3 compare.py -c S1-JM-01 S1-HM-01
It is assumed that the directory structure is configured as in the attachments
and the compare function is placed in the root directory where all scenarios
are provided. In case all information for one configuration is provided, the
data is written into a csv file in the directory Characterization of the codec
under test with the naming convention:
> \.\.csv
>
> Example: S1-JM-01.S1-HM-01.csv
NOTE: For consistency, the JVET excel files have been extended in the Random-
Access and low delay tabs to contain new columns for the new metrics: VMAF and
MS-SSIM, in the SDR case only. The "SA4 extended excel files" for SDR and HDR
are attached as S4-template-HDR.xlsx and S4-template-SDR.xlsx, but are not
considered to be used for BD-Rate computation.
In addition, the code permits to provide the Overlap using the following
command:
> Usage: python3 compare.py -c --overlap \ \ test configuration>
>
> Example: python3 compare.py -c --overlap S1-JM-01 S1-HM-01
The data is written into a csv file in the directory Characterization of the

## 5.9 Verification
### 5.9.1 Principles
Submissions of anchors, tests and associated metrics are based on 3GPP member
input. However, such input to be considered valid is expected of to be
verified. Verification in the context of this document includes the following
according to Figure 5.9.1-1:
1) Anchor bitstream verification: Anchor bitstreams are correct. By using a
defined reference sequence, an anchor configuration as well as a reference
encoder, two different executions of this process result in the same anchor
bitstream.
2) Anchor reconstruction is correct. By using a verified anchor bitstream, a
reference decoder in two different implementations results
    a.  in the same anchor sequence,
    b.  in the same quality metrics.
The equivalent process is applied for tests.
{width="6.69375in" height="3.1271216097987753in"}
Figure 5.9.1-1: Verification and cross-check processes
Verification is primarily supported by cross-checks from independent members
who carry out the execution of the same process and done by the initial
submitter of the anchors/tests. Whereas process 2 is deemed to be of
manageable complexity, process 1 is of significantly higher complexity. Based
on this it is expected that anchor reconstruction (process 2a) and anchor
metrics (process 2b) are cross-checked and verified for every anchor, whereas
anchor bitstreams are only cross-checked and verified for one anchor of the
entire anchor tuple.
A successful cross-check is defined as follows:
1) Anchor bitstream verification: Initial run and cross-check result in the
same size and md5 for the anchor bitstream
2) Anchor reconstruction verification. By using a verified anchor bitstream, a
reference decoder in two different implementations results in the same md5 for
the anchor sequence.
3) Anchor metrics verification. By using a verified anchor bitstream, a
reference decoder in two different implementations results in the same quality
metrics with a maximum deviation of 0.01 for all metrics that are required for
characterization.
This technical report includes verified metrics in the main body of the text
(i.e. successful completion of stage 3). Verified metrics are agreed to be
correct and have been sufficiently cross-checked.
This technical report may also include non-verified anchors, tests and metrics
in the Annex G. In this case, the reason for the lacking verification is
explained.
### 5.9.2 Documentation
In order to track initial submission, cross-checking and verification, the
anchor/test documentation adds the following information. The anchor/test

## 6.2 Scenario 1: Full HD Streaming
### 6.2.1 Motivation
The 2020 Mobile Internet Phenomena Report from Sandvine [9] shows that mobile
video downstream traffic accounts for more than 65% of the global application
category traffic share.
According to Ericsson mobility report [10], video traffic in mobile networks
is forecast to grow by around 30 percent annually through 2025 to account for
three-quarters of mobile data traffic, from slightly more than 60 percent in
2019. The video traffic growth is driven by the increase of embedded video in
many online applications, growth of video-on-demand (VoD) streaming services
in terms of both subscribers and viewing time per subscriber, and the
evolution toward higher screen resolutions on smart devices. All of these
factors have been influenced by the increasing penetration of video-capable
smart devices.
Furthermore, while UHD and 4K are trendy formats, the main application for
mobile streaming is Full HD with 1080p at 50 or 60 frames per second and is
expected to be the format of choice for mobile streaming at scale. The
distribution version may be down-sampled to support adaptive bitrate
streaming, possibly with High Dynamic Range (HDR) support. For detailed
discussion please refer to the presentation at the DASH-IF Workshop Dec 2019
[11].
In terms of distribution, while in the past, streaming video was delivered
primarily via RTMP or RTP, fewer and fewer devices support these aging
protocols each year. Instead, the latest web standards support built-in video
playback and HTML5 is now by far the preferred method for video playback. And
adaptive bitrate protocols dominate the distribution. According to the
developer report [12], adaptive bitrate streaming through HLS/DASH, using the
CMAF/DASH based segment formats, provide vast majority for streaming video.
The distribution is used for On-Demand and Live Streaming.
### 6.2.2 Description of the Anticipated Application
In the context of 3GPP services, 5G Media Streaming [13] as well as the TV
Video Profiles [3] are specifications addressing this streaming scenario.
Both, 5G Media Streaming [13] and TV Video Profiles [3] builds on CMAF-based
Segment formats and DASH distribution. From TS 26.116, the following operation
points may be considered in scope of the Full HD Streaming Scenario (pending
availability of appropriate test content):
\- H.265/HEVC Full HD HDR, see TS26.116 [3] clause 4.5.3.
\- H.264/AVC Full HD, see TS26.116 [3] clause 4.4.3.
\- H.265/HEVC Full HD, see TS26.116 [3] clause 4.5.5.
\- H.265/HEVC Full HD HDR HLG, see TS26.116 [3] clause 4.5.7.
These operation points are further informed by relevant operational experience
with commercially available encoders and decoders.
The considered scenario is the distribution of content through DASH/CMAF based
streaming. Important aspects that are expected to be considered when
evaluating a codec in the context of this:
\- Quality and Coding Efficiency:
\- High and uninterrupted visual quality, taking into account the service
constraints.
\- Any savings can provide significant benefits due to the expected large
volume of the traffic either in quality or network utilization.
\- Adaptive Bitrate streaming:
\- Multiple bit rates are provided, typically with a ladder of 30--50% to
permit bandwidth adaptation. The use of constant bit rate (CBR) encoding
maximises reuse of a common ladder of encoded representations across multiple
distribution networks. The use of capped variable bit rate (VBR) encoding
allows the bit rate to be varied according to the difficulty of the source
material while maintaining the ability to distribute the encoded
representations through distribution networks with fixed capacity. This also
maximises reuse of a common ladder across multiple distribution networks.
\- CMAF Fragments of size typically in the range of 1--6s to permit seamless
switching for bit rate adaptation.
\- Regular Random Access, typically every 1--2 seconds according to TS 26.116
[3]. To achieve clean switching in both sound and picture when moving between
different encoded representations in the ladder, 3.84 seconds enables video
segment boundaries to be aligned with an integer number of audio Access Units,
if a 50fps video signal and 48kHz audio signal is used.
\- Encoding in this scenario is typically done as
\- Live and On-Demand distribution and encoding
\- Server and Cloud-based Encoding
\- No specific encoding latency constraints

##### 6.2.8.2.2 S1-JM-01
To generate the anchor bitstreams, JM19 is used.
However, as the test sequences are 10 bit sequences, 8 bit version of S1 SDR
reference sequences are generated with HDRConvert and the attached HDRConvert
config HDRConvert_10bto8b.cfg. These sequences are used to generate the
H.264/AVC anchors for S1. To generate the metrics, the 8 bit output is
converted to 10 bit using HDRConvert and the attached HDRConvert config
HDRConvert_8bto10b.cfg.
In order to verify the proper down scaling from 10 to 8 bit, a csv file if
provided with the md5 of the 8 bit downconverted reference sequences here:

## 6.3 Scenario 2: 4K-TV
### 6.3.1 Motivation
Streaming towards mobile devices is undoubtly the first natural use-case
expected for 5G-media streaming. However, consumption of video services on
fixed receivers (e.g. TV sets) remains a preferable way of experiencing the
high-quality content, whether it is for on-demand (e.g., blockbuster movies)
or live services (e.g., sport events). Recent reports from largest VOD
platforms such as Netflix confirm that assumption and show that the primary
way of watching content remains fixed TV screens, covering 70% of devices 6
months after subscription [17]. In the same way, YouTube indicates that
service usage on fixed TV set remains an inevitable way of accessing the
content, with 250M of hours viewed per day on TV screens [18]. As 5G media
streaming targets a wide range of connected devices and is expected to be able
to deliver video streams to many compatible high-resolution receivers, (e.g.
5G-HDMI-sticks, 5G-StB/5G-MediaGateway or even 5G-TV sets) the inclusion of 4K
TV Scenarios for 5G Video codec evaluation is important.
First, the 4K-TV set is currently the most established way of displaying
premium quality services using latest technology improvements for video
content, including High-Dynamic-Range (HDR) and Wide-Colour-Gamut (WCG).
Latest statistics from the Ultra-HD forum indicate that 148 UHD services are
currently on-air, 74% being linear, 45% of those using HDR [19]. In addition,
a large number of SVOD operators propose 4K access in their subscription
packages (e.g. Netflix™ and Amazon Prime™). All these services may eventually
take advantage of 5G-network capabilities to increase the device reach and
enlarge audiences. This scenario is also endorsed by strong shipment
forecasts, as indicated in the latest IHS 4K-TV UHD bluebook [20].
### 6.3.2 Description of the Anticipated Application
In the context of 3GPP services, 5G Media Streaming [13] as well as the TV
Video Profiles [3] are specifications addressing this 4K-TV scenario. Both, 5G
Media Streaming [13] and TV Video Profiles [3] build on CMAF-based Segment
formats and DASH distribution. From 3GPP TS 26.116, the following operation
points may be considered in scope of the 4K-TV Streaming Scenario (pending
availability of appropriate test content):
\- H.265/HEVC UHD, see 3GPP TS 26.116 [3] clause 4.5.4.
\- H.265/HEVC UHD HDR, see 3GPP TS 26.116 [3] clause 4.5.6.
\- H.265/HEVC UHD HDR HLG, see 3GPP TS 26.116 [3] clause 4.5.8.
This scenario is based on CMAF (including LL-DASH and HLS-LL) distribution of
UHD-TV video services over 5G networks to 5G/non-5G capable devices. This
includes 5G-equipped devices (e.g. smartphone, tablets, ...) but also other
devices gateway (e.g. TV sets, HDMI-Stick...) accessing services through a
"5G-gateway" which can be a mobile phone or a home gateway. As multiple linear
services will be delivered in parallel (news, sport, talk show...) in a
similar manner as traditional TV services in a multiplex (potentially using
multicast/broadcast delivery over 5G). In certain environments, High Frame
Rate (HFR) beyond 60 fps is considered, e.g. in DVB and ATSC broadcast
specifications. 3GPP does not have any HFR TV video profiles yet.
Important aspects that are expected to be considered when evaluating a codec
in the context of this 4K-TV scenario are:
\- Quality and Coding Efficiency:
\- High and uninterrupted visual quality, considering the service constraints.
\- Any savings can provide significant benefits due to the expected large
volume of the traffic either in quality or network utilization.
\- Adaptive Bitrate streaming:
\- Multiple bit rates are provided, typically with a ladder of 30--50% to
permit bandwidth adaptation. The use of constant bit rate (CBR) encoding
maximises reuse of a common ladder of encoded representations across multiple
distribution networks. The use of capped variable bit rate (VBR) encoding
allows the bit rate to be varied according to the difficulty of the source
material while maintaining the ability to distribute the encoded
representations through distribution networks with fixed capacity. This also
maximises the usage of a common ladder across multiple distribution networks.
\- CMAF Fragments of size typically in the range of 1--6s to permit seamless
switching for bit rate adaptation.
\- Regular Random Access, typically every 1--2 seconds according to 3GPP TS
26.116 [3]. To achieve clean switching in both sound and picture when moving
between different encoded representations in the ladder, 3.84 seconds enables
video segment boundaries to be aligned with an integer number of audio Access
Units, if a 50fps video signal and 48kHz audio signal is used.
\- Encoding in this scenario is typically done as
\- Live and On-Demand distribution and encoding
\- Server and Cloud-based Encoding
\- Capable of encoding multiple services at variable bitrate, inside a fixed
dedicated resource (statistical multiplexing).
### 6.3.3 Source Format Properties
Table 6.3.3-1 provides an overview of the different source signal properties
for 4K-TV. This information is used to select proper test sequences.
Table 6.3.3-1 4K-TV source format properties
+--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Source format properties | 4K-TV | +==========================+==========================================+ | Spatial resolution | 3840 x 2160 | | | | | | (Permitted distribution formats: 2560 × | | | 1440, 1920 × 1080, 1600 × 900, 1280 × | | | 720) | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Chroma format | Y'CbCr | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Chroma subsampling | 4:2:0 | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Picture aspec ratio | 16:9 | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Frame rates | 24; 50; 60; 24/1.001; 60/1.001; [100; | | | 120] Hz | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Bit depth | 10 | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Colour space formats | BT.2020 [15] | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+ | Transfer characteristics | BT.2020 [15], BT.2100 [16] (PQ & | | | HLG) | +--------------------------+------------------------------------------+
NOTE: High Frame Rate (HFR) is not supported by 3GPP TV Video profiles defined
in 3GPP TS 26.116 [3] in release 16. However, HFR is introduced in this clause
for consideration on the video codec performances.
### 6.3.4 Encoding and Decoding Constraints
Table 6.3.4-1 provides an overview of encoding and decoding constraints for
4K-TV category using legacy codec HEVC. This will support the definition of
detailed test conditions. It is noted that no relevant profiles exist in
TS26.116 and TS26.511 for HFR 4K-TV content.

## 6.4 Scenario 3: Screen Content Scenario
### 6.4.1 Motivation
This scenario mostly motivates cases for which content goes beyond
videographic content, and in particular includes computer generated imagery
(CGI). Several application spaces rely on screen content types such as
videoconferencing and webinars with presentation slides displayed, or remote
desktop applications for demos or remote assistance. These services include
massive online videoconferencing systems and telepresence systems both being
particularly popular with remote collaboration.
For telepresence with screen-sharing applications, some information related to
video is collected in the following:
\- MS Teams™ [26] as of end of 2019.
o There are several formats supported for video. Two key properties of a video
format are its frame size and colour format. Supported frame sizes include
640x360 (\"360p\"), 1280x720 (\"720p\"), and 1920x1080 (\"1080p\"). Supported
colour formats include NV12 (12 bits per pixel) and RGB24 (24 bits per pixel).
o A \"720p\" video frame contains 921,600 pixels (1280 times 720). In the
RGB24 colour format, each pixel is represented as 3 bytes (24-bits) comprised
of one byte each of red, green, and blue colour components. Therefore, a
single 720p RGB24 video frame requires 2,764,800 bytes of data (921,600 pixels
times 3 bytes/pixel). At a frame rate of 30fps, sending 720p RGB24 video
frames means processing approximately 80 MB/s of content (which is
substantially compressed by the H.264 video codec before network
transmission).
\- Other tools are for further study.
As an example of hardware implementation, the Intel Xe LP™ chipset supports
HEVC screen content profile (see slide 101 of [41]).
### 6.4.2 Description of the Anticipated Application
3GPP until now has very restricted set of services but based on the
considerations in clause 6.4.1, the following encoding benchmark capabilities
are considered for decoding:
\- H.264 (AVC) YUV 4:2:0, YUV 4:4:4, 8 bit, Max Resolution 1920x1080
\- H.265 (HEVC) YUV 4:2:0, YUV 4:4:4, 10 bit, Max Resolution 4096 x 2048
The considered scenario is low-latency streaming or conversational. Important
aspects that are expected to be considered when evaluating a codec in the
context of this:
\- Quality and Coding Efficiency:
\- The ability to compress computer-generated content. Typically, it means the
ability to have non perceptible intra refreshes and the ability to maintain
stability on low frequency areas (such as uniform backgrounds) as well as
maintaining details on high frequencies (particularly for text)
\- The ability compress YUV 4:2:0 and 4:4:4 content.
\- Considered settings for encoding:
\- Low-latency settings
\- No specific error resilience mechanisms
\- Encoding in this scenario is typically done as
\- Real-time encoding
### 6.4.3 Source Format Properties

### 6.4.5 Performance Metrics
All SDR Metrics as defined in clause 5.5.2 may be reported. However, VMAF and
MS-SSIM may not be adequate for screen content sequences and PSNR is the main
SDR metric to consider.
Based on this, for BD-Rate computation and SDR, only the following metrics are
provided:
\- Peak-Signal to Noise Ratio _PSNR_(_Y_) of luma component as defined in
clause 5.5.3,
\- Average colour component _PSNR_ , PSNR over all colour components PSNR as
defined in clause 5.5.3.
### 6.4.6 Interoperability Considerations
For screen content, RTP-based communication is expected.

##### 6.4.8.2.2 Common Parameters
To generate the anchor bitstreams, JM19 is used.
The common parameters are as follows:
\- ProfileIDC = 100 (High Profile)
\- IDRPeriod = IntraPeriod
\- NumberOfReferenceFrames = 4
\- PList0References = 4 (P slice List 0 reference override)
\- I16RDOpt = 1 (rd-optimized mode decision for Intra 16x16 MB)
\- SearchMode = 3 Enhanced Predictive Zonal Search (EPZS)
\- SearchRange = 256;
\- Picture based multipass coding disabled
The following parameters are variables and triggered through updates of the
config-file.
  * QP: [22,27,32,37,42]
Note that the MaxMvsPer2Mb restriction is not matching the used level
requirement from H.264/AVC due to use of inter 4x4 subpartitions. While a
strictly conforming decoder may fail, this is not considered a limiting factor
in today's implementations.
##### 6.4.8.2.3 S3-JM-01: no random access
The common parameters as defined in 6.4.8.2.2 apply.
In addition, the following parameters apply:
\- LevelIDC = 42 or 52 (depending on resolution)
\- IntraPeriod = 0 (no random access)
\- NumberBFrames = 4
\- Quantization parameters are set according to Table 6.4.8.2.3-1.

##### 6.4.8.3.2 Common Settings
Each source sequence is encoded with:
\- QP: [22, 27, 32, 37, 42]
\- InternalBitDepth is 10 # codec operating bit-depth where all sequences
(including 8 bit sequences) are coded with an internal bitdepth of 10 in
accordance with [44] and metrics are calculated in 10 bits.
  * SEIDecodedPictureHash=1
As the SEIDecodedPictureHash is set to 1, the effective file size (EFS) needs
to take into account the removal of this SEI message when computing the
bitrate metric as defined in clause 5.5.2. For all anchors, a modified
bitstream is provided with '*.bis' suffix, for which the SEI removal is
applied. This file is used for bitrate computation.

### 6.4.10 Additional information and external performance data
In JCTVC-AA1006 [40], verification test report for HEVC screen content coding
extensions, "the coding performance of HEVC screen content model (SCM)
reference software with the SCC extensions enabled is compared with that of
HEVC test model (HM) without the SCC extensions, as well as with the AVC joint
model (JM) reference software in both lossy and mathematically lossless
compression modes using All-Intra (AI), Random Access (RA), and Low-delay B
(LB) encoding structures and using similar encoding rate-distortion
optimization techniques.
BD-rate savings of SCM over JM and SCM-w/o-SCC for RGB, YUV 4:4:4, and YUV
4:2:0 colour sampling formats were calculated by using the actual 648 test
points that were used in the subjective testing across 6 JCT-VC sequences.
The document contains details on sequences, test parameters and configuration
files, as well as subjective results. In the context of this study, only the
objective results for lossy Low-delay B are reported in Table 6.4.10-1.

## 6.5 Scenario 4: Messaging and Social Sharing
### 6.5.1 Motivation
According to the 2020 Mobile Internet Phenomena Report from Sandvine [9] Video
traffic continues to grow worldwide, and the increasing popularity of mobile
consumers sharing video has not only caused growth in downstream traffic, but
also in upstream traffic as well. Instagram ™ grew in the upstream as more
consumers share images and videos. TikTok ™, Snapchat ™ (video), FaceTime ™,
and even Facebook ™ Live were all in the top 50 applications worldwide on the
upstream that are video-sharing-centric. Messaging applications, especially on
the upstream, continue to become a critical part of the mobile experience,
replacing old style text messaging, and increasingly are video-based. Four of
the top 20 applications on the upstream are messaging apps.
Some typical examples and restrictions in April 2020 are provided in the
following:
1\. WhatsApp™ [25]
a. The maximum size of the video that you can share is 16 MB.
b. Various container formats that are supported by include MP4, MKV, AVI, 3GP,
and MOV. H.264/AVC video codec and AAC audio codec are needed today.
2\. YouTube™ [26]
a. H.264/AVC is the recommended codec with the following settings
i. Progressive scan
ii. High Profile
iii. 2 consecutive B frames
iv. Closed GOP. GOP of half the frame rate.
v. CABAC
vi. Variable bitrate. No bitrate limit required, though we offer recommended
bit rates below for reference
vii. Chroma subsampling: 4:2:0
b. Resolution Formats: 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 2160p
c. Both SDR and HDR are possible
d. The standard aspect ratio is 16:9
3\. Facebook Live ™ [27]. To live stream on Facebook™, these video format
guidelines are provided:
a. Recommended max bit rate is 4000 Kbps (4 mbps).
b. Max: 1080p (1920x1080) resolution, at 60 frames per second.
c. An I-frame (keyframe) must be sent at least every 2 seconds throughout the
stream.
d. H264 encoded video.
4\. TikTok™ [28], some video restrictions
a. Upload from Android, up to 72 MB at most. upload videos from iOS up to
287.6 MB.
b. Video dimensions should be 1080 x 1920
c. MP4 or MOV file format. Video should be H.264/AVC encoded
5\. Snapchat™ [25][2)], The latest information from 2018
a. Recommended size: 1080 by 1920 pixels (9:16 aspect ratio)
b. Recommended specs: .MP4 or MOV, H.264 encoded, maximum file size 1GB
According to Sandvine\'s report [9], sharing and uploading content as part of
social sharing is predominantly pictures and videos that uploaded directly
into a cloud and uploaded to one or many social networks, and then discussed
(or shared again) over messaging networks. The relevant quality-of-experience
factors include the quality of shared content, the time it takes to upload,
the costs associated with the upload and also the processing and battery
consumption requirements on the device to prepare the content for upload.
In another activity, three large operators released a 5G messaging white paper
[31] to promote enhanced messaging services based on Rich Communication
Services (RCS). This also shows the relevance of operator-based messaging
services. Generally, uplink resources are even more precious and costly in 5G
network operation and hence efficient technologies are vital for mass-scale
services. This aspect is also considered by GSMA RCS Universal Profile
specification, promoted as the industry standard for RCS Business Messaging,
ensuring the telecoms industry remains at the centre of digital communications
[34].
### 6.5.2 Description of the Anticipated Application
In the context of 3GPP services, 5G Media Streaming [13] provides the
following encoding benchmark capabilities:
\- HEVC-FullHD-Enc: the capability to encode a video signal with
\- up to 133,693,440 luma samples per second, and
\- up to a luma picture size of 2,228,224 samples, and
\- up to 240 frames per second, and
\- the Chroma format being 4:2:0, and
\- the bit depth being either 8 or 10 bit,
to a bitstream that is decodable by a decoder that is HEVC-FullHD-Dec capable
as defined in clause 4.2.2.1 of TS26.511 and defined as the capability to
decode H.265 (HEVC) Main10 Profile, Main Tier, Level 4.1 [3] bitstreams that
have general_progressive_source_flag equal to 1, general
interlaced_source_flag equal to 0, general_non_packed_constraint_flag equal to
1, and general_frame_only_constraint_flag equal to 1.
Based on the considerations in clause 6.5.1, it is also recommended to take
into account the AVC-FullHD-Enc capabilities as defined in TS26.511 [13]:
\- AVC-FullHD-Enc: the capability to encode a video signal with
\- up to 245,760 macroblocks per second, and
\- up to a frame size of 8,192 macroblocks, and
\- up to 240 frames per second, and
\- the Chroma format being 4:2:0, and
\- the bit depth being 8 bit,
to a bitstream that is decodable by a decoder that is AVC-HD-Dec capable as
defined in clause 4.2.1.1 of TS26.511 and defined as the capability to decode
H.264 (AVC) Progressive High Profile Level 4.0 [2] bitstreams.
Based on future expectations of higher quality uploads, it is also recommended
to take into account the HEVC-UHD-Enc capabilities as defined in TS 26.511
[13]:
\- HEVC-UHD-Enc: the capability to encode a video signal with
\- up to 534,773,760 luma samples per second, and
\- up to a luma picture size of 8,912,896 samples, and
\- up to 480 frames per second, and
\- the Chroma format being 4:2:0, and
\- the bit depth being either 8 or 10 bit,
to a bitstream that is decodable by a decoder that is HEVC-UHD-Dec capable as
defined in clause 4.2.2.1 of TS26.511 and defined as the capability the
capability to decode H.265 (HEVC) Main10 Profile, Main Tier, Level 5.1[3]
bitstreams that have general_progressive_source_flag equal to 1, general_
interlaced_source_flag equal to 0, general_non_packed_constraint_flag equal to
1, and general_frame_only_constraint_flag equal to 1.
The considered scenario is the uploading and uplink streaming into the
ISO/BMFF and CMAF container formats. Important aspects that are expected to be
considered when evaluating a codec in the context of this:
\- Quality and Coding Efficiency:
\- The ability to compress a video sequence targeting the maximum file size
and maintaining high quality.
\- The ability to compress a video stream in real time to the available uplink
streaming resources.
\- Considered settings for encoding:
\- Regular random access at least every 2 seconds, preferably more often
\- No specific encoding latency constraints are applicable
\- Encoding in this scenario is typically done as
\- Real-time encoding for social sharing
\- Offline encoding for messaging
\- UE-based Encoding

##### 6.5.8.2.2 Common Parameters
To generate the anchor bitstreams, JM19 is used.
To generate the anchor bitstreams, JM19 is used.
The common parameters are as follows:
\- ProfileIDC = 100 (High Profile)
\- IDRPeriod = IntraPeriod

## 6.6 Scenario 5: Online Gaming
### 6.6.1 Motivation
According to the 2020 Mobile Internet Phenomena Report from Sandvine [9]
gaming is continuing to grow on mobile network. The improved performance of 4G
and the coming promise of 5G will continue to drive at least casual gamers to
mobile networks.
For games rendered on 2D displays such as smart phones, typical
characteristics of rasterized frames produced by the game engine are:
\- Resolution of 720p, 1080p or 4K
\- Framerate of 30fps, 60fps or 120 fps
Typical colour bit depth of 8bits (RGB frames) but higher bit depth may be
offered for HDR compatible games.
Rasterized frames are directly passed to a video encoder (typically H.264 but
H.265 may be used in a few environments) and content is live encoded to fit
target quality. As an example, the following quality categorization may be
done:
\- High Quality: 4k at 60/120fps with an average throughput of 60/100 Mbps
\- Main Quality: 1080p at 60/120fps with an average throughput of 30/40 Mbps
\- Low Quality: 720p/1080p at 30fps with an average throughput of 10/12 Mbps
Online gaming for HMD-based consumption was discussed and introduced in detail
in TR 26.928 [6]. At least the following use cases are in context of Online
gaming:
\- Use Case 5: Untethered Immersive Online Gaming
\- Use Case 6: Immersive Game Spectator Mode
For raster-based split rendering, according to TR 26.928, clause 4.4,
rasterized 3D scenes available in frame buffers are provided by the XR engine
and need to be encoded, distributed, and decoded. According to clause 4.2.1,
relevant formats for frame buffers are 2k by 2k per eye, potentially even
higher. Frame rates are expected to be at least 60fps, potentially higher up
to 90 fps. The formats of frame buffers are regular texture video signals that
are then directly rendered. As the processing is graphics centric, formats
beyond commonly used 4:2:0 signals and YUV signals may be considered. It is
known from experiments that with H.264/AVC the bitrates are in the order of 50
Mbps per eye buffer. It is expected that this can be reduced to lower bitrates
with improved compression tools as for example available for H.265/HEVC. For
use case 5 from above and split rendering, encoding is required to be done in
low-latency based on the considerations in TR 26.928. For the spectator mode,
higher latency may be acceptable.
As an example, a comprehensive set of APIs including high-performance tools,
samples and documentation for hardware accelerated video encode and decode on
Windows and Linux for NVIDIA™ Video Codec SDK is available [N]. As another
example, in a game recording and streaming scenario like streaming to
Twitch.tv using Open Broadcaster Software (OBS), encoding being completely
offloaded to NVENC makes the graphics engine bandwidth fully available for
game rendering. As of May 2020, the following formats are supported for
hardware-based encoding as documented on the high-end Turing encoding:
\- H.264 (AVC) YUV 4:2:0, YUV 4:4:4, and Lossless, all 8 bit, Max Resolution
4096 x 4096;
\- H.265 (HEVC) YUV 4:2:0, YUV 4:4:4, and Lossless, all 10 bit, Max Resolution
8192 x 8192;
In typical cloud gaming environments, the game server produces rasterized
frames at a fixed resolution, framerate and colour bit depth which are
negotiated with the player client. Negotiation takes into account game
capabilities, player choices and eventually bandwidth constraints.
### 6.6.2 Description of the Anticipated Application
3GPP until now has very restricted set of services but based on the
considerations in clause 6.6.1, the following encoding benchmark capabilities
are considered for decoding 2D displays:
\- H.264 (AVCHD) YUV 4:2:0, YUV 4:4:4, 8 bit, Max Resolution 1920x1080 and
4096 x 2048
\- H.265 (HEVC) YUV 4:2:0, YUV 4:4:4, 10 bit, Max Resolutions 4096 x 2048,
8192 x 4096
The considered online gaming scenario is low-latency streaming, typically
using UDP/IP based distribution to minimize protocol latencies. Important
aspects that are expected to be considered when evaluating a codec in the
context of this:
\- Quality and Coding Efficiency:
\- The ability to compress traditional computer-generated content.
\- The ability to compress photorealistic computer-generated content.
\- The ability to compress YUV 4:2:0 and 4:4:4 content
\- Considered settings for encoding:
\- Ultra low latency and Low-latency settings
\- No specific error resilience mechanisms
\- Encoding in this scenario is typically done as
\- Real-time encoding
\- Cloud-based encoding
### 6.6.3 Source Format Properties
#### 6.6.3.1 Introduction
Video games have different characteristics that are important to take into
account when encoding the rasterized frames produced by the game engine. In TR
26.928 [6], clause 4.2.2, a few different types of games and their interaction
delay tolerance are documented. However, TR 26.928 [6] does not differentiate
the characteristics of the content. This aspect is addressed in the following.
In particular, the following characteristics are important:
\- Dynamicity of content: how frequent rasterized frames change when compared
to previous frame
\- Complexity of content: how much content changes between frames and how
complex such changes are
\- Type of content: traditional CGI, photo-realistic CGI or natural
images/video
Depending on these characteristics as well as the interaction delay tolerance,
video games can be organized into different categories as document in the
remainder of this clause.
#### 6.6.3.2 Category A: Low/medium dynamicity with low/medium complexity.
This category includes games such as board games, turn-by-turn strategy games,
management/simulation games or non-realtime role-playing games (RPG) in which
content may not change over several consecutive frames and changes are
typically limited.
This category also includes games such as adventure games, casual games, or
platform games in which although content may change at every single frame,
changes are limited to animation of sprites or simple global movements of the
content.
The common characteristics of the games in this category is that their
playability can support longer interaction delay tolerance (500 -- 1000ms
according to TR 26.928 [6]) and their content is typically considered to video
encode.
#### 6.6.3.3 Category B: games with high dynamicity and low/medium complexity.
This category includes games such as fighting games, racing games, real-time
strategy (RTS) games or real-time RPGs in which content is very dynamic but
changes are either limited or simple transforms.
The common characteristics of the games in this category is that their
playability requires shorter interaction delay tolerances (100ms according to
TR 26.928 [6]) while their content is still considered simple to video encode
(with high benefits from prediction coding).
#### 6.6.3.4 Category C: games with high dynamicity and high complexity.
This category includes games such as first-person shooters (FPS), Massive
Multiplayer Online (MMO) games and racing games in which content is very
dynamic with possibly very significant changes regularly in the content.
The common characteristics of the games in this category is that their
playability requires shorter interaction delay tolerances (100ms according to
TR 26.928) and their content is typically considered as complex content to
video encode.
#### 6.6.3.5 Category D: photo-realistic games or games based on natural
images/video.
The main characteristics of the games in this category is that their content
is typically considered as more complex content to video encode.
#### 6.6.3.6 Category E: XR game content
For a detailed analysis, please refer to clause 6.6.1 and TR 26.928, clause
4.4.

### 6.6.4 Encoding and Decoding Constraints
For photo-realistic games (Category D), certain \"screen content\" tools may
not provide much benefits for this type of game content and would need to be
tested.
Table 6.6.4-2 provides an overview of encoding and decoding constraints for
H.264/AVC Full HD and H.265/HEVC for online gaming. This information supports
the definition of detailed anchor conditions. The configuration files for HEVC
are used as the reference configurations for other codecs.

### 6.6.5 Performance Metrics
All SDR Metrics as defined in clause 5.5.2 may be reported. However, VMAF and
MS-SSIM may not be adequate for online gaming sequences and PSNR should be the
main SDR metric to consider.
Based on this, for BD-Rate computation and SDR, only the following metrics are
expected to be provided:
\- Peak-Signal to Noise Ratio _PSNR_(_Y_) of luma component as defined in
clause 5.5.3,
\- Average colour component PSNR, _PSNR_ over all colour components _PSNR_ as
defined in clause 5.5.3.
### 6.6.6 Interoperability Considerations
For online gamine, RTP-based communication is expected.
### 6.6.7 Reference Sequences
Reference sequences illustrating the Online Gaming scenario should ideally
contain synthetic content with detailed textures and realistic movements. This
should include FPS, RPG and Strategy games. For candidate test sequences,
please refer to Annex C.2.
Table 6.6.7-1 provides the selected reference sequences for this scenario.
Keys are identified to refer to the sequences in the context of the scenario.
The sequences are named and a reference to the details of the sequence is

##### 6.6.8.2.2 Common Parameters
To generate the anchor bitstreams, JM19 is used.
The common parameters are as follows:
\- ProfileIDC = 100 (High Profile)
\- IDRPeriod = IntraPeriod
\- NumberOfReferenceFrames = 4
\- PList0References = 4 (P slice List 0 reference override)
\- I16RDOpt = 1 (rd-optimized mode decision for Intra 16x16 MB)
\- SearchMode = 3 (Enhanced Predictive Zonal Search (EPZS))
\- SearchRange = 256;
\- Picture based multipass coding disabled
The following variable triggers updates to the config-file depending on the
test scenario.
  * QP: [22,27,32,37]
Note that the MaxMvsPer2Mb restriction is not matching the used level
requirement from H.264/AVC due to use of inter 4x4 subpartitions. While a
strictly conforming decoder may fail, this is not considered a limiting factor
in today's implementations.
##### 6.6.8.2.3 S5-JM-01: no random access
The common parameters as defined in 6.6.8.2.2 apply.
In addition, the following parameters apply:
\- LevelIDC = 52
\- IntraPeriod = 0 (no random access)
\- NumberBFrames = 4
\- BReferencePictures = 2
\- Quantization parameters are set as according to Table 6.6.8.2.3-1

##### 6.6.8.3.2 Common Parameters
Each source sequence is encoded with:
\- QP: [22, 27, 32, 37]
\- InternalBitDepth is 10 # codec operating bit-depth where all sequences
(including 8 bit sequences) are coded with an internal bitdeph of 10 in
accordance with [44] and metrics are calculated in 10 bits.
\- SEIDecodedPictureHash=1
As the SEIDecodedPictureHash is set to 1, the effective file size (EFS) needs
to take into account the removal of this SEI message when computing the
bitrate metric as defined in clause 5.5.2. For all anchors, a modified
bitstream is provided with '*.bis' suffix, for which the SEI removal is
applied. This file is used for bitrate computation.
##### 6.6.8.3.3 S5-HM-01: Main 10 Profile with no fixed random access
The common parameters as defined in 6.6.8.3.2 apply.
To generate the anchor bitstreams, HM16.22 is used.
Each source sequence is encoded with the following changes:
\- IntraPeriod with no fix interval
\- GOPSize is equal to 8. Each B picture refers to up to 4 preceding pictures
in display order within the GOP
\- IntraQPOffset is -1. B picture QP offsets are IntraQPOffset is -1. B
picture QP offsets are adjusted based on the base QP and on the QPmod,
QPoffset, QPOffsetModelScale and QPOffsetModelOff.
The settings are defined in the attached configuration file s5-hm-01.cfg.
##### 6.6.8.3.4 S5-HM-02: Main 10 Profile with fixed random access near 1 sec
The common parameters as defined in 6.6.8.3.2 apply.
To generate the anchor bitstreams, HM16.22 is used.
Each source sequence is encoded with the following changes:
\- IntraPeriod = power of 2 value that is greater than or equal to the frame
rate (fps), such that near 1 second is achieved: 32 for 30fps sequences and 64
for 60fps sequences
\- DecodingRefreshType: (2) IDR
\- IntraQPOffset and B pictures QPoffsets are set equal to 0
\- Each B picture refers to immediately preceding pictures in display order.
The settings are defined in the attached configuration file s5-hm-02.cfg.
##### 6.6.8.3.5 S5-SCC-01: Screen Content Profile with no fixed random access
The common parameters as defined in 6.6.8.3.2 apply.
To generate the anchor bitstreams SCM-8.8 is used.
Each source sequence is encoded with the following changes:
\- IntraPeriod with no fix interval
\- GOPSize is equal to 8. Each P picture refers to up to 4 preceding pictures
in display order within the GOP
\- IntraQPOffset is -1. B picture QP offsets are IntraQPOffset is -1. B
picture QP offsets are adjusted based on the base QP and on the QPmod,
QPoffset, QPOffsetModelScale and QPOffsetModelOff.
The settings are defined in the attached configuration file s5-scc-01.cfg.

## 7.5 External Characterization Results
### 7.5.1 Introduction
This clause introduces external characterization results that have been
conducted in a similar fashion as introduced in clause 5.8 but are not based
on the metrics developed in this report.
### 7.5.2 H.265/HEVC Characterization against H.264/AVC.
In JCTVC-Q1011 [65] the JCTVC verification test reports that the HEVC standard
achieves a substantial improvement in compression capability relative to its
predecessor, the AVC standard, in accordance with the "HEVC verication test
plan" in JCTVC-P1011 [65]. The precise performance results reported are a
consequence of the specific configurations and software used.
The verification test was conducted for the HEVC Main profile and the AVC High
profile using the HM12.1 (reference HEVC codec) and JM18.5 (reference AVC
codec). Four picture resolutions UHD, 1080p, 720p and 480p were tested. Each
resolution was represented by 5 test sequences, giving a total of 20 test
sequences. For each test sequence 4 test points were chosen.
A bit depth of 8 bits for 480p, 720p and 1080p sequence and of 8 & 10 bits for
4K sequences was used. The coding structure was a combination of Random Access
(RA) with an Intra refresh period at approximately 1 second intervals with
picture reordering allowed and Low Delay (LD) with no intra refresh and no
picture reordering.
A subjective evaluation was conducted comparing the same twenty test
sequences.
Analysis of the subjective test results show that the HEVC bitstreams,
generated at half or less than half the bit rate of the AVC reference
bitstreams, were found to achieve comparable quality in 86% of the cases. This
can be seen equivalently as the HEVC Main profile bitstreams requiring on
average 59% fewer bits compared to the AVC reference bitstreams, to achieve
the same subjective quality.
Figure 7.6.2-1 provides an overview of the results.
The bit rate savings are similar for the different resolutions tested, with
higher resolution sequences having slightly more savings. The average bit rate
savings for the test sequences with UHD, 1080p, 720p and 480p resolutions are
estimated at approximately 64%, 62%, 56% and 52%, respectively.

# 8 Initial Information on new Codecs
## 8.1 Introduction
This clause collects initial information on how new codecs under development
in ISO/IEC SC29 WG 4/WG 5 (MPEG Video/JVET) - (in particular including VVC and
EVC) and by the Alliance for Open Media (AV1), may meet the above criteria
based on the characterization results provided, for example, by such
organizations.
## 8.2 Versatile Video Coding (VVC)
### 8.2.1 Overview
ITU-T SG 16 informed that the development of the new Versatile Video Coding
(VVC) standard has been completed for Consent at the June-July 2020 meeting of
ITU-T SG16 and is also thereafter undergoing final approval in ISO/IEC JTC
1/SC 29/WG 11 (MPEG). After final approval, the dual reference to the jointly
developed VVC standard will be Rec. ITU-T H.266 \| ISO/IEC 23090-3 [38].
VVC is the latest in a series of such jointly developed ITU-T Recommendations
and International Standards for video coding, and is the direct successor to
HEVC (Rec. ITU-T H.265 \| ISO/IEC 23008-2) [8] and AVC (Rec. ITU-T H.264 \|
ISO/IEC 14496-10) [7]. VVC provides significant coding efficiency improvements
over HEVC. Plans are underway to conduct a verification test with formal
subjective testing to confirm that VVC achieves about a 50% bit rate reduction
vs. HEVC for equal subjective video quality. Test results demonstrate that VVC
provides about a 40% bit rate reduction for 4K/UHD test sequences using
objective metrics. Application areas especially targeted for the use of VVC
include ultra-high definition 4K and 8K video, video with a high dynamic range
and wide colour gamut, and video for immersive media applications such as 360°
omnidirectional video, as well as conventional standard-definition and high-
definition video content. In addition to improving coding efficiency, VVC also
provides highly flexible syntax supporting such use cases as subpicture
bitstream extraction, bitstream merging, and layered coding scalability.
The VVC standard includes the specification of a \"Main 10\" profile that
supports 8- and 10-bit 4:2:0 video, a \"Main 10 4:4:4\" profile with 4:4:4 and
4:2:2 format support, corresponding \"Multilayer Main 10\" and \"Multilayer
Main 10 4:4:4\" profiles with support for layered coding, and \"Main 10 Still
Picture\" and \"Main 10 4:4:4 Still Picture\" profiles for still image coding
employing the same coding tools as in the corresponding video profiles.
ITU-T also announced AAP Consent for Rec. ITU-T H.274 "Versatile supplemental
enhancement information for coded video bitstreams" (VSEI), developed jointly
as twin text with ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 11 as ISO/IEC 23002-7 [39]. VSEI
specifies the syntax and semantics of video usability information (VUI)
parameters and supplemental enhancement information (SEI) messages for use
with coded video bitstreams. VSEI is particularly intended for use with VVC,
although it is drafted in a manner intended to be sufficiently generic that it
may also be used with other types of coded video bitstreams.
### 8.2.2 Test Configurations and Results for VTM
#### 8.2.2.1 Introduction
This clause provides test setups, configurations and results for VVC.
The reference software for H.266/MPEG-I VVC is called VTM (VVC Test Model).

##### 8.2.2.4.2 Test Model and Configurations
###### 8.2.2.4.2.1 Common Parameters
To generate the anchor bitstreams, the following is applied:
  * VTM Main 10 in low delay P configuration is used with screen content tools enabled. In addition, to enable screen content tools, the following settings are set to 1: IBC, HashME, BDPCM.
  * InternalBitDepth is 10 # codec operating bit-depth where all sequences (including 8 bit sequences) are coded with an internal bitdeph of 10 in accordance with [44] and metrics are calculated in 10 bits.
  * Each source sequence is encoded with the following parameters: QP: [22, 27, 32, 37, 42]
  * SEIDecodedPictureHash=1
  * CIIP=0
As the SEIDecodedPictureHash is set to 1, the effective file size (EFS) needs
to take into account the removal of this SEI message when computing the
bitrate metric as defined in clause 5.5.2. For all teststreams, a modified
bitstream is provided with '*.bis' suffix, for which the SEI removal is
applied. This file is used for bitrate computation.
###### 8.2.2.4.2.2 S3-VTM-01/03: Main 10 Profile with no fixed Intra
Each source sequence is encoded with the following configurations:
\- The common parameters defined in clause 8.2.2.4.2.1.
\- IntraPeriod with no fix interval
\- GOPSize is equal to 8. Each P picture refers to up to 4 preceding pictures
in display order within the GOP
The detailed settings are defined in the attached configuration file
s3-vtm-01/03.cfg.
###### 8.2.2.4.2.3 S3-VTM-02/04: Main 10 Profile with fixed Intra every second
Each source sequence is encoded with the following configurations:
\- The common parameters defined in clause 8.2.2.4.2.1.
\- IntraPeriod such that 1 second is achieved
\- DecodingRefreshType: (2) IDR
\- IntraQPOffset and QPoffsets are set equal to 0
\- Each P picture refers to immediately preceding pictures in display order.
The detailed settings are defined in the attached configuration file

##### 8.2.2.6.2 Test Model and Configurations
###### 8.2.2.6.2.1 Common Parameters
To generate the anchor bitstreams, the following is applied:
  * VTM Main 10 in low delay B configuration is used with screen content tools enabled. In addition, to enable screen content tools, the following settings are set to 1: IBC, HashME, BDPCM.
  * InternalBitDepth is 10 # codec operating bit-depth where all sequences (including 8 bit sequences) are coded with an internal bitdepth of 10 in accordance with [44] and metrics are calculated in 10 bits.
  * Each source sequence is encoded with the following parameters: QP: [22, 27, 32, 37]
  * SEIDecodedPictureHash=1
As the SEIDecodedPictureHash is set to 1, the effective file size (EFS) needs
to take into account the removal of this SEI message when computing the
bitrate metric as defined in clause 5.5.2. For all teststreams, a modified
bitstream is provided with '*.bis' suffix, for which the SEI removal is
applied. This file is used for bitrate computation.
###### 8.2.2.6.2.2 S5-VTM-01: Main 10 Profile with no fixed Intra
Each source sequence is encoded with the following configurations:
\- The common parameters defined in clause 8.2.2.6.2.1.
\- IntraPeriod with no fix interval
\- GOPSize is equal to 8. Each B picture refers to up to 4 preceding pictures
in display order within the GOP
The detailed settings are defined in the attached configuration file
s5-vtm-01.cfg.
###### 8.2.2.6.2.3 S5-VTM-02: Main 10 Profile with fixed Intra every second
Each source sequence is encoded with the following configurations:
\- The common parameters defined in clause 8.2.2.6.2.1.
\- IntraPeriod such that 1 second is achieved
\- DecodingRefreshType: (2) IDR
\- IntraQPOffset and QPoffsets are set equal to 0

### 8.2.3 H.266/VVC Characterization against H.264/AVC
#### 8.2.3.1 Overview
This clause provides information related to the characterization of H.266/VVC
VTM against H.264/AVC JM according to clause 7.2.1. The results provided in
clauses 6 and 8.2.2 are considered for the characterization.
Analysis of the PSNR ranges provided in the clause 6 for H.264/AVC and in sub-
clauses 8.2.2 of the H.266/VVC shows that their rate distortion curves exhibit
an average overlap of 61% across scenarios. As a consequence, the aggregation
of results for all rate points for all sequences in each scenario is not
substantial enough and do not provide an accurate representation for codec
characterisation. BD rate gain are not reported in this clause.
A way to obtain a substantial overlap for accurate estimation of BD rate gain
estimates would be to adjust QP values of AVC for better alignments with the
ones of HEVC and VVC.
#### 8.2.3.2 Scenario 1: Full HD
This clause provides information related to the characterization of H.266/VVC
VTM mode configurations against H.264/AVC JM for Scenario 1 Full HD.

### 8.2.6 External subjective tests results
The document [61] reports verification test results comparing VVC to its
predecessor HEVC on ultra high definition (UHD, a.k.a. 4K, 3840×2160) standard
dynamic range (SDR) video content using formal subjective visual quality
assessment testing. The purpose of the verification test was to confirm that
the coding efficiency objective for the VVC standard has been met achieving a
substantial bit-rate reduction for the same level of _subjective_ visual
quality relative to the HEVC Main Profile. As anticipated in the test plan, in
addition to using the HM reference software encoder for HEVC and the VTM
reference software encoder for VVC, which used essentially the same rate-
distortion optimization encoding techniques, another VVC encoder that uses
alternative techniques for subjective quality optimization and faster encoding
had also become available for study and was included in the test -- namely the
VVenC open-source VVC encode [62]. The VVenC encoder, although still a
preliminary implementation produced only two months following the completion
of the standard, was used to represent an example of practical encoding as may
be found in product implementations and is reported to be more than 100 times
faster than the VTM encoder [63]. The compression performance of the HEVC
reference software HM-16.22, the VVC reference software VTM-10.0, and the
open-source VVC implementation VVenC-0.1.0, were compared for UHD SDR content
using a random-access (RA) configuration suitable for streaming or broadcast
applications.
The testing used the degradation category rating (DCR) test method (as in
ITU-T P.910) [64] with an 11-point impairment scale (as in Rec. ITU-R BT.500).
The results of a visual assessment of VVC compared to HEVC by naïve test
subjects are reported. The assessment included five test sequences encoded in
a random-access configuration with a random-access interval of 1.07 seconds.
The measured mean opinion score (MOS) figures indicate a significant
improvement of VVC relative to HEVC for both VVC implementations, VTM-10.0 and
VVenC-0.1.0, resulting in overall average bit-rate savings estimates of 43%
and 49%, respectively.
The SDR UHD subjective test was carried out at the following test sites:
  * GBTech, Rome, IT
  * RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, DE
The arrangements for the two test sites are shown in Table 8.2.4-1.

Additional verification tests for HDR UHD, SDR HD and 360° omnidirectional
video were perfomed in JVET.
UHD HDR video verification test results are reported in the JVET-W2020
document [71]:
  * Test was performed using 10 UHD, with 3840x2160 resolution, HDR sequences. 5 sequences were in Hybrid-Log Gamma (HLG) HDR format and 5 were in Perceptual Quantizer (PQ) HDR format.
  * Encoders were configured using random access settings.
  * VVC (using VTM-12.0 encoder) resulted in overall average bit-rate saving of 49% for HLG content and of 51% for PQ content over HEVC (using HM-16.23 encoder).

## 8.3 Essential Video Coding (EVC)
### 8.3.1 Overview
The development of the MPEG-5 Essential Video Coding (EVC) standard is
completed, and its specification has been published in October 2020 as ISO/IEC
23094-1 [50].
The main goal of the EVC standard is to provide significantly improved
compression capability over previous generation of video coding standards with
timely publication of commercial terms. The EVC standard has been developed to
provide a video codec for emerging delivery protocols and networks, such as
5G, enabling the delivery of high-quality video services to an ever-growing
audience by providing improved coding performance.
The MPEG-5 EVC defines two important profiles, \"Baseline\" profile and
\"Main\" profile. It was the design objective that the \"Baseline\" profile
contains only technologies that are older than 20 years. The \"Main\" profile
includes additional tools, each of which can be either cleanly disabled or
switched to the corresponding baseline tool on an individual basis.
Additionally, for still image coding, \"Main Still Picture\" and \"Baseline
Still Picture\" profiles, which employ the same coding tools as in the
corresponding video profiles, are defined.
MPEG has completed the EVC verification tests for HDR and SDR content with
formal subjective testing showing that for equal subjective video quality, the
EVC reference encoder using the EVC Main profile can achieve significant bit-
rate reduction compared to the HEVC reference encoder using the HEVC Main 10
profile. These tests also demonstrated that the EVC reference encoder using
the EVC Baseline profile can achieve similar bit-rate reduction compared to
the AVC reference encoder using the AVC Progressive High 10 profile. Such
analysis was performed using MOS BD-rate calculations.
The verification test conditions and results for SDR content are reported in
[52]. The average bitrate savings for the EVC reference encoder using the EVC
Main profile compared to the HEVC reference encoder using the HEVC Main 10
profile are approximately 39% for UHD SDR content, encoded using the random
access configuration, and approximately 41% for HD SDR content, encoded using
the low delay configuration. The average bit rate savings for the EVC
reference encoder using the EVC Baseline profile compared to the AVC reference
encoder using the AVC Progressive High 10 profile are approximately 39% for
the UHD SDR content, encoded using the random access configuration, and
approximately 34% for HD SDR content, encoded using the low delay
configuration.
The verification test conditions and results for HDR content are reported in
[53]. For random access configuration, the EVC reference encoder using the EVC
Main profile provides around 36% bitrate reduction for HDR content at UHD
resolution and 35% bitrate reduction for HDR content at HD resolution compared
to the HEVC reference encoder with HDR/WCG encoder optimizations enabled,
using the HEVC Main 10 profile, for equal subjective video quality.
Application areas especially targeted for the use of EVC include ultra-high
definition 4K and 8K video, video with a high dynamic range and wide colour
gamut, and video for immersive media applications such as 360° omnidirectional
video, as well as conventional standard-definition and high-definition video
content.
### 8.3.2 Test Configurations and Results for EVC
#### 8.3.2.1 Introduction
This clause provides test setups, configurations and results for EVC.
The reference software for MPEG-5 EVC is called is called ETM (EVC Test
Model). The ETM software is maintained and can be downloaded from the
repository: https://github.com/MPEGGroup/MPEG-EVC-ETM.
ETM configuration parameters have been chosen to closely match those used by
the corresponding HM configuration files. More specifically,
  1. The output bit-depth is always set to 10 so that the metrics calculation can be performed at bit-depth of 10.
  2. The per frame QP values are specified to be aligned with the settings of the HM anchor.
  3. The reference frames are specified to be aligned with the settings of the HM anchor.
Details that are specific to a particular scenario are described in the
corresponding sections. The proposed EVC configuration files are attached to
this document.

### 8.3.3 EVC Characterization against H.264/AVC
#### 8.3.3.1 Overview
This clause provides information related to the characterization of EVC
against H.264/AVC according to clause 7.2.1. The results provided in clauses 6
and 8.3.2 are considered for the characterization.
Analysis of the PSNR ranges provided in the clause 6 for H.264/AVC and in sub-
clauses 8.3.2 of the EVC shows that their rate distortion curves exhibit an
average overlap of 70% across scenarios. As a consequence, the aggregation of
results for all rate points for all sequences in each scenario is not
substantial enough and do not provide an accurate representation for codec
characterisation. BD rate gain are not reported in this clause.
A way to obtain a substantial overlap for accurate estimation of BD rate gain
estimates would be to adjust QP values of AVC for better alignments with the

## 8.4 AOMedia Video 1 (AV1)
### 8.4.1 Overview
AV1 (AOMedia Video 1) [68] is a video coding format developed by the Alliance
for Open Media (AOMedia). AOMedia is a consortium founded in 2015 that, in
July 2021, includes 47 companies from across the web media ecosystem,
including semiconductor developers, video on demand providers, video content
producers, software development companies and web browser vendors. In addition
to the AV1 bitstream specification, AOMedia makes available a reference
software implementation of the AV1 video codec [69].
AV1 is used today to implement some of the relevant 5G video service scenarios
listed in clause 6. Some of the references documenting motivation for the
4K-TV scenario (clause 6.3.1 [17] [18] [19] [20]) and the Screen Content
Scenario (clause 6.4.1 [26] [41]) discuss implementations that support AV1
today.
AV1 was designed to support features required by real-time applications,
including high resolutions, high dynamic range, wide colour gamut formats and
high frame rates. It fully supports the ITU-R BT.2100 recommendation [16], as
well as static and dynamic metadata for HDR applications, such as the HDR10+
format. It can also support up to 12 bits of precision per colour sample as
well as the 4:4:4 chroma sampling format.
AV1 defines three profiles for decoders. The "Main", "High" and "Professional"
profiles, specified in Annex A of [68]. The "Main" profile allows for a bit
depth of 8 bits or 10 bits per sample with 4:0:0 (greyscale) and 4:2:0
(quarter) chroma sampling. The "High" profile further adds support for 4:4:4
chroma sampling (no subsampling). The "Professional" profile extends
capabilities to fully support 4:0:0, 4:2:0, 4:2:2 (half) and 4:4:4 chroma sub-
sampling with 8-, 10-, and 12-bit colour depths.
### 8.4.2 Test Configurations and Results for AV1
#### 8.4.2.1 Introduction
The reference software for AV1 is built from the AV1 codec library (libaom).
It is used to build two applications -- aomenc and aomdec. General
instructions for building libaom can be found here:
[https://aomedia.googlesource.com/aom#building-the-library-and-
applications]{.underline}
The AV1 codec library has multiple configuration options. These come in two
varieties - build system configuration options and codec configuration
options. Both option types are set at built time. The configurations to be
used for 3GPP testing are:
-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
-DCONFIG_DOCS=0
-DCONFIG_SHARED=0
-DENABLE_TESTS=0
-DCONFIG_UNIT_TESTS=0
-DCONFIG_AV1_HIGHBITDEPTH=1
The libaom implementation provided for the tests depends on the scenario and
is documented individually for each scenario.
Several changes had to be introduced to the libaom reference software to match
the requirements and needs of 3GPP and for this test. A specific release of
that software containing these changes, which should be used for the 3GPP
testing, can be found by using the following git release tag:
> 3gpp-2021-10-15-4
The AV1 encoder that is built using the AV1 libraries is aomenc. Command line
options are used to configure the encoding performed by aomenc. A complete
description of all command line options used to generate the bitstreams
referenced in this technical report can be found here [74].
Depending on the testing scenario, libaom needs to be configured differently
with appropriate command line configuration settings [73]. Such configuration
settings are documented individually and provided in independent Linux shell
script files for convenience. These attached configuration scripts take
arguments to generate the tuples. For example, S1-AV1-01.sh, S5-AV1-SCC-01.sh,
etc. Arguments to be used with each configuration script are listed in the
sections, below.
Note that based on the general configuration restrictions in clause 5.6 and
the permitted use of residual energy/distortion-based decisions that can adapt
the coding type of the current frame, overlay frames in AV1 are permitted.
Table 8.4.2.1-1 provides the common command line options used by all of AV1
configuration file scripts, along with an explanation of their use.

For both SDR and HDR the following common Scenario 2 command line options are
provided in Table 8.4.2.3.2-1.
Table 8.4.2.3.2-1 Common Scenario 2 command line options
.
+----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | --auto-alt-ref=1 | parameter to specify how | | | alternative reference frames are | | | determined in random access | | | configuration. only 1 is | | | supported. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | --lag-in-frames=35 | This parameter is typically set | | | to be the sub-GOP size + 3. | | | Since sub-GOP size for random | | | access is 32, this parameter is | | | set to be 35. | | | | | | This command line argument to | | | the configuration script | | | represents the maximum number of | | | input frames to buffer or look | | | ahead. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | --use-fixed-qp-offsets=1 | use fixed ratios to determine | | | the QP for frames at different | | | hierarchical layers. In av1 | | | encoder, cq-level specified is | | | only used for the frames at the | | | highest temporal layer | | | (non-reference frames), for Key | | | frames and Inter frames at other | | | layers, a fixed ratio is used to | | | determine the quantization | | | parameter. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | --fwd-kf-dist=\ | This command line argument to | | | the configuration script is only | | | used in open GOP scenarios. It | | | sets the distance between | | | successive forward keyframes. | | | Hierarchical prediction is | | | enabled when sub-GOP size and | | | hierarchical layers are | | | specified through other | | | parameters. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | --min-gf-interval=32 | Set the GOPSize to 32 for all | | --max-gf-interval=32 | random-access content. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | --enable-intrabc=0 | Disable the intra block copy | | | prediction mode. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+ | --enable-palette=0 | Disable the palette prediction | | | mode. | +----------------------------------+----------------------------------+
IntraPeriod: Intra Period aligned with GOPSize such that approximately 1
second is achieved, i.e.
  * \"frameRate\": 23.98 or 24.0 or 25 or 30 => IntraPeriod set to 32,
  * \"frameRate\": 50.0 or 59.94 or 60 => IntraPeriod set to 64
##### 8.4.2.3.3 S2-AV1-01: SDR Settings
For SDR content the following command line option is used.
* * *
\--deltaq-mode=0 disable block based adaptive quantization, so all blocks
within a frame use the same quantization parameter
* * *
The following command line is used for all SDR encodes:
S2-AV1-01.sh \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
##### 8.4.2.3.4 S2-AV1-02: HDR PQ Settings
For SDR content the following command line option is used.
* * *
\--deltaq-mode=5 enable chroma QP offset adjustment for HDR video. Only frame
level chroma QP offset is enabled. \--chroma-sample-position=colocated specify
chroma sample position to be colocated
* * *
The following command line is used for all HDR encodes

### 8.4.3 AV1 Characterization against H.264/AVC
#### 8.4.3.1 Overview
This clause provides information related to the characterization of AV1
against H.264/AVC according to clause 7.2.1. The results provided in clauses 6
and 8.4.2 are considered for the characterization.
The results in clause 6 for the anchor are not verified.
Analysis of the PSNR ranges provided in the clause 6 for H.264/AVC and in sub-
clauses 8.2.2 of the AV1 shows that their rate distortion curves exhibit an
average overlap of 50% across scenarios. As a consequence, the aggregation of
results for all rate points for all sequences in each scenario is not
substantial enough and do not provide an accurate representation for codec
characterisation. BD rate gain are not reported in this clause.
A way to obtain a substantial overlap for accurate estimation of BD rate gain
estimates would be to adjust QP values of AVC and AV1 for better alignments
with the ones of HM.
#### 8.4.3.2 Scenario 1: Full HD
This clause provides information related to the characterization of AV1 libaom
mode configurations against H.264/AVC JM for Scenario 1 Full HD.
For this scenario, the PSNR ranges of the curves between AV1 and H.264/AVC
overlaps at an average of at 53% and can be as low as 21%. Details on overlap
values can be found here: https://dash-large-
files.akamaized.net/WAVE/3GPP/5GVideo/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/AV1/Characterization/.
#### 8.4.3.3 Scenario 3: Screen Content
This clause provides information related to the characterization of AV1 libaom
mode configurations against H.264/AVC JM for Scenario 3 Screen Content.
For this scenario, the PSNR ranges of the curves between AV1 and H.264/AVC
overlaps at an average of at 34 % and can be as low as 29 % in the non-RA
configuration and an average of 77 % and can be as low as 69 % in the RA
configuration. Details on overlap values can be found here: https://dash-

mode configurations against H.264/AVC JM for Scenario 4 Messaging and Social
Sharing.
For this scenario, the PSNR ranges of the curves between AV1 and H.264/AVC
overlaps at an average of at 46% and can be as low as 30% in the non-RA
configuration and an average of 57% and can be as low as 51% in the RA
configuration. Details on overlap values can be found here: https://dash-
large-

#### 8.4.3.5 Scenario 5: Online Gaming
This clause provides information related to the characterization of AV1 libaom
mode configurations against H.264/AVC JM for Scenario 5 Online Gaming.
For this scenario, the PSNR ranges of the curve between AV1 and H.264/AVC
overlaps at an average of at 40% and can be as low as 25% in the non-RA
configuration and an average of 59% and can be as low as 54% in the RA
configuration. Details on overlap values can be found here: https://dash-
large-
files.akamaized.net/WAVE/3GPP/5GVideo/Bitstreams/Scenario-5-Gaming/AV1/Characterization/.

# 9 Gaps and Optimization Potential
## 9.1 Identified Gaps and Deficiencies with Existing Codecs
Based on the scenarios that were defined in this Technical Report, the
existing 3GPP codecs H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC have been benchmarked and
evaluated.
H.264/AVC is still widely used in services and due to its install base and
ubiquity remains a fallback solution for basic use cases. However, H.264/AVC
clearly lacks compression efficiency and flexibility to address more advanced
use cases, such as HDR, gaming sequences and screen content sharing.
H.265/HEVC provides, at least for the considered scenarios, a full feature set
and is broadly and versatilely applicable. As H.265/HEVC is part of 3GPP
specifications since quite some time, its install base has matured and is
almost ubiquitous.
Based on this, a successor to H.264/AVC or H.265/HEVC would be interesting if
it provides greater flexibility and feature set coverage with improved
compression efficiency over H.265/HEVC.
The performance of H.265/HEVC for higher spatial resolutions, such as 8K, has
not been evaluated.
## 9.2 Potential Requirements for New Codecs
From the collected scenarios, no explicit new requirements for new codecs have
been identified.
However, flexibility to different applications, feature coverage and
compression efficiency are key functionalities for a codec in 3GPP. A new
codec is expected to differentiate from H.265/HEVC in at least one, preferably
several dimensions.
It is encouraged to study in more details on potential requirements for new
codecs.
# 10 Conclusions and Proposed Next Steps
The Technical Report provides a full characterization framework for video
codecs in the context of 5G services. This framework permits the evaluation of
the performance of existing 3GPP codecs, and also permits the identification
of potential benefits of new codecs.
The framework fulfils the following aspects:
  * A comprehensive set of scenarios relevant to 3GPP services is described in clause 6. For each scenario the anchor(s), the version of the reference software for the anchor(s), and their configuration(s) are defined.
  * A set of reference sequences is identified per scenario and each sequence is described in more details in Annex C.
  * For each scenario, one or more performance metrics are defined. Each metric is described in more details in clause 5.5
  * The overall characterization framework process is defined in clause 5 and in Annex B, D, E, F, and G.
  * New codecs are identified in clause 8. For each scenario, a version of their respective reference software is identified and configurations as close as possible to the anchor configurations are defined.
The framework clearly has some limitations; for example, encoder
configurations for each scenario may have not been stringent enough in the
definition, leading to results that may not be fully comparable. Further, the
encoders used for the evaluation of the various codecs have different maturity
and features. Results in this document should always be considered with
caution, and the reader should understand how these results were derived. The
framework does not include subjective evaluation; it is purely based on
objective metrics.
Results are complete for 3GPP codecs - H.264/AVC and H.265/HEVC - for all
scenarios.
One important outcome of the work documented in this Technical Report is the
characterization and evaluation of H.265/HEVC against relevant scenarios and
its characterization against H.264/AVC. Also, a first understanding of
H.265/HEVC performances versus new codecs was developed. From the scenarios
and results in this Technical Report it is observed that:
  * H.265/HEVC does not show any functional deficiencies or gaps, nor does it lack any relevant features.
  * In terms of compression efficiency, H.265/HEVC, evaluated based on the HM, performs sufficiently well for all the scenarios in this technical report.
Providing consistent HEVC-based interoperability in 3GPP services, for
traditional and new scenarios, is definitely beneficial. It is recommended
that 3GPP consider upgrading specifications to support profiles, levels, and
possibly features available in HEVC. Features may include better support for
screen content and computer-generated content, XR/AR type of services, as well
as low and very low latency services.
The framework and the initial results for new codecs, while demonstrating
coding performance improvements over H.265/HEVC, are not mature enough to
support concrete recommendations.
The potential addition of any new codec in 3GPP services and specifications
requires diligent preparation, including the identification of needs and
requirements for different scenarios, as well as a complete characterization
against existing codecs. The information in this TR, as well as any new
developments in 3GPP with respect to codecs in latest specifications, could
serve as a baseline for future work. Such an effort may lead to conclusions on
the potential addition of any new codec in 3GPP services and specifications.
However, no immediate need has been identified to initiate such follow-up
work.

All of the sequences are not of interest for compression evaluation. A
selection of some critical time intervals have been conducted based on
experience on compression. Especially intervals with fast or complex motion,
some including scene cuts, representative of TV contents have been selected.
Static pictures, or pictures with artistic intent with few spatial details
have been discarded. To remain in the scope of the scenario, the following sub
sequences have been selected as final candidates:
  * Lifting off: from 00:05 to 00:22
  * Indoor Soccer: from 01:07 to 01:23 (385 frames)
  * Eldorado: from 01:33 to 01:50
  * Moment of intensity: from 01:33 to 01:50
The extraction of subpart from original ProRes sequences is realized with
FFmpeg release 4.3.1 using the following command line:
./ffmpeg.exe -i \$IN.mov -vcodec rawvideo -ss \$START_TIME -t \$DURATION
-pix_fmt yuv420p10le \$OUT.yuv
Where \$IN and \$OUT are respectively the input and output sequences,
\$START_TIME and \$DURATION respectively the start time and duration in
hh:mm:ss format.
### C.3.1.2 Test Sequence Selection Process
#### C.3.1.2.1 Introduction
In order to decide which sequences should be used in this specification, the
following process has been used:
1\. Run informative encoding using x265 on the candidate sequences
2\. Run SI-TI metrics computation on the candidate sequences
3\. Select two diverse datasets based on R-D and SI-TI information.
#### C.3.1.2.2 x265 Encoding
To represent candidate sequences in the R-D plane, fixed QP encodings are
carried out for QPs [12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42] using ffmpeg release 4.3.1,
with the following command line:
./ffmpeg.exe -pix_fmt yuv420p10le -s \$Wx\$H -framerate \$FR -i \$IN -vcodec
libx265 -qp \$QP -preset fast -x265-params "psnr=1:ssim=1" \$OUT.mp4
Where \$W and \$H are respectively the sequence width and height, \$FR the
sequence frame rate, \$QP the selected quantization parameter. \$IN and \$OUT
are respectively the input and output files.
From the obtained log, the overall bitrate and PSNR are extracted to be used
for plotting. The encoding result are presented below:
  * Figure 3.1.2.2-1 provides the R-D curves for the UVG dataset,
  * Figure 3.1.2.2-2 provides the R-D curves for the JVET dataset,
  * Figure 3.1.2.2-3 provides the R-D curves for the Netflix dataset,
  * Figure 3.1.2.2-4 provides the R-D curves for the EBU, SVT and 4ever dataset,
  * Figure 3.1.2.2-5 provides the R-D curves for the CableLabs dataset.

#### C.3.1.2.3 SI-TI Metrics
The analysis is based on spatial perceptual information (SI) and temporal
perceptual information (TI) metrics calculated as defined in ITU-P.910
recommendation [40]. In order to reduce the bias introduced by scene-cuts in
TI metric computation, the TI at scene-cut boundaries are removed from
computation.
From the obtained log, the SI and TI metrics are presented below:

#### C.3.1.2.4 SDR Sequence Selection
The first step consists in classifying the sequences in two categories: easy
and challenging. This reflects the complexity of the sequences from an
encoding perspective. Based on the R-D data, the QP points covering the
application range [10-40] Mbps are identified. For the lower (10Mbps) and
higher (40Mbps) boundaries, a linear interpolation is achieved between the two
closest QP points to estimate the distortion at the boundaries: D_10 and D_40.
If the distortion difference D_DIFF=(D_40-D_10) is less than or equal to a
threshold Thr=1.5, then the sequence is classified as follows:
\- Low-dynamic: the PSNR dynamic on the application bitrate range is limited
\- High-dynamic: the PSNR dynamic on the application bitrate range is high
The results of this first classification step are reported in Table
C.3.2.1.4-1.

[10-40] Mbps range, Thr=1.5

It is observed that 26 sequences are classified as \"High\" while 19 are
\"Low\". In order to keep sequences that are relevant for a codec
characterization, the low-dynamic sequences are removed. Then, the next step
consists in removing sequences having some similarities, using SI-TI
information computed in clause C.3.1.2.3. The sequences are represented below
in the SI-TI plane with a k-means clustering to help the decision.
{width="6.699305555555555in" height="3.410416666666667in"}
Figure C.3.1.2.4-1: SI-TI clustering for the Challenging sequences (10
clusters)
In order to remain representative in the sense of sources origin, format, and
SI-TI values, the following approach was taken:
\- 1 sequence (out of 6) from the C2 cluster (EBU: Rain-fruits)
\- 1 sequence (out of 4) from the C3 cluster (CableLabs: Soccer)
\- 2 sequences (out of 8) from the C4 cluster (Netfllix: ToddlerFountain,
Boat)
\- 1 sequence (out of 1) from the C5 cluster (UVG: Riverbank)
\- 1 sequence (out of 2) from the C6 cluster (Netflix: TunnelFlag)
\- 1 sequence (out of 1) from the C8 cluster (SVT: ParkJoy)
\- 1 sequence (out of 1) from the C10 cluster (4ever: Brest-Sedof)
The following eight sequences are selected:
\- 1 From 4ever: Brest-Sedof (3840x2160p 60fps)
\- 1 From EBU: RainFruits (3840x2160p 50fps)
\- 1 From SVT: ParkJoy (3840x2160p 50fps)
\- 1 From CableLabs: Soccer (3840x2160p 23.98fps)

The clip cosmos_aom_12025-12075 being fifty frames duration, it is removed
from the selection process and is not considered. In order to use these
sequences for the selection process, a conversion into the appropriate format
is conducted using FFmpeg and HDRTools [67] software v0.21. The conversion
according to Figure C.3.2.1.2-1 conducted:
{width="5.885416666666667in" height="0.44459208223972in"}
Figure C.3.2.1.2-1: Processing pipeline for AOM sequence conversion
In the first step FFMPEG was used to decode JPEG 2000 sequences and store in
uncompressed TIFF format. The following command line was used:
> FFMPEG -i \$INPUT.j2k -compression_algo raw -pix_fmt rgb48le \$OUTPUT.tiff
HDRConvert was used to convert the sequences from P3-D65 RGB 12 bit to Rec.
BT.2100 10 bit YCbCr 4:2:0. HDRConvert config file used for this process is
attached to this contribution.
#### C.3.2.1.3 CableLabs Sequences
The CableLabs dataset is composed by one HDR sequence described in Table
C.3.2.1.3-1. The sequence can be used under the CC BY-NC-ND 3.0 license
restriction.

For this sequence, a selection of some critical time intervals have been
conducted based on experience on compression. Especially intervals with fast
or complex motion, representative of TV contents have been selected. Static
pictures, or pictures with artistic intent with few spatial details have been
discarded. To remain in the scope of the scenario, the following section have
been selected:
  * Life Untouched 1: 0.5s-8s
The extraction of subpart from original ProRes sequences is realized with
FFmpeg release 4.3.1 using the following command line:
> ./ffmpeg.exe -i \$IN.mov -vcodec rawvideo -ss \$START_TIME -t \$DURATION
> -pix_fmt yuv444p12le \$OUT.yuv
Where \$IN and \$OUT are respectively the input and output sequences,
\$START_TIME and \$DURATION respectively the start time and duration in
hh:mm:ss format.
In order to map the colour into a BT.2020 colour container, HDRTools v2.1 has
been used. In the first step conversion from YCbCr 4:4:4 to RGB color space
was performed. In the second step conversion from P3-D65 RGB to 10-bit YCbCr
4:2:0 was performed. Both configuration files for HDRTools are attached to
this report.
### C.3.2.2 Selected Test Sequences
#### C.3.2.2.1 Introduction
In order to decide which sequences should be used in this specification a
similar process as the SDR one is used. The following process is conducted:
  1. Run informative encoding using x265 on the converted candidate sequences
  2. Run SI-TI metrics computation on the converted candidate sequences
  3. Run codeword histogram computation on the converted candidate sequences
  4. Select diverse datasets based on R-D, SI-TI and codewords distribution.
#### C.3.2.2.2 x265 Encoding
To represent candidate sequences in the R-D plane, fixed QP encodings are
carried out for QPs [12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42,5 1] using ffmpeg release
4.3.1, with the following command line:
> ./ffmpeg.exe -pix_fmt yuv420p10le -s \$Wx\$H -framerate \$FR -i \$IN -vcodec
> libx265 -qp \$QP -preset fast -x265-params "psnr=1:ssim=1" \$OUT.mp4
Where \$W and \$W are respectively the sequence width and height, \$FR the
sequence frame rate, \$QP the selected quantization parameter. \$IN and \$OUT
are respectively the input and output files.
From the obtained log, the overall bitrate and PSNR are extracted to be used
for plotting. The encoding result are presented in

#### C.3.2.2.3 SI-TI Metrics
The analysis is based on spatial perceptual information (SI) and temporal
perceptual information (TI) metrics calculated as defined in ITU-P.910
recommendation [40]. In order to reduce the bias introduced by scene-cuts in
TI metric computation, the TI at scene-cut boundaries are removed from
computation.

#### C.3.2.2.5 HDR Sequence Selection
The first step consists in classifying the sequences in two categories: easy
and challenging. This reflects the complexity of the sequences from an
encoding perspective. Based on the R-D data, the QP points covering the
application range [10-40] Mbps are identified. For the lower (10Mbps) and
higher (40Mbps) boundaries, a linear interpolation is achieved between the two
closest QP points to estimate the distortion at the boundaries: D_10 and D_40.
If the distortion difference D_DIFF=(D_40-D_10) is less than or equal to a
threshold Thr=3, then the sequence is classified as follows:
  * Low-dynamic: the PSNR dynamic on the application bitrate range is limited
  * High-dynamic: the PSNR dynamic on the application bitrate range is > high
The results of this first classification step is reported in the Table
C.3.2.2.5-1.

46.34 51.26 4.91 High
It is observed that 14 sequences are classified as \"High\" while 23 are
\"Low\". In order to keep sequences that are relevant for a codec
characterization, the low-dynamic sequences are removed. To select a data set
having different sources, LifeUntouched_1 is automatically selected since it
is the only complex one in CableLabs set. Similarly, the sequence
meridian_aom_22412-22738 from Meridian which is most challenging from an
encoding perspective is selected.
Then, the next step consists in selecting a subset of remaining sequences in
order to end up with a reasonable number of sequences, from diverse sources
and having different characteristics. With the target of selecting the same
number of sequences as SDR, the remaining set of sequences are clustered into
the SI-TI plane, using k-mean clustering to identify sequences having same
spatial and temporal features. Since two sequences have already been selected,
and given that eight sequences are targeted, six clusters are identified in
the figure below.
{width="5.739583333333333in" height="3.0416666666666665in"}
Figure C.3.2.2.5-1: SI-TI clustering for the challenging HDR sequences (6
clusters)
It is observed that clusters C3 and C4 only contain one sequence each, which
are automatically selected since they present interesting codewords
distribution and content. For other clusters, the codeword histograms are used
to help deciding which sequence should be selected.
For C5, sparks_aom_2024-2455 is selected since it presents interesting
codewords distribution compared to what is already included in the figure
above.
For C1, sol_levante_aom_289-453 is rejected since it is similar to the cosmos
sequence. In the two remaining sequences, nocturne_aom_32660-32799 is too
short in duration while nocturne_aom_23820-24322 does not present particular
interest due to a static long dark transition part in the middle. Thus, no
sequences are selected from C1.
For C6, sol_levante sequences are removed since two computer-generated
sequences are already selected. sparks_aom_5764-6024 is selected to make the
dataset more diverse in terms of codeword distributions.
For C2, cosmos_aom_1573-1749 is removed since two computer-generated sequences
are already selected. For the sake of having diverse sources,
nocturne_aom_27740-28109 is selected since two sparks sequences are already
selected.
Eventually, the selected sequences are summarized below:
\- LifeUntouched1 (0-479)
\- meridian_aom_22412-22738
\- sol_levante_aom_2268-2412
\- cosmos_12149-12330

## C.3.3 HFR Category
No test sequences are yet defined.
# C.4 HD Test Sequences
## C.4.1 Overview
For FullHD test sequences, downsampled versions of the 4K Sequences as
introduced in C.3.1 and C.3.2 are used.
# C.5 Messaging Sequences
## C.5.1 Overview
### C.5.1.1 Candidate Sequences
Several candidate sequences have been checked from:
https://media.xiph.org/video/av2/. This clause provides an overview on the
characteristics of the selected sequences in Annex C.5.2 to Annex
C.5.5.Original sequences are available in y4m format which stores uncompressed
YCbrCr data. Conversion from y4m to YCbCr 4:2:0 is done using the following
ffmpeg command (sequences are SDR therefore chroma downsampling is performed
in ffmpeg):
> ./ffmpeg.exe -i \$IN -vcodec rawvideo -video_size \$Wx\$H -pix_fmt yuv420p
> \$OUT.yuv
Where \$W and \$H are respectively the sequence width and height, and \$IN and
\$OUT are respectively the input and output files.
### C.5.1.2 x265 encodings
To represent candidate sequences in the R-D plane, fixed QP encodings are
carried out for QPs [12, 17, 22, 27, 32, 37, 42, 47] using ffmpeg release
4.3.1, with the following command line:
./ffmpeg.exe -pix_fmt yuv420p -s \$Wx\$H -framerate \$FR -i \$IN -vcodec
libx265 -qp \$QP -preset fast -x265-params "psnr=1:ssim=1" \$OUT.mp4
Where \$W and \$H are respectively the sequence width and height, \$FR the
sequence frame rate, \$QP the selected quantization parameter. \$IN and \$OUT
are respectively the input and output files.

[[CHART]]{.chart}
Figure C. 5.1.3-2: R-D curves for 4K sequences.C.5.1.3 Visual analysis
Visual analysis of the sequences was performed to check quality of the sources
in terms of compression artefacts from previous compression stages. For the
selected sequences no obvious compression artifacts were noticed. Analysis of
compressed bitstreams was performed to assert that quality degradation is
introduced with decreasing bitrates.
It was noticed that Vertical Walking sequence was very noisy, and this had an
impact on resulting bitrates. In addition, the sequence suffered from
jerkiness at the beginning on the sequence (presumably due to man walking) and
a strange lighting artifact towards the end of the sequence. Therefore, it is
recommended to use an extract from the middle of the clip (between 9^th^ and
14^th^ second) which does not suffer from those impairments.
For the Neon 4K sequence it was noticed that there was fairly constant
movement in the captured scene therefore it is recommended to use an extract
of 5 seconds (first 5 seconds) to reduce codec simulation time.

## C.6.5 Graphics Mix Transition
### C.6.5.1 Introduction
The sequence _GraphicsMixTransition_ is the same sequence as
_GraphicsMixSimple_ described in clause C.6.4, except the fact that 1s long
transitions have been inserted composed of 3 slides containing different types
of graphics. The 3 slides appear once each during 3.33s. Transitions are
fading and page turning in between. The sequence has been generated in 4K
resolution at 60 frames per second with an authoring tool and exported into
Apple ProRes 422 before being converted into YUV4:2:0. The figure C.6.5.1-1 is
a screenshot of each of the 3 scenes contained in the _GraphicsMixTransition_
test sequence.

## E.2.3 installation
### E.2.3.1 cloning
    git clone https://github.com/haudiobe/5GVideo 
    cd 5GVideo
Please use a python virtual environment to install dependencies and run the
scripts.
install python dependencies:
    pip3 install -r src/requirements.txt
### E.2.3.2 working directory
The scripts assume you have a local directory where content has been
downloaded from: https://dash-large-files.akamaized.net/WAVE/3GPP/5GVideo/ or
follows that structure.
No default value is provided for the path to the working directory, it must be
supplied explicitely by one of these 2 means: - the scripts accept a
`--working-dir` argument to supply the path. - the `VCC_WORKING_DIR`
environment variable is used to configure the location of that directory
### E.2.3.3 download content from server
to download anchors, bitstreams, metrics, encoder configs, & reference
sequence list for a given scenario:
    python3 src/download.py streams https://dash-large-files.akamaized.net/WAVE/3GPP/5GVideo/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/264/streams.csv $VCC_WORKING_DIR/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/264
to download anchors reference sequences for a csv list:
    python3 src/download.py sequences $VCC_WORKING_DIR/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/reference-sequences.csv $VCC_WORKING_DIR/ReferenceSequences
## E.2.4 vcc.py script usage
### E.2.4.1 Overview
`src/vcc.py` provides the commands to encode, decode, and compute metrics.
All the commands described below have a common usage pattern.
### E.2.4.2 processing all QPs of an anchor
    python3 src/vcc.py [--dry-run] -s S1-A01-264 decode
the scripts parses `-s S1-A01-264`, finds `Scenario-1-FHD/265/streams.csv`,
and processes **all QPs** listed for `S1-A01-264`.
### E.2.4.3 processing a single QP for an anchor
    python3 src/vcc.py [--dry-run] -s S1-A01-264-22 decode
the scripts works as described above, but will only process a **single QP** \-
in this case: **22**.
### E.2.4.4 process all anchors for a given encoder config
#### E.2.4.4.1 general
    python3 src/metrics.py [--dry-run] -c S1-JM-01 decode
the scripts parses `-c S1-JM-01`, finds `Scenario-1-FHD/264/streams.csv`, then
processes **all QPs,** for **all anchors** where the encoder config is
`S1-JM-01`.
    encode, decode, convert, metrics subcommands follow
#### E.2.4.4.2 common options
  * `--dry-run`: does not execute the subprocesses, but instead prints the corresponding commands to stdout.
  * `--queue`: advanced - pushes the commands as tasks to a worker queue using the celery framework, instead of processing sequentialy. This option is meant to be used with the `sample docker-compose.yml` stack. See _Docker usage_ > _Using docker-compose_.
#### E.2.4.4.3 encode
    JM19_0_ENCODER=~/deps/JM/bin/lencod_static
    python3 src/vcc.py -s S1-A01-264 encode
_dry-run_ mode prints the command used to encode to stdout but doesn't run it,
but it does compute existing bitstream md5.
#### E.2.4.4.4 decode
    JM19_0_DECODER=~/deps/JM/bin/ldecod_static
    python3 src/vcc.py -s S1-A01-264 decode
_dry-run_ mode prints the command used to encode to stdout but doesn't run it,
but it does compute existing reconstruction md5.
#### E.2.4.4.5 convert
    HDRCONVERT_TOOL=~/deps/HDRTools/build/bin/HDRConvert
    python3 src/vcc.py -s S1-A01-264 decode --reference
    python3 src/vcc.py -s S1-A01-264 decode --reconstructions
Performs conversion needed before metrics computation using HDRTools'
HDRConvert.
when --reconstructions is specfied, the reconstructions for all QPs are
processed. when --reference is specified, the reference sequence is processed
instead.
Conversion is either be 8 to 10 bit YUV, or YUV to EXR. **When conversion is
not needed for a given sequence, the script does nothing.**
The converted sequences are stored in a tmp subfolder for each anchor.
_dry-run_ mode prints the command used to convert to stdout but doesn't run
it.
#### E.2.4.4.6 metrics
##### E.2.4.4.6.1 storage
when running the metrics command, the result is stored in the json file.
##### E.2.4.4.6.2 image quality metrics
    HDRMETRICS_TOOL=~/deps/HDRTools/build/bin/HDRMetrics
    VMAF_EXE=~/deps/vmaf/libvmaf/build/tools/vmafossexec
    VMAF_MODEL=/home/deps/vmaf/model/vmaf_v0.6.1.json
    python3 src/vcc.py -s S1-A01-264 metrics
Computes metrics for the given sequence. This step also computes bitrate after
removing SEI.
HDRTOOLS or VMAF can be enabled / disabled through environment variables.
    DISABLE_HDRMETRICS=1
    DISABLE_VMAF=1
This step is meant to run after successfull `conversion`. It uses the
converted sequence where appropriate, and raise an error if it doesn't exist.
_dry-run_ mode doesn't run HDRTools or vmaf, but it parses existing logs if
any.
##### E.2.4.4.6.3 bitrate / bitstream size
Bitstream size / bitrate is always computed when running metrics. It can be
computed explicitly as a separate step.
    python3 src/vcc.py -s S1-A01-264-22 bitrate
First, SEI_REMOVAL_APP is used if implemented by the encoder class. Then
bitrate is computed based on the resulting bitstream size, and the json
metadata are updated with the result.
##### E.2.4.4.6.4 metrics csv export
Metrics are saved on the anchors JSON file. A script can be used to export
them to .csv:
    python3 src/metrics.py -s S1-A01-264 csv-metrics
    python3 src/metrics.py -c S1-HM-02 csv-metrics
For the above commands, the metrics `.csv` files can then be found in:
`$VCC_WORKING_DIR/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/265/Metrics`
## E.2.5 characterization, rd curves plots, bd rate
The characterization script is meant to compare test data to an anchor. For
instance, to compare sequences `JM` and `HM` for `Scenario-1-FHD`, you should
have the following data:
    $VCC_WORKING_DIR/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/
    $VCC_WORKING_DIR/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/264/S1-A01-264.json
    $VCC_WORKING_DIR/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/264/streams.csv
    $VCC_WORKING_DIR/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/264/Metrics/S1-A01-264.csv
    [...]
    $VCC_WORKING_DIR/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/
    $VCC_WORKING_DIR/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/264/S1-A01-265.json
    $VCC_WORKING_DIR/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/265/streams.csv
    $VCC_WORKING_DIR/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/265/Metrics/S1-A01-264.csv
    [...]
To compare and plot psnr, y_psnr, and ms_ssim for these 2 sequences:
    python3 src/compare.py --plot -s S1-A01-264 S1-A01-265 psnr y_psnr ms_ssim
Assuming you have all the anchors for encoder config S1-JM-01 and S1-HM-01,
you can process them at once:
    python3 src/compare.py --plot -c S1-JM-01 S1-HM-01 psnr y_psnr ms_ssim
## E.2.6 using the scripts for metrics verification
### E.2.6.1 General
This guide provides step by step instructions to process with reconstruction
and metrics verifications.
### E.2.6.2 working directory
In this guide, `/data` will be the directory where reference content is
downloaded. All subsequent verification steps assume the `VCC_WORKING_DIR`
environment variable is set to `/data`.
### E.2.6.3 download bitstreams for verification
  1. download bitstreams and metadata for a given scenario
```{=html}
``` python3 src/download.py streams --bitstream https://dash-large-
files.akamaized.net/WAVE/3GPP/5GVideo/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/VTM/streams.csv

         |   └── S1-T11-VTM-37
        [...]
         └ S1-T17-VTM
  1. download reference sequences for that scenario
```{=html}
``` python3 src/download.py sequences
/data/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/reference-sequence.csv
/data/ReferenceSequences
    /data
      └ ReferenceSequences
        └ Life-Untouched
            Life-Untouched-FHD.json
            Life-Untouched-FHD.yuv
### E.2.6.4 reconstruction and metrics
#### E.2.6.4.1 generate reconstruction of bitstreams
reconstruct QP 22 for S1-T11-VTM
    python3 src/vcc.py decode -s S1-T11-VTM-22 decode
    /data/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD
     └── S1-T11-VTM
         └── S1-T11-VTM-22
             S1-T11-VTM-22.yuv
             S1-T11-VTM-22.dec.log
#### E.2.6.4.2 format conversion before metrics computation
In some cases, must process conversion from one representation to another
before. This 8 to 10 bit, 10 to 8 bit, and YUV to RGB444.
In the case of S1-T11-VTM, YUV to RGB444 needs to be performed on the
reference sequence as well as on the reconstructions to compute HDR metrics
using HDRTools.
Convert the reconstructions of the test scenario:
    python3 src/vcc.py -s S1-T11-VTM-22 convert --reconstructions
    /data/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD
     └── S1-T11-VTM

#### E.2.6.4.4 export metrics from .json to .csv
When computing metrics, results are stored in json metadata. After computing
metrics for all anchors of a given encoder configuration, the metrics are
exported to the appropriate csv format.
this is conveniently done for a set of all anchors with a given encoder
config:
    python3 src/metrics.py -c S1-VTM-O2 csv-metrics
    /data/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/Metrics
     └── ...
         S1-VTM-02.csv
but can also be done for individual anchor:
    python3 src/metrics.py -s S1-T11-VTM csv-metrics
    /data/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/Metrics
     └── S1-T11-VTM.csv
### E.2.6.5 generate verification report
#### E.2.6.5.1 general
to generate a verification report, we compare the local reconstruction and
metrics computed in the working directory, to the original data downloaded
from the server.
#### E.2.6.5.2 download the original metrics
create the directory `/data/Origin/Scenario-1-FHD/VTM` and download the
reference metrics there:
    python3 src/download.py streams --metrics https://dash-large-files.akamaized.net/WAVE/3GPP/5GVideo/Bitstreams/Scenario-1-FHD/VTM/streams.csv /data/Origin/Scenario-1-FHD/VTM
#### E.2.6.5.3 metrics verification
to generate a verification `verify-metrics` command of the `metrics.py`
script.
the following options are needed: - `-o` : the path to the directory
containing the original data to which localy computed results will be compared
- `-r` : the resulting report path is specific with
the metrics key on which the verification report should run are specified as
the last arguments. eg `psnr y_psnr` the following metrics keys are
implemented: _psnr, y_psnr, u_psnr, v_psnr, ms_ssim, vmaf, bitrate,
bitrate_log, wpsnr, y_wpsnr, u_wpsnr, v_wpsnr, psnr100, de100_
    python3 ./src/metrics.py -c S1-VTM-01 verify-metrics
        -o /data/origin
        -r /data/origin/s1-vtm-01-verification-report.csv
        --doc - --email foo@corp.com --company corp 
        y_psnr psnr
## E.2.7 docker usage
### E.2.7.1 General
All the dependencies in a single docker image.
### E.2.7.2 building the docker images
on linux: `./build.sh` (should work on mac as well) on windows: `.\build.ps1`
the build script builds several docker images: - `vcc:base` used as provides
common build environment, and metrics dependencies : HDRTools, vmaf. -
`vcc:jm`, `vcc:hm`, `vcc:etm`, `vcc:ctm`, `vcc:aom` builds the respective
reference encoders, decoders, and sei removal executable. - `vcc:worker`
copies pre-built binaries from the above images, supplies the appropriate
environment variables, adds the scripts & config folders.
build a specific image : `docker image ls` list docker images on your machine:
`docker image ls` remove a specific docker image: `docker image rm vcc:worker`
remove all docker image: `docker image rm vcc`
### E.2.7.3 using the worker image
The worker image is configured with `/data` as the root directory for all the
`ReferenceSequences` and `Bitstreams` directories. When running the worker
image; bitstreams and reference sequences must be mounted to the container
/data directroy, eg. using docker's `--mount` option.
    docker run -it --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/local/vcc_working_dir,target=/data" vcc:workers vcc.py -s S1-A01-264 decode
local `Bitstreams` and `ReferenceSequences` data may be organized arbitrarily
and mounted to the appropriate directory:
    docker run -it \
        --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/local/bitstreams_dir,target=/data/Bitstreams" \
        --mount type=bind,source=/path/to/local/sequences_dir,target=/data/ReferenceSequences" \
        vcc:workers vcc.py -s S1-A01-264 decode
### E.2.7.4 using docker-compose
A sample docker-compose is provided. It starts a background worker and a redis
queue. The `--queue` option of the `vcc.py` script can be used to add jobs to
the queue. The initial concurrency is set to 2 simultaneous jobs. Too high
value for concurrency may not be suitable for all tasks (eg. 4K encodes).
to use it, first configure local directories to mount using environment
variables: linux
    export VCC_BITSTREAMS_DIR=/path/to/local/bitstreams_dir
    export VCC_REFERENCES_DIR=/path/to/local/sequences_dir
windows
    $env:VCC_BITSTREAMS_DIR="c:\path\to\local\bitstreams_dir"
    $env:VCC_REFERENCES_DIR="c:\path\to\local\sequences_dir"
build workers:
    docker-compose build workers
then start the stack:
    docker-compose up -d
verify that all services are running:
    docker-compose ps
the queue can be monitored with a web browser at http://localhost:8888/
queue some tasks, eg. decode all anchors encoded with s1-jm-01.cfg:
    docker-compose exec worker python3 vcc.py --queue -c S1-JM-01 decode
