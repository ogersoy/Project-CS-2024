In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document

result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

## 4.1 Relation between the MSR specification and the single-RAT
specifications
The requirements for MSR are in most parts specified in the present document,
while many requirements are also specified through normative references to the
respective single-RAT specifications in [2], [3], [4], [5] and [17]. The
resulting set of requirements for an MSR BS can be divided into three types,
depending on their relation to the single-RAT specifications:
1\. **Generic MSR requirement:** A common generic requirement is specified in
the present document that applies for all RATs and for BS configured for both
multi-RAT and single-RAT operation. In some cases, there are additional
requirement(s) that apply only in some Band Category. There are no references
to the single-RAT specifications.
2\. **Generic MSR requirement, with additional single-RAT requirements:** A
common generic requirement is specified in the present document which applies
as in point 1. In addition, some single RAT requirement(s) apply, included by
normative reference(s) to the single-RAT specification(s).
3\. **Single-RAT only requirements:** In this case, no common generic
requirement is defined. The existing single-RAT requirement applies for each
RAT, included by normative reference(s) to the single-RAT specification(s).
The applicability of each requirement is described in clause 5.
## 4.2 Relationship between minimum requirements and test requirements
The Minimum Requirements given in this specification make no allowance for
measurement uncertainty. The test specification TS 37.141 [10] defines Test
Tolerances. These Test Tolerances are individually calculated for each test.
The Test Tolerances are used to relax the Minimum Requirements in this
specification to create Test Requirements. For some requirements, including
regulatory requirements, the test tolerance is set to zero.
For MSR single-RAT requirements, the principle used to define the test
requirement remains from the existing specifications.
For both MSR single-RAT and multi-RAT requirements, the measurement results
returned by the Test System are compared - without any modification - against
the Test Requirements as defined by the shared risk principle. The Shared Risk
principle is defined in ITU-R M.1545 [9].
## 4.3 Base station classes
The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area Base Stations,
Medium Range Base Stations and Local Area Base Stations unless otherwise
stated.
Wide Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Macro
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB. The Wide
Area Base Station class has the same requirements as the base station for
General Purpose application in Release 9 and 10.
Medium Range Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from
Micro Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equals to 53 dB.
Local Area Base Stations are characterised by requirements derived from Pico
Cell scenarios with a BS to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 45 dB.
For GSM/EDGE operation of an MSR BS, the requirements according to the
applicable multicarrier BTS class apply. The Wide Area BS, Medium Range BS and
Local Area BS in the present specification correspond to the Wide Area
multicarrier BTS, Medium Range multicarrier BTS and Local Area multicarrier
BTS respectively in the GSM/EDGE specifications. MSR requirements for multi-
RAT operation only apply for the highest GSM/EDGE static power step.
## 4.4 Regional requirements
Some requirements in the present document may only apply in certain regions
either as optional requirements, or set by local and regional regulation as
mandatory requirements. It is normally not stated in the 3GPP specifications
under what exact circumstances that the requirements apply, since this is
defined by local or regional regulation.
Table 4.4-1 lists all requirements in the present specification that may be
applied differently in different regions. There are additional single-RAT
regional requirements that may apply. These are referenced from the present
specification, but listed in the specification for the RATs concerned
[2][3][4][5][17].

spurious emissions limits shall be applied to the sum of the emission power
over all _antenna connectors_ 6.7.3, 6.7.4 Additional requirements These
requirements may apply in certain regions. 7.4.5 Additional BC3 blocking
minimum requirement This requirement may be applied for the protection of the
BS receiver when an MSR BS is operating in the same geographical area as UTRA
TDD. 7.5.2 Co-location requirement (blocking) These requirements may be
applied for the protection of the BS receiver when a BS operating in another
frequency band is co-located with an MSR BS.

## 4.5 Operating bands and Band Categories
MSR requirements are applicable for band definitions and band numbering as
defined in the specifications TS 45.005 [5], TS25.104 [2], TS 25.105 [3], TS
36.104 [4] and TS 38.104 [17]. For the purpose of defining the BS
requirements, the operating bands are divided into three band categories as
follows:
\- Band Category 1 (BC1): Bands for NR FDD, E-UTRA FDD and/or UTRA FDD
operation. Bands in this category are also used for NB-IoT operation (all
modes)

The downlink operating band is paired with the uplink operating band (external) of the carrier aggregation configuration that is supporting the configured Pcell. NOTE 2: For UTRA, the band is restricted to operation when dual band is configured (e.g., DB-DC-HSDPA or dual band 4C-HSDPA). The down link frequenc(ies) of this band are paired with the uplink frequenc(ies) of the other FDD band (external) of the dual band configuration. NOTE 3: For E-UTRA, the range 2180-2200 MHz of the DL operating band is restricted to operation when carrier aggregation is configured. NOTE 4: Band 23 is not applicable. NOTE 5: For E-UTRA, the range 2010-2020 MHz of the DL operating band is restricted to operation when carrier aggregation is configured, and TX-RX separation is 300 MHz. For E-UTRA, the range 2005-2020 MHz of the DL operating band is restricted to operation when carrier aggregation is configured, and TX-RX separation is 295 MHz. NOTE 6: DL operation is restricted to 1526-1536 MHz frequency range. UL operation is restricted to 1627.5 â€“ 1637.5 MHz and 1646.5 â€“ 1656.5 MHz per FCC Order DA 20-48. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
UTRA FDD can operate with DB-DC-HSDPA for the band configurations listed in
subclause 5.2 c) of TS 25.104 [2].

## 4.6 Channel arrangement
### 4.6.1 Channel spacing
The GSM/EDGE carrier spacing is 200 kHz [5].
The nominal UTRA FDD channel spacing is 5 MHz. The nominal channel spacing is
1.6MHz for the 1.28 Mcps UTRA TDD Option. These can be adjusted to optimise
performance in a particular deployment scenario [2,3].
In E-UTRA the spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario,
the size of the frequency block available and the channel bandwidths. The
nominal channel spacing between two adjacent E-UTRA carriers is defined as
following:
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted to optimize
performance in a particular deployment scenario [4].
The standalone NB-IoT carrier spacing is 200kHz.
In NR the spacing between carriers will depend on the deployment scenario, the
size of the frequency block available and the _BS channel bandwidths_. The
nominal channel spacing between two adjacent NR carriers is defined as
following:
\- For NR FR1 operating bands with 100 kHz channel raster,
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2
\- For NR FR1 operating bands with 15 kHz channel raster,
\- Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-5 kHz, 0
kHz, 5 kHz} for âˆ†F~Raster~ equals to 15 kHz
\- Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~Channel(1)~ + BW~Channel(2)~)/2 + {-10 kHz, 0
kHz, 10 kHz} for âˆ†F~Raster~ equals to 30 kHz
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the _BS channel bandwidths_ of the
two respective NR carriers. The channel spacing can be adjusted depending on
the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario
[17].
The spacing between E-UTRA and NR carriers will depend on the deployment
scenario, the size of the frequency block available and the channel
bandwidths. The nominal channel spacing between and E-UTRA carrier and an
adjacent NR carrier is defined as following:
\- For NR operating bands with 100 kHz channel raster,
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~E-UTRA_Channel~ + BW~NR_Channel~)/2
\- For NR operating bands with 15 kHz channel raster,
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~E-UTRA_Channel~ + BW~NR_Channel~)/2+{-5kHz,
0kHz, 5kHz} for âˆ†F~Raster~ equals to 15 kHz
Nominal Channel spacing = (BW~E-UTRA_Channel~ + BW~NR_Channel~)/2+{-10 kHz, 0
kHz, 10 kHz} for âˆ†F~Raster~ equals to 30 kHz
where BW~E-UTRA_Channel~ and BW~NR_Channel~ are the channel bandwidths of the
E-UTRA and NR carriers, âˆ†F~Raster~ is the band dependent channel raster
granularity defined in TS38.101-1[19]. The channel spacing can be adjusted
depending on the channel raster to optimize performance in a particular
deployment scenario.
.
### 4.6.1A CA Channel spacing
In E-UTRA for contiguously aggregated carriers the channel spacing between
adjacent component carriers shall be multiple of 300 kHz.
The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent aggregated E-UTRA carriers is
defined as follows:
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the channel bandwidths of the two
respective E-UTRA component carriers according to Table 5.6-1 with values in
MHz. The channel spacing for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation can be
adjusted to any multiple of 300 kHz less than the nominal channel spacing to
optimize performance in a particular deployment scenario.
In NR for intra-band contiguously aggregated carriers, the channel spacing
between adjacent component carriers shall be multiple of least common multiple
of channel raster and sub-carrier spacing.
The nominal channel spacing between two adjacent aggregated NR carriers is
defined as follows:
For NR operating bands with 100 kHz channel raster:
For NR operating bands with 15 kHz channel raster:
with
where BW~Channel(1)~ and BW~Channel(2)~ are the _BS channel bandwidths_ of the
two respective NR component carriers according to Table 5.3.3-1 and 5.3.3-2 in
TS 38.104 [17] with values in MHz, Î¼~0~ the largest Î¼ value among the
subcarrier spacing configurations supported in the operating band for both of
the channel bandwidths according to Table 5.3.5-1 and Table 5.3.5-2 in TS
38.104 [17] and _GB~Channel(i)~_ the minimum guard band for channel bandwidth
_i_ according to Table 5.3.3-1 and Table 5.3.3-2 in TS 38.104 [17] for the
said Î¼ value, with Î¼ as defined in TS 38.211. In case there is no common Î¼
value for both of the channel bandwidths, Î¼~0~=1 is selected for NR _operating
bands_ with 15 kHz channel raster and _GB~Channel(i)~_ is the minimum guard
band for channel bandwidth i according to Table 5.3.3-1 in TS38.104 [17] for
_Î¼=1_ with _Î¼_ as defined in TS 38.211.
In NR the channel spacing for intra-band contiguous carrier aggregation can be
adjusted to any multiple of least common multiple of channel raster and sub-
carrier spacing less than the nominal channel spacing to optimize performance
in a particular deployment scenario.
### 4.6.2 Channel raster
The GSM/EDGE channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands [5].
The UTRA FDD and TDD channel raster is 200 kHz for all bands, which means that
the centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 200 kHz. In addition, a
number of additional centre frequencies are specified for UTRA FDD according
to [2], which means that the centre frequencies for UTRA FDD channels are
shifted 100 kHz relative to the general raster.
The E-UTRA channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands, which means that the
carrier centre frequency must be an integer multiple of 100 kHz [4].
NB-IoT channel raster is 100 kHz for all bands [4].
NR channel raster is specified in Clause 5.4.2 of TS 38.104 [17].
### 4.6.3 Carrier frequencies and numbering
The carrier frequencies and corresponding numbering is defined for each RAT in
the respective specifications TS 38.104 [17], 36.104 [4] TS25.104 [2], TS
25.105 [3] and TS 45.005 [5]. In the context of MSR, the frequency numbering
scheme for each RAT will remain.
\- The E-UTRA carrier frequency numbering (EARFCN) is defined in subclause 5.7
of TS 36.104 [4].
\- The UTRA FDD carrier frequency numbering (UARFCN) is defined in subclause
5.4 of TS 25.104 [2].
\- The UTRA TDD carrier frequency numbering (UARFCN) is defined in subclause
5.4 of TS 25.105 [3].
\- The GSM/EDGE carrier frequency numbering (ARFCN) is defined subclause 2 of
TS 45.005 [5].
\- The NB-IoT carrier frequency numbering (EARFCN) is defined in subclause 5.7
of TS 36.104 [4].
\- The NR carrier frequency numbering (NR-ARFCN) is defined in subclause
5.4.2.3 of TS 38.104 [17].
NOTE: The numbering schemes for UTRA FDD and TDD are not coordinated, while
both are called UARFCN.
## 4.7 Requirements for contiguous and non-contiguous spectrum
A spectrum allocation where an MSR BS operates can either be contiguous or
non-contiguous. Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in the present
specification apply for BS configured for both contiguous spectrum operation
and non-contiguous spectrum operation.
For MSR BS operation in non-contiguous spectrum, some requirements apply both
at the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges and inside the sub-block gaps. For each
such requirement, it is stated how the limits apply relative to the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges and the sub-block edges respectively.
## 4.8 Requirements for BS capable of multi-band operation
For BS capable of multi-band operation (for NR this refers to BS type 1-C with
a multi-band antenna connector), the RF requirements in clause 6 and 7 apply
for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated. For some
requirements it is explicitly stated that specific additions or exclusions to
the requirement apply for BS capable of multi-band operation. In the case of
multiband operation of a BS, single-RAT operation and the corresponding
applicability of the requirements for each operating band is determined based
on the RAT configuration within only that operating band, unless otherwise
stated. A BS may operate multi-RAT where the individual RATs are operated in
different RAT specific bands that partially or fully overlap; Î”f~OBUE~ and
Î”f~OOB~ are according to the combined frequency range occupied by the
overlapping bands.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, various structures in terms of
combinations of different transmitter and receiver implementations (multi-band
or single band) with mapping of transceivers to one or more antenna port(s) in
different ways are possible. In the case where multiple bands are mapped on an
antenna connector, the exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are
applicable to this antenna connector. In the case where a single band is
mapped on an antenna connector, the following applies:
\- Single-band transmitter spurious emissions, operating band unwanted
emissions, ACLR, transmitter intermodulation and receiver spurious emissions
requirements apply to this antenna connector that is mapped to single-band.
\- If the BS is configured for single-band operation, single-band requirements
shall apply to this antenna connector configured for single-band operation and
no exclusions or provisions for multi-band capable BS are applicable. Single-
band requirements are tested separately at the antenna connector configured
for single-band operation, with all other antenna connectors terminated.
For a band supported by a Base Station where the transmitted carriers are not
processed in active RF components together with carriers in any other band,
single-band transmitter requirements shall apply. For a band supported by a
Base Station where the received carriers are not processed in active RF
components together with carriers in any other band, single-band receiver
requirements shall apply.
For a BS capable of multi-band operation supporting BC3 bands for TDD, the RF
requirements in the present specification assume synchronized operation, where
no simultaneous uplink and downlink occur between the bands.
The RF requirements for multi-band operation supporting bands for both FDD and
TDD are not covered by the present release of this specification.
# 5 Applicability of requirements
## 5.1 Band category 1
For all BS operating in bands belonging to Band Category 1, the RF
requirements listed in Table 5.1-1 apply for each supported operating band.
Requirements apply according to the RAT configuration of the Base Station, as
listed in the heading of the table. Some requirements listed in the table may
not be mandatory or they may apply only regionally. This is further specified
in the clause of each requirement and in Table 4.4-1. For multiband operation,
the applicability of the requirements for each operating band is determined
based on the RAT configuration within only that operating band, unless
otherwise stated.

## 5.4 Inclusion of requirements by reference
Many requirements in the present specification are not explicitly stated in
the clauses listed in Tables 5.1-1, 5.2-1 and 5.3-1, but are instead included
by reference to the respective single-RAT specifications. Each reference is
normative and identifies the clause where the requirement is specified.
In some cases, the referenced clause may contain requirements that for
different reasons do not apply for an MSR base station. It is in those cases
stated that \"applicable parts of\" the referenced clause applies. What parts
are applicable is determined by the scope of the MSR specification. For
example:
\- In a referenced clause including requirements for multiple operating bands,
only requirements for bands listed in the present document apply.
\- In a referenced clause that includes requirements for different types of
base stations, only requirements for the BS classes specified for each RAT
apply, see subclause 4.3.
# 6 Transmitter characteristics
## 6.1 General
Unless otherwise stated, the requirements in clause 6 are expressed for a
single transmitter antenna connector. In case of multi-carrier transmission
with multiple transmitter antenna connectors, transmit diversity, DB-DC-HSDPA
or MIMO transmission, the requirements apply for each transmitter antenna
connector.
A BS supporting DC-HSDPA and DB-DC-HSDPA transmits two UTRA FDD cells
simultaneously. A BS supporting DC-HSDPA transmits two UTRA FDD cells
simultaneously on adjacent carrier frequencies.
Unless otherwise stated, the transmitter characteristics are specified at the
BS antenna connector (test port A) with a full complement of transceivers for
the configuration in normal operating conditions. If any external apparatus
such as a TX amplifier, a filter or the combination of such devices is used,
requirements apply at the far end antenna connector (test port B).
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in subclause 6 applies at all times,
i.e. during the Transmitter ON period, the Transmitter OFF period and the
Transmitter transient period.

Figure 6.1-1: Transmitter test ports
Values for **F~offset,\ RAT~** to meet transmitter requirements are specific
for each RAT in each Band Category as specified in subclause 4.5.1 for Band
Category 1, subclause 4.5.2 for Band Category 2 and subclause 4.5.3 for Band
Category 3.
Unless otherwise stated the requirements for NB-IoT in subclause 6 applies for
all operation modes (In-band operation, Guard-band operation and Stand-alone
operation).
## 6.2 Base station output power
Output power of the base station is the mean power delivered to a load with

the tests as specified in 37.141 [10].
Unless otherwise stated the requirements in clause 7 apply during the base
station receive period.
Unless otherwise stated the requirements for NB-IoT in subclause 7 applies for

## 7.6 Receiver spurious emissions
The receiver spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or
amplified in a receiver that appear at the BS receiver antenna connector. The
requirements apply to all BS with separate RX and TX antenna ports. In this
case for FDD BS the test shall be performed when both TX and RX are on, with
the TX port terminated.
For TDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the requirement applies during
the Transmitter OFF period. For FDD BS with common RX and TX antenna port the
transmitter spurious emission limits as specified in subclause 6.6.1 are
valid.
For BS capable of multi-band operation where multiple bands are mapped on
separate antenna connectors, the single-band requirements apply and the
excluded frequency range is only applicable for the operating band supported
on each antenna connector.
### 7.6.1 General minimum requirement
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed the levels in Table
7.6.1-1:
Table 7.6.1-1: General spurious emissions requirement
Frequency range Maximum level Measurement Bandwidth Note
* * *
30MHz â€‘ 1 GHz -57 dBm 100 kHz  
1 GHz -- 12.75 GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz  
12.75 GHz - 5^th^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of the UL operating
band in GHz -47 dBm 1 MHz This spurious frequency range applies only for
_operating bands_ for which the 5^th^ harmonic of the upper frequency edge of
the UL _operating band_ is reaching beyond 12.75 GHz. NOTE: The frequency
range from F~BW\ RF,DL,low~ - Î”f~OBUE~ to F~BW\ RF,,DLhigh~ + Î”f~OBUE~ may be
excluded from the requirement. For BS capable of multi-band operation, the
exclusion applies for all supported operating bands. For BS capable of multi-
band operation where multiple bands are mapped on separate antenna connectors,
the single-band requirements apply and the excluded frequency range is only
applicable for the operating band supported on each antenna connector.
In addition to the requirements in Table 7.6.1-1, the power of any spurious
emission shall not exceed the Additional spurious emissions requirements in
subclause 6.6.1.3 and in case of FDD BS (for BC1 and BC2) emission shall not
exceed the levels specified for Protection of the BS receivers of own or
different BS in subclause 6.6.1.2. In addition, the requirements for co-
location with other base stations specified in subclause 6.6.1.4 may also be
applied.
### 7.6.2 Additional minimum requirement for BC2 (Category B)
For a BS operating in Band Category 2 when GSM/EDGE is configured and where
Category B spurious emissions apply, the power of any spurious emissions shall
not exceed the limits in Table 7.6.2-1.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the limits in Table 7.6.2-1 are only
applicable when all supported operating bands belong to BC2 and GSM/EDGE is
configured in all bands.

MHz -57 dBm 3 MHz 1 GHz -- 12.75 GHz â‰¥ 30 MHz -47 dBm 3 MHz NOTE 1: For BS
capable of multi-band operation, the frequency offset is relative to the
closest supported operating band.
## 7.7 Receiver intermodulation
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal.
### 7.7.1 General intermodulation minimum requirement
Interfering signals shall be a CW signal and an E-UTRA or UTRA signal as
specified in Annex A.
The requirement is applicable outside the Base Station RF Bandwidth or Radio
Bandwidth. The interfering signal offset is defined relative to the Base
Station RF Bandwidth edges or Radio Bandwidth edges.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in addition
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap, in case the gap size is at least twice as
wide as the UTRA/E-UTRA interfering signal centre frequency offset from the
Base Station RF Bandwidth edge. The interfering signal offset is defined
relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the inter Base Station
RF Bandwidth gap.
For the wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency and two interfering
signals coupled to the base station antenna input, using the parameters in
Table 7.7.1-1 and 7.7.1-2, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104 [4],
subclause 7.2.
\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 [2], subclause 7.2.
\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 [3], subclause 7.2.
\- For any GSM/EDGE carrier, the conditions are specified in TS 45.005 [5],
Annex P.2.2.
\- For any NB-IoT carrier, the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104 [4],
subclause 7.2.
\- For any NR carrier, the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum throughput
of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 38.104 [17], subclause 7.2.

relative to the sub-block edges inside the gap.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirement applies in addition
inside any Inter RF Bandwidth gap in case the gap size is at least as wide as
the E-UTRA interfering signal in Table 7.7.2-2. The interfering signal offset
is defined relative to the Base Station RF Bandwidth edges inside the Inter RF
Bandwidth gap.

signals coupled to the base station antenna input, using the parameters in
Table 7.7.2-1 and 7.7.2-2, the following requirements shall be met:
\- For any E-UTRA carrier, the throughput shall be â‰¥ 95% of the maximum
throughput of the reference measurement channel defined in TS 36.104 [4],
subclause 7.2.
\- For any UTRA FDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in TS 25.104 [2], subclause 7.2.
\- For any UTRA TDD carrier, the BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the reference
measurement channel defined in TS 25.105 [3], subclause 7.2.
