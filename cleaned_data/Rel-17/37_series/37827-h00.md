# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document is a technical report Power Class 2 for EN-DC with xLTE
band + yNR DL with 1LTE+1(TDD) NR UL band (x= 2, 3, 4, y=1; x=1, 2, y=2) under
Rel-17 time frame. The purpose is to gather the relevant background
information and studies in order to address relevant requirements for the
Rel-17 EN-DC band combinations with Power Class 2 requested by proponents and
captured in the WID...

# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for Power Class 2 band combinations
under Rel-17 timeframe. The document covers each band combination specific
issues (i.e. one sub-clause defined per band combination)
## 4.1 TR maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the band
combination have been implemented.

#### 5.1.1.3 Co-existence study
According to the PC3 DC_2A-5A_n77A study in 37.717-21-11, the Rx impacts are
identified as below,
  * 3rd order IMD products generated by DC_5_n77 uplink may fall into own Rx of band 2.
  * 5^th^ order IMD products generated by DC_2_n77 uplink may fall into own Rx of band 5.
Thus, additional MSD for IMD 3 and 5 should be considered to mitigate the
impact of the interference **for** PC2 DC_2A-5A_n77A combination.

Rx impacts are identified as below,
> For UL DC_5A_n77A, IMD5 of the 2UL may fall into band 13 Rx
>
> For UL DC_13A_n77A, IMD5 of the 2UL may fall into band 5 Rx
Thus additional MSD should be considered to mitigate the impact of the
interference.
