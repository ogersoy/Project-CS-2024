# Foreword
This Technical Report has been produced by the 3rd Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document is a technical report for High power UE (power class 2)
for EN-DC with 1 LTE band + 1 NR TDD band within FR1 under Rel-17 timeframe,
including both FDD+TDD and TDD+TDD EN-DC band combinations. FDD+TDD band
combinations could support LTE 23dBm + NR 23dBm and LTE 23dBm + NR 26dBm,
while TDD+TDD band combinations support only LTE 23dBm + NR 23dBm. Completion
of PC3 for particular EN-DC combination is the prerequisite for introducing
PC2 for that combination. All the PC2 EN-DC combinations are release-
independent from Rel-15.
The purpose is to gather the relevant background information and studies in
order to address Power Class 2 EN-DC of 1 LTE band and 1 NR TDD band for the
Rel-17 band combinations in Table 1-1. The actual requirements are added to
the corresponding technical specifications.

# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for High power UE (power class 2)
for EN-DC with 1 LTE band + 1 NR TDD band within FR1 under Rel-17 timeframe.
The document covers each band combination specific issues (i.e. one sub-clause
defined per band combination)
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the band
combination have been implemented.

# 5 High power UE (power class 2) for EN-DC with 1 LTE band + 1 NR TDD band:
General Part
For the EN-DC of LTE TDD band + NR TDD band, The UE is not required to support
PC2 within E-UTRA or NR cell group. For the EN-DC of LTE FDD band + NR TDD
band, The UE supports PC3 within E-UTRA cell group, and supports either PC3 or
PC2 within NR cell group.

#### 6.1.1.2 Co-existence study
The co-existence study for PC2 DC_1A_n78A can be reused from the PC3
DC_1A_n78A captured in TR37.863-11-11, where:
\- 4^th^ intermodulation product may fall into band n1 Rx.
Therefore, additional MSD for IMD4 needs to be defined for PC2 DC_1A_n78A.

#### 6.2.1.2 Co-existence study
The co-existence study for PC2 DC_8A_n78A can be reused from the PC3
DC_8A_n78A captured in TR37.863-11-11, where:
\- 4^th^ intermodulation product may fall into band n8 Rx.
\- 4^th^ harmonic product of band n8 may fall into band n78 Rx.
For the harmonic product, due to the maximum output power of band n8 is kept
unchanged, so the MSD values due to 4^th^ harmonic product of the
corresponding PC3 ENDC can be applied. Therefore, only additional MSD for IMD4
needs to be defined for PC2 DC_8A_n78A.

#### 6.3.1.3 Co-existence study
According to the PC3 DC_2A_n77A study, the 2^nd^ harmonic mixing products from
band 2 may fall into band n77 UL frequency range. And, the 2^nd^, 4^th^ and
5^th^ order IMD products generated by dual uplink from both band 2 and band
n77 may fall into the band 2 Rx frequency range. Thus, additional MSD for IMD
2, 4 and 5 should be considered to mitigate the impact of the interference
**for** PC2 DC_2A_n77A combination.

\- band n77 UL might affect band 12 DL via 5^th^ order harmonic mixing
\- 5^th^ order IMD products may fall into own Rx frequencies of band 12.
For the 5th order harmonic of band 12 UL, the MSD values due to 5th order
harmonic product of the corresponding PC3 ENDC can be applied since the
maximum output power of band 12 is unchanged.
Therefore, additional MSD values for IMD5 and for 5th order harmonic mixing
need to be defined for PC2 DC_12A_n77A.

#### 6.15.1.2 Co-existence study
The co-existence study for PC2 DC_28A_n78A can be reused from the PC2
DC_14A_n77A captured in TR 37.826, where:
\- 5^th^ order harmonic of band 28 UL may fall into own Rx frequencies of band
n78.
\- band n78 UL might affect band 28 DL via 5^th^ order harmonic mixing
\- 5^th^ order IMD products may fall into own Rx frequencies of band 28.
For the 5th order harmonic of band 28 UL, the MSD values due to 5th order
harmonic product of the corresponding PC3 ENDC can be applied since the
maximum output power of band 28 is unchanged.
Therefore, additional MSD values for IMD5 and for 5th order harmonic mixing
need to be defined for PC2 DC_28A_n78A.
