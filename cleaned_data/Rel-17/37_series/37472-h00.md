# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the standards for Signalling Transport to be
used across the W1 interface. The W1 interface provides means for
interconnecting a ng-eNB-CU and a ng-eNB-DU of a ng-eNB within a NG-RAN. The
present document describes how the W1AP signalling messages are transported
over W1.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

**SCTP endpoint:** as defined in IETF RFC 4960 (2007-09) [5]
**W1:** interface between a ng-eNB-CU and a ng-eNB-DU, providing an
interconnection point between the ng-eNB-CU and the ng-eNB-DU.
**W1-C** : Reference point for the control plane protocol between ng-eNB-CU
and ng-eNB-DU.

## 4\. W1-C signalling bearer
## 4.1 Function and protocol stack
The W1-C signalling bearer provides the following functions:
\- Provision of reliable transfer of W1AP messages over the W1-C interface.
\- Provision of networking and routeing function.
\- Provision of redundancy in the signalling network.
\- Support for flow control and congestion control.
The protocol stack for W1-C Signalling Bearer is shown in figure 4.1-1 and
details on each protocol are described in the following clauses.
Figure 4.1-1: W1-C signalling bearer protocol stack
The Transport Network Layer is based on IP transport, comprising SCTP on top
of IP.
# 5 Data link layer
The support of any suitable Data Link Layer protocol, e.g. PPP, Ethernet,
etc., shall not be prevented.
# 6 IP layer
The ng-eNB-CU and ng-eNB-DU shall support IPv6 (IETF RFC 8200 [2]) and/or IPv4
(IETF RFC 791 [3]).
The IP layer of W1-C only supports point-to-point transmission for delivering
W1AP message.
The ng-eNB-CU and ng-eNB-DU shall support the Diffserv Code Point marking as
described in IETF RFC 2474 [4].
# 7 Transport layer
SCTP (IETF RFC 4960 [5]) shall be supported as the transport layer of W1-C
signalling bearer. The Payload Protocol Identifier assigned by IANA to be used
by SCTP for the application layer protocol W1AP is 73.
SCTP refers to the Stream Control Transmission Protocol developed by the
Sigtran working group of the IETF for the purpose of transporting various
signalling protocols over IP network.
The ng-eNB-DU and ng-eNB-CU shall support a configuration with a single SCTP
association per ng-eNB-DU/ng-eNB-CU pair.
The ng-eNB-DU shall establish the SCTP association. The SCTP Destination Port
number value assigned by IANA to be used for W1AP is 37472.
Within the set of SCTP associations established between one ng-eNB-CU and ng-
eNB-DU pair, a single SCTP association shall be employed for W1AP elementary
procedures that utilize non-UE-associated signalling with the possibility of
fail-over to a new association to enable robustness.
Between one ng-eNB-CU and ng-eNB-DU pair:
\- A single pair of stream identifiers shall be reserved over an SCTP
association for the sole use of W1AP elementary procedures that utilize non
UE-associated signalling.
\- At least one pair of stream identifiers over one or several SCTP
associations shall be reserved for the sole use of W1AP elementary procedures
that utilize UE-associated signalling. However, a few pairs (i.e. more than
one) should be reserved.
\- For a single UE-associated signalling, the ng-eNB-DU shall use one SCTP
association and one SCTP stream, and the association/stream should not be
changed during the communication of the UE-associated signalling unless TNL
binding update is performed.
Transport network redundancy may be achieved by SCTP multi-homing between two
end-points, of which one or both is assigned with multiple IP addresses. SCTP
end-points shall support a multi-homed remote SCTP end-point. **For SCTP
endpoint redundancy an INIT may be sent from a ng-eNB-CU or ng-eNB-DU, at any
time for an already established SCTP association, which shall be handled as
defined in IETF RFC 4960[5] in sub clause 5.2.**
The SCTP congestion control may, using an implementation specific mechanism,
initiate higher layer protocols to reduce the signalling traffic at the source
and prioritise certain messages.
