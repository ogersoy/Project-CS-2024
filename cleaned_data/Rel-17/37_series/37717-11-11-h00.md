The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 Background
The present document is a technical report for Dual Connectivity (DC) of 1 LTE
band and 1 NR band under Rel-17 timeframe. The document covers each band
combination specific issues (i.e. one sub-clause defined per band combination)
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the band
combination have been implemented.

## 5.1 Maximum Sensitivity Degradation (MSD) analysis
### 5.1.1 Inter-band EN-DC/NE-DC within FR1
For each inter-band EN-DC/NE-DC band combination, sensitivity degradation is
allowed for a band if it is impacted by UL harmonic interference, harmonic
mixing, cross band isolation, and intermodulation interference from another
band part of the same DC configuration. For 2UL inter-band DC, the harmonic
and IMD products can be calculated by the formula shown in Table 5.1.1-1.

Note that, for each DC band combination, MSD table shall be provided for
interference that requires sensivity degradation for an Rx band according to
the same manner as specified in section 7.3B in TS 38.101-3.
### 5.1.2 Inter-band EN-DC/NE-DC including FR2
For each inter-band EN-DC/NE-DC band combination, sensitivity degradation is
allowed for a band if it is impacted by UL harmonic interference from another
band part of the same DC configuration. Note that for each DC band combination
in section 6, MSD table shall be provided for interference that requires
sensivity degradation for a Rx band according to the same mannter as specified
in section 7.3B in TS 38.101-3.
## 5.2 Interference analysis for other system
When 2UL inter-band EN-DC/NE-DC UE is operating with other systems such as Wi-
Fi, Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can
have impact on these systems shown in Table 5.2-1.

To mitigate the impact of interference to other system is implementation
dependent, thus it is optionl in section 6 for each DC band combination.
## 5.3 Spurious emission band UE co-existence for EN-DC/NE-DC
Table 5.3-1 specifies the requirements for the specified EN-DC configurations
for coexistence with protected bands.

Note that for the NE-DC configurations that have a corresponding specified EN-
DC configuration, the requirements in the Table 6.5B.3.3.2-1 of TS 38.101-3
apply on each component carrier with all component carriers are active.
## 5.4 Handling of Band specific requirements for inter-band EN-DC including
FR2
Unless otherwise stated, for inter-band EN-DC configurations including FR2,
there are no additional requirements of spurious emission band UE co-
existence, MSD analysis, and ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values.
\- For spurious emission band UE co-existence, no requirements for FR2 NR
bands to protect E-UTRA and FR1 NR bands are applied to the constituent FR2 NR
bands. Spurious emission band UE co-existence requirements specified in TS
36.101 are applied to the constituent E-UTRA bands for the EN-DC
configuration.
\- For spurious emission band UE co-existence table, although the requirements
are specified, it seems that they are not testable under the condition RAN4
originally expected. In addition, the impact of the harmonics and IMD issues
between bands below 6GHz and bands above 24.25GHz inside UEs had been ignored.
Hence at least the co-existence between bands below 6GHz and bands above
24.25GHz should not have any issues if the assumption that no impact of
harmonic and IMD on co-existence between FR1 and FR2 is right.
\- MSD for E-UTRA and FR2 NR bands of inter-band DC combinations is set to
N/A.
\- ΔT~IB,c~ and ΔR~IB,c~ for E-UTRA and FR2 NR bands of inter-band EN-DC
combinations is set to zero.

Based on above table,
\- the 3^rd^ order harmonic of Band 8 will fall into Band n7.
\- 5^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of band n8
\- Regarding the MSD due to 5th order IMD, if n7 uplink is at it highest
position (2565 MHz) and band 8 uplink at its lowest position (882.5 MHz) then
center of IMD is at 965 MHz which is out of band. Naturally some part of the
IMD hits also the downlink band of band 8 but given this is IMD5 we propose
not to specify IMD at all.
Regarding the MSD due to harmonics of Band 8 fall into n7, due to similarity
with band 7+ n8 it is proposed to re-use the MSD value due to 3^rd^ harmonic.
Reference sensitivity exceptions for DC_8_n7 are proposed in Table 6.1.1.5-2
with uplink configuration specified in Table 6.1.1.5-3.

In summary of study, it could be seen,
\- The 2^nd^ harmonic from band 66 UL may fall into band n77 DL frequency
range (Note 1)
\- No h**armonic mixing products will fall into band n77 UL frequency range**
\- The 2^nd^ and 5^th^ order IMD products generated from dual uplinks of band
66 and n77 may fall into band 66 Rx frequency range
\- The 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD products generated from dual uplink of band
66 and n77 may fail into band n77 frequency range, but there is no impact to
TDD band.
The MSD should be considered to mitigate the impact of the interference for
this combination.
**_Note-1: There is no a_** 2^nd^ harmonic issue **_in_** the DC_66A_n77A band
combination once the U.S. C-band (3700-3980MHz) is applied.
A study of sensitivity degradation for CA_n66-n77 has been captured in [2],
and the same degradation is allowed for UL harmonic product to DL. The
reference sensitivity is specified in **Table 6.1.2.4-3** with uplink
configuration specified in **Table 6.1.2.4-4**.

#### 6.1.2.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL IMD products, or DL harmonic mixing
with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations. The potential
self-interference mechanism has been identified in section 6.1.2.4 except UL
harmonic order higher than 5 which are used to generate an interference mixing
coefficient table for this DC combination, as shown in Table 6.1.2.6-1.

Equations (1) and (2) below are used to calculate the interference centre
frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth (_BW~INT~_) where
coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.1.44.8-1 and _CBW_ stands
for channel bandwidth.

(2)
Formula (3-1) and (3-2) below are then used to indicate when the interference
is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

#### 6.1.2.7 OOB blocking exception requirements
For the band combination CA_66-n77, the blocking at 5010MHz in band n77 filter
is identified, and the existing filter cannot reach to 30dB rejection. A
further study is needed.

In summary of study, it could be seen,
\- The 5^th^ harmonic interferences from band 13 UL may fall into band n77 DL
frequency range
\- The 5^th^ harmonic mixing products from band 13 may fall into band n77 UL
frequency range
\- The 5^th^ IMD products generated from dual uplinks of band 13 and n77 UL
may fall into band 13 Rx frequency range
The MSD should be considered to mitigate the impact of the interference for
this combination.
Sensitivity degradation is allowed for UL harmonic product interference to DL.
The MSD range are specified in **Table 6.1.3.4-3** with uplink configuration
specified in **Table 6.1.3.4-4**.

#### 6.1.3.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL IMD products, or DL harmonic mixing
with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations. The potential
self-interference mechanism has been identified in section 6.1.3.4 except UL
harmonic order higher than 5 which are used to generate an interference mixing
coefficient table for this DC combination, as shown in Table 6.1.3.6-1.

Equations (1) and (2) below are used to calculate the interference centre
frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth (_BW~INT~_) where
coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.1.3.8-1 and _CBW_ stands
for channel bandwidth.

In summary of study, it could be seen,
\- The 4^th^ and 5^th^ harmonic interferences from dual uplink of band 5 and
n77 may fall into band n77 Rx frequency range, and there is no impact to this
TDD band.
\- The 2^nd^ and 5^th^ IMD products from dual uplink of band 5 and n77 may
fall into n77 Rx frequency range, and there is no impact to this TDD band
\- The 4^th^ and 5^th^ IMD products generated from dual uplink from both band
5 and n77 may fall into band 5 Rx frequency range
\- No harmonic mixing **product issue found**
The MSD should be considered to mitigate the impact of the interference for
this combination.

#### 6.1.4.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL IMD products, or DL harmonic mixing
with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations. The potential
self-interference mechanism has been identified in section 6.1.4.4 except UL
harmonic order higher than 5 which are used to generate an interference mixing
coefficient table for this DC combination, as shown in Table 6.1.4.6-1.

Equations (1) and (2) below are used to calculate the interference centre
frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth (_BW~INT~_) where
coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.1.4.8-1 and _CBW_ stands
for channel bandwidth.

Formula (3-1) and (3-2) below are then used to indicate when the interference
is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

#### 6.1.4.7 OOB blocking exception requirements
For the EN-DC band combination DC_5_n77, the lower frequency band UL carrier
and the CW interfering signal may partially overlaps with the higher frequency
band DL carrier. An exception requirement should be allowed.

measurement due to 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^ or 5^th^ harmonic spurious emissions.
Due to spreading of the harmonic emission the exception is also allowed for
the first 1 MHz frequency range immediately outside the harmonic emission on
both sides of the harmonic emission. This results in an overall exception
interval centred at the harmonic emission of (2 MHz + N x L~CRB~ x 180 kHz),
where N is 2, 3, 4, 5 for the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^ or 5^th^ harmonic

In summary of study, it could be seen,
\- The 2^nd^ harmonic interference from band 2 UL may fall into band n77 DL
frequency range.
\- The 2^nd^ harmonic mixing products from band 2 may fall into band n77 UL
frequency range.
\- The 2^nd^, 4^th^ and 5^th^ order IMD products generated by dual uplink from
both band 2 and band n77 may fall into band 2 Rx frequency range, but there is
no IMD impact to n77
The MSD should be considered to mitigate the impact of the interference for
this combination.
A study of sensitivity degradation for CA_n2-n77 has been captured in TR
38.716-02-00, and the same degradation is allowed for the 2^nd^ harmonic
products in UL to DL. The reference sensitivity is specified in **Table
6.1.5.4-3** with the uplink configuration in **Table 6.1.5.4-4**.

#### 6.1.5.6 Self-interference analysis
This section provides the formulation to determine whether the DL carriers
would be impacted by UL harmonics, 2UL IMD products, or DL harmonic mixing
with UL interferer based on UL and DL channel combinations. The potential
self-interference mechanism has been identified in section 6.1.5.4 except UL
harmonic order higher than 5 which are used to generate an interference mixing
coefficient table for this DC combination, as shown in Table 6.1.5.6-1.

Equations (1) and (2) below are used to calculate the interference centre
frequency (_f~INT~_) and its effective bandwidth (_BW~INT~_) where
coefficients a, b, c, and d are defined in Table 6.1.44.8-1 and _CBW_ stands
for channel bandwidth.

Formula (3-1) and (3-2) below are then used to indicate when the interference
is overlapping with _RX1_ and _RX2_ , respectively.

#### 6.1.5.7 OOB blocking exception requirements
For the band combination CA_2-n77, the blocking at 5150MHz in the band n77
filter is identified, and the existing filter cannot reach to 30dB rejection.
A further study is needed.

Based on Table 6.1.6.4-1, it can be seen that
\- 2^nd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band n77.
\- 3^rd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 41, 46, 47, 53
and n90.
\- 4^rh^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 52, n77 and n78.
\- 5^rh^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band n77.
\- 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 22, 42, 43,
48, 49, n77, n78 and n79.
\- 4^rh^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1, 4, 10,
23, 46, 65, 66 and n79.
\- 5^rh^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 32, 45, 46,
50, 51, 75, 76, n77, n91, n92, n93 and n94.
Based on above,
\- the 4th order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of band n1.
Based on the similarities with the existing LTE combination CA_1A-19A, there
is no need to have MSD added.

Based on Table 6.1.8.4-1, it can be seen that
\- 2^nd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band n77.
\- 3^rd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 46 and 47.
\- 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 11, 21, 24,
32, 45, 46, 50, 51, 74, 75, 76, n91, n92, n93 and n94.
\- 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 31, 46, 72,
73, 87, 88 and n79.
\- 4^rh^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 1, 10, 23,
30, 40, 41, 52, 53, 65, 66, n77, n78 and n90.
\- 5^rh^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 5, 6, 8, 18,
19, 26, 27, 50, 51, 75, 76, n77, n79, n91, n92, n93 and n94.
Based on above,
\- the 4th order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of band n1.
Based on the similarities with the existing LTE combination CA_1A-42A, there
is no need to have MSD added.

Based on Table 6.1.9.4-1, it can be seen that
\- 2^nd^ harmonics might fall into Rx frequencies of band 43.
\- 3^rd^ harmonics might fall into Rx frequencies of band 46.
\- 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of band 3 and 9.
\- 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of band 46.
\- 4^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of band 1, 2, 3, 4,
9, 10, 22, 23, 25, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 39, 42, 43, 48, 49, 52, 70, n77 and
n78.
\- 5^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 3, 9, 11,
21, 24, 32, 43, 45, 50, 51, 74, 75, 76, n77, n78, n91, n92 and n93.
From above it can be concluded that 4^th^ order IMD can fall in the Rx
frequency of both band 48 and n25. However, band 48 is a TDD band and there is
no simultaneous Tx/Rx transmission. Therefore, there should not be any impact
from dual uplink transmission to band 48. For band 48 it can be noted that the
2nd HAM falls at 3700 which is the upper limit of band 48. This means MSD is
defined similar as for DC_2A_n48A in 38.101-3.
When 2UL inter-band EN-DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. A summary of this is given below.

#### 6.1.9.6 Self-interference analysis
Based on the co-existence studies for DC_48_n25 it is found that MSD it needed
defined due to 4^th^ order IMD that can fall in the Rx frequency of band n25.
MSD have therefor been defined based on DC_2A_n48A, already defined in
38.101-3, due to similarity in frequency range.

NOTE 2: The requirements should be verified for UL EARFCN or NR ARFCN of the aggressor (lower) band (superscript LB) such that in MHz and with carrier frequency in the victim (higher) band in MHz and the channel bandwidth configured in the lower band. NOTE 3: The requirements are only applicable to channel bandwidths no larger than 20 MHz and with a carrier frequency at MHz offset from in the victim (higher band) with , whereandare the channel bandwidths configured in the aggressor (lower) and victim (higher) bands in MHz, respectively. NOTE 13: These requirements apply when there is at least one individual RE within the uplink transmission bandwidth of the aggressor (lower) band for which the 2nd transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission bandwidth of a victim (higher) band and a range ∆FHD above and below the edge of this downlink transmission bandwidth. The value ∆FHD depends on the EN-DC band combination: ∆FHD = 10 MHz for DC_1_n77, DC_2_n48, DC_2_n77, DC_48_n25, DC_48_n66, DC_66_n48, DC_66_n77, DC_3_n77, DC_3_n78, DC_11_n28 and DC_28_n50 |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

\- 3^rd^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 52, 77 and 78
\- 4^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 46, 47, 52, 77 and 78
\- 5^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 12, 13, 14, 17, 20,
28, 29, 43, 44, 46, 67, 68, 71, 77, 78 and 85
When a 2UL inter-band DC UE is operating with other systems such as Wi-Fi,
Bluetooth and GNSS, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have an
impact on these systems. Table 6.1.53.3-2 lists if up to 3^rd^ order harmonics
and IMD up to 5^th^ order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on the co-existence study and self-interference analysis, it can be seen
there are no harmonic and intermodulation issue for DC_n28A_39A configuration,
i.e. no MSD needs to be defined.
However, according to the analysis in R4-2117609, the cross band isolation MSD
should be defined

measurements with a level up to the applicable requirements defined in Table
6.6.3.1-2 in TS 36.101 [4] and Table 6.5.3.1-2 in TS 38.101-1 [2] are
permitted for each assigned carrier used in the measurement due to 2^nd^,
3^rd^, 4^th^ or 5^th^ harmonic spurious emissions. Due to spreading of the
harmonic emission the exception is also allowed for the first 1 MHz frequency
range immediately outside the harmonic emission on both sides of the harmonic
emission. This results in an overall exception interval centred at the
harmonic emission of (2 MHz + N x L~CRB~ x 180 kHz), where N is 2, 3, 4, 5 for
the 2^nd^, 3^rd^, 4^th^ or 5^th^ harmonic respectively. The exception is
allowed if the measurement bandwidth (MBW) totally or partially overlaps the
overall exception interval.

Based on Table 6.1.64.4-1, it can be seen that:
\- 3^rd^ and 5^th^ order IMD products might fall into Rx frequencies of band
n5. However, it is not possible to configure the UL test points such that the
IMD5 product will overlap the corresponding DL frequency in band n5.
\- 3^rd^ order IMD products might fall into Rx frequencies of band 14.

Based on Table 6.1.65.4 -1 and 6.1.65.4-2, it can be seen that
\- 2^nd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band n77.
\- 3^rd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 46, 47, n96.
\- 4^th^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 46.
\- 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 42, 52, n77,
n78.
\- 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 5, 6, 8, 19,
26, 40, 41, 46, 53, n47, n79, n90.
\- 4^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 8, 30, 40,
n79, n96.
\- 5^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 31, 43, 72,
73, 87, 88, n77, n78, n96.
\- Tx of Band 11 may affect Rx of Band n1 due to the harmonic mixing products
due to 3^rd^ order Tx in Band 11 and 2^nd^ order Rx harmonics in Band n1.
Considering that MSD due to 2^nd^ order harmonic mixing with fundamental UL
aggressor is low for FDD-TDD band combinations (for example only 6.1dB B2 MSD
in DC_2_n77), and, considering that for this FDD-FDD band combination, the
3^rd^ harmonic B11 Tx aggressor power level is much lower than the fundamental
Tx power level, it is expected that the DL interference level caused by the
second order receiver harmonic mixing will be lower than the thermal noise
floor. Consequently, band n1 MSD can be neglected and does not need to be
specified.
When 2UL inter-band EN-DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.1.65.4-5 lists up to 7th order harmonics and
IMD up to 5th order falls into one of these receiving bands.

Based on Table 6.1.66.4 -1, it can be seen that
\- 2^nd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 46, n77, n79.
\- 3^rd^ order harmonic may fall into Rx frequencies of band 46, 47, n96.
\- 2^nd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 12, 13,14,
17, 28, 29, 44, 67, 68, 71, 85, n79.
\- 3^rd^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 32, 42, 45,
50, 51, 52, 75, 76, n77, n78, n91, n92, n93, n94, n96.
\- 4^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 11, 21, 24,
32, 42, 45, 46, 47, 50, 51, 52, 74, 75, 76, n77, n78, n91, n92, n93, n94.
\- 5^th^ order IMD products may fall into Rx frequencies of bands 5, 6, 8, 12,
13,14, 17, 18, 19, 20, 22, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 42, 43, 44, 46, 48, 49, 67, 68,
71, 72, 73, 85, 87, 88, n77, n78, n79.
Because of no harmonic and IMD products falling into the own Rx Band, there is
no MSD issue for this DC configuration.
When 2UL inter-band EN-DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. Table 6.1.66.4-2 lists up to 7th order harmonics and

Based on Table 6.1.69.5-1, it can be seen that
\- 4^th^ order IMD products may fall into own Rx frequencies of band n1.
#### 6.1.69.6 ∆T~IB~ and ∆R~IB~ values
For DC_5_n1, the ∆T~IB,c~ and ∆R~IB,c~ values are reused from DC_1_n5 and are
given in the tables below.

#### 6.1.69.7 MSD
Co-existence studies shows that IMD4 theoretically may be falling into own Rx
frequencies of band n1. However, it is not possible to find test-points making
this happen with a direct hit to band n1. Therefor it is seen that no MSD need
to be defined.

Based on co-existence study as presented in the table 6.1.72.4-1 and
6.1.72.4-2, own Rx impact is shown in the following.
\- The 5^th^ and 6^th^ harmonic of Band 71 uplink may fall into own Rx of band
n77.
\- The 6^th^ harmonic mixing of Band 71 may fall into UL of band n77.
\- The 5^th^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of Band 71 + Band n77 may fall
into own Rx of band 71
\- The 2^nd^ order IMD generated by dual uplink of both Band 71 + Band n77 may
fall into own Rx of Band n77, but there is no IMD impact to n77

#### 6.1.73.4 MSD analysis for DC
Both CA_n2-n48 and DC_2_n48 combinations have been specified in 38.101-1.
Also, the related co-existence study of CA_n2-n48 is included in Section
6.36.2 of TR 38.716-02-00. For this DC_48_n2 combo, the same co-existence
issues are identified,
\- The 2^nd^ harmonic skirt interference for band n2 UL will impact the
receive frequency of band 48
\- The 4^th^ order IMD may fall into Rx frequencies of band n2 and no IMD
falls into its band 48 Rx frequencies since band 48 is TDD band.
Thus additional reference sensitivity exceptions for 2^nd^ harmonic in
DC_48_n2 is derived to below, based on 38.101-1.

NOTE 2: The requirements should be verified for UL EARFCN or NR ARFCN of the aggressor (lower) band (superscript LB) such that in MHz and with carrier frequency in the victim (higher) band in MHz and the channel bandwidth configured in the lower band. NOTE 3: The requirements are only applicable to channel bandwidths no larger than 20 MHz and with a carrier frequency at MHz offset from in the victim (higher band) with , whereandare the channel bandwidths configured in the aggressor (lower) and victim (higher) bands in MHz, respectively. NOTE 13: These requirements apply when there is at least one individual RE within the uplink transmission bandwidth of the aggressor (lower) band for which the 2nd transmitter harmonic is within the downlink transmission bandwidth of a victim (higher) band and a range ∆FHD above and below the edge of this downlink transmission bandwidth. The value ∆FHD depends on the EN-DC band combination: ∆FHD = 10 MHz for DC_1_n77, DC_2_n48, DC_2_n77, DC_42_n3, DC_48_n2, DC_48_n25, DC_48_n66, DC_66_n48, DC_66_n77, DC_3_n77, DC_3_n78, DC_11_n28 and DC_28_n50, DC_28_n51, DC_66_n78, DC_25_n77, DC_25_n78. |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |   
The uplink configuration for reference sensitivity exceptions from 38.101-1 is
applied below for UL harmonic interference.

Based on Table 6.4.1.5-1, it can be seen that 3^rd^ and 5^th^ order IMD can
fall in the Rx frequency of band 71. However, this is not relevant for single
switched UL only operation.
When 2UL inter-band EN-DC UE is operating with other systems such as WiFi,
Bluetooth and GNSS system, the harmonics and intermodulation products can have
impact on these systems. A summary of this is given below.

#### 6.4.1.6 ∆R~IBNC~ values
Based on the co-existence studies for DC_71_n71 it is found that a Wgap
exception is needed defined due to the configuration having 2DL carriers (1NR
and 1LTE) in the DL of band 71 with an UL NR carrier. This is to be defined in
Table 7.3B.3.2-2 of 38.101-3.
