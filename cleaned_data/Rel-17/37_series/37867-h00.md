In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.\

# 4 Background
At 3GPP RAN#90-e meeting, a new Rel-17 Work Item "Down link interruption for
band combinations to conduct dynamic Tx Switching" was approved. The
objectives are as follows,
1) Discuss and specify inter-band uplink CA and EN-DC combinations for which
DL interruption is not allowed when 1Tx-2Tx dynamic switching between two
uplink carriers is conducted.
a) Based on the requested band combinations from operators, identify if it is
feasible to specify no DL interruption in RAN4 specification.
b) Discuss and find out an appropriate way to indicate no DL interruption for
higher order CA and EN-DC combinations in RAN4 specification.
2) For 1Tx-2Tx switching between two uplink carriers, the mandating of no DL
interruption for new band combinations is release independent from Rel-16.
The present document is the technical report for this basket Work Item.
## 4.1 TR Maintenance
A single company is responsible for introducing all approved TPs in the
current TR, i.e. TR editor. However, it is the responsibility of the contact
person of each band/band combination to ensure that the TPs related to the
band/band combination have been implemented.

#### 6.1.1.1 Configurations
Configuration Uplink configuration
* * *
CA_n3-n40-n41 CA n3-n40, CA n3-n41
#### 6.1.1.2 Technical analysis
RAN4 already agreed that no DL interruption allowed for CA_n3-n41.
For CA_n3-n40, there was no discussion on the applicability of DL
interruption. Since the frequency gap between n3 and n40 is larger than
1.4GHz, the separation is large enough. So no DL interruption for uplink
configuration CA_n3-n40 should be allowed.
So for the uplink configurations CA n3-n40 and CA n3-n41 of CA_n3-n40-n41, no
DL interruption for dynamic switching between two uplink carriers should also
be mandated.

RAN4 already agreed that no DL interruption allowed for CA_n3-n41, CA_n3-n79
and CA n41-n79. And for TDD band combination CA_n41-n79, simultaneous Rx/Tx
capability is mandatory supported.
So for the uplink configurations CA n3-n41, CA n3-n79, CA n41-n49 of
CA_n3-n41-n79, no DL interruption for dynamic switching between two uplink
carriers should also be mandated.

CA_n39-n41.
For CA_n8-n39, there was no discussion on the applicability of DL
interruption. Since the frequency gap between n8 and n39 is 1GHz, the
separation is large enough. So no DL interruption for uplink configuration
CA_n8-n39 should be allowed.

For CA_n1-n78 and CA_n3-n78, no DL interruption allowed has been specified as
mandated in 38.101-1, which means switching from n1/n3 to n78 has no impact to
n1/n3 downlink. Thus there is no DL interruption for CA_n1-n3-n78 with
CA_n1-n78 or CA_n3-n78 uplink configuration when conducting dynamic Tx
switching.
