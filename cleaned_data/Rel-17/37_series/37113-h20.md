In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document

statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document covers the assessment of NR, E-UTRA, UTRA, GSM/EDGE and
NB-IoT Multi-Standard Radio (MSR) Base Stations and associated ancillary
equipment in respect of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC).
The present document specifies the applicable test conditions, performance
assessment and performance criteria for NR, E-UTRA, UTRA, GSM/EDGE and NB-IoT
Base Stations and associated ancillary equipment in one of the following
categories:
\- Multi-Standard Radio (MSR) Base Stations for NR, E-UTRA, UTRA and GSM/EDGE
meeting the requirements of TS 37.104 [6], with conformance demonstrated by
compliance to TS 37.141 [11].
NOTE: For NR, scope of this specification is limited to _BS type 1-C_. For EMC
requirements of the MSR BS for _BS type 1-H_ and _BS type 1-O_ , refer to TS
37.114 [39].
\- _BS type 1-C_ for NR meeting the requirements of TS 38.104 [35], with
conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 38.141-1 [36]
\- Base Stations for E-UTRA meeting the requirements of TS 36.104 [4], with
conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 36.141 [9].
\- Base Stations for UTRA FDD meeting the requirements of TS 25.104 [2], with
conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 25.141 [7].
\- Base Stations for UTRA TDD meeting the requirements of TS 25.105 [3], with
conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 25.142 [8].
\- Base Stations for GSM/EDGE meeting the requirements of TS 45.005 [5], with
conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 51.021 [10].
\- Base Stations for NB-IoT meeting the requirements of TS 36.104 [4], with
conformance demonstrated by compliance to TS 36.141 [9].
In addition to MSR base stations, the present document covers other BS
supporting more than one RAT.
Technical requirements related to the antenna port of Base Stations are not
included in the present document. These are found in the relevant product
standards [2-11, 35, 36].
The environment classification used in the present document refers to the
residential, commercial, and light industrial environment classification used
in IEC 61000-6-1 [12] and IEC 61000-6-3 [13].
The EMC requirements have been selected to ensure an adequate level of
compatibility for apparatus at residential, commercial and light industrial
environments. The levels, however, do not cover extreme cases which may occur
in any location but with low probability of occurrence.

# 4 Test conditions
## 4.1 General
The equipment shall be tested in normal test environment defined in base
station conformance testing specification TS 37.141 [11]. The test conditions
shall be recorded in the test report.
For a EUT which contains more than one BS, it is sufficient to perform tests
relating to each type of port of each representative type of the BS forming
part of the EUT. For an MSR BS or other BS supporting more than one RAT, tests
shall be performed with RATs activated according to the test configuration in
subclause 4.5. Tests shall be performed relating to each type of port, and
need not be repeated for each RAT if operating RATs are assessed
simultaneously during the test. For other BS supporting more than one RAT
however (other than MSR BS), tests relating to the antenna port(s) shall
always be performed for each supported RAT.
For BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirements in the present
document apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated.
Operating bands and RATs shall be activated according to the test
configuration in subclause 4.5. Tests shall be performed relating to each type
of port and all RATs per band shall be assessed during the tests.
The manufacturer shall declare the supported operating band(s) according to
subclause 4.4 of TS 37.141 [11]. Requirements apply only for the declared
operating band and corresponding Band Category.
The manufacturer shall declare the supported capability set(s) according to
subclause 4.7 of TS 37.141 [11]. Tests performed on a Base Station according
to a declared Capability Set cover all single RAT and multi-RAT configurations
included in the declared Capability Set.
## 4.2 Arrangements for establishing a communication link
The wanted RF signal nominal frequency shall be selected by setting the
channel number according to the following:
\- The NR Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (NR-ARFCN) for NR carrier,
\- The Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (EARFCN) for E-UTRA carrier,
\- The Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (UARFCN) for UTRA carrier,
\- The Absolute Radio Frequency Channel Number (ARFCN) for GSM/EDGE carrier,
\- NB-IoT Narrowband -- Internet of Things
A communication link shall be set up with a suitable test system capable of
evaluating the required performance criteria (hereafter called \"the test
system\") at the radio interface and telecommunication port/ports (the
S1/Iub/Abis interface). The test system shall be located outside of the test
environment.
When the EUT is required to be in the transmit/receive mode, the following
conditions shall be met:
\- The EUT shall be commanded to operate at maximum rated transmit power;
\- Adequate measures shall be taken to avoid the effect of the unwanted signal
on the measuring equipment;
\- The wanted RF input signal level shall be set to a level where the
performance is not limited by the receiver noise floor or strong signal
effects.
NOTE: 15 dB above the reference sensitivity level has been used as an example
of the wanted input signal level in UTRA TDD, UTRA FDD, E-UTRA or NB-IoT EMC
specifications for establishing a stable communication link. The RAT-specific
reference sensitivity levels are specified in:
\- TS 25.142 [8] for UTRA TDD,
\- TS 25.141 [7] for UTRA FDD,
\- TS 36.141 [9] for E-UTRA or for NB-IoT,
\- TS 38.141-1 [36] for NR.
\- For GSM/EDGE the wanted receiver input signal level shall be set to a
nominal value of -47 dBm.
For immunity tests subclause 4.3 shall additionally apply.
### 4.2.1 Multiple enclosure BS solution
For a BS with multiple enclosures, the BS part with Radio digital unit and the
Radio unit may be tested separately. Communication link shall be set up in the
same way as if they are in single BS enclosure. The Radio Digital unit and the
Radio unit shall communicate over an interface enabling establishment of a
communication link.
## 4.3 Narrow band responses on receivers
Responses on receivers or duplex transceivers occurring during the immunity
test at discrete frequencies which are narrow band responses (spurious
responses), are identified by the following method:
\- if during an immunity test the quantity being monitored goes outside the
specified tolerances (clause 6), it is necessary to establish whether the
deviation is due to a narrow band response or to a wide band (EMC) phenomenon.
Therefore, the test shall be repeated with the unwanted signal frequency first
increased, and then decreased by an offset f~offset~, where:
\- For E-UTRA or for NR, f~offset~ = 2 x BW~Channel~, where BW~Channel~ is the
channel bandwidth as defined in TS 36.104 [9] for E-UTRA, or in TS 38.104 [35]
for NR;
\- For UTRA, f~offset~ = 10 MHz
\- For GSM/EDGE, f~offset~ = 400 kHz
\- For NB-IoT, f~offset~ = 400 kHz
\- if the deviation disappears in either or both of the above offset cases,
then the response is considered as a narrow band response;
\- if the deviation does not disappear, this may be due to the fact that the
offset has made the frequency of the unwanted signal correspond to the
frequency of another narrow band response. Under these circumstances the
procedure is repeated with the increase and decrease of the frequency of the
unwanted signal set to 1.25 x f~offset~;
\- if the deviation does not disappear with the increased and/or decreased
frequency, the phenomenon is considered wide band and therefore an EMC problem
and the equipment fails the test.
Narrow band responses are disregarded.
For an MSR BS or other BS supporting more than one RAT, the method above shall
be applied for each RAT supported. For BS capable of multi-band operation, all
supported operating bands shall be considered for narrowband responses.
## 4.4 Exclusion bands
An exclusion band is a band of frequencies over which no tests of radiated
immunity are made.
### 4.4.1 Transmitter exclusion band
For testing of radiated immunity there shall be no transmitter exclusion band.
### 4.4.2 Receiver exclusion band
The receiver exclusion band for Base Stations is the band of frequencies over
which no tests of radiated immunity of a receiver are made.
The range of the exclusion band shall be:
F~UL_low~ -- Δf~OOB~\ \- The communication link for the RAT(s) listed in the table shall be
> established according to subclause 4.2.
\- Tests for ports relating to the RAT(s) supported shall be performed
according to subclause 4.1.

# 5 Performance assessment
## 5.1 General
The following information shall be recorded in or annexed to the test report:
\- the primary functions of the radio equipment to be tested during and after
the EMC testing;
\- the intended functions of the radio equipment which shall be in accordance
with the documentation accompanying the equipment;
\- the method to be used to verify that a communications link is established
and maintained;
\- the user-control functions and stored data that are required for normal
operation and the method to be used to assess whether these have been lost
after EMC stress;
\- the ancillary equipment to be combined with the radio equipment for testing
(where applicable);
\- the information about ancillary equipment intended to be used with the
radio equipment;
\- information about the common and/or RAT-specific active RF components and
other HW blocks for a communication link in MSR BS or other BS supporting more
than one RAT
\- information about the common and/or band-specific active RF components and
other HW blocks for a communication link in BS capable of multi-band
operation;
\- an exhaustive list of ports, classified as either power or signal/control.
Power ports shall further be classified as AC or DC power.
Performance assessment of a BS with multiple enclosures may be done separately
for the BS part with the Radio digital unit and the Radio unit respectively,
according to the manufacturer\'s choice.
A communication link used by more than one RAT or more than one operating
band, shall be assessed on all RATs and operating bands. Communication link(s)
and/or radio performance parameters for the RATs and operating bands can
during the test be assessed simultaneously or separately for each RAT and
band, depending on the test environment capability.
## 5.2 Assessment of performance in Downlink
In the immunity tests, the output of the transmitter shall be connected to
equipment which meets the requirements for the performance assessment of RAT
and bearer used in the immunity tests according to the following:
\- Throughput assessment in TS 38.101-4 [38] in case of NR
\- Throughput assessment in TS 36.101 [31] in case of E-UTRA
\- BLER assessment in TS 25.101 [29] in case of UTRA FDD
\- BLER assessment in TS 25.102 [30] in case of UTRA TDD
\- BER assessment in annex A.1 in case of GSM/EDGE
\- Throughput assessment in TS 36.101 [31] in case of NB-IoT
Power control shall be OFF during the immunity testing.
## 5.3 Assessment of performance in Uplink
In the immunity tests, the performance in the uplink shall be monitored at a
telecommunications port(s) by using suitable test equipment according to the
following:
\- The value of the throughput shall be monitored in case of E-UTRA, and/or in
case of NR
\- The value of the BLER shall be monitored in case of UTRA FDD and UTRA TDD
\- The value of the BER shall be monitored in case of GSM/EDGE (see annex A.2)
\- The value of the throughput shall be monitored in case of NB-IoT
## 5.4 Ancillary equipment
At the manufacturer\'s discretion the test may be performed on the ancillary
equipment separately or on a representative configuration of the combination
of radio and ancillary equipment. In each case EUT is tested against all
applicable immunity and emission clauses of the present document and in each
case, compliance enables the ancillary equipment to be used with different
radio equipment.
# 6 Performance criteria
The test should, where possible, be performed using a bearer with the
characteristics of data rate and performance criteria defined for NR, E-UTRA,
UTRA, GSM/EDGE and NB-IoT below. If the test is not performed using one of
these bearers (for example, if none of them are supported by the BS) the
characteristics of the bearer used shall be recorded in the test report.
## 6.1 Performance criteria for continuous phenomena for BS
### 6.1.1 E-UTRA performance criteria
The throughput in table 6.1.1-1 is stated relative to the maximum throughput
of the FRC. The maximum throughput for an FRC is equal to the payload size *
the number of uplink subframes per second.
The BS Uplink and Downlink paths shall each meet the performance criteria
defined in table 6.1.1-1 during the test. If the Uplink and Downlink paths are
evaluated as a one loop then the criteria is two times the throughput
reduction shown in table 6.1.1-1. After each test case BS shall operate as
intended with no loss of user control function, stored data and the

# 8 Emission
## 8.1 Test configurations
This subclause defines the configurations for emission tests as follows:
\- the equipment shall be tested under normal test conditions as specified in
the functional standards;
\- the test configuration shall be as close to normal intended use as
possible;
\- if the equipment is part of a system, or can be connected to ancillary
equipment, then it shall be acceptable to test the equipment while connected
to the minimum configuration of ancillary equipment necessary to exercise the
ports;
\- if the equipment has a large number of ports, then a sufficient number
shall be selected to simulate actual operation conditions and to ensure that
all the different types of termination are tested;
\- the test conditions, test configuration and mode of operation shall be
recorded in the test report;
\- ports which in normal operation are connected shall be connected to an
ancillary equipment or to a representative piece of cable correctly terminated
to simulate the input/output characteristics of the ancillary equipment, Radio
Frequency (RF) input/output ports shall be correctly terminated;
\- ports which are not connected to cables during normal operation, e.g.
service connectors, programming connectors, temporary connectors etc. shall
not be connected to any cables for the purpose of EMC testing. Where cables
have to be connected to these ports, or interconnecting cables have to be
extended in length in order to exercise the EUT, precautions shall be taken to
ensure that the evaluation of the EUT is not affected by the addition or
extension of these cables;
\- the test arrangements for transmitter and receiver clauses of the
transceiver are described separately for the sake of clarity. However, where
possible the test of the transmitter clause and receiver clause of the EUT may
be carried out simultaneously to reduce test time.
## 8.2 Radiated emission from Base Station and ancillary equipment
### 8.2.1 Radiated emission for Base Stations
This test is applicable to BS, except for BS that are only single-RAT GSM/EDGE
capable. This test shall be performed on a representative configuration of the
BS.
For BS that are only single-RAT GSM/EDGE capable, the test method and limits
in clause 8 of TS 51.021 [10] apply.
#### 8.2.1.1 Definition
This test assesses the ability of BS to limit unwanted emission from the
enclosure port.
#### 8.2.1.2 Test method
a) A test site fulfilling the requirements of ITU-R SM. 329 [15] shall be
used. The BS shall be placed on a non-conducting support and shall be operated
from a power source via a RF filter to avoid radiation from the power leads.
Mean power of any spurious components shall be detected by the test antenna
and measuring receiver (e.g. a spectrum analyser). At each frequency at which
a component is detected, the BS shall be rotated and the height of the test
antenna adjusted to obtain maximum response, and the effective radiated power
(e.r.p.) of that component determined by a substitution measurement. The
measurement shall be repeated with the test antenna in the orthogonal
polarization plane.
NOTE: Effective radiated power (e.r.p.) refers to the radiation of a half wave
tuned dipole instead of an isotropic antenna. There is a constant difference
of 2,15 dB between e.i.r.p. and e.r.p.
e.r.p. (dBm) = e.i.r.p. (dBm) − 2,15 Ref: ITU-R SM.329 ANNEX 1 [15].
b) The BS shall transmit with rated power declared by the manufacturer with
all transmitters active. Set the BS to transmit a signal as stated in
subclause 4.5.
c) The received power shall be measured over the frequency range from 30 MHz
to F~DL_low~ - Δf~OBUE~ and from F~DL_high~ + Δf~OBUE~ up to 12.75 GHz. The
video bandwidth shall be approximately three times the resolution bandwidth.
If this video bandwidth is not available on the measuring receiver, it shall
be the maximum available and at least 1 MHz. Unless otherwise stated, all
measurements are done as mean power (RMS). Δf~OBUE~ is defined in table
8.2.1.3-2.
#### 8.2.1.3 Limits
The frequency boundary and reference bandwidths for the detailed transitions
of the limits between the requirements for out of band emissions and spurious
emissions are based on ITU-R Recommendations SM.329 [10] and SM.1539 [23].
The BS shall meet the limits below:
Table 8.2.1.3-1: Limits for radiated emissions from BS
* * *
Frequency range Minimum requirement (e.r.p.)/Reference bandwidth 30 MHz ≤ f
\1
m Effective radiated RF power between 30 MHz to 180 MHz ±6 dB ±6 dB Effective
radiated RF power between 180 MHz to 4 GHz ±4 dB ±6 dB Effective radiated RF
power between 4 GHz to 12,75 GHz ±6 dB ±9 dB (NOTE) NOTE: This value may be
reduced to ±6 dB when further information on the potential radiation
characteristic of the EUT is available.
* * *
NOTE: If the Test System for a test is known to have a measurement uncertainty
greater than that specified in table 8.2.2, this equipment can still be used,
provided that an adjustment is made follows:
Any additional uncertainty in the Test System over and above that specified in
table 8.2.1.4-1 is used to tighten the Test Requirements - making the test
harder to pass. This procedure will ensure that a Test System not compliant
with table 8.2.1.4-1 2 does not increase the probability of passing a EUT that
would otherwise have failed a test if a Test System compliant with table
8.2.1.4-1 had been used.

## A.1.1 Assessment of BER using static layer 1 functions
The transmitter under test shall be operated according to the test case of TS
51.021 [10], subclause 6.1.2.
The bit sequence from the output of the transmitter shall be monitored by the
test system according to the test case of TS 51.021 [10], subclause 7.1.2, and
the BER of the class 2 bits for TCH/FS assessed. The BER shall not exceed the
values specified in subclause 6.1 of the present document.
If the EUT does not support TCH/FS, the manufacturer shall declare the logical
channel for which the performance shall be assessed, and the corresponding
performance criteria.
## A.1.2 Assessment of BER using RXQUAL
The output of the transmitter shall be connected to an equipment which meets
the requirements of TS 51.010-1 [33] for the assessment of RXQUAL. The level
of the signal supplied to the equipment should be within the range for which
the assessment of RXQUAL is not impaired. The RXQUAL shall be monitored during
the test. The RXQUAL shall not exceed the values specified in subclause 6.1 of
the present document.
NOTE: This equipment can be a GSM mobile station with suitable provision for
the monitoring of RXQUAL.
# A.2 Assessment of BER at the output of a receiver
The BER at the output of the receiver may be assessed using either of the
techniques described below.
## A.2.1 Assessment of BER using RXQUAL
The value of the RXQUAL reported by the BTS or BSS shall be monitored using
suitable test equipment.
## A.2.2 Assessment of BER using reported BER
