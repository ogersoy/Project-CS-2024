In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document

result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document covers the assessment of UTRA TDD, UTRA FDD, E-UTRA, NR
and Multi-Standard Radio (MSR) Active Antenna Systems Base Stations in respect
of Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC).
NOTE 1: Whenever the AAS BS in _single RAT UTRA operation_ , or AAS BS in _MSR
operation_ using UTRA is referred in this specification, UTRA TDD and UTRA FDD
shall be considered, unless otherwise stated.
NOTE 2: For NR, scope of this specification is limited to _BS type 1-H_ and
_BS type 1-O_. For EMC requirements of the MSR BS for _BS type 1-C_ , refer to
TS 37.113 [4].
The present document specifies the applicable test conditions, performance
assessment and performance criteria for base stations in the following
categories:
\- Active Antenna System Base Station for UTRA TDD, UTRA FDD, E-UTRA, NR and
MSR meeting the conducted requirements of TS 37.105 [2], with conformance
demonstrated by compliance to TS 37.145-1 [3],
\- Active Antenna System Base Station for UTRA FDD, E-UTRA, NR and MSR meeting
the OTA requirements of 3TS 37.105 [2], with conformance demonstrated by
compliance to TS 37.145-2 [10].
Technical requirements related to the TAB connector are not included in the
present document. These are found in the relevant product standards [2, 3,
10].
The present document does not cover ancillary equipment requirements, where
ancillary equipment is not incorporated in the radio equipment and can be
assessed on a stand-alone basis, as declared by the manufacturer. Ancillary
equipment EMC requirements are still applicable to the AAS BS and are covered
by other EMC specifications in TS 25.113 [5], TS 36.113 [6], TS 37.113 [4] or
TS 38.113 [30].
The present document does not specify test conditions, performance assessment
and performance criteria for the Narrow-Band Internet of Things (NB-IoT) in
band, NB-IoT guard band, or standalone NB-IoT operation, for AAS BS in _single
RAT E-UTRA operation_ as defined in TS 36.113 [6], or for AAS BS in _MSR
operation_ using E-UTRA as defined in TS 37.113 [4].
The present document does not specify test conditions, performance assessment
and performance criteria for Band 46 operation as it is not supported by AAS
BS.
The scope of the present document is twofold:
\- Requirement, procedures and values of a _hybrid AAS BS_ with _TAB
connectors_ for every transceiver unit at the _transceiver array boundary_
(TAB), subject to conducted requirements,
NOTE 3: _hybrid AAS BS_ in the single RAT NR operation is equivalent to _BS
type 1-H_ defined in NR BS specification TS 38.104 [31].
\- Requirements, procedures and values of an OTA AAS BS without _TAB
connectors_ and relying in the radiated interface, subject to radiated
requirements.
NOTE 4: OTA AAS BS in the single RAT NR operation is equivalent to _BS type
1-O_ defined in NR BS specification TS 38.104 [31].
The electromagnetic environment classification used in the present document
refers to the residential, commercial and light industrial environment
classification used in IEC 61000‑6-1 [7] and IEC 61000-6-3 [8].
The EMC requirements have been selected to ensure an adequate level of
compatibility for apparatus at residential, commercial and light industrial
environments. The levels, however, do not cover extreme cases which may occur
in any location but with low probability of occurrence.

# 4 Test conditions
The equipment shall be tested in normal test environment defined in base
station conformance testing specification TS 37.145-1 [3], or TS 37.145-2
[10]. The test conditions shall be recorded in the test report.
For an AAS BS supporting more than one RAT, tests shall be performed with RATs
activated according to the test configurations in subclause 4.4. Tests shall
be performed relating to each type of port and RIB, and need not be repeated
for each RAT if operating RATs are assessed simultaneously during the test.
For AAS BS supporting only single RAT operation only, tests relating to the
_antenna port(s)_ and RIBs shall be performed for each supported RAT.
For AAS BS capable of multi-band operation, the requirements in the present
document apply for each supported operating band unless otherwise stated.
Operating bands and RATs shall be activated according to the respective test
configurations in TS 25.113 [5], TS 36.113 [6], TS 37.113 [4], or TS 38.113
[30]. Tests shall be performed relating to each type of port and RIB, and all
RATs per band shall be assessed during the tests.
Requirements apply only for the declared operating band and corresponding Band
Categories as per CSA and/or RCSA capability sets and manufacturer\'s
declarations of the AAS BS in TS 37.145-1 [3] and TS 37.145-2 [10].
The manufacturer shall declare the supported capability set(s) according to TS
37.145-1 [3] and TS 37.145-2 [10]. Tests performed on an AAS BS according to a
declared capability set(s) cover all single RAT and multi-RAT configurations
included in the declared capability set.
NOTE 1: _TAB connector_ capability sets (CSA) for _hybrid AAS BS_ are defined
in TS 37.145-1 [3] and declared in D6.12 declaration.
NOTE 2: Radiated capability sets (RCSA) for _hybrid AAS BS_ and OTA AAS BS are
defined in TS 37.145-2 [10] and declared by D9.25 declaration.
Where the _hybrid AAS BS_ has multiple _TAB connectors_ which are declared to
be equivalent then it is sufficient to perform EMC tests on a single
representative _TAB connector_. For the definition of the _TAB connector_
equivalence declaration (D6.70), refer to TS 37.145-1 [3].
EMC test shall not be performed with the AAS BS _antenna array_ radiating, all
_TAB connectors_ shall be disconnected from the _radio distribution network_
(RDN)/antenna array as specified in TS 37.105 [2] and terminated in an
appropriate load impedance. For the description of the general AAS BS radio
architecture and relations between the RDN/_antenna array_ and the Transceiver
Array Boundary, refer to TS 37.105 [2].
Depending on RAT capability sets supported by the AAS BS, the following test
conditions shall be referred and applied for the BS test configurations:
\- For AAS BS in _single RAT_ _UTRA operation_ the test conditions from TS
25.113 [5] apply.
\- For AAS BS in _single RAT_ _E-UTRA operation_ the test conditions from TS
36.113 [6] apply.
\- For AAS BS in single RAT NR operation the test conditions from TS 38.113
[30] apply.
\- For AAS BS in _MSR operation_ the test conditions from TS 37.113 [4] apply.
Whenever ports are considered for the emissions and immunity testing in the
referred TS 25.113 [5], TS 36.113 [6] and TS 37.113 [4] specifications,
special considerations shall be taken to test conditions specification for OTA
AAS BS due to lack of _antenna ports_.
NOTE 3: The receiver exclusion bands defined in E-UTRA and MSR specifications
for Band 46 operation are not applicable for AAS BS, as the Band 46 operation
is not supported by AAS BS.
NOTE 4: The NB-IoT operation is not supported by AAS BS.
## 4.1 Exclusion bands
### 4.1.1 Transmitter exclusion band
The _transmitter exclusion band_ for BS is the frequency range over which no
tests of radiated immunity of a transmitter are made. The _transmitter
exclusion band only applies to OTA AAS BS._
The _transmitter exclusion band_ is defined as:
F~DL,low~ -- Δf~OBUE~\ \- The communication link for the RAT(s) listed in the table shall be
> established according to subclause 4.2.
\- Tests for ports relating to the RAT(s) supported shall be performed
according to subclause 4.1.
