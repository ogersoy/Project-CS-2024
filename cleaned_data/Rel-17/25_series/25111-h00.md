# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
Y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
# Introduction
In order to ensure correctness and consistency of the specifications (i.e.,
technical specifications and technical reports) under responsibility of the
Technical Specification Groups (TSG) of the 3^rd^ Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP), clear, manageable and efficient mechanisms are necessary to
handle version control, change control, document updating, distribution and
management.
Also, the fact that the specifications are/will be implemented by industry
almost in parallel with the writing of them requires strict and fast
procedures for handling of changes to the specifications.
It is very important that the changes that are brought into the standard, from
the past, at present and in the future, are well documented and controlled, so
that technical consistency and backwards tracing are ensured.
The 3GPP TSGs, and their sub-groups together with the Support Team are
responsible for the technical content and consistency of the specifications
whilst the Support Team alone is responsible for the proper management of the
entire documentation, including specifications, meeting documents,
administrative information and information exchange with other bodies.

# 4 General
## 4.1 Main concepts
The LMU is either located as a separate unit in an existing network or
typically located at Node B or BTS sites. Therefore the LMU radio requirements
assume that the isolation between the LMU and any other network to be
protected is to be at least 30dB.
The communication link between LMU and Stand-Alone SMLC is not a radio
interface over the air. Requirements in this document therefore do not cover
the situation when the LMU is transmitting over the air on this interface
between LMU and Stand-Alone SMLC.
## 4.2 LMU Classes
The requirements in this specification apply to Wide Area LMUs and Medium
Range LMUs.
Wide Area LMUs are characterised by requirements derived from Macro Cell
scenarios with an LMU to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 70 dB.
Medium Range LMUs are characterised by requirements derived from Micro Cell
scenarios with an LMU to UE minimum coupling loss equal to 53 dB.
For Pico Cell scenarios, the location of the BS provides sufficient accuracy;
therefore, a Local Area LMUs class is not specified.
## 4.3 U-TDOA architecture
A sample architecture is shown in Figure 3.1 depicting the LMU's relationship
with other network elements. The LMU is typically located at the Node B. The
LMUs communicate with the SMLC that distributes UTDOA reference data from the
reference LMU to other cooperating LMUs when performing UE positioning.

# 5 LMU radio characteristics
An LMU performs BS receiver functions to obtain reference data for use at a
cooperating LMU. The following clause describes the required LMU radio
characteristics when performing these functions.
## 5.1 Frequency bands
a) The LMU is designed to operate in the following bands:
Table 4.1: Frequency bands
* * *
Operating Band UL Frequencies\ UE transmit, LMU receive
I 1920 -- 1980 MHz
II 1850 -1910 MHz
III 1710-1785 MHz
IV 1710-1755 MHz
V 824 -- 849MHz
VI 830-840 MHz
VII 2500 -- 2570 MHz
VIII 880 -- 915 MHz
IX 1749.9 -- 1784.9 MHz
X 1710-1770 MHz
* * *
b) Deployment in other frequency bands is not precluded
## 5.2 Channel arrangement
The channel arrangement shall be as specified in Section 5.4 of [1].
## 5.3 Reference sensitivity level
Using the reference measurement channel specification in TS 25.104 Annex A
[1], the reference sensitivity level and performance of the LMU shall be as
specified in Table 4.2.
Table 4.2: LMU reference sensitivity levels
* * *
LMU Class Reference measurement channel data rate LMU sensitivity level (dBm)
BER Wide Area LMU 12.2 kbps -121 BER shall not exceed 0.001 Medium Range LMU
12.2 kbps -111 BER shall not exceed 0.001
* * *
## 5.4 Dynamic range
Receiver dynamic range is the receiver ability to handle a rise of
interference in the reception frequency channel. The receiver shall fulfil a
specified BER requirement for a specified sensitivity degradation of the
wanted signal in the presence of an interfering AWGN signal in the same
reception frequency channel.
The BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the parameters specified in Table 4.3.
Table 4.3: Dynamic range
* * *
Parameter Level Wide Area LMU Level Medium Range LMU Unit Reference
measurement channel data rate 12.2 12.2 kbps Wanted signal mean power -91 -81
dBm Interfering AWGN signal -73 -63 dBm/3.84 MHz
* * *
## 5.5 Adjacent Channel Selectivity (ACS)
Adjacent channel selectivity (ACS) is a measure of the LMU receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
an adjacent channel signal at a given frequency offset from the centre
frequency of the assigned channel. ACS is the ratio of the LMU receiver filter
attenuation on the assigned channel frequency to the receiver filter
attenuation on the adjacent channel(s).
The interference signal is offset from the wanted signal by the frequency
offset Fuw. The interference signal shall be a W-CDMA signal as specified in
Annex C of TS 25.104 [1].
The BER shall not exceed 0.001 for the parameters specified in Table 4.4.
Table 4.4: LMU Adjacent channel selectivity
+-------------------------------+---------------------+------------------+------+ | Parameter | Level Wide Area LMU | Level | Unit | | | | | | | | | Medium Range LMU | | +-------------------------------+---------------------+------------------+------+ | Data rate | 12.2 | 12.2 | kbps | +-------------------------------+---------------------+------------------+------+ | Wanted signal mean power | -115 | -105 | dBm | +-------------------------------+---------------------+------------------+------+ | Interfering signal mean power | -52 | -42 | dBm | +-------------------------------+---------------------+------------------+------+ | Fuw offset (Modulated) | 5 | 5 | MHz | +-------------------------------+---------------------+------------------+------+
## 5.6 Blocking characteristics
The blocking characteristics are a measure of the LMU receiver ability to
receive a wanted signal at its assigned channel frequency in the presence of
an unwanted interferer on frequencies other than those of the adjacent
channels. The performance as specified in Table 4.5-4.10 shall be met with a
wanted and an interfering signal coupled to the LMU antenna input using the
following parameters for the blocking and narrowband blocking requirements:

An additional blocking requirement may be applied for the protection of the
LMU receivers when UTRA TDD is co-located with an LMU.
The current state-of-the-art technology does not allow a single generic
solution for co-location with UTRA-TDD on adjacent frequencies for 30dB BS-BS
minimum coupling loss.
However, there are certain site-engineering solutions that can be used in
these cases. These techniques are addressed in TR 25.942 [4].
For an LMU, the static reference performance as specified in clause 5.3 should
be met with a wanted and an interfering signal coupled to BS antenna input
using the parameters in Table 4.11.

located with UTRA TDD BS in other bands.

## 5.7 Intermodulation characteristics
Third and higher order mixing of the two interfering RF signals can produce an
interfering signal in the band of the desired channel. Intermodulation
response rejection is a measure of the capability of the receiver to receive a
wanted signal on its assigned channel frequency in the presence of two or more
interfering signals which have a specific frequency relationship to the wanted
signal.
The static reference performance as specified in clause 5.3 shall be met for a
LMU when the following signals are coupled to LMU antenna input:
\- A wanted signal at the assigned channel frequency with a mean power of ‑115
dBm.
\- Two interfering signals with the following parameters.

## 5.8 Spurious emissions
The spurious emissions power is the power of emissions generated or amplified
in a receiver that appear at the LMU antenna connector.
The power of any spurious emission shall not exceed:

In addition the following requirements shall be applied for the protection of
UE, MS, and Node B, BS of the same and other systems, where the power of any
spurious emission shall not exceed the limits:

# 6 LMU measurement requirements
## 6.1 General
All tests at specified detection levels require that the LMU detection
threshold be set such that the false alarm rate is at or below 5 % when no
signal is present (noise only).
## 6.2 RRC States supported
UTDOA positioning technique does work in CELL_DCH and CELL_FACH state, not in
URA_PCH nor CELL_PCH state.
## 6.3 Maximum response times
1) The maximum time for a Master LMU to establish a reference signal shall be,
after the data capture has started, less than 5 seconds.
2) The maximum time for the distribution of the reference signal to another
LMU involved in the positioning shall be less than 3 seconds.
3) The maximum time of detection of the time of arrival in an LMU given the
reference signal shall be less than 15 seconds.
## 6.4 Nominal time accuracy
Nominal Time Accuracy requirement verifies the difference between the detected
time of arrival and the real time of arrival.
In an AWGN environment with no fading or multi-paths, the standard deviation
of the timing error of the LMU shall be less than 30 ns when the signal
presence is correctly detected.
## 6.5 Multipath scenarios
_The purpose of the test case is to_ verify the LMU receiver's performance in
multipath.
For the 12.2 kbps reference measurement channel specified in 3GPP TS 25.104
Annex A [1], and with Rx diversity (using both diversity paths), the LMU shall
be capable of detecting the earliest path, for at least 90 % of the location
attempts, at the levels in Table 5.1.
Nominal time accuracy for multipath fading scenarios includes an additional
chip duration of 260 nanoseconds over that in Section 5.4.

**Propagation condition** **Detection level: Signal to Noise level in (dB)**
**Note** Static (AWGN) -51.2 dB NOTE 1 Multipath fading Case 1 -47.2dB NOTE 2
Multipath fading Case 2 - 43.8 dB NOTE 2 Multipath fading Case 3 - 41.9 dB
NOTE 2 Multipath fading Case 4 - 39.8 dB NOTE 2
* * *
NOTE 1: Static propagation condition is described in 3GPP TS 25.104 Annex B.1
[1].
NOTE 2: Multipath-fading case 1-4 is described in 3GPP TS 25.104 Annex B.2
[1].
## 6.6 Moving scenario
_The purpose of the test case is to_ verify the LMU receiver's performance to
Doppler shift.
In an AWGN environment with no fading or multi-paths, and at a speed of
250km/h, the detectability of the LMU shall be degraded by no more than 1.5
dB.
## 6.7 Cross correlation
_The ability of the LMU to detect a weak terminal signal in the presence of a
strong other terminal is covered in Section 5.5 when the other terminal
interference is modelled as AWGN._
