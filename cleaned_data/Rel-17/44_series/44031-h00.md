# 2 Functionality of Protocol
## 2.1 General
The present document defines one generic RRLP message that is used to transfer
Location Services (LCS) related information between the Mobile Station (MS)
and the Serving Mobile Location Centre (SMLC). Usage of the RRLP protocol on a
general level is described in 3GPP TS 43.059 that includes Stage 2 description
of LCS.
One message includes one of the following components:
\- Measure Position Request;
\- Measure Position Response;
\- Assistance Data;
\- Assistance Data Acknowledgement;
\- Protocol Error;
\- Positioning Capability Request;
\- Positioning Capability Response;
\- Multilateration Timing Advance Request.
Next sub-clauses describe the usage of these components.
Delivery of components may be supported in the RRLP level using pseudo-
segmentation by sending several shorter messages instead of one long message.
Any assistance data that is successfully delivered to an MS and acknowledged
prior to the interruption of the positioning procedure by an event like
handover, or by any other event that causes an MS to terminate the positioning
procedure or delivery of assistance data (see 3GPP TS 43.059), shall be
retained by the MS and need not be resent by the SMLC when positioning or
delivery of assistance data is again re-attempted.
The RRLP maximum PDU size is 242 octets. If the amount of data that needs to
be sent is larger than RRLP maximum PDU size, the RRLP pseudo-segmentation
shall be used. The RRLP pseudo-segmentation is the use of several RRLP
components (one in each RRLP message) to deliver a large amount of
information. For SMLC to MS messages, the Assistance Data component is the one
that is sent several times in order to deliver the information. For MS to SMLC
messages, the Measure Position Response component may be sent twice in order
to deliver the information. Legacy MS and SMLC (3GPP Rel-4 or older) may send
RRLP components that are larger than the RRLP maximum PDU size. In this case
lower level segmentation will be used.
## 2.2 Position Measurement Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the SMLC to request for position
measurement data or location estimate from the MS, and the MS to respond to
the request with measurements or location estimate.
Figure 2.1: Position Measurement procedure
1\. The Measure Position Request component and any Assistance Data Delivery
Procedure may be preceded by a Positioning Capability Transfer procedure (see
sub-clause 2.3a) to transfer the MS positioning capabilities to the SMLC.
2\. The Measure Position Request component may be preceded by an Assistance
Data Delivery Procedure (see sub-clause 2.3) to deliver some or all of the
entire set of assistance data that is needed by the subsequent positioning
procedure (steps 3-5).
3\. The SMLC sends the Measure Position Request component in a RRLP message to
the MS. The component includes QoS, other instructions, and possible
assistance data to the MS. The RRLP message contains a reference number and an
extended reference ID of the request.
4\. The MS sends a RRLP message containing the Protocol Error component to the
SMLC, if there is a problem that prevents the MS to receive a complete and
understandable Measure Position Request component. The RRLP message contains
the reference number and, if available, the extended reference ID included in
the Measure Position Request received incomplete. The Protocol Error component
includes a more specific reason. When the SMLC receives the Protocol Error
component, it may try to resend the Measure Position Request (go back to the
step 3), abort location, or start a new position measurement procedure (e.g.
with updated assistance data).
5\. The MS tries to perform the requested location measurements, and possibly
calculates it own position. When the MS has location measurements, location
estimate, or an error indication (measurements/location estimation not
possible), it sends the results in the Measure Position Response component to
the SMLC. The RRLP message contains the reference number and, if received, the
extended reference ID of the request originally received in the step 3. The MS
may optionally send one additional Measure Position Response component in a
second RRLP message to the SMLC if the amount of information it needs to
transfer to the SMLC is too large to fit into one single Measure Position
Response component (uplink RRLP pseudo-segmentation). This RRLP message also
contains the reference number and, if received, the extended reference ID of
the request originally received in the step 3. If two components are sent, the
MS shall indicate in the first component that it is the first of many
components and in the second one that it is the second of many components. If
there is a problem that prevents the SMLC to receive a complete and
understandable Measure Position Response component, the SMLC may decide to
abort location, or start a new position measurement procedure instead. If
additional Measure Position Response components are received by the SMLC after
the 1^st^ and optional 2^nd^ one, they shall be ignored.
## 2.3 Assistance Data Delivery Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the SMLC to send assistance data to
the MS related to position measurement and/or location calculation. Notice
that RRLP protocol is not used by the MS to request assistance data, only to
deliver it to the MS. The entire set of assistance data (i.e. the total amount
of assistance data that the SMLC has decided to send in the current procedure)
may be delivered in one or several Assistance Data components. In this case
steps 1 and 3 below may be repeated several times by the SMLC. If several
components are sent, the SMLC shall await the acknowledgement of each
component before the next Assistance Data component is sent. If Assistance
Data Delivery is used as part of the Position Measurement Procedure, as
described in sub-clause 2.2, then some assistance data may be delivered in the
final RRLP Measure Position Request.
Figure 2.2: Assistance Data Delivery procedure
1\. The SMLC sends the Assistance Data component to the MS. The component
includes assistance data for location measurement and/or location calculation.
The RRLP message contains a reference number and an extended reference ID of
the delivery. The More Assistance Data To Be Sent Element in the Assistance
Data component is used by the SMLC to indicate to the MS if either more
Assistance Data components (in the current Assistance Data Delivery procedure)
or a final RRLP Measure Position Request (if the Assistance Data Delivery
Procedure forms part of a Position Measurement procedure as described in sub-
clause 2.2) will be sent.
2\. The MS sends a RRLP message containing the Protocol Error component to the
SMLC, if there is a problem that prevents the MS to receive a complete and
understandable Assistance Data component. The RRLP message contains the
reference number and, if available, the extended reference ID included in the
Assistance Data component received incomplete. The Protocol Error component
includes a more specific reason. When the SMLC receives the Protocol Error
component, it may try to resend the Assistance Data component (go back to the
step 1), send a new measure Assistance Data set (e.g. with updated assistance
data), or abort the delivery.
3\. When the MS has received a complete Assistance Data component, it send the
Assistance Data Acknowledgement component to the SMLC. The RRLP message
contains the reference number of the Assistance Data originally received in
step 1.
## 2.3a Positioning Capability Transfer Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the SMLC to obtain the positioning
capabilities of the MS, the types of assistance supported and the types of
assistance data that may be needed from the SMLC. MS support for this
procedure can be indicated to the SMLC using the MS Classmark 3 IE for GSM
(see 3GPP TS 24.008), the PS LCS Capability IE for GERAN Gb mode (see 3GPP TS
24.008) and the MS Positioning Capability IE for GERAN Iu mode (see 3GPP TS
44.118).
Figure 2.3: Positioning Capability Transfer procedure
1\. The SMLC sends the Positioning Capability Request component to the MS. The
RRLP message contains a reference number and an extended reference ID of the
request. The message may contain indication of GANSS positioning support.
2\. The MS sends a RRLP message containing the Protocol Error component to the
SMLC, if there is a problem that prevents the MS to receive a complete and
understandable Positioning Capability Request component. The RRLP message
contains the reference number and the extended reference ID included in the
Positioning Capability Request component. The Protocol Error component
includes a more specific reason. When the SMLC receives the Protocol Error
component, it may try to resend the Positioning Capability Request component
(go back to the step 1) or abort the request.
3\. When the MS has received a complete Positioning Capability Request
component, it sends the Positioning Capability Response component to the SMLC.
The component shall include the positioning capabilities of the MS and the
types of supported assistance data. The component may include the types of
assistance needed by the MS to obtain a location estimate or positioning
measurements. The RRLP message also contains the reference number and extended
Reference ID of the Positioning Capability Request originally received in step
1.
## 2.4 (void)
## 2.5 Error Handling Procedures
### 2.5.1 General
In this sub-clause it is described how a receiving entity behaves in cases
when it receives erroneous data or detects that certain data is missing.
### 2.5.1a Message Too Short
When MS receives a RRLP message, that is too short to contain all mandatory
IEs, the MS sends a Protocol Error component with indication \"Message Too
Short\". If the Reference Number can be found, it is included. If the
Reference Number is not available, the Reference Number of the RRLP message
carrying the Protocol Error component is set to \'0\'. If the Extended
Reference IE can be found, it shall be included in the returned Protocol Error
Component. If the Extended Reference IE is not available, an Extended
Reference IE shall not be included. The original sending entity that receives
the Protocol Error, may then resend the original message, or abort the
procedure.
### 2.5.2 Unknown Reference Number
A SMLC detects that it has received a RRLP message with an unknown or invalid
Reference Number, when one or more of the following conditions occur:
\- a Measure Position Response, Assistance Data Acknowledgement, Positioning
Capability Response or Protocol Error component is received with a Reference
Number that the SMLC has not sent in a Measure Position Request, Assistance
Data or Positioning Capability Request component during a pending Position
Measurement, Assistance Data Delivery or Positioning Capability Transfer
procedure.
\- a Measure Position Response, Positioning Capability Response or Protocol
Error component is received with an Extended Reference IE value that the SMLC
has not sent in a Measure Position Request Assistance Data or Positioning
Capability Request component during a pending Position Measurement, Assistance
Data Delivery or Positioning Capability Transfer procedure.
\- a Measure Position Response, Positioning Capability Response or Protocol
Error component is received with a Reference Number and an Extended Reference
IE value that the SMLC has not sent together in the same Measure Position
Request, the same Assistance Data or the same Positioning Capability Request
component during a pending Position Measurement, Assistance Data Delivery or
Positioning Capability Transfer procedure.
The SMLC shall then discard the message. If the SMLC receives a Measure
Position Response or a Protocol Error component containing no Extended
Reference ID, then the SMLC shall assume that the target MS is for Release 4
or earlier and shall only verify the received Reference Number.
### 2.5.3 Missing Information Element or Component Element
When MS receives a RRLP message, that does not contain IEs or component
elements expected to be present, the MS sends a Protocol Error component with
indication \"Missing Information Element or Component Element\". If the
Reference Number can be found, it is included. If the Reference Number is not
available, the Reference Number of the RRLP message carrying the Protocol
Error component is set to \'0\'. If the Extended Reference IE can be found, it
shall be included in the returned Protocol Error Component. If the Extended
Reference IE is not available, an Extended Reference IE shall not be included.
The SMLC that receives the Protocol Error, may then resend the original
message, or abort the procedure.
### 2.5.4 Incorrect Data
When MS receives a RRLP message, that is contains IEs or elements of
components that are syntactically incorrect, the MS sends a Protocol Error
component with indication \"Incorrect Data\". If the Reference Number can be
found, it is included. If the Reference Number is not available, the Reference
Number of the RRLP message carrying the Protocol Error component is set to
\'0\'. If the Extended Reference IE can be found, it shall be included in the
returned Protocol Error Component. If the Extended Reference IE is not
available, an Extended Reference IE shall not be included. The SMLC that
receives the Protocol Error, may then resend the original message, or abort
the procedure.
### 2.5.5 Repeated Component
When after the reception of a Measure Position Request component, but before
responding with a Measure Position Response or a Protocol Error component, the
MS receives a new RRLP message with the Measure Position Request component, it
acts as follows:
\- if the old and new Measure Position Request components have the same
Reference Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE, the MS
ignores the later component;
\- if the old and new Measure Position Request components have different
Reference Numbers or, if included, different Extended Reference IEs or if one
Measure Position Request component (old or new) contains an Extended Reference
IE but the other component does not, the MS aborts activity for the former
component, and starts to acts according to the later component, and sends a
response to that.
When after the reception of an Assistance Data component, but before
responding with an Assistance Data Acknowledgement or a Protocol Error
component, the MS receives a new RRLP message with the Assistance Data
component, it acts as follows:
\- if the old and new Assistance Data components have the same Reference
Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE and if pseudo-
segmentation does not apply (see sub-clause 2.5.9), the MS ignores the later
component;
\- if the old and new Assistance Data components have different Reference
Numbers or, if included, different Extended Reference IEs or if one Assistance
Data component (old or new) contains an Extended Reference IE but the other
component does not, the MS ignores the former component and sends an
acknowledgement to the latter component.
When after the reception of a Positioning Capability Request component, but
before responding with a Positioning Capability Response or a Protocol Error
component, the MS receives a new RRLP message with the Positioning Capability
Request component, it acts as follows:
\- if the old and new Positioning Capability Request components have the same
Reference Number and the same Extended Reference IE, the MS ignores the later
component;
\- if the old and new Positioning Capability Request components have different
Reference Numbers or different Extended Reference IEs, the MS aborts activity
for the former component, starts to act according to the later component and
sends a response to that.
When after the reception of an Measure Position Response component, the SMLC
receives a new RRLP message with the Measure Position Response component, it
acts as follows:
\- if the old and new Measure Position Response components have the same
Reference Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE values, the
SMLC may ignore the later component;
### 2.5.6 (void)
### 2.5.7 Missing Component
When the SMLC sends a Measure Position Request component to the MS, it starts
a timer. If the timer expires before the SMLC receives the last Measure
Position Response component or a Protocol Error component from the MS with the
same Reference Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE value
as in the sent component, it may abort location attempt or send a new Measure
Position Request.
When the SMLC receives a Measure Position Response component with the same
Reference Number and, if included, the same Extended Reference IE value as in
the sent component indicating that it is the second of many segments, but the
first of the many segments was never received by the SMLC, it may abort
location attempt or send a new Measure Position Request.
When the SMLC sends a Assistance Data component to the MS, it starts a timer.
If the timer expires before the SMLC receives a Assistance Data
Acknowledgement or Protocol Error component from the MS with the same
Reference Number as in the sent component and, in the case of a Protocol Error
component, either the same extended reference ID as in the sent component or
no extended reference ID, it may abort delivery attempt or send a new
Assistance Data.
When the SMLC sends a Positioning Capability Request component to the MS, it
starts a timer. If the timer expires before the SMLC receives a Positioning
Capability Response or Protocol Error component from the MS with the same
Reference Number and the same Extended Reference ID as in the sent component,
it may abort the Positioning Capability Transfer Procedure attempt or send a
new Positioning Capability Request.
### 2.5.8 Unforeseen Component
When the MS receives a complete Assistance Data pseudo-segmentation sequence
or an Assistance Data component that was sent without pseudo-segmentation,
that it is not expecting, MS may discard it.
### 2.5.8a RRLP Procedure
The MS and SMLC shall only support one RRLP procedure at a time for either
positioning, delivery of assistance data or positioning capability transfer.
The normal sequence of events for either procedure is defined in sub-clause
2.2, sub-clause 2.3 or sub-clause2.3a, respectively. If the MS is engaged in
an RRLP procedure and receives a correctly encoded RRLP message from the SMLC
that starts a new procedure, the MS shall abort the first procedure without
sending a response and start the second.
### 2.5.9 Pseudo-Segmentation
When the SMLC employs pseudo-segmentation to send an RRLP Measure Position
Request message or an RRLP Assistance Data message, the SMLC shall send one or
more RRLP Assistance Data components followed by:
\- a final RRLP Measure Position Request component (see sub-clause 2.2) or
\- a final RRLP Assistance Data component (see sub-clause 2.3).
The SMLC shall indicate in all but the final component (Measure Position
Request or Assistance Data, respectively) that more components are on the way.
When an MS receives an Assistance Data component indicating that more
components are on the way, the MS may store the contents of the component. If
the MS receives a subsequent Assistance Data component or a final Measure
Position Request component that is correctly encoded, the MS shall assume that
the new component continues the pseudo-segmentation of the earlier component
and may then store the contents of the new component. If the new component is
an Assistance Data component indicating that no more components are on the way
or if it is a Measure Position Request, the MS shall assume that pseudo-
segmentation is complete. The MS may then employ the rules defined in sub-
clause 2.5.5 to verify if the new message is a repeated duplicate of a
previous message.
## 2.6 Multilateration Timing Advance Procedure
The purpose of this procedure is to enable the SMLC to request an MS to
perform the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure in multiple cells
autonomously selected by the MS. The BSS(s) corresponding to the selected
cells acquire and send timing advance related measurements to the SMLC which
uses the received measurements to perform a location estimate for the MS.
Figure 2.6: Multilateration Timing Advance procedure
1\. The RRLP Multilateration Timing Advance Request component is sent to the
MS (see step 1 in Figure 2.6). The RRLP message contains assistance
information acquired from the serving BSS which can be used by the MS to
perform the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure.
2\. The MS performs the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure in multiple
cells that it selects autonomously which may include one or more cells for
which it has received assistance information in the RRLP message (see steps
2a, 2b ... 2n). After the MS performs the radio access part of the MTA
procedure in a given cell the corresponding BSS sends the cell specific
Multilateration timing advance information to the SMLC.
3\. The SMLC uses the collected timing advance information to estimate a
"position" for the MS (see step 3).
# 3 Message Structure
## 3.1 General Format of RRLP Message
The general format of the RRLP message is given below, and based on:
\- ITU-T Recommendation X.680;
\- ITU-T Recommendation X.691;
and is consistent with these ITU-T recommendations. Also further definitions
in the present document are based on ASN.1/94 defined in ITU-T Recommendation
X.680 (ASN.1 1994). BASIC-PER, unaligned variant is used. Both RRLP ASN.1
modules, RRLP-Messages and RRLP-Components, are based on recommendations
presented above.
ASN.1 identifiers have the same name as the corresponding parameters
(information elements of the RRLP message, components, elements of components,
fields of component elements etc) in other parts of the present document,
except for the differences required by the ASN.1 notation (blanks between
words are removed, the first letter of the first word is lower-case and the
first letter of the following words are capitalized, e.g. \"Reference Number\"
is mapped to \"referenceNumber\"). In addition some words may be abbreviated
as follows:
msr measure
req request
rsp response
nbr number
ack acknowledgement
Ellipsis Notation shall be used in the same way as described in 3GPP TS 29.002
and shall be supported on the radio interface by the MS and the network for
all operations defined in the present document.

The message consists of two information elements, that are further described
in the following sub-clauses.
## 3.2 Reference Number IE
This element is mandatory, and appears only once per RRLP message. It has the
range from 0 to 7. Value 0 is reserved for indicating unknown Reference
Number. Its ASN.1 definition is in sub-clause 3.1. This element contains the
Reference Number that shall be used as follows:
\- in the Position Measurement procedure the SMLC shall select any number
within the range 1- 7 that it is not already using with the particular MS. The
Reference Number serves as an identification of the Measure Position request
component that it sends to the MS. When the MS responds either with the
Measure Position Response component, or the Protocol Error component, it shall
use the same Reference Number value and, if an Extended Reference ID was
included by the SMLC, the same Extended Reference ID to identify to which
Measure Position Request it is responding, if the Reference Number has been
obtained. If the MS has not been able to decode the Reference Number (e.g. IE
missing), it shall use \'0\' as the Reference number in the response. This
mechanism helps for example in the cases where the SMLC sends a Measure
Position Request to the MS, and before it receives the Response, it needs to
send another Request (e.g. assistance data changes). Then the SMLC can
identify to which Request the Response is related to;
\- in the Assistance Data Delivery procedure the SMLC shall select any number
within the range 1 - 7 that it is not already using with the MS. The Reference
Number serves as an identification of the Assistance Data component that it
sends to the MS. When the MS responds either with the Assistance Data
Acknowledgement component or the Protocol Error component, it shall use the
same Reference Number value if the Reference Number has been obtained and, in
the case of Protocol Error, if an Extended Reference ID was included by the
SMLC, the same Extended Reference ID to identify to which Assistance Data
component it is responding. If the MS has not been able to decode the
Reference Number (e.g. IE missing), it shall use \'0\' as the Reference number
in the response.
\- in the Position Capability Transfer procedure the SMLC shall select any
number within the range 1 - 7 that it is not already using with the MS. The
Reference Number serves as an identification of the Positioning Capability
Request component that it sends to the MS. When the MS responds either with
the Positioning Capability Response component, or the Protocol Error
component, it shall use the same Reference Number value if the Reference
Number has been obtained and the same Extended Reference ID value if that has
been obtained to identify to which Positioning Capability Request component it
is responding. If the MS has not been able to decode the Reference Number
(e.g. IE missing), it shall use \'0\' as the Reference number in the response.
> \- the SMLC shall use the same Reference Number and same Extended Reference
> ID to resend any RRLP component for which a response was not received from
> the MS.
>
> \- the SMLC shall use a different Reference Number to that in any RRLP
> component for which a response was not received from the MS if the SMLC
> aborts an existing RRLP procedure and starts a new procedure.
>
> \- the SMLC may use the same Reference Number and same Extended Reference ID
> or different Reference Numbers and Extended Reference IDs for different RRLP
> components within the same pseudo-segmentation sequence.
In all RRLP messages except Assistance Data Acknowledgement, the Reference
Number IE shall be supplemented by an Extended Reference IE in order to
distinguish valid from invalid RRLP responses at the SMLC and duplicate from
non-duplicate RRLP commands at the MS. In order to remain backward compatible,
the receiving entity shall be able to receive Measure Position Request,
Measure Position Response, Assistance Data and Protocol Error messages without
the Extended Reference IE. The ASN.1 definition of the Extended Reference IE
is given in sub-clause 5.1 and the procedures associated with sending and
receiving it are given in clause 2 and in Annex A, sub-clauses A.2.2.5,

cells for which assistance information is provided. Upon receiving this
request the MS autonomously determines the set of cells to use to perform MTA
which may include one or more of the cells identified by the assistance
information. If the MS selects a cell not identified by the assistance
information then it shall read system information sent therein to determine if
it supports MTA and PEO or EC operation. If the MS selects a cell identified
by the assistance information then it shall be the strongest cell in the
corresponding set of cells. The MS sends an EC MULTILATERATION REQUEST message
if EC operation is enabled for the selected cell or an EGPRS MULTILATERATION
REQUEST if PEO is enabled for the selected cell. This component is defined as
follows:

## 4.9 Multilateration OTD Request
This component is used by the SMLC to trigger the MS to perform
Multilateration OTD (MOTD) measurements of the difference between the observed
timing of the serving cell and the observed timings of a subset of neighbour
cells. This message includes up to 8 sets of neighbour cells. For each set of
the neighbour cells, the MS provides at most one MOTD report which shall refer
to the neighbour cell with the highest received signal level from that set of
neighbour cells. The message also includes a set of cells on which MOTD
measurements are not required (i.e. a Serving Cell Set). This component
triggers additional measurements if only one MOTD measurement can be reported
by MS (cf. subclause A.10.2.3).

## A.1 Introduction
This annex describes the contents of components.
## A.2 Measure Position Request
### A.2.1 General
The Measure Position Request is a RRLP component from the SMLC to the MS. This
component is common to E-OTD,GPS and GANSS (Galileo and Additional Navigation
Satellite Systems) location methods. As a response to this component, the MS
performs E-OTD,GPS or GANSS measurements and possibly calculates its own
position, if the MS and/or the network support these options. It contains the
following elements.

### A.2.2 Elements
#### A.2.2.1 Positioning Instructions Element
The purpose of Positioning Instructions element is to express the
allowed/required location method(s), and to provide information required QoS.
This element is mandatory in the Measure Position Request message, and
contains the following fields:
**Method Type**
This field indicates whether MS based or assisted version is
allowed/requested. If the Positioning Methods field includes more than one
method, the Method Type applies to all of them. This field is mandatory, and
has the following values:
\'0\': MS assisted;
\'1\': MS based;
\'2\': MS based is preferred, but MS assisted is allowed;
\'3\': MS assisted is preferred, but MS based is allowed.
In GPS positioning methods, \'MS based\' may indicate either MS Based Assisted
GPS method or Conventional GPS method. If \'MS based is indicated with no GPS
assistance data then the MS may interpret this as either Conventional GPS or
MS based A-GPS without assistance data. The same interpretation applies also
to the GANSS positioning method.
**Positioning Methods**
This field indicates which location method or methods should be used. This
field is mandatory.
\'0\': E-OTD;
\'1\': GPS;
\'2\': E-OTD or GPS (i.e. both can be reported).
NOTE: If the selected positioning method is \'GPS\' or \'E-OTD or GPS\', the
field GANSS Positioning Method, if present in a Measure Position Request
component, indicates request of GANSS method and indicates the allowed
satellite systems.
**Response Time**
This field indicates the desired response time. However, when performing
measurements, the desired response time may be exceeded. This field is
mandatory.
The response time is 2^N^ seconds, where N is the value in this field. Thus
the desired maximum response time can be 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, or 128
seconds.
Range: 0-7
**Accuracy**
This field indicates the required accuracy of the location estimate. This is
field is mandatory when Method Type is \'1\', \'2\', or \'3\' and optional
when Method Type is \'0\'.
This field is 7 bit Uncertainty Code as defined in 3GPP TS 23.032.
**Multiple Sets**
This field indicates whether MS is requested to send multiple _E-OTD/GPS/GANSS
Measurement Information Sets_. The maximum number of measurement sets is
three. This is field is mandatory. MS is expected to include the current
measurement set. Additionally MS may include historical measurement sets, or
measure new additional sets if the response time allows that.
\'0\': multiple IEs can be send;
\'1\': sending of multiple sets is not allowed.
**Environment Characterization**
Environment Characterization field provides the MS with information about
expected multipath and NLOS in the current area. This field is optional.
\'0\': possibly heavy multipath and NLOS conditions (e.g. bad urban or urban).
\'1\': no or light multipath and usually LOS conditions (e.g. suburban or
rural).
\'2\': not defined or mixed environment.
\'3\': reserved for future use.
#### A.2.2.1a GANSS Positioning Method Element
This bit map indicates the satellite systems allowed by the SMLC corresponding
to allowance of \'GPS\' in the Positioning Methods field. Each bit is of type
Boolean, where TRUE (\'1\') means the particular satellite system is allowed.
For example EOTD + Galileo method can be indicated by setting \'E-OTD or GPS\'
in Positioning Methods and setting only the \'bit 1\' to TRUE value in the
GANSS Positioning Method element. The MS shall not request assistance data or
report measurements for the systems that are not indicated in the bit map.
NOTE: Bit 0 of this bit map shall not be the only one set to TRUE (\'1\').
\'bit 0\': GPS;
\'bit 1\': Galileo;
\'bit 2\': SBAS (WAAS, EGNOS, MSAS, GAGAN);
\'bit 3\': Modernized GPS (L1C, L2C, L5);
\'bit 4\': QZSS;
\'bit 5\': GLONASS;
\'bit 6\': BDS;
\'bit 7-15\': Reserved for future GNSSes.
#### A.2.2.2 E-OTD Reference BTS for Assistance Data Element
The RTD and 51 multiframe offset values in the E-OTD Measurement Assistance
Data element and the E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data for System Information
List element are calculated relative to the BTS indicated in this element.
Also the E-OTD Measurement Assistance data for System Information List
element, if present, refers to the System Information Neighbor List of this
reference BTS.
Inclusion of this parameter is mandatory for E-OTD since it is not possible to
reliably default to the current serving BTS for the target MS, as there is a
small chance that the SMLC does not know this. If the E-OTD Measurement
Assistance data for System Information List element is present, the current
serving cell must be the same as reference BTS identified in this element.
**BCCH Carrier**
This field indicates the absolute RF channel number of BCCH of the reference
BTS. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0 - 1023
**BSIC**
This field indicates the BSIC (Base Station Identity Code) of the reference
BTS. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0 - 63
**Time Slot Scheme**
The Time Slot Scheme field indicates the type of transmission scheme the
reference BTS is using. If the MS measures BTSs signals from time slots other
than 0 or 4, and it is informed about the burst length schemes used by BTSs,
then it can compensate for the possible error. (This is necessary if the MS
averages bursts from different time slots, and the BTS uses varying lengths of
bursts.) This field is mandatory.
\'0\' = all time slots are 156,25 bits long.
\'1\' = time slots 0 and 4 are 157 bits long and other time slots are 156 bits
long.
**BTS Position**
This field contains the BTS position in the format defined in 3GPP TS 23.032.
This field is optional, but should be present for MS based E-OTD positioning.
The allowed shapes are:
\- ellipsoid point;
\- ellipsoid point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid.
#### A.2.2.3 E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data Element
This element identifies BTSs that are used for E-OTD measurements. This
element helps the MS to make measurements from neighbor BTS (even below
decoding level). This element is optional in the Measure Position Request
component. The presence of this element means that the MS should try to
measure the E-OTD values between the reference BTS and the BTSs identified in
this element.
This element is used to deliver E-OTD measurement assistance data for those
BTSs, that are not included in the System Information Neighbor List of the
reference BTS, if necessary.
The RTD and 51 multiframe offset values are calculated relative to the BTS
indicated in the E-OTD Reference BTS for Assistance Data element. This element
contains the following fields.
**Number of BTSs**
This field indicates how many BTSs are included in this IE. This field is
mandatory. The maximum number of BTSs in this message for whom the assistance
data can be given is 16 (reference BTS and 15 neigbour BTSs). Thus the sum of
**Number of BTSs** field in this IE and total amount of **E-OTD Neighbor
present** bits with value \'1\' in **E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data for
System Information List IE** can be at a maximum 15.
Range: 1 to 15.
The following fields are repeated for the number of BTSs included in the
Number of BTSs field.
**BCCH Carrier**
This field indicates the absolute RF channel number of BCCH of the particular
BTS. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0 - 1023
**BSIC**
This field indicates the BSIC (Base Station Identity Code) of the particular
BTS. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0 - 63
**Multiframe Offset**
This field indicates the frame difference between the start of the 51
multiframes frames being transmitted from this BTS and the reference BTS. The
multiframe offset is defined as T~BTS~ - T~Ref~, where T~BTS~ is the time of
the start of the 51 multiframe in the BTS in question, and T~Ref~ is the time
of the start of the 51 multiframe in the reference BTS. This field is
mandatory. Multiframe Offset may be used to calculate the Expected Multiframe
Offset (the Multiframe Offset value that MS is expected to measure between
this BTS and reference BTS in its current estimated location).
Expected Multiframe Offset = (Multiframe Offset + Adjustment) modulo 51
Adjustment = 1 if Rough RTD - Expected OTD >= 850
Adjustment = -1 if Rough RTD - Expected OTD =\ 30 bit.
NOTE: If uncertainty in MS\'s location is x bits, uncertainty in Expected OTD
is 2*x (in the worst case). When the uncertainty is given with value \'7\' no
upper bound exist for the uncertainty.
The following fields tell the coordinates of neighbor BTSs that are used for
E-OTD measurements, and also fine RTD values. This information allows the MS
to calculate its own location. These fields (Fine RTD, Relative north,
Relative east and Relative altitude) are optional. All of Fine RTD, Relative
north, and Relative east fields must be present, if some of them is included.
**Fine RTD**
This field indicates the fine RTD value between this BTS and reference BTS. It
provides the 1/256 bit duration resolution to the value expressed in the
corresponding Rough RTD field. This RTD value is the RTD value of TS0s (i.e.
the difference in starting of TS0), not only the RTD between starts of bursts.
The RTD is defined as T~BTS~ - T~Ref~, where T~BTS~ is the time of the start
of TS0 in the BTS in question, and T~Ref~ is the time of the start of the TS0
in the reference BTS. This field is optional.
Range: 0 - 255
**Relative North**
This field indicates the distance of the neighbor BTS from the reference BTS
in north- (negative values mean south) direction. This field is optional. The
units are 0,03 seconds. The used reference ellipsoid is WGS 84 ellipsoid.
Range: -200000...200000
**Relative East**
This field indicates the distance of the neighbor BTS from the reference BTS
in east (negative values mean west) direction. This field is optional. The
units are 0,03 seconds. The used reference ellipsoid is WGS 84 ellipsoid.
Range: -200000 ... 200000
**Relative Altitude**
This field indicates the altitude of the neighbor BTS relative to the
reference BTS in meters. This field is optional.
Range: -4000 .. 4000 meters
#### A.2.2.4 E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data for System Information List
Element
This element identifies those BTSs in the System Information Neighbor List
that are used for E-OTD measurements. The System Information Neighbor Lists,
to which this assistance data is given, are System Information Neighbor Lists
that are sent in the dedicated mode, packet idle mode, packet transfer mode,
or dual transfer mode. This element helps the MS to make measurements from
those neighbor BTS (even below decoding level). This element is optional in
the Measure Position Request component. The presence of this element means
that the MS should use the BTSs identified here to the E-OTD measurements.
The RTD and 51 multiframe offset values are calculated relative to the
reference BTS. This element contains the following fields.
**Number of Neighbors**
This field indicates how many neighbors are included in this IE.
Range: 1-32
The following fields are repeated for the number indicated in the Number of
Neighbors field.
**E-OTD Neighbor present**
This field indicates whether the information concerning a certain BTS in the
Neighbor List is present. Altogether no more than 15 BTS can have the
indication \"Neighbor is included\". The maximum number of BTSs in this
message for whom the assistance data can be given is 16 (reference BTS and 15
neigbour BTSs). Thus the sum of total amount of **E-OTD Neighbor present**
bits with value \'1\' in this IE and **Number of BTSs** field in **E-OTD
Measurement Assistance Data IE** can be at a maximum 15.
\'0\' Neighbor not included;
\'1\' Neighbor is included.
The following fields (BSIC, Multiframe Offset, Time Slot Sscheme and Rough
RTD) are included if E-OTD neighbor present field is set to \'1\'.
**BSIC**
This field indicates the BSIC (Base Station Identity Code) of the particular
BTS. This field is mandatory.
Range: 0 - 63
**Multiframe Offset**
This field indicates the frame difference between the start of the 51
multiframes frames being transmitted from this BTS and the reference BTS. The
multiframe offset is defined as T~BTS~ - T~Ref~, where T~BTS~ is the time of
the start of the 51 multiframe in the BTS in question, and T~Ref~ is the time
of the start of the 51 multiframe in the reference BTS. This field is
mandatory. Multiframe Offset may be used to calculate the Expected Multiframe
Offset (the Multiframe Offset value that MS is expected to measure between
this BTS and reference BTS in its current estimated location).
Expected Multiframe Offset = (Multiframe Offset + Adjustment) modulo 51
Adjustment = 1 if Rough RTD - Expected OTD >= 850
Adjustment = -1 if Rough RTD - Expected OTD =\ 30 bit.
NOTE: If uncertainty in MS\'s location is x bits, uncertainty in Expected OTD
is 2*x (in the worst case). When the uncertainty is given with value \'7\' no
upper bound exist for the uncertainty.
The following fields tell the coordinates of neighbor BTSs that are used for
E-OTD measurements, and also fine RTD values. This information allows the MS
to calculate its own location. These fields (Fine RTD, Relative north,
Relative east and Relative altitude) are optional. All of Fine RTD, Relative
north, and Relative east fields must be present, if some of them is included.
**Fine RTD**
This field indicates the fine RTD value between this BTS and reference BTS. It
provides the 1/256 bit duration resolution to the value expressed in the
corresponding Rough RTD field. This RTD value is the RTD value of TS0s (i.e.
the difference in starting of TS0), not only the RTD between starts of bursts.
The RTD is defined as T~BTS~ - T~Ref~, where T~BTS~ is the time of the start
of TS0 in the BTS in question, and T~Ref~ is the time of the start of the TS0
in the reference BTS. This field is optional.
Range: 0 - 255
**Relative North**
This field indicates the distance of the neighbor BTS from the reference BTS
in north- (negative values mean south) direction. This field is optional. The
units are 0,03 seconds. The used reference ellipsoid is WGS 84 ellipsoid.
Range: -200000...200000
**Relative East**
This field indicates the distance of the neighbor BTS from the reference BTS
in east (negative values mean west) direction. This field is optional. The
units are 0,03 seconds. The used reference ellipsoid is WGS 84 ellipsoid.
Range: -200000 ... 200000
**Relative Altitude**
This field indicates the altitude of the neighbor BTS relative to the
reference BTS in meters. This field is optional.
Range: -4000 .. 4000 meters
#### A.2.2.4a GPS Time Assistance Measurement Request element
This component does not have any information contents. If this component is
present, the MS is requested to return GPS time assistance measurements.
#### A.2.2.4b GPS Reference Time Uncertainty element
This element provides the accuracy of the relation GPS and GSM time in the
Reference Time field in GPS Assistance Data IE. If GPS TOW is the given GPS
time, then the true GPS time, corresponding to the provided GSM time as
observed at the MS location, lies in the interval (GPS TOW - GPS Reference
Time Uncertainty, GPS TOW + GPS Reference Time Uncertainty). An entity that
supports this element shall always include it when appropriate. This means
that when the element is expected but is not received, lack of support at the
sender can be assumed and some implementation dependent default interpretation
can then be applied.
The uncertainty _r_ , expressed in microseconds, is mapped to a number K, with
the following formula:
_r_ = C*(((1+x)^K^)-1)
with C = 0,0022 and x = 0,18. With 0 â‰¤ K â‰¤ 127, a suitably useful range
between 0 and 3 second is achieved for the uncertainty, while still being able
to code down to values as small as 0,3 nanoseconds. To encode any higher value
of uncertainty than that corresponding in the above formula to K=127, the same
value, K=127, shall also be used. The uncertainty is then coded on 7 bits, as
the binary encoding of K.

* * *
#### A.2.2.4c Velocity Request element
If this element is present, the MS is requested to return a velocity estimate
along with the location estimate. Requesting velocity does not guarantee its
delivery, if conditions support its availability and it is requested it will
be provided.
#### A.2.2.4d GANSS Carrier-Phase Measurement Request Element
This component does not have any information contents. If this component is
present, the MS is requested to return carrier phase measurements in the GANSS
Measurement Information IE.
#### A.2.2.4e GANSS TOD - GSM Time Association Request Element
This component does not have any information contents. If this component is
present, the MS is requested to return GANSS TOD - GSM time association
measurements. Only either GPS Timing Assistance Measurement Request Element or
GANSS TOD - GSM Time Association Measurement Request should be present in
Measure Position Request.
#### A.2.2.4f Required Response Time
This element indicates the maximum response time that shall be allowed for the
positioning request in the MS. When this element is received, the MS shall
send an RRLP Measure Position Response before the required response time has
elapsed.
When this element is received, the MS shall ignore the Response Time field in
the Positioning Instructions element.
The Required Response Time has a value from 1 to 128 seconds.
#### A.2.2.4g GANSS Multi-frequency Measurement Request Element
This component does not have any information contents.
If this component is present, the MS is requested to return measurements
performed on multiple GANSS signal types if the MS supports this capability.
If this component is not present, the MS shall report only one signal type for
each GANSS.
If SMLC has indicated supported signal types in Positioning Capability
Request, the MS shall only report signals that are supported by SMLC.
#### A.2.2.5 Extended Reference IE
This element is mandatory in any RRLP Measure Position Request component, any
RRLP Assistance Data component, any RRLP Positioning Capability Request
component and any RRLP Positioning Capability response component.
NOTE: For reasons of backward compatibility, the IE is not defined for a
Release 4 or earlier SMLC and would be ignored, when received, by a Release 4
or earlier MS. Additionally, other requirements associated with this IE would
not be supported by a Release 4 or earlier MS or SMLC.
The Extended Reference IE contains the following elements:
SMLC code: an integer in the range 0-63 distinguishing any SMLC from other
neighbour SMLCs in the same Routing Area. Each SMLC is assigned a specific
SMLC ID value. The values assigned to neighbour SMLCs in the same Routing Area
between which inter-NSE cell change is possible should be different.
Transaction ID: an integer in the range 0-262143 distinguishing different RRLP
transactions in different MSs currently being served by the same SMLC. An SMLC
shall assign a different transaction ID to each currently open RRLP
transaction for positioning and assistance data delivery among all target MSs.
When any RRLP transaction for any MS is completed in the SMLC (e.g. the MS has
sent a correctly formatted RRLP Measure Position Response or Assistance Data
Ack.) or if the transaction is aborted (e.g. SMLC timeout on an RRLP
response), the associated transaction ID value shall become free and may be
later assigned to a new RRLP transaction by the SMLC. When any transaction ID
value becomes free, an SMLC should attempt to wait for at least 128 seconds
(the maximum defined RRLP response time from an MS) before reassigning the
same value.
## A.3 Measure Position Response
### A.3.1 General
The Measure Position Response is a RRLP component from the MS to the network.

OTD measurements have been collected. This element is optional in the Measure
Position Response component. It is included in the Measure Position Response
component, if the network has requested the mobile to perform the MS assisted
E-OTD method. BTSs which cannot be measured or whose measurements are
excessively inaccurate need not be reported. The MS may include measurements
for other BTSs not given in the assistance data by the SMLC.
The E-OTD and 51 multiframe offset values are reported relative to the
reference BTS as defined in the previous sub-clauses.
The following fields are repeated for each measurement set.

The Assistance Data is a RRLP component from the network to the MS. It is used
by the network to provide assistance data to enable MS-based E-OTD or MS-based
Assisted GPS capabilities in the MS and may be used to help support MS-
assisted E-OTD and MS-assisted Assisted GPS. It contains the following
elements.

### A.4.2 Elements
#### A.4.2.1 E-OTD Reference BTS for Assistance Data Element
This element is conditional. It is as described in sub-clause 2.2.3. If the
network can provide assistance data, and data for E-OTD has been requested,
this element is included.
#### A.4.2.2 E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data Element
This element is conditional. It is as described in sub-clause 2.2.4. If the
network can provide assistance data, and data for E-OTD has been requested,
this element is included.
#### A.4.2.3 E-OTD Measurement Assistance Data for System Information List
Element
This element is conditional. It is as described in sub-clause 2.2.5. If the
network can provide assistance data, and data for E-OTD has been requested,
this element is included.
#### A.4.2.4 GPS Assistance Data Element
The GPS Assistance Data element contains a single GPS assistance message that
supports both MS-assisted and MS-based GPS methods. This element can contain
one or more of the fields listed in table A.12 below, which support both MS-
assisted and MS-based GPS methods. As table A.12 shows, all fields are
optional.
Note that certain types of GPS Assistance data may be derived, wholly or
partially, from other types of GPS Assistance data.
In addition, an Integrity Monitor (IM) shall detect unhealthy (e.g.,
failed/failing) satellites and also shall inform users of measurement quality
in DGPS modes when satellites are healthy. Excessively large pseudo range
errors, as evidenced by the magnitude of the corresponding DGPS correction,
shall be used to detect failed satellites. Unhealthy satellites should be
detected within 10 seconds of the occurrence of the satellite failure. When
unhealthy (e.g., failed/failing) satellites are detected, the assistance
and/or DGPS correction data shall not be supplied for these satellites. When
the error in the IM computed position is excessive for solutions based upon
healthy satellites only, DGPS users shall be informed of measurement quality
through the supplied UDRE values. After bad satellites have been indicated in
the Real Time Integrity field, if the satellites return to healthy condition
for some period of time, the indications for them shall be removed from this
field.

When RRLP pseudo-segmentation is used, Table A.12 indicates which parameters
may be repeated in more than one RRLP segment in order to provide data for
multiple satellites. When any such parameter appears in more than one segment,
the following rules shall apply.
1\. There shall be no repetition of data for the same satellite.
2\. Optional and conditional elements in the parameter not associated with a
particular satellite shall each appear in at most one RRLP segment.
3\. Any mandatory element not associated with a particular satellite shall
assume consistent values in the case of an element related to current GPS time
and the same value otherwise.
4\. The maximum number of satellites defined in sub-clause 5.1 for which data
can be included for any parameter in one RRLP segment shall apply also when
counted over all RRLP segments.
**Reference** **Time**
These fields specify the relationship between GPS time and air-interface
timing of the BTS transmission in the reference cell. These fields occur once
per message; some are mandatory and some are conditional, as shown in table
A.14. Note that Reference Time may also be present within the Acquisition
Assistance parameter. In such a case, the SMLC shall ensure consistency.

**GPS Week**
This field specifies the GPS week number of the assistance being provided. GPS
Week eliminates one-week ambiguities from the time of the GPS assistance. This
field is mandatory.
NOTE: The number of 1024 week cycles since the GPS zero time-point is provided
in the GPS Reference Time Extension in Table A.29u.
**GPS** **TOW**
The GPS TOW (time-of-week) is a mandatory field and is specified with 80 msec
resolution. When GSM Time Present is \"1\", GPS TOW and BCCH/BSIC/FNm/TN/BN
IEs provide a valid relationship between GPS and GSM time, as seen at the
approximate location of the MS, ie the propagation delay from BTS to MS shall
be compensated for by the SMLC. Depending on implementation, the relation
between GPS and GSM time may have varying accuracy. Therefore, the uncertainty
of the timing relation may be provided in the optional field GPS Reference
Time Uncertainty. If the propagation delay from BTS to MS is not accurately
known, the SMLC shall use the best available approximation of the propagation
delay and take the corresponding delay uncertainty into account in the
calculation of the field GPS Reference Time Uncertainty. When GSM Time Present
is \"0\", GPS TOW is an estimate of current GPS time of week at time of
reception of the RRLP segment containing this data by the MS. The SMLC should
achieve an accuracy of +/- 3 seconds for this estimate including allowing for
the transmission delay between SMLC and MS of the RRLP segment containing GPS
TOW. Note that the MS should further compensate GPS TOW for the time between
the reception of the segment containing GPS TOW and the time when the GPS TOW
field is used.
**BCCH Carrier/BSIC/FNm/TN/BN**
These fields specify the state of the GSM frame number, timeslot number, and
bit number, respectively, of the reference BTS with the specified BCCH carrier
and BSIC at the time that correspond to GPS TOW. The SMLC shall use the
current serving BTS as the reference BTS. The frame number field is given
modulo 2^21^, i.e., the MSB of the GSM frame number is truncated. The MS shall
interpret FNm as the most recent of the two possible frame numbers that FNm
could represent. The target MS has the option of rejecting a GPS position
request or GPS assistance data if the reference BTS is not the serving BTS.
**GPS TOW Assist**
This field contains several fields in the Telemetry (TLM) Word and Handover
Word (HOW) that are currently being broadcast by the respective GPS
satellites. Combining this information with GPS TOW enables the MS to know the
entire 1,2-second (60-bit) pattern of TLM and HOW that is transmitted at the
start of each six-second subframe by the particular GPS satellite. This field
contains information for each of N_SAT satellites, and optional. The
individual fields for each satellite in the message are shown in table A.15a.

These fields contain the Anti-Spoof and Alert flags that are being broadcast
by the GPS satellite identified by SatID.
**TLM Reserved**
These fields contain the two reserved bits in the TLM Word being broadcast by
the GPS satellite identified by SatID, with the MSB occurring first in the
satellite transmission.
**Reference** **Location**
The Reference Location field contains a 3-D location (with uncertainty)
specified as per 3GPP TS 23.032. The purpose of this field is to provide the
MS with a priori knowledge of its location in order to improve GPS receiver
performance. The allowed shape is 3-D location with uncertainty (ellipsoid
point with altitude and uncertainty ellipsoid).
**DGPS Corrections**
These fields specify the DGPS corrections to be used by the MS. All fields are
mandatory when DGPS Corrections are present in the GPS Assistance Data.

**GPS TOW**
This field indicates the baseline time for which the corrections are valid.
**Status/Health**
This field indicates the status of the differential corrections contained in
the broadcast message. The values of this field and their respective meanings
are shown below in table A.16.
Table A.16: Values of Status/Health IE
* * *
Code Indication 000 UDRE Scale Factor = 1,0 001 UDRE Scale Factor = 0,75 010

0,2 101 UDRE Scale Factor = 0,1 110 Reference Station Transmission Not
Monitored 111 Data is invalid - disregard
* * *
The first six values in this field indicate valid differential corrections.
When using the values described below, the \"UDRE Scale Factor\" value is
applied to the UDRE values contained in the message. The purpose is to
indicate an estimate in the amount of error in the corrections.
The value \"110\" indicates that the source of the differential corrections
(e.g., reference station or external DGPS network) is currently not being
monitored. The value \"111\" indicates that the corrections provided by the
source are invalid, as judged by the source. In the later case, the message
shall contain no corrections for individual satellites. Any MS that receives
DGPS Corrections in a GPS Assistance Data IE shall contain the appropriate
logic to properly interpret this condition and look for the next IE.
**N_SAT**
This field indicates the number of satellites for which differential
corrections are available. Corrections for up to 16 satellites.
**SatID**
This field identifies the satellite for which the corrections are applicable.
The values ranging from 0 to 63 represent satellite PRNs ranging from 1 to 64,
respectively.
**IODE**
This IE is the sequence number for the ephemeris for the particular satellite.
The MS can use this IE to determine if new ephemeris is used for calculating
the corrections that are provided in the broadcast message. This eight-bit IE
identifies a particular set of ephemeris data for a GPS satellite and may
occupy the numerical range of [0, 255]. The transmitted IODE value will be
different from any value transmitted by the GPS satellite during the preceding
six hours. For more information about this field can be found from RTCM-SC104.
**User Differential Range Error** **(UDRE)**
This field provides an estimate of the uncertainty (1-Ïƒ) in the corrections
for the particular satellite. The value in this field shall be multiplied by
the UDRE Scale Factor in the common Corrections Status/Health field to
determine the final UDRE estimate for the particular satellite. The meanings
of the values for this field are described in table A.18.
Table A.18: Values of UDRE IE

and the MS uses this to correct the pseudorange it measures at _t_ ~1~,
PR~m~(_t_ ~1,~ IODE), by
PR(_t_ ~1,\ IODE~) = PR~m~(_t_ ~1,\ IODE~) + PRC(_t_ ~1,\ IODE~) .
The SMLC shall always send the RRC value that corresponds to the PRC value
that it sends (see above for details). The MS shall only use the RRC value
when the IODE value received matches its available navigation model.
**Delta Pseudo-Range Correction 2 (Delta PRC2)**
This IE is not used. The sender shall set it to zero and the receiver shall
ignore it.
**Delta Pseudo-Range Rate Correction 2 (Delta RRC2)**
This IE is not used. The sender shall set it to zero and the receiver shall
ignore it.
**Delta Pseudo-Range Correction 3 (Delta PRC3)**
This IE is not used. The sender shall set it to zero and the receiver shall
ignore it.
**Delta Pseudo-Range Rate Correction 3 (Delta RRC3)**
This IE is not used. The sender shall set it to zero and the receiver shall
ignore it.
**Navigation** **Model**
This set of fields contains information required to manage the transfer of
precise navigation data to the GPS-capable MS. In response to a request from
an MS for GPS assistance data, the SMLC shall determine whether to send the
navigation model for a particular satellite to an MS based upon factors like
the T-Toe limit specified by the MS and any request from the MS for DGPS (also
see above). This information includes control bit fields as well as satellite
ephemeris and clock corrections. The individual fields are given in Table A.19
below, and the conditions for their presence is discussed below.

**Num_Sats_Total**
This field specifies the number of satellites that are included in the
provided Navigation Model. A range of 1-16 is available. This field is
mandatory when the Navigation Model field is included in the message.
**SatID**
This field identifies the satellite for which the assistance is applicable.
This value is the same as the PRN number provided in the navigation message
transmitted by the particular satellite. The range is 0 to 63, with 0-31
indicating GPS satellites 1-32, respectively, and 32-63 indicating satellites
in future augmentation systems (e.g., WAAS or EGNOS). This field is mandatory
for each included satellite.
**Satellite** **Status**
This field is a two-bit value that indicates the status of the Navigation
Model for the particular satellite specified by SatID. This field is mandatory
for each included satellite. The MS shall interpret the combinations of the
two bits as follows.
Table A.20: Satellite Status (per-satellite field)
* * *
MSB LSB Interpretation 0 0 New satellite, new Navigation Model 0 1 Existing
satellite, same Navigation Model 1 0 Existing satellite, new Navigation Model

* * *
This Satellite Navigation Model and associated bit fields include the
parameters that accurately model the orbit and clock state of the particular
satellite. For the particular satellite, these fields are conditional based on
the value of Satellite Status for that satellite. The fields are absent when
Satellite Status is \"01\", and present for all other values. The format for
the ephemeris, clock corrections, and associate bits are specified in ICD-
GPS-200.
**Ionospheric** **Model**
The Ionospheric Model contains fields needed to model the propagation delays
of the GPS signals through the ionosphere. The information elements in this
field are shown in table A.21. Proper use of these fields allows a
singleâ€‘frequency GPS receiver to remove approximately 50 % of the ionospheric
delay from the range measurements. The Ionospheric Model is valid for the
entire constellation and changes slowly relative to the Navigation Model. All
of the fields must be included when Ionospheric Model is present.

**Almanac**
These fields specify the coarse, long-term model of the satellite positions
and clocks. These fields are given in table A.23. With one exception (Î´i),
these parameters are a subset of the ephemeris and clock correction parameters
in the Navigation Model, although with reduced resolution and accuracy. The
almanac model is useful for receiver tasks that require coarse accuracy, such
as determining satellite visibility. The model is valid for up to one year,
typically. Since it is a long-term model, the field should be provided for all
satellites in the GPS constellation. If almanac is not provided for the full
GPS constellation, the SMLC shall set the Complete Almanac Provided field in
Table A.29w to FALSE. All fields in the Almanac are mandatory when the Almanac
is present. The fields t~oa~ and WN~a~ specify the GPS time-of-week and week
number, respectively, that are the reference points for the Almanac
parameters.
The Almanac also is useful as an acquisition aid for network-based GPS
methods. Given a recent Almanac (\ NOTE: The time relationship between the system time indicated by GANSS_ID

* * *
The first six values in this field indicate valid differential corrections.
When using the values described below, the \"UDRE Scale Factor\" value is
applied to the UDRE values contained in the message. The purpose is to
indicate an estimate in the amount of error in the corrections.
The value \"110\" indicates that the source of the differential corrections
(e.g., reference station or external DGANSS network) is currently not being
monitored. The value \"111\" indicates that the corrections provided by the
source are invalid, as judged by the source. In the later case, the message
shall contain no corrections for individual satellites. Any MS that receives
DGANSS Corrections in a GANSS Assistance Data IE shall contain the appropriate
logic to properly interpret this condition and look for the next IE.
**N_SAT**
This field indicates the number of satellites (per specified GANSS_Signal_ID)
for which differential corrections areincluded in this element.
Range: 1 - 16
**SV_ID**
The SV ID is an index number for a satellite. The interpretation of SV ID is
defined in Table A.10.14.
**Issue Of Data**
Issue of Data field contains the identity for the GANSS Navigation Model, as
defined in Table A.48.2 (i.e., excluding the IOD_MSB, if applicable for the
particular GANSS or signal).
**User Differential Range Error** **(UDRE)**
This field provides an estimate of the uncertainty (1-Ïƒ) in the corrections
for the particular satellite. The value in this field shall be multiplied by
the UDRE Scale Factor in the common Corrections Status/Health field to
determine the final UDRE estimate for the particular satellite. The meanings
of the values for this field are described in Table A.45.
Table A.45: Values of UDRE IE

and the MS uses this to correct the pseudorange it measures at _t_ ~1~,
PR~m~(_t_ ~1,~ IOD), by
PR(_t_ ~1,\ IOD~) = PR~m~(_t_ ~1,\ IOD~) + PRC(_t_ ~1,\ IOD~) .
The SMLC shall always send the RRC value that corresponds to the PRC value
that it sends (see above for details). The MS shall only use the RRC value
when the IOD value received matches its available navigation model.
**GANSS Navigation** **Model**
This set of fields contains information required to manage the transfer of
precise navigation data to the GANSS-capable MS. In response to a request from
a MS for GANSS Assistance Data, the SMLC shall determine whether to send the
navigation model for a particular satellite to an MS based upon factors like
the T-Toe limit specified by the MS and any request from the MS for DGANSS
(also see above). This information includes control bit fields as well as
satellite ephemeris and clock corrections and clock and orbit accuracy models.
GANSS Orbit Model can be given in Keplerian parameters or as state vector in
Earth-Centered Earth-Fixed coordinates, dependent on the GANSS-ID and the MS
capabilities. The meaning of these parameters is defined in relevant ICDs of
the particular GANSS and GNSS specific interpretations apply. For example,
Modernized GPS and QZSS use the same model parameters but some parameters have
a different interpretation [16].
GANSS Navigation Model element can contain data up to at most 32 satellites.
The individual fields are given in Table A.46 and the conditions for their
presence is discussed below.

**GANSS Real-Time Integrity**
Integrity Monitor (IM) shall detect unhealthy (e.g., failed/failing) satellite
signals and also shall inform users of measurement quality in DGANSS modes
when satellite signals are healthy. Excessively large pseudo range errors, as
evidenced by the magnitude of the corresponding DGANSS correction, shall be
used to detect failed satellite signals. Unhealthy satellite signals should be
detected within 10 seconds of the occurrence of the satellite signal failure.
When unhealthy (e.g., failed/failing) satellite signals are detected, the
assistance and/or DGANSS correction data shall not be supplied for these
satellite signals. When the error in the IM computed position is excessive for
solutions based upon healthy satellite signals only, DGANSS users shall be
informed of measurement quality through the supplied UDRE values. After bad
satellite signals have been indicated in the Real Time Integrity field, if the
satellite signals return to healthy condition for some period of time, the
indications for them shall be removed from this field.
GANSS Real-Time Integrity field of the GANSS Assistance Data Information
Element contains parameters that describe the real-time status of the GANSS
constellations. Primarily intended for non-differential applications, the
real-time integrity of the satellite constellation is of importance as there
is no differential correction data by which the mobile can determine the
soundness of each satellite signal. GANSS Real-Time Integrity data
communicates the health of the GNSS signals to the mobile in real-time. The
format is shown in Table A.50. The SMLC shall always transmit the GANSS Real
Time Integrity field with the current list of unhealthy signals, for any GANSS
positioning attempt and whenever GANSS Assistance Data is sent. If the number
of bad signals (NBS) is zero, then the GANSS Real Time Integrity field shall
be omitted.

# A.9 Multilateration Timing Advance Request
## A.9.1 General
The Multilateration Timing Advance Request is a RRLP component sent from the
SMLC to the MS. The SMLC uses the minimum guaranteed assessment error value of
the BTS (i.e. the BTS Reception Accuracy Capability received from the BSC as
part of assistance information and MS Sync Accuracy received from SGSN in the
PERFORM-LOCATION-REQUEST PDU) when determining the Target-Number-of-Cells to
use in the triggering RRLP message and the BTS Reception Accuracy Level
reported by that BTS (when the Multilateration Timing Advance procedure is
ongoing) to estimate the MS position and the corresponding positioning
accuracy (see 3GPP TS 45.010 and 3GPP TS 43.059). This RRLP component contains
the following elements.

## A.9.2 Elements
### A.9.2.1 Target-Number-of-Cells Element
This field is a 3 bit integer used to indicate the optimum number of cells a
MS is to use when performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure. This
field is mandatory, and has the following values:
0 0 0 : 2 cells\ 0 0 1 : 3 cells
...
1 1 1 : 9 cells
### A.9.2.2 Requested-MS-Synchronization-Accuracy Element
This field is a 4 bit integer used to indicate the synchronization accuracy
the MS should attempt to realize when performing the radio access part of the
MTA procedure using the RLC Data Block method or the Extended Access Burst
method and is coded as per the value part of the MS Synchronization Accuracy
IE defined in 3GPP TS 49.031 [7]. The synchronization accuracy requested by
this field shall be ignored when performing the radio access part of the MTA
procedure using the Access Burst method.
### A.9.2.3 MTA-Method
This field indicates the MTA method the MS is to use when performing the radio
access part of the MTA procedure and allows for indicating the following
methods.
RLC Data Block: If this method is indicated then no additional information is
included within the MTA-Method information.
Access Burst: If this method is indicated then no additional information is
included within the MTA-Method information.
Extended Access Burst: If this method is indicated then the Short BSS ID field
is included as part of the MTA-Method information.
These methods require that either PEO or EC-GSM-IoT operation is enabled in
the MS. If EC-GSM-IoT operation is enabled but CC1 is not used on the uplink
then the MS shall use the RLC Data Block method (if supported). If neither PEO
or EC-GSM-IoT operation is enabled the MS shall not perform the commanded MTA
procedure.
**Short-BSS-ID**
This parameter identifies the serving BSS within a cluster of BSS areas and is
used for the Extended Access Burst method. The Short BSS ID together with a
Random ID value identify the target MS for the Multilateration Timing Advance
procedure in a unique way in the network.
### A.9.2.4 Random-ID
This parameter is used by a MS when it performs the radio access part of the
MTA procedure using the RLC Data Block or Extended Access Burst method. The
Random ID value sent by a MS performing the radio access part of the MTA
procedure is selected from a set of up to 9 Random ID values provided by the
RRLP Multilateration Timing Advance Request message. Each Random ID value
provided by the RRLP message can only be used in one cell used by a MS when
performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure. After reception by the
BSS it is sent to the SMLC along with corresponding MTA timing advance
information using a SCCP connection that the Random ID is logically associated
with (i.e. when the SMLC first allocates a set of Random ID values for
inclusion in a RRLP message they will always be associated with a SCCP
connection used by the SMLC for an ongoing MTA procedure). The reception of
any one of the allocated Random ID values along with corresponding MTA timing
advance information therefore allows the SMLC to validate the timing advance
information.
### A.9.2.5 MPM-Timer
This field is a 3 bit integer used to indicate the maximum amount of time the
MS can use to perform the radio access part of the MTA procedure and is coded
as per the MPM Timer field defined in 3GPP TS 49.031 [7].
### A.9.2.6 Serving-Cell
This field is set to '1' if the SMLC requests the MS to include the serving
cell when performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure.
### A.9.2.7 Co-Sited-Cells
This field identifies the set of cells that are co-sited with the serving cell
and therefore shall not be used by the MS when performing the radio access
part of the MTA procedure.
### A.9.2.8 Cell-Set N
This field provides assistance information for one or more sets of cells
wherein information for at least one cell is provided within each Cell Set for
which assistance information is provided. When multiple cells are identified
for a given Cell Set then each cell in the set is co-sited and the MS shall
therefore use at most one cell from the set when performing the radio access
part of the MTA procedure. If the ARFCN and BSIC of the serving cell is
included for a cell within a Cell Set then the MS shall use that cell when
performing the radio access part of the MTA procedure.
**Short-ID**
This parameter identifies the cell specific Short ID value to be sent from the
MS to the BSS when the MS performs the radio access part of the MTA procedure
in a cell using the Access Burst method. It is part of the MTA related
measurement information passed from the BSS to the SMLC and is used by the
SMLC to validate the corresponding MTA related measurement information it
receives for that cell.
**ARFCN** \ This field is the binary representation of the absolute radio
frequency channel number (ARFCN) defined in 3GPP TS 45.005.
**BSIC-Info**
This field identifies the 9 bit BSIC (see 3GPP TS 45.003 and 3GPP TS 45.008)
associated with the indicated ARFCN.
**EC-Cell-Information**
When a cell supports EC-GSM-IoT the corresponding EC-RACH-Control-Parameters
may be included as part of the assistance information. If excluded for that
cell the MS shall default to using the EC-RACH-Control-Parameters provided for
any other cell in that set. If EC-RACH-Control-Parameters are not provided for
any cell in a set of cells that support EC-GSM-IoT then the MS shall read the
EC-BCCH for the cell in that cell set that it chooses to use to perform the
Multilateration Timing Advance procedure and thereby acquire the required EC-
RACH-Control-Parameters information.
**PEO-Cell-Information**
When a cell supports PEO the corresponding RACH-Control-Parameters may be
included as part of the assistance information. If excluded for that cell the
MS shall default to using the RACH-Control-Parameters provided for any other
cell in that set. If RACH-Control-Parameters are not provided for any cell in
a set of cells that support PEO then the MS shall read the BCCH for the cell
in that cell set that it chooses to use to perform the Multilateration Timing
Advance procedure and thereby acquire the required RACH-Control-Parameters
information.

is defined in 3GPP TS 44.018.
**EC-Max-Retrans** \ This field is a 2 bit integer and indicates the maximum
number of retransmissions on EC-RACH. It is encoded as the Max retrans field
in the RACH Control Parameters IE defined in 3GPP TS 44.018.

provided in the MOTD Measurement Request message. The index spans across all
the cells of the Serving Cell Set and Neighbour Cell Sets. (For example Index
0 refers to the first cell in the ServingCellSet. If ServingCellSet contains 3
cells, then index 3 refers to the first cell of the first Neighbour Cell Set).
**OTD Measurement Result**
This parameter indicates the observed time difference between the TDMA frame
timing of the measured cell and the serving cell. The time difference is
reported modulo 125 normal symbol periods in terms of 1/8 normal symbol period
granularity. (For example, if the TDMA frame timing of the neighbour cell is
observed to be â…› normal symbol period earlier than the TDMA frame timing of
the serving cell, 8Â·((1250-â…›) mod 125) = 999 is reported.)
