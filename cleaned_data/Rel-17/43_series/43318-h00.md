# 1 Scope
The present document defines the stage 2 service description for a Generic
Access Network (GAN) . It describes the GAN system concepts, documents the
reference architecture, functional entities, network interfaces, and high-
level procedures.
GAN supports two modes of operation:
\- GAN A/Gb mode
\- GAN Iu mode
GAN A/Gb mode supports an extension of GSM/GPRS mobile services that is
achieved by tunnelling Non Access Stratum (NAS) protocols between the MS and
the Core Network over an IP network and the A and Gb interfaces to the MSC and
SGSN, respectively.
GAN Iu mode supports an extension of UMTS mobile services that is achieved by
tunnelling Non Access Stratum (NAS) protocols between the user equipment (MS)
and the Core Network over an IP network and the Iu-cs and Iu-ps interfaces to
the MSC and SGSN, respectively.
Both GAN modes are complements to traditional GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN radio access
network coverage.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the following terms and definitions
apply:
**AP-ID:** The AP-ID (Access Point-ID) is the physical identity (e.g. MAC
address) of the generic IP access network point through which the MS is
accessing GAN service. This identifier is provided by the MS (obtained via
broadcast from the AP) to the GANC via the Up interface, when it requests GAN
service. The AP-ID may be used by the GANC to support location services. The
AP-ID may also be used by the service provider to restrict GAN service access
via only authorized APs.
**GERAN/UTRAN Mode:** MS mode of operation where the NAS layers communicate
through either the GERAN RR or the UTRAN RRC entities.
**GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN Mode: MS mode of operation where the NAS layers
communicate through either the GERAN RR, the UTRAN RRC or the E-UTRAN RRC
entities.**
_**GAN A/Gb Mode:** MS mode of operation where the NAS layers communicate
through the GA-CSR and GA-PSR entities._
_**GAN Iu Mode:** MS mode of operation where the NAS layers communicate
through the GA-RRC CS and GA-RRC PS entities._
_**GAN Mode:** This term is used when a procedure applies to both GAN A/Gb
mode and GAN Iu mode (e.g., see clause 8.1, \"_Mechanism of Mode Selection in
Multi-mode terminals\"_)._
**Generic Access Network:** access network providing access to A/Gb or Iu
interfaces via an IP network
**Generic Access Network Controller:** network node that connects to the MSC
and SGSN via the A-interface and Gb interface (GAN A/Gb mode) or the Iu-cs
interface and Iu-ps interface (GAN Iu mode) and enables access via a generic
IP network.\ Three different logical roles for the GANC are defined in this
specification: Provisioning GANC, Default GANC and Serving GANC.
**default GANC:** logical role of a GANC in the HPLMN, which redirects an MS
performing the GAN Registration Procedure to a preferred Serving GANC within
the HPLMN or VPLMN. The Serving GANC and Default GANC may be the same entity,
in which case no redirection is required.
**discovery procedure:** process by which the MS discovers the Default GANC in
the HPLMN.
**CS handover:** mobile station engaged in a call (a CS domain service) moves
between 3GPP access networks and GAN.
**handover in:** mobile station moves from 3GPP access networks to GAN.
**handover out:** mobile station moves from GAN to 3GPP access networks.
**PS handover:** A mobile station with one or more ongoing PS domain services
moves between a GAN cell and a GERAN/UTRAN cell.
**provisioning GANC:** logical role of a GANC in the HPLMN of an MS. When an
MS performs the Discovery Procedure to this GANC, the MS is provided the
address of the Default GANC in the HPLMN.
**redirection:** process by which a Default or Serving GANC redirects an MS to
an alternative Serving GANC\ This alternative GANC is likely to become the
Serving GANC for the MS.
**registration procedure:** process by which an MS requests the Generic Access
Service from a GANC.
**rove in:** mobile station reselects from 3GPP access networks to GAN.
**rove out:** mobile station reselects from GAN to 3GPP access networks.
**roving:** action of re-selection between 3GPP access technology and GAN for
a mobile station in idle mode.
**seamless:** free from noticeable transitions (i.e. no end-user action is
required; speech interruptions are short; service interruptions are short;
incoming calls are not missed; packet sessions are maintained; services work
identically).
**serving GANC:** logical role of the GANC in a PLMN which provides an MS with
the Generic Access service.
**suitable cell: t** his is a cell on which an MS may camp. It must satisfy
criteria which are defined for A/Gb mode in 3GPP TS 43.022 and for Iu mode in
3GPP TS 25.304.
**user equipment: generally referred to as \"mobile station\" in this
document**.

# 4 Architecture
## 4.1 GAN A/Gb mode architecture
The Generic Access Network A/Gb mode functional architecture is illustrated in
figure 1.
Figure 1: GAN A/Gb mode functional architecture
The main features of the GAN A/Gb mode architecture are:
\- New entities, and entities with enhanced functionality:
\- Mobile Station (MS).
\- Generic Access Network Controller (GANC). The GANC appears to the core
network as a GERAN Base Station Subsystem (BSS). It includes a Security
Gateway (SEGW) that terminates secure remote access tunnels from the MS,
providing mutual authentication, encryption and data integrity for signalling,
voice and data traffic.
\- A Generic IP Access network provides connectivity between the MS and the
GANC. The IP transport connection extends from the GANC to the MS. A single
interface, the Up interface, is defined between the GANC and the MS.
\- Co-existence with the GSM/GPRS Radio Access Network (GERAN) and
interconnection with the Core Network (CN) via the standardized interfaces
defined for GERAN A/Gb mode:
\- A-interface for circuit switched services as defined in 3GPP TS 48.008
[13].
\- Gb-interface for packet switched services as defined in 3GPP TS 48.018
[16].
\- Lb-interface for supporting location services as defined in 3GPP TS 43.059
[17].
\- CBC-BSC interface for supporting cell broadcast services as defined in 3GPP
TS 23.041
\- Transaction control (e.g. CC, SM) and user services are provided by the
core network (e.g. MSC/VLR and the SGSN/GGSN).
\- Use of AAA server over the Wm interface as defined by 3GPP TS 29.234 [8].
The AAA server is used to authenticate the MS when it sets up a secure tunnel.
Note that only a subset of the Wm functionalities is required for the GAN
application. As a minimum the GANC-SEGW shall support the Wm authentication
procedures.
Indication of support for PS Services and of support for DTM is provided
through appropriate signalling to the MS.
## 4.2 GAN Iu mode architecture
The Generic Access Network Iu mode functional architecture is illustrated in
figure 1a.
Figure 1a: GAN Iu mode functional architecture
The main features of the GAN Iu mode architecture are:
\- Entities with enhanced functionality:
\- Mobile Station (MS). The functionality of the MS defined for GAN A/Gb mode
is modified to support GAN Iu mode operation. The MS may support GAN Iu mode
operation, GAN A/Gb mode operation, or both. Mode selection is performed
during registration.
\- Generic Access Network Controller (GANC). The functionality of the GANC
defined for GAN A/Gb mode is modified so as to appear to the core network as a
UTRAN Radio Network Controller (RNC). As for GAN A/Gb mode, the GANC includes
a Security Gateway (SEGW) that terminates secure remote access tunnels from
the MS, providing mutual authentication, encryption and data integrity for
signalling, voice and data traffic.
\- A generic IP access network provides connectivity between the MS and the
GANC. The IP transport connection extends from the GANC to the MS. A single
interface, the Up interface, is defined between the GANC and the MS.
Functionality is added to this interface, over that defined for GAN A/Gb mode,
to support the GAN Iu mode service.
\- Co-existence with the UMTS Terrestrial Radio Access Network (UTRAN) and
interconnection with the Core Network (CN) via the standardized interfaces
defined for UTRAN:
\- Iu-cs interface for circuit switched services as overviewed in 3GPP TS
25.410 [45].
\- Iu-ps interface for packet switched services as overviewed in 3GPP TS
25.410 [45].
\- Iu-pc interface for supporting location services as described in 3GPP TS
25.450 [52].
\- Iu-bc interface for supporting cell broadcast services as described in 3GPP
TS 25.419 [51].
\- Transaction control (e.g. CC, SM) and user services are provided by the
core network (e.g. MSC/VLR and the SGSN/GGSN).
\- Use of AAA server over the Wm interface as defined by 3GPP TS 29.234 [8].
The AAA server is used to authenticate the MS when it sets up a secure tunnel.
Note that only a subset of the Wm functionalities is required for GAN Iu mode.
As a minimum the GANC-SEGW shall support the Wm authentication procedures.
A GANC implementation may simultaneously support both GAN A/Gb mode and GAN Iu
mode operation; the interfaces associated with both modes of operation are
shown in the following figure.
Figure 1b: Simultaneous GAN A/Gb mode and GAN Iu mode functional architecture

### 5.2.1 GAN A/Gb mode
The core network interacts with the Generic Access Network Controller (GANC)
as though it was an A/Gb mode BSS. The generic IP access network provides
connectivity between the GANC and the MS. The GANC entity inter-works between
the A/Gb interfaces and a generic IP access network, using the following
functionality:
\- User plane circuit switched services:
\- Reframing of AMR/RTP to AMR/(A-interface framing).
\- If non-TrFO, transcoding voice to/from the MS to PCM voice from/to the MSC.
\- If TrFO, transcoding maybe required if a common codec cannot be negotiated.

authentication, encryption and data integrity. The SEGW provides a subset of
the Wm functions, specifically the authentication procedures.

\- Management of GAN bearer paths for CS and PS services, including the
establishment, administration, and release of control and user plane bearers
between the MS and the GANC.
\- Functionality providing support for paging, handover and PS handover
procedures.
\- Transparent transfer of L3 messages (i.e. NAS protocols) between the MS and
core network.
### 5.2.2 GAN Iu mode
The core network interacts with the Generic Access Network Controller (GANC)
as though it was an RNC. The generic IP access network provides connectivity
between the GANC and the MS. The GANC entity inter-works between the Iu
interfaces and a generic IP access network, using the following functionality:
\- User plane circuit switched services:

carry the TAF-TRAU (V.110‑like) frames over RTP.
\- TTY is transported using CTM over GSM codec over RTP/UDP.

CS domain user plane between RTP/UDP speech bearer and the speech bearers over
the A-interface. Re-framing and transcoding is not required when the voice
call uses AMR over an IP-based A-interface.
NOTE: RTP redundancy is not used over the Up interface when the voice call
uses an IP-based A-interface.

The GAN Iu mode protocol architecture in support of the CS domain user plane
is illustrated figure 7c.
Figure 7c: CS Domain User Plane Protocol Architecture
The main features of the GAN CS domain user plane architecture are as follows:
\- The underlying Access Layers and Transport IP layer provides the generic
connectivity between the MS and the GANC.
\- The IPsec layer provides encryption and data integrity.
\- CS domain user plane is transported over RTP/UDP between MS and GANC.
\- Support for AMR FR codec, as specified in 3GPP TS 26.071 [7], is mandatory
when operating in GAN Iu mode, with support for other codecs being optional.
\- CS-data is transported over RTP/UDP, by defining a new RTP frame format to
carry the TAF-TRAU (V.110‑like) frames over RTP.
\- TTY is transported using CTM over GSM codec over RTP/UDP.
\- The GANC provides interworking between RTP/UDP and the circuit switched
bearers over the Iu-cs interface.
\- The GANC supports the Iu User Plane (Iu UP) protocol. Each Iu UP protocol
instance may operate in either transparent or support modes, as described in
25.415 [50]; the mode choice is indicated to the GANC by the MSC using RANAP.
\- The Iu-cs data transport layers (both ATM and IP-based) and associated
transport network control options are defined in 25.414 [49].
#### 6.3.2.2 CS Domain - User Plane - MS Architecture

functionality equivalent to the UTRAN RRC protocol, using the underlying Up
session managed by the GA-RC. Note that GA-RRC includes both CS service and PS
service-related signaling messages.
\- The GANC terminates the GA-RRC protocol and inter-works it to the RANAP
protocol over the Iu-ps interface.
\- NAS protocols, such as for GMM, SM and SMS, are carried transparently
between the MS and SGSN.
\- The Iu-ps signalling transport layer options (both ATM and IP-based) are
defined in 25.412 [47].

identically for both UTRAN and GAN Iu mode access.
\- The GERAN GRR-SAP and GMMRR-SAP interfaces to the MM layer are preserved
identically for both GERAN and GAN A/Gb mode access.
\- An access mode switch is provided to switch between GERAN/UTRAN and GAN
modes.
\- GA-RRC (GAN Iu mode) peers with UTRAN-RRC and GERAN-RRC to provide
coordination for roving and handover.
\- GA-PSR (GAN A/Gb mode) peers with UTRAN-RRC and GERAN-RRC to provide
coordination for roving and handover.

Notes:
1) The following cases are possible when switching the serving RR to GAN Iu
mode:
a) Transition to GA-RRC-IDLE for both CS and PS domains (i.e., idle mode
transition from GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN)
b) Transition to GA-RRC-IDLE (PS domain) and GA-RRC-CONNECTED (CS domain)
(i.e., due to CS handover from GERAN/UTRAN)
c) Transition to GA-RRC-IDLE (CS domain) and GA-RRC-CONNECTED (PS domain)
(i.e., due to PS handover from GERAN/UTRAN)
d) Transition to GA-RRC-CONNECTED (CS domain) and GA-RRC-CONNECTED (PS domain)
(i.e., due to combined CS handover and PS handover from GERAN/UTRAN)
2) The following cases are possible when switching the serving RR from GAN Iu
mode:
> e) Transition from GA-RRC-IDLE for both CS and PS domains (i.e., idle mode
> transition to GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN)

>
> h) Transition from GA-RRC-CONNECTED (CS domain) and GA-RRC-CONNECTED (PS
> domain) (i.e., due to combined CS handover and PS handover to GERAN/UTRAN)
3) There is no requirement for the MS to support both GAN Iu mode and GAN A/Gb
mode.
## 7.2 GA-RC (Generic Access Resource Control)
### 7.2.1 General
The GA-RC protocol provides a resource management layer, with the following
functions:
\- discovery and Registration with GANC, including GAN mode selection (GAN
A/Gb mode or GAN Iu mode);
\- registration Update with GANC;
\- application level keep-alive with GANC; and
\- support for identification of the AP being used for GAN access.
### 7.2.2 States of the GA-RC sub-layer
The GA-RC sub-layer in the MS can be in one of two states - GA-RC-DEREGISTERED
or GA-RC-REGISTERED - as illustrated in figure 8.
In the GA-RC-DEREGISTERED state, the MS may be in a GAN coverage area;
however, the MS has not registered successfully with the GANC and cannot
exchange GA-CSR and GA-PSR signalling messages (GAN A/Gb mode) or GA-RRC
messages (GAN Iu mode) with the GANC. The MS may initiate the GAN Registration
procedure when in the GA-RC-DEREGISTERED state. The MS returns to GA-RC-
DEREGISTERED state on loss of TCP or IPsec connection.
In the GAN A/Gb mode GA-RC-REGISTERED state, the MS is registered with a GANC,
has an IPsec and an TCP connection established to the Serving GANC, through
which the MS may exchange GA-CSR or GA-PSR signaling messages with the GANC,
and the SAP between the GA-CSR and MM entity and the GA-PSR and the GMM entity
are not active. In the GA-RC-REGISTERED state, the MS may be camped on GERAN
or UTRAN, active in GERAN or UTRAN (e.g. a GSM RR or a UTRAN RRC connection
may be established) or may have no GERAN or UTRAN service while still
maintaining the registration in the GAN.
In the GAN Iu mode GA-RC-REGISTERED state, the MS is registered with the
Serving GANC. The MS has an IPsec tunnel and a TCP connection established to
the Serving GANC through which the MS may exchange GA-RC or GA-RRC signaling
messages with the GANC. The SAP between the GA-RRC and MM entity and the GA-
RRC and the GMM entity are not active. In the GA-RC-REGISTERED state, the MS
may be camped on GERAN or UTRAN, active in GERAN or UTRAN (e.g. a GSM RR or a
UTRAN RRC connection may be established) or may have no GERAN or UTRAN service
while still maintaining the registration in the GAN.
## 7.3 GA-CSR (Generic Access Circuit Switched Resources)
### 7.3.1 General
The GA-CSR protocol provides a resource management layer, which is equivalent
to the GSM-RR and provides the following functions:
\- setup of bearer for CS traffic between the MS and GANC;
\- handover support between GERAN and GAN; and
\- functions such as GPRS suspension, paging, ciphering configuration,
classmark change.
### 7.3.2 States of the GA-CSR sub-layer
The GA-CSR sub-layer in the MS can be in two states -GA-CSR-IDLE or GA-CSR-
DEDICATED as illustrated in figure 8.
The MS enters GA-CSR-IDLE state from GA-RC-REGISTERED state, when the MS
switches the serving RR entity to GA-CSR and the SAP between the MM and the
GA-CSR is activated. Simultaneously, the GA-PSR acquires the control of the
RLC GRR and GMMRR SAPs and transitions to GA-PSR- STANDBY state. While the MS
remains in GAN A/Gb mode it performs registration Update and application level
keep-alive with the GANC as per the GA-RC-REGISTERED state.
The MS moves from the GA-CSR-IDLE state to the GA-CSR-DEDICATED state when the
GA-CSR connection is established and returns to GA-CSR-IDLE state when the GA-
CSR connection is released. Upon GA-CSR connection release an indication that
no dedicated resources exist is passed to the upper layers.
The MS may also enter GA-CSR-DEDICATED state from GA-RC-REGISTERED state of
GERAN/UTRAN mode when Handover to GAN is being performed. In the same way, the
MS enters GA-RC-REGISTERED state of GERAN/UTRAN mode from GA-CSR-DEDICATED
when Handover from GAN is being performed.
## 7.4 GA-PSR (Generic Access Packet Switched Resources)
The GA-PSR protocol provides the following services:
\- delivery of GPRS signalling, SMS messages over the secure tunnel;
\- paging, flow control, GPRS transport channel management;
\- PS handover support between GERAN/UTRAN mode and GAN A/Gb mode; and
\- transfer of GPRS user plane data.
The GA-PSR Transport Channel (GA-PSR TC) provides the association between the
MS and GANC for the transport of GPRS user data over the Up interface. Given
that the GAN user data transport is UDP based, the GA-PSR Transport Channel is
associated with corresponding MS and GANC IP addresses and UDP ports used for
GPRS user data transfer. The MS and GANC manage the GA-PSR Transport Channel
based on the requests for data transfer and the configurable GA-PSR Channel
Timer.
### 7.4.1 States of the GA-PSR sub-layer
The GA-PSR sub-layer in the MS can be in two states - GA-PSR-STANDBY or GA-
PSR-ACTIVE - as illustrated in figure 8.
**\- GA-PSR-STANDBY:** This is the initial/default state of the mobile station
in GAN A/Gb mode. The MS is not able to send or receive GPRS user data to and
from the GANC. The GA-PSR Transport Channel does not exist when the MS is in
GA-PSR-STANDBY state. The GANC or the MS needs to activate the GA-PSR
Transport Channel before sending any GPRS user data. When the MS GA-PSR
successfully establishes a GA-PSR Transport Channel, it transitions to the GA-
PSR-ACTIVE state.
**\- GA-PSR-ACTIVE:** The MS is able to send and receive GPRS user data to and
from the GANC. The corresponding GA-PSR Transport Channel exists.
Upon a successful switch to GAN A/Gb mode as a result of rove-in, the MS GA-
PSR acquires the control of the RLC GRR and GMMRR SAPs, and transitions to GA-
PSR-STANDBY state and GA-PSR TC activation may then be triggered.
After successful GA-PSR TC activation when in GAN A/Gb mode, the MS GA-PSR
transitions to GA-PSR-ACTIVE state. The following are the possible triggers
for GA-PSR TC activation when the MS is in the GA-PSR-STANDBY state in GAN
A/Gb mode:
\- The MS LLC entity initiates the uplink data transfer using LLC SAPI 3, 5, 9
or 11 and the GA-PSR sub-layer is in the GA-PSR-STANDBY state.
\- The GANC initiates GA-PSR TC activation; i.e. the MS receives a GA-PSR-
ACTIVATE UTC REQ message from the GANC (see sub-clause 8.16.4).
As described in 3GPP TS 43.129 [44], the MS and GANC establish a GA-PSR TC
during the PS handover preparation phase which results in MS enabling the
reception of downlink LLC PDUs. Upon a successful switch to GAN A/Gb mode as a
result of receiving the PS Handover Command, the MS transitions to GA-PSR-
ACTIVE state, the MS GA-PSR acquires the control of the RLC GRR and GMMRR SAPs
and enables the transmission of uplink LLC PDUs on the allocated GA-PSR TC.
Upon the successful GA-PSR TC activation and in parallel with transition to
GA-PSR-ACTIVE state, the MS GA-PSR starts the GA-PSR Channel Timer. When the
GA-PSR Channel Timer expires, the MS sends a message to the GANC to initiate
GA-PSR TC deactivation. Upon successful GA-PSR TC deactivation, the MS GA-PSR
transitions to GA-PSR-STANDBY state.
At any time, while in GAN A/Gb mode, if the serving RR entity is switched to
GERAN-RR, UTRAN RRC or E-UTRAN RRC, the GA-PSR is disconnected from GPRS SAPs
and the MS enters GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode. Simultaneously, the MS will
release the associated GA-PSR TC regardless of the GA-PSR Channel Timer
status.
The MS GA-PSR maintains one GA-PSR TC for all active user data flows; i.e. if
the GA-PSR is in GA-PSR-ACTIVE state, any uplink user data packet is
transferred using the active GA-PSR TC regardless of the associated PFC and
LLC SAP. The GA-PSR Channel Timer is restarted whenever any uplink user data
packet is sent or downlink user data packet received regardless of the
associated PFC and LLC SAP.
## 7.4a GA-RRC
### 7.4a.1 General
The GA-RRC protocol provides a resource management layer which is equivalent
to UTRAN-RRC and supports the following functions:
\- setup of transport channels for CS and PS traffic between the MS and GANC;
\- CS and PS handover support between GERAN/UTRAN and GAN;
\- direct transfer of NAS messages between the MS and the core network; and
\- other functions such as CS and PS paging and security configuration.
### 7.4a.2 States of the GA-RRC sub-layer
The GA-RRC sub-layer in the MS contains two entities, the CS domain GA-RRC
sublayer entity and the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity (as illustrated in
Figure 8). These entities operate independently and in parallel; e.g., two GA-
RRC connections are established in the case of simultaneous CS and PS
services, one GA-RRC connection for each domain.
Each GA-RRC sub-layer entity in the MS can be in one of two states, GA-RRC-
IDLE or GA-RRC-CONNECTED as illustrated in figure 8.
Both the CS GA-RRC sub-layer entity and the PS GA-RRC sublayer entity in the
MS enters the GA-RRC-IDLE state when the MS switches the serving RR entity to
GA-RRC and the SAP between the NAS and the GA-RRC is activated. This switch
may occur only when the GA-RC is in the GA-RC-REGISTERED state.
The CS/PS GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS moves from the GA-RRC-IDLE state to
the GA-RRC-CONNECTED state when the CS/PS GA-RRC connection is established and
returns to the GA-RRC-IDLE state when the CS/PS GA-RRC connection is released.
Upon CS/PS GA-RRC connection release, an indication that no dedicated
resources exist for the domain is passed to the upper layers.
The CS/PS GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS may also enter the GA-RRC-CONNECTED
state while in the GA-RC-REGISTERED state in GERAN/UTRAN mode when CS/PS
handover to GAN is being performed.
## 7.5 Security Mechanisms
GAN supports security mechanisms at different levels and interfaces as
depicted in figure 9.
Figure 9: GAN Security Mechanisms
1\. The security mechanisms over the Up interface protect signalling, voice
and data traffic flows between the MS and the GANC from unauthorized use, data
manipulation and eavesdropping; i.e. authentication, encryption and data
integrity mechanisms are supported.
2\. Authentication of the subscriber by the core network occurs between the
MSC/VLR or SGSN and the MS and is transparent to the GANC - however, there is
a cryptographic binding between the MS-CN authentication and the MS-GANC
authentication to prevent man in the middle attacks. GPRS ciphering is the
standard LLC layer ciphering that operates between the MS and the SGSN (not
applicable to GAN Iu mode). These mechanisms are out of scope of the present
document.
3\. Additional application level security mechanisms may be employed in the PS
domain to secure the end-to-end communication between the MS and the
application server. For example, the MS may run the HTTP protocol over an SSL
session for secure web access. These mechanisms are out of scope of the
present document.
All signalling traffic and user-plane traffic sent between MS and GANC over
the Up interface is protected by an IPsec tunnel between the MS and GANC-SEGW,
that provides mutual authentication (using SIM credentials), encryption and
data integrity using similar mechanisms as specified in 3GPP TS 33.234 [9].
The exact mechanisms for the purposes of the current specification are defined
in Annex A.
# 8 High-Level Procedures for GAN A/Gb Mode
## 8.1 Mechanism of Mode Selection in Multi-mode terminals
A Generic Access capable terminal may support any IP access technology in
addition to the GERAN and possibly UTRAN radio interfaces. The MS may be
either in the GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode or in GAN mode of operation.
The MS can be configured to operate in one of the above two modes at any given
time. There may be preferred mode of operation that can be configured by the
user, or by the operator through various mechanisms, e.g. device management.
On power up, the MS always starts in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode and executes the
normal power-up sequence as specified in 3GPP TS 23.122 [4]. Following this,
the MS may switch into GAN mode based on mode selection preference determined
by user preferences or operator configuration.
The various preferences for the MS that are possible are as follows:
\- GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-only:
\- The MS RR entity remains in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode and does not switch to
GAN mode.
\- GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred:
\- The MS RR entity is in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode as long as there is a
suitable GERAN, UTRAN or E-UTRAN cell available. If the MS cannot find a
suitable GERAN, UTRAN or E-UTRAN cell to camp on, and MS has successfully
registered with a GANC over the generic IP access network, then the MS
switches to GAN mode. When the MS in GAN mode is able to find a suitable
GERAN, UTRAN or E-UTRAN cell to camp on, or the MS has de-registered or loses
connectivity with the GANC over the generic IP access network, the MS returns
to GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode.
\- GAN-preferred:
\- When the MS has successfully registered with the GAN over the generic IP
access network, the MS switches to GAN mode and stays in this mode as long as
the GAN is available. When the MS deregisters, or otherwise loses connectivity
with the GAN over the generic IP access network, the MS switches to
GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode.
\- GAN-only:
\- The MS switches to GAN mode (after initial power up sequence in
GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode to obtain cellular network information, but excluding
(G)MM procedures with the core network) and does not switch to
GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode. During the initial power up sequence in
GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode the MS shall ignore paging message received through
GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN network.
## 8.2 PLMN Selection
There shall be no change from the PLMN selection procedures in the NAS layers
(MM and above) in the MS, with the exception that in GAN mode the \"in VPLMN
background scan\" shall be disabled.
A GANC can be only connected to one PLMN.
The PLMN selection in the NAS layers shall not lead to change of mode between
GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode and GAN mode. For a specific instance of PLMN
selection only PLMNs available via GAN or only PLMNs available via
GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN are provided to the NAS layer (i.e. no combination of the
PLMNs available via GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN and GAN).
In the case of a GAN capable MS, a GANC selection process also may be required
as part of the process of establishing the connectivity between the MS and the
GANC. This takes place when, during GAN registration, a GAN capable MS has a
choice among two or more GANC-PLMN pairs indicated by the Default GANC (i.e.
in the GA-RC REGISTER REDIRECT message). The GANC selection process takes
place while the MS is still in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode (i.e. before the MS
roves into GAN mode) as follows:
\- While a mobile station is attempting to become GAN registered, the GANC
selection process shall attempt GAN registration with the currently registered
PLMN if the currently registered PLMN is contained in the list of GAN PLMN
pairs indicated by the Default GANC.
\- If GAN registration with the currently registered PLMN is not possible and
there are one or more remaining GANC-PLMN pairs that were received in the GAN
PLMN list within a GA-RC REGISTER REDIRECT message, they shall all be treated
as having sufficient received signal quality and PLMN selection should be
performed according to the PLMN selection rules of 3GPP TS 22.011 [53] where
the PLMN selected is in the GAN PLMN list.
If the MS does not have any stored information related to the Serving GANC for
the cell ID or AP to which the MS is currently connected, the MS attempts to
register with the Default GANC (always located in the HPLMN) stored in MS. The
MS includes an indication, identifying the GANC as the Default GANC in the GA-
RC REGISTER REQUEST message.
When an MS attempts to register on the Default GANC including an indication
that it is in automatic PLMN selection mode:
\- If the Default GANC wishes to serve the MS, the Default GANC responds with
a GA-RC REGISTER ACCEPT message.
\- If the Default GANC wishes to redirect the MS to another GANC within the
HPLMN, the Default GANC responds with a GA-RC REGISTER REDIRECT message, not
including a list of PLMN identities.
\- If the Default GANC wishes to redirect the MS to a PLMN that is not the
HPLMN, the Default GANC responds with a GA-RC REGISTER REDIRECT message and
includes a list of PLMNs that may provide GAN service to the MS in its current
location. The list contains one or more PLMN identities along with the
identities of their associated GANC and SEGW nodes (either in IP address or
FQDN format). Following the GANC selection process, the GA-RC shall attempt to
register on the associated GANC.
If at any time the user wishes to perform manual PLMN selection or a \"User
reselection\" irrespective of whether the MS is in manual or automatic PLMN
selection mode, the MS sends a GA-RC REGISTER REQUEST message to the Default
GANC, including an indication that it is in manual PLMN selection mode. The
Default GANC is not allowed to accept the registration and responds with a GA-
RC REGISTER REDIRECT message and includes a list of PLMNs that may provide GAN
service to the MS in its current location.
If the MS includes the identity of the current serving network in the GA-RC
REGISTER REQUEST message, the Default GANC uses this to identify the list of
PLMNs to send to the MS in the response message.
The GA-RC REGISTER REDIRECT message may inform a mobile station that GAN A/Gb
mode, GAN Iu mode or both GAN A/Gb mode and GAN Iu mode are supported for each
PLMN indicated by this message.
After successful registration with a serving GANC, the MS shall not store the
PLMN list. The MS shall not use the PLMN list, provided to the MS during the
registration procedure, for background scanning.
NOTE: An MS cannot use Generic Access in a VPLMN unless the HPLMN supports and
authorises Generic Access.
After entering GAN A/Gb mode, a mobile station may trigger handover back to
GERAN/UTRAN mode by sending a GA-CSR HANDOVER INFORMATION message or GA-PSR
HANDOVER INFORMATION message to the GANC and including an ordered list of
preferred GERAN/UTRAN cells. After entering GAN Iu mode, a mobile station may
trigger handover back to GERAN/UTRAN mode by sending a GA-RRC RELOCATION
INFORMATION message to the GANC and including an ordered list of preferred
GERAN/UTRAN cells. In each case, the list of preferred GERAN/UTRAN cells shall
include cells having the same PLMN as the currently registered PLMN (if at
least one such cell is known to the MS).
## 8.3 Re-selection between GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN and GAN modes
### 8.3.1 Rove-in (from GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode to GAN mode)
This procedure is applicable only if GAN service is available, a MS is not in
NC2 mode (as defined in 3GPP TS 45.008 [18]) and has an MS preference for:
\- GAN-only;
\- GAN-preferred or;
\- GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred and the MS cannot find a suitable GERAN,
UTRAN or E-UTRAN cell to camp on.
Following successful GAN registration, the Access mode in the MS is switched
to GAN mode. GA-CSR or GA-RRC entity in the MS reports to the NAS, the NAS-
related system information received in the GAN Registration Procedure. The NAS
considers the GANC allocated cell ID, as the current serving cell.
While in GAN mode, an MS in GERAN/UTRAN, UTRAN or E-UTRAN-preferred mode may
perform GERAN/UTRAN, UTRAN or E-UTRAN cells monitoring according to 3GPP TS
45.008 and follow the behaviours according to 3GPP TS 23.122.
While in GAN mode, the GERAN-RR, UTRAN RRC and E-UTRAN RRC entities are
detached from the RR-SAP in the MS, as a result the entities do not:
\- inform NAS about any GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN cell re-selection and/or the
change of system information of the current camping cell;
\- inform NAS about any newly found PLMN over GERAN, UTRAN or E-UTRAN; and
\- act on any paging request message received over GERAN, UTRAN or E-UTRAN.
Rove-in may be applied to support CS call re-establishment following the loss
of an RR connection in GSM or to support packet service re-establishment
following abnormal TBF release with cell reselection in GPRS. The support for
call re-establishment is indicated to the MS in the GAN system information.
### 8.3.2 Rove-out (from GAN mode to GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode)
This procedure is applicable when MS detaches from the generic IP access
network, and its mode selection is GAN‑preferred or when MS finds a suitable
GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN cell for camping on, and its mode selection is
GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred.
When the MS detaches from the generic IP access network, depending on
prevailing circumstances the MS may be able to deregister first with the GANC.
For the GAN-preferred and GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred mode selections, the
MS detaches GA-CSR or GA-RRC from the RR-SAP and re-attaches GERAN-RR, UTRAN
RRC or E-UTRAN RRC to RR-SAP and restores normal GERAN-RR, UTRAN RRC or
E-UTRAN RRC functionality.
For the GAN-only mode selection, GA-CSR or GA-RRC remains attached to NAS and
the MS stays in GAN mode (in \"No Service\" condition).
## 8.4 GAN Discovery and Registration related procedures
### 8.4.1 Discovery and Registration for Generic Access
#### 8.4.1.1 General
The Discovery and Registration procedures are applicable only if the MS
preference is operating in GAN-only, GAN-preferred or, if no allowable PLMN is
available through GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN, in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred mode.
Once the MS has established a connection to the generic IP access network, the
mobile determines the appropriate GANC-SEGW to connect to, by completing the
Discovery Procedure to the Provisioning GANC in the HPLMN of the MS. The
Provisioning GANC provides the address of the Default GANC in the HPLMN of the
MS, to which the mobile can register.
The MS attempts to register on the Default GANC provided by the Provisioning
GANC during the Discovery procedure, by completing the Registration Procedure.
The Default GANC may accept the Registration; redirect the MS to another GANC;
or Reject the Registration.
#### 8.4.1.2 Security Gateway Identification
The (U)SIM of the MS contains the FQDN (or IP address) of the Provisioning
GANC and the associated SEGW or the MS derives this information based on
information in the (U)SIM. If the MS does not have any information about other
GANCs and associated SEGW stored, then the MS completes the Discovery
procedure towards the Provisioning GANC.
As part of the Registration Procedure, the Default GANC can indicate whether
this GANC and SEGW address or the address of a GANC that the MS is being
redirected to, may be stored by the MS.
The MS may also store Serving GANC information for Serving GANCs with which
the MS was able to complete a successful registration procedure. The default
GANC is in control of whether the MS is allowed to store Serving GANC
information. If there is no GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN coverage in the AP location,
the stored Serving GANC information shall be associated with the AP-ID. If
there is GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN coverage in the AP location, the stored Serving
GANC information shall be associated with the GSM CGI, UTRAN CI or E-UTRAN CI
and the LAI or TAI. The stored Serving GANC information is:
\- serving SEGW FQDN or IP address following successful registration;
\- serving GANC FQDN or IP address following successful registration; and
\- optionally, Serving GANC TCP port following successful registration and if
returned from the network.
The number of such entries to be stored in the MS is implementation specific.
Only the last successfully registered GANC association shall be stored when
the Default GANC indicates that the MS is allowed to store these addresses. An
MS may preferentially join a generic IP access network point of attachment
whose association with a Serving GANC has been stored in memory.
On connecting to the generic IP access network, if the MS has a stored Serving
GANC for the AP-ID or the GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN cell, the MS shall attempt to
register with the associated Serving GANC in its memory. The GANC may still
reject the MS for any reason even though it may have served the MS before. The
MS shall delete from its stored list the address of the Serving GANC on
receiving a registration reject or if the registration fails for any other
reason (e.g. not receiving any response).
If the MS does not receive a response to the Registration Request sent to the
Serving GANC (and which is not the Default GANC), it shall re-attempt to
register with the Default GANC. If the MS does not receive a response to the
registration request sent to the Default GANC, it shall attempt the discovery
procedure with the Provisioning GANC in order to obtain a new Default GANC.
In the case when a MS is attempting to register or discover a GANC after
failing to register on a GANC, the MS provides in the Registration or
Discovery procedure an indication that the MS has attempted to Register on
another GANC, the failure reason, and the GANC and SEGW addresses of the
failed registration.
When the MS connects to a generic IP access network, for which it does not
have a stored Serving GANC in it\'s memory, it shall attempt to register with
the Default GANC.
#### 8.4.1.3 GANC capabilities
To be populated with GANC specific information that needs to be transferred to
the MS on successful registration.
#### 8.4.1.4 MS capabilities
To be populated with GAN specific capabilities of the MS that needs to be
transferred to the GANC during registration and the interaction to what is
reported to the CN is FFS.
#### 8.4.1.4a Required GAN Services
The MS may request which GAN services it requires from the GANC as part of the
Registration procedures.
#### 8.4.1.4b GAN Mode Selection
The MS (i.e., with GAN Iu mode support) transfers its GAN Mode Support
information to the GANC during Discovery and Registration procedures; i.e., in
the GAN Classmark IE. GAN Mode Support options are GAN A/Gb mode supported,
GAN Iu mode supported, or both modes supported. If no GAN Mode Support
information is received, the GANC assumes that the MS supports GAN A/Gb mode
operation only.
The provisioning GANC may use the received GAN Mode Support information to
assign the MS to an appropriate default GANC (e.g., if separate GAN A/Gb mode
and GAN Iu mode GANCs are deployed in the network) or to an appropriate TCP
port on the default GANC (e.g., if separate TCP ports are used for GAN A/Gb
mode and GAN Iu mode service). During registration, the GAN Iu mode capable
GANC shall also indicate the GAN mode to use for the current session in the
GAN Mode Indicator IE; this allows the MS to determine the GAN Iu mode
capability of the Home PLMN.
The following table enumerates the discovery handling for the various
combinations of MS and Home PLMN GAN mode capabilities.
Table 1: GAN Mode Selection procedures associated with GAN Discovery

Note 1: The GANC\'s choice of GAN Iu mode versus GAN A/Gb mode may be based on
other information received in the GAN discovery message from the MS,
information stored in the GANC, and on operator policy.
The default or serving GANC may use the received GAN Mode Support information
to redirect the MS to a different GANC or a different TCP port on the current
GANC. The GAN Iu mode capable GANC shall also indicate the GAN mode to use for
the current session in the GAN Mode Indicator IE.
The following table enumerates the registration handling for the various
combinations of MS and Default/Serving GANC GAN mode capabilities.

Note 1: The GANC\'s choice of GAN Iu mode versus GAN A/Gb mode may be based on
other information received in the GAN registration message from the MS,
information stored in the GANC, and on operator policy.
#### 8.4.1.5 Discovery Procedure
##### 8.4.1.5.1 Normal Case
When an MS supporting GAN first attempts to connect to a GAN, the MS needs to
identify the Default GANC. Each GAN capable MS can be configured with the FQDN
(or IP address) of the Provisioning GANC and the associated SEGW or the MS can
derive this FQDN based on information in the (U)SIM (see 3GPP TS 23.003 [43]).
The MS first connects to a Provisioning GANC-SEGW and GANC in the HPLMN of the
MS, by establishing a secure IPsec tunnel and a TCP connection using the
provisioned or derived addresses. The MS obtains the FQDN or IP address of the
Default GANC in the HPLMN and the associated SEGW, through the Discovery
procedure.
If no GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN coverage is available when an MS connects to the
GANC for GAN service, then the GANC cannot necessarily determine the location
of the MS for the purposes of assigning the MS to the correct serving GANC
(e.g., to enable handover and location-based services). The GANC shall permit
the operator to determine the service policy in this case; e.g. the operator
could provide service to the user with certain limitations (possibly with a
user interface indication on the MS).
NOTE: When the MS initiates the Discovery/Registration procedures and no
GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN coverage is available, the GANC may have insufficient
information to correctly route subsequent emergency calls.
Figure 10: Discovery procedure
In the description below it is assumed that the MS has a mode selection of
GAN-only or GAN-preferred or GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred and that the MS has
already connected to the generic IP access network.
NOTE: It is implementation specific what signal level should be deemed as
sufficient for triggering the GAN Discovery and Registration procedures.
1\. If the MS has a provisioned or derived FQDN of the Provisioning SEGW, it
performs a DNS query (via the generic IP access network interface) to resolve
the FQDN to an IP address. If the MS has a provisioned IP address for the
Provisioning SEGW, the DNS step is omitted.
2\. The DNS Server returns a response including the IP Address of the
Provisioning SEGW.
3\. The MS establishes a secure tunnel to the Provisioning SEGW.
4\. If the MS has a provisioned or derived FQDN of the Provisioning GANC, it
performs a DNS query (via the secure tunnel) to resolve the FQDN to an IP
address. If the MS has a provisioned IP address for the Provisioning GANC, the
DNS step will be omitted.
5\. The DNS Server returns a response including the IP Address of the
Provisioning GANC.
6\. The MS sets up a TCP connection to a well-defined port on the Provisioning
GANC. It then queries the Provisioning GANC for the Default GANC, using GA-RC
DISCOVERY REQUEST. The message contains:
\- If the MS is camped on a GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN cell, the current camping
GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN cell ID.
\- The last LAI or TAI where the MS successfully registered.
\- Generic IP access network attachment point information: AP-ID, as defined
in annex C.
\- MS Identity: IMSI.
\- GAN Classmark: Including GAN Mode Support information indicating GAN A/Gb
mode supported, GAN Iu mode supported or both modes supported.
7\. The Provisioning GANC returns the GA-RC DISCOVERY ACCEPT message, using
the information provided by the MS (e.g. the CGI), to provide the FQDN or IP
address of the Default GANC and its associated Default SEGW. This is done so
the MS is directed to a \"local\" Default GANC in the HPLMN to optimize
network performance.
8\. If the Provisioning GANC cannot accept the GA-RC DISCOVERY REQUEST
message, it returns a GA-RC DISCOVERY REJECT message indicating the reject
cause.
9\. The secure IPsec tunnel to the Provisioning SEGW is released. It shall
also be possible to reuse the same IPsec tunnel for GAN Registration
procedures. In this case the IPsec tunnel is not released.
#### 8.4.1.6 Registration procedure
##### 8.4.1.6.1 Normal case
Following the Discovery procedure the MS establishes a secure tunnel with the
secure gateway of the Default GANC, provided by the Provisioning GANC in the
Discovery procedure, and attempts to register with the Default GANC. The
Default GANC may become the Serving GANC for that connection by accepting the
registration, or the Default GANC may redirect a MS performing registration to
a different Serving GANC.
GANC redirection may be based on information provided by the MS during the
Registration procedure, operator chosen policy or network load balancing.
The GAN Registration procedure serves the following functions:
\- Ensures the MS is registered to the appropriate GANC entity i.e. with use
of the redirection process;
\- Informs the GANC that the MS is now connected through a generic IP access
network and is available at a particular IP address. The GANC maintains the
registration context for the purposes of (for example) mobile-terminated
calling;
\- Provides the MS with the operating parameters associated with the GAN
service, including the GAN mode to use for the session, either A/Gb or Iu. The
\"System Information\" message content that is applicable to the GAN cell is
delivered to the MS during the GAN registration process. This enables the MS
to switch to GAN mode, and following the Registration procedure trigger NAS
procedures with the core network (such as Location/Routing Area Update, mobile
originated calls, mobile terminated calls, etc.); and
\- Enables the MS to request which GAN services are required.
NOTE: The GA-RC REGISTER REDIRECT message may contain: a single Serving SEGW
and GANC address or a list of PLMN identities and associated Serving SEGW and
GANC addresses; and an Indication of whether GANC address(es) can be stored in
the MS for future use.
Figure 11: Registration procedure
1\. If the MS was provided the FQDN of the Default or Serving SEGW, the MS
shall perform a DNS query (via the generic IP access network interface) to
resolve the FQDN to an IP address. If the MS has a provisioned IP address for
the SEGW, the DNS step is omitted.
2\. The DNS Server returns a response.
3\. The MS shall then set up a secure IPsec tunnel to the SEGW. This step may
be omitted if an IPsec tunnel is being reused from an earlier Discovery or
Registration.
4\. If the MS was provided the FQDN of the Default or Serving GANC, the MS
shall then perform a DNS query (via the secure tunnel) to resolve the FQDN to
an IP address. If the MS has an IP address for the GANC, the DNS step is
omitted.
5\. The DNS Server returns a response.
6\. The MS then sets up a TCP connection to a TCP port on the GANC. The TCP
port can either be a well-known port or one that has been earlier received
from the network during Discovery or Registration. The MS shall attempt to
register on the GANC by transmitting the GA-RC REGISTER REQUEST. The message
includes:
\- If the MS is camped on a GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN cell, the MS includes the
current camping GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN cell ID.
\- If the MS is camped on a UTRAN cell, the MS includes the UARFCN of the
current serving cell.
\- The last LAI or TAI where the MS successfully registered.
\- Generic IP access network attachment point information: AP-ID, as defined
in annex C.
\- MS Identity: IMSI.
\- MS Capability Information.
> \- GAN Services Required
>
> \- GAN Classmark: Including GAN Mode Support information indicating GAN A/Gb
> mode supported, GAN Iu mode supported or both modes supported, and an
> indication of whether or not the MS supports RFC 4867 [54] bandwidth-
> efficient mode.
7\. If the GANC accepts the registration attempt it shall respond with a GA-RC
REGISTER ACCEPT. The message contains:
\- GAN specific system information (e.g.):
\- GAN Mode Indicator: GAN A/Gb mode or GAN Iu mode.
\- Cell description of the GAN cell:
\- If GAN A/Gb mode selected: The BCCH ARFCN, PLMN colour code, and base-
station colour code corresponding to the GAN cell.
\- If GAN Iu mode selected: The UTRA ARFCN (UARFCN) and Primary Scrambling
Code (PSC) corresponding to the GAN cell.
\- Location-area identification comprising the mobile country code, mobile
network code, and location area code corresponding to the GANC cell.
\- Cell identity identifying the cell within the location area corresponding
to the GAN cell.
\- Applicable system timer values (e.g., for the application-level keep-alive
message transmission interval, see clause 8.4.4).
\- GAN Capability Information.
In this case the TCP connection and the secure IPsec tunnel are not released
and are maintained as long as the MS is registered to this GANC.
8\. Alternatively, the GANC may reject the request. In this case, it shall
respond with a GA-RC REGISTER REJECT indicating the reject cause. The TCP
connection and the secure IPsec tunnel are released and the MS shall act as
defined in clause 8.4.1.3.2.
9\. Alternatively, if the GANC wishes to redirect the MS to (another) Serving
GANC, it shall respond with a GA-RC REGISTER REDIRECT providing the FQDN or IP
address of the target Serving GANC and the associated SEGW. In this case the
TCP connection is released and the secure IPsec tunnel is optionally released
depending on if the network indicates that the same IPsec tunnel can be reused
for the next registration.
##### 8.4.1.6.2 Abnormal cases
If the Serving GANC rejects the Register request and does not provide
redirection to another Serving GANC, the MS shall re-attempt Registration to
the Default GANC including a cause indicating the failed registration attempt
and the Serving GANC and SEGW with which the Register request failed. The MS
should also delete all stored information about this Serving GANC.
If the Default GANC rejects a Registration Request and is unable to provide
redirection to suitable Serving GANC, the MS may re-attempt the Discovery
procedure to the Provisioning GANC (including a cause indicating the failed
registration attempt and the Default GANC provided in the last Discovery
procedure). The MS should also delete all stored information about the Default
GANC.
### 8.4.2 De-Registration
The GA-RC De-Registration procedure allows the MS to explicitly inform the
GANC that it is leaving GAN mode (e.g. when it detaches from the generic IP
access network), by sending a GA-RC DEREGISTER message to the GANC, allowing
the GANC to free resources that it assigned to the MS. The GANC also supports
\"implicit GAN deregistration\", when the TCP connection to the MS is abruptly
lost.
The GANC can also autonomously release the MS registration context, and send a
GA-RC DEREGISTER message to the MS. Alternatively, the GANC can implicitly
deregister the MS by closing the TCP connection with the MS.
NOTE: At power-down the GA-RC sublayer of the MS ensures that the MS
explicitly detaches from the network, where possible, before completing the
GA-RC De-Registration procedure.
Figure 12: De-Registration initiated by the MS
1\. The MS sends the GA-RC DEREGISTER to the GANC, which removes the MS
context in the GANC.
Figure 13: De-Registration initiated by the GANC
1\. The GANC sends the GA-RC DEREGISTER to the MS.
### 8.4.3 Registration Update
The GA-RC Registration Update procedure allows the MS to update information in
the GANC by sending a GA-RC REGISTER UPDATE UPLINK message to the GANC
carrying the updated information. This message is sent as a result of the
following:
\- Detecting the availability of GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN coverage after reporting
no coverage during GAN registration.
\- Changes to the identity of the serving GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN cell while in
GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode.
\- Changes to the UARFCN of the serving UTRAN cell while in UTRAN mode.
\- Establishment of a new serving cell as a result of inter-RAT handover from
GERAN to UTRAN or E-UTRAN to UTRAN.
\- Changes to the generic IP access network point of attachment.
This may result in the MS being redirected to another serving GANC, or being
denied service e.g. due to operator policy.
The GAN Registration Update procedure also allows the GANC to update the GAN
system information in the MS, if needed, by sending a GA-RC REGISTER UPDATE
DOWNLINK message to the MS carrying the updated information.
Figure 14: Registration Update Uplink
1\. When the MS detects any of the conditions listed above, it shall send the
GA-RC REGISTER UPDATE UPLINK to the GANC with the updated information.
Whenever the generic IP access network point of attachment changes, the MS
shall send a GA-RC REGISTER UPDATE UPLINK to the GANC with the updated generic
IP access network point of attachment information. If the MS requires to
update the GANC with a new list of GAN Services required, then the MS sends
GA-RC REGISTER UPDATE UPLINK message to the GANC including the new GAN
Services Required list.
2\. The GANC may optionally send the GA-RC REGISTER REDIRECT when it wants to
redirect the MS based on updated information.
3\. The GANC may also optionally deregister the MS on receiving an update by
sending GA-RC DEREGISTER to the MS.
Figure 15: Registration Update Downlink
1\. The GANC sends GA-RC REGISTER UPDATE DOWNLINK with the updated system
information.
### 8.4.4 Keep Alive
The Keep Alive process is a mechanism between the peer GA-RC entities to
indicate that the MS is still registered to the GANC. Using periodic
transmissions of the GA-RC KEEP ALIVE message the MS in turn determines that
the GANC is still available using the currently established lower layer
connection.
Figure 16: Keep Alive procedure
1\. The MS sends GA-RC KEEP ALIVE to the GANC.
### 8.4.5 Cell Broadcast Information
The Cell Broadcast Information is a mechanism between the peer GA-RC entities,
allowing the GANC to pass the MS information relating to the Cell Broadcast
Services. The MS includes GAN Service Required information in the GA-RC
REGISTER REQUEST and GA-RC REGISTER UPDATE UPLINK messages passed to the GANC,
indicating that the MS requires the Cell Broadcast Service. The GANC then
passes the required information to the MS in the GA-RC CELL BROADCAST INFO
message.
Figure 16a: Cell Broadcast Information
1\. The GANC sends the CELL BROADCAST INFO message to the MS, including
information required by the MS.
## 8.5 Authentication
The Up interface shall support the ability to authenticate the MS with the
GANC (for the purposes of establishing the secure tunnel) using GSM or UMTS
credentials. Authentication between MS and GANC shall be performed using EAP-
SIM or EAP-AKA within IKEv2.
The MS and GANC-SEGW establish a secure association for protecting signalling
traffic and user-plane (voice and data) traffic. The protocol for
authentication is IKEv2. Mutual authentication and key generation is provided
by EAP-SIM or EAP-AKA.
The basic elements of these procedures are the following:
\- The MS connection with the GANC-SEGW is initiated by starting the IKEv2
initial exchanges (IKE_SA_INIT). The EAP-SIM or EAP-AKA procedure is started
as a result of these exchanges.
\- The EAP-SIM procedure for MS with SIM only or MS with USIM, but not capable
of UMTS AKA, is performed between MS and AAA server (that has access to the
AuC/HLR/HSS to retrieve subscriber information). The EAP-AKA procedure for MS
with USIM and the MS is capable of UMTS AKA, is performed between MS and AAA
server. The GANC-SEGW acts as relay for the EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA messages.
\- When the EAP-SIM/EAP-AKA procedure has completed successfully, the IKEv2
procedure can be continued to completion and the signalling channel between MS
and GANC-SEGW is secured. The MS and GAN can then continue with the discovery
or registration procedure.
\- Signalling flows for EAP-SIM and EAP-AKA authentication and fast re-
authentication are shown in annex A.
## 8.6 Encryption
All control and user plane traffic over the Up interface shall be sent through
the IPsec tunnel that is established as a result of the authentication
procedure. Encryption shall use the negotiated cryptographic algorithm, based
on core network policy, enforced by the GANC-SEGW.
The MS and GANC-SEGW set up one Secure Association through which all traffic
is sent. A single negotiated ciphering algorithm is applied to the connection.
### 8.6.1 Establishment of a Secure Association
After the authentication procedure (clause 8.5), the MS shall request an IP
address on the network protected by the GANC-SEGW (i.e. the public IP
interface of the GANC). The MS shall set up one IPsec Security Association
(SA) between MS and GANC-SEGW.
The MS shall initiate the creation of the SA i.e. it shall act as initiator in
the Traffic Selector negotiation. The protocol ID field in the Traffic
Selectors (TS) shall be set to zero, indicating that the protocol ID is not
relevant. The IP address range in the TSi shall be set to the address assigned
to the MS (within the network protected by the GANC-SEGW). The IP address
range in the TSr shall be set to 0.0.0.0 \- 255.255.255.255. The MS and GANC-
SEGW shall use the IKEv2 mechanisms for detection of NAT, NAT traversal and
keep-alive.
All control and user plane data over the Up interface between MS and GANC
shall be sent through the SA.
The ciphering mode is negotiated during connection establishment. During setup
of the SA, the MS includes a list of supported encryption algorithms as part
of the IKE signalling, which include the mandatory and supported optional
algorithms defined in the IPsec profile, and NULL encryption. The GANC-SEGW
selects one of these algorithms, and signals this to the MS.
When NULL encryption is applied, both control and user-plane traffic is sent
unencrypted. This configuration can be selected e.g. when the connection
between the generic IP access network and the GANC is under operator control.
The integrity algorithm is the same as for either configuration i.e. non-
ciphered traffic is still integrity protected.
## 8.7 GA-CSR Connection handling
The GA-CSR connection is a logical connection between the MS and the GANC for
the CS domain. It is established when the upper layers in the MS request GA-
CSR to enter dedicated mode. When a successful response is received from the
network, GA‑CSR replies to the upper layer that it has entered dedicated mode.
The upper layers have then the possibility to request transmission of NAS
messages to the network.
### 8.7.1 GA-CSR Connection Establishment
Figure 17 shows successful establishment of the GA-CSR Connection.
Figure 17: GA-CSR Connection Establishment
1\. The MS initiates GA-CSR connection establishment by sending the GA-CSR
REQUEST message to the GANC. This message contains the Establishment Cause
indicating the reason for GA-CSR connection establishment.
2\. GANC signals the successful response to the MS by sending the GA-CSR
REQUEST ACCEPT and the MS enters dedicated mode and the GA-CSR state changes
to GA-CSR-DEDICATED.
3\. Alternatively, the GANC may return a GA-CSR REQUEST REJECT indicating the
reject cause.
### 8.7.2 GA-CSR Connection Release
Figure 18 shows release of the logical GA-CSR connection between the MS and
the GANC.
Figure 18: GA-CSR Connection Release
1\. The CN indicates to the GANC to release the user plane connection
allocated to the MS, via the _Clear Command_.
2\. The GANC confirms resource release to CN using the _Clear Complete_
message.
3\. The GANC commands the MS to release resources, using the GA-CSR RELEASE
message.
4\. The MS confirms resource release to the GANC using the GA-CSR RELEASE
COMPLETE message and the MS enters idle mode and the GA-CSR state in the MS
changes to GA-CSR-IDLE.
## 8.8 Ciphering Configuration
The message flow for ciphering configuration is shown in figure 19.
Figure 19: Ciphering Configuration
1\. The CN sends BSSMAP \"_Cipher Mode Command_ \" message to GANC. This
message contains the cipher key Kc, and the encryption algorithms that the
GANC may use.
2\. The GANC sends GA-CSR CIPHERING MODE COMMAND to the MS. This message
indicate whether stream ciphering shall be started or not (after handover to
GERAN) and if so, which algorithm to use, and a random number. The mobile
station stores the information for possible future use after a handover to
GERAN. The message also indicates whether the MS shall include IMEISV in the
GA-CSR CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message.
3\. The MS computes a MAC based on the random number, the MS IMSI and the key
Kc. The MS then sends GA‑CSR CIPHERING MODE COMPLETE message to signal its
selected algorithm, the computed MAC, and the IMEISV, if indicated so in the
GA-CSR CIPHERING MODE COMMAND.
4\. This GANC verifies the MAC. If the GANC verifies MAC to be correct it
sends _Cipher Mode Complete_ message to the CN.
NOTE: The MAC proves that the identity that is authenticated to the GANC is
the same as the identity authenticated to the core network. The configuration
option of not enabling ciphering in the network will therefore open up the
network to more security threats than in GERAN.
## 8.9 GA-CSR Signalling and SMS Transport Procedures
### 8.9.1 Network initiated CS Signalling
Figure 20: Downlink Control Plane Transport
1\. For Network initiated signalling/SMS, the Core Network sends a MM/CC
signalling or SMS message to the GANC via the A interface.
2\. The GANC encapsulates the received message within a GA-CSR DL DIRECT
TRANSFER message that is forwarded to the MS via the existing TCP connection.
### 8.9.2 MS initiated CS Signalling
Figure 21: Uplink Control Plane Transport
1\. For MS initiated signalling/SMS, the MS GA-CSR receives a request from the
NAS layer to transfer an uplink NAS signalling message or SMS message. The MS
**GA-CSR** encapsulates the NAS message within a GA-CSR UL DIRECT TRANSFER
message and sends the message to the GANC.
2\. The GANC relays the received message to the Core Network encapsulated in
DTAP.
## 8.10 Mobile Originated Call Flow
Figure 22: Mobile Originated Call
The description of the procedure in this sub-clause assumes the MS is in GAN
A/Gb mode i.e. it has successfully registered with the GANC and GA-CSR is the
serving RR entity in the MS.
> 1\. The GA-CSR Connection Establishment procedure is performed as described
> in clause 8.7.1.
>
> 2\. Upon request from the upper layers, the MS sends the _CM Service
> Request_ to the GANC in the GA-CSR UL DIRECT TRANSFER.
>
> 3\. The GANC establishes an SCCP connection to the CN and forwards the _CM
> Service Request_ to the CN using the _Complete Layer 3 Information_.
> Subsequent layer-3 messages between mobile station and core network will be
> sent between GANC and CN via DTAP.
>
> 4\. The CN may optionally authenticate the MS using standard GERAN
> authentication procedures.
>
> 5\. The CN may optionally initiate the Ciphering Configuration procedure
> described in clause 8.8.
>
> 6\. The MS sends the _Setup_ message providing details on the call to the CN
> and its bearer capability and supported codecs. This message is contained
> within the GA-CSR UL DIRECT TRANSFER between the MS and the GANC. The GANC
> forwards the _Setup_ message to the CN.
>
> 7\. The CN indicates it has received the call setup and it will accept no
> additional call-establishment information using the _Call Proceeding_
> message to the GANC. GANC forwards this message to the MS in the GA-CSR DL
> DIRECT TRANSFER.
>
> 8\. The CN requests the GANC to assign call resources using _Assignment
> Request_.
>
> 9\. The GANC sends the GA-CSR ACTIVATE CHANNEL to the MS including bearer
> path setup information such as:
>
> \- Channel mode.
>
> \- Multi-rate codec configuration.
>
> \- UDP port & the IP address for the uplink RTP stream.
>
> \- Voice sample size.
>
> \- An indication of whether RFC 4867 [54] octet-aligned mode (i.e., the
> default for GAN A/Gb mode) or bandwidth-efficient mode shall be used for the
> GA-CSR traffic channel. If an IP-based A-interface where bandwidth-efficient
> mode is used and the MS supports RFC 4867 bandwidth-efficient mode (see sub-
> clause 8.4.1.6), the GANC can enable \"AoIP payload optimization\" (i.e.,
> avoiding the need for the GANC to do transcoding or conversion between RFC
> 4867 payload modes) by indicating that RFC 4867 bandwidth-efficient mode be
> used for the GA-CSR traffic channel.
>
> 10\. The MS establishes the RTP path to the GANC. MS optionally sends idle
> RTP/UDP packets to the GANC but has not connected the user to the audio
> path.
>
> 11\. The MS sends the GA-CSR ACTIVATE CHANNEL ACK to the GANC indicating the
> UDP port for the downlink RTP stream.
>
> 12\. If a TDM-based A-interface channel is used for the call, the GANC
> establishes the downlink RTP path between itself and the MS. The GANC may
> start sending idle RTP/UDP packets to the MS.
>
> 13\. The GANC signals to the CN that the call resources have been allocated
> by sending an _Assignment Complete_ message.
>
> 14\. The GANC signals the completion of the bearer path to the MS with the
> GA-CSR ACTIVATE CHANNEL COMPLETE message. An end-to-end audio path now
> exists between the MS and the CN. The MS can now connect the user to the
> audio path.
>
> 15\. The CN signals to the MS, with the _Alerting_ message, that the B-Party
> is ringing. The message is transferred to the GANC and GANC forwards the
> message to the MS in the GA-CSR DL DIRECT TRANSFER. If the MS has not
> connected the audio path to the user, it shall generate ring back to the
> calling party. Otherwise, the network-generated ring back will be returned
> to the calling party.
>
> 16\. The CN signals that the called party has answered, via the _Connect_
> message. The message is transferred to the GANC and GANC forwards the
> message to the MS in the GA-CSR DL DIRECT TRANSFER. It connects the user to
> the audio path. If the mobile station is generating ring back, it stops and
> connects the user to the audio path.
>
> 17\. The MS sends the _Connect Ack_ in response, and the two parties are
> connected for the voice call. This message is contained within the GA-CSR UL
> DIRECT TRANSFER between the MS and the GANC. The GANC forwards the _Connect
> Ack_ message to the CN.
>
> 18\. Bi-directional voice traffic flows between the MS and CN through the
> GANC.
## 8.11 Mobile Terminated Call Flow
Figure 23: Mobile Terminated Call
The description of the procedure in this clause assumes the MS is in GAN A/Gb
mode i.e. it has successfully registered with the GANC and GA-CSR is the
serving RR entity in the MS.
> 1\. A mobile-terminated call arrives at the CN. The CN sends a _Paging
> message_ to the GANC identified through the last _Location Update_ received
> by it and includes the TMSI if available. The IMSI of the mobile being paged
> is always included in the request.
>
> 2\. GANC identifies the MS registration context using the IMSI provided by
> the CN. It then pages the MS using the GA-CSR PAGING REQUEST message. The
> message includes the TMSI, if available in the request from the CN, else it
> includes only the IMSI of the mobile.
>
> 3\. The MS responds with a GA-CSR PAGING RESPONSE including the MS Classmark
> and ciphering key sequence number. The MS enters dedicated mode and the GA-
> CSR state changes to GA-CSR-DEDICATED.
>
> 4\. The GANC establishes an SCCP connection to the CN. The GANC then
> forwards the paging response to the CN using the _Complete Layer 3
> Information_ message.
>
> 5\. The CN may optionally authenticate the MS using standard GERAN
> authentication procedures.
>
> 6\. The CN may optionally update the ciphering configuration in the MS, via
> the GANC, as described in clause 8.8.
>
> 7\. The CN initiates call setup using the _Setup_ message sent to the MS via
> GANC. GANC forwards this message to the MS in the GA-CSR DL DIRECT TRANSFER
> message.
>
> 8\. The MS responds with _Call Confirmed_ using the GA-CSR UL DIRECT
> TRANSFER after checking it\'s compatibility with the bearer service
> requested in the _Setup_ and modifying the bearer service as needed. If the
> _Setup_ included the signal information element, the MS alerts the user
> using the indicated signal, else the MS alerts the user after the successful
> configuration of the user plane. The GANC forwards the _Call Confirmed_
> message to the CN.
>
> 9\. The CN initiates the assignment procedure with the GANC, which triggers
> the setup of the GA-CSR traffic channel, the same as steps 8-13 in the MO
> call scenario (see sub-clause 8.10).
>
> 10\. The MS signals that it is alerting the user, via the _Alerting_ message
> contained in the GA-CSR UL DIRECT TRANSFER. The GANC forwards the _Alerting_
> message to the CN. The CN sends a corresponding alerting message to the
> calling party.
>
> 11\. The MS signals that the called party has answered, via the _Connect_
> message contained in the GA-CSR UL DIRECT TRANSFER. The GANC forwards the
> _Connect_ message to the CN. The CN sends a corresponding _Connect_ message
> to the calling party and through connects the audio. The MS connects the
> user to the audio path.
>
> 12\. The CN acknowledges via the _Connect Ack_ message to the GANC. GANC
> forwards this message to the MS in the GA-CSR DL DIRECT TRANSFER. The two
> parties on the call are connected on the audio path.
>
> 13\. Bi-directional voice traffic flows between the MS and CN through the
> GANC.
## 8.12 Call Clearing
Figure 24 shows call clearing initiated by the mobile station.
Figure 24: Mobile Station initiated Call clearing
1\. The MS sends the _Disconnect_ message to the CN to release the call. This
message is contained in the GA-CSR UL DIRECT TRANSFER message between MS and
GANC. The GANC forwards the _Disconnect_ message to the CN.
2\. The CN responds with a _Release_ message to the GANC. The GANC forwards
this message to the MS using the GA-CSR DL DIRECT TRANSFER message.
3\. The MS responds with the _Release Complete_ message. This message is
contained within the GA-CSR UL DIRECT TRANSFER message between MS and GANC.
The GANC forwards the _Disconnect_ message to the CN.
4\. The CN triggers the release of connection as described in clause 8.7.2.
### 8.13 Channel Modify
The GANC may use the Channel Modify procedures to modify parameters used for
an ongoing call, this procedure may be used if coding scheme should be
changed, in fault or congestion situations if the GANC for example detects
\"packet loss\" and Handover to another GERAN/UTRAN mode is not possible or
desired.
The GANC may modify the following parameters:
\- Channel mode.
\- Sample Size.
\- IP address.
\- RTP UDP port.
\- RTCP UDP port.
Figure 25: Channel Mode Modify
1\. A call is established as described in clauses 8.10 or 8.11.
2\. The GANC sends the GA-CSR CHANNEL MODE MODIFY message to the MS to modify
parameters for the established call.
3\. The MS responds with the GA-CSR CHANNEL MODE MODIFY ACKNOWLEDGE message to
the GANC.
## 8.14 CS Handover between GAN A/Gb mode and GERAN/UTRAN mode
### 8.14.1 CS Handover to GAN A/Gb mode
#### 8.14.1.1 GERAN to GAN CS Handover
Figure 26: GERAN to GAN CS Handover
The description of the GERAN to GAN CS handover procedure assumes the
following:
\- the MS is on an active call on the GERAN; and
\- its mode selection is GAN-preferred, or if GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred
the RxLev from the current serving cell drops below a MS implementation
specific threshold; and
\- the MS has successfully registered with a GANC, allowing the MS to obtain
GAN system information; and
\- the GERAN provides information on neighbouring cells such that one of the
{ARFCN, BSIC} in the neighbour list matches the {ARFCN, BSIC} associated with
the GANC, as provided in the AS-related component of the system information
obtained from GANC.
> 1\. The MS begins to include GAN cell information in the _Measurement Report
> message_ to the GERAN. The MS reports the highest signal level for the GAN
> cell {ARFCN, BSIC}. This is not the actual measured signal level on GAN,
> rather an artificial value (i.e. RxLev = 63), allowing the MS to indicate
> preference for the GAN.
>
> 2\. Based on MS measurement reports and other internal algorithms, GERAN
> decides to handover to the GAN cell, using an internal mapping of {ARFCN,
> BSIC} to CGI. The GERAN starts the handover preparation by sending a
> _Handover Required_ message to the CN, identifying the target (GAN) cell.
>
> 3\. The CN requests the target GANC to allocate resources for the handover,
> using _Handover Request message_.
>
> 4\. The target GANC acknowledges the _Handover Request_ message, using
> _Handover Request Acknowledge_ message, indicating it can support the
> requested handover, and provides a _Handover Command message_ that indicates
> the radio channel to which the mobile station should be directed.
>
> 5\. The CN forwards the _Handover Command_ message to the GERAN, completing
> the handover preparation.
>
> 6\. GERAN sends _Handover Command_ message to the MS to initiate handover to
> GAN. The _Handover Command message_ includes among other parameters
> information about the target GAN such as BCCH ARFCN, PLMN colour code and
> BSIC. The MS does not switch its audio path from GERAN to GAN until handover
> completion, i.e. until it sends the GA-CSR HANDOVER COMPLETE message, to
> keep the audio interruption short.
>
> 7\. The MS accesses the GANC using the GA-CSR HANDOVER ACCESS message, and
> provides the entire _Handover Command message_ received from GERAN.
> Information in the Handover Command message (e.g. Handover Reference) allows
> the GANC to correlate the handover to the _Handover Request Acknowledge_
> message earlier sent to the CN and identify the successful completion of the
> handover.
>
> 8\. The GANC sets up the bearer path with the MS, using the same steps as in
> steps 9 to 14 of Mobile Originated Call Flow as defined in sub-clause 8.10.
>
> 9\. The MS transmits the GA-CSR HANDOVER COMPLETE message to indicate the
> completion of the handover procedure at its end. It switches the user from
> the GERAN user plane to the GAN user plane.
>
> 10\. The GANC indicates to the CN that it has detected the MS, using
> _Handover Detect_ message. The CN can optionally now switch the user plane
> from the source GERAN to the target GAN.
>
> 11\. Bi-directional voice traffic is now flowing between the MS and CN, via
> GANC.
>
> 12\. The target GANC indicates the handover is complete, using the _Handover

>
> 13\. Finally, the CN tears down the connection to the source GERAN, using

#### 8.14.1.2 UTRAN to GAN CS Handover
Figure 26b: UTRAN to GAN CS Handover
The description of the UTRAN to GAN CS Handover procedure assumes the
following:
\- the MS is on an active call on the UTRAN; and
\- the MS has included the _Support of Handover to GAN_ indication in the UE
RAC; and
\- the UE has been ordered by the RNC to make inter-RAT measurements, and
\- if the MS is in GAN preferred mode with an Event 3A configured, the MS
handles parameters associated with the Event 3A in a GAN specific manner (as
described in 3GPP TS 44.318) for the reporting of the GAN cell {ARFCN, BSIC};
and
\- when the UE is in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred mode and an event 3A has
been configured for the GAN cell (and possibly for GERAN cells), the UE shall
only send a measurement about the GAN cell, when this event is triggered and
no GERAN cells from the neighbour cell list of the UE satisfy the triggering
condition of this Event (as described in 3GPP TS 25.331);
\- the UTRAN provides information on neighbouring cells such that one of the
{ARFCN, BSIC} in the neighbour list matches the {ARFCN, BSIC} associated with
the GANC, as provided in the AS-related component of the system information
obtained from GANC. The selection of the RF channel numbers (ARFCNs) used for
the UTRAN to GAN handover procedure should not correspond to a channel from a
frequency band supported by any UE, to avoid UEs that do not require
compressed mode from unnecessarily powering up their GSM receivers.
> 1\. The MS begins to include information about a GAN cell in the
> _Measurement Report message sent_ to the RNC. The MS reports the highest
> signal level for the GAN cell {ARFCN, BSIC}. This is not the actual measured

>
> 3\. The CN requests the target GANC to allocate resources for the handover,

>
> 4\. The target GANC acknowledges the handover request message, using

>
> 5\. The CN sends the _Relocation Command_ message to the RNC, completing the
> relocation preparation.
>
> 6\. The RNC sends **_HANDOVER FROM UTRAN COMMAND_ _message_ to the MS to

### 8.14.2 CS Handover from GAN A/Gb mode to GERAN
Figure 27: CS Handover from GAN A/Gb mode to GERAN
The procedure description in this sub-clause assumes the following:
\- the MS is on an active call on the GAN A/Gb mode; and
\- the GERAN becomes available; and
\- the MS mode selection is GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred; or
\- the MS mode selection is GAN-preferred and the MS begins to leave GAN
coverage, based on its local measurements, received RTCP reports, as well as
any uplink quality indications received from the GANC.
The handover from GAN to GERAN procedure is always triggered by the MS.
> 1\. The GANC may send a GA-CSR UPLINK QUALITY INDICATION if there is a

The procedure description in this sub-clause assumes the following:
\- the MS is on an active call on the GAN A/Gb mode; and
\- the MS is capable of operating in all of the GAN A/Gb, GERAN and UTRAN
modes; and
\- the UTRAN becomes available; and
\- the MS is in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred mode; or
\- the MS mode selection is GAN preferred and begins to leave GAN coverage,
based on its local measurements, received RTCP reports, as well as any uplink

While in GERAN/UTRAN, a mobile station may be ordered to perform a cell
reselection to GAN A/Gb mode, by using the Cell Change Order procedures used
in GERAN/UTRAN, with no modifications. The mobile station regards the
procedure as completed when it has successfully performed Rove In to GAN.
While the mobile station is involved in a PS session in the GAN A/Gb mode,
there is no identified need for a Cell Change Order procedure.
## 8.16 GA-PSR Transport Channel Management Procedures
The GA-PSR Transport Channel (GA-PSR TC) management procedures are the basic
GA-PSR procedures specified to facilitate the control of the GA-PSR connection
for the user data transfer. A UDP based GA-PSR connection between the MS and
the GANC for GPRS data transfer is referred to as the GA-PSR Transport
Channel.
The GA-PSR Transport Channel consists of the following:
\- The IP address and destination UDP port number to be used for GPRS data
transfer at both the GANC and MS.
\- The GA-PSR Channel Timer.
The MS or GANC will activate a GA-PSR Transport Channel only when needed; i.e.
when the GPRS user data transfer is initiated.
The GA-PSR can be in two different states, GA-PSR-STANDBY or GA-PSR-ACTIVE
state. The state of the GA-PSR and the corresponding transport channel are
always synchronized.
\- In GA-PSR-STANDBY state:
\- The MS is not able to send or receive GPRS data to and from the GANC. The
GANC or the MS needs to activate the GA-PSR Transport Channel before sending
any GPRS data.
\- A corresponding GA-PSR Transport Channel does not exist. When the GA-PSR
Transport Channel is activated, the MS enters the GA-PSR-ACTIVE state.
\- In GA-PSR-ACTIVE state:
\- The MS is able to send and receive GPRS data to and from the GANC.
Furthermore there exists a corresponding GA-PSR Transport Channel for this MS.
A GA-PSR Channel Timer is also defined to control the transition from GA-PSR-
ACTIVE to GA-PSR-STANDBY state as follows:
\- The MS GA-PSR layer implements a timer that is started when the MS enters
GA-PSR-ACTIVE state and restarted each time a LLC-PDU is transmitted to or
received from the network. When the timer expires, the MS deactivates the GA-
PSR Transport Channel and the MS GA-PSR enters GA-PSR-STANDBY state.
The GA-PSR Channel Timer value is returned to the MS as part of the GAN
Registration procedure (i.e. in GA-RC REGISTER ACCEPT message).
### 8.16.1 MS initiated Activation of GA-PSR Transport Channel
Figure 29 depicts the MS initiated GA-PSR Transport Channel activation
procedure. The basic idea is that the GANC and MS can dynamically negotiate
the IP address and UDP port numbers for data transfer. This procedure can
facilitate the GANC load balancing; moreover, it allows the GANC to optimize
the processing and maintain the context for active users only.
Figure 29: Activation of GA-PSR Transport Channel
Initially, the MS GA-PSR is in the GA-PSR-STANDBY state as the LLC layer
requests the transfer of one or more uplink LLC-PDUs. As the MS GA-PSR is in
GA-PSR-STANDBY state, the corresponding GA-PSR Transport Channel does not
exist. This is a trigger for the MS to activate the GA-PSR Transport Channel
(TC).
1\. The GA-PSR-layer sends a GA-PSR ACTIVATE UTC REQ message to the GANC to
request the activation of the GA-PSR Transport Channel. This message contains
MS UDP port number that the GANC can use for the downlink transfer.
2\. The GANC replies with a GA-PSR ACTIVATE UTC ACK message that contains the
IP-address and the UDP port number to be used for the uplink user data
transfer. Upon receiving the acknowledgment, the MS GA-PSR transitions to GA-
PSR-ACTIVE state.
3\. After successful GA-PSR TC activation, the MS forwards the LLC-PDU to the
GANC IP-address and UDP-port received in the acknowledgment message using GA-
PSR UNITDATA message. The GANC forwards the LLC‑PDU and other parameters to
the core network as per procedure described in clause 8.17.2.3 (not shown in
the sequence). The MS restarts the GA-PSR Channel Timer.
4\. The GANC receives a downlink user data message for the MS as per procedure
described in clause 8.17.2.2 (not shown in the sequence) while the GA-PSR TC
is still active. The LLC-PDU and the required parameters are sent to the MS
encapsulated in a GA-PSR UNITDATA message using the associated GA-PSR
Transport Channel information (MS IP-address and UDP-port received in step 1).
### 8.16.2 MS initiated Deactivation of the GA-PSR Transport Channel
The following message sequence depicts the scenario when the MS deactivates
the GA-PSR Transport Channel after the GA-PSR Channel Timer expires. In
addition, when a PS handover from _GAN A/Gb mode_ to _GERAN/UTRAN mode_ is
successfully completed both the GANC and the MS shall consider the GA-PSR
Transport Channel as implicitly deactivated and the MS shall stop the GA-PSR
Channel Timer.
Figure 30: Deactivation of GA-PSR Transport Channel
1\. GA-PSR-layer in the MS sends the GA-PSR DEACTIVATE UTC REQ message to the
GANC to request the deactivation of the GA-PSR Transport Channel. The message
includes cause parameter to indicate \"normal deactivation\".
2\. The GANC deletes the related MS information associated with the GA-PSR
Transport Channel and replies to the MS with a GA-PSR DEACTIVATE UTC ACK
message. Upon receiving the acknowledgment message, the MS enters GA-PSR-
STANDBY state.
### 8.16.3 Implicit Deactivation of the GA-PSR Transport Channel due to MS
Deregistration
When a GA-RC DEREGISTER message is received by the GANC or if the MS is
implicitly deregistered, the GA-PSR Transport Channel associated with the MS,
if any, is automatically released by the GANC.
### 8.16.4 Network initiated GA-PSR Transport Channel Activation
Figure 31 depicts a scenario when the GANC activates a GA-PSR Transport
Channel for a GAN registered MS. This scenario covers the following cases:
\- The GANC receives a downlink user data packet (LLC PDU) from the core
network and the specified MS does not have an active GA-PSR Transport Channel.
\- PS Handover to GAN A/Gb mode is initiated in support of one or more PS
domain services.
Figure 31: Network initiated GA-PSR Transport Channel Activation
1\. The GANC sends a GA-PSR ACTIVATE UTC REQ message to the MS to request the
activation of the corresponding GA-PSR TC. The message contains the GANC IP
address and UDP port number assigned to the GA-PSR TC and the MS GA-PSR
transitions to GA-PSR-ACTIVE state.
2\. The MS replies with a GA-PSR ACTIVATE UTC ACK message that contains the
selected UDP-port number. Subsequently, the MS enters GA-PSR-ACTIVE state and
starts the GA-PSR Channel Timer.
3\. The GANC forwards the previously received downlink LLC-PDU to the MS using
GA-PSR UNITDATA message as per procedure described in clause 8.17.1. For the
case of PS handover to a GAN cell the reception of downlink LLC PDUs is
enabled in the MS upon allocation of the GA-PSR Transport Channel in step 1.
4\. The GA-PSR Transport Channel is active and the MS can send the uplink data
using GA-PSR UNITDATA procedure described in clause 8.17.1. For the case of PS
handover to a GAN cell the MS enables the transmission of uplink LLC PDUs on
the allocated GA-PSR Transport Channel upon successful completion of the PS
handover procedure.
## 8.17 GPRS Data, Signalling and SMS Transport
### 8.17.1 GA-PSR GPRS Data Transport Procedures
Figure 32 illustrates the transport of GPRS user data messages via GAN.
Figure 32: User Plane Data Transport
1\. Optionally, if the GA-PSR is in GA-PSR-STANDBY state, the GA-PSR Transport
Channel is activated as per description in clauses 8.16.1 or 8.16.4. Upon
successful activation, the MS starts the GA-PSR Channel Timer.
2\. The MS encapsulates the uplink LLC-PDU within the GA-PSR UNITDATA message
that is forwarded to the GANC. The message includes parameters required for Gb
interface procedures and TLLI as MS identifier. The MS restarts the GA-PSR
Channel Timer.
3\. The GANC forwards the LLC-PDU to the Core Network as per standard Gb
interface procedures.
4\. The Core Network sends the downlink LLC-PDU that contains GPRS user data
via the Gb interface. The MS is identified with the TLLI.
5\. Assuming that the corresponding GPRS TC is available, the GANC forwards
the LLC-PDU to the MS encapsulated in the GA-PSR UNITDATA message. Upon
receiving this message, the MS restarts the GA-PSR Channel Timer.
6\. The GPRS data transfer (steps 2 to 5), both in uplink and downlink
direction, can be processed as many times as necessary while the GA-PSR TC is
active.
7\. When the GA-PSR Channel Timer expires, the corresponding GA-PSR TC is
deactivated as per description in clause 8.16.2.
### 8.17.2 GA-PSR GPRS Signalling and SMS Transport Procedures
#### 8.17.2.1 General
The TCP connection that is used for GA-CSR signalling is also used for GA-PSR
GPRS signalling and SMS transport identified by LLC SAPI 1 and SAPI 7
respectively. This TCP connection is available after GAN registration, so
establishment of a separate channel, i.e. a TCP connection, for GPRS
signalling and SMS transport is not required.
#### 8.17.2.2 Network initiated GPRS Signalling
For Network initiated signalling/SMS, the Core Network sends a GMM/SM
signalling or SMS message to the GANC via the Gb interface as per standard
GPRS; e.g. the LLC PDU may include GMM attach accept or SM PDP context
activation accept message. The GANC encapsulates the received LLC PDU within a
GA-PSR DATA message that is forwarded to the MS via the existing TCP
connection.
Figure 33: Downlink Control Plane Data Transport
1\. The Core Network sends a GMM/SM signalling message or an SMS message as
per GPRS via the Gb interface; e.g. the LLC-PDU may include GMM attach accept
or SM PDP context activation accept message.
2\. The GANC encapsulates the received LLC-PDU within a GA-PSR DATA message
that is forwarded to the MS.
#### 8.17.2.3 MS initiated GPRS Signalling
For MS initiated signalling/SMS, the MS GA-PSR receives a request from the LLC
layer to transfer an uplink GMM/SM signalling message or SMS message; e.g.
this could be a GMM attach request or SM PDP context activation message. The
GMM/SM signalling messages are identified with LLC SAPI 1 and SMS messages
with LLC SAPI 7. The MS **GA-PSR** encapsulates the LLC PDU within a GA-PSR
DATA message including the parameters that will be required for Gb interface
procedures. Subsequently, the message is forwarded to the GANC, and the GANC
forwards the message to the Core Network as per standard Gb interface
procedures.
Figure 34: Uplink Control Plane Data Transport
1\. The MS GA-PSR receives a request from the LLC layer to transfer an uplink
GMM/SM signalling message or SMS message; e.g. this could be a GMM attach
request or SM PDP context activation message. The MS GA‑PSR encapsulates the
LLC-PDU within a GA-PSR DATA message including the parameters that will be
required for Gb interface procedures. Subsequently, the message is forwarded
to the GANC.
2\. The GANC forwards the message to the Core Network as per standard Gb
interface procedure.
## 8.18 GA-PSR Specific Signalling Procedures
### 8.18.1 Packet Paging for GPRS Data Service
The Core Network sends a PS page for a mobile station that is currently GPRS
attached via the GAN.
Figure 35: Packet Paging for GPRS
1\. The Core Network sends a _PAGING PS_ for a mobile station that is
currently GPRS attached via the GAN. This message contains always IMSI and it
may also contain P-TMSI.
2\. GANC identifies the MS registration context using the IMSI provided by the
CN and pages the MS using the GA-PSR PS PAGE message on the existing TCP
signalling connection. The GA-PSR PS PAGE message on the Up interface includes
the P-TMSI, if received in the _PAGING PS_ message from the CN, else it
includes the MS IMSI.
3\. The mobile station sends any LLC-PDU to respond to the page, activating
GA-PSR TC, if needed. The uplink LLC-PDU is forwarded to the GANC using the
GPRS data or signalling transfer mechanism as described in clause 8.17.2.3.
4\. The GANC forwards the LLC-PDU to the Core Network via the standard Gb
interface procedures.
### 8.18.2 Packet Paging for CS Domain Service
The Core Network may send a CS page for a mobile station that is currently
GPRS attached via the GAN.
Figure 36: Packet Paging for CS Service
> 1\. The Core Network sends a _PAGING CS_ for a GAN registered mobile station
> via the Gb interface. The mobile station is currently GPRS attached via the
> GAN. **The** _PAGING CS_ **message always contains IMSI as Mobile Identity
> and it may also contain TMSI.**
>
> 2\. GANC identifies the MS registration context using the IMSI provided by
> the CN and pages the MS using the GA-CSR PAGING REQUEST message on the
> existing TCP signalling connection. The GA-CSR PAGING REQUEST message on the
> Up interface includes the TMSI, if received in the PAGING CS message from
> the CN, else it includes the MS IMSI.
>
> 3-4. The mobile station initiates the standard CS page response procedure
> via the GAN as described in clause 8.11.
### 8.18.3 GPRS Suspend Procedure
The GPRS Suspend procedure is invoked if a mobile station is unable to support
simultaneous voice and data services and is transitioning to dedicated mode.
Figure 37: GPRS Suspend
1\. While transitioning to dedicated mode and if unable to support
simultaneous voice and data services, the mobile station sends a GA-CSR GPRS
SUSPENSION REQUEST message to the **GANC** to suspend downlink GPRS traffic.
The request is transferred via the existing TCP signalling connection and
includes TLLI and Suspension Cause parameters as per standard GPRS.
2\. The GANC initiates and completes the standard GPRS Suspend procedure as
defined for Gb interface.
### 8.18.4 GPRS Resume Procedure
If the GPRS service has been suspended while the mobile station entered the
dedicated mode, it needs to be resumed when the mobile station leaves the
dedicated mode.
Figure 38: GPRS Resume
Initially, the MS is in the dedicated mode and the GPRS service is suspended.
1\. The Core Network sends a _Clear Command_ message to release the resources
associated with the dedicated mode procedure.
2\. The GANC responds with a Clear Complete message.
3\. Optionally, the GANC may initiate the standard BSSGP GPRS resume
procedure.
4\. The GANC sends a GA-CSR RELEASE message to instruct the MS to release the
GA-CSR Connection. The message includes GPRS resumption indication as per
standard GSM/GPRS to indicate whether or not the network successfully resumed
GPRS service.
5\. The MS replies with a GA-CSR RELEASE COMPLETE message and resumes GPRS
service internally.
6\. Optionally, if the Core Network indicated unsuccessful resumption, the MS
initiates GPRS service resumption as per standard GPRS.
### 8.18.5 MS Initiated Downlink Flow Control
The principle of the MS Initiated Downlink Flow Control is that the MS sends
to the GANC flow control parameters, which allow the GANC to perform standard
Gb interface procedures towards CN for downlink Flow Control either on MS or
PFC level.
The following figure illustrates the message flow involved in the normal case
when the MS sends a GAN flow control request to the GANC as an indication that
the MS is not able to handle current data rate. The GANC will utilize the
standard MS based Gb interface flow control mechanism to adjust the data rate.
Figure 39: Downlink Flow Control
1\. The MS detects a flow control condition related to the downlink data
traffic.
2\. The MS constructs a flow control request message (**GA-PSR** FC REQ) that
is sent to the GANC via the GA-PSR TC and starts a GA-PSR downlink flow
control timer to continue monitoring the flow control condition. The message
includes the flow control adjustment IE to specify the required data rate
correction.
3\. Upon receiving the indication, the GANC calculates adjusted flow control
parameters for the MS and sends the corresponding request to the Core Network
to reduce the downlink data rate for the MS. The Core Network adjusts the
downlink data rate for the MS as per request.
4\. Upon the expiry of the GA-PSR downlink flow control timer, the MS
evaluates the flow control condition and if it has not been resolved,
calculates the adjustment again and forwards another request to the GANC.
5\. The GANC processes the request and sends another request to the Core
Network to adjust the downlink data rate for the MS.
6\. The GA-PSR downlink flow control timer expires again.
7\. Steps 4 to 6 are repeated until the flow control condition is resolved.
### 8.18.6 Uplink Flow Control
The principle of the Uplink Flow Control is that the GANC sends to the MS flow
control parameters, which guide the MS on sending of GPRS data towards the
GANC.
The following figure illustrates the message flow involved in the normal case
when the GANC initiates GAN flow control procedure when it is not able to
handle current uplink data rate.
Figure 40: Uplink Flow Control
1\. The GANC detects a flow control condition related to the uplink data
traffic associated with a specific MS.
2\. The GANC constructs a flow control request message (GA-PSR-FC-REQ) that is
sent to the MS via the GA‑PSR TC and starts a timer to continue monitoring the
flow control condition. The message includes the flow control adjustment IE to
specify the required data rate correction. Upon receiving the message, the MS
adjusts the uplink data rate accordingly.
3\. After the timer expires, the GANC evaluates the flow control condition and
if it has not been resolved, calculates the adjustment again and forwards
another request to the MS.
4\. The GANC timer expires again. The GANC evaluates the flow control
condition and determines that the condition has been resolved. Based on the
GANC algorithm that is implemented, it may gradually increase the uplink data
rate using the same GA-PSR-FC-REQ message.
5\. The flow control condition does not exist any more and the procedure is
complete.
## 8.19 Short Message Service
GAN provides support for both Circuit Switched (GSM based) and Packet Switched
(GPRS based) SMS services. GAN-attached and GPRS enabled mobile stations will
be able to send and receive GSM and GPRS SMS messages via the GAN, regardless
of the GPRS class (B or C) with the restriction that the class C mobiles can
support only GPRS based SMS.
### 8.19.1 GSM based SMS
GSM SMS support in GAN is based on the same mechanism that is utilized for GSM
mobility management and call control. On the MS side, the SMS layers
(including the supporting CM sub layer functions) utilize the services of the
MM layer to transfer SMS messages per standard circuit switched GSM
implementation. The SM-CP protocol is effectively tunnelled between the MS and
the CN, using GA-CSR messages from the MS to the GANC, where the GANC relays
the SM-CP to BSSAP DTAP messages for transport over the A interface.
As with GSM mobility management and call control procedures, the secure IPsec
tunnel and TCP session are used to provide secure and reliable SMS delivery
over the IP network.
### 8.19.2 GPRS based SMS
GPRS SMS message transfer is based on the same mechanism as the transfer of
the GPRS MM/SM signalling messages. On the MS side, the SMS layers (including
the supporting CM sub layer functions) utilize the services of the LLC layer
to transfer SMS messages per standard packet switched GPRS implementation.
As with GPRS signalling, the secure IPsec tunnel and TCP session is used to
provide secure and reliable GPRS SMS delivery over the IP network.
## 8.20 Supplementary Services
GSM has a large number of standardized supplementary services. These
supplementary services involve procedures that operate end-to-end between the
MS and the MSC. The DTAP messages used for the supplementary service are
relayed between the MS and MSC in the same manner as in the other call control
and mobility management scenarios described in this document.
## 8.21 Emergency Services
### 8.21.1 General
The GANC can indicate, in the GAN Registration procedures, an Access Network
preference for the placement of emergency calls.
Based on the Access Network preference, and if any GERAN/UTRAN coverage is
available (either from the GAN subscriber\'s home PLMN or from any roamer
PLMN, irrespective of roamer agreements), the MS should switch from GAN mode
to GERAN/UTRAN mode and place the emergency call over GERAN/UTRAN, to leverage
the location determination infrastructure in GERAN/UTRAN. During the emergency
call, the MS should not attempt to handover the call to GAN. After the
emergency call is completed, the MS may perform normal rove-in procedures to
re-enter GAN mode, if GAN coverage is still available. Alternatively there may
be a penalty timer configured to ensure that the MS remains in GERAN/UTRAN for
call-back purposes. On expiry of the penalty timer the MS may perform normal
rove-in procedures to re-enter GAN mode, if GAN coverage is still available.
Based on the Access Network preference, or if no GERAN/UTRAN coverage is
available (neither from the GAN subscriber\'s home PLMN nor from any roamer
PLMN, irrespective of roamer agreements), the MS places the emergency call
over GAN. In GAN, the emergency call is handled just like a GSM emergency call
origination. The cell ID associated with the GANC provides an indication of
the location of the MS. Additionally, more accurate location information may
be obtained by the GANC either directly from the MS (e.g. using AGPS) or from
the generic IP access network point of attachment (e.g. using a database of IP
or MAC addresses). If available, the GANC can pass this location information
through BSSMAP or RANAP signalling to the core network, when requested.
However, location services based on mechanisms using the GERAN/UTRAN physical
layer cannot be applied.
NOTE: A mechanism may be required in the GANC to force the MS to GERAN/UTRAN
mode, if the location accuracy is not deemed sufficient for emergency calls in
GAN mode.
### 8.21.2 North American Emergency Calls
#### 8.21.2.1 Phase 1 Solution
##### 8.21.2.1.1 Phase 1 Requirements
Wireless service providers were required by the FCC to have the capability to
send wireless 911 calls to an E911 public safety answering point (PSAP)
containing two important sets of data:
1\. The location of the cell tower through which the E911 call was processed.
2\. The mobile directory number (MDN) or \"call back number\" of the wireless
phone placing the 911 call.
##### 8.21.2.1.2 Phase 1 Mechanism
The GANC shall indicate during registration, when entering GAN mode, whether
GERAN/UTRAN or GAN is preferred for support of emergency calls.
\- If GAN mode is the preferred emergency call mode, the emergency call shall
be placed over GAN if the mobile is in GAN mode. The GANC can reject the call
depending on operator policy.
\- If GERAN/UTRAN mode is the preferred emergency mode, the emergency call
shall be placed over the GERAN/UTRAN when a GERAN/UTRAN network is available.
If a GERAN/UTRAN network is not available the emergency call shall be placed
over GAN.
#### 8.21.2.2 Phase 2 Solution
##### 8.21.2.2.1 Phase 2 Requirements
Wireless service providers are required by the FCC to have the ability to
provide the actual caller\'s location to the E911 PSAP. The location accuracy
requirements differ depending on whether a network-based or handset-based
approach is chosen.
\- Network-based requirement: Within 100 meters, 67% of the time and within
300 meters, 95% of the time.
\- Handset-based requirement: Within 50 meters, 67% of the time and within 150
meters, 95% of the time.
The handset-based requirements apply to terminals supporting location
determining mechanisms (e.g. A-GPS, E-OTD). This may require new, modified or
upgraded terminals.
##### 8.21.2.2.2 Phase 2 Mechanism
The emergency call is placed over GERAN/UTRAN or GAN. If the emergency call is
placed over GAN, the GANC will need to provide accurate location information
for the MS or the AP through which the MS is placing the emergency call. This
can be done in a number of ways:
\- the GANC can reference an AP-ID to location mapping database for the GAN
service;
\- the MS can provide its current location (e.g. obtained via AGPS) in GA-RC
REGISTER REQUEST/UPDATE message;
\- the GANC can reference an MS (public) IP address to location mapping
database;
\- the GANC can deliver the required location information to the SMLC via Lb
interface and the SMLC is responsible for final location determination.
The GANC passes this location information through BSSMAP or RANAP signalling
to the CN, when requested.
## 8.22 Location Services
The GANC uses information received from the MS during the GAN Registration and
GAN Registration Update procedures to determine the geographic location of an
MS.
**1\. Cell-Info:** The MS provides the identity of the GSM, UTRAN or E-UTRAN
cell it is camped on, in case GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN coverage is available, at
the time of GAN registration. The GANC determines the MS location to the
resolution of a single cell. This enables location services that require
location resolution provided by a cell (e.g. E911 Phase 1).
NOTE 1: The accuracy of the location may be reduced if no up-to-date cellular
coverage information is available.
**2\. Generic IP access network point of attachment information (AP-ID):** The
MS provides the AP-ID at the time of GAN registration. The GANC may maintain
an internal database of mapping between AP-ID and AP location. The AP Location
may be defined as street address, postcode or zip code and would require a
translation function to a GAD shape as defined in 3GPP TS 23.032 [41]. The
GANC may then determine the MS location to the resolution of a single
attachment point\'s coverage area. This can enable location services that
require a location with greater resolution than that provided by a GSM cell
(e.g. E911 Phase 2).
NOTE 2: The location of the point of attachment may not be reliable, and is
dependent on up-to-date information being provided either by the MS or by the
owner of the point of attachment.
## 8.23 PS Handovers between GAN A/Gb mode and GERAN/UTRAN mode
Procedures for PS handover between GERAN/UTRAN mode and GAN A/Gb mode when an
MS and BSS/RNC/GANC support this type of PS handover are described in 3GPP TS
43.129 [44].
# 9 High-Level Procedures for GAN Iu Mode
## 9.1 Mechanism of Mode Selection in Multi-mode terminals
See clause 8.1.
## 9.2 PLMN Selection
See clause 8.2.
## 9.3 Re-selection between GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN and GAN modes
See clause 8.3.
## 9.4 GAN Discovery and Registration related procedures
See clause 8.4.
## 9.5 Authentication
See clause 8.5.
## 9.6 Encryption
See clause 8.6.
## 9.7 GA-RRC Connection handling
The GAN Iu mode GA-RRC CS and PS connections are logical connections between
the MS and the GANC.
A GA-RRC connection is established when the upper layers in the MS request the
establishment of a signalling connection for either CS or PS domain and the MS
is in GA-RRC-IDLE state for that domain; i.e., no GA-RRC connection exists.
When a successful response is received from the network, GA-RRC replies to the
upper layer that the MS has entered the RRC connected mode (i.e., the GA-RRC-
CONNECTED state). The upper layers then have the possibility to request
transmission of NAS messages to the network.
Note that in the case of a network-initiated CS or PS session, the GA-RRC
connection is implicitly established when the MS responds to the GA-RRC PAGING
REQUEST message from the GANC with the GA-RRC INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER
containing the paging response. This is illustrated in clause 9.11 for the CS
case and clause 9.16.7.2 for the PS case.
Also, in the case of handover from GERAN or UTRAN to GAN Iu mode, the GA-RRC
connection is implicitly established when the MS sends the GA-RRC RELOCATION
ACK message to the GANC (normal case) or the GA-RRC RELOCATION ACCESS message
to the GANC (exception case), as described in sub-clause 9.14.
### 9.7.1 GA-RRC Connection Establishment
The following figure shows successful and unsuccessful establishment of the
GA-RRC connection for either the CS or PS domain.
Figure 43: GA-RRC Connection Establishment
1\. The MS initiates GA-RRC connection establishment by sending the GA-RRC
REQUEST message to the GANC. The message includes the CN Domain identity (CS
or PS) and the Establishment Cause indicating the reason for GA-RRC connection
establishment.
2\. The GANC signals the acceptance of the connection request to the MS by
sending the GA-RRC REQUEST ACCEPT and the MS enters the GA-RRC-CONNECTED
state.
3\. If the GANC determines that the GA-RRC connection request shall be
rejected, it sends a GA-RRC REQUEST REJECT to the MS indicating the reject
cause, completing the procedure.
### 9.7.2 GA-RRC Connection Release
The following figure shows release of the logical GA-RRC connection between
the MS and the GANC.
Figure 44: GA-RRC Connection Release
1\. The CN indicates to the GANC to release the resources allocated to the MS,
via the RANAP _Iu Release Command message_.
2\. The GANC commands the MS to release resources, using the GA-RRC RELEASE
message. The message includes the CN Domain Identity (CS or PS).
3\. The GANC confirms resource release to the CN using the _Iu Release
Complete message_. The GANC may optionally wait for receipt of the GA-RRC
RELEASE COMPLETE message from the MS before sending the _Iu Release Complete
message to the CN._
4\. The MS confirms resource release to the GANC using the GA-RRC RELEASE
COMPLETE message and the GA-RRC state of the CS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity
or the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity (i.e., depending on the value of the
CN Domain Identity received in step 2) in the MS changes to GA-RRC-IDLE.
### 9.7.3 GA-RRC Connection Release Request
The following figure shows release of the logical CS or PS GA-RRC connection
between the MS and the GANC when initiated by the MS or the GANC (i.e., due to
abnormal conditions).
Figure 45: GA-RRC Connection Release Request
1\. The MS may initiate CS or PS GA-RRC connection release by sending the GA-
RRC RELEASE REQUEST message to the GANC. The message includes the CN Domain
identity (CS or PS) and the Cause indicating the reason for GA-RRC connection
release.
2\. On receipt of the GA-RRC RELEASE REQUEST from the MS or due to local
conditions in the GANC, the GANC initiates Iu release for the particular CN
domain by sending the _Iu Release Request message_ to the CN Domain entity.
3\. The CN triggers the release of connection as described in clause 9.7.2.
## 9.8 Security Mode Control
The message flow for security mode control is shown in the following figure.
Figure 46: Security Mode Control
1\. The CN sends the RANAP _Security Mode Command_ message to the GANC. This
message contains the integrity key (IK) and allowed algorithms, and optionally
the cipher key (CK) and allowed algorithms.
2\. The GANC selects the integrity algorithm and (optionally) the ciphering
algorithm based on the permitted algorithms received from the CN and the MS
security capabilities indicated in the IE \"3G Security Capability\" received
from the MS in the GA-RC REGISTER REQUEST message. The GANC sends the GA-RRC
SECURITY MODE COMMAND message to the MS. This message indicates the selected
integrity protection algorithm and ciphering algorithm (i.e., that are
applicable after handover to UTRAN), and a random number. The MS stores the
information for possible future use after a handover to UTRAN.
3\. The MS computes a MAC based on the random number, the MS IMSI and the
integrity key. The MS then sends the GA-RRC SECURITY MODE COMPLETE message
including the computed MAC.
4\. The GANC verifies the MAC. If the GANC verifies the MAC to be correct it
sends the _Security Mode Complete_ message to the CN.
NOTE: The MAC proves that the identity that is authenticated to the GANC is
the same as the identity authenticated to the core network.
## 9.9 NAS Signalling Procedures
After GA-RRC connection establishment, NAS PDUs may be transferred from CN-to-
MS and from MS-to-CN.
The initial NAS PDU from the MS to a core network domain is transferred in the
GA-RRC INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message as illustrated in the following figure.
This scenario assumes that a GA-RRC connection already exists between the MS
and GANC; if not, the procedure described in clause 9.7.1 is performed before
step 1.
Figure 47: Initial MS-to-CN NAS signalling
1\. The MS receives a request from the NAS layer to establish a signalling
connection to a core network domain. The request also includes a request to
transfer an uplink NAS PDU. The MS encapsulates the NAS PDU within a GA-RRC
INITIAL DIRECT TRANSFER message and sends the message to the GANC. The message
includes the CN Domain identity (CS or PS). It also includes the Intra Domain
NAS Node Selector (IDNNS) to be used by the GANC to route the establishment of
a signalling connection to a CN node within the indicated CN domain (i.e.,
using IuFlex).
2\. The GANC establishes a signalling connection to the indicated core network
domain entity and relays the received NAS-PDU to the CN via the RANAP _Initial
UE Message_ message.
Subsequent NAS PDUs from the MS to the core network domain entity are
transferred in the GA-RRC UPLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message as illustrated in the
following figure.
Figure 48: MS-to-CN NAS signalling
1\. The MS receives a request from the NAS layer to transfer an uplink NAS
PDU. Assuming the required signalling connection already exists, the MS
encapsulates the NAS PDU within a GA-RRC UL DIRECT TRANSFER message and sends
the message to the GANC. The message includes the CN Domain identity (CS or
PS).
2\. The GANC relays the received NAS-PDU to the CN via the RANAP _Direct
Transfer_ message.
NAS PDUs from the core network to the MS are transferred in the GA-RRC
DOWNLINK DIRECT TRANSFER message as illustrated in the following figure.
Figure 49: CN-to-MS NAS signalling
1\. For CN-to-MS NAS signalling, the CN sends a NAS PDU to the GANC via the
RANAP _Direct Transfer_ message.
2\. The GANC encapsulates the NAS PDU within a GA-RRC DL DIRECT TRANSFER
message and forwards the message to the MS via the existing TCP connection.
The message includes the CN Domain identity (CS or PS).
## 9.10 Mobile Originated CS Call
The description of the procedure in this sub-clause assumes the MS is in GAN
Iu mode; i.e., it has successfully registered with the GANC and GA-RRC is the
serving RR entity for CS services in the MS. It also assumes that no GA-RRC
signalling connection for the CS domain exists between the MS and GANC; i.e.,
the CS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS is in the GA-RRC-IDLE state. If
the CS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS is already in the GA-RRC-
CONNECTED state, step 1 is skipped.

>
> 15\. The MSC signals that the called party has answered, via the _Connect_

## 9.11 Mobile Terminated CS Call
The description of the procedure in this clause assumes the MS is in GAN Iu
mode; i.e., it has successfully registered with the GANC and GA-RRC is the
serving RR entity for CS services in the MS.
Figure 51: Mobile Terminated CS Call
> 1\. A mobile-terminated call arrives at the MSC. The MSC sends a RANAP
> _Paging message_ to the GANC identified through the last _Location Update_

>
> 2\. The GANC identifies the MS registration context using the IMSI provided

## 9.12 CS Call Clearing
### 9.12.1 CS Call Release
The following figure shows CS call clearing initiated by the MS. This scenario
assumes that the MSC uses Iu Release to release the call (i.e., versus a
separate RAB Release then Iu Release).
Figure 52: MS initiated CS Call release
1\. The MS sends the _Disconnect_ message to the CN to release the call. This
message is contained in the GA-RRC UL DIRECT TRANSFER message between MS and
GANC. The GANC forwards the _Disconnect_ message to the CN (i.e., using the
RANAP _Direct Transfer_ message).
2\. The CN responds with a _Release_ message to the GANC. The GANC forwards
this message to the MS using the GA-RRC DL DIRECT TRANSFER message.
3\. The MS responds with the _Release Complete_ message. This message is
contained within the GA-RRC UL DIRECT TRANSFER message between MS and GANC.
The GANC forwards the _Disconnect_ message to the CN.
4\. The CN triggers the release of connection as described in clause 9.7.2.
### 9.12.2 CS Channel Release
The following figure shows CS channel release (i.e., user plane only)
corresponding to the Iu RAB Release procedure.
Figure 53: CS channel release
1\. The CN indicates to the GANC to release the RAB allocated to the MS
(identified by the RAB ID), via the RANAP _RAB Assignment Request message_.
2\. The GANC commands the MS to release the CS user plane channel (but
maintain the CS signalling connection), using the GA-RRC DEACTIVATE CHANNEL
message. The message includes the CN Domain ID (indicating CS) and the RAB ID.
3\. The MS confirms CS channel release to the GANC using the GA-RRC DEACTIVATE
CHANNEL COMPLETE message. The MS remains in the GA-RRC-CONNECTED state.
4\. The GANC confirms resource release to CN using the _RAB Assignment
Response message_.
## 9.13 CS Channel Modification
The GANC may initiate the CS channel modification procedure when it determines
that one or more active CS channels require modification; e.g., based on
information received from the MSC in the RAB Assignment Request message or
based on local GANC logic. For example, the GANC may initiate this procedure
if it detects \"packet loss\" and handover to GERAN/UTRAN is not possible or
desired. CS channel modification and PTC modification use the same messages
and the same basic message flows, but differ in the content of the messages.
The GANC may modify the following parameters:
\- RAB Configuration
\- Sample Size
\- RTP UDP Port
\- GANC IP Address
\- Multi-rate Configuration 2
\- RTP Redundancy Configuration
\- NAS Synchronisation Indicator
\- RTCP UDP Port
Figure 54: CS Channel Modification
1\. A call is established as described in clauses 9.10 or 9.11.
2\. The GANC sends the GA-RRC MODIFY CHANNEL message to the MS to modify
parameters for the established call.
3\. The MS responds with the GA-RRC MODIFY CHANNEL ACKNOWLEDGE message to the
GANC.
## 9.14 CS Handover between GAN Iu mode and GERAN/UTRAN mode
### 9.14.1 CS Handover from GERAN to GAN
The description of the GERAN to GAN Handover procedure assumes the following:
\- the MS is on an active call on the GERAN; and
\- its mode selection is GAN-preferred, or if GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred,
the RxLev from the current serving cell drops below a defined threshold; and
\- the MS has successfully registered with a GANC, allowing the MS to obtain
GAN system information; and
\- the GANC has directed the MS to operate in GAN Iu mode; and
\- the GERAN provides information on neighbouring 3G cells such that one of
the cells in the 3G neighbour list matches the 3G cell information associated
with the GANC, as provided in the AS-related component of the system
information obtained from the GANC.
#### 9.14.1.1 Normal case: IMSI is present in Relocation Request message
Figure 55: CS Handover from GERAN to GAN (IMSI in Relocation Request)
> 1\. The MS has successfully registered with the GANC and begins to include

### 9.14.2 CS Handover from UTRAN to GAN
The description of the UTRAN to GAN CS handover procedure assumes the
following:
\- the MS is on an active call on the UTRAN; and
\- the MS has successfully registered with a GANC, allowing the MS to obtain
GAN system information; and
\- the GANC has directed the MS to operate in GAN Iu mode; and

### 9.14.3 CS Handover from GAN Iu mode to GERAN
The procedure description in this sub-clause assumes the following:
\- the MS is on an active call in GAN Iu mode; and
\- the GERAN becomes available; and
\- the MS mode selection is GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred; or
\- the MS mode selection is GAN-preferred and the MS begins to leave GAN
coverage, based on its local measurements, received RTCP reports, as well as
any uplink quality indications received from the GANC.
Figure 57: CS Handover from GAN Iu mode to GERAN
> 1\. The GANC may send a GA-RRC UPLINK QUALITY INDICATION if there is a
> problem with the uplink quality for the ongoing call. Uplink Quality
> Indication is information sent by the GANC to the MS indicating the crossing
> of a uplink quality threshold in the uplink direction. Whenever the MS
> receives an indication of bad quality, it should start the handover
> procedure, as described in the next step. Alternatively, MS can use its
> local measurements or received RTCP reports, to decide to initiate the
> handover procedure.
>
> 2\. The MS sends the GA-RRC RELOCATION INFORMATION message to the GANC
> including a list of target GERAN cells, identified by CGI, in order of
> preference (e.g. ranked by C1 path loss parameter) for handover, and the
> received signal strength for each identified GERAN cell. This list is the
> most recent information available from the GSM RR subsystem. In addition,
> the GA-RRC RELOCATION INFORMATION message may include a list of target UTRAN
> cells ranked in order of preference for handover, and the received signal
> strength for each identified UTRAN cell.
>
> 3\. If the Serving GANC selects a target GERAN cell, the handover to GERAN
> procedure is performed. The Serving GANC starts the handover preparation by
> signalling to the MSC the need for handover, using _Relocation Required,_
> and including the selected GERAN cell from the list provided by the MS.
>
> 4\. The MSC requests the target GERAN to allocate the necessary resources,
> using _Handover Request_.
>
> 5\. The target GERAN builds a GERAN RRC _Handover Command_ message providing
> information on the channel allocated and sends it to the MSC through the
> _Handover Request Acknowledge_ message.
>
> 6\. The MSC signals the GANC to handover the MS to the GERAN, using the
> _Relocation Command_ message which includes the encapsulated GERAN RRC
> _Handover Command_ message, ending the handover preparation phase.
>
> 7\. GANC transmits the GA-RRC RELOCATION COMMAND to the MS including the

### 9.14.4 CS Handover from GAN Iu mode to UTRAN
The procedure description in this sub-clause assumes the following:
\- the MS is on an active call in GAN Iu mode; and
\- the MS is capable of operating in all of the GAN, GERAN and UTRAN modes;
and
\- the UTRAN becomes available; and
\- the MS is in GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN-preferred mode; or
\- the MS mode selection is GAN preferred and begins to leave GAN coverage,
based on its local measurements, received RTCP reports, as well as any uplink
quality indications received from the GANC.
Figure 58: CS Handover from GAN Iu mode to UTRAN
> 1\. The GANC may send a GA-RRC UPLINK QUALITY INDICATION if there is a
> problem with the uplink quality for the ongoing call. Uplink Quality
> Indication is information sent by the GANC to the MS indicating the crossing
> of a uplink quality threshold in the uplink direction. Whenever the MS
> receives an indication of bad quality, it should start the handover
> procedure, as described in the next step. Alternatively, MS can use its
> local measurements or received RTCP reports, to decide to initiate the
> handover procedure.
>
> 2\. The MS sends the GA-RRC RELOCATION INFORMATION message to the Serving
> GANC including a list of candidate target UTRAN and GERAN cells, in order of
> preference for handover, and the received signal strength for each
> identified cell. The UTRAN cells are identified by the PLMN ID, the LAC and
> the 3G Cell identity (defined in 3GPP TS 25.331 [40]).
NOTE: The choice of the candidate target UTRAN cells is out of the scope of
this technical specification.
> 3\. If the Serving GANC selects UTRAN as the target RAT, the CS handover to
> UTRAN procedure is performed. The Serving GANC starts the handover
> preparation by signalling to the MSC the need for handover, using
> _Relocation Required and including the target RNC-ID that the GANC derives
> from the target UTRAN cell it selects from the list of target UTRAN cells
> provided by the_ MS. _The GANC may include only a_ single target RNC-ID in

>
> 4\. The MSC starts the relocation procedure towards the target RNC
> identified by the Serving GANC. The MSC requests from the target RNC to
> allocate the necessary resources using _Relocation Request_.
>
> 5\. The target RNC builds a _Physical Channel Reconfiguration_ message
> providing information on the allocated UTRAN resources and sends it to the
> MSC through the _Relocation Request Acknowledge_ message.
>
> 6\. The MSC signals the Serving GANC to handover the MS to the UTRAN, using
> the _Relocation Command_ message (which includes the _Physical Channel
> Reconfiguration_ message), ending the handover preparation phase.
>
> 7\. The Serving GANC transmits the GA-RRC RELOCATION COMMAND to the MS
> including the _Physical Channel Reconfiguration_ message.
>
> 8\. Target RNS achieves uplink synchronization on the Uu interface.
>
> 9\. The target RNC confirms the detection of the handover to the MSC, using

> 11\. The MS signals to the UTRAN that the handover is completed, using
> _Physical Channel Reconfig Complete_.
>
> 12\. The UTRAN confirms to the MSC the completion of the handover, via
> _Relocation Complete_ message. If the user plane has not been switched in
> step 10, the MSC switches the user plane to the target RNS.
>
> 13\. Bi-directional voice traffic is now flowing between the MS and MSC, via

## 9.15 Cell Change Order between GAN Iu mode and GERAN mode
While in GERAN, a mobile station may be ordered to perform a cell reselection
to GAN Iu mode, by using the Cell Change Order procedures used in GERAN, with
no modifications. The mobile station regards the procedure as completed when
it has successfully performed Rove In to GAN.
While the mobile station is involved in a PS session in the GAN Iu mode, there
is no identified need for a Cell Change Order procedure.
## 9.16 GA-RRC Packet Transport Channel Management Procedures
The GA-RRC Packet Transport Channel (GA-RRC PTC) provides the association
between the MS and the network for the transport of PS domain user data over
the Up interface in GAN Iu mode.
The endpoint addresses of the PTC are identified by the IP addresses and UDP
ports assigned to the PTC in the MS and GANC during the PTC activation
procedure. The GA-RRC PTC is strictly limited to operating over the Up
interface and as such all downlink GA-RRC messages sent by the GANC shall
terminate at the MS and all uplink GA-RRC messages sent by the MS shall
terminate at the GANC.
Multiple PTC instances between a MS and the GANC may be activated at the same
time, using the same endpoint addresses. Each PTC instance is assigned unique
GA-RRC Tunnel Endpoint IDs (one on the MS and one on the GANC) during the
activation procedure.
The MS and GANC manage the activation and deactivation of the PTC instances
based on the requests for RAB assignment from the SGSN and the configurable
PTC Timer.
### 9.16.1 States of the GA-RRC Packet Transport Channel
The PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS when in the GA-RRC-CONNECTED
state can be in one of two PTC substates for each PTC: PTC-INACTIVE or PTC-
ACTIVE.
**\- PTC-INACTIVE:** This is the initial/default PTC substate of the PS domain
GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS when in the GA-RRC-CONNECTED state in GAN Iu
mode. The MS is not able to send or receive PS domain user data to or from the
network using the PTC. The PTC must be activated before domain user data can
be transferred via the PTC. When the PTC has been successfully activated
between the MS and the GANC, the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS
transitions to the PTC-ACTIVE substate for this PTC.
**\- PTC-ACTIVE:** The PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS is in the
GA-RRC-CONNECTED state for this PTC and the PTC is active between the MS and
the GANC and the MS is able to send and receive PS domain user data to and
from the GANC.
The following are the possible triggers for GA-RRC PTC activation:
\- The GANC initiates PTC activation when the GANC receives the RAB Assignment
message from the SGSN; i.e., the MS receives a GA-RRC ACTIVATE CHANNEL message
from the GANC;
\- The GANC initiates PTC activation when the GANC receives the Relocation
Request message from the SGSN; i.e., the MS receives a GA-RRC RELOCATION
REQUEST message from the GANC including PTC information.
On successful PTC activation and in parallel with transition to the PTC-ACTIVE
substate, the MS starts the PTC Timer for this PTC. When the PTC Timer
expires, the MS sends a message to the GANC to initiate PTC deactivation, as
defined in clause 9.16.4. On successful PTC deactivation, the MS transitions
to the PTC-INACTIVE substate for this PTC.
At any time while the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS is in the GA-
RRC-CONNECTED state and the PTC-ACTIVE substate, the MS may receive the GA-RRC
DEACTIVATE CHANNEL message for this PTC. The MS de-activates the PTC and
transitions to the PTC-INACTIVE substate.
At any time while the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS is in the GA-
RRC-CONNECTED state and the PTC-ACTIVE substate, the MS may receive the GA-RRC
RELEASE message indicating the PS domain. In addition to requesting release of
the PS GA-RRC connection, this is interpreted by the MS as an implicit PTC de-
activation command; i.e. all active PTCs are deactivated.
At any time while in GAN Iu mode, if the serving RR entity is switched to GSM-
RR, UTRAN RRC or E-UTRAN RRC, the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS
is disconnected from the GPRS SAPs and the MS enters GERAN/UTRAN/E-UTRAN mode.
Simultaneously, the MS shall de-activate the associated PTC(s) regardless of
the PTC Timer status for these PTC(s).
The PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS maintains one PTC for each
active PDP context. The PTC Timer is restarted whenever any uplink user data
packet is sent or downlink user data packet is received related to the PDP
context.
The PTC Timer value is provided to the MS as part of the GAN Registration
procedure (i.e., in the GA-RC REGISTER ACCEPT message).
### 9.16.2 PTC Activation
#### 9.16.2.1 PTC Activation when GANC receives RAB Assignment Request
The following figure depicts the Packet Transport Channel activation procedure
when the GANC receives the RAB Assignment Request message from the SGSN,
assuming the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in MS is in the GA-RRC-IDLE
state. If the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in MS is already in the GA-RRC-
CONNECTED state, step 1 is skipped.

The following figure depicts the scenario when the MS initiates re-activation
of the Packet Transport Channel while the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in
the MS is in the GA-RRC-CONNECTED and the MS is in the PMM-CONNECTED state;
e.g., a PS signalling connection and active PDP context exists between the MS

#### 9.16.7.1 Active PDP Context, PS Signalling Connection Exists
The following figure depicts the scenario when the network initiates re-
activation of the GA-RRC PTC while the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the

### 9.16.8 Implicit PTC De-activation due to MS De-registration
As part of the GAN de-registration procedure, the GANC needs to release all
resources allocated to the MS. GAN de-registration may be initiated either
explicitly by the MS or implicitly by the GANC if the loss of the signalling
connection is detected (as described in clause 9.4.2).

> Initially, the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS is in the PTC-
> ACTIVE substate for one or more GA-RRC PTCs associated with the MS.

>
> 5\. Upon receiving the Iu Release Command, the GANC implicitly de-activates
> (i.e., locally) all associated PTCs and...
>
> 6\. ...responds to the SGSN with an Iu Release Complete message.
### 9.16.9 PTC Modification
The GANC may initiate the packet transport channel (PTC) modification
procedure when it determines that one or more active PTCs require
modification; e.g., based on information received from the SGSN in the RAB
Assignment Request message or based on local GANC logic. For example, the GANC
may initiate this procedure if it detects \"packet loss\" and handover to
GERAN/UTRAN is not possible or desired. CS channel modification and PTC
modification use the same messages and the same basic message flows, but
differ in the content of the messages.
The GANC may modify the following PTC parameters:
\- RAB Configuration
\- GANC TEID
\- MS TEID
\- GANC UDP Port
\- GANC IP Address
Figure 66a: PTC Modification
1\. One or more PTC(s) are activated as described in sub-clause 9.16.2.
2\. The GANC sends the GA-RRC MODIFY CHANNEL message to the MS to modify
parameters for one or more\ of the activated PTCs.
3\. The MS responds with the GA-RRC MODIFY CHANNEL ACKNOWLEDGE message to the
GANC.
## 9.17 (void)
## 9.18 (void)
## 9.19 Short Message Service
GAN provides support for SMS via the CS domain and the PS domain. GAN-attached
and GPRS enabled mobile stations will be able to send and receive SMS messages
via the CS domain or the PS domain, regardless of the GPRS class (B or C) with
the restriction that the class C mobiles can support only SMS via the PS
domain.
### 9.19.1 SMS via the CS domain
Support for SMS via the CS domain in GAN is based on the same mechanism that
is utilized for GSM mobility management and call control. On the MS side, the
SMS layers (including the supporting CM sub layer functions) utilize the
services of the MM layer to transfer SMS messages per standard circuit
switched GSM implementation. The SM-CP protocol is effectively tunnelled
between the MS and the CN, using GA-RRC messages from the MS to the GANC,
where the GANC relays the SM-CP to RANAP messages for transport over the Iu-cs
interface.
As with GSM mobility management and call control procedures, the secure IPsec
tunnel and TCP session are used to provide secure and reliable SMS delivery
over the IP network.
### 9.19.2 SMS via the PS domain
Support for SMS via the PS domain is based on the same mechanism as the
transfer of the GPRS MM/SM signalling messages. The SM-CP protocol is
effectively tunnelled between the MS and the CN, using GA-RRC messages from
the MS to the GANC, where the GANC relays the SM-CP to RANAP messages for
transport over the Iu-ps interface.
As with GPRS signalling, the secure IPsec tunnel and TCP session is used to
provide secure and reliable GPRS SMS delivery over the IP network.
## 9.20 Supplementary Services
UMTS has a large number of standardized supplementary services. These
supplementary services involve procedures that operate end-to-end between the
MS and the MSC. The CM messages used for the supplementary service are relayed
between the MS and MSC in the same manner as in the other call control and
mobility management scenarios described in this document.

## 9.23 PS Handover between GAN Iu mode and GERAN/UTRAN mode
### 9.23.1 PS Handover from GERAN to GAN
#### 9.23.1.1 Preparation Phase
The description of the GERAN to GAN PS handover procedure assumes the
following:
\- the MS has one or more active packet flow contexts in the GERAN;
\- the MS has successfully registered with a GANC, allowing the MS to obtain
GAN system information;
\- the GANC has directed the MS to operate in GAN Iu mode;
\- the PS handover is intra-SGSN (i.e., assumes that the SGSN is capable of
both 2G and 3G operation and interworking); and
\- the GERAN provides information on neighbouring cells such that one of the
cells in the neighbour list matches the cell associated with the GANC, as
provided in the AS-related component of the system information obtained from
the GANC.

> 1\. The source BSS decides to initiate a PS handover. At this point both
> uplink and downlink user data is transmitted via the following: TBFs between
> MS and source BSS, BSSGP PFCs tunnel(s) between the source BSS and 3G/2G
> SGSN, GTP tunnel(s) between the 3G/2G SGSN and GGSN.
>
> 2\. The source BSS sends a _PS Handover Required_ message (TLLI, Cause,
> Source Cell Identifier, Target RNC Identifier, Source RNC to Target RNC
> Transparent Container, Active PFCs List) to the SGSN.
>
> 3\. The SGSN determines from the Target RNC Identifier that this is a GERAN
> to UTRAN handover. The SGSN constructs a _Relocation Request_ message as
> described in 3GPP TS 43.129 [44] and sends the message to the target GANC.
>
> 4\. One or more GAN PTCs are activated between the MS and the GANC as
> specified in steps 3-4 in sub-clause 9.16.2.2. Upon each GA-RRC PTC
> activation, the PS domain GA-RRC sublayer entity in the MS enters the PTC-
> ACTIVE substate and starts the PTC Timer for the PTC.
>
> 5\. The GANC sends the _Relocation Request Acknowledge_ message (Target RNC
> to Source RNC Transparent Container, RABs setup list, RABs failed to setup
> list) to the SGSN. Upon sending the _Relocation Request Acknowledge_ message
> the target GANC shall be prepared to receive downlink GTP PDUs from the SGSN
> for the accepted RABs.
>
> When the SGSN receives the _Relocation Request Acknowledge_ message and it
> decides to proceed with the handover, the preparation phase is finished and
> the execution phase will follow.
#### 9.23.1.2 Execution Phase
Figure 68: GERAN to GAN PS Handover Execution Phase
> 1\. The SGSN continues to receive IP packets from the GGSN (via GTP) and
> forwards the associated PDU payload to the MS via the source BSS.
>
> 2\. When receiving the _Relocation Request Acknowledge_ message the SGSN
> may, based on QoS, start downlink N-PDU relay and duplication to the target
> GANC if a Tunnel Endpoint is available as follows:
\- For PDP context, which uses LLC ADM, all new downlink N-PDUs received after
completion of the PS handover preparation phase are relayed to the target
GANC. All such N-PDUs are encapsulated in a GTP-PDU when transmitted to the
target GANC.
\- If the 3G/2G SGSN forwards downlink packets to the target GANC, the target
GANC may start blind transmission of downlink user data towards the MS over
the allocated PTC(s).
> 3\. The SGSN continues the PS Handover by sending a _PS Handover Required
> Acknowledge_ message (TLLI, List of Set Up PFCs, Target RNC to Source RNC
> Transparent Container) to the source BSS, as described in 3GPP TS 43.129
> [44].
>
> 4\. The SGSN shall send the _Forward SRNS Context_ message (NSAPI, DL GTP-U
> number, UL GTP-U number) to the target GANC if there is at least one PDP
> context which requires \"delivery order\" to be preserved, as described in
> 3GPP TS 43.129 [44].
>
> The target GANC proceed as follows:
\- For RABs not requiring lossless PDCP the target GANC may, according the QoS
profile of the PDP context, store the received data until it receives
confirmation of MS presence in the target cell.
\- The target GANC disregards PDCP sequence numbers, since lossless relocation
is not supported.
> 5\. The source BSS sends the _PS Handover Command_ message containing the
> Handover to UTRAN Command message (as it is specified in 3GPP TS 25.331
> [40]) to the MS, as described in 3GPP TS 43.129 [44].
>
> 6\. Immediately after receiving the _PS Handover Command_ message, the MS
> sends GA-RRC RELOCATION COMPLETE message to the GANC.
>
> 7\. Immediately upon receiving the GA-RRC RELOCATION COMPLETE message from
> the MS, the GANC sends the _Relocation Detect_ message to the SGSN.
>
> 8\. The GANC sends the _Relocation Complete_ message to the SGSN, indicating
> the completion of the PS handover. After the reception of the _Relocation
> Complete_ message the SGSN shall be prepared to receive data from the target
> GANC.
>
> 9\. If the SGSN has established Direct Tunnel, the SGSN sends an _Update PDP
> Context Request_ message (RNC Address, TEID, QoS Negotiated, DTI) to the
> GGSN concerned. The SGSN provides to the GGSN the GANC address for the User
> Plane and TEID for downlink data and shall include the DTI to instruct the
> GGSN to apply Direct Tunnel specific error handling procedure as defined in
> 3GPP TS 23.060 [19]. The GGSN updates the PDP context fields and returns an
> _Update PDP Context Response_ message (TEID). From now on the GGSN sends new
> incoming downlink IP packets to the target GANC instead of the SGSN.
>
> 10\. The SGSN shall initiate PFC Management procedures towards the source
> GERAN cell in order to trigger the release of resources in the source cell.
>
> 11\. The MS and SGSN perform the Routing Area Update procedure as described
> in 3GPP TS 43.129 [44].
### 9.23.2 PS Handover from UTRAN to GAN
#### 9.23.2.1 Preparation Phase
The description of the UTRAN to GAN PS handover procedure assumes the
following:
\- the Iur interface between the UTRAN RNC and GANC is not supported.
Therefore, only the Combined Hard Handover and SRNS Relocation is applicable
for GAN -- UTRAN PS handover. Consequently, only the \"MS Involved\"
Relocation Type is supported;
\- the MS has one or more active PDP Contexts with active RABs in the UTRAN;
\- the MS has successfully registered with a GANC, allowing the MS to obtain
GAN system information;
\- the GANC has directed the MS to operate in GAN Iu mode; and
\- the UTRAN provides information on neighbouring cells such that one of the
cells in the neighbour list matches the cell associated with the GANC, as
provided in the AS-related component of the system information obtained from
the GANC. See Annex B.2.1 for more information.

>
> 4\. One or more GAN PTCs are established between the GANC and MS as
> specified in steps 3-4 in sub-clause 9.16.2.2. Upon the GA-RRC PTC

>
> 5\. The GANC sends the _Relocation Request Acknowledge_ message (Target RNC

> the SGSN.
#### 9.23.2.2 Execution Phase
Figure 70: UTRAN to GAN PS Handover Execution Phase
> 1\. Upon receiving the positive acknowledgement from the GANC to serve the

> these forwarded GTP PDUs, depending on the QoS profile, network conditions,
> and whether it supports data forwarding.
>
> b) The RNC instructs the MS to initiate the switch to GAN via the _Physical

>
> 3\. Immediately after receiving the _Physical Channel Reconfiguration_

### 9.23.3 PS Handover from GAN to GERAN
The description of the GAN to GERAN PS handover procedure assumes the
following:
\- the PS handover is intra-SGSN (i.e., assumes that the SGSN is capable of
both 2G and 3G operation and interworking).
#### 9.23.3.1 Preparation Phase

>
> 4\. The GANC selects a target GERAN cell based on the contents of the GA-RRC

## A.1.3 Fast Re-authentication
When the authentication process is performed frequently, especially with a
large number of connected Mobile Stations, performing fast re-authentication
can reduce the network load resulting from this authentication. The fast re-
authentication process allows the AAA server to authenticate a user based on
keys derived from the last full authentication process.
The MS and GANC-SEGW can use a procedure for fast re-authentication in order
to re-authenticate an MS e.g. when setting up a new SA because the IP address
of the MS has changed as a result of a handover between generic IP access
network attachment points connected to different IP subnets. Fast re-
authentication is provided by EAP-SIM and EAP‑AKA, and does not make use of
the GSM A3/A8 or UMTS algorithms. The MS may use the re-authentication ID in
the IKE_SA_INIT. The decision to make use of the fast re-authentication
procedure is taken by the AAA server.
The basic elements of these procedures are the following:
\- The MS initiates a new SA with a GANC-SEGW that it was previously connected
to and uses the re-authentication ID (re-authentication ID received during the
previous full authentication procedure) in the IKE_SA_INIT exchange. The EAP-
SIM or EAP-AKA procedure is started as a result of these exchanges.
\- The AAA server and MS re-authenticate each other based on the keys derived
on the preceding full authentication.
### A.1.3.1 EAP-SIM Fast Re-authentication
The EAP-SIM specification [30] includes support for fast re-authentication.
The use of this mechanism may be subject to operator policy.
Figure A.3: EAP-SIM fast re-authentication procedure
> 1\. The MS initializes the IKEv2 authentication procedure by starting the
> IKE_SA_INIT exchange. It indicates the desire to use EAP by leaving out the
> AUTH payload from message 3 of the IKE_AUTH exchange, and the initiator
> identity contains the re-authentication identity (this identity was
> previously delivered by AAA server in a full authentication procedure).
>
> 2\. The GANC-SEGW sends an EAP Response/Identity message to the AAA server,
> containing the re‑authentication ID as was included in the third IKE
> message. This triggers the start of EAP-SIM.
>
> 3\. The AAA server initiates the Counter (which was initialized to one in
> the full authentication process) and sends it in the EAP Request message,
> together with the NONCE, the MAC (calculated over the NONCE) and a
> re‑authentication id for a next fast re-authentication. If the AAA server is
> not able to deliver a re-authentication identity, then the MS shall force a
> full-authentication next time (to avoid the use of the re-authentication
> identity more than once).
>
> 4\. The GANC-SEGW forwards the EAP Request message to the MS.
>
> 5\. The MS verifies that the Counter value is fresh and the MAC is correct.
>
> 6\. The MS sends the EAP Response message with the same Counter value and a
> calculated MAC to the GANC‑SEGW.
>
> 7\. The GANC-SEGW forwards the response to the AAA server.
>
> 8\. The AAA server verifies that the Counter value is the same as it sent,
> and that the MAC is correct.
>
> 9\. The AAA server sends an EAP Success message to the GANC-SEGW.
>
> 10\. The GANC-SEGW forwards the EAP Success message to the MS.
### A.1.3.2 EAP-AKA Fast Re-authentication
The EAP-AKA specification [38] includes support for fast re-authentication.
The use of this mechanism may be subject to operator policy.
Figure A.4: EAP-AKA fast re-authentication procedure
> 1\. The MS initializes the IKEv2 authentication procedure by starting the
> IKE_SA_INIT exchange. It indicates the desire to use EAP by leaving out the
> AUTH payload from message 3, the first message of the IKE_AUTH exchange, and
> the initiator identity contains the re-authentication identity (this
> identity was previously delivered by AAA server in a EAP-AKA full
> authentication procedure).
>
> 2\. The GANC-SEGW sends an EAP Response/Identity message to the AAA server,
> containing the re‑authentication ID as was included in the third IKE
> message. This triggers the start of EAP-AKA.
>
> 3\. The AAA server initiates the Counter (which was initialized to one in
> the full authentication process) and sends it in the EAP Request/AKA-
> Reauthentication message, together with the NONCE, the MAC (calculated over
> the NONCE) and a re-authentication id for a next fast re-authentication. If
> the AAA server is not able to deliver a re-authentication identity, then the
> MS shall force a full-authentication next time (to avoid the use of the
> re‑authentication identity more than once).
>
> 4\. The GANC-SEGW forwards the EAP Request/AKA-Reauthentication message to
> the MS.
>
> 5\. The MS verifies that the Counter value is fresh and the MAC is correct.
>
> 6\. The MS sends the EAP Response/AKA-Reauthentication message with the same
> Counter value and a calculated MAC to the GANC-SEGW.
>
> 7\. The GANC-SEGW forwards the response to the AAA server.
>
> 8\. The AAA server verifies that the Counter value is the same as it sent,
> and that the MAC is correct.
>
> 9\. The AAA server sends an EAP Success message to the GANC-SEGW.
>
> 10\. The GANC-SEGW forwards the EAP Success message to the MS.
# A.2 Profile of IKEv2
When IKEv2 [32] is used in the context of this specification the profile
specified in this section shall be supported by the MS and the GANC-SEGW.
IKEv2 shall meet the profiling given in clause 5.4.2 of TS 33.210 [55].
If the MS proposes one or more profiles that were not included in previous
versions of this specification, and the SeGW indicates that the selected
profiles are not acceptable (e.g., the SeGW has not been upgraded to the
current version of this specification), the MS shall be prepared to \"drop
back\" to one or more of the profiles that were included in previous versions
of this specification.

When IPSec ESP [56] is used in the context of this specification the profile
specified in this section shall be supported by the MS and the GANC-SEGW.
IPsec ESP shall meet the profiling given clause 5.3 of TS 33.210 [55] with the
following addition:
\- Tunnel mode shall be used.
If the MS proposes one or more profiles that were not included in previous
versions of this specification, and the SeGW indicates that the selected
profiles are not acceptable (e.g., the SeGW has not been upgraded to the
current version of this specification), the MS shall be prepared to \"drop
back\" to one or more of the profiles that were included in previous versions
of this specification.
###### ## Annex B (informative): Configuration Information
# B.1 GAN A/Gb mode ARFCN/BSIC for handover-to-GAN
Selection of ARFCN may use the following guidelines:
1\. The ARFCN should not be allocated from the operator\'s existing BCCH pool
so that a scarce BCCH is not used.
2\. The ARFCN maybe desired to be the same unique number across the whole
operator network to minimize the BSS configuration effort.
The following are available options for the selection of the ARFCN:
1\. Ideally, the GAN is assigned an ARFCN value, which is not in the frequency
bands currently used by the operator.
2\. Typically, different PLMNs in the same country have disjoint frequency
allocations. For each PLMN, some of the frequencies are reserved for BCCH
beacon; BCCH will be transmitted with constant max power on time slot 0. Other
frequencies are dedicated as traffic channels. The GAN ARFCN could use any
non-BCCH frequency from the carrier\'s existing frequency pool. Standard GSM
MSs will be able to tune onto this channel but will not be able to find the
FCCH burst.
3\. Alternatively, in a PCS-only (1 900 MHz) network, ARFCN can be any value
falling within the GSM (900 MHz) or DCS (1 800 MHz) band. Standard GSM
handsets operating in PCS-only mode will ignore this ARFCN. Tri-band handsets
supporting automatic band change will not be able to find a BCCH on the
associated frequency.
# B.2 GAN Iu mode UARFCN/PSC for handover-to-GAN
Selection of the UTRA Absolute RF Channel Number (UARFCN) and Primary
Scrambling Code (PSC) may use the following guidelines:
1\. The GAN UARFCN may be allocated from the operator\'s existing UARFCN pool.
2\. The GAN UARFCN should be the same as the macro network UARFCN value of the
current serving UTRAN cell for the MS, to avoid the need to require the MS to
do inter-frequency measurements for UTRAN-to-GAN handover purposes (e.g.,
requiring that the MS operate in compressed mode). The GANC may use the
downlink UARFCN of the UTRAN cells in the current active set, received from
the MS in the GA-RC REGISTER REQUEST message, when deciding which UARFCN to
return to the MS in the GA-RC REGISTER ACCEPT message. Note that all UTRAN
cells in the current active set use the same downlink UARFCN.
3\. The GAN PSC may be desired to be the same unique number across the whole
operator network to minimize the RNS configuration effort.
## B.2.1 Cell Measurement Quantities and Values
As described in clause 9.14.2 (CS case) and clause 9.23.2 (PS case), handover
from UTRAN to GAN Iu mode requires that the MS include information
corresponding to the registered GAN Iu mode cell in the _Measurement Report
message sent_ to the RNC. The MS reports the \"highest signal quality\" for
the GAN Iu mode cell. This is not the actual measured signal level on the GAN,
rather an artificial value allowing the MS to indicate preference for the GAN.
The RNC may request that the MS report either the downlink Ec/No (received
energy per chip divided by the noise power spectral density in the band) or
downlink RSCP (Received Signal Code Power) quantities. The MS shall report
maximum values for the Ec/No or RSCP quantities. The maximum value of Ec/No is
63. The maximum value of RSCP is 91.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Identifiers in GAN
# C.1 Identifiers for MSs and generic IP access network
The following are the key MS and generic IP access network addressing
parameters.
1\. The IMSI associated with the (U)SIM in the terminal.
\- The MS provide the IMSI to the GANC during the Registration procedure. The
GANC maintains a record for each registered MS. For example, IMSI is used by
the GANC to index the appropriate MS record when the GANC receives a BSSMAP
PAGING message.
2\. Public IP Address of the MS.
\- The Public IP address of MS is the source IP present in the outermost IP
header of packets received from the MS by the GANC-SEGW. If available, this
identifier may be used by the GANC to support location services and fraud
detection or by service providers to signal Managed IP networks IP flows that
require special QoS treatment.
3\. The generic IP access network point of attachment address (AP-ID).
\- The MS provides the AP-ID to the GANC at Registration. The AP-ID may be
used by the GANC to support location services or by the service provider to
restrict GAN access to authorized APs.
# C.2 Cell identifiers for GAN A/Gb mode
## C.2.1 GAN Cell Id for Location Services & Billing
Cell Global Identities (CGI) may be used to perform location-basing routeing
of a call for services such as: emergency services; operators; announcements
and freephone numbers. Cell identities can be also used by the core network to
identify the location of where a call was originated/terminated for charging
purposes. The GANC provides a CGI to the core network indicating the GAN cell.
### C.2.1.1 Assigning GAN Cell Id based on GSM location
In the GAN architecture, the MS has a direct IP-based connection to the GANC.
The GAN coverage area may overlay the GERAN coverage area. Logical mapping of
GAN Cells to a CGI can be completed at various resolutions, for example (but
not limited to):
\- a GAN cell for each GSM cell;
\- a GAN cell for each GSM routeing area; or
\- a GAN cell for each GSM location area.
A single GANC could represent one or more cells (CGI) in one or more location
areas (LAI).
## C.2.2 GAN Cell Id for handover-to-GAN
The GAN cell id used for location and charging can be independent from the GAN
cell id used for handover.
A single GANC represents a single cell, and referred to as GAN cell, for the
purpose of handover from GERAN to GAN. This \"handover-GANC-CGI\" is not
visible to the MS. It is only used in the GERAN and CN for identifying a
target cell (i.e. target GANC) for handover from GERAN to GAN, and ignored by
the GANC, when received during the handover via the A-interface.
The \"handover-GANC-CGI\" assigned to the GANC is configured as the target
handover cell in all neighbouring GERAN cells (in the ARFCN/BSIC-to-CGI
mapping table). Neighbouring GERAN cells are those whose service area
\"overlaps\" the GANC service area, for the purpose of handover.
For example, neighbour cells are:
\- All GERAN cells attached to the same MSC as the GANC.
\- All GERAN cells attached to a different MSC but that can handover to the
MSC to which the GANC is attached.
When the MS reports measurements to the GERAN BSS on the GAN cell identified
by its ARFCN/BSIC, then the GERAN BSS maps the ARFCN/BSIC to the \"handover-
GANC-CGI\" through its mapping table, and is thus able to identify the target
cell (GANC) for handover-to-GAN.
## C.2.3 GAN ARFCN/BSIC for handover-to-GAN
The GERAN-to-GAN handover method makes use of an RF channel number (ARFCN) and
base station identity code (BSIC) parameters to identify the GAN target cell.
All GANCs in a given operator domain can share the same ARFCN/BSIC values, if
there is a single GANC neighbour per GSM cell. This ARFCN/BSIC is indicated to
the MS by the GANC during GAN registration.
The selection of the RF channel number (ARFCN) used for the UTRAN to GAN
handover procedure should not correspond to a channel from any frequency band
defined in 3GPP TS 45.005, to avoid UEs not requiring compressed mode for GSM
measurements from unnecessarily powering up their GSM receivers.
