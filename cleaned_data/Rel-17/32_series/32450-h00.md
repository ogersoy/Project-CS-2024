f) E-UTRAN
g) Accessibility
h) Percentage
i) RATIO
j) The definition of the service provided by E-UTRAN is E-RABs.
#### 6.1.1.2 Extended definition
Mapping of end-user applications towards E-RABs can be different depending on
operator strategy; hence the measurement shall be adjustable depending on
operator E-RAB mapping strategy.
Table 1 Example of service mapping towards E-RABs
* * *
**_Operator_** **_Service_** **_E-RAB mapping_** A X Initial E-RAB A Y Initial
E-RAB B X Initial E-RAB B Y Added E-RAB
* * *
To provide Accessibility measurement from E-UTRAN that can be mapped to a
service for the operator the following measurements are defined:
A1: Initial E-RAB establishment success rate
A2: Added E-RAB establishment success rate
The establishment success rate is defined as:
Services can be mapped towards either Initial or Added E-RABs depending on
operator strategy. If a different QoS characteristic is required compared with
the QoS characteristic provided by an existing Initial E-RAB, an Added E-RAB
can be requested. QoS characteristics can be defined on an E-RAB basis; hence
both Initial E-RAB establishment success rate (A1) and Added E-RAB
establishment success rate (A2) shall be available per QoS group.
With these two measures the operator can calculate the service accessibility
depending on E-RAB mapping as follows:
Service mapped on Initial E-RAB = A1*100 [%]
Service mapped on Added E-RAB = A1*A2*100 [%]
## 6.2 KPI Category \"Retainability\"
### 6.2.1 E-RAB Retainability
#### 6.2.1.1 Definition
a) E-RAB Retainability.
b) A measurement that shows how often an end-user abnormally looses an > E-RAB
during the time the E-RAB is used.
c) Number of E-RABs with data in a buffer that was abnormally released, >
normalized with number of data session time units.
d) To measure E-RAB Retainability for a single QCI (R1) is fairly > straight
forward.\ > \ > \ > \ > However to measure the E-RAB Retainability for UEs is
not as > straight forward. The measurement R1 is defined to look at the >
activity level of just one QCI at the time, so to use this formula > and
measurements in an aggregated way to get E-RAB Retainability > on UE level
will not be accurate (e.g. for an UE with multiple > E-RABs, there might be
E-RABs that are active at the same time, > hence aggregating the QCI
measurements for session time will give > a larger session time than the total
UE session time. See picture > below).\ > \ > \ > Hence a measurement E-RAB
Retainability on UE level is defined > (R2) to provide a measurement for the
overall E-RAB Retainability.
e) ERAB.RelActNbr.QCI\ > \ > ERAB.SessionTimeUE\ > \ >
ERAB.SessionTimeQCI._QCI_
f) E-UTRAN.
g) Retainability.
h) Active release/second.
i) MEAN.
j) The definition of the service provided by E-UTRAN is E-RABs.
#### 6.2.1.2 Extended definition
The retainability rate is defined as:
As for defining an abnormal E-RAB release with end-user impact, it shall only
be considered an abnormal release of the E-RABs if the eNodeB considers there
to be data waiting for transfer in any of the buffers.
As for defining an E-RAB as active, an E-RAB shall be considered active if
there recently has been any data transmission in any direction.
## 6.3 KPI Category \"Integrity\"
### 6.3.1 E-UTRAN IP Throughput
#### 6.3.1.1 Definition
a) E-UTRAN IP Throughput.
b) A KPI that shows how E-UTRAN impacts the service quality provided to an
end-user.
c) Payload data volume on IP level per elapsed time unit on the Uu interface.
d) IP Throughput for a single QCI:
e) DRB.IPThpDl._QCI_
DRB.IPThpUl._QCI_
f) E-UTRAN
g) Integrity
h) kbit/s
i) MEAN
j) To make sure that only impacts from the RAN is included in this
measurement, time units to be included in \"elapsed time unit on the Uu
interface \"shall only be the ones where there is data in the buffer to be
transmitted E.g.in application data flows such as a web session, there are
times when there is no data to transmit by the eNodeB due to bursty traffic
pattern, then this \"eNodeB idle time\" shall not be included in \"elapsed
time unit on the Uu interface \".
#### 6.3.1.2 Extended definition
To achieve a Throughput measurement (below examples are given for DL) that is
independent of file size it is important to remove the samples where one TTI
on the radio interface is not utilized. (Successful transmission, buffer empty
in figure below).
Figure 1
To achieve a throughput measurement that is independent of bursty traffic
pattern, it is important to make sure that idle gaps between incoming data is
not included in the measurements. That shall be done as considering each burst
of data as one sample.
ThpVolDl is the volume on IP level and the ThpTimeDl is the time elapsed on Uu
for transmission of the volume included in ThpVolDl.
Figure 2
$\text{IP}\ \text{Throughput}\ \text{DL} =
\sum_{\text{Samples}}^{}\text{ThpVolDl}\sum_{\text{Samples}}^{}\text{ThpTimeDl}$
Since services can be mapped towards different kind of E-RABs, the IP
Throughput measurement shall be available per QoS group.
### 6.3.2 E-UTRAN IP Latency
#### 6.3.2.1 Definition
a) E-UTRAN IP Latency.
b) A measurement that shows how E-UTRAN impacts on the delay experienced by an
end-user.
c) Time from reception of IP packet to transmission of first packet over the
Uu.
d) $\text{Downlink}\ \text{Lat}_{\text{QCI} = x} =
\text{DRB}\text{.}\text{IPLatDl}_{\text{QCI} = x}$
e) DRB.IPLatDl._QCI_
f) E-UTRAN.
g) Integrity.
h) Milliseconds.
i) MEAN.
j) To make sure only contribution from the RAN is included in this
measurement, only delay of the first block to the Uu is counted.
#### 6.3.2.2 Extended definition
To achieve a delay measurement that is independent of IP data block size only
the first packet sent to Uu is measured.
To find the delay for a certain packet size the IP Throughput measure can be
used together with IP Latency (after the first block on the Uu, the remaining
time of the packet can be calculated with the IP Throughput measure).
Figure 3
T_Lat is defined as the time between receiption of IP packet and the time when
the eNodeB transmits the first block to Uu.
Since services can be mapped towards different kind of E-RABs, the Latency
measure shall be available per QoS group.

\frac{\text{HO}\text{.}\text{PrepSucc}\text{.}\text{QCI}_{\text{QCI} =
x}}{\text{HO}\text{.}\text{PrepAtt}\text{.}\text{QCI}_{\text{QCI} = x}} \times
