# 1 Scope
The present document is part of a series of documents that specify charging
functionality and charging management in 3GPP networks. The 3GPP core network
charging architecture and principles are specified in 3GPP TS 32.240 [2],
which provides an umbrella for other charging management TSs that specify:
\- the content of the CDRs per domain / subsystem / service (offline
charging);
\- the content of real-time charging messages per domain / subsystem / service
(online charging);
\- the functionality of online and offline charging for those domains /
subsystems / services;
\- the interfaces that are used in the charging framework to transfer the
charging information (i.e. CDRs or charging events).
The complete document structure for these TSs is defined in 3GPP TS 32.240
[2].
The present document specifies the converged offline and online charging
description for the Edge Computing domain based on the functional stage 2
description in 3GPP TS 23.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 23.558 [9].
Edge computing in 5G environment involves the services or capabilities
provided by multiple service providers and entities in the form of following
business roles:
\- ASP providing edge application service to the subscribers;
\- ECSP providing edge enabling infrastructure and edge enabling services to
ASP;
\- MNO providing 5GS capabilities supporting edge computing.
The present document specifies following charging aspects for Edge Computing:
\- Subscriber charging:
\- MNO charges the subscribers for usage of 5GS capabilities supporting edge
computing.
\- Service-provider charging:
\- MNO charges the industry consumer (e.g. ECSP, ASP) for 5GS capabilities
provided to support edge computing in total instead of for each individual
subscriber;
\- ECSP charges the ASP for the edge enabling infrastructure and services.
NOTE: In the Edge Computing deployments, there could be scenarios where one or
more of the business roles are supported by a single enterprise, i.e. one
enterprise may play a single business role or multiple business roles, for
instance the enterprise may only play the MNO role, or play both MNO and ESCP
roles. There could be various business models between the service providers
and the served consumer(s) for edge computing in 5G environment in manifold
business modes such as B2C, B2B and B2B2X, for example (but not limited to).
The present document does not impose restrictions to any possible business
model or deployment scenario for Edge Computing.

## 4.2 Edge Computing domain converged charging architecture
### 4.2.1 Converged charging architecture for 5GS usage based charging for
Edge Computing
For 5GS usage based charging for Edge Computing, the 5G data connectivity
domain converged charging architecture defined in 3GPP TS 32.255 [11] is
applied.
### 4.2.2 Converged charging architecture with MnS producer enabled by CEF
The CEF consumes the MnS from the MnS producer for EAS management (see 3GPP TS
28.538 [12]), and determines the occurrence of charging events towards to the
CHF for converged charging processing. The CDRs generation is performed by the
CHF acting as a CDF, which _transfers them to the CGF.\ Finally, the CGF
creates CDR files and forwards them to the BD._
If the CGF is external, the CHF acting as a CDF, forwards the CDRs to the CGF
across the Ga interface.\ If the CGF is integrated, there is only one internal
interface between the CHF and the CGF. In this case, the relationship between
CHF and CGF is 1:1. An integrated CGF may support the Ga interface from other
CDFs.
When an external CGF is used, this CGF may also be used by other, i.e.
non-5GCS, network elements, according to network design and operator decision.
It should be noted that the CGF may also be an integrated component of the BD
- in this case, the Bd interface does not exist and is replaced by a
proprietary solution internal to the BD.

support of MnS producer.

And, the charging information for PDU sessions and service data flows are
correlated to each edge application.
The charging functions for 5GS usage for Edge Computing supports both
subscriber based charging and inter-provider based charging.

The scenarios, principles, message flows, CDR generation, Ga record transfer
flows and Bd CDR file transfer for converged online and offline charging for
5G data connectivity specified in 3GPP TS 32.255 [11] are also applied to 5GS

In addition, the SMF provides the information for correlating the PDU session
and service data flow to the edge application for charging, and optionally
reports the monitored QoS result (e2e packet delay obtained by QoS monitoring
in 5GS, see 3GPP TS 23.501 [8]) along with the 5GS usage for charging.
### 5.2.2 Charging scenarios for edge enabling infrastructure resource usage
#### 5.2.2.1 Basic principles
##### 5.2.2.1.1 General
Converged charging for edge enabling infrastructure resources usage may be
performed by the CEF interacting with CHF using Nchf specified in 3GPP TS
32.290 [6] and 3GPP TS 32.291 [7]. In order to provide the data required for
the management activities outlined in 3GPP TS 32.240 [1] (Credit-Control,
accounting, billing, statistics, etc.), the CEF shall be able to perform
converged charging for each of the following:
\- virtual CPU usage (see VR.VCpuUsageMean in clause 5.7.1.1.1 of 3GPP TS
28.552 [13]);
\- virtual memory usage (see VR.VMemoryUsageMean in clause 5.7.1.2.1 of 3GPP
TS 28.552 [13]);
\- virtual disk usage (see VR.VDiskUsageMean in clause 5.7.1.3.1 in 3GPP TS
28.552 [13]);
\- data volumes (see DataVolum.InBytesEAS in clause 5.7.2.1 and
DataVolum.OutBytesEAS in clause 5.7.2.2 of 3GPP TS 28.552 [13]).
The CEF shall request the MnS producer to create the measurement job for
collecting the performance measurements on the usage of edge infrastructure
resource for supporting the EAS.
Once the performance measurements on the usage of edge infrastructure resource
are received or obtained, the CEF shall be able to report the corresponding
charging events to CHF for CDR generation.
A detailed formal description of the converged charging parameters defined in
the present document is to be found in 3GPP TS 32.291 [7].
A detailed formal description of the CDR parameters defined in the present
document is to be found in 3GPP TS 32.298 [3].
##### 5.2.2.1.2 Applicable Triggers in the CEF
When a charging event is issued towards the CHF by the CEF, it includes
details of charging information, such as EAS identifier (e.g. EAS ID, see 3GPP
TS 23.558 [9]).
Each trigger condition (i.e. chargeable event) defined for edge enabling
infrastructure resource usage charging, is specified with the associated
behaviour when they are met.
The immediate report is applied to the chargeable events for edge enabling
infrastructure resource usage charging, i.e. the chargeable events for which.
When the CEF consumes the MnS to create measurement job, the converged
charging is activated. When the CEF receives or gets the performance data
report containing the usage of edge enabling infrastructure resource, the CEF
invokes a Charging Data Request to report the charging data based on PEC to
CHF.
The charging for edge enabling infrastructure resources usage cannot be
enabled and disabled by CHF.
Table 5.2.2.1.2-1 summarizes the set of default trigger conditions and their
category which shall be supported by the CEF when charging is active for the
edge enabling infrastructure resource usage charging.

#### 5.2.2.2 Message flows
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
The flows in the present document specify the interactions between the MnS
producer, CEF and CHF for edge enabling infrastructure resource usage
converged charging.
The interaction between MnS producer and CEF is based on MnS procedures for
performance assurance specified in 3GPP TS 28.538 [12] and 3GPP TS 28.550
[14].
This interaction between CEF and CHF is based on Charging Data Request
/Response specified in 3GPP TS 32.290 [6].

#### 5.2.2.3 CDR generation
##### 5.2.2.3.1 Introduction
The CHF CDRs for edge enabling infrastructure resource usage charging are
generated by the CHF to collect charging information that they subsequently
transfer to the Charging Gateway Function (CGF).
The following clauses describe in detail the conditions for generating the CHF
CDR.
##### 5.2.2.3.2 Triggers for CHF CDR
##### 5.2.2.3.2.1 General {#general-7 .H6}
An edge enabling infrastructure resource usage charging CHF CDR is used to
collect charging information related to edge enabling infrastructure resource
usage chargeable events.
##### 5.2.2.3.2.2 Triggers for CHF CDR generation {#triggers-for-chf-cdr-
generation .H6}
The CHF decides whether to create a CDR for each received Charging Data
Request [Event].
#### 5.2.2.4 Ga record transfer flows

### 5.2.3 Charging scenarios for EAS deployment
#### 5.2.3.1 Basic principles
##### 5.2.3.1.1 General
Converged charging for EAS deployment may be performed by the CEF interacting
with CHF using Nchf specified in 3GPP TS 32.290 [6] and 3GPP TS 32.291 [7]. In
order to provide the data required for the management activities outlined in
3GPP TS 32.240 [1] (Credit-Control, accounting, billing, statistics etc.), the
CEF shall be able to perform converged charging for each of the following:
\- EAS deployment (see clause 5.1.2 3GPP TS 28.538 [12]);
\- EAS modification (see clause 5.1.5 3GPP TS 28.538 [12]);
\- EAS termination (see clause 5.1.3 3GPP TS 28.538 [12]).
The CEF shall subscribe to the notifications from the provisioning MnS
producer for EAS LCM.
Once the notification about EAS LCM is received, the CEF shall be able to
report the corresponding charging events to CHF for CDR generation.
A detailed formal description of the converged charging parameters defined in
the present document is to be found in 3GPP TS 32.291 [7].
A detailed formal description of the CDR parameters defined in the present
document is to be found in 3GPP TS 32.298 [3].
##### 5.2.3.1.2 Applicable Triggers in the CEF
When a charging event is issued towards the CHF by the CEF, it includes
details of charging information, such as EAS identifier (e.g. EAS ID, see 3GPP
TS 23.558 [9]).
Each trigger condition (i.e. chargeable event) defined for EAS deployment
charging, is specified with the associated behaviour when they are met.
The immediate report is applied to the chargeable events for EAS deployment
charging, i.e. the chargeable events for which, when occurring, the current
counts are closed and sent together with the charging data generated by the
CEF towards the CHF in a Charging Data Request. New counts are started by the
CEF.
When the CEF subscribes to the notifications about EAS LCM from the MnS
producer, the converged charging is activated. When the CEF receives
notifications about EAS LCM , the CEF invokes a Charging Data Request the CHF
to report the EAS LCM activity as PEC.
Table 5.2.3.1.2-1 summarizes the set of default trigger conditions and their
category which shall be supported by the CEF when charging is active for the
EAS deployment charging.

deleteMOI operation (see 3GPP TS 28.532 [15]) for the EASFunction IOC (see
3GPP TS 28.538 [12]).
**3) EAS LCM process:** The MnS producer processes and executes the EAS LCM
according to the request (e.g. instantiation, upgrade, deletion).
**4) EAS LCM response:** The MnS producer sends the EAS LCM result to the MnS
consumer.
**5) EAS LCM notification:** The MnS producer sends the EAS LCM notification
(i.e. notifyMOICreation, notifyMOIAttributeValueChanges, or notifyMOIDeletion)
to the CEF:
> **5ch-a) Charging Data Request [Event]:** The CEF generates charging data
> related to the EAS LCM notification and sends the charging data request.
>
> **5ch-b) Create CDR:** The CHF stores received information and create a CDR
> related to the event.

Converged charging for edge enabling services, when activated may be performed
by the EES interacting with CHF using Nchf specified in 3GPP TS 32.290 [6] and
3GPP TS 32.291 [7]. In order to provide the data required for the management
activities outlined in 3GPP TS 32.240 [1] (Credit-Control, accounting,
billing, statistics, etc.), the EES shall be able to perform converged
charging for each of the following:
\- Edge enabling services directly provided by ECSP to ASP (see 3GPP TS 23.558
[9]):
\- EAS registration;
\- EAS discovery;
\- Support to Service Continuity;
\- Application Client information exposure;
\- Edge enabling services exposed by ECSP to ASP (see 3GPP TS 23.558 [9]):
\- Obtaining UE location;
\- ACR management events subscription;
\- Session with QoS.
The EES shall be able to perform converged charging by interacting with CHF,
for charging data related to the evens mentioned above. The Charging Data
Request and Charging Data Response are exchanged between the EES and the CHF,
based on either IEC or PEC scenarios as specified in 3GPP TS 32.290 [6].
The contents and purpose of each charging event that triggers interaction with
CHF, as well as the chargeable events that trigger them, are described in the
following clauses.
A detailed formal description of the converged charging parameters defined in
the present document is to be found in 3GPP TS 32.291 [7].
A detailed formal description of the CDR parameters defined in the present
document is to be found in 3GPP TS 32.298 [3].
NOTE: How to avoid double triggering or support correlation of charging events
from both NEF and EES is not addressed in the present document.
##### 5.2.4.1.2 Applicable triggers in the EES
When a charging event is issued towards the CHF by the EES, it includes
details of charging information, such as EAS identifier (e.g. EAS ID, see 3GPP
TS 23.558 [9]).
Each trigger condition (i.e. chargeable event) defined for edge enabling
services charging, is specified with the associated behaviour when they are
met.
