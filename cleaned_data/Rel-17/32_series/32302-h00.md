Point (IRP): Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) Solution Set (SS)
The Itf-N interface is built up by a number of Integration Reference Points
(IRPs) and a related Name Convention, which realise the functional
capabilities over this interface. The basic structure of the IRPs is defined
in 3GPP TS 32.101 [5] and 3GPP TS 32.102 [6].
Network Elements (NEs) under management and element managers generate
notifications of events about occurrences within the network. Different kinds
of events carry different kinds of information. For instance a new alarm as
specified in Alarm IRP: Information Service [1], is one possible kind of
event, an object creation as specified in Basic CM IRP: Information Service
[8] is another possible kind of event.
Information of an event is carried in notification. An IRPAgent (typically an
EM or a NE) emits notifications. IRPManager (typically a network management
system) receives notifications. The purpose of Notification IRP is to define
an interface through which an IRPManager can subscribe to IRPAgent for
receiving notifications.
This IRP bases its design on work captured in ITU-T Recommendation X.734 [2],
OMG Notification Service [4]. The central design ideas are:
\- Separation of notification Consumers (IRPManagers) from Producers
(IRPAgents);
\- Notifications are sent to IRPManagers without the need for IRPManagers to
periodically check for new notifications.
Common characteristics related to notifications in all other IRPs are gathered
in one IRP.
# 1 Scope
The purpose of Notification IRP is to define an interface through which an
IRPManager can subscribe to an IRPAgent for receiving notifications. The
present document is the \"Information Service\" of Notification IRP. It
defines, for the purpose of subscribing to an IRPAgent for receiving
notifications, the information observable and controlled by management
system\'s client and it also specifies the semantics of the interactions used
to carry this information. It also defines the information common to all
notifications which is called the notificationHeader.
An IRPAgent supporting this IRP IS may emit one or multiple categories of
notifications, such as alarms (as specified in Alarm IRP: Information Service
[1]) and others. This IRP IS defines a mechanism that IRPManager can use to
determine the categories of notifications supported by an IRPAgent. It also
defines a mechanism (subscribe and unsubscribe operations) that IRPManager can
use to specify the categories of notifications IRPAgent should emit to
IRPManager during subscription. It also defines a mechanism
(getSubscriptionIds operation) that IRPManager can use to check which
categories of notifications it has subscribed to. IRPManager can set and
change filter criteria applicable during the life-cycle of a subscription.
IRPManager can also exercise flow-control on IRPAgent\'s emission of
notifications (suspendSubscription and resumeSubscription operations).
Using different managerReference, an IRPManager can subscribe several times.
It will result in multiple subscriptions. As far as IRPAgent is concerned,
notifications are sent to multiple \"places\".
Using the same managerReference, an IRPManager can subscribe several times
specifying different categories of notifications.
This IRP IS does not specify information that is carried in some but not all
notifications. That kind of information is specified in other IRP ISs
involved. For example, perceivedSeverity is a piece of information specific
for notifications carrying alarm information. This information is not defined
in the present document but in Alarm IRP: Information Service [1].
How IRPManager discovers the IRPAgent\'s address or reference (so that
IRPManager can invoke an operation) is outside the scope of the present
document.
This IRP IS is aligned with ITU-T M.3702 [13] in terms of the definitions of
operations for Notification management.

For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [14], 3GPP TS 32.101 [5], 3GPP TS 32.102 [6] and 3GPP TS 32.301
[7] and the following apply. A term defined in the present document takes
precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905
[14], 3GPP TS 32.101 [5], 3GPP TS 32.102 [6] and 3GPP TS 32.301 [7].
**IRPAgent:** See 3GPP TS 32.102 [6].
**IRPManager:** See 3GPP TS 32.102 [6].
**event:** it is an occurrence that is of significance to network operators,
the NEs under surveillance and network management applications\ Events can
indicate many types of network management information, such as network alarms,
network configuration change information and network performance data.
**notification:** it refers to the transport of information regarding events
from event producer to consumer (receiver)\ In this IRP, notification is used
to carry information about network events from IRPAgent to IRPManager.
Producer sends notifications to consumers as soon as new events occur.
Consumer does not need to check (\"pull\") for events.
**IRP:** See 3GPP TS 32.102 [6].
**notification category:** The semantics and syntax of the notification
category string are identical to that defined for "IRP document version number
string", see 3GPP TS 32.311 [11] subclause 3.1.
**qualifiers:** the meaning of qualifiers for operations, parameters and
information attributes (whether they are Mandatory(M)/ Conditional(C)/
Optional(O)) defined in the present (Information Service) document is provided
in 3GPP TS 32.102 [6].\ Moreover, qualifiers of information attributes, when
those information attributes are re-used in other IRP ISs, obey to the
following rule: Mandatory and Conditional qualifiers of information attributes
shall always be the same in other IRPs ISs, Optional qualifiers of information
attributes may be set to either Optional or Mandatory in the other IRP ISs.
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR
21.905 [14] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present

NotificationIRP can lose the list of managerReference that identifies current
IRPManagers under subscription. Under this condition, IRPAgent is incapable of
sending events to the affected subscriber(s).
This Notification IRP recommends that IRPManager should invoke the
getSubscriptionStatus operation periodically to confirm that IRPAgent still
has the IRPManager\'s reference in its list. In case getSubscriptionStatus
returns the exception operation_failed, IRPManager should assume that IRPAgent
has lost the IRPManager\'s reference.
This IRP does not recommend the frequency IRPManager should use to invoke
getSubscriptionStatus operation.

## 6.2 Generic rules
**Rule 1:** Each operation with at least one input parameter supports a pre-
condition valid_input_parameter which indicates that all input parameters
shall be valid with regards to their information type. Additionally, each such
operation supports an exception operation_failed_invalid_input_parameter which
is raised when pre-condition valid_input_parameter is false. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
**Rule 2:** Each operation with at least one optional input parameter supports
a set of pre-conditions supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx where \"xxx\"
is the name of the optional input parameter and the pre-condition indicates
that the operation supports the named optional input parameter. Additionally,
each such operation supports an exception
operation_failed_unsupported_optional_input_parameter_xxx which is raised when
(a) the pre-condition supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx is false and (b)
the named optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
**Rule 3:** Each operation shall support a generic exception
operation_failed_internal_problem which is raised when an internal problem
occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception has the same
entry and exit state.

## 6.9 NotificationIRPNotification Interface
IRPAgent notifies the subscribed IRPManager that an event has occurred and
that the event has satisfied the filter constraints used for this
subscription. One event example is the notification defined in Alarm IRP: IS
(3GPP TS 32.111â€‘2 [1]).
It should be possible to pack multiple notifications together for sending to
NM. This provides more efficient use of data communication resources. In order
to pack multiple notifications, an EM/NE configurable parameter defines the
maximum number of notifications to be packed together. Additionally an EM/NE
configurable parameter defines the maximum time delay before the notifications
have to be sent.
Under normal operations, an IRPAgent shall send, to each IRPManager,
notifications in the same order they were generated, i.e. in the First-In,
First-Out order. There shall not be any priority given to types of
notifications.
This interface doesn\'t define any specific notification but instead defines
information that is commonly found in notifications defined by other IRPs.
This information is called notificationHeader. Notification interfaces defined
in other IRPs, such as Alarm IRP: IS (3GPP TS 32.111â€‘2 [1]), shall inherit
from this interface and define their notifications by:
\- Identifying and qualifying the Notification Header attributes for their
use;
\- Specify additional attributes specific to their use.
Despite the fact that the semantic of notifications is defined by other IRP
ISs, it is notification IRP and not those IRP that is responsible for the
emission of those notifications.
The Notification Header is defined here below.
+------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------+ | Attribute Name | Qualifier | Comment | +------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------+ | objectClass | M, Y | It specifies the class name of the | | | | IOC. A network event has occurred | | | | in an instance of this class. | +------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------+ | objectInstance | M, Y | It specifies the instance of the | | | | above IOC in which the network | | | | event occurred by carrying the | | | | Distinguished Name (DN) of this | | | | object instance. This object may or | | | | may not be identical to the object | | | | instance actually emitting the | | | | notification. | +------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------+ | notificationId | O,N | This is an identifier for the | | | | notification, which may be used to | | | | correlate notifications. The | | | | identifier of the notification | | | | shall be chosen to be unique across | | | | all notifications of a particular | | | | managed object throughout the time | | | | that correlation is significant, it | | | | uniquely identifies the | | | | notification from other | | | | notifications generated by the | | | | subject Information Object. | | | | | | | | If IRPManager receives | | | | notifications from one IRPAgent, | | | | IRPManager shall use the identifier | | | | of the notification and the | | | | objectInstance to uniquely identify | | | | all received notifications. | | | | | | | | If IRPManager receives | | | | notifications from multiple | | | | IRPAgents and notifications of each | | | | Information Object are reported at | | | | most through one IRPAgent, | | | | IRPManager shall use the identifier | | | | of the notification and | | | | objectInstance to uniquely identify | | | | all received notifications. | | | | | | | | If IRPManager receives | | | | notifications from multiple | | | | IRPAgents and notifications of one | | | | or more Information Objects are | | | | reported through two or more | | | | IRPAgents, IRPManager shall use the | | | | identifier of the notification | | | | together with objectInstance and | | | | the identity of IRPAgent | | | | (systemDN), to uniquely identify | | | | all received notifications. If the | | | | information systemDN is absent, | | | | IRPManager needs other means, which | | | | are outside the scope of this IRP, | | | | to determine the identity of | | | | IRPAgent. | | | | | | | | How identifiers of notifications | | | | are re-used to correlate | | | | notifications is outside of the | | | | scope of this recommendation. | +------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------+ | eventTime | M, Y | It indicates the event occurrence | | | | time. The semantics of Generalised | | | | Time specified by ITU-T shall be | | | | used here. | +------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------+ | systemDN | C, Y | The systemDN of that notification | | | | shall carry either (1) the IRPAgent | | | | instance containing that Interface | | | | IRP instance, or (2) the DN of that | | | | particular Interface IRP instance | | | | responsible for the emission of the | | | | notification. | | | | | | | | (1) If the IRPAgent contains | | | | single (not multiple) Interface IRP | | | | instance of a particular class, | | | | then the systemDN of a notification | | | | may carry the DN of the IRPAgent or | | | | DN of the subject Interface IRP | | | | instance. | | | | | | | | (2) If the IRPAgent contains | | | | multiple Interface IRP instances of | | | | the same class, then the systemDN | | | | of a notification shall carry the | | | | DN of a particular Interface IRP | | | | instance responsible for the | | | | emission of that notification. | | | | | | | | Example of item (2) above: | | | | | | | | - Alarm IRP:IS specifies | | | | notifyNewAlarm. If there are | | | | multiple AlarmIRP instances under | | | | one IRPAgent, then the systemDN of | | | | notifyNewAlarm shall be present and | | | | carry the DN of the AlarmIRP. | +------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------+ | notificationType | M, Y | The type of notification which is | | | | reported by the notification | +------------------+-----------+-------------------------------------+
