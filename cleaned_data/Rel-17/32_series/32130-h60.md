# Introduction
Network sharing is emerging as a mechanism for operators to substantially and
sustainably improve network costs and to efficiently utilize network capacity.
The traditional model of single ownership of all network layers and elements
is being challenged and more and more operators are adopting network sharing
as a means of cutting the heavy costs involved in initial roll-out, capital
expenditure (**CAPEX)** and operational expenditure (OPEX).
In general, an increasing number of operators are sharing their mobile
networks. Main arguments presented are:
\- Increased rollout speed.
\- Quickly expanding coverage to meet customer demand for wider coverage.
\- Sharing low traffic areas.
\- Sharing high license burdens.
\- Lower CAPEX and OPEX.
Network sharing has some major implications on the operations of the network.
Alignment on operational priorities, common network planning/evolution
strategy, sharing end user data/subscriber data, sharing performance data,
alarms etc. in the shared network need to be considered carefully. Privacy,
security and competitive information are also important for the operations of
a shared network.
# 1 Scope

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TS 32.101 [2], TS 32.102 [3] and TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term
defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the
same term, if any, in TS 32.101 [2], TS 32.102 [3] and TR 21.905 [1], in that
order.
Organizational roles:
**Master Operator (MOP):** In Radio Access Network (RAN) and/or Core Network
(CN) sharing scenarios, deployment and daily operation of shared network
elements are entrusted to a single Actor, called the Master Operator. The
Master Operator provides network and OAM&P services to other Operators, called
Participating Operators (POPs). The Master Operator is the only one to have a
direct OAM&P connection from its Domain Manager (DM) to the shared network
elements.
**Participating Operator (POP):** Participating Operators are service
providers who share, alongside other Participating Operators, the network (RAN
and/or CN) facilities provided by the Master Operator. According to TS 36.300
[4] up to 6 operators can share a RAN.
Note: In a RAN/CN sharing scenario where Company A and Company B are POPs, MOP
represents a role which can be played by either:
\- Company A or Company B: in that case, Company A or Company B plays both
roles, i.e. is the MOP and one of the POPs simultaneously, or
\- A joint-venture between Company A and Company B, or
\- A third-party entity: in this context, third party is referring to a
wholesale mobile connectivity provider.
In the two latter cases, companies A and B rely on another company to play the
role of MOP. This company cannot play the role of POP.
Management systems:
**Master Operator Network Manager (MOP-NM):** Network Manager enabling the
Master Operator to manage the shared RAN and/or shared CN.
**Master Operator Shared CN dm (MOP--SC-DM):** Domain Manager enabling the
Master Operator to manage the Shared CN.
**Master Operator Shared RAN dm (MOP--SR-DM):** Domain Manager enabling the
MOP to manage the Shared RAN.
**Participating Operator CN DM (POP-CORE-DM):** Domain Manager enabling a
Participating Operator to manage its own (not shared) Core Network.
**Participating Operator Network Manager (POP-NM):** Network Manager enabling
a Participating Operator to manage its own (not shared) network and its
portion of the shared network.
**Participating Operator RAN DM (POP-RAN-DM):** Domain Manager enabling a
Participating Operator to manage its own (not shared) RAN.
Managed resources in a shared Radio Access Network (RAN) environment:
**Shared RAN (S-RAN):** A set of Radio Access Network elements shared among
Participating Operators.
Managed resources in a shared Core Network (CN) environment:
**Shared CN (S-CORE):** A set of Core Network elements shared among
Participating Operators. It may or may not include all core network elements.
For example, the Participating Operators may share only the MMEs while having
independent S/P GWs.

# 4 Concepts and background
## 4.1 RAN sharing scenarios
Various network sharing scenarios exist, amongst which one category is RAN
sharing which can be divided into the following (non exhaustive) list of sub-
categories:
\- Passive RAN sharing, also known as infrastructure sharing (including site
sharing).
\- Active RAN sharing, where active network elements of the RAN are shared:
\- RAN-only sharing (MOCN; see TS 23.251 [5] and TS 23.501 [7]), i.e. BTSs /
BSCs (respectively NodeBs / RNCs and eNodeBs) in a 2G Radio Access Network
(respectively a 3G Radio Access Network and an E-UTRA network) , and gNBs in a
5G NR network;
\- Gateway Core Network (GWCN; see TS 23.251 [5]), in which not only the Radio
Access Network elements are shared but also part or all of the Core Network
elements (there is no passive core network sharing).
The following figures depict the MOCN scenarios:
Figure 4.1-1: E-UTRAN MOCN network sharing scenario
Figure 4.1-2: NG-RAN MOCN Network Sharing with same cell identity broadcast
scenario
Figure 4.1-3 NG-RAN MOCN Network Sharing with multiple cell identity broadcast
scenario
In GWCN, besides sharing Radio Access Network nodes, the POPs also share Core
Network nodes (see TS 23.251 [5] -- clause 4.1).

## 5.4 High-level use cases
### 5.4.1 Fully pooled radio resources between two POPs
In this use case, cells are shared between POP A and POP B. As agreed by MOP
and POPs in their RAN sharing agreement:
\- Radio resources of the **S-RAN** are fully pooled between POP A and POP B;
UEs from POP A and POP B are served in the **S-RAN** in a first come first
served mode;
\- MOP is responsible for configuring the **S-RAN** accordingly.

Figure 5.4.1-1: Fully pooled radio resources between two POPs
### 5.4.2 Alarm raised on a shared cell (MOCN scenario)
In this use case, an alarm is raised on cell #1 of a shared (e)NodeB.
According to the RAN sharing agreement, the two POPs A and B are informed by
the MOP of the occurrence of this new alarm, as well as of the alarm clearance
by the MOP.
{width="4.330555555555556in" height="3.223611111111111in"}
Figure 5.4.2-1. Handling of an alarm raised on a shared cell (MOCN)
### 5.4.3 Single DM for managing S-RAN and POP own RAN
In this use case, Operator A is a POP and manages its own (non-shared) NEs
from its POP-RAN-DM while Operator B is both MOP and POP and manages **S-RAN**
and its own (non-shared) NEs from a single DM.
Operator B has several possibilities:
Example #1: configure, NE per NE, which POPs share the cells that it manages;
or
Example #2: define two separate groups of BTSs / (e)NodeBs:
\- one for the **S-RAN** NEs -- it shall then configure which POPs share the
cells of this group of BTSs / (e)NodeBs; and
\- one for its own (non-shared) RAN NEs.
{width="4.7243055555555555in" height="3.6284722222222223in"}
Figure 5.4.3-1: Single DM for managing both S-RAN and own RAN
### 5.4.4 Management of measurements for cross-operator accounting based on
data volume and QoS
The operator has made an agreement to act as a Master Operator, MOP, for
another operator (Participating Operator, POP) for RAN sharing. The agreement
is regulated in an SLA, which states the following: The QoS profile criteria
ARP-1 -- 10 and GBR-5 for QCI-4 and QCI-8 is supported. The DL QCI-4, GBR-5,
and ARP-1 -- 10 is charged by x Euro per Mbit, while UL QCI-4, GBR-5, and
ARP-1 -- 10 is charged by y Euro per Mbit. QCI-8 is charged z Euro per Mbit
regardless of QoS. For cross operator accounting purpose, the network needs to
provide data volume measurements with high reliability for the used QoS
profile criteria to the MOP.
### 5.4.5 Management support for the mixed deployment scenario of shared NG-
RAN network elements and non-shared NG-RAN network elements
In this use case, Operator A owns and manages a NG-RAN network. Operator A and
Operator B get a NG-RAN sharing agreement that Operator A will share some of
the NG-RAN network elements in its NG-RAN network with Operator B. Operator A
may need to configure the NG-RAN network to start the sharing of one currently
non-shared NG-RAN network element or stop the sharing of one currently shared
NG-RAN network element according to the requests from Operator B in the
future.
### 5.4.6 Radio resources partitioning between two POPs for the shared NG-RAN
In this use case, radio access network (i.e. one of multiple shared NG-RAN
network elements) are shared between two POPs (POP A identified by PLMN A, POP
B identified by PLMN B).
As agreed by POP A and POP B in their RAN sharing agreement:
\- Radio resources (e.g. PRB, RRC connection, DRB) of the shared radio access
network are partitioned for POP A and POP B, which means the radio resource
partitioning policies (e.g. RRMPolicyRatio) of the radio access network is
agreed for POP A and POP B. The detailed RRMPolicy definition for NG-RAN see
the clause 4.3.36 of TS 28.541 [8]. Following is one example of RRMPolicy for
corresponding POP A and POP B. In this example,
\- POP A has 20% dedicated radio resources, 30% prioritized resources and 50%
shared resources. In this case, there are 20% radio resources are dedicated
for the POP A, 30% radio resources are guaranteed for POPA when it needs to
use them, and 50% resources are shared with POP B.
\- POP B has 30% prioritized resources and 20% shared resources. In this case,
there are 30% radio resources are guaranteed for POP B when it needs to use
them, and 20% resources are shared with POP A.
{width="3.0083333333333333in" height="1.7375in"}
Figure 5.4.6-1 Example of structure RRMPolicy for radio access network
resource partitioning for POP A and POP B
Note: If the network slicing feature is supported, the RRMPolicy is defined
for each RRMPolicyMemberList which contains both PLMNId and S-NSSAI. In this
case, the RRMPolicy is defined in RRMPolicyMember (combination of PLMNId and
S-NSSAI) granularity.
MOP-NM (play the role of MnS consumer) obtains the radio resource partitioning
policies the shared radio access network based on above agreement, and sends
the radio resource partitioning policies to MOP-SR-DM (play the role of MnS
prodcuer) to configure the shared NG-RAN NEs. MOP-SR-DM derives the radio
resource partitioning policies for corresponding cells of each shared NG-RAN
NE and configures the corresponding shared NG-RAN NE with corresponding radio
resource partitioning policies for corresponding cells (see RRMPolicy defined
in TS 28.541[8] which is contained by RRMPolicyManagedEntity).
MOP-SR-DM monitors the radio usage resources measurement (e.g. UL/DL PRB used
for data traffic, RRC connections) for POP A and POP B, and send such radio
usage resources measurements to MnS consumer. Based on the radio resources
usage measurements and other information (e.g. service traffic requirements
changes) for POP A and POP B, the radio resources partitioning policies may be
updated based on the agreement between POP A and POP B. The MOP-NM requests
the MOP-SR-DM to reconfigure the updated radio resources partitioning policies
of the shared radio access network for corresponding POP A and POP B.

# 7 Management workflows for requirements for the management of the shared NG-
RAN NE(s) in MOCN network sharing scenario
## 7.1 Management of the shared NG-RAN NE(s) in MOCN network sharing scenario
with the same cell Identity broadcast
The NG-RAN MOCN Network Sharing with same cell identity broadcast scenario is
illustrated in Figure 4.1-2 and corresponding requirements is defined in
clause 5.1.4. This clause describes the workflows for the management of the
shared NG-RAN NE(s) in MOCN network sharing scenario with the same cell
identity broadcast.
In this workflow, the radio access network (i.e. one or multiple shared NG-RAN
NE(s)) is shared between two POPs (POP A identified by PLMN#1and POP B
identified by PLMN#2). Both MnS consumer and MnS producer for the management
of shared NG-RAN NE(s) belong to MOP.For the **Req-MOCN_SameCellId_Cfg-
CON-1:**
MnS consumer determines the individual EP_NgC MOI and EP_NgU MOI (see the
attributes of NgC and NgU in TS 28.541[X]) for each POP (POP A and POP B), and
requests MnS producer to create and configure EP_NgC MOI and EP_NgU MOI for
each POP.
MnS producer creates and configures the EP_NgC MOI and EP_NgU MOI for each POP
based on the requests from MnS consumer. The EP_NgC MOI and EP_NgU MOI are
name containe by same GNBCUCPFunction MOI and GNBCUUPFunction MOI which is
shared for different POPs.
For the **Req- MOCN_SameCellId_Cfg-CON-2** :
MnS consumer determines the attribute \"PLMNInfoList\" in NRCellDU MOI and
NRCellCU MOI (see the attribute definition in TS 28.541[X]), which includes
the PLMN#1 and PLMN#2, and requests MnS producer to configure NRCellDU MOI and
NRCellCU MOI with attribute \"PLMNInfoList\".
MnS producer configures the NG-RAN NE(s) (i.e. subtree of ManagedElement MOI)
based on the requests from MnS consumer, including configuring the NRCellDU
MOI and NRCellCU MOIwith attribute \"PLMNInfoList\" to include PLMN#1 and
PLMN#2.
For the **Req- MOCN_SameCellId_Per-CON-3:**
MnS producer collects the individual measurements for POP A and POP B in PLMN
granularity by utilizing PLMN granularity subcounter. For the concrete PLMN
granularity measurements, see TS 28.552[9].
MnS producer sends the individual measurements for POP A and POP B in PLMN
granularity to MnS consumer.
## 7.2 Management of the shared NG-RAN NE(s) in MOCN network sharing scenario
with the multiple cell Identity broadcast
The NG-RAN MOCN Network Sharing with multiple cell identity broadcast scenario
is illustrated in Figure 4.1-3 and corresponding requirements is defined in
clause 5.1.5. This clause describes the workflows for the management of the
shared NG-RAN NE(s) in MOCN network sharing scenario with the muliple cell
identity broadcast.
In this workflow, the radio access network (i.e. one or multiple shared NG-RAN
NE(s)) is shared between two POPs (POP A identified by PLMN#1and POP B
identified by PLMN#2). Both MnS consumer and MnS producer for the management
of shared NG-RAN NE(s) belong to MOP.
For the **Req-MOCN-MultiCellId-Cfg-CON-1:**
MnS consumer determines the individual EP_NgC MOI and EP_NgU MOI (see the
attributes of NgC and NgU in TS 28.541[8]) for each POP (POP A and POP B), and
requests MnS producer to create and configure EP_NgC MOI and EP_NgU MOI for
each POP.
MnS producer creates and configures the EP_NgC MOI and EP_NgU MOI for each POP
based on the requests from MnS consumer. The EP_NgC MOI and EP_NgU MOI are
name containe by corresponding POP\'s GNBCUCPFunction MOI and GNBCUUPFunction
MOI.
For the **Req-MOCN-MultiCellId-Cfg-CON-2**
MnS consumer determines the individual OperatorDU MOI and NROperatorCellDU MOI
(see the attributes of OperatorDU and NROperatorCellDU in TS 28.541[8]) for
each POP (POP A and POP B), and requests MnS producer to create and configure
OperatorDU MOI and NROperatorCellDU MOI for each POP.
MnS producer configures the NG-RAN NE(s) (i.e. subtree of ManagedElement)
based on the requests from MnS consumer, including creates and configures
OperatorDU and NROperatorCellDU MOI for each POP.
MnS consumer determines the individual NRCellCU MOI (see the attributes of
NRCellCU in TS 28.541[8]) for each POP (POP A and POP B), and requests MnS
producer to create and configure NRCellCU MOI for each POP.
MnS producer configures the NG-RAN NE(s) (i.e. subtree of ManagedElement)
based on the requests from MnS consumer, including creates and configures
NRCellCU MOI for each POP.
For the **Req-MOCN-MultiCellId-Cfg-CON-3**
MnS producer collects the individual measurements for POP A and POP B in PLMN
granularity by utilizing PLMN granularity subcounter or associated with
OperatorDU and NROperatorCellDU. For the concrete PLMN granularity
measurements, see TS 28.552[9].
MnS producer sends the individual measurements for POP A and POP B in PLMN
granularity to MnS consumer.
For the **Req-MOCN-MultiCellId-Cfg-CON-4** and **Req-MOCN-MultiCellId-Cfg-
CON-5**
MnS consumer determines the individual EP_F1C MOI and EP_F1U MOI (see
corresponding attributes in TS 28.541[8]) for each POP (POP A and POP B), and
requests MnS producer to create and configure these MOIs for each POP. In case
of common F1 intertface configuration, the values of the EP_F1C MOI and EP_F1U
MOI attributes (including localAddress and remoteAddress) contained by
different POP\'s OperatorDU MOI of the same GNBDUFunction MOI should be same.
MnS producer creates and configures the individual EP_F1C MOI and EP_F1U MOI
for each POP based on the requests from MnS consumer. The EP_F1C MOI and
EP_F1U MOI are name contained by corresponding POP\'s OperatorDU and
associated to it\'s own GNBCUCPFunction MOI and GNBCUUPFunction MOI.
For the **Req-MOCN-MultiCellId-Cfg-CON-6**
MnS consumer determines the NRCellRelation MOI(s) (see corresponding
attributes in TS 28.541[8]) for each POP (POP A and POP B), and requests MnS
producer to create and configure NRCellRelation MOI(s) for each POP.
MnS producer configures the NG-RAN NE(s) (i.e. subtree of ManagedElement)
based on the requests from MnS consumer, including creates and configures the
individual NRCellRelation MOI for each POP.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Network sharing agreement
Prior to any network sharing deployment, the MOP and the POPs have to agree on
legal, financial, technical and operational aspects. Among operational
aspects, the network sharing agreement captures the following (non-exhaustive
list):
\- Organizations involved (i.e. Operators) and their roles in the network
sharing deployment.
\- Exhaustive list of shared and unshared resources in the shared network.
\- Rights attached to each role (e.g. rights to configure network resources,
rights to receive alarms, etc.).
\- Duties attached to each role (e.g. obligation for the MOP to provide POPs
with monthly KPIs, etc.).
\- Delegations (if any) given by any organization to another organization.
\- Service Level Agreements (SLAs).
