# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:
32.341: \"File Transfer (FT) Integration Reference Point (IRP): Requirements\"
**32.342: \"File Transfer (FT) Integration Reference Point (IRP): Information
Service (IS)\"**
32.346: \"File Transfer (FT) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Solution Set
(SS) definitions\"
The present document is part of a TS-family which describe the requirements
and information model necessary for the Telecommunication Management (TM) of
3G systems. The TM principles and TM architecture are specified in 3GPP TS
32.101 [1] and 3GPP TS 32.102 [2].
Network Elements (NEs) under management, element managers as well as network
managers generate various management information stored in file format. This
IRP is addressing how these files are exchanged through Itf-N as well as
certain aspects of file management and maintenance. It is anticipated that all
management functions (e.g. PM, Call Trace, CM) as well as associated IRPs
making reuse of capabilities provided by this File Transfer IRP.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Information Service for the File Transfer
Integration Reference Point (FileTransferIRP) as it applies to the Itf-N.
The present document defines the semantics of operations (and their
parameters) visible across the Itf-N in a protocol and technology neutral way.
It does not define the syntax or encoding of the operations and their
parameters.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions, which through reference in this
text constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document in the same
Release as the present document.

## 6.2 Generic rules
\- **Rule 1:** each operation with at least one input parameter supports a
pre-condition valid_input_parameter which indicates that all input parameters
shall be valid with regards to their information type. Additionally, each such
operation supports an exception operation_failed_invalid_input_parameter which
is raised when pre-condition valid_input_parameter is false. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
\- **Rule 2:** each operation with at least one optional input parameter
supports a set of pre-conditions supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx where
\"xxx\" is the name of the optional input parameter and the preâ€‘condition
indicates that the operation supports the named optional input parameter.
Additionally, each such operation supports an exception
operation_failed_unsupported_optional_input_parameter_xxx which is raised when
(a) the pre-condition supported_optional_input_parameter_xxx is false and (b)
the named optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
\- **Rule 3:** each operation shall support a generic exception
operation_failed_internal_problem which is raised when an internal problem
occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception has the same
entry and exit state.

fileInfoList indicates "no file".
* * *
###### ## Annex A (normative): File Naming Convention
The following convention shall be applied for file naming:
\\\\\
[\][\\]
1) The managementData_type field is the type of the management data contained
in the file, the value of managementData_type field including
> \"PM\" for performance data files,
>
> \"CM\" for configuration files (except inventory),
>
> "IM" for inventory files,
>
> \"TE\" for test files,
>
> \"CT\" for call trace files,
>
> \"NL\" for notification log files,
>
> \"CG\" for charging files,
>
> \"OT\" for other files.
2) The file_ready_date field is of the form YYYYMMDD, where:
\- YYYY is the year in four-digit notation;
\- MM is the month in two digit notation (01 - 12);
\- DD is the day in two digit notation (01 - 31).
> The file_ready_date is the date when the file was last closed and made
> available for upload and the file content will not be changed.
3) The file_ready_time field is of the form HHMMshhmm, where:
\- HH is the two digit hour of the day (local time), based on 24 hour clock
(00 - 23);
\- MM is the two digit minute of the hour (local time, 00 - 59);
\- s is the sign of the local time differential from UTC (+ or -), in case the
time differential to UTC is 0 then the sign may be arbitrarily set to \"+\" or
\"-\";
\- hh is the two digit number of hours of the local time differential from UTC
(00 - 23);
\- mm is the two digit number of minutes of the local time differential from
UTC (00 - 59).
> The file_ready_time is the time when the file was last closed and made
> available for upload and the file content will not be changed.
4) To reduce length of the file name, the file_expiration_delta_time field
could be a delta time interval from file ready time. The unit is hour.
5) The specificIRP_extension field is used for other IRPs to extend the extra
file naming convention which is not covered by the basic file naming
convention defined in FileTransferIRP.
6) The RC parameter is a running count, starting with the value of \"1\", and
shall be appended only if the filename is not unique, i.e. more than one file
is generated and all other parameters of the file name are identical.
7) The separator field is \"_-_\", which is an underscore character (_),
followed by a minus character (-), followed by an underscore character (_).
