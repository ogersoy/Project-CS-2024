# Introduction
The present document has been prepared by the 3GPP Task Force, and gives a
detailed specification of the 3GPP integrity algorithm GIA4.
The present document is the third of three, which between them form the entire
specification of the 3GPP Integrity Algorithm GIA4:
\- **3GPP TS 55.241: \"3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical
Specification Group Services and System Aspects; Specification of the GIA4
integrity algorithms for GPRS; GIA4 specification\".**
\- 3GPP TS 55.242: \"3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical
Specification Group Services and System Aspects; Specification of the GIA4
**integrity** algorithms for GPRS; Implementers\' test data\".
**\- 3GPP TS 55.243: \"3rd Generation Partnership Project; Technical
Specification Group Services and System Aspects; Specification of the GIA4
integrity algorithms for GPRS; Design conformance test data\".**
# 1 Scope
The present document defines the Design conformance test data for the 3GPP
integrity algorithm GIA4.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 3 Definitions and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
## 3.2 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR
21.905 [1] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same abbreviation, if
any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
# 4 Introductory information
## 4.1 Introduction
The integrity algorithm GIA4 computes a 32-bit MAC (Message Authentication
Code) of a given input message using integrity key KI128. The approach adopted
uses KASUMI [2] in a form of CBC-MAC mode.
## 4.2 Notation
### 4.2.1 Radix
The prefix \"0x\" is used to indicate hexadecimal numbers.
### 4.2.2 Conventions
The assignment operator \"=\", is used as in several programming languages. So
the following:
\ = \
means that \ assumes the value that \ had before
the assignment took place. For instance:
_x_ = _x_ \+ _y_ \+ 3
means:
(new value of _x_) becomes (old value of _x_) + (old value of _y_) + 3.
### 4.2.3 Bit/Byte ordering
All data variables in the present document are presented with the most
significant bit (or byte) on the left hand side and the least significant bit
(or byte) on the right hand side. Where a variable is broken down into a
number of sub-strings, the left most (most significant) sub-string is numbered
0, the next most significant is numbered 1 and so on through to the least
significant.
For example an n-bit MESSAGE is subdivided into 64-bit substrings
MB~0~,MB~1~...MB~i~ so for the following message:
0x0123456789ABCDEFFEDCBA987654321086545381AB594FC28786404C50A37...
MB~0~ = 0x0123456789ABCDEF\ MB~1~ **=** 0xFEDCBA9876543210\ MB~2~ =
0x86545381AB594FC2\ MB~3~ = 0x8786404C50A37...
In binary this would be:
000000010010001101000101011001111000100110101011110011011110111111111110...
with
MB~0~ = 0000000100100011010001010110011110001001101010111100110111101111\
MB~1~ = 1111111011011100101110101001100001110110010101000011001000010000\
MB~2~ = 1000011001010100010100111000000110101011010110010100111111000010\
MB~3~ = 1000011110000110010000000100110001010000101000110111...
## 4.3 List of variables
A, B are 64-bit registers that are used within the function to hold
intermediate values.
BLOCKS an integer variable indicating the number of successive applications of
KASUMI that need to be performed.
CONSTANT-F a 32-bit parameter which is constant for any given FRAMETYPE input.
DIRECTION a 1-bit input indicating the direction of transmission (uplink or
downlink).
FRAMETYPE an 8-bit input to the function indicating the type of frame to be
protected.
INPUT-I a 32-bit time variant input to the function.
KI128 the 128-bit integrity key.
KM a 128-bit constant that is used to modify a key.
M an input to the function which specifies the number of octets of message to
be MAC\'d (1-65536).
MAC the 32-bit message authentication code (MAC) produced by the function.
MESSAGE the input octet stream of length M octets that is to be processed by
the function.
PS is the input padded string processed by the function.
