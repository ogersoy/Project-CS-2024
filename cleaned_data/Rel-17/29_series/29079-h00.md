# 1 Scope
The present document defines optional Optimal Media Routeing (OMR) procedures
that can be applied by entities in the IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) that
control media resources and are capable of manipulating the Session
Description Protocol (SDP) as defined by IETF RFC 4566 [6].
The OMR procedures in the present specification relate to the handling of OMR-
specific SDP attributes that are documented in TS 24.229 [4]. The OMR
procedures use SDP offer/answer related procedures in IETF RFC 3264 [5] and in
3GPP TS 24.229 [4] in a backward-compatible manner.
The 3GPP network architecture, including the configuration and network
entities of the IMS, is defined in 3GPP TS 23.002 [2]. The Stage 2 of the IMS
is defined 3GPP TS 23.228 [3]. Annex Q of 3GPP TS 23.228 [3] documents the
architecture and call flows for OMR.
The OMR procedures in this document are applicable to the following IMS
entities that perform as an IMS-ALG or UA according to 3GPP TS 24.229 [4] and
that control media resources:
\- an IBCF acting as an IMS-ALG;
\- a P-CSCF acting as IMS-ALG;
\- an AS acting as B2BUA and adapting IMS-ALG procedures to control an MRF;
\- an AS acting as B2BUA and adapting UA procedures to control an MRF; and
\- an MGCF acting as UA.
NOTE 1: An AS acting as B2BUA to perform application functions such as
conferencing or announcements will normally perform separate originating and
terminating UA procedures, treating the media resource as an endpoint. An AS
acting as B2BUA offering transcoding options will typically follow IMS-ALG
procedures.
NOTE 2: The controlled media resource can be a TrGW, IMS-AGW, MRF, or a media
function of the entity performing OMR.
The OMR procedures are not applicable for an UE.

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
### 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
TR 21.905 [1], and the following apply. A term defined in the present document
takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in TR 21.905
[1].
**Codec** : A media configuration for a media line in SDP that is specified by
one or more formats in the format list of the m-line, by one or more preferred
configurations (pcfg) associated with the media line, or by a combination of
both.
**Codec Change** : Any modification to the media configurations for the media
line in the format list or the list of preferred configurations.
**Codec List** : Either the format list of the m-line, or a combination of all
the preferred configurations and the format list for the media line.
**Connected IP realm: Compared to a reference IP realm, a connected IP realm
is one identified with a different unique name where all IP endpoints in the
two IP realms are mutually reachable (accessible) by means of IP routeing
without address translation. Interconnection between the IP realms may be via
direct link, via IP tunnel through other networks, via IP routeing through
intermediate networks, or via any other method of internetworking as long as
their IP endpoints are mutually reachable. The property of connectedness is
symmetric but not necessarily transitive. In particular, two IP realms
connected to a reference IP realm are not necessarily themselves connected.**
**Incoming termination:** The termination at an MR in the direction from where
an incoming SDP offer is being received at the IMS-ALG that is controlling the
MR.
**IP realm** : A collection of IP endpoints identified by a unique name, where
all IP endpoints are mutually reachable by means of IP routeing without
address translation.
**Media resource:** An IMS Network entity that provides resources to process
media streams and is controlled by an entity applying OMR procedures. A TrGW,
BGW, MRF, or a function internal to the entity performing OMR can be a media
resource.
**Loopback routeing:** A method of routeing a SIP request back to the visited
network for local breakout according to the Roaming Architecture for Voice
over IMS with Local Breakout as specified in TS 24.229 [4].
**Outgoing termination:** The termination at an MR in the direction towards
where an outgoing SDP offer is being sent at the IMS-ALG that is controlling
the MR.
**Second SDP offer/answer:** An SDP offer/answer transaction initiated by any
of the involved IMS-ALGs during session establishment towards the initial SDP
answerer upon reception of the initial SDP answer and MR resources are
required (e.g. when an intermediate IMS-ALG performs proactive transcoding
without resource reservation) or not required (e.g. when MR resources are
reserved for the purpose of transcoding and transcoding is not required). The
second SDP offer is not an end-to-end negotiation and is handled as the
initial SDP offer.
**Subsequent SDP offer/answer:** An end-to-end SDP offer/answer transaction
initiated after a completed initial or second SDP offer/answer transaction.
The subsequent SDP offer contains no OMR specific attributes.
## 3.2 Symbols
For the purposes of the present document, the following symbols apply:
Ix Reference Point between IBCF and TrGW
Iq Reference Point between the P-CSCF and the IMS Access Gateway
## 3.3 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in TR 21.905
[1], in TS 23.228 [3] and the following apply. An abbreviation defined in the
present document takes precedence over the definition of the same
abbreviation, if any, in TR 21.905 [1] or in TS 23.228 [3].

UA User Agent
# 4 General
The procedures in clause 5, clause 6, clause 7 and clause 8 shall apply
separately to each media line with non-zero port value in each SDP message,
and shall apply separately to each SDP offer/answer transaction. In the
presence of forking of a SIP INVITE request that includes an SDP offer, the
OMR procedures for handling of the SDP offer apply once for all forked
dialogs, and the OMR procedures for handling of the corresponding SDP answer
apply independently to each dialog. Entities supporting OMR use the OMR-
specific SDP extension attributes defined in TS 24.229 [4].
OMR builds on the ALG NAT traversal model and is not consistent with ICE.
OMR does not modify the SIP signalling route path and usually does not modify
the flow of SIP messages except in some cases when transcoding options are
offered.
# 5 Common SDP Procedures
## 5.1 General
The IMS-ALG or UA using the OMR procedures in clause 6 or clause 7,
respectively, shall additionally use the procedures in this clause when
manipulating SDP.
## 5.2 Encapsulation of previous SDP information
### 5.2.1 Media level information
If an IMS-ALG forwards an SDP offer and for a given media line:
\- adds or removes offered format(s);
\- modifies the transport protocol;
\- adds or removes other corresponding media level SDP attribute(s) than
\"visited-realm\", \"secondary-realm\", \"omr-codecs\", \"omr-m-att\", \"omr-
s-att\", \"omr-m-bw\", \"omr-s-bw\", \"omr-s-cksum\" or \"omr-m-cksum\"
attributes;
\- modifies the value of other corresponding media level SDP attribute(s) than
\"visited-realm\", \"secondary-realm\", \"omr-codecs\", \"omr-m-att\", \"omr-
s-att\", \"omr-m-bw\", \"omr-s-bw\", \"omr-s-cksum\" or \"omr-m-cksum\"
attributes;
\- adds or removes corresponding media level SDP bandwidth line(s); or
\- modifies the value of corresponding media level SDP bandwidth line(s),
then the IMS-ALG shall apply the procedures below to encapsulate all media
level information of the corresponding media line.
The IMS ALG shall encapsulate the received transport protocol and format list
of the corresponding media line within an \"omr-codecs\" attribute and add
this attribute as a media level attribute for the corresponding media line.
The IMS ALG shall encapsulate each received attribute of the corresponding
media line within an \"omr-m-att\" attribute and add this attribute as a media
level attribute for the corresponding media line.
The IMS ALG shall encapsulate each received bandwidth line of the
corresponding media line within an \"omr-m-bw\" attribute and add this
attribute as media level attribute for the corresponding media line.
If the IMS-ALG received any visited-realm instances in the SDP offer, the IMS-
ALG shall supply the instance number one above the highest instance number in
the received SDP offer as instance number within the \"omr-codecs\", the
\"omr-m-att\" and \"omr-m-bw\" attribute(s). Otherwise the IMS-ALG shall
supply the instance number 2.
### 5.2.2 Session level information
If an IMS-ALG forwards an SDP offer and:
\- encapsulated any media level information according to the conditions in
clause 5.2.1;
\- adds or removes any session level SDP attribute(s);
\- modifies the value of any session level SDP attribute(s);
\- adds or removes session level SDP bandwidth line(s); or
\- modifies the value of session level SDP bandwidth line(s),
then the IMS-ALG shall apply the procedures below to encapsulate all session
level information.
The IMS ALG shall encapsulate each received session-level attribute within an
\"omr-s-att\" attribute and add this attribute as a media level attribute for
every media line.
The IMS ALG shall encapsulate each received session-level bandwidth line
within an \"omr-s-bw\" attribute and add this attribute as a media level
attribute for every media line.
If the IMS-ALG received any visited-realm instances in the SDP offer, the IMS-
ALG shall supply the instance number one above the highest instance number in
the received SDP offer as instance number within the \"omr-s-att\" and \"omr-
s-bw\" attribute(s). Otherwise the IMS-ALG shall supply the instance number 2.
NOTE 1: The instance number 1 is reserved for the incoming SDP offer when it
contains no visited-realm instance.
NOTE 2: The remaining SDP session level attributes (e.g., the \"o\" line) are
not modified by the OMR procedures.
## 5.3 Determination of codec related SDP information associated to a previous
realm instance
When deciding to bypass some previous MR, an IMS-ALG needs to determine the
SDP information which is applicable together with the visited-realm instance
or secondary-realm instance that the IMS selects for the bypass (see clause
6.1). The IMS-ALG will include that SDP information in a forwarded SDP offer
or perform additional modifications on top of it, e.g., to offer transcoding
at its own MR.
To determine the codec related SDP information associated to that previous
realm instance for the media line, the IMS-ALG shall use the procedures below.
1) If any \"omr-codecs\", \"omr-m-att\", or \"omr-m-bw\" attributes with a
higher instance number than the previous visited-realm instance or secondary-
realm instance exist for a media line, the IMS-ALG shall consider the
information within the set of attributes with the lowest instance number among
those as follows:
\- the IMS-ALG shall replace the transport format and media formats in the
media line with the transport format and media formats from the \"omr-codecs\"
attribute with this instance number;
\- the IMS-ALG shall retain all the \"visited-realm\", \"secondary-realm\",
\"omr-s-cksum\", \"omr-m-cksum\", \"omr-codecs\", \"omr-m-att\", \"omr-s-
att\", \"omr-m-bw\" and \"omr-s-bw\" attributes for the media line and replace
all other SDP a-line(s) for the media line with the attributes extracted from
the \"omr-m-att\" attribute(s) with this instance number; and
NOTE 1: This procedure only describes update to codec related SDP information.
Clauses 6 and 7 describe the corresponding modifications to the OMR related
attributes.
\- the IMS-ALG shall replace the SDP b-line(s) for the media line with the
b-line(s) extracted from the \"omr-m-bw\" attributes with this instance
number.
> Otherwise, the IMS-ALG shall use the SDP a-lines, b-lines, transport format
> and list of media formats of the corresponding media line.
2) If any \"omr-s-att\" or \"omr-s-bw\" attributes with a higher instance
number than the previous visited-realm instance or secondary-realm instance
exist, the IMS-ALG shall consider the information within the set of attributes
with the lowest instance number among those as follows:
\- If the same attributes are provided for each media line, the IMS ALG shall
replace all session-level SDP a-lines and b-lines with the encapsulated
attributes and bandwidth within the \"omr-s-att\" attributes and \"omr-s-bw\"
attributes of one media line as session level attributes and bandwidth, and
may apply attribute or bandwidth modifier specific logic to verify and
possibly adjust the session-level information from \"omr-s-att\" and \"omr-s-
bw\" attributes and media level information determined as described above;
NOTE 2: Verification helps in the possible event of splitting media lines by
intermediate entities.
\- otherwise the IMS-ALG shall apply attribute or bandwidth modifier specific
logic to derive appropriate session-level information from \"omr-s-att\" and
\"omr-s-bw\" attributes and media level information determined as described
above, or delete all those encapsulated attributes and all session-level SDP
a-lines and b-lines.
NOTE 3: In the possible event of merging of media lines by intermediate
entities, there may be inconsistencies in the encapsulated session level
a-lines and/or b-lines.
3) Otherwise, the IMS-ALG shall use the session-level SDP a-lines and b-lines.
For an SDP offer with several media lines, an IMS-ALG applies the OMR
algorithm separately for each media line and can select different optimised
paths. In such a case, the session-level attributes and bandwidth information
determined by the above algorithm can differ for different optimised paths,
depending on the selected visited-realm instance or secondary-realm instance
for each media line. The IMS-ALG may then apply attribute or bandwidth
modifier specific logic to determine the appropriate session-level information
or discard conflicting information. An IMS-ALG may also apply a policy not to
choose different optimised paths for different media to avoid such conflicts.
NOTE 4: Upon receiving an SDP offer and validating the OMR attributes in the
SDP offer, but before making any codec changes to the SDP offer, the IMS-ALG
supporting OMR can delete any unsupported attributes from the SDP offer, e.g.,
attributes associated with capability negotiation. The IMS-ALG supporting OMR
can also delete any ignored attributes, e.g., due to lack of support of a
required extension to capability negotiation, as determined by the creq
attribute defined in IETF RFC 5939 [20].
## 5.4 Modifying codec related information
### 5.4.1 Modifying the format list
When forwarding an SDP offer, the IMS-ALG should not make changes to the
attributes associated with a format remaining in the format list of the m-line
that require the allocation of an MR to translate the media payload between
the format described by the received SDP offer and the format described by the
forwarded SDP offer.
NOTE 1: Examples include changing between AMR octet-aligned and bandwidth-
efficient modes, and incompatible AMR mode-sets.
To add a codec to the format list of the m-line in the SDP offer to be
forwarded, the IMS-ALG shall either:
\- add a media format to the format list on the media line that is different
from any format in the \"omr-codecs\" attributes for the media line, along
with any necessary media attributes, or
\- re-insert a format from an \"omr-codecs\" attribute for the media line that
is not in the current format list, along with the corresponding attributes for
the format with the same instance number in \"omr-m-att\" attributes.
NOTE 2: This procedure avoids the potential need to retain a media resource to
perform format mapping when performing proactive transcoding, if the bypass
decision is based on the SDP answer.
### 5.4.2 Modifying preferred configurations
When forwarding an SDP offer, the IMS-ALG supporting SDP capability
negotiation shall only make a change to a preferred configuration in the
incoming SDP offer without changing the configuration number if the change is
backward compatible. A backward compatible change is one that, if it is
selected as the actual configuration, does not require the allocation of an MR
to translate the media payload between the format described by the received
SDP offer and the format described by the forwarded SDP offer, and does not
require modification of the actual configuration number when forwarding the
SDP answer. This applies to the preferred configuration (pcfg) itself and any
capabilities referenced in the pcfg.
NOTE 1: It is recommended that an IMS-ALG not make any codec list changes to
an SDP offer that includes any mandatory session capabilities unless it also
deletes all attributes associated with capability negotiation as if capability
negotiation were not supported.
To make any of the following changes to a preferred configuration in the SDP
offer:
\- to change the priority of the preferred configuration with respect to
others;
\- to allow insertion of a new preferred configurations with higher priority;
\- to allow reassignment of another preferred configuration to a higher
priority; or
\- to make any other changes to a preferred configuration that are not
backward compatible and cannot be realized by inserting a new preferred
configuration,
the IMS-ALG shall reassign the configuration number to one unused in the SDP
offer or in any of the encapsulated information for the media line in the SDP
offer and add any necessary capability attributes.
NOTE 2: Changing the priority of a codec or preferred configuration increases
the possibility of introducing a transcoding function that is not otherwise
needed. Normally new or changed preferred configurations are assigned with
higher configuration numbers (of lower priority) than existing preferred
configurations.
When forwarding an SDP offer, the IMS-ALG supporting SDP capability
negotiation shall not change any existing SDP capneg capability attributes,
but may insert additional capability attributes.
The IMS-ALG may delete a preferred configuration from the SDP offer. However,
the IMS-ALG shall not delete any unreferenced capability attributes.
If the IMS-ALG desires to add a preferred configuration, it should search for
an equivalent or backward compatible preferred configuration within the
encapsulated codec related information. If it finds such a suitable preferred
configuration, the IMS-ALG should reuse the configuration number from the
encapsulated preferred configuration if the resulting priority with respect to
other preferred configurations is acceptable.
To add a new preferred configuration to the media line of the SDP offer that
is different from and not backward compatible with any pcfg attribute in
encapsulated codec information for the media line, the IMS-ALG shall allocate
a new configuration number for the new preferred configuration with a
configuration number unused by any other preferred configuration within the
SDP offer or within the encapsulated codec related information.
## 5.5 Additional handling for SDP answer with actual configuration
In clause 6.2.2 and clause 6.2.8 step 4), if the media line in the initial or
second SDP answer includes an actual configuration, the IMS-ALG should perform
the following procedure to determine if the codecs in the initial or second
SDP answer are supported by a previous version of the received initial or
second SDP offer:
The IMS-ALG should compare the actual configuration with SDP capneg preferred
configurations in encapsulated codec related information to determine if
previous realm instances are associated with matching codec related
information. The actual configuration matches a preferred configuration:
\- if the preferred configuration has the same configuration number as the
actual configuration; or
\- if the capabilities listed in the actual configuration match the
capabilities available in the preferred configuration in the initial or second
SDP offer.
NOTE: An IMS-ALG can choose not to compare the SDP capneg actual configuration
with encapsulated preferred configurations, or only to compare configuration
numbers, but this may lead to a failure to find opportunities to bypass
previous realm instances. However, SDP capneg procedures recommend that the
offerer performs a second offer/answer transaction where the actual
configuration is offered in normal SDP. Missed opportunities to bypass
previous realm instances could still be found during this second offer/answer
transaction.
If the IMS-ALG selected a preferred configuration with a different
configuration number than the actual configuration for bypassing a previous
realm, the IMS-ALG shall change the capability number of the actual
configuration to equal the capability number of the matching preferred
configuration before forwarding the initial or second SDP answer.
## 5.6 Procedures specific to OMR attributes
### 5.6.1 General
This clause describes additional procedures specific to SDP attributes
associated with OMR specified in TS 24.229 [4], clause 7.5.3.
### 5.6.2 instance-number
When creating a new visited-realm instance for a media line in an SDP offer,
the IMS-ALG shall assign an instance-number value for the instance that is
\"1\" higher than the highest existing instance-number value for any visited-
realm attribute for any media line in the received SDP offer, starting with
the value \"1\" if there are no such attributes in the SDP offer. If the
IMSâ€‘ALG adds visited-realm instances for several media lines, the IMSâ€‘ALG
shall use the same instance-number. If the IMSâ€‘ALG adds a \"secondary-realm\"
SDP attribute for a media line in the SDP offer the IMS-ALG shall assign the
same instance-number value as assigned to the \"visited-realm\" SDP attribute.
A UA creating a visited-realm instance for a media line in an SDP offer shall
assign an instance-number value \"1\" for the instance. If the UA adds a
\"secondary-realm\" SDP attribute for a media line in the SDP offer the UA
shall assign the instance-number value \"1\" for a secondary-realm instance.
### 5.6.3 Session and media checksum calculation
An IMS ALG or a UA supporting OMR shall determine a session level checksum and
a media level checksum for each media line containing a \"visited-realm\" SDP
attribute or a \"secondary-realm\" SDP attribute in an SDP offer.
NOTE: A session level checksum and a media level checksum calculation is not
performed for an SDP answer containing media line with a \"visited-realm\" SDP
attribute or a \"secondary-realm\" SDP attribute.
The session level checksum shall be calculated by summing all the hex values
of the individual ASCII characters (excluding all white space) of the \"b\"
and \"a\" session level lines. The media level checksum shall be calculated by
summing all the hex values of the individual ASCII characters (excluding all
white space) of the \"m\", \"b\", and \"a\" media level lines including
attributes specific to OMR but excluding the session and media level checksum
attribute lines themselves.
When there are no \"b\" or \"a\" session level lines to calculate the session
level checksum, the session level checksum is set to \"0\".
## 5.7 Roaming architecture for voice over IMS with local breakout
In a network supporting the roaming architecture for voice over IMS with local
breakout OMR related policies may depend on the identification of a roaming
architecture for voice over IMS with local breakout session.
An IBCF acting as an IMS-ALG can identify a session to be a roaming
architecture for voice over IMS with local breakout session as specified in TS
24.229 [4], clause 5.10.9.
## 5.8 II-NNI traversal scenario
OMR related policies can depend on the II-NNI traversal scenario type.
An IBCF acting as an IMS-ALG can identify the II-NNI traversal scenario type
as specified in TS 24.229 [4].
# 6 IMS-ALG procedures
## 6.1 IMS-ALG handling of initial SDP offer
### 6.1.1 General
Upon receiving an initial SDP offer, the IMS-ALG supporting OMR shall apply
the procedures in the following clauses for each media line with non-zero port
value.
Upon receiving a second SDP offer that includes OMR attributes for some media
lines, the IMS-ALG supporting OMR shall apply the procedures in the following
clauses for each media line with non-zero port value and OMR attributes.
NOTE: An example of a second SDP offer/answer transaction is when any of the
IMS-ALGs performs proactive transcoding without resource reservation or
removes media resources when transcoding is no longer required. See clauses
6.2.2 and 6.2.3.
After the completion of an initial SDP offer/answer transaction and when
receiving an SDP offer without OMR attributes for a media line, the IMS-ALG
supporting OMR shall apply the procedures for subsequent SDP offer/answer
transaction in clause 8 for that media line.
### 6.1.2 Validating the received SDP offer
If any of the following conditions are true:
1) the received SDP offer includes any OMR attributes for the media line, but
no visited-realm instance;
2) the connection-address and port information in the visited-realm instance
with the highest value of instance-number for the media line does not match
the connection address and port information for the media line; or
3) one of the following conditions are true:
\- the \"omr-m-cksum\" attribute does not match the checksum value computed
for the media line as described in clause 5.6.3; or
\- based on local policy, if the \"omr-m-cksum\" attribute matches the
computed media line checksum, but the \"omr-s-cksum\" attribute does not match
the checksum value computed for the session level lines as described in clause
5.6.3,
then the IMS-ALG shall remove all OMR attributes associated with the media
line from the received SDP offer and use the modified SDP offer as the
received SDP offer in the procedures in the following clauses.
### 6.1.3 Deciding whether to allocate a primary local MR and if any previous
MR can be bypassed
The IMS-ALG considers information in the received SDP offer and applies local
policy to decide whether to allocate a primary local MR and if it is to bypass
any previous MRs.
NOTE: An IMS-ALG can revise these decisions when receiving the SDP answer,
applying procedures in clause 6.2.
The IMS ALG shall perform the following steps:
0) If the connection address for the media line in the received SDP offer is
the unspecified address, then the IMS-ALG should:
a) select to not allocate a primary local MR (regardless of local policy), and
to not bypass any previous MRs;
b) convert the unspecified address in the connection address for the media
line in the received SDP offer to the addrtype of the outgoing IP realm, if
necessary;
c) if subsequently choosing to perform proactive transcoding in clause 6.1.7,
then select to perform proactive transcoding without resource reservation
(regardless of local policy);
d) select to not add secondary-realm instances to the modified SDP offer when
performing the procedure in clause 6.1.8 (regardless of local policy); and
e) skip to step 6),
1) If all of the following conditions apply:
a) local policy does not require the allocation of an MR for any non-OMR
related reason (e.g. for hosted NAPT traversal on the incoming signalling
path, or for legal interception; and
b) the IP realm, nettype and addrtype for the outgoing signalling path is the
same as the IP realm, nettype and addrtype associated with a visited-realm or
secondary-realm instance for the media line
\- such that the instance has an instance-number value _i_ that is less than
the highest instance-number value _n_ associated with the media line in the
received SDP offer; and
\- such that the instance _i_ is associated with a codec list, determined
using the procedures in clause 5.3, which includes all codecs required by
local policy, unless the IMS-ALG has a policy to offer the missing codecs
proactively without reserving an MR,
> then the IMS-ALG shall store an indication that the allocation of a primary
> local MR is not required and shall store the realm instances with instance-
> number greater than _i_ , which are associated with MRs that can be bypassed
> without allocating a primary local MR.
2) If the following condition applies:
a) the IMS-ALG controls an MR with access to an IP realm or connected IP
realm, nettype and addrtype associated with a visited-realm or secondary-realm
instance for the media line
\- such that the instance has an instance-number value _j_ that is less than
the highest instance-number value _n_ associated with the media line in the
received SDP offer; and
\- such that the instance _j_ is associated with a codec list, determined
using the procedures in clause 5.3, which includes all codecs required by
local policy, unless such codecs are provided at a local MR via transcoding,
> then the IMS-ALG shall store the realm instances with instance-number
> greater than _j_ , which are associated with MRs that can be bypassed when
> allocating a primary local MR.
3) If all of the following conditions apply:
a) the condition in step 1) does not apply;
b) the IP realm, nettype and addrtype for the outgoing signalling path is the
same as the IP realm, nettype and addrtype for the incoming signalling path;
c) the codec list in the received SDP offer, determined from the SDP m-line
and associated non-OMR attribute lines, includes all codecs required by local
policy, unless the IMS-ALG has a policy to offer the missing codecs
proactively without reserving an MR; and
d) local policy does not require the allocation of an MR for any non-OMR
related reason (e.g. for hosted NAPT traversal on the incoming signalling
path, or for legal interception),
> then the IMS-ALG shall store an indication that the allocation of a primary
> local MR is not required and that no MRs can be bypassed when no primary
> local MR is allocated.
4) If an indication that the allocation of a primary local MR is not required
has been stored in steps 1) or 3),
\- then the IMS-ALG shall compare the realm instances (and MRs) that can be
bypassed with or without allocation of a primary local MR, as determined in
steps 1), 2) and 3), and shall use local policy to select whether to allocate
a primary local MR,
\- else the IMS-ALG shall select to allocate a primary local MR,
NOTE: Usually the decision is made based on which choice retains the smallest
total number of MRs in the media path, but local policy may apply other
criteria.
5) If the IMS-ALG selected in step 4) to allocate a primary local MR, then the
IMS-ALG shall:
\- if one or more realm instances can be bypassed when allocating a primary
local MR, then store instance-number value _k_ =_j_ and apply the procedures
in clause 6.1.4 to bypass previous MRs, else apply the procedures in clause
6.1.5 to not bypass previous MRs; and
\- apply the procedures in clause 6.1.6 to allocate a primary local MR.
6) If the IMS-ALG selected in step 4) to not allocate a primary local MR, then
the IMS-ALG shall:
\- if one or more realm instances can be bypassed when not allocating a
primary local MR, then store instance-number value _k_ =_i_ and apply the
procedures in clause 6.1.4 to bypass previous MRs, else apply the procedures
in clause 6.1.5 to not bypass previous MRs; and
\- apply the procedures in clause 6.1.7 to not allocate a primary local MR.
### 6.1.4 Bypassing previous MRs
If the IMS-ALG decides (applying the criteria in clauses 6.1.3, 6.2.2, 6.2.3
or 6.2.8) to bypass a previous MR, the IMS-ALG shall:
1) use the connection address and port information from the selected instance
_k_ for the media line in the received SDP offer as incoming connection
address and incoming port information for the media line in the subsequent
steps;
2) reconstruct the associated codec information for the media line in the
received SDP offer from the selected instance _k_ as described in clause 5.3,
and use that codec information as incoming codec information in the subsequent
steps; and
3) delete every OMR attribute for the media line with instance-number value
higher than _k_.
### 6.1.5 Bypassing no previous MRs
If the IMS-ALG decides (applying the criteria in clauses 6.1.3, 6.2.2 or
6.2.3) not to bypass any previous MR, the IMS-ALG shall:
1) use the connection-address from the SDP c-line in the received SDP offer as
incoming connection-address in subsequent steps;
2) use the port information from the SDP m-line in the received SDP offer as
incoming port information in subsequent steps; and
3) use the codec information from the SDP m-line and associated non-OMR
attribute lines in the received SDP offer as incoming codec information in the
subsequent steps.
### 6.1.6 Allocating a primary local MR
**I** f the IMS-ALG decides (applying the criteria in clauses 6.1.3 or 6.2.3)
to allocate a local MR, the IMS-ALG shall:
1) if no MR context has been allocated due to a previous SDP offer-answer
exchange, allocate an MR context with access to the IP realms, nettypes and
addrtypes associated with the incoming connection address and port information
determined in clause 6.1.4 or 6.1.5, and the outgoing signalling path,
respectively applying procedures as described in clause 6.3;
2) if the IMS-ALG is not performing hosted NAPT traversal on the incoming
side, then insert the incoming connection address and incoming port
information for the media line, as determined in clause 6.1.4 or 6.1.5, into
the remote connection address and port information for the incoming
termination on the MR;
3) if the IMS-ALG is performing hosted NAPT traversal on the incoming side,
then discover the remote connection address and port information for the
incoming termination on the MR using latching or other unspecified technique;
4) if codec information is to be provided to the allocated MR on the incoming
termination, provide to the MR the incoming codec information as determined in
clause 6.1.4 or 6.1.5;
NOTE: The IMS-ALG can defer the allocation of an MR termination at the
incoming side and the related procedures in steps 1) to 4) until it processes
the SDP answer.
5) if the IMS-ALG requires according to local policy that its MR remain in the
media path for reasons unrelated to OMR, remove all OMR specific attributes
from the modified SDP offer;
6) if there is no visited-realm instance associated with the connection
address and port information for the media line in the received (and possibly
modified) SDP offer, and there is no local policy prohibiting removal of the
allocated MR, then construct and add this visited-realm instance to the
modified SDP offer;
7) replace the connection address and port information for the media line in
the modified SDP offer with the connection address and port information from
the MR termination on the outgoing side;
8) make any codec changes to incoming codec information, as determined in
clause 6.1.4 or 6.1.5, according to local policy, taking into account the
procedures in clause 5.4, and insert the changed codec information into the
SDP m-line and associated attribute lines of the modified SDP offer;
9) if codec information is to be provided to the allocated MR for the outgoing
termination, provide to the MR the modified codec information derived in step
8); and
10) add to the modified SDP offer a visited-realm instance for the IP realm
associated with the connection address and port information for the media line
in the modified SDP offer, including the incoming codec information encoded
according to clause 5.2 if any codec changes were inserted in step 8).
### 6.1.7 Allocating no primary local MR
**I** f the IMS-ALG decides (applying the criteria in clauses 6.1.3 or 6.2.2)
not to allocate a primary local MR, the IMS-ALG shall:
1) decide according to local policy if the IMS-ALG performs any codec changes
to the incoming codec information, as determined in clause 6.1.4 or 6.1.5,
without allocating an MR (i.e., for proactive transcoding without resource
reservation);
NOTE: The IMS-ALG can only make codec changes if the available SIP signalling
allows the IMS-ALG to initiate a 2^nd^ SDP offer/answer transaction if
necessary to allocate a transcoding MR after receipt of the SDP answer, as
described in clause 6.2.3.
2) if the IMS-ALG decided in step 1) to perform any codec changes, then
a) if there is no visited-realm instance associated with the connection
address and port information for the media line in the received SDP offer,
then construct and add this visited-realm instance;
b) make the codec changes to incoming codec information according to local
policy, taking into account the procedures in clause 5.4, and insert the
changed codec information into the SDP m-line and associated attribute lines
of the modified SDP offer; and
c) add to the modified SDP offer a visited-realm instance with the same IP
realm, connection address and port information as the previous visited-realm
instance (after a possible execution of step 3 in clause 6.1.4 for the media
line, including the incoming codec information encoded according to clause
5.2),
3) if the IMS-ALG decided in step 1) not to perform any codec changes, then
a) insert the incoming codec information, determined in clause 6.1.4 or 6.1.5
into the SDP m-line and associated attribute lines of the modified SDP offer.
4) use the incoming connection address, determined in clause 6.1.4 or 6.1.5,
as the connection address in the SDP c-line of the modified SDP offer; and
5) use the incoming port information as determined in previous steps as port
information in the SDP m-line of the modified SDP offer.
### 6.1.8 Allocating secondary local MRs
According to local policy, the IMS-ALG may allocate a secondary MR for each
combination of IP realm, nettype and addrtype on the outgoing side for which
the IMS-ALG can allocate an MR context. However, if the IMS-ALG does not
require a local MR for non-OMR reasons, the IMS ALG should only allocate a
secondary MR for a combination of IP realm, nettype and addrtype if the IP
realm, nettype and addrtype are not represented by a visited-realm or
secondary-realm instance for the media line in the SDP offer. To allocate a
secondary MR, the IMS-ALG shall:
1) if no MR context has been allocated due to a previous SDP offer-answer
exchange, allocate an MR context for the IP realm, nettype and addrtype on the
outgoing side, using the incoming connection address and incoming port
information for the media line, determined in clause 6.1.4 or 6.1.5, as the
remote connection address and port information for the incoming termination;
2) if codec information is to be provided to the allocated MR for the incoming
termination, provide to the MR the incoming codec information, as determined
in clause 6.1.4 or 6.1.5;
NOTE: The IMS-ALG can defer the allocation of an MR termination at the
incoming side and the related procedures in steps 1) and 2) until it processes
the SDP answer.
3) if any codec information is to be provided to the allocated MR for the
outgoing termination, provide to the MR the codec information from the SDP
m-line and associated attribute lines of the modified SDP offer;
4) if the IMS-ALG did not yet add a visited-realm instance for the outgoing
side (the IMS-ALG did not allocate a primary MR and did not perform any codec
changes, see clause 6.1.7); then
a) if there is no visited-realm instance associated with the connection
address and port information for the media line in the received SDP offer,
then construct and add this visited-realm instance; and
b) add to the SDP offer a visited-realm instance with the same IP realm,
connection address and port information as the previous visited-realm instance
(after a possible execution of step 3 in clause 6.1.4 for the media line),
5) add to the modified SDP offer a secondary-realm instance for the context
allocated in step 1).
### 6.1.9 Forwarding SDP offer
The IMS-ALG shall:
1) if local policy forbids sending of OMR related attributes to the outgoing
IP realm, the IMS-ALG shall delete all OMR related attributes from the
modified SDP offer; and
2) if the IMS-ALG has made any modifications to the received SDP offer before
forwarding and the modified SDP offer includes OMR related attributes, the
IMS-ALG shall compute checksum values as described in clause 5.6.3 and replace
or add the \"omr-s-cksum\" and \"omr-m-cksum\" attributes for the media line.
The IMS-ALG forwards the SDP offer according to TS 24.229 [4].
## 6.2 IMS-ALG handling of initial SDP answer
### 6.2.1 General
Upon receiving the initial or second SDP answer corresponding to the initial
or second SDP offer sent in clause 6.1, the IMS-ALG supporting OMR shall
perform the procedures in the following clauses for each media line in the
initial or second SDP answer.
### 6.2.2 IMS-ALG bypasses an allocated transcoding MR
The IMS-ALG uses the following conditions to determine that a previously
allocated primary local MR or upstream MR is to be bypassed and that a second
SDP offer/answer transaction is needed to update the connection information on
the outgoing side. Two examples of this procedure are given in Annex Q of TS
23.228 [3]: steps 5) and 6) of Figure Q.5, and steps 7) and 8) of Figure Q.7.
If the following conditions are true:
1) the received initial SDP answer includes connection address information for
the media line that is a valid IP address other than the unspecified address
(i.e., IPv4: "0.0.0.0", IPv6: "invalid.invalid"); and
2) it is possible to immediately initiate a second SDP offer/answer
transaction towards the initial SDP answerer with the available SIP
signalling,
then the IMS-ALG should re-evaluate the conditions in clause 6.1.3, steps 1)
to 4), taking into account the information from the originally received
initial SDP offer, as well as the codecs received in the initial SDP answer as
additional information (using the procedure in clause 5.5 if the initial SDP
answer includes an actual configuration), to select again whether to allocate
a primary local MR and to recompute how many realm instances can be bypassed.
The IMS-ALG should select to modify the previous decision if a higher number
of realm instances can be bypassed.
If the IMS-ALG selected in the previous step to modify the previous decision
and
\- to not allocate a primary local MR that has previously been allocated; or
\- to not allocate a primary local MR and to bypass other previous realm
instances than decided when previously evaluating clause 6.1.3,
then the IMS-ALG shall:
1) apply the procedures in clause 6.1.4 to bypass previous MRs or the
procedures in clause 6.1.5 to not bypass previous MRs (using information from
the originally received initial SDP offer), depending on its corresponding
decision;
2) apply the procedures in clause 6.1.7 to not allocate a primary local MR
without making any codec changes;
3) after clauses 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 are completed as applicable for all media
lines, apply the procedures in clause 6.1.9 for each media line to send a
second SDP offer within available SIP signalling, initiating a new second SDP
offer/answer transaction towards the initial SDP answerer; and
4) upon receipt of the second SDP answer, continue handling of the second SDP
answer as if it were the initial SDP answer, and reference the most recent
data associated with the forwarding of the (modified) second SDP offer (i.e.,
incoming SDP information, allocated MRs and modified second SDP offer) as if
it occurred the first time.
### 6.2.3 IMS-ALG allocates a local transcoding MR when performing proactive
transcoding without resource reservation
The IMS-ALG uses the procedures in this clause if it receives an initial SDP
answer without a realm instance, performed proactive transcoding without
resource reservation when forwarding the initial SDP offer, as in step 2) of
clause 6.1.7, and then determines that it needs to allocate an MR for
proactive transcoding.
If all the following conditions are true:
1) the received initial SDP answer includes connection address information for
the media line that is a valid IP address other than the unspecified address
(i.e., IPv4: "0.0.0.0", IPv6: "invalid.invalid");
2) the IMS-ALG performed proactive transcoding without resource reservation
when previously forwarding the initial SDP offer, as in step 2) of clause
6.1.7;
3) the selected codec in the received initial SDP answer is not supported by
the incoming media path and incoming codec information, as previously
determined in clause 6.1.4 or 6.1.5 (using information from the originally
received initial SDP offer), indicating that an MR must be allocated to
provide transcoding; and
4) it is possible to immediately initiate a second SDP offer/answer
transaction towards the SDP answerer with the available SIP signalling,
NOTE: If a second SDP offer/answer transaction cannot be initiated with
available SIP signalling, the OMR algorithm will fail to allocate a
functioning end-to-end media path.
then the IMS-ALG shall:
1) if when previously handling the initial SDP offer it was determined in step
2) of clause 6.1.3 that one or more realm instances can be bypassed when
allocating a primary local MR (using information from the originally received
initial SDP offer), then store instance-number value _k_ =_j_ and apply the
procedures in clause 6.1.4 to bypass previous MRs, else apply the procedures
in clause 6.1.5 to not bypass previous MRs (using information from the
originally received initial SDP offer);
2) apply the procedures in clause 6.1.6 to allocate a primary local MR;
3) apply the procedures in clause 6.1.8 to update allocation of any secondary
MRs, if necessary;
4) after clauses 6.2.2 and 6.2.3 are completed as applicable for all media
lines, apply the procedures in clause 6.1.9 for each media line, to send a
second SDP offer within available SIP signalling, and to initiate a new SDP
offer/answer transaction towards the initial SDP answerer; and
5) upon receipt of the second SDP answer, continue handling of the second SDP
answer as if it were the initial SDP answer, and reference the most recent
data associated with the forwarding of the (modified) second SDP offer (i.e.,
incoming information, allocated MRs and modified second SDP offer) as if it
occurred the first time.
### 6.2.4 IMS-ALG determines steps required to complete the handling of the
SDP answer
The IMS-ALG performs the following steps to determine the disposition of any
allocated MRs and to complete the handling of the SDP answer:
1) if the received SDP answer for the media line includes a connection address
with unspecified address and a visited-realm instance, then the IMS-ALG shall
apply the procedures in clause 6.2.5;
2) if the received SDP answer for the media line includes a connection address
with unspecified address and a secondary-realm instance, then the IMS-ALG
shall apply the procedures in clause 6.2.6;
2a) If the received SDP answer for the media line includes a connection
address with unspecified address and no visited-realm or secondary-realm
instance, then the IMS-ALG shall:
a) if necessary, update the unspecified connection address information in the
SDP answer with the unspecified address of the appropriate type for the
network into which the SDP answer will be sent (i.e., IPv4: \"0.0.0.0\", IPv6:
\"invalid.invalid\");
3) if all the following conditions are true:
a) the connection address for the media line in the received SDP answer is a
valid (not unspecified) address; and
b) the IMS-ALG did not allocate a primary local MR (i.e., executed clause
6.1.7) when forwarding the SDP offer,
then the IMS-ALG shall apply the procedures in clause 6.2.7, and
4) if all the following conditions are true:
a) the connection address for the media line in the received SDP answer is a
valid (not unspecified) address; and
b) the IMS-ALG allocated a primary local MR (i.e., executed clause 6.1.6) when
forwarding the SDP offer,
then the IMS-ALG shall apply the procedures in clause 6.2.8 to retain a
primary local MR.
### 6.2.5 Receiving an unspecified connection address and a visited-realm
instance
If the IMS-ALG receives a connection address with unspecified address and a
visited-realm instance, then the IMS-ALG shall:
1) If the visited-realm instance for the media line in the SDP answer has an
instance-number that matches the visited-realm instance associated with the
incoming SDP offer information,
NOTE 1: The visited-realm instance associated with the incoming SDP offer
information is either the one in the received SDP offer with highest instance-
number (before any bypass decision is made), if one is present, or the one
added in clause 6.1.6 step 6) or in clause 6.1.7 step 2a).
NOTE 2: The IP realms in the two visited-realm instances either have the same
name or are connected.
then the IMS-ALG shall:
\- replace the connection address and port information for the media line in
the SDP answer with the connection address and port information from the
visited-realm instance in the received SDP answer, and
\- retain the visited-realm instance in the SDP answer,
2) else the IMS-ALG shall:
\- if necessary, update the unspecified connection address information in the
SDP answer with the unspecified address of the appropriate type for the
network into which the SDP answer will be sent (i.e., IPv4: \"0.0.0.0\", IPv6:
\"invalid.invalid\").
### 6.2.6 Receiving an unspecified connection address and a secondary-realm
instance
If the IMS-ALG receives a connection address with unspecified address and a
secondary-realm instance, then the IMS-ALG shall:
1) if the secondary-realm instance for the media line in the SDP answer has an
instance-number that matches a secondary-realm instance added by the IMS-ALG
when applying procedures in clause 6.1.8 then the IMS-ALG shall apply the
procedures in clause 6.2.8 to retain a secondary local MR,
NOTE: The IP realms in the two secondary-realm instances either have the same
name or are connected.
2) else the IMS-ALG shall:
\- if necessary, update the unspecified connection address information in the
SDP answer with the unspecified address of the appropriate type for the
network into which the SDP answer will be sent (i.e., IPv4: \"0.0.0.0\", IPv6:
\"invalid.invalid\").
### 6.2.7 Other handling when no primary local MR allocated
If the IMS-ALG receives (as determined in clause 6.2.4) an SDP answer with a
valid connection address after forwarding an SDP offer without allocating a
primary local MR, then the IMS-ALG shall:
1) If the IMS-ALG applied clause 6.1.4 to bypass previous MRs when handling
the forwarding of the SDP offer, then the IMS-ALG shall:
a) copy into the media line of the SDP answer the visited-realm or secondary-
realm instance from the media line of the received SDP offer that was used to
populate the connection address and port information in the forwarded SDP
offer, replacing the connection-address and port information in the instance
with the connection address and port information from the received SDP answer,
and if the IP realm in the instance is a connected IP realm, replacing the IP
realm name with the corresponding local IP realm name; and
b) replace the connection address information in the SDP answer with the
unspecified address of the appropriate type for the network into which the SDP
answer will be sent (i.e., IPv4: \"0.0.0.0\", IPv6: \"invalid.invalid\"),
2) else the IMS-ALG did not bypass previous MRs when forwarding the SDP offer
and the IMS-ALG shall not modify the SDP answer.
NOTE: In step 1) the received SDP answer never includes a realm instance. In
step 2) the SDP answer can but does not necessarily include a realm instance.
### 6.2.8 Retaining a primary or secondary local MR
If the IMS-ALG decides (applying the criteria in clause 6.2.4 and clause
6.2.6) to retain a primary or secondary local MR, the IMS-ALG shall:
1) if the IMS-ALG received an SDP answer with no secondary-realm instance for
the media line, then the IMS-ALG shall:
NOTE: The IMS-ALG retains a primary local MR in this case. The IMS-ALG can but
does not necessarily receive a visited-realm instance in an SDP answer when
retaining a primary local MR. If present, the visited-realm instance can be
used to identify the connected IP realm for the outgoing termination, if
different from the IP realm of the outgoing termination.
a) update the remote connection address and port information for the outgoing
termination on the selected primary local MR context with the connection
address and port information for the media line in the received SDP answer,
b) delete the visited-realm instance from the SDP answer, if present,
2) if the IMS-ALG received an SDP answer with a secondary-realm instance for
the media line,
> then the IMS-ALG shall:
a) update the remote connection address and port information for the outgoing
termination on the selected secondary local MR context with the connection-
address and port information from the secondary-realm instance in the received
SDP answer; and
b) delete the secondary-realm instance from the SDP answer,
3) if the selected codecs in the SDP answer are not in the set of codecs
associated with the incoming SDP offer information, as determined in clause
6.1.4 or 6.1.5 when handling the SDP offer, then modify the SDP answer to
include the codecs selected for the incoming termination of the selected local
MR;
4) if the selected MR has access to an IP realm or connected IP realm, nettype
and addrtype associated with a visited-realm or secondary-realm instance for
the media line
\- such that the instance has an instance-number value _k_ that is less than
the highest instance-number value _n_ associated with the media line in the
incoming SDP offer information, previously determined in clause 6.1.4 or
6.1.5; and
\- such that the instance _k_ is associated with a codec list, determined
using the procedures in clause 5.3, which includes the codecs selected for the
incoming termination of the selected local MR in step 3) (using the procedure
in clause 5.5 if the SDP answer includes an actual configuration),
> then the IMS-ALG shall:
a) store the realm instances with instance-number greater than _k_ , which are
associated with additional MRs that can be bypassed after selecting a codec
for the incoming media path when allocating a primary local MR;
b) apply the procedures in clause 6.1.4 to bypass additional previous MRs
(using information from the originally received SDP offer);
c) insert the incoming connection address and incoming port information for
the media line, as determined in step b), as the remote connection address and
port information for the selected IP realm on the incoming termination of the
selected MR;
d) if necessary, modify the selected codec information in the SDP answer to be
a valid response to the incoming SDP offer codec information determined in
step b);
e) if codec information is to be provided to the allocated MR on the incoming
termination, provide to the MR the incoming codec information as determined in
step d),
5) If the IMS-ALG applied clause 6.1.4 to bypass previous MRs when forwarding
the SDP offer or in step 4b), then the IMS-ALG shall:
a) copy into the media line of the SDP answer the visited-realm or secondary-
realm instance from the media line of the received SDP offer that was used for
the remote connection address and port information for the incoming
termination on the MR, replacing the connection-address and port information
in the instance with the local connection address and port information for the
incoming termination on the selected MR, and if the IP realm in the instance
is a connected IP realm, replacing the IP realm name with the corresponding
local IP realm name; and
b) replace the connection address information in the SDP answer with the
unspecified address of the appropriate type for the network into which the SDP
answer will be sent (i.e., IPv4: \"0.0.0.0\", IPv6: \"invalid.invalid\"),
6) If the IMS-ALG applied clause 6.1.5 to not bypass previous MRs when
forwarding the SDP offer, and did not bypass previous MRs in step 4b), then
the IMS-ALG shall:
a) replace the connection address and port information for the media line in
the SDP answer with the local connection address and port information for the
incoming termination on the selected MR.
### 6.2.9 Forwarding the SDP answer
The IMS-ALG forwards the SDP answer according to TS 24.229 [4].
The IMS-ALG shall release each MR for the media line, when it is no longer
potentially needed for this and any other forked dialog.
## 6.3 IMS-ALG OMR media resource operations
### 6.3.1 General
The IMS-ALG OMR procedures as specified by clauses 6.1 and 6.2 refer to
generic MR allocation operation. When no MR was previously allocated, e.g.
during the initial SDP offer/answer exchange, this allocation will result in
the allocation of one or more local media termination point pairs (ingress and
egress) -- one for the primary IP realm and possible additional terminations
points for secondary IP realms.
Subsequent SDP offer/answer exchanges may result in the decision that a local
MR is needed. If a local MR was not previously allocated, then one will now be
allocated. If a local MR was previously allocated that matches the resource
information needed, then the previously allocated resource will be used. If
the previously allocated local MR does not match the resource information
needed, then the local MR will be modified to meet the current need.
If it is determined that local MR may be by-passed or no longer needed, then
any previously allocated local MRs will be deallocated.
### 6.3.2 IMS-ALG operations
The OMR MR procedures in this document are applicable to the following IMS
entities that perform as IMS-ALG using the media resource interface operations
as indicated.
\- An IBCF acting as an IMS-ALG controlling a TrGW using the Ix interface as
defined by TS 29.162 [16] and TS 29.238 [9]:
> \- Reserve TrGW Connection Point;
\- Configure TrGW Connection Point,
\- Reserve and Configure TrGW Connection Point; and
\- Release TrGW Connection Point.
\- A P-CSCF acting as IMS-ALG controlling an IMS-AGW using the Iq interface as
defined by TS 23.334 [15] and TS 29.334 [10]:
\- Reserve AGW Connection Point;
> \- Configure AGW Connection Point;
>
> \- Reserve and Configure AGW Connection Point; and
\- Release AGW Connection Point.
\- An AS acting as B2BUA and adapting IMS-ALG procedures to control an MRF
shall use one or more of the following:
\- IETF RFC 4240 [11] conference service;
\- IETF RFC 4117 [19]; and
\- IETF RFC 3260 [12] and IETF RFC 6505 [13].
## 6.4 Handling of connected IP realms
For each IP realm to which a controlled MR has direct access, the IMS-ALG
supporting OMR may be provisioned with a list of the names of connected IP
realms, if any. The IMS-ALG shall determine if an IP realm is connected to a
local IP realm based only on provisioning.
NOTE 1: The OMR algorithm assumes that a first IMS-ALG or UA sending an SDP
offer that offers connectivity via a local IP realm will accept from a second
IMS-ALG or UA an SDP answer with an address in a connected IP realm, even if
the first IMS-ALG or UA does not have provisioned information about the
connected IP realm.
NOTE 2: Connected IP realm lists only need to be provisioned at certain OMR-
capable nodes. For example, it is preferred that an IBCF whose TrGW has
connectivity to multiple peer networks via bilateral interconnect be
provisioned with connected IP realm information.
# 7 UA Procedures
## 7.1 UA sending an initial SDP offer
Upon preparing an initial SDP offer for sending to begin an initial SDP
offer/answer transaction, a UA supporting OMR shall additionally:
1) add to the initial SDP offer a visited-realm instance for the IP realm
associated with the connection address and port information for the media line
in the initial SDP offer;
2) for each combination of IP realm, nettype and addrtype on the outgoing side
for which the UA can allocate an MR termination according to local policy, if
the IP realm, nettype and addrtype are not associated with the media line in
the initial SDP offer, allocate an MR termination for the IP realm, nettype
and addrtype on the outgoing side, using the same codecs associated with the
media line;
3) add to the initial SDP offer a secondary-realm instance for each
termination allocated in step 2); and
4) compute a checksum values as described in clause 5.6.3 and add the \"omr-s-
cksum\" and \"omr-m-cksum\" attributes for the media line.
The UA then sends the initial SDP offer according to TS 24.229 [4].
NOTE: A subsequent SDP offer is sent according to procedures in clause 8.
## 7.2 UA receiving an initial SDP offer
### 7.2.1 General
Upon receiving an SDP offer that includes OMR attributes and selecting a codec
for the media line, a UA supporting OMR shall perform the procedures specified
in clauses 7.2.2 and 7.2.3, and then send the initial or second SDP answer
according to TS 24.229 [4].
### 7.2.2 Validating the incoming SDP offer
If any of the following conditions are true:
1) the SDP offer includes any OMR attributes for the media line, but no
visited-realm instance;
2) the connection-address and port information in the visited-realm instance
with the highest value of instance-number for the media line does not match
the connection address and port information for the media line; or
3) one of the following checksum comparison failures are true:
\- the \"omr-m-cksum\" attribute does not match the checksum value computed
for the media line as described in clause 5.6.3; or
\- based on local policy, if the \"omr-m-cksum\" attribute matches the
computed media line checksum, but the \"omr-s-cksum\" attribute does not match
the checksum value computed for the session level lines as described in clause
5.6.3,
then the UA shall remove all OMR related attributes associated with the media
line.
### 7.2.3 UA may choose an alternate realm instance to bypass an upstream MR
If all the following conditions are true:
1) the UA can make available a media termination in an IP realm, nettype and
addrtype such that this IP realm or a connected IP realm, nettype and addrtype
match the IP realm, nettype and addrtype of a visited-realm or secondary-realm
instance for the media line in the SDP offer;
2) the instance does not match the connection address and port information in
the SDP offer; and
3) the instance supports the codec selected by the UA,
then the UA shall:
1) select the visited-realm or secondary-realm instance with the lowest value
of instance-number such that the UA can make available a media termination in
the IP realm or connected IP realm, nettype and addrtype that matches the IP
realm, nettype and addrtype of the instance and the instance supports the
codec selected by the UA;
2) allocate a media termination in the selected IP realm, nettype and
addrtype;
3) copy into the media line of the SDP answer the selected visited-realm or
secondary-realm instance from the media line of the received SDP offer,
replacing the connection-address and port information in the instance with the
local connection address and port information for the allocated termination,
and if the IP realm in the instance is a connected IP realm, replacing the IP
realm name with the corresponding local IP realm name; and
4) replace the connection address information in the SDP answer with the
unspecified address of the appropriate type for the network into which the SDP
answer will be sent (i.e., IPv4: \"0.0.0.0\", IPv6: \"invalid.invalid\").
## 7.3 UA receiving an initial SDP answer
### 7.3.1 General
Upon receiving the initial SDP answer corresponding to the initial SDP offer
sent in clause 7.1, the UA supporting OMR shall perform the procedures
specified in either clause 7.3.2 if the initial SDP answer included a realm
instance or clause 7.3.3 if the initial SDP answer did not include a realm
instance.
### 7.3.2 Receiving SDP answer with an unspecified connection address
If the received SDP answer for the media line includes an unspecified
connection address (i.e., IPv4: \"0.0.0.0\", IPv6: \"invalid.invalid\") and a
visited-realm or a secondary-realm instance with an instance-number that
matches a visited-realm or secondary-realm instance for the media line from
the SDP offer, then the UA shall:
NOTE: The IP realms in the two realm instances either have the same name or
are connected.
1) update the remote connection address and port information for the selected
outgoing termination with the connection-address and port information from the
visited-realm or secondary-realm instance in the received SDP answer; and
2) release any other MR apart from the selected MR allocated for the media
line, when it is no longer potentially needed for any other forked dialog.
### 7.3.3 Receiving SDP answer with a valid connection address
If the received SDP answer includes a valid (not unspecified) connection
address for the media line, then the UA shall:
1) update the remote connection address and port information for the primary
outgoing termination with the connection address and port information from the
received SDP answer; and
2) release any secondary MR allocated for the media line, when it is no longer
potentially needed for any other forked dialog.
## 7.4 UA OMR media resource operations
### 7.4.1 General
The UA OMR procedures as specified by clauses 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3 refer to
generic MR allocation operation. This allocation will result in the allocation
of a local media termination associated with the selected IP realm.
Subsequent SDP offer/answer exchanges may result in either the exact same
local MR being allocated or possibly a different local MR. If the UA is able
to determine that the same resource information is being requested, the
existing allocated local MR will be used. If the previously allocated local MR
does not match the resource information needed, then the local MR will be
modified to meet the current need.
### 7.4.2 UA operations
The OMR MR procedures in this document are applicable to the following IMS
entities that perform as UA using the media resource interface operations as
indicated.
\- An AS acting as B2BUA and adapting UA procedures to control an MRF shall
use one or more of the following:
\- IETF RFC 4240 [11] conference service and tone/announcement service;
> \- IETF RFC 5552 [18]; and
\- IETF RFC 3260 [12] and IETF RFC 6505 [13].
\- An MGCF acting as an UA controlling an IM-MGW using the Mn interface as
defined by TS 29.163 [17] and TS 29.332 [14]:
\- Reserve IMS Connection Point;
\- Configure IMS Connection Point;
\- Reserve and Configure IMS Connection Point; and
\- Release IMS Connection Point.
## 7.5 Handling of connected IP realms
For each IP realm to which a controlled MR has direct access, the UA
supporting OMR may be provisioned with a list of the names of connected IP
realms, if any. The UA shall determine if an IP realm is connected to a local
IP realm based only on provisioning.
NOTE 1: The OMR algorithm assumes that a first IMS-ALG or UA sending an SDP
offer that offers connectivity via a local IP realm will accept from a second
IMS-ALG or UA an SDP answer with an address in a connected IP realm, even if
the first IMS-ALG or UA does not have provisioned information about the
connected IP realm.
NOTE 2: Connected IP realm lists only need to be provisioned at certain OMR-
capable nodes. For example, it is preferred that an IBCF whose TrGW has
connectivity to multiple peer networks via bilateral interconnect be
provisioned with connected IP realm information.
# 8 Subsequent SDP offer/answer transactions
## 8.1 General
Any UA or IMS-ALG controlling a media stream may initiate a subsequent SDP
offer/answer transaction at any time after first establishing the media flow,
in order to modify characteristics of the media flow.
NOTE: For example, a media endpoint (IP address) can change, the preferred
codec can change, or a server can select to insert a media function such as a
tone generator or conference focus.
An IMS-ALG or UA shall handle a received SDP offer as a subsequent SDP offer
as specified in clause 8.2 if an initial or second SDP offer/answer
transaction has been completed and a received SDP offer contains no OMR
specific SDP attributes.
## 8.2 IMS-ALG and UA subsequent SDP offer procedures
When a IMS-ALG determines according to clause 8.1 that a received SDP offer
shall be handled as a subsequent SDP offer, the IMS-ALG with or without a
local primary or secondary MR allocated shall perform the following steps:
1) determine if the local primary or secondary MR can be inserted or removed
from the media path as specified in clause 8.4;
2) if the IMS-ALG keeps an allocated MR or allocates a new MR and continues
with an MR inserted in the media path, the IMS-ALG shall:
\- if necessary (e.g. due to a codec change or allocation of a new MR)
interact with the MR;
\- update the connection address for the media line in the outgoing subsequent
SDP offer; and
\- forward the modified SDP offer as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4].
3) if the IMS-ALG does not allocate a new MR or deallocated an MR allocated in
the initial or second SDP offer / answer transaction in clause 6 and continues
without a MR inserted in the media path, forward the incoming subsequent SDP
offer as received.
When a UA (e.g. a conference application treating the media resource as an
endpoint or an MGCF) determines according to clause 8.1 that a SDP offer shall
be sent as a subsequent SDP offer , the UA shall not apply OMR procedures in
clause 7 when sending the subsequent SDP offer. If the conditions in clause
8.4 for reallocating a MR are fulfilled, the UA may reallocate a MR.
## 8.3 IMS-ALG and UA subsequent SDP answer procedures
When an IMS-ALG receives a subsequent SDP answer as the result of a subsequent
SDP offer generated according to clauses 8.2, the IMS-ALG with or without a
local primary or secondary MR allocated shall perform the following steps:
1) if the IMS-ALG has a local MR allocated:
NOTE: The local MR can have been allocated during the initial or second SDP
offer / answer transaction as described in clause 6 or as the result of the
subsequent SDP offer generated in clause 8.2.
a) if necessary interact with the MR as described in clauses 6.3; and
b) update connection address in the outgoing subsequent SDP answer for the
media line with the MR connection information;
c) forward the modified SDP answer as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229 [4]; and
2) if the IMS-ALG has no local MR allocated:
a) if the local MR was allocated when the subsequent SDP offer was received,
release MR resources; and
b) forward the subsequent SDP answer as received.
When a UA not acting as a B2BUA (e.g. a conference application treating the
media resource as an endpoint or the MGCF) receives a subsequent SDP answer,
the UA shall not apply OMR procedures specified in clause 7.
## 8.4 Handling media resources during a subsequent SDP offer/answer
transaction
An IMS-ALG, an AS acting as B2BUA and adapting IMS-ALG procedures to control
an MRF or a UA not acting as a B2BUA (e.g. a conference application treating
the media resource as an endpoint or the MGCF) shall not allocate, deallocate
or reallocate a MR during the subsequent SDP offer/answer transaction unless
any of the following exceptions apply:
\- an IMS-ALG may allocate an MR resource if the downstream and upstream media
anchoring points are within the same realm and in the same operator network as
the IMS-ALG;
\- an IMS-ALG may deallocate an MR resource if the downstream and upstream
media anchoring points are within the same realm and in the same operator
network as the IMS-ALG; or
\- an UA may reallocate an MR resource if the downstream and upstream media
anchoring point is within the same realm and in the same operator network as
the UA.
If an IMS-ALG or UA decides to allocate or reallocate a MR, the IMS-ALG or UA
shall interact with the MR as described in clause 6.3 or 7.4.
If a IMS-ALG decides to deallocate a MR, the IMS-ALG shall release the MR
resource when receiving the subsequent SDP answer.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Signalling flows
# A.1 Scope of signalling flows
This annex gives examples of signalling flows for Optimized Media Routeing
(OMR) based on the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) and the Session
Description Protocol (SDP). The OMR specific SDP syntax is described in TS
24.229 [4].
# A.2 Introduction
The signalling flows in this annex are based on IP realm and IP structure in
Figure A.2-1.
Figure A.2-1: IP realm and IP structure
Operator X and operator Y have an agreement to allow roaming users and to use
OMR as much as possible.
UE-A and UE-B are mobile users roaming into the visited network X. IP
addresses etc. are obtained as described in TS 24.229 [4].
The operator X implements the IBCF policy to allow OMR optimization of
anchoring if originating UE is a visiting/ roaming user respectively if
terminating UE is a visiting/roaming user.
The operator Y implements the IBCF policy to allow OMR optimization of
anchoring if home UE is visiting/roaming in another network.
# A.3 Media bypassing all IMS-ALGs
## A.3.1 General
This clause provides an example of a call where the media is bypassing all
IMS-ALG and sent directly between the UEs.
## A.3.2 Message flow
This clause describes the scenario when two mobile user A and B roams into a
visited network X and both users belongs to the same operator Y.
Preconditions:
\- Both user A and B are registered to the Home IMS network Y via the visited
operator X network;
\- the visited operator X and the operator of user A and B IMS home network Y
have an agreement to allow media to be bypassed using OMR;
\- both user A and B are connected to IP realm Xa of the visited operator
network X;
\- the AMR codec is allowed and accepted by all involved entities; and
\- no B2BUA manipulating SDP is connected in the intermediate IM CN subsystem.
Figure A.3.2-1 shows the message flow for the scenario.
NOTE: For clarity, the SIP 100 (Trying) messages are not shown in the
signalling flow.
Figure A.3.2-1: Signalling flow for media bypassing all IMS ALGs
The steps of the flow are as follows:
**1\. INVITE request (UE-A to P-CSCF-A) - see example in table A.3.2-1.**
The UE-A sends a SIP INVITE request including an initial SDP offer according
to TS 24.229 [4].

**2\. INVITE request (P-CSCF-A to IBCF-1) - see example in table A.3.2-1.**
The P-CSCF-A uses the procedures in clauses 6.1.5, 6.1.7 and 6.1.9 since no MR
could be bypassed and no MR is allocated.
The P-CSCF-A:
\- uses the connection-address from the SDP c-line as incoming connection-
address in subsequent steps;
\- uses the port information from the SDP m-line as incoming port information
in subsequent steps;
\- uses the codec information from the SDP m-line in subsequent steps;
\- inserts the incoming codec information into the SDP m-line and associated
attribute lines of the modified initial SDP offer;
\- uses the incoming connection address as the connection address in the SDP
c-line of the forwarded initial SDP offer, and
\- use the incoming port information as port information in the SDP m-line of
the modified initial SDP offer.
The P-CSCF-A then selects an IBCF, IBCF-1, in the IP realm
\"Xa.operatorX.net\" and forwards the INVITE request with the initial SDP
offer to the IBCF-1 according to TS 24.229 [4].
**3\. INVITE request (IBCF-1 to IBCF-2) - see example in table A.3.2-3**
The IBCF-1 uses the procedures in clauses 6.1.5, 6.1.6 and 6.1.9 since no
previous realm instance offers an opportunity to bypass a previous MR and a
local MR is required for IP realm matching.
The IBCF-1:
\- uses the connection-address from the SDP c-line as incoming connection-
address in subsequent steps;
\- uses the port information from the SDP m-line as incoming port information
in subsequent steps;
\- uses the codec information from the SDP m-line in subsequent steps;
\- allocates an MR context with access to the IP realms and addrtypes
associated with the incoming and outgoing signalling paths;
\- inserts the incoming connection address and incoming port information for
the media line into the remote connection address and port information for the
incoming termination on the MR;
\- provides to the MR the incoming codec information;
\- replaces the connection address and port information for the media line in
the initial SDP offer with the connection address and port information from
the MR termination on the outgoing side;
\- constructs and adds a visited-realm instance for the media line in the
received initial SDP offer to the modified initial SDP offer;
\- adds to the modified initial SDP offer a visited-realm instance for the IP
realm associated with the connection address and port information for the
media line in the modified initial SDP offer, including the incoming codec;
and
\- computes a checksum value for the media line as described in clause 5.6.3
and adds the \"omr-m-cksum\" and \"omr-s-cksum\" attributes for the media
line. The \"omr-s-cksum\" is set to \"0\" since there are no session
attributes to compute the checksum on.
The IBCF-1 then selects an IBCF, IBCF-2, in the IP realm \"X-Y.operatorX.net\"
and forwards the INVITE request with the initial SDP offer to the IBCF-2
according to TS 24.229 [4].

**4-5. INVITE request (IBCF-2 to IBCF-3 via intermediate IMS CN subsystem
entities) - see example in table A.3.2-4.**
The IBCF-2 uses the procedure in clauses 6.1.5, 6.1.6 and 6.1.9 since no realm
instance offers an opportunity to bypass a previous MR and a local MR is
required for IP realm matching.
The IBCF-2:
\- uses the connection-address from the SDP c-line as incoming connection-
address in subsequent steps;
\- uses the port information from the SDP m-line as incoming port information
in subsequent steps;
\- uses the codec information from the SDP m-line and associated non-OMR
attribute lines as incoming codec information in subsequent steps;
\- allocates an MR context with access to the IP realms, nettypes and
addrtypes associated with the incoming and outgoing signalling paths,
respectively, applying procedures as described in clause 6.3,
\- insert the incoming connection address and incoming port information for
the media line into the remote connection address and port information for the
incoming termination on the MR;
\- provides to the MR the incoming codec information;
\- replaces the connection address and port information for the media line in
the initial SDP offer with the connection address and port information from
the MR termination on the outgoing side;
\- adds to the modified initial SDP offer a visited-realm instance for the IP
realm associated with the connection address and port information for the
media line in the modified SDP offer, including the incoming codec; and
\- computes a checksum value for the media line as described in clause 5.3.4
and adds the \"omr-m-cksum\" and \"omr-s-cksum\" attributes for the media line
The \"omr-s-cksum\" attribute is set to \"0\" since there are no session
attributes to compute the checksum on..
The IBCF-2 forwards the INVITE request to the intermediate IMS CN subsystem
entities in IP realm \"Yb.operatorY.net\" according to TS 24.229 [4].
None of the intermediate IMS CN subsystem entities manipulated with the
initial SDP offer but the identity of user_B@operator_Y.net in the Request-URI
is change to the contact address, i.e. UE-B\@operatorX.net.
The intermediate IMS CN subsystem entities select an IBCF, IBCF-3, and forward
the INVITE request with the initial SDP offer to the IBCF-3 according to TS
24.229 [4].

**6\. INVITE request (IBCF-3 to IBCF-4) - see example in table A.3.2-6.**
The IBCF-3 uses the procedures in clauses 6.1.4, 6.1.7 and 6.1.9 since a
previous realm instance exists that can be used to bypass a previous MR,
IBCF-2, and bypass is allowed according to operator X and operator Y
agreements, and the previous realm instance match the outgoing IP realm so
that no local MR is required.
The IBCF-3:
\- uses the connection address and port information for the media line in the
initial SDP offer with the connection-address and port information from the
selected instance 2 as incoming connection address and incoming port
information for the media line;
\- deletes the visited-realm instance 3;
\- inserts the incoming codec information into the SDP m-line and associated
attribute lines of the modified initial SDP offer;
\- uses the incoming connection address as the connection address in the SDP
c-line of the forwarded initial SDP offer;
\- uses the incoming port information as port information in the SDP m-line of
the modified initial SDP offer; and
\- computes a checksum value for the media line as described in clause 5.3.4
and adds the \"omr-m-cksum\" and \"omr-s-cksum\" attributes for the media
line. The \"omr-s-cksum\" attribute is set to \"0\" since there are no session
attributes to compute the checksum on.
The IBCF-3 then selects an IBCF, IBCF-4, in the IP realm \"X.operatorX.net,
Y.operatorY.net\" and forwards the initial SDP offer according to TS 24.229
[4] to IBCF-4.

**7\. INVITE request (IBCF-4 to P-CSCF B) - see example in table A.3.2-7.**
The IBCF-4 uses the procedures in clauses 6.1.4, 6.1.7 and 6.1.9 since a
previous realm instance exists that can be used to bypass a previous MR,
IBCF-1, and the previous realm instance match the outgoing IP realm so that no
local MR is required.
The IBCF-4:
\- uses the connection address and port information for the media line in the
initial SDP offer with the connection-address and port information from the
selected instance 1 as incoming connection address and incoming port
information for the media line;
\- deletes the visited-realm instance 2;
\- inserts the incoming codec information into the SDP m-line and associated
attribute lines of the modified initial SDP offer;
\- uses the incoming connection address as the connection address in the SDP
c-line of the forwarded initial SDP offer;
\- uses the incoming port information as port information in the SDP m-line of
the modified initial SDP offer; and
\- computes a checksum value for the media line as described in clause 5.3.4
and adds the \"omr-m-cksum\" and \"omr-s-cksum\" attributes for the media
line. The \"omr-s-cksum\" attribute is set to \"0\" since there are no session
attributes to compute the checksum on.
The IBCF-4 forwards the INVITE request with the initial SDP offer to the
P-CSCF-B, in the IP realm \"X.operatorX.net\" according to TS 24.229 [4].

The P-CSCF-B uses the procedures in clauses 6.1.5, 6.1.7 and 6.1.9 since no
previous realm instance offers an opportunity to bypass an MR and no local MR
is required to match the incoming realm to the outgoing realm.
\- uses the connection-address from the SDP c-line as incoming connection-
address;
\- uses the port information from the SDP m-line as incoming port information;
\- uses the codec information from the SDP m-line and associated non-OMR
attribute lines as incoming codec information; and

# A.4 IMS-ALG allocates a local transcoding MR when performing proactive
transcoding without resource reservation
## A.4.1 General
This clause provides an example of a call where a transcoding MR adds the AMR
codec to the initial SDP offer without MR allocation.
The UE selects the added codec and the IMS-ALG needs to reserve MR and send an
UPDATE request with the IP address and port number of the allocated MR.
The IMS-ALG is transcoding between the AMR-WB codec and the AMR codec when the
call is established.
Figure A.4.1-1 shows the realm and IP structure used in this example.
Figure A.4.1-1: IP realm and IP structure
## A.4.2 Message flow
The user A at UE-A and the user B at UE-B are roaming into a visited network X
and both users belong to the same operator Y.
Preconditions:
\- Both user A and B are registered to the Home IMS network Y via the visited
operator X network;
\- the visited operator X and the operator Y have an agreement to allow media
to be bypassed using OMR;
\- both user A and B are connected to the realm \"Xa.operatorX.net\" of the
visited operator network X;
\- the AMR-WB codec is allowed and accepted by all involved entities. However,
the local policy of operator X is that the AMR codec shall always be included
in the initial SDP offer from a UE in the operator X network; and
\- no B2BUA manipulating SDP is connected in the intermediate IM CN subsystem.
Figure A.4.2-1 shows the message flow for the scenario.
NOTE: For clarity, the SIP 100 (Trying) messages are not shown in the
signalling flow.
Figure A.4.2-1: Message flow for proactive transcoder without resource
reservation
The steps of the flow are as follows:
**1\. INVITE request (UE-A to P-CSCF-A) - see example in table A.4.2-1.**
The UE-A sends a SIP INVITE request according to TS 24.229 [4]. The INVITE
request includes an initial SDP offer proposing the use of the AMR-WB codec
and inband DTMF.

**2\. INVITE request (P-CSCF-A to IBCF-1) - see example in table A.4.2-1.**
The P-CSCF-A uses the procedures in clauses 6.1.5, 6.1.7 and 6.1.9 since no MR
could be bypassed and no MR is allocated.
The P-CSCF-A:
\- uses the connection-address from the SDP c-line as incoming connection-
address;
\- uses the port information from the SDP m-line as incoming port information;
\- uses the codec information from the SDP m-line;
\- inserts the incoming codec information into the SDP m-line and associated
attribute lines of the modified initial SDP offer;
\- uses the incoming connection address as the connection address in the SDP
c-line of the forwarded initial SDP offer, and
\- uses the incoming port information as port information in the SDP m-line of
the modified initial SDP offer.
The P-CSCF-A then selects an IBCF, IBCF-1, in the realm \"Xa.operatorX.net\"
and forwards the INVITE request with the initial SDP offer to the IBCF-1
according to TS 24.229 [4].
**3\. INVITE request (IBCF-1 to IBCF-2) - see example in table A.4.2-3**
The IBCF-1 uses the procedures in clauses 6.1.5, 6.1.7 and 6.1.9 since no
previous realm instance offers an opportunity to bypass a previous MR and a
local MR is not required for realm matching. The IBCF-1 has access to a
transcoding MR.
The IBCF-1:
\- uses the connection-address from the SDP c-line as incoming connection-
address;
\- uses the port information from the SDP m-line as incoming port information;
\- uses the codec information from the SDP m-line;
\- constructs and adds to the modified initial SDP offer a visited-realm
instance 1 for the media line associated with the connection address and port
information for the media line in the received initial SDP offer;
\- makes the codec changes to incoming codec information according to local
policy, taking into account the procedures in clause 5.4, and inserts the AMR
codec information into the SDP m-line and associated attribute lines of the
modified initial SDP offer;
\- adds to the modified initial SDP offer a visited-realm instance 2 with the
same IP realm, connection address and port information as in the previous
visited-realm instance 1 for the media line including the incoming codec
information; and
\- computes a checksum value for the media line as described in clause 5.6.3
and adds omr-m-cksum and omr-s-cksum attributes for the media line. The omr-s-
cksum is set to \"0\" since there are no session line attributes left to
calculate the checksum on.
The IBCF-1 then selects an IBCF, IBCF-2, in the realm \"Xa.operatorX.net\" and
forwards the INVITE request with the initial SDP offer to the IBCF-2 according
to TS 24.229 [4].

**4-5. INVITE request (IBCF-2 to IBCF-3 via intermediate IMS CN subsystem
entities) - see example in table A.4.2-4.**
The IBCF-2 uses the procedure in clauses 6.1.5, 6.1.6 and 6.1.9 since no realm
instance offers an opportunity to bypass a previous MR and a local MR is
required for realm matching.
The IBCF-2:
\- uses the connection-address from the SDP c-line as incoming connection-
address;
\- uses the port information from the SDP m-line as incoming port information;
\- uses the codec information from the SDP m-line and associated non-OMR
attribute lines as incoming codec information;
\- allocates an MR context with access to the IP realms, nettypes and
addrtypes associated with the incoming connection address and port information
and outgoing signalling paths, respectively, applying procedures as described
in clause 6.3,
\- insert the incoming connection address and incoming port information for
the media line into the remote connection address and port information for the
incoming termination on the MR;
\- provides to the MR the incoming codec information;
\- replaces the connection address and port information for the media line in
the initial SDP offer with the connection address and port information from
the MR termination on the outgoing side;
\- adds to the modified initial SDP offer a visited-realm instance 3 for the
IP realm associated with the connection address and port information for the
media line in the modified initial SDP offer;
\- computes a checksum value for the media line as described in clause 5.6.3
and adds the omr-m-cksum and omr-s-cksum attributes for the media line. The
omr-s-cksum attribute is set to \"0\" since there are no session line
attributes to compute the checksum on; and
\- forwards the INVITE request to the intermediate IMS CN subsystem entities
in realm \"Yb.operatorY.net\" according to TS 24.229 [4].
None of the intermediate IMS CN subsystem entities manipulated with the
initial SDP offer but the identity of user_B@operator_Y.net in the Request-URI
is change to the contact address, i.e. UE-B\@operatorX.net.
The intermediate IMS CN subsystem entities select an IBCF, IBCF-3, and forward
the INVITE request with the initial SDP offer to the IBCF-3 according to TS
24.229 [4].

The IBCF-3 uses the procedures in clauses 6.1.4, 6.1.7 and 6.1.9 since a
previous realm instance exists that can be used to bypass a previous MR,
IBCF-2, and bypass is allowed according to operator X and operator Y
agreements, and the previous realm instance match the outgoing realm so that
no local MR is required.
The IBCF-3:
\- uses the connection address and port information for the media line in the
initial SDP offer with the connection-address and port information from the
selected instance 2 as incoming connection address and incoming port
information for the media line;
\- reconstruct the associated codec information for the media line in the
received initial SDP offer from the selected instance 2 as described in clause
5.3, i.e. using the SDP a-lines, b-lines, transport format and list of media
formats of the media line in the received initial SDP offer;
\- deletes the visited-realm instance 3;
\- inserts the incoming codec information into the SDP m-line and associated
attribute lines of the modified initial SDP offer;
\- uses the incoming connection address as the connection address in the SDP
c-line of the forwarded initial SDP offer;
\- uses the incoming port information as port information in the SDP m-line of
the modified initial SDP offer;
\- computes a checksum value for the media line as described in clause 5.6.3
and adds the omr-m-cksum and omr-s-cksum attributes for the media line. The
omr-s-cksum attribute is set to \"0\" since there are no session line
attributes to compute the checksum on; and
\- selects an IBCF, IBCF-4, in the realm \"Xa.operatorX.net\" and forwards the
initial SDP offer according to TS 24.229 [4] to IBCF-4.

# A.5 IMS-ALG bypasses an allocated transcoding MR
## A.5.1 General
This clause provides an example of a call where the UE initiating a call
offers the AMR codec. An IMS-ALG, IBCF-1 in figure A.2.1, adds the AMR-WB
codec to the initial SDP offer and reserves an MR resource.
The terminating UE selects the AMR codec and the IMS-ALG needs to deallocate
the MR and update the terminating UE with the IP addresses of the UE-A in a
realm instance to allow bypassing of the IMS-ALG itself.
Figure A.5.1-1 shows the realm and IP structure used in this example.
Figure A.5.1-1: IP realm and IP structure
## A.5.2 Message flow
The user A at UE-A and the user B at UE-B roams into a visited network X and
both users belongs to the same operator Y.
Preconditions:
\- Both users A and B are registered to the Home IMS network Y via the visited
operator X network;
\- the visited operator X and the operator of user A and B IMS home network Y
have an agreement to allow media to be bypassed using OMR;
\- both users A and B are connected to realm Xa of the visited operator
network X;
\- the AMR codec is allowed and accepted by all involved entities. However,
the local policy of operator X is that the AMR-WB codec shall always be
included in the initial SDP offers from the operator X network; and
\- no B2BUA manipulating SDP is connected in the intermediate IM CN subsystem.
Figure A.5.2-1 shows the message flow for the scenario.
Figure A.5.2-1: Message flow for transcoder with resource reservation, codec
not selected
NOTE: For clarity, the SIP 100 (Trying) messages are not shown in the
signalling flow.
The steps of the flow are as follows:
**1\. INVITE request (UE-A to P-CSCF-A) - see example in table A.5.2-1.**
The UE-A sends a SIP INVITE request according to TS 24.229 [4]. The INVITE
request includes an initial SDP offer proposing the use of the AMR codec and
inband DTMF.

**2\. INVITE request (P-CSCF-A to IBCF-1) - see example in table A.5.2-1.**
The P-CSCF-A uses the procedures in clauses 6.1.5, 6.1.7 and 6.1.9 since no MR
could be bypassed and no MR is allocated.
The P-CSCF-A:
\- uses the connection-address from the SDP c-line as incoming connection-
address;
\- uses the port information from the SDP m-line as incoming port information;
\- uses the codec information from the SDP m-line;
\- inserts the incoming codec information into the SDP m-line and associated
attribute lines of the modified initial SDP offer;
\- uses the incoming connection address as the connection address in the SDP
c-line of the forwarded initial SDP offer, and
\- use the incoming port information as port information in the SDP m-line of
the modified initial SDP offer.
> The P-CSCF-A then selects an IBCF, IBCF-1, in the realm \"Xa.operatorX.net\"
> and forwards the INVITE request with the initial SDP offer to the IBCF-1
> according to TS 24.229 [4].
**3\. INVITE request (IBCF-1 to IBCF-2) - see example in table A.5.2-3**
The IBCF-1 uses the procedures in 6.1.5, 6.1.6 and 6.1.9 since IBCF-1
determines according to local policy that a transcoding MR is needed and that
there is no previous MR to bypass.
The IBCF-1:
\- uses the connection-address from the SDP c-line in the received SDP offer
as incoming connection-address in subsequent steps;
\- uses the port information from the SDP m-line in the received SDP offer as
incoming port information in subsequent steps;
\- uses the codec information from the SDP m-line and associated non-OMR
attribute lines in the received SDP offer as incoming codec information in the
subsequent steps;
\- allocates an MR context with access to the IP realms, nettypes and
addrtypes associated with the incoming connection address and port information
and the outgoing signalling path;
\- inserts the incoming connection address and incoming port information for
the media line into the remote connection address and port information for the
incoming termination on the MR;
\- provides to the MR the incoming codec information;
\- constructs a visited-realm instance 1;
\- replaces the connection address and port information for the media line in
the initial SDP offer with the connection address and port information from
the MR termination on the outgoing side;
\- adds a AMR-WB codec changes to incoming codec information, according to
local policy, taking into account the procedures in clause 5.4, and insert the
changed codec information into the SDP m-line and associated attribute lines
of the modified initial SDP offer;
\- provides to the MR the modified codec information;
\- adds to the modified initial SDP offer a visited-realm instance 2 for the
IP realm associated with the connection address and port information for the
media line in the modified initial SDP offer, including the incoming codec
information encoded according to clause 5.2;
\- computes checksum values as described in clause 5.6.3 and adds the \"omr-s-
cksum\" and \"omr-m-cksum\" attributes for the media line. The \"omr-s-cksum\"
is set to \"0\" since there is no session line attributes to compute the
checksum on; and
\- selects an IBCF, IBCF-2, in the realm \"Xa.operatorX.net\" and forwards the
INVITE request with the modified initial SDP offer to the IBCF-2 according to
TS 24.229 [4].

The IMS-ALG uses the procedures in clauses 6.1.5, 6.1.6 and 6.1.9 since no MR
can be bypassed and a local MR is needed for realm matching.
The IBCF-2:
\- uses the connection-address from the SDP c-line as incoming connection-
address in subsequent steps;
\- uses the port information from the SDP m-line as incoming port information
in subsequent steps;
\- uses the codec information from the SDP m-line and associated non-OMR
attribute lines as incoming codec information in the subsequent steps.
\- allocates an MR context with access to the IP realms, nettypes and
addrtypes associated with the incoming connection address and port information
and the outgoing signalling path;
\- inserts the incoming connection address and incoming port information for
the media line into the remote connection address and port information for the
incoming termination on the MR;
\- provides to the MR the incoming codec information;
\- replaces the connection address and port information for the media line in
the initial SDP offer with the connection address and port information from
the MR termination on the outgoing side;
\- adds to the modified initial SDP offer a visited-realm instance 3 for the
IP realm associated with the connection address and port information for the
media line in the modified initial SDP offer; and
\- computes checksum values as described in clause 5.6.3 and adds the \"omr-s-
cksum\" and \"omr-m-cksum\" attributes for the media line. The \"omr-s-cksum\"
is set to \"0\" since there is no session line attributes to compute the
checksum on.
None of the intermediate IMS CN subsystem entities manipulated with the
initial SDP offer but the identity of user_B@operator_Y.net in the Request-URI
is change to the contact address, i.e. UE-B\@operatorX.net.
The intermediate IMS CN subsystem entities select an IBCF, IBCF-3, in the
realm \"Ya.operatorY.net\" and forward the INVITE request with the initial SDP
offer to the IBCF-3 according to TS 24.229 [4].

**6\. INVITE request (IBCF-3 to IBCF-4) - see example in table A.5.2-6**
The IBCF-3 uses procedures in clauses 6.1.4, 6.1.7 and 6.1.9 since previous
MRs can be bypassed and no local MR is needed for realm matching.
The IBCF-3:
\- uses the connection address and port information from the selected instance
2 for the media line in the initial SDP offer as incoming connection address
and incoming port information for the media line in the subsequent steps. The
instance 2 is selected since it contains more codecs than the visited-realm
instance 1;
\- reconstructs the associated codec information for the media line in the
initial SDP offer from the selected instance 2 according to clause 5.3 and
uses that codec information as incoming codec information in the subsequent
steps;
\- deletes visited-realm instance 3;
\- insert the incoming codec information into the SDP m-line and associated
attribute lines of the modified initial SDP offer;
\- uses the incoming connection address as the connection address in the SDP
c-line of the forwarded initial SDP offer;
\- uses the incoming port information as determined in previous steps as port
information in the SDP m-line of the modified initial SDP offer;
\- computes checksum values as described in clause 5.6.3 and adds the \"omr-s-
cksum\" and \"omr-m-cksum\" attributes for the media line. The \"omr-s-cksum\"
is set to \"0\" since there is no session line attributes to compute the
checksum on; and
\- selects an IBCF, IBCF-4, in the realm \"Xa.operatorX.net\" and forwards the
INVITE request with the initial SDP offer according to TS 24.229 [4] to
IBCF-4.

**7\. INVITE request (IBCF-4 to P-CSCF B) - see example in table A.5.2-7.**
The IBCF-4 uses procedures in clauses 6.1.5, 6.1.7 and 6.1.9 since the
visited-realm with the highest instance number is connected to the same realm
as the IBCF-4 and contains codecs according to the local policy. Using the
visited-realm instance 1 would reduce the number of available codecs. No MR
for realm matching is needed.
The IBCF-4:
\- uses the connection-address from the SDP c-line in the received initial SDP
offer as incoming connection-address in subsequent steps;
\- uses the port information from the SDP m-line in the received initial SDP
offer as incoming port information in subsequent steps;
\- uses the codec information from the SDP m-line and associated non-OMR
attribute lines in the received initial SDP offer as incoming codec
information in the subsequent steps;
\- inserts the incoming codec information into the SDP m-line and associated
attribute lines of the modified initial SDP offer;
\- uses the incoming connection address as the connection address in the SDP
c-line of the forwarded initial SDP offer; and
\- use the incoming port information as determined in previous steps as port
information in the SDP m-line of the modified initial SDP offer; and
\- forwards the INVITE request with the unmodified initial SDP offer to the
P-CSCF-B according to TS 24.229 [4].

The rest of the steps follow the same principles as described in clause A.3.2
steps 17 -- 65.
# A.6 Loopback routeing via an intermediate network
## A.6.1 General
This clause provides an example on how OMR is used to find an optimal media
path when loopback routeing is used and how to preserve signalling paths and
media paths compatible with the existing CS charging model.
The example does not focus on the OMR algorithm as such instead the focus is
on the selection and configuration of IP realm names. The example only
describes the message flow on the originating side.
Figure A.6.1-1 shows the IP realm and IP configuration used in this example.
Figure A.6.1-1: IP realm and IP address configurations
## A.6.2 Message flow
The user A at UE-A is roaming into a visited network V. The user A is a
subscriber of operator H.
Preconditions in this example:
\- The user A is registered to the Home IMS network H via the visited operator
V network and the IC network X; The IC network does not store any registration
information.
\- P-CSCF-A and S-CSCF support loopback routeing;
\- IBCF-1, IBCF-2, IBCF-3, IBCF-4, IBCF-5, IC-1 and IC-2 support OMR and all
networks supports loopback routeing;
\- IBCF-1, IBCF-4 and IBCF-5 are instances in the same physical IBCF in the
visited network V;
\- IC-1 and IC-2 are instances in the same physical IC hub;
\- IBCF-2 and IBCF-3 are instances in the same physical IBCF in the home
network H; and
\- no B2BUA manipulating SDP is connected in the home operator H network.
The \"iotl\" SIP URI parameter specified in IETF RFC 7549 [22] is included in
the message flow in order to assist in determine the policy.
Figure A.6.2-1 shows the message flow for the scenario.
Figure A.6.2-1: Message flow for loopback routeing via an IC network
NOTE: For clarity, the SIP 100 (Trying) messages are not shown in the
signalling flow.
The steps of the flow are as follows:
**1\. INVITE request (UE-A to P-CSCF-A) - see example in table A.6.2-1.**
The user A at UE-A initiates a call. The UE-A sends an initial INVITE request
containing an initial SDP offer to the P-CSCF-A according to TS 24.229 [4].

The S-CCSCF sends the 183 (Session Progress) response according to TS 24.229
[4] to the IBCF-1. Neither the IBCF-2 nor IC-1 updates the initial SDP answer.

When the IBCF-1 receives the 183 (Session Progress) response the IBCF-1
updates the initial SDP answer.
The IBCF-1:
\- replaces the received invalid IPv4 address with the IP address received in
the visited-realm instance 1; and
\- removes all OMR specific attributes since the initial SDP offer from
P-CSCF-A did not contain any OMR specific attributes.
The IBCF-1 sends the 183 (Session Progress) response with the modified initial
SDP answer according to TS 24.229 [4] to the P-CSCF-A.

When the P-CSCF-A receives the 183 (Session Progress) response the P-CSCF
authorizes the resources;
The P-CSCF-A sends the 183 (Session Progress) response with the unmodified
initial SDP answer according to TS 24.229 [4] to the UE-A.

> **21\. PRACK requests and SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP PRACK request**
The PRACK is sent without any SDP offer/SDP answer between the UE-A and IBCF-5
according to TS 24.229 [4].
> **22\. UPDATE request and SIP 200 (OK) response to the SIP UPDATE request**
The UPDATE request and the 200 (OK) response to the UPDATE request is sent
with a subsequent SDP offer and subsequent SDP answer following the same
principle as in clause A.3.2 steps 33 - 48 but now indicating that resources
are reserved at UE-A.
> **23\. 180 (Ringing) response to INVITE request**
The remote UE sends a 180 (Ringing) response when resources are reserved. The
remote UE does not have to send an UPDATE request to indicate that resources
are reserved since the subsequent SDP offer did not include the \"a=conf\"
attribute.
When the IBCF-5 receives the response the IBCF-5 forwards the response to the
UE-A via all intermediate nodes. There are no OMR specific actions since the
180 (Ringing) response does not contain any SDP.
> **24\. 200 (OK) response to INVITE request and the SIP ACK request**
The 200 (OK) response to the initial INVITE request is sent according to TS
24.229 [4] between the IBCF-5 and UE-A via all intermediate nodes as specified
in TS 24.229 [4].
The ACK request is sent according to TS 24.229 [4] between the UE-A and IBCF-5
via all intermediate nodes as specified in TS 24.229 [4].
