create a subscription for an \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription\" according
to the information in message body. The NnwdafEventsSubscription data
structure provided in the request body shall include:
\- an URI where to receive the requested notifications as \"notificationURI\"
attribute; and
\- a description of the subscribed events as \"eventSubscriptions\" attribute
that, for each event, the EventSubscription data type shall include:
1) an event identifier as \"event\" attribute; and
2) if the event notification method \"PERIODIC\" is selected via the
\"notificationMethod\" attribute, repetition period as \"repetitionPeriod\"
attribute;
\- and may include:
1) maximum number of objects in the \"maxObjectNbr\" attribute;
2) maximum number of SUPIs expected for an analytics report in the
\"maxSupiNbr\" attribute;
3) identification of time window to which the subscription applies via

Upon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/subscriptions\" as Resource URI and
NnwdafEventsSubscription data structure as request body, the NWDAF shall:
\- create a new subscription;
\- assign an event subscriptionId; and
\- store the subscription.
If the NWDAF created an \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription\" resource, the
NWDAF shall respond with \"201 Created\" status code with the message body
containing a representation of the created subscription, as shown in figure
4.2.2.2.2-1, step 2. If not all the requested analytics events in the
subscription are accepted, then the NWDAF may include the \"failEventReports\"
attribute indicating the event(s) for which the subscription failed and the
associated reason(s). The NWDAF shall include a Location HTTP header field.
The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created subscription
i.e. \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\". If the
immediate reporting indication in the \"immRep\" attribute within the
\"evtReq\" attribute sets to true in the event subscription, the NWDAF shall
include the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST
response.
When the \"notifFlag\" attribute is included and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the
request, the NWDAF shall mute the event notification and store the available
events.
If the analytics target period provided in the body of the HTTP POST request
includes the start time in the past and the end time in the future, the NWDAF
shall reject the request with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response including
the \"cause\" attribute set to \"BOTH_STAT_PRED_NOT_ALLOWED\".
If the statistics in the past is requested but the necessary data to perform
the service is unavailable, the NWDAF shall reject the request with an HTTP
\"500 Internal Server Error\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set
to \"UNAVAILABLE_DATA\".
##### 4.2.2.2.3 Update subscription for event notifications
Figure 4.2.2.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the NWDAF to update the subscription for event notifications (see
also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).
Figure 4.2.2.2.3-1: NF service consumer updates subscription to notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Subscribe
service operation to update subscription to event notifications. The NF
service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource
URI representing the \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription\", as shown in
figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step 1, to update the subscription for an \"Individual
NWDAF Event Subscription\" resource identified by the {subscriptionId}. The
NnwdafEventsSubscription data structure provided in the request body shall
include the same contents as described in clause 4.2.2.2.2:
Upon the reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource
URI and NnwdafEventsSubscription data structure as request body, the NWDAF
shall:
\- update the subscription of corresponding subscriptionId; and
\- store the subscription.
NOTE: The \"notificationURI\" attribute within the NnwdafEventsSubscription
data structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are
sent to a new NF service consumer.
If the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP PUT
request, the NWDAF shall update an \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription\"
resource, and shall respond with:
a) HTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing a
representation of the updated subscription, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1,
step 2a. If not all the requested analytics events in the subscription are
modified successfully, then the NWDAF may include the \"failEventReports\"
attribute indicating the event(s) for which the modification failed and the
associated reason(s); or
b) HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2.3-1, step
2b.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP PUT request, the NWDAF shall send an
HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
If the analytics target period provided in the body of the HTTP POST request
includes the start time in the past and the end time in the future, the NWDAF
shall reject the request with an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" response including
the \"cause\" attribute set to \"BOTH_STAT_PRED_NOT_ALLOWED\".
If the statistics in the past is requested but the necessary data to perform
the service is unavailable, the NWDAF shall reject the request with an HTTP
\"500 Internal Server Error\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set
to \"UNAVAILABLE_DATA\".
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NWDAF determines the received
HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect
response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
When the \"notifFlag\" attribute is included in the request with the value
\"DEACTIVATE\", the NWDAF shall mute the event notification and store the
available events; if it is set to the value \"RETRIEVAL\", the NWDAF shall
send the stored events to the NF service consumer, mute the event notification
again and store available events; if it is set to the value \"ACTIVATE\" and
the event notifications are muted (due to a previously received \"DECATIVATE\"
value), the NWDAF shall unmute the event notification, i.e. start sending
again notifications for available events.
#### 4.2.2.3 Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Unsubscribe service operation
##### 4.2.2.3.1 General
The Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Unsubscribe service operation is used by an NF
service consumer to unsubscribe from event notifications.
##### 4.2.2.3.2 Unsubscribe from event notifications
Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the NWDAF to unsubscribe from event notifications (see also 3GPP TS
23.288 [17]).
{width="6.0256944444444445in" height="1.64375in"}
Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes from notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_UnSubscribe
service operation to unsubscribe to event notifications. The NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource
URI, where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the event subscriptionId of the existing
subscription that is to be deleted.
Upon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource
URI, if the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE
request, the NWDAF shall:
\- remove the corresponding subscription; and
\- respond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall send
an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NWDAF determines the received
HTTP DELETE request needs to be redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP
redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
#### 4.2.2.4 Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Notify service operation
##### 4.2.2.4.1 General
The Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Notify service operation is used by an NWDAF to
notify NF consumers about subscribed events or by the target NWDAF to notify
the consumer of the successful analytics subscription transfer.
##### 4.2.2.4.2 Notification about subscribed event
Figure 4.2.2.4.2-1 shows a scenario where the NWDAF sends a request to the NF
service consumer to notify for event notifications or notify for the
successful analytics subscription transfer (see also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).

information any longer. In this case, the NWDAF may send an HTTP POST request
as shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.2.4.2-1, which shall only provide (within the
EventNotification data type in the NnwdafEventsSubscriptionNotification data
type) an indication of the failure event via the \"event\" attribute and the
corresponding failure reason via a \"failNotifyCode\" attribute, and may also
provide a minimum time interval recommended by the NWDAF for the event via a
\"rvWaitTime\" attribute which will be used by the NF service consumer to
determine the time when analytics information is needed in similar future
analytics subscriptions.
Upon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{notificationURI}\" as
Resource URI and NnwdafEventsSubscriptionNotification data structure as
request body, if the NF service consumer successfully processed and accepted
the received HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer shall:
\- store the notification; and
\- respond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NF service consumer
shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the NF service consumer determines
the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected, the NF service consumer
shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6].
#### 4.2.2.5 Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer service operation
##### 4.2.2.5.1 General
The Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer service operation is used by an NWDAF
instance to request the transfer of analytics subscription(s) to another NWDAF
instance. If the source NWDAF discovers that the analytics consumer may change
concurrently to this procedure, the source NWDAF should not perform the
procedure. In such a case, the source NWDAF may send a message to indicate to
the analytics consumer that it will not serve this subscription anymore.
NOTE 1: To discover the possible change of analytics consumer, if the
Analytics ID is UE related, the source NWDAF takes actions responding to
external trigger (such as UE mobility), for example, checking if the Target of
Analytics Reporting is still within the serving area of the analytics
consumer, if the serving area information of the consumer is available.
NOTE 2: Handling of overload situation or preparation for a graceful shutdown
are preferably executed inside an NWDAF Set, when available, therefore, not
requiring an analytics subscription transfer as described in this clause.
##### 4.2.2.5.2 Creation of request for analytics subscription transfer
Figure 4.2.2.5.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF Service Consumer (e.g. NWDAF)
sends a request to the NWDAF to request the transfer of analytics
subscription(s) from the NF Service Consumer to the NF Service Producer (see
also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).
Figure 4.2.2.5.2-1: NF service consumer requests an analytics subscription
transfer
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer
service operation to request the transfer of analytics subscription(s). The NF
service consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/transfers\" as Resource URI representing the
\"NWDAF Event Subscription Transfers\", as shown in figure 4.2.2.5.2-1, step
1, to create a request for an \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription Transfer\"
according to the information in the message body. The
AnalyticsSubscriptionsTransfer data structure provided in the request body
shall include:
\- information about the subscription(s) transfer request as
\"subsTransInfos\" attribute, which, for each subscription that is requested
to be transferred, shall include:
a) the type of the transfer request (i.e. if it is a request for transfer
preparation or transfer execution) in the \"transReqType\" attribute;
b) information about the analytics subscription in the \"nwdafEvSub\"
attribute, its contents being as defined for the NnwdafEventsSubscription data
structure in clause 4.2.2.2.2;
c) the NF instance identifer of the consumer of the analytics subscription in
the \"consumerId\" attribute;
and may include:
a) analytics context identifier information about the context that is
available at the NF service consumer in the \"contextId\" attribute;
b) NF instance identifer(s) of active data source(s) the NF service consumer
is currently using for the analytics of this analytics subscription in the
\"sourceNfIds\" attribute;
c) NF set identifer(s) of active data source(s) the NF service consumer is
currently using for the analytics of this analytics subscription in the
\"sourceSetIds\" attribute;
d) information identifying the ML model(s) that the NF service consumer is
currently using for the analytics in the \"modelInfos\" attribute;
Upon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/transfers\" as Resource URI and
AnalyticsSubscriptionsTransfer data structure as request body, in the
successful case the NWDAF shall:
\- if the \"transReqType\" attribute has the value PREPARE, perform the steps
required for the preparation of an analytics subscription transfer as
described in clause 5.4.3 of TS 29.552 [25], create a new Individual NWDAF
Event Subscription Transfer resource and send an HTTP \"201 Created\" response
with the URI for the created resource in the \"Location\" header field, as
shown in figure 4.2.2.5.2-1, step 2a;
\- if the \"transReqType\" attribute has the value TRANSFER, perform the steps
required for the execution of an analytics subscription transfer as described
in clause 5.4.2 of TS 29.552 [25], and send an HTTP \"204 No Content\"
response, as shown in figure 4.2.2.5.2-1, step 2b.
\'If errors occur when processing the HTTP POST request, the NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
##### 4.2.2.5.3 Update a request for analytics subscription transfer
Figure 4.2.2.5.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF Service Consumer (e.g. NWDAF)
sends a request to the NWDAF to update a request for the transfer of analytics
subscription(s) from the NF Service Consumer to the NF Service Producer (see
also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).
Figure 4.2.2.5.3-1: NF service consumer updates a request for an analytics
subscription transfer
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer
service operation to update a request for the transfer of analytics
subscription(s). The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with
\"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-eventssubscription/\/transfers/{transferId}\"
as Resource URI representing the \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription
Transfer\", as shown in figure 4.2.2.5.3-1, step 1, to update the \"Individual
NWDAF Event Subscription Transfer\" resource identified by the {transferId}.
The AnalyticsSubscriptionsTransfer data structure provided in the request body
shall include the same contents as described in clause 4.2.2.5.2.
Upon the reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/transfers/{transferId}\" as Resource URI and
AnalyticsSubscriptionsTransfer data structure as request body, the NWDAF
shall:
\- if the \"transReqType\" attribute has the value PREPARE, perform the steps
required for the preparation of an analytics subscription transfer as
described in clause 5.4.3 of TS 29.552 [25], update the Individual NWDAF Event
Subscription Transfer resource identified by \"transferId\", and send an HTTP
\"204 No Content\" response, as shown in figure 4.2.2.5.3-1, step 2;
\- if the \"transReqType\" attribute has the value TRANSFER, perform the steps
required for the execution of an analytics subscription transfer as described
in clause 5.4.3 of TS 29.552 [25], remove the Individual NWDAF Event
Subscription Transfer resource identified by \"transferId\", and send an HTTP
\"204 No Content\" response, as shown in figure 4.2.2.5.3-1, step 2.
\'If errors occur when processing the HTTP PUT request, the NWDAF shall send
an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
If the NWDAF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected,
the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
##### 4.2.2.5.4 Cancel a request for analytics subscription transfer
Figure 4.2.2.5.4-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer (e.g. NWDAF)
sends a request to the NWDAF to cancel a request for the transfer of analytics
subscription(s) from the NF service consumer to the NF Service Producer (see
also 3GPP TS 23.288 [17]).
Figure 4.2.2.5.4-1: NF service consumer cancels a request for an analytics
subscription transfer
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription_Transfer
service operation to cancel a request for the transfer of analytics
subscription(s). The NF service consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request
with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/transfers/{transferId}\" as Resource URI
representing the \"Individual NWDAF Event Subscription Transfer\", as shown in
figure 4.2.2.5.4-1, step 1, to cancel the \"Individual NWDAF Event
Subscription Transfer\" resource identified by the {transferId}.
Upon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
eventssubscription/\/transfers/{transferId}\" as Resource URI, if
the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE
request, the NWDAF shall:
\- if applicable, delete any analytics data that is no longer needed and
unsubscribe to entities for data collection or ML model acquisition, if the
subscriptions are not needed for other active analytics subscriptions;
\- remove the corresponding Individual NWDAF Event Subscription Transfer
resource; and
\- respond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, as shown in figure
4.2.2.5.4-1, step 2.
\'If errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall
send an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
If the NWDAF determines the received HTTP DELETE request needs to be
redirected, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in
clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].

#### 4.4.2.2 Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation
##### 4.4.2.2.1 General
The Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe service operation is used by an NF service
consumer to create or update a subscription for data notifications from the
NWDAF.
##### 4.4.2.2.2 Subscription for data notifications
Figure 4.4.2.2.2-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a
request to the NWDAF to subscribe for data notification(s).
Figure 4.4.2.2.2-1: NF service consumer subscribes to data notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe
service operation to subscribe to data notification(s). The NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
datamanagement/\/subscriptions\" as Resource URI representing the
\"NWDAF Data Management Subscriptions\", as shown in figure 4.4.2.2.2-1, step
1, to create a subscription for an \"Individual NWDAF Data Management
Subscription\" according to the information in message body.
The NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure provided in the request body
shall include:
\- an URI where to receive the requested notifications as \"notificURI\"
attribute;
\- notification correlation identfier within the \"notifCorrId\" attribute;
and
\- one of the following:
\- analytics subscription information to be used to determine which data shall
be collected and reported within the \"anaSub\" attribute;
> \- data subscription information within the \"dataSub\" attribute;
The NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure provided in the request body may
include:
\- formatting instructions within the \"formatInstruct\" attribute;
\- processing instructions within the \"procInstruct\" attribute;
\- one of the following identifiers related to the ADRF:
\- ADRF instance identifier within the \"adrfId\" attribute;
\- ADRF set identifier within the \"adrfSetId\" attribute;
\- one of the following target identifiers:
\- NF instance identifier within the \"targetNfId\" attribute;
\- NF set identifier within the \"targetNfSetId\" attribute;
\- time window of the occurrence of the requested data collection within the
\"timePeriod" attribute;
\- the purpose of data collection within the \"dataCollectPurposes\"
attribute.
Upon the reception of an HTTP POST request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
datamanagement/\/subscriptions\" as Resource URI and
NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure as request body, the NWDAF shall use
the contents of the request to determine whether the subscription can already
be served or interactions with the ADRF and/or data sources are required. If
the NWDAF cannot use the contents of the request to determine this, the NWDAF
shall send an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" error response including the \"cause\"
attribute set to \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\".
NOTE: The \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\" error can occur, for example, in
the case where the \"dataSub\" or \"anaSub\" attributes are provided, when the
request is syntactically valid and there is no NWDAF internal error, but the
NWDAF can neither find an existing subscription to a data source nor construct
one based on the received subscription contents.
If the NWDAF determines that the subscription can already be served (without
requiring further interactions with ADRF and/or data sources) or a successful
response from the ADRF and/or data sources is received for the creation or
modification of subscription(s) to serve this subscription, the NWDAF shall:
\- create a new subscription;
\- assign a subscriptionId;
\- store the subscription.
If the NWDAF created an \"Individual NWDAF Data Management Subscription\"
resource, the NWDAF shall respond with \"201 Created\" with the message body
containing a representation of the created subscription, as shown in figure
4.4.2.2.2-1, step 2. The NWDAF shall include a Location HTTP header field. The
Location header field shall contain the URI of the created subscription i.e.
\"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
datamanagement/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\". If an immediate
reporting indication is provided in the subscription, the NWDAF shall include
the reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST response.
If an error occurs when processing the HTTP POST request, the NWDAF shall send
an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.3.7.
##### 4.4.2.2.3 Update subscription for data notifications
Figure 4.4.2.2.3-1 shows a scenario where the NF service consumer sends a

Figure 4.4.2.2.3-1: NF service consumer updates subscription to data
notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Subscribe
service operation to update subscription to data notifications. The NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
datamanagement/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI
representing the \"Individual NWDAF Data Management Subscription\", as shown
in figure 4.4.2.2.3-1, step 1, to update the subscription for an \"Individual
NWDAF Data Management Subscription\" resource identified by the
{subscriptionId}. The NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure provided in the
request body shall include the same contents as described in clause 4.4.2.2.2.
Upon the reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
datamanagement/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI
and NnwdafDataManagementSubsc data structure as request body, the NWDAF shall
use the contents of the request to determine whether the updated subscription
can already be served or interactions with the ADRF and/or data sources are
required. If the NWDAF cannot use the contents of the request to determine
this, the NWDAF shall send an HTTP \"400 Bad Request\" error response
including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\".
NOTE: The \"SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED\" error can occur, for example, in
the case when the \"dataSub\" or \"anaSub\" attributes are provided, when the
request is syntactically valid and there is no NWDAF internal error, but the
NWDAF can neither find an existing subscription to a data source nor construct
one based on the received subscription contents.
If the NWDAF determines that the updated subscription can already be served
(without requiring further interactions with the ADRF and/or data sources) or
a successful response from the ADRF and/or data sources is received for the
creation or modification of subscription(s) to serve this subscription, the
NWDAF shall:
\- update the subscription of corresponding subscriptionId; and
\- store the subscription.
If the NWDAF successfully processed and accepted the received HTTP PUT
request, the NWDAF shall update an \"Individual NWDAF Data Management
Subscription\" resource, and shall respond with:
a) HTTP \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing a
representation of the updated subscription, as shown in figure 4.4.2.2.3-1,
step 2a; or
b) HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code, as shown in figure 4.4.2.2.3-1, step
2b.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP PUT request, the NWDAF shall send an
HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.3.7.
If the NWDAF determines the received HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected,
the NWDAF shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].

request to the NWDAF to unsubscribe from data notifications.
Figure 4.4.2.3.2-1: NF service consumer unsubscribes from data notifications
The NF service consumer shall invoke the Nnwdaf_DataManagement_Unsubscribe
service operation to unsubscribe from data notifications. The NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/nnwdaf-
datamanagement/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\" as Resource URI,
where \"{subscriptionId}\" is the identifier of the existing subscription that
is to be deleted.
Upon the reception of an HTTP DELETE request, if the NWDAF successfully
processed and accepted the received HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall:
\- remove the corresponding subscription;
\- respond with HTTP \"204 No Content\" status.
If errors occur when processing the HTTP DELETE request, the NWDAF shall send
an HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.3.7.

As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [13] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2
protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [14]), based on local configuration, using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510
[12]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF service consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [12], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF service consumer used for
discovering the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription service.
The Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription API defines a single scope \"nnwdaf-
eventssubscription\" for the entire service, and it does not define any
additional scopes at resource or operation level.

### 5.2.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [13] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol
(see IETF RFC 6749 [14]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [12])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF service consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [12], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF service consumer used for
discovering the Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo service.
The Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo API defines a single scope \"nnwdaf-analyticsinfo\"
for the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
## 5.3 Nnwdaf_DataManagement Service API
### 5.3.1 Introduction
The Nnwdaf_DataManagement service shall use the Nnwdaf_DataManagement API.

specified in the present specification as specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6]. The use of the JSON format shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/json\".
\"Problem Details\" JSON object shall be used to indicate additional details
of the error in a HTTP response body and shall be signalled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7807 [15].
#### 5.3.2.3 HTTP custom headers
The Nnwdaf_DataManagement service API shall support mandatory HTTP custom
header fields specified in clause 5.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6] and may

### 5.3.7 Error handling
#### 5.3.7.1 General
HTTP error handling shall be supported as specified in clause 5.2.4 of TS
29.500 [6].
For the Nnwdaf_DataManagement API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in clause 4.8 of TS 29.501 [7]. Protocol errors and application
errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of TS 29.500 [6] shall be supported for an
HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are specified as mandatory
for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of TS 29.500 [6]. In addition, the
requirements in the following clauses shall apply.
#### 5.3.7.2 Protocol Errors
In this Release of the specification, there are no additional protocol errors
applicable for the Nnwdaf_DataManagement API.
#### 5.3.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nnwdaf_DataManagement API are listed in
table 5.3.7.3-1.
Table 5.3.7.3-1: Application errors
* * *
Application Error HTTP status code Description SUBSCRIPTION_CANNOT_BE_SERVED
400 Bad Request Indicates that the NWDAF cannot use the contents of the
request to either a) determine whether the subscription can already be served
or interactions with the ADRF and/or data sources are required or b) determine
what interactions with the ADRF and/or data sources are required (if it has
determined that they are required). NOTE: Including a \"ProblemDetails\" data
structure with the \"cause\" attribute in the HTTP response is optional unless
explicitly mandated in the service operation clauses.
* * *
### 5.3.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.3.8-1 are defined for the
Nnwdaf_DataManagement API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility
mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
Table 5.3.8-1: Supported Features
* * *
Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
### 5.3.9 Security
As indicated in TS 33.501 [13] and TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nnwdaf_DataManagement API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol
(see IETF RFC 6749 [14]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see TS 29.510 [12]) plays
the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF service consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nnwdaf_DataManagement API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in TS 29.510 [12], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF service consumer used for
discovering the Nnwdaf_DataManagement service.
The Nnwdaf_DataManagement API defines a single scope \"nnwdaf-datamanagement\"
for the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
## 5.4 Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision Service API
### 5.4.1 Introduction
The Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service shall use the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision API.
The API URI of the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\**
The request URIs used in each HTTP requests from the NF service consumer
towards the NWDAF shall have the Resource URI structure defined in clause
4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [7], i.e.:
> **{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [7].
\- The\ shall be \"nnwdaf-mlmodelprovision\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
5.4.3.
### 5.4.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 5.4.2.1 General
HTTP/2, IETF RFC 7540 [9], shall be used as specified in clause 5 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
The OpenAPI [11] specification of HTTP messages and content bodies for the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision is contained in Annex A.
#### 5.4.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 5.4.2.2.1 General
See clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6] for the usage of HTTP standard headers.
##### 5.4.2.2.2 Content type
JSON, IETF RFC 8259 [10], shall be used as content type of the HTTP bodies
specified in the present specification as specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6]. The use of the JSON format shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/json\".
\"Problem Details\" JSON object shall be used to indicate additional details
of the error in a HTTP response body and shall be signalled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7807 [15].
#### 5.4.2.3 HTTP custom headers
The Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service API shall support mandatory HTTP custom
header fields specified in clause 5.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6] and may
support HTTP custom header fields specified in clause 5.2.3.3 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [6].
In this release of the specification, no specific custom headers are defined
for the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service API.
### 5.4.3 Resources
#### 5.4.3.1 Resource Structure

\"ProblemDetails\" data structure with the \"cause\" attribute in the HTTP
response is optional unless explicitly mandated in the service operation
clauses.

### 5.4.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.4.8-1 are defined for the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility
mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [6].
Table 5.4.8-1: Supported Features

### 5.4.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [13] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [6], the access to the
Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol
(see IETF RFC 6749 [14]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [12])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, a n NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services
offered by the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [12], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision service.
The Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision API defines a single scope \"nnwdaf-
mlmodelprovision\" for the entire service, and it does not define any
additional scopes at resource or operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
The present Annex contains an OpenAPI [11] specification of HTTP messages and
content bodies used by the Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription, the
Nnwdaf_AnalyticsInfo, Nnwdaf_DataManagement and Nnwdaf_MLModelProvision APIs.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository, that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900
[16] and clause 5.3.1 of the 3GPP TS 29.501 [7] for further information).
