# 1 Scope
The present document analyses and evaluates the definition of a Reference Data
Model (RDM) for Ud interface between Front-Ends (FEs) for the HSS application
and the User Data Repository (UDR).
The stage 3 of the Ud interface in the User Data Convergence (UDC
architecture) is defined in 3GPP TS 29.335 [2].
The Reference Data Model (RDM) shall comply with the Common Baseline
Information Model for UDC as defined in 3GPP TS 32.182 [3] and it shall follow
the concepts of the Framework for Model Handling and Management as defined in
3GPP TS 32.181 [4].
The analysis will comprise the general considerations impacting the RDM for
HSS.
The analysis will comprise the following topics:
\- The general considerations impacting the RDM for HSS;
\- Attributes definition: names, syntax, semantics;
\- Object classes & Directory Information Tree: object classes names,
attributes grouping, LDAP entries, Distinguished Names and Relative
Distinguished Names.
Directory information trees, object classes and attributes in this report
should be considered informative since they are subject to additions and/or
modification depending on the specific implementation as illustrated in the
presented alternatives in this technical report. Even the assignment of
attributes to object classes may be redistributed, for example,because the
normalization of object classes across different domains may result in
attributes being moved to a superclass. Naming is provisional. Diagrams used
and naming convention are not standardized.

# 4 General considerations
## 4.1 General syntax definitions
The LDAP attributes in this document are defined as having a syntax specified
in IETF RFC 4517 [6] or a derived syntax that will be specified in this
section. The description of a derived syntax will contain the name of the IETF
RFC 4517 [6] syntax from which it was derived as well as any additional
structure and value constraints. Syntax names should follow the rules set by
IETF RFC 4517 [6] (mixed case with first letter of word capitalized), e.g.
NumericString.

## 4.2 MMTEL data
### 4.2.1 Introduction
The specification of the MMTEL data in the Reference Data Model over Ud has to
define for which Application FEs it will be applied. Two cases are identified.
\- MMTEL data specification over Ud applies to the Ud interface between a
Telephony Application Server Front-end (TAS-FE) and the UDR.
\- MMTEL data specification over Ud applies to the Ud interface between a HSS-
FE (supporting IMS) and the UDR.
### 4.2.2 MMTEL data with a TAS-FE
The Ud interface supported by a TAS is an alternative way to store its MMTEL
data in a UDR instead of using the Sh interface and an HSS-FE. For this
purpose another protocol (i.e. reusing Ud protocol) to centrally store MMTEL
Data in addition to Sh has to be assessed and confirmed. This is out of the
scope in the present release of the specifications.
### 4.2.3 MMTEL data with an HSS-FE
With a HSS-FE, SMMTEL data are transported over a Sh interface as transparent
data within repository data. Then, regarding to the storage on the UDR by the
HSS-FE, two sub-cases are identified:
\- It is normally stored as transparent data in the UDR in the same way as any
other transparent data coming from an AS over Sh, so not requiring a data
modelling of the MMTEL data over the Ud between a HSS-FE and the UDR.
\- The transparent data is analysed by the HSS-FE application logic and
translated into data complying with the MMTEL RDM over Ud. In the other way,
the HSS-FE application logic builds a Sh transparent data from the MMTEL data
retrieved from the UDR and complying with the MMTEL RDM over Ud. It is to be
noted that the concept of transparent data that still applies to Sh is no more
applied on the transparent storage in the HSS in this sub-case.
To address the second sub-case, the HSS-FE will rely on the standardisation of
MMTEL Data over Sh in 3GPP TS 29.364 [19]. Two coding options are defined, a
binary one and a XML one. An objective is that the same MMTEL RDM over Ud can
be mapped with both options. The same MMTEL RDM should also be applicable to
the case described in 4.2.2. This is out of the scope in the present release
of the specifications.
With the XML option, the data configuring each of the CDIV and CB MMTEL
Services is structured in a set of multiple rules, each rule may contain
multiple conditions and an action, structure that was not retained for the
binary option aimed to handle the subset of MMTEL services corresponding to
PSTN/ISDN and CS supplementary services.
How the MMTEL RDM over Ud can address the configuration data for CDIV and CB
services for both the XML and the binary option is out of the scope in the
present release of the specifications.
### 4.2.4 MMTEL Data and CS Supplementary Services data
In some cases, the supplementary services execution and/or their configuration
when user is in the CS domain may have to rely on the CS supplementary
services and not MMTEL ones. It may drive to maintain the consistency between
the MMTEL services and the CS supplementary services. Two approaches that
impact RDM for Ud may be considered:
\- MMTEL Data and CS supplementary Service data are considered as separate
data in the RDM for Ud, considering that their consistency will be handled by
the concerned application logics. This approach may be more in line with
current 3GPP specifications where CS supplementary Services and MMTEL services
are defined in different 3GPP specifications.
\- A subset of MMTEL data and CS supplementary service data are merged in the
RDM over Ud and describe a supplementary service independently of the access
(CS or PS). This approach may impact stage 1 and stage 2 specifications on
supplementary services.
Which one of the two approaches is the most relevant and if it impacts
existing specifications on supplementary services (CS and MMTEL) is out of the
scope in the present release of the specifications.
### 4.2.5 Supplementary Services RDM principle
It should be possible to define the Supplementary Services that are common to
MMTEL and CS only once and **not separately in the Reference Data Model. Using
this approach the synchronization of common MMTEL and CS Supplementary
Services is implicitly reached**. At the same time, it should be possible to
have separate Supplementary Services data for MMTEL and CS in order that the
operators could provide differentiated services. The operator has to choose
between these alternatives. **The RDM specification for MMTEL and CS
Supplementary services should allow these two approaches.**
**Only a subset of MMTEL Supplementary Services defined in [19] is shared with
the Circuit domain.**
Here are described three possible structures of the RDM.
Figure 4.2.5-1: Reference Data Model referring to MMTEL services
Figure 4.2.5-2: Reference Data Model referring to CS services
Figure 4.2.5-3: Reference Data Model referring to the common services
Depending on the implementation any of the above data structures for MMTEL and
CS SS or a combination of them can be selected for the RDM.

Table 5.1-1
Derived Syntax name Description
* * *
IMSI This syntax is used to represent international mobile subscriber identity
(IMSI) [7] and is derived from the NumericString syntax [6]. The structure is
further constrained to a maximum length of 15 and the values are further
constrained to decimal digits (0 through 9) only. PublicIdentity This syntax
is used to represent the public identity of a user in the IMS and is derived
from the PrintableString syntax [6]. The structure is further constrained to a
SIP URI (with the format defined in IETF RFC 3261 [20] and IETF RFC 2396 [21])
or a TEL URI (with the format defined in IETF RFC 3966 [22]). Both SIP URI and
TEL URI shall be in canonical form, as described in 3GPP TS 23.003 [7].
PrivateIdentity This syntax is used to represent the private identity of a
user in the IMS and is derived from the PrintableString syntax [6]. The
structure is further constrained to a NAI with the form username\@realm as
specified in IETF RFC 4282 [23]. E164Number This syntax is used to represent
an E.164 Number and is derived from the NumericString syntax [6]. The
structure is further constrained to a maximum length of 15 and the values are
further constrained to decimal digits (0 through 9) only.
# 6 UDC Service Profile
## 6.1 Object classes and their attributes
Object classes and attributes for UDC Service Profile are out of scope of the
present release.
## 6.2 Directory Information Tree
### 6.2.1 Alternative A
Figure 6.2.1-1: DIT Structure for UDC with alternative A
For definition of End User see 3GPP TS 32.182 [3].
### 6.2.2 Alternative B
In this alternative, the parent of the different domain data entities is a
Subscription entity. This Subscription entity may be not limited to one user,
for example, IMS data belongs to a IMS subscription that, according to TS
23.228, may be multiuser. How to support subscription with several IMS users
is not described in the present clause.
It introduces privateIdentityAlias and publicIdentityAlias entities that cover
Private and Public Service Identities as well as Private and Public User
Identities.
Figure 6.2.2-1: DIT Structure for UDC with alternative B
### 6.2.3 Alternative C
In alternative C, as for alternative B, the diagram contains Subscription,
privateIdentityAlias and publicIdentityAlias entities. How to support
subscription with several IMS users is not described in the present clause.
The different domains for data are organised differently. This alternative
allows attributes that are applicable to several domains to be defined once.
For example:
\- an attribute that is the same in the GPRS and EPS domains should be defined
in the entity PS-Data
\- an attribute that is the same in the CS and PS domains should be defined in
the entity Access-Data.
The compatibility with new 3GPP releases extending the use of data defined for
a domain to other domains is out of the scope of the present document.
Figure 6.2.3-1: DIT Structure for UDC with alternative C
### 6.2.4 Alternative D
In this alternative, the parent of the different domain data entities is a
Subscription entity. This Subscription entity may not limited to one user, for
example, IMS data belongs to a IMS subscription that, according to 3GPP TS
23.228, may be multiuser.
The RDN of the Individual user data classes AuC-Data, CS-Data, PS-Data and
EPS-Data is defined with the IMSI + svcType in order to allow for multiuser.
The Alias MSISDN class, in addition to providing a reference to the
Subscription object, also contain an IMSI attribute. This is done to assist in
MSISDN based message processing, such as MAP Send Routing Info. i.e., such a
request would have to search for the Alias MSISDN object to obtain the
subscriber\'s IMSI prior to obtaining the specific SvcType class associated
with the IMSI.

## 11.2 Directory Information Tree
### 11.2.0 General
In the following sub-sections more object classes may be needed and are left
to implementations. Different alternatives are described in order to show how
different implementations may differ.
### 11.2.1 Alternative A
Figure 11.2.1-1: DIT Structure for IMS-Data with Alternative A
The dotted arrow indicates the relationship between PublicIdentity and
PrivateIdentity which is expressed by the attributes PrivateIdList and
PublicIdList.
The superior OCL description of the ImsData object class and some more
detailed description of object classes and attributes are FFS.
### 11.2.2 Alternative B
Figure 11.2.2-1: DIT Structure for IMS-Data with Alternative B
CoreNet-SubscribedMediaProfileId, CoreNet-ServiceIdList and
SharedFilterCriteriaSets are optional attributes in Service Profile entry.
The dotted arrow indicates the relationship between PublicIdentity and
PrivateIdentity which is expressed by the attributes PrivateIdList and
PublicIdList.
Multiple instances of ReferenceLocInfo (refLocInfo=xxx) is for future
releases.
### 11.2.3 Alternative C
Figure 11.2.3-1: DIT Structure for IMS-Data with Alternative C
If an ImplicitRegistrationSet contains a PublicIdentity which is a PSI then it
shall not contain any other PublicIdentity.
If an ImplicitRegistrationSet contains a single PublicIdentity, this Public
Identity is not implicitly registered with any other Public Identity and
therefore in stage 2 terms is not considered to belong to an Implicit
Registration Set.
The concept of multiple IMS-Subscriptions within IMS-Data is not described in
the present document.
### 11.2.4 Alternative D

## 11.3 UML model
This section covers the information model for IMS Data and all its permanent
data entities. The term IMS Data may also include temporary data as shown in
the corresponding DITs.
Some data entities are already defined in 3GPP TS 32.182 [3].
Figure 11.3-1 covers some basic IMS entities with two possible approaches:
\- Approach A: where IMPU and PSI are considered as different basic entities;
\- Approach B: where a Public Identity basic IMS entity may identify a Public
User Identity or a Public Service Identity and a Private Identity basic IMS
entity may identify a Private User Identity or a Private Service Identity. The
rational of Approach B is that Public User Identity and Public Service
Identity have many common points. They have the same inheritance diagram with
SIP URI or Tel URI. Public User Identity or Public Service Identity have
compatible associations with other entities such as IMS Data or IMS Service
profile. This modelling reduces the number of IMS basic entities and
associations. Then, the differentiation between a Public User Identity and a
Public Service Identity may be done by an attribute within the Public
identity.
It is left to implementation to identify the most suited approach according to
the further model inputs.

Figure 11.3-1B Information model for some IMS entities with approach B
Figure 11.3-2 covers IMS Public User Identity and its relationship with other
IMS data entities.
Figure 11.3-2 Information model for IMS Public User Identity and some
surrounding entities
Figure 11.3-3 covers IMS Public Service Identity and its relationship with
other IMS data entities.
Figure 11.3-3 Information model for IMS Public Service Identity and some
surrounding entities
Figure 11.3-4 covers IMS Public User Identity Implicit Registration Set and
its relationship with Alias Group, and IMS Public User Identity.
NOTE: Alias Group is used as a simplification of the 3GPP TS 23.228 defined
term Alias Public User Identities. In 3GPP TS 23.228 this is referred
sometimes as well as Alias Public User Identity Group or Alias Public User
Identity Set.
Following constrains apply:
\- All Public User Identities of an Implicit Registration set must be
associated to the same Private User Identities.
\- Each IMPU can only be included in one Alias Group
Figure 11.3-4 Information model for IMS Public User Identity Implicit
Registration Set and its relationship with IMS Public User Identity and Alias
Group
Figure 11.3-5 covers IMS Data and its relationship with Public Identity that
provides coherence between approach A and approach B, since IMPU and PSI are
derived entities from the more generic Public Identity
The figure implies that a Public Identity can not exist without IMS Data. On
the other hand, IMS Data is defined for IMPU(s) or PSI(s), but not for both at
the same time.

# 12 Conclusion and Recommendation
The present study, although focused on IMS data model and not fully completed,
has shown that different alternatives for UDC Service Profile (section 7) and
UDC IMS Service Data (section 12) are supported in current deployments and
implementations and that a common base could not be found. This is mainly due
to the fact that existing FE application logics may be impacted when changing
the data model and this has been evaluated as not acceptable during the work.
For the above reasons a standardized Reference Data Model (RDM) for the Ud
interface between Front-Ends for the HSS application (HSS-FEs) and the User
Data Repository (UDR) is not agreeable.
It is therefore recommended not to start normative specification work on the
definition of a Reference Data Model.
It is further recommended to add text to 3GPP TS 29.335 indicating that
specifying a standardized RDM is out of scope of 3GPP specifications and hence
Ud data model is proprietary.
For multivendor interoperability between FEs and UDR specific integration
projects are needed in order to accommodate data required by different vendors
FEs into UDR. To this end the present document may represent a valid example
of data models implementation in operator\'s network.
