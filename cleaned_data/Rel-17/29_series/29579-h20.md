In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

**{apiRoot}/\ /\**
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards
the NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in
clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"niwmsc-smservice\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.1.3.
### 6.1.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.1.2.1 General
HTTP/2, IETF RFC 7540 [11], shall be used as specified in clause 5 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
The OpenAPI [6] specification of HTTP messages and content bodies for the
Niwmsc_SMService API is contained in Annex A.
#### 6.1.2.2 HTTP standard headers
##### 6.1.2.2.1 General
See clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] for the usage of HTTP standard headers.
##### 6.1.2.2.2 Content type
JSON, IETF RFC 8259 [12], shall be used as content type of the HTTP bodies
specified in the present specification as specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4]. The use of the JSON format shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/json\".
\"Problem Details\" JSON object shall be used to indicate additional details
of the error in a HTTP response body and shall be signalled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7807 [13].
Multipart messages shall also be supported (see clause 6.1.2.4) using the
content type \"multipart/related\", comprising:
\- one JSON body part with the \"application/json\" content type; and
\- one binary body part with 3gpp vendor specific content subtypes.
The 3gpp vendor specific content subtypes defined in Table 6.1.2.2.2-1 shall
be supported.
Table 6.1.2.2.2-1: 3GPP vendor specific content subtypes
content subtype Description
* * *
vnd.3gpp.sms Binary encoded payload, encoding SMS payload, as specified in
3GPP TS 23.040 [16] and 3GPP TS 24.011 [17]. NOTE: Using 3GPP vendor content
subtypes allows to describe the nature of the opaque payload (e.g. SMS
payload) without having to rely on metadata in the JSON payload.
See clause 6.1.2.4 for the binary payloads supported in the binary body part
of multipart messages.
#### 6.1.2.3 HTTP custom headers
The mandatory HTTP custom header fields specified in clause 5.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4] shall be supported, and the optional HTTP custom header fields
specified in clause 5.2.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] may be supported.
#### 6.1.2.4 HTTP multipart messages
HTTP multipart messages shall be supported, to transfer opaque SMS payload
(e.g. SMS message, CP Ack, etc.), in the following service operations (and
HTTP messages):
\- MoForwardSm service operation;
HTTP multipart messages shall include one JSON body part and one binary body
part comprising content of SMS payload content (see clause 6.1.6.5).
The JSON body part shall be the \"root\" body part of the multipart message.
It shall be encoded as the first body part of the multipart message. The
\"Start\" parameter does not need to be included.
The multipart message shall include a \"type\" parameter (see IETF RFC 2387
[18]) specifying the media type of the root body part, i.e.
\"application/json\".
NOTE: The \"root\" body part (or \"root\" object) is the first body part the
application processes when receiving a multipart/related message, see IETF RFC
2387 [18]. The default root is the first body within the multipart/related
message. The \"Start\" parameter indicates the root body part, e.g. when this
is not the first body part in the message.
A binary body part shall include a Content-ID header (see IETF RFC 2045 [19]),
and the JSON body part shall make a reference to the binary body part using
the Content-ID header field.
Examples of multipart/related messages can be found in Annex B.
### 6.1.3 Resources
#### 6.1.3.1 Overview
This clause describes the structure for the Resource URIs and the resources
and methods used for the service.

##### 6.1.6.5.2 SMS Payload Information
SMS Payload Information shall encode a SMS payload as specified in 3GPP TS
23.040 [16] and 3GPP TS 24.011 [18], using the vnd.3gpp.sms content-type.
SMS Payload Information may encode e.g. the following content:
> \- CP-DATA, CP-ACK, CP-ERROR as specified in 3GPP TS 23.040 [16] and 3GPP TS
> 24.011 [18].
### 6.1.7 Error Handling
#### 6.1.7.1 General
For the Niwmsc_SMService API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]. Protocol errors and application
errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] shall be supported
for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are specified as
mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Niwmsc_SMService API.
#### 6.1.7.2 Protocol Errors
No specific procedures for the Niwmsc_SMService service are specified.
#### 6.1.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Niwmsc_SMService service are listed in
Table 6.1.7.3-1.
Table 6.1.7.3-1: Application errors
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
SMS_PAYLOAD_MISSING 400 Bad Request The expected SMS payload content is
missing. SMS_PAYLOAD_ERROR 400 Bad Request Errors exist in the format of SMS
payload. SERVICE_CENTRE_CONGESTION 403 Forbidden The delivery of the MO short
message failed because SMS-SC was in congestion. USER_NOT_SERVICE_CENTER 403
Forbidden The delivery of the short message failed because the user didn\'t
belongs to the SMS-SC. FACILITY_NOT_SUPPORTED 403 Forbidden The delivery of
the MO short message failed because of facility not supported.
INVALID_SME_ADDRESS 403 Forbidden The delivery of the MO short message failed
because the SME address is invalid. UNREACHABLE_SMS_SC 504 Gateway Timeout The
delivery of the MO short message failed because the response is timeout.
### 6.1.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 6.1.8-1 are defined for the Niwmsc_SMService
API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in
clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.1.8-1: Supported Features
Feature number Feature Name Description

### 6.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Niwmsc_SMService API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see
IETF RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [10])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Niwmsc_SMService API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization
server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as described in 3GPP TS
29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Niwmsc_SMService service.
The Niwmsc_SMService API defines a single scope \"niwmsc-smservice\" for the
entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource or
operation level.
### 6.1.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different SMS-IWMSC service instance,
within the same SMS-IWMSC or a different SMS-IWMSC of an SMS-IWMSC set, e.g.
when an SMS-IWMSC service instance is part of an SMS-IWMSC (service) set or
when using indirect communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]).
An SCP that reselects a different SMS-IWMSC producer instance will return the
NF Instance ID of the new SMS-IWMSC producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-
Producer-Id header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an SMS-IWMSC within an SMS-IWMSC set redirects a service request to a
different SMS-IWMSC of the set using a 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent
Redirect status code, the identity of the new SMS-IWMSC towards which the
service request is redirected shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id
header of the 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as
specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the
present specification. It consists of OpenAPI specifications in YAML format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE 1: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5.3.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]
and clause 5B of 3GPP TR 21.900 [7]).
