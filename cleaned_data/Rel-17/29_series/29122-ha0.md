# 4 T8 reference point
## 4.1 Overview
The T8 reference point is between the SCS/AS and the SCEF. It specifies APIs
that allow the SCS/AS to access the services and capabilities provided by 3GPP
network entities and securely exposed by the SCEF.
This document also specifies the procedures triggered at the SCEF by API
requests from the SCS/AS and by event notifications received from 3GPP network
entities.
The stage 2 level requirements and signalling flows for the T8 reference point
are defined in 3GPP TS 23.682 [2].
The T8 reference point supports the following procedures:
\- Monitoring Procedures
\- Procedures for resource management of Background Data Transfer
\- Procedures for changing the chargeable party
\- Procedures for Non-IP Data Delivery
\- Procedures for Device Triggering
\- Procedures for Group Message Delivery
\- Procedures for Reporting of Network Status
\- Procedures for Communication Pattern Parameters Provisioning
\- Procedures for PFD Management
\- Procedures for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control
\- Procedures for Network Parameter Configuration
\- Procedures for setting up an AS session with required QoS
\- Procedures for MSISDN-less Mobile Originated SMS
\- Procedures for RACS Parameter Provisioning
## 4.2 Reference model
The T8 reference point resides between the SCEF and the SCS/AS as depicted in
figure 4.2.1. The overall SCEF architecture is depicted in clause 4.2 of 3GPP
TS 23.682 [2].
NOTE: The SCS/AS can be provided by a third party.
Figure 4.2.1: T8 reference model
## 4.3 Functional elements
### 4.3.1 SCEF
The SCEF is a functional element which provides means to securely expose the
services and capabilities provided by 3GPP network interfaces. The SCEF
provides access to network capabilities through homogenous application
programming interfaces.
Individual instances of SCEF may vary depending on what service capabilities
are exposed and what API features are supported.
The SCEF shall protect the other PLMN entities (e.g. HSS, MME) from requests
exceeding the permission arranged in the SLA with the third-party service
provider.
When needed, the SCEF supports mapping between information exchanged with
SCS/AS (e.g. geographical identifiers) and information exchanged with internal
PLMN functions (e.g. cell-Id, eNB-Id, TAI, MBMS SAI, etc.). This mapping is
assumed to be provided by the SCEF based on local configuration data.
### 4.3.2 SCS/AS
The SCS is the entity which connects MTC application servers to the 3GPP
network to enable them to communicate through specific 3GPP defined services
with UEs used for MTC and with the SCEF in the HPLMN. The SCS offers
capabilities for use by one or multiple MTC application servers. The MTC
applications in the external network are hosted on one or more ASs.
An SCS/AS can get services from multiple SCEFs, and an SCEF can provide
services to multiple SCS/ASs.
The SCS is controlled by the operator of the HPLMN or by a MTC Service
Provider.
The AS can be controlled by a 3^rd^ party.
## 4.4 Procedures over T8 reference point
### 4.4.1 Introduction
All procedures that operate across the T8 reference point, as specified in
3GPP TS 23.682 [2], are specified in the following clauses.
### 4.4.2 Monitoring Procedures
#### 4.4.2.1 General
These procedures are used to perform event monitoring functions via the T8
interface, which include:
\- Monitoring event configuration as specified in clause 4.4.2.2;
\- Reporting of monitoring event as specified in clause 4.4.2.3;
\- Network initiated notifications of monitoring event cancellation, as
specified in clause 4.4.2.4 ; and
\- Network initiated notifications of applied parameter configuration, as
specified in clause 4.4.2.5.
#### 4.4.2.2 Monitoring Events Configuration
##### 4.4.2.2.1 General
In order to subscribe to a new monitoring event configuration, the SCS/AS
shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF targeting the resource
\"Monitoring Event Subscriptions\". The body of the HTTP POST message shall
include:
\- SCS/AS Identifier;
\- Monitoring Type;
\- Notification Destination Address; and
\- One of External Identifier, MSISDN or External Group Identifier. The
External Identifier or the MSISDN identifies the subscription of an individual
UE and the External Group Identifier points to a group of UEs.
\- In addition, the HTTP POST request may include:
\- Maximum Number of Reports;
\- Monitoring Duration indicated by the property \"monitorExpireTime\";
\- Group Reporting Guard Time.
\- Additional Monitoring Type(s), if the subscription request targets multiple
event(s).
If the Subscription_modification feature is supported, the SCS/AS may send an
HTTP PUT message in order to update an existing monitoring event subscription.
The HTTP PUT request targets the resource \"Individual Monitoring Event
Subscription\" replacing all properties in the existing configuration. Both
the \"requestTestNotification\"and \"websockNotifConfig\" attributes shall not
be modified if previously provided.
For one-time monitoring type of requests, the SCS/AS shall include the Maximum
Number of Reports with a value set to 1 and not include the Monitoring
Duration in the HTTP request message sent to the SCEF.
If the Subscription_Patch feature is supported, the SCS/AS may send an HTTP
PATCH request to request the modification of an existing \"Individual
Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource, with the request body including the
modification instructions which may include any applicable attributes (e.g.
\"notificationDestination\" and/or \"monitorExpireTime\"), except the provided
UE Identifier (e.g. \"msisdn\", \"externalId\" or \"externalGroupId\"),
\"mtcProviderId\" and \"supportedFeatures\" attributes; Both the
\"requestTestNotification\"and \"websockNotifConfig\" attributes shall not be
modified if previously provided.
For a group of UEs, if the Partial_group_modification feature is supported,
the SCS/AS may send an HTTP PATCH message in order to cancel or add certain
UE(s) within an active group. The HTTP PATCH request targets the resource
\"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" updates with the corresponding
\"excludedExternalIds\" and/or \"excludedMsisdns\" attributes in the existing
configuration for partial group cancellation, and/or updates with the
corresponding \"addedExternalIds\" and/or \"addedMsisdns\" attributes in the
existing configuration for partial group addition.
Upon receipt of the HTTP POST, PUT or PATCH request message, if the SCS/AS is
authorized to perform such request, the SCEF shall check whether the
parameters (e.g. Maximum Number of Reports, Monitoring Duration, Maximum
Latency, Maximum Response Time, Suggested number of downlink packets in POST
or PUT request message) in the HTTP request body are within the range defined
by operator policies. If one or more of these parameters are not within the
range, the SCEF shall:
\- either reject the request message by sending an HTTP response to the SCS/AS
with a status code set to 403 Forbidden and may include the
\"PARAMETER_OUT_OF_RANGE\" error in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" structure and indicate which parameters are out of the
range in the \"invalidParams\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure;
or
\- modify the parameters which are not within the range by selecting different
values which are in the range.
For individual UE configuration requests, the SCEF shall also check whether
the Idle Status Indication is included for UE reachability event. If the Idle
Status Indication is received in the request but not supported by the network,
the SCEF may reject the request message by sending an HTTP response to the
SCS/AS with a status code set to 403 Forbidden and may include the
\"IDLE_STATUS_UNSUPPORTED\" error in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" structure.
If the SCEF receives an HTTP POST request to create a subscription resource
for a monitoring event, but without an indication of the support for the
feature corresponding to the requested monitoring event, the SCEF shall reject
the request by sending a \"400 Bad Request\" HTTP error response with the
application error \"EVENT_FEATURE_MISMATCH\".
If the SCEF receives an HTTP POST request to create a subscription resource
for a monitoring event that it does not support, the SCEF shall reject the
request by sending a \"500 Internal Server Error\" HTTP error response with
the application error \"EVENT_UNSUPPORTED\".
If the \"enNB\" feature is supported and the SCEF receives an HTTP POST
request to create a subscription resource for a monitoring event and
determines that no more subscriptions are allowed for this client, the SCEF
shall reject the request by sending a \"403 Forbidden\" HTTP error response
with the application error \"RESOURCES_EXCEEDED\".
If the \"enNB\" feature is supported and the SCEF receives an HTTP POST
request to create a subscription resource for a monitoring event and
determines that a duplicate subscription already exists for this client, the
SCEF shall reject the request by sending a \"400 Bad Request\" HTTP error
response with the application error \"DUPLICATE_REQUEST\".
After validation, the SCEF shall store the parameters and
\- may assign an SCEF Reference ID related to the created monitoring event
subscription resource; and based on operator policies, shall
\- map the accuracy into permissible granularity for location reporting event;
\- map the location area into a list of cells, eNodeB(s) and/or RAI(s)/TAI(s)
and derive the corresponding MME(s)/SGSN(s), for number of UEs present in a
geographic area event.
In order to delete a previous active configured monitoring event subscription
at the SCEF, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF
targeting the resource \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" which is
previously received in the response to the request that has created the
monitoring events subscription resource. The SCEF shall detemine the SCEF
Reference ID related to the active monitoring subscription resource.
##### 4.4.2.2.2 Monitoring Events Configuration via HSS
###### 4.4.2.2.2.1 General
The following monitoring events are applicable for the monitoring event
configuration via HSS for an individual UE or a group of UEs:
\- Loss of connectivity;
\- UE reachability;
\- Location Reporting;
\- Change of IMSI-IMEI(SV) Association;
\- Roaming Status;
\- Communication Failure;
\- PDN connectivity status;
\- Availability after DDN Failure; and
\- API support capability.
Only one-time reporting is supported if the \"reachabilityType\" attribute
sets to \"SMS\" for the event \"UE reachability\" or if the \"locationType\"
attribute sets to \"LAST_KNOWN_LOCATION\" for the event \"Location Reporting\"
in the monitoring event request.
###### 4.4.2.2.2.2 Configuration Request for an individual UE
Upon receipt of a configuration request from the SCS/AS for an individual UE,
the SCEF shall interact with the HSS via S6t, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336
[11].
Upon receipt of a successful response from the HSS,
\- if it is a one-time monitoring request and the monitoring event report is
received, the SCEF shall delete the associated configuration, send an HTTP
response message to the SCS/AS with a \"200 OK\" status code and including the
received monitoring event report(s) (more than one report may be provided if
the \"enNB\" is supported).
\- otherwise, the SCEF shall,
\- for an HTTP POST request, create a new \"Individual Monitoring Event
Subscription\" resource addressed by the URI that contains the SCS/AS
identifier and an SCEF-created subscription identifier, and send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a \"201 Created\" status code, containing the
final suggested configuration parameter(s) (if modified), indication(s) of the
discarded parameter(s) (if discarded), the monitoring event report(s) (more
than one report may be provided if the \"enNB\" is supported), if received,
and a location header field containing the URI of the created resource.
\- for an HTTP PUT request, update the active \"Individual Monitoring Event
Subscription\" resource addressed by the request URI and send an HTTP response
to the SCS/AS with a \"200 OK\" status code, containing the final suggested
configuration parameter(s) (if modified), indication(s) of the discarded
parameter(s) (if discarded) and the monitoring event report(s) (more than one
report may be provided if the \"enNB\" is supported), if received, or a \"204
No Content\" status code.
\- for an HTTP DELETE request, delete the active \"Individual Monitoring Event
Subscription\" resource addressed by the request URI and send an HTTP response
to the SCS/AS with a \"204 No Content\" status code, or a \"200 OK\" status
code and including the monitoring event report(s) (more than one report may be
provided if the \"enNB\" is supported), if received.
If the SCEF receives a response with an error code from the HSS, the SCEF
shall not create, update nor delete the concerned resource and respond to the
SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.
###### 4.4.2.2.2.3 Configuration Request for a group of UEs
Upon receipt of a request from the SCS/AS including an External Group
Identifier, then the monitoring configuration is for a group of UEs. The SCEF
shall interact with the HSS via S6t as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11].
Upon receipt of a successful response from the HSS indicating that group
processing is in progress and before beginning the processing of individual
UEs, the SCEF shall,
\- for an HTTP POST request, create a new \"Individual Monitoring Event
Subscription\" resource addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identity
and an SCEF-created subscription identifier, store the number of UEs received
in the response message from the HSS within the resource and send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with \"201 Created\" status code and a location header
field containing the URI of the created resource, in order to acknowledge the
SCS/AS of the successful group processing request.
\- for an HTTP PUT request, update the active \"Individual Monitoring Event
Subscription\" resource addressed by the request URL and send an HTTP response
with \"200 OK\" status code to acknowledge the SCS/AS of the successful group
processing request, or a \"204 No Content\" status code.
\- for an HTTP DELETE request, delete the active \"Individual Monitoring Event
Subscription\" resource addressed by the request URI and send an HTTP response
to the SCS/AS with \"204 No Content\" status code.
If the SCEF receives a response with an error code from the HSS, the SCEF
shall not create, update nor delete the concerned resource and respond to the
SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.
Upon receipt of the processing result of the individual UEs from the HSS, the
SCEF shall behave as follows:
\- if no Group Reporting Guard Time is received, the SCEF shall send an HTTP
POST request message to the SCS/AS including a reference to the related
monitoring subscription, a list of configuration failure result if received
for the group members, and the \"monitoringEventReports\" attribute including
a list of monitoring event reports if received for the group members;
\- otherwise, the SCEF shall accumulate all of the configuration results
and/or monitoring event reports received from the HSS for the group members
until the Group Reporting Guard Time expires. Then the SCEF shall send an HTTP
POST request message to the SCS/AS including a reference to the related
monitoring subscription, and a list of configuration failure result if
received for the group members, and the \"monitoringEventReports\" attribute
including a list of monitoring event reports at the Group Reporting Guard
Time.
\- If the Partial_group_modification feature is supported,
\- upon the cancellation of UE(s) within the active group identified by the
\"excludedExternalIds\" and/or \"excludedMsisdns\" attributes is successful,
the SCEF shall,
\- if the maximum number of reports applies to the monitoring event
configuration of the cancelled UE(s), set the stored number of reports of the
indicated UE(s) to the maximum number of reports;
\- still consider the rest of UE(s) as applicable within the active group
based monitoring subscription to the group based Monitoring Event Report
identified by the External Group Identifier;
\- determine whether the reporting for the group based event subscription is
completed or not. If completed, the SCEF shall delete the corresponding
\"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource with procedures as
described in clause 4.4.2.3.
\- If the cancellation of UE(s) within the active group is unsuccessful, the
SCEF shall respond with proper error code indicating the error and should
return the appropriate additional error information in the POST response body.
\- upon the addition of UE(s) within the active group identified by the
\"addedExternalIds\" and/or \"addedMsisdns\" attributes is successful, the
SCEF shall,
\- still consider the existing of UE(s) as applicable within the active group
based monitoring subscription to the group based Monitoring Event Report
identified by the External Group Identifier;
\- subsequently apply monitoring event subscription to the new group member
UEs.
\- If the addition of UE(s) within the active group is unsuccessful, the SCEF
shall respond with proper error code indicating the error and should return
the appropriate additional error information in the POST response body.
The SCS/AS shall send an HTTP response to acknowledge the SCEF about the
handling result of the received HTTP POST request.
##### 4.4.2.2.3 Monitoring Events Configuration directly via MME/SGSN
The monitoring event \"Number of UEs in a geographic area\" is applicable for
the monitoring event configuration via MME/SGSN. Only one-time reporting is
supported for this event with the value of Maximum Number of Reports indicated
by \"maximumNumberOfReports\" set to 1.
Upon receipt of an HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall
\- resolve the location area to the involved SGSN(s)/MME(s) by local
configuration;
\- interact with the HSS via the S6t interface as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336
[11] if the External Group ID(s) is included; and
\- interact with the SGSN(s)/MME(s) via the T6a/b inteface as specified in
3GPP TS 29.128 [12].
NOTE: The SCEF uses local configuration to resolve the involved SGSN(s)/MME(s)
if the location area is not received.
After collecting responses from the SGSN(s)/MME(s), if the SCEF does not
receive any successful response from the involved SGSN(s)/MME(s), the SCEF
shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in
clause 5.2.6; otherwise the SCEF should send a response with 200 OK status
code to acknowledge the SCS/AS with one aggregated report in the requested
area by including the total count of the number of UEs in the \"ueCount\"
attribute and the External Identifier(s) (if available) or the MSISDN(s) (if
available) associated with the External Group ID.
NOTE: It is possible that the number of UEs does not reflect the actual number
of UEs in the designated area (e.g. some SGSN(s)/MME(s) do not respond
successfully). The SCEF still provides the result to the SCS/AS if at least
one SGSN/MME returns a successful response.
##### 4.4.2.2.4 Monitoring Events Configuration via PCRF
###### 4.4.2.2.4.1 General
The following monitoring events: the location reporting event and
communication failure event are applicable for the monitoring event
configuration via PCRF for an individual UE.
If monitoring event configuration via PCRF is used for a subscription
resource, the Subscription_modification feature cannot be supported.
Only the location reporting event is applicabe for the monitoring event
configuration via PCRF for a group of UEs.
Only one-time reporting is supported for the monitoring event configuration
via PCRF.
HTTP PUT is not supported for the monitoring event configuration via PCRF. If
it is received, the SCEF shall reject the HTTP PUT message with 403 Forbidden
during monitoring and may indicate the \"OPERATION_PROHIBITED\" error in the
\"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure.
###### 4.4.2.2.4.2 Configuration Request for an individual UE
Upon receipt of an HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS for an individual UE, the
SCEF shall:
\- interact with the PCRF via the Rx inteface by using an existing AF session
or establishing a new AF session as specified in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10];
NOTE 1: The SCEF can derive the service information over the Rx interface
based on SCS/AS ID for communication failure event.
\- after receiving the AAA message from the PCRF, create a resource which
represents the monitoring event configuration addressed by a URI that contains
the SCS/AS identifier and an SCEF-created subscription identifier; and
\- send a corresponding status code to acknowledge the SCS/AS of the
successful processing of the request in the HTTP response message.
Then the SCEF shall wait for the reporting from the PCRF as specified in 3GPP
TS 29.214 [10].
NOTE 2: Different events can be reported in different messages according to
3GPP TS 29.214 [10], e.g. STR/RAR for communication failure.
During configuration resource deletion, the SCEF shall also terminate the AF
session if it was established and used only for event monitoring.
###### 4.4.2.2.4.3 Configuration Request for a group of UEs
Upon receipt of an HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS for a group of UEs, the
SCEF shall:
\- interact with all PCRFs in the same PLMN via Nta application of Nt
interface as specified in 3GPP TS 29.154 [9];
\- after collecting ECA message from all PCRFs, create a resource which
represents the monitoring event configuration addressed by a URI that contains
the SCS/AS identifier and an SCEF-created subscription identifier; and
\- send a corresponding status code to acknowledge the SCS/AS of the
successful processing of the request in the HTTP response message.
Then the SCEF shall wait for the reporting from the PCRF(s) as specified in
3GPP TS 29.154 [9].
#### 4.4.2.3 Reporting of Monitoring Event Procedure
Upon receipt of a Monitoring Event Report from the HSS or the MME/SGSN as
defined in clause 5.6.3 or clause 5.6.8 of 3GPP TS 23.682 [2], from the PCRF
as defined in clause 5.6.5 or from the IWK-SCEF as defined in clause 5.6.8 of
3GPP TS 23.682 [2], the SCEF shall determine the monitoring event subscription
associated with the corresponding Monitoring Event Report.
If the monitoring event subscription refers to a Monitoring Event
Configuration for a single UE or to a group-based Monitoring Event
configuration, and no Group Reporting Guard Time was set, then the SCEF shall
send an HTTP POST message including a link to the SCEF-created subscription
resource and the received Monitoring Event Report to the identified
destination. If the monitoring event subscription refers to a group-based
Monitoring Event Configuration and Group Reporting Guard Time was provided
during the Monitoring Event configuration procedure, then the SCEF shall
accumulate all of the received Monitoring Event reports for the group of UEs
until the Group Reporting Guard Time expires or the monitoring duration
indicated by the property \"monitorExpireTime\" is reached.
Upon expiration of Group Reporting Guard Time or expiration of the monitoring
duration, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message to the identified
destination including a link to the SCEF-created subscription resource and the
list of accumulated Monitoring Event Reports for each UE identified by either
its External Identifier or MSISDN. The destination URL of the HTTP POST
message is provided by the SCS/AS during the Monitoring Event Configuration
procedure.
If the monitoring event subscription refers to a one-time monitoring request
or a continuous monitoring request, but the maximum number of reports is
reached, the SCEF shall consider the reporting as completed, delete the
corresponding \"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource and send
an HTTP POST message including the subscription identifier and a cancellation
indication to the identified destination. The cancellation indication shall
set to \"true\" indicating to cancel the configured monitoring subscription.
The destination URL of the HTTP POST is provided by the SCS/AS during the
Monitoring Event Configuration procedure. In addition, the SCEF shall interact
with the HSS to delete the event configuration if the latter was performed via
the HSS whereas event reports were performed via the SGSN/MME. The SCEF
determines that the reporting for a group is completed by comparing the total
number of received reports with the number of UEs of the group (received from
the HSS during event configuration for a group of UEs) multiplied by the
maximum number of reports.
If the Partial_group_modification feature is supported and one or more
MSISDN(s) or External Identifier(s) within the active group based monitor
subscription have been cancelled or added, the existing UE(s) within the
active group based monitoring subscription are still applicable to the group
based Monitoring Event Report identified by the External Group Identifier, the
added group member(s) shall be subsequently applied with the monitoring event
subscription.
When the monitoring duration indicated by the property \"monitorExpireTime\"
is reached, the SCEF shall delete the related event subscription and event
configuration locally. The SCS/AS shall no longer address the corresponding
\"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource.
#### 4.4.2.4 Network-initiated Explicit Monitoring Event Deletion Procedure
Upon receipt of an SCEF Reference ID for the event to be deleted from the HSS
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11], the SCEF shall determine the subscription
identifier associated with the indicated active monitoring subscription. Then
the SCEF shall delete the related resource \"Individual Monitoring Event
Subscription\", send an HTTP POST message including the subscription
identifier and a cancellation indication to the identified destination. The
cancellation indication shall set to \"true\" indicating to cancel the
configured monitoring subscription. The destination URL of the HTTP POST is
provided by the SCS/AS during the Monitoring Event Configuration procedure.
If the Partial_group_cancellation feature is supported, upon receipt of one or
more MSISDN(s) or External Identifier(s) for the group member(s) to be
cancelled within the active group based event subscription from the HSS as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11], the SCEF shall,
\- if the maximum number of reports applies to the monitoring event
configuration, set the stored number of reports of the indicated UE(s) to the
maximum number of reports;
\- include the MSISDN(s) or External Identifier(s) to be cancelled in the
MonitoringNotification Request to the destination URL provided by the SCS/AS
during the Monitoring Event Configuration procedure; and
\- determine whether the reporting for the group based event subscription is
completed or not. If completed, the SCEF shall delete the corresponding
\"Individual Monitoring Event Subscription\" resource with procedures as
described in clause 4.4.2.3.
NOTE: The above procedure can be triggered from the HSS due to parameter
overwritten by Network Parameter Configuration.
#### 4.4.2.5 Network initiated notification of applied parameter configuration
For \"LOSS_OF_CONNECTIVITY\" and \"UE_REACHABILITY\" events, if the
\"Enhanced_param_config\" feature is supported and the SCEF receives the
currently applied parameter configuration from the HSS, the SCEF shall notify
the SCS/AS via an HTTP POST message including the parameter changes in the
\"appliedParam\" attribute.
### 4.4.3 Procedures for resource management of Background Data Transfer
These procedures are used by an SCS/AS to perform the resource management of
background data transfer (BDT) to a set of UEs, i.e. the SCS/AS requests a
time window and related conditions from the SCEF via the T8 interface.
In order to create a resource for the background data transfer policy, the
SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF for the \"BDT
Subscriptions\" resource to negotiate the transfer policy. The body of the
HTTP POST message shall include SCS/AS Identifier, Volume per UE (total volume
for both DL and UL or separate volume for DL and/or UL), Number of UEs,
Desired Time Window and optionally a location area information.
After receiving the HTTP POST message, if the SCS/AS is authorized, the SCEF
shall map the SCS/AS Identifier to ASP Identifier and negotiate the transfer
policy with the PCRF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.154 [9]. After receiving the
response including the determined transfer policies from the PCRF, the SCEF
shall create a resource \"Individual BDT Subscription\" which represents the
BDT subscription, addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identifier and
an SCEF-created subscription identifier, and shall respond to the SCS/AS with
a 201 Created message, including a Location header field containing the URI
for the created resource and a message body, which may also include Reference
ID and a set of transfer policies. The SCS/AS shall use the URI received in
the Location header in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this
background data transfer subscription. If the SCEF receives a response with an
error code from the PCRF, the SCEF shall not create the resource and shall
respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause
5.2.6.
The SCS/AS may also send an HTTP PUT message to the SCEF for the \"Individual
BDT Subscription\" resource to request starting an update for negotiation of
background data transfer policy. The body of the HTTP PUT message shall
include data as described in the POST message. The external group identifier
shall remain unchanged from previously provided value. After receiving such
request, if the SCS/AS is authorized, the SCEF shall negotiate the transfer
policy with the PCRF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.154 [9]. After receiving the
response including the determined transfer policies from the PCRF, the SCEF
shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a \"200 OK\" status code and
shall include the Bdt data type in the response body, or with a \"204 No
Content\" status code. If the SCEF receives a response with an error code from
the PCRF, the SCEF shall not update the resource and shall respond to the
SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.
NOTE 1: The SCEF starts a new BDT policy negotiation in the Nt interface by
sending the request to the PCRF without the previously associated BDT
Reference ID.
If more than one policy is included in the HTTP response, the SCS/AS shall
send an HTTP PATCH message to inform the SCEF for the \"Individual BDT
Subscription\" resource of the transfer policy selected by the SCS/AS. After
receiving the HTTP PATCH message, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the
SCS/AS with a \"200 OK\" status code and shall include the Bdt data type in
the response body, or with a \"204 No Content\" status code, then the SCEF
shall interact with the PCRF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.154 [9]. If the SCEF
identifies any error (e.g. selected policy is not within the set of transfer
policies), the SCEF shall not update the resource and shall respond to the
SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.
The SCS/AS may also send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF for the
\"Individual BDT Subscription\" resource requesting to remove an individual
resource identified by the URI received in the response to the request that
has created resource a URI. After receiving such request, the SCEF shall
delete the resource and send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a
corresponding status code.
NOTE 2: The SCEF can also remove the resource when the last window end time in
transfer policies expires.
### 4.4.4 Procedures for changing the chargeable party at session set up or
during the session
This procedure is used by an SCS/AS to either request to sponsor the traffic
from the beginning or to request becoming the chargeable party at a later
point in time via the T8 interface.
When setting up the connection between the AS and the UE via the SCEF, the
SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST request to the SCEF, targeting the \"Chargeable
Party Transactions\" resource, to become the chargeable party for the session
to be set up. The body of the HTTP POST message shall include the SCS/AS
Identifier, UE IP address, IP Flow description, Sponsor ID, ASP ID, Sponsoring
Status, notification destination URI identifying the recipient of
notifications within the \"notificationDestination\" attribute and may include
the time period and/or traffic volume used for sponsoring. The SCS/AS may also
request to activate a previously selected policy of background data transfer
by including the associated Reference ID in the body of the HTTP POST message.
If the feature AppId is supported, either the Flow description or an external
Application Identifier shall be included.
After receiving the HTTP POST request, if the authorization performed by the
SCEF is successful, the SCEF shall act as an AF and interact with the PCRF via
the Rx interface, as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] or 3GPP TS 29.201 [13], to
trigger a PCRF initiated IP-CAN Session Modification. The SCEF may map the
SCS/AS Identifier to AF Application Identifier if the external Application
Identifier is not provided and only one AF Application Identifier is mapped
and may request to be notified about the traffic plane status based on local
configuration. If the time period and/or traffic volume are received from the
SCS/AS, the SCEF should subscribe with the PCRF to the USAGE_REPORT event.
If the \"enNB\" feature is supported, the SCEF may explicitly receive a list
of event(s) that the SCS/AS requests to subscribe to. The SCEF shall subscribe
to the corresponding PCRF event(s) (e.g.
INDICATION_OF_SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION) for the received event(s) (e.g.
SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION) except for SESSION_TERMINATION.
NOTE 1: PCRF does not need explicit subscription in order to notify Rx session
termination.
After receiving a successful response from the PCRF, the SCEF shall create a
new \"Individual Chargeable Party Transaction\" resource, which represents the
chargeable party transaction, addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS
identity and an SCEF-created transaction identifier, and shall respond to the
SCS/AS with a 201 Created status code, including a Location header field
containing the URI of the created resource. The SCS/AS shall use the URI
received in the Location header in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to
this chargeable party transaction. If the SCEF receives a response with an
error code from the PCRF, the SCEF shall not create a resource and respond to
the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.
In order to update the sponsoring status of an established AS session, the
SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH message to the SCEF targeting the associated
\"Individual Chargeable Party Transaction\" resource requesting to partial
update a chargeable party transaction resource (e.g. change the Sponsoring
Status, update the list of event(s) if the \"enNB\" feature is supported).
When receiving the HTTP PATCH message, the SCEF shall make the change and
interact with the PCRF to modify the Rx session as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214
[10] or 3GPP TS 29.201 [13]. After receiving a response with successful result
code from the PCRF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a
\"200 OK\" status code and the result if any in the body of the HTTP response
or a \"204 No Content\" status code. The accumulated usage received from the
PCRF shall be included in the HTTP response with the \"200 OK\" status code if
the SCS/AS requested to disable the sponsoring. If the SCEF receives a
response with an error code from the PCRF, the SCEF shall not update the
resource and respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as
described in clause 5.2.6.
NOTE 2: The SCS/AS can assume a successful resource allocation upon receipt of
the POST/PATCH response until the FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION event is
received.
NOTE 3: The SCS/AS can update the list of user plane event(s) only for one
time specific events, i.e. INDICATION_OF_SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION,
INDICATION_OF_FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION and USAGE_REPORT events, as
specified in clause 5.3.13 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10].
If the SCEF receives a traffic plane notification (e.g. the usage threshold is
reached or transmission resource lost) or gets informed that the Rx session is
terminated (e.g. due to the release of PDN connection), the SCEF shall send an
HTTP POST message including the notified event (e.g. session terminated) and
the accumulated usage to the SCS/AS identified by the notification destination
URI received during session set up. The SCS/AS shall respond with an HTTP
response to confirm the received notification.
In order to remove an established AS session, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP
DELETE message to the SCEF targeting the associated \"Individual Chargeable
Party Transaction\" resource. After receiving the HTTP DELETE message, the
SCEF shall remove all properties of the resource and interact with the PCRF to
terminate the Rx session (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] or 3GPP TS 29.201
[13]). After receiving the response from the PCRF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code and the accumulated
usage (if received from the PCRF).
### 4.4.5 Procedures for Non-IP Data Delivery
#### 4.4.5.1 General
This procedure is used by an SCS/AS to support the Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD)
via SCEF. It performs the NIDD configuration via the T8 interface. It also
includes the mobile terminated (MT) and mobile originated (MO) communication
with UEs via the T8 interface. It also includes the group message delivery via
MT NIDD via the T8 interface and management of port numbers on UE and SCEF and
their dynamic association with different applications.
Error handling for the procedures in this clause shall be handled based on
clause 5.2.6.
#### 4.4.5.2 NIDD Configuration
##### 4.4.5.2.1 NIDD Configuration for a single UE
For a NIDD configuration creation, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message
to the SCEF for the \"NIDD configurations\" resource. The body of the HTTP
POST message shall include External Identifier or MSISDN, SCS/AS Identifier,
notification destination URI identifying the recipient of notification within
the \"notificationDestination\" attribute and may include NIDD Duration, PDN
Connection Establishment Option and Reliable Data Service Configuration. In
addition, the SCS/AS may send non-IP data and its associated parameters (e.g.
Priority) as described in clause 4.4.5.3.1 in the NIDD configuration creation
request. The Reliable Data Service Configuration includes port numbers on UE
and SCEF that are used to identify specific applications for data transfer
between UE and SCS/AS and an indication if reliable data service
acknowledgement is enabled or not.
Upon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to create a NIDD
configuration, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authenticated and
authorized to create NIDD configuration, and also authorize the NIDD
configuration. If authorization is successful, the SCEF shall interact with
the HSS via S6t as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11]. Upon receipt of the
successful response from the HSS, the SCEF shall store the UE identity (IMSI
and External Identifier or MSISDN) which is associated with the External
Identifier or MSISDN and create a resource \"Individual NIDD configuration\",
which represents the NIDD configuration, addressed by a URI that contains the
SCS/AS identity and an SCEF-created NIDD configuration identifier, and shall
respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created message, including a Location header
field containing the URI for the created resource. The body of the response
message shall include Maximum Packet Size and may include Reliable Data
Service Indication. When the SCS/AS receives the URI in the Location header,
it shall use this URI in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this NIDD
configuration.
If the SCS/AS includes a downlink non-IP data together with the NIDD
configuration creation, the SCEF shall also create the corresponding
\"Individual NIDD downlink data delivery\" sub-resource(s) and send each of
the sub- resource(s) within the \"self\" attribute in the
\"niddDownlinkDataTransfers\" attribute together with the created resource
\"Individual NIDD configuration\" which included in the Location header field
in the HTTP POST response. When the SCS/AS receives the URI the \"self\"
attribute in the \"niddDownlinkDataTransfers\" attribute, it shall use this
URI in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this downlink data delivery
transfer.
After sending the HTTP response to NIDD configuration request, the SCEF shall
perform the procedure for individual MT NIDD as described in clause 4.4.5.3.1.
NOTE: Any further interaction with the SCS/AS for the piggybacked individual
MT NIDD is performed by the notification of NIDD downlink data delivery
status.
For a NIDD configuration modification, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH
message to the SCEF for the \"Individual NIDD configuration\" resource, using
the URI received in the response to the request that has created the NIDD
configuration resource. Upon receipt of the HTTP PATCH request from the SCS/AS
to update the parameters of the NIDD configuration, the SCEF shall check
whether the SCS/AS is authenticated and authorized to update NIDD
configuration. If the authorization is successful, the SCEF shall verify that
the resource to be modified already exists as identified by the URI. If the
NIDD configuration resource is found, the SCEF shall update the NIDD
configuration as requested. Upon successful update of the requested NIDD
configuration including the interaction with the HSS via S6t as specified in
3GPP TS 29.336 [11], the SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 200 OK
success message indicating that the NIDD configuration resource was
successfully updated, or with a 204 No Content success message if the NIDD
configuration modification is successful updated with no content in the PATCH
response message body.
For a NIDD configuration cancellation, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE
message to the SCEF for the \"Individual NIDD configuration\" resource, using
the URI received in the response to the request that has created the NIDD
configuration resource. Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE message from the
SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authenticated and
authorized to delete NIDD configuration. If the authorization is successful,
the SCEF shall verify that the NIDD configuration resource identified by the
URI already exists. If the configuration resource exists, the SCEF shall
delete the requested configuration, and perform related NIDD procedure to EPC
network elements if applicable. Upon successful deletion of requested NIDD
configuration, the SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 200 OK success
message indicating that the NIDD configuration was successfully cancelled. As
an alternative to the 200 OK success message, the SCEF may send a 204 No
Content success message without any message content to the SCS/AS.
When the NIDD Duration expires, the SCEF may remove the associated NIDD
configuration resource and all individual downlink data delivery resources
under such NIDD configuration.
##### 4.4.5.2.2 NIDD Configuration for a group of UEs
The NIDD configuration procedure for a single UE as described in clause
4.4.5.2.1 shall be applicable for a group of UEs with the following
differences:
\- The External Group Identifier shall be included in the POST request instead
of MSISDN or External Identifier.
\- After receiving the response message from the HSS, the SCEF shall store the
list of UE identifiers (IMSI and External Identifier or MSISDN) which are
associated with the External Group Identifier.
\- The downlink non-IP data is not supported to be handled together with the
NIDD configuration.
#### 4.4.5.3 Mobile Terminated NIDD procedure
##### 4.4.5.3.1 Mobile Terminated NIDD for a single UE
If the SCS/AS needs to perform a downlink non-IP data delivery for a single
UE, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF for the \"NIDD
downlink data deliveries\" resource, identifying an existing NIDD
configuration resource as parent resource. The body of the HTTP POST message
shall include External Identifier or MSISDN and non-IP data and may include
PDN Connection Establishment Option, Reliable Data Service Configuration,
Maximum Latency and Priority. The Reliable Data Service Configuration includes
port numbers on UE and SCEF that are used to identify a specific application
for data transfer between UE and SCS/AS and an indication if reliable data
service acknowledgement is enabled or not.
Upon receipt of a HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS for a downlink data
delivery for a single UE, the SCEF shall:
> \- verify the NIDD configuration resource already exists based on the URI
> passed, if the configuration resource does not exist, the SCEF shall respond
> with a 404 Not Found response to reject the downlink data delivery, and
>
> \- check whether the SCS/AS is authorised to send NIDD requests, if not
> authorized, the SCEF shall respond with a 401 Unauthorized response to
> reject the downlink data delivery, and
>
> \- check whether the non-IP packet size is larger than the Maximum Packet
> Size that was provided to the SCS/AS during NIDD Configuration. If the
> packet is oversized, the SCEF shall respond with a 403 Forbidden response
> with a cause value \"DATA_TOO_LARGE\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
> \"ProblemDetails\" data structure indicating received non-IP packet size is
> larger than \"maximumPacketSize\" of the NIDD configuration.
>
> \- if the Rds_port_verification feature is supported, check whether the RDS
> port numbers are within the configured RDS port list. If the RDS port
> numbers are unknown in the SCEF, the SCEF shall respond with a 403 Forbidden
> response with a cause value \"RDS_PORT_UNKNOWN\" in the \"cause\" attribute
> of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure.
If all above checks are successful, the SCEF shall determine the EPS Bearer
Context based on the APN associated with the NIDD configuration and the User
Identity. If the SCEF EPS bearer context is not found in the SCEF, depending
on PDN Connection Establishment Option received in the POST request or from
NIDD configuration, the SCEF may:
\- reject the request with an error message to the SCS/AS;
\- send a Device Trigger to the UE as described in clause 4.4.6 without
buffering the non-IP data and respond the SCS/AS with a 500 Internal Server
Error response and a cause value \"TRIGGERED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of
the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure; or
\- buffer the non-IP data and create the \"Individual NIDD downlink data
delivery\" sub-resource, then send a 201 Created response to the SCS/AS. The
response message also includes an indication of whether the Device Trigger
procedure (as described in clause 4.4.6) was performed by the SCEF. A Location
header shall be included in the response message that provides the URI of the
resource identifying this individual downlink data delivery. The SCS/AS shall
use the URI received in the Location header in subsequent requests to the SCEF
to refer to this individual downlink data delivery for possible replacement or
cancellation. The non-IP data shall be delivered when the non-IP PDN
connection is established.
If the SCEF EPS bearer context is found in the SCEF, the SCEF shall check if
the SCS/AS has exceeded the quota or rate of data submission considering the
number of existing buffered non-IP data and restriction in APN and serving
PLMN rate control. If quota is reached, the SCEF shall respond the SCS/AS with
a 403 Forbidden response and a cause value \"QUOTA_EXCEEDED\" in the \"cause\"
attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure indicating the reason for
the failure condition. If rate limit is reached, the SCEF shall respond the
SCS/AS with a 429 Too Many Requests response.
If the check is passed, the SCEF shall continue the downlink non-IP data
delivery procedure as the defined 3GPP TS 29.128 [12].
If the non-IP data delivery was successful, the SCEF shall send a 200 OK
response to the HTTP POST request indicating the downlink non-IP data delivery
is successful along with the acknowledge information; otherwise the SCEF may:
\- send a 500 Internal Server Error response and a cause value indicating the
reason for the delivery failure within the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" data structure, i.e.:
1\. if delivery was unsuccessful due to timeout, the cause value \"TIMEOUT\";
or
2\. if delivery to the next hop was unsuccessful with the cause value
\"NEXT_HOP\"; or
\- if the MME/SGSN indicates UE is temporary not reachable, either:
1\. buffer the non-IP data and create the \"Individual NIDD downlink data
delivery\" sub-resource, then send a 201 Created response to the SCS/AS. The
response may include a Requested Re-Transmission time to indicate the SCS/AS
when the UE is expected to be reachable so that the SCEF re-transmits the
buffered non-IP data; or
2\. send a 500 Internal Server Error response without buffering the non-IP
data, and include a cause value \"TEMPORARILY_NOT_REACHABLE\" in the \"cause\"
attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure indicating the downlink
non-IP data delivery is performedbut stopped since UE is temporarily
unreachable. The response may include a Requested Re-Transmission time to
indicate the SCS/AS when the UE is expected to be reachable so that the SCS/AS
may prepare any re-transmission.
If the MT_NIDD_modification_cancellation feature is supported and the SCS/AS
decides to replace the pending downlink data delivery in the SCEF, the SCS/AS
shall send an HTTP PUT message to the SCEF, using the URI received in the
response to the request that has created the individual downlink data delivery
resource. The External Identifier or MSISDN shall remain unchanged from
previous values. Upon receipt of the HTTP PUT request from the SCS/AS, the
SCEF shall check whether a pending non-IP data exists with the same URI (i.e.
resource exists). If it is found, the SCEF shall replace it with the new non-
IP data and continue waiting for any message from the MME/SGSN for the UE
indicating either the non-IP PDN connection is being established or the UE is
reachable (such message may be an MO NIDD); otherwise the SCEF shall respond
with a 409 Conflict response with a cause value \"SENDING\" in the \"cause\"
attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure indicating replacement
failure. If the buffered data is already delivered, the SCEF shall respond
with a 404 Not Found response and include a cause value \"ALREADY_DELIVERED\"
in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure indicating
replacement failure. If delivery was unsuccessful due to timeout, the SCEF
shall respond with a 500 Internal Server Error response with a cause value
\"TIMEOUT\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data
structure. If delivery to the next hop was unsuccessful, the SCEF shall
respond with a 500 Internal Server Error response with a cause value
\"NEXT_HOP\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data
structure.
If the \"PatchUpdate\" feature defined in clause 5.6.4 is supported and the
SCS/AS decides to partially modify the pending downlink data delivery in the
SCEF, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH message to the SCEF to the URI
received in the response to the request that has created the concerned
individual downlink data delivery resource. The request body shall contain the
NiddDownlinkDataTransferPatch data structure including only the attributes
that shall be updated. Upon reception of this HTTP PATCH request from the
SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check whether a pending non-IP data with the received
URI exists (i.e. the resource exists). If it is found, the SCEF shall apply
the requested modifications and continue waiting for any message from the
MME/SGSN for the UE indicating either the non-IP PDN connection is being
established or the UE is reachable (such message may be an MO NIDD); otherwise
the SCEF shall respond with a \"409 Conflict\" status code including a cause
value \"SENDING\" within the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\"
data structure to indicate modification failure. If the buffered data is
already delivered, the SCEF shall respond with a \"404 Not Found\" status code
including a cause value \"ALREADY_DELIVERED\" within the \"cause\" attribute
of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure to indicate modification failure. If
delivery was unsuccessful due to timeout, the SCEF shall respond with a 500
Internal Server Error status code with a cause value \"TIMEOUT\" in the
\"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure. If delivery to
the next hop was unsuccessful, the SCEF shall respond with a 500 Internal
Server Error status code with a cause value \"NEXT_HOP\" in the \"cause\"
attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure.
If the MT_NIDD_modification_cancellation feature is supported and the SCS/AS
decides to cancel the pending downlink data delivery in the SCEF, the SCS/AS
shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF, using the URI received in the
response to the request that has created the individual downlink data delivery
resource. Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS, the SCEF
shall check whether a pending request exists with the same URI. If such non-IP
data has not been delivered, the SCEF shall remove the individual downlink
data delivery resource and respond with an HTTP 204 No Content response;
otherwise the SCEF shall respond with a 404 Not Found response (i.e. data
already delivered) with a cause value \"ALREADY_DELIVERED\" in the \"cause\"
attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure or 409 Conflict (i.e. data
delivery ongoing) response with a cause value \"SENDING\" in the \"cause\"
attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure, and include a cause value
indicating cancellation failure.
If a pending non-IP data is delivered by the SCEF (e.g. due to non-IP PDN
connection establishment), and the SCEF gets the delivery result from the
MME/SGSN, the SCEF shall remove the \"Individual NIDD downlink data delivery\"
sub-resource and send an HTTP POST message to the SCS/AS, identified by the
notification destination URI received during the NIDD configuration, to notify
the delivery result for the pending non-IP data. Upon receipt of the request,
the SCS/AS shall acknowledge the notification with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No
Content response.
During MT NIDD delivery, if the UE indicates no support for RDS and the SCEF
previously indicated RDS is enabled to the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall stop sending
the non-IP data and send MT NIDD delivery notification with
\"FAILURE_RDS_DISABLED\" delivery status.
##### 4.4.5.3.2 Mobile Terminated NIDD for a group of UEs
If the SCS/AS needs to perform a downlink non-IP data delivery to a group of
UEs and if both the SCS/AS and the SCEF support GroupMesageDelivery feature as
defined inclause 5.6.4, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST request message to
the SCEF for the \"NIDD downlink data deliveries\" resource, identifying an
existing NIDD configuration resource as parent resource. The body of the HTTP
POST request message shall include the External Group Identifier and the non-
IP data, and may include Reliable Data Service Configuration, PDN Connection
Establishment Option and Maximum Latency.
Upon receipt of such an HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS requesting the group
message delivery, the SCEF checks whether the SCS/AS is authorised to send
NIDD requests, whether the non-IP packet size is larger than the Maximum
Packet Size that was provided to the SCS/AS during NIDD Configuration and if
the Rds_port_verification feature is supported whether the RDS port numbers
are recognized. If any of those checks fails, the SCEF shall respond with a
HTTP response with a cause value indicating the reason for the failure
condition. If all checks are successful, the SCEF shall create an \"Individual
NIDD downlink data delivery\" resource and sends a 201 Created response to the
SCS/AS to acknowledge acceptance of the HTTP POST request.
Then for each authorized External Identifier associated to the External Group
Identifier which is retrieved from the HSS during preceding NIDD configuration
procedure (as specified in clause 4.4.5.2.2), the SCEF shall determine the EPS
Bearer Context based on the APN associated with the NIDD configuration and the
User Identity and continue the procedure as described for MT NIDD for a single
UE in clause 4.4.5.3.1 without sending downlink data delivery status
notification for any individual UE to the SCS/AS.
At the end of buffering (duration determined by the Maximum Latency or local
policy) or after processing data delivery for all UEs in the group, the SCEF
shall send an HTTP POST message to SCS/AS to indicate the aggregated result of
data delivery of each UE. The body of the HTTP POST request message shall
include MSISDN or External Identifier, Retransmission Time (optional) and
delivery result for each UE. Upon receipt of the request, the SCS/AS shall
acknowledge the request with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.
The MT_NIDD_modification_cancellation feature is not supported for the group
message delivery via NIDD. If a PUT or DELETE request is received for the
\"Individual NIDD downlink data delivery\" resource which was created for a
group of UEs, the SCEF shall reject the message with a 403 Forbidden response
with a cause value \"OPERATION_PROHIBITED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" data structure.
During MT NIDD delivery, if the UE indicates no support for RDS and the SCEF
previously indicated RDS is enabled to the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall stop sending
the non-IP data for the indicated UE. In the aggregated MT NIDD delivery
notification, the SCEF shall send \"FAILURE_RDS_DISABLED\" delivery status for
each failed UE.
#### 4.4.5.4 Mobile Originated NIDD procedure
When the SCEF receives the non-IP data from MME/SGSN (or IWK-SCEF) as defined
in 3GPP TS 29.128 [12], and finds an SCEF EPS bearer context and the
associated NIDD configuration, the SCEF shall determine the SCS/AS by the
corresponding NIDD configuration, and send an HTTP POST request to the SCS/AS
identified by the Notification Destination Address received in the NIDD
configuration to notify the uplink non-IP data. The body of the HTTP POST
message shall include External Identifier or MSISDN, non-IP data, NIDD
configuration identifier, Reliable Data Service Configuration (if available).
The Reliable Data Service Configuration includes port numbers on UE and SCEF
that are used to identify a specific application for data transfer between UE
and SCS/AS and an indication if reliable data service acknowledgement is
enabled or not.
Upon receipt of the request, if the SCS/AS knows the NIDD configuration
identified by the NIDD configuration identifier, the SCS/AS shall acknowledge
a 200 OK or 204 No Content message to the SCEF.
#### 4.4.5.5 NIDD Authorisation Update procedure
When the SCEF receives a NIDD Authorisation Update Request message from HSS to
update a user\'s NIDD authorisation as defined in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11], the
SCEF shall determine the SCS/AS with the corresponding NIDD Configuration, and
send an HTTP POST message to the SCS/AS to notify it of the NIDD Authorisation
Update. The body of the HTTP POST message shall include External Identifier or
MSISDN, NIDD configuration identifier and the NIDD configuration status.
Upon receipt of the request, if the SCS/AS knows the corresponding NIDD
configuration, then the SCS/AS shall acknowledge the request with an HTTP 200
OK or 204 No Content response.
If the NIDD configuration is revoked by the HSS within the received NIDD
Authorisation Update Request, the SCEF shall release the corresponding T6a/b
PDN connection as specified in 3GPP TS 29.128 [12]. In this case, the SCEF
shall reject any subsequent MT NIDD deliveries with a 403 Forbidden response.
Or 404 Not Found is returned, if the SCEF locally removed the associated NIDD
configuration resource when the configuration was revoked.
If the RDS capability is changed, e.g. when the T6a/b PDN connection is
established, the UE indicates no support for RDS but the SCEF previously
indicated RDS is supported to the SCS/AS in the NIDD configuration procedure,
the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message to notify the SCS/AS that the NIDD
status is active and RDS capability indication. The SCS/AS shall acknowledge
the request with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.
If the Rds_port_verification feature is supported, before sending the MO NIDD
to the SCS/AS as specified in clause 4.4.5.4, the SCEF shall check RDS port
numbers (decoded from the uplink non-IP data according to 3GPP TS 24.250
[31]). If the RDS port numbers are not within the configured RDS port list,
the SCEF shall notify the SCS/AS with NIDD status set to \"RDS_PORT_UNKNOWN\"
and the unknown RDS port numbers. The SCS/AS shall acknowledge the request
with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.
#### 4.4.5.6 Port Management Configuration
##### 4.4.5.6.1 Port Reservation and Release
As part of the Port Management configuration, operations to reserve a
combination of port numbers, release a combination of port numbers, query the
list of port numbers that are reserved and notification of reservation of a
port number may be performed, if the Rds_dynamic_port feature is supported.
Indication of the supported serialization formats by the SCS/AS, query of the
supported and configured serialization formats by the SCS/AS, and notification
of the supported and configured serialization formats by the SCS/AS may be
performed if the Rds_serialization_format feature is supported.
If the SCS/AS needs to reserve port numbers and associate them with an
application, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT message to the SCEF, using the
URI received in the response to the request that has created the NIDD
configuration resource and the specific part of \"/rds-ports/{portId}\" as
described in clause 5.6.3.9.2. The SCS/AS may use this operation to reserve
port numbers on the UE and SCEF and associate them with an application. The
SCS/AS may also use this operation to indicate the serialization formats that
are supported by the SCS/AS on the port. Upon receipt of the HTTP PUT request
from the SCS/AS,
\- if the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"false\" and if the \"individual
ManagePort Configuration\" resource already exists in the same NIDD
configuration, the SCEF shall respond with a 403 Forbidden response with a
cause value \"PORT_NOT_FREE\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" data structure; otherwise, the SCEF shall interact with the
UE via the SGSN/MME to reserve the port and optionally configure the
serialization format by using RDS protocol as specified in 3GPP TS 24.250 [31]
and return a 202 Accept response to the SCS/AS if successful response is
received from the SGSN/MME. Then if the SCEF receives successful UE response,
the SCEF shall create the \"individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource and
notify the SCS/AS with the reserved port and configured serialization format
as specified in clause 4.4.5.6.2, the SCEF shall also mark the resource is
created by the SCS/AS; otherwise, the SCEF shall notify the SCS/AS about the
currently reserved ports as specified in clause 4.4.5.6.2.
\- if the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"true\" and if the requested SCEF port
already exists in an NIDD configuration within the same APN, the SCEF shall
respond with a 403 Forbidden response with a cause value \"PORT_NOT_FREE\" in
the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure; otherwise,
the SCEF shall create the \"individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource and
send an HTTP 201 Created response to the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall also mark the
resource is created by the SCS/AS and notify the UE by using RDS protocol as
specified in 3GPP TS 24.250 [31].
If the SCEF is not able to configure a serialization format for the port and
if the Rds_serialization_format feature is supported, the SCEF shall respond
with a 500 Internal Server Error response with a cause value
\"SERIALIZATION_FORMAT_NOT_SUPPORTED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" data structure.
If the SCS/AS needs to release port numbers associated with an application,
the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF, using the URI
received in the response to the request that has created the \"individual
ManagePort Configuration\" resource. Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE request
from the SCS/AS, if the \"individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource does
not exist in the same NIDD configuration, the SCEF shall respond with a 404
Not Found response with a cause value \"PORT_NOT_ASSOC_WITH_APP\" in the
\"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" data structure; otherwise if the
\"individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource was created by the SCS/AS and
\- if the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"false\", the SCEF shall interact with
the UE via the SGSN/MME to release the port by using RDS protocol as specified
in 3GPP TS 24.250 [31] and return 202 Accept to the SCS/AS if successful
response is received from the SGSN/MME. Then upon receipt of the UE response,
the SCEF shall notify the SCS/AS with the currently reserved ports as
specified in clause 4.4.5.6.2.
\- if the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"true\", the SCEF shall delete the
individual ManagePort Configuration resource and respond with an HTTP 204 No
Content response to the SCS/AS. The SCEF shall also notify the UE by using RDS
protocol as specified in 3GPP TS 24.250 [31].
If the HTTP DELETE request is received for the \"Individual ManagePort
Configuration\" resource which was created by the UE, the SCEF shall reject
the message with a 403 Forbidden response with a cause value
\"OPERATION_PROHIBITED\" in the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\"
data structure.
If the \"skipUeInquiry\" is set to \"false\" and the SCEF is not able to
interact with the UE because:
\- PDN connection is not established, the SCEF shall reject the HTTP
PUT/DELETE request with a 500 Internal Server Error response with a cause
value \"NO_PDN_CONNECTION\";
\- UE is not reachable, the SCEF shall reject the HTTP PUT/DELETE request with
a 500 Internal Server Error response with a cause value
\"TEMPORARILY_NOT_REACHABLE\". The response may include a Requested Re-
Transmission time to indicate the SCS/AS when the UE is expected to be
reachable so that the SCS/AS may prepare any re-configuration for the RDS
port; or
\- the interaction with the SGSN/MME is not successful, the SCEF shall reject
the HTTP PUT/DELETE request with a 500 Internal Server Error and a proper
cause value indicating the reason for the delivery failure.
If the SCS/AS needs to read the port numbers and serialization formats that
are associated with an application, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP GET message
to the SCEF, using the URI received in the response to the request that has
created the NIDD configuration resource and the specific part of \"/rds-
ports/{portId}\" as described in clause 5.6.3.9.2.
##### 4.4.5.6.2 Port Notification
If the SCEF needs to send the information about reserved ports and their
configuration to the SCS/AS (e.g. due to 3GPP network created or released
\"individual ManagePort Configuration\" resource upon UE triggered RDS port
management procedures as specified in 3GPP TS 24.250 [31]), the SCEF shall
send an HTTP POST message to the SCS/AS, using the URI received within the
\"notificationDestination\" attribute in the NiddConfiguration resource. The
body of the message is encoded in JSON format with the data structure defined
in table 5.6.2.1.9-1. The SCS/AS shall acknowledge the HTTP POST request with
an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No Content response.
### 4.4.6 Procedures for Device Triggering
The procedures are used by the SCS/AS to deliver the device trigger via T8
interface.
In order to create a new device trigger, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST
message to the SCEF for the \"Device Triggering Transactions\" resource. The
body of the HTTP POST message shall include the External Identifier or MSISDN,
validity period, priority, Application Port ID and trigger payload.
Upon receipt of the corresponding HTTP POST message, the SCEF shall check if
the SCS/AS is authorised to send a trigger request and if the SCS/AS has
exceeded its quota or rate of trigger submission. The SCEF shall also resolve
the External Identifier or MSISDN to IMSI and retrieve the \"Routing
Information\" from HSS for the triggering delivery. If the authorisation check
fails, or if the quota or rate of trigger submission was exceeded, or if there
is no valid subscription information or if the \"Routing Information\" cannot
be found, then the SCEF shall reject the request with an error message to the
SCS/AS. Otherwise, the SCEF shall perform the device trigger procedure over
Tsp as defined in 3GPP TS 29.368 [24] and T4 as defined in 3GPP TS 29.337
[25]. Upon completion of this procedure, the SCEF shall create a resource
\"Individual Device Triggering Transaction\" which represents the triggering
transaction, addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identity and an SCEF-
created transaction identifier, and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201
Created message, including the trigger and a Location header field containing
the URI for the created resource. The SCS/AS shall use the URI received in the
Location header in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this device
triggering transaction.
In order to replace an existing device trigger, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP
PUT message to the SCEF for the \"Individual Device Triggering Transaction\"
resource, using the URI received in the response to the request that has
created the device triggering transaction resource. The body of the HTTP PUT
message shall include the DeviceTriggering data structure containing the
requested updates. The properties \"msisdn\" or \"externalId\" shall remain
unchanged from the previously provided value.
If the \"PatchUpdate\" feature defined in clause 5.7.4 is supported, in order
to partially modify an existing Individual Device Triggering Transaction
resource, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH message to the SCEF targeting
the concerned \"Individual Device Triggering Transaction\" resource, using the
URI received in the response to the request that has created the concerned
Individual Device Triggering Transaction resource. The body of the HTTP PATCH
message shall include the DeviceTriggeringPatch data structure containing the
requested modifications.
After receiving the corresponding HTTP PUT / HTTP PATCH message from the
SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check if the SCS/AS is authorised to replace/modify an
existing device trigger and if the SCS/AS has not exceeded its quota or rate
of trigger submission. If any of these checks fail, then the SCEF shall reject
the message with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.
Otherwise, the SCEF shall replace the device triggering with the SMS-SC by
performing the device trigger replace procedure over Tsp as defined in 3GPP TS
29.368 [24] and T4 as defined in 3GPP TS 29.337 [25]. Upon completion of this
procedure, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a \"200
OK\"status code and include the result in the body of the HTTP response or a
\"204 No Content\" status code to indicate a successful trigger
replacement/modification; otherwise, the SCEF shall send a corresponding
failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.
In order to recall an existing device trigger, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP
DELETE message to the SCEF for the \"Individual Device Triggering
Transaction\" resource, using the URI received in the response to the request
that has created the device triggering transaction resource.
After receiving the corresponding HTTP DELETE message from the SCS/AS, the
SCEF shall check if the SCS/AS is authorised to send a recall trigger request
and if the SCS/AS has not exceeded its quota or rate of trigger submission.
The SCEF shall also check if the device triggering transaction resource
referenced by the URI exists. If any of these checks fail, then the SCEF shall
reject the message with an error. Otherwise, the SCEF shall recall the device
triggering with the SMS-SC by performing the device trigger recall procedure
over Tsp as defined in 3GPP TS 29.368 [24] and T4 as defined in 3GPP TS 29.337
[25]. Upon completion of this procedure, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response
to the SCS/AS to indicate trigger recall success or failure.
When it receives the Message Delivery Report from the SMS/SC, the SCEF shall
send an HTTP POST message to the SCS/AS to report the trigger delivery result.
The body of the HTTP POST message shall include the identifier if the
transaction and cause. The SCS/AS shall respond with an HTTP 200 OK or 204 No
Content response.
### 4.4.7 Procedures for Group Message Delivery
#### 4.4.7.1 General
This procedure is used by an SCS/AS to deliver a payload to a group of UEs.
Two methods of Group Message Delivery via the T8 are specified:
\- Group Message Delivery via MBMS which is intended to efficiently distribute
the same content to the members of a group that are located in a particular
geographical area when MBMS is used. This method further includes two
varieties:
\- the MB2 interface (see stage 2 in 3GPP TS 23.468 [55] and stage 3 in 3GPP
TS 29.468 [36]) is used as southbound interface;
\- the xMB interface (see stage 2 in 3GPP TS 26.348 [56] and stage 3 in 3GPP
TS 29.116 [37]) is used as southbound interface.
\- Group Message Delivery via unicast MT NIDD for UEs which are part of the
same External Group Identifier.
NOTE: Group Message Delivery via MT NIDD is defined in clause 4.4.5.3.2.
Error handling for the procedures in the subsequent clauses shall be handled
based on clause 5.2.6.
#### 4.4.7.2 Group Message Delivery via MBMS
##### 4.4.7.2.1 General
This procedure is used by an SCS/AS to deliver a payload to a group of UEs via
the T8 interface. The SCEF use the Group Message Delivery via MBMS to
efficiently distribute the same content to the members of a group that are
located in a particular geographical area when MBMS is used.
The procedure of Group message Delivery via MBMS and MB2 used as southbound
interface is described in caluse 4.4.7.2.2 and the procedure of Group message
Delivery via MBMS and xMB used as southbound interface is described in caluse
4.4.7.2.3.
##### 4.4.7.2.2 Group Message Delivery via MBMS by MB2
###### 4.4.7.2.2.1 TMGI Allocation
If the SCS/AS acts as a GCS AS in the application level and if there is no
assigned TMGI for an External Group Identifier, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP
message to the SCEF to the resource \"TMGI Allocation\". The body of the HTTP
POST request message shall include the External Group Identifier. The SCS/AS
may also include the location information in the body.
Upon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to allocate a TMGI, the
SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to request TMGI allocation.
If authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate TMGI allocation by the
BM-SC as defined in clause 5.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.468 [36]. Upon successful
allocation of a TMGI, the SCEF shall create the resource which represents the
TMGI allocation, addressed by a URI that contains the SCS identity and TMGI,
and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created message including the TMGI
and the TMGI expiration time.
In order to renew the TMGI expiration time, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT
or PATCH message to the SCEF to the resource \"Individual TMGI Allocation\".
Upon receipt of the HTTP PUT or PATCH request from the SCS/AS to renew TMGI
expiration time, the SCEF shall initiate TMGI expiration time renewal to the
BM-SC as defined in clause 5.2.1 of 3GPP TS 29.468 [36]. Upon successful
result, the SCEF shall update the resource and respond to the SCS/AS by
sending an HTTP response with 200 OK including the new TMGI expiration time or
204 No Content if the required TMGI expiration time renewal is successful with
no content in the HTTP PUT or PATCH response message body.
If the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for the
allocation of TMGI or renewal of expiration time for the existing TMGI, the
SCEF shall not create or update the resource and shall respond to the SCS/AS
with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.
Upon the TMGI expiration, the SCEF may delete the resource of the TMGI
locally.
Upon receipt of the notification of TMGI expiration by the BM-SC as defined in
clause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.468 [36], the SCEF shall delete the resource if not
yet deleted.
###### 4.4.7.2.2.2 TMGI Deallocation
In order to deallocate the TMGI, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message
to the SCEF to the resource \"Individual TMGI Allocation\". Upon receipt of
the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS to deallocate the TMGI, the SCEF shall
initiate TMGI deallocation by the BM-SC as defined in clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS
29.468 [36]. Upon successful deallocation of a TMGI, the SCEF shall delete the
resource \"Individual TMGI Allocation\" together with all sub-resouces \"GMD
via MBMS by MB2\" if available,and shall respond to the SCS/AS by sending an
HTTP response with 204 No Content.
###### 4.4.7.2.2.3 Creation of group message delivery
If the SCS/AS acts as a GCS AS in the application level and if the SCS/AS has
an assigned TMGI for the External Group Identifier, in order to perform the
group message delivery, the SCS/AS shall sends an HTTP POST request message to
the SCEF to the resource \"GMD via MBMS by MB2\". The body of the HTTP POST
request message shall include the External Group Identifier and notification
destination URI identifying the recipient of notification within the
\"notificationDestination\" attribute. The SCS/AS may also include the Group
Message Payload, the location information and a Message Delivery Start Time in
the body.
The SCS/AS may also send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF directly to the
resource \"TMGI Allocation\" without previously requesting TMGI allocation as
defined in clause 4.4.7.2.2. The SCEF shall create the resource \"Individual
TMGI Allocation\" and perform the procedure as define in clause 4.4.7.2.2, and
shall also create resource \"GMD via MBMS by MB2\" and perform the procedure
as mentioned in this subcaluse for MBMS bearer creation.
Upon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to deliver the group
message, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to send a group
message request. It also checks to see if the Message Delivery Start Time does
not start after the TMGI expiration. If authorization is successful, the SCEF
shall initiate the Active MBMS Bearer procedure as defined in clause 5.3.2 of
3GPP TS 29.468 [36] with the difference that the SCEF acts as a GCS AS. The
SCEF shall include the location information based on the local configuration
if the location information is not provided in the HTTP POST request message.
Upon successful activation of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall create resource
which represents \"Individual GMD via MBMS by MB2\", addressed by a URI that
contains Transaction Id allocated by the SCEF and respond to the SCS/AS by
sending an HTTP response with a 201 Created status code, including a Location
header field containing the URI for the created resource. When the SCS/AS
receives the URI in the Location header, it shall use this URI in subsequent
requests to the SCEF to refer to this active MBMS bearer. If the Group Message
Payload was not include in the HTTP POST above, the HTTP response sent from
the SCEF shall also include the SCEF message delivery Ipv4 address or Ipv6
address and port number.
If the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for the
activation of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall not create the resource and shall
respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause
5.2.6.
If the Group Message Payload was included the HTTP POST above, the SCEF shall
deliver to BM-SC the Group Message Payload(s) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.468
[36] at Message Delivery Start Time.
If the Group Message Payload was not include in the HTTP POST above, the SCEF
shall transfer the contents received from the SCS/AS to the BM-CS at or after
the requested Group Message Start Time, but before the TMGI Expiration time.
In this case, when the SCEF detects the group message delivery was triggered
successful, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST request message to the SCS/AS.
NOTE: If Group Message Payload was included, then at Message Delivery Start
Time, the SCEF delivers to BM-SC the Group Message Payload(s) to corresponding
to MB2-U IP address and port number associated with respective TMGI.
###### 4.4.7.2.2.4 Modification of previous submitted group message delivery
If the SCS/AS determines that modification of previous accepted Group Message
Delivery Request is required, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT
request message to the SCEF to the resource \"Individual GMD via MBMS by
MB2\". The body of the HTTP PATCH request message shall include the Message
Delivery Start Time. The SCS/AS may also include the External Group
Identifier, the Group Message Payload and the location information in the
body. The body of the HTTP PUT request message shall include the information
as the information provided in the HTTP POST in clause 4.4.7.2.2.2.3. The body
of the HTTP PATCH request message shall include the information defined in the
data type of GMDViaMBMSByMb2Patch as defined in clause 5.8.2.1.1.6.
Upon receipt of the HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT request from the SCS/AS to modify
the previous group message delivery subscription, the SCEF shall check whether
the SCS/AS is authenticated and authorized to modify the submitted group
message delivery. If the authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate
the Modify MBMS Bearer procedure as defined in clause 5.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.468
[36] with the difference that the SCEF acts as a GCS AS. The SCEF shall
include the location information based on the local configuration if the
location information is not provided in the HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT request
message.
Upon successful modification of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall update the
resource and respond to the SCS/AS with a 200 OK success message indicating
that previous group message delivery subscription is successfully updated, or
204 No Content if the updates or replacement is successful with no content in
the HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT response message body.
If the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for the
modification of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall not update the resource and shall
respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause
5.2.6.
###### 4.4.7.2.2.5 Cancellation of previous submitted group message delivery
If the SCS/AS determines that deletion of previous accepted Group Message
Delivery Request is required, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE request
message to the SCEF.
Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS to delete the previous
group message delivery, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is
authenticated and authorized to delete an existing group message delivery
subscription. If the authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate the
Delete MBMS Bearer procedure as defined in clause 5.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.468 [36]
with the difference that the SCEF acts as a GCS AS.
Upon successful deletion of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS
with a 204 No Content message indicating that submitted group message delivery
is successfully deleted.
##### 4.4.7.2.3 Group message Delivery via MBMS by xMB
###### 4.4.7.2.3.1 Service Creation
If the SCS/AS acts as a content provider in the application level and if there
is no assigned Service ID for an External Group Identifier, the SCS/AS shall
send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF to the resource \"xMB Services\". The
body of the HTTP POST request message shall include the External Group
Identifier.
Upon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to create a service, the
SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to request service creation.
If authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate service creation by
the BM-SC as defined in clause 5.2.1.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.116 [37]. Upon
successful service creation, the SCEF shall create the resource which
represents the service creation, addressed by a URI that contains the SCS
identity and Service Id, and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created
message which may include the service announcement information.
If the SCEF receives the response with an error status code from the BM-SC for
the service creation, the SCEF shall not create or update the resource and
shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in
clause 5.2.6.
###### 4.4.7.2.3.2 Service Deletion
In order to delete the service, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message
to the SCEF to the resource \"Individual xMB Service\". Upon receipt of the
HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS to delete the service, the SCEF shall
initiate service deletion by the BM-SC as defined in clause 5.2.1.2.4 of 3GPP
TS 29.116 [37]. Upon successful deletion of a service, the SCEF shall delete
the resource \"Individual xMB Service\" together with all sub-resouces \"GMD
via MBMS by xMB\" if available, and shall respond to the SCS/AS by sending an
HTTP response with 204 No Content.
###### 4.4.7.2.3.3 Creation of group message delivery
If the SCS/AS acts as a content provider in the application level, the SCS/AS
may sends an HTTP POST request message to the SCEF to the resource \"GMD via
MBMS by xMB\". The body of the HTTP POST request message shall include the
External Group Identifier and notification destination URI identifying the
recipient of notification within the \"notificationDestination\" attribute.
The SCS/AS may also include the Group Message Payload, the location
information, a Message Delivery Start Time and Message Delivery Stop Time in
the body.
Upon receipt of the HTTP POST request from the SCS/AS to deliver the group
message, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to send a group
message request. It also checks to see if the Message Delivery Start Time
doesn\'t start after the Message Delivery Stop Time. If authorization is
successful, the SCEF shall initiate the Create Session procedure as defined in
clause 4.4.5.2 of 3GPP TS 29.116 [37] and the Update Session procedure as
defined in clause 4.4.5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.116 [37] with the difference that the
SCEF acts as a Content Provider, Session Start is set accordiong to the
Message Delivery Start Time and the Session Stop is set according to the
Message Delivery Stop Time. The SCEF shall include the location information
based on the local configuration if the location information is not provided
and include the session type set to \"Files\" in the HTTP POST request
message.
Upon successful activation of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall create resource
which represents \"Individual GMD via MBMS by xMB \", addressed by a URI that
contains Transaction Id allocated by the SCEF and respond to the SCS/AS by
sending an HTTP response with a 201 Created status code, including a Location
header field containing the URI for the created resource. When the SCS/AS
receives the URI in the Location header, it shall use this URI in subsequent
requests to the SCEF to refer to this active MBMS bearer. If the Group Message
Payload was not included in the HTTP POST above, the HTTP response sent from
the SCEF shall also include the SCEF message delivery Ipv4 address or Ipv6
address and port number.
If the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for the
activation of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall not create the resource and shall
respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause
5.2.6.
If the Group Message Payload was included the HTTP POST above, the SCEF shall
deliver to BM-SC the Group Message Payload(s) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.468
[36] at Message Delivery Start Time.
If the Group Message Payload was not included in the HTTP POST above, the SCEF
shall transfer the contents received from the SCS/AS to the BM-CS at or after
the requested Message Delivery Start Time, but before the Message Delivery
Stop Time. In this case, when the SCEF detects the group message delivery was
triggered successful, the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST request message to the
SCS/AS.
###### 4.4.7.2.3.4 Modification of previous submitted group message delivery
If the SCS/AS determines that modification of previous accepted Group Message
Delivery Request is required, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT
request message to the SCEF to the resource \"Individual GMD via MBMS by xMB
\". The body of the HTTP PATCH request message shall include the Message
Delivery Start Time and Message Delivery Stop Time. The SCS/AS may also
include the External Group Identifier, the Group Message Payload and the
location information in the body. The body of the HTTP PUT request message
shall include the information as the information provided in the HTTP POST in
clause 4.4.7.2.3.3. The body of the HTTP PATCH request message shall include
the information defined in the data type of GMDViaMBMSByxMBPatch as defined in
clause 5.8.3.1.1.4.
Upon receipt of the HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT request from the SCS/AS to modify
the previous group message delivery subscription, the SCEF shall check whether
the SCS/AS is authenticated and authorized to modify the submitted group
message delivery. If the authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate
the Update Session procedure as defined in clause 4.4.5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.116
[37] with the difference that the SCEF acts as a Content Provider, Session
Start is set accordiong to the Message Delivery Start Time and the Session
Stop is set according to the Message Delivery Stop Time. The SCEF shall
include the location information based on the local configuration if the
location information is not provided in the HTTP PATCH or HTTP PUT request
message.
Upon successful modification of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall respond to the
SCS/AS with a 200 OK success message indicating that previous group message
delivery subscription is successfully updated or with a 204 No Content success
message if no content in the HTTP PUT or PATCH response message body.
If the SCEF receives the response with an error code from the BM-SC for the
modification of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall not update the resource and shall
respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause
5.2.6.
###### 4.4.7.2.3.5 Cancellation of previous submitted group message delivery
If the SCS/AS determines that deletion of previous accepted Group Message
Delivery Request is required, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE request
message to the SCEF.
Upon receipt of the HTTP DELETE request from the SCS/AS to delete the previous
group message delivery, the SCEF shall check whether the SCS/AS is
authenticated and authorized to delete an existing group message delivery
subscription. If the authorization is successful, the SCEF shall initiate the
Delete Session procedure as defined in clause 4.4.5.4 of 3GPP TS 29.116 [37]
with the difference that the SCEF acts as a Content Provider.
Upon successful deletion of MBMS bearer, the SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS
with a 204 No Content message indicating that submitted group message delivery
is successfully deleted.
### 4.4.8 Procedures for Reporting of Network Status
#### 4.4.8.1 General
These procedures are used by an SCS/AS to perform reporting of network status
via the T8 interface in one time or continuous reporting cases. The SCEF uses
the reporting procedures based on the network status information from one or
more RCAF(s). These procedures can also be used by the SCS/AS to indicate the
removal of a previously subscribed reporting request.
#### 4.4.8.2 Network Status Reporting Subscription
In order to create a new subscription to request for notifications on network
status, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST request message to the SCEF on the
\"Network Status Reporting Subscriptions\" resource. The body of the HTTP POST
request shall include a Notification destination address and Location area
information, and may include the time duration and threshold(s).
Upon receiving the HTTP POST request message from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall
check:
\- if the SCS/AS is authorized to perform the request. If not, the SCEF shall
respond to the SCS/AS with an HTTP \"401 Unauthorized\" status code.
\- if the SCS/AS has exceeded its quota of submitting requests. If so the SCEF
shall respond to the SCS/AS with an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" status code and may
indicate the failure reason \"QUOTA_EXCEEDED\" (i.e. the quota exceeded)
within the \"cause\" attribute of the ProblemDetails data structure in the
HTTP POST response.
\- if the SCS/AS has exceeded its rate of submitting requests. If so the SCEF
shall respond to the SCS/AS with an HTTP \"429 Too Many Requests\" status code
in the HTTP POST response.
After the SCEF authorized the HTTP request message, the SCEF shall create an
\"Individual Network Status Reporting Subscription\" resource which represents
the subscription, addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identity and an
SCEF-created subscription identifier, and shall respond to the SCS/AS with an
HTTP \"201 Created\" status code, including a Location header field containing
the URI for the created resource, to acknowledge to the SCS/AS the successful
subscription creation. The SCS/AS shall use the URI received in the Location
header in subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this network status
reporting subscription. Then, the SCEF shall trigger the network status
reporting procedure with the RCAF over Ns interface as defined in 3GPP TS
29.153 [30].
In order to update an existing subscription of continuous network status
reporting, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT request message to the SCEF on
the \"Individual Network Status Reporting Subscription\" resource, using the
URI received in the response to the request that has created the network
status reporting subscription resource. After receiving the HTTP PUT request
message, the SCEF shall send an HTTP PUT response to the SCS/AS with an HTTP
\"200 OK\" status code including a representation of the updated \"Individual
Network Status Reporting Subscription\" resource in the response body, or a
\"204 No Content\" status code. Then, the SCEF shall apply the requested
updatesand interact with the RCAF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.153 [30].
If the \"PatchUpdate\" feature defined in clause 5.9.4 is supported, in order
to partially modify an existing subscription of continuous network status
reporting, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PATCH request message to the SCEF on
the \"Individual Network Status Reporting Subscription\" resource, using the
URI received in the response to the request that has created the network
status reporting subscription resource. The request body shall contain the
NetStatusRepSubsPatch data structure including only the attributes that shall
be updated. After receiving the HTTP PATCH request message, the SCEF shall
send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with an HTTP \"200 OK\" status code
including a representation of the modified \"Individual Network Status
Reporting Subscription\" resource in the response body, or a \"204 No
Content\" status code. Then, the SCEF shall apply the requested changes and
interact with the RCAF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.153 [30].
NOTE: In order to update an existing subscription, the SCEF needs to send a
cancellation to the previously associated RCAF(s) to remove the related SCEF
instructions and then send a new request with updated parameters.
In order to remove an existing subscription of continuous network status
reporting, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE request message to the SCEF on
the \"Individual Network Status Reporting Subscription\" resource, using the
URI received in the response to the request that has created the network
status reporting subscription resource. Upon reception of the HTTP DELETE
request message, the SCEF shall send an HTTP DELETE response to the SCS/AS
with an HTTP \"204 No Content\" status code. Then, the SCEF shall interact
with the RCAF to terminate the continuous reporting of network status as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.153 [30].
#### 4.4.8.3 Network Status Reporting Notification
After receiving reports from all the involved RCAF(s) as defined in 3GPP TS
29.153 [30], the SCEF shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCS/AS using the
identified destination URL, which is provided by the SCS/AS during the network
status reporting subscription. The body of HTTP POST message shall include the
NSI.
### 4.4.9 Procedures for Communication Pattern Parameters Provisioning
One or more set of CP parameters may be provisioned by the SCS/AS for a single
UE or a group of UEs.
In order to create resources for one or more CP parameter set(s), the SCS/AS
shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF for the \"CP Provisioning
Subscriptions\" resource, including one or more new provisioned CP parameter
set(s). The body of HTTP POST message shall include External Identifier or
MSISDN for a single UE or External Group ID for a group of UEs, SCS/AS
Identifier and one or more set of CP information associated with CP parameter
set Id(s).
After receiving the HTTP POST message, the SCEF shall check if the SCS/AS is
authorised. The SCEF may also check if the number of CP parameter sets(s)
reaches the limitation based on operator policy or configuration.
After validation, the SCEF shall for each received CP parameter set Id, assign
an SCEF Reference ID which may be derived from the CP parameter set Id, and
send Update CP Parameter Request message to the HSS for delivering the CP
parameter set(s) as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11].
After receiving result from the HSS, if the result is successful, the SCEF
shall create a resource \"Individual CP Provisioning Subscription\" and the
corresponding sub-resources \"Individual CP Set Provisioning\" each represents
a successfully provisioned CP parameter set indicated by the HSS and respond
to the SCS/AS with a \"201 Created\" including Location header field
containing the URI for the created subscription resource \"Individual CP
Provisioning Subscription\" and the sub-resource(s) \"Individual CP Set
Provisioning\" corresponding to each successful CP parameter set within the
\"self\" attribute in the \"cpParameterSet\" attribute; otherwise, the SCEF
shall not create any resource and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a
corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6. If not all CP
parameters sets are provisioned successfully (i.e. the HSS indicates failure
for some or all CP parameter sets and/or the SCEF does not accept the CP
parameter provisioning (e.g. one or more CP Set Identifiers in the request are
already present in existing subscriptions)), the SCEF shall also include CP
report(s) within attribute \"cpReports\" with a list of failed CP Set
Identifier(s) and the corresponding failure code as specified in table
5.10.2.3.5-1 in the body of the HTTP response.
In order to add new CP parameter set(s), update and/or remove the existing CP
parameter set(s) for one or more CP parameter set Id(s), the SCS/AS may send
an HTTP PUT message to the SCEF for the \"Individual CP Provisioning
Subscription\" resource requesting to add new CP parameter set(s) by creating
new resource(s), change some created properties (e.g. Validity Time) of the
existing resource(s), and/or remove some or entire properties of the existing
resource(s). After receiving the HTTP PUT message, the SCEF shall send the CP
parameter changes to the HSS as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11]. After
receiving the response from the HSS with a successful code, if the HSS
indicates all CP parameter sets or some CP parameter sets are provisioned
successfully, the SCEF shall create or update the corresponding sub-
resource(s) \"Individual CP Set Provisioning\" each represents a successfully
provisioned CP parameter set indicated by the HSS and send an HTTP response to
the SCS/AS with a \"200 OK\" status code and include a list of successful CP
parameter set(s) in the body of the HTTP response, or a \"204 No Content\"
status code. Otherwise, the SCEF shall not create or update the resource(s)
and shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure
code as described in clause 5.2.6. If not all CP parameters sets are
provisioned successfully (i.e. the HSS indicates failure for some or all CP
parameter sets and/or the SCEF does not accept the CP parameter provisioning
(e.g. one or more CP Set Identifiers in the request are already present in
existing subscriptions)), the SCEF shall also include CP report(s) within
attribute \"cpReports\" with a list of failed CP Set Identifier(s) and the
corresponding failure code as specified in table 5.10.2.3.5-1 in the body of
the HTTP response.
The SCS/AS may send a HTTP PUT message to the SCEF for the \"Individual CP Set
Provisioning\" resource requesting to replace an individual resource
identified by the CP parameter set Id. The body of the HTTP PUT message shall
include set of CP information. After receiving such request, the SCEF shall
interact with the HSS as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11]. After receiving the
response from the HSS with a successful code, the SCEF shall update the
resource and send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a \"200 OK\" status code
or a \"204 No Content\" status code; otherwise, the SCEF shall not update the
resource and shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding
failure code as described in clause 5.2.6. If the provisioning of the CP set
fails (i.e. the HSS returns failure for the CP set or the SCEF does not accept
the CP set provisioning), the SCEF shall reject the request with a
corresponding status code, and include the attribute \"cpReports\" with the
corresponding failure code as specified in table 5.10.2.3.5-1 and the CP Set
Identifier for which the provisioning has failed.
The SCS/AS may send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF requesting to delete an
individual CP set resource \"Individual CP Set Provisioning\". After receiving
such request, the SCEF shall determine the SCEF Reference ID for Deletion
associated with the CP parameter set Id, and interact with the HSS as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11]. After receiving the response from the HSS,
the SCEF shall delete the addressed resource and send an HTTP response to the
SCS/AS with a \"204 No Content\" status code.
The SCS/AS may send an HTTP DELETE message to the SCEF requesting to delete an
individual subscription resource \"Individual CP Provisioning Subscription\".
After receiving such request, the SCEF shall determine the SCEF Reference ID
(s) for Deletion associated with the CP parameter set Id(s) and interact with
the HSS as specified in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11]. After receiving the response from
the HSS, the SCEF shall delete the addressed resource and its sub-resources
addressed by \"Individual CP Set Provisioning\" and send an HTTP response to
the SCS/AS with a \"204 No Content\" status code.
### 4.4.10 Procedures for PFD Management
The PFDs associated with application identifier(s) may be created, updated or
removed by the third party SCS/AS as defined in 3GPP TS 23.682 [2].
In order to create PFDs resources for one or more external Application
Identifier(s), the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the request URI
of the resource \"PFD Management Transactions\" including one or more set of
PFDs for external Application Identifier(s). The body of the HTTP POST message
shall include external Application Identifier(s) and PFDs associated with its
PFD Identifier(s), an Allowed Delay may be included for the external
Application Identifier(s) as well.
After receiving the HTTP POST message, if the SCS/AS is authorized, the SCEF
shall provision the PFDs to the PFDF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 [26]. When
receiving the response from the PFDF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to
the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code. If one or more external
application identifiers are provisioned successfully, the SCEF shall create an
\"Individual PFD Management Transaction\" resource for the request and he
corresponding sub-resources \"Individual Application PFD Management\" each
represents a successfully provisioned external application identifier. The
SCEF shall respond to the SCS/AS with a 201 Created including Location header
field containing the URI for the created transaction resource \"Individual PFD
Management Transaction\" and the sub-resource(s) \"Individual Application PFD
Management\" corresponding to each external application identifier within the
\"self\" attribute in the \"PfdData\" data type, the SCEF shall also include
PFD report(s) with a list of external Application Identifier(s) and result(s)
in the body of the HTTP response if some application(s) are not provisioned
successfully (i.e. the PFDF returns failure and/or the SCEF does not accept
the PFD provisioning (e.g. one or more external Application Identifiers in the
request are already present in existing transactions)).
In order to update the PFDs for an existing individual transaction, the SCS/AS
shall send an HTTP PUT message to URI of the resource \"Individual PFD
Management Transaction\" including one or more set of PFDs for external
Application Identifier(s). After receiving the HTTP PUT message, the SCEF
shall make the change and send the change to the PFDF (i.e. add/update/remove
PFDs) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 [26]. After receiving the response from the
PFDF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding
status code. The SCEF shall create or update the corresponding sub-resource(s)
\"Individual Application PFD Management\" each represents a successfully
provisioned external application identifier, and also include PFD report(s)
with a list of external Application Identifier(s) and result(s) in the body of
the HTTP response if some application(s) are not provisioned successfully
(i.e. the PFDF returns failure and/or the SCEF does not accept the PFD
provisioning (e.g. one or more external Application Identifiers in the request
are already present in existing transactions)).
NOTE 1: When the PUT for \"Individual PFD Management Transaction\" is received
in the SCEF, SCEF can use partial update or full update towards the PFDF.
If the \"PatchUpdate\" feature defined in clause 5.11.4 is supported, in order
to partially modify an existing PFD Management Transaction, the SCS/AS shall
send an HTTP PATCH request message to the SCEF on the \"Individual PFD
Management Transaction\" resource, using the URI received in the response to
the request that has created the concerned PFD Management Transaction
resource. The request body shall contain the PfdManagementPatch data structure
including only the attributes that shall be updated. After receiving the HTTP
PATCH request, the SCEF shall apply the requested modifications and interact
with the concerned PFDF to add/update/remove PFD(s) as defined in 3GPP TS
29.250 [26]. After receiving the response of the PFDF, the SCEF shall send an
HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code. The SCEF shall
then create or update the corresponding \"Individual Application PFD
Management\" sub-resource(s), with each represents a successfully provisioned
external application identifier. If some application(s) are not provisioned
successfully (i.e. the PFDF returns a failure and/or the SCEF does not accept
the PFD provisioning (e.g. one or more external Application Identifiers in the
request are already present in existing transactions)), the SCEF shall also
include PFD report(s) containing a list of external Application Identifier(s)
and result(s) in the body of the HTTP response.
In order to remove the PFDs for an existing individual transaction, the SCS/AS
shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the URI of the resource \"Individual PFD
Management Transaction\". After receiving such request, the SCEF shall delete
the \"Individual PFD Management Transaction\" resource and its \"Individual
Application PFD Management\" sub-resouce(s), and shall interact with the PFDF
as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 [26]. After receiving the response from the PFDF,
the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status
code.
For the POST message to the resource \"PFD Management Transactions\" or the
PUT message to the resource \"Individual PFD Management Transaction\", if the
provisioning of all application(s) fails (i.e. the PFDF returns failure and/or
the SCEF does not accept the PFD provisioning), the SCEF shall respond with
500 Internal Server Error status code, and include the attribute
\"pfdReports\" with the corresponding failure reason as specified in table
5.11.2.2.3-1 and the external Application Identifier(s) for which the
provisioning has failed.
In order to update the PFDs for an existing external Application Identifier,
the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP PUT message to the resource \"Individual
Application PFD Management\" to update the full set of PFDs of an existing
resource. After receiving the HTTP PUT message, the SCEF shall make the change
and send the change to the PFDF (i.e. add/update/remove PFDs) as defined in
3GPP TS 29.250 [26]. After receiving the response from the PFDF, the SCEF
shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code.
NOTE 2: When the PUT for \"Individual Application PFD Management\" is received
in the SCEF, SCEF can use partial update or full update towards the PFDF.
In order to update the PFDs for an existing external Application Identifier,
the SCS/AS may also send an HTTP PATCH message to URI of the resource
\"Individual Application PFD Management\" to partially update PFDs. After
receiving the HTTP PATCH message, the SCEF shall make the change and send the
change to the PFDF (i.e. add/update/remove PFDs) as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250
[26]. After receiving the response from the PFDF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code.
In order to remove the PFDs for an existing individual application, the SCS/AS
shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the resource \"Individual Application PFD
Management\". After receiving such request, the SCEF shall delete the resource
and interact with the PFDF as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 [26]. After receiving
the response from the PFDF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS
with a corresponding status code.
For the PUT/PATCH message to the resource \"Individual Application PFD
Management\", if the provisioning of the application fails (i.e. the PFDF
returns failure or the SCEF does not accept the PFD provisioning), the SCEF
shall reject the request with a corresponding status code, and include the
attribute \"pfdReports\" with the corresponding failure code as specified in
table 5.11.2.2.3-1 and the external Application Identifier for which the
provisioning has failed.
If the SCEF receives PFD management notification including the PFD failure
report from the PFDF (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.250 [26]) and if the feature
PfdMgmtNotification is supported, the SCEF shall notify the SCS/AS with an
HTTP POST message, identified by the notification destination URI received
during the PFD provisioning, to notify the failure result for the PFD
management by including the PfdReport data type in the body of the message.
Within the PfdReport data type, the SCEF shall include the impacted
application id(s) within the \"externalAppIds\" attribute, the \"failureCode\"
attribute set to \"PARTIAL_FAILURE\". In addition, if the SCEF receives the
location area(s) of PCEF/TDF(s) which are unable to enforce the PFD(s) from
the PFDF, the SCEF shall include the location area(s) within the
\"locationArea\" attribute of the PFD report(s). After receiving the HTTP POST
message, the SCS/AS shall send a HTTP response with \"204 No Content\" status
code.
NOTE 3: How the SCS/AS reacts to the failed PFD provisioning is left to
implementation.
NOTE 4: The SCEF maps the 3GPP network area(s) to the geographic area(s) or
civic address(es) if the 3GPP network area(s) is not allowed to be exposed to
the 3rd party according to the operator policy.
### 4.4.11 Procedures for Enhanced Coverage Restriction Control
The procedures are used by an SCS/AS to query the status of, or to configure
the enhanced coverage restriction for a UE via the T8 interface as defined in
3GPP TS 23.682 [2].
In order to query the current status of enhanced coverage restriction, the
SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to the SCEF using the query custom
operation as defined in clause 5.12.13.2. The body of the HTTP POST message
shall include External Identifier or MSISDN.
In order to configure the enhanced coverage restriction, the SCS/AS shall send
an HTTP POST message to the SCEF using the configure custom operation as
defined in clause 5.12.13.3. The body of the HTTP POST message shall include
External Identifier or MSISDN and the Enhanced Coverage Restriction setting
(i.e. allowed-PLMN-List or restricted-PLMN-List).
Upon receiving the HTTP POST message from the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall check:
\- if the SCS/AS is authorized to perform the request. If not the SCEF shall
respond to the SCS/AS with a status code set to 401 Unauthorized.
\- if the request is malformed. If it is malformed, the SCEF shall respond to
the SCS/AS with a status code set to 400 Bad Request.
\- if the SCS/AS has exceeded its quota of submitting requests. If so the SCEF
shall respond to the SCS/AS with a status code set to 403 Forbidden and may
indicate the failure reason \"QUOTA_EXCEEDED\" (i.e. the quota exceeded)
within the \"cause\" attribute of the \"ProblemDetails\" structure in the HTTP
POST response.
\- if the SCS/AS has exceeded its rate of submitting requests. If so the SCEF
shall respond to the SCS/AS with a status code set to 429 Too Many Requests in
the HTTP POST response.
The SCEF shall send a Configuration Information Request to the HSS to query or
configure the setting of Enhanced Coverage Restriction as defined in 3GPP TS
29.336 [11].
Upon receipt of the response from the HSS, the SCEF shall send an HTTP
response to the SCS/AS with a 200 OK message for query or configure custom
operation and include the Enhanced Coverage Restriction Data from HSS into the
HTTP response.
If the SCEF receives a response with an error code from the HSS, the SCEF
shall respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in
clause 5.2.6.
### 4.4.12 Procedures for Network Parameter Configuration
#### 4.4.12.1 General
The procedures are used by an SCS/AS to request that the network consider
setting the suggested network parameter values which can influence certain
aspects of UE/network behaviour. The procedures are applicable for an
individual UE or a group of UEs.
In order to create a new network parameter configuration to configure
suggested network parameters, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST request
message to the SCEF to the resource \"NP Configurations\". The body of the
HTTP request message shall include External Identifier or MSISDN or External
Group Identifier, SCS/AS Identifier, and may include Maximum Latency, Maximum
Response Time and Suggested Number of Downlink Packets and Group Reporting
Guard Time, wherein, the External Identifier or MSISDN indicates the
configuration for an individual UE and the External Group Identifier indicates
for a group of UEs. If the External Group Identifier is included, the SCS/AS
shall provide the Notification Destination Address in the request.
NOTE: The Notification Delivery as described in clause 5.2.5 is not supported
for individual UE configuration case.
In order to update an existing Network Parameter Configuration, the SCS/AS may
send an HTTP PUT message to the resource \"Individual NP Configuration\"
requesting the SCEF to replace all properties in the existing resource.
The SCS/AS may also use an HTTP PATCH message to request to change some
properties in the existing resource.
Upon receipt of the HTTP POST, PUT or PATCH message, if the SCS/AS is
authorized to perform the request, the SCEF shall check whether the Maximum
Latency, Maximum Response Time and/or Suggested Number of Downlink Packets in
the HTTP request body are within the range defined by operator policies, if
one or more of these parameters are not within the range, the SCEF shall:
\- either reject the request message by sending an HTTP response to the SCS/AS
with a status code set to \"403 Forbidden\" , in which it may indicate the
\"PARAMETER_OUT_OF_RANGE\" application error in the \"cause\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" data structure and it may also indicate which parameters
are out of the range in the \"invalidParams\" attribute of the
\"ProblemDetails\" structure in the response body; or
\- modify the parameters which are not within the range by selecting different
values which are in the range.
After validation, the SCEF shall perform the Network Parameter Configuration
as described in clause 4.4.12.2 for an individual UE or in clause 4.4.12.3 for
a group of UEs.
In order to delete an existing Network Parameter Configuration at the SCEF,
the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the corresponding resource
\"Individual NP Configuration\" at the SCEF. The SCEF shall determine the SCEF
Reference ID for deletion and interact with the HSS via S6t as defined in 3GPP
TS 29.336 [11]. Upon receipt of the response from the HSS, the SCEF shall
delete active resource \"Individual NP Configuration\" addressed by the URI
and send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a \"204 No Content\" status code.
#### 4.4.12.2 Configuration Request for an individual UE
If the configuration request from the SCS/AS is for an individual UE, the SCEF
shall send the Configuration Information Request command to the HSS via S6t as
defined in 3GPP TS 29.336 [11].
Upon receipt of the response from the HSS, the SCEF shall,
\- for the HTTP POST message, create a new resource \"Individual NP
Configuration\" addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identifier and an
SCEF-created configuration identifier, and send an HTTP POST response to the
SCS/AS with \"201 Created\" status code, the final suggested configuration
parameter(s) (if modified), the indication(s) for the discarded parameter(s)
(if discarded), and a location header field containing the URI for the created
resource.
\- for the HTTP PUT or PATCH message, update the active resource \"Individual
NP Configuration\", and send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with \"200 OK\"
status code, the final suggested network parameter(s) (if modified), the
indication(s) for the discarded parameter(s) (if discarded), or a \"204 No
Content\" status code.
If the SCEF receives a response with an error code from the HSS, the SCEF
shall not create or update the resource and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a
corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.
#### 4.4.12.3 Configuration Request for a group of UEs
If the configuration request from the SCS/AS is for a group of UEs, the SCS/AS
shall provide the Notification Destination Address, the SCEF shall send the
Configuration Information Request command to the HSS via S6t as defined in
3GPP TS 29.336 [11].
Upon receipt of the successful response indicating that group processing is in
progress from the HSS before beginning the processing of individual UEs, the
SCEF shall,
\- for the HTTP POST message, create a resource \"Individual NP
Configuration\" addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identity and an
SCEF-created configuration identifier. The SCEF shall send an HTTP POST
response to the SCS/AS including a location header field containing the URI
for the created resource and a \"201 Created\" status code to acknowledge the
SCS/AS of the successful group processing request.
\- for the HTTP PUT or PATCH message, update the resource \"Individual NP
Configuration\" addressed by the requested URL, and shall send \"200 OK\"
status code or a \"204 No Content\" status code to acknowledge the SCS/AS of
the successful group processing request in the HTTP response message.
If the SCEF receives a response with an error code from the HSS, the SCEF
shall not create or update the resource and shall respond to the SCS/AS with a
corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.
Upon receipt of the processing result of the individual UEs from the HSS, the
SCEF shall send an HTTP POST request message with a reference to the related
network parameter configuration and a list of processing result for the group
members to the SCS/AS.
The SCS/AS shall send an HTTP response to acknowledge the SCEF about the
handling result of the received request.
#### 4.4.12.4 Notification of applied parameter configuration
If the Enhanced_param_config feature is supported and the SCEF receives
currently applied parameter configuration from the HSS, the SCEF shall notify
the SCS/AS by the HTTP POST message including the parameter changes in the
\"appliedParam\" attribute.
### 4.4.13 Procedures for setting up an AS session with required QoS
This procedure is used to set up an AS session with required QoS for the
service as defined in 3GPP TS 23.682 [2].
For initial AS session creation, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP POST message to
the SCEF for the \"AS Session with Required QoS Subscriptions\" resource. The
body of HTTP POST message shall include SCS/AS Identifier, UE IP address, IP
Flow description, QoS reference and notification destination address. And it
may also include time period and/or traffic volume for sponsored data
connectivity purpose. If the feature AppId is supported, either the Flow
description or an external Application Identifier shall be included.
After receiving the HTTP POST message, the SCEF shall authorize the request
and may check if the total number of requested QoS reference has exceeded the
limit for the SCS/AS. If the authorization is successful, the SCEF shall map
the SCS/AS Identifier to AF Application Identifier if the external Application
Identifier is not provided and only one AF Application Identifier is mapped,
and if required, map the SCS/AS Identifier to ASP Identity and Sponsor
Identity.
NOTE 1: Before the QoS reference is mapped to Rx parameters, the SCEF can
perform a mapping from the name space of the 3rd party SCS/AS to the name
space of the operator.
NOTE 2: The QoS reference referring to pre-defined QoS information in the SCEF
can be mapped to media component descriptions (e.g. bandwidth, media type)
according to SLA.
If the authorization performed by the SCEF is successful, then the SCEF shall
act as an AF to interact with the PCRF via the Rx interface as defined in 3GPP
TS 29.214 [10] or 3GPP TS 29.201 [13] and trigger a PCRF initiated IP-CAN
Session Modification. Based on local configuration, the SCEF may also request
to be notified about the transmission resource status, i.e.
INDICATION_OF_SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION,
INDICATION_OF_RELEASE_OF_BEARER, INDICATION_OF_FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION,
and optionally INDICATION_OF_LOSS_OF_BEARER and
INDICATION_OF_RECOVERY_OF_BEARER. If the time period and/or traffic volume are
received from the AF, the SCEF should subscribe to the PCRF on the
USAGE_REPORT event.
If the \"enNB\" feature is supported, the SCEF may explicitly receive a list
of user plane event(s) that the SCS/AS requests to subscribe to. The SCEF
shall subscribe to the corresponding PCRF event(s) (e.g.
INDICATION_OF_SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCE_ALLOCATION) for the received event(s) (e.g.
SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION), except for the SESSION_TERMINATION event.
NOTE 3: The PCRF does not need explicit subscription in order to notify Rx
session termination.
The SCEF, after receiving the AAA message or HTTP 201 Created message over the
Rx interface from the PCRF with successful result code, shall create a
resource \"Individual AS Session with Required QoS Subscription\" which
represents AS session, addressed by a URI that contains the SCS/AS identity
and an SCEF-created AS session identifier, and shall respond to the SCS/AS
with a 201 Created message, including the result in the body of the HTTP
response and a Location header field containing the URI for the created
resource. The SCS/AS shall use the URI received in the Location header in
subsequent requests to the SCEF to refer to this AS session. Otherwise, the
SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a corresponding status
code and include the result in the body of the HTTP response. If the SCEF
receives a response with an error code from the PCRF, the SCEF shall not
create the resource and respond to the SCS/AS with a corresponding failure
code as described in clause 5.2.6.
In order to update the established AS session, the SCS/AS may send an HTTP PUT
message to the SCEF for the \"Individual AS Session with Required QoS
Subscription\" resource requesting to replace all properties (e.g. new usage
threshold, Flow Description or external Application Identifier) in the
existing resource, addressed by the URI received in the response to the
request that has created the resource. The UE IP or MAC address shall remain
unchanged from previously provided values. After receiving such message, the
SCEF shall make the change (e.g. if the usage threshold within the
\"usageThreshold\" attribute is included in the HTTP PUT request and the
accumulated usage report for the previously provided usage threshold is not
received yet, the SCEF shall completely replace the previously provided one),
and interact with the PCRF to modify the Rx session (as defined in 3GPP TS
29.214 [10] or 3GPP TS 29.201 [13]). After receiving the response with
successful result code from the PCRF, the SCEF shall replace all properties of
the existing resource, send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a \"200
OK\"status code, and include the result in the body of the HTTP response or a
\"204 No Content\" status code. If the SCEF receives a response with an error
code from the PCRF, the SCEF shall not update the resource and respond to the
SCS/AS with a corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.2.6.
The SCS/AS may also send an HTTP PATCH message to the SCEF for the
\"Individual AS Session with Required QoS Subscription\" resource requesting
to change some created properties (e.g. new usage threshold, Flow Description
or external Application Identifier, updated list of user plane event(s) if the
\"enNB\" feature is supported). After receiving the HTTP PATCH message, the
SCEF shall make the change (e.g. if the usage threshold within the
\"usageThreshold\" attribute is included in the HTTP PATCH request and the
accumulated usage report for the previously provided usage threshold is not
received yet, the SCEF shall completely replace the previously provided one),
and interact with the PCRF to modify the Rx session (as defined in 3GPP TS
29.214 [10] or 3GPP TS 29.201 [13]). After receiving the response from the
PCRF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a \"200
OK\"status code and include the result in the body of the HTTP response, or a
\"204 No Content\" status code.
NOTE 4: The SCS/AS can assume a successful resource allocation upon receipt of
the POST/PUT/PATCH response, until the FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION event is
received.
NOTE 5: The SCS/AS can update the list of user plane event(s) only for one
time specific events, i.e. INDICATION_OF_SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION,
INDICATION_OF_FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION and USAGE_REPORT events, as
specified in clause 5.3.13 of 3GPP TS 29.214 [10].
If the SCEF receives a traffic plane notification (e.g. the usage threshold is
reached or transmission resource lost), or if the SCEF gets informed that the
Rx session is terminated (e.g. due to a release of PDN connection), the SCEF
shall send an HTTP POST message including the notified event (e.g. session
terminated) and the accumulated usage (if received from the PCRF) to the
callback URI \"notificationUri\" provided by the SCS/AS during the creation of
individual AS Session with Required QoS Subscription. The SCS/AS shall respond
with an HTTP response to confirm the received notification.
In order to remove the established AS session, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP
DELETE message to the SCEF for the \"Individual AS Session with Required QoS
Subscription\" resource. After receiving the HTTP DELETE message, the SCEF
shall remove all properties and interact with the PCRF to terminate the Rx
session (as defined in 3GPP TS 29.214 [10] or 3GPP TS 29.201 [13]). After
receiving the response from the PCRF, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to
the SCS/AS with a corresponding status code and include the accumulated usage
(if received from the PCRF).
### 4.4.14 Procedures for MSISDN-less Mobile Originated SMS
#### 4.4.14.1 General
The procedures are used by the SCEF to send the MSISDN-less MO-SMS to the
SCS/AS via T8 interface.
#### 4.4.14.2 Delivery of MSISDN-less MO SMS
If the SCEF receives an MSISDN-less MO-SMS via T4 including an destination SME
address (long/short code of the SCS/AS), the SCEF will use the IMSI of the UE
and application port ID received over T4 to query the HSS/HLR for an external
ID, and the SCEF shall then determine the notification destination URL of an
SCS/AS based on configured information on the mapping of SME addresses to
destination URLs. The SCEF shall send to the determined destination URL an
HTTP POST request that shall include an MsisdnLessMoSmsNotification data type
with:
\- the short message transfer protocol data unit as received on the T4
interface.
\- the Application Port as received on the T4 interface, and
\- the external identifier of the UE that send the SMS, as received from the
HSS/HLR.
NOTE: The Notification Delivery using Websocket (see clause 5.2.5.4) and the
Notification Test Event (see clause 5.2.5.3) are not supported for the present
API.
### 4.4.15 Procedures for RACS Parameter Provisioning
The procedures are used by an SCS/AS to request that the network to provision
manufacturer specific UE radio capability information.
In order to create a new parameter provisioning, the SCS/AS shall send an HTTP
POST request message to the SCEF to the resource \"RACS Parameter
Provisionings\". The body of the HTTP POST request message shall include a
list of RACS IDs, and for each provided RACS ID, its radio capability
parameters and the related UE model(s) IMEI-TAC value(s).
In order to fully replace an existing RACS Parameter Provisioning, the SCS/AS
may send an HTTP PUT message to the resource \"Individual RACS Parameter
Provisioning\" requesting the SCEF to change all properties in the existing
resource. The body of the HTTP PUT request message shall include a list of
RACS IDs, and for each provided RACS ID, its radio capability parameters and
the related UE model(s) IMEI-TAC value(s).
In order to partial update an existing RACS Parameter Provisioning, the SCS/AS
may send an HTTP PATCH message to the resource \"Individual RACS Parameter
Provisioning\" requesting the SCEF to change some properties in the existing
resource.
Upon receipt of the HTTP POST, PUT or PATCH message, if the SCS/AS is
authorized to perform the request, the SCEF shall interact with the UCMF as
described in 3GPP TS 29.675 [61]. After receiving the response from the UCMF,
if at least one RACS ID is succesfully provisioned, the SCEF shall create or
update the resource \"Individual RACS Parameter Provisioning\" and respond
with 201 Created or 200 OK to the SCS/AS respectively with the successfully
provisioned RACS information or 204 No Content if the updates or replacement
is successful with no content in the PATCH or PUT response message body, the
SCEF may include RACS report(s) within attribute \"racsReports\" with a list
of RACS ID(s) and the corresponding failure code for which the provisioning
has failed as specified in table 5.16.2.2.3-1 in the body of the HTTP
response. Otherwise, the SCEF shall send an HTTP response to the SCS/AS with a
corresponding failure code as described in clause 5.16.5. If all the RACS IDs
failed to be provisioned succeessfully, the SCEF may send a \"500 Internal
Server Error\" HTTP response and may include in the response body failure
reports as specified in clause 5.16.3.
In order to delete an existing RACS Parameter Provisioning at the SCEF, the
SCS/AS shall send an HTTP DELETE message to the corresponding resource
\"Individual RACS Parameter Provisioning\" at the SCEF. Upon receipt of the
DELETE request message, the SCEF shall interact with the UCMF as described in
3GPP TS 29.675 [61]. After receiving the response from the UCMF, the SCEF
shall remove the resource and respond with 204 No Content to the SCS/AS.

#### 5.2.1.4 Conventions for documenting structured data types
The structured data types shall represent an object (see IETF RFC 8259 [40]).
The structured data types shall contain attributes that are simple data types,
structured data types, arrays (see below), maps (see below) or enumerations.
An array (see IETF RFC 8259 [40]) shall represent a list of values without
keys and with significance in the order of sequence. All values shall be of
the same type.
A map shall represent an object (see IETF RFC 8259 [40]) with a list of key-
value pairs (with no significance in the order of sequence), where all keys
are of type string and shall be unique identifiers assigned by the application
rather than by the schema, and where all values shall be of the same type.
NOTE 1: Maps are supported by the OpenAPI specification [27] as described at
https://swagger.io/docs/specification/data-models/dictionaries/. Maps can
enable a faster lookup of elements identified by some key in huge data
structures compared to arrays that contain the key within the elements. Maps
can also be used instead of arrays to modify individual elements when
modification instructions of the PATCH method are compliant to IETF RFC 7396
[39].
Each structured data type shall be specified in a separate clause as
illustrated in table 5.2.1.4-1.
Table 5.2.1.4-1: Definition of type \
* * *
Attribute name Data type Cardinality Description \ \"_\
_\" or \"array _(\ _)\" or \"map _(\ _)\" \"0..1\", \"1\",
or \"_M_.._N_ \", \
* * *
**Attribute name** : Name of attributes that belong to the specified data
type.
**Data type** : Data type of the attribute. If the data type is indicated as
\"_\ _\", the attribute shall be of data type _\ ._ If the data
type is indicated as \"array(_\ _)\", the attribute shall be an array
(see IETF RFC 8259 [40]) that contains elements of data type _\ _. If
the data type is indicated as \"map (_\ _)\", the attribute shall be an
object (see IETF RFC 8259 [40]) encoding a map (see OpenAPI specification
[27]) that contains as values elements of data type _\ _. _\ _ can
either be \"integer\", \"number\", \"string\" or \"boolean\" (as defined in
the OpenAPI specification [27]), or a data type defined in a 3GPP
specification.
**Cardinality** : Defines the allowed number of occurrence of data type
\. A cardinality of \"M..N\", is only allowed for data types
\"array(\)\" and \"map(\)\" and indicates the number of elements
within the array or map; the values M and N can either be the characters \"M\"
and \"N\", respectively, or integer numbers with M being greater than or equal
0, and N being greater than 1 and M, For data type \"\\", the
cardinality shall be set to \"0..1\" or \"1\". A lower boundary of \"0\" for
the cardinality also indicates that the attribute is optional. A lower
boundary of \"0\" for the cardinality indicates that the attribute is
optional.
NOTE 2: The \"0..N\" implies the array or map type of the attribute may be
optional. If the attribute is present, the minimum number of elements is
described in openAPI file.
**Description** : Describes the meaning and use of the attribute and may
contain normative statements.
### 5.2.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 5.2.2.1 General
For T8 APIs, support of HTTP/1.1 (IETF RFC 7230 [16], IETF RFC 7231 [17], IETF
RFC 7232 [18], IETF RFC 7233 [19], IETF RFC 7234 [20] and IETF RFC 7235 [21])
over TLS is mandatory and support of HTTP/2 (IETF RFC 7540 [22]) over TLS is
recommended. TLS shall be used as specified in clause 5.5 of 3GPP TS 33.187
[35]. An SCS/AS desiring to use HTTP/2 shall use the HTTP upgrade mechanism to
negotiate applicable HTTP version as described in IETF RFC 7540 [22].
#### 5.2.2.2 Usage of the HTTP PATCH method
The HTTP PATCH method, as defined in IETF RFC 5789 [38], allows for a partial
update of previously sent data, e.g. resources. For a complete replacement of
previously sent data, the HTTP PUT method is used. It is defined separately
for each resource whether the HTTP PUT and/or the HTTP PATCH are applicable.
If the HTTP PATCH method is used:
\- if no modification of individual elements within an array needs to be
supported, the JSON bodies within the PATCH request shall be encoded according
to \"JSON Merge Patch\", as defined in IETF RFC 7396 [39]; or
\- if a modification of individual elements within an array needs to be
supported, the \"JSON Patch\" encoding of changes defined in IETF RFC 6902
[67] shall be used.
### 5.2.3 Content type
The bodies of HTTP request and successful HTTP responses shall be encoded in
JSON format (see IETF RFC 8259 [5]).
The MIME media type that shall be used within the related Content-Type header
field is \"application/json\", as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [5].
JSON object used in the HTTP PATCH request shall be encoded according to:
\- \"JSON Merge Patch\" and shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/merge-patch+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7396 [39]; or
\- \"JSON Patch\" and shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/json-patch+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 6902 [67].
\"Problem Details\" JSON object shall be used to indicate additional details
of the error in a HTTP response body and shall be signalled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7807 [8].
NOTE: This release only supports the content type JSON.
### 5.2.4 URI structure
#### 5.2.4.1 Resource URI structure
Resources are either individual resources, or structured resources that can
contain child resources. It is recommended to design each resource following
one of the archetypes provided in the Annex C of 3GPP TS 29.501 [49].
All API URIs of T8 APIs shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\**
\"apiRoot\" is configured by means outside the scope of the present document.
\"apiName\" and \"apiVersion\" shall be set dependent on the API, as defined
in the corresponding clauses below. All resource URIs in the clauses below are
defined relative to the above root API URI.
NOTE 1: The \"apiVersion\" will only be increased if the new API version
contains not backward compatible changes. Otherwise, the supported feature
mechanism defined in clause 5.2.7 can instead be used to negotiate extensions.
NOTE 2: A different root structure can be used when the Resource URI is
preconfigured in the SCS/AS.
The root structure may be followed by \"apiSpecificSuffixes\" that are
dependent on the API and are defined separately for each API as resource URI
where they apply:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
The naming conventions defined in clause 5.1.3 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [49] shall
apply.
#### 5.2.4.2 Custom operations URI structure
The URI of a custom operation which is associated with a resource shall have
the following structure:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\/\**
Custom operations can also be associated with the service instead of a
resource. The URI of a custom operation which is not associated with a
resource shall have the following structure:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
In the above URI structures, \"apiRoot\", \"apiName\", \"apiVersion\" and
\"apiSpecificSuffixes\" are as defined in clause 5.2.4.1 and \"custOpName\"
represents the name of the custom operation as defined in clause 5.1.3.2 of
3GPP TS 29.501 [49].
#### 5.2.4.3 Callback URI structure
The purpose of the callback URI is to enable an HTTP client (the SCS/AS or
SCEF) to provide the URI to be used by an HTTP server (the SCEF or SCS/AS) to
send notifications or callback requests.
The callback URI shall be in the form of an absolute URI as defined in clause
4.3 of IETF RFC 3986 [7], including an authority, and excluding any query
component, any fragment component and any userinfo subcomponent.
Therefore, a callback URI consists of the following components, specified with
ABNF syntax (see IETF RFC 5234 [69]):
URI = scheme \":\" \"//\" host [ \":\" port ] / path
Where \'host\' is either an FQDN or an IP address and the \'path\' is a path
to an HTTP client (the SCS/AS or SCEF) resource.
### 5.2.5 Notifications
#### 5.2.5.1 General
The SCEF and SCS/AS shall support the delivery of Notifications using a
separate HTTP connection towards an address assigned by the SCS/AS, as
described in clause 5.2.5.2.
An SCEF and SCS/AS may support testing a notification connection as described
in clause 5.2.5.3. An SCEF and SCS/AS may support the delivery of Notification
using Websocket (IETF RFC 6455 [32]) as described in clause 5.2.5.4.
#### 5.2.5.2 Notification Delivery using a separate HTTP connection
If a delivery of notifications is required for an API, the SCS/AS shall
provide a notification destination URI, which designates to the SCEF where the
SCEF shall send the HTTP Notifications. This URI is provided within an
attribute (e.g. \"notificationDestination\", \"notifUri\",
\"notificationUri\") defined in the data types that are passed in a request to
create a resource that represents a subscription to notifications, unless it
is specified for that API that a preconfigured destination address is used.
The SCS/AS may provide the same notification destination URI for several
subscriptions, and the SCEF should then use the same HTTP connection to
deliver related notifications.
The SCEF shall take the role of the HTTP client on the HTTP connection for the
delivery of Notifications. Clause 5.2.2 shall also apply for this HTTP
connection with the exception that an SCEF (rather than an SCS/AS) desiring to
use HTTP/2 shall use the HTTP upgrade mechanism to negotiate applicable HTTP
version.
#### 5.2.5.3 Notification Test Event
If the optional \"Notification_test_event\" feature is supported, the SCS/AS
may test whether notifications can be received by subscribing to the
notification of a test event by providing a \"requestTestNotification\"
attribute set to \"true\" in the HTTP request to create or update a
subscription for notifications. In any other HTTP request or response, this
attribute shall retain the value that was provided upon subscription resource
creation.
Upon receiving the \"requestTestNotification\" attribute as part of a
subscription creation or update request, the SCEF shall send immediately after
establishing the notification delivery mechanism a test notification
containing a body formatted according to the \"TestNotification\" data type as
defined in clause 5.2.1.2.12. If the SCS/AS does not receive the test
notification within a configured time, the SCS/AS knows that the notification
delivery with the selected method is not possible and may take corrective
actions.
#### 5.2.5.4 Notification Delivery using Websocket
The procedures in the present clause only apply if SCS/AS and SCEF support the
\"Notification_websocket\" feature. If the feature \"Notification_websocket\"
is supported, then the feature \"Notification_test_event\" shall also be
supported.
If a delivery of notifications is required for an API and the SCS/AS does not
know from previous interactions with the SCEF whether delivery of
notifications over a separate HTTP connection works, the SCS/AS should
initially request the SCEF to try to establish a separate HTTP connection for
notification delivery according to clause 5.2.5.2 by providing a URI to the
SCEF designating where to send HTTP Notifications, and shall also subscribe to
the notification of a test event as in clause 5.2.5.3.
If the SCS/AS does not receive the requested notification of the test event
during a configured period after the subscription, the SCS/AS may configure
the subscription to request the SCEF to provide a URI for an HTTP connection
to upgrade to Websocket, setting the \"requestWebsocketUri\" attribute to
\"true\" as specified in clause 5.2.1.2.13. The SCS/AS may also request the
SCEF to provide a URI in a new subscription creation request, and should in
this case terminate the original subscription.
NOTE 1: If the SCS/AS has requested the delivery of notifications to a
separate entity, it needs to be informed by that separate entity about the
receipt of the test notification. That communication between the separate
entity and the SCS/AS is out of scope of the present document.
When the SCEF receives a subscription creation or update request to use
Websockets to deliver notifications (i.e. with the \"requestWebsocketUri\"
attribute set to \"true\"), it shall assign a Websocket URI where to receive a
Websocket connection establishment and provide this URI in the
\"websocketUri\" attribute in the response, as defined in clause 5.1.2.1.13.
Once such Websocket URI has been assigned for a particular subscription
resource, subsequent update requests to this resource that ask for the
assignment of a new Websocket URI for that subscription shall be rejected by
the SCEF.
Upon the reception of the Websocket URI from the SCEF in the \"websocketUri\"
attribute, as specified in clause 5.2.1.2.13-1, in the subscription creation
or subscription update response, the SCS/AS or a separate entity that is
intended to receive the notification shall establish an HTTP connection
towards that URI and shall upgrade that connection to the Websocket protocol
(IETF RFC 6455 [32]) using the HTTP upgrade mechanism defined in IETF RFC 7230
[16].
NOTE 2: For delivery of Notifications to a separate entity, the SCS/AS needs
to provide the Websocket URI to that separate entity. That communication
between the SCS/AS and the separate entity is out of scope of the present
document.
The following framing of the request and response shall be used when
delivering a notification or acknowledging its delivery through Websockets.
NOTE 3: The framing is aligned as much as possible with HTTP delivery in order
to simplify implementations.
To deliver a notification towards the SCS/AS, the SCEF shall embed the
following structure in a separate Websocket data frame with 0x2 (Binary)
opcode in the following order:
1) The string \"3GPP-WS-Notif-Seq:\", followed by a blank, followed by a four-
byte sequence number, encoded as decimal number in ASCII, followed by CRLF
2) The following HTTP headers in any order, with the syntax and semantics as
defined in IETF RFC 7230 [16] and IETF RFC 7231 [17]: Content-Type
(mandatory), Content-Encoding (optional), Content-Length (mandatory). Every
HTTP header line shall be ended by CRLF.
3) CRLF to end the headers section.
4) The payload body of the notification, as defined in the individual APIs.
NOTE 4: The payload body is the same as the one that would be used if
delivering the notification as defined in clause 5.2.5.3.
To acknowledge the reception of a notification message towards the SCEF, the
SCS/AS shall embed the following structure in a separate Websocket data frame
with 0x2 (Binary) opcode in the following order:
1) The string \"3GPP-WS-Notif-Seq:\", followed by a blank, followed by the
four-byte sequence number of the notification to be confirmed, encoded as
decimal number in ASCII, followed by CRLF.
2) The HTTP status code (e.g. 204) and status message (e.g. No Content) as
defined for HTTP delivery of the notification in the individual APIs,
separated by a single blank character, and ended by CRLF.
3) Conditionally, as defined in IETF RFC 7230 [16] and IETF RFC 7231 [17], the
following HTTP headers in any order: Content-Type, Content-Encoding, and
Content-Length. Every HTTP header line shall be ended by CRLF.
4) CRLF to end the headers section.
5) The payload body of the response, if applicable based on the status code
and the HTTP headers, as defined in IETF RFC 7230 [16] and IETF RFC 7231 [17].
NOTE 5: The status code, the status message and the payload body (if
applicable), are the same as if delivering the notification as defined in
clause 5.2.5.3.
Use of CRLF is defined in IETF RFC 7230 [16].
The SCEF need not wait for the confirmation of each notification before
delivering the next notification. The SCEF shall determine whether a
notification has been delivered successfully by correlating the sent
notification with the received acknowledgement by checking the sequence
numbers of both for equality. The SCEF may re-send a notification, using the
same sequence number, if it has not received an acknowledgement with a
matching sequence number after a configurable time-out. The SCS/AS shall
consider notifications with the same sequence number that arrive within a
configurable time interval as duplicates.
The SCS/AS should send periodic Websocket \"PING\" frames to keep the
connection alive.
NOTE 6: the TCP layer will handle a possible fragmentation and reassembly of
large messages.
The security related clause 6 shall also apply for the HTTP connection that is
upgraded to Websocket.
### 5.2.6 Error handling
Table 5.2.6-1 lists response bodies that are applicable to all APIs and as
responses for all requests in the present specification unless otherwise
specified. The HTTP client shall mandatorily support the processing of the
status code for all the applicable methods, when received in a HTTP response
message. In such cases the HTTP client shall also support the handling of the
\"ProblemDetails\" JSON object with the Content-Type header field set to the
value \"application/problem+json\", if the corresponding API definition in the
current specification does not specify another response body for the
corresponding status code.

5.2.8.3.2 Nbi-Api-Sender-Timestamp
The provisions of clause 5.2.3.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [44] also apply to this
header.
NOTE: Any provisions that are specific to 5G SBI APIs (e.g. related to the
support of Indirect Communication models) are however not applicable for
Northbound APIs.
5.2.8.3.3 Nb-Api-Max-Rsp-Time
The provisions of clause 5.2.3.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [44] also apply to this
header.
NOTE: Any provisions that are specific to 5G SBI APIs (e.g. related to the
support of Indirect Communication models) are however not applicable for
Northbound APIs.
5.2.8.3.4 Nbi-Api-Lci
The header contains a comma-delimited list (see IETF RFC 7230 [16]) of Load
Control Information (LCI). See clause 5.2.11.
The encoding of the header follows the ABNF as defined in IETF RFC 7230 [16].
Nb-Api-Lci = \"Nb-Api-Lci:\" 1#(RWS timestamp \";\" RWS lcMetric \")
timestamp = \"Timestamp:\" RWS DQUOTE date-time DQUOTE
Mandatory parameter. The date-time type is specified in IETF RFC 5322 [66] and
clause 7.1.1.1 of IETF RFC 7231 [17]. It indicates the timestamp associated
with the load control information.
lcMetric = \"Load-Metric:\" RWS (DIGIT / %x31-39 DIGIT / \"100\") \"%\"
Mandatory parameter. Load-Metric is up to 3 digits long decimal string and the
value range shall be from 0 to 100.
EXAMPLE: Load Control Information:
> Nbi-Api-Lci: Timestamp: \"Tue, 04 Feb 2021 08:50:28 GMT\"; Load-Metric: 50%
5.2.8.3.5 Nb-Api-Oci
The header contains a comma-delimited list of Overload Control Information
(OCI). See clause 5.2.11.
The encoding of the header follows the ABNF as defined in IETF RFC 7230 [16].
Nb-Api-Oci = \"Nb-Api-Oci:\" 1#(RWS timestamp \";\" RWS validityPeriod \";\"
RWS olcMetric \")
timestamp = \"Timestamp:\" RWS DQUOTE date-time DQUOTE
Mandatory parameter. The date-time type is specified in IETF RFC 5322 [66] and
clause 7.1.1.1 of IETF RFC 7231 [17]. It indicates the timestamp at which the
overload control information was generated.
validityPeriod = \"Period-of-Validity:\" RWS 1*DIGIT \"s\"
Mandatory parameter. Period of validity is a timer that is measured in
seconds. Once the timer expires, the OCI becomes invalid.
olcMetric = \"Overload-Reduction-Metric:\" RWS (DIGIT / %x31-39 DIGIT /
\"100\") \"%\"
Mandatory parameter. Overload-Reduction-Metric up to 3 digits long decimal
string and the value range shall be from 0 to 100.
EXAMPLE: Overload Control Information:
> Nbi-Api-Oci: Timestamp: \"Tue, 04 Feb 2021 08:50:28 GMT\"; Period-of-

### 5.2.9 Conventions for Open API specification files
#### 5.2.9.1 General
T8 Open API specification files shall comply with the OpenAPI specification
[27] and with the present clause.
Each API shall be described in one Open API specification file. In addition,
3GPP specifications may contain Open API specification file with common data
types.
For the purpose of referencing (see clause 5.2.9.6), it is assumed that each
Open API specification file contained in a 3GPP specification is stored as
separate physical, that all Open API specification files are stored in the
same directory on the local server, and that the files are named according to
the conventions in clause 5.2.9.6.
#### 5.2.9.2 Formatting of OpenAPI files
The following guidelines shall be used when documenting OpenAPI files:
\- OpenAPI specifications shall be documented using YAML format (see YAML 1.2
[41]). For specific restrictions on the usage of YAML in OpenAPI, see OpenAPI
Specification [27].
\- The style used for the specification shall be \"PL\" (Programming
Language).
\- The different scopes in the YAML data structures representing collections
(objects, arrays...) shall use an indentation of two white spaces.
\- Comments may be added by following the standard YAML syntax (\"#\").
\- Tabs shall not be used in OpenAPI specification files (e.g. within
description fields).
\- \"Unbreakable\" spaces (UTF-8 \'NO-BREAK SPACE\' (U+00A0)) shall not be
used in OpenAPI specification files (e.g. within description fields). Only
\"normal\" spaces (UTF-8 \'SPACE\' (U+0020)) shall be allowed.
\- Trailing spaces (i.e. white spaces at the end of a line) should not be used
in OpenAPI specification files.
#### 5.2.9.3 Structured data types
The OpenAPI file shall contain a definition in the components/schemas section
defining a schema with the name of the structured data type as key.
The schema shall contain:
\- \"type: object\";
\- \"description: _\ _\", where _\ _ is the
description of the data type in the table defining the structured data type.
The \"description\" attribute should be provided for all data types, specially
if they are frequently reused from the same or other OpenAPI specification
files; the \"description\" attribute shall always be provided for data types
defined as maps, with a clear indication of the values (strings) used as key
of the map;
\- if any attributes in the structured data type are marked as mandatory via a
minimum cardinality greater than \"0\", a \"required\" keyword listing those
attributes; and
\- a \"properties\" keyword containing for each attribute in the structured
data type an entry with the attribute name as key and:
1\. if the data type is \"_\ _\":
a. if the data type of the attribute is \"string\", \"number\", \"integer\",
or \"boolean\", a type definition using that data type as value (\"type: _\
_\"); or
b. otherwise a reference to the data type schema for the data type _\ _ of the attribute, i.e. \"\$ref: \'#/components/schemas/_\ _\'\" if that data type schema is contained in the same OpenAPI file and
\"\$ref: \'_\ _#/components/schemas/_\ _\'\" if that data
type schema is contained in file _\ _ in the same directory on the
same server;
2\. if the data type is \"array _(\ _)\":
a. a type definition \"type: array\";
b. an \"items:\" definition containing:
i). if the data type of the attribute is \"string\", \"number\", \"integer\",
or \"boolean\", a type definition using that data type as value (\"type: _\
_\"); or
ii). otherwise a reference to the data type schema for the data type _\ _ of the attribute, i.e. \"\$ref: \'#/components/schemas/_\ _\'\" if that data type schema is contained in the same OpenAPI file and
\"\$ref: \'_\ _#/components/schemas/_\ _\'\" if that data
type schema is contained in file _\ _ in the same directory on the
same server;
c. if the cardinality contained an integer value _\ _ as lower boundary,
\"minItems: _\ _\"; and
d. if the cardinality contained an integer value _\ _ as upper boundary,
\"maxItems: _\ _\";
3\. if the data type is \"map _(\ _)\":
a. a type definition \"type: object\";
b. an \"additionalProperties:\" definition containing:
i). if the data type of the attribute is \"string\", \"number\", \"integer\",
or \"boolean\", a type definition using that data type as value (\"type: _\
_\"); or
ii). otherwise a reference to the data type schema for the data type _\ _ of the attribute, i.e. \"\$ref: \'#/components/schemas/_\ _\'\" if that data type schema is contained in the same OpenAPI file and
\"\$ref: \'_\ _#/components/schemas/_\ _\'\" if that data
type schema is contained in file _\ _ in the same directory on the
same server;
c. if the cardinality contained an integer value _\ _ as lower boundary,
\"min Properties: _\ _\"; and
d. if the cardinality contained an integer value _\ _ as upper boundary,
\"max Properties: _\ _\"; and
4\. \"description: _\ _\", where _\ _ is the
description of the attribute in the table defining the structured data type;
the \"description\" attribute shall always be provided for attributes defined
as maps, with a clear indication of the values (strings) used as key of the
map.
NOTE 1: An omission of the \"minProperties\", and \"maxProperties\" keywords
indicates that no lower or upper boundaries respectively, for the number of
properties in an object are defined. An omission of the \"minItems\", and
\"maxItems\" keywords indicates that no lower or upper boundaries,
respectively, for the number of items in an array are defined.
NOTE 2: The \"0..N\" implies the array or map type of the attribute may be
optional. If the attribute is present, the minimum number of elements is
described in openAPI file.
Example:
Table 5.2.9.3-1: Definition of type ExampleStructuredType
* * *
Attribute name Data type Cardinality Description exSimple ExSimple 1 exSimple
attribute description exArrayElements array(string) 1..10 exArrayElements
attribute description exMapElements map(ExStructure) 1..N exMapElements
attribute description, indicating the values of the map key
* * *
The data structure in table 5.2.9.3-1 is described in an OpenAPI file as
follows:
components:
schemas:
ExampleStructuredType:
type: object
description: ExampleStructuredType data type description
required:
\- exSimple
\- exMapElements
properties:
exSimple:
\$ref: \'#/components/schemas/ExSimple\'
exArrayElements:
type: array
items:
type: string
minItems: 1
maxItems: 10
description: exArrayElements attribute description
exMapElements:
type: object
additionalProperties:
\$ref: \'#/components/schemas/ExStructure\'
minProperties: 1
description: exMapElements attribute description, indicating the values of the
map key
NOTE 3: Object schema definitions should not have property names in the
\"required\" attribute for which a corresponding property definition does not
exist.
#### 5.2.9.4 Info
The Open API specification file of an API shall contain an \"info\" field with
the title and version as defined in clause 4.3 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [49].
#### 5.2.9.5 Servers
As defined in clause 5.2.4, the base URI of an API consists of **{apiRoot}/\
/\**. It shall be encoded in the corresponding Open API
specification file as \"servers\" field with **{apiRoot}** as variable.
Example:
servers:
\- url: \'{apiRoot}/3gpp-yyyy/v1\'
variables:
apiRoot:
default: https://demohost.com
description: apiRoot as defined in clause 5.2.4 of 3GPP TS 29.122.
#### 5.2.9.6 References to other 3GPP-defined Open API specification files
For the purpose of referencing, it shall be assumed that each Open API
specification file contained in a 3GPP specification is stored as separate
physical file, that all Open API specification files are stored in the same
directory on the local server, and that the files are named according to the
following convention: The file name shall consist of (in the order below):
\- the 3GPP specification number in the format \"Tsxxyyy\";
\- an \"_\" character;
\- if the OpenAPI specification file contains an API definition, the API name
as defined for corresponding base URL parts (see clause 4.4) of that API.
\- if the OpenAPI specification file contains a definition of CommonData, the
string \"CommonData\"; and
\- the string \".yaml\".
Examples:
Reference to Data Type \"Xxx\" defined in the same file
\$ref: \'#/components/schemas/Xxx\'
Reference to Data Type \"Xxx\" defined as Common Data in 3GPP TS 29.122:
\$ref: \'TS29122_CommonData.yaml#/components/schemas/Xxx\'
Reference to Data Type \"Xxx\" defined within API \"Nxxx_Yyy\" in 3GPP TS
ab.cde:
\$ref: \'Tsabcde_Nxxx_Yyy.yaml#/components/schemas/Xxx\'
#### 5.2.9.7 Server-initiated communication
If an API contains notifications as described in clause 5.2.5, it should be
described as \"callback\" in Open API specification files.
Example:
paths:
/subscriptions:
post:
requestBody:
required: true
content:
application/json:
schema:
type: object
properties:
callbackUrl: # Callback URL
type: string
format: uri
responses:
\'201\':
description: Success
callbacks:
myNotification: # arbitrary name
\'{\$request.body#/callbackUrl}\': # refers The callback URL in the POST
post:
requestBody: # Contents of the callback message
required: true
content:
application/json:
schema:
\$ref: \'#/components/schemas/NotificationBody\'
responses: # Expected responses to the callback message
\'200\':
description: xxx
#### 5.2.9.8 Describing the body of HTTP PATCH requests
##### 5.2.9.8.1 General
As described in clause 5.2.2.2, the bodies of HTTP PATCH requests either use a
\"JSON Merge Patch\" encoding as defined in IETF RFC 7396 [39], or a \"JSON
Patch\" encoding as defined in IETF RFC 6902 [67].
It is possible to allow both encodings in an OpenAPI Specification [27]
offering both schemas as alternative contents.
##### 5.2.9.8.2 JSON Merge Patch
In the OpenAPI file, the content field key of the Request Body Object shall
contain \"application/merge-patch+json\". The content field value is a Media
Type Object identifying the applicable patch body Schema Object. The patch
body Schema Object may contain structured data types derived from the data
types used in the schema to describe a complete representation of the resource
in such a manner that attributes that are allowed to be modified are listed in
the \"properties\" validation keyword.
NOTE 1: A derived structured data type is beneficial if the data types used to
describe a complete representation of the resource contains mandatory
attributes, if attributes are allowed to be removed by the PATCH operation, or
if a checking by the OpenAPI tooling that only allowed modifications are done
via the \"additionalProperties: false\" keyword is desired. It also provides a
clear description in the OpenAPI file to developers which modifications need
to be supported.
As an alternative, the data types used in the schema to describe a complete
representation of the resource may be used if any attributes that are allowed
to be removed are marked as \"nullable: true\" in that schema.
Any attributes that are allowed to be removed shall be marked as \"nullable:
true\" in the patch body Schema Object.
The \"additionalProperties: false\" keyword may be set.
NOTE 2: The \"additionalProperties: false\" keyword enables the OpenAPI
tooling to check that only allowed modifications are done. Extensions of the
object in future releases are still possible under the assumption that the
supported features mechanism is used to negotiate the usage of any new
attribute prior to the PATCH invocation. If new optional attributes are
expected to be introduced without corresponding supported feature or if PATCH
can be used as first operation in an API, the usage of the
\"additionalProperties: false\" keyword is not appropriate.
##### 5.2.9.8.3 JSON PATCH
In the OpenAPI file, the content field key of the Request Body Object shall
contain \"application/json-patch+json\". The content field value is a Media
Type Object identifying the applicable patch body. It may contain a mutually
exclusive list (using the \"oneOf\" keyword) of all allowed modifications as
\ tuples, where \"path\" is a string containing a JSON
Pointer value referring to a JSON object that is allowed to be modified,
\"op\" is an enumeration of allowed JSON PATCH operations on the JSON object
identified by \"path\" and \"value\" representing the schema/type of the value
that will be updated or added at the JSON object identified by \"path\". In
addition, an open alternative containing an object with no properties may be
added using the \"anyOf\" keyword.
NOTE 1: A mutually exclusive list provides a clear description in the OpenAPI
specification file to developers which modifications need to be supported.
This is of particular interest if only a limited number of modifications need
to be supported. If no open alternative is included, the OpenAPI tooling will
also check that only allowed modifications are done.
NOTE 2: The open alternative allows for extensions of the PATCH in scenarios
where new optional attributes are expected to be introduced without
corresponding supported feature or if PATCH can be used as first operation in
an API.
#### 5.2.9.9 Error Responses
As described in clause 5.2.6, T8 APIs use valid HTTP response codes as error
codes in HTTP responses and may include a \"ProblemDetails\" data structure
specified in clause 5.2.1.2.12 or an application-specific data structure.
Clause 5.2.6 specifies HTTP status code per HTTP method. OpenAPI files should
include at least the status codes in that table.
For the purpose of referencing, HTTP error responses with \"ProblemDetails\"
data structure are specified as part of the CommonData OpenAPI file in Annex
A.2.
Example:
In the example below, the 400, and 500 and default error response descriptions
are referenced.
Paths:
/users:
get:
responses:
\'200\':
content:
application/json
schema:
\$ref: \'#/components/schemas/ExampleGetBody\'
\'400\':
\$ref: \'TS29122_CommonData.yaml#/components/responses/400\'
\'500\':
\$ref: \'TS29122_CommonData.yaml#/components/responses/500\'
default:
\$ref: \'TS29122_CommonData.yaml#/components/responses/default\'
The following definitions provided in Annex A.2 are used in that example:
components:
responses:
\'400\':
description: Bad request
content:
application/problem+json:
schema:
\$ref: \'#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails\'
\'500\':
description: Internal Server Error
content:
application/problem+json:
schema:
\$ref: \'#/components/schemas/ProblemDetails\'
default:
description: Generic Error
#### 5.2.9.10 Enumerations
For enumerations, the OpenAPI file shall contain a definition in the
components/schemas section defining a schema with the name of the enumeration
as key.
The naming conventions defined in clause 5.1.4 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [49] shall
apply.
The schema
\- shall contain the \"anyOf\" keyword listing as alternatives:
1\. the \"type: string\" keyword and the \"enum\" keyword with a list of all
defined values for the enumeration; and
2\. the \"type: string\" keyword and the \"description\" keyword with a
description stating that the string is only provided for extensibility and is
not used to encode contents defined in the present version of the
specification. And
\- may contain a description listing the defined values of the enumeration
together with explanations of those values.
NOTE: The \"enum\" keyword restricts the permissible values of the string to
the enumerated ones. This can lead to extensibility problems when new values
need to be introduced.
Example:
Table 5.2.9.10-1: Enumeration ExampleEnumeration
* * *
Enumeration value Description Applicability ONE Value ONE description  
TWO Value TWO description
* * *
The data structure in table 5.2.9.10-1 is described in an OpenAPI file as
follows:
components:
schemas:
ExampleEnumeration:
anyOf:
\- type: string
enum:
\- ONE
\- TWO
\- type: string
description: >
This string provides forward-compatibility with future
extensions to the enumeration but is not used to encode
content defined in the present version of this API.
description: \|
Possible values are:
\- ONE: Value ONE description
\- TWO: Value TWO description
#### 5.2.9.11 Read only attribute
Each OpenAPI specification should include \"readOnly: true\" for those
attributes that are only provided by the SCEF in the HTTP response message to
prevent the SCS/AS from provisioning those attributes which is not expected,
if the write and read operations (e.g. POST request and response) share the
same data type which contains those attributes.
Example:
NiddStatus:
anyOf:
\- type: string
enum:
\- ACTIVE
\- TERMINATED_UE_NOT_AUTHORIZED
\- TERMINATED
\- type: string
description: >
This string provides forward-compatibility with future
extensions to the enumeration but is not used to encode
content defined in the present version of this API.
Description: >
Possible values are
\- ACTIVE: The NIDD configuration is active.
\- TERMINATED_UE_NOT_AUTHORIZED: The NIDD configuration was terminated because
the UE´s authorisation was revoked.
\- TERMINATED: The NIDD configuration was terminated.
readOnly: true
#### 5.2.9.12 externalDocs
Each OpenAPI specification shall provide in an \"externalDoc\" field the
reference to the 3GPP TS describing the API, as illustrated below.
Example:
externalDocs
description: 3GPP TS 29.122 V15.1.0 T8 reference point for Northbound APIs
url: http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/29_series/29.122/
#### 5.2.9.13 Operation identifiers
Service operations defined in an OpenAPI specification file should be assigned
an Operation ID.
EXAMPLE:
> get:
>
> operationId: ReadInfo
>
> summary: Read Information.
>
> tags:
>
> \- Information (Document)
>
> parameters:
>
> \- name: infoType
>
> in: path
>
> description: Requested information Type
>
> required: true
>
> schema:
>
> type: string
>
> (...)
#### 5.2.9.14 Usage of the \"tags\" field
In an OpenAPI specification, all HTTP operations belonging to the same
resource should include a \"tags\" field containing a same value, briefly
describing that resource (e.g. using the name of the resource and its
archetype). This results in all operations being grouped by the User Interface
of OpenAPI tools, which helps with readability of the API documentation.
EXAMPLE:
openapi: 3.0.0
(...)
paths:
**/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}** :
**get** :
summary: Retrieve an existing Individual subscription resource.
operationId: GetIndSubsc
tags:
\- **Individual Subscription (Document)**
(...)
**put** :
summary: Request the update of an existing Individual Subscription resource.
operationId: UpdateIndSubsc
tags:
\- **Individual Subscription (Document)**
(...)
**patch** :
summary: Request the modification of an existing Individual Subscription
resource.
operationId: ModifyIndSubsc
tags:
\- **Individual Subscription (Document)**
(...)
### 5.2.10 Redirection handling
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different target entity.
Upon receipt of an HTTP request from the SCS/AS, when the SCEF redirects the
HTTP request to a different target SCEF, the URI of the target SCEF towards
which the request is redirected shall be given by the Location header field of
the \"307 Temporary Redirect\" or \"308 Permanent Redirect\" response. The
SCS/AS should then send the HTTP request towards the new target SCEF.
Upon receipt of a notification/callback request from the SCEF, when the SCS/AS
redirects the notification/callback request to a different target SCS/AS, the
URI of the target SCS/AS towards which the notification/callback request is
redirected shall be given by the Location header field of the \"307 Temporary
Redirect\" or \"308 Permanent Redirect\" response. The SCEF should then send
the HTTP request towards the new target SCS/AS.
### 5.2.11 Support of Load and Overload Control
The Load Control mechanisms defined in clause 6.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [44] may
be supported by T8 APIs with the following differences:
\- The \"Load Control based on load signalled via the NRF\" mechanism defined
in clause 6.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [44] shall not be supported; and
\- The \"Load Control based on LCI Header\" mechanism defined in clause 6.3.3
of 3GPP TS 29.500 [44] may be supported with the following differences:
\- The Load Control \"scope\" and all the related provisions are not
applicable;
\- The \"NF Service Consumer\" corresponds to the sending entity (e.g. SCEF,
SCS/AS, AF) of the message in T8 APIs and the \"NF Service Producer\"
corresponds to the receiving entity (e.g. SCEF, SCS/AS, AF) of the message in
T8 APIs;
\- The provisions related to the SCP (Service Communication Proxy) and SEPP
(Security Edge Protection Proxy) entities are not applicable; and
\- The \"3gpp-Sbi-Lci\" custom HTTP header corresponds to the \"Nbi-Api-Lci\"
custom HTTP header defined in clause 5.2.8.3.4 for T8 APIs.
\- The provisions and mechanisms using the NRF (i.e. 5GC NF Repository
Function) are not applicable.
The Overload Control mechanisms defined in clause 6.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [44]
may be supported by T8 APIs with the following differences:
\- The \"Overload Control based on HTTP status codes\" mechanism defined in
clause 6.4.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [44] may be supported with the following
differences:
\- The \"NF Service Consumer\" corresponds to the sending entity (e.g. SCEF,
SCS/AS, AF) of the message in T8 APIs and the \"NF Service Producer\"
corresponds to the receiving entity (e.g. SCEF, SCS/AS, AF) of the message in
T8 APIs;
and
\- The \"Overload Control based on OCI Header\" mechanism defined in clause
6.4.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [44] may be supported with the following differences:
\- The Overload Control \"scope\" and all the related provisions are not
applicable;
\- The \"NF Service Consumer\" corresponds to the sending entity (e.g. SCEF,
SCS/AS, AF) of the message in T8 APIs and the \"NF Service Producer\"
corresponds to the receiving entity (e.g. SCEF, SCS/AS, AF) of the message in
T8 APIs;
\- The provisions related to the SCP (Service Communication Proxy) and SEPP
(Security Edge Protection Proxy) entities are not applicable; and
\- The \"3gpp-Sbi-Oci\" custom HTTP header corresponds to the \"Nbi-Api-Oci\"
custom HTTP header defined in clause 5.2.8.3.5 for T8 APIs.
\- The provisions and mechanisms using the NRF (i.e. 5GC NF Repository
Function) are not applicable.
Editor\'s Note: How the support of these mechanisms is exchanged between the
concerned entities is FFS.
Editor\'s Note: How reslection is performed is FFS.
### 5.2.12 Query parameters
The query component in a URI contains non-hierarchical data that, along with
data in the path component, enables to filter the resources identified within
the scope of the URI\'s scheme to a subset of the resources matching the query
parameters. The query component is indicated by the first question mark
(\"?\") character and terminated by a number sign (\"#\") character or by the
end of the URI. The syntax of the query component is specified in IETF RFC
3986 [7].
When a server receives a request with a query component, it shall parse the
query string in order to identify the filters. The first question mark is used
to be a separator and is not part of the query string. A query string is
composed of a series of \"key=value\" pairs, separated by \"&\". If one query
parameter contains more than one value, i.e. an array of data elements, then
the values shall be separated by comma (\",\").
The behaviour of the server when receiving an HTTP/2 method with a query
parameter which is of type array, and only some of the members in the array
can be matched, depends on each API and the behaviour shall be clearly
described.
When multiple query parameters are defined for a method on the resource, the
logical \'AND\' is the default logical relationship between the query
parameters for this resource. If a different logical relationship between
multiple query parameters is specified for a method on a resource in an API,
then this logical relationship override the default logical relationship for
this specific method on the concerned resource in that API. If multiple query
parameters are defined for a method on a resource in an API, but there is no
need to specify any logical relationship between these query parameters, the
concerned API shall explicitly state how to handle multiple query parameters.
## 5.3 MonitoringEvent API
### 5.3.1 Overview
The MonitoringEvent API is a RESTful API that allows the SCS/AS to subscribe
to notifications about specific events in 3GPP networks. It also allows the
SCEF to report the event by sending notifications to the authorised users when
the corresponding event is detected. The API also allows the SCEF to indicate
the removal of a previously configured monitoring request. The MonitoringEvent
API defines a set of data models, resources and the related procedures for the
creation and management of monitoring event subscriptions. The corresponding
JSON schema for the representation of the resources and operations defined by
the MonitoringEvent API is provided in its complete form in Annex A.3.
### 5.3.2 Data model

## 5.5 ChargeableParty API
### 5.5.1 Overview
The ChargeableParty API is a RESTful API that allows the SCS/AS to either
request to sponsor the traffic from the beginning or to request becoming the
chargeable party at a later point in time via the T8 interface. The
ChargeableParty API defines a set of data models, resources and the related
procedures for the creation and management of the AS sessions with chargeable
party change. The corresponding JSON schema for the representation of the
resources and operations defined by the Chargeable API is provided in its
complete form in Annex A.5.
### 5.5.2 Data model

## 5.6 NIDD API
### 5.6.1 Overview
The NIDD API is a RESTful API that allows the SCS/AS to send non-IP data to
the UE or receive non-IP data from the UE. The NIDD API defines a set of data
models, resources and the related procedures for the non-IP data transfer. The
corresponding JSON schema for the representation of the resources and
operations defined by the NIDD API is provided in its complete form in Annex
A.6.

## 5.7 DeviceTriggering API
### 5.7.1 Overview
The DeviceTriggering API is a RESTful API that allows the SCS/AS to deliver
specific device trigger to the SCEF; it allows the SCS/AS to replace or recall
the pending device trigger via the SCEF. If the corresponding device trigger
delivery report is received by the SCEF, it also allows the SCEF to indicate
the trigger delivery result to the SCS/AS.
The DeviceTriggering API defines a set of data models, resources and the
related procedure for the creation and management of the device triggering.
The corresponding JSON schema for the representation of the resources and
operations defined by the DeviceTriggering API is provided in its complete
form in Annex A.7.

## 5.13 NpConfiguration API
### 5.13.1 Overview
The NpConfiguration API is a RESTful API that allows the SCS/AS to send
suggested network parameters to influence certain aspects of UE/network
behaviour such as the UE\'s PSM, extended idle mode DRX, and extended
buffering configurations. The NpConfiguration API defines a set of data
models, resources and the related procedures for the creation and management
of the network parameter configuration. The corresponding JSON schema for the
representation of the resources and operations defined by the NpConfiguration
API is provided in its complete form in Annex A.13.
### 5.13.2 Data model

\- at least one of the the security methods for authentication and
authorization, and related security mechanisms.
In a centralized deployment as defined in 3GPP TS 23.222 [47], where the CAPIF
core function and API provider domain functions are co-located, the
interactions between the CAPIF core function and API provider domain functions
may be independent of CAPIF-3/3e, CAPIF-4/4e and CAPIF-5/5e reference points.
When CAPIF is used with the SCEF, the SCEF shall register all the features for
northbound APIs in the CAPIF Core Function.
## 7.2 Security
When CAPIF is used for external exposure, before invoking the API exposed by
the SCEF, the SCS/AS as API invoker shall negotiate the security method (PKI,
TLS-PSK or OAUTH2) with CAPIF core function and ensure the SCEF has enough
credential to authenticate the SCS/AS (see 3GPP TS 29.222 [48], clause 5.6.2.2
and clause 6.2.2.2).
If PKI or TLS-PSK is used as the selected security method between the AF and
the NEF, upon API invocation, the NEF shall retrieve the authorization
information from the CAPIF core function as described in 3GPP TS 29.222 [48],
clause 5.6.2.4.
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.122 [53], the access to the T8 APIs may be
authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [51]), using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the CAPIF core function (see
3GPP TS 29.222 [48]) plays the role of the authorization server.
NOTE 1: In this release, only \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant is
supported.
If OAuth2 is used as the selected security method between the SCS/AS and the
SCEF, the SCS/AS, prior to consuming services offered by the T8 APIs, shall
obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server, by invoking the
Obtain_Authorization service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.222 [48], clause
5.6.2.3.2.
The T8 APIs do not define any scopes for OAuth2 authorization. It is the SCEF
responsibility to check whether the SCS/AS is authorized to use an API based
on the \"token\". Once the SCEF verifies the \"token\", it shall check whether
the NEF identifier in the \"token\" matches its own published identifier, and
whether the API name in the \"token\" matches its own published API name. If
those checks are passed, the AF has full authority to access any resource or
operation for the invoked API.
NOTE 2: The security requirement in the current clause does not apply for the
MsisdnLessMoSms API since it is the SCEF initiated interaction with the
SCS/AS. How the security scheme works for the MsisdnLessMoSms API is left to
configuration.
NOTE 3: For aforementioned security methods, the SCEF needs to apply admission
control according to access control policies after performing the
authorization checks.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI representation for the APIs defined in
the present document
# A.1 General
This Annex is based on the OpenAPI Specification [27] and provides
corresponding representations of all APIs defined in the present
specification.
NOTE 1: An OpenAPIs representation embeds JSON Schema representations of HTTP
message bodies.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE 2: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900
[58] and clause 5.3.1 of the 3GPP TS 29.501 [49] for further information).
# A.2 Data Types applicable to several APIs
For the purpose of referencing entities in the Open API file defined in this
Annex, it shall be assumed that this Open API file is contained in a physical
file named \"TS29122_CommonData.yaml\".
NOTE: For the purpose of referencing the error status codes in the Open API
file defined in this Annex, this Open API file contains all the mandatory
status codes as defined in table 5.2.6-1, all the API specific error status
codes defined for T8 APIs, in addition, some error status codes not used in
the current release of this specification but for the purpose of referencing
by other specifications.
