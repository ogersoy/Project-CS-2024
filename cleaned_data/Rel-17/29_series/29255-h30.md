##### 4.2.1.3.1 Uncrewed Aerial System Service Supplier (USS)
The UAS service supplier (USS) application provides authentication and
authorization for the UAV.
The UAS service supplier (USS) allows NF consumers to exchange communication
messages needed for authentication and authorization procedure. It also
notifies NF consumers about reauthentication, reauthorization or revocation of
the UAV.
##### 4.2.1.3.2 NF Service Consumers
The Uncrewed Aerial System network function (UAS NF):
\- supports authentication and authorization of the UAV with the USS;
\- supports subscription for notification of reauthentication, reauthorization
and revocation of the UAV from the USS.
### 4.2.2 Service Operations
#### 4.2.2.1 Introduction
#### 4.2.2.2 Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize Service operation
##### 4.2.2.2.1 General
The Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize service operation is used by the
NF consumers during following procedure:
\- UUAA-MM and UUAA-SM procedures (see TS 23.256 [14], clause 5.2.2 and clause
5.2.3, respectively)
\- C2 authorization (see TS 23.256 [14], clause 5.2.5.2)
##### 4.2.2.2.2 Authentication and Authorization of the UAV
The Naf_Authentication_AuthenticateAuthorize service operation is invoked by
an NF Service Consumer (e.g. an NEF (UAS-NF)) towards the USS, when UUAA-MM is
done during 5GS registration, UUAA-SM is done during PDU session
establishment, or for authorization for C2 (see TS 23.256 [14]).
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. the NEF (UAS-NF)) shall send the authentication
message to USS by sending the HTTP POST request towards the \"request-auth\"
resource as shown in Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1.
Figure 4.2.2.2.2-1: AuthenticateAuthorize Service Operation
> 1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to the resource with a
> UAVAuthInfo object in the request body. The UAVAuthInfo data type shall
> include:
\- \"gpsi\" attribute that carries the GPSI (in the format of External
Identifier) of the UAV;
\- \"serviceLevelId\" attribute that carries the Service Level Device Identity
of the UAV;
The UAVAuthInfo data type may include
\- \"uavLocInfo\" attribute that provides the UAV location;
\- \"notifyUri\" attribute that provides the notification URI to receive
notifications related to reauthentication, reauthorization or revocation
triggered by the USS, which shall be present in the initial request;
\- \"notifyCorrId\" attribute that represents the notification correlation ID
and this attribute shall be present when the \"notifyUri\" attribute is
provided;
\- \"authMsg\" attribute that contains the authentication message based on the
authentication method used, which is present in the intermediate round-trip
messages and not in initial request. This attribute is deprecated; the
attribute \"authContainer\" should be used instead.
\- \"AuthContainer\" data type that contains the AA related data provided by
the UE (see TS 23.256 [14]). This attribute deprecates \"authMsg\" attribute
and may contain:
\- \"authMsgType\" attribute that indicates the type of the AA message
payload;
\- \"authMsgPayload\" attribute that carries the AA message payload;
NOTE 1: The \"authResult\" attribute will not be present within the
AuthContainer data type, when included within the request sent to USS.
> In case of UUAA-SM procedure, the UAVAuthInfo data type may also include:
>
> \- \"ipAddr\" attribute that carries the IP Address associated with the PDU
> session; and
>
> \- \"pei\" attribute that carries the PEI of the UAV.
2a. If the HTTP request message from the NF service consumer is accepted, the
USS shall respond with \"200 OK\" status code with the message body containing
the UAVAuthResponse data type in the response body, which shall include
\"gpsi\" attribute.
If the USS triggers more intermediate round-trip messages, the UAVAuthResponse
data shall include a \"authMsg\" attribute that contains the authentication
message or authorization data.
Otherwise, the UAVAuthResponse data type shall contain the \"authResult\"
attribute. If the UAV is authenticated successfully, the USS shall set the
\"authResult\" attribute to \"AUTH_SUCCESS\". The \"authMsg\" and
\"authResult\" attributes are deprecated; the \"authContainer\" attribute
should be used instead. The UAVAuthResponse data type shall include the
\"authContainer\" data type that may include:
\- AA message payload type within \"authMsgType\" attribute;
\- AA message payload containing the configuration information within
\"authMsgPayload\" attribute;
\- AA result within \"authResult\" attribute, which is set to either
\"AUTH_SUCCESS\" in case of successful AA procedure or to \"AUTH_FAIL\" in
case of failed AA procedure in the final response of the AA procedure.
NOTE 2: The absence of \"authResult\" attribute within \"AuthContainer\" data
type indicates that the AA procedure is ongoing.
\- The \"serviceLevelId\" attribute containing a new Service Level Device
Identity as the authorized Service Level Device Identity to the UAV.
> The UAVAuthResponse data type may also include:
>
> \- the DN authorization profile index within the \"authProfIndex\"
> attribute;
>
> \- the DN authorized Session-AMBR within the \"authSessAmbr\" attribute.
2b. If the USS cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due
to an internal error or an error in the HTTP POST request, the USS shall send
the HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.1.7.
If the UAV authentication is failed, the USS shall reject the request with an
HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message including the \"cause\" attribute of
the ProblemDetailsAuthenticateAuthorize data structure set to \"FAILED_AUTH\".
The USS shall also include an indication of \"uasResRelInd\" attribute in the
ProblemDetailsAuthenticateAuthorize data type to indicate if an UAS service
related network resource can be released or not, during re-authentication
failure, when the service operation is used during Re-authentication
procedure.
> If the USS determines the received HTTP POST request needs to be redirected,
> the USS shall send an HTTP redirect response as specified in clause 5.2.10
> of TS 29.122 [16].
#### 4.2.2.3 Naf_Authentication_Notification Service operation
##### 4.2.2.3.1 General
The Naf_Authentication_Notification service operation is used by the NF
consumers during the following procedure:
\- USS Initiated Re-authentication and Re-authorization (see TS 23.256 [14],
clause 5.2.4)
\- USS Initiated Revocation (see TS 23.256 [14], clause 5.2.7)
##### 4.2.2.3.2 Notification for Reauthentication, Reauthorization or
Revocation
The Naf_Authentication_Notification service operation is invoked by the USS to
inform a NF Service Consumer (e.g. NEF (UAS-NF)), when USS triggers
reauthentication, update authorization data or revoke authorization of the
UAV.
The USS shall send the request by sending the HTTP POST method towards the
Notification URI as shown in Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1.
Figure 4.2.2.3.2-1: UAV Notification Service Operation
1\. The USS shall send a POST request towards the Notification URI received in
the Authenticate service operation request (See clause 4.2.2.1). The request
body shall contain a ReauthRevokeNotify object containing the reauthentication
information, update authorization information or revoke authorization
indication. The ReauthRevokeNotify data type shall include:
\- the \"gpsi\" attribute is set to the GPSI (in the format of External
Identifier) of the given UAV required to be reauthenticated, reauthorized or
revoked;
\- the \"serviceLevelId\" attribute is set to the Service Level Device
Identity of the UAV;
\- the \"notifyCorrId\" attribute is set to the same value as the
\"notifyCorrId\" attribute of UAVAuthInfo data type received in the request;
\- the \"notifyType\" attribute is set to REAUTHENTICATE for reauthentication
or set to REAUTHORIZE for authorization data update or set to REVOKE for
revocation of authorization. In addition, if \"notifyType\" attribute is set
to REAUTHORIZE, then attribute \"authMsg\" containing the authorization data
shall be included. \"authMsg\" attribute is deprecated; the \"authContainer\"
attribute should be used instead, which carries the authorization data.
NOTE: The \"authResult\" attribute will not be present within the
AuthContainer data type, when included within the Notification request sent by
the USS.
The ReauthRevokeNotify may also include:
\- the \"ipAddr\" attribute carries the IP Address associated with the PDU
session;
2a. On success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned without response body. If
the \"notifyType\" attribute in the request indicated REVOKE, then UAS service
related network resources are released.
2b. If the NF service consumer cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP
POST request due to an internal error or an error in the HTTP POST request,
the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP error response as specified in
clause 5.1.7.
If the NF service consumer determines the received HTTP POST request needs to
be redirected, the NF service consumer shall send an HTTP redirect response as
specified in clause 5.2.10 of TS 29.122 [16].

### 5.1.7 Error Handling
#### 5.1.7.1 General
Response bodies for error handling, as described in 3GPP TS 29.122 [16], are
applicable to the APIs in the present specification unless specified
otherwise, with the following clarifications:
\- the SCEF is the AF; and
\- the SCS/AS is the NEF invoking an API.
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Naf_Authentication API.
#### 5.1.7.2 Protocol Errors
No specific procedures for the Naf_Authentication service are specified.
#### 5.1.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Naf_Authentication service are listed
in Table 5.1.7.3-1.
**Table 5.1.7.3-1: Application errors**
**Application Error** **HTTP status code** **Description**
* * *
FAILED_AUTH 403 Forbidden The HTTP request is rejected because the UAV
authentication is failed by the USS.
### 5.1.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 5.1.8-1 are defined for the Naf_Authentication
API. They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in
clause 6.6 of TS 29.122 [16].
**Table 5.1.8-1: Supported Features**
**Feature number** **Feature Name** **Description**
* * *
### 5.1.9 Security
TLS shall be used to support the security communication between the NEF and
the AF over N33 interface. The access to the Naf_Authentication API shall be
authorized by means of OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [9]), based on local
configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant. If OAuth2
is used, a client, prior to consuming services offered by the
Naf_Authentication API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization
server.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the
present specification. It consists of OpenAPI specifications in YAML format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
> NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
> applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not
> expressed in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the
> specification also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1 and TR
21.900 [7] clause 5B).
