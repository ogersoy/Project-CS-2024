# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 Overview
## 4.1 Introduction
Within the 5GC, the UPF offers services to the NEF and AF via the Nupf service
based interface (see 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.548
[14]).
Figure 4.1-1 provides the reference model (in service based interface
representation and in reference point representation), with focus on the UPF.

A.2
## 5.2 Nupf_EventExposure Service
### 5.2.1 Service Description
The Nupf_EventExposure service enables the UPF to expose UPF related
information to the service consumers, e.g. local NEF, AF. Via
Nupf_EventExposure service the UPF exposes the UPF related information in the
following manners:
\- Subscribe/Notify:
The NF service consumers create the subscription on the event of interest via
SMF. When required, the SMF instructs the UPF to report QoS Monitoring events
directly to a local NEF or AF via N4 interface as specified in 3GPP TS 29.244
[15]. Upon the event of interest the UPF sends notification directly to the
local NEF or AF via Nupf interface.
The event notification may contain following information:
\- QoS Monitoring report, e.g. end to end delay for a specific QoS flow of a
PDU session.
NOTE: In the current release direct subscription from NF service consumer to
UPF is not supported.
### 5.2.2 Service Operations
#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction
The service operations defined for the Nupf_EventExposure service are as
follows:
\- Subscribe: This is a pseudo operation, the actual subscription to the event
is created via N4 interface.
NOTE 1: In the current release OpenAPI 3.0.0 is adopted, with OpenAPI 3.0.0 it
is not possible to document a stand-alone callback operation, thus the Notify
operation has to be defined in combination with a Subscribe operation.
\- Notify: It allows the UPF to send event notifications directly to NF
service consumers, e.g. local NEF, AF.
NOTE 2: Subscribe service operation is not defined in this release.
#### 5.2.2.2 Subscribe
This is a pseudo operation, the UPF does not actually provide Subscribe
service operation through Nupf_EventExposure service. The subscription on the
UPF is created via N4 interface.
#### 5.2.2.3 Notify
##### 5.2.2.3.1 General
This service operation is used by the UPF to send the following kinds of event
notification:
\- Periodic notification on the downlink packet delay, uplink packet delay,
and/or the round trip packet delay between the UPF (PSA) and UE;
\- Event triggered notification on the downlink packet delay, uplink packet
delay, and/or the round trip packet delay between the UPF (PSA) and UE, i.e.
when the packet delay exceeds a defined threshold;
\- Notification on the downlink packet delay, uplink packet delay, and/or the
round trip packet delay between the UPF (PSA) and UE when the PDU session is
released.
The subscription corresponding to the notification is created by the SMF via
N4 interface, see clause 5.33.5 of 3GPP TS 29.244 [15].
##### 5.2.2.3.2 UPF sends notification on QoS monitoring
Figure 5.2.2.3.2-1: UPF sends notification on QoS monitoring
1\. The UPF shall send a POST request to the eventNotificationUri as provided
by the SMF during the provisioning of Session Reporting Rule (see clause
7.5.2.9 of 3GPP TS 29.244 [15]).
2a. Upon success, the NF Service Consumer responds with \"204 No Content\".
2b. On failure or redirection:
\- If the NF Service Consumer does not consider the \"eventNotificationUri\"
as a valid notification URI, the NF Service Consumer shall return \"404 Not
Found\" status code with the ProblemDetails IE providing details of the error.
\- In the case of redirection, the NF service consumer shall return 3xx status
code, which shall contain a Location header with an URI pointing to the
endpoint of another NF service consumer endpoint.

###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the
present specification. It consists of OpenAPI specifications in YAML format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE 1: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1
and 3GPP TR 21.900 [7] clause 5B).
