# 4 Npcf_PolicyAuthorization Service
## 4.1 Service Description
### 4.1.1 Overview
The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization Service, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and in
3GPP TS 23.503 [4], is provided by the Policy Control Function (PCF).
The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service authorises a NF service consumer request
and creates policies as requested by the authorised NF service consumer for
the PDU session to which the AF session is bound to. This service also allows
the NF service consumer to subscribe/unsubscribe to notifications on events
(e.g. access type change, PLMN change, usage report, access network
information report).
### 4.1.2 Service Architecture
The 5G System Architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The Policy and
Charging control related 5G architecture is also described in 3GPP TS 23.503
[4] and 3GPP TS 29.513 [7].
The only known NF service consumers of the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service
are the Application Function (AF), the Network Exposure Function (NEF), the
Time Sensitive Communication and Time Synchronization Function (TSCTSF) and
the Policy Control Function for the UE (PCF for the UE).
The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service is provided by the PCF and consumed by
the AF, the NEF, the TSCTSF and, when the PCF for the PDU session and the PCF
for the UE are different, the PCF for the UE, as shown in figure 4.1.2-1 for
the SBI representation model and in figure 4.1.2-2 for the reference point
representation model.
Figure 4.1.2-1: Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service Architecture, SBI
representation
Figure 4.1.2-2: Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service Architecture, reference point
representation
NOTE: When the N43 reference point exists, i.e. when the PCF is a NF service
consumer of the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service, the PCF for the UE interacts
with the PCF for the PDU session.
### 4.1.3 Network Functions
#### 4.1.3.1 Policy Control Function (PCF)
The PCF (Policy Control Function) is a functional element that encompasses:
\- policy control decision and flow based charging control functionalities;
\- access and mobility policy decisions for the control of e.g. the UE Service
Area Restrictions and RAT/RFSP control; and
\- UE Policy for the Access network discovery and selection policy and UE
Route Selection Policy (URSP).
The policy control decision and flow based charging control functionalities
enable the PCF to provide network control regarding the service data flow
detection, gating, QoS and flow based charging (except credit management)
towards the SMF/UPF.
The PCF receives session and media related information from the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service consumers and notifies them of subscribed
traffic plane events.
The PCF may receive from the NF service consumers the request to monitor the
requested service and media information and notifies them of the UL/DL/round-
trip delay of the requested flows.
The PCF may receive service routing requirements and the indication of
receiving notifications about user plane path changes from the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service consumers.
The PCF may receive from the NF service consumers the specific required QoS
and a prioritized list of alternative QoS profiles and notifies them about the
QoS target the access network guarantees.
The PCF checks that the service information provided by the NF service
consumer is consistent with the operator defined policy rules before storing
the service information.
The PCF uses the received service information and the subscription information
when it applies as basis for the policy and charging control decisions.
The PCF derives PCC rules and provisions them to the SMF via the
Npcf_SMPolicyControl service and subscribes to traffic plane events via policy
control request triggers as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
In 5GS interworking with external time sensitive networks (e.g.TSN network),
the PCF:
\- notifies the NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) about the TSC user
plane node and DS-TT port information corresponding to a PDU session;
\- enables the NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) configures the TSC
user plane node and ports by forwarding TSC user plane node management
containers and port management containers to the SMF as described in 3GPP TS
29.512 [8];
\- notifies the NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) about updated TSC
user plane node configuration and port configuration by forwarding TSN bridge
management containers and port management containers received from the SMF;
and
\- uses the received QoS and TSC assistance information to derive the policy
information delivered in the PCC rule to the SMF as described in 3GPP TS
29.512 [8].
#### 4.1.3.2 NF Service Consumers
The known NF service consumers are the AF, the NEF, the TSCTSF and the PCF
(for a UE), as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3].
The AF is an element offering control to applications that require the policy
and charging control of traffic plane resources; specific user plane paths for
the requested traffic, the monitoring of the required service QoS, and/or
specific QoS and alternative QoS profiles. The AF uses the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service to provide service information to the PCF.
In 5GS interworking with TSN networks, the TSN AF is an element offering to
TSC control functions an interface to 5GS to forward TSC user plane node and
port management configuration, and to set the QoS policy required to forward
the TSC traffic making use of the 5GS traffic plane resources.
The AFs can be deployed by the same operator offering the access services or
can be provided by external third-party service provider. If the AF is not
allowed by the operator to access directly the PCF, the AF uses the external
exposure framework via NEF to interact with the PCF, as described in clause
5.20 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
The Network Exposure Function (NEF) supports external exposure of capabilities
of network functions.
The AF trusted by the operator or the NEF can use the TSCTSF to interface with
PCF to support time sensitive communication and time synchronization. The
TSCTSF is an element offering, to internal and/or external time sensitive AF
(via NEF), control to handle from/towards the PCF the required TSC user plane
node and port management configuration, and to set in the PCF the QoS policy
required to forward TSC traffic.
The PCF providing session management policy control for a UE (i.e. PCF for a
PDU session) and the PCF providing UE policy control and/or access and
mobility control for this same UE (i.e. PCF for a UE) may be different PCFs.
When access and mobility policies depend on traffic plane events (as e.g.
application detection control), the PCF for a UE may act as an NF service
consumer of the PCF for the PDU session by subscribing to such events.
## 4.2 Service Operations
### 4.2.1 Introduction
Service operations defined for the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization Service are shown
in table 4.2.1-1.
_Table 4.2.1-1: Npcf_PolicyAuthorization Service Operations_
+----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Service Operation | Description | Initiated by | | Name | | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Npcf_PolicyA | Determines and | NF service consumer | | uthorization_Create | installs the policy | | | | according to the | (e.g. AF, NEF) | | | service information | | | | provided by an | | | | authorized NF | | | | service consumer. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Npcf_PolicyA | Determines and | NF service consumer | | uthorization_Update | updates the policy | | | | according to the | (e.g. AF, NEF) | | | modified service | | | | information provided | | | | by an authorized NF | | | | service consumer. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Npcf_PolicyA | Provides means to | NF service consumer | | uthorization_Delete | delete the | | | | application session | (e.g. AF, NEF) | | | context of the NF | | | | service consumer. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Npcf_PolicyA | Notifies NF service | PCF | | uthorization_Notify | consumers of the | | | | subscribed events. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Npcf_PolicyAuth | Allows NF service | NF service consumer | | orization_Subscribe | consumers to | | | | subscribe to the | (e.g. AF, NEF, PCF | | | notifications of | for a UE) | | | events. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+ | Npcf_PolicyAuthor | Allows NF service | NF service consumer | | ization_Unsubscribe | consumers to | | | | unsubscribe from the | (e.g. AF, NEF, PCF | | | notifications of | for a UE) | | | events. | | +----------------------+----------------------+----------------------+
NOTE 1: The NEF and the AF use the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service in the
same way.
NOTE 2: The PCF is the consumer when the PCF for the UE and the PCF for the
PDU session are different in the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify/Subscribe/Unsubscribe operations.
NOTE 3: The NWDAF and the DCCF can be NF service consumers of the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify/Subscribe/Unsubscribe operations to perform
data collection for UEs. However, there is no data collected from the PCF by
the NWDAF or the DCCF defined in this Release of the specification.
### 4.2.2 Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation

#### 4.2.2.2 Initial provisioning of service information
This procedure is used to set up an AF application session context for the
service as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS
23.503 [4].
Figure 4.2.2.2-1 illustrates the initial provisioning of service information.
Figure 4.2.2.2-1: Initial provisioning of service information
When a new AF application session context is being established and media
information for this application session context is available at the NF
service consumer and the related media requires PCC control, the NF service
consumer shall invoke the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation by
sending the HTTP POST request to the resource URI representing the
\"Application Sessions\" collection resource of the PCF, as shown in figure
4.2.2.2-1, step 1.
The NF service consumer shall include in the \"AppSessionContext\" data type
in the payload body of the HTTP POST request a partial representation of the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource by providing the
\"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type. The \"Individual Application Session
Context\" resource and the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource are created as
described below.
The NF service consumer shall provide in the body of the HTTP POST request:
\- for IP type PDU sessions, the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the UE in the
\"ueIpv4\" or \"ueIpv6\" attribute; and
\- for Ethernet type PDU sessions, the MAC address of the UE in the \"ueMac\"
attribute.
For Ethernet type PDU sessions, if the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" or
\"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" feature is supported, the \"ueMac\" attribute
containing the MAC address of the DS-TT port as received from the PCF during
the reporting of TSC user plane node information as defined in clause
4.2.5.16.
NOTE 1: The determination of the DS-TT port MAC address is specified in clause
5.28.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. The DS-TT port MAC address is used as identifier
of the PDU session related to the reported TSC user plane node information.
For IP type PDU sessions, if the \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" feature is
supported, the \"ueIpv4\" or \"ueIpv6\" attribute containing the IPv4 or IPv6
address of the UE as received from the PCF during the reporting of user plane
node information as defined in clause 4.2.5.16.
NOTE 2: The IP address of the PDU session is used as identifier of the PDU
session related to the reported TSC user plane node information.
The NF service consumer shall provide the corresponding service information in
the \"medComponents\" attribute if available. The AF shall indicate to the PCF
as part of the \"medComponents\" attribute whether the service data flow(s)
(IP or Ethernet) should be enabled or disabled with the \"fStatus\" attribute.
If the \"AuthorizationWithRequiredQoS\" feature as defined in clause 5.8 is
supported, the AF may provide within the MediaComponent data structure
required QoS information as specified in clause 4.2.2.32.
The AF may include the AF application identifier in the \"afAppId\" attribute
into the body of the HTTP POST request in order to indicate the particular
service that the AF session belongs to.
The AF application identifier may be provided at both
\"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type level, and \"MediaComponent\" data type
level. When provided at both levels, the AF application identifier provided at
\"MediaComponent\" data type level shall have precedence.
The AF application identifier at the \"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type
level may be used to trigger the PCF to indicate to the SMF/UPF to perform the
application detection based on the operator\'s policy as defined in 3GPP TS
29.512 [8].
If the \"IMS_SBI\" feature is supported, the NF service consumer may include
the AF charging identifier in the \"afChargId\" attribute for charging
correlation purposes.
If the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" or \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" feature
is supported the NF service consumer may provide TSC information as specified
in clauses 4.2.2.24 and 4.2.2.25.
The NF service consumer may also include the \"evSubsc\" attribute of
\"EventsSubscReqData\" data type to request the notification of certain user
plane events. The NF service consumer shall include the events to subscribe to
in the \"events\" attribute, and the notification URI where to address the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation in the \"notifUri\"
attribute. The events subscription is provisioned in the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource.
The AF shall also include the \"notifUri\" attribute in the
\"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type to indicate the URI where the PCF can
request to the AF the deletion of the \"Individual Application Session
Context\" resource.
If the PCF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to
the internal PCF error or due to the error in the HTTP POST request, the PCF
shall send the HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7.
Otherwise, when the PCF receives the HTTP POST request from the NF service
consumer, the PCF shall apply session binding as described in 3GPP TS 29.513
[7]. To allow the PCF to identify the PDU session for which the HTTP POST
request applies, the NF service consumer shall provide in the body of the HTTP
POST request:
\- for IP type PDU session, either the \"ueIpv4\" attribute or \"ueIpv6\"
attribute containing the IPv4 or the IPv6 address applicable to an IP flow or
IP flows towards the UE; and
\- for Ethernet type PDU session, the \"ueMac\" attribute containing the UE
MAC address applicable to an Ethernet flow or Ethernet flows towards the UE.
The NF service consumer may provide DNN in the \"dnn\" attribute, SUPI in the
\"supi\" attribute, GPSI in the \"gpsi\" attribute, the S-NSSAI in the
\"sliceInfo\" attribute if available for session binding. The NF service
consumer may also provide the domain identity in the \"ipDomain\" attribute.
NOTE 3: The \"ipDomain\" attribute is helpful in the following scenario:
Within a network slice, there are several separate IP address domains, with
SMF/UPF(s) that allocate Ipv4 IP addresses out of the same private address
range to UE PDU sessions. The same IP address can thus be allocated to UE PDU
sessions served by SMF/UPF(s) in different address domains. If one PCF
controls several SMF/UPF(s) in different IP address domains, the UE IP address
is thus not sufficient for the session binding. A NF service consumer can
serve UEs in different IP address domains, either by having direct IP
interfaces to those domains, or by having interconnections via NATs in the
user plane between the UPF and the NF service consumer. If a NAT is used, the
NF service consumer obtains the IP address allocated to the UE PDU session via
application level signalling and supplies it for the session binding to the
PCF in the \"ueIpv4\" attribute. The NF service consumer supplies an
\"ipDomain\" attribute denoting the IP address domain behind the NAT in
addition. The NF service consumer can derive the appropriate value from the
source address (allocated by the NAT) of incoming user plane packets. The
value provided in the \"ipDomain\" attribute is operator configurable.
NOTE 4: The \"sliceInfo\" attribute is helpful in the scenario where multiple
network slices are deployed in the same DNN, and the same IPv4 address may be
allocated to UE PDU sessions in different network slices. If one PCF controls
several network slices, the UE IP address is not sufficient for the session
binding. The NF service consumer supplies \"sliceInfo\" attribute denoting the
network slice that allocated the IPv4 address of the UE PDU session. How the
NF service consumer derives S-NSSAI is out of the scope of this specification.
NOTE 5: When the scenario described in NOTE 3 applies and the NF service
consumer is a P-CSCF it is assumed that the P-CSCF has direct IP interfaces to
the different IP address domains and that no NAT is located between the UPF
and P-CSCF. How a non-IMS NF service consumer obtains the UE private IP
address to be provided to the PCF is out of scope of the present release; it
is unspecified how to support applications that use a protocol that does not
retain the original UE\'s private IP address.
If the PCF fails in executing session binding, the PCF shall reject the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation with an HTTP \"500 Internal
Server Error\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"PDU_SESSION_NOT_AVAILABLE\".
If the request contains the \"medComponents\" attribute the PCF shall store
the received service information. The PCF shall process the received service
information according to the operator policy and may decide whether the
request is accepted or not. The PCF may take the priority information within
the \"resPrio\" attribute into account when making this decision.
If the service information provided in the body of the HTTP POST request is
rejected (e.g. the subscribed guaranteed bandwidth for a particular user is
exceeded or the authorized data rate in that slice for a UE is exceeded), the
PCF shall indicate in an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message the cause for
the rejection including the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\".
If the PCF detects that a temporary network failure has occurred (e.g. the SGW
has failed as defined in clause B.3.3.3 or B.3.4.9 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [8]) and
the AF initiates an Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation, the PCF
shall reject the request with an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response including the
\"cause\" attribute set to \"TEMPORARY_NETWORK_FAILURE\".
If the service information provided in the HTTP POST request is rejected due
to a temporary condition in the network (e.g. the NWDAF reported the network
slice selected for the PDU session is congested), the PCF may include in the
\"403 Forbidden\" response the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"REQUESTED_SERVICE_TEMPORARILY_NOT_AUTHORIZED\". The PCF may also provide a
retry interval within the \"Retry-After\" HTTP header field. When the NF
service consumer receives the retry interval within the \"Retry-After\" HTTP
header field, the NF service consumer shall not send the same service
information to the PCF again (for the same application session context) until
the retry interval has elapsed. The \"Retry-After\" HTTP header is described
in 3GPP TS 29.500 [5] clause 5.2.2.2.
NOTE 6: When the PCF supports data rate control per network slice and/or data
rate control per network slice for a UE as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8] and
the authorized data rate for any of those cases in a slice is exceeded due to
the bandwidth demands of the new service information, it is also possible to
accept the request based on operator policies. In this case the derived PCC
rule(s) belonging to the authorized GBR service data flows can include a
different MBR and/or have a different charging than the one applicable if the
data rate is not exceeded as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
The PCF may additionally provide the acceptable bandwidth within the attribute
\"acceptableServInfo\" included in the \"ExtendedProblemDetails\" data
structure returned in the rejection response message.
To allow the PCF and SMF/UPF to perform PCC rule authorization and QoS flow
binding for the described service data flows, the NF service consumer shall
supply:
\- for IP type PDU session, both source and destination IP addresses and port
numbers in the \"fDescs\" attribute within the \"medSubComps\" attribute, if
such information is available; and
\- for Ethernet type PDU session, the Ethernet Packet filters in the
\"ethfDescs\" attribute within the \"medSubComps\" attribute, if such
information is available.
The NF service consumer may specify the ToS traffic class (i.e. ToS (IPv4) or
TC (IPv6) value) within the \"tosTrCl\" attribute for the described service
data flows together with the \"fDescs\" attribute.
NOTE x1: A ToS/TC value can be useful when another packet filter attribute is
needed to differentiate between packet flows. For example, packet flows
encapsulated and encrypted by a tunnelling protocol can be differentiated by
the ToS/TC value of the outer header if appropriately set by the application.
To use ToS/TC for service data flow detection, network configuration needs to
ensure there is no ToS/TC re-marking applied along the path from the
application to the PSA UPF and the specific ToS/TC values are managed properly
to avoid potential collision with other usage (e.g., paging policy
differentiation).
The NF service consumer may include the \"resPrio\" attribute at the
\"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type level to assign a priority to the AF
Session as well as include the \"resPrio\" attribute at the \"MediaComponent\"
data type level to assign a priority to the service data flow. The presence of
the \"resPrio\" attribute in both levels does not constitute a conflict as
they each represent different types of priority. The reservation priority at
the \"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type level provides the relative
priority for an AF session while the reservation priority at the
\"MediaComponent\" data type level provides the relative priority for a
service data flow within a session. If the \"resPrio\" attribute is not
specified, the requested priority is PRIO_1.
The PCF shall check whether the received service information requires PCC
rules to be created and provisioned as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7].
Provisioning of PCC rules to the SMF shall be carried out as specified at 3GPP
TS 29.512 [8].
Based on the received subscription information from the NF service consumer,
the PCF may create a subscription to event notifications for a related PDU
session from the SMF, as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
If the PCF created an \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource, the
PCF shall send to the NF service consumer a \"201 Created\" response to the
HTTP POST request, as shown in figure 4.2.2.2-1, step 2. The PCF shall include
in the \"201 Created\" response:
\- a Location header field; and
\- an \"AppSessionContext\" data type in the payload body.
The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created individual
application session context resource i.e. \"{apiRoot}/npcf-
policyauthorization/v1/app-sessions/{appSessionId}\".
When \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource is created in this procedure, the NF
service consumer shall build the sub-resource URI by adding the path segment
\"/events-subscription\" at the end of the URI path received in the Location
header field.
The \"AppSessionContext\" data type payload body shall contain the
representation of the created \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource and may include the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource.
The PCF shall include in the \"evsNotif\" attribute:
\- if the NF service consumer subscribed to the event \"PLMN_CHG\" in the HTTP
POST request, the \"event\" attribute set to \"PLMN_CHG\" and the \"plmnId\"
attribute including the PLMN Identifier or the SNPN Identifier if the PCF has
previously requested to be updated with this information in the SMF;
NOTE 7: The SNPN Identifier consists of the PLMN Identifier and the NID.
\- if the NF service consumer subscribed to the event \"ACCESS_TYPE_CHANGE\"
in the HTTP POST request, the \"event\" attribute set to
\"ACCESS_TYPE_CHANGE\" and:
> i. the \"accessType\" attribute including the access type, and the
> \"ratType\" attribute including the RAT type when applicable for the
> notified access type; and
>
> ii. if the \"ATSSS\" feature is supported, the \"addAccessInfo\" attribute
> with the additional access type information if available, where the access
> type is encoded in the \"accessType\" attribute, and the RAT type is encoded
> in the \"ratType\" attribute when applicable for the notified access type;
> and
NOTE 8: For a MA PDU session, if the \"ATSSS\" feature is not supported by the
NF service consumer the PCF includes the \"accessType\" attribute and the
\"ratType\" attribute with a currently active combination of access type and
RAT type (if applicable for the notifed access type). When both 3GPP and
non-3GPP accesses are available, the PCF includes the information
corresponding to the 3GPP access.
> iii. the \"anGwAddr\" attribute including access network gateway address
> when available,
if the PCF has previously requested to be updated with this information in the
SMF; and
\- if the \"IMS_SBI\" feature is supported and if the NF service consumer
subscribed to the \"CHARGING_CORRELATION\" event in the HTTP POST request, the
\"event\" attribute set to \"CHARGING_CORRELATION\" and may include the
\"anChargIds\" attribute containing the access network charging identifier(s)
and the \"anChargAddr\" attribute containing the access network charging
address.
The NF service consumer subscription to other specific events using the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request is described in the related clauses.
Notification of events when the applicable information is not available in the
PCF when receiving the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request is described in
clause 4.2.5.
The acknowledgement towards the NF service consumer should take place before
or in parallel with any required PCC rule provisioning towards the SMF.
NOTE 9: The behaviour when the NF service consumer does not receive the HTTP
response message, or when it arrives after the internal timer waiting for it
has expired, or when it arrives with an indication different than a success
indication, are outside the scope of this specification and based on operator
policy.
#### 4.2.2.3 Gate control
This procedure is used by an NF service consumer to instruct the PCF about
when the service data flow(s) are to be enabled or disabled for a PDU session.
The AF shall include in the HTTP POST request message described in subclause
4.2.2.2 the \"fStatus\" attribute for the flows to be enabled or disabled
within the \"medComponents\" or \"medSubComps\" attributes.
If a \"medSubComps\" attribute contains a \"flowUsage\" attribute with the
value \"RTCP\", then the IP Flows described by that media subcomponent shall
be enabled in both directions irrespective of the value of the \"fStatus\"
attribute of the corresponding media component.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate gate status for
the corresponding active PCC rule(s).
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
#### 4.2.2.4 Initial Background Data Transfer policy indication
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to indicate a transfer policy
negotiated for background data transfer using the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl
service as described in 3GPP TS 29.554 [14].
The NF service consumer may include in the HTTP POST request message described
in clause 4.2.2.2 a reference identifier related to a transfer policy
negotiated for background data transfer in the \"bdtRefId\" attribute.
NOTE 1: The PCF will retrieve the corresponding transfer policy from the UDR
based on the reference identifier within the \"bdtRefId\" attribute. In case
only one PCF is deployed in the network, transfer policies can be locally
stored in the PCF and the interaction with the UDR is not required.
If the PCF cannot retrieve the transfer policy, the PCF shall set to
TP_NOT_KNOWN the \"servAuthInfo\" attribute in the HTTP response message to
the NF service consumer to indicate that the transfer policy is unknown.
If the time window of the received transfer policy has expired, the PCF shall
set to TP_EXPIRED the \"servAuthInfo\" attribute in the HTTP response message
to indicate to the NF service consumer that the transfer policy has expired.
Otherwise, if the time window of the received transfer policy has not yet
occurred, the PCF shall set to TP_NOT_YET_OCCURRED the \"servAuthInfo\"
attribute in the HTTP response message to the NF service consumer to indicate
that the time window of the transfer policy has not yet occurred.
NOTE 2: In the case that the PCF cannot retrieve the transfer policy, the
transfer policy time window has not yet occurred or the transfer policy
expired, the PCF makes the decision without considering the transfer policy.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
#### 4.2.2.5 Initial provisioning of sponsored connectivity information
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to indicate sponsored data
connectivity when \"SponsoredConnectivity\" feature is supported.
The NF service consumer shall provide in the \"AppSessionContext\" data type
of the HTTP POST request message described in clause 4.2.2.2 an application
service provider identity and a sponsor identity within the \"aspId\"
attribute and \"sponId\" attribute within the \"ascReqData\" attribute.
Additionally, the NF service consumer may provide an indication to the PCF of
sponsored data connectivity not enabled by including the \"sponStatus\"
attribute set to \"SPONSOR_DISABLED\".
To support the usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity, the NF service
consumer may subscribe with the PCF to the notification of usage threshold
reached. The NF service consumer shall include:
\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with the \"event\" attribute set to \"USAGE_REPORT\"; and
\- the \"usgThres\" attribute of \"UsageThreshold\" data type in the
\"EventsSubscReqData\" data type with:
a) the total volume in the \"totalVolume\" attribute; or
b) the uplink volume only in the \"uplinkVolume\" attribute; or
c) the downlink volume only in the \"downlinkVolume\"; and/or
d) the time in the \"duration\" attribute.
NOTE 1: If the NF service consumer is in the user plane, the AF can handle the
usage monitoring and therefore it is not required to provide a usage threshold
to the PCF as part of the sponsored connectivity functionality.
When the NF service consumer indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity,
and the UE is roaming in a VPLMN, the following procedures apply:
\- If the NF service consumer is located in the HPLMN, for home routed roaming
case and when the operator policies do not allow accessing the sponsored data
connectivity with this roaming case, the H-PCF shall reject the service
request and shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message the
\"cause\" attribute set to \"UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY\".
\- If the NF service consumer is located in the VPLMN, the V-PCF shall reject
the service request and shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response
message the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY\".
When the NF service consumer indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity,
and the UE is non-roaming or roaming with the home routed case and the
operator policies allow accessing the sponsored data connectivity with this
roaming case, the following procedures apply:
\- If the SMF does not support sponsored connectivity and the required
reporting level for that service indicates a sponsored connectivity level
according to 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], then the PCF shall reject the request and
shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message the \"cause\"
attribute set to \"REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\".
\- If the SMF supports sponsored data connectivity feature or the required
reporting level is different from sponsored connectivity level as described in
3GPP TS 29.512 [8], then the PCF, based on operator policies, shall check
whether it is required to validate the sponsored connectivity data. If it is
required, it shall perform the authorizations based on sponsored data
connectivity profiles. If the authorization fails, the PCF shall include in
the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY\".
NOTE 2: The PCF is not required to verify that a trust relationship exists
between the operator and the sponsors.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
#### 4.2.2.6 Subscriptions to Service Data Flow QoS notification control
The subscription to Service Data Flow QoS notification control is used by a NF
service consumer to subscribe to receive a notification when the GBR QoS
targets for one or more service data flows can no longer (or can again) be
guaranteed.
NOTE: It may happen that the GBR QoS targets for one or more PCC rules (i.e.
Service Data Flows) cannot be guaranteed, either permanently or temporarily in
the radio access network.
The NF service consumer shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as
described in clause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request message
an event within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"QOS_NOTIF\".
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
QoS notification control for the corresponding PCC rule(s) as described in in
3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.2.7 Subscription to Service Data Flow Deactivation
This procedure is used by NF service consumer to subscribe to the notification
of deactivation of one or more Service Data Flows within the AF application
session context.
NOTE: It may happen that one or more PCC rules (i.e. Service Data Flows) are
deactivated at the SMF at certain time, either permanently or temporarily, due
to e.g. release of resources or out of credit condition.
The NF service consumer shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as
described in clause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request message
an event within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION\".
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
service data flow deactivation for the corresponding PCC rule(s) as described
in in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.2.8 Initial provisioning of traffic routing information
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to:
\- influence SMF traffic routing decisions to a local access to a Data Network
identified by a DNAI; and/or
\- request subscriptions to notifications about UP path management events
related to the PDU session,
when \"InfluenceOnTrafficRouting\" feature is supported.
NOTE 1: The NF service consumer uses the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service for
requests targeting specific on-going PDU sessions of individual UE(s). The NF
service consumer requests that target existing or future PDU Sessions of
multiple UE(s) or any UE are sent via the NEF and may target multiple PCF(s),
as described in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7].
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP POST request message
described in clause 4.2.2.2 the \"afRoutReq\" attribute of
\"AfRoutingRequirement\" data type with specific routing requirements for the
application traffic flows either within \"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type
for the service indicated in the \"afAppId\" attribute, or within the
\"medComponents\" attribute. When provided at both levels, the \"afRoutReq\"
attribute value in the \"medComponents\" attribute shall have precedence over
the \"afRoutReq\" attribute included in the \"AppSessionContextReqData\" data
type.
The NF service consumer may include traffic routing requirements together with
service information.
The NF service consumer may request to influence SMF traffic routing decisions
to a DNAI. The NF service consumer shall include in the \"afRoutReq\"
attribute:
a) A list of routes to locations of applications in the \"routeToLocs\"
attribute. Each element of the list shall contain:
\- a DNAI in the \"dnai\" attribute to indicate the location of the
application towards which the traffic routing is applied; and
\- a routing profile identifier in the \"routeProfId\" attribute, and/or the
explicit routing information in the \"routeInfo\" attribute.
The NF service consumer may include in the \"afRoutReq\" attribute:
a) Indication of application relocation possibility in the \"appReloc\"
attribute.
b) Temporal validity during which the NF service consumer request is valid
shall be indicated with the \"startTime\" and \"stopTime\" attributes.
c) Spatial validity during which the NF service consumer request is valid
shall be indicated in terms of validity areas encoded in the \"spVal\"
attribute of \"SpatialValidity\" data type. The \"SpatialValidity\" data type
consists of a list of presence areas included in the \"presenceInfoList\"
attribute, where each element shall include the presence reporting area
identifier in the \"praId\" attribute and may include the elements composing a
presence area encoded in the attributes: \"trackingAreaList\", \"ecgList\",
\"ncgList\", \"globalRanNodeIdList\".
d) Indication of UE IP address preservation in the \"addrPreserInd\" attribute
if the URLLC feature is supported.
e) If the SimultConnectivity feature is supported:
\- indication of simultaneous connectivity temporarily maintained in the
source and target PSA during the edge re-location procedure in the
\"simConnInd\" attribute; and
\- if the \"simConnInd\" attribute is set to true, the minimum time interval
to be considered for inactivity of the traffic routed via the source PSA in
the \"simConnTerm\" attribute.
f) EAS IP replacement information in the \"easIpReplaceInfos\" attribute if
the EASIPreplacement feature is supported.
g) Indication of EAS rediscovery in the \"easRedisInd\" attribute if the
EASDiscovery feature is supported.
h) Maximum allowed user plane latency in the \"maxAllowedUpLat\" attribute if
the AF_latency feature is supported.
NOTE 2: The EAS IP Replacement information and the information indicating the
EAS rediscovery are not provided simultaneously.
The NF service consumer may also subscribe to notifications about UP path
management events. The NF service consumer shall include in the
\"upPathChgSub\" attribute:
\- notifications of early and/or late DNAI change, using the attribute
\"dnaiChgType\" indicating whether the subscription is for \"EARLY\", \"LATE\"
or \"EARLY_LATE\";
\- the notification URI where the NF service consumer is receiving the
Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation in the \"notificationUri\"
attribute; and
\- the notification correlation identifier assigned by the NF service consumer
in the \"notifCorreId\" attribute.
If the URLLC feature is supported, the NF service consumer may include an
indication of NF service consumer acknowledgement to be expected as an
\"afAckInd\" attribute within the \"upPathChgSub\" attribute.
When the feature \"RoutingReqOutcome\" is supported:
\- the PCF may set the \"servAuthInfo\" attribute in the HTTP response message
to \"ROUT_REQ_NOT_AUTHORIZED\" when the PCF determines, e.g. based on
subscription, the AF influence on traffic routing is not allowed for the PDU
session;
\- when the NF service consumer requests the steering of traffic to a DNAI
and/or the subscription to notifications about UP path management events, the
NF service consumer may subscribe to notifications of failures in the
enforcement of UP path changes including within the \"evSubsc\" attribute the
\"event\" attribute value \"UP_PATH_CHG_FAILURE\" in an entry of the
\"events\" array.
NOTE 3: In the case that the PCF determines that the requested AF routing
requirements cannot be applied and returns the \"servAuthInfo\" attribute in
the HTTP response, the PCF makes the decision without considering the
requested AF routing requirements.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
The PCF shall store the routing requirements included in the \"afRoutReq\"
attribute.
The PCF shall check whether the received routing requirements requires PCC
rules to be created or provisioned to include or modify traffic steering
policies, the AF transaction identifier and the application relocation
possibility as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7]. Provisioning of PCC rules to
the SMF shall be carried out as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
NOTE 4: The NF service consumer receives the notification about UP path
management events by the Nsmf_EventExposure_Notify service operation as
defined in clause 4.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.508 [13].
#### 4.2.2.9 Void
#### 4.2.2.10 Subscription to resources allocation outcome
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to subscribe to notifications
when the resources associated to the corresponding service information have
been allocated and/or cannot be allocated.
The NF service consumer shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as
described in clause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request
message:
\- if the NF service consumer requests the PCF to provide a notification when
the resources associated to the service information have been allocated, an
event entry within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set
to \"SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION\"; and/or
\- if the NF service consumer requests the PCF to provide a notification when
the resources associated to the service information cannot be allocated, an
event entry within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set
to \"FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION\".
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
As a result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
notification of resources allocation outcome for the corresponding PCC Rule(s)
as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.2.11 Void
#### 4.2.2.12 Invocation of Multimedia Priority Services
##### 4.2.2.12.1 General
This procedure allows a NF service consumer, as per 3GPP TS 22.153 [23], to
request prioritized access to system resources in situations such as during
congestion.
The NF service consumer may include the \"mpsId\" attribute to indicate that
the new AF session relates to an MPS session.
The \"mpsId\" attribute shall contain the national variant for the MPS service
name indicating an MPS session. The \"resPrio\" attribute shall include the
priority value of the related priority service.
If the NF service consumer supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an
MPS session, it shall include the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom HTTP
header towards the PCF as described in clause 6.8.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
NOTE 1: If the NF service consumer supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism
for an MPS session, the NF service consumer will include the \"3gpp-Sbi-
Message-Priority\" custom HTTP header with a priority value equivalent to the
value of the \"resPrio\" attribute. Highest user priority value is mapped in
the corresponding lowest value of the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom
HTTP header.
When the PCF receives the \"mpsId\" attribute indicating an MPS session, the
PCF shall take specific actions on the corresponding PDU session to ensure
that the MPS session is prioritized as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
NOTE 2: When the PCF supports data rate control per network slice and/or data
rate control per network slice for a UE as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], it
is possible that, subject to operator policy and national/regional
regulations, prioritised services are exempted from the limitation of data
rate per network slice. In that case the PCF will handle the request from the
NF service consumer even if the authorized data rate per network slice is
exceeded.
##### 4.2.2.12.2 MPS for DTS
MPS for DTS is the means for an NF service consumer to invoke/revoke the
Priority PDU connectivity service for the default QoS flow only, i.e. without
designating a particular service data flow for priority service. MPS for DTS
applies only to non-IMS DNNs.
When the \"MPSforDTS\" feature is supported, to invoke MPS for DTS, the NF
service consumer includes the \"mpsAction\" attribute, set to
\"ENABLE_MPS_FOR_DTS\" or \"AUTHORIZE_AND_ENABLE_MPS_FOR_DTS\". These
\"mpsAction\" attribute values signal a QoS change to the default QoS flow and
service data flows mapped to the default QoS flow without the creation of a
new QoS flow.
When the \"ENABLE_MPS_FOR_DTS\" value is received, and allowed by local
policy, the PCF does not check the user\'s MPS subscription details. When the
\"AUTHORIZE_AND_ENABLE_MPS_FOR_DTS\" value is received, and allowed by local
policy, the PCF shall check the user\'s MPS subscription to authorize the
request. When the request is to authorize and enable, and the request is not
authorized (e.g. not allowed by MPS subscription), the PCF shall indicate in
an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message the cause for the rejection
including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\".
NOTE: How the NF service consumer checks the MPS for DTS authorization is out
of scope of the present document.
When creating an Individual Application Session Context resource, due to the
invocation or revocation of MPS for DTS, the NF service consumer may subscribe
to the outcome of the default QoS updates by setting within the \"evSubsc\"
attribute an event in the \"events\" array with:
\- the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"SUCCESSFUL_QOS_UPDATE\" to
report that the invocation/revocation requested by the NF service consumer was
successful; and/or
\- the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"FAILED_QOS_UPDATE\" to report
that the invocation/revocation requested by the NF service consumer has failed
to be successful.
The NF service consumer may use the procedure specified in clause 4.2.2.12.3
to open a new priority PDU session related to the AF signalling IP flow
between the UE and NF service consumer.
##### 4.2.2.12.3 Provisioning of MPS for DTS signalling flow information
This clause is applicable to provisioning of signalling flow information for
MPS for DTS if the MPSforDTS feature is supported as described in clause 5.8.
This procedure allows NF service consumer to provision information about the
AF signalling IP flows between the UE and the NF service consumer.
The NF service consumer shall provide:
\- the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the UE in the \"ueIpv4\" or \"ueIpv6\"
attribute;
\- the \"mpsId\" attribute; and
\- a media component within the \"medComponents\" attribute including:
\- the \"medCompN\" attribute set to \"0\"; and
\- the media subcomponent within the \"medSubComps\" attribute representing
the AF signalling IP flow, where the media subcomponent shall contain:
\- the \"flowUsage\" attribute set to the value \"AF_SIGNALLING\";
\- the \"fDesc\" attribute containing the IP flows of the AF signalling flow;
and
\- the \"fStatus\" set to the value \"ENABLED\".
The PCF shall determine whether the request is accepted or not. If accepted,
the PCF shall perform session binding and shall reply to the NF service
consumer as described in clause 4.2.2.2. If rejected, the PCF shall indicate
in an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message the cause for the rejection
including the \"cause\" attribute set to \"REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\".
The PCF shall set appropriate QoS values for the AF signalling IP flow and
shall install the corresponding dynamic PCC rule for the AF signalling IP
flows.
The NF service consumer may de-provision the information about the AF
signalling IP flows at any time. To do that, if the \"Individual Application
Session Context\" resource is only used to provide information about the AF
Signalling IP flows, the NF service consumer shall remove the resource by
sending an Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation towards the PCF
as defined in clause 4.2.4.2. Otherwise, the NF service consumer shall remove
the IP flow within the media component invoking the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation as defined in clause
4.2.3.17.
NOTE: Combining the request for the AF signalling flow with an MPS for DTS
invocation/revocation request is not supported in this release.
#### 4.2.2.13 Support of content versioning
The support of the media component versioning is optional. When the
\"MediaComponentVersioning\" feature is supported, the NF service consumer and
the PCF shall comply with the procedures specified in this clause.
If required by operator policies, the NF service consumer shall assign a
content version to the media component related to certain service and shall
provide assigned content version to the PCF in the \"contVer\" attribute
included in the corresponding media component entry of the \"medComponents\"
attribute.
If the PCF receives the \"contVer\" attribute for a certain media component,
the PCF shall follow the procedures described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], clause
4.2.6.2.14.
#### 4.2.2.14 Request of access network information
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to request the PCF to report
the access network information (i.e. user location and/or user timezone
information) at the creation of the \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource, when the \"NetLoc\" feature is supported.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP POST request message
described in clause 4.2.2.2:
\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
a) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
b) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\"; and
\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).
When the PCF determines that the access network does not support the access
network information reporting because the SMF does not support the NetLoc
feature, the PCF shall respond to the NF service consumer including in the
\"EventsNotification\" data type the \"noNetLocSupp\" attribute set to
\"ANR_NOT_SUPPORTED\" value. Otherwise, the PCF shall immediately configure
the SMF to provide such access information, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512
[8].
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer with an HTTP response message
as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
#### 4.2.2.15 Initial provisioning of service information status
When the \"IMS_SBI\" feature is supported, the NF service consumer may provide
the status of the service information.
If the NF service consumer provides service information that has been fully
negotiated (e.g. based on the SDP answer), the NF service consumer may include
the \"servInfStatus\" attribute set to \"FINAL\". In this case the PCF shall
authorize the session and provision the corresponding PCC rules to the SMF.
The NF service consumer may additionally provide preliminary service
information not fully negotiated yet (e.g. based on the SDP offer) at an
earlier stage. To do so, the NF service consumer shall include the
\"servInfStatus\" attribute set to \"PRELIMINARY\". Upon receipt of such
preliminary service information, the PCF shall perform an early authorization
check of the service information. If the NF service consumer requests the PCF
to report the access network information together with preliminary service
information, the PCF shall immediately configure the SMF to provide the access
network information.
#### 4.2.2.16 Provisioning of signalling flow information
This clause is applicable when IMS restoration is supported according to the
supported feature \"ProvAFsignalFlow\" as described in clause 5.8.
This procedure allows NF service consumer to provision information about the
AF signalling IP flows between the UE and the NF service consumer.
The NF service consumer shall provide:
\- the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the UE in the \"ueIPv4\" or \"ueIPv6\"
attribute; and
\- a media component within the \"medComponents\" attribute including:
\- the \"medCompN\" attribute set to \"0\"; and
\- one or more media subcomponents within the \"medSubComps\" attribute
representing the AF signalling IP flows, where each media subcomponent shall
contain:
\- the \"flowUsage\" attribute set to the value \"AF_SIGNALLING\";
\- the \"fNum\" attribute set according to the rules described in Annex C;
\- the \"fDesc\" attribute containing the IP flows of the AF signalling flow;
\- the \"fStatus\" set to the value \"ENABLED\"; and
\- the \"afSigProtocol\" set to the value corresponding to the signalling
protocol used between the UE and the NF service consumer.
The PCF shall perform session binding and shall reply to the NF service
consumer as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
PCC rules related to the AF signalling IP flows could have been provisioned to
SMF using the corresponding procedures specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8] at an
earlier stage (e.g. typically at the establishment of the QoS flow for AF
Signalling IP Flows). The PCF shall install the corresponding dynamic PCC rule
for the AF signalling IP flows.
The NF service consumer may de-provision the information about the AF
signalling IP flows at any time. To do that, if the \"Individual Application
Session Context\" resource is only used to provide information about the AF
Signalling IP flows, the NF service consumer shall remove the resource by
sending an Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation as service
operation towards the PCF as defined in clause 4.2.4.2. Otherwise, the NF
service consumer shall remove the IP flows within the media component invoking
the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation as defined in clause
4.2.3.17.
#### 4.2.2.17 Support of resource sharing
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to indicate that a media
component of an Individual Application Session Context resource may share
resources with other media components in the related direction in other
Individual Application Session Context resources when the \"ResourceSharing\"
feature is supported.
The NF service consumer may include the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or
\"sharingKeyDl\" attribute within a media component of the \"medComponents\"
attribute to indicate that the related media of the created new Individual
Application Session Context resource may share resources with other media
components in the related direction that include the same value for the
\"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer with an HTTP response message
as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
If the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute are
provided within a media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute, the PCF
may apply the mechanisms for resource sharing as described in 3GPP TS 29.512
[8], clause 4.2.6.2.8.
#### 4.2.2.18 Indication of Emergency traffic
When the \"IMS_SBI\" feature is supported, this procedure allows a NF service
consumer to indicate that the new AF session context relates to emergency
traffic.
The NF service consumer may include the \"servUrn\" attribute to indicate that
the new AF session context relates to emergency traffic. Additionally, the NF
service consumer may include the \"afReqData\" attribute to indicate the
additional information requested for the AF session context.
When the PCF receives the \"servUrn\" attribute indicating an emergency
session, the PCF may apply special policies, for instance prioritising service
flows relating to the new AF session context, allowing these service flows
free of charge or exempting the service flows from the limitation of data rate
per network slice when the PCF supports data rate control per network slice
and/or data rate control per network slice for a UE as specified in 3GPP TS
29.512 [8]).
If the \"servUrn\" attribute indicates that the new NF service consumer
session context relates to emergency traffic and the \"afReqData\" attribute
is received, the PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in
clause 4.2.2.2 and shall provide the requested available user information in
the \"ueIds\" attribute included within the \"ascRespData\" attribute in the
HTTP \"201 Created\" response.
NOTE 1: The \"supi\" attribute within the \"ueIds\" attribute contains an
IMSI, if available, when the UE accesses a PLMN and contains either an IMSI or
a network-specific identifier that takes the form of an NAI, if available,
when the UE accesses a SNPN. For both, PLMN access and SNPN access, the
\"gpsi\" attribute within the \"ueIds\" attribute contains an MSISDN, if
available, and the \"pei\" attribute contains an IMEI(SV).
If the NF service consumer supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an
emergency session, it shall include the \"3gppâ€‘Sbiâ€‘Messageâ€‘Priority\" custom
HTTP header towards the PCF as described in clause 6.8.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500
[5].
NOTE 2: If the NF service consumer supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism
for an emergency session, the NF service consumer includes the \"3gpp-Sbi-
Message-Priority\" custom HTTP header based on NF service consumer policies in
relation to valid values of the \"servUrn\" attribute. The highest user
priority value is mapped to the corresponding lowest value of the \"3gpp-Sbi-
Message-Priority\" custom HTTP header.
When the new AF session context does not indicate emergency traffic and the
session binding function detects that the binding is to a PDU session
established to the Emergency DNN, the PCF shall reject the HTTP POST request
and shall indicate in an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message the cause for
the rejection including the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"UNAUTHORIZED_NON_EMERGENCY_SESSION\".
#### 4.2.2.19 Invocation of MCPTT
When the feature \"MCPTT\" is supported by the NF service consumer and the
PCF, this procedure allows a NF service consumer to request prioritized access
to system resources in situations such as an MCPTT session with priority call.
The NF service consumer may include the \"mcpttId\" attribute to indicate that
the new \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource relates to an
MCPTT session with priority call.
When the PCF receives the \"mcpttId\" attribute indicating an MCPTT session
and the \"resPrio\" attribute, the PCF shall take specific actions on the
corresponding PDU session to ensure that the MCPTT session is prioritized as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
NOTE: When the PCF supports data rate control per network slice and/or data
rate control per network slice for a UE as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], it
is possible that, subject to operator policy and national/regional
regulations, prioritised services are exempted from the limitation of data
rate per network slice. In that case the PCF will handle the request from the
NF service consumer even if the authorized data rate per network slice is
exceeded.
Additionally, when the \"PrioritySharing\" feature is supported, the PCF may
receive the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute within the media component received
in the \"medComponents\" attribute as described in clause 4.2.2.21. In this
case, and if \"MCPTT-Preemption\" feature is supported, the PCF may receive
pre-emption information as also described in clause 4.2.2.21.
For the handling of MCPTT session with priority call, see Annex B.13
#### 4.2.2.20 Invocation of MCVideo
When the feature \"MCVideo\" is supported by the NF service consumer and the
PCF, this procedure allows a NF service consumer to request prioritized access
to system resources in situations such as an MCVideo session with priority
call.
The NF service consumer may include the \"mcVideoId\" attribute to indicate
that the new \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource relates to an
MCVideo session with priority call.
When the PCF receives the \"mcVideoId\" attribute indicating an MCVideo
session and the \"resPrio\" attribute, the PCF shall take specific actions on
the corresponding PDU session to ensure that the MCVideo session is
prioritized as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
NOTE: When the PCF supports data rate control per network slice and/or data
rate control per network slice for a UE as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], it
is possible that, subject to operator policy and national/regional
regulations, prioritised services are exempted from the limitation of data
rate per network slice. In that case the PCF will handle the request from the
NF service consumer even if the authorized data rate per network slice is
exceeded.
For the handling of MCVideo session with priority call, see Annex B.15.
#### 4.2.2.21 Priority sharing indication
When the \"PrioritySharing\" feature is supported, the NF service consumer may
indicate to the PCF that the related media flow is allowed to use the same
Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) as media flows belonging to other
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resources.
The NF service consumer may include the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute set to
\"ENABLED\" within a media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute to
indicate to the PCF that the related media flow is allowed to use the same
Allocation and Retention Priority as media flows which:
\- are assigned the same 5QI in the PCF; and
\- belong to other \"Individual Application Session Context\" resources bound
to the same PDU session that also contain the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute set
to \"ENABLED\".
If the \"MCPTT-Preemption\" feature is supported, the NF service consumer may
also include:
\- within a media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute, the
\"preemptCap\" attribute containing the suggested pre-emption capability value
and the \"preemptVuln\" attribute containing the suggested pre-emption
vulnerability value, for the PCF to determine ARP values;
\- within the \"ascReqData\" attribute in the request body, the
\"preemptControlInfo\" attribute containing the pre-emption control
information for the PCF to perform pre-emption control as described in 3GPP TS
29.512 [8], clause 4.2.6.2.9; and
\- within the \"evSubsc\" attribute, the \"event\" attribute set to
\"FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION\" to request the notification for resource
allocation failure.
Upon reception of this information, the PCF shall behave as described in 3GPP
TS 29.512 [8], clause 4.2.6.2.9. For the handling of MCPTT sessions, see Annex
B.10.
NOTE 1: Service data flow deactivation procedures will apply according to
clauses 4.2.2.7, 4.2.3.7, 4.2.5.5.
NOTE 2: This enhancement avoids the risk that a QoS flow establishment request
is rejected if the maximum number of active QoS flows is exceeded.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer with an HTTP response message
as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
#### 4.2.2.22 Subscription to Out of Credit notification
This procedure is used by the NF service consumer if the \"IMS_SBI\" feature
is supported to subscribe to notifications of credit not available for the
Service Data Flows within the AF application session context.
NOTE: It can happen that there are one or more PCC rules (i.e. Service Data
Flows) with credit not available, each one with their corresponding
termination action (terminate, redirect, access restricted).
The NF service consumer shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as
described in clause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request message
an event within the \"evSubsc\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set to
the value \"OUT_OF_CREDIT\".
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
out of credit notification for the corresponding PCC rule(s) as described in
3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer with an HTTP response message
as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
#### 4.2.2.23 Subscriptions to Service Data Flow QoS Monitoring Information
The subscription to Service Data Flow QoS monitoring information is used by a
NF service consumer to receive a notification about the packet delay between
UPF and UE, when the \"QoSMonitoring\" feature is supported.
The NF service consumer shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as
described in clause 4.2.2.2 and shall include:
\- the requested QoS monitoring parameter(s) to be measured (i.e. DL, UL
and/or round trip packet delay) within the \"reqQosMonParams\" attribute;
\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type per requested
notification method in the \"events\" attribute with:
a) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"QOS_MONITORING\"; and
b) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"EVENT_DETECTION\" or
\"PERIODIC\"; and
c) when the \"notifMethod\" attribute is set to the value \"PERIODIC\", the
periodic time for reporting and, if the feature \"PacketDelayFailureReport\"
is supported, the maximum period with no QoS measurement results reported
within the \"repPeriod\" attribute; and
d) when the \"notifMethod\" attribute is set to the value \"EVENT_DETECTION\",
the minimum waiting time between subsequent reports within the \"waitTime\"
attribute and, if the feature \"PacketDelayFailureReport\" is supported, the
maximum period with no QoS measurement results reported within the
\"repPeriod\" attribute;
\- when the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"EVENT_DETECTION\",
the \"qosMon\" attribute, with the required Qos Monitoring information, i.e.:
a) the delay threshold for downlink with the \"repThreshDl\" attribute;
b) the delay threshold for uplink with the \"repThreshUl\" attribute; and/or
c) the delay threshold for round trip with the \"repThreshRp\" attribute.
The NF service consumer may include in \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type the
notification correlation identifier assigned by the AF within the
\"notifCorreId\" attribute and, if the feature \"ExposureToEAS\" is supported,
the \"directNotifInd\" attribute set to true to indicate direct event
notification of QoS Monitoring data from the UPF.
The NF service consumer shall include more than one \"AfEventSubscription\"
data type within the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type if more than one
notification method is required.
The PCF shall reply to the AF as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
QoS Monitoring information for the corresponding PCC rule(s) as described in
3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.2.24 Provisioning of TSCAI input Information and QoS related data
If the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" or \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" feature
is supported the NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) may provide TSCAI
input information within the TSC assistance container and QoS related data to
the PCF by the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation to describe
the TSC traffic pattern and QoS characteristics for use in the 5G System.
The NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) shall derive the TSCAI input
information and the QoS related data for a given TSC stream or flow of
aggregated TSC streams. The TSCTSF may determine the TSCAI input information
and the related QoS data based on information provided by an AF/NEF, and may
provide it for IP type and Ethernet type of PDU sessions as specified in
clauses 4.15.6.6 and 4.15.6.6a of TS 23.502 [3]. In case of integration with
IEEE TSN network, the TSN AF determines the TSCAI input information as defined
in clause 5.27.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2] and the QoS related data as defined
in clause 5.28.4 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
To indicate the TSCAI input information of a TSC stream or aggregated set of
TSC streams, the NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) may include for
the uplink flow direction (ingress interface of the DS-TT/UE) in the
\"tscaiInputUl\" attribute and/or for the downlink flow direction (ingress
interface of the NW-TT) the \"tscaiInputDl\" attribute included in a media
component entry of the \"medComponents\" attribute:
\- the time period between the start of two bursts of a TSC stream or
aggregated TSC streams in reference to the external GM encoded in the
\"periodicity\" attribute;
\- the arrival time of the first data burst of a TSC stream or aggregated TSC
streams in reference to the external GM encoded in the \"burstArrivalTime\"
attribute; and
\- if the \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" feature is supported, the time period
an application can survive without any burst, i.e., the survival time, in
terms of maximum number of messages encoded in the \"surTimeInNumMsg\"
attribute or in time units encoded in the \"surTimeInTime\" attribute.
NOTE: A single burst (message is equivalent to burst) is expected within a
single periodicity. The survival time in terms of maximum number of messages
represents the time period result of multiplying the periodicy by the
indicated number of messages.
The uplink and/or downlink flow of the TSC stream or aggregated set of TSC
streams shall be encoded within the corresponding \"MediaSubComponent\"
entries of the \"medSubComps\" attribute, for PDU sessions of Ethernet type in
the \"ethfDescs\" attribute and for PDU sessions of IP type in the \"fDescs\"
attribute.
When the feature \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" is supported, to indicate the
time domain the NF service consumer is located in (i.e. the (g)PTP domain),
the NF service consumer may include the \"tscaiTimeDom\" attribute in the
corresponding media component entry of the \"medComponents\" attribute.
To indicate the TSC QoS related data of a TSC stream or aggregated set of TSC
streams, the NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) may include in the
\"tsnQos\" attribute included in a media component entry of the
\"medComponents\" attribute;
\- the maximum burst size encoded in the \"maxTscBurstSize\" attribute;
\- the maximum time a packet may be delayed encoded in the \"tscPackDelay\"
attribute;
\- the TSC traffic priority in scheduling resources among other TSC streams
encoded in the \"tscPrioLevel\" attribute.
The NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) may also include the max
bitrates in uplink and downlink within the \"marBwUl\" attribute and the
\"marBwDl\" attribute of the \"medComponents\" attribute respectively. In case
of integration with IEEE TSN network, the TSN AF determines the maximum flow
bit rate as defined in Annex I of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2]. In case of integration
with a TSC network other than IEEE TSN network, the TSCTSF may additionally
include the \"mirBwUl\" attribute and the \"mirBwDl\" attribute of the
\"medComponents\" attribute to indicate the requested guaranteed bit rates in
uplink and downlink respectively.
When the feature \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" is supported, and the feature
\"AuthorizationWithRequiredQoS\" is supported as specified in clause 4.2.2.32,
the NF service consumer (i.e. TSCTSF or TSN AF) may provide within an entry of
the \"medComponents\" attribute a reference to pre-defined QoS information
within the \"qosReference\" attribute instead of providing the attributes
\"tsnQos\", \"marBwUl\", \"marBwDl\", \"mirBwUl\", and/or \"mirBwDl\".
Additionally, if the NF service consumer supports adjustments to different QoS
parameter combinations, the NF service consumer may provide a prioritized list
of one or more QoS references within the \"altSerReqs\" attribute as specified
in clause 4.2.2.32.
When the feature \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" is supported, the feature
\"AltSerReqsWithIndQoS\" is supported as specified in clause 4.2.2.32, and the
NF service consumer (i.e. TSCTSF or TSN AF) provides within an entry of the
\"medComponents\" attribute individual QoS information (e.g. within the
\"tsnQos\", \"marBwUl\" and/or \"marBwDl\" attributes as described in this
clause, then the NF service consumer may provide adjustments to different QoS
parameter combinations within a prioritized list of one or more Requested
Alternative QoS Parameter set(s) within the \"altSerReqsData\"attribute as
specified in clause 4.2.2.32.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) as
described in clause 4.2.2.2.
The PCF shall check whether the received TSCAI input container and TSC QoS
related data require to create PCC rules to provide the SMF with derived QoS
characteristics and the received TSCAI input container. Provisioning of PCC
rule(s) to the SMF shall be carried out as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.2.25 Provisioning of TSC user plane node management information and
port management information
If the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" or \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" feature
is supported, the NF service consumer (i.e., the TSN AF or the TSCTSF) may
provide a UMIC for the TSC user plane node functionality of UPF/NW-TT and
PMIC(s) for the DS-TT port and/or the NW-TT ports to configure the 5G system
as a TSC user plane node bridge by invoking the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation to the PCF.
The NF service consumer may include in the \"AppSessionContextReqData\" data
type:
\- the DS-TT PMIC encoded in the attribute \"tsnPortManContDstt\" and/or the
one or more NW-TT PMIC(s) encoded in the \"tsnPortManContNwtts\" attribute, if
available, for the DS-TT port and NW-TT ports allocated for a PDU session. The
PMIC(s) are encoded in the \"PortManagementContainer\" data type, which
includes the port management information in the \"portManCont\" attribute and
the related port number in the \"portNum\" attribute; and/or
\- the UMIC encoded in the \"tsnBridgeManCont\", if available, for the TSC
user plane node functionality of the UPF/NW-TT allocated for a PDU session.
The UMIC is encoded in the \"BridgeManagementContainer\" data type.
As result of this action, the PCF shall provide the received DS-TT and/or NW-
TT PMIC(s) and/or UMIC for the corresponding PDU session as described in 3GPP
TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.2.26 Invocation of Mission Critical Services
This procedure allows a NF service consumer, as per 3GPP TS 22.179 [45], to
request prioritized access to system resources in situations such as during
congestion.
The NF service consumer may include the \"mcsId\" attribute to indicate that
the new AF session relates to an MCS session.
The \"mcsId\" attribute shall contain the national variant for the MCS service
name indicating an MCS session. The \"resPrio\" attribute shall include the
priority value of the related priority service.
If the NF service consumer supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an
MCS session, it shall include the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom HTTP
header towards the PCF as described in clause 6.8.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
NOTE: If the NF service consumer supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism
for an MCS session, the NF service consumer will include the \"3gpp-Sbi-
Message-Priority\" custom HTTP header with a priority value equivalent to the
value of the \"resPrio\" attribute. Highest user priority value is mapped in
the corresponding lowest value of the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom
HTTP header.
When the PCF receives the \"mcsId\" attribute indicating an MCS session, the
PCF shall take specific actions on the corresponding PDU session to ensure
that the MCS session is prioritised as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.2.27 P-CSCF restoration enhancements
The P-CSCF restoration custom operation is applicable when the PCF based
Restoration Enhancement, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.380 [39], represented by the
supported feature \"PCSCF-Restoration-Enhancement\" is supported by both
P-CSCF and PCF.
Figure 4.2.2.27-1 illustrates the P-CSCF restoration enhancements.
Figure 4.2.2.27-1: P-CSCF restoration enhancements
The P-CSCF acting as a NF service consumer shall invoke the \"P-CSCF
restoration\" custom operation sending an HTTP POST request to the resource
URI representing the custom operation (POST .../pcscf-restoration) as shown in
figure 4.2.2.27-1, step 1, in case P-CSCF restoration needs to be performed.
The P-CSCF shall include in the \"PcscfRestorationRequestData\" data type in
the payload body of the HTTP POST request:
\- the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the UE in the \"ueIpv4\" or \"ueIpv6\"
attribute, and if the IP address is not unique (e.g. private IPv4 case), the
\"ipDomain\" attribute or the \"sliceInfo\" attribute if available; or
\- if the IP address is not available or if the IP address is not unique and
the \"ipDomain\" attribute and the \"sliceInfo\" attribute are not available,
the SUPI in the \"supi\" attribute and the DNN in the \"dnn\" attribute.
The PCF shall identify the PDU session for which the HTTP POST request
applies. If the PCF fails in identifying the PDU session, the PCF shall reject
the \"P-CSCF restoration\" custom operation with an HTTP \"500 Internal Server
Error\" response including the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"PDU_SESSION_NOT_AVAILABLE\".
Otherwise, the PCF shall acknowledge the request and shall send to the NF
service consumer a \"204 No content\" response to the HTTP POST request, as
shown in figure 4.2.2.27-1, step 2.
The PCF shall send a request for P-CSCF restoration to the SMF for the
corresponding PDU session as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], clause 4.2.3.18.
4.2.2.28 Support of CHEM feature
When CHEM feature is supported, the NF service consumer may include the value
of Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL within the \"maxPacketLossRateUl\"
attribute and/or the value of Maximum Packet Loss Rate for DL within the
\"maxPacketLossRateDl\" attribute in \"medComponents\" attribute. For CHEM
feature, see Annex B.14.
#### 4.2.2.29 Support of FLUS feature
When \"FLUS\" feature is supported by the NF service consumer, the NF service
consumer may include the \"flusId\" attribute within a media component of the
\"medComponents\" attribute to indicate that the related media of the created
new Individual Application Session Context resource corresponds to a FLUS
media stream. Additional QoS information for the treatment of FLUS media may
be provided within \"desMaxLatency\" attribute and/or \"desMaxLoss\"
attribute.
#### 4.2.2.30 Subscription to EPS Fallback report
When the \"EPSFallbackReport\" feature is supported, the NF service consumer
subscribes to EPS Fallback report to be notified of the rejection in 5GS of
the requested resources associated to service information for voice media type
and the subsequent fallback to EPS of the resources associated to the voice
media and other medias requested by this NF service consumer.
The NF service consumer shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as
described in clause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request message
an event within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"EPS_FALLBACK\". The NF service consumer shall request to the PCF to report
EPS Fallback in conjuction with providing the PCF with NF service consumer
service information for voice media type as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
EPS Fallback report for the corresponding PCC rule(s) as described in in 3GPP
TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.2.31 Subscription to TSC user plane node related events
This procedure is used by the NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) if
the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" or \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" feature is
supported to subscribe to notifications of updated TSC user plane node
information, e.g., DS-TT PMIC and/or NW-TT PMIC(s) and/or UMIC availability
within the Individual Application Session Context resource created to handle
the TSC user plane node in the context of a PDU session.
The NF service consumer shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as
described in clause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request message
within the \"evSubsc\" attribute an event within \"events\" attribute with the
\"event\" attribute set to the value \"TSN_BRIDGE_INFO\" to subscribe to the
reception of TSC user plane node information.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer with an HTTP response message
as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the corresponding subscription to
TSC user plane node related events for the corresponding PDU session as
described in as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.2.32 Initial provisioning of required QoS information
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to request that a data session
to a UE is set up with a specific QoS (e.g. low latency or jitter) and
priority handling when the \"AuthorizationWithRequiredQoS\" feature is
supported.
The NF service consumer may provide within one or more entries of the
\"medComponents\" attribute included in the \"ascReqData\" attribute of the
HTTP POST request message described in clause 4.2.2.2 a reference to pre-
defined QoS information within the \"qosReference\" attribute.
Additionally, if the NF service consumer supports adjustment to different QoS
parameter combinations, the NF service consumer may provide a prioritized list
of one or more QoS references within the \"altSerReqs\" attribute, where the
lower the index of the array for a given entry, the higher the priority.
If the \"AltSerReqsWithIndQoS\" feature is supported, and the NF service
consumer requests that the data session to a UE is set up with individual QoS
parameters (i.e., with QoS information within \"medComponents\" attribute,
e.g. the \"tsnQos\", \"marBwUl\" and/or \"marBwDl\" attributes, instead of a
QoS reference within the \"qosReference\" attribute), the NF service consumer
may instead of the \"altSerReqs\" attribute provide a prioritized list of
alternative service requirements that include Requested Alternative QoS
Parameter set(s) within the \"altSerReqsData\" attribute, where the lower the
index of the array for a given entry, the higher the priority.
If the \"DisableUENotification\" feature is supported, the AF may also
indicate to the PCF that the UE does not need to be informed about changes
related to Alternative QoS Profiles by including the \"disUeNotif\" attribute
set to true.
When the NF service consumer provides the \"altSerReqs\" attribute or the
\"altSerReqsData\" attribute, the NF service consumer shall also subscribe to
receive notifications from the PCF when the resources associated to the
corresponding service information have been allocated as described in clause
4.2.2.10 and when the GBR QoS targets for one or more service data flows can
no longer (or can again) be guaranteed, as described in clause 4.2.2.6.
Due to the received QoS information, the PCF may need to provision or modify
the related PCC rules as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7] and provide the
related information towards the SMF following the corresponding procedures
specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
#### 4.2.2.33 Support of QoSHint feature
If the QoSHint feature is supported by the NF service consumer, the NF service
consumer may include the \"desMaxLatency\" attribute and/or \"desMaxLoss\"
attribute within a media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute to
indicate that the related media of the created Individual Application Session
Context resource has specific latency and/or loss demands.
#### 4.2.2.34 Subscription to Reallocation of Credit notification
This procedure is used by the NF service consumer if the \"IMS_SBI\" and the
\"ReallocationOfCredit\" features are supported to subscribe to notifications
of reallocation of credit for the Service Data Flows within the AF application
session context.
The NF service consumer shall use the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type as
described in clause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request message
an event within the \"evSubsc\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set to
the value \"REALLOCATION_OF_CREDIT\".
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
reallocation of credit notification for the corresponding PCC rule(s) as
described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer with an HTTP response message
as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
#### 4.2.2.35 Subscription to satellite backhaul category changes
When the feature \"SatelliteBackhaul\" is supported, the subscription to
satellite backhaul category changes is used by a NF service consumer to
subscribe to receive a notification when the satellite backhaul category
changes and when the backhaul category changes between satellite backhaul and
non-satellite backhaul.
The NF service consumer shall use the \"evSubsc\" attribute as described in
clause 4.2.2.2 and shall include in the HTTP POST request message an event
within the \"events\" attribute with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"SAT_CATEGORY_CHG\".
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
The PCF shall include the \"evsNotif\" attribute with an entry in the
\"evNotifs\" array with the \"event\" attribute set to \"SAT_CATEGORY_CHG\"
and the \"satBackhaulCategory\" attribute including the satellite backhaul
category or the indication of non-satellite backhaul if the PCF has previously
requested to the SMF to be updated with this information.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
satellite backhaul changes for the PDU session, if not previously subscribed,
as described in in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
### 4.2.3 Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation
#### 4.2.3.1 General
The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation provides updated
application level information from the NF service consumer and optionally
communicates with the Npcf_SMPolicyControl service to determine and install
the policy according to the information provided by the NF service consumer.
The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation updates an application
session context in the PCF.
The following procedures using the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service
operation are supported:

#### 4.2.3.2 Modification of service information
This procedure is used to modify an existing application session context as
defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], 3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [4] when
the feature \"PatchCorrection\" is supported.
Figure 4.2.3.2-1 illustrates the modification of service information using
HTTP PATCH method.
Figure 4.2.3.2-1: Modification of service information using HTTP PATCH
The NF service consumer may modify the application session context information
at any time (e.g. due to an AF session modification or internal NF service
consumer trigger) and invoke the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service
operation by sending the HTTP PATCH request message to the resource URI
representing the \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource, as shown
in figure 4.2.3.2-1, step 1, with the modifications to apply.
The JSON body within the PATCH request shall include the
\"AppSessionContextUpdateDataPatch\" data type and shall be encoded according
to \"JSON Merge Patch\", as defined in IETF RFC 7396 [21]. The modifications
to apply are encoded within the attributes of the \"ascReqData\" attribute, as
described below and in subsequent clauses.
The NF service consumer may include the updated service information in the
\"medComponents\" attribute of the \"ascReqData\" attribute.
If the \"AuthorizationWithRequiredQoS\" feature as defined in clause 5.8 is
supported, the NF service consumer may provide within the MediaComponentRm
data structure an update of the required QoS information as specified in
clause 4.2.3.30.
The NF service consumer may include in the \"ascReqData\" attribute an AF
application identifier in the \"afAppId\" attribute to trigger the PCF to
indicate to the SMF/UPF to perform the application detection based on the
operator\'s policy as defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
If the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" or \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" feature
is supported, the NF service consumer may provide TSC user plane node related
information as specified in clauses 4.2.3.24 and 4.2.3.25.
The NF service consumer may also create, modify or remove events subscription
information by sending the HTTP PATCH request message to the resource URI
representing the \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource.
The NF service consumer shall create event subscription information by
including in the \"ascReqData\" attribute the \"evSubsc\" attribute of
\"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type with the corresponding list of events to
subscribe to; and the \"notifUri\" attribute with the notification URI where
the PCF shall send the notifications.
The NF service consumer shall update existing event subscription information
by including in the \"ascReqData\" attribute an updated value of the
\"evSubsc\" attribute of the \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type as follows:
\- The \"events\" attribute shall include the new complete list of subscribed
events.
\- When the NF service consumer requests to update the additional information
related to an event (e.g. the NF service consumer needs to provide new
thresholds to the PCF in the \"usgThres\" attribute related to the
\"USAGE_REPORT\" event) the NF service consumer shall include the additional
information, which shall completely replace the previously provided one.
NOTE 1: Note that when the NF service consumer requests to remove an event,
this event is not included in the \"events\" attribute.
NOTE 2: When an event is included in the \"events\" attribute and its related
additional information is set to null, the PCF considers the subscription to
this event is active, but the related procedures stop applying.
NOTE 3: When an event is removed from the \"events\" attribute but its related
information is not set to null, the PCF considers the subscription to this
event is terminated, the related additional information is removed, and the
related procedures stop applying.
The NF service consumer shall remove existing event subscription information
by setting to null the \"evSubsc\" attribute included in the \"ascReqData\"
attribute.
Events with \"notifMethod\" set to \"ONE_TIME\" shall only apply at the time
the NF service consumer requests their subscription. Once the event report is
performed, the subscription to this event is automatically terminated in the
PCF and the related information is removed. The presence of a one-time event,
together with its related additional information when applicable, during an
update procedure shall represent the recreation of the subscription to this
event in the PCF.
NOTE 4: The \"notifUri\" attribute within the EventsSubscReqData data
structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are sent to
a new NF service consumer.
If the PCF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP PATCH request due to
the internal PCF error or due to the error in the HTTP PATCH request, the PCF
shall send the HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the PCF determines the received
HTTP PATCH request needs to be redirected, the PCF shall send an HTTP redirect
response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
Otherwise, the PCF shall process the received service information according
the operator policy and may decide whether the HTTP request message is
accepted or not.
If the updated service information is not acceptable (e.g. the subscribed
guaranteed bandwidth for a particular user is exceeded or the authorized data
rate in that slice for the UE is exceeded), the PCF shall include in an HTTP
\"403 Forbidden\" response message the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\".
If the PCF detects that a temporary network failure has occurred (e.g. the SGW
has failed as defined in clause B.3.3.3 or B.3.4.9 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [8]) and
the AF initiates an Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation, the PCF
shall reject the request with an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response including the
\"cause\" attribute set to \"TEMPORARY_NETWORK_FAILURE\".
If the service information provided in the HTTP PATCH request is rejected due
to a temporary condition in the network (e.g. the NWDAF reported the network
slice selected for the PDU session is congested), the PCF may include in the
\"403 Forbidden\" response the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"REQUESTED_SERVICE_TEMPORARILY_NOT_AUTHORIZED\". The PCF may also provide a
retry interval within the \"Retry-After\" HTTP header field. When the NF
service consumer receives the retry interval within the \"Retry-After\" HTTP
header field, the NF service consumer shall not send the same service
information to the PCF again (for the same application session context) until
the retry interval has elapsed. The \"Retry-After\" HTTP header is described
in 3GPP TS 29.500 [5] clause 5.2.2.2.
NOTE 5: When the PCF supports data rate control per network slice and/or data
rate control per network slice for a UE as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8] and
the authorized data rate in a slice is exceeded due to the bandwidth demands
of the modified service information, it is also possible to accept the request
based on operator policies. In this case the derived PCC rule(s) belonging to
the authorized GBR service data flows can include a different MBR and/or have
a different charging than the one applicable if the data rate is not exceeded
as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
The PCF may additionally provide the acceptable bandwidth within the attribute
\"acceptableServInfo\" included in the \"ExtendedProblemDetails\" data
structure returned in the rejection response message.
If the request is accepted, the PCF shall update the service information with
the new information received. Due to the updated service information, the PCF
may need to create, modify or delete the related PCC rules as specified in
3GPP TS 29.513 [7] and provide the updated information towards the SMF
following the corresponding procedures specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
Based on the received subscription information from the NF service consumer,
the PCF may create a subscription to event notifications or may modify the
existing subscription to event notifications, for a related PDU session from
the SMF, as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
The PCF shall reply with the HTTP response message to the NF service consumer
and may include the \"AppSessionContext\" data type payload body with the
representation of the modified \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource and may include the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource.
The PCF shall include in the \"evsNotif\" attribute:
\- if the NF service consumer subscribed to the \"PLMN_CHG\" event in the HTTP
PATCH request, the \"event\" attribute set to \"PLMN_CHG\" and the \"plmnId\"
attribute including the PLMN Identifier or the SNPN Identifier if the PCF has
previously requested to be updated with this information in the SMF;
NOTE 6: The SNPN Identifier consists of the PLMN Identifier and the NID.
\- if the NF service consumer subscribed to the event \"ACCESS_TYPE_CHANGE\"
event in the HTTP PATCH request, the \"event\" attribute set to
\"ACCESS_TYPE_CHANGE\" and:
> i. the \"accessType\" attribute including the access type, and the
> \"ratType\" attribute including the RAT type when applicable for the
> notified access type; and
>
> ii. if the \"ATSSS\" feature is supported, the \"addAccessInfo\" attribute
> with the additional access type information if available, where the access
> type is encoded in the \"accessType\" attribute, and the RAT type is encoded
> in the \"ratType\" attribute when applicable for the notified access type;
> and
NOTE 7: For a MA PDU session, if the \"ATSSS\" feature is not supported by the
NF service consumer, the PCF includes the \"accessType\" attribute and the
\"ratType\" attribute with a currently active combination of access type and
RAT type (if applicable for the notifed access type). When both 3GPP and
non-3GPP accesses are available, the PCF includes the information
corresponding to the 3GPP access.
> iii. the \"anGwAddr\" attribute including access network gateway address
> when available,
if the PCF has previously requested to be updated with this information in the
SMF; and
\- if the \"IMS_SBI\" feature is supported and if the NF service consumer
subscribed to the \"CHARGING_CORRELATION\" event in the HTTP PATCH request,
the \"event\" attribute set to \"CHARGING_CORRELATION\" and may include the
\"anChargIds\" attribute containing the access network charging identifier(s)
and the \"anChargAddr\" attribute containing the access network charging
address.
The NF service consumer subscription to other specific events using the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request is described in the related clauses.
Notification of events when the applicable information is not available in the
PCF when receiving the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request is described in
clause 4.2.5.
The HTTP response message towards the NF service consumer should take place
before or in parallel with any required PCC rule provisioning towards the SMF.
If the PCF does not have an existing application session context for the
application session context being modified (such as after a PCF failure), the
PCF shall reject the HTTP request message with the HTTP response message with
the applicable rejection cause.
#### 4.2.3.3 Gate control
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to modify in the PCF the
service data flow(s) that are to be enabled or disabled to pass through the
PDU session.
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method to modify the gate
control information.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message
described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, in the media
component(s) included in the \"medComponents\" attribute at media and/or media
subcomponent level, the \"fStatus\" attribute for the flows to be enabled or
disabled with the appropriate value.
If a \"medSubComps\" attribute contains a \"flowUsage\" attribute with the
value \"RTCP\", then the IP Flows described by that media subcomponent shall
be enabled in both directions irrespective of the value of the \"fStatus\"
attribute of the corresponding media component.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate gate status for
the corresponding active PCC rule(s).
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
#### 4.2.3.4 Background Data Transfer policy indication at policy
authorization update
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to indicate at policy
authorization update a transfer policy negotiated for background data transfer
using the Npcf_BDTPolicyControl service as described in 3GPP TS 29.554 [14].
The NF service consumer may include in the HTTP PATCH request message
described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, a new reference
id in the \"bdtRefId\" attribute.
NOTE 1: The PCF will retrieve the corresponding transfer policy from the UDR
based on the reference identifier within the \"bdtRefId\" attribute. In case
only one PCF is deployed in the network, transfer policies can be locally
stored in the PCF and the interaction with the UDR is not required.
If the PCF cannot retrieve the transfer policy, the PCF shall set to
TP_NOT_KNOWN the \"servAuthInfo\" attribute in the HTTP response message to
the NF service consumer to indicate that the transfer policy is unknown.
If the time window of the received transfer policy has expired, the PCF shall
set to TP_EXPIRED the \"servAuthInfo\" attribute in the HTTP response message
to indicate to the NF service consumer that the transfer policy has expired.
Otherwise, if the time window of the received transfer policy has not yet
occurred, the PCF shall set to TP_NOT_YET_OCCURRED the \"servAuthInfo\"
attribute in the HTTP response message to the NF service consumer to indicate
that the time window of the transfer policy has not yet occurred.
NOTE 2: In the case that the PCF cannot retrieve the transfer policy, the
transfer policy time window has not yet occurred or the transfer policy
expired, the PCF makes the decision without considering the transfer policy.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
#### 4.2.3.5 Modification of sponsored connectivity information
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to modify sponsored data
connectivity when \"SponsoredConnectivity\" feature is supported.
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method to modify the
sponsored connectivity information.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message
described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, an application
service provider identity and a sponsor identity within the \"aspId\"
attribute and \"sponId\" attribute, and optionally an indication of whether to
enable or disable sponsored data connectivity within the \"sponStatus\"
attribute set to the applicable value to provide sponsored connectivity
information or to update existing sponsored connectivity information.
If the NF service consumer requests to enable sponsored data connectivity the
NF service consumer shall change the \"sponStatus\" attribute value to
\"SPONSOR_ENABLED\".
If the NF service consumer requests to disable sponsored data connectivity the
NF service consumer shall provide an indication to disable sponsored data
connectivity to the PCF by setting the \"sponStatus\" attribute to
\"SPONSOR_DISABLED\".
To support the usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity, the NF service
consumer may also include in the HTTP PATCH a new or modified \"evSubsc\"
attribute of \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type with:
\- the usage thresholds to apply in the \"usgThres\" attribute; and
\- the subscription to usage monitoring for sponsored data connectivity in an
entry of the \"events\" attribute of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type
with the \"event\" attribute set to \"USAGE_REPORT\".
NOTE 1: If the NF service consumer is in the user plane, the NF service
consumer can handle the usage monitoring and therefore it is not required to
provide a usage threshold to the PCF as part of the sponsored data
connectivity information.
When the NF service consumer indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity,
and the UE is roaming with the visited access case, the following procedures
apply:
\- If the NF service consumer is located in the HPLMN, for home routed roaming
case and when operator policies do not allow accessing the sponsored data
connectivity with this roaming case, the H-PCF shall reject the service
request and shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message the
\"cause\" attribute set to \"UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY\".
\- If the NF service consumer is located in the VPLMN, the V-PCF shall reject
the service request and shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response
message the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY\".
When the NF service consumer indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity,
and the UE is in the non-roaming case or roaming with the home routed case and
the operator policies allow accessing the sponsored data connectivity with
this roaming case, the following procedures apply:
\- If the SMF does not support sponsored connectivity and the required
reporting level for that service indicates a sponsored connectivity level
according to 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], then the PCF shall reject the request and
shall include in the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message the \"cause\"
attribute set to \"REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\".
\- If the SMF supports sponsored data connectivity feature or the required
reporting level is different from sponsored connectivity level as described in
3GPP TS 29.512 [8], then the PCF, based on operator policies, shall check
whether it is required to validate the sponsored connectivity data. If it is
required, it shall perform the authorizations based on sponsored data
connectivity profiles. If the authorization fails, the PCF shall include in
the HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response message the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"UNAUTHORIZED_SPONSORED_DATA_CONNECTIVITY\".
NOTE 2: The PCF is not required to verify that a trust relationship exists
between the operator and the sponsors.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
#### 4.2.3.6 Modification of Subscription to Service Data Flow QoS
notification control
This procedure is used in the NF service consumer to modify in the PCF the
subscription to notification about whether the GBR QoS targets can no longer
(or can again) be guaranteed.
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method to update the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource together with the modifications to the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message
described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the updated
values of the \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type, which either shall include
in the \"events\" attribute a new element with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"QOS_NOTIF\" to indicate the subscription to QoS notification control, or
shall not include in the \"events\" attribute an existing element with the
\"event\" attribute set to \"QOS_NOTIF\" to indicate the termination of the
subscription to QoS notification control.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
QoS notification control for the corresponding active PCC rule(s) as described
in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
#### 4.2.3.7 Modification of Subscription to Service Data Flow Deactivation
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to modify in the PCF the
subscription to the notification of deactivation of one or more Service Data
Flows within the AF application session context.
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method to update the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource together with the modifications to the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message
described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the updated
values of the \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type, which either shall include
in the \"events\" attribute a new element with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION\" to indicate the subscription to service data
flow deactivation, or shall not include in the \"events\" attribute an
existing element with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION\".
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
service data flow deactivation for the corresponding PCC rule(s) as described
in in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.3.8 Update of traffic routing information
This procedure is used by NF service consumer to modify in the PCF the traffic
routing information to a local access to a DNN, and/or to modify the
subscription to notifications about UP path management when
\"InfluenceOnTrafficRouting\" feature is supported.
When the \"SimultConnectivity\" feature is supported, this procedure may be
used to modify (create, delete, update) the indication of simultaneous
connectivity temporarily maintained for the source and target PSA and/or the
indication of the minimum time interval to be considered for inactivity for
the traffic routed via the source PSA.
When the \"URLLC\" feature is supported, this procedure may be used to modify
(create, delete, update) the indication of UE IP address preservation.
When the \"EASIPreplacement\" feature is supported, this procedure may be used
to modify (initially provide, delete, update) the EAS IP replacement
information to the PCF.
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method.
To modify traffic routing information, the NF service consumer shall include
in the HTTP PATCH request message described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the
\"ascReqData\" attribute, an updated \"afRoutReq\" attribute(s) with the
modified traffic routing information. To modify the indication of simultaneous
connectivity and/or the termination of the simultaneous connectivity, the NF
service consumer shall include an updated \"simConnInd\" attribute and/or an
updated \"simConnTem\" attribute, if applicable. To modify the indication of
UE IP address preservation, the NF service consumer shall include the updated
indication of UE IP address preservation in the \"addrPreserInd\" attribute,
if applicable. To modify the EAS IP replacement information, the NF service
consumer shall include the updated/new \"easIpReplaceInfos\" attribute, if
applicable. To modify the maximum allowed user plane latency, the NF service
consumer shall include the updated/new \"maxAllowedUpLat\" attribute, if
applicable.
To modify the subscription to notifications about UP path management events
(create, delete or modify), the NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP
PATCH request message described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\"
attribute, the updated values of the \"upPathChgSub\" attribute with the
modified subscription to UP path management events.
When the feature \"RoutingReqOutcome\" is supported:
\- and the NF service consumer is creating or modifying AF routing
information, the PCF may set the \"servAuthInfo\" attribute in the HTTP
response message to \"ROUT_REQ_NOT_AUTHORIZED\" when the PCF determines, e.g.
based on subscription, the AF influence on traffic routing is not allowed for
the PDU session;
\- when the NF service consumer requests the update of the steering of traffic
to a DNAI and/or the subscription to notifications about UP path management
events, the NF service consumer may subscribe to notifications of failures in
the enforcement of UP path changes including within the \"evSubsc\" attribute
the \"event\" attribute value \"UP_PATH_CHG_FAILURE\" in an entry of the
\"events\" array, or may remove the subscription to notification of failures
in the enforcement of UP path changes by not including the the \"event\"
attribute value \"UP_PATH_CHG_FAILURE\" in an entry of the \"events\" array of
the \"evSubsc\" attribute.
NOTE: In the case that the PCF determines that the requested AF routing
requirements cannot be applied and returns the \"servAuthInfo\" attribute in
the HTTP response, the PCF makes the decision without considering the
requested AF routing requirements.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
The PCF shall store the application routing requirements included in the
\"afRoutReq\" attribute.
The PCF shall check whether the updated application routing requirements
require PCC rules to be created or modified to include updated traffic
steering policies, or the AF transaction identifier, or to update the
application relocation possibility as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7].
Provisioning of PCC rules to the SMF shall be carried out as specified at 3GPP
TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.3.9 Void
#### 4.2.3.10 Modification of subscription to resources allocation outcome
This procedure is used in the NF service consumer to modify in the PCF the
subscription to notification about resources allocation outcome.
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method to update the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource together with the modifications to the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message
described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the updated
values of the \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type, which either include in the
\"events\" attribute a new element with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION\" and/or \"FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION\" or
remove in the \"events\" attribute an existing element with the \"event\"
attribute set to \"SUCCESSFUL_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION\" and/or
\"FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION\".
As a result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
notification of resources allocation outcome in the corresponding PCC Rule(s)
as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.3.11 Void
#### 4.2.3.12 Modification of Multimedia Priority Services
The NF service consumer may include, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the
\"mpsId\" attribute if it was not previously provided in order to indicate
that the modified AF session relates to an MPS session.
If the NF service consumer supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an
MPS session, the NF service consumer shall include the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-
Priority\" custom HTTP header towards the PCF as described in clause
4.2.2.12.1.
If the PCF receives the \"mpsId\" attribute, the PCF shall take specific
actions on the corresponding PDU session to ensure that the MPS session is
prioritized as defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
NOTE: When the PCF supports data rate control per network slice and/or data
rate control per network slice for a UE as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], it
is possible that, subject to operator policy and national/regional
regulations, prioritised services are exempted from the limitation of data
rate per network slice. In that case the PCF will handle the request from the
NF service consumer even if the authorized data rate per network slice is
exceeded.
When the feature \"MPSforDTS\" is supported, the NF service consumer includes
the \"mpsAction\" attribute to invoke or revoke MPS for DTS, as specified in
clause 4.2.2.12.2. When invoking MPS for DTS, the NF service consumer shall
include the \"mpsAction\" attribute set to \"ENABLE_MPS_FOR_DTS\" or
\"AUTHORIZE_AND_ENABLE_MPS_FOR_DTS\". When the \"ENABLE_MPS_FOR_DTS\" value is
received in the \"mpsAction\" attribute, and allowed by local policy, the PCF
does not check the authorization of the request. When the
\"AUTHORIZE_AND_ENABLE_MPS_FOR_DTS\" value is received in the \"mpsAction\"
attribute, and allowed by local policy, the PCF shall check the user\'s MPS
subscription to authorize the request. When the request is to authorize and
enable, and the request is not authorized (e.g. not allowed by MPS
subscription), the PCF shall indicate in an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\" response
message the cause for the rejection including the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\".
To revoke MPS for DTS, the NF service consumer shall include the \"mpsAction\"
attribute set to \"DISABLE_MPS_FOR_DTS\". When the \"DISABLE_MPS_FOR_DTS\"
value is received in the \"mpsAction\" attribute, and allowed by local policy,
the PCF does not check the authorization of the request.
When modifying an Individual Application Session Context resource due to the
invocation or revocation of the MPS for DTS service, the NF service consumer
may subscribe to the outcome of the QoS updates by setting within the
\"evSubsc\" attribute an event within the \"events\" array with:
\- the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"SUCCESSFUL_QOS_UPDATE\" to
report that the invocation/revocation requested by the NF service consumer was
successful; and/or
\- the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"FAILED_QOS_UPDATE\" to report
that the invocation/revocation requested by the NF service consumer has
failed.
#### 4.2.3.13 Support of content versioning
The support of the media component versioning is optional. When the
\"MediaComponentVersioning\" feature is supported, the NF service consumer and
the PCF shall comply with the procedures specified in this clause.
Upon each media component modification encoded in the \"medComponents\"
attribute included in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, if the content version was
previously assigned to a media component, the NF service consumer shall assign
a new content version. All the content related to that media component shall
be included and the content version shall be unique for the lifetime of the
media component.
NOTE: The NF service consumer will include all the content of the media
component in each media component modification in order to ensure that the
media component is installed with the proper information regardless of the
outcome of the QoS flow procedure related to previous interactions that are
not reported to the PCF yet.
If the PCF receives the \"contVer\" attribute for a certain media component,
the PCF shall follow the procedures described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], clause
4.2.6.2.14.
#### 4.2.3.14 Request of access network information
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to request access network
information for an existing \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource at service information modification when the \"NetLoc\" feature is
supported.
NOTE 1: Clause 4.2.6.6 describes the NF service consumer request of access
network information without providing service information.
The NF service consumer shall create event subscription information by
including in the \"AppSessionContextUpdateData\" data type the \"evSubsc\"
attribute of \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type with the corresponding list of
events to subscribe to.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message
described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute:
\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
a) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
b) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\"; and
\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).
When the PCF determines that the access network does not support the access
network information reporting because the SMF does not support the NetLoc
feature, the PCF shall respond to the NF service consumer including in the
\"EventsNotification\" data type the \"noNetLocSupp\" attribute set to
\"ANR_NOT_SUPPORTED\" value. Otherwise, the PCF shall immediately configure
the SMF to provide such access information, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512
[8].
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer with an HTTP response message
as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
NOTE 2: The NF service consumer does not invoke the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation to remove subscription to
access network information report since the \"Access Network Information
Notification\" is the one-time reported event. Once the access network
information is reported to the NF service consumer the subscription to the
access network information report is automatically terminated in the PCF and
the related information is removed.
#### 4.2.3.15 Modification of service information status
When the \"IMS_SBI\" feature is supported, the NF service consumer may update
the status of the service information. If the NF service consumer provides
service information that has been fully negotiated (e.g. based on the SDP
answer), the NF service consumer may include in the \"ascReqData\" attribute
the \"servInfStatus\" attribute set to \"FINAL\". In this case the PCF shall
authorize the session and provision the corresponding PCC rules to the SMF.
The NF service consumer may additionally provide preliminary service
information not fully negotiated yet (e.g. based on the SDP offer) at an
earlier stage. To do so, the NF service consumer shall include the
\"servInfStatus\" attribute set to \"PRELIMINARY\". Upon receipt of such
preliminary service information, the PCF shall perform an early authorization
check of the service information. If the NF service consumer requests the PCF
to report the access network information together with preliminary service
information, the PCF shall immediately configure the SMF to provide the access
network information.
#### 4.2.3.16 Support of SIP forking
When the \"IMS_SBI\" feature is supported, this procedure is used by a NF
service consumer to indicate that an existing \"Individual Application Session
Context\" resource comprises service information about several SIP dialogues.
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method to modify the service
information.
The NF service consumer may include in the HTTP PATCH request message
described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the
\"sipForkInd\" attribute and include the updated service information.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
When the \"sipForkInd\" attribute gets the value:
\- \"SEVERAL_DIALOGUES\", the PCF shall send additional PCC rules or
individual data flow filters to already provided PCC rules as described in
Annex B.3.1.
\- \"SINGLE_DIALOGUE\", the PCF shall update installed PCC rules and
Authorized-QoS information as described in Annex B.3.2.
#### 4.2.3.17 Provisioning of signalling flow information
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to provision or de-provision
information about the AF signalling IP flows between the UE and the NF service
consumer.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message
described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute:
\- when the procedure is used to provision information about the AF signalling
IP flows, a media component within the \"medComponents\" attribute including
the attributes described in clause 4.2.2.16 in the case of IMS restoration or
clause 4.2.2.12.3 otherwise;
\- when the procedure is used to de-provision information about the AF
signalling IP flows, for the media subcomponents containing the AF signalling
IP flows, the \"fStatus\" attribute set to the value \"REMOVED\".
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
#### 4.2.3.18 Support of resource sharing
When the \"ResourceSharing\" is supported by the NF service consumer and the
PCF, the NF service consumer may include, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the
\"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute within a media
component of the \"medComponents\" attribute to indicate to the PCF that the
related media of the modified Individual Application Session Context resource
may share resources with other media components in the related direction that
include the same value in the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or
\"sharingKeyDl\" attribute.
The NF service consumer may modify the conditions for resource sharing by
including the media component within the \"medComponents\" attribute with a
new value for the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\"
attribute. The NF service consumer may indicate that the related media of the
modified Individual Application Session resource is not sharing resources with
other media components in the related direction setting the \"sharingKeyUl\"
attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute to \"null\".
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method to update the
\"Individual Application Session Context resource\" as described in clause
4.2.3.2.
If the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute are
provided within a media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute, the PCF
may apply the mechanisms for resource sharing as described in 3GPP TS 29.512
[8], clause 4.2.6.2.8.
#### 4.2.3.19 Modification of MCPTT
The NF service consumer may include, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the
\"mcpttId\" attribute in order to indicate that the modified \"Individual
Application Session Context\" resource relates to the priority adjustment of
an MCPTT session. When the PCF receives the \"mcpttId\" attribute related to
that MCPTT session, the PCF may take specific actions on the corresponding PDU
session to ensure that the MCPTT session is prioritized. For the handling of
MCPTT session with priority call, see Annex B.13.
NOTE: When the PCF supports data rate control per network slice and/or data
rate control per network slice for a UE as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], it
is possible that, subject to operator policy and national/regional
regulations, prioritised services are exempted from the limitation of data
rate per network slice. In that case the PCF will handle the request from the
NF service consumer even if the authorized data rate per network slice is
exceeded.
Additionally, when the \"PrioritySharing\" feature is supported, the PCF may
receive the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute within the media component received
in the \"medComponents\" attribute as described in clause 4.2.2.21. In this
case, and if \"MCPTT-Preemption\" feature is supported, the PCF may receive
pre-emption information as also described in clause 4.2.3.21.
#### 4.2.3.20 Modification of MCVideo
The NF service consumer may include, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the
\"mcVideoId\" attribute in order to indicate that the modified \"Individual
Application Session Context\" resource relates to the priority adjustment of
an MCVideo session. When the PCF receives the \"mcVideoId\" attribute related
to that MCVideo session, the PCF may take specific actions on the
corresponding PDU session to ensure that the MCVideo session is prioritized.
For the handling of MCVideo session with priority call, see Annex B.15.
NOTE: When the PCF supports data rate control per network slice and/or data
rate control per network slice for a UE as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], it
is possible that, subject to operator policy and national/regional
regulations, prioritised services are exempted from the limitation of data
rate per network slice. In that case the PCF will handle the request from the
NF service consumer even if the authorized data rate per network slice is
exceeded.
#### 4.2.3.21 Priority sharing indication
When the \"PrioritySharing\" feature is supported, the NF service consumer may
include the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute set to \"ENABLED\" within a media
component of the \"medComponents\" attribute included in the \"ascReqData\"
attribute to indicate to the PCF that the related media flow is allowed to use
the same Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) as media flows belonging to
other \"Individual Application Session Context\" resources as described in
clause 4.2.2.21. In this case, if the \"MCPTT-Preemption\" feature is
supported, the NF service consumer may also include the \"preemptCap\",
\"preemptVuln\" and \"preemptControlInfo\" attributes as described in clause
4.2.2.21.
When the \"preemptControlInfo\" attribute is modified, the latest provided
value shall be applied to all potential media flow candidates.
If the NF service consumer earlier has indicated a media flow priority sharing
to the PCF by setting the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute to \"ENABLED\", the NF
service consumer may include the Priority-Sharing-Indicator AVP set to
\"DISABLED\" within a media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute to
indicate to the PCF that the related media flow shall not be part of the
mechanism for sharing the Allocation and Retention Priority with other media
flows any longer.
If this media flow was in priority sharing with other media flows the PCF
should readjust the Allocation and Retention Priority for the remaining
services sharing priority as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], clause 4.2.6.2.9
and handle the media flow excluded from priority sharing according to normal
PCC/QoS rule provisioning procedures described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], clause
4.2.6.2.
If the NF service consumer earlier has indicated a media flow priority sharing
to the PCF by setting the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute to \"ENABLED\" for
media flows and the NF service consumer indicates to remove one or more of the
media flows in priority sharing with other media flows, the PCF should
readjust the Allocation and Retention Priority for the remaining services
sharing priority as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], clause 4.2.6.2.9 and
handle the media flow removed according to normal PCC/QoS rule provisioning
procedures described in 3GPP TS 29.212 [8], clause 4.2.6.2.
#### 4.2.3.22 Modification of Subscription to Out of Credit notification
This procedure is used by the NF service consumer if the \"IMS_SBI\" feature
is supported to modify in the PCF the subscription to notification about
credit unavailability for the Service Data Flows within the AF application
session context.
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method to update the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource together with the modifications to the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message
described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the updated
values of the \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type, which either include in the
\"events\" attribute a new element with the \"event\" attribute set to the
value \"OUT_OF_CREDIT\" or remove from the \"events\" attribute the existing
element with the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"OUT_OF_CREDIT\".
As a result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
out of credit notification for the corresponding PCC Rule(s) as described in
3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer with an HTTP response message
as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
#### 4.2.3.23 Modification of Subscription to Service Data Flow QoS Monitoring
Information
This procedure is used by NF service consumer to modify the PCF subscription
for notification about packet delay between UPF and UE, when the
\"QoSMonitoring\" feature is supported.
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method to update the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource together with the modifications to the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message
described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the updated
values of the \"evSubsc\" attribute of \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type, as
follows:
\- to create a subscription to notifications of QoS monitoring report:
a) shall include the \"events\" array with an array that contains a new entry
per requested notification method with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"QOS_MONITORING\", and notification related information as described in
clause 4.2.2.23;
b) when the \"notifMethod\" of the new entry is \"EVENT_DETECTION\", shall
include a \"qosMon\" attribute with the QoS monitoring information as
described in clause 4.2.2.23.
c) shall include the new requested QoS monitoring parameter(s) to be measured
(i.e. DL, UL and/or round trip packet delay) within the \"reqQosMonParams\"
attribute;
d) may include the notification correlation identifier assigned by the AF
within the \"notifCorreId\" attribute;
e) if the feature \" ExposureToEAS\" is supported, may include the
\"directNotifInd\" attribute set to true to indicate the direct event
notification of QoS Monitoring data from the UPF; and
\- to remove a subscription to QoS monitoring information:
a) shall include the \"events\" array containing an array that shall omit the
corresponding entry with the \"event\" attribute value \"QOS_MONITORING\";
b) when the \"notifMethod\" attribute of the removed entry is
\"EVENT_DETECTION\", it shall contain the \"qosMon\" attribute set to null;
c) if the \"directNotifInd\" attribute was previously provided, it shall
contain the \"directNotifInd\" attribute set to null.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
QoS monitoring information for the corresponding active PCC rule(s) as
described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
#### 4.2.3.24 Update of TSCAI Input Information and TSC QoS related data
If the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" or \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" feature
is supported, the NF service consumer may update the TSCAI Input container and
the TSC QoS related data held in an \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource using the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation to modify
the TSCAI input information and QoS characteristics delivered to the SMF for
use in the 5G System.
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method as described in clause
4.2.3.2 to modify TSCAI input container and the TSC QoS related information.
The NF service consumer may indicate TSCAI input information and/or TSC QoS
related information for new TSC streams by adding, in the \"ascReqData\"
attribute, one or more media component entries within the \"medComponents\"
attribute including the \"tsnQos\" attribute and including the
\"tscaiInputUl\" attribute and/or the \"tscaiInputDl\" attribute and, when the
feature \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" is supported, the \"tscaiTimeDom\"
attribute, if available as described in clause 4.2.2.24.
The NF service consumer may update the TSCAI input information and/or the TSC
QoS related information for existing TSC traffic by including the updated
values in the \"tscaiInputUl\" attribute and/or \"tscaiInputDl\"attribute
and/orupdated values in the \"tsnQos\" attribute included in a media component
entry of the \"medComponents\" attribute included in the \"ascReqData\"
attribute.
The NF service consumer may delete the TSCAI input information and TSC QoS
related information of removed TSC traffic by removing the corresponding media
component entries within the \"medComponents\" attribute included in the
\"ascReqData\" attribute.
Alternatively, when the \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" and
\"AuthorizationWithRequiredQoS\" features are supported, the NF service
consumer (i.e., the TSCTSF or TSN AF) may update TSC QoS related information
updating the \"qosReference\" attribute, and/or may indicate the update of the
alternative service requirements updating the \"altSerReqs\" attribute as
specified in clause 4.2.3.30.
When the \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" and \"AltSerReqsWithIndQoS\" features
are supported, the NF service consumer (i.e., the TSCTSF or TSN AF) may update
TSC QoS related information updating the individual QoS requirement within the
\"tsnQos\" attribute, and/or may indicate the update of the alternative
service requirements updating the \"altSerReqsData\" attribute as specified in
clause 4.2.3.30.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
The PCF shall check whether the received TSCAI input information and TSC QoS
related information require to modify or to remove PCC rules in the SMF.
Provisioning of PCC rule(s) to the SMF shall be carried out as specified in
3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.3.25 Provisioning of TSC user plane node management information and
port management information
If the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" or \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" feature
is supported the NF service consumer (i.e., the TSN AF or the TSCTSF) may
provide a UMIC for the TSC user plane node functionality of the UPF/NW-TT
and/or a PMIC for the DS-TT port and/or PMIC(s) for the NW-TT ports to update
the configuration of the 5G system as a TSC user plane node by invoking the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation to the PCF.
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method as described in clause
4.2.3.2 to modify the \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource
holding the UMIC and/or the DS-TT PMIC and/or NW-TT PMIC(s).
The NF service consumer may include in the \"ascReqData\" attribute:
\- the DS-TT PMIC encoded in the \"tsnPortManContDstt\" and/or the one or more
NW-TT PMIC(s)encoded in the \"tsnPortManContNwtts\", if available; and/or
\- the UMIC encoded in the \"tsnBridgeManCont\", if available.
#### 4.2.3.26 Modification of Mission Critical Services
The NF service consumer may include, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the
\"mcsId\" attribute if it was not previously provided in order to indicate
that the modified AF session relates to an MCS session.
If the NF service consumer supports the SBI message priority mechanism for an
MCS session, the NF service consumer shall include the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-
Priority\" custom HTTP header towards the PCF as described in clause 4.2.2.12.
If the PCF receives the \"mcsId\" attribute, the PCF shall take specific
actions on the corresponding PDU session to ensure that the MCS session is
prioritised as defined in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
4.2.3.27 Support of CHEM feature
When CHEM feature is supported, the NF service consumer may include the value
of Maximum Packet Loss Rate for UL within the \"maxPacketLossRateUl\"
attribute and/or the value of Maximum Packet Loss Rate for DL within the
\"maxPacketLossRateDl\" attribute in \"medComponents\" attribute. For CHEM
feature, see Annex B.14.
#### 4.2.3.28 Support of FLUS feature
If the \"FLUS\" feature is supported by the NF service consumer, the NF
service consumer may include the \"flusId\" attribute within a media component
of the \"medComponents\" attribute to indicate that the related media of the
modified Individual Application Session Context resource corresponds to a FLUS
media stream. Additional QoS information for the treatment of FLUS media may
be provided within \"desMaxLatency\" attribute and/or \"desMaxLoss\"
attribute.
#### 4.2.3.29 Subscription to EPS Fallback report
When the \"EPSFallbackReport\" feature is supported, this procedure is used in
the NF service consumer to subscribe to the notification of EPS Fallback
events, if this event was not previously provisioned.
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method to update the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource together with the modifications to the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP PATCH request message
described in clause 4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, the updated
values of the \"evSubsc\" attribute of the \"EventsSubscReqDataRm\" data type,
which shall include in the \"events\" attribute a new element with the
\"event\" attribute set to \"EPS_FALLBACK\". The NF service consumer shall
request to the PCF to report EPS Fallback in conjunction with providing the
PCF with NF service consumer service information for voice media type as
described in clause 4.2.3.2.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
EPS Fallback for the corresponding active PCC rule(s) as described in 3GPP TS
29.512 [8].
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.3.2.
#### 4.2.3.30 Modification of required QoS information
When the \"AuthorizationWithRequiredQoS\" feature is supported, this procedure
is used by a NF service consumer to modify the required QoS by providing a
different QoS reference(s) parameter while the AF session is ongoing. When the
\"AltSerReqsWithIndQoS\" feature is supported, this procedure is used by a NF
service consumer to modify the Requested Alternative QoS Parameter set(s).
The NF service consumer shall use the HTTP PATCH method to modify the required
QoS information.
When the \"AuthorizationWithRequiredQoS\" feature is supported, the NF service
consumer may include in the HTTP PATCH request message described in clause
4.2.3.2, in the \"ascReqData\" attribute, within one or more entries of the
\"medComponents\" attribute included in the AppSessionContextUpdateData data
type:
\- a \"qosReference\" attribute, which may contain:
i. a QoS reference, that replaces an existing QoS reference value if the
\"qosReference\" attribute was previously provisioned, or creates a new one if
no \"qosReference\" attribute was previously provisioned;
ii. a \"null\" value, which removes a previously provisioned \"qosReference\"
attribute value.
\- an \"altSerReqs\" attribute, which may contain:
i. a prioritized list of alternative QoS references, which replaces an
existing alternative QoS references list if the \"altSerReqs\" attribute was
previously provisioned, or creates a new one if no \"altSerReqs\" attribute
was previously provisioned;
ii. a \"null\" value, which removes a previously provisioned alternative QoS
references list.
When the \"AltSerReqsWithIndQoS\" feature is supported, and the service QoS is
provided, or was previously provided using individual QoS parameters (e.g.
\"marBwUl\" and/or \"marBwDl\", attributes) instead of a QoS reference, the NF
service consumer may include within one or more entries of the
\"medComponents\" attribute:
\- an \"altSerReqsData\" attribute, which may contain:
i. a prioritized list of alternative service requirements that include
Requested Alternative QoS Parameter set(s), which replaces an existing list of
alternative service requirements that include Requested Alternative QoS
Parameter set(s) if the \"altSerReqsData\" attribute was previously
provisioned, or creates a new one if no \"altSerReqsData\" attribute was
previously provisioned;
ii. a \"null\" value, which removes a previously provisioned list of
alternative service requirements that include individual QoS parameter sets.
NOTE: The modification of the individual QoS parameters is performed by
provisioning within the \"medComponents\" attribute an update of the existing
values or deleting the previously provided values, as described in clause
4.2.3.2.
When the \"DisableUENotification\" feature is supported, the NF service
consumer may include a \"disUeNotif\" attribute, which may contain:
i. a \"true\" value if it was not provided or it was provided and set to
\"false\";
ii. a \"false\" value if it was provided and set to \"true\".
When the NF service consumer provides the \"altSerReqs\" attribute containing
a prioritized list of alternative QoS references or \"altSerReqsData\"
attribute containing a prioritized list of alternative service requirements
that include individual QoS parameter sets, the NF service consumer shall
subscribe to receive notifications from the PCF when the resources associated
to the corresponding service information have been allocated as described in
clause 4.2.3.10 and when the GBR QoS targets for one or more service data
flows can no longer (or can again) be guaranteed, as described in clause
4.2.3.6, if not previously subscribed.
Due to the updated required QoS information, the PCF may need to modify the
related PCC rules as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7] and provide the updated
information towards the SMF following the corresponding procedures specified
in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.3.2.

23.503 [4].
Figure 4.2.4.2-1 illustrates the application session context termination.
Figure 4.2.4.2-1: Application session context termination
When an AF session is terminated, and if the AF application session context
was created as described in clause 4.2.2 or in clause 4.2.6.3, the NF service
consumer shall invoke the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation to
the PCF using an HTTP POST request, as shown in figure 4.2.4.2-1, step 1.
The NF service consumer shall set the request URI to \"{apiRoot}/npcf-
policyauthorization/v1/app-sessions/{appSessionId}/delete\".
The NF service consumer may include in the body of the HTTP POST the
\"EventsSubscReqData\" data type with the \"evSubsc\" attribute indicating the
corresponding list of events to subscribe to.
When the PCF receives the HTTP POST request from the NF service consumer,
indicating the termination of the AF application session context information,
the PCF shall acknowledge that request by sending an HTTP response message
with the corresponding status code.
If the HTTP POST request from the NF service consumer is accepted, the PCF
shall send to the NF service consumer:
a) if event information is reported, a \"200 OK\" response to HTTP POST
request, as shown in figure 4.2.4.2-1, step 2a, including in the
\"AppSessionContext\" data type the \"evsNotif\" attribute, which encodes
within \"evNotifs\" attribute the event to report to the NF service consumer,
if available, as described in clause 4.2.5.2. If the event information is not
available at the PCF the PCF shall defer sending the response to the NF
service consumer and shall immediately configure the SMF to provide such
information, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8];
b) otherwise, the PCF shall send to the NF service consumer a \"204 No
Content\".
Afterwards, the PCF shall free the network resources allocated for the Service
Data Flow(s) corresponding to the deleted AF application session context
information. In order to do that, the PCF shall initiate the request for the
removal of any related PCC rules from the SMF, if not previously done,
following the corresponding procedures specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
If the HTTP POST request from the NF service consumer is rejected, the PCF
shall indicate in the response to HTTP POST request the cause for the
rejection as specified in clause 5.7.
#### 4.2.4.3 Reporting usage for sponsored data connectivity
When \"SponsoredConnectivity\" is supported, and the NF service consumer
indicated to enable sponsored data connectivity and the NF service consumer
provided usage thresholds for such sponsor to the PCF, the PCF shall report
accumulated usage to the NF service consumer using the response of the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation.
This procedure is initiated when:
\- the \"Individual Application Session Context\" is deleted by the NF service
consumer; or
\- the PCF requests the deletion of the \"Individual Application Session
Context\" to the NF service consumer, as described in clause 4.2.5.3, due to
PDU session termination, the termination of all the service data flows of the
AF session or the home operator policy disallowing the UE accessing the
sponsored data connectivity in the roaming case.
To report the accumulated usage, the PCF shall immediately configure the SMF
to retrieve the accumulated usage as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8]. When the
PCF receives the usage information from the SMF, the PCF shall notify the NF
service consumer by including the \"EventsNotification\" data type in the
response of the HTTP POST request as described in clause 4.2.4.2.
The PCF shall include:
\- an event of the \"AfEventNotification\" data type in the \"evNotifs\"
attribute with the matched event \"USAGE_REPORT\" in the \"event\" attribute;
and
\- the usage encoded in the \"usgRep\" attribute.

#### 4.2.5.16 Notification about TSC user plane node Information, no
Individual Application Session Context exists
If the \"TimeSensitiveNetworking\" or \"TimeSensitiveCommunication\" feature
is supported and if the PCF becomes aware that TSC user plane node information
for an external network (e.g. TSN) is available, but there is no \"Individual
Application Session Context\" resource bound to the SM Policy Association
updated with TSC user plane node related information, the PCF shall inform the
NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) about the detection of a TSC user
plane node information in the context of a PDU session by sending a
notification request:
\- to the request URI locally configured in the PCF for the NF service
consumer; or
\- if the request URI for the TSCTSF is not locally configured in the PCF, to
the notification URI registered by the TSCTSF in the NRF as default
notification subscription for time sensitive communication and time
synchronization notifications, and retrieved from NRF by the PCF using the
discovery service, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.510[27] for the PDU session
DNN/S-NSSAI.
NOTE 1: PCF configuration of TSN AF needs to ensure that the notification is
addressed to a TSN AF that connects to the same external network the UPF/NW-TT
connects to. How it is achieved is implementation specific. It can be based
e.g. on dedicated DNN/S-NSSAI combinations or on the received TSC user plane
node information.
NOTE 2: It is assumed that there is only one TSCTSF for a given DNN/S-NSSAI in
this release of the specification.
Figure 4.2.5.16-1 illustrates the notification about TSC user plane node
information when there is no Individual Application Session Context bound to
the SM Policy Association.
Figure 4.2.5.16-1: Notification about TSC user plane node Information, no AF
session context exists
When the PCF determines that the AF application session context does not exist
for the SM Policy Association that detected new port information and a
notification URI for the NF service consumer can be determined, the PCF shall
invoke the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation by sending the
HTTP POST request (as shown in figure 4.2.5.16-1, step 1) using the
notification URI locally configured in the PCF or, retrieved from NRF, and
appending the \"new-bridge\" segment path at the end of the URI, to trigger
the NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) to request the creation of an
Invidual Application Session Context resource to handle the TSC user plane
node detected in the context of a PDU session, configuring ports and TSC user
plane node management information, and providing the corresponding TSCAI input
containers and TSC traffic QoS related data (see clauses 4.2.2.2, 4.2.2.24,
4.2.2.25 and 4.2.2.31).
The PCF shall provide in the body of the HTTP POST request the
\"PduSessionTsnBridge\" data type including TSC user plane node information as
follows:
\- the \"tsnBridgeInfo\" attribute as received from the SMF;
\- the \"tsnBridgeManCont\" attribute as received from the SMF, if available;
\- the \"tsnPortManContDstt\" attribute and/or \"tsnPortManContNwtts\"
attribute as received from the SMF, if available; and

session of IP type, the UE IPv4 address within the \"ueIpv4Addr\" attribute or
the UE IPv6 prefix within the \"ueIpv6AddrPrefix\", the DNN within the \"dnn\"
attribute, the S-NSSAI within the \"snssai\" attribute and, if available, the
domain identity within the \"ipDomain\" attribute if UE IPv4 address is
provided.
NOTE 3: In the case of IP overlapping, the DNN, S-NSSAI and domain identity,
if available, are required for session binding in the PCF. Domain identity
applies as defined in clause 4.2.2.2.
Upon the reception of the HTTP POST request from the PCF, the NF service
consumer shall acknowledge that request.
With the received information, the NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF)
shall immediately trigger the creation of an Individual Application Session
Context resource to handle in this association the configuration of the new
TSC user plane node in the context of this PDU session, as described in
clauses 4.2.2.2, 4.2.2.24, 4.2.2.25 and 4.2.2.31.
NOTE 4: For the time synchronization service, the subscription to UE
availability for time-synchronization service can occur after the PDU Session
establishment has been completed in 5GS. Similarly, for the AF session with
required QoS, the indication of the required QoS and TSC Assistance Container
information can occur after the completion of the PDU session establishment.
In such cases, the PCF sends the notification to the TSCTSF about the
detection of a TSC user plane node information during PDU session
establishment, and the TSCTSF could defer the creation of the related
\"Individual Application Session Context\" till the reception of the
subscription to UE availability for time synchronization or the AF session
with required QoS occurs, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513[7].
The NF service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) may use the received TSC user
plane node information and/or the received DS-TT port management information
container and/or NW-TT port management information containers and the local
configuration to construct the DS-TT port and or NW-TT port management
information required to interwork with the external network.
#### 4.2.5.17 Notification about Reallocation of Credit
If the \"IMS_SBI\" and the \"ReallocationOfCredit\" features are supported and
if the PCF becomes aware that there is credit reallocated for one or more SDFs
after a former out of credit indication, the PCF shall inform the NF service
consumer accordingly if the NF service consumer has previously subscribed to
the \"REALLOCATION_OF_CREDIT\" event as described in clauses 4.2.2.34 and
4.2.3.32.
The PCF shall notify the NF service consumer by including the
\"EventsNotification\" data type in the body of the HTTP POST request as
described in clause 4.2.5.2.
The PCF shall include in the \"evNotifs\" attribute an entry with:
\- the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"REALLOCATION_OF_CREDIT\"; and
\- the SDFs that are impacted as consequence of the reallocation of credit
condition encoded in the \"flows\" attribute.
Upon the reception of the HTTP POST request from the PCF, the NF service
consumer shall acknowledge that request by sending an HTTP response message as
described in clause 4.2.5.2.
#### 4.2.5.18 Notification of MPS for DTS Outcome
When the MPSforDTS feature is supported and the PCF is informed about the
successful default QoS update, the PCF shall notify the NF service consumer as
described in clause 4.2.5.2, if the NF service consumer has previously
subscribed to the \"SUCCESSFUL_QOS_UPDATE\" event as described in clauses
4.2.2.12.2 and 4.2.3.12. The PCF shall notify the NF service consumer by
including within the \"evNotifs\" attribute, an entry with the \"event\"
attribute set to \"SUCCESSFUL_QOS_UPDATE\".
When the MPSforDTS feature is supported and the PCF is informed about the
failure of a default QoS update, the PCF shall notify the NF service consumer
as described in clause 4.2.5.2, if the NF service consumer has previously
subscribed to the \"FAILED_QOS_UPDATE\" event as described in clauses
4.2.2.12.2 and 4.2.3.12. The PCF shall notify the NF service consumer by
including within the \"evNotifs\" attribute, an entry with the \"event\"
attribute set to \"FAILED_QOS_UPDATE\".
#### 4.2.5.19 Notification about Application Detection Information
When the \"ApplicationDetectionEvents\" feature is supported, when the PCF
gets the knowledge that the traffic of the indicated application started or
stopped, the PCF shall inform the NF service consumer accordingly if the NF
service consumer has previously subscribed as described in clauses 4.2.6.9.
The PCF shall notify the NF service consumer by including the
\"EventsNotification\" data type in the body of the HTTP POST request as
described in clause 4.2.5.2.
The PCF shall include, for the detected application(s)\'s traffic:
\- within the \"evNotifs\" attribute an event entry of the
\"AfEventNotification\" data type with the matched event \"APP_DETECTION\" in
the \"event\" attribute; and
\- the \"adReports\" array, which for each detected application\'s traffic
shall include:
a) the \"adNotifType\" attribute to indicate whether the detection is about
the start of the application\'s traffic encoded as the \"APP_START\" value, or
about the stop of the application\'s traffic encoded as the \"APP_STOP\"
value; and
b) the application identifier within the \"afAppId\" attribute.
When the NF service consumer receives the HTTP POST request, it shall
acknowledge the request by sending a \"204 No Content\" response to the PCF.
Signalling flows for the notification of application detection information are
presented in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7].
NOTE: When the NF service consumer receives the notifications for multiple
applications, the NF service consumer (e.g. the PCF for the UE) can determine
which logic to apply (e.g. which AM policy to apply) based on local
configuration and operator policy.
In this release of the specification application detection applies only to the
application(s) with IP traffic.
#### 4.2.5.20 Notification about satellite backhaul category changes
When the PCF gets the knowledge that there is a change of the backhaul used
for the PDU session between satellite backhaul categories (i.e., GEO, MEO,
LEO, or other satellite) or between a satellite and a non-satellite backhaul
category, the PCF shall inform the NF service consumer accordingly if the NF
service consumer has previously subscribed as described in clauses 4.2.2.35
and 4.2.3.33 and 4.2.6.10.
The PCF shall notify the NF service consumer by including the
\"EventsNotification\" data type in the body of the HTTP POST request as
described in clause 4.2.5.2.
The PCF shall include within the \"evNotifs\" attribute an event entry of the
\"AfEventNotification\" data type with the matched event \"SAT_CATEGORY_CHG\"
in the \"event\" attribute, and within the \"satBackhaulCategory\" attribute
the received satellite backhaul category (i.e., GEO, MEO, LEO, or other
satellite) or the indication of non-satellite backhaul.
When the NF service consumer receives the HTTP POST request, it shall
acknowledge the request by sending a \"204 No Content\" response to the PCF.
The NF service consumer may also update the AF application session context
information by sending an HTTP PATCH request to the PCF.
#### 4.2.5.21 Notification about UP change enforcement failure
If the \"RoutingReqOutcome\" feature is supported and if the PCF becomes aware
that the enforcement of the UP path change fails (as specified in clause
4.2.6.2.6.2 of 3GPP TS 29.512 [8]), the PCF shall inform the NF service
consumer accordingly if the NF service consumer has previously subscribed to
the \"UP_PATH_CHG_FAILURE\" event as described in clauses 4.2.2.8 and 4.2.3.8.
The PCF shall notify the NF service consumer by including the
\"EventsNotification\" data type in the body of the HTTP POST request as
described in clause 4.2.5.2.
The PCF shall include in the \"evNotifs\" attribute an entry with the
\"event\" attribute set to the value \"UP_PATH_CHG_FAILURE\".
Upon the reception of the HTTP POST request from the PCF, the NF service
consumer shall acknowledge that request by sending an HTTP response message as
described in clause 4.2.5.2.
#### 4.2.5.22 Notification about PDU session established/terminated events
If the PCF becomes aware that the SM Policy Association contains the callback
URI of the PCF for a UE then, the PCF shall inform the NF service consumer
(i.e. the PCF for a UE) about:
\- the PDU session establishment, when the PCF receives the callback URI of
the PCF for a UE from the SMF; and
\- the PDU session termination, when the PCF receives the SM Policy
Association termination from the SMF;
by sending a notification request to the received callback URI of the PCF for
a UE.
Figure 4.2.5.22-1 illustrates the notification about PDU session
established/terminated events.
Figure 4.2.5.22-1: Notification about PDU session established/terminated
events
When the PCF becomes aware that a SM Policy Association is receiving the
callback URI of the PCF for a UE, or becomes aware that the SM Policy
Association that is terminating contains the callback URI of the PCF for a UE,
the PCF shall invoke the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation by
sending an HTTP POST request (as shown in figure 4.2.5.22-1, step 1) using the
callback URI contained in the SM Policy Association and appending the \"pdu-
session\" path segment at the end of the URI.
NOTE: The PCF includes in the notification request a Routing Binding
Indication as specified in 3GPP TS 29.500 [5], clause 6.12 if an SBA binding
indication relative to the PCF for a UE is available in the SM Policy
Association together with the callback URI of the PCF for a UE.
The PCF shall provide in the body of the HTTP POST request the
PduSessionEventNotification data type, which shall include an indication of
PDU session establishment/termination as follows:
\- the \"evNotif\" attribute, of \"AfEventNotification\" data type, which
shall include the \"PDU_SESSION_STATUS\" event within the \"event\" attribute;
\- the SUPI of the PDU session within the \"supi\" attribute;
\- the served UE address as the identification of the reported PDU session:
i. for IP type PDU sessions, the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the UE in the
\"ueIpv4\" or \"ueIpv6\" attribute; and
ii. for Ethernet type PDU sessions, the MAC address of the UE in the \"ueMac\"
attribute;
\- whether the PDU session is established or terminated within the \"status\"
attribute; and
\- when the \"status\" attribute indicates \"ESTABLISHED\":
i. the PCF addressing information where the NF service consumer (i.e. PCF for
a UE) may send the subscription request to notification about the detected
application traffic in the \"pcfInfo\" attribute; and
ii. the context information of the related PDU session, i.e., the DNN withing
the \"dnn\" attribute, the S-NSSAI within the \"snssai\" attribute and the
GPSI within the \"gpsi\" attribute, if available.
Upon the reception of the HTTP POST request from the PCF, and if the request
is accepted, the NF service consumer (i.e. PCF for a UE) shall acknowledge
that request by sending an HTTP response message with a \"204 No Content\"
status code as described in figure 4.2.5.22-1, step 2.
The NF service consumer (i.e. PCF for a UE) may use the notified PCF
address(es) and SBA binding indication, if available, to subscribe with the
PCF for a PDU session to the detection of application(s) traffic, as described
in clause 4.2.6.9.
### 4.2.6 Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation
#### 4.2.6.1 General
The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation enables NF service
consumers handling of subscription to events for the existing application
session context. Subscription to events shall be created:
\- within the application session context establishment procedure by invoking
the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation, as described in clause
4.2.2; or
\- within the application session context modification procedure by invoking
the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation, as described in clause
4.2.3; or
\- by invoking the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation for
the existing application session context, as described in clause 4.2.6.2.
The following procedures using the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service
operation is supported:
\- Handling of subscription to events for the existing application session
context.
\- Initial subscription to events without provisioning of service information.
\- Subscription to usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity.
\- Request of access network information.
\- Subscription to notification of signalling path status.
\- Subscription to Service Data Flow QoS Monitoring Information.
\- Subscription to application detection notifications.
\- Subscription to satellite backhaul category changes
#### 4.2.6.2 Handling of subscription to events for the existing application
session context
This procedure is used to create a subscription to events for the existing AF
application session context bound to the corresponding PDU session or to
modify an existing subscription, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], 3GPP TS
23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [4].
Figure 4.2.6.2-1 illustrates the creation of events subscription information
using HTTP PUT method.
Figure 4.2.6.2-1: Creation of events subscription information using HTTP PUT
Figure 4.2.6.2-2 illustrates the modification of events subscription
information using HTTP PUT method.
Figure 4.2.6.2-2: Modification of events subscription information using HTTP
PUT
When the NF service consumer decides to create a subscription to one or more
events for the existing application session context or to modify an existing
subscription previously created by itself at the PCF, the NF service consumer
shall invoke the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation by
sending the HTTP PUT request to the resource URI representing the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource in the PCF, as shown in figure 4.2.6.2-1, step 1
and figure 4.2.6.2-2, step 1. The NF service consumer shall provide in the
\"EventsSubscReqData\" data type of the body of the HTTP PUT request:
\- the \"events\" attribute with the list of events to be subscribed; and
\- the \"notifUri\" attribute that includes the Notification URI to indicate
to the PCF where to send the notification of the subscribed events.
NOTE 1: The \"notifUri\" attribute within the EventsSubscReqData data
structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are sent to
a new NF service consumer.
Upon the reception of the HTTP PUT request from the NF service consumer, the
PCF shall decide whether the received HTTP PUT request is accepted.
If the HTTP PUT request from the NF service consumer is rejected, the PCF
shall indicate in the HTTP response the cause for the rejection as specified
in clause 5.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the PCF determines the received
HTTP PUT request needs to be redirected, the PCF shall send an HTTP redirect
response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
If the PCF accepted the HTTP PUT request to create a subscription to events,
the PCF shall create the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource and shall send
the HTTP response message to the NF service consumer as shown in figure
4.2.6.2-1, step 2. The PCF shall include in the \"201 Created\" response:
\- a Location header field that shall contain the URI of the created \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource i.e. \"{apiRoot}/npcf-policyauthorization/v1/app-
sessions/{appSessionId}/events-subscription\"; and
\- a response body with the \"EventsSubscPutData\" data type, that contains
the attributes of the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type, representing the
created \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource.
If the PCF determines that one or more of the subscribed events are already
met in the PCF, the PCF may also include the attributes of the
\"EventsNotification\" data type within the \"EventsSubscPutData\" data type
to notify about the already met events in the PCF.
If the PCF accepted the HTTP PUT request to modify the events subscription,
the PCF shall modify the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource and shall send
to the NF service consumer:
\- the HTTP \"204 No Content\" response (as shown in figure 4.2.6.2-2, step
2a); or
\- the HTTP \"200 OK\" response (as shown in figure 4.2.6.2-2, step 2b)
including in the \"EventsSubscPutData\" data type the updated representation
of the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource encoded within the attributes of
the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type and, if one or more of the updated
subscribed events are already met in the PCF, the notification of these events
by including the attributes of the \"EventsNotification\" data type.
The PCF shall include in the \"evsNotif\" attribute:
\- if the NF service consumer subscribed to the \"PLMN_CHG\" event in the HTTP
PUT request, the \"event\" attribute set to \"PLMN_CHG\" and the \"plmnId\"
attribute including the PLMN Identifier or the SNPN Identifie if the PCF has
previously requested to be updated with this information in the SMF; and
NOTE 2: The SNPN Identifier consists of the PLMN Identifier and the NID.
\- if the NF service consumer subscribed to the \"ACCESS_TYPE_CHANGE\" event
in the HTTP PUT request, the \"event\" attribute set to \"ACCESS_TYPE_CHANGE\"
and:
i. the \"accessType\" attribute including the access type, and the \"ratType\"
attribute including the RAT type when applicable for the notified access type;
and
ii. if the \"ATSSS\" feature is supported, the \"addAccessInfo\" attribute
with the additional access type information if available, where the access
type is encoded in the \"accessType\" attribute, and the RAT type is encoded
in the \"ratType\" attribute when applicable for the notified access type; and
NOTE 3: For a MA PDU session, if the \"ATSSS\" feature is not supported by the
NF service consumer the PCF includes the \"accessType\" attribute and the
\"ratType\" attribute with a currently active combination of access type and
RAT type (when applicable for the notified access type). When both 3GPP and
non-3GPP accesses are available, the PCF includes the information
corresponding to the 3GPP access.
iii. the \"anGwAddr\" attribute including access network gateway address when
available,
if the PCF has previously requested to be updated with this information in the
SMF.
Based on the received subscription information from the NF service consumer,
the PCF may create a subscription to event notifications or may modify the
existing subscription to event notifications, for a related PDU session from
the SMF, as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
#### 4.2.6.3 Initial subscription to events without provisioning of service
information
The NF service consumer may subscribe with the PCF to events notification
without providing service information.
NOTE 1: This service operation is intended to create a resource that enables
to handle subscription to events without provisioning service information. For
the scenarios where it is known the NF service consumer, after creating a
subscription without service information, could require an application session
context with the PCF with required service information, the NF service
consumer needs to create an Individual Application Session context as
described in clause 4.2.2.2.
Figure 4.2.6.3-1 illustrates the initial subscription to events without
provisioning of service information.
Figure 4.2.6.3-1: Initial Subscription to events without provisioning of
service information
When a NF service consumer establishes an application session context with the
PCF to subscribe to events and does not require PCC control for the related
media, the NF service consumer shall invoke the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation by sending the HTTP POST
request to the resource URI representing the \"Application Sessions\"
collection resource of the PCF, as shown in figure 4.2.6.3-1, step 1.
The NF service consumer shall include in the \"ascReqData\" attribute of the
\"AppSessionContext\" data type in the payload body of the HTTP POST request:
\- either the \"ueMac\" attribute containing the UE MAC address, or the
\"ueIpv4\" attribute or \"ueIpv6\" attribute containing the UE IPv4 or the
IPv6 address;
\- the \"notifUri\" attribute containing the URI where the PCF shall request
to the NF service consumer the deletion of the \"Individual Application
Session Context\" resource\"; and
\- the \"evSubsc\" attribute of \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type to request
the notification of certain user plane events. The NF service consumer shall
include:
a. the events to subscribe to in the \"events\" attribute; and
b. the notification URI where to address the notification of the met events
within the \"notifUri\" attribute.
The NF service consumer may provide in the \"AppSessionContext\" data type the
DNN in the \"dnn\" attribute, SUPI in the \"supi\" attribute or other
information if available.
If the PCF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to
the internal PCF error or due to the error in the HTTP POST request, the PCF
shall send the HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7.
Otherwise, when the PCF receives the HTTP POST request from the NF service
consumer, the PCF shall apply session binding as described in 3GPP TS 29.513
[7]. The PCF identifies the PDU session for which the HTTP POST request
applies as described in clause 4.2.2.2.
The information required for session binding (UE MAC address, or UE Ipv4 or
IPv6 address, DNN, SUPI and other available information, such as S-NSSAI
and/or IPv4 address domain identifier) is provisioned in the \"Individual
Application Session Context\" resource. The events subscription is provisioned
in the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource.
Based on the received subscription information from the NF service consumer,
the PCF may create a subscription to event notifications for a related PDU
session from the SMF, as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
If the PCF created the \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource within the
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource, the PCF shall send to the
NF service consumer a \"201 Created\" response to the HTTP POST request, as
shown in figure 4.2.6.3-1, step 2. The PCF shall include in the \"201
Created\" response:
\- a Location header field; and
\- an \"AppSessionContext\" data type in the payload body.
The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created events
subscription sub-resource i.e. \"{apiRoot}/npcf-policyauthorization/v1/app-
sessions/{appSessionId}/events-subscription\".
The \"AppSessionContext\" data type payload body shall contain the
representation of the created \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource and \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource.
The PCF shall include in the \"evsNotif\" attribute:
\- if the NF service consumer subscribed to the event \"PLMN_CHG\" in the HTTP
POST request, the \"event\" attribute set to \"PLMN_CHG\" and the \"plmnId\"
attribute including the PLMN Identifier or the SNPN Identifier if the PCF has
previously requested to be updated with this information in the SMF;
NOTE 2: The SNPN Identifier consists of the PLMN Identifier and the NID.
\- if the NF service consumer subscribed to the event \"ACCESS_TYPE_CHANGE\"
in the HTTP POST request, the \"event\" attribute set to
\"ACCESS_TYPE_CHANGE\" and:
i. the \"accessType\" attribute including the access type, and the \"ratType\"
attribute including the RAT type when applicable for the notified access type;
and
ii. if the \"ATSSS\" feature is supported, the \"addAccessInfo\" attribute
with the additional access type information if available, where the access
type is encoded in the \"accessType\" attribute, and the RAT type is encoded
in the \"ratType\" attribute when applicable for the notified access type; and
NOTE 3: For a MA PDU session, if the \"ATSSS\" feature is not supported by the
NF service consumer the PCF includes the \"accessType\" attribute and the
\"ratType\" attribute with a currently active combination of access type and
RAT type (if applicable for the notified access type). When both 3GPP and
non-3GPP accesses are available, the PCF includes the information
corresponding to the 3GPP access.
iii. the \"anGwAddress\" attribute including access network gateway address
when available,
if the PCF has previously requested to be updated with this information in the
SMF; and
\- if the \"IMS_SBI\" feature is supported and if the NF service consumer
subscribed to the event \"CHARGING_CORRELATION\" in the HTTP POST request, the
\"event\" attribute set to \"CHARGING_CORRELATION\" and may include the
\"anChargIds\" attribute containing the access network charging identifier(s)
and the \"anChargAddr\" attribute containing the access network charging
address.
NOTE 4: Due to the resource structure, as result of the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation using POST methods, the
PCF creates an Individual Application Session context resource which can only
be deleted via Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation.
#### 4.2.6.4 Subscription to usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to subscribe with the PCF to
usage monitoring of sponsored data connectivity or to provide updated usage
thresholds for the existing application session context, when the \"Sponsored
Connectivity\" feature is supported.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP PUT request message
described in clause 4.2.6.2 the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type, that shall
contain:
\- the \"events\" attribute with a new entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\"
data type with the \"event\" attribute set to \"USAGE_REPORT\"; and
\- the \"usgThres\" attribute with the usage thresholds to apply.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.6.2.
#### 4.2.6.5 Void
#### 4.2.6.6 Request of access network information
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to request the PCF to report
the access network information (i.e. user location and/or user timezone
information) without providing service information when the \"NetLoc\" feature
is supported.
The NF service consumer can request access network information without
providing service information:
\- at initial subscription to events, using the HTTP POST request message as
described in clause 4.2.6.3; and
\- at modification of the subscription to events, using the HTTP PUT request
message as described in clause 4.2.6.2.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP request message:
\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
a) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
b) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\"; and
\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).
When the PCF determines that the access network does not support the access
network information reporting because the SMF does not support the NetLoc
feature, the PCF shall respond to the NF service consumer including in the
\"EventsNotification\" data type the \"noNetLocSupp\" attribute set to
\"ANR_NOT_SUPPORTED\" value. Otherwise, the PCF shall immediately configure
the SMF to provide such access information, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.512
[8].
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer with the HTTP POST response as
described in clause 4.2.6.3 and with the HTTP PUT response as described in
clause 4.2.6.2.
#### 4.2.6.7 Subscription to notification of signalling path status
When the feature \"IMS_SBI\" is supported, this procedure is used by a NF
service consumer to subscribe to notifications of the status of the AF
signalling transmission path.
The NF service consumer shall create a new \"Individual Application Session
Context\" resource with the PCF for the AF signalling using the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation.
The NF service consumer shall provide:
\- the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the UE in the \"ueIpv4\" or \"ueIpv6\"
attribute;
\- within the \"evSubsc\" attribute, the \"event\" attribute set to
\"FAILED_RESOURCES_ALLOCATION\"; and
\- a media component within the \"medComponents\" attribute including:
\- the \"medCompN\" attribute set to \"0\"; and
\- a single media subcomponent within the \"medSubComps\" attribute with:
\- the \"flowUsage\" attribute set to the value \"AF_SIGNALLING\"; and
\- if the procedures for NF service consumer provisioning of AF signalling
flow information do not apply, the \"fNum\" attribute set to \"0\".
When the \"fNum\" attribute is set to \"0\", the rest of attributes within the
related media component and media subcomponent shall not be used.
The PCF shall perform session binding as described in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7] and
shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.6.3.
PCC rules related to AF signalling IP flows should be provisioned to SMF using
the corresponding procedures specified at 3GPP TS 29.512 [8] at an earlier
stage (e.g. typically at the establishment of the QoS flow dedicated for AF
signalling IP flows). The PCF may install the corresponding dynamic PCC rules
for the AF signalling IP flows if none has been installed before.
NOTE 1: Well-known ports (e.g. 3GPP TS 24.229 [32] for SIP) or wildcard ports
can be used by PCF to derive the dynamic PCC for the AF signalling IP flows.
If the \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource is only used for
subscription to notification of AF signalling path status, the NF service
consumer may cancel the subscription to notifications of the status of the AF
signalling transmission path removing the resource as described in clause
4.2.4.2.
NOTE 2: The \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource created for
the AF signalling can also be used when the NF service consumer requests
notifications of access type change, access network information for SMS over
IP and/or when the NF service consumer provisions AF Signalling Flow
Information.
#### 4.2.6.8 Subscription to Service Data Flow QoS Monitoring Information
This procedure is used by NF service consumer to subscribe and/or modify the
PCF subscription for notification about packet delay between UPF and UE, when
the \"QoSMonitoring\" feature is supported.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP PUT request message
described in clause 4.2.6.2 the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type, that shall
contain:
\- to create a subscription to notifications of QoS monitoring report:
a) shall include the \"events\" array with an array that contains a new entry
per requested notification method with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"QOS_MONITORING\", and notification related information as described in
clause 4.2.2.23;
b) when the \"notifMethod\" of the new entry is \"EVENT_DETECTION\", shall
include a \"qosMon\" attribute with the QoS monitoring information as
described in clause 4.2.2.23;
c) shall include the new requested QoS monitoring parameter(s) to be measured
(i.e. DL, UL and/or round trip packet delay) within the \"reqQosMonParams\"
attribute; and
d) may include the notification correlation identifier assigned by the AF
within the \"notifCorreId\" attribute;
e) if the feature \"ExposureToEAS\" is supported, may include the
\"directNotifInd\" attribute set to true to indicate the direct event
notification of QoS Monitoring data from the UPF.
\- to remove a subscription to QoS monitoring information:
a) shall include the \"events\" array containing an array that shall omit the
corresponding entry with the \"event\" attribute value \"QOS_MONITORING\"; and
b) when the \"notifMethod\" of the removed entry is \"EVENT_DETECTION\", it
shall omit the \"qosMon\" attribute;
c) shall omit the \"reqQosMonParams\";
d) if the feature \"ExposureToEAS\" is supported, shall omit the
\"directNotifInd\" attribute;
The NF service consumer shall include other events related information that
shall remain unchanged.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
QoS monitoring information for the corresponding active PCC rule(s) as
described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.6.2.
#### 4.2.6.9 Subscription to application detection notification
This procedure is used by a NF service consumer to request the PCF the
subscription to application (e.g. start, stop) detection notifications, if the
\"ApplicationDetectionEvents\" feature is supported.
The NF service consumer can request the subscription to notification of
application detection events without providing service information:
\- at initial subscription to events, using the HTTP POST request message as
described in clause 4.2.6.3; and
\- at modification of the subscription to events, using the HTTP PUT request
message as described in clause 4.2.6.2.
The NF service consumer shall include:
\- To subscribe to notifications about the detection of the start/stop of one
or more application\'s traffic the \"evSubsc\" attribute within the POST
request as described in clause 4.2.6.3, with:
a. the \"events\" array, including an event with the \"event\" attribute value
set to \"APP_DETECTION\"; and
b. the \"afAppIds\" attribute, with the list of AF application identifier(s)
that refer to the applications\' traffic to detect.
\- To modify the subscription to notifications of application\'s traffic
detection the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type within the PUT request as
described in clause 4.2.6.2, including an event with the \"event\" attribute
value set to \"APP_DETECTION\" and an updated list of AF application
identifiers within the \"afAppIds\" attribute.
\- To remove the subscription to notifications about the start and stop of the
applications traffic, an \"events\" array within the PUT request as described
in clause 4.2.6.2, without including any event with the \"event\" attribute
value \"APP_DETECTION\" and omitting the \"afAppIds\" attribute.
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer with the HTTP POST response as
described in clause 4.2.6.3 and with the HTTP PUT response as described in
clause 4.2.6.2.
The PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to Application Detection for
the corresponding PCC rule(s) as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
In this release of the specification application detection applies only to the
application(s) with IP traffic.
#### 4.2.6.10 Subscription to satellite backhaul category changes
When the feature \"SatelliteBackhaul\" is supported, this procedure is used by
NF service consumer to subscribe and/or modify the PCF subscription to receive
a notification when the satellite backhaul category changes and when the
backhaul category changes between satellite backhaul and non-satellite
backhaul.
The NF service consumer shall include in the HTTP PUT request message
described in clause 4.2.6.2 the \"EventsSubscReqData\" data type, or in the
HTTP POST request message described in clause 4.2.6.3 the \"evSubsc\"
attribute, that shall contain the \"events\" array, with a new entry with the
\"event\" attribute set to \"SAT_CATEGORY_CHG\" to indicate the creation of a
subscription to backhaul category changes.
The NF service consumer shall include other events related information that
shall remain unchanged.
As result of this action, the PCF shall set the appropriate subscription to
satellite backhaul changes for the PDU session as described in in 3GPP TS
29.512 [8].
The PCF shall reply to the NF service consumer as described in clause 4.2.6.2
or in clause 4.2.6.3. The PCF shall include the \"evsNotif\" attribute with an
entry in the \"evNotifs\" array with the \"event\" attribute set to
\"SAT_CATEGORY_CHG\" and the \"satBackhaulCategory\" attribute including the
satellite backhaul category or the indication of non-satellite backhaul if the
PCF has previously subscribed with the SMF to changes in this information.
### 4.2.7 Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Unsubscribe service operation
#### 4.2.7.1 General
The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Unsubscribe service operation enables NF service
consumers to remove subscription to all subscribed events for the existing
application session context. Subscription to events shall be removed:
\- by invoking the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Unsubscribe service operation for
the existing application session context, as described in clause 4.2.7.2; or
\- within the application session context modification procedure by invoking
the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation, as described in clause
4.2.3; or
\- within the application session context termination procedure by invoking
the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation, as described in clause
4.2.4.
The following procedure using the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Unsubscribe service
operation is supported:
\- Unsubscription to events.
#### 4.2.7.2 Unsubscription to events
This procedure is used to unsubscribe to all subscribed events for the
existing AF application session context, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2],
3GPP TS 23.502 [3] and 3GPP TS 23.503 [4].
Figure 4.2.7.2-1 illustrates the unsubscription to events using the HTTP
DELETE method.
Figure 4.2.7.2-1: Removal of events subscription information using HTTP DELETE
When the NF service consumer decides to unsubscribe to all subscribed events
for the existing application session context, the NF service consumer shall
invoke the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Unsubscribe service operation by sending
the HTTP DELETE request message to the resource URI representing the \"Events
Subscription\" sub-resource in the PCF, as shown in figure 4.2.7.2-1, step 1.
Upon the reception of the HTTP DELETE request message from the NF service
consumer, the PCF shall decide whether the received HTTP request message is
accepted.
If the HTTP DELETE request message from the NF service consumer is accepted,
the PCF shall delete \"Events Subscription\" sub-resource and shall send to
the NF service consumer a HTTP \"204 No Content\" response message. The PCF
may delete the existing subscription to event notifications for the related
PDU session from the SMF as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8].
If the HTTP DELETE request message from the NF service consumer is rejected,
the PCF shall indicate in the HTTP response message the cause for the
rejection as specified in clause 5.7.

### 5.5.4 Detected 5GS Bridge for a PDU session
#### 5.5.4.1 Description
The detected TSC user plane node for a PDU session operation is used by the
PCF to notify the NF service consumer about the detection of TSC user plane
node information in the context of a PDU session and to trigger in the NF
service consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) the creation of a new Individual
Application Session Context to associate it with the detected TSC user plane
node for the PDU session.
The PCF shall use the locally configured notification URI of the NF service
consumer (i.e. TSN AF or TSCTSF) or the notification URI of the NF service
consumer (i.e. TSCTSF) discovered via Nnrf_NFDiscovery service as defined in
3GPP TS 29.510 [27], if not configured, as request URI of the notification
request. The \"callback\" definition in the OpenAPI specification is
associated to the \"ApplicationSessions\" resource.

### 5.5.5 Notification about PDU session event
#### 5.5.5.1 Description
The Notification about PDU session events not bound to an Individual
Application Session Context (eventNotificationPduSession) is used by the PCF
to notify the NF service consumer (e.g., the PCF for a UE) about the PDU
session events.
The PCF shall use the NF service consumer (e.g. PCF for a UE) callback URI
implicitly subscribed (e.g. contained in the SM Policy Association of the
related PDU session) as request URI of the notification request, and append
the \"pdu-session\" segment path at the end of the URI. The \"callback\"
definition in the OpenAPI specification is associated to the
\"ApplicationSessions\" resource.
#### 5.5.5.2 Target URI

All IP flows within a \"MediaSubComponent\" data type are permanently disabled
by supplying \"FlowStatus\" data type with a deletion indication.
Bandwidth information and the \"fStatus\" attribute provided within the
MediaComponent applies to all those IP flows within the media component, for
which no corresponding information is being provided within the
\"medSubComps\" attribute. As defined in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7], the bandwidth
information within the media component level \"marBwUl\" and \"marBwDl\"
attributes applies separately to each media subcomponent except for media
subcomponents with a \"flowUsage\" attribute with the value \"RTCP\". The
mapping of bandwidth information for RTCP media subcomponent is defined in
3GPP TS 29.513 [7] clause 7.3.3.

Attribute name Data type P Cardinality Description Applicability afSigProtocol
AfSigProtocol O 0..1 Indicates the protocol used for signalling between the UE
and the NF service consumer. It may be included only if the \"flowUsage\"
attribute is set to the value \"AF_SIGNALLING\". ProvAFsignalFlow ethfDescs
array(EthFlowDescription) O 1..2 Contains the flow description for the Uplink
and/or Downlink Ethernet flows.  
fNum integer M 1 Identifies the ordinal number of the service data flow.  
fDescs array(FlowDescription) O 1..2 Contains the flow description for the
Uplink and/or Downlink IP flows.  
fStatus FlowStatus O 0..1 Indicates whether the status of the service data
flows is enabled or disabled.  
flowUsage FlowUsage O 0..1 Flow usage of the flows (e.g. RTCP, AF signalling).  
marBwUl BitRate O 0..1 Maximum requested bandwidth for the Uplink.  
marBwDl BitRate O 0..1 Maximum requested bandwidth for the Downlink.  
tosTrCl TosTrafficClass O 0..1 Type of Service or Traffic Class.

The bit rate information and flow status information provided within the
\"MediaSubComponent\" data type takes precedence over information provided
within \"MediaComponent\" data type.
All service data flows within a \"MediaSubComponent\" data type are
permanently disabled by supplying \"FlowStatus\" data type with a deletion
indication.

## 5.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [25] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [5], the access to the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization API, based on local configuration, may be authorized
by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [26]), using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [27])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 authorization is used, an NF service consumer, prior to consuming
services offered by the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization API, shall obtain a \"token\"
from the authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service,
as described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [27], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF service consumer used for
discovering the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service.
The Npcf_PolicyAuthorization API defines a single scope \"npcf-
policyauthorization\" for OAuth2 authorization (as specified in 3GPP TS 33.501
[25]) for the entire API, and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
The present Annex contains an OpenAPI [11] specification of HTTP messages and
content bodies used by the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization API.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API.
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification file contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900
[28] and clause 5.3.1 of the 3GPP TS 29.501 [6] for further information).

###### ## Annex B (normative): IMS Related P-CSCF Procedures over N5
# B.1 Provision of Service Information at P-CSCF
When the \"IMS_SBI\" feature is supported, the P-CSCF shall send service
information to the PCF upon every SIP message that includes an SDP answer
payload for the purpose of authorizing the IP flows and the QoS resources
required for a negotiated IMS session, unless the SDP payload only relates to
a circuit-switched bearer (i.e. \"c=\" line set to \"PSTN\" and an \"m=\" line
set to \"PSTN\", refer to 3GPP TS 24.292 [29]). The service information shall
be derived both from the SDP offer and the SDP answer. This ensures that the
PCF receives proper information to perform media authorization for all
possible IMS session set-up scenarios, and that the PCF is also capable of
handling session modifications. The P-CSCF may include \"servInfStatus\"
attribute set to \"FINAL\".
Additionally, the P-CSCF may send service information to the PCF when
receiving a SIP message that includes an SDP offer payload for the purpose of
performing an early bandwidth authorization check, or for enabling pre-
authorization for a UE terminated IMS session establishment or modification
with UE initiated resource reservation, or for the retrieval of network
provided access network information (see clause B.8.2).
The P-CSCF shall send service information to the PCF when receiving a SIP
message that includes an SDP offer payload when the IMS session is an MPS
session that requires priority treatment. For a UE terminated session the
P-CSCF may send the service information derived from the SDP offer when the
SDP offer either does not include any preconditions information or includes
preconditions information indicating that the local preconditions (i.e. the
preconditions related to the remote peer) are already met. In this case, the
P-CSCF shall derive the service information only from the SDP offer and shall
include \"servInfStatus\" attribute set to \"PRELIMINARY\".
NOTE 1: For a UE terminated session setup, when the SDP offer either does not
include any preconditions information or includes preconditions information
indicating that the local preconditions (i.e. the preconditions related to the
remote peer) are already met, the terminating UE can request a resource
modification prior to sending the SDP answer. Even if the IP address and port
information in the session information derived from the SDP offer can be
insufficient for PCC rule authorization, the policy to handle such UE
initiated requests at the PCF can take into account the fact that an IMS
session establishment is ongoing, for instance in deciding whether to
authorize the request and in selecting an appropriate charging key and a
gating policy.
The P-CSCF shall derive the value of the \"fDescs\" attribute within the
service information from the SDP as follows:
\- An uplink entry in the \"fDescs\" attribute shall be formed as follows: The
destination address shall be taken from the SDP information received by the
P-CSCF in downlink direction, while the source IP address may be formed from
the address present in the SDP received by the P-CSCF in uplink direction
(taking into account only the 64 bit prefix of the Ipv6 address) Source and
destination ports shall be derived according to rules provided in 3GPP TS
29.513 [7] clause 7.2.
EXAMPLE 1: Assuming UE A sends an SDP to UE B, the PCF of UE B uses the
address present in this SDP for the destination address of UE B\'s uplink
entry in the \"fDescs\" attribute, while the PCF of the UE A uses the 64 bit
prefix of the same address for the source address of UE A\'s uplink entry in
the \"fDescs\" attribute. If the source address is not formed from the 64 bit
prefix, the source address shall be wildcarded.
\- A downlink entry in the \"fDescs\" attribute shall be formed as follows:
The destination address shall be taken from the SDP information received by
the P-CSCF in uplink direction, while the source IP address may be formed (in
order to reduce the possibilities of QoS flow misuse) from the destination
address in the SDP received by the P-CSCF in downlink direction (taking into
account only the 64 bit prefix of the Ipv6 address) Source and destination
ports shall be derived according to rules provided in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7]
clause 7.2.
EXAMPLE 2: Assuming UE A sends an SDP to UE B, the PCF of UE A uses the
address present in this SDP for the destination address of UE A\'s downlink
entry in the \"fDescs\" attribute, while the PCF of UE B uses the 64 bit
prefix of the same address for the source address of UE B\'s downlink entry in
the \"fDescs\" attribute. If the source address is not formed from the 64 bit
prefix, the source address shall be wildcarded.
The P-CSCF shall derive the bandwidth information within the service
information, from the \"b=AS\" SDP parameter and \"a=bw-info\" SDP parameter,
if available. If \"a=bw-info\" is used for bandwidth derivation, the P-CSCF
shall use the SDP attribute line that contains the bandwidth properties for
the IP version used by the UE, as detailed in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7] clause 7.2.
If the received \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute line(s) contain only bandwidth
properties for an IP version that is not used by the UE, the P-CSCF shall re-
compute the bandwidth properties for the used IP version and use that value
for the bandwidth derivation as defined in 3GPP TS 26.114 [30].
NOTE 2: If no IP version is included for any of the \"a=bw-info\" SDP
attribute lines related to a certain payload type and direction then IPv6 is
assumed for all bandwidth properties related to the same direction and payload
type, on all of the related \"a=bw-info\" SDP attribute lines, see clause 19
of 3GPP TS 26.114 [30].
If \"a=bw-info\" is used for bandwidth derivation and it includes both known
and unknown bandwidth properties, the P-CSCF shall only consider the known
bandwidth properties to derive the bandwidth information and ignore the
unknown ones. If the\" a=bw-info\" line is received with an unknown
directionality, then the entire \"a=bw-info\" line shall be ignored.
For the possibly associated RTCP IP flows, the P-CSCF shall use the SDP
\"b=RR\" and \"b=RS\" parameters, if present, as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513
[7] clause 7.2. The \"b=AS\", \"b=RR\" and \"b=RS\" parameters in the SDP
contain all the overhead coming from the IP-layer and the layers above, e.g.
IP, UDP, RTP and RTCP payload, or IP, UDP and RTCP.
For multiplexed RTP/RTCP flows (as negotiated using the \"a=rtcp-mux\" SDP
attribute defined in IETF RFC 5761 [31], a P-CSCF supporting RTP/RTCP
transport multiplexing shall derive the bandwidth information within the
service information as specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7] clause 7.2.
However, if service information is received containing the \"b=TIAS\" SDP
parameter that corresponds to an SDP answer payload, and if the P-CSCF
supports this parameter, the P-CSCF may derive the bandwidth from this
parameter rather than from the \"b=AS\" SDP parameter, as detailed in 3GPP TS
29.513 [7] clause 7.2.
When available, the P-CSCF shall also indicate to PCF, as a complement to the
Service Information, the IMS Communication Service Identifier within the
\"afAppId\" attribute. The originating P-CSCF shall take the IMS Communication
Service Identifier value from the SIP response. The terminating P-CSCF shall
take the IMS Communication Service Identifier value from the SIP request.
Otherwise, the P-CSCF may not be able to provide an IMS Communication Service
Identifier value to the PCF. The format and specific headers where IMS
communication service identifiers are transported within SIP are defined in
3GPP TS 24.229 [32].
NOTE 3: In order to indicate the IMS Communication Service Identifier to the
PCF, the originating P-CSCF sets the \"afAppId\" attribute to the ICSI
contained in the topmost occurrence of the \"+g.3gpp.icsi-ref\" header field
parameter of the Feature-Caps header field(s) of 18x or 2xx SIP response
(Feature-Caps: *;+g.3gpp.icsi-ref=\"urn%Aurn-7%A3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel\")
and the terminating P-CSCF sets the \"afAppId\" attribute to the ICSI of the
P-Asserted-Service header information received in the SIP request (e.g.
P-Asserted-Service: urn:urn-7:3gpp-service.ims.icsi.mmtel). Since the headers
and the format of the ICSI can vary depending on the case, the PCF has to be
prepared to accept the complete ICSI information received in different
formats, as described in clause 7.2A.8.2 in 3GPP TS 24.229 [32].
Additionally, if \"ResourceSharing\" feature is supported, the P-CSCF may
include the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute
within a media component of the \"medComponents\" attribute in order to
indicate the PCF that resource sharing should apply for the media components
in the related direction with the same value for the \"sharingKeyUl\"
attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute.
Additionally, if \"PrioritySharing\" feature is supported, the P-CSCF may
provide the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute within a media component of the
\"medComponents\" attribute as described in clause 4.2.2.21 and 4.2.3.21.
NOTE 4: The P-CSCF obtains this information from the Application Server as
described in 3GPP TS 23.228 [33], clause 5.4.7.9.
NOTE 5: RTCP flows are not subject to resource sharing. This requirement
cannot be met for multiplexed RTP/RTCP flows as in this case there is no
mechanism in the current release to distinguish between RTP and RTCP flows.
For IMS emergency services provided by a PLMN or an SNPN if the \"servUrn\"
attribute does not include an emergency service URN, i.e. a top-level service
type of \"sos\" as specified in IETF RFC 5031 [34] and possibly additional
sub-service information on the type of the emergency service and the PCF binds
the IMS service session to a PDU session established to an Emergency DNN, the
PCF shall return the application error UNAUTHORIZED_NON_EMERGENCY_SESSION to
the P-CSCF. Upon receiving an application error
UNAUTHORIZED_NON_EMERGENCY_SESSION the P-CSCF shall apply the procedures
defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [32].
NOTE 6: The PCF determines whether a PDU session is established to an
Emergency DNN based on the information received over N7 and operator
configuration.
If the \"afReqData\" attribute is provided in the \"ascReqData\" attribute
indicating \"5GS-level UE Identities required\", the PCF shall provide the
available user information for the PDU session in the serving network (either
a PLMN or an SNPN) within the \"ueIds\" attribute included in the
\"ascRespData\" attribute, where each entry shall contain the IMSI (for PLMN
access) or either IMSI or NAI (for SNPN access) within the \"supi\", and/or
the MSISDN within the \"gpsi\" and/or the IMEI(SV) within the \"pei\"
attributes.
The PCF may decide not to authorize requested service information. The PCF
will indicate it to the P-CSCF by rejecting the HTTP request with an HTTP
\"403 Forbidden\" response message including the \"cause\" attribute set to
\"REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\". Upon receiving an HTTP \"403 Forbidden\"
response message including the \"cause\" attribute set to the value
\"REQUESTED_SERVICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED\" the P-CSCF shall apply the procedures
defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [32].
# B.2 Enabling of IP Flows
## B.2.1 General
Prior to the completion of the SIP session set-up, i.e. until the 2xx response
to the INVITE request is received, the P-CSCF may enable or disable media IP
flows depending on operator policy, thus allowing or forbidding early media in
forward and/or backward direction. The P-CSCF may set the values of the
\"fStatus\" attribute derived from the SDP direction attributes as defined in
3GPP TS 29.513 [7] clause 7.3.3 or set the values of the \"fStatus\"
attributes considering the em-param of the P-Early-Media header field
according to clause B.2.2 or downgrade the values of the \"fStatus\" attribute
derived from the SDP direction attribute based on the configuration in the
P-CSCF according to clause B.2.3. However for multiplexed RTP/RTCP flows (as
negotiated using the \"a=rtcp-mux\" SDP attribute defined in IETF RFC 5761
[31]), a P-CSCF supporting RTP/RTCP transport multiplexing shall set the
\"fStatus\" attribute to \"ENABLED\" to prevent that RTCP is blocked. If the
P-CSCF chooses to modify the values of the \"fStatus\" as received from the
SDP direction attribute, the P-CSCF shall store the last received SDP.
When a 2xx response is received, the P-CSCF shall enable all media IP flows
according to the direction attribute within the last received SDP, as
specified in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7] clause 7.3.3. When a 2xx response is received
and the P-CSCF previously provided the values of the \"fStatus\" attributes
different from the value derived from the SDP direction attribute in the
session information, the P-CSCF shall provide service information with values
of the \"fStatus\" attributes corresponding to the last received SDP.
NOTE: In most cases a 2xx response is a 200 (OK) response.
If the P-CSCF receives SDP answers after the completion of the SIP session
set-up, i.e. after the 2xx response to the INVITE request is received, the
P-CSCF shall provide the \"fStatus\" attribute, based on the last received SDP
answer. The \"fStatus\" attribute shall be derived from the SDP according to
3GPP TS 29.513 [7] clause 7.3.3.
## B.2.2 Gate control procedures considering the P-Early-Media header field
Prior to the completion of the SIP session set-up, the P-CSCF may use the em-
param of the P-Early-Media header field defined in IETF RFC 5009 [35] in order
to enable or disable early media in forward and/or backward direction. If the
P-CSCF uses the em-param of the P-Early-Media header field for the gate
control of early media, the P-CSCF shall perform the following procedures.
In the terminating P-CSCF, when a SIP message with the P-Early-Media header
field is received from the UE and the policies configured in the P-CSCF
indicate that the UE is authorized to send early media, then:
1) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"ENABLED\" if:
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is
\"sendrecv\" or no SDP direction attribute has been received; or
2) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"ENABLED-UPLINK\" if:
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is
\"sendonly\"; or
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is
\"sendrecv\" or \"sendonly\" or no SDP direction attribute has been received;
or
3) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"ENABLED-DOWNLINK\" if:
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is
\"recvonly\"; or
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"recvonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the UE is
\"sendrecv\" or \"recvonly\" or no SDP direction attribute has been received;
or
4) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"DISABLED\" if either
the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field or the last
received SDP direction attribute from the UE includes \"inactive\"; or
5) the P-CSCF may set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"DISABLED\" or apply the
rules defined in clause B.2.2 if the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media
header field includes \"sendonly\" or \"recvonly\" and the last received SDP
direction attribute from the UE is \"recvonly\" or \"sendonly\" respectively.
NOTE 1: If the UE is authorized to send early media, the P-CSCF will not
remove or modify the P-Early-Media header field according to 3GPP TS 24.229
[32].
When a SIP message with the P-Early-Media header field is received from the
functional entity within the trust domain, and if:
\- the P-Early-Media header field includes the \"gated\" parameter, then the
P-CSCF may decide not to perform the gate control of early media; or
\- the P-Early-Media header field does not include the \"gated\" parameter,
then the P-CSCF shall perform the following procedures:
1) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"ENABLED\" if:
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional
entity is \"sendrecv\" or no SDP direction attribute has been received; or
2) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"ENABLED-DOWNLINK\" if:
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional
entity is \"sendonly\"; or
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional
entity is \"sendrecv\" or \"sendonly\" or no SDP direction parameter has been
received; or
3) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"ENABLED-UPLINK\" if:
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"sendrecv\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional
entity is \"recvonly\"; or
\- the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field includes
\"recvonly\" and the last received SDP direction attribute from the functional
entity is \"sendrecv\" or \"recvonly\" or no SDP direction parameter has been
received; or
4) the P-CSCF shall set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"DISABLED\" if either
the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media header field or the last
received SDP direction attribute from the functional entity includes
\"inactive\"; or
5) the P-CSCF may set the \"fStatus\" attribute to \"DISABLED\" or apply the
rules defined in clause A.2.2 if the received em-param(s) in the P-Early-Media
header field includes \"sendonly\" or \"recvonly\" and the last received SDP
direction attribute from the functional entity is \"recvonly\" or \"sendonly\"
respectively.
NOTE 2: According to IETF RFC 5009 [35], the non-direction parameter \"gated\"
can be included after the direction parameter (e.g. \"sendrecv\") in the
parameter list. The proxy performing gating of early media can add the
parameter before forwarding the SIP message.
When a SIP message without the P-Early-Media header field is received from
either the functional entity within the trust domain or the UE that is
authorized to send early media, then the P-CSCF may set the \"fStatus\"
attribute to \"DISABLED\" or apply the rules defined in clause B.2.3 or apply
the rules defined in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7] clause 7.3.3.
NOTE 3: As indicated in IETF RFC 5009 [35] the applicable preconditions need
to be met in order to allow early media in a particular direction.
When a SIP message is received from the functional entity other than the
functional entity within the trust domain or the UE that is authorized to send
early media, then the P-CSCF shall not use the received em-param(s) in the
P-Early-Media header field and may apply the rules defined in clause B.2.2 or
apply the rules defined in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7] clause 7.3.3.
NOTE 4: The P-CSCF will remove or modify the P-Early-Media header field in the
above case.
## B.2.3 Gate control procedures based on the configuration in the P-CSCF
Prior to the completion of the SIP session set-up, the P-CSCF may downgrade
the values of the \"fStatus\" attributes derived from the SDP direction
attributes based on the configuration in the P-CSCF. If the P-CSCF has the
configuration for the gate control of early media, the P-CSCF shall perform
the following procedures.
NOTE: The gate control of early media can be configured in the P-CSCF per UE
basis.
When the \"fStatus\" attribute derived from the SDP direction attribute is
\"ENABLED\", then the P-CSCF may downgrade the value of the \"fStatus\"
attribute to the value \"DISABLED\", \"ENABLED_UPLINK\", or
\"ENABLED_DOWNLINK\" based on the configuration in the P-CSCF.
When the \"fStatus\" attribute derived from the SDP direction attribute is
\"ENABLED_UPLINK\" or \"ENABLED_DOWNLINK\", then the P-CSCF may downgrade the
value of the \"fStatus\" attribute to the value \"DISABLED\" based on the
configuration in the P-CSCF.
# B.3 Support for SIP forking
## B.3.0 General
The P-CSCF shall be able to handle forking when PCC is applied and the
\"IMS_SBI\" feature is supported. Forking can occur as specified in 3GPP TS
23.228 [33]. The related UE procedures are described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [32].
## B.3.1 PCC rule provisioning for early media for forked responses
When a SIP session has been originated by a connected UE, the P-CSCF may
receive multiple provisional responses due to forking before the first final
answer is received. Multiple early media session may be established during
this process.
The UE and the P-CSCF become aware of the forking only when a subsequent
provisional response arrives for a new early dialogue. After the first early
media session is established, for each subsequent provisional response
establishing an additional early media session, the P-CSCF shall use an
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation containing the
\"sipForkInd\" attribute with value \"SEVERAL_DIALOGUES\" and include the
service information derived from the latest provisional response.
The P-CSCF shall also provision the service information derived from any
subsequent SDP offer-answer exchange within an early dialogue (e.g. in PRACK
and OK(PRACK), or UPDATE and OK(UPDATE) ) using an
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation containing the
\"sipForkInd\" attribute with value \"SEVERAL_DIALOGUES\" and the derived
service information.
When receiving an Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation containing
the \"sipForkInd\" attribute with value \"SEVERAL_DIALOGUES\", the PCF shall
identify the existing \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource with
existing authorization information.
The PCF shall send additional PCC Rules or individual service data flow
filters to already provided PCC rules as required by the \"fDescs\" attribute
within the AF session context information to the SMF. The PCF shall authorize
any additional media components and any increased QoS requirements for the
previously authorized media components, as requested within the service
information.
The PCF shall authorize the maximum bandwidth required by any of the
dialogues, but not the sum of the bandwidths required by all dialogues. Thus,
the QoS authorized for a media component is equal to the highest QoS requested
for that media component by any of the forked responses.
The PCF shall open or close the gates for service flows depending on the flow
status that is being provisioned. However, if a flow ID has been enabled in
uplink or downlink direction or both way within previous service information,
it shall remain enabled even if the PCF receives service information that
disable this flow ID within an Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service
operation containing the \"sipForkInd\" attribute with value
\"SEVERAL_DIALOGUES\".
If the P-CSCF provides one or more media components within the
\"medComponents\" attribute with the \"fStatus\" attribute set to \"REMOVED\"
for previously authorized media component(s) the media component shall remain
as authorized and the PCF shall not take any action on that media
component(s).
NOTE: There can be cases where a forked response could not support some of the
media components included in the SDP Offer (e.g. when early session
disposition SDP as described in Annex B.6 applies, the forked response related
to the early session could include the port set to zero for those media
components not related to the early session or when a subsequent SDP Offer-
Answer to indicate that some media is disabled). For those cases the P-CSCF
will indicate the PCF about the removal of the corresponding media component.
However this media component is already supported by other UEs and the PCF
needs to maintain the corresponding PCC rules until the final SDP answer is
received in the P-CSCF in order to avoid the release of resources in the
network.
## B.3.2 Updating the provisioned PCC rules at the final answer
The P-CSCF shall store the SDP information for each early dialogue separately
till the first final SIP answer is received. Then the related early dialogue
is progressed to an established dialogue to establish the final SIP session.
All the other early dialogues are terminated. The service information for the
SIP session is updated to match the requirements of the remaining early
dialogue only.
When receiving the first final SIP response, the P-CSCF shall send an
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation setting to null the
\"sipForkInd\" attribute and shall include the service information derived
from the SDP corresponding to the dialogue of the final response. The P-CSCF
shall provision the full service information including the applicable
\"fDescs\" attribute and \"fStatus\" attribute.
When receiving an Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation with a
\"sipForkInd\" attribute with value \"SINGLE_DIALOGUE\", the PCF shall update
installed PCC Rules information and Authorized-QoS information to match only
the requirements of the service information within this
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation. The PCF should immediately
remove PCC Rule(s) or individual service data flow filters not matching IP
flow(s) in the updated Service Information, to reduce the risk for initial
clipping of the media stream, and to minimize possible misuse of resources.
The PCF shall also open or close the gates for service flows according to the
flow status in the received service information.
# B.4 Notification of AF Signalling Transmission Path Status
When the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message from an attached UE,
the P-CSCF may subscribe to notifications of the status of the AF signalling
transmission path using the procedures specified in clause 4.2.6.7. Once the
P-CSCF has subscribed, the P-CSCF may receive notifications from the PCF
according to clause 4.2.5.10.
NOTE: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for Emergency
sessions.
The P-CSCF shall cancel the subscription to notification of the status of the
AF signalling transmission path when the AF signalling to that particular user
is terminated (i.e. when the user is de-REGISTERED from the IM CN subsystem).
When the P-CSCF receives a notification of loss of signalling connectivity
from the PCF, the P-CSCF shall behave as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [32].
# B.5 Indication of Emergency Registration and Session Establishment
When the P-CSCF receives an initial REGISTER SIP message for an IMS emergency
registration or an INVITE SIP message for an emergency session and the P-CSCF
determines that there are no IMS-level roaming interfaces, and the \"IMS_SBI\"
feature is supported the P-CSCF may request the PCF to provide the 5GS-Level
UE identities (GPSI, SUPI, PEI) available for that PDU session in the serving
network (either a PLMN or an SNPN) using the procedure as specified in this
clause (for an IMS emergency registration) or B.1 (for an IMS emergency
session establishment).
A P-CSCF may request the PCF to provide the 5GS-level identities (GPSI, SUPI,
PEI) available for that PDU session when no service information is available
in the P-CSCF. To do so, the P-CSCF shall create an \"Individual Application
Session Context\" resource in the PCF for the AF signalling using an
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation. The P-CSCF shall provide
the UE\'s IP address (using either the \"ueIpv4\" attribute or the \"ueIpv6\"
attribute) and the \"afReqData\" attribute set to \"UE_IDENTITY\". The P-CSCF
shall include the \"servUrn\" attribute set to the value \"sos\", in order to
indicate that the new AF session context relates to emergency traffic that is
not related to a specific emergency service.
If the P-CSCF supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an emergency
session, it shall include the \"3gppâ€‘Sbiâ€‘Messageâ€‘Priority\" custom HTTP header
towards the PCF as described in clause 6.8.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
NOTE 1: If the P-CSCF supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an
emergency session, the P-CSCF includes the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\"
custom HTTP header based on P-CSCF policies in relation to valid values of the
\"servUrn\" attribute. The highest user priority value is mapped to the
corresponding lowest value of the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom HTTP
header.
When the PCF receives an Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation as
described in the preceding paragraphs from the P-CSCF, the PCF shall perform
session binding as described in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7]. When the PCF receives the
\"servUrn\" attribute indicating an emergency session, the PCF may apply
special policies, for instance prioritising service flows relating to the AF
session context or allowing these service flows free of charge.
When the \"servUrn\" attribute indicates that the AF session context relates
to emergency traffic and the \"afReqData\" attribute is received indicating
\"UE_IDENTITY\", the PCF shall provide the requested available user
information (MSISDN, IMSI (for PLMN access) or either IMSI or NAI (for SNPN
access), IMEI(SV)) for the PDU session within \"ueIds\" attribute within the
\"ascRespData\" in the HTTP \"201 Created\" response.
When the P-CSCF receives the HTTP \"201 Created\" response with the 5GS-level
UE identities from the PCF, the P-CSCF stores the \"ueIds\" received within
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resource returned in the HTTP \"201
Created\" response and behaves as defined in 3GPP TS 24.229 [32].
NOTE 2: The user information received within the \"ueIds\" attribute can be
used to support PSAP callback functionality for anonymous IMS emergency
sessions. See 3GPP TS 23.167 [40] for further information.
The P-CSCF may decide to delete the \"Individual Application Session Context\"
resource at any time. In that case, the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete
service operation, as described in clause 4.2.4.2.
A SIP INVITE request can contain a service URN as defined in IETF RFC 5031
[34] within the request URI. If the service within this URN is \"sos\",
possibly with additional sub-service information, the P-CSCF shall provision
this service and sub-service information within the \"servUrn\" attribute
towards the PCF. The P-CSCF may also provision possible information about
other services received within the service URN.
# B.6 Support for Early Session disposition SDP
## B.6.1 General
As a network option, when the \"IMS_SBI\" feature is supported, the P-CSCF may
support the PCC procedures in the present clause to handle \"early session\"
disposition type SDP, as standardised in IETF RFC 3959 [38].
## B.6.2 Service Information Provisioning for Early Media
The P-CSCF can receive \"early session\" disposition SDP in addition to
\"session\" disposition SDP in SIP early dialogues.
The P-CSCF shall then provision service information derived both from the
\"early session\" disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP applying the
procedures in clauses B.1, B.2, and B.3, and in the present clause.
The P-CSCF shall apply the mapping rules in Annex C to derive the flow
identifiers from \"early session\" disposition SDP.
If a single media line with one media type (e.g. \"audio\" or \"video\") is
contained in \"early session\" disposition SDP and a single media line with
the same media type is contained in the \"session\" disposition SDP of the
same SIP dialogue, and both media lines describe service flows of the same
directionality (uplink, downlink, or bidirectional), the P-CSCF should
describe those SDP media lines in the same session information media component
(with the same flow ID).
The \"early session\" disposition SDP can also contain media lines of a type
not included in the \"session\" disposition SDP, or several media lines of the
same type. Such media components shall be described in own media components in
the service information.
If the P-CSCF desires to invoke special policies or separate event
notifications for an \"early session\" disposition media line, it may choose
to provision a separate session information media component even if a media
line with the same media type and directionality is contained in \"session\"
disposition SDP.
NOTE 1: A PCF is then likely to supply separate PCC rules for early media and
the corresponding final media. This may lead to an over provisioning of
resources during call establishment and a subsequent reconfiguration of the
radio bearer, or even to a call failure if the extra resources are not
authorized or available.
If the P-CSCF receives \"early session\" disposition SDP before any
\"session\" disposition SDP and supplies service information derived from the
\"early session\" disposition SDP at this point of time, it shall use
dedicated media components relating only to the \"early session\" disposition
SDP in the service information.
NOTE 2: The \"session\" disposition SDP offer will frequently occur before the
\"early session\" disposition SDP offer, but can also occur in parallel or in
exceptional cases afterwards. The \"session\" disposition SDP answer can be
contained in the same SIP message as the \"early session\" disposition SDP
offer, or can be sent in a 200 OK (INVITE), i.e. after the \"early session\"
disposition SDP answer.
If the P-CSCF includes any media component relating both to \"early session\"
disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP in the service information,
the P-CSCF shall:
\- provision the service information derived from \"early session\"
disposition SDP and the service information derived from \"session\"
disposition SDP in separate Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update requests (to the
same \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource), and shall send a
new Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request only after any previous
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request has been acknowledged; and
\- provision the first service information (either derived from \"early
session\" disposition SDP or \"session\" disposition SDP) without the
\"sipForkInd\" attribute, or with \"sipForkInd\" attribute with value
\"SINGLE_DIALOGUE\"; and
\- provision all subsequent service information during ongoing call
establishment with the \"sipForkInd\" attribute with value SEVERAL_DIALOGUES;
and
\- if an SDP answer has been received and codecs are provisioned within the
\"codecs\" attribute included in a media component of the \"medComponents\"
attribute, provision within a \"codecs\" attribute the codec derived from the
corresponding offer together with a codec derived from the SDP answer.
NOTE 3: The P-CSCF needs to provision the service information derived from
\"early session\" disposition SDP and the service information derived from
\"session\" disposition SDP in separate Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update
requests because the encoding of the media component does not allow for the
simultaneous provisioning of two corresponding filters.
NOTE 4: The PCF will treat service information containing the \"sipForkInd\"
attribute as described in clause B.3.
## B.6.3 Updating the Provisioned Service Information when Dialogue is
established
The P-CSCF shall store the SDP information for the \"session\" disposition
type until the first final SIP answer is received. Then the early media
described in the \"early session\" disposition type SDP are terminated.
The P-CSCF shall then update the service information to match the requirements
of the media described in the \"session\" disposition type SDP only:
\- If the P-CSCF included any media component relating both to \"early
session\" disposition SDP and \"session\" disposition SDP in the service
information, the P-CSCF shall send an Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update request
without the \"sipForkInd\" attribute or with a \"sipForkInd\" attribute with
value SINGLE_DIALOGUE and shall include the service information derived from
the \"session\" disposition SDP. The P-CSCF shall provision the full service
information including the applicable \"fDescs\" attribute and \"fStatus\"
attribute.
\- The P-CSCF shall disable any media component(s) in the service information
that relate to early media only by setting their flow status to \"REMOVED\".
# B.7 Provision of Signalling Flow Information at P-CSCF
When the P-CSCF has successfully concluded the initial registration of an
attached UE, i.e., when the P-CSCF has sent to the UE a SIP 200 (OK) response
to the SIP REGISTER request, the P-CSCF may provision information about the
SIP signalling flows between the UE and itself using the procedure specified
in clause 4.2.2.16. If the P-CSCF already has created an \"Individual
Application Session Context\" resource with the PCF related to the signalling
with the UE, e.g. one that has been opened according to the procedure
described in clause B.4, the P-CSCF shall reuse the already open session to
provision the SIP Signalling IP Flow information using the procedure specified
in clause 4.2.3.17.
NOTE: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for Emergency
sessions.
If the P-CSCF provisions information about SIP signalling flows, the P-CSCF
shall ensure that for each signalling IP flow information it provides, the
flow descriptions within the \"fDescs\" attribute shall accurately reflect the
IP flow information as seen in the IP header \'on the wire\'. The P-CSCF shall
set the value of the \"afSigProtocol\" attribute to \"SIP\".
When the P-CSCF de-registers the UE and terminates SIP Signalling to the UE,
the P-CSCF shall de-provision the SIP Signalling IP flow information from the
PCRF as described in clauses 4.2.2.16 and 4.2.3.17.
# B.8 Retrieval of network provided location information
## B.8.1 General
According to clause E.7 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [33], the P-CSCF can use PCC to
retrieve network provided location information. Information flows related to
the distribution of network provided location information within the IMS are
provided in Annex R of 3GPP TS 23.228 [33].
The following clauses provide optional PCC procedures to support the retrieval
of network provided location information.
The originating P-CSCF can, depending on operator policy, retrieve the user
location and/or UE Time Zone information either before sending the INVITE or
MESSAGE towards the terminating side or upon reception of the SDP answer from
the terminating side.
The terminating P-CSCF can, depending on operator policy, retrieve the user
location and/or UE Time Zone information either upon reception of a SIP INVITE
or upon reception of a SIP response.
The originating and terminating P-CSCF can, depending on operator policy,
retrieve the user location and/or UE Time Zone information at mid call. e.g.,
when the P-CSCF learns about the access type change.
## B.8.2 Retrieval of network provided location information at originating
P-CSCF for inclusion in SIP Request
If the originating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve network
provided location information before forwarding a SIP INVITE request, upon
reception of the SIP INVITE/UPDATE request, the P-CSCF shall invoke:
\- the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation according to clause
4.2.2.14 (SIP INVITE request); or
\- the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation according to clause
4.2.3.14 or the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation according
to clause 4.2.6.6 (SIP INVITE/UPDATE request);
including in the corresponding HTTP request:
\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
a) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
b) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\"; and
\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).
If the SIP INVITE request is an initial SIP INVITE request, the P-CSCF shall
create a new \"Individual Application Session Context\" for the new SIP
session with the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation
according to clause 4.2.6.6 (if no session information is included) or with
the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation according to clause
4.2.2.14 (if preliminary session information is included).
The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCF within the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation as described in clause
4.2.5.11 and should include this access network information in the SIP
INVITE/UPDATE requests that it forwards. When the retrieved access network
information corresponds to the \"tnapId\" or \"twapId\" attribute, the P-CSCF
may also map the retrieved access network information to a Geographical
Identifier for routing, as specified in clause E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [33].
If the originating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve network
provided location information before forwarding a SIP MESSAGE request, upon
reception of a MESSAGE request, the P-CSCF shall invoke the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation including in the
corresponding HTTP request:
\- the IP address (IPv4 or IPv6) of the UE in the \"ueIpv4\" or \"ueIpv6\"
attribute;
\- a media component within the \"medComponents\" attribute including:
a) the \"medCompN\" attribute set to \"0\"; and
b) a single media subcomponent within the \"medSubComps\" attribute with:
i. the \"flowUsage\" attribute set to the value \"AF_SIGNALLING\"; and
ii. if the procedures for AF provisioning of AF signalling flow information do
not apply, the \"fNum\" attribute set to \"0\".
\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
a) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
b) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\"; and
\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).
The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCF within the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation as described in clause
4.2.5.11 and should include this access network information in the SIP MESSAGE
requests that it forwards. When the retrieved access network information
corresponds to the \"tnapId\" or \"twapId\" attribute, the P-CSCF may also map
the retrieved access network information to a Geographical Identifier for
routing, as specified in clause E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [33].
If the AF application session context is only used for retrieval of network
provided location information, at reception of this information, the AF may
delete the context of application session information using the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_ Delete service operation.
## B.8.3 Retrieval of network provided location information at originating
P-CSCF for inclusion in SIP response confirmation
If an originating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve network
provided location information before forwarding an SDP answer, the P-CSCF
shall apply the following procedures.
Upon reception of an SDP offer, the P-CSCF may invoke the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation to the PCF according to
clause B.1 and may include in the corresponding HTTP POST request:
\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
a) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
b) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\"; and
\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).
Upon reception of an SDP answer, the P-CSCF will invoke the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update service operation to the PCF according to
clause B.1. If the P-CSCF has not requested access network information upon
reception of the SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall include in the corresponding HTTP
PATCH request:
\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
a) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
b) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\"; and
\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).
The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCF in the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation and should include this
access network information in the SIP message with the response confirmation
before forwarding it. When the retrieved access network information
corresponds to the \"tnapId\" or \"twapId\" attribute, the P-CSCF may also map
the retrieved access network information to a Geographical Identifier for
routing, as specified in clause E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [33].
## B.8.4 Retrieval of network provided location information at terminating
P-CSCF
If a terminating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve network
provided location information at session establishment and/or modification,
the P-CSCF shall apply the following procedures.
The terminating P-CSCF may request network provided location information upon
reception of a SIP INVITE request in the following manner:
\- if the SIP INVITE request is an initial SIP INVITE request, the P-CSCF
shall create a new \"Individual Application Session Context\" for the new SIP
session with the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation
according to clause 4.2.6.6 (if no session information is included) or with
the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation according to clause
4.2.2.14 (if preliminary session information is included);
\- if the SIP INVITE contains an SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall include in the
corresponding HTTP request:
a) an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
(i) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
(ii) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\";
b) the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information);
c) service information derived from the SDP offer; and
d) the \"servInfStatus\" attribute with the value set to \"PRELIMINARY\"; and
\- if the SIP INVITE does not contain an SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall include
in the corresponding HTTP request:
a) an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
(i) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
(ii) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\"; and
b) the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).
Upon reception of a SIP response that requires the inclusion of access network
information, if the P-CSCF has not already requested network provided location
information upon reception of the corresponding SIP INVITE request, the P-CSCF
shall request network provided location information in the following manner:
\- if an \"Individual Application Session Context\" related to service data
has not yet been created, the P-CSCF shall create an \"Individual Application
Session Context\" for the new SIP session with the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Subscribe service operation according to clause
4.2.6.6 (if no session information is included) or with the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create service operation according to clause 4.2.2.14
(if session information is included);
\- if the SIP response includes an SDP answer, the P-CSCF shall send an HTTP
request to the PCF according to clause B.1; the P-CSCF shall include in this
HTTP request:
a) an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
(i) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
(ii) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\"; and
b) the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information);
\- if the SIP response does not contain an SDP body, the P-CSCF shall include
in the corresponding HTTP request:
a) an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
(i) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
(ii) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\"; and
b) the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information); and
\- if the SIP response includes an SDP offer, the P-CSCF shall include in the
corresponding HTTP request:
\- a) an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
(i) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
(ii) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\";
b) the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information);
c) service information derived from the SDP offer; and
d) the \"servInfStatus\" attribute with the value set to \"PRELIMINARY\".
The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCF in the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation and should include this
access network information in the appropriate SIP response before forwarding
it. When the retrieved access network information corresponds to the
\"tnapId\" or \"twapId\" attribute, the P-CSCF may also map the retrieved
access network information to a Geographical Identifier for routing, as
specified in clause E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [33].
If the terminating P-CSCF is required by operator policy to retrieve network
provided location information upon reception of a SIP MESSAGE response, the
P-CSCF shall behave according to B.8.2.
## B.8.5 Provisioning of network provided location information at SIP session
release
If a P-CSCF is required by operator policy to include network provided
location information in SIP session release signalling, the P-CSCF shall apply
the following procedures:
Upon reception of a SIP session release request that requires the inclusion of
network provided location information, the P-CSCF will invoke the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation to the PCF according to
clause 4.2.4.6 and shall include in the HTTP request:
\- an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
a) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
b) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\"; and
\- the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information).
The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCF in the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Delete service operation according to clause 4.2.4.6
and shall include this access network information in the appropriate SIP
message before forwarding it. When the retrieved access network information
corresponds to the \"tnapId\" or \"twapId\" attribute, the P-CSCF may also map
the retrieved access network information to a Geographical Identifier for
routing, as specified in clause E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [33].
## B.8.6 Provisioning of network provided location information at mid call
If a P-CSCF is required by operator policy to include network provided
location information at mid call, the P-CSCF shall apply the following
procedures:
Upon reception of a trigger (e.g., when the P-CSCF learns about the access
change) that requires the inclusion of network provided location information
in a SIP message, the P-CSCF will invoke the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Update
and shall include in the corresponding HTTP request:
a) an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with:
(i) the \"event\" attribute set to the value \"ANI_REPORT\"; and
(ii) the \"notifMethod\" attribute set to the value \"ONE_TIME\";
b) the \"reqAnis\" attribute, with the required access network information,
i.e. user location and/or user time zone information);
c) service information related to the service according to clause 4.2.3.2.
The P-CSCF will receive the access network information from the PCF in the
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Notify service operation, and should include this
access network information in the appropriate SIP message before forwarding
it. When the retrieved access network information corresponds to the
\"tnapId\" or \"twapId\" attribute, the P-CSCF may also map the retrieved
access network information to a Geographical Identifier for routing, as
specified in clause E.8 of 3GPP TS 23.228 [33].
# B.9 Resource Sharing
The P-CSCF may indicate to the PCF that media of an \"Individual Application
Session Context\" resource may share resources with media belonging to other
\"Individual Application Session Context\" resources according to 3GPP TS
23.228 [33].
If the P-CSCF determines that resource sharing is possible, it may at creation
of a new \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource, include the
\"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute indicating that
media resources may be shared in the related direction. The P-CSCF shall
assign a distinct value for the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or
\"sharingKeyDl\" attribute for each media component within the
\"medComponents\" attribute.
NOTE 1: When resource sharing applies to both directions for a certain media
component, the P-CSCF can assign the same value for \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute
and \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute within the same media component.
The P-CSCF shall not include the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or
\"sharingKeyDl\" attribute within the media components in the
\"medComponents\" attribute when the \"Individual Application Session
Context\" resource relates to an Emergency Session.
The PCF shall not include the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or
\"sharingKeyDl\" attribute for those PCC/QoS Rules related to the RTCP
traffic.
Trigger conditions that require applying or stopping resource sharing are
described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [32].
NOTE 2: When P-CSCF needs to stop sharing according to the procedures
described in 3GPP TS 24.229 [32], the P-CSCF will provide \"null\" value for
the \"sharingKeyUl\" attribute and/or \"sharingKeyDl\" attribute within the
media component in the \"medComponents\" attribute.
# B.10 Handling of MCPTT priority call
## B.10.1 General
Within the framework of MCPTT, when the SIP Core (3GPP TS 24.379 [41]) is
implemented by an IMS core network, if the P-CSCF receives a SIP request
message including a Resource-Priority header field with a namespace field and
priority value defined for MCPTT for adjusting the priority of an MCPTT
session, the P-CSCF shall provide the \"resPrio\" attribute and the
\"mcpttId\" in the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request as defined in
clause B.13.2 to allow the PCF to set the corresponding PCC rule(s) according
to the prioritized MCPTT service. Additionally, if \"PrioritySharing\" feature
is supported, the P-CSCF may provide the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute within
the media component included in the \"medComponents\" attribute as described
in clause B.1. For MCPTT the service priority and the priority sharing
indicator are defined in 3GPP TS 24.379 [41].
NOTE 1: The process of adjusting priority may occur several times during the
course of one session, e.g. a normal MCPTT group call elevated to an MCPTT
emergency group call, returned to a normal priority MCPTT group call, elevated
to an MCPTT imminent peril group call and returned to a normal priority MCPTT
group call.
NOTE 2: Upon reception of a request that requires the adjustment of the MCPTT
priority, the PCF is expected to derive the PCC Rules corresponding to the
this MCPTT session, as appropriate according to operator policies.
NOTE 3: The PCF can identify an MCPTT call using the IMS Communication Service
Identifier specific to MCPTT, which is provided by the P-CSCF in the
\"afAppId\" attribute in the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request sent to
PCF.
## B.10.2 Determination of MCPTT priority parameter values
When the P-CSCF receives an authorized Resource-Priority header field
containing an appropriate namespace and priority value used for MCPTT in SIP
signalling, the P-CSCF shall include the \"mcpttId\" attribute and the
\"resPrio\" attribute in the corresponding Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service
operation towards the PCF.
The \"mcpttId\" attribute shall include the namespace defined for MCPTT as
received within the Resource-Priority header field.
NOTE: Two different values are defined for the MCPTT-Identifier AVP, one for
each namespace value defined for MCPTT (see IETF RFC 8101 [42]).
The \"resPrio\" attribute shall contain the priority value of the Resource-
Priority header; the lowest priority shall be mapped to PRIO_1 (Resource-
Priority header value 0), the next after the lowest to PRIO_2 (Resource-
Priority header value 1), and so on up to the highest priority which shall be
mapped to PRIO_16 (Resource-Priority header value 15).
Additionally, when the P-CSCF receives information about priority sharing from
an MCPTT server that supports simultaneous sessions and that needs to share a
common priority for several MCPTT sessions and if \"PrioritySharing\" feature
is supported, the P-CSCF may include the \"prioSharingInd\" attribute within
the media component received in the \"medComponents\" attribute in the
corresponding Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service operation. See 3GPP TS 24.379
[41] for further information.
# B.11 Handling of MCVideo priority call
## B.11.1 General
Within the framework of MCVideo, when the SIP Core (3GPP TS 23.281 [34]) is
implemented by an IMS core network, if the P-CSCF receives a SIP request
message including a Resource-Priority header field with a namespace field and
priority value defined for MCVideo for adjusting the priority of an MCVideo
session, the P-CSCF shall provide the \"resPrio\" attribute and the
\"mcVideoId\" in the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request as defined in
clause B.15.2 to allow the PCF to set the corresponding PCC rule(s) according
to the prioritized MCVideo service.
NOTE 1: The process of adjusting priority may occur several times during the
course of one session, e.g. a normal MCVideo group call elevated to an MCVideo
emergency group call and returned to a normal priority MCVideo group call,
elevated to an MCVideo imminent peril group call and returned to a normal
priority MCVideo group call.
NOTE 2: Upon reception of a request that requires the adjustment of the
MCVideo priority, the PCF is expected to derive the PCC Rules corresponding to
the this MCVideo session, as appropriate according to operator policies.
NOTE 3: The PCF can identify an MCVideo call using the IMS Communication
Service Identifier specific to MCVideo, which is provided by the P-CSCF in the
\"afAppId\" attribute in the Npcf_PolicyAuthorization_Create request sent to
PCF.
## B.11.2 Determination of MCVideo priority parameter values
When the P-CSCF receives an authorized Resource-Priority header field
containing an appropriate namespace and priority value used for MCVideo in SIP
signalling, the P-CSCF shall include the \"mcVideoId\" attribute and the
\"resPrio\" attribute in the corresponding Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service
operation towards the PCF.
The \"mcVideoId\" attribute shall include the namespace defined for MCVideo as
received within the Resource-Priority header field.
The \"resPrio\" attribute shall contain the priority value of the Resource-
Priority header; the lowest priority shall be mapped to PRIO_1 (Resource-
Priority header value 0), the next after the lowest to PRIO_2 (Resource-
Priority header value 1), and so on up to the highest priority which shall be
mapped to PRIO_16 (Resource-Priority header value 15).
# B.12 Notification Access Type Change
When the P-CSCF receives an initial SIP REGISTER message or a SIP INVITE
message from an attached UE, the P-CSCF may request from the PCF the
information about the access type the UE is attached to using the procedure
specified in clauses 4.2.2.2, 4.2.3.2 and 4.2.6.2.
NOTE 1: This procedure is not applicable for IMS registrations for Emergency
sessions.
NOTE 2: The P-CSCF can request information about the access type as part of
the SIP session setup when it is only interested in the related information
when the IMS session is ongoing.
If the P-CSCF requests information about the access type, the P-CSCF shall
also subscribe within the same Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service operation to
notifications for changes of the access type used by the UE. The P-CSCF shall
include an entry of the \"AfEventSubscription\" data type in the \"events\"
attribute with the \"event\" attribute set to the value
\"ACCESS_TYPE_CHANGE\".
When the P-CSCF receives from the PCF the access type:
\- in the subscription request response within the HTTP response; or
\- in the notification of access type change in an HTTP POST request from the
PCF,
the P-CSCF shall store the access type information received within the
\"accessType\" attribute and the RAT type information received within
\"ratType\" attribute and use the received information as per P-CSCF
procedures in 3GPP TS 24.229 [32].
The P-CSCF may receive subsequent notifications for changes of the access type
from the PCF according to clause 4.2.5.2. When the P-CSCF receives a
notification of the change of the access type used by the UE, the P-CSCF shall
store the new access type information and RAT type information and use the
received information as per P-CSCF procedures in 3GPP TS 24.229 [32].
NOTE 3: The subscription to receive information about the access type will be
cancelled when the corresponding Individual Application Session Context
resource is removed by the P-CSCF (i.e. when the UE is deâ€‘REGISTERED or the
related SIP call is released).
# B.13 Notification of PLMN Change
When the P-CSCF receives an initial SIP REGISTER message from an attached UE,
the P-CSCF may subscribe to notifications of PLMN changes corresponding to the
identity of the network (either a PLMN or an SNPN) where the UE is located
using the procedure specified in clauses 4.2.2.2, 4.2.3.2 and 4.2.6.2.
NOTE: For a UE located in an SNPN the SNPN Identifier consisting of the PLMN
Identifier and the NID is provided.
When the P-CSCF receives the subscription request response in an HTTP response
or the notification of PLMN change in an HTTP POST request from the PCF, the
P-CSCF shall store the PLMN Identifier and, if available, the NID received
within the \"plmnId\" attribute and use the received information as per P-CSCF
procedures in 3GPP TS 24.229 [32].
The P-CSCF shall cancel the subscription to notification for changes of the
PLMN used by the UE when the user is de-registered from the IM CN subsystem.
# B.14 Coverage and Handoff Enhancements using Multimedia error robustness
feature (CHEM)
As a network option, the P-CSCF may support the PCC procedures in the present
clause to handle the Coverage and Handoff Enhancements using Multimedia error
robustness feature (CHEM).
NOTE: When the CHEM feature is supported, improved error robustness might be
enabled by packet-loss handling procedures of the codec, codec mode, or codec
configuration to avoid, delay, or reduce the need to handoff a terminal due to
degradation in the media quality. Communicating the level of robustness of the
media to the network enables the eNB to use this information to determine a
threshold for when the terminal should be handed off to another cell, domain
(circuit-switched vs. packet-switched), or radio access technology.
When a session is initiated or modified the P-CSCF supporting the CHEM feature
shall derive the \"maxPacketLossRateDl\" attribute and \"maxPacketLossRateUl\"
attribute based on the PLR_adapt and maxe2e-PLR attribute values in both the
SDP offer and/or SDP answer to determine the maximum tolerable end-to-end PLR
budget distributed across the uplink and downlink in a media transport path as
described in 3GPP TS 29.513 [7] clause 7.2.3.
Upon reception of SDP offer and answer, the P-CSCF should check whether \"a=
PLR_adapt\" line is present in both SDP offer and answer to derive
\"maxPacketLossRateDl\" attribute and \"maxPacketLossRateUl\" attribute in
\"medComponents\" attribute else \"maxPacketLossRateDl\" and
\"maxPacketLossRateUl\" attributes are not included by the P-CSCF.
The originating P-CSCF should derive \"maxPacketLossRateDl\" attribute to the
maximum value of MaxPacketLossRateDl among all the RTP payload types. For each
RTP payload type MaxPacketLossRateDl is computed as described in 3GPP TS
29.513 [7] clause 7.2.3.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP offer then the MaxPacketLossRateDl for
a payload type is derived as value of maxe2e-PLR in the SDP offer minus maxUL-
PLR in the SDP answer if present else the MaxPacketLossRateDlis Â½ maxe2e-PLR
value present in the SDP offer.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP offer then the MaxPacketLossRateDl
for a payload type is derived from the default value in end-to-end Maximum
End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP payload type as
recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 [30]clause X.1.2 for application layer
redundancy or X.1.1 for partial redundancy minus maxUL-PLR in the SDP answer
if present else the MaxPacketLossRateDl Â½ default value in end-to-end Maximum
End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP payload type as
recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 [30] clause X.1.2 for application layer
redundancy or X.1.1 for partial redundancy.
The originating P-CSCF should derive \"maxPacketLossRateUl\" attribute to the
maximum value of MaxPacketLossRateUl among all the RTP payload types. For each
RTP payload type MaxPacketLossRateUl is computed as described in 3GPP TS
29.513 [7] clause 7.2.3.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP answer then the MaxPacketLossRateUl
for a payload type is derived as value of maxe2e-PLR in the SDP answer minus
maxDL-PLR in the SDP answer if present else the MaxPacketLossRateUl is Â½
maxe2e-PLR value present in the SDP answer.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP answer then the
MaxPacketLossRateUl for a payload type is derived as the Â½ default value in
end-to-end Maximum End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP
payload type as recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 [30] clause X.1.2 for
application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for partial redundancy.
The terminating P-CSCF should derive \"maxPacketLossRateDl\" attribute to the
maximum value of MaxPacketLossRateDl among all the RTP payload types. For each
RTP payload type MaxPacketLossRateDl is computed as described in 3GPP TS
29.513 [7] clause 7.2.3.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP answer then the MaxPacketLossRateDl
for a payload type is derived as value of maxDL-PLR in the SDP answer if
present else the MaxPacketLossRateDl is Â½ maxe2e-PLR value present in the SDP
answer.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP answer then the
MaxPacketLossRateDl for a payload type is derived as the Â½ default value in
end-to-end Maximum End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP
payload type as recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 [30] clause X.1.2 for
application layer redundancy or X.1.1 for partial redundancy.
The terminating P-CSCF should derive \"maxPacketLossRateUl\" attribute to the
maximum value of MaxPacketLossRateUl among all the RTP payload types. For each
RTP payload type MaxPacketLossRateUl is computed as described in 3GPP TS
29.513 [7] clause 7.2.3.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is included in the SDP offer then the MaxPacketLossRateUl for
a payload type is derived as value of maxUL-PLR in the SDP answer if present
else the MaxPacketLossRateUl is Â½ maxe2e-PLR value present in the SDP offer.
\- If maxe2e-PLR is not included in the SDP offer then the MaxPacketLossRateUl
for a payload type is derived as the Â½ default value in end-to-end Maximum
End-to-End Packet Loss Rate for the decoder of the RTP payload type as
recommended in 3GPP TS 26.114 [30] clause X.1.2 for application layer
redundancy or X.1.1 for partial redundancy.
# B.15 Handling of a FLUS session
If the P-CSCF receives a SIP request that requires provisioning of a service
information to the PCF, the \"FLUS\" feature is supported and an SDP attribute
\"a=label:flus...\" is included in one or more of the received SDP media
descriptions, the P-CSCF shall provide the string after \"a=label:\" starting
with \"flus\" within the \"flusId\" attribute for each affected media
components within the \"medComponents\" attribute in the corresponding
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service operation towards the PCF.
NOTE: During the first interaction with the PCF, the P-CSCF does not know if
the \"FLUS\" feature is supported by the PCF. In this case the P-CSCF will
include the information as if the feature is supported.
If additionally the P-CSCF receives the \"a=3gpp-qos-hint\" media-level SDP
attribute in the SIP request, the P-CSCF shall provide the PCF with the
\"desMaxLatency\" attribute and/or \"desMaxLoss\" attribute as described in
3GPP TS 29.513 [7], clause 7.2.3.
Upon receiving the information from the P-CSCF and if the \"FLUS\" feature is
supported, the PCF shall derive the QoS information as described in 3GPP TS
29.513 [7], clause 7.3.3.
# B.16 QoS hint support for data channel media
If the P-CSCF receives a SIP request that requires provisioning of a service
information to the PCF, the QoSHint feature is supported and an SDP attribute
\"a=3gpp-qos-hint\" is included in one or more of the received data channel
media descriptions, the P-CSCF may provide the \"desMaxLatency\" attribute
and/or \"desMaxLoss\" attribute for each affected application media component
within the \"medComponents\" attribute in the corresponding
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service operation towards the PCF.
NOTE: During the first interaction with the PCF, the P-CSCF does not know if
the QoSHint feature is supported by the PCF. In this case the P-CSCF will
include the information as if the feature is supported.
Upon receiving the information from the P-CSCF and if the QoSHint feature is
supported, the PCF shall derive the QoS information as described in 3GPP TS
29.513 [7], clause 7.3.3.
# B.17 Handling of MPS Session
When the P-CSCF receives an authorised Resource-Priority header field or when
the P-CSCF adds a temporarily authorised Resource-Priority header field
containing an appropriate namespace and priority value in SIP signaling, and
recognizes the need for priority treatment as specified in 3GPP TS 24.229
[32], and the \"IMS_SBI\" feature is supported, the P-CSCF shall include the
\"mpsId\" attribute and the \"resPrio\" attribute in the corresponding
Npcf_PolicyAuthorization service operation towards the PCF. The \"mpsId\"
attribute shall contain the national variant for MPS service name indicating
an MPS session. The \"resPrio\" attribute shall be determined based on the
resource value received in the \"wps\" namespace of the SIP Resource-Priority
header field, and shall be included at \"AppSessionContextReqData\" data type
level as well as the \"MediaComponent\" data type level. The \"resPrio\"
attribute shall be populated with a default value if the priority value is
unknown.
NOTE 1: Various mechanisms can be applied to recognize the need for priority
treatment in the P-CSCF (e.g., based on the dialled digits), according to
national regulation and network configuration, as stated in 3GPP TS 24.229
[32].
NOTE 2: Highest user priority level (lowest numerical resource value of the
SIP Resource-Priority header field) is mapped to the highest enumerated value
of the \"resPrio\" attribute.
If the P-CSCF supports the SBI Message Priority mechanism for an MPS session,
the P-CSCF shall include the \"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom HTTP header
with a priority value based on the value of the \"resPrio\" attribute. The
highest \"resPrio\" value is mapped to the corresponding lowest value of the
\"3gpp-Sbi-Message-Priority\" custom HTTP header.
Upon reception of a request that requires MPS treatment, the PCF shall derive
the PCC rules corresponding to the MPS session, as appropriate. The PCF shall
take specific actions on the corresponding PDU session to ensure that the MPS
session is prioritized, as described in 3GPP TS 29.512 [8], clause
4.2.6.2.12.3.
When the P-CSCF detects that the MPS session has ended, the P-CSCF deletes in
the PCF the \"Individual Application Session Context\" resource corresponding
to the MPS session. The PCF shall delete the PCC rules corresponding to the
MPS session and shall revoke the actions related to the prioritization of the
MPS session in the corresponding PDU session, as described in 3GPP TS 29.512
[8], clause 4.2.6.2.12.3.
