In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

(current geodetic and optionally local and/or civic location) for a target UE
or to request periodic or triggered location for a target UE.
### 5.2.2 Service Operations
#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction
The service operations defined for the Nlmf_Location service are as follows:
\- DetermineLocation: It provides UE location information to the consumer NF.
\- EventNotify: It notifies the consumer NF of an event for periodic or
triggered location for a target UE.
\- CancelLocation: It enables a consumer NF to cancel an ongoing periodic or
triggered location for a target UE.
\- LocationContextTransfer: It enables a consumer NF to transfer location
context information for periodic or triggered location of a target UE to a new
LMF.
#### 5.2.2.2 DetermineLocation
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
The following procedures are defined, using the \"DetermineLocation\" service
operation:
\- Retrieve UE Location
\- Retrieve UE Location for 5G-MO-LR
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Retrieve UE Location
This procedure allows a consumer NF to request the location information
(geodetic location and, optionally, local and/or civic location) for a target
UE or to activate periodic or triggered deferred location for a target UE.
Figure 5.2.2.2.2-1: DetermineLocation Request
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the resource
URI associated with the \"determine-location\" custom operation. The input
parameters for the request (external client type, LCS correlation identifier,
serving cell identifier, location QoS, supported GAD shapes, LDR Type, H-GMLC
address, LDR Reference, UE connectivity state per access type, TNAP
identifier, TWAP identifier, scheduled location time, integrity requirements,
....) may be included in the HTTP POST request body;
If UE geographical area identified by the country, area within a country or
international area needs to be determined, the NF Service Consumer shall
include UE geographical area determination for PLMN selection verification
indication in the request;
If UE LCS Capability is received in the request indicating LPP is not
supported by the UE, the LMF shall not send LPP messages to the UE in
subsequent positioning procedures.
2a. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned. The response body shall contain
the parameters related to the determined position of the UE if any (geodetic
position, local location, civic location, positioning methods...);
If the NF service consumer has requested to determine UE country, area within
a country or international area, the LMF shall also include ueAreaInd.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.4.2.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body should
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application error listed in Table 6.1.4.2.2-2.
##### 5.2.2.2.3 Retrieve UE Location for 5G-MO-LR
This procedure allows a consumer NF (i.e. an AMF) to request the location
information or location assistance data for a target UE which initiates MO-LR
procedure (see 3GPP TS 23.273 [19]).
Figure 5.2.2.2.3-1: DetermineLocation Request for 5G-MO-LR
The same requirements in clause 5.2.2.2.2 shall be applied with following
modifications:
1\. Same as step 1 of figure 5.2.2.2.2-1, the request body shall include the
following additional information:
\- The indication received from UE indicating whether a location estimate or
location assistance data is required.
\- The LPP messages if received in MO-LR Request from UE
\- UE\'s subscribed assistance data for 5GC-MO-LR if received from UDM.
2a. Same as step 2a of figure 5.2.2.2.2-1 if a consumer NF requests the
location information for a target UE. If a NF consumer requests location
assistance data for a target UE and LMF has successfully delivered location
assistance data to the UE, 204 No Content shall be returned.
2b. Same as step 2b of figure 5.2.2.2.2-1.
#### 5.2.2.3 EventNotify
##### 5.2.2.3.1 General
The following procedures are defined, using the \"EventNotify\" service
operation:
\- Periodic or Triggered Event Notification
##### 5.2.2.3.2 Periodic or Triggered Event Notification
This procedure notifies the NF Service Consumer (i.e. GMLC) about event
information related to periodic or triggered location of a target UE. The
notification is delivered to:
\- the callback URI of an H-GMLC received (from an AMF) during an earlier
DetermineLocation service operation if still available and if the LMF is
configured for direct access to the H-GMLC;
\- the callback URI of an H-GMLC received (from another LMF) during an earlier
LocationContextTransfer service operation if still available and if the LMF is
configured for direct access to the H-GMLC;
\- the callback URI of an H-GMLC received (from the target UE) in a
supplementary services event report if the LMF is configured for direct access
to the H-GMLC;
otherwise (if not available),
\- the callback URI of a V-GMLC registered in the NRF, if the V-GMLC
registered to the NRF with notification endpoints for periodic or triggered
event notifications; or
otherwise (if not available),
\- the URI of a V-GMLC locally provisioned in the LMF.
Figure 5.2.2.3.2-1: EventNotify Request
1\. The LMF shall send a POST request to the GMLC callback URI determined as
described above. The request body shall include a notification correlation ID
(LDR reference), the UE identification (SUPI and if available GPSI), the type
of event and may include a geodetic location, local location, civic location,
position methods used, and other available parameters related to the position
if any (e.g. Velocity, Altitude etc.), H-GMLC callback URI (if the NF consumer
is a V-GMLC) and serving LMF identification.
2a. On success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the NF Service
Consumer.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the appropriate HTTP status code listed
in Table 6.1.5.1.3.1-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message
body should contain a ProblemDetails structure indicating appropriate
additional error information.
#### 5.2.2.4 CancelLocation
##### 5.2.2.4.1 General
The following procedures are defined, using the \"CancelLocation\" service
operation:
\- Cancel Periodic or Triggered Location
##### 5.2.2.4.2 Cancel Periodic or Triggered Location
This procedure allows a consumer NF to cancel periodic or triggered location
for a target UE. The cancellation is delivered to a resource URI on the
serving LMF identified by the serving LMF identification provided to the
consumer NF (i.e. AMF) by a V-GMLC or H-GMLC (see 3GPP TS 23.273 [19]).
Figure 5.2.2.4.2-1: CancelLocation Request
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the resource
URI of \"cancel-location\" custom operation on the serving LMF. The request
body shall include a notification correlation ID (LDR reference) and an H-GMLC
callback URI.
2a. On success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the LMF.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.4.3.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body should
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application errors listed in Table 6.1.4.3.2-2.
#### 5.2.2.5 LocationContextTransfer
##### 5.2.2.5.1 General
The following procedures are defined, using the \"LocationContextTransfer\"
service operation:
\- Transfer Location Context
##### 5.2.2.5.2 Transfer Location Context
This procedure allows a NF service consumer (e.g. the old LMF) to transfer
location context information for periodic or triggered location for a target
UE (see clause 6.4 and clause 6.7.2 of 3GPP TS 23.273 [19]). The NF service
consumer discovers the service URI of the new LMF by performing a discovery
via NRF using:
\- the identification of the LMF received (from an AMF) during an earlier
Namf_Communication_N1MessageNotify service operation to the consumer NF;
otherwise (if not available),
\- the identification of an LMF locally provisioned in the consumer NF.
Figure 5.2.2.5.2-1: LocationContextTransfer Request
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the Custom
operation URI (\"/location-context-transfer\") on the Service URI discovered
as described above. The request body shall include an AMF identity, Deferred
location type, Deferred location parameters, Notification Target Address
(H-GMLC callback URI), Notification Correlation ID (LDR reference), an
embedded event report message and may include an event reporting status, UE
location information and scheduled location time, and shall include an
indication of Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation if N1 message is received
from the UE with Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation.
2a. On success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the LMF.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status codes listed in Table
6.1.4.4.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body should
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application error listed in Table 6.1.4.4.2-2.
## 5.3 Nlmf_Broadcast Service
### 5.3.1 Service Description
The Nlmf_Broadcast service enables an NF to obtain ciphering keys and
associated parameters applicable to location assistance data that is broadcast
to subscribed UEs in ciphered form.
### 5.3.2 Service Operations
#### 5.3.2.1 Introduction
The service operations defined for the Nlmf_Broadcast service are as follows:
\- CipheringKeyData: It provides the ciphering key information to the consumer
NF.
#### 5.3.2.2 CipheringKeyData
##### 5.3.2.2.1 General
The following procedures are defined, using the \"CipheringKeyData\" service
operation:
\- Request Ciphering Key Information
\- Provide Ciphering Key Information
NOTE: The Request Ciphering Key procedure is included in order to provide a
valid context in OpenAPI version 3 for the Provide Ciphering Key Information
procedure. The Request Ciphering Key procedure is not used for support of
ciphering key transfer in 3GPP TS 23.273 [19] and hence need not be supported
by an NF Service Consumer or by an LMF.
##### 5.3.2.2.2 Request Ciphering Key Information
This procedure allows a consumer NF to request ciphering key information.
Figure 5.3.2.2.2-1: CipheringKeyData Request
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send an HTTP POST request to the resource
URI associated with the \"cipher-key-data\" custom operation. The request body
shall include a notification callback URI.
2a. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned. The response body shall indicate
whether the LMF has ciphering key data. If the LMF has ciphering key data, the
Provide Ciphering Key Information procedure is used to provide the ciphering
key data to the NF Service Consumer.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status codes listed in Table
6.2.4.4.2-2 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body shall
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application errors listed in Table 6.2.7.3-1.
##### 5.3.2.2.3 Provide Ciphering Key Information
This procedure notifies the NF Service Consumer (i.e. AMF) about updated
ciphering key information applicable to broadcast of location assistance data
in ciphered form to subscribed UEs. The notification is delivered to:
\- the callback URI of an AMF received during an earlier CipheringKeyData
request service operation if still available; or
\- a callback URI registered in the NRF, if the AMF registered to the NRF with
notification endpoints for ciphering key data notifications;
Otherwise (if not available),
\- an AMF callback URI locally provisioned in the LMF.
The procedure is invoked by issuing a POST request to the callback URI of the
NF Service Consumer. See figure 5.3.2.2.3-1.
Figure 5.3.2.2.3-1: CipheringKeyData Notify
1\. The LMF shall send an HTTP POST request to the callback URI for the NF
service consumer determined as described above. The request body shall include
one or more ciphering keys and for each ciphering key may include a ciphering
key value, ciphering key identifier, validity period and set of applicable
types of broadcast assistance data.
2a. On success or partial success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned. The response
body shall indicate which ciphering key information was successfully stored by
the NF service consumer.
2b. On failure or redirection to store any ciphering key information, one of
the HTTP status codes listed in table 6.2.5.1.3.1-2 shall be returned. For a
4xx/5xx response, the message body shall contain a ProblemDetails structure
with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of the application errors listed in
table 6.2.5.1.3.1-2.

Table 6.1.2.2.2-1: 3GPP vendor specific content subtypes
* * *
content subtype Description vnd.3gpp.lpp Binary encoded payload, encoding LTE
Positioning Protocol (LPP) IEs, as specified in 3GPP TS 37.355 [21]. NOTE:
Using 3GPP vendor content subtypes allows to describe the nature of the opaque
payload (e.g. LPP information) without having to rely on metadata in the JSON
payload.
* * *
See clause 6.1.2.4 for the binary payloads supported in the binary body part
of multipart messages.
#### 6.1.2.3 HTTP custom headers
##### 6.1.2.3.1 General
The following HTTP custom headers shall be supported:

HTTP multipart messages shall be supported, to transfer opaque LPP
Information, in the following service operations (and HTTP messages):
\- DetermineLocation Request (POST);
HTTP multipart messages shall include one JSON body part and one or more
binary body parts comprising:
\- one LPP payload (see clause 6.1.6.4).
The JSON body part shall be the \"root\" body part of the multipart message.
It shall be encoded as the first body part of the multipart message. The
\"Start\" parameter does not need to be included.
The multipart message shall include a \"type\" parameter (see IETF RFC 2387
[9]) specifying the media type of the root body part, i.e.
\"application/json\".
NOTE: The \"root\" body part (or \"root\" object) is the first body part the
application processes when receiving a multipart/related message, see IETF RFC
2387 [9]. The default root is the first body within the multipart/related
message. The \"Start\" parameter indicates the root body part, e.g. when this
is not the first body part in the message.
For each binary body part in a HTTP multipart message, the binary body part
shall include a Content-ID header (see IETF RFC 2045 [10]), and the JSON body
part shall include an attribute, defined with the RefToBinaryData type, that
contains the value of the Content-ID header field of the referenced binary
body part.

normally used for mutually exclusive alternatives) is used for GeographicArea
type in yaml file to avoid validation failure of OpenAPI. According to current
definition, a PointUncertaintyCircle object will always pass the validation
with both PointUncertaintyCircle and Point, which fails the qualification of
\"oneOf\" keyword.

### 6.1.8 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [9], the access to the Nlmf_Location API may be
authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [10]), using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510
[11]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If Oauth2 authorization is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming
services offered by the Nlmf_Location API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [11], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nlmf_Location service.
The Nlmf_Location API defines scopes for OAuth2 authorization as specified in
3GPP TS 33.501 [9]; it defines a single scope consisting on the name of the
service (i.e., \"nlmf-loc\"), and it does not define any additional scopes at
resource or operation level.
### 6.1.9 Feature Negotiation
The optional features in table 6.1.9-1 are defined for the Nlmf_Location API.
They shall be negotiated using the extensibility mechanism defined in clause
6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].

### 6.1.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different LMF service instance, within
the same LMF or a different LMF of an LMF set, e.g. when an LMF service
instance is part of an LMF (service) set or when using indirect communications
(see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). See also the ES3XX feature in clause 6.1.9.
An SCP that reselects a different LMF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new LMF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an LMF within an LMF set redirects a service request to a different LMF of
the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code,
the identity of the new LMF towards which the service request is redirected
shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary
Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
## 6.2 Nlmf_Broadcast Service API
### 6.2.1 API URI
The Nlmf_Broadcast service shall use the Nlmf_Broadcast API.
The API URI of the Nlmf_Broadcast API shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\**
The request URI used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards the
NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in clause
4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].

the same LMF or a different LMF of an LMF set, e.g. when an LMF service
instance is part of an LMF (service) set or when using indirect communications
(see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). See also the ES3XX feature in clause 6.2.9.
An SCP that reselects a different LMF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new LMF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an LMF within an LMF set redirects a service request to a different LMF of
the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status code,
the identity of the new LMF towards which the service request is redirected
shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307 Temporary
Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause 6.10.9.1 of
3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the Nlmf Service APIs. It
consists of an OpenAPI 3.0.0 specification, in YAML format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository, that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1
and 3GPP TR 21.900 [7] clause 5B).
