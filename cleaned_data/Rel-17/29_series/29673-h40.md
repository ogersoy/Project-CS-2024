The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

### 5.2.2 Service Operations
#### 5.2.2.1 Introduction
See Table 5.2.1-1 for an overview of the service operations supported by the
Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement service.
#### 5.2.2.2 Service Operation Resolve
##### 5.2.2.2.1 General
The Resolve service operation shall be used to retrieve UE Radio Access
Capability Information from a dictionary entry stored in the UCMF, by a NF
service consumer, e.g. an AMF, when:
\- it has received an unknown UE Radio Capability ID, which is either
Manufacturer-assigned or PLMN-assigned;
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF) shall retrieve UE Radio Access Capability
Information by using the HTTP GET method as shown in Figure 5.2.2.2.1-1.
Figure: 5.2.2.2.1-1 Retrieve UE Radio Access Capability Information
1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. an AMF, shall send an HTTP GET request to
the resource URI Dictionary Entries collection resource. The query parameters
are a Manufacturer-assigned or a PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID, and the
Coding format (e.g. 5GS or EPS) in which UE Radio Access Capability
Information needs to be provided.
2a. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned. The response body shall contain
UE Radio Access Capability Information in the requested Coding format stored
in the dictionary entry that is matching the UE Radio Capability ID in query,
and may contain a PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID if the query parameter
is a Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID and if the PLMN-assigned UE
Radio Capability ID mechanism is used in the network.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.3.3.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.3.3.2-2, where applicable.
##### 5.2.2.2.2 Retrieve a Dictionary Entry
The Resolve service operation may be used to retrieve a dictionary entry
stored in the UCMF, by a NF service consumer, e.g. an AMF, when it has the
Dictionary Entry ID available.
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF) shall retrieve a Dictionary Entry by using
the HTTP GET method as shown in Figure 5.2.2.2.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.2.1-1 Retrieve a dictionary entry
1\. The NF Service Consumer, e.g. an AMF, shall send an HTTP GET request to an
individual Dictionary Entry resource. The query parameter is the Coding Format
(e.g. 5GS or EPS) in which UE Radio Access Capability Information needs to be
provided.
2a. On success, \"200 OK\" shall be returned. The response body shall the
dictionary entry information for the given Dictionary Entry ID.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.3.3.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.3.3.2-3, where applicable.
#### 5.2.2.3 Service Operation Assign
The Assign service operation shall be used by the service consumer NF (e.g.
AMF) to obtain a PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID from the UCMF for a
specific UE radio access capability information. The UCMF shall create a new
dictionary entry and assign a PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID unless such
dictionary entry already exists and a PLMN-assigned UE Radio Capability ID has
already been assigned to the given UE radio access capability information in
the UCMF. The NF service consumer, e.g. an AMF, may consume the service by
providing the UE Radio Access Capability Information retrieved from the UE,
and Type Allocation Code of PEI of the UE, e.g. when it hasn\'t received any
UE Radio Capability ID.
The NF Service Consumer (e.g. AMF) shall obtain the PLMN Assigned UE Radio
Capability ID by using the HTTP POST method as shown in Figure 5.2.2.3.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.3-1 Create a dictionary entry
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to the resource
representing the Dictionary Entries collection resource of the UCMF. The
payload body of the POST request shall contain:
\- the UE Radio Access Capability Information for the current radio
configuration of the UE in 5GS format, or EPS format, or both the formats;
\- the Type Allocation Code of the PEI of the UE.
2a. On success, the UCMF shall check whether for the provided input a
dictionary entry already exists and a PLMN Assigned UE Radio Capability ID has
already been assigned. If so \"201 Created\" shall be returned, the payload
body of the POST response shall contain already assigned PLMN Assigned UE
Radio Capability ID included in DicEntryCreatedData and the \"Location\"
header shall be present and shall contain the URI of the already existing
resource. Otherwise a new dictionary entry shall be created and \"201
Created\" shall be returned, the payload body of the POST response shall
contain the newly assigned PLMN Assigned UE Radio Capability ID included in
DicEntryCreatedData and the \"Location\" header shall be present and shall
contain the URI of the newly created resource.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.2.3.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.3.3.2-2, where applicable. A UCMF
configured to operate in Mode of Operation A (3GPPP TS 23.501, Clause
5.4.4.1a) shall reject the operation if the request does not contain UE Radio
Access Capability Information in both the formats and the UCMF is not able to
find match of the received UE Radio Access Capability Information in its
database.
#### 5.2.2.4 Service Operation Subscribe
##### 5.2.2.4.1 General
The Subscribe service operation shall be used by a NF Service Consumer, e.g.
an AMF, to create a subscription in the UCMF, to get notifications for one or
more new dictionary entries creation or for the deletion of one or more PLMN
Assigned UE Radio Capability IDs.
The NF Service Consumer shall request to create a new subscription by using
HTTP method POST with URI of the subscriptions collection, see clause 6.1.3.4.
A ucmfNotificationUri shall be provided in the CreateSubscription to be used
by the UCMF to send notifications later. See Figure 5.2.2.4.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.4.1-1 Create a subscription
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a POST request to create a subscription
resource in the UCMF. The payload body of the POST request shall contain a
representation of the individual subscription resource to be created. The
request may contain an expiry time, suggested by the NF Service Consumer as a
hint, representing the time upto which the subscription is desired to be kept
active and the time after which the subscribed event(s) shall stop generating
report.
2a. On success, the request is accepted, the UCMF shall include a HTTP
Location header to provide the location of a newly created resource
(subscription) together with the status code 201 indicating the requested
resource is created in the response message. The UCMF may also include the
highest dictionary entry ID which has been allocated.
The response, based on operator policy and taking into account the expiry time
included in the request, may contain the expiry time, as determined by the
UCMF, after which the subscription becomes invalid. Once the subscription
expires, if the NF Service Consumer wants to keep receiving notifications, it
shall create a new subscription in the UCMF. The UCMF shall not provide the
same expiry time for many subscriptions in order to avoid all of them expiring
and recreating the subscription at the same time. If the expiry time is not
included in the response, the NF Service Consumer shall consider the
subscription to be valid without an expiry time.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.4.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application errors listed in Table 6.1.3.4.3.1-3.
#### 5.2.2.5 Unsubscribe
##### 5.2.2.5.1 General
The Unsubscribe service operation is used by a NF Service Consumer, e.g. AMF,
towards the UCMF, to remove an existing subscription previously created by
itself at the UCMF.
The NF Service Consumer shall unsubscribe to the subscription by using HTTP
method DELETE with the URI of the individual subscription resource (see clause
6.1.3.5) to be deleted. See Figure 5.2.2.5.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.5.1-1 Unsubscribe a subscription
1\. The NF Service Consumer shall send a DELETE request to delete an existing
subscription resource in the UCMF.
2a. On success, the request is accepted, the UCMF shall reply with the status
code 204 indicating the resource identified by subscription ID is successfully
deleted in the response message.
2b. On failure or redirection, one of the HTTP status code listed in Table
6.1.3.5.3.2-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message body may
contain a ProblemDetails structure with the \"cause\" attribute set to one of
the application error listed in Table 6.1.3.5.3.2-3.
#### 5.2.2.6 Notify
##### 5.2.2.6.1 General
The Notify service operation is used by the UCMF, to send a notification,
towards the notification URI, when certain event included in the subscription
has taken place.
The UCMF shall use the HTTP method POST, using the notification URI received
in the subscription creation as specified in clause 5.2.2.4.1. See Figure
5.2.2.6.1-1.
Figure 5.2.2.6.1-1 Notify
1\. The AMF shall send a POST request to send a notification.
2a. On success, \"204 No content\" shall be returned by the NF Service
Consumer.
2b. On failure or redirection, the appropriate HTTP status code listed in
Table 6.1.5.2.3.1-3 shall be returned. For a 4xx/5xx response, the message
body may contain appropriate additional error information.

type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7807 [13].
Multipart messages shall also be supported (see clause 6.1.2.4) using the
content type \"multipart/related\", comprising:
\- one JSON body part with the \"application/json\" content type; and
\- one or more binary body parts with 3gpp vendor specific content subtypes.
The 3gpp vendor specific content subtypes defined in Table 6.1.2.2.2-1 shall
be supported.
Table 6.1.2.2.2-1: 3GPP vendor specific content subtypes
* * *
content subtype Description vnd.3gpp.ngap Binary encoded payload, encoding NG
Application Protocol (NGAP) IEs, as specified in clause 9.3 of 3GPP TS 38.413
[15] (ASN.1 encoded). vnd.3gpp.s1ap Binary encoded payload, encoding S1
Application Protocol (S1AP) IEs, as specified in clause 9.2 of 3GPP TS 36.413
[17] (ASN.1 encoded). NOTE: Using 3GPP vendor content subtypes allows to
describe the nature of the opaque payload (e.g. NGAP or 5GS NAS information)
without having to rely on metadata in the JSON payload.
* * *
See clause 6.1.2.4 for the binary payloads supported in the binary body part
of multipart messages.
#### 6.1.2.3 HTTP custom headers
The mandatory HTTP custom header fields specified in clause 5.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4] shall be applicable.
#### 6.1.2.4 HTTP multipart messages
HTTP multipart messages shall be supported to transfer opaque UE Radio Access
Capability Information, in the following service operations (and HTTP
messages):
\- Resolve Response (GET Response);
\- Assign Request (POST);
HTTP multipart message shall include one JSON body part and one or more binary
body parts comprising the OCTET STRING of the UE Radio Capability IE (i.e.
excluding the IEI, Criticality and octet string length indicator, see also
Annex B of 3GPP TS 29.274 [16]) as specified in clause 9.3.1.74 of 3GPP TS
38.413 [15]) and clause 9.2.1.27 of 3GPP TS 36.413 [17], or the UE Radio

The JSON body part shall be the \"root\" body part of the multipart message.
It shall be encoded as the first body part of the multipart message. The
\"Start\" parameter does not need to be included.
The multipart message shall include a \"type\" parameter (see IETF RFC 2387
[10]) specifying the media type of the root body part, i.e.
\"application/json\".
NOTE: The \"root\" body part (or \"root\" object) is the first body part the
application processes when receiving a multipart/related message, see IETF RFC
2387 [10]. The default root is the first body within the multipart/related
message. The \"Start\" parameter indicates the root body part, e.g. when this
is not the first body part in the message.
For each binary body part in a HTTP multipart message, the binary body part
shall include a Content-ID header (see IETF RFC 2045 [12]), and the JSON body
part shall include an attribute, defined with the RefToBinaryData type, that
contains the value of the Content-ID header field of the referenced binary

### 6.1.7 Error Handling
#### 6.1.7.1 General
For the Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement API, HTTP error responses shall be
supported as specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]. Protocol errors
and application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]
shall be supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes
are specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement API.
#### 6.1.7.2 Protocol Errors
No specific procedures for the Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement service are
specified.
#### 6.1.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement service
are listed in Table 6.1.7.3-1.
Table 6.1.7.3-1: Application errors
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
NO_DICTIONARY_ENTRY_FOUND 404 There is no dictionary entry matching the UE
Radio Capability ID in query. OUT_DATED_VERSION_ID_IN_RAC_ID 404 The version
id in the requested PLMN Assigned UE Radio Capability Id is out-dated.
### 6.1.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features in table 6.1.8-1 are defined for the
Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement API. They shall be negotiated using the
extensibility mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.1.8-1: Supported Features
+----------------+--------------+-----+----------------------+ | Feature number | Feature Name | M/O | Description | +================+==============+=====+======================+ | 1 | ES3XX | M | Extended Support of | | | | | HTTP 307/308 | | | | | redirection | | | | | | | | | | An NF Service | | | | | Consumer (e.g. AMF) | | | | | that supports this | | | | | feature shall | | | | | support handling of | | | | | HTTP 307/308 | | | | | redirection for any | | | | | service operation of | | | | | the | | | | | UE | | | | | CapabilityManagement | | | | | service. An NF | | | | | Service Consumer | | | | | that does not | | | | | support this feature | | | | | does only support | | | | | HTTP redirection as | | | | | specified for 3GPP | | | | | Release 15. | +----------------+--------------+-----+----------------------+
### 6.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2
protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510
[10]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement service.
The Nucmf_UECapabilityManagement API defines a single scope
\"nucmf_uecapabilitymanagement\" for the entire service, and it does not
define any additional scopes at resource or operation level.
### 6.1.10 HTTP redirection
An HTTP request may be redirected to a different UCMF service instance, within
the same UCMF or a different UCMF of an UCMF set, e.g. when an UCMF service
instance is part of an UCMF (service) set or when using indirect
communications (see 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]). See also the ES3XX feature in clause
6.1.8.
An SCP that reselects a different UCMF producer instance will return the NF
Instance ID of the new UCMF producer instance in the 3gpp-Sbi-Producer-Id
header, as specified in clause 6.10.3.4 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
If an UCMF within an UCMF set redirects a service request to a different UCMF
of the set using an 307 Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect status
code, the identity of the new UCMF towards which the service request is
redirected shall be indicated in the 3gpp-Sbi-Target-Nf-Id header of the 307
Temporary Redirect or 308 Permanent Redirect response as specified in clause
6.10.9.1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the
present specification. It consists of OpenAPI 3.0.0 specifications in YAML
format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE : The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository, that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1
and 3GPP TR 21.900 [7] clause 5B).
