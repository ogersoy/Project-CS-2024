In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

resource from the MBSF.
Figure 5.3.2.3.2-1: MBS User Data Ingest Session Retrieval procedure
1\. In order to retrieve the properties of an existing MBS User Data Ingest
Session, the NF service consumer (e.g. AF, NEF) shall send an HTTP GET request
message targeting the corresponding \"Individual MBS User Data Ingest
Session\" resource.
If the MBSF determines that the received HTTP GET request message needs to be
redirected, the MBSF shall respond with an HTTP redirect response as specified
in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
2\. Upon success, the MBSF shall respond with an HTTP \"200 OK\" status code
with the response body containing a representation of the requested
\"Individual MBS User Data Ingest Session\" resource within the
MBSUserDataIngSession data structure.
On failure, the MBSF shall take proper error handling actions, as specified in
clause 6.2.7, and respond to the NF service consumer with an appropriate error
status code.
#### 5.3.2.4 Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession_Update service operation
##### 5.3.2.4.1 General
This service operation is used by the NF service consumer to request the
update of an existing MBS User Data Ingest Session and potentially also its
set of subordinate MBS Distribution Session(s) at the MBSF.
The following procedures are supported by the
\"Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession_Update\" service operation:
\- MBS User Data Ingest Session Update.
##### 5.3.2.4.2 MBS User Data Ingest Session Update
Figure 5.3.2.4.2-1 depicts a scenario where an NF service consumer requests
the update or modification of an existing \"Individual MBS User Data Ingest
Session\" resource at the MBSF.
Figure 5.3.2.4.2-1: MBS User Data Ingest Session Update procedure
1\. In order to request the update or modification of an existing MBS User
Data Ingest Session and potentially also its set of subordinate MBS
Distribution Session(s), the NF service consumer (e.g. AF, NEF) shall send an
HTTP PUT or PATCH request message targeting the corresponding \"Individual MBS
User Data Ingest Session\" resource, with the request body containing the
MBSUserDataIngSession data structure (for an HTTP PUT request) or the
MBSUserDataIngSessionPatch data structure (for an HTTP PATCH request).
The attributes that may be updated/modified at any time are as follows:
\- the set(s) of active period(s) of the MBS User Data Ingest Session, within
the \"actPeriods\" attribute; and
\- within each map entry of the \"mbsDisSessInfos\" attribute encoded using
the MBSDistributionSessionInfo data structure (for an HTTP PUT request) or the
MBSUserDataIngSessionPatch data structure (for an HTTP PATCH request):
\- the MBS Service Information, within the \"mbsServInfo\" attribute;
\- the MBS Frequency Selection Area (FSA) Identifier, for a broadcast service
type, within the \"mbsFSAId\" attribute; and
\- the target service area(s), within the \"tgtServAreas\" attribute.
The other attributes, except for the \"mbsSessionId\", the \"mbsDisSessionId\"
and the \"locationDependent\" attributes, which shall never be updated after
being provisioned, all the other attributes within each map entry of the
\"mbsDisSessInfos\" attribute encoded using the MBSDistributionSessionInfo
data structure (for an HTTP PUT request) or the MBSUserDataIngSessionPatch
data structure (for an HTTP PATCH request) may be updated only if the
corresponding MBS Distribution Session is in the \"INACTIVE\" state.
As part of an MBS User Data Ingest Session update/modification procedure, the
AF may also add new MBS Distribution Session(s) and/or remove existing MBS
Distribution Session(s). In order to do so:
\- if a new MBS Distribution Session shall be created, the AF shall include
its properties encoded using the MBSDistributionSessionInfo data structure as
a new map entry within the \"mbsDisSessInfos\" attribute with a newly assigned
string-based map key that shall be unique within the scope of the parent MBS
User Data Ingest Session; and
\- if an existing MBS Distribution Session shall be deleted, the AF shall
include the corresponding map entry set to the value \"NULL\" within the
\"mbsDisSessInfos\" attribute with the map key set to its string-based map key
provisioned during the request that initially created the MBS Distribution
Session.
If the MBSF determines that the received HTTP PUT or PATCH request needs to be
redirected, the MBSF shall respond with an HTTP redirect response, as

For the Nmbsf_MBSUserService API, HTTP error responses shall be supported as
specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]. Protocol errors and application
errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] shall be supported
for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes are specified as
mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Nmbsf_MBSUserService API.
#### 6.1.7.2 Protocol Errors

### 6.1.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nmbsf_MBSUserService API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol
(see IETF RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the \"Client
Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510 [10])
plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nmbsf_MBSUserService API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nmbsf_MBSUserService service.
The Nmbsf_MBSUserService API defines a single scope \"nmbsf-mbs-us\" for the
entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource or
operation level.
## 6.2 Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession Service API
### 6.2.1 Introduction
The Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession service shall use the
Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession API.
The API URI of the Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession Service shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\**
The request URIs used in HTTP requests from the NF service consumer towards
the NF service producer shall have the Resource URI structure defined in
clause 4.4.1 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5], i.e.:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
with the following components:
\- The {apiRoot} shall be set as described in 3GPP TS 29.501 [5].
\- The \ shall be \"nmbsf-mbs-ud-ingest\".
\- The \ shall be \"v1\".
\- The \ shall be set as described in clause
6.2.3.
### 6.2.2 Usage of HTTP
#### 6.2.2.1 General
HTTP/2, IETF RFC 7540 [11], shall be used as specified in clause 5 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
The OpenAPI [6] specification of HTTP messages and content bodies for the
Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession API is contained in Annex A.3.

##### 6.2.2.2.1 General
See clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4] for the usage of HTTP standard headers.
##### 6.2.2.2.2 Content type
JSON, IETF RFC 8259 [12], shall be used as content type of the HTTP bodies
specified in the present specification as specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4]. The use of the JSON format shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/json\".
JSON object used in the HTTP PATCH request shall be encoded according to
\"JSON Merge Patch\" and shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/merge-patch+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7396 [22].

### 6.2.7 Error Handling
#### 6.2.7.1 General
For the Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession API, HTTP error responses shall be
supported as specified in clause 4.8 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [5]. Protocol errors
and application errors specified in table 5.2.7.2-1 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4]
shall be supported for an HTTP method if the corresponding HTTP status codes
are specified as mandatory for that HTTP method in table 5.2.7.1-1 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [4].
In addition, the requirements in the following clauses are applicable for the
Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession API.
#### 6.2.7.2 Protocol Errors
No specific procedures for the Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession service are
specified.
#### 6.2.7.3 Application Errors
The application errors defined for the Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession service
are listed in Table 6.2.7.3-1.
Table 6.2.7.3-1: Application errors
Application Error HTTP status code Description
* * *
### 6.2.8 Feature negotiation
The optional features listed in table 6.2.8-1 are defined for the
Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession API. They shall be negotiated using the
extensibility mechanism defined in clause 6.6 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
Table 6.2.8-1: Supported Features
Feature number Feature Name Description
* * *
### 6.2.9 Security
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [8] and 3GPP TS 29.500 [4], the access to the
Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession API may be authorized by means of the OAuth2
protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [9]), based on local configuration, using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP TS 29.510
[10]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth2 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services offered
by the Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [10], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession service.
The Nmbsf_MBSUserDataIngestSession API defines a single scope \"nmbsf-mbs-ud-
ingest\" for the entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes
at resource or operation level.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex specifies the formal definition of the API(s) defined in the
present specification. It consists of OpenAPI specifications in YAML format.
This Annex takes precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE 1: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see 3GPP TS 29.501 [5] clause 5.3.1
and 3GPP TR 21.900 [7] clause 5B).
