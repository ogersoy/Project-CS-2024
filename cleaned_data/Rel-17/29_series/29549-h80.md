# 6 SEAL Design Aspects Common for All APIs
## 6.1 General
SEAL APIs allow secure access to the capabilities provided by SEAL.
This document specifies the procedures triggered at different functional
entities as a result of API invocation requests and event notifications. The
stage-2 level requirements and signalling flows are defined in 3GPP TS 23.434
[2].
Several design aspects, as mentioned in the following clauses, are specified
in 3GPP TS 29.122 [3] and referenced by this specification.
## 6.2 Data Types
### 6.2.1 General
This clause defines structured data types, simple data types and enumerations
that are applicable to several APIs defined in the present specification and
can be referenced from data structures defined in the subsequent clauses.
In addition, data types that are defined in OpenAPI Specification [15] can
also be referenced from data structures defined in the subsequent clauses.
NOTE: As a convention, data types names in the present specification are with
an upper-case letter in the beginning. Parameters are with a lower-case letter
in the beginning. As an exception, data types that are also defined in OpenAPI
Specification [15] can use a lower-case case letter in the beginning for
consistency.

## 6.3 Usage of HTTP
For SEAL APIs, support of HTTP/1.1 (IETF RFC 7230 [5], IETF RFC 7231 [6], IETF
RFC 7232 [7], IETF RFC 7233 [8], IETF RFC 7234 [9] and IETF RFC 7235 [10])
over TLS is mandatory and support of HTTP/2 (IETF RFC 7540 [12]) over TLS is
recommended.
A functional entity desiring to use HTTP/2 shall use the HTTP upgrade
mechanism to negotiate applicable HTTP version as described in IETF RFC 7540
[12].
Usage of HTTP over TLS and the TLS profiles shall be as specified in clause
5.1.1.4 of 3GPP TS 33.434 [26].
## 6.4 Content type
The bodies of HTTP request and successful HTTP responses shall be encoded in
JSON format (see IETF RFC 8259 [13]).
The MIME media type that shall be used within the related Content-Type header
field is \"application/json\", as defined in IETF RFC 8259 [13].
The JSON objects defined in clause 5.2.3 of 3GPP TS 29.122 [3] for the HTTP
PATCH request shall be supported.
NOTE: This release only supports the content type JSON.
## 6.5 URI structure
6.5.1 Resource URI structure
All API URIs of SEAL APIs shall be:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\**
\"apiRoot\" is configured by means outside the scope of the present document.
It includes the scheme (\"https\"), host and optional port, and an optional
prefix string. \"apiName\" and \"apiVersion\" shall be set dependent on the
API, as defined in the corresponding clauses below.
All resource URIs in the clauses below are defined relative to the above root
API URI.
NOTE 1: The \"apiVersion\" will only be increased if the new API version
contains backward incompatible changes. Otherwise, the supported feature
mechanism defined in clause 6.8 can be used to negotiate extensions.
NOTE 2: A different root structure can be used when the resource URI is
preconfigured in the API invoking entity.
The root structure may be followed by \"apiSpecificSuffixes\" that are
dependent on the API and are defined separately for each API as resource URI
where they apply:
**{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
6.5.2 Custom operations URI structure
The custom operation definition is in Annex C of 3GPP TS 29.501 [14].
The URI of a custom operation which is associated with a resource shall have
the following structure:
> **{apiRoot}/\
> /\/\/\**
Custom operations can also be associated with the service instead of a
resource. The URI of a custom operation which is not associated with a
resource shall have the following structure:
> **{apiRoot}/\ /\/\**
In the above URI structures, \"apiRoot\", \"apiName\", \"apiVersion\" and
\"apiSpecificResourceUriPart\" are as defined in clause 6.5.1 and
\"custOpName\" represents the name of the custom operation as defined in
clause 5.1.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.501 [14]
## 6.6 Notifications
The functional entities
\- shall support the delivery of notifications using a separate HTTP
connection towards an address;
\- may support testing delivery of notifications; and
\- may support the delivery of notification using WebSocket protocol (see IETF
RFC 6455 [4]),
as described in 3GPP TS 29.122 [3], with the following clarifications:
\- the SCEF is the SEAL server; and
\- the SCS/AS is the Subscriber.
## 6.7 Error Handling
Response bodies and error handling described in clause 5.2.6 of 3GPP TS 29.122
[3] are applicable to all APIs in the present specification unless specified
otherwise, with the following clarifications:
\- the SCEF is the SEAL server; and
\- the SCS/AS is the functional entity invoking an API.
## 6.8 Feature negotiation
The functional entity invoking an API (i.e. the VAL server) and the SEAL
server use feature negotiation procedures defined in 3GPP TS 29.122 [3] to
negotiate the supported features, with the following clarifications:
\- description of the SCEF applies to the SEAL server; and
\- description of the SCS/AS applies to the functional entity invoking an API.
## 6.9 HTTP headers
The HTTP headers and the HTTP custom headers described in 3GPP TS 29.122 [3]
are applicable to all APIs in this document.
## 6.10 Conventions for Open API specification files
The conventions for Open API specification files as specified in clause 5.2.9
of 3GPP TS 29.122 [3] shall be applicable for all APIs in this document.

# 8 Using Common API Framework
## 8.1 General
When CAPIF is used with a SEAL service, the SEAL server shall support the
following as defined in 3GPP TS 29.222 [16]:
\- the API exposing function and related APIs over CAPIF-2/2e and CAPIF-3/3e
reference points;
\- the API publishing function and related APIs over CAPIF-4/4e reference
point;
\- the API management function and related APIs over CAPIF-5/5e reference
point; and
\- at least one of the security methods for authentication and authorization,
and related security mechanisms.
In a centralized deployment as defined in 3GPP TS 23.222 [17], where the CAPIF
core function and API provider domain functions are co-located, the
interactions between the CAPIF core function and API provider domain functions
may be independent of CAPIF-3/3e, CAPIF-4/4e and CAPIF-5/5e reference points.
When CAPIF is used with a SEAL service, the SEAL server shall register all the
features for northbound APIs in the CAPIF Core Function.
## 8.2 Security
When CAPIF is used for external exposure, before invoking the API exposed by
the SEAL server, the VAL server as API invoker shall negotiate the security
method (PKI, TLS-PSK or OAUTH2) with CAPIF core function and ensure the SEAL
server has enough credential to authenticate the VAL server (see 3GPP TS
29.222 [16], clause 5.6.2.2 and clause 6.2.2.2).
If PKI or TLS-PSK is used as the selected security method between the VAL
server and the SEAL server, upon API invocation, the SEAL server shall
retrieve the authorization information from the CAPIF core function as
described in 3GPP TS 29.222 [16], clause 5.6.2.4.
As indicated in 3GPP TS 33.122 [18], the access to the SEAL APIs may be
authorized by means of the OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [19]), using the
\"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the CAPIF core function (see
3GPP TS 29.222 [16]) plays the role of the authorization server.
NOTE 1: In this release, only \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant is
supported.
If OAuth2 is used as the selected security method between the VAL server and
the SEAL server, the VAL server, prior to consuming services offered by the
SEAL APIs, shall obtain a \"token\" from the authorization server, by invoking
the Obtain_Authorization service, as described in 3GPP TS 29.222 [16], clause
5.6.2.3.2.
The SEAL APIs do not define any scopes for OAuth2 authorization. It is the
SEAL server responsibility to check whether the VAL server is authorized to
use an API based on the \"token\". Once the SEAL server verifies the
\"token\", it shall check whether the SEAL server identifier in the \"token\"
matches its own published identifier, and whether the API name in the
\"token\" matches its own published API name. If those checks are passed, the
VAL server has full authority to access any resource or operation for the
invoked API
NOTE 2: For aforementioned security methods, the SEAL server needs to apply
admission control according to access control policies after performing the
authorization checks.
# 9 Security
## 9.1 General
The security aspects of SEAL reference points are specified in 3GPP TS 33.434
[26].
## 9.2 SEAL-S security
As specified in clause 5.1.1.8 of 3GPP TS 33.434 [26], the protection of
SEAL-S reference point shall be supported according to NDS/IP as specified in
3GPP TS 33.210 [25].
When CAPIF is not used, then TLS and OAuth 2.0 shall be supported as described
in clause 5.1.1.8 of 3GPP TS 33.434 [26]. When TLS is used, mutual
authentication based on client and server certificates shall be performed
between the SEAL server and VAL server using TLS. After the authentication,
the SEAL server determines whether the VAL server is authorized to send
requests to the SEAL server. The SEAL server shall authorize the requests from
VAL server using OAuth-based authorization mechanism.
When CAPIF is used, the security mechanisms described in clause 8.2 shall be
applied.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This annex is based on the OpenAPI Specification [15] and provides
corresponding representations of all APIs defined in the present specification
in YAML format.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API.
NOTE: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification file contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900
[24] and clause 5.3.1 of the 3GPP TS 29.501 [14] for further information).

###### ## Annex B (normative): SEAL NRM server support integration with TSN
When the SEAL Network Resource Management (NRM) server act as a TSN AF, the
NRM server shall support integration with TSN including 5GS Bridge information
reporting as defined in clause 14.3.8.2 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [2] and 5GS Bridge
configuration as defined in clause 14.3.8.3 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [2].
The 5GS integration with TSN only support fully-centralized model as defined
in IEEE Std 802.1Qcc-2018 [29], the NRM server acts as a TSN AF as defined in
clause 14.2.2.2 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [2], shall support the TSN bridge
information report as defined in clause 14.3.2.29 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [2], TSN
bridge information confirmation as defined in clause 14.3.2.30 of 3GPP TS
23.434 [2], TSN bridge configuration request as defined in clause 14.3.2.31 of
3GPP TS 23.434 [2] and TSN bridge configuration response as defined in clause
14.3.2.32 of 3GPP TS 23.434 [2]. TSN CNC (as defined in IEEE 802.1Qcc [29])
via the NRM-S reference point configures the TSN flows in the 5GS. As a TSN
AF, the SEAL NRM server shall interact with the 5GS PCF over the N5 reference
point to configure the 5G QoS and TSCAI parameters in 5GS as defined in clause
14.2.2.24 of 3GPP TS 29.514 [30].
