# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the stage 3 of the Ud interface between the
Front-Ends (FEs) and the User Data Repository (UDR) in the User Data
Convergence (UDC architecture).
This 3GPP Technical Specification (TS) specifies the protocol and interactions
between the FE and the UDR for Ud reference point, in particular:
\- The details of the LDAP protocol that are to be considered
\- The details of the SOAP envelope that provide support for subscriptions to
notifications and notifications about data changes service (S/N operations).
The User Data Convergence Stage 2 description (architecture and information
flows) is specified in 3GPP TS 23.335 [10].
The UDR data model used with LDAP (i.e. attributes, object classes and
directory information tree) is implementation specific and is left outside the
scope of 3GPP specifications. For multivendor interoperability between FEs and
UDR specific integration projects are needed. Some examples of Ud data models
are described in 3GPP TR 29.935 [19].[]{#__RefHeading___Toc90326189 .anchor}

# 3 Definitions, symbols and abbreviations
## 3.1 Definitions
For the purposes of the present document, the terms and definitions given in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1] and the following apply. A term defined in the present
document takes precedence over the definition of the same term, if any, in
3GPP TR 21.905 [1].
**LDAP Session:** starts with LDAP Bind Operation and ends with LDAP Unbind
Operation or Notice of Disconnection.
**Front End:** a core network functional entity or service layer entity or
provisioning entity that can access user data stored in a unique repository.
**Front End Identifier** : A name that uniquely identifies an FE within the
set of all FEs accessing an UDR.
**Front End Cluster** : FEs handling the same application may be grouped in
clusters to differentiate between them e.g. with regard to geographical
location, feature support, vendor, or other characteristics. All FEs within a
cluster are treated equally for required purposes (e.g. authorization,
notifications, etc.).
**Application type:** The application handled by a FE (e.g. HLR) determines
the application type of the FE. The application type is derived from the name
indicated by a FE.
**Front End Cluster Identifier** : A name that identifies a cluster grouped
with FEs supporting the same application.
**User Data Repository:** facility where user data can be accessed stored and
managed in a common way.
## 3.2 Symbols
For the purposes of the present document, the following symbols apply:
Ud reference point between a FE and the UDR
## 3.3 Abbreviations
For the purposes of the present document, the abbreviations given in 3GPP TR

# 5 General Messages
## 5.1 General
This clause describes common messages for UDC to establish sessions and
administrate transactions. For an existing session, UDC messages are exchanged
between the FE and the UDR. See figure B.1-1 in Annex B for general LDAP
message flows.
## 5.2 Open Link for a LDAP Session
To initiate a LDAP session, a Front-End shall first establish a transport
connection with the UDR. The transport connection shall be a TCP connection.
The IP Layer may be secured according to clause 8. When IPsec is used, an
IPsec connection may support several TCP connections, each supporting a LDAP
session.
After establishment of the transport connection, the FE shall initiate a LDAP
session by sending a LDAP BindRequest message. The establishment of the LDAP
session shall comply with IETF RFC 4511 [8]. It shall be done before sending
any other LDAP message. FE Identifier or FE Cluster Identifier shall be
included in the BindRequest message.
The UDR shall support the \"unauthenticated authentication mechanism of simple
Bind\" and the \"name/password authentication mechanism of simple Bind\" in
the \"simple authentication method\" specified in IETF RFC 4513 [16].
The UDR derives the application type from the FE Identifier or the FE Cluster
Identifier. If the FE provided the Front End Identifier the UDR may also
derive the Front End Cluster Identifier.
NOTE: As security is handled at IP Layer (see clause 8), optional security
mechanisms (TLS, SASL) described in IETF RFC 4513 [16] specification are not
required for Ud.
## 5.3 Close Link for a LDAP Session
Termination of the LDAP session may be initiated by the FE by sending an
UnbindRequest message or by the UDR by sending a Notice of Disconnection
message. The termination of the LDAP session shall comply with IETF RFC 4511
[8]
## 5.4 Transactions
In order to allow FEs to relate a number of update operations, such as Create
(see 6.3), Delete (see 6.4), and Update (see 6.5), and have them performed in
one unit of interaction, the transaction concept in IETF RFC 5805
\"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) Transactions\" [5] shall be
supported. See figure B.2-1 in Annex B for LDAP Transaction flow.
If used, they shall only be used for a single subscriber in order to decrease
the complexity of transactions.
LDAP server shall terminate the transaction if the timer is expired.
## 5.5 SOAP Authentication
The UDR may support the SOAP WS-Security extension [20] and \"UsernameToken\"
authentication as specified by the Oasis Web Services Security [21].
The WS-Security Username field may be set to a value that is correlated with
the username of the LDAP BindRequest (see clause 5.2).
NOTE: As security is handled at the IP Layer (see clause 8), optional security
mechanisms (i.e. signature, encryption and passwordDigest) as described in the
Oasis Web Services Security specifications [20][21] are not required for the
Ud inteface.
# 6 User Data Convergence Messages

a SOAP message envelope.
Subscribe response messages shall be coded as HTTP response message and shall
contain a SOAP envelope.
Subscribe request and response messages shall contain a SOAP message envelope
header with a header block containing the following elements:
\- msgId\ This element uniquely identifies the Subscribe message request --
response pair within a connection. The msgId is of type integer. The FE shall
allocate the value and use it together with the connId (if any) to correlate a
received subscribe response with a sent subscribe request.
\- connId\ This optional element identifies the connection between FE and UDR.
The connId is of type integer. If used, the value is allocated by the FE and
is used together with the msgId to correlate a subscribe response with a
subscribe request.
Optionally, the Subscribe request SOAP message envelope may contain an
authentication ws-security header block and a UsernameToken element containing
the following elements:
\- Username
\- Password
An example of a SOAP envelope header for a Subscribe request message is given

Subscribe request and send it unmodified in the Subscribe response.
Subscribe request messages shall contain a SOAP message envelope body
formatted according to the XML schema defined in Annex A.
Subscribe response messages shall contain an empty SOAP message envelope body,
unless SOAP Fault element is included to indicate detailed error information.
The HTTP status code in the Subscribe response message is used to indicate
success or failure.
A Subscribe request containing several subscriptions shall be managed in an
atomic manner. In the event where at least one requestedData elements among
several within a Subscribe request is rejected, the Subscribe response shall
report a failure and none of the requestedData elements within this Subscribe
request shall be accepted by the UDR. A SOAP Fault element may be included to
indicate detailed error information relevant to the first error encountered.

The value is copied from the Subscribe message or pre-configured in the UDR.
The serviceName is of type string with up to 20 characters.
\- msgId\ This element uniquely identifies the Notify message request --
response pair within a connection. The msgId is of type integer. The UDR shall
allocate the value and use it together with the connId (if any) to correlate a
received notify response with a sent notify request.
\- connId\ This optional element identifies the connection between the UDR and
the FE. The connId is of type integer. If used, the value is allocated by the
UDR and is used together with the msgId to correlate a notify response with a
notify request.
An example of a SOAP envelope header for a Notify request message is given
below:
\\ \\ \HLR-FE\\
\787627350\\ \1\\
\\ \

send a LDAP AbandonRequest message.
# 7 Information Elements
## 7.1 Information Element Types with LDAP
Information elements and their type to be used in the messages on a given Ud
interface for the LDAP Search, Add, Delete and Modify operations are dependent
of the application type of the Ud interface. They are described in a LDAP
Directory Schema associated to this application type. The general content and
structure of a LDAP Directory Schema is described in IETF RFC 4512 [11].
NOTE: The LDAP Directory Schema associated to an application type relates to
the application data view mentioned in 3GPP TS 23.335 [10].
When Information elements that are used on a given Ud interface are addressed
in 3GPP TS 32.182 [12], their description in the LDAP Directory Schema
associated to the application type of this Ud interface shall comply with 3GPP
TS 32.182 [12].
## 7.2 Information Elements for Subscriptions and Notifications
Information elements and their type to be used for subscriptions and
notifications about data changes shall also follow the rules specified above
in 7.1 and according to the formats/schemas defined in Annex A.
# 8 Security
Ud interface shall provide security with the methods specified in 3GPP TS
33.210 [15]
Application sensitive data (e.g. permanent authentication keys K/Ki) shall be
stored encrypted in the UDR and transferred encrypted over Ud. All FEs (e.g.
HLR/HSS/AuC) **_handling sensitive data, accessing the same UDR and handling
the same users (e.g. belonging to the same cluster) shall use the same
mechanism and key for decrypting these data._** The Application FEs shall
support at least AES [17] as a common algorithm, and may support additional
algorithms. The **_key for encryption/decryption is not subscriber-
specific._**
Editor\'s note: details of AES (modes of operation, **_key lengths, data
formats, etc.) are to be completed._**
Editor\'s note: statement above must be reviewed and confirmed by SA3

###### ## Annex B (informative): LDAP Message flows and Transaction flows for
UDC
# B.1 General LDAP Message flow for UDC
Figure B.1-1. General LDAP Message flow
Figure B.1-1 illustrates the general LDAP message flow associated to a LDAP
session for UDC, in compliance with IETF RFC 4511[8].
# B.2 LDAP Transaction flows for UDC
Figure B.2-1 illustrates the LDAP transaction flow for UDC. The procedures
described in IETF RFC 5805 \"Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)
Transactions\" [5] are applied.
Figure B.2-1. LDAP Transaction flow
1\. When the FE needs to bind more than one operation to the UDR in one FE
session, the FE issues a Start Transaction Request to UDR to begin a
transaction.
2\. When receiving a Start Transaction Request, the UDR checks whether the
transaction is allowed, e.g. check whether the number of the concurrent
transaction exceeds the limit. If the transaction is allowed, the UDR returns
a Start Transaction Response with an identity of the transaction assigned by
the UDR to the FE and store the transaction identity temporarily until the
transaction ends or expires. Otherwise, a Start Transaction Response with the
failure code is returned.
3-4.If the result code indicates failure, the following steps are skipped and
the procedure terminates. Otherwise, the FE issues the operations to the UDR
with the transaction identity received in the Start Transaction Response
message from the UDR. The operations with the same transaction identity are in
the same transaction.
5\. After all or some of the operations are performed, the FE sends an End
Transaction Request with the transaction identity to the UDR to commit or
rollback the transaction according to the application logic of the FE.
6\. When commitment is indicated in the End Transaction Request, the UDR
commits all the updates made. If all the updates are committed successfully, a
success response is indicated in the End Transaction Response. Otherwise, all
the updates are rolled back and the data remains as it was before the
transaction and failure is indicated in the End Transaction Response. When
rollback is indicated in the End Transaction Request, the UDR cancels all the
updates made and return the End Transaction Response with the cancel result to
the FE.
###### ## Annex C (informative): Messages Based on SOAP
# C.1 General
Some Front Ends which do not have high real time performance requirements
would prefer to interact with the UDR on the basis of a SOAP protocol for data
access (CRUD) as well as for Subscriptions and Notifications (S/N). A way to
accomplish this is by means of a protocol converter that converts SOAP based
data access messages into LDAP based data access messages. SOAP based
Subscription and Notification messages need not be converted. The
architectural options are shown in figure C.1/1:
Figure C.1/1: Data access options based on SOAP
As shown in the Figure C.1/1, the Protocol Converter that converts SOAP based
data access messages to LDAP based data access messages can be stand alone, be
integrated into the FE or be integrated into the UDR. LDAP based data access
(CRUD) messages and SOAP based Subscription and Notification (S/N) messages
are specified in the normative part of this specification. A description of
SOAP based data access messages which are exchanged between FEs without high
realtime performance requirements and the Protocol Converter is given in this
informative annex.
NOTE: An application that does not have high real time requirements implies
that it does not demand neither high values of traffic throughput nor small
request/response latency values nor high demanding processing needs.
