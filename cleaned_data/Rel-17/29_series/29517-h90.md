# 4 Naf_EventExposure Service
## 4.1 Service Description
### 4.1.1 Overview
The Application Function Exposure Service, as defined in 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]
and 3GPP TS 23.288 [4], is provided by the Application Function (AF). When the
UE Application data is collected via the Data Collection AF, the Application
Function Exposure Service, as defined in 3GPP TS 26.531 [28], 3GPP TS 26.501
[29], and 3GPP TS 26.512 [30], is provided by the Data Collection AF
instantiated in 5GMS AF for the Event Consumer AF instantiated in 5GMS ASP.
This service:
\- allows NF service consumers to subscribe, modify and unsubscribe for
application events; and
\- notifies NF service consumers with a corresponding subscription about
observed events on the AF.
The types of observed events include:
AF application events exposed by AF:
\- Service Experience information for an application;
\- UE mobility information;
\- UE communication information;
\- Exceptions information;
\- User Data Congestion information;
\- Collective Behaviour information;
\- Dispersion information; and
\- Performance Data information;
UE application events exposed via Data Collection AF:
\- Media Streaming QoE metrics;
\- Media Streaming Consumption reports;
\- Media Streaming Network Assistance invocation;
\- Media Streaming Dynamic Policy invocation; and
\- Media Streaming access activity.
When the event to which the NF service consumer has subscribed occurs, the AF
reports the requested information to the NF service consumer based on the
event reporting information definition requested by the NF service consumer
(see 3GPP TS 23.502 [3]).
### 4.1.2 Service Architecture
The Data Analytics Architecture is defined in 3GPP TS 23.288 [4]. The Media
Streaming UE application data collection via the Data Collection AF is defined
in 3GPP TS 26.531 [28].
The Application Function Exposure Service (Naf_EventExposure) is part of the
Naf service-based interface exhibited by the Application Function (AF).
The known NF service consumers of the Naf_EventExposure service are the
Network Exposure Function (NEF), the Network Data Analytics Function (NWDAF),
the Data Collection Coordination Function (DCCF), the Messaging Framework
Adaptor Function (MFAF), or the Event Consumer AF in the 5GMS ASP.
The Naf_EventExposure service is provided by the AF and consumed by NF service
consumers (e.g. NEF, NWDAF, DCCF, MFAF, Event Consumer AF), as shown in figure
4.1.2-1 for the SBI representation model and in figure 4.1.2-2 for reference
point representation model.

If the AF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP POST request due to an
internal error or an error in the HTTP POST request, the AF shall send the
HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7.
Upon successful reception of the HTTP POST request with \"{apiRoot}/naf-
eventexposure/\/subscriptions\" as request URI and
\"AfEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as request body, the AF shall create a
new \"Individual Application Event Subscription\" resource, store the
subscription and send an HTTP \"201 Created\" response as shown in step 2 of
figure 4.2.2.2-1, containing:
\- a Location header field; and
\- an \"AfEventExposureSubsc\" data type in the payload body.
The Location header field shall contain the URI of the created individual
application session context resource i.e. \"{apiRoot}/naf-
eventexposure/\/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}\".
The \"AfEventExposureSubsc\" data type payload body shall contain the
representation of the created \"Individual Application Event Subscription\".
When the \"monDur\" attribute is included in the response by the AF, it
represents AF selected expiry time that is equal or less than the expiry time
received in the request.
When the \"immRep\" attribute is included and sets to \"true\" in the
subscription and the subscribed events are available, the AF shall include the
reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP POST response.
When the sampling ratio as, \"sampRatio\" attribute, is included in the
subscription without a \"partitionCriteria\" attribute, the AF shall select a
random subset of UEs among the target UEs according to the sampling ratio and
only report the event(s) related to the selected subset of UEs. If the
\"partitionCriteria\" attribute is additionally included, then the AF shall
first partition the UEs according to the value of the \"partitionCriteria\"
attribute and then select a random subset of UEs from each partition according
to the sampling ratio and only report the event(s) related to the selected
subsets of UEs.
When the group reporting guard time as the \"grpRepTime\" attribute is
included in the subscription, the AF shall accumulate all the event reports
for the target UEs until the group reporting guard time expires. Then the AF
shall notify the NF service consumer using the Naf_EventExposure_Notify
service operation, as described in clause 4.2.4.2.
When the \"notifFlag\" attribute is included and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the
request, the AF shall mute the event notification and store the available
events.
#### 4.2.2.3 Modifying an existing subscription
Figure 4.2.2.3-1 illustrates the modification of an existing subscription.
Figure 4.2.2.3-1: Modification of an existing subscription
To modify an existing subscription to event notifications, the NF service
consumer shall send an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/naf-
eventexposure/\/subscriptions/{**subscriptionId**}\" as request
URI, as shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.2.3-1, where \"{**subscriptionId**}\" is
the subscription correlation ID of the existing subscription. The
\"AfEventExposureSubsc\" data structure is included as request body as
described in clause 4.2.2.2.
NOTE 1: An alternate NF service consumer than the one that requested the
generation of the subscription resource can send the PUT request.
NOTE 2: The \"notifUri\" attribute within the AfEventExposureSubsc data
structure can be modified to request that subsequent notifications are sent to
a new NF service consumer.
NOTE 3: The \"monDur\" attribute within the AfEventExposureSubsc data
structure can be modified to extend the expiry time to keep receiving
notifications.
If the AF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP PUT request due to an
internal error or an error in the HTTP PUT request, the AF shall send an HTTP
error response as specified in clause 5.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the AF determines the received HTTP
PUT request needs to be redirected, the AF shall send an HTTP redirect
response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
Upon successful reception of an HTTP PUT request with: \"{apiRoot}/naf-
eventexposure/\/subscriptions/{**subscriptionId**}\" as request
URI and \"AfEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as request body, the AF shall
update the subscription and send either a HTTP \"200 OK\" response with the
\"AfEventExposureSubsc\" data structure as response body containing the
representation of the modified \"Individual Application Event Subscription\",
or an HTTP \"204 No Content\" response, as shown in step 2 of figure
4.2.2.3-1.
When the \"monDur\" attribute is included in the response by the AF, it
represents AF selected expiry time that is equal or less than the expiry time
received in the request.
When the \"immRep\" attribute is included and sets to \"true\" in the
subscription and the subscribed events are available, the AF shall include the
reports of the events subscribed, if available, in the HTTP PUT response.
When the sampling ratio, as \"sampRatio\" attribute, is included in the
subscription without a \"partitionCriteria\" attribute, the AF shall select a
random subset of UEs among the target UEs according to the sampling ratio and
only report the event(s) related to the selected subset of UEs. If the
\"partitionCriteria\" attribute is additionally included, then the AF shall
first partition the UEs according to the value of the \"partitionCriteria\"
attribute and then select a random subset of UEs from each partition according
to the sampling ratio and only report the event(s) related to the selected
subsets of UEs.
When the group reporting guard time, as \"grpRepTime\" attribute, is included
in the subscription, the AF shall accumulate all the event reports for the
target UEs until the group reporting guard time expires. Then, the AF shall
notify the NF service consumer using the Naf_EventExposure_Notify service
operation, as described in clause 4.2.4.2.
When the \"notifFlag\" attribute is included, and set to \"DEACTIVATE\" in the
request, the AF shall mute the event notification and store the available
events; if it is set to \"RETRIEVAL\" in the request, the AF shall send the
stored events to the NF service consumer, and mute the event notification
again and store available events; if it is set to \"ACTIVATE\" and the event
notifications are muted (due to a previously received \"DECATIVATE\" value),
the AF shall unmute the event notification, i.e. start sending again
notifications for available events.
### 4.2.3 Naf_EventExposure_Unsubscribe service operation
#### 4.2.3.1 General
This service operation is used by an NF service consumer to unsubscribe from
event notifications.
The following procedure using the Naf_EventExposure_Unsubscribe service
operation is supported:
\- unsubscription from event notifications.
#### 4.2.3.2 Unsubscription from event notifications
Figure 4.2.3.2-1 illustrates the unsubscription from event notifications.
Figure 4.2.3.2-1: Unsubscription from event notifications
To unsubscribe from event notifications, the NF service consumer shall send an
HTTP DELETE request with \"{apiRoot}/naf-
eventexposure/\/subscriptions/{**subscriptionId**}\" as request
URI, as shown in step 1 of figure 4.2.3.2-1, where \"{**subscriptionId**}\" is
the subscription correlation identifier of the existing resource subscription
that is to be deleted.
If the AF cannot successfully fulfil the received HTTP DELETE request due to
an internal error or an error in the HTTP DELETE request, the AF shall send an
HTTP error response as specified in clause 5.7.
If the feature \"ES3XX\" is supported, and the AF determines the received HTTP
DELETE request needs to be redirected, the AF shall send an HTTP redirect
response as specified in clause 6.10.9 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
Upon successful reception of the HTTP DELETE request with: \"{apiRoot}/naf-
eventexposure/\/subscriptions/{**subscriptionId**}\" as request
URI, the AF shall remove the corresponding subscription and send an HTTP \"204
No Content\" response as shown in step 2 of figure 4.2.3.2-1.
### 4.2.4 Naf_EventExposure_Notify service operation
#### 4.2.4.1 General
The Naf_EventExposure_Notify service operation enables the AF to notify to the
NF service consumer(s) that the previously subscribed application related
event occurred.
The following procedure using the Naf_EventExposure_Notify service operation
is supported:
\- notification about subscribed events.
#### 4.2.4.2 Notification about subscribed events
Figure 4.2.4.2-1 illustrates the notification about subscribed events.
Figure 4.2.4.2-1: Notification about subscribed events
If the AF observes application related event(s) for which an NF service
consumer has subscribed, the AF shall send an HTTP POST request as shown in
step 1 of figure 4.2.4.2-1, with the \"{notifUri}\" as request URI containing
the value previously provided by the NF service consumer within the
corresponding subscription, and the \"AfEventExposureNotif\" data structure.
The \"AfEventExposureNotif\" data structure shall include:
a) the notification correlation ID provided by the NF service consumer during
the subscription as \"notifId\" attribute; and
b) information about the observed event(s) within the \"eventNotifs\"
attribute that shall contain for each observed event an
\"AfEventNotification\" data structure that shall include:
1) the application related event as \"event\" attribute;
2) the time at which the event was observed encoded as \"timeStamp\"
attribute;
3) if the \"event\" attribute is \"SVC_EXPERIENCE\":

[22], IETF RFC 7232 [23], IETF RFC 7233 [24], IETF RFC 7234 [25] and IETF RFC
7235 [26]) over TLS is mandatory and support of HTTP/2 (IETF RFC 7540 [7])
over TLS is recommended. TLS shall be used as specified in clause 12.3 and
clause 13.1 of 3GPP TS 33.501 [14].
If the AF is trusted, HTTP/2, IETF RFC 7540 [7], shall be used as specified in
clause 5.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
HTTP/2 shall be transported as specified in clause 5.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5].
The OpenAPI [8] specification of HTTP messages and content bodies for the
Naf_EventExposure is contained in Annex A.
### 5.2.2 HTTP standard headers
#### 5.2.2.1 General
See clause 5.2.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5] for the usage of HTTP standard headers.
#### 5.2.2.2 Content type
JSON, IETF RFC 8259 [9], shall be used as content type of the HTTP bodies
specified in the present specification as specified in clause 5.4 of 3GPP TS
29.500 [5]. The use of the JSON format shall be signalled by the content type
\"application/json\".
\"Problem Details\" JSON object shall be used to indicate additional details
of the error in a HTTP response body and shall be signalled by the content
type \"application/problem+json\", as defined in IETF RFC 7807 [10].
### 5.2.3 HTTP custom headers
#### 5.2.3.1 General
The Naf_EventExposure API shall support mandatory HTTP custom header fields
specified in clause 5.2.3.2 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [5] and may support HTTP custom
header fields specified in clause 5.2.3.3 of 3GPP TS 29.500 [4].
In this Release of the specification, no specific custom headers are defined
for the Naf_EventExposure API.

## 5.9 Security
TLS shall be used to support the security communication between the NF Service
Consumer and the AF as defined in clause 12.3 and clause 13.1 of 3GPP TS
33.501 [14].
If the AF is trusted, as indicated in 3GPP TS 33.501 [14] and 3GPP TS 29.500
[5], the access to the Naf_EventExposure API may be authorized by means of the
OAuth 2.0 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [15]), based on local configuration,
using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant, where the NRF (see 3GPP
TS 29.510 [16]) plays the role of the authorization server.
If OAuth 2.0 is used, an NF Service Consumer, prior to consuming services
offered by the Naf_EventExposure API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server, by invoking the Access Token Request service, as
described in 3GPP TS 29.510 [16], clause 5.4.2.2.
NOTE: When multiple NRFs are deployed in a network, the NRF used as
authorization server is the same NRF that the NF Service Consumer used for
discovering the Naf_EventExposure service.
The Naf_EventExposure API defines a single scope \"naf-eventexposure\" for the
entire service, and it does not define any additional scopes at resource or
operation level.
If the AF is untrusted, the access to Naf_EventExposure API shall be
authorized by means of OAuth2 protocol (see IETF RFC 6749 [15]), based on
local configuration, using the \"Client Credentials\" authorization grant. If
OAuth2 is used, a NF Service Consumer (e.g. NEF), prior to consuming services
offered by the Naf_EventExposure API, shall obtain a \"token\" from the
authorization server.
###### ## Annex A (normative): OpenAPI specification
# A.1 General
This Annex is based on the OpenAPI Specification [8] and provides
corresponding representations of all APIs defined in the present
specification.
NOTE 1: An OpenAPIs representation embeds JSON Schema representations of HTTP
message bodies.
This Annex shall take precedence when being discrepant to other parts of the
specification with respect to the encoding of information elements and methods
within the API(s).
NOTE 2: The semantics and procedures, as well as conditions, e.g. for the
applicability and allowed combinations of attributes or values, not expressed
in the OpenAPI definitions but defined in other parts of the specification
also apply.
Informative copies of the OpenAPI specification files contained in this 3GPP
Technical Specification are available on a Git-based repository that uses the
GitLab software version control system (see clause 5B of the 3GPP TR 21.900
[11] and clause 5.3.1 of the 3GPP TS 29.501 [6] for further information).
The security scheme defined below for the Naf_EventExposure API shows the case
when the AF is in untrusted domain and the \"scopes\" and \"tokenUrl\" are
undefined. For the trusted AF, the \"scopes\" definition shall use \"naf-
eventexposure\" and the \"tokenUrl\" definition shall use
\"{nrfApiRoot}/oauth2/token\".
