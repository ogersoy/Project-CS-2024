# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the mapping:
\- performed by the AMF between HTTP responses (Status Codes and Protocol or
Application Errors) returned by 5GC NFs to the AMF and 5GMM Cause values sent
to UEs;
\- performed by the SMF between HTTP responses (Status Codes and Protocol or
Application Errors) returned by 5GC NFs to SMF and 5GSM Cause values sent to
UEs;
\- performed by the SMF between N4 errors returned by the UPF and 5GSM Cause
values sent to UEs.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

## 4.3 Mapping between Nsmf services causes and 5GMM causes
### 4.3.1 General
This clause defines the mapping performed by the AMF between HTTP responses
(status codes and Protocol or Application Errors) returned by SMF services to
the AMF and the 5GMM cause values sent to UEs.
The AMF may invoke SMF service operations upon receipt of:
\- 5GSM messages (e.g. PDU Session establishment request) piggybacked in 5GMM
UL NAS TRANSPORT message;
\- 5GMM Service Request or Registration Request messages, to establish the
user-plane resources of a PDU session.
A 5GMM cause is defined in:
\- the DL NAS TRANSPORT message;
\- the PDU session reactivation result error cause IE of a REGISTRATION ACCEPT
or SERVICE ACCEPT message;
\- the REGISTRATION REJECT or SERVICE REJECT message.
The AMF shall support mapping the status code and/or Protocol or Application
Error received from the SMF to a 5GMM cause code, where 3GPP TS 24.501 [3]
requires a 5GMM Cause to be included in the 5GMM message sent to the UE.
NOTE: REGISTRATION REJECT and SERVICE REJECT messages are rejected only due to
5GMM-specific reasons, i.e. not for problems specific to session management.
