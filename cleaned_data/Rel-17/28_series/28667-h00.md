# 4 Concepts and background
## 4.1 General
The initial planning of radio parameters is typically done with specialized
tools called Radio Planning Tools (RPTs). RPTs generate throughput and
capacity estimations as well as predictions for coverage and interference
maps. RPTs utilize site and antenna (equipment) information, as well as
geographic data (e.g. terrain data, type of land usage, building data and road
data). This data has to be entered into the tools.
In order to improve the initial network planning, planned site and antenna
data are adjusted until the estimated system performance meets the
requirements within the given deployment constraints.
Information about the sites and antennas is needed also by other applications,
like SON applications or CM applications on NM level. For this reason it is
beneficial if this data can be read via standardized interfaces.\ In contrast
to configuration information it is normally not possible to read this data
from the network elements.\ The only place where this data is available in
many deployment scenarios is in the RPT. Though this data represents initial
planning, site data and antenna data are not likely to be changed very often,
so that there is a fair chance that the data stored by the RPT represents also
the actual situation in the network.
For this reason it is beneficial to have a read access to site and antenna
data stored by the RPT.
It is to be noted that this TS series is only about the read access to site
and antenna data. It is not concerned with any other functionality the RPT
might have, nor with how the read data is used, nor if the read data
represents the actual information about the network or if the data is
outdated. Reading of site and antenna data stored by the RPT is hence the only
use case in scope.
## 4.2 Architecture
The RPT is a kind of NMLS (see TS 32.101 [2]).
### 4.3 Functionality
The RPT offers a capability allowing read access to site and antenna data. The
RPT is a Service Provider (SP) and the NM a Service Consumer (SC). The RPTA
IRP specifies the information model exposed by the RPT, and the operations to
access it.
# 5 Business level requirements
## 5.1 Requirements
**REQ-RPT_NRM-CON-001:** The RPT shall support a capability allowing the NM to
retrieve planned data from the RPT.
## 5.2 Actor roles
The function at the NM requesting to read planned data from the RPT.
## 5.3 Telecommunications resources
**RPT** : The Radio Planning Tool storing the planned data and exposing it by
its Service Provider (SP) function.
**NM** : The Network Manager requesting the planned data by its Service
Consumer (SC) function.
**SP in the RPT** : The Service Provider (SP) in the RPT offering read access
to planned data in the RPT.
**SC in the NM** : The Service Consumer (SC) in the NM using services offered
by the RPT.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Relation of RPT Planned Data, ARCF data and
configuration data
There are several kinds of data defined in 32- and 28-series standards.
ARCF data are the data which are required for successful activation (of e.g.
cell, eNB) that require coordination between several cells and cannot be
generated below Itf-N. Some of the ARCF data may be used directly as eNodeB
configuration data and some of the ARCF data may be used to generate more
other eNodeB configuration data. eNodeB will use the ARCF data together with
other configuration data as initial eNodeB radio configuration data. The
eNodeB initial radio configuration data will be used for self-configuration.
Configuration data are normally defined as NRM IRP data.
Planned Data, which is the data exposed by the RPT for read access by the NM,
may be different from those used during NM normal operation of the actual
network.
The relation between different kinds of data is:
1) The Planned Data are stored in RPT. NM or other NM layer applications can
retrieve Planned Data from RPT. Some of the Planned Data retrieved from RPT
can be used directly as configuration data or ARCF data (e.g. antenna data
like antennaAzimuth and antennaTilt).
2) Some of the ARCF data are used as configuration data directly and other
ARCF data are used to generate more other configuration data, see TS 32.501
[3].
