# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects,
Telecommunication management; as identified below:
28.701: **\"** Core Network (CN) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration
Reference Point (IRP); Requirements\".
**28.702: \"Core Network (CN) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration
Reference Point (IRP); Information Service (IS)\".**
28.703: \"Core Network (CN) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference
Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions\".
Configuration Management (CM), in general, provides the operator with the
ability to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it
evolves. CM actions have the objective to control and monitor the actual
configuration on the Network Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and
they may be initiated by the operator or by functions in the Operations
Systems (OSs) or NEs.
CM actions may be requested as part of an implementation programme (e.g.
additions and deletions), as part of an optimization programme (e.g.
modifications), and to maintain the overall Quality of Service (QoS). The CM
actions are initiated either as single actions on single NEs of the 3G
network, or as part of a complex procedure involving actions on many
resources/objects in one or several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document is part of an Integration Reference Point (IRP) named
\"Core Network NRM IRP\", through which an \'IRPAgent\' (typically an Element
Manager or Network Element) can communicate Configuration Management
information to one or several \'IRPManagers\' (typically Network Managers)
concerning CN resources.
The present document specifies the protocol neutral Core Network NRM IRP;
Information Service. It reuses relevant parts of the generic NRM in 3GPP TS
28.622 [9], either by direct reuse or sub-classing, and in addition to that
defines CN specific Information Object Classes.
Finally, in order to access the information defined by this NRM, an Interface
IRP is needed, such as the Basic CM IRP 3GPP TS 32.602 [10]. However, which
Interface IRP that is applicable is outside the scope of the present document.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

information relevant for this IRP. This clause provides an overview of the
relationships between relevant classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more
detailed specification of various aspects of these classes.

NOTE 1: The association between MscServerFunction and CsMgwFunction is
optional and is only mandatory when they belong to different ManagedElements.
NOTE 2: The association between MscServerFunction and GsmCell, and
SgsnFunction and GsmCell are optional. It may be valid if both the
MscServerFunction and GsmCell, or SgsnFunction and GsmCell are managed by the
same management node.

Each IOC is identified with a Distinguished Name (DN) according to 3GPP TS
32.300 [6] that expresses its containment hierarchy. As an example, the DN of
an IOC representing a cell could have a format like:
SubNetwork=Sweden, MeContext =MEC-Gbg-1, ManagedElement =MSC-Gbg-1,
MscServerFunction=MSC-1.
