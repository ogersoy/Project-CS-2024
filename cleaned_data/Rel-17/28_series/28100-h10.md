# Introduction
Autonomous network is one of the important topics in 5G network. Complexity of
5G network increases with large number of devices and diversity of services.
Different autonomous mechanisms are introduced by the industry to reduce the
complexity of mobile network and service management. Moving from a manual
operating network to a fully autonomous network requires a stepwise
progression. For each step there are different capability and performance
level of autonomy. Thus the concept of autonomous network levels and
corresponding requirements are introduced to describe and evaluate each level
in details.

# 4 Concepts and background
## 4.1 Autonomous network concept
The network become complex due to large number of devices and diversity of
services. Different autonomy mechanisms are introduced in the industry to
reduce the complexity of network management and control. The ultimate goal for
autonomous network is to enable telecommunication system (including management
system and network) to be governed by itself with minimal to no human
intervention by utilizing the autonomy mechanisms (including intelligence
mechanism, e.g. AI/ML, and automation mechanism, e.g. rule-based automatic
control, and other mechanisms to enable the autonomous network). Autonomous
network can reduce the operating expenditure (OPEX) associated with the
autonomous management and control of the complexity network and improve the
service experience to enable various vertical industries (e.g. autonomous
vehicle, smart city). Following are concepts related to autonomous network:
\- Autonomous network is telecommunication system (including management system
and network) with autonomy capabilities which is able to be governed by itself
with minimal to no human intervention.
\- Autonomous network level is used to describe the level of autonomy
capabilities in the autonomous network.
\- Self-Organization Network, Management data analytics, Intent driven
management, closed loop SLS assurance are examples of enablers for autonomous
network.
## 4.2 Autonomous network level concept
Different autonomy mechanisms in the telecommunication system may lead to
different capabilities of autonomy and different operation efficiency on
network management and control workflow, and indicates the level of autonomy
of the network. The term Autonomous network level is used to describe the
levels of autonomy capabilities in the autonomous network to improve the
efficiency for network management and control. Participation of the human and
telecommunication system in the network management and control workflow are
different for each level and are important factors to evaluate the autonomous
network levels. For each autonomous network level, some tasks can be performed
by telecommunication system, some performed by human, and some performed by
cooperation of human and telecommunication system. For example, in the highest
autonomous network level, all tasks are performed by telecommunication system.
## 4.3 Dimensions for evaluating autonomous network levels.
### 4.3.1 Introduction
This clause describes the dimensions i.e. scenarios, management scope and
workflow, which can be used for evaluating autonomous network level.
### 4.3.2 Scenarios
The autonomous network can be implemented for different scenarios, the
complexity of autonomous network depends on the detailed scenarios where it is
applied. Also it will be more challenging for the telecommunication system to
achieve the autonomous network for full scenarios than for certain scenarios.
The autonomy capabilities of the scenarios will impact the autonomous network
level for the whole autonomous network.
Following are scenario types categorized by network and service management
process for autonomous network:
\- Network and service planning
\- Network and service deployment
\- Network and service maintenance
\- Network and service optimization
Note: The network and service planning is not addressed in the present
document.
### 4.3.3 Management scope
The autonomy can be implemented in different scopes, the complexity of
autonomous network depends on its applicable scope. For example, it will be
more challenging for the telecommunication system to achieve the autonomous
network on cross domain network layer than domain network layer, because more
autonomy mechanism needs to be introduced for the coordination between
different domains. The autonomy capabilities of the management scope will
impact the autonomous network level for the whole autonomous network.
Following are applicable scopes for autonomous network:
\- Autonomy in NE/NF layer, which means the autonomy mechanisms are executed
in the NE/NF.
\- Autonomy in domain network layer, which means the autonomy mechanisms are
executed in the MnF(s) in domain.
\- Autonomy in cross domain network layer, which means the autonomy mechanisms
are executed in the MnF(s) in cross domain.
\- Autonomy in communication service layer, how to execute the autonomy
mechanisms are executed in MnF(s) for communication service.
_Note: autonomy in communication service layer is not specified in the present
document._

### 4.3.4 Workflow
Workflow is used to describe the necessary steps to achieve certain management
and control purposes. A workflow is composed of one or more management and
control tasks. Each workflow task may be accomplished by human, or
accomplished by telecommunication system with human assistance, or
accomplished by telecommunication system without human intervention. The
autonomy capabilities of the tasks in the workflow may impact the autonomous
network level.
Following are the categorization of the tasks in a workflow:
\- **Intent handling:** The group of tasks which translate network or service
intent from operator or customer into detailed operations and/or control
information which may affect one or more of the following groups of tasks
(i.e. awareness, analysis, decision, execution), also evaluate and feedback
intent fulfilment information (e.g. the intent is satisfied or not) based on
the detailed network and service information. More information of intent
handling see the Intent driven management defined in 28.312[2].
\- **Awareness:** The group of tasks which include network and service data
(e.g. configuration data, performance data, alarm data, etc.) collection and
necessary data pre-processing (e.g. data cleaning, filtering, statistics,
etc.) with the purpose of monitoring network and service information
(including network and service performance, network and service anomaly,
network and service event, etc.). More information of Awareness see
corresponding Monitor of Management control loops defined in 28.535 [3].
\- **Analysis:** The group of tasks which analyse the obtained network and
service information (e.g. network and service status, network and service
issues and so on) or based on the historical network and service information
to further predict the future change trend of the above network and service
status, and make recommendation for decision. More information of Analysis see
corresponding Analytic of Management control loops defined in 28.535 [3].
\- **Decision:** The group of tasks which evaluate and decide the necessary
operation for execution, e.g. network configuration or adjustment. More
information of Decision see corresponding Decision of Management control loops
defined in 28.535 [3].
\- **Execution:** The group of tasks which execute the operations. More
information of Execution see corresponding Execution of Management control
loops defined in 28.535 [3].

**Level 0 manual operating network** : No categorization of the tasks is
accomplished by telecom system itself.
**Level 1 assisted operating network** : A part of the execution and awareness
tasks are accomplished automatically by telecom system itself based on human
defined control information. At this level, telecom system can assist human to
improve the execution and awareness efficiency.
**Level 2 preliminary autonomous network** : All the execution tasks are
accomplished automatically by telecom system itself. A part of the awareness
and analysis tasks are accomplished automatically by telecom system itself
based on human defined control information. At this level, telecom system can
assist human to achieve the closed loop based on human defined control
information.
**Level 3 intermediate autonomous network** : All the execution and awareness
tasks are accomplished automatically by telecom system itself. A part of the
analysis and decision tasks are accomplished automatically by telecom system
itself based on human defined control information. At this level, the telecom
system can achieve the closed loop automation based on the human defined
closed loop automation control information.
**Level 4 advanced autonomous network** : All the execution, awareness,
analysis and decision tasks are accomplished automatically by telecom system
itself. And intent handling tasks can be partly accomplished automatically by
telecom system itself based on human defined intent handling control
information. At this level, telecom system can achieve the intent driven
closed loop automation based on human defined intent handling control
information, which means the telecom system can translate the intent to the
detailed closed loop automation control information and translate the detailed
network and service information to intent fulfilment information (e.g. the
intent is satisfied or not) based on human defined intent handling control
information.
**Level 5 fully autonomous network** : The entire network autonomy workflow is
accomplished automatically by telecom system without human intervention. At
this level, telecom system can achieve the whole network autonomy.
Note 1: Above framework approach for evaluating autonomous network levels is
applicable for evaluating the autonomous network level from both management
scope and scenario perspective. The overall autonomous network level of the
whole telecom system is a comprehensive reflection of autonomous network level
of the individual management scope and scenarios, which means in fully
autonomous network level, the telecom system can achieve the whole network
autonomy for all management scopes and scenarios.
Note 2: The control information in the present document represents the
information which can be formatted as rules or policies to assist/control the
system to perform corresponding tasks in an autonomous manner.
# 6 Use cases and requirements
## 6.1 Network and service planning scenarios
Note: The Network and service planning scenarios is not addressed in the
present document.
## 6.2 Network and service deployment scenarios
### 6.2.1 Autonomous network level for RAN NE deployment
RAN NE deployment use case refers to the entire workflow of deploying an RAN
NE, full autonomy of RAN NE deployment can help the network operator to reduce
OPEX by reducing manual involvement in such tasks. However, full autonomy of
RAN NE deployment is a long term goal, it will be beneficial for operator to
achieve this goal step by step and have clear view on which typical issues can
be addressed by utilizing network autonomy mechanisms in corresponding steps.
The requirements for each autonomous level for RAN NE deployment are
different.
## 6.3 Network and service maintenance scenarios
### 6.3.1 Autonomous network level for fault management
Fault management use case refers to the entire workflow of network fault
management, autonomy of fault management can help the network operator to
reduce OPEX by reducing manual involvement in such tasks and to enhance user
experience and reduce network and service failure time by reducing the time
for network fault supervision and recovery. However, full autonomy of fault
management is a long term goal, it will be beneficial for operator to achieve
this goal step by step and have clear view on which typical issues can be
addressed by utilizing network autonomy mechanism in corresponding steps. The
requirements for each autonomous level for fault management autonomy are
different.
## 6.4 Network and service optimization scenarios
### 6.4.1 Autonomous network level for radio network coverage optimization
Radio networks are geographically distributed, and mobile user activity varies
significantly in different places and at different times of day. To achieve
the optimal coverage, a set of initial coverage configuration parameters (e.g.
coverageShape, digitalTilt and digitalAzimuth) may not always meet the
requirements. Therefore, the coverage configuration parameters need to be
adjusted in a differentiated manner with the change of the radio network
environment. It is complex for the adjustment due to multiple factors needs to
be considered, e.g. interference control, huge data and frequent traffic
changes. So introducing the autonomous network level for radio network
coverage optimization will benefit for operator to achieve the full autonomy
goal step by step and have clear view on which typical issues can be addressed
by utilizing autonomy mechanism in corresponding steps. The requirements for
each autonomous level for radio network coverage optimization are different.
### 6.4.2 Autonomous network level for RAN UE throughput optimization
RAN UE throughput is a key performance for radio network, and, numerous radio
feature parameters with broad value ranges affect the RAN UE throughput. There
are many radio feature parameters of RAN NE level or cell level, for examples,
MLB related parameters, resource schedule related parameters, cell reselection
related parameters, handover related parameters, different radio feature
parameters affect each other and the combination number of various parameter
values is large. Therefore, it is complex to adjust radio feature
configuration parameters to achieve the optimized RAN UE throughput. So
introducing the autonomous network level for RAN UE throughput optimization
will be benefit for operator to achieve the full autonomy goal step by step
and have clear view on which typical issues can be addressed by utilizing
autonomy mechanism in corresponding steps. The requirements for each
autonomous level for RAN UE throughput optimization are different.

## 7.3 Generic autonomous network level for fault management
### 7.3.1 Generic workflow
Following is the generic workflow for fault management:
**Intent handling:**
\- **Task A:** Fault management control information generation. The group of
tasks of generating the fault management related control information (e.g.,
control information for alarm filtering, fault recognition, root cause
analysis, fault recovery) based on fault management intent (e.g. reduce fault
recovery response time to a certain value, reduce network and service failure
times to a certain value within a specific duration).
\- **Task B:** Fault management intent fulfilment evaluation. The group of
tasks of evaluating fault management intent fulfilment information (e.g.
corresponding fault recovery response time is satisfied or not).
**Awareness:**
> \- **Task C:** Fault related information collection. The group of tasks
> which collect the alarm information and other fault related information
> (e.g. performance information and configuration information etc.).
\- **Task D:** Alarm filtering. The group of tasks which filter the alarms
collected in Task C based on the specified alarm filtering control
information. A single network fault may generate a large number of correlative
alarms over space and time, therefore it is considered advantageous to have
methods filtering the redundant alarms. Reporting only effective alarms
without redundant alarms would improve the efficiency of alarm management.
**Analysis:**
\- **Task E:** Fault recognition. The group of tasks which recognize the fault
based on the alarm information and other fault related information.
\- **Task F:** Fault prediction. The group of tasks which predict the
potential fault and its category based on the performance information and
other fault related information.
\- **Task G** : Fault demarcation. The group of tasks which analysis and
determines the fault type and corresponding affected managed object (e.g. NE)
based on the alarm information and other fault related information.
\- **Task H:** Fault root cause analysis (RCA). The group of tasks which
analyse the detailed root cause of the network and service failure.
\- **Task I:** Fault recovery mechanism analysis. The group of tasks which
analyse the possible fault recovery mechanisms based on the fault root cause,
thereby generate the feasible options (e.g. recommended recovery solutions).
**Decision:**
\- **Task J:** Fault management action evaluation and determination. The group
of tasks which evaluate the feasible options and determine the fault recovery
solutions and other corresponding actions (e.g. clear of alarms, storage and
retrieval of alarms).
**Execution:**
\- **Task K:** Fault management action execution. The group of tasks which
execute the fault recovery actions and other corresponding actions.
Note: If the faulty resource has no redundancy (e.g. backup
equipment/board/battery/transport link) and all the fall back recovery actions
are not available nor effective, then the subsequent fault recovery actions
(e.g. replace physical equipment/board/battery, repair the physical
connector/fibre/cable, repair the power supply, etc.) are considered as beyond
the capabilities of the telecom system. And those actions execution is
excluded from the consideration of autonomous network level classification.
### 7.3.2 Generic autonomous network level

information (Task H). For certain network faults, telecom system can also
additionally execute the tasks of fault prediction (Task F), fault recovery
mechanism analysis (Task H) and action evaluation and determination(Task I)
based on specified fault management control information (i.e. control
information for fault prediction, fault recovery mechanism analysis, fault
recovery mechanism decision). The tasks of fault related information
collection (Task C),alarm filtering (Task D), fault recognition (Task E) and
fault demarcation (Task G) are fully accomplished by telecom system.
\- All the other tasks (Task A, Task B) are accomplished by human.
Level 4:
