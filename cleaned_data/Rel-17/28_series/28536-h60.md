**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

#### 4.1.2.3 Class definitions
##### 4.1.2.3.1 AssuranceClosedControlLoop
##### 4.1.2.3.1.1 Definition {#definition .H6}
This class represents the information for controlling and monitoring an
assurance closed control loop associated with a NetworkSlice or
NetworkSliceSubnet. It can be name-contained by SubNetwork or ManagedElement.
To express the assurance closed control loop goals, the MnS consumer needs to
request the MnS producer to create an AssuranceClosedControlLoop on the MnS
producer. The MnS producer may trigger to create the
AssuranceClosedControlLoop as well, for example, when an instance of
NetworkSlice or NetworkSliceSubnet is created, MnS producer may create an
instance of AssuranceClosedControlLoop associated to the instance of
NetworkSlice or NetworkSliceSubnet to assure the target described in
ServiceProfile or SliceProfile. For the deletion of the assurance closed
control loop, the MnS consumer needs to request the MnS producer to delete the
AssuranceClosedControlLoop to free up resources on the MnS producer. MnS
producer also can trigger to delete AssuranceClosedControlLoop to free up
resources by itself.
For temporary deactivation of the assurance closed control loop, the MnS
consumer can modify the value of the administrative state attribute to
"LOCKED". The MnS producer may disable the assurance closed control loop, for
example in conflict situations, by setting the operational state attribute to
"disabled". When a closed control loop is enabled by the MnS producer, the
operational state is set again to "enabled". For the activation of an
assurance closed control loop, the MnS consumer can modify the value of the
administrative state attribute to "UNLOCKED".
An AssuranceClosedControlLoop can name-contain multiple instances of
AssuranceGoal which represents the assurance goal and corresponding observed
or predicted goal fulfilment information (see clause 4.1.2.3.2). The
AssuranceGoal may optionally include an assurance scope in terms of location
(see clause 4.1.2.3.2).
The attribute "controlLoopLifeCyclePhase" is used to keep track of the
lifecycle of an AssuranceClosedControlLoop.
The attribute aCCLDisallowedList is used to descope the ACCL. See clause 6.1.6
of TS 28.535 [17]. Each entry in the list indicates a specific list of
attributes belonging to a managedEntity identified by the
managedEntityIdentifier which the ACCL is not allowed to modify.
##### 4.1.2.3.1.2 Attributes {#attributes .H6}
The AssuranceClosedControlLoop IOC includes attributes inherited from Top IOC
(defined TS 28.622[5]) and the following attributes:

##### 4.1.2.3.1.4 Notifications {#notifications .H6}
The common notifications defined in clause 4.1.2.5 are valid for this IOC,
without exceptions or additions.
##### 4.1.2.3.2 AssuranceGoal
##### 4.1.2.3.2.1 Definition {#definition-1 .H6}
This IOC represents assurance goal.
To express a new assurance goal for the assurance closed control loop, the MnS
consumer needs to request the MnS producer to create an instance of
AssuranceGoal. MnS producer can also trigger the creation of an instance of
AssuranceGoal. For example, when a new instance NetworkSlice or
NetworkSliceSubnet is created on the MnS producer and the corresponding SLS
needs to be assured, a new instance of AssuranceGoal needs to be created and
associated to the new instance NetworkSlice or NetworkSliceSubnet by
configuring the attributes "networkSliceRef" or "networkSliceSubnetRef" and
corresponding attributes "serviceProfileId" and "sliceProfileId".
The attribute "assuranceTargetList" defines a list of assurance targets (the
subset of attributes from an SLS, i.e. a ServiceProfile or a SliceProfile,
that are subject to assurance requirements.) that should be assured by the
AssuranceClosedControlLoop. The attribute "assuranceTargetList" is configured
by MnS producer based on the specified ServiceProfile or SliceProfile.
NOTE: Multiple instances of AssuranceGoal can be created for a single instance
of NetworkSlice or NetworkSliceSubnet.
##### 4.1.2.3.2.2 Attributes {#attributes-1 .H6}
The AssuranceGoal IOC includes attributes inherited from Top IOC (defined TS
28.622[5]) and the following attributes:

##### 4.1.2.3.6.1 Definition {#definition-3 .H6}
This data type represents the observed and/or predicted AssuranceGoal
fulfilment status.
To obtain the observed predicted status of the the goal fulfilment
information, the MnS consumer can query the attributes
"AssuranceGoalStatusObserved" and "AssuranceGoalStatusPredicted"from MnS
producer. The attributes "AssuranceGoalStatusObserved" and
"AssuranceGoalStatusPredicted" are configured by MnS producer at the end of an
observation period. The observation period is assigned by MnS consumer through
requesting the MnS producer to set attribute "observationTime". The status of
the goal fuilfilment is considered FULFILLED if all the constituent targets
are FULFILLED.

### 4.1.3 Procedures
#### 4.1.3.1 SLS Assurance Procedure
Figure 4.1.3.1.1 SLS assurance procedure
For the purpose of the procedure shown in Figure 4.1.3.1.1 \"entities
participating in the loop\" refers to any entity in the 3GPP management system
responsible for the functioning of an ACCL to ensure the
AssuranceControlLoopGoal required by an AssuranceControlLoop_Consumer.
1\. AssuranceControlLoop_consumer derives AssuranceControlLoopGoal from the
ServiceProfile or SliceProfile.
2\. AssuranceControlLoop_consumer provides the AssuranceControlLoopGoal to
Entities_Participating_in_loop by utilizing the provision management services
defined in as defined in clause 11.1.1.3 of TS 28.532 [7].
NOTE 1: In case the Entities_Participating_in_loop represents
CrossDomain_Entities_Participating_in_loop, the AssuranceControlLoopGoal is
the attribute(s) of the ServiceProfile. In case the
Entities_Participating_in_loop represents
Domain_Entities_Participating_in_loop, the AssuranceControlLoopGoal is the
attribute(s) of the SliceProfile.
3\. Entities_Participating_in_loop subscribes the related performance data
(e.g., the packet delay related measurements), fault data, QoE data (e.g.,
buffer level) and MDT data from respective sources by utilizing the Operation
establishStreamingConnection as defined in clause 6.2.1 of TS 28.550 [3].
4\. Entities_Participating_in_loop, optionally, subscribes the related
analytical data from MDAS producer or network functions, e.g., NWDAF. In case
of NWDAF as a provider, Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription Service as defined in clause
4.2 of TS 29.520 [11] is used.
5\. Entities_Participating_in_loop collects the related performance, fault,
QoE and MDT data (e.g., the packet delay related measurements), fault data,
QoE data (e.g., buffer level) and MDT data from respective sources by
utilizing the Operation establishStreamingConnection as defined in clause
6.2.1 of TS 28.550 [3].
6\. Entities_Participating_in_loop, optionally, collects the related
analytical data from MDAS producer or network functions, e.g., NWDAF. In case
of NWDAF as a provider, Nnwdaf_EventsSubscription Service as defined in clause
4.2 of TS 29.520 [11] is used.
7\. Entities_Participating_in_loop assesses if the AssuranceControlLoopGoal
has been fulfilled.
8\. Entities_Participating_in_loop assesses if and which action to take in
case the AssuranceControlLoopGoal has not been fulfilled.
9\. As per the mitigation action (e.g., scale out) resources are changed, the
generic provisioning management service as defined in clause 11.1 of TS 28.532
[7] is utilized for the same.
10\. Action completed.
NOTE 2: The Entities_Participating_in_loop continues to monitor and analyse
the performance and perform the adjustment until the attribute(s) of
SliceProfile is assured.
11\. AssuranceControlLoop_consumer receives the confirmation of assurance
fulfilment from Entities_Participating_in_loop by utilizing the provision
management services defined in clause 11.1.1.3 of TS 28.532 [7].
## 4.2 Stage 3
### 4.2.1 Solution Set (SS) for JSON/YAML
The JSON/YAML solution set is documented in clause B.2.
###### ## Annex A (informative): Control loop deployed in different layers
## A.1 Introduction
This example gives a high-level view of control loops deployed in different
layers, which consists of control loop in communication service layer, control
loop in network slice layer, control loop in network slice subnet layer and
control loop in NF layer, as described as Figure A.1.1, where the analytic
could be leverage MDAS, and different control loops can provide input
(interact with) to other control loops (in the same layer or different layers)
and obtain the output from other control loops (in the same layer or different
layers).
{width="4.7in" height="2.8in"}
Figure A.1.1: Control loop in different layers
## A.2 Control loop in communication service layer
SLA/SLS requirements provided from CSC are translated into serviceProfile,
which represents the requirements for communication service assurance to the
CSP. Coordination between control loop in communication service layer and
control loop in network slice layer is needed to calculate the communication
service resource requirements and to assure the communication service SLA/SLS
requirements.
When the communication service is active, network slice performance is
monitored and analysed for the communication service according to end user
service experiences.
If service degradation occurs or it is predicted, the 3GPP management system
could take actions, i.e. the allocated resources are scaled up or the SLS is
adjusted based on pre-agreement/interaction between CSP and CSC.
## A.3 Control loop in network slice layer
After receiving SLA/SLS requirements from service profile and completing the
network slice provisioning, the network slice performance (e.g. KPI, QoE) are
monitored and reported. Compared to the SLA/SLS requirements from service
profile, when network slice performance is not met, the 3GPP management system
identifies the root cause and may reconfigure the resources according to
analytical report from MDAS producer. The network slice resources are also
modified accordantly in case the network slice performance requirement needs
to be changed based on communication service requirement adjustment.
## A.4 Control loop in network slice subnet layer
After decomposing service profile to slice profile, the performance
requirements for each network slice subnet are obtained. The 3GPP management
system could have the capability of service observation (e.g., the supervision
to the NSSI) based on MDAS. Based on such observation and comparison with
initial subnet performance requirements, management actions on the NSSI might
be performed if NSSI performance requirements fulfillment indicates a problem.
Another possible scenario is that, when the NSSI performance requirement is
changed because of the network slice modification management action, the NSSI
resources might be also reconfigured.
## A.5 Control loop in NF layer
NOTE: The control loop in NF layer is not addressed in the present document.

###### ## Annex C (normative): AssuranceClosedControlLoop state management
An AssuranceClosedControlLoop is a logical object in the management system
that represents complex interaction between the assurance information and
configuration information of a grouping of resources. At any time, the
management system needs to know the state of an AssuranceClosedControlLoop.
The ITU-T X.731 [15], to which [14] refers, has defined the inter-relation
between the administrative state and operational state of systems in general.
Figure X.1 shows the state diagram of an AssuranceClosedControlLoop, where the
number in the Figure identify the state changes. The explanations for the
state changes are described in Table C.1.
Figure C.1: AssuranceClosedControlLoop state diagram
In an AssuranceClosedControlLoop deployment scenario, the interactions between
various management services allow the reconfiguration of the resources
controlled by the AssuranceClosedControlLoop based on predefined goal(s). The
interactions specified under the column \"The state transition events and
actions\" of Table C.1 shall be present for the state transition.
Table C.1: The AssuranceClosedControlLoop state transition table
+----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+ | Trigger number | The state transition | State | | | events and actions | | +================+=========================+=========================+ | 0 | The Assurance MnS | Locked & Disabled | | | producer responds | | | | positively to the | | | | "create ACCL\" message, | | | | the ACCL is created and | | | | the state is set to | | | | Locked | | +----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+ | 1 | The Assurance MnS | _Locked & Enabled_ | | | producer has assurance | | | | goals to fulfil and | | | | starts or resumes | | | | operation by setting | | | | the operational state | | | | to Enabled | | +----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+ | 2 | The Assurance MnS | _Locked_ | | | consumer suspends | | | | operation of the ACCL | _(Enabled or Disabled)_ | | | by setting the | | | | adminstrative state to | | | | Locked | | +----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+ | 3 | The Assurance MnS | _Unlocked_ | | | consumer resumes | | | | operation of the ACCL | _(Enabled or Disabled)_ | | | by setting the | | | | administrative state to | | | | Unlocked. | | +----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+ | 4 | The Assurance MnS | _Disabled_ | | | producer does not have | | | | any assurance goals to | _(Locked or Unlocked)_ | | | fulfil and suspends | | | | operation by setting | | | | the operational state | | | | to Disabled | | +----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+ | 5 | The Assurance MnS | _NULL_ | | | producer responds | | | | positively to the | | | | "delete ACCL\" message, | | | | the ACCL is deleted, | | | | and the state is set to | | | | NULL (the Initial and | | | | Final state) | | +----------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
