**28.402 Performance Management (PM); Performance measurements for Evolved
Packet Core (EPC) and non-3GPP access Interworking System**
The present document is part of a set of specifications, which describe the
requirements and information model necessary for the standardized Operation,
Administration and Maintenance (OA&M) of the Evolved Packet Core (EPC) and
non-3GPP access Interworking System (TS 23.402 [4]).
During the lifetime of EPC and non-3GPP access network interworking, its
logical and physical configuration undergo changes of varying degrees and
frequencies in order to optimize the utilization of the network resources.
These changes are executed through network configuration management activities
and/or network engineering, see TS 32.600 [1].
Many of the activities involved in the daily operation and future network
planning of interworking require data on which to base decisions. This data
refers to the load carried by the network and the grade of service offered. In
order to produce this data performance measurements are executed in the NEs,
which comprise the network. The data can then be transferred to an external
system, e.g. an Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology, for further
evaluation.
Annex B of TS 32.404 [2] helps in the definition of new performance
measurements that can be submitted to 3GPP for potential adoption and
inclusion in the present document. Annex B of TS 32.404 [2] discusses a top-
down performance measurement definition methodology that focuses on how the
end-user of performance measurements can use the measurements.
# 1 Scope
The present document describes the measurements for EPC and non-3GPP access
network interworking.
TS 32.401 [3] describes Performance Management concepts and requirements.
The present document is valid for all measurement types provided by an
implementation of EPC and non-3GPP access Interworking System. Only
measurement types that are specific to EPC and non-3GPP access interworking
are defined within the present documents. Vendor specific measurement types
used in EPC and non-3GPP access Interworking System are not covered. Instead,
these could be applied according to manufacturer\'s documentation.
Measurements related to \"external\" technologies (such as ATM or IP) as
described by \"external\" standards bodies (e.g. ITU-T or IETF) are only be
referenced within this specification, wherever there is a need identified for
the existence of such a reference.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network, for
those measurement types that can be standardised across all vendors\'
implementations.
The structure of the present document is as follows:
\- Header 1: Network Element (e.g. measurements related to ePDG);
\- Header 2: Measurement function (e.g. Tunnel establishment);
\- Header 3: Measurements.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Use cases for performance measurements
definition
This annex provides the use cases for the EPC and non-3GPP access Interworking
System performance measurements defined in clause 4 and clause 5.
# A.1 Use case for tunnel establishment measurements
**It needs to** setup secure tunnels between non-3GPP UE and remote tunnel
endpoint once UE attaches to interworking system. The tunnel resides between
the non-3GPP UE and ePDG. In order to guarantee the user experiences, the
tunnel should be established before the data is transmitted. During the period
of tunnel establishment, ePDG may reject the tunnel establishment due to QoS
profile request or policy enforcement in AAA servers. Those rejections would
impact subsequent traffic transmission and user experiences.\ It is desirable
for operators to get the indications before massive rejection happened.
# A.2 Use case for attached subscribers measurement
Non-3GPP UE attach status indicates whether the non-3GPP UE is now being
served by the EPC.\ The non-3GPP UE attach status is maintained by the 3GPP
AAA Server. In the attached state, the UE can initiate packets and receive
services via EPC and non-3GPP access network interworking. Operators need to
have the knowledge of the number of attached subscribers in AAA server or AAA
proxy server to evaluate the capacity status of servers.
