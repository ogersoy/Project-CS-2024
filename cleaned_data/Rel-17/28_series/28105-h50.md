# 4 Concepts and overview
## 4.1 Overview
The AI/ML techniques and relevant applications are being increasingly adopted
by the wider industries and proved to be successful. These are now being
applied to telecommunication industry including mobile networks.
Although AI/ML techniques in general are quite mature nowadays, some of the
relevant aspects of the technology are still evolving while new complementary
techniques are frequently emerging.
The AI/ML techniques can be generally characterized from different
perspectives including the followings:
\- **Learning methods**
The learning methods include supervised learning, semi-supervised learning,
unsupervised learning and reinforcement learning. Each learning method fits
one or more specific category of inference (e.g. prediction), and requires
specific type of training data. A brief comparison of these learning methods
is provided in table 4.1-1.

**\- Learning complexity:**
\- As per the learning complexity, there are Machine Learning (i.e. basic
learning) and Deep Learning.
**\- Learning architecture**
\- Based on the topology and location where the learning tasks take place, the
AI/ML can be categorized to centralized learning, distributed learning and
federated learning.
**\- Learning continuity**
\- From learning continuity perspective, the AI/ML can be offline learning or
continual learning.
Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) capabilities are used in
various domains in 5GS, including management and orchestration (e.g. MDA, see
3GPP TS 28.104 [2]) and 5G networks (e.g. NWDAF, see 3GPP TS 23.288 [3]).
The AI/ML-inference function in the 5GS uses the ML model and/or AI decision
entity for inference.
Each AI/ML technique, depending on the adopted specific characteristics as
mentioned above, may be suitable for supporting certain type/category of use
case(s) in 5GS.
To enable and facilitate the AI/ML capabilities with the suitable AI/ML
techniques in 5GS, the ML model and AI/ML inference function need to be
managed.
The present document specifies the AI/ML management related capabilities and
services, which include the followings:
\- ML training.
# 4A AI/ML management functionality and service framework
## 4A.1 Functionality and service framework for ML training
An ML training Function playing the role of ML training MnS producer, may
consume various data for ML training purpose.
As illustrated in Figure 5.1-1 the ML training capability is provided via ML
training MnS in the context of SBMA to the authorized consumer(s) by ML
training MnS producer.

# 6 AI/ML management use cases and requirements
## 6.1 General
The use cases and requirements for AI/ML management are specified in the
following clauses.
## 6.2 ML training
### 6.2.1 Description
In operational environment before the ML entity is deployed to conduct
inference, the ML model associated with the ML entity needs to be trained
(e.g. by ML training function which may be a separate or an external entity to
the AI/ML inference function).
NOTE: In the present document, ML entity training refers to ML model training
associated with an ML entity.
The ML Entity is trained by the ML training (MLT) MnS producer, and the
training can be triggered by request(s) from one or more MLT MnS consumer(s),
or initiated by the MLT MnS producer (e.g. as result of model evaluation).
### 6.2.2 Use cases
#### 6.2.2.1 ML training requested by consumer
The ML training capabilities are provided by an MLT MnS producer to one or
more consumer(s).
Figure 6.2.2.1-1: ML training requested by MLT MnS consumer
The ML training may be triggered by the request(s) from one or more MLT MnS
consumer(s). The consumer may be for example a network function, a management
function, an operator, or another functional differentiation To trigger an ML
training, the MLT MnS consumer requests the MLT MnS producer to train the ML
model. In the ML training request, the consumer should specify the inference
type which indicates the function or purpose of the ML entity, e.g.
CoverageProblemAnalysis. The **MLT** MnS producer can perform the training
according to the designated inference type. The consumer may provide the data
source(s) that contain(s) the training data which are considered as inputs
candidates for training. To obtain the valid training outcomes, consumers may
also designate their requirements for model performance (e.g. accuracy, etc)
in the training request.
The **MLT** MnS producer provides a response to the consumer indicating
whether the request was accepted.
If the request is accepted, the **MLT MnS producer decides when to start the
ML training with consideration of the request(s) from the consumer(s). Once
the training is decided, the producer performs the followings:**
\- selects the training data, with consideration of the consumer provided
candidate training data. Since the training data directly influences the
algorithm and performance of the trained ML Entity, the MLT MnS producer may
examine the consumer\'s provided training data and decide to select none, some
or all of them. In addition, the MLT MnS producer may select some other
training data that are available;
\- trains the ML entity using the selected training data;
\- provides the training results to the MLT MnS consumer(s).
#### 6.2.2.2 ML training initiated by producer
The ML training may be initiated by the MLT MnS producer, for instance as a
result of performance evaluation of the ML model, based on feedback or new
training data received from the consumer, or when new training data which are
not from the consumer describing the new network status/events become
available.
When the **MLT MnS producer decides to start the ML training, the producer
performs the followings:**
\- selects the training data;
\- trains the ML entity using the selected training data;
\- provides the training results to the MLT MnS consumer(s) who have
subscribed to receive the ML training results.
#### 6.2.2.3 ML model and and ML entity selection
For a given machine learning-based use case, different entities that apply the
respective ML model or AI/ML inference function may have different inference
requirements and capabilities. For example, one consumer with specific
responsibility and wish to have an AI/ML inference function supported by an ML
model or entity trained for city central business district where mobile users
move at speeds not exceeding 30 km/hr. On the other hand, another consumer,
for the same use case may support a rural environment and as such wishes to
have an ML model and AI/ML inference function fitting that type of
environment. The different consumers need to know the available versions of ML
entities, with the variants of trained ML models or entities and to select the
appropriate one for their respective conditions.
Besides, there is no guarantee that the available ML models/entities have been
trained according to the characteristics that the consumers expect. As such
the consumers need to know the conditions for which the ML models or ML
entities have been trained to then enable them to select the models that are
best fit to their conditions and needs.
The models that have been trained may differ in terms of complexity and
performance. For example, a generic comprehensive and complex model may have
been trained in a cloud-like environment but such a model cannot be used in
the gNB and instead, a less complex model, trained as a derivative of this
generic model, could be a better candidate. Moreover, multiple less complex
models could be trained with different levels of complexity and performance
which would then allow different relevant models to be delivered to different
network functions depending on operating conditions and performance
requirements. The network functions need to know the alternative models
available and interactively request and replace them when needed and depending
on the observed inferenceâ€‘related constraints and performance requirements.
#### 6.2.2.4 Managing ML training processes
_This machine learning capability relates to means for managing and
controlling ML model/entity training processes_.
To achieve the desired outcomes of any machine learning relevant use-case, the
ML model applied for such analytics and decision making, needs to be trained
with the appropriate data. The training may be undertaken in a managed
function or in a management function.
In either case, the network (or the OAM system thereof) not only needs to have
the required training capabilities but needs to also have the means to manage
the training of the ML models/entities. The consumers need to be able to
interact with the training process, e.g. , to suspend or restart the process;
and also need to manage and control the requests related to any such training
process.
#### 6.2.2.5 Handling errors in data and ML decisions
Traditionally, the ML models/entities (e.g. , ML entity1 and ML entity2 in
figure 6.2.2.5-1) are trained on good quality data, i.e. , data that were
collected correctly and reflected the real network status to represent the
expected context in which the ML entity is meant to operate. Good quality data
is void of errors, such as:
**-** Imprecise measurements, with added noise (such as RSRP, SINR, or QoE
estimations).
**-** Missing values or entire records, e.g. , because of communication link
failures.
**-** Records which are communicated with a significant delay (in case of
online measurements).
Without errors, an ML entity can depend on a few precise inputs, and does not
need to exploit the redundancy present in the training data. However, during
inference, the ML entity is very likely to come across these inconsistencies.
When this happens, the ML entity shows high error in the inference outputs,
even if redundant and uncorrupted data are available from other sources.
Figure 6.2.2.5-1: The propagation of erroneous information
As such the system needs to account for errors and inconsistencies in the
input data and the consumers should deal with decisions that are made based on
such erroneous and inconsistent data. The system should:
1) enable functions to undertake the training in a way that prepares the ML
entities to deal with the errors in the training data, i.e. , to identify the
errors in the data during training;
2) enable the MLT MnS consumers to be aware of the possibility of erroneous
input data that are used by the ML entity.

#### 7.3.2.1 Definition
The IOC MLTrainingRequest represents the ML model training request that is
created by the ML training MnS consumer.
The MLTrainingRequest MOI is contained under one MLTrainingFunction MOI. Each
MLTrainingRequest is associated to at least one MLEntity.
The MLTrainingRequest may have a source to identify where it is coming from,
and which may be used to prioritize the training resources for different
sources. The sources may be for example the network functions, operator roles,
or other functional differentiations.
Each MLTrainingRequest may indicate the expectedRunTimeContext that describes
the specific conditions for which the MLEntity should be trained.
In case the request is accepted, the ML training **MnS producer decides when
to start the ML training. Once the MnS producer decides to start the training
based on the request, the ML training MnS producer instantiates one or more
MLTrainingProcess MOI(s) that are responsible to perform the followings:**
\- collects (more) data for training, if the training data are not available
or the data are available but not sufficient for the training;
\- prepares and selects the required training data, with consideration of the
consumer's request provided candidate training data if any. The ML training
MnS producer may examine the consumer\'s provided candidate training data and
select none, some or all of them for training. In addition, the ML training
MnS producer may select some other training data that are available in order
to meet the consumer's requirements for the MLentity training;
\- trains the MLEntity using the selected and prepared training data.
The MLTrainingRequest may have a requestStatus field to represent the status
of the specific MLTrainingRequest:
**-** The attribute values are \"NOT_STARTED\", \"TRAINING_IN_PROGRESS\",
\"SUSPENDED\", \"FINISHED\", and \"CANCELLED\".
\- When value turns to \"TRAINING_IN_PROGRESS\", the ML training MnS producer
instantiates one or more MLTrainingProcess MOI(s) representing the training
process(es) being performed per the request and notifies the MLT MnS
consumer(s) who subscribed to the notification.
When all of the training process associated to this request are completed, the
value turns to \"FINISHED\".

#### 7.3.3.4 Notifications
The common notifications defined in clause 7.6 are valid for this IOC, without
exceptions or additions.
### 7.3.4 MLTrainingProcess
#### 7.3.4.1 Definition
The IOC MLTrainingProcess represents the ML training process.
One MLTrainingProcess MOI may be instantiated for each MLTrainingRequest MOI
or a set of MLTrainingRequest MOIs.
For each MLEntity under training, a MLTrainingProcess is instantiated, i.e. an
MLTrainingProcess is associated with exactly one MLEntity. The
MLTrainingProcess may be associated with one or more MLTrainingRequest MOI.
The MLTrainingProcess does not have to correspond to a specific
MLTrainingRequest, i.e. a MLTrainingRequest does not have to be associated to
a specific MLTrainingProcess. The MLTrainingProcess may be managed separately
from the MLTrainingRequest MOIs, e.g. the MLTrainingRequest MOI may come from
consumers which are network functions while the operator may wish to manage
the MLTrainingProcess that is instantiated following the requests. Thus, the
MLTrainingProcess may be associated to either one or more MLTrainingRequest
MOI.
Each MLTrainingProcess instance needs to be managed differently from the
related MLEntity, although the MLTrainingProcess may be associated to only one
MLEntity. For example, the MLTrainingProcess may be triggered to start with a
specific version of the MLEntity and multiple MLTrainingProcess instances may
be triggered for different versions of the MLEntity. In either case the
MLTrainingProcesse instances are still associated with the same MLEntity but
are managed separately from the MLEntity.
Each MLTrainingProcess has a priority that may be used to prioritize the
execution of different MLTrainingProcesse instances. By default, the priority
of the MLTrainingProcess may be related in a 1:1 manner with the priority of
the MLTrainingRequest for which the MLTrainingProcess is instantiated.
Each MLTrainingProcess may have one or more termination conditions used to
define the points at which the MLTrainingProcess may terminate.
The \"progressStatus\" attribute represents the status of the ML model
training and includes information the ML training MnS consumer can use to
monitor the progress and results. The data type of this attribute is
\"ProcessMonitor\" (see 3GPP TS 28.622 [12]). The following specializations
are provided for this data type for the ML training process:
**-** The \"**status** \" attribute values are \"RUNNING\", \"CANCELLING\",
\"SUSPENDED\", \"FINISHED\", and \"CANCELLED\". The other values are not used.
**-** The \"**timer** \" attribute is not used.
\- When the \"status\" is equal to \"RUNNING\" the \"progressStateInfo\"
attribute shall indicate one of the following states: \"COLLECTING_DATA\",
\"PREPARING_TRAINING_DATA\", \"TRAINING\".
\- No specifications are provided for the \"resultStateInfo\" attribute.
Vendor specific information may be provided though.
When the training is completed with \"**status** \" equal to \"FINISHED\", the
MLT MnS producer provides the training report, by creating an MLTrainingReport
MOI, to the MLT MnS consumer.
