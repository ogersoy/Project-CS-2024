# 4 Concepts and background
## 4.1 SON concepts
### 4.1.1 Overview
Based on the location of the SON algorithm, SON is categorized into four
different solutions that are possible for implementing various SON use cases,
the solution is selected depending on the needs of the SON use cases.
a) Centralized SON:
1) Cross Domain-Centralized SON
2) Domain-Centralized SON
b) Distributed SON
c) Hybrid SON.
The SON algorithm is not standardized by 3GPP.
The following figure illustrates the overview of SON Framework.
{width="3.388888888888889in" height="2.576388888888889in"}
Figure 4.1.1-1: Overview of SON Framework
### 4.1.2 Centralized SON
#### 4.1.2.1 Introduction
Centralized SON (C-SON) means that the SON algorithm executes in the 3GPP
management system. The centralized SON concept has been defined for LTE in TS
32.500 [2].
Figure 4.1.2.1-1 shows a generic C-SON process, where the SON algorithms
execute in the 3GPP management system interact with network functions in RAN
and/or CN to implement SON functions. The SON algorithm may consist of the
following functionalities:
> \- Monitoring: monitor the network(s) by collecting management data,
> including the data provided by MDAS.
>
> \- Analysis: analyse the management data to determine if there are issues in
> the network(s) that need to be resolved.
>
> \- Decision: makes the decision on the SON actions to resolve the issues.
\- Execution: execute the SON actions.
\- Evaluation: evaluate whether the issues have been solved by analysing the
management data
NOTE: The management data as well as the exact algorithm may vary for
different SON cases. For example, for automated creation of NSI, NSSI and/or
NFs related cases, the management data may be SLA requirements received from
service management layer; for automated optimization related cases, the
management data may be performance measurements of the networks; for automated
healing related cases, the management data may be alarm information of the
networks. The management data and the algorithm are to be specified case by
case.
Figure 4.1.2.1-1: C-SON process
#### 4.1.2.2 Cross Domain-Centralized SON
The Cross Domain-Centralized SON means that the SON algorithm executes in the
3GPP Cross Domain layer.
For Cross Domain-Centralized SON, the MnF(s) in 3GPP Cross Domain layer
monitors the networks via management data, analyses the management data, makes
decisions on the SON actions, and executes the SON actions.
#### 4.1.2.3 Domain-Centralized SON
The Domain-Centralized SON means the SON algorithm executes in the Domain
layer.
For Domain-Centralized SON, the MnF(s) in Domain layer monitors the networks
via management data, analyses the management data, makes decisions on the SON
actions, and executes the SON actions.
The MnF(s) in 3GPP Cross Domain is responsible for management and control of
the Domain-Centralized SON function. The management and control may include
switching on/off a Domain-Centralized SON function, making policies for a
Domain-Centralized SON function, and/or evaluating the performance of a
Domain-Centralized SON function.
### 4.1.3 Distributed SON
The distributed SON (D-SON) means that the SON algorithm is located in the
NFs. The distributed SON concept has been defined for LTE in TS 32.500 [2].
For D-SON, the NFs monitors the network events, analyses the network data,
makes decisions on the SON actions and executes the SON actions in the network
nodes.
Figure 4.1.3-1 shows that the 3GPP management system (MnF in Domain or 3GPP
Cross Domain) is responsible for the following functions:
a) D-SON management function:
1) Switch on/off a D-SON function,
2) Provide policies, targets, and supplementary information (e.g., the range
attributes) for a D-SON function.
b) D-SON evaluation function: evaluate whether the issues have been resolved,
and may apply D-SON management actions.
Figure 4.1.3-1: D-SON process
### 4.1.4 Hybrid SON
The hybrid SON (H-SON) means the SON algorithm are executed at two or more of
the following levels: NF layer, Domain layer or 3GPP Cross Domain layer. The
hybrid SON concept has been defined for LTE in TS 32.500 [2].
The 3GPP management system (i.e. MnF(s) in Domain or 3GPP Cross Domain) and
NFs work together, in a coordinated manner, to build up a complete SON
algorithm. The decisions on SON actions may be made by 3GPP management system
and/or NFs, depending on the specific cases.
Figure 4.1.4-1 shows that the C-SON component is monitoring and executes SON
actions.

## 4.2 Self-establishment of new RAN NE in network
### 4.2.1 Introduction
Self-establishment of new RAN NE in network describes the procedure of a new
NG-RAN NE can automatically establish when it is powered up and connect to the
IP network in multi-vendor scenario, which includes:
\- Network Configuration data handling
\- Plug and connect to management system
\- Self-Configuration
### 4.2.2 Network configuration data handling
Network configuration data handling makes the network configuration data
available to the management system support self-configuration process, which
may include network configuration data preparation, network configuration data
transfer and network configuration data validation. This happens except all of
the network configuration data for NE can be generated by the management
system supporting self-configuration process.
**Network configuration data preparation:** This makes the network
configuration data ready in operator\'s network management system who provides
the network configuration data. How to prepare the network configuration data
in operator\'s network management system is out of scope of the present
document.
**Network configuration data transfer:** This transfers the Network
configuration data from network configuration data Provider to the network
configuration data Consumer.
**Network configuration data validation:** This validates the syntax and
semantics of network configuration data. It takes place in the network
configuration data Consumer.
### 4.2.3 Plug and connect to management system
Plug and connect to management system connects the NE to its management system
providing support for self-configuration process as automatically as possible.
The concepts and requirements of plug and connect are specified in TS 28.314
[22].
### 4.2.4 Self-configuration
Self-configuration puts the NE into a state to be ready to carry traffic in an
automated manner. Self-configuration includes following functionality: create
self-configuration task, monitor self-configuration process, generate
configuration data if needed, download and activate software, download and
active configuration data, perform self-test and update network resource
model, etc.

{width="5.208333333333333in" height="5.104166666666667in"}
Figure 8.3.2.2-1: Procedures for self-configuration management
1\. MnS consumer of self-configuration management sends
createScManagementProfile request for NE(s) of a certain type to MnS producer
of self-configuration management. NE information, stop point information and
step information may be included in the request.
2\. MnS producer of self-configuration management creates ScManagementProfile
instance for NE(s) specified in the received request.
3\. MnS producer of self-configuration management sends the create
ScManagementProfile response to MnS producer of self-configuration management.
4\. For each NE (specified in the created ScManagementProfile) starting its
self-configuration process, MnS producer of self-configuration management
sends NotifyScProcessCreation notification to MnS consumer of self-
configuration management.
5\. When arrival at a stop point (e.g. stop point waiting for the network
configuration data) or step described in corresponding ScManagementProfile,
MnS producer of self-configuration management sends NotifyProcessStage
notification to MnS consumer of self-configuration management.
6\. If arrival at a stop point in step 5), MnS consumer of self-configuration
management sends ResumeScProcess request to MnS producer of self-configuration
management. If the self-configuration process is suspended at a stop point and
is waiting for the network configuration data, the request include network
configuration data or information indicating location of network configuration
data.
7\. When the self-configuration process is terminated, the MnS producer of
self-configuration management sends NotifyScProcessDeletion notification to
MnS consumer of self-configuration management.
### 8.3.3 RRM resources optimization for network slice instance(s)
Figure 8.3.3-1 depicts an example of network slice instances that are created
to support various services, such as URLLC, eMBB, or mMTC with different RRM
resources requirements, where network slice instances sNSSAI #2-1 and sNSSAI
#2-2 support a kind of RRM requirements, while network slice instances sNSSAI
#1 supports different RRM requirements. It shows that the RRM resources
provided by network functions of DU, CUUP, and CUCP are characterized by
_RRMPolicyRatio_ IOC with rRMPolicyMaxRatio, rRMPolicyMinRatio, and
rRMPolicyDedicatedRatio attributes to define the shared resources, prioritized
resources, and dedicated resources for network slice instance(s) (see clause
4.3.36.1 in TS 28.541 [13]).
The _RRMPolicyRatio_ IOC has a base class _RRMPolicy_ IOC that contains
resourceType (i.e. PRB for DU, DRB for CUUP, and RRC connected user for CUCP)
and rRMPolicyMemberList that contains the network slice instance(s) subject to
this policy (see clause 4.3.43 in TS 28.541 [13]). A network function may have
one or more _RRMPolicyRatio_ MOI(s) where each _RRMPolicyRatio_ MOI is
associated with network slice instance(s) that share the same RRM resource
requirements.
Figure 8.3.3-1: RRM policies for multiple network slice instances
It is assumed that the C-SON function has consumed the MnS of performance
assurance to create PM jobs to collect RRM related measurements from RAN
nodes, such as DU, CUCP, and CUUP where the network slice instances are
created, and an AI/ML model has been created based on the use plane and
control plane information (e.g. traffic loads and patterns) that are collected
from the RRM related performance measurements received previously.
Figure 8.3.3-2: RRM resources optimization procedure
1\. The C-SON function consumes the performance assurance MnS to receive the
measurements (e.g. mean and peak numbers of PRB usage on DL / UL, average DL /
UL UE throughput in gNB, distribution of DL / UL UE throughput in gNB) from NF
DU to monitor the performance of network slice instances identified by sNSSAI
#1 and sNSSAI #2.
2\. The C-SON function consumes the performance assurance MnS to receive the
measurements (e.g. such as mean and peak numbers of DRBs successfully setup)
from NF CUUP to monitor the performance of network slice instances identified
by sNSSAI #1 and sNSSAI #2.
3\. The C-SON function consumes the performance assurance MnS to receive the
measurements (e.g. mean numbers of PDU Sessions requested to setup, mean
numbers of PDU Sessions successfully setup) from NF CUCP to monitor the
performance of network slice instances identified by sNSSAI #1 and sNSSAI #2.
4\. The C-SON function analyzes the measurements to train the AI/ML model and
determines the actions if needed to optimize the RRM resources for network
slice instance(s) that include consuming the MnS of provisioning to update the
_RRMPolicyRatio_ corresponding to the specific network slice instance(s).
If the RRM resources for network slice instances at DU need update, then the
following steps are executed:
5\. The C-SON function consumes the MnS of NF provisioning with
_modifyMOIAttributes_ operation to re-configure the _RRMPolicyRatio_ for the
NF DU.
5.a The MnS of NF provisioning updates _RRMPolicyRatio_ at the NF DU.
6\. The producer of provisioning MnS sends a notification
_notifyMOIAttributeValueChange_ to C-SON function with sourceIndicator =
SON_operation, attributeValueChange = \
to indicate the successful _RRMPolicyRatio_ update.
If the RRM resources for network slice instances at CUUP need update, then the
following steps are executed:
7\. The C-SON function consumes the MnS of NF provisioning with
_modifyMOIAttributes_ operation to re-configure the _RRMPolicyRatio_ for the
NF CUUP.
7.a The MnS of NF provisioning updates _RRMPolicyRatio_ at the NF CUUP.
8\. The producer of provisioning MnS sends a notification
_notifyMOIAttributeValueChange_ to C-SON function with sourceIndicator =
SON_operation, attributeValueChange = \
to indicate the successful _RRMPolicyRatio_ update.
If the RRM resources for network slice instances at CUCP need update, then the
following steps are executed:
9\. The C-SON function consumes the MnS of NF provisioning with
_modifyMOIAttributes_ operation to re-configure the _RRMPolicyRatio_ for the
NF CUCP.
9.a The MnS of NF provisioning updates _RRMPolicyRatio_ at the NF CUCP.
10\. The producer of provisioning MnS sends a notification
_notifyMOIAttributeValueChange_ to C-SON function to indicate the successful
_RRMPolicyRatio_ update.
NOTE: The interface between producer of provisioning MnS and NFs is not
subject to standardization.
### 8.3.4 Centralized Capacity and Coverage Optimization (CCO)
Figure 8.3.4-1 depicts the procedure of centralized capacity and coverage
optimization. It is assumed that PM job control and provisioning have been
executed to allow C-SON function to receive performance measurements, MDT,
RLF, and RCEF reports.
Figure 8.3.4-1: Capacity and coverage optimization procedure
1\. The C-SON function receives the measurements, as listed in clause
7.2.3.3.1, which are used to detect the capacity and coverage issues in NR
cells.
2\. The C-SON function receives MDT, RLF, and RCEF reports, as listed in
clause 7.2.3.3.2, which are used to detect the capacity and coverage issues in
NR cells.
3\. The C-SON function analyzes the measurements, MDT, RLF, and RCEF reports
to determine whether the capacity and coverage of given cells or beams need to
be optimized.
> If the capacity and coverage of given cells or beams need to be optimized,
> then the following steps are executed:
>
> 4\. The C-SON function determine the actions to mitigate the CCO issues.

>
> 7\. The C-SON function collects the measurements.
>
> 8\. The C-SON function analyzes the measurements to evaluate if the COO
> issues have been mitigated.
