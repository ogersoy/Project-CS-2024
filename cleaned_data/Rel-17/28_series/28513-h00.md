# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.

defined in the present document takes precedence over the definition of the
same abbreviation, if any, in 3GPP TR 21.905 [1] or in 3GPP TS 28.500 [2].
# 4 Interface definitions
## 4.1 Itf-N
For Itf-N configuration management of virtualized network functions which can
be part of EPC or IMS, the interface IRP solution sets defined in 3GPP TS
32.606 [3], TS 32.616 [4] and TS 32.666 [5] shall be used.
# 5 NRM Solution Set definitions
For Itf-N configuration management of virtualized network functions which can
be part of EPC or IMS, the NRMs defined in 3GPP TS 28.623 [6], TS 28.709 [7]
and TS 28.706 [8] shall be used.
