functionalities (e.g., the usage of the radio interface for CIoT, CP CIoT
Optimisation and Serving PLMN Rate Control) as described in TS 32.251 [2].
CIoT functionality is provided by the visited and home networks when the
networks are configured to support CIoT. It applies to both the non-roaming
case and the roaming case and some functionality may be dependent upon the
existence of appropriate roaming agreements between the operators.

# 5 Use cases and key issues
## 5.1 Use cases
### 5.1.1 Use case #1: Control plane optimization in 5G data connectivity
domain charging
The Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is used to exchange user data between
the UE and the SMF as payload of a NAS message in both uplink and downlink
directions, avoiding the establishment of a user plane connection for the PDU
Session as described in TS 23.501 [3].
When the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation feature is used and the PDU
session type is unstructured, the SMF selects either NEF or UPF based on
information in the UE\'s subscription as described in TS 23.501 [3]. The
control plane is used with Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimization instead of
establishment data plane connection, the SRB1bis is established for NB-IoT
rather using dedicated bearer. The cost of data plane connection and dedicated
radio bearer are reduced by this optimization for 5GS CIoT.
During the PDU Session Establishment procedure the AMF indicates to the SMF
that Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation is available for data transmission.
If a PDU session only uses Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation, the AMF
provides a Control Plane Only Indicator to the SMF during the PDU session
establishment. A UE and SMF receiving the Control Plane Only Indicator for a
PDU session always uses the Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation for this PDU
session.
### 5.1.2 Use case #2: Non-IP Data Delivery (NIDD) in control plane data
transfer domain charging
Functions of NIDD is a 5GS CIoT feature to handle Mobile Originated (MO) and
Mobile Terminated (MT) communication for unstructured data (also referred to
as Non-IP), that delivery to the AF using the NIDD API or using the UPF via a
PtP N6 tunnel.
The use case begins during the PDU session establishment, the UE may obtain an
Unstructured PDU session to the NEF and a NEF Identity for NIDD may be
presented. The AMF determines the use of the Control Plane CIoT 5GS
Optimisation, and can indicate Control Plane CIoT 5GS Optimisation to SMF
during PDU session establishment. For Unstructured PDU Session Type, the SMF
checks the determination of NIDD API invoking for a PDU session depends on the
presence of NEF Identity for NIDD for the DNN/S-NSSAI combination in the
subscription. SMF selects that NEF and uses the NIDD API for the PDU session
if determines.
The NEF is responsible to expose the NIDD API on N33/Nnef reference point.
In control plan data transfer domain charging, offline charging is supported
by Control Plane data transfer charging Nodes (CPCN), with the CTF. The 5GC
NFs (e.g., AMF, SMF and NEF) may collect the information on the use of NIDD
API and generating the charging information, related to the use of CP 5GS CIoT
optimization and NIDD API during the unstructured PDU session toward to NEF.
The 5GS CIoT charging may require 5GS NFs to support collecting the uses of
NIDD API during a PDU session.
### 5.1.3 Use case #3: Support of Serving PLMN Rate Control in control plane
data transfer domain charging
As described in TS 23.501 [3], the support of rate control of user data in 5GS
CIoT is described as two 5GS CIoT features, which are Serving PLMN Rate
control and Small Data Rate Control. Serving PLMN Rate Control as a 5GS CIoT
feature allows the serving PLMN to protect AMF and the Signalling Radio
Bearers in the NG-RAN from the load generated by NAS Data PDUs.
The use case begins during PDU session establishment and PDU session
modification, SMF can indicate the support of PDU Session Serving PLMN Rate
Control information to UE and UPF/NEF. That indicated information of Serving
PLMN Rate Control is used for NAS Data PDUs.
During a PDU session, the UE can limit the rate to generate uplink NAS Data
PDUs comply with the Serving PLMN policy, the UPF or NEF can limit the rate to
generate downlink NAS Data PDU comply with the rate indicated for the PDU
Session.
The indication information of Serving PLMN Rate Control, the change of Serving
PLMN policy and enforcement of limit per PDU Session may be collected as
charging information and CDRs regarding the use of this 5GS CIoT feature.
In control plane data transfer domain charging, the corresponding 5GC NFs
those involve the Serving PLMN Rate control in a PDU connection to NEF may
distinguish the indication information of Serving PLMN Rate Control and
generate charging information during PDU session establishment and PDU session
modification.
The potential charging requirement of control plane data transfer domain
charging for this use case is: **REQ-3GPPCH-5GSCIoT-04**.
### 5.1.4 Use case #4: Support of Small Data Rate Control in control plane
data transfer domain charging
As described in TS 23.501 [3], the support of rate control of user data in 5GS
CIoT is described as two 5GS CIoT features, which are Serving PLMN Rate
control and Small Data Rate Control.
Small Data Rate Control allows HPLMN operator to offer customer services in
form of \'number of packets per time unit\'. The SMF may determine the Small
Data Rate Control based on operator policy, subscription, DNN, S-NSSAI, RAT
type etc. The SMF can send a Small Data Uplink Rate Control command to the UE
and inform the UPF or NEF of Small Data Rate Control.
During a PDU session, the UE may comply with this uplink rate control
instruction. If the UE exceeds the uplink \'number of packets per time unit\',
the UE may still send uplink exception reports if allowed. When the PDU
Session is released, the AMF can stores Small Data Rate Control Status so that
can be used for a subsequent establishment of a new PDU session. The SMF may
receive the stored Small Data Rate Control Status during PDU session
establishment, then provides the parameters to the UE and UPF/NEF.
The use of Small Data Rate Control and enforcement of limit per PDU Session
may be collected as charging information and CDRs regarding the use of this
5GS CIoT feature.
In control plane data transfer domain charging, the corresponding 5GC NFs
those involve the Serving PLMN Rate control in a PDU connection to NEF may
distinguish information of Small Data Rate Control l and generate charging
information.
The potential charging requirements of control plane data transfer domain
charging for this use case are: **REQ-3GPPCH-5GSCIoT-05**.
### 5.1.5 Use case #5: Handover 5GS CIoT charging with EPS interworking
The use case describes the scenario when handover from 5GS to EPS and handover
from EPS to 5GS regarding 5GS CIoT features. The use case begins when 5GS CIoT
UE handover procedure starts.
During interworking from 5GS to EPS, if Small Data Rate Control is used the
PGW-C+SMF from PGW-U+UFF or from SCEF+NEF, passes the Small Data Rate Control
Status to the AMF for AMF to store.
If Small Data Rate Control applies on PDU Session, the AMF can provide Small
Rate Control Status information from the H-SMF.
During interworking from EPS to 5GS, if the AMF has stored APN Rate Control
Status and the PDU Session is considered a new first PDU Session to a DNN that
is the same as the APN in stored APN Rate Control Status and interworking with
EPC, the AMF sends the APN Rate Control Status to the SMF. If APN Rate Control
Status is received from the AMF then the SMF provides the configured APN Rate
Control Status to the PGW-U+UPF.
During PDU session release procedure, if the released PDU Session used APN
Rate Control in EPC then the PGW-U+UPF provides the APN Rate Control Status to
the SMF. The SMF provides the APN Rate Control Status to the AMF.
The charging information related to small data rate control as 5GS CIoT
feature should be considered in EPC interworking scenarios. The related
information exchanged during interworking 5GS to EPS support the use of APN
rate control parameters when 5GS CIoT UE backs to EPS. In 5G data connectivity
domain charging and control plane data transfer charging, charging information
related the interworking between 5GS and EPS should be collected by 5GS.
The potential charging requirements of 5G data connectivity domain charging
for this use case are: **REQ-3GPPCH-5GSCIoT-06, REQ-3GPPCH-5GSCIoT-07**.
### 5.1.6 Use case #6: Support for monitoring events charging
The Monitoring Events feature is intended for monitoring of specific events in
the 3GPP system and reporting such Monitoring Events via the NEF. A number of
monitoring events are supported by 5GS CIoT.
The network operator provides 5GS access service with 5GS CIoT features. The
application service provider (ASP) provides a service for the 5G CIoT Ues. The
network operator and the application service provider, holding AF, have
business relationship to toward application function regarding 5GS CIoT
applications. The NOP wants to sell monitoring capabilities to the ASP, to
allow the ASP to enhance their service offerings. The NOP wants to charge for
the subscription event to the monitoring as well as per the actual
notifications when these events occur. The charges have those information
about the UE or group of Ues monitored.
The 5GS NF providing the capability to subscribe to monitoring and get
notifications is the NEF and the 5G NFs, and entity that holds the ASP
application is the AF.
The network operator provides the monitoring reporting to AF for particular
5GS CIoT application. The network operator can collect and record the
subscribed event reporting as charging information for CDR generation.
The NOP wants to sell monitoring capabilities to the ASP, to allow the ASP to
enhance their service offerings. The NOP wants to charge for the subscription
event to the monitoring as well as per the actual notifications when these
events occur. The charges have information about the UE or group of Ues
monitored.
### 5.1.7 Use case #7: The access service of 5GS CIoT
The support to 5GS Cellular IoT service is based on optimizations regarding
NB-IoT and Category M technologies. The 5GS CIoT service is provided by home
and visited network when the network is configured to support CIoT.
The network operator provides the access service to 5GS CIoT Ues. The access
service to 5G network for 5GS CIoT features, provides the access of the
massive amount of devices to 5GS network with 5GS CIoT optimizations. Then,
the communication services like the massive access of NB-IoT devices with
business values, such as power saving, small data rate but large number of
devices are possible for those 5GS CIoT ues. The network operator provides the
access service with 5GS CIoT features and addresses those business use cases.
As the network operator provides massive access to device and communication
service with particular 5GS CIoT optimizations, the network operator can
enable the access and use of 5GS, collects and records the 5GS CIoT access
information (e.g., NB-IoT RAT type) and usage information (in a PDU session)
in term of NB-IoT technologies.
The network operator can provide the access service to MTC type communication
with broadband access to 5GS as category M devices. The category M technology
is used for high data rate access for MTC device (e.g., wearable device) in
5GS. The network operator provides the access service with a set of 5GS CIoT
features like control plane optimization with N3 data path toward UPF, the
schedule data rate control of user data etc.
The network operators can enable the access of 5GS CIoT LTE-M radio access
type for category M devices, collects and records the 5GS CIoT access
information (e.g., LTE-M RAT type) and usage information (in a PDU session) in
term of Category M technologies.
### 5.1.8 Use case #8: Charging support in home-routed roaming scenario
As described in TS 23.501 [3], 5GS CIoT features are provided by the visited
and home networks when the networks are configured to support CIoT.
The network operators provide 5GS CIoT access in home networks and visited
networks. They apply to roaming scenario depend on roaming agreements between
network operators. The home network operator, based on the subscription, the
access information (e.g., RAT type) and 5GC CIoT UE behaviour information
(control plane 5GS CIoT optimisation), provides the network access of 5GS CIoT
Ues. The visited network operator provides the network access of 5GS CIoT
based on access information (e.g., RAT type), rate control of user data and
5GS CIoT UE behaviour information (control plane 5GS CIoT optimisation),
according to the roaming agreements.
### 5.1.9 Use case #9: Support of rate control of user data
As described in TS 23.501 [3], the support of rate control of user data in 5GS
CIoT is described as two 5GS CIoT features, which are Serving PLMN Rate
control and Small Data Rate Control.
The network operator provides 5GS CIoT features regarding the network access
and 5GS use for 5GS CIoT Ues. The rate control of user data is motivated as a
set of 5GS CIoT features to protect mobile network (e.g., control plane
signalling) or provide a capability to schedule use per time duration
regarding the amount of 5GS CIoT Ues.
The network operator provides a capability to 5GS usage for 5GS CIoT service
on the number of message per day. In case that the small data rate control is
used, the SMF informs the small data rate control information to NEF/UPF. The
network operator is capable to configure the small data rate control
parameters (e.g., number of messages per day) to the network and network holds
and transfer small data control status for a PDU session.
