# 1 Scope
The present document describes the measurements for WLAN.
TS 32.401 [3] describes Performance Management concepts and requirements.
The present document is valid for all measurement types provided by an
implementation of a WLAN.
Only measurement types that are specific to WLAN are defined within the
present document. Vendor specific measurement types used in WLAN are not
covered. Instead, these could be applied according to manufacturer\'s
documentation.
Measurements related to \"external\" technologies (such as WLAN or IP) as
described by \"external\" standards bodies (e.g. IEEE or IETF) are only
referenced within the present document, wherever there is a need identified
for the existence of such a reference.
The definition of the standard measurements is intended to result in
comparability of measurement data produced in a multi-vendor network, for
those measurement types that can be standardised across all vendors\'
implementations.
# 2 References

text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or non‑specific.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Use cases for performance measurements
definition
# A.1 Use case for WLAN AP data volume related measurements
WLAN AP data volume related measurements are used to measure data volume on
the WLAN air interface, including incoming and outgoing data packets at IP
layer. The measurements provide indication on how much UE traffic have been
carried over the WLAN. If the data volume measurements are too low, it may
indicate to operators that potential problems exist at a WLAN AP to prevent
UEs from transmitting or receiving the data packets. If the data volume
measurements are too high, it may signal the hot spot areas where additional
WLAN APs may need to be deployed.
# A.2 Use case for CSMA/CA protocol related measurements
CSMA/CA (Carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance) is a
technology used in WLAN AP to enable multiple UEs to access a common wireless
carrier without conflict. CSMA/CA protocol related measurements count the
number of successful RTS / CTS responses, failed RTS/CTS responses, and failed
ACK responses that are tied closely to the WLAN performance. For example,
higher percentage of RTS failure rate (i.e. the number of failed RTS response
/ (the number of failed RTS response + the number of successful RTS response)
may indicate higher number of conflicts among AP and UEs that prevent the UE
from responding with CTS. Failed ACK responses indicate that AP has received
CTS to send the data packet, but the UE cannon received data packet
successfully. Therefore, higher percentage rate of ACK failure rate (i.e. the
number of failed ACK responses / (the number of failed ACK responses + the
number of successful ACK responses) may indicate higher number of data packets
being corrupted or lost, due to reasons, such as interferences, signal fading,
etc. So, higher percentage of RTS and ACK failure rates may indicate to
operators why the users are suffering from poor WLAN performance.
# A.3 Use case for WLAN data packets related measurements
WLAN data packets related measurements include the number of successful MPDU
reception, and the number of failed MPDU reception that can be used to
calculate WLAN Packet Error Rate (PER). WLAN PER may indicate to operators the
performance of a WLAN AP. For example, higher WLAN packet error rate may imply
poor WLAN performance.
# A.4 Use case for station association measurements
A station is associated with a WLAN AP, when the station passed the
authentication process, and is able to gain full access to the WLAN AP.
Association allows the WLAN AP to record each station so that frames may be
received from a station or sent to a station. The station association
measurements enable operators to compute the mean and maximum numbers of
associated station in a given interval that provide statistical information on
how many station(s) are served by the WLAN AP.
