# 4 Concepts and overview
## 4.1 Overview
Management Data Analytics (MDA), as a key enabler of automation and
intelligence, is considered a foundational capability for mobile networks and
services management and orchestration.
The MDA provides a capability of processing and analysing data related to
network and service events and status including e.g. performance measurements,
KPIs, Trace/MDT/RLF/RCEF reports, QoE reports, alarms, configuration data,
network analytics data, and service experience data from AFs, etc. to provide
analytics output, i.e. statistics or predictions,, root cause analysis issues,
and may also include recommendations to enable necessary actions for network
and service operations. The MDA output is provided by the MDAS (Management
Data analytics Service) producer to the corresponding consumer(s) that
requested the analytics.
The MDA can identify ongoing issues impacting the performance of the network
and services, and help to identify in advance potential issues that may cause
potential failure and/or performance degradation. The MDA can also assist to
predict the network and service demand to enable the timely resource
provisioning and deployments which would allow fast time-to-market network and
service deployments.
Management Data Analytics Service (MDAS), the services exposed by the MDA, can
be consumed by various consumers, including for instance MnFs (i.e. MnS
producers/consumers for network and service management), NFs (e.g. NWDAF), SON
functions, network and service optimization tools/functions, SLS assurance
functions, human operators, and AFs, etc.
NOTE: Throughout the present document the terms, MDAS and MDA MnS are
equivalent and may be used interchangeably.
# 5 MDA functionality and service framework
## 5.1 General framework
MDA MnS (also referred to as MDAS) in the context of SBMA enables any
authorized consumer to request and receive analytics as illustrated in Figure
5.1-1.
Figure 5.1-1: MDA functional overview and service framework
A management function (MDAF) may play the roles of MDA MnS producer, MDA MnS
consumer, other MnS consumer, NWDAF consumer and LMF service consumer, and may
also interact with other non-3GPP management systems.
The internal business logic related to MDA leverages the current and
historical data related to:
\- Performance Measurements (PM) as per TS 28.552 [4] and Key Performance
Indicators (KPIs) as per TS 28.554 [5].
\- Trace data, including MDT/RLF/RCEF, as per TS 32.422 [6] and TS 32.423 [7].
\- QoE and service experience data as per TS 28.405 [8] and TS 28.406 [9].
\- Analytics data offered by NWDAF as per TS 23.288 [10] including 5GC data
and external web/app-based information (e.g. web crawler that provides online
news) from AF.
\- Alarm information and notifications as per TS 28.532 [11].
\- CM information and notifications.
\- UE location information provided by LMF as per TS 23.273 [14].
\- MDA reports from other MDA MnS producers.
\- Management data from non-3GPP systems.
Analytics output from the MDA internal business logic are made available by
the management functions (MDAFs) playing the role of MDA MnS producers to the
authorized consumers, (including but not limited to other management
functions, network functions/entities, NWDAF, SON functions, optimization
tools and human operators).
## 5.2 Interaction with CN and RAN domains
The MDA MnS producer provides analytics data for management purposes based on
input data related to different types of NFs or entities in the network, e.g.
data reported from gNB and/or specific core network function(s). Depending on
the use case and when needed, the MDA MnS producer may use the analytics
results produced by NWDAF as input.
Management Data Analytics Function (MDAF) may act as 3GPP domain-specific
(e.g. RAN or CN) or as 3GPP cross-domain MDA MnS producer. Figure 5.2-1
illustrates the example of coordination between NWDAF, gNB and MDA MnS
producer(s) for data analytics purpose.
Figure 5.2-1: Example of coordination between NWDAF, gNB and MDAS (MDA MnS)
producer
Any authorized MnS consumers get access to MDA reports by interacting with MDA
MnS producers. These scenarios include but are not limited to the following:
\- The NWDAF, leveraging MDA reports (e.g. for control purposes and other 5GC
NFs), interacts with MDA MnS producers.
\- The gNB may consume the MDA MnS for RAN control purpose.
\- The 3GPP cross domain MDA MnS Producer may consume (acting as Domain MDA
MnS consumer) MDA MnS provided by domain-specific (RAN and/or CN) MDA MnS
producer(s) and produce MDA MnS that may be consumed by 3GPP cross-domain MDA
MnS consumer(s).
The management function (MDAF) playing the role of domain MDA MnS producer may
interact with 5GC and RAN MnSs and NFs to receive analytics inputs per MDA
capability, including:
\- The CN Domain MDA MnS producer may consume the service provided by NWDAF
and other 5GC NFs for MDA purpose.
\- The RAN Domain MDA MnS producer may consume the MnS provided by/for gNB for
MDA purpose.
The management function (MDAF) playing the role of 3GPP cross domain MDA MnS
producer consumes 5GC domain MDA, RAN domain MDA, 5GC MnS and RAN MnS to
receive analytics inputs per each MDA use case/capability including:
\- The cross domain MDA MnS producer may consume the MDA MnS provided by RAN
and/or CN domains.
\- The cross domain MDA MnS producer may consume MnS provided by RAN and/or CN
domains, and produce MDA MnS that may be consumed by 3GPP cross-domain MDA MnS
consumer(s).
## 5.3 Deployment of multiple MDAs
Multiple MDA instances may be deployed according to deployment needs.
The 3GPP cross domain management may consume MDA MnS provided by core network
management as shown in Figure 5.3-1.
Figure 5.3-1
The management function (MDAF) playing the role of 3GPP cross domain MDA MnS
producer interacts with CN domain MDA per each MDA use case/capability as
follows:
\- The cross-domain MDA MnS producer may consume the CN domain MDA MnS.
\- The cross-domain MDA MnS producer may consume MnS provided by CN domains,
and produce MDA MnS that may be consumed by 3GPP cross-domain MDA MnS
consumer(s).
The management function (MDAF) playing the role of CN domain MDA MnS producer
interacts with MnS producers per each use case/capability as follows:
\- The CN domain MDA MnS producer may consume analytics results produced by
NWDAF, MnS provided by CN domain management, other MDA MnS producers,
management data derived by subnetwork management function(s), and management
data derived by element management function(s).
The 3GPP cross domain management may consume MDA MnS provided by RAN
management as shown in Figure 5.3â€‘2.
Figure 5.3-2: Example of coordination cross-domain MDA and RAN domain MDA
The management function (MDAF) playing the role of 3GPP cross domain MDA MnS
producer interacts with RAN domain MDA per each MDA use case/capability as
follows:
\- The cross domain MDA MnS producer may consume the RAN domain MDA MnS.
\- The cross domain MDA MnS producer may consume MnS provided by RAN domains,
and produce MDA MnS that may be consumed by 3GPP cross-domain MDA MnS
consumer(s).
The management function (MDAF) playing the role of RAN domain MDA MnS producer
interacts with MnS producers per each use case/capability as follows:
\- The RAN domain MDA MnS producer may consume MnS provided by RAN domain
management, other MDA MnS producers, management data derived by subnetwork
management function(s), and management data derived by element management
function(s).
## 5.4 Network Context
An MDA MnS producer provides analytics with respect to a particular network
context, i.e. network status, under which data is collected to produce
analytics. For example, a prediction of load in an area of interest may differ
when all gNBs and potential additional RATs are operating compared to case
where certain gNBs or other RATs are experiencing a fault or are powered off
to save energy. The analytics conducted and produced by the MDA MnS producer
for these two example scenarios would be different and directly affected by
the specific status of network. Although the network status (context) affects
the produced analytics conducted by the MDA producer, awareness of the network
context would fall on the consumer side to complement the obtained analytics
results. This network context, reflecting network status at the time of
enabling data collection, is important for the MDA MnS consumer to understand
the network conditions related to the obtained analytics and hence be able to
use such analytics more efficiently.
The MDA MnS consumer cannot expect the MDA producer to provide the network
context, because the network context interest of each MDA MnS consumer may
differ depending on the usage and purpose of analytics. The usage can include
a proprietary algorithm that assist a decision-making process. For example, a
load balancing algorithm may require the load and mobility information among
neighbouring gNB whereas other load balancing algorithms may also require load
and mobility information from a greater geographical area.
In addition, the selection of the parameters and their combinations may prove
to be impractical for the MDA MnS producer to prepare and provide. Hence, it
is efficient for the MDA MnS producer to prepare only the MDA output without
including any network context and allow the MDA MnS consumer to obtain the
required network context, to complement the obtained analytics, using
conventional configuration management procedures as described in TS 28.511
[20] and TS 28.531 [21].
## 5.5 Historical data handling for MDA
Historical analytics reports may be saved and retrieved for use at later times
by a MDA MnS consumer, and historical analytics input (enabling) data (along
with current analytics input data) may be used for analytics by MDA MnS
producer. Such a historical data usage may be applicable to both or one of the
MDA MnS producer and MDA MnS consumer side.
NOTE: Historical data refers to (a) historical analytics reports that have
been produced in the past, and (b) historical analytics input (enabling) data
that had been collected in the past.
## 5.6 AI/ML support for MDA
The MDA process may utilize AI/ML technologies. An MDA Function may optionally
be deployed as one or more AI/ML inference function(s) in which the relevant
ML entities are used for inference per the corresponding MDA capability.
Specifications for MDA ML entity training to enable ML entity deployments are
given in TS 28.105 [24].
# 6 MDA in management loop
## 6.1 MDA role in the management loop
Intelligence in Analytics, played by MDA, in the management loop which can be
open loop (operator controlled) or closed loop (autonomous) [1] as shown in
Figure 6.1-1, generates value by _processing and analysis of management and
network data, where AI and ML techniques may be utilized (see TS 28.105
[24])._
Figure 6.1-1: Analytics in management loop
The management loop constitutes number of elements including the analytics,
and these are briefly described below:
**Observation:** The observation of the managed networks and services. It
involves monitoring and collection of events, status and performance of the
managed networks and services, and providing the observed/collected data.
**Analytics:** The data analytics for the managed networks and services. MDA
plays the role of Analytics in the management loop. It prepares, processes and
analyses the observed/collected data or time series of the observed/collected
data related to the managed networks and services. MDA reports may contain
root cause analysis of ongoing issues, predictions of potential issues and
corresponding relevant causes and recommended actions for preventions, and/or
prediction of network and/or service demands.
**Decision:** The decision making for the management actions for the managed
networks and services. The management actions are decided based on the
analytics reports (provided by MDA) and other management data (e.g. historical
decisions made previously) if necessary. The decision may be made by the
consumer of MDAS (in the closed management control loop), or by a human
operator (in the case of open management loop). The decision may include e.g.
what actions to take, and when to take the actions.
**Execution:** The execution of the management actions according to the
decisions. During the execution step, the actions are carried out to the
managed networks and services, and the reports (e.g. notifications, logs) of
the executed actions are provided.
## 6.2 MDA role in the management loop for service assurance
MDA represents Analytics roles in the management control loop for
communications service assurance TS 28.535 [3]. The management and control of
resources used by a communication service and the assurance of this
communication service level agreements (e.g. per SLS) is provided by the
management control loop involving different management services produced by
the management system, which includes management data analytics service (MDAS,
or MDA MnS). The MDAS (MDA MnS) may be produced based on a combination of
information including e.g. the user quality of service experience, network
performance and network resource utilization analysis and the SLS.
The MDAS complements other services in the management loop in order to perform
SLS communication service assurance. Prior to operation phase, the MDA role in
the management control loop is to prepare, process and analyse the data
related to the managed communication service, in order to provide the
analytics output (analytics report) which may include prediction and
feasibility checks of network resource requirements to meet the SLS.
During the operation phase, the MDA can identify ongoing issues impacting the
performance of the communication service per the SLS and identify in advance
potential risks that would cause potential failure and/or performance
degradation. The MDA can also predict the network and service demand to
maintain delivery of communication service per the contracted SLS.
## 6.3 MDA role in cross-domain service assurance
Cross-domain MDA may base its analysis on the outputs from one or multiple
single-domain MDA including analytics output and other input data (e.g. PM,
alarm notifications, etc.). To facilitate service assurance the cross-domain
MDA may adopt output from one or multiple single-domain MDA. Figure 6.3-1
shows the simplest case, where a cross-domain MDA incorporates the results of
single-domain MDA(s).
{width="5.5in" height="4.315972222222222in"}
Figure 6.3-1 Cross-domain MDA based on single-domain MDA
Figure 6.3-2 shows the case where a cross-domain MDA incorporates the results
of single-domain MDA(s) which are embedded within single-domain control loop
service(s). Service assurance control loop may be conducted at single-domain
bases where MDA role is assumed by analytics. The cross-domain MDA may further
leverage the output from one or multiple single-domain control loops for its
analytics for the e2e service assurance.
Figure 6.3-2: Cross-domain MDA based on single-domain control loop service
Figure 6.3-3 shows the case where a cross-domain MDA is part of a cross-domain
control loop service. Also in this case, cross-domain MDA incorporates the
results of single-domain MDA(s). Service assurance control loop may be
conducted at the cross-domain level in which the MDA role is assumed by
analytics. The cross-domain control loop may adopt output from one or multiple
single-domain MDA(s) for the e2e service assurance.
Figure 6.3-3: Cross-domain control loop service based on single-domain MDA(s)
Figure 6.3-4 shows another case where a cross-domain MDA is part of a cross-
domain control service. In this case, cross-domain MDA incorporates the
results of single-domain MDA(s) which are embedded within single-domain
control loop service(s). Service assurance control loop may be conducted at
both levels where MDA role is assumed by analytics, i.e. at the cross-domain
and single-domain. The cross-domain MDA may adopt output from one or multiple
single-domain MDA(s) for the e2e service assurance.

loop service(s)
# 7 Use cases and requirements for MDA capabilities and services
## 7.1 General
The following clauses describe the use cases and requirements for MDA
capabilities and MDA MnSs. The MDA capabilities are grouped under specific
categories.
## 7.2 MDA capabilities
### 7.2.1 Coverage related analytics
#### 7.2.1.1 Coverage problem analysis
##### 7.2.1.1.1 Description
_This MDA capability is for analysis of_ coverage related problem.
##### 7.2.1.1.2 Use case
The RAN coverage problem may cause UEs to be out of service or result in a
downgrade of network performance offered to the UEs, such as failure of random
access, paging, RRC connection establishment or handover, low data throughput,
abnormal releases of RRC connection or UE context, and dissatisfied QoE.
There are various types of coverage problems, e.g. weak coverage, a coverage
hole, a pilot pollution, an overshoot coverage, or a DL and UL channel
coverage mismatch, etc., caused by different sorts of reasons, such as
insufficient or weak transmission power, blocked by constructions and/or
restricted by terrain.
The 5G related coverage problem may exist in NR, in E-UTRA or both.
To unravel a coverage problem, it is necessary for MDAS consumer to determine
the details about when and where the problem occurred or likely to occur, and
the type and cause(s) of the problem. Therefore, it is desirable for MDA to
correlate and analyze multifold data (such as performance measurements, MDT
reports, RLF reports, RCEF reports, UE location reports, together with the
geographical, terrain and configuration data of the RAN) to detect and
describe the problem with detailed information.
The RAN coverage related problems can cause network performance degradation
and in the extreme cases can result into service degradation. So besides
identifying the problems after they have happened, it is also necessary to
proactively avoid the RAN coverage related problems well before they occur.
To avoid coverage related problems or to proactively undertake actions to
avoid their occurrence, the consumer of MDA MnS may wish to know the
characteristics and quality of the coverage of the RAN. This may be expressed
graphically on a Map, called a Radio Environment Map, that shows the coverage
quality for a set of cells. Such a map may be constructed e.g. to show the
RSRP or the SINR of the cells as derived from the observed UE performance
and/or from radio configuration parameters of the cells including transmit
powers, antenna gains, antenna tilts, etc. It is desirable that the MDAS
producer can provide the Radio Environment Map in an appropriate graphical
form.
Moreover, where a new RAN node is provisioned, the MDAS producer should be
able to take into considerations the coverage of existing cells as defined by
a Radio Environment Map and derive the configuration of the new cell(s) and
the existing cells to optimize the coverage. Image analytics should help to
identify the most optimized set of initial radio configurations that can be
assigned to a new RAN NE.
To help MDAS consumer to solve the coverage problem as quickly as possible,
MDA may also provide, along with the description of the problem, the
recommended remedy actions (e.g. reconfigure or add cells, beams, antennas,
etc.).

environment map that graphically describes the radio coverage characteristics
(e.g. RSRP or SINR) of a selected cluster of cells. Coverage problem analysis
#### 7.2.1.2 Slice coverage analysis
##### 7.2.1.2.1 Description
This MDA capability is for the slice coverage analysis.
##### 7.2.1.2.2 Use case
The slice coverage is one of the indicators when a 3^rd^ party (i.e. slice
tenant) issues a slice request and is mapped into the desired geographical
coverage area with the available radio coverage which depends on the base
station planning and deployment. In order to map the desired slice coverage
perfectly, MDA can be used to optimize the slice coverage on the slice
instantiation and runtime considering:
i) slice-aware statistics, e.g. slice-UE distributions and mobility patterns;
ii) slice SLA; and
iii) access node capabilities.
In 5G the notion of coverage is represented by a set of one or more Tracking
Areas (TAs), which are contained in a Registration Area (RA), which is
assigned to a UE once it registers to the network. Depending on the MDA MnS
producer output, TA and RA planning, i.e. grouping cells to form a TA and then
TAs to an RA, can be optimized and the RAN parameters can be adjusted to shape
the cell edges and load distribution. The main objective is to fulfill a given
slice SLA involving as few cells as possible by leveraging the benefits of
adjusting cell configurations for satisfying the desired coverage.

configuration, computing resource and slice support in a cell. _Slice_
coverage analysis
#### 7.2.1.3 Paging optimization analysis
##### 7.2.1.3.1 Description
This MDA capability is for enabling various functionalities related to paging
optimization.
##### 7.2.1.3.2 Use Case
As per the current procedures, if the UE goes Out-Of-Coverage (OOC) the paging
which was initiated by the network Access and Mobility Management Function
(AMF) fails. The re-attempts continue to fail until UE enters the coverage and
respond to the paging attempts. This repetitive paging attempts result in the
wastage of network resources. As an example, the use case includes a user or a
group of users getting into an area, with no cellular coverage on a regular
basis for a considerably long duration, for e.g. the user gets into a shielded
room for some testing purpose every day for a defined period. The Network
initiated paging for such users will fail until they are back in the area with
cellular coverage. This would result in in-efficient network resource usage.
It is desirable to use MDAS (Management data analytic service) to optimize the
current paging procedures in 5G networks. MDAS producer provides an analytics
output containing the user(s) paging analytics indicating the time window at
which a group of users are OOC on a regular basis at the particular location.
MDAS producer also provides the geographical map within which the UEs would
experience paging issues and hence will not be able to respond on a network-
initiated paging. Based on the provided MDA output, MDAS consumer (e.g. AMF,
gNB) decides on whether, when and where to initiate or not to initiate the
paging procedures, thereby ensuring the efficient paging procedures and
optimal network resource utilization, as paging can be initiated only when
there are more chances for it to be successful.

expanding all the time and the requirements of different services especially
from vertical users are being standardized. Considering these diverse
requirements and expectation from end user perspective (e.g. priorities of SLA
related attributes such as latency, throughput, maximum number of users or
different required values of these attributes), the service experience as a
comprehensive indicator need to be extensively analysed.

#### 7.2.2.2 Network slice throughput analysis
##### 7.2.2.2.1 Description
This MDA capability is for the network slice throughput analysis.
##### 7.2.2.2.2 Use case
Throughput is of great importance which represents the end users\' experiences
and also reflects the network problems, e.g. low UE throughput may be caused
by resource shortage. In order to satisfy the requirements of
dL/ulThptPerSlice in the ServiceProfile, MDAS may be utilized for throughput
related analysis/predictions for network slice instance.
MDAS producer allows the consumer to request analytics of network slice
throughput related issues and identify the corresponding root cause(s) to
assist throughput assurance. Network slice throughput analysis can be for a
specific domain and/or for cross-domain. The two level MDAS producers, i.e.
domain-specific and cross-domain may work in coordination to assure the
optimum throughput performance.

#### 7.2.2.4 E2E latency analysis
##### 7.2.2.4.1 Description
This MDA capability is for E2E latency related issue analysis.
##### 7.2.2.4.2 Use case
E2E latency is an important parameter for URLLC services. User data packets
should be successfully delivered within certain time constraints to satisfy
the end users requirements. Latency could be impacted by the network
capability and network configurations. These factors may be the root cause if
the latency requirements cannot be achieved. Packet transmission latency may
dynamically change if these factors change. The latency requirement should be
assured even if some of the network conditions may degrade. It is important
for the MDAS producer to analyze the latency related issues to support SLS
assurance.

#### 7.2.2.5 Network slice load analysis
##### 7.2.2.5.1 Description
This MDA capability is for network slice load analysis.
##### 7.2.2.5.2 Use cases
Network slice load may vary during different time periods. Therefore, network
resources allocated initially could not always satisfy the traffic
requirements, for example, the network slice may be overloaded or
underutilized. Overload of signalling in control plane and/or user data
congestion in user plane will lead to underperforming network. Besides,
allocating excessive resources for network slice with light load will decrease
resource efficiency.
The analysis of network slice load should consider the load of services with
different characteristics (e.g. QoS information, service priority), load
distribution to derive the corresponding resource requirements. Load
distribution analytic result may be provided, e.g. load distribution for
network slices, different locations and/or time periods etc.
Traffics and resources related performance measurements and UE measurements
can be utilized by MDAS producer to identify degradation of the performance
measurements and KPI documented in an SLS due to load issues, e.g. radio
resource utilization. MDAS producer may further provide recommendations to the
network slice load issue. This analytics results can be considered as an input
to support SLA assurance to perform further evaluation.

### 7.2.3 MDA assisted fault management
#### 7.2.3.1 Failure prediction
##### 7.2.3.1.1 Description
This MDA capability is for failure prediction.
##### 7.2.3.1.2 Use case
There are multiple sources of faults which may cause the 5G system to fail to
provide the expected service. These faults and the associated failures need
extensive troubleshooting. In order to reduce network and service failure time
and performance degradation, it is necessary to supervise the status of
various network functions and resources, and predict the running trend of
network and potential failures to intervene in advance. These predictions can
be used by the management system to autonomously maintain the health of the
network, e.g. speedy recovery actions on a network function related to the
predicted potential failure.
Due to the fact that failure prediction could depend on the existing alarm
incidents and relevant historical and realâ€‘time data (performance measurement
information, configuration data, network topology information, etc.), there is
a possibility for MDA to be used in conjunction with AI/ML technologies and
model training to predict potential failures.
In order to avoid the occurrence of failures and abnormal network status, it
is necessary for consumers of analytics to obtain the required details of
potential failure and the corresponding degradation trend (abnormal KPI,
performance measurement information, possible alarm type, fault root cause,
etc.). Therefore, MDA, may in conjunction with AI/ML technology, be required
to obtain basic health maintenance knowledge (e.g. the relationship between
the failures or potential failures and the related maintenance actions)
through predefined expertise or model training, so as to effectively predict
potential failures. The basic health maintenance knowledge could be updated
with feedback.
If necessary, MDA could also provide corresponding recommended actions for
failure prevention.

### 7.2.4 MDA assisted Energy Saving
#### 7.2.4.1 Energy saving analysis
##### 7.2.4.1.1 Description
This MDA capability is for _the_ energy saving analysis _._
##### 7.2.4.1.2 Use cases
_Operators are aiming at decreasing power consumption in 5G networks to lower
their operational expense with energy saving management solutions. Energy
saving is achieved by activating the energy saving mode of the NR capacity
booster cell or 5GC NFs (e.g. UPF etc.). The energy saving decision making is
typically based on the load information of the related cells/UPFs, the energy
saving policies set by operators and the energy saving recommendations
provided by MDAS producer. To achieve an optimized balance between the energy
consumption and the network performance, MDA can be used to assist the MDAS
consumer to make energy saving decisions._
To make the energy saving decision, it is necessary for MDAS consumer to
determine where the energy efficiency issues (e.g. high energy consumption,
low energy efficiency) exist, and the cause of the energy efficiency issues.
Therefore, it is desirable for MDA to correlate and analyze _the energy saving
related performance measurements (e.g. PDCP data volume of cells, power
consumption, etc.) and_ the network analysis data (e.g. observed service
experience related network data analytics) _to provide the analytics results
which indicate current network energy efficiency. In some low-traffic
scenarios, MDA MnS consumers may expect to reduce_ energy consumption to save
energy. In this case, the MDA MnS consumer may request the MDAS producer to
report only high energy consumption _issue related analytics results._ _When
the consumer expects to improve energy efficiency,_ although it may lead to
high energy consumption in network or in certain parts of network, then _the
related issue is the low energy efficiency one. In that case, the consumer may
request analytics results related to low energy efficiency issue._ So, the
target could be to enhance the performance of NF for a given energy
consumption. This will result in higher Energy Efficiency of network.
To make the energy saving decision, it is necessary for MDAS consumer to
determine which Energy Efficiency (EE) KPI related factor(s) (e.g. traffic
load, end-to-end latency, active UE numbers, etc.) are affected or potentially
affected. _The MDAS producer can utilize historical data to predict the_ EE
KPI related factors _(e.g. load variation of cells at some future time, etc.).
The prediction result of these information can then be used by operators to
make energy-saving decision_ to guarantee the service experience _._
_The MDAS producer may also provide energy saving related recommendation with
the energy saving state to the MDAS consumer._ U _nder the energy saving
state, the required network performance and network experience should be
guaranteed. Therefore, it is important to formulate appropriate energy saving
policies (start time, dynamic threshold setting, base station parameter
configuration, etc.)._ The MDAS consumer may take the recommendations with the
energy saving state into account for making analysis or making energy saving
decisions. _After the recommendations have been_ executed _, the MDA producer
may_ start evaluating and further _analyzing network management data to
optimize the recommendations._

#### 7.2.5.2 Handover optimization analysis
##### 7.2.5.2.1 Description
This MDA capability is for the handover optimization analysis.
##### 7.2.5.2.2 Use cases
##### 7.2.5.2.2.1 Handover optimization {#handover-optimization .H6}
Current handover procedures are mainly based on radio conditions for selecting
the target gNB upon a handover. The target gNB accepts or rejects the Handover
(HO) request depending on various conditions. In virtualized environment, the
HO may be rejected due to inadequate available resources within the target
gNB. The notion of resources may include virtual resources (e.g. compute,
memory) and/or radio resources (e.g. PRB, RRC connected users). If the HO
request is rejected, a UE will try to connect to a different gNB until the
request is successfully accepted. Several target gNBs can be tried until the
request is successfully accepted. This process can result in wastage of UE and
network resources, while it may also introduce service disruption due to
increased latency and Radio Link Failures (RLFs). It also introduces
inefficiency in the HO or other network procedures.
To address this handover optimization issue, it is desirable to use MDA
(Management Data Analytics) to provision and/or select a particular target gNB
for handover in order to reduce or even avoid HO rejections. The MDAS producer
provides a HO optimization analytics output containing the current and
future/predicted resource consumption, resources capabilities and other KPIs\'
status for the available target gNB(s). The analytics output also provides
recommended actions to optimize the target gNB for handover. This may include
resource re-configuration or the updated selection criteria for target gNB.
Based on the output, the MDAS consumer adjusts (e.g. scale-out/up the virtual
resource, re-schedule/optimize radio resource) the resources before continuing
with the handover and/or adjusts the selection criteria of the target gNB by
also considering the overlapping coverages of interâ€‘frequency and inter-RAT
deployments.
##### 7.2.5.2.2.2 Handover optimization based on UE Load {#handover-
optimization-based-on-ue-load .H6}
The target node, eNB, may not have adequate resources to accept certain
handover requests. In the context of network virtualization, these resources
may include not only legacy radio resources, but also virtual resources such
as processor and memory. Handover optimization can benefit from knowledge
about the projected UE load on the target cell including additional radio and
virtual resources.

#### 7.2.5.3 Inter-gNB beam selection optimization
##### 7.2.5.3.1 Description
This MDA capability is for inter-gNB beam selection optimization.
##### 7.2.5.3.2 Use case
With the deployment of 5G networks, Massive MIMO has been used on a large
scale. Beamforming, as a key technology to reduce user interference, which can
suppress interference signals in non-target directions and enhance sound
signals in target directions, is always combined with Massive MIMO to further
decrease interference. A cell can make use of multiple beams for serving
residing users (SSB or CSI-RS) with each user served by a single beam at a
time. The cell level quality can be represented as an aggregated metric over
one or more beams. So, although handover is performed between two 5G cells,
the granularity of handover can be further broken down to beam level.
The handover of beams could be performed if the network resource or the
user\'s state have changed to obtain better network performance. Beam
optimization includes the handover between different beams and configuration
of beam parameters.
In order to avoid selecting the wrong beam to perform RACH on the target cell
and causing RLF of the UE, MDA can be used to recommend a means to prioritize
and/or select the beam in case of handover for a specific target cell. MDA can
provide a beam level HO optimization analysis considering information on the
handover performance of different beam combinations between the source and
target cell pairs. Beams of the target cell with a successful handover are
preferred in the selection.
MDA could also provide recommended actions and priority options for beam
selection. Based on the recommended actions, the MDA MnS consumer adjusts the
priorities for the beam selection at HO, i.e. the beam combinations that are
likely to succeed are prioritized, less optimal beam combinations are down
prioritized. The target cell may also obtain analytics to allocate RACH
resources in a way that ensures HO success.
In order to optimize antenna and beam configuration, so as to reduce energy
loss and enhance network performance, MDA can be used to analyze the current
network status.

### 7.2.6 MDA assisted critical maintenance management
#### 7.2.6.1 RAN Node Software Upgrade
##### 7.2.6.1.1 Description
This MDA capability is for network critical maintenance during RAN node
software upgrade process.
##### 7.2.6.1.2 Use case
As per the current mechanism of software upgrade at RAN node results in
service disruption or huge operational cost. Consider a scenario, when a RAN
Node is required to shut down manually to undergo critical maintenance for a
very short duration of time. Software upgrade can be one such critical
maintenance scenario. In such cases, all the resources (bearer, security
functions, mobility management) that are managed by this RAN Node need to be
purged and reconfigured at another RAN Node (standby RAN Node) or if another
RAN Node is not available then resources will be reconfigured again when
former RAN Node comes up after software upgrade. Both the situations lead to
additional operational expenses and data loss. Operational expense in terms of
all the resources to be released/attached again and data loss for all GBR
sessions/bearer.
It is expected to use MDAS to optimize the procedure of software upgrade at
RAN Node by providing the right time to execute the required upgrade. The
software upgrade should be automatically initiated by the OAM system, once
configured, during the time frame when the expected impacts are minimum i.e.
at the optimal time when there would be minimum expected operational cost and
data loss. The Optimal Time (current or futuristic) can be derived by
collecting and analysing the data related to DRBs including GBR/non-GBR,
state, modification count, ongoing handover etc. MDAS can utilize historical
data and AI/ML (e.g. time series based) algorithm to derive the future optimal
time frame for software upgrade.
Note: RAN Node above refers to CU-CP in case of gNB split case.

## 7.3 MDA MnS
### 7.3.1 MDA request and control
#### 7.3.1.1 Description
The MDA request and control allow any authorized MDA MnS consumer to request
management data analytics.
#### 7.3.1.2 Use case
The MDA MnS consumer can request the MDA MnS producer to provide MDA output
for a list of specified MDA type of analytics, i.e. MDA type, which
corresponds to an MDA capability, which is to support analytics for a set of
data or analytics for a certain PM, KPI, trace or QoE data. The MDA MnS
consumer may introduce control attributes related to the MDA output with
respect to the geographical location (i.e. area scope) and/or the target
objects, e.g. managed elements, time schedule for obtaining an MDA output,
time conditions related to the preparation of MDA output (i.e. time schedule
for start, end and duration of analytics, etc.), and potential filter
conditions to be met before an MDA output is made available, e.g. load or
delay threshold crossing related to a target object. The geographical location
indicates an area of interest for obtaining MDA output and/or target objects
include affected objects or objects of interest for obtaining MDA output.
The MDA MnS consumer may control the MDA output attributes related to, e.g.
time schedule, geographical location, target objects, etc., and has the
capability to modify them at any point in time. The MDA MnS consumer can
request the MDA MnS producer to generate an MDA output that contains numeric
output results, e.g. average, normal distribution, etc., recommendation
options, e.g. potential handover target cells, or root cause analysis, e.g.
alarm prediction.
The MDA MnS consumer can be informed with an acknowledgment if the request was
successful. If the request was not successful, the consumer is informed about
potential errors indicating the reasons. The MDA MnS consumer can also
deactivate the MDA reporting control request once it is no longer needed.

Following a successful MDA request any authorized MDA MnS consumer can obtain
management data analytics from the corresponding MDA MnS producer. The MDA MnS
consumer can control the MDA output by modifying the attributes related to the
MDA request at any point in time.
#### 7.3.2.2 Use case
The MDA MnS producer allow consumers to obtain MDA output when the conditions
indicated in the MDA request are met. The level of details and granularity of
MDA output results would depend on the MDA request and nature of MDA
capability. Therefore an MDA output can vary in complexity and may contain one
or more MDA results, which may be:
i) numeric, e.g. average, etc.;
ii) recommendation options, e.g. potential handover target cells; or
iii) root cause analysis, e.g. alarm prediction.
These results may be related to one or more MDA types, which correspond to MDA
capabilities, and can also contain information regarding the time schedule or
the validity time of the provided MDA output.
MDA MnS producer may allow consumers to request and obtain different MDA
output results. The MDA MnS producer may also allow consumers to obtain
information regarding the geographical location and/or the target objects,
e.g. managed elements, related to the provided MDA result - from the
corresponding element.
The MDA MnS producer may allow consumers options to obtain MDA output results
either by pulling or pushing mechanisms. Any MDA output may be obtained once
it is prepared or when the specified MDA request and control conditions are
met.

# 8 Data definitions for MDA capabilities
## 8.1 Introduction
### 8.1.1 MDA Types
The output of MDA can be related to a particular capability as described in
clause 7, where an MDA type can indicate a specific MDA capability
corresponding to a predefined use case(s).
The MDA capabilities may also support analytics of a set of data or analytics
for certain PMs, KPIs, trace data, QoE or other type of data. Analytics
related to the set of data relies on multiple raw, or already processed input
data enabling an MDA MnS producer to provide more complex MDA output.
Analytics related to certain set of data including PMs, KPIs, trace or QoE
data may rely on these specific categories of data.
MDA MnS consumers may request and obtain output for MDA types related to
analytics of a set of data or analytics for certain PMs, KPIs, trace or QoE
data.

### 9.4.1 MDAOutputPerMDAType \>
#### 9.4.1.1 Definition
This \> represents the analytics output filters for each MDA type
for an MDA request.
If only **mDAType** element is present (i.e. **mDAOutputIEFilters** element is
not present), then all of the MDA output information elements for this
**mDAType** (see analytics output definitions per MDA capability in clause 8)
are requested.
if **mDAOutputIEFilters** element is present, then only the listed analytics
output information elements are requested and shall be reported according to
the corresponding threshold.

### 9.4.2 MDAOutputIEFilter \>
#### 9.4.2.1 Definition
This \> represents the filter for an MDA output information
element for an MDA request.
If only **mDAOutputIEName** element is present (i.e. **filterValue** and
**threshold** elements are not present), then the MDA output information
element indicated by the **mDAOutputIEName** is requested and reported without
filter or threshold.
If **filterValue** element is present (only applicable when the MDA output
information element indicated by **mDAOutputIEName** is non-numeric type (e.g.
enum, string)), then the MDA output information element indicated by the
**mDAOutputIEName** is only requested and reported when its value equals to
the value of **filterValue**.
If **threshold** element is present (only applicable when the MDA output
information element indicated by **mDAOutputIEName** is numeric type (e.g.
integer, real)), then the MDA output information element indicated by the
**mDAOutputIEName** is only requested and reported when its value reaches or
crosses the threshold.
If **analyticsPeriod** element is present (only applicable when
**filterValue** and **threshold** elements are not present), then the MDA
output information element indicated by the **mDAOutputIEName** is only
requested and reported, at specified time or periodically, i.e. when time
reaches the indicated time schedule.
**timeOut** element is present optionally when an MDA MnS consumer needs an
**mDAOutputIEName** element before a specified time only.

# 11 Workflows for MDA management
## 11.1 MDA request and reporting workflow
Figure 11.1-1: Generic MDA request/reporting workflow
1 MDAS Producer creates MOI for MDARequest IOC (see createMOI operation
defined in TS 28.532 [11]) for the MDAS Consumer with MDA request related
information.
Note: Void
2\. The MDAS producer subscribes to the relevant notifications or setup the
streaming connections, per the selected reporting method (identified by
reportingMethod attribute in the MDARequest MOI):
\- If the reportingMethod designated in the MDARequest MOI is \"File\":
2a. if subscription for the reporting target (specified by the reportingTarget
attribute in the MDARequest MOI) do not exist, the MDAS producer subscribes to
the file data reporting related notifications (see TS 28.532 [11]) for the
reporting target;
\- If the reportingMethod designated in the MDARequest MOI is \"Streaming\":
2b/2c. if the streaming connection with the reporting target does not exist,
the MDAS producer invokes the establishStreamingConnection operation (see TS
28.532 [11]) to setup the streaming connection with the streaming target;
2d/2e. if the streaming connection with the reporting target exists, the MDAS
producer invokes the addStream operation (see TS 28.532 [11]) to add the
stream for the expected MDA reports. And,
2f/2g. if the newly added stream is to replace an existing one, the MDAS
producer invokes the deleteStream operation (see TS 28.532 [11]) to delete the
stream.
> NOTE 1: the order of 2d/2e and 2f/2g is not significant and could be swapped
> too.
\- If the reportingMethod designated in the MDARequest MOI is
\"Notification\":
2h. if subscription for the reporting target do not exist, the MDAS producer
subscribes to the provisioning related notifications (see TS 28.532 [11]) for
the reporting target.
> NOTE 2: Although, the workflow assumes that different entities are playing
> the role of \"MDAS Consumer\" and \"Reporting target\", it is possible and
> allowed to have single entity playing the role of both \"MDAS Consumer\" and
> \"Reporting target\".
3\. While the MDARequest is active, the MDAS Producer keeps performing MDA,
and making the MDA report (see the MDAReport IOC defined in clause 9)
according to the MDARequest MOI.
3a. the MDAS producer makes the MDA report ready and sends the MDA report to
the reporting target per the selected reporting method (identified by
reportingMethod attribute in the MDARequest MOI):
\- If the reportingMethod designated in the MDARequest MOI is \"File\":
3b. the MDAS producer makes the MDA report into a file;
3c. the MDAS producer emits the notifyFileReady notification (see TS 28.531
[21]) to the reporting target for the MDA report.
\- If the reportingMethod designated in the MDARequest MOI is \"Streaming\":
3d. the MDAS producers makes the MDA report into a stream date unit;
3e. invokes the reportStreamData operation (see TS 28.531 [21]) to the
reporting target for the MDA report.
\- If the reportingMethod designated in the MDARequest MOI is
\"Notification\":
3f. the MDAS producer creates and MDAReport MOI (see clause 9) for the MDA
report;
3g. if notifyMOICreation is used, the MDAS producer emits the
notifyMOICreation notification (see TS 28.531 [21]) to the reporting target
for the MDA report.
3h. if notifyMOIChanges is used, the MDAS producer emits the notifyMOIChanges
notification (see TS 28.531 [21]) to the reporting target for the MDA report.
