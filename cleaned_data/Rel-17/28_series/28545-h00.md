**Telecom resources** Network function instance
**Assumptions** N/A
**Pre-conditions** An NF is deployed
**Begins when** An authorized consumer wants to subscribe the alarm
notifications of an NF instance
**Step 1 (M)** The authorized consumer sends request to producer of fault
supervision data report service for NF to subscribe alarm notifications of an
NF instance.
**Step 2 (M)** The producer of fault supervision data report service for NF
sends the response of the completion of the subscription to the authorized
consumer.
**Ends when** All the steps identified above are successfully completed.
**Exceptions** In case any of the mandatory steps in the use case fails.
**Post-conditions** The alarm notifications of an NF instance have been
subscribed by the authorized consumer.

# 7 Alarm loss detection
The present document does not specify methods for a management service
consumer to detect alarm loss. The use of alarmId to detect alarm loss is an
arrangement made between management service producer and management service
consumer. The use of such arrangement is outside the scope of the present
document. For example, management service producer may use integer sequence
(e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...) as alarmId instances for its alarms. Based on this
knowledge, the management service consumer can detect alarm loss.
The present document does not specify how a management service producer can
determine if management service consumer has received alarms correctly.
The present document does not specify methods for a management consumer and a
management service producer to recover alarm loss. The only mechanism
recommended to deal with alarm loss is the use of getAlarmList operation. The
present document does not specify conditions under which the management
service consumer should invoke this operation.
# 8 Virtualized resource alarm correlation
The authorized MnS consumer request VNF application alarms and VNF instance
alarms related to virtualized resource from MnS producer by consuming the
fault supervision MnS. MnS producer obtain the VNF application alarms
(including affected VNF/VNFC instance identifier and detailed VNF alarm
information) from the VNF, and the VNF instance alarms related to virtualized
resource (including affected VNF/VNFC instance identifier and detailed NFVI/VM
alarm information) received from the VNFM. Based on the above obtained alarms,
MnS producer can correlate the VNF application alarms and the VNF and/or VNFC
alarms related to virtualized resource according to affected VNF instance
identifier and/or VNFC instance identifiers. The detailed procedure for
virtualized resource alarm correlation procedure see corresponding procedure
of NE alarm correlation made by EM in the context of NFV described in TS
28.516[4] and the MnS producer act as the role of EM.
The authorized MnS consumer requests NSSI alarms including alarm reports
related to virtualized resource by consuming the fault supervision MnS. The
MnS producer should collect alarm report related to virtualized resource
according to affected VNF instance identifier corresponding to the NF instance
in the NSSI.
# 9 Procedures for fault supervision management services
## 9.1 Alarm subscription and notification
The Figure 9.1-1 illustrates procedures of alarm subscription, supervision and
notification for MOI(s).
Figure 9.1-1 Procedures for MOI alarm subscription, supervision and
notification
1\. The authorized consumer sends subscribe request to FS Data Report
management service producer to establish subscription to alarm notifications.
The authorized consumer includes subscriber's URI and filter in the subscribe
request message.
2\. The FS Data Report management service producer checks whether the
subscribe request is accepted.
3\. If the subscription is accepted, the FS Data Report management service
producer creates the subscription resources for the subscriber. If the
subscribe request requires the FS Data Report management service producer to
collect new types of alarm from the constituent MOI(s), it includes the new
alarm type and identifier of MOI into the filter and acts as consumer to
request the subscription operation for each constituent MOI.
4\. When FS Data Report management service producer successfully creates the
subscription resources, it sends success response to authorized consumer.
5\. For each MOI under fault supervision monitored, FS Data Report management
service producer supervises if the conditions are matched by new or changed
