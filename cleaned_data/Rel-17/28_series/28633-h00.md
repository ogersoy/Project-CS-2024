# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.690: Inventory Management (IM); Requirements.
28.631: Inventory Management (IM) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration
Reference Point (IRP); Requirements.
28.632: Inventory Management (IM) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration
Reference Point (IRP); Information Service (IS).
> **28.633: Inventory Management (IM) Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration
> Reference Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions.**
Inventory Management (IM), in general, provides the operator with the ability
to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it evolves. IM
actions have the objective to monitor the actual configuration on the Network
Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and they may be initiated by the
operator or by functions in the Operations Systems (OSs) or NEs. The final
goal of IM is the establishment of an accurate and timely model of the actual
inventory in the NEs or NRs.
The present document covers the Inventory Management (IM) Network Resource
Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP): Solution Set (SS) definitions.
# 1 Scope
The present document provides the NRM-specific part related to the Inventory
Management NRM IRP IS in 3GPP TS 28.632 [1] of solution set definitions.
This Solution Set definitions specification is related to 3GPP TS 28.632 V
14.0.X [1].

The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

# 4 Solution Set definitions
This specification defines the following 3GPP Inventory Management (IM)
Network Resource Model (NRM) IRP Solution Set (SS) definitions:
\- 3GPP Inventory Management (IM) Network Resource Model (NRM) IRP XML
definitions (Annex A)
CORBA Solution Set is not present in the current version of this
specification.
###### ## Annex A (normative): XML definitions
# A.0 General
This annex provides the NRM-specific part related to the Inventory Management
NRM IRP IS in 3GPP TS 28.632 [1] of the XML file format definition for the
Bulk Configuration Management IRP IS in 3GPP TS 32.612 [2] as well as for use
with File Tranfer IRP [10].
The XML file formats are based on XML [4], XML Schema [6] [7] and XML
Namespace [8] standards.
# A.1 Architectural features
## A.1.0 Introduction
The overall architectural feature of Inventory Management NRM IRP IS is
specified in 3GPP TS 28.632 [1].
This clause specifies features that are specific to the XML Schema
definitions.
## A.1.1 Syntax for Distinguished Names
The syntax of a Distinguished Name is defined in 3GPP TS 32.300 [9].
# A.2 Mapping
The mapping is not present in the current version of this specification.
# A.3 Solution Set definitions
## A.3.1 XML definition structure
The overall description of the file format of inventory data XML files is
provided by 3GPP TS 32.616 [3].
A.3.2 defines the NRM-specific XML schema inventoryNrm.xsd for the Inventory
Management NRM IRP IS alternative 1 defined in 3GPP TS 28.632 [1].
A.3.3 defines the NRM-specific XML schema inventoryNrmAlt2.xsd for the
Inventory Management NRM IRP IS alternative 2 as defined in 3GPP TS 28.632
[1].
XML schema inventoryNrmAlt1.xsd and inventoryNrmAlt2.xsd explicitly declare
NRM-specific XML element types for the related NRM.
The definition of those NRM-specific XML element types complies with the
generic mapping rules defined in 3GPP TS 32.616 [3].
## A.3.2 XML schema \"inventoryNrm.xsd\"
The following XML schema inventoryNrm.xsd is the NRM-specific schema for the
Inventory Management NRM IRP IS alternative 1 defined in 3GPP TS 28.632 [1].
