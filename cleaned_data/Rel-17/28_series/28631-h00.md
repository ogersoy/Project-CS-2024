# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management; as identified below:
32.690: Inventory Management (IM): Requirements
**28.631:** **Inventory Management (IM) Network Resource Model (NRM)
Integration Reference Point (IRP); Requirements**
28**.** 632**:** Inventory Management (IM) Network Resource Model (NRM)
Integration Reference Point (IRP); Information Service (IS)
28.633: Inventory Management (IM) Network Resource Model Integration Reference
Point (IRP), Solution Set (SS) definitions
Inventory Management (IM), in general, provides the operator with the ability
to assure correct and effective operation of the 3G network as it evolves. IM
actions have the objective to monitor the actual configuration on the Network
Elements (NEs) and Network Resources (NRs), and they may be initiated by the
operator or by functions in the Operations Systems (OSs) or NEs. The final
goal of IM is the establishment of an accurate and timely model of the actual
inventory in the NEs or NRs.
IM actions may be requested to reflect changes initiated by Configuration
Management (CM) actions or to make sure that the inventory model is in synch
with the actual inventory. IM actions are initiated either as single actions
on single NEs of the 3G network or as part of a complex procedure involving
actions on many resources/objects in one or several NEs.
# 1 Scope
The present document defines, in addition to the requirements defined in 3GPP
TS 32.101 [1], 3GPP TS 32.102 [2] and 3GPP TS 32.600 [3], the requirements for
the present IRP: Inventory Management (IM )Network Resource Model (NRM) IRP.
