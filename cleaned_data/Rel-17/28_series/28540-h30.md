# 4 Concepts and background
## 4.1 NR and NG-RAN deployment scenarios
According to NG-RAN architecture defined in 3GPP TS 38.300 [3], An NG-RAN node
is either a gNB or an ng-eNB connected to 5GC.
A gNB may consist of a gNB-CU and one or more gNB-DU(s), and a gNB-CU may
consist of a gNB-CU-CP and one or more gNB-CU-UP. From functional split point
of view, there have following gNB deployment scenarios which are specified in
3GPP TS 38.401 [4]:
1) gNB which does not consist split function.
2) gNB which consists of gNB-CU and gNB-DU(s).
3) gNB which consists of gNB-CU-CP, gNB-CU-UP(s) and gNB-DU(s).
Abovementioned deployment scenarios apply to en-gNB also.
Part of gNB (e.g. gNB-CU) can be deployed as virtualized network function.
## 4.2 MR-DC
Besides single connectivity operation, E-UTRAN, NR and NG-RAN support Multi-
RAT Dual Connectivity (MR-DC) operation defined in 3GPP TS 37.340 [5], which
can be further divided into following two categories based on connected core
network types.
1) MR-DC with the EPC via EN-DC, the NR node in EN-DC is called en-gNB.
2) MR-DC with the 5GC via either NG-RAN E-UTRA-NR Dual Connectivity (NGEN-DC)
or NR-E-UTRA Dual Connectivity (NE-DC).
There are different user plane connectivity options of the master node and
secondary node involved in MR-DC (see detail in 3GPP TS 37.340 [5]).
## 4.3 5GC architecture
The 5G architecture is defined as service-based and the interaction between
network functions is represented in the following two ways:
\- Service-based representation
\- Reference point representation
The network functions composed 5GC is specified in 3GPP TS 23.501 [2], network
functions within the 5GC control plane shall only use service-based interfaces
for their interactions.
## 4.4 Data storage architecture
5G system architecture allows UDM, PCF and NEF to store their data in the
Unified Data Repository (UDR), and allows any NF to store and retrieve its
unstructured data (e.g. UE context) into/from a UDSF.
## 4.5 AMF load balancing insides AMF Region/AMF Set
When deploying AMF Region or AMF Set, AMF load balancing insides AMF
Region/AMF Set is achieved by setting a weight factor for each AMF according
to its relative capacity compared to other AMFs, see detail in clause 5.19.3
of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
## 4.6 5GC NFs supporting edge computing
Edge computing enables operator and 3rd party services to be hosted close to
the UE\'s access point of attachment, so as to achieve an efficient service
delivery through the reduced end-to-end latency and load on the transport
network, see details in clause 5.13 of 3GPP TS 23.501 [2].
## 4.7 General information for network slice instance and network slice subnet
instance
The general information used to describe network slice instance and network
slice subnet instance are specified in TS 28.531 [6].
## 4.8 Remote Interference Management
A remote interference scenario may involve a number of victim and aggressor
cells, where the gNBs execute Remote Interference Management (RIM)
coordination on behalf of their respective cells. Aggressor and victim gNBs or
cells can be grouped into semi-static sets, where each cell is assigned a set
ID, and is configured with a RIM Reference Signal (RIM-RS) and the radio
resources associated with the set ID. As defined in TS 38.300 [3].
## 4.9 Access Control
Access control ensures that an MnS provided by an MnS producer can be consumed
only by an authenticated entity with appropriate authorization as specified in
TS 28.533 [9].
