In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.

# 4 Concepts and Background
## 4.1 Policy MnS
Introduction of service-based architecture for 5G, expanding the scope of
policy management, the policy management for 5G will be built on service-based
management architecture.
A Policy MnS producer has the following capabilities:
\- Storing the defined network policy.
\- Detecting policy conflict, reporting the conflict information and give
suggestions for solving the conflict.
\- Making the policy execution decisions, which means it take the decision to
trigger or perform an action.
\- Evaluating the effectiveness of the network policy execution.
The MnS of various kinds are specified for deployment over many standardized
reference interfaces. So, the policy MnS could in principle, be specified for
deployment over the same set of standardized reference interfaces, as a
replacement of or as an addition to the policy related driven MnS.
## 4.2 Policy conflict detection and resolution
There may be policy conflict problem, which is a new activated policy may be
conflict with an existing activated policy.
When the Policy MnS producer detects the conflict, it can report the conflict
information and give suggestions to solve it. ETSI GR NFV‑IFA 023 [4]
descripts policy conflict detection UCs and how to resolve them.
There are multiple scenarios for policy conflict, for example:
1) If the events are the same and the same condition are triggered (e.g.
scaling policy on a VNF), but two policies have different actions, the
conflict should be detected and resolved.
2) If the event and condition of two policies are not be the same, but the
different actions (e.g. scaling policy vs. termination policy on a VNF) are
towards the same entity. The conflict should be detected and resolved.
3) If scenario 1) or 2) is enforced by different Policy MnS producers. The
conflict should be detected and resolved.
# 5 Business level requirements
