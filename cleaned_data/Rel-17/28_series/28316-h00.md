# 4 Data formats for Plug and Connect
## 4.1 Client identification in DHCP requests
### 4.1.1 DHCPv4
This clause describes DHCP options for use with DHCP for IPv4 (DHCPv4) that NE
uses to identify itself in DHCP requests in Plug and Connect (PnC).
The NE performing the Initial IP Autoconfiguration procedure specified in
clause 5.2 of 3GPP TS 28.315 [3], using IPv4 based network stack, may identify
itself using Vendor Class Identifier DHCPv4 option 60 as specified in RFC 2132
[6]. The format of Vendor Class identifier shall follow the rules specified in
clause 9.13 of RFC 2132 [6], which is illustrated in table 4.1.1.1:
Table 4.1.1.1: Format of Vendor Class Identifier
**Code** **Length** **Vendor Class Identifier**
* * *
60 n i1 i2 ... octet octet octet octet octet
The NE may identify itself as Multi-Vendor Plug and Connect (MvPnC) compatible
DHCPv4 client using DHCPv4 option 60 in the following way:
\- DHCPv4 option code 60;
\- Length 5 bytes;
\- Vendor class identifier \"MvPnC\".
The use of Vendor Class Identifier DHCPv4 option 60 with specific value MvPnC
is illustrated in table 4.1.1.2.
Table 4.1.1.2: Use of Vendor Class Identifier

The NE may identify itself as MvPnC compatible DHCPv4 client using DHCPv4
option 124 in the following way:
\- DHCPv4 option code 124;
\- Vendor enterprise number 10415 for \"3GPP\";
\- Vendor class data length 5 bytes;
\- Vendor class data \"MvPnC\".
The use of Vendor- Identifying Vendor Class DHCPv4 option 124 with specific
value MvPnC is illustrated in table 4.1.1.4.
Table 4.1.1.4: Use of Vendor-Identifying Vendor Class
**Code** | **Length** **1-255** | **Enterprise Number 1** | **Vendor Class Data 1** | **…** |  |  |  |  |

octet | octet | 4 octets | octet | octet | octet | octet | octet | octet | …  
The order of vendor-identifying vendor class contained in option 124 does not
matter, and any other vendor-identifying vendor class data with a different
IANA enterprise number, if required by the vendor, may appear before or after
the 3GPP vendor class.
### 4.1.2 DHCPv6
This clause describes DHCP options for use with DHCP for IPv6 (DHCPv6) that NE
uses to identify itself in DHCP requests in Plug and Connect (PnC).
The NE performing the Initial IP Autoconfiguration procedure specified in
clause 5.2 of 3GPP TS 28.315 [3], using IPv6 based network stack, shall
identify itself using the Vendor Class DHCPv6 option 16 as specified in RFC
8415 [5]. The format of Vendor Class shall follow the rules specified in
clause 21.16 of RFC 8415 [5], which is illustrated in table 4.1.2.1:

## 4.2 Entities information in DHCP replies
### 4.2.1 DHCPv4
This clause describes DHCP options for use with DHCP for IPv4 (DHCPv4) to send
configuration information to NE in DHCP replies in Plug and Connect (PnC).
The information that NE receives from the DHCPv4 server while performing the
Initial IP Autoconfiguration procedure specified in clause 5.2 of 3GPP TS
28.315 [3], using IPv4 based networking stack, may be classified in two
categories: basic IP configuration and vendor specific configuration.
The basic IP configuration information is documented in RFC 2131 [8] and RFC
2132 [6] and may include the following:
\- IP address (\"yiaddr\" field in [8]);
\- Subnet Mask (option 1 in [6]);
\- Router(s) (option 3 in [6]);
\- IP address(es) of the DNS server(s) (option 6 in [6]);
\- Domain Name (option 15 in [6]).
The vendor specific configuration is described in detail in clauses 4.2.3,
4.2.4 and 4.2.5.
The DHCPv4 option \"Vendor Specific Information\" specified in the clause 8.4
of RFC 2132 [6] is used as an opaque container carrying the vendor specific
configuration from the DHCPv4 server to the NE performing the PnC procedure.
The format of Vendor Specific Information shall follow the rules specified in
clause 8.4 of RFC 2132 [6].
The use of Vendor Specific Information DHCPv4 option 43 for PnC is illustrated
in table 4.2.1.1.
Table 4.2.1.1: Use of the Vendor Specific Information
+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | **C |** Len | **V | | | | | | | | ode** | gth**| endor | | | | | | | | | | Spe | | | | | | | | |** 1- | cific | | | | | | | | | 255**| Inf | | | | | | | | | | ormat | | | | | | | | | | ion** | | | | | | | +=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+ | | | **Con |** Con | **\ | | | | | | | | figur | figur | ...** | | | | | | | | ation | ation | | | | | | | | | attr | attr | | | | | | | | | ibute | ibute | | | | | | | | | 1**| 2** | | | | | | +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | * | **n** | **Ty | * |** D | **Ty | * |** D | **\ | | *43** | | pe1**| *Leng | ata** | pe2**| *Leng | ata** | ...**| | | | | th1** | | | th2** | | | +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+ | octet | octet | octet | octet | n | octet | octet | n | ... | | | | | | o | | | o | | | | | | | ctets | | | ctets | | +-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+
The DHCPv4 option 43 may be used to carry MvPnC specific configuration from
DHCPv4 server to the NE which identifies itself as MvPnC compatible DHCPv4
client using DHCPv4 option 60 as specified in the clause 4.1.1 of the present
document. The MvPnC specific configuration is encoded in the field of \"Vendor
Specific Information\" in table 4.2.1.1.
Alternatively, the DHCPv4 option \"Vendor-Identifying Vendor Specific
Information\" specified in the clause 4 of RFC 3925 [4] is used as an opaque
container carrying the Vendor specific configuration from the DHCPv4 server to
the NE performing the PnC procedure. The option contains one or more Vendor
Specific Information each identified by Enterprise Number. The format of
Vendor-Identifying Vendor Specific Information shall follow the rules
specified in clause 4 of RFC 3925 [4].
The use of Vendor-Identifying Vendor Specific Information DHCPv4 option 125
for PnC is illustrated in table 4.2.1.2.
Table 4.2.1.2: Use of Vendor-Identifying Vendor Specific Information
**Code** **Length 1-255** **Enterprise Number 1** **Data Length 1** **Vendor
Specific Information** **Enterprise Number 2** **...**

**y** **...** octet octet 4 octets octet octet octet n octets ... ... 4 octets
...
The DHCPv4 option 125 may be used to carry MvPnC specific configuration
corresponding to 3GPP registered IANA Enterprise Number from DHCPv4 server to
the NE which identifies itself as MvPnC compatible DHCPv4 client using DHCPv4
option 124 as specified in the clause 4.1.1 of the present document. Other
vendor specific configuration with a different IANA enterprise number, if
required by the vendor, may appear before or after the 3GPP MvPnC specific
configuration.
The use of Vendor-Identifying Vendor Specific Information DHCPv4 option 125
with 3GPP registered IANA Enterprise Number for MvPnC is illustrated in table
4.2.1.3.
Table 4.2.1.3: Use of Vendor-Identifying Vendor Specific Information for MvPnC
**Code** | **Length 1-255** | **Enterprise Number 1** | **Data Length 1** | **Vendor Specific Information** **(MvPnC Specific Configuration)** | **Enterprise Number 2** | **…** |  |  |  |

octet | octet | 4 octets | octet | octet | octet | n octets | … | … | 4 octets | …  
If the size of vendor specific configuration contained in \"Vendor Specific
Information\" option 43 and \"Vendor-Identifying Vendor Specific Information\"
option125 is greater than 255 bytes, the RFC 3396 [9] encoding is used.
To avoid ambiguity in the interpretation of string vendor specific
configuration attributes, the ASCII character encoding shall be used.
Standard network byte order shall be used with appropriate conversion function
at the NE (matching the local little-endian / big-endian byte order).
Some vendor specific configuration attributes may be missing (e.g. the SeGW
FQDN attribute may be not present if the SeGW IP address is present) or just
have zero length (type octet followed by length octet with value zero and no
data octets).
The qualifiers identifying which attributes are mandatory, Optional (O),
Conditional Mandatory (CM) or Conditional Optional (CO) and corresponding
conditions are defined it the clauses 4.2.3, 4.2.4 and 4.2.5.
The order of vendor specific configuration attribute is not important (e.g.
attribute of type or subopt-code \"1\" may appear after the attribute type or
subopt-code \"5\").
### 4.2.2 DHCPv6
This clause describes DHCP options for use with DHCP for IPv6 (DHCPv6) to send
configuration information to NE in DHCP replies in Plug and Connect (PnC).
The information that NE receives from the DHCPv6 server while performing the
Initial IP Autoconfiguration procedure specified in clause 5.2 of 3GPP TS
28.315 [3], using IPv6 based networking stack, may be classified in two
categories: basic IP configuration and vendor specific configuration.
The NE acquires its IP address can either through stateful or stateless IP
autoconfiguration. If IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration (SLAAC), as
specified in clause 5.5 of RFC 4862 [13], is used for Initial IP
Autoconfiguration, DHCPv6 is used in stateless mode.
The basic IP configuration information is documented in RFC 8415 [5] and RFC
3646 [10] and may include the following:
\- IP address (option 3 as per clause 21.4 and option 5 as per clause 21.6 in
[5], when DHCPv6 is not used in stateless mode)
\- IP address(es) of the DNS server(s) (option 23 in [10]);
\- Domain Name (option 24 in [10]).
The vendor specific configuration is described in detail in clauses 4.2.3,
4.2.4 and 4.2.5.
The DHCPv6 option \"Vendor Specific Information\" specified in the clause
21.17 of RFC 8415 [5] is used as an opaque container carrying the vendor
specific configuration from the DHCPv6 server to the NE performing the PnC
procedure. The format of Vendor Specific Information shall follow the rules
specified in clause 21.17 of RFC 8415 [5].
The use of Vendor Specific Information DHCPv6 option 17 for PnC is illustrated
in table 4.2.2.1.
Table 4.2.2.1: Use of the Vendor Specific Information
**Code** **Length** **Enterprise Number** **Vendor Specific Information**

octets 4 octets 2 octets 2 octets n octets 2 octets 2 octets n octets ...
The DHCPv6 option 17 may be used to carry MvPnC specific configuration
corresponding to 3GPP registered IANA Enterprise Number from DHCPv6 server to
the NE which identifies itself as MvPnC compatible DHCPv6 client using DHCPv6
option 16 as specified in the clause 4.1.2 of the present document.
The use of Vendor Specific Information DHCPv6 option 17 with 3GPP registered
IANA Enterprise Number for MvPnC is illustrated in table 4.2.2.2.
Table 4.2.2.2: Use of the DHCPv6 Vendor Specific Information for MvPnC

2 octets | 2 octets | 4 octets | 2 octets | 2 octets | n octets | 2 octets | 2 octets | n octets | ...  
If the size of vendor specific configuration contained in \"Vendor Specific
Information\" option 17 is greater than 255 bytes, the RFC 3396 [9] encoding
is used.
To avoid ambiguity in the interpretation of string vendor specific
configuration attributes, the ASCII character encoding shall be used.
Standard network byte order shall be used with appropriate conversion function
at the NE (matching the local little-endian / big-endian byte order).
Some vendor specific configuration attributes may be missing (e.g. the SeGW
FQDN attribute may be not present if the SeGW IP address is present) or just
have zero length (type octet followed by length octet with value zero and no
data octets).
The qualifiers identifying which attributes are mandatory, Optional (O),
Conditional Mandatory (CM) or Conditional Optional (CO) and corresponding
conditions are defined it the clauses 4.2.3, 4.2.4 and 4.2.5.
The order of vendor specific configuration attribute is not important (e.g.
subopt-code \"1\" may appear after the subopt-code \"5\").
### 4.2.3 Certification Authority (CA/RA) server
This clause specifies the information about Certification Authority server
that NE receives from DHCP server in Initial IP Autoconfiguration procedure
specified in clause 5.2 of 3GPP TS 28.315 [3] and uses for Certificate

MvPnC specific configuration as specified in the clauses of 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 in
DHCP replies to the NE which identifies itself as MvPnC compatible DHCP
client.

## 4.3 Entities Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDN)
### 4.3.1 General
This clause describes the Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) used in Plug
and Connect (PnC) procedures.
The FQDNs used in PnC are in the form of a domain name as specified in IETF
RFC 1035 [15].
The sub-domains used in PnC are allocated within the \".3gppnetwork.org\"
domain.\ The GSM Association is in charge of allocating the new sub-domains of
\".3gppnetwork.org\" domain name.\ The procedure specified in Annex E of 3GPP
TS 23.003 [14] is used for the sub-domain allocation.
The FQDNs used in PnC follow the general encoding rules specified in clause
19.4.2.1 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [14].
The format of FQDNs used in PnC follows the \"\.\.\\" pattern.
NOTE: Where \"\.\.oam\" represents the \ shown
in the first row of table E.1 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [14].
The \ label is optional and is required in the operator deployments
where multiple instances of a particular network entity type are not provided
by the same vendor. If present, the \ label is in the form
\"vendor\\", where \ field corresponds to the ID of the vendor. The
specific deployment scenario (e.g. one network entity instance per vendor or
one network entity instance for all vendors) is not known to the NE when it
connects to the network. Therefore, it should first try to resolve the FQDN
containing the \ label and if it fails, try to resolve the FQDN
without the \ label.
The details of the \ label are described in clauses 4.3.2, 4.3.3 and
4.3.4.
The \ label is the operator\'s OAM realm domain name in the form of
\"oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org\", where \"\\" and \"\\"
fields correspond to the MNC and MCC of the operator\'s PLMN. Both the
\"\\" and \"\\" fields are 3 digits long. If the MNC of the PLMN is
2 digits, then a zero shall be added at the beginning.
An example of an OAM realm domain name is:
> MCC = 123;
>
> MNC = 45;
Which gives the OAM realm domain name: \"oam.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\".
### 4.3.2 Certification Authority (CA/RA) server
The Certification Authority server (CA/RA) FQDN is derived as follows. The
\"cara\" \ label is added in front of the operator\'s OAM realm domain
name:
> cara.oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
If particular operator deployment scenario has multiple CA/RA servers (one per
vendor), the \ label is added in front of the \"cara\" label:
> vendor\.cara.oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
>
> An example of a CA/RA FQDN is:
>
> MCC = 123;
>
> MNC = 45;
>
> ViD = abcd;
>
> Which gives the CA/RA FQDN: \"cara.oam.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\" and
> \"vendorabcd.cara.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\".
### 4.3.3 Security Gateway (SeGW)
The Security Gateway (SeGW) FQDN is derived as follows.\ The \"segw\"
\ label is added in front of the operator\'s OAM realm domain name:
> segw.oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
If particular operator deployment scenario has multiple Security Gateways (one
per vendor), the \ label is added in front of the \"segw\" label:
> vendor\.segw.oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
>
> An example of a SeGW FQDN is:
>
> MCC = 123;
>
> MNC = 45;
>
> ViD = abcd;
>
> Which gives the SeGW FQDN: \"segw.oam.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\" and
> \"vendorabcd.segw.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\".
### 4.3.4 Software Configuration Server (SCS)
The SCS FQDN is derived as follows:\ The \"scs\" \ label is added in
front of the operator\'s OAM realm domain name:
> scs.oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
If a particular operator deployment scenario has multiple SCSs (one per
vendor), the \ label is added in front of the \"scs\" label:
> vendor\.scs.oam.mnc\.mcc\.3gppnetwork.org
>
> An example of a SCS FQDN is:
>
> MCC = 123;
>
> MNC = 45;
>
> ViD = abcd;
>
> Which gives the SCS FQDN: \"scs.oam.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\" and
> \"vendorabcd.scs.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\".
>
> SCS can be element manager (EM), for example in IRP based architecture,
> \"em\" system label is added in front of the operator\'s OAM realm domain
> name, an example of an EM FQDN is:
>
> \"em.oam.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\" and
> \"vendorabcd.em.mnc045.mcc123.3gppnetwork.org\".
