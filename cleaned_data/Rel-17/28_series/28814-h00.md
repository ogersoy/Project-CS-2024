# 4 Concepts and overview
## 4.1 Concept of edge computing management
Figure 4.1-1 shows the roles and relationship of service providers involved in
the deployment of edge computing services (see annex B in TS 23.558 [2]). The
application service provider (ASP) is responsible for the creation of edge
application servers (EAS) and application clients (AC). The edge computing
service provider (ECSP) is responsible for the deployment of edge data
networks (EDN) that contain EAS, and edge enable server (EES) that provides
the configuration information to edge enabler client (EEC), enabling AC to
exchange application data traffic with the EAS. PLMN operator is responsible
for the deployment of 5G network functions, such as 5GC and 5G NR.
The ASP can have service agreement with one or more ECSP(s) and may request
the ECSP to deploy one or more EAS in the EDN. Upon receipt of ASP\'s request,
the ECSP should deploy the EAS(s), and then register the EAS(s) to the EES in
the EDN. The ECSP can have service agreement with one or more PLMN operators
and may request the PLMN operators to connect EAS and EES with 5GC network
functions. The edge configuration server (ECS) may reside in PLMN operator or
ECSP, and provide functions needed for the edge enabler client (EEC) to
connect with an EES (see clause 6.3.4 in [1]).
3GPP management system is intended to manage the 3GPP defined network
functions (e.g., UPF, PCF, EES, ECS, EAS, EASF, ...), and services. To support
the edge computing management, the 3GPP management system consists of:
\- PLMN management system: responsible for the orchestration and management of
the mobile networks.
\- ECSP management system: responsible for the orchestration and management of
the EDN.
NOTE: In the case that PLMN operator owns the EDN, then 3GPP management system
is equivalent to PLMN management system that is responsible for the
orchestration and management of the mobile networks and EDN.
Figure 4.1-1: Relationship of service providers in the edge computing network
deployment
Figure 4.1-2 depicts an example of edge computing networks, where the mobile
networks are connected to 2 EDNs that each contains 2 EASs. In the EDN #1, the
EAS(s) are connected to the UPF via the N6 interface to carry the applications
data traffic, while EAS(s) and EES are connected to the PCF via the N5 /
Edge-7 / Edge-2 interfaces (see TS 23.501 [4], and the definition of Edge 2
and 7 in TS 23.558 [2], where the EES acting as a trusted AF in 5GC), on which
information can be sent to SMF to influence traffic routing. In the EDN #2,
EAS(s) and EES are connected to NEF via the N33 / Edge-7 / Edge-2 interfaces
(see TS 23.501 [4], where the N33 is the reference point between NEF and AF),
on which information can be sent to SMF via PCF to influence traffic routing
that supports the traffic management in TS 23.558 [2]. The ECS residing in the
mobile networks is connected to NEF in the mobile networks via N33 / Edge-8
interface and EES via Edge-6 interfaces.
Figure 4.1-2: Edge computing networks
The reference architectures for supporting Edge Computing are based on the
reference architectures specified in clause 4.2 of TS 23.501 [4]. The
following reference architectures are further depicting the relationship
between the 5GS and EAS for non-roaming and LBO roaming scenarios which
specified in clause 4,2 of TS 23.548 [13].
Figure 4.1-3 depicts 5GS architecture for non-roaming scenario supporting Edge
Computing with UL CL/BP.
Figure 4.1-3: 5GS providing access to EAS with UL CL/BP for non-roaming
scenario
The Edge Application Server Discovery Function (EASDF) specified in clause 4,2
of TS 23.548 [13] for EAS discovery and selection, handling the DNS messages
and so on. And the EASDF has user plane connectivity with the PSA UPF over N6
for the transmission of DNS signaling exchanged with the UE.
NOTE: Only the control plane of EASDF is depicted in the figure, the user
plane between the EASDF and the UPF (i.e., over which the DNS messages are
exchanged) is part of N6. Additionally, the EADSF may have direct connectivity
with the local parts of one or more Data Networks (DN).
# 5\. Management Aspect of Edge
An architecture for enabling edge service is defined in TS 23.558[2]. The
architecture includes various edge components and interfaces working together
to enable edge services. EAS, EES and ECS, as defined in [2], are considered
to be edge components deployed in a 3GPP network as 3GPP Network Functions.
The management aspect of edge includes (not limited to) the following:
\- Lifecyle management of EDN as a 3GPP Local Data Network.
\- Lifecycle management of edge components including EAS, EES and ECS.
\- Performance Assurance of edge components including EAS, EES and ECS.
\- Fault Supervision of edge components including EAS, EES and ECS.
\- Virtual resource management for edge components including EAS, EES and ECS.
EDN capability management including the type and capabilities of EAS(s)
available in the EDN.
3GPP 5GS supports Edge computing deployed in the DN beyond the PSA UPF. The
reference architecture for supporting Edge Computing is defined in TS 23.548
[13]. In this architecture, a new network function of Edge Application Server
Discovery Function (EASDF) is specified for supporting Edge Computing.
The management aspect of 5GC for supporting Edge Computing includes (not
limited to) the following:
\- Lifecycle management of EASDF and corresponding interface.
\- Performance Assurance of EASDF and corresponding interface.
\- Fault Supervision of EASDF and corresponding interface.

_The goal is to_ enable the ASP to request for instantiation of the EAS(s) in
a particular EDN, or in a set of EDNs, as per the EAS requirements.
#### 6.2.1.2 Description
The lifecycle management of edge components is considered to be a crucial
management aspect. EAS is the application server resident in the Edge Data
Network, performing the server functions. This use case pertains to the case
when the EAS is to be deployed on the operators EDN being managed by the
operator\'s management system. The lifecycle of EAS (instantiation,
termination, scaling, etc) need to be managed. Further, there can be multiple
Edge Data Network (EDN) present/serving a particular edge location. The
implication is that a UE in a particular location can be served by multiple
EDNs. A restriction is that an EAS deployed in a particular EDN (serving the
area represented by LADN) can only be available to UEs when moved in the
serving area of the same EDN. This makes it critical for application service
provider to have their EAS deployed at appropriate EDN(s) to provide high
performance services for the UE. This use case enables deployment of an EAS in
a particular EDN, or in a set of EDNs, as per the EAS requirements.
1\. A consumer request for EAS(s) instantiation providing EAS requirements
including (not limited to) deployment requirements, QoS requirements, service
areas.
2\. The ECSP management system determines in which EDN the EAS(s) will be
deployed, based on the deployment requirements. For example, the selection of
EDN in which the EAS(s) will be instantiated may be determined by the QoS and
service areas requirements.

following operations:
\- Instantiate the EAS VNF(s).
\- Connect the EAS(s) to the EES.

# 7 Potential solutions
## 7.1 EAS lifecycle management using LCM MnS
### 7.1.1 General
This clause provides potential solutions for use case of the deployment of
edge application server(s) (see clause 6.1.1and 6.2.1). It focuses on the
management services provided by ESCP to support EAS lifecycle management.
One key issue on the EAS LCM is that PLMN operators may not disclose
information related to the mobile networks to the 3^rd^ party operators (e.g.,
ECSP). Without such information, ASP is not able to determine where EAS VNF
should be instantiated to meet the end-to-end QoS requirements required by the
EAS. Therefore, ASP needs send a request to ECSP with attributes, such as the
service area. the geographical service area that the EAS serves (see clause
8.2.4 in [2]), EAS software image, and QoS requirements (e.g., end-to-end
latency, ...), ... etc. ECSP will decide how many EAS instances, and where the
EAS instances should be deployed that can serve the UEs in the service area
while meeting the QoS requirements. Then, ECSP communicates with ETSI NFV MANO
[7] to perform EAS LCM.
### 7.1.2 EAS lifecycle management with LCM MnS
Figure 7.1.2-1 shows that the ASP requests the EAS lifecycle management via
the LCM MnS.
Figure 7.1.2-1: EAS lifecycle management via LCM MnS

IOC to request the provisioning MnS Producer to instantiate the EAS.
2) Provisioning MnS Producer selects the appropriate EDN (or set of EDNs)
based on the EAS requirements provided in the request. The EDN can be selected
either by considering the individual requirement or by grouping the multiple
requirements as single selection criteria. When the grouping is used all the
requirement specified as part of a group should be satisfied. Following are
examples of various grouped selection criteria:
\- Latency and Cost can be combined as one selection criteria influencing the
selection as in what latency can be assured in what cost.
\- Geo-location and Latency can be combined as one selection criteria
influencing the selection as in at what location the requested latency can be
provided depending on the target geographical area.
\- Affinity/Anti-affinity and Cost can be combined as one selection criteria
influencing the selection as in what cost will be incurred to satisfy
Affinity/Anti-affinity with a particular existing Edge Application.

## 7.9 EAS performance assurance
### 7.9.1 General
This clause provides potential solutions for the use case of the EAS
performance assurance (see clause 6.2.9). It collects the EAS KPI or
performance measurements that are defined in Table 7.x.1-1 (see clause 8.2.5
in TS 23.558 [2]).

* * *
Note: The Information elements defined in the table (7.9.1-1) need to be
defined as EAS performance measurements.
Figure 7.9.1-1 shows that the performance assurance MnS is used by consumer,
such as ASP to collect the EAS measurements from ECSP management system.
Figure 7.9.1-1: EAS measurements collection via performance assurance MnS
### 7.9.2 Measurements collection via performance job control
ASP consumes the measurement job control MnS with createMeasurementJob
operation (see TS 28.550 [8]) to request ECSP management system to collect EAS
measurements, such as available resources (e.g., available compute, available
memory, available storage), and the connection bandwidth on the network
interfaces (see clause 8.2.5 in TS 23.558 [2]).
The createMeasurementJob operation indicates whether the EAS measurement data
will be sent via data file reporting service or data streaming service (see
clause 7 in TS 28.550 [8]).
The ASP as the consumer of performance data file reporting MnS executes the
following steps to receive the measurement data via the data file reporting
service:
\- ASP invokes the subscribe operation (see TS 28.532 [9]) to subscribe to
receive notifications from the ECSP management system.
\- ASP receives a notification from MnS producer indicating the performance
data file is ready.
\- ASP fetches the measurement data from the MnS producer.
The ECSP management system as the producer of performance data streaming MnS
executes the following steps to send the measurements to ASP via the data
streaming service (see Annex D in TS 28.550 [8]):
\- The MnS producer invokes the establishStreamingConnection operation to
establish a streaming connection with ASP for sending the streaming data.
\- The MnS producer collects the measurement data and invokes the
reportStreamData operation to send the streaming data to ASP.
### 7.9.3 Measurements collection via configurable measurement control
ASP consumes the provisioning MnS with createMOI operation to create a
PerfMetricJob MOI to request ECSP management system to collect EAS
measurements, such as available resources (e.g., available compute, available
memory, available storage), and connection bandwidth on the network interfaces
(see Annex D in TS 28.550 [8]).
The PerfMetricJob IOC indicates whether the EAS measurement data will be sent
via data file reporting service or data streaming service (See clause 4.3.31
in TS 28.622 [10]).
The ASP as the consumer of performance data file reporting MnS executes the
following steps to receive the measurement data via the data file reporting
service:
\- ASP invokes the subscribe operation (see TS 28.532 [9]) to subscribe to
receive notifications from the ECSP management system.
\- ASP receives a notification from MnS producer indicating the performance
data file is ready.
\- ASP fetches the measurement data from the MnS producer.
The ECSP management system as the producer of performance data streaming MnS
executes the following steps to send the measurements to ASP via the data
streaming service (see Annex D in TS 28.550 [8]):
\- The MnS producer invokes the establishStreamingConnection operation to
establish a streaming connection with ASP for sending the streaming data.
\- The MnS producer collects the measurement data and invokes the
reportStreamData operation to send the streaming data to ASP.
## 7.10 UPF selection to assist EAS deployment
### 7.10.1 General
This clause provides potential solutions for use case of UPF selection to
support EAS deployment (see clause 6.2.11). It is assumed that the EAS has
been deployed based on the solution described in clause 7.1.
This solution applies to the scenario where PLMN operator had deployed UPF(s)
in 5GC, and ECSP management system needs to request PLMN management system to
select a UPF in 5GC to serve the EAS.
### 7.10.2 Solution #1 -- UPF selection using LCM MnS
Figure 7.10.2-1 shows that ECSP management system requests PLMN management
system to identify a UPF via the LCM MnS.
Figure 7.10.2-1: UPF selection via the LCM MnS
ECSP management system consumes the LCM MnS with operation selectUpfReq to
request the PLMN management system to select a UPF, with the following
attributes:
\- EAS Topological Service Area: A Topological Service Area is defined in
relationship with a UE\'s point of connection to the network, such as: a
collection of Cell IDs, Tracking Area Identities or the PLMN ID (see clause
7.3.3.2 in TS 23.558 [2]).
\- EAS Geographical Service Area: A Geographical Service Area is an area that
is specified by geographical units such as: Geographical coordinates ID (see
clause 7.3.3.3 in TS 23.558 [2]).
\- List of N6 traffic routing requirements: The N6 traffic routing information
and/or routing profile ID corresponding to each EAS DNAI.
PLMN management system sends a selectUpfResp to notify the consumer that the
request is in progress.
PLMN management system finds a UPF among the UPF(s) being deployed, based on
the EAS Topological Service Area, EAS Geographical Service Area (see clause
7.3.3 in TS 28.558 [2]), and QoS requirements, and may perform the following
operations if no UPF can be found:
\- Instantiate a new UPF.
\- Configure the SMF -- SMFFunction IOC to add the UPF to the available UPF
list (see clause 6.3.3.2 in TS 23.501 [4]).
PLMN management system sends the selectUpfResp to notify ECSP management
system with the UPF information for the UPF being selected.
### 7.10.3 Solution #2 -- UPF selection using provisioning MnS
Figure 7.10.3-1 shows that ECSP management system requests PLMN management
system to identify a UPF via the provisioning MnS.
Figure 7.10.3-1: UPF selection via the provisioning MnS
ECSP management system needs to send the UPF selection requirements in an IOC.
So, the upfSelection IOC should be defined to support the UPF selection
solution. The upfSelection IOC should contain, but not limited to, the
following attributes:
\- EAS Topological Service Area: A Topological Service Area is defined in
relationship with a UE\'s point of connection to the network, such as: a
collection of Cell IDs, Tracking Area Identities or the PLMN ID (see clause
7.3.3.2 in TS 23.558 [2]).
\- EAS Geographical Service Area: A Geographical Service Area is an area that
is specified by geographical units such as: Geographical coordinates ID (see
clause 7.3.3.3 in TS 23.558 [2]).
\- List of N6 traffic routing requirements: The N6 traffic routing information
and/or routing profile ID corresponding to each EAS DNAI (see table 8.2.4.1 in
TS 23.558 [2]).
ECSP management system consumes the provisioning MnS with operation
_createMOI_ for upfSelection IOC with EAS Topological Service Area, EAS
Geographical Service Area, list of N6 traffic routing requirements, EAS
connection information, to request PLMN management system to select a UPF
information.
PLMN management system finds a UPF among the UPF(s) being deployed, based on
the service area requirements (e.g., Topological Service Area, Geographical
Service Area, (see clause 7.3.3 in TS 28.558 [2])) and QoS requirements,
contained in the upfSelection IOC, and may perform the following operations if
no UPF can be found:
\- Instantiate a new UPF.
\- Configure the SMF -- SMFFunction IOC to add the UPF to the available UPF
list (see clause 6.3.3.2 in TS 23.501 [4]).
PLMN management system creates the upfSelection MOI, and sends
_notifyMOICreation_ with attributeList, including the UPF information.
PLMN management system returns the output parameters with the UPF information.
## 7.11 EAS performance assurance assisted by 5GC NF performance measurements
### 7.11.1 General
This clause provides potential solutions for the use case of the 5GC NF
performance assurance (see clause 6.2.12). Figure 7.11.1-1 shows that ECSP
management system utilizes the performance assurance MnS to collect the 5GC NF
measurements from PLMN management system.
Figure 7.11.1-1: 5GC NF measurements collection via performance assurance MnS
### 7.11.2 Measurements collection via performance job control
ECSP management system consumes the measurement job control MnS with
createMeasurementJob operation (see TS 28.550 [8]) to request PLMN management
system to collect the measurements of 5GC NFs (e.g., UPF, PCF, ...) that are
related to the EAS performance. The createMeasurementJob operation indicates
whether the 5GC NF measurement data will be sent via data file reporting
service or data streaming service (see clause 7 in TS 28.550 [8]).
#### 7.11.2.1 Measurement data sent via data file reporting service
ECSP management system as the consumer of performance data file reporting MnS
executes the following steps to receive the measurement data via the data file
reporting service:

notifications from the PLMNmanagement system for the measurements related to
the EAS performance.
\- Receives a notification from MnS producer indicating the performance data
file is ready.
\- Fetches the measurement data from the MnS producer.
#### 7.11.2.2 Measurement data sent via data streaming service
PLMN management system as the producer of performance data streaming MnS
executes the following steps to send the measurements to ECSP management
system via the data streaming service (see Annex D in TS 28.550 [8]):
\- Invokes the establishStreamingConnection operation to establish a streaming
connection with ECSP management system for sending the streaming data.
\- Collects the measurement data and invokes the reportStreamData operation to
send the streaming data to ECSP management system.
### 7.11.3 Measurements collection via configurable measurement control
ECSP management system consumes the provisioning MnS with createMOI operation
to create a PerfMetricJob MOI to request ECSP management system to collect the
measurements of 5GC NFs (e.g., UPF, PCF, ...) that are related to the EAS
performance. The PerfMetricJob IOC indicates whether the EAS measurement data
will be sent via data file reporting service or data streaming service (See
clause 4.3.31 in TS 28.622 [10]).
#### 7.11.3.1 Measurement data sent via data file reporting service
ECSP management system as the consumer of performance data file reporting MnS
executes the following steps to receive the measurement data via the data file
reporting service:
\- Invokes the subscribe operation (see TS 28.532 [9]) to subscribe to receive
notifications from the ECSP management system.
\- Receives a notification from MnS producer indicating the performance data
file is ready.
\- Fetches the measurement data from the MnS producer.
#### 7.11.3.2 Measurement data sent via data streaming service
PLMN management system as the producer of performance data streaming MnS
executes the following steps to send the measurements to ASP via the data
streaming service (see Annex D in TS 28.550 [8]):
\- Invokes the establishStreamingConnection operation to establish a streaming
connection with ECSP management system for sending the streaming data.
\- Collects the measurement data and invokes the reportStreamData operation to
send the streaming data to ECSP management system.
NOTE: How a consumer receives a subset of measurements for a NF is out of
scope of this document.
## 7.12 EAS fault supervision assisted by 5GC NF alarms
### 7.12.1 General
This clause provides potential solutions for the use case of the 5GC NF fault
supervision (see clause 6.2.13). Figure 7.12.1-1 shows that ECSP management
system utilizes the fault supervision MnS to receive alarms associated with
5GC NFs (e.g., UPF, PCF, ...) that may impact the EAS performance from PLMN
management system.
Figure 7.12.1-1: Receive 5GC NF alarms via fault supervision MnS
### 7.12.2 Solution for 5GC NF alarms
ECSP management system consumes the FS Data Report for NF MnS with the
subscribe operation to subscribe to PLMN management system to receive alarm
notifications for a 5GC NF (e.g., UPG, PCF) that may impact the EAS
performance (see clause 6.3 in TS 28.545 [12]).
PLMN management system sends a notifyNewAlarm notification to ECSP management
system indicating that the alarm(s) for a 5GC NF have been detected by NF FS
MnS producer.
## 7.13 EAS configuration with EES address
### 7.13.1 General
This clause provides potential solutions for use cases of the EAS
configuration with the EES address (see clause 6.2.14).
### 7.13.2 Solution
Figure 7.x.2.1-1 shows that the ECSP consumer requests the ECSP management
system to configure the EES address at the EASFunction IOC. It is assumed that
the EASFunction MOI has been created.
Figure 7.13.2.1-1: EAS configuration using provisioning MnS
To support this solution, the EASFunction IOCs should contain the following
attributes:
\- eesAddress: the address of EAS (e.g., URI, IP address)
A consumer consumes the provisioning MnS with operation _modifyMOIAttributes_
to request ECSP management system to configure the eesAddress attribute(s) in
EASFunction or EP MOI.
ECSP management system sends notifyMOIAttributeValueChange to notify the
consumer that the eesAddress attribute(s) in EASFunction or EP MOI have been
modified.
## 7.14 EASDF lifecycle management using provisioning MnS
### 7.14.1 General
To support EASDF deployment via provisioning MnS, the following IOC should be
defined:
\- EASDFFunction IOC that contains the following, but not limited to,
attributes:
\- EASDFFunction IOC ID: Naming attribute inherited from ManagedFunction.
\- EASDF Traffic function ID: the unique identity of EASDF Instance.
\- EASDF profile information elements: for EASDF Discovery and Selection (see
TS.23.548 [13]), the detail content of nfprofile is defined in TS 29.510.
### 7.14.2 EASDF instantiation
The procedure of NF instance creation (see clause 7.10 in TS28.531 [5]) can be
reused for EASDF instantiation.
### 7.14.3 EASDF termination
The procedure of NF instance deletion (see clause 7.12 in TS28.531 [5]) can be
reused for EASDF termination.
# 8 Evaluation of potential solutions
## 8.1 General
This clause evaluates the solutions, based on LCM MnS and provisioning MnS,
which are used to support the deployment of EAS, EES, ECS, and UPF NFs.
## 8.2 Synchronous vs. asynchronous solutions
Figure 8.1-1 shows the flow diagrams for the deployment of EAS, EES, and ECS
based on LCM MnS (see clause 7.1, 7.3, and 7.5) that are based on the
asynchronous solution, where a consumer may not receive the result of
operation immediately, since interaction with ETSI NFV MANO is needed for NF
instantiation. For example, when a consumer invokes the instantiateNfReq
operation, ECSP management system returns instantiateNfReq to indicate the
operation is in progress, and then sends notifyNfInstantiation to the consumer
to report the result of the operation.
Figure 8.2-1: Deployment of EAS, EES, ECS using LCM MnS
Figure 8.1-2 shows the flow diagrams for the deployment of EAS, EES, and ECS
based on provisioning MnS (see clause 7.2, 7.4, and 7.6) that are based on the
synchronous solution, where a consumer receives the result of operation in the
output parameters. For example, a consumer invokes the createMOI operation to
request ECSP management system to instantiate the NF by creating a MOI. Since
the instantiation operation involves ETSI NFV MANO that may take time, the
consumer will need to wait for the output with _status_ attribute (i.e.
OperationSucceeded, OperationFailed) to indicate the result of instantiation
(see clause 11.1.1.1.3 in TS 28.532 [9]). ECSP management system may send
notifyMOICreation (see clause 11.1.1.7 in TS 28.532 [9]) to notify the
subscribed consumers that a new MOI has been created. However, the
notification does not report the result of the operation.
Figure 8.2-2: Deployment of EAS, EES, ECS using provisioning MnS
## 8.3 Evaluation
LCM MnS:
\- Pro: This solution can be tailored to meet the requirements of the edge
computing deployments, and possibly other new applications.
\- Con: This is a new MnS that requires effort.
Provisioning MnS:
\- Pro: Reusing the existing solution that can be tailored to meet the
requirements of the edge computing deployments.
\- Con: extensions in the provisioning MnS are needed to support the
synchronous response nto indicate the progress, success, or failure of NF
instantiation.
## 8.4 Way forward
This clause includes the way forward from the evaluation of potential
solutions:
\- Extensions in the provisioning MnS are needed to support the asynchronous
mode of operations.
\- The solutions to support asynchronous responses may include the following
options with consideration of backward compatibility:
\- The enhancements of existing operations and notifications.
\- Define new operations to support asynchronous responses.
NOTE: The solution is to be decided in the normative phase.
# 9 Conclusions and recommendations
## 9.1 Conclusions
### 9.1.0 General
The present document identified the use cases and derived the requirements for
the deployment and performance assurance of EAS/EES/ECS, EAS profile
configuration, UPF instantiation to assist EAS deployment, access to 5GC
functions, and 5GC NF performance measurements and alarms to support EAS
performance assurance / fault supervision.
The study also investigated the multiple management systems scenarios where
PLMN management system and ECSP management system were introduced to support
multi-operators of ASP, ECSP and the PLMN operator, as described in TS 23.558
[2].
The study developed the potential solutions for supporting the requirements
using LCM MnS and provisioning MnS for the deployment of EAS, EES, and ECS NFs
among multiple management systems, and evaluated the solutions.
### 9.1.1 Edge Lifecycle Management
The lifecycle management of EAS, EES and ECS can be done as it is done for any
other Managed Function. Generic provisioning management service will be used
for the same. The related NRMs need to be defined.
Alternatively, the lifecycle management of EAS, EES and ECS can be done using
an edge specific management service i.e LCM MnS. The operations (component
Type A) and the NRMs (component Type B) need to be defined.
### 9.1.2 Edge Performance Assurance
Performance assurance of EAS, EES and ECS will be done as it is done for any
other Managed Function. Two alternatives have been identified;
a) using performance job control as defined in TS 28.550 [8],
b) using configurable measurement control as defined in TS 28.622 [10]. In
both the alternatives the performance measurements for EAS, EES and ECS need
to be defined.
91.3 Edge Fault Supervision
The FS Data Report for NF MnS is used to collect alarm notifications for 5C
NFs that may impact EAS performance. Similar, the FS Data Report for NF MnS
can be used to collect alarm notifications for EES and ECS.
### 9.1.4 Edge Deployment Support
In the EAS registration procedure the EAS sends a registration request with
the EAS profile to the EES. Some information elements in the EAS profile may
need to be configured by OAM. Generic provisioning MnS, acting on appropriate
NRM, can be used for this purpose. EAS profile parameters to be define as part
of 5G NRM.
When a new EAS is deployed, it is essential that 5GC has an UPF available with
sufficient resources as required in the EAS profile. Generic provisioning MnS
or LCM MnS can be used for this purpose. The edge components need to access
5GC network for the retrieval of network capability information. In order to
enable the same the edge related NRM need to contain the appropriate
information related to PCF, NEF and SCEF. Generic provisioning MnS can be used
to do required configurations.
## 9.2 Recommendations
It is recommended to start the normative work covering the following:
\- Specifying enhancements of provisioning MnS needed to support the
asynchronous mode of operations for LCM.
\- Specifying enhancements to 3GPP NRMs supporting:
\- Lifecycle management of EAS, EES, ECS and EASDF.
\- EAS profile configurations
\- EAS, EES and ECS access to 5GC functionality
\- Performance Assurance: Specifying appropriate performance measurements and
KPIs for EAS, EES, ECS and EASDF in TS 28.552 [11] and TS 28.554 [14]. This
will also include enabling a consumer, such as ECSP, to collect 5GC NF
performance measurements that may impact EAS performance.
\- Fault supervision: Enabling a consumer, such as ECSP, to receive 5GC NF
alarms that may impact EAS performance.
\- Specifying workflows for EAS, EES, ECS and EASDF related to edge computing
management.
###### ### Annex A: Deployment model
Several entities are involved in an edge computing ecosystem including ASP
(Application Service Provider), ECSP (Edge Computing Service Provider), PLMN
Operator etc. The application service provider consumes the edge services
(e.g., infrastructure, platform) provided by the edge computing service
provider (ECSP). As per the architecture defined in TS 23.558 [2] there can be
multiple deployment variations. While some of the deployment model are very
well in-scope of this document, some falls out of the scope. The following
figures captures various deployment model pertaining to EAS, EES and ECS
management.
{width="5.775in" height="3.6166666666666667in"}
In the above figure \"Provided by\" imply that the functionality is created by
a particular entity. Whereas, \"Managed by\" imply that the LCM, PA and FS of
the functionality is done by a particular entity.
