# Foreword
This Technical Specification has been produced by the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project (3GPP).
The contents of the present document are subject to continuing work within the
TSG and may change following formal TSG approval. Should the TSG modify the
contents of the present document, it will be re-released by the TSG with an
identifying change of release date and an increase in version number as
follows:
Version x.y.z
where:
x the first digit:
1 presented to TSG for information;
2 presented to TSG for approval;
3 or greater indicates TSG approved document under change control.
y the second digit is incremented for all changes of substance, i.e. technical
enhancements, corrections, updates, etc.
z the third digit is incremented when editorial only changes have been
incorporated in the document.
In the present document, modal verbs have the following meanings:
**shall** indicates a mandatory requirement to do something
**shall not** indicates an interdiction (prohibition) to do something
The constructions \"shall\" and \"shall not\" are confined to the context of
normative provisions, and do not appear in Technical Reports.
The constructions \"must\" and \"must not\" are not used as substitutes for
\"shall\" and \"shall not\". Their use is avoided insofar as possible, and
they are not used in a normative context except in a direct citation from an
external, referenced, non-3GPP document, or so as to maintain continuity of
style when extending or modifying the provisions of such a referenced
document.
**should** indicates a recommendation to do something
**should not** indicates a recommendation not to do something
**may** indicates permission to do something
**need not** indicates permission not to do something
The construction \"may not\" is ambiguous and is not used in normative
elements. The unambiguous constructions \"might not\" or \"shall not\" are
used instead, depending upon the meaning intended.
**can** indicates that something is possible
**cannot** indicates that something is impossible
The constructions \"can\" and \"cannot\" are not substitutes for \"may\" and
\"need not\".
**will** indicates that something is certain or expected to happen as a result
of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of
the present document
**will not** indicates that something is certain or expected not to happen as
a result of action taken by an agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
**might** indicates a likelihood that something will happen as a result of
action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the scope of the
present document
**might not** indicates a likelihood that something will not happen as a
result of action taken by some agency the behaviour of which is outside the
scope of the present document
In addition:
**is** (or any other verb in the indicative mood) indicates a statement of
fact
**is not** (or any other negative verb in the indicative mood) indicates a
statement of fact
The constructions \"is\" and \"is not\" do not indicate requirements.
# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3rd Generation
Partnership Project; Technical Specification Group Services and System
Aspects; Telecommunication management, as identified below:
TS 28.307: Management of Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection
Integration Reference Point (IRP); Requirements

TS 28.309: Management of Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection
Integration Reference Point (IRP); Solution Set (SS) definitions
One main motivation of mobile network evolution is to improve the user
experience why the evaluation at the UE side is vital to network operators,
especially when the operators provide some real-time services which require
for example high date rate and low latency like streaming services (typically
video services).
Quality of Experience (QoE) information collection provides detailed
information at session level on a number of UEs.
The operator can initiate logging of QoE information of an end user service.
The collected information (specified in Reference 3GPP TS 26.247 [4]) cannot
be deduced from performance measurements in the mobile network.
The QoE information is information collected by the end user application in
the UE.
The collected QoE information is collected by the management system (e.g. an
Operations System (OS) in TMN terminology) for analysis and/or KPI
calculations.
# 1 Scope
The present document addresses the operations and notifications for the
function Quality of Experience (QoE) measurement collection in UMTS and LTE.
The measurements that are collected are DASH [4] and MTSI [9] measurements.
The function includes collecting QoE information from UEs frequenting a
specified area.

## 5.3 Class definitions
### 5.3.1 QMCJob
#### 5.3.1.1 Definition
It represents a task that controls the QMC and collects data from the
applications in the UE (i.e. collects the QMCReportContainer of multiple
ManagedEntity instances). The QoEReference is a unique ID, which identifies
the network request session that has been created by the QMCJob and activated
to one or multiple ManagedEntity instance(s).
When a QMCJob is created, none of attributes be modified via the Itf-N:
\- If for any reason the QMCIRP determines that a QMC session has been
activated in its ManagedEntity(ies) the QMCIRP shall emit the
\"noitfyQMCSessionLocalActivation\" notification to the subscribed IRPManagers
to inform the active QMC Sessions. The IRPManagers can decide whether they
deactivate the QMC session or keep the QMC session active. (E.g. if the
QoEReference is colliding with an existing QMCJob\'s QoEReference, the
IRPManager may decide to immediately deactivate the QMC session in that
ManagedEntity.)
The QMCJob shall use its information to activate and configure QMC session(s)
in the requested ManagedEntity instance(s). When the QMCIRP determines that
there are available QMCReport files, it shall emit a notification to all
subscribed IRPManagers informing the availability of the files. The method and
the notification of the available files is described in the File Transfer IRP
(TS 32.342 [7]).
\- If a QMCJob receives an indication from one of its ManagedEntity that
starting a network request session is failed for any reason, the
\"notifyNetworkRequestSessionFailure\" notification may be emitted to inform
all subscribed IRPManagers that there was a network request session that was
not started in the ManagedEntity.

# 6 Interface Definition
## 6.1 Class diagram representing interfaces
Each interface is defined in one or more UML compliant class diagrams (see
also TS 32.156 [13]).
## 6.2 Generic rules
Rule 1: each operation with at least one input parameter supports a pre-
condition valid_input_parameter which indicates that all input parameters
shall be valid with regards to their information type. Additionally, each such
operation supports an exception operation_failed_invalid_input_parameter which
is raised when pre-condition valid_input_parameter is false. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
Rule 2: Each operation with at least one optional input parameter supports a
set of pre-conditions supported_optional_input_parameter_yyy where \"yyy\" is
the name of the optional input parameter and the\ pre-condition indicates that
the operation supports the named optional input parameter. Additionally, each
such operation supports an exception
operation_failed_unsupported_optional_input_parameter_yyy which is raised when
(a) the pre-condition supported_optional_input_parameter_yyy is false and (b)
the named optional input parameter is carrying information. The exception has
the same entry and exit state.
Rule 3: each operation shall support a generic exception
operation_failed_internal_problem which is raised when an internal problem
occurs and that the operation cannot be completed. The exception has the same
entry and exit state.
NOTE: These rules are mapped at the solution set level. Pre-conditions and
exceptions, generated by these rules, need not appear explicitly in the
present document.
## 6.3 QoEIRPManagement Interface (M)
### 6.3.1 Operation activateAreaQMCJob (M)
#### 6.3.1.1 Definition
This operation support IRPManager\'s request to create an AreaQMCJob through
Itf-N.
Once the AreaQMCJob has been created, the attributes of the QMCJob will not be
modified during the lifetime of the QMCJob.
One QMCJob can manage network request sessions in one or more ManagedEntity.
