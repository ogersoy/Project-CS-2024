# 1 Scope
This document specifies the performance measurements for 5G networks including
network slicing. Performance measurements for NG-RAN are defined in this
document (clause 5.1), and some L2 measurement definitions are inherited from
TS 38.314 [29]. The performance measurements for 5GC are all defined in this
document (clause 5.2 to 5.6). Related KPIs are defined to those measurements
are defined in TS 28.554 [8].
The performance measurements for NG-RAN applies also to NR option 3 in many
cases, but not to the RRC connection related measurements which are handled by
E-UTRAN for NR option 3 (those are measured according to TS 32.425 [9] and
related KPIs in TS 32.451 [10]).
The performance measurements are defined based on the measurement template as
described in TS 32.404 [3].

# 4 Concepts and overview
## 4.1 Performance indicators
Performance indicators are the performance data aggregated over a group of
NFs, such as, for example, average latency along the network slice. The
Performance Indicators can be derived from the performance measurements
collected at the NFs that belong to the group. The aggregation method is
identified in the performance indicator definition
Performance indicators at the network slice subnet level can be derived from
the performance measurements _collected at the NFs that belong to the network
slice subnets or to the constituent network slice subnets. The_ performance
indicators at the _network slice subnet_ level _can be made available via the
corresponding performance management service for network slice subnet._
The performance indicators at the network slice level, can be derived from the
_network slice subnet level Performance Indicators collected at the
constituent network slice subnets and/or NFs. The_ network slice _level
performance indicators can be made available via the corresponding performance
management service for_ network slice _._
When providing a communication service to a tenant, the performance indicators
can be derived from corresponding performance indicators related to network
slice, _network slice subnet_ and NFs and they can be made available via the
corresponding performance management service, consumed by a tenant. Tenant(s)
may be associated with S-NSSAI or sNSSAIList in which case, the performance
indicators are split into subcounters per S-NSSAI for individual tenant.
## 4.2 Filters and filter naming
### 4.2.0 General
In case a performance measurement is defined for more than one sub-counter, it
is convenient to use _Filter_ to define the performance measurement of
interest.
### 4.2.1 Filters
Performance measurements may be sub-divided by use of applicable filters to
form new Performance measurements (or sub counters). Any applicable
_Filter(s)_ are identified in each performance measurements definition.
Performance measurements may also be defined without any applied _Filter_.
When no _Filter_ is applied the performance measurement should exclude the
_Filter_ extension.
Example of possible _Filter_ values:
\- 5QI
\- QCI
\- SNSSAI, where SNSSAI represents the S-NSSAI
\- PLMN, where PLMN represents the PLMN ID
### 4.2.2 Filter naming
For the Performance measurements that indicate _Filters_ , the resulting
Performance measurement name will take the form: Performance
measurement__Filter_
If combination of _Filters_ is used the name will take the form: Performance
measurement__Filter1_Filter2_
If no _Filter_ is used the name will take the form: Performance measurement
Example: DRB.PdcpF1DelayDl__Filter,_ Where _Filter_ is a combination of _PLMN_
and _5QI_ and _SNSSAI_.
\- Single _Filter_ value applied: DRB.PdcpF1DelayDl__Filter1_ , where _Filter_
could be any of the possible _Filter_ value defined for the performance
measurement:
\- Sub counter name: DRB.PdcpF1DelayDl._5QI_
\- Multiple (two) _Filter_ values applied: DRB.PdcpF1DelayDl__Filter1_Filter2_
, where _Filter1_ and _Filter2_ could be any of the possible _Filter_ value
defined for the performance measurement:
\- Sub counter name: DRB.PdcpF1DelayDl._PLMN.5QI._
\- No _Filter_ value applied: Counter name: DRB.PdcpF1DelayDl
For _Filters_ the separator \'_\' is used to append the filter name(s) to the
measurement name. For multiple _Filters_ the order in the resulting name is
not important.
# 5 Performance measurements for 5G network functions
## 5.1 Performance measurements for gNB
### 5.1.0 Relation to RAN L2 measurement specification
When it comes to Layer 2 measurement definitions, some of the L2 measurement
definitions used in the present document are referring to TS 38.314 [29]. The
L2 measurement definitions in TS 38.314 [29] and in the present document have
some differences:
\- The measurement definitions in TS 38.314 [29] are often defined to be
reported \'per UE or per DRB\', to support MDT and Trace use cases.
\- The measurements defined in the present document define L2 measurements
that is aggregated and often reported per a Managed Object class (e.g.
NRCellDU).
Thus, for those L2 measurements, the definition in TS 38.314 [29] is re-used
in the present document, but without requirement of \'per UE or per DRB\'
reporting to be performed.

###### ## Annex A (informative): Use cases for performance measurements
# A.1 Monitoring of UL and DL user plane latency in NG-RAN
Satisfying low latency expectations for 5G services, such as URLLC, is one of
the key tasks for the operator to meet service performance expectations. As
the performance in UL and DL differs, it is important for operators to be able
to monitor the UL and DL user plane latencies separately. With performance
measurements allowing the operator to obtain or derive the UL and DL user
plane latency information separately, the operators can pinpoint the services
performance problems to specific problems in UL or DL.
The DL IP latency monitoring in NG-RAN refers to the transmission within gNB
of IP packets arriving when there is no other prior data to be transmitted to
the same UE in the gNB.
The average DL latency needs to be measured to give an general indication of
the latency performance; further more the latency distributions (into bins
with latency ranges) need to be measured, to tell the occurrences about the
packets with each certain range of latency and better reflect the user
experience.
Different network slices may have different requirements on the delay, so the
delay needs to be measured for each S-NSSAI.
To further pinpoint performance problem detected, separate counters may be
provided per mapped 5QI (which are particularly useful when the mapped 5QI is
used by few services and users and the packet size does not vary much).
# A.2 Monitoring of UL and DL packet loss in NG-RAN
Keeping track of UL and DL packet loss in the NG-RAN is essential, since for
certain services packets that are lost along the way through the system may
have a noticeable impact on the end user. UL and DL packet loss measurements
can be useful for evaluation, optimization and for performance assurance
within the integrity area (user plane connection quality). Subcounters per QoS
Level as well as per supported S-NSSAI is helpful for operator to pinpoint the
reason for high packet loss rate.
UL packet loss is a measure of packets dropped in the UE and the packets lost
on the interfaces (air interface and F1-U interface). If parts of the gNB are
deployed in a virtualized environment, it is important to measure also the
F1-U UL interface packet loss in a separate measurement, to be able to
pinpoint the reason for high packet loss.
# A.3 Monitoring of DL packet drop in NG-RAN
Keeping track of DL packet drops in the NG-RAN is essential, since for certain
services packets that are dropped along the way through the system may have a
noticeable impact on the end user. DL packet drop measurements can be useful
for evaluation, optimization and for performance assurance of the network.
Subcounters per QoS Level as well as per supported S-NSSAI is helpful for
operator to pinpoint the reason for high packet drop rate.
For gNBs that are deployed in a split architecture, e.g. when parts of a gNB
are deployed in a virtualized environment, the DL packet drops may occur in
two parts; the gNB CU-UP and the gNB DU. Therefore, it is important to measure
this separately.
# A.4 Monitoring of UL and DL user plane delay in NG-RAN
Satisfying low packet delay is of prime concern for some services,
particularly conversational services like speech and instant messaging. As the
performance in UL and DL differs, it is important for operators to be able to
monitor the UL and DL user plane delay separately. With performance
measurements allowing the operator to obtain or derive the UL and DL user
plane delay information separately, the operators can pinpoint the services
performance problems to specific problems in UL or DL.
The DL delay monitoring in gNB refers to the delay of any packet within NG-
RAN, including air interface delay until the UE receives the packet. A gNB
deployed in a split architecture, the user plane delay will occur in gNB-CU-
UP, on the F1 interface, in gNB-DU and on the air interface. Therefore, the
delay measurements related to the four segments needs to be monitored for the
DL delay to pinpoint where end user impact from packet delay occurs.
The average DL delay needs to be measured to give a general indication of the
delay performance; further more the delay distributions (into bins with delay
ranges) need to be measured, to tell the occurrences about the packets with
each certain range of delay and better reflect the user experience.
The UL delay monitoring in gNB refers to the delay of any packet within NG-
RAN, including air interface delay until the packet leaves gNB-CU-UP. There
are 4 components associated to UL delay (UL over-the-air interface delay, gNB-
DU delay, F1-U delay, CU-UP delay). Therefore, the delay measurements related
to these four segments needs to be monitored for the UL delay to pinpoint
where end user impact from packet delay occurs. The beamforming capabilities
of the NRCellDU and of the UE can be different. This might create a difference
in the successful reception probability of the DL data transmitted by the gNB-
DU, versus the UL data transmitted by the UE as the later might involve more
retransmission than the former one. This will increase the UL over-the-air
delay compared to the DL over-the-air delay.
For multi-operator RAN sharing scenario, different operators may have
different requirements on the packet delay. It is of great importance to
enable each operator to monitor the packet delay within its PLMN, also it
helps the operators to pinpoint the network and service performance problems
in a specific PLMN.
Different network slices may have different requirements on the delay, so the
delay needs to be measured for each S-NSSAI.
To further pinpoint a detected delay performance problem, the packet delay
measurement separation may be based on mapped 5QI (or for QCI in case of NR
option 3).
NOTE: It is an asumtion that the DL/UL delay on the F1 interface is equal,
only DL measurement is defined.
# A.5 Monitoring of UE Context Release Request (gNB-DU initiated)
In order to monitor the stability of the network and detect the
service/connection interruption caused by NGRAN, monitoring the UE Context
Release Request initiated by gNB-DU is an effective method. Collecting the
measurements for these events and analysing the releasing cause conveyed in
the message, operators could detect the stability of NG-RAN, and could decide
a specific means to improve the NG-RAN performance. Moreover, measuring the UE
Context Releases on the SSB beam from where the UE CONTEXT is released is
useful for analyzing the coverage problem.
# A.6 Monitoring of physical radio resource utilization
The physical radio resource utilization measurements could provide operators
the load information of the radio network during the measurement time period.
The physical radio resource utilization measurements should reflect the
average usage and the usage distribution of the radio resource of the physical
layer. The measurements can make the operator to be aware of whether a cell
has ever experienced high load or not in the monitoring period, and is a key
input to network capacity planning and load balancing.
Network slicing is an important feature in 5GS, monitoring physical radio
resource utilization per S-NSSAI is helpful for opeators to be aware of the
load.
# A.7 Monitoring of RRC connection number
The number of the users in RRC connected and inactive mode need to be
monitored as it reflects the load of the radio network, the operators can use
this information for dynamic frequency resource allocation or load balance
purpose. Moreover, it is an important factor to be evaluated in the radio
network capacity enhancement decision-making.
# A.8 Monitoring of UE Context Release (gNB-CU initiated)
In order to monitor the stability of the network and detect the
service/connection interruption caused by NG-RAN, monitoring the UE Context
Release Command initiated by gNB-CU is an effective method. Collecting the
measurements for these events and analysing the releasing cause conveyed in
the message, operators could detect the stability of NG-RAN, and could decide
a specific means to improve the NG-RAN performance. Moreover, measuring the UE
Context Releases on the SSB beam from where the UE CONTEXT is released is
useful for analyzing the coverage problem.
# A.9 Monitoring of UE Throughput in NG-RAN
Keeping track of UL and DL UE throughput in the NG-RAN is essential, to ensure
end user satisfaction and well-functioning and well configured cells and
scheduling features.
The restricted UE throughput per mapped 5QI will show the scheduling
efficiency and QoS priority handling in the gNB and the ratio between
unrestricted and restricted volume will show the gNB ability to handle small
data transfers efficiently.
To be able to monitor the spread of throughput within the cell, and estimate
the ratio of satisfied users, the throughput distribution measurement can be
used.
When network slicing is supported by the NG-RAN, multiple s S-NSSAIs may be
supported. The UL and DL UE throughput for each S-NSSAI is then of importance
to the operator to pinpoint a specific performance problem.
For RAN sharing scenarios, the UL and DL UE throughput in each PLMN is of
importance to pinpoint performance problem in a specific PLMN.
# A.10 Monitoring of Unrestricted volume in NG-RAN
Measuring the share of unrestricted user data volume in the NG-RAN is
important, to show the gNB ability to handle small data transfers efficiently
and to see how large share of the volume that is part of the UE throughput
measurement. It is not meaningful to measure throughput for data transfers so
small that they fit in one single slot but it is still important to know how
much such transfers can be handled by the gNB.
When network slicing is supported by the NG-RAN, multiple s S-NSSAIs may be
supported. The share of unrestricted volume for each S-NSSAI is then of
importance to the operator to pinpoint a specific performance problem.
# A.11 N3 data volume related measurements
N3 related measurements are used to measure data volume on N3 interface
including incoming and outgoing of GTP data packets in total and per QoS level
without counting the mandatory part of the GTP-U header
It is useful to analyse transport bandwidth usage of N3 interface in total and
QoS level granularity. If the transport bandwidth usage is too high, more
bandwidth should be deployed, or load balance should be considered according
to core network dimension if there are multiple UPFs connected to multiple
gNodeBs. Decision on the additional bandwidth provisioning or load balancing
can be made in more fine grained level due to the QoS level measurement.
So it is necessary to define N3 related measurements.
# A.12 N6 related measurements
N6 related measurements are used to measure data volume on N6 interface
including incoming and outgoing of IP data packets.
It is useful to analyse transport bandwidth usage of N6 interface. If the
transport bandwidth usage is too high, more bandwidth should be deployed.
So it is necessary to define N6 related measurements.
# A.13 Registration related measurements
A UE needs to register with the 5GS to get authorization to receive services,
to enable mobility tracking and to enable reachability. The following
registration types are defined:
\- Initial Registration to the 5GS;
\- Mobility Registration Update (upon changing to a new Tracking Area (TA)
outside the UE\'s Registration Area in both CM-CONNECTED and CM-IDLE state, or
when the UE needs to update its capabilities or protocol parameters that are
negotiated in Registration procedure with or without changing to a new TA);
\- Periodic Registration Update (due to a predefined time period of
inactivity); and
\- Emergency Registration (i.e. the UE is in limited service state).
The registration may be via 3GPP access, or via untrusted or trusted non-3GPP
access.
The performance of registration for each registration type needs to be
monitored by the operator since it is relevant to whether the end user can use
the service of 5GS or a specific network slice. The performance of
registration via 3GPP access and non-3GPP access (including untrusted and
trusted non-3GPP access) needs to be monitored respectively.
# A.14 PDU session establishment related measurements
The PDU session establishment is one of essential procedures for 5G network.
The performance of PDU session establishment directly impacts the QoS of the
network and the QoE of the end users. Therefore, the performance measurements
are needed to reflect the performance of the PDU session establishment.
The PDU sessions are created in two scerarios; Non-roaming/LBO-roaming and HR-
roaming, and are created by (V-)SMF and H-SMF respectively.
On receipt by the (V-)SMF from AMF of Nsmf_PDUSession_CreateSMContex Request,
the PDU session is created in non-roaming/LBO-roaming scenario and HR-roaming
scenario.
On receipt by the H-SMF from V-SMF of Nsmf_PDUSession_Create Request, the PDU
session is created in HR-roaming scenario.
The number and success rate of PDU session creations, the number of PDU
sessions running on the SMF are some of the basic performance measurements to
monitor the performance of the PDU session establishment. And the performance
measurements of failed PDU session creations are helpful to solve the network
issues in case the performance is below the expectation.
# A.15 Policy association related measurements
To ensure the UE properly use the services provided by 5GS, the UE needs to be
associated with a set of policies. The policies are categorized into AM
policy, SM policy and UE policy and these kinds of policies are provisioned by
PCF.
The AM policy association needs to be established in case the UE initially
registers to the network or the UE needs the AMF re-allocation. The AM policy
association needs to be updated when the policy control request trigger is met
or the AMF is relocated due to the UE mobility and the old PCF is selected
(see clause 4.2 in TS 29.507[39]).
The SM policy association needs to be established when the UE requests a PDU
Session Establishment. The SM policy association needs to be updated when
Policy Control Request Trigger condition is met (see clause 4.2 in TS
29.512[40]).
The UE policy association needs to be established in the following scenarios:
1\. UE initial registration with the network when a UE Policy Container is
received.
2\. The AMF relocation with PCF change in handover procedure and registration
procedure.
3\. UE registration with 5GS when the UE moves from EPS to 5GS and there is no
existing UE Policy Association between AMF and PCF for this UE.
The policy association establishment is the essential steps allowing the UE to
be served by the 5GS under the designed policies, therefore it needs to be
monitored.
# A.16 Monitoring of PDU session resource setup in NG-RAN
The PDU Session Resource Setup procedure in NG-RAN is to assign resources on
Uu and NG-U for one or several PDU session resources and the corresponding QoS
flows, and to setup corresponding Data Radio Bearers for a given UE.
The PDU Session Resource Setup is one of the most key procedure to allocate
resources in the NG-RAN to the UE per the QoS requirements for the NSSAI(s).
Whether or not the PDU Session Resource is successfully setup for the NSSAI(s)
has direct impact to the user experience. The failed PDU Session Resource
Setup may directly cause the service failure for an end user. So, the
performance related to the PDU Session Resource Setup for the gNB needs to be
monitored.
# A.17 Monitoring of handovers
Mobility is one of the most significant feature of the mobile networks, and
handover is one typical action of the mobility. The handover failure would
cause service discontinuation, thus the performance of the handover has direct
impact to the user experience.The handover procedure includes handover
preparation, handover resource allocation and handover execution, and the
performance related to handover needs to be monitored for each phase. The
resources (e.g., PDU Session Resource) need to be prepared and allocated for a
handover according to the QoS requirements for each S-NSSAI.
The handover could occur intra-gNB and inter-gNB for 5G networks, and for
inter-gNB case the handover could happen via NG or Xn interface. The handover
could occur Intra-frequency and Inter-frequency for 5G networks. The handover
could also occur between 5GS and EPS.
It is also important to have information about the used beams in the source
and target cells in order to optimize the handover performance taking beam ids
into account.
For the handover failures, the measurements with specific causes are required
for trouble shooting.
The handover parameters setting could be specific for each NCR, and the
handover performance could vary significantly for different NCRs, therefore
the performance needs to be measured per NCR to support handover parameters
optimization when necessary.
# A.18 Monitor of BLER performance
The TB Error Rate in UL/DL can directly reflect the BLER, and has an influence
on MCS selection and user throughput. It can be helpful to estimate the
performance of radio resource management like radio resource schedulein
transport layer and be helpful in trouble shooting. Furthermore, they should
be taken into account to optimize the system performance. To obtain TB Error
Rate by calculating, the number of total and error TBs transmitted in a cell
should be monitored.
# A.19 Monitor of ARQ and HARQ performance
Reliable Packet Delivery is one of the important Performance factor for a
better User experience. HARQ re-transmissions at the MAC layer ensure reliable
packet delivery
In addition, RLC can be configured to operate in acknowledged mode for those
applications that need very low packet drops and can tolerate a slightly
higher delay from RLC re-transmissions.
If a MAC PDU is not delivered, HARQ takes care of re-transmitting (up to a
maximum configurable number). If all the re-transmissions fail at MAC layer,
and if RLC is configured to operate in acknowledged mode, RLC\'s ARQ mechanism
will take care of any residual packet errors.
It is important to:
a) Maintain the block error rate or packet error rate within tolerable limits.
b) Ensure that HARQ re-transmissions take care of most packet errors, instead
of relying on RLC layer re-transmissions (which would increase the delay).
So, it is important to monitor the performance of these schemes.
HARQ Performance if viewed at MCS (Modulation Coded Scheme) can help in
monitoring the MCS Performance also.
# A.20 Monitoring of PDU session modifications
The PDU session may need to be modified by various causes (see TS 29.502
[14]), whether a PDU session can be successful modified may impact the
communication services supported by the PDU session. Therefore the performance
of PDU session modification procedures need to be monitored. Besides PDU
session modification requests and successes, the PDU session modification
failures with specific causes need to be monitored for trouble shooting.
# A.21 Monitoring of PDU session releases
The PDU session release may be released by the UE, SMF or AMF. When a PDU
session is released by an unexpected reason, the user service would be
impacted. The PDU session releases initiated by the UE and SMF are usually
triggered by normal reason (e.g., UE deregistration, under request from DN,
etc.). The PDU session releases initiated by AMF may be due to an abnormal
reason (e.g., mismatch of PDU Session status between UE and AMF). Therefore
the PDU session releases initiated by AMF need to be monitored.
# A.22 Monitoring of N4 session management
UPF handles the user plane path of PDU Sessions. UPF selection is performed by
SMF, and deployments where a UPF is controlled either by a single SMF or
multiple SMFs (for different PDU Sessions) are supported.
The SMF uses N4 session management procedures to control the traffic
detection, traffic reporting, QoS enforcement and traffic routing of the UPF.
The N4 session management procedures include N4 Session Establishment
procedure, N4 session Modification procedure and N4 session release procedure.
If PDF fails to handle the user plane path for a PDU session, the user service
will be impacted. So the performance about N4 session management needs to be
monitored.
# A.23 Use case of VR measurements for NF
In case the NF is virtualized, the performance of an NF may be impacted by the
underlying VRs (i.e., virtual CPUs, virtual memories, virtual storages, and
connection data volumes). To enable the operator to analyze the impact of the
VRs to the performance of the NF, the performance of the virtual compute,
virtual memory and virtual disk also needs to be monitored. The usage is the
key measurement for the performance of the VR, it can tell whether the VR is
overloaded and whether the VR is efficiently utilized. By correlating the VR
related measurements with the performance measurement of the NF, the operator
can know whether the NF performance issue is caused by the VRs or not. When
necessary, the operator may take appropriate action to solve the performance
issue of the NF, for example, to scale in/out the VNF instance(s) that
realizes the NF, or switch on/off the auto-scaling for the VNF instance(s).
# A.24 Monitoring of DRB Setup in NG-RAN
The DRB setup procedure in NG-RAN is to assign resources in gNB and on the air
interface (Uu) for one or several DRBs that will handle the QoS flows
requested to setup by the core network. The gNB may map several QoS flows to
the same DRB so there is no one-to-one mapping between the flows and DRBs.
At DRB setup, the gNB will handle all QoS flows mapped to one DRB the same
(mapped 5QI). A QoS flow that is at a later stage mapped to an already setup
existing DRB will not increment the DRB setup counters.
The DRB setup is one of the most key procedures to allocate resources in the
NG-RAN to the UE per the QoS requirements. Whether or not the DRB is
successfully setup has direct impact to the user experience. A failed DRB
setup may directly cause service failure or degradation for an end user. So,
the performance related to the DRB setup for the gNB needs to be monitored per
supported mapped 5QI and per S-NSSAI.
# A.25 Monitoring of PDCP data volume measurements
In 5GS, Cell PDCP data volume is a useful measurement which represents the
real data traffic for each cell. The monitor of the Cell PDCP data volume
could provide operators the traffic information and is useful for operators to
do cell load evaluation, load balancing and cell capacity planning.
In addition, in scenarios of dual connectivity, for split bearers, PDCP data
is transferred between the MN and the SN via the MN-SN user plane interface.
To monitor the real PDCP data volume transmitted in MN and SN in MR-DC
scenarios, the data volume transferred between MN and SN should be counted.
# A.26 Monitoring of RF performance
RF Performance includes performance of Power Resource Utilization, RF signal,
TA, interference and etc. Monitoring of the performance measurements can help
to reflect the cell loading information and abnormal conditions.
Monitoring of the quality of RF signal in the cell is useful for the purpose
of network planning and overall service quality assessment. Measurements of
Channel Quality Indicator (CQI) reported by UEs is a useful metric reflecting
RF signal quality and service quality.
# A.27 Monitoring of RF measurements
MCS represents the modulation and coding schemes scheduled for the physical
resources by NG-RAN. The measurements of MCS distribution is a useful metric
reflecting the efficiency for PDSCH and PUSCH RBs. It is helpful for operator
to optimize the scheduling of physical resources to improve the network
efficiency and overall service quality.
The MCS scheduling strategies of MU-MIMO and SU-MIMO are different due to
factors such as user pairing and interference. So it is necessary to
distinguish statistics and measurements of MCS distribution for MU-MIMO and
SU-MIMO.
# A.28 Monitor of QoS flow release
QoS flow is the key and limited resource for 5G RAN (including NG-RAN and
non-3GPP access) to deliver services. The release of the QoS flow needs to be
monitored as:
\- an abnormal release of the QoS flow will cause the call(/session) drop,
which directly impacts the QoS delivered by the networks, and the satisfaction
degree of the end user;
\- a successfully released QoS flow can be used to setup other requested
calls(/sessions). The QoS flow failed to be released will still occupy the
limited resource and hence it can not be used to admit other requested
calls(/sessions).
From a retainability measurement aspect, QoS flows do not need to be released
because they are inactive, they can be kept to give fast access when new data
arrives.
To define (from a QoS flow release measurement point of view) if a QoS flow is
considered active or not, the QoS flow can be divided into two groups:
For QoS flows with bursty flow, a UE is said to be \"in session\" if there is
user data in the PDCP queue in any of the directions or if any QoS flow data
on a Data Radio Bearer (UL or DL) has been transferred during the last 100
ms.\ For QoS flows with continuous flow, the QoS flow (and the UE) is seen as
being \"in session\" in the context of this measurement as long as the UE is
in RRC connected state, and the session time is increased from the first data
transmission on the QoS flow until 100 ms after the last data transmission on
the QoS flow.
A particular QoS flow is defined to be of type continuous flow if the 5QI is
any of {1, 2, 65, 66}.
The specific reason causing the abnormal and failed release of the QoS flow is
required in order to find out the problem and ascertain the solutions. And due
to different priority and tolerance for different service type with different
QoS level in the networks, the monitor needs to be opened on each service type
with QoS level.
The QoS flow can be released by PDU Session Resource Release procedure, UE
Context Release procedure, Reset procedure either initiated by 5G RAN
(including NG-RAN and non-3GPP access) or AMF and NG Path Switch procedure
(see TS 38.413 [11]).
So performance measurements related to QoS flow Release (see TS 38.413 [11])
and UE Context Release (see TS 38.413 [11]) procedure for each service type
with QoS level are necessary to support the monitor of QoS flow release.
The abnormal release of the QoS flow has potential scenario where, regardless
of receiving the UE Context Release Command with the cause related to abnormal
release, the end user does not perceive it as abnormal. This scenario is
explicitly related to 5QI 1 calls, for other services it is not possible to
determine the reason behind the cause code. It is typical to encounter such
scenario, a so called \"double UE Context\", when Radio Link Failure occurs
during an ongoing 5QI 1 call and RRC Connection Re-establishment attempt fails
on target or other cell. If then the UE does a new RRC Connection the 5QI 1
QoS flow is set-up during Initial Context Setup in the target or other cell.
However, when AMF receives that service request with the Initial UE message
through the target or other cell, it realizes that it already has the same UE
Context but from the source cell (it has not been released yet). In such case,
AMF sends UE Context Release Command to the source cell. As the 5QI 1 QoS flow
has been successfully setup in the target or other cell, the 5QI 1 QoS flow
release in the source cell may not be perceived as a drop (abnormal release)
by the end user, as the service has been sustained with some interruption
time, and can\'t be considered as a drop in the 5QI 1 QoS flow Drop Ratio.
This interruption time may be monitored in order to evaluate how it can impact
the QoS of the 5QI 1 Flows due to double NG (double UE context)\". Moreover,
the 5QI 1 QoS Flows that can be immediately released due to radio reasons with
UE connectivity lost (when T-RLF timer was not started) may be delayed by time
interval based on this average interruption time to possibly transform them to
double NG scenario to keep the calls active and reduce further the 5QI 1 QoS
flow Drop Ratio.
From QoS perspective it is important to focus also on call duration as in some
cases wrong quality perceived by the end user is not fully reflected by drop
ratio nor retainability KPI. Typical case is when due to poor radio conditions
the end user redials (the call was terminated normally) to the same party to
secure the quality. But in this case the drop ratio KPI will not show any
degradation. Secondly, although the call is dropped the end user may or may
not redial depending on dropped call duration compared to the case when the
call would be normally released. It is therefore highly recommended to monitor
average and distribution of duration of normally and abnormally released
calls.
# A.29 Monitor of call (/session) setup performance
Call(/session) setup is one of most important step to start delivering
services by the networks to users.
The success or failure of a call(/session) setup directly impacts the quality
level for delivering the service by the networks, and also the feeling of the
end user. So the success or failure of call(/session) setup needs be
monitored, this can be achieved by the calculation of call setup success rate
which gives a direct view to evaluate the call setup performance, and the
analysis of the specific reason causing the failure to find out the problem
and ascertain the solutions.
In addition, the time duration of the call(/session) setup need to be
monitored as it impacts the end user experience, and by comparison with
operator\'s benchmark requirements, the optimization may be required according
the performance.
To support the monitor of success or failure of the call(/session) setup, the
performance measurements related toPDU Session Resource Setup/modify (See TS
38.413[11]) in NG-RAN or via trusted/untrusted non-3GPP access and Initial
Context Setup (See TS 38.413[11]) procedures for each QoS level and each
S-NSSAI are needed.
# A.30 Void
# A.31 Monitoring of QoS flows for SMF
To support a service for a UE, the QoS flow supporting the specific QoS needs
to be added or modified. If the QoS flow fails to be added or modified, the
user service cannot be conducted or the QoS cannot be met. So the QoS flow
addition and modification need to be monitored.
Furthermore, in order to know the UE traffic pattern at SMF, it is necessary
to monitor the peak and mean number of ongoing QoS flows for each granularity
period.
# A.32 Monitoring of service requests
The Service Request procedure is initiated via 3GPP access:
by the UE in CM‑IDLE state in order to send uplink signalling messages, user
data, or as a response to a network paging request; or
by the network when the network needs to signal (e.g. N1 signalling to UE,
Mobile-terminated SMS, User Plane connection activation for PDU Session(s) to
deliver mobile terminating user data) with a UE.
The Service Request procedure via non-3GPP Access (including untrusted and
trusted non-3GPP access) is used by a UE:
\- in CM-IDLE state over non-3GPP access to request the re-establishment of
the NAS signalling connection and the re-establishment of the user plane for
all or some of the PDU Sessions which are associated to non-3GPP access; and
\- in CM-CONNECTED state over non-3GPP access to request the re-establishment
of the user plane for one or more PDU Sessions which are associated to
non-3GPP access.
The Service Request procedures via 3GPP access and via untrusted/trusted
non-3GPP Access need to be monitored respectively in order to know the
performance of the 5G network in terms of providing services to the UEs.
# A.33 Monitoring of DL PDCP UE buffered throughput
To monitor DL PDCP buffered throughput per UE and bearer is essential, to
ensure end user satisfaction and well functioning and well configured cells.
If an end user often experiences low quality during use of a service, the end-
user might change wireless subscription provider, i.e. loss of income for the
network operator.
# A.34 Monitoring of RRC connection setup in NG-RAN
RRC connection setup is one of most important step to start delivering
services by the networks to users, (see TS 38.331 [20]).
Whether or not the RRC connection is successfully setup has direct impact to
the user experience. A failed RRC connection setup may cause service failure
or failure in updating tracking area information for an end user. So, the
performance related to the RRC connection setup for the gNB needs to be
monitored. This can be achieved by the calculation of RRC connection setup
success (or failure) rate (number of successful (or failed) / number of
attempt) which gives a direct view to evaluate the RRC connection setup
performance, and the analysis of the specific reason causing the failure to
find out the problem and ascertain the solutions.
Since the intended service is not yet know when establishing the RRC
connection, it is not possible to do separation between QoS classes or
S-NSSAIs.
# A.35 Monitoring of UE associated NG signalling connection setup in NG-RAN
The NG signalling connection setup procedure in NG-RAN is to establish
signalling connection between gNB and AMF for a given UE.
Whether or not the NG signalling connection is successfully setup has direct
impact on the user experience. A failed NG signalling connection setup may
directly cause service failure or failure in updating tracking area
information for an end user. So, the performance related to the NG signalling
connection setup for the gNB needs to be monitored. This can be achieved by
the calculation of success rate for UE associated NG signalling connection
(number of successful / number of attempted) which gives a direct view to
evaluate the setup performance.
Since the intended service is not yet know when establishing the UE associated
NG signalling connection, it is not possible to do separation between QoS
classes or S-NSSAI.
# A.36 Monitoring of PDCP data volume per interface
In 5GS, PDCP data volume is a useful measurement which represents the real
data traffic towards each GNBDUFunction (F1-U interface), each external gNB-
CU-UP (Xn-U interface) and each external eNB (X2-U interface). The monitoring
of the PDCP data volume could provide operators with traffic information and
is a useful measure in performance assurance within integrity area (user plane
connection quality) and in energy efficiency evaluation.
# A.37 Monitoring of RRC connection re-establishment
The failed RRC connection re-establishment will cause the call (/session)
drop, which directly impacts the QoS delivered by the networks.
# A.38 Monitoring of RRC connection resuming
RRC connection resuming is one of important step to start delivering services
by the networks to users or for RNA update.
The success or failure of a RRC connection resuming directly impacts the
quality level for delivering the service by the networks, and also the feeling
of the end user. So the success or failure of RRC connection resuming needs be
monitored, this can be achieved by the calculation of RRC connection resuming
success rate which gives a direct view to evaluate the resume performance, and
the analysis of the specific reason causing the failure to find out the
problem and ascertain the solutions.
# A.39 Monitoring of inter-AMF handovers
The handover could occur from a source NG-RAN to the target NG-RAN that are
served by different AMFs. During the handover, the PDU sessions and QoS flows
need to be setup in the target side. The failure of the PDU session setup or
QoS flow setup during the inter-AMF handover has direct impact to the user\'s
experience. Therefore, it is necessary to monitor the performance related to
PDU session setup or QoS flow setup for the Inter-AMF handover.
# A.40 Monitoring of incoming/outgoing GTP packet loss on N3
Keeping track of GTP data packet loss over N3 is essential, since for certain
services packets that are lost along the way through the system may have a
noticeable impact on the end user. Incoming/outgoing GTP data packet loss
measurements can be useful for evaluation, optimization, and performance
assurance between gNB and UPF in the core. It is also important for the
performance measurement of end-to-end point of view from UE to UPF.
Performance degradation can happen any point although the focus is centered
more at UE and RAN. When the monitoring incoming/outgoing GTP packet loss on
N3 requires specific measurements per GTP tunnel, the monitoring of
incoming/outgoing GTP packet loss on N3 can use subcounters per TEID to
provide the measurements within a GTP tunnel.
# A.41 Monitoring of round-trip GTP packet delay on N3
Keeping track of GTP data packet delay over N3 is essential, since for certain
services packet delay along the way through the system may have a noticeable
impact on the end user. Incoming/outgoing GTP data packet delay measurements
can be useful for evaluation, optimization, and performance assurance between
gNB and UPF in the core. It is also important for the performance measurement
of end-to-end point of view from UE to UPF. Performance degradation can happen
any point although the focus is centered more at UE and RAN.
# A.42 Monitoring of PDU session resource management for untrusted non-3GPP
access
The PDU Session Resource management procedure for Untrusted non-3GPP Access is
to manage resources in Untrusted non-3GPP Access for the PDU sessions.
The PDU Session Resource needs to be setup or modified via the Untrusted
non-3GPP Access for the UE per the QoS requirements for the NSSAI(s).
The PDU Session Resource setup and modification via the Untrusted non-3GPP
Access have direct impact to the user experience. So, the performance related
to the PDU Session Resource setup and modification via the Untrusted non-3GPP
Access needs to be monitored.
# A.43 Monitor of DRB release
DRB is the key and limited resource for NG-RAN to deliver services. Once a QoS
flow reaches a gNB it will trigger setup of a new DRB or it will be mapped to
an existing DRB. The decision on how to map QoS flows into new or existing
DRBs is taken at the CU-CP. CU-CP also defines one set of QoS parameters (one
5QI) for the DRB. If a QoS flow is mapped to an existing DRB, the packets
belonging to that QoS flow are not treated with the 5QI of the QoS flow, but
they are treated with the mapped 5QI of the DRB.
The release of the DRB needs to be monitored as:
\- an abnormal release of the DRB will cause the call(/session) drop, which
directly impacts the QoS and slice delivered by the network, and the
satisfaction degree of the end user;
\- a successfully released DRB can be used to setup other requested
calls(/sessions). The DRB failed to be released will still occupy the limited
resource and hence it can not be used to admit other requested
calls(/sessions).
From a retainability measurement aspect, DRBs do not need to be released
because they are inactive, they can be kept to give fast access when new data
arrives.
To define (from a DRB release measurement point of view) if a DRB is
considered active or not, the DRB can be divided into two groups:
  * For DRBs with bursty flow, a DRB is said to be active if there is user data in the PDCP queue in any of the directions or if any data (UL or DL) has been transferred during the last 100 ms.
  * For DRBs with continuous flow, the DRB is seen as being active in the context of this measurement as long as the UE is in RRC connected state, and the session time is increased from the first data transmission on the DRB until 100 ms after the last data transmission on the DRB.
A particular DRB is defined to be of type continuous flow if the mapped 5QI is
any of {1, 2, 65, 66}.
Due to different priority and tolerance for different service type with
different QoS level in the DRB, the measurement needs to be performed per
mapped 5QI, to be able to judge the result.
Similarly, the abnormal and failed DRB releases will affect different Service
Level Agreements in the networks. Therefore, each S-NSSAI needs to be
monitored.
The DRB can be released by PDU Session Resource Release procedure, UE Context
Release procedure, Reset procedure either initiated by NG-RAN or AMF and NG
Path Switch procedure (see TS 38.413 [11]).
Therefore, performance measurements related to DRB Release (see TS 38.413
[11]) and UE Context Release (see TS 38.413 [11]) procedure for each QoS level
(mapped 5QI) and each S-NSSAI are necessary to support the monitor of DRB
release.
# A.44 Monitoring of application triggering
When the AF needs to trigger the UE for some actions, the AF requests the NEF
to send an application trigger to the UE.
The application in the UE may perform actions as indicated by the Trigger
payload when the Triggered payload is received at the UE. For example
initiation of immediate or later communication with the application server
based on the information contained in the Trigger payload, which includes the
PDU Session Establishment procedure if the related PDU Session is not already
established.
Therefore, to ensure the application run normally, the network needs to
successfully deliver the application trigger to the UE.
# A.45 Monitoring of SMS over NAS
The SMS can be transferred over NAS in 5G networks. To enable SMS over NAS
transporting, the UE includes an \"SMS supported\" indication in Registration
Request indicating the UE\'s capability for SMS over NAS transport, and in the
Registration Accept the networks indicates to the UE whether the network
allows the SMS message delivery over NAS. If the SMS over NAS is allowed by
the network, the SMS messages can be originated or terminated by the UE, via
3GPP or non-3GPP access.
The performance of SMS over NAS, as a service provided to the end users, has
direct impact to user experience and user satisfaction, and thus needs to be
monitored. For this purpose, the measurements for the following aspects are
needed:
\- registration procedure for SMS over NAS to reflect whether the UEs are
allowed or disallowed to send or receive SMS messages over NAS;
\- the number of SMS messages requested to be sent or received over NAS and
the number of SMS messages successfully delivered over NAS, which can directly
reflect whether the services can be successfully delivered to the users.
# A.46 Monitoring of round-trip GTP packet delay on N9
When I-UPF exists, the delay over N9 interface for DL/UL data packets is
essential as part of the e2e packet delay, since for certain services packet
delay along the way through the system may have a noticeable impact on the end
user. RTT GTP data packet delay measurements for DL/UL data packets can be
useful for evaluation, optimization, and performance assurance for the N9
interface between PSA UPF and I-UPF. It is also important for the performance
measurement of end-to-end point of view from UE to PSA UPF. Performance
degradation can happen any point, so the RTT N9 delay needs to be measured at
PSA UPF and I-UPF respectively. The GTP packets are prioritized for
transmitting using DSCPs, so it is necessary to measure the round-trip GTP
packet delay per DSCP.
# A.47 Monitoring of GTP packets delay in UPF
The GTP packets may be delayed on the interfaces and in the NFs. For some
services (such as URLLC sevices), the end to end packet delay in the network
has clear impact to users\' experience. The GTP packets delay in the UPF, as
one segment of the end to end delay in the network, needs to be measured in
order to indicate where the performance degradation happens. The GTP packets
are prioritized for transmitting for different 5QIs and S-NSSAIs, so the
measurements per 5QI and S-NSSAI are needed.
# A.48 Monitoring of round-trip delay between PSA UPF and UE
The end to end delay in 5G networks between UE and PSA UPF has direct impact
to users\' experience for some types of services (e.g., URLLC). In case the
PSA UPF and NG-RAN are not time synchronised, the round-trip delay between PSA
UPF and UE can be measured at PSA UPF.
The measurements on the round-trip delay between PSA UPF and NE can be used to
evaluate the user plane delay performance in 5G networks and users\'
experience.
# A.49 Monitoring of Power, Energy and Environmental (PEE) parameters
Power, Energy and Environmental (PEE) parameters, combined with data volume
measurements, are valuable information for operators to measure the energy
efficiency of their 5G network. Hence it is necessary to define PEE parameters
related to 5G network such as power, energy, temperature, voltage, current and
humidity.
# A.50 Monitoring of UE configuration update
To ensure the UE properly use the services provided by 5GS, the UE needs to
update access and mobility management related parameters decided and provided
by the AMF.
The UE configuration update is the essential steps allowing the UE to be
served by the 5GS under the changed configuration, therefore it needs to be
monitored.
# A.51 Monitoring of subscriber\'s number for UDM
The number of subscribers including registered and unregistered subscribers
for UDM need to be monitored as it reflects the service load of the UDM, the
operators can use this information for resource allocation or load balance
purpose.
# A.52 Monitoring of QoS flow modification
The QoS flow may need to be modified to fulfil the updated QoS requirements
for the UE. The QoS modification success or failure has direct impact to the
users about the QoS that the network can provide. The performance measurements
related to QoS flow modification are needed to evaluate the performance that
whether or not the UE\'s updated QoS requirements are fulfilled by the
network, and to support finding the causes of the failures for
troubleshooting.
The QoS flows, within the PDU session, may be established in NG-RAN or
untrusted/trusted non-3GPP access, so separate performance measurements are
needed to monitor the QoS flow modifications respectively in NG-RAN and
untrusted or trusted non-3GPP access.
# A.53 Monitoring of handovers between 5GS and EPS
The handover could occur between 5GS and EPS with or without N26 interface.
The success or failure of the handover between 5GS and EPS directly impacts
the users\' experience, especially for the service of voice over IMS. When the
handover occurs via the N26 interface, the handover may succeed or fail on the
N26 interface. The performance of handover between 5GS and EPS needs to be
monitored, and for failure cases the measurements with specific causes are
needed for trouble shooting.
# A.54 Monitoring of NF service registration and update
The NRF maintains the information of available NF instances and their
supported services, and each NF instance informs the NRF of the list of NF
services that it supports.
The NF instance may make this information available to NRF when the NF
instance becomes operative for the first time (registration) or upon
individual NF service instance activation/de-activation within the NF instance
(update operation) e.g. triggered after a scaling operation. The NF instance
while registering the list of NF services it supports, for each NF service,
may provide a notification endpoint information for each type of notification
service that the NF service is prepared to consume, to the NRF during the NF
instance registration. The NF instance could also update or delete the NF
service related parameters (e.g. to delete the notification endpoint
information). Registration with the NRF includes capacity and configuration
information of the NF instances and at time of instantiation.
The failed NF service registration or update would result in that 1) the NF
service cannot be discovered or consumed by the consumer, and 2) the NF
service may not be able to receive the notifications for the other NF services
it needs to consume, such failures would impact many users who need to be
supported by the NF services. Therefore, the performance of the NF service
registration or update need to be monitored, especially for the failure cases
which need to trigger trouble shooting.
# A.55 Monitoring of NF service discovery
An NF service is one type of capability exposed by an NF (NF Service Producer)
to other authorized NF (NF Service Consumer) through a service-based
interface. A Network Function could expose one or more NF services.
The NF discovery and NF service discovery enable Core Network entities (NFs or
Service Communication Proxy (SCP)) to discover a set of NF instance(s) and NF
service instance(s) for a specific NF service or an NF type. Unless the
expected NF and NF service information is locally configured on the requester
NF, e.g. when the expected NF service or NF is in the same PLMN as the
requester NF, the NF and NF service discovery is implemented via the Network
Repository Function (NRF).
If the NF service instance(s) cannot be discovered by the NF consumer, the
network feature may not be fully supported thus the uses may suffer from
service failures. Therefore, the performance of the NF service discovery needs
to be monitored.
# A.56 Monitoring of PFD management
The Packet Flow Description (PFD) describes the packet flow for the UL/DL
application traffic by a tuple of protocol, server-side IP and port number.
Management of Packet Flow Descriptions (PFDs) refers to the capability to
create, update or delete PFDs in the NEF (PFDF) for the applications under the
request of AF, and the distribution from the NEF (PFDF) to the SMF and finally
to the UPF.
The 5G network needs to have the up-to-date PFDs in order to deliver the user
data to the destination for the applications, and the applications cannot be
fulfilled without PFDs or with wrong or obsolete PFDs. Therefore, the
performance of PFD management, including PFD creation, update, deletion, fetch
and subscription, needs to be monitored.
# A.57 Monitoring of incoming GTP packet out-of-order on N3 interface
If the sequence is out-of-order during the link transmission between gNB and
UPF, especially for the TCP-type service, fast retransmission and even the
exponential back-off process of the TCP occur, it will have a great impact on
the terminal service rate. Adding the out-of-order packet measurement metrics
on the N3 interface is helpful to better observe and evaluate the transmission
quality of the data link between the gNB and the UPF. It is of significance to
the high-rate and high-reliability services.
# A.58 Monitoring of PCI to detect PCI collision or confusion
Each NR cell is assigned a PCI that enables UE to uniquely identify the cell.
PCI values need to be reused, as there are only 1008 PCI values. Typically,
operators use network planning tool to assign PCIs to cells when the network
is deployed to insure all neighbouring cells have different PCIs. However, due
to the addition of new cells or changes of neighbour relations from ANR
functions, issues can arise, such as PCI collision, PCI confusion.
The measurement of PCI values for candidate cells can be used by C-SON to
detect potential PCI issues. The example in Fig A.x.-1 show the PCI values
assigned to neighboring cells, where
\- Cell #6: PCI = 7
\- Cell #10: PCI = 9
\- Cell #7: PCI = 1
\- Cell #8: PCI = 7
C-SON PCI configuration function can collect and anaylze the measurements to
detecet the PCI issue between cell #6 and cell #8.
Figure A.58-1: PCI configuration example
# A.59 Monitoring of RACH usage
The RACH plays a vital role in the following procedures:
> \- Initial access from RRC_IDLE;
>
> \- Initial access after radio link failure;
>
> \- Handover requiring random access procedure;
>
> \- DL data arrival during RRC_CONNECTED requiring random access procedure;
>
> \- UL data arrival during RRC_CONNECTED requiring random access procedure;
Furthermore, the random access procedure takes two distinct forms:
> \- Contention based using a randomly selected preamble (applicable to all
> five events);
>
> \- Non-contention based using a dedicated preamble (applicable to only
> handover and DL data arrival).
In the use-case of RACH configuration optimization, received Random Access
Preambles and a contention indicator are signalled across an OAM interface.
Monitoring of the preamble usage in a cell allows the operator to determine if
the resources allocated to the RACH by the gNodeB are appropriate for the
number of random access attempts. If the resources are underutilised, then the
operator may reconfigure the gNodeB (via CM) to allocate less resource to RACH
thereby freeing up resource for other uplink transmissions. Alternatively, if
the resources are heavily utilised then this is indicative of RACH congestion
leading to increased latency for the procedures listed above. To this effect,
measurements directly reflecting RACH congestion experienced by the gNodeB and
by the UEs are useful.
The gNodeB can partition the RACH resource between dedicated preambles,
randomly selected preambles in group A and randomly selected preambles in
group B. This partitioning can be evaluated when usage measurements are made
on each set separately. In a cell configured with multiple SSBs, it is
important to get the measurements per SSB.
# A.**60** Monitoring of the number of active UEs in NG-RAN
The number of the active UEs per direction in each cell is a valuable
measurement for operators to know how many DRBs are running with buffered data
per cell and QoS or S-NSSAI basis. For multi-operator RAN sharing scenario,
PLMN basis is needed, too. This kind of information can help operators to tune
the admission control parameters for the cell and to estimate load in
neighbour cells, to ensure that the UEs admitted achieve the target QoS and
that capacity is not over-estimated when distributing load between cells and
gNBs.
# A.61 Monitoring of one way delay between PSA UPF and NG-RAN
The DL and UL one way delay has direct impact to users\' experience for some
types of services (e.g., URLLC). The one way delay between PSA UPF and NG-RAN
is part of the end to end one-way delay and is not expected very long
comparing to the delay in between NG-RAN and UE.
In case the PSA UPF and NG-RAN are time synchronised, the UL one way delay can
be measured by PSA UPF and the DL one way delay can be measured by NG-RAN.
The measurements on the one way DL and UL delay between PSA UPF and NG-RAN can
be used to evaluate and optimize the DL and UL user plane delay performance
between 5GC and NG-RAN.
# A.62 Monitoring of round-trip delay between PSA UPF and NG-RAN
The end to end delay in 5G networks between UE and PSA UPF has direct impact
to users\' experience for some types of services (e.g., URLLC). The delay
between PSA UPF and NG-RAN is part of the end to end one-way delay and is not
expected very long comparing to the delay in between NG-RAN and UE.
In case the PSA UPF and NG-RAN are not time synchronised, the round-trip delay
can be measured at PSA UPF.
The measurements on the round-trip delay between PSA UPF and NG-RAN can be
used to evaluate and optimize the DL and UL user plane delay performance
between 5GC and NG-RAN.
# A.63 Monitoring of beam switches
Beam is an important feature in 5G networks. In case the intra-beam switch
function is enabled (see TS 38.331 [20]), due to the complexity of the radio
environment, especially when UE moves quickly and frequently, it is possible
to have problems such as pointing deviation, which can lead to switch failure.
The success rate of beam switch can help to reflect whether there is a problem
in beam related parameter configuration. Furthermore, low beam switch success
rate will impact user experience. Therefore, it is essential in network
operations to monitor the success rate of beam switch and to define the
related measurements.
# A.64 Monitoring of RF performance
Monitoring of the quality of RF signal in the cell is useful for the purpose
of network planning and network optimization.
In case the L1-RSRP report function is enabled, measurements of RSRP per beam
reported by UEs is a useful metric reflecting RF signal strength. In 5G NR,
gNB cells transmit many narrow beams targeting UEs in the cell that result in
better link budget and lower interference. However, some areas between beams
of neighbouring NR cells , or between the NR cell and the neighbor E-UTRA cell
may experience poor coverage or coverage holes. Therefore, it is necessary to
optimize the beam coverage by coordinating the beam management function across
multiple neighboring NR cells.
The Absolute Timing Advance reflects the distance of the UE from the cell
antenna. The distribution of Absolute Timing Advance reflects UE distribution
in the NR cell, thus it is helpful for analyzing the coverage and the
capacity.
# A.65 Monitoring of one way delay between PSA UPF and UE
The end to end DL/UL delay in 5G networks between UE and PSA UPF has direct
impact to users\' experience for some types of services (e.g., URLLC). In case
the PSA UPF and NG-RAN are time synchronised, the DL/UL delay between PSA UPF
and UE can be measured at PSA UPF.
The measurements on the DL/UL delay between PSA UPF and NE can be used to
evaluate the user plane delay performance in 5G networks and users\'
experience.
# A.66 Monitoring of MRO performance
5G NR cells may experience issues, such as too early or too late handover,
handover to wrong cell, ping-pong handover, that not only impact user
experience, but also waste network resources, if handover parameters are not
set properly. MRO is intended to automatically detect the handover issues, and
determine actions to configure the handover parameters in cells in order to
improve the handover performance.
It is also important to have information about the used beams in the source in
order to optimize the handover performance taking beam IDs into account.
The MRO related measurements are used to support the mobility roburstness
optimization SON function.
# A.67 Monitoring of distribution of integrated delay in NG-RAN
The integrated DL/UL packet delay in NG-RAN, i.e., the delay between NG-RAN
and UE (including the delay at gNB-CU-UP, on F1-U and on gNB-DU for split
scenario and the delay over Uu interface) is one significant part of the e2e
delay that has direct impact to users\' experience for some types of services
(e.g., URLLC).
Besides the average integrated delay in NG-RAN which can reflect whether or
not the users experience can be met on average, it is very useful for operator
to know how many (percents of) data packets are with satfistfied delay
perfomance, and how many are not with satisfied performance and how far they
are from the satisfied performance. Therefore, the distribution of integrated
delay in NG-RAN needs to be monitored.
As each S-NSSAI or 5QI has different requirements on the delay, so the
distribution of integrated delay in NG-RAN needs to be monitored per S-NSSAI
and per 5QI.
For multi-operator RAN sharing scenario, different operators may have
different S-NSSAI or 5QI requirements on the packet delay, so the distribution
of integrated delay in NG-RAN per S-NSSAI and per 5QI for each PLMN needs to
be monitored, too.
# A.68 Monitoring of GTP data packets and volume on N9 interface
In 5GC, the user plane data traffic is transmitted on N9 interface between PSA
UPF and I-UPF. The data volume of GTP data packets on N9 interface is helpful
for operators to understand the traffic distribution of the 5GC, and evaluate
and optimize the bandwidth of the N9 interface. The number of GTP packets on
the N9 interface is relevant to the packets processing that may result in
larger or smaller packet delay on the interface.
Therefore, the data volume and number of GTP data packets on the N9 interface
need to be monitored.
To support the resource allocation and optimization on N9 interface for the
network slicing, the data volume and GTP data packets need to be monitored for
each S-NSSAI.
# A.69 Use case of UE power headroom
UE power headroom measurement is important for analyzing UE power
distribution, to learn whether the uplink signal strength can be increased or
not. So it is very useful to do trouble shooting of coverage hole and coverage
balance for uplink. It is also used to evaluate the power control performance
and increase UE power headroom as possible with QoS is guaranteed for the
purpose of energy saving. These questions are determined by the ratio of the
number of larger or less than threshold to the total number of it and the
threshold is configurable.
# A.70 Monitor of paging performance
In NR, Paging is under the control of the 5GC or NG-RAN (aka RAN initiated
paging and CN initiated paging). When the 5GC wants to page (CN initiated
paging) a UE, it has to page it in all cells that belong to the TA(s) to which
the UE is registered.
The paging load per cell and gNB is an important measure for the operator as
it allows the operator to properly dimension the resources for paging in the
NR Cell and gNB.
At an NR Cell and gNB it makes sense to measure the number of discarded paging
messages if this is due to some problem in the gNB, such as paging occasion
overflow. In that scenario the periodicity of paging occasions can be
reconfigured in order to ensure that all paging messages are transmitted by
the gNB in the first available paging occasion, thereby avoiding paging delays
and extended call setup delay.
Operators need to know when such an event occurs, in order to identify if the
problem is at the NR cell or gNB level or not.
In addition to discarded paging records measurement, it is important to know
total paging records received so that discarded paging records ratio can be
derived.
Total number of paging records received is important in the sense that, it may
be fine if the discarded paging records are high if discarded paging records
ratio is small. On the other hand, it may be problematic if discarded paging
records are low, if discarded paging records ratio turn out to be high.
# A.71 UE and traffic per SSB beam related measurements
UE and traffic per SSB beam related measurements is helpful for analyzing
users and services under different SSB beam coverage, and for network
optimization and adjustment of SSB beam coverage or balancing of users and
traffic under different SSB BEAM beams. Through the statistics, operator can
learn about user distribution and service distribution which is the important
information for network planning.
# A.72 Monitoring of network slice selection
The network slice selection service enables the network to select the network
slice to serve the UE, and enables the NSSF to provide the AMF the Allowed
NSSAI and the Configured NSSAI for the Serving PLMN.
The network slice selection service may be consumed during Registration
procedure, during inter-PLMN mobility procedure, PDU session establishment and
UE configuration update, etc.
The network slice selection is the primary step enabling the 5G networks to
support network slicing, therefore the performance of network slice selection
needs to be monitored.
# A.73 Use case of EPS fallback monitor
Under the constraints of UE and network coverage, EPS fallback is an important
means to guarantee voice continuity. Restricted by the UE capability and
network configuration, the EPS fallback supports the modes of handover and
redirection.The measurement related to EPS fallback is helpful for evaluating
voice continuity and for the operator\'s network planning and optimization.
# A.74 Use case of EPS fallback handover time monitor
The measurement statistics of EPS fallback handover time include the total
time consumed by the whole handover time or the time in the execution phase.
The EPS fallback handover time directly affects user perception, and the time
in the execution phase helps to optimize the performance of different systems.
# A.75 Use case of MU-MIMO measurements
The application of MU-MIMO greatly improves the network capacity. Whether MU-
MIMO getting the most out of itself will impact the improvement of network
capacity and performance. MU-MIMO related statistics can reflect the disparity
between the actual effect of MU-MIMO and the maximum layers supported by the
network, and help to fix and improve the MU-MIMO algorithm.
# A.76 Monitoring of subscriber profile sizes in UDM
The subscriber profiles maintained by UDM have two parts - static and dynamic
data. Dynamic part of the subscriber profile grows over time (e.g. due to
roaming conditions, dynamic dereferencing of provisioning data,
addition/enabling of new features). The uncontrolled and unnoticed growth of
subscriber profiles may result in degraded system performance and lead to
service impacts.
Various corrective actions varying from subscriber profile optimization
(clean-up/compression/re-structuring) to applying configuration changes and
scaling may be applied to resolve/mitigate the issue.
Operators need to be aware of the subscriber profile size dynamics in order to
be able to mitigate potential network-wide problems before they occur.
# A.77 Monitoring of SS-RSRQ
SS-RSRQ is used in 5G NR networks to determine the quality of the radio
channel. RSRQ, unlike RSRP (wanted signal strength), also includes
interference level due to the inclusion of RSSI in calculation. This
measurement is usefule to eveluate the qulity of cell coverage through the SS-
RSRQ distribution,especially to optimize cell selection and handover related
parameters configration, mainly in border parts of cell.
# A.78 Monitoring of SS-SINR
SS-SINR is the ratio of the received signal level and the sum of interference
and noise, which is used in 5G NR networks to determine the quality of the
radio channel. This measurement is useful to eveluate the QoS of
Synchronization Signal through the SS-SINR distribution for each cell. It is
helpful to troubleshooting weak coverage cell or low NR access rate cell
according to the ratio of SS-SINR bins that is below predefined threshold and
all of the SS-SINR bins.
# A.79 Monitoring of S-NSSAI availability update and notification
The S-NSSAI(s) supported by the AMF on a per TS basis may be changed and the
change needs be updated to NSSF. The AMF may subscribe to the notification of
any changes to the NSSAI availability information updated by another AMF on a
per TA basis.
The up-to-date and effective S-NSSAI availability information are fundamental
to support network slicing for 5G, therefore the performance of S-NSSAI
availability service needs to be monitored.
# A.80 Monitoring of SMS delivery procedures
SMS delivery is one of the essential procedures for SMS service. The
performance of SMS delivery procedures reflect the quality of SMS service for
users. The monitoring of SMS delivery request and success is needed for SMS
service evaluation.
# A.81 Monitoring of registration and de-registration procedure for SMS
In order to activate SMS service for a given service user, a registration
procedure for SMS over NAS is needed. Registration procedure related
measurements can reflect the success ratio for access to 5GS of SMS users.
De-registration procedure is invoked to deactivate SMS service for a given
service user, which results in deleting an individual UE Context for SMS in
the SMSF. De-registration procedure related measurements can reflect the
success ratio for deactivating SMS service.
# A.82 Monitoring of NIDD (Non-IP Data Delivery)
NIDD service may be used to handle Mobile Originated (MO) and Mobile
Terminated (MT) communication with UEs to AF, where the data used for the
communication is considered unstructured (a.k.a., Non-IP).
NIDD is handled using an Unstructured PDU session to the NEF, and NIDD API may
be used for a PDU session based on the configuration in the subscription.
The NIDD configuration service can be used for AF to update the NEF ID for the
NIDD service, and to indicate which serialization formats it supports for
mobile originated and mobile terminated traffic in the Reliable Data Server
Configuration.
Therefore, for evaluation of NIDD performance, the NIDD configuration and NIDD
service need to be monitored with the relevant performance measurements.
# A.83 Monitoring of AF traffic influence
As described in TS 23.501 [4], an Application Function may send requests to
influence SMF routeing decisions for User Plane traffic of PDU Sessions. The
AF requests may influence UPF (re)selection and allow routeing of user traffic
to a local access (identified by a DNAI) to a Data Network. The AF may request
the traffic influence via NEF.
The fulfilment of traffic influence per the request from AF means that the
user data traffic is routed according to the requirements from the
application, therefore performance measurements are needed to indicate whether
the AF traffic influence requests are fulfilled.
# A.84 Monitoring of external parameter provisioning
The NEF allows an external party (AF) to provision the information, such as
expected UE behaviour (regarding UE movement or communication characteristics)
and service specific parameters, or the 5G VN (Virtual Network) group
information to 5G network functions, see TS 23.501 [4].
The failed external parameter provisioning would impact the UE behaviour or
service fulfilment; therefore, the performance of external parameter
provisioning needs to be monitored.
# A.85 Monitoring of SMF-NEF connection establishment
For delivering the NIDD service, the SMF-NEF connection needs to be
established for a PDU Session for a UE. NEF provides the capabilities to
create, update and release the SMF-NEF connection.
The SMF-NEF connection is used for transferring the NIDD data, therefore the
performance of the SMF-NEF connection establishment impacts users\' experience
about the NIDD service.
# A.86 Monitoring of service specific parameters provisioning
AF may need to provide service specific parameters to 5G system via NEF in
order to support the service not provided by the PLMN. The 5GS, after
receiving via NEF, delivers the service specific parameters to the target UEs.
The service specific parameter provisioning service provided by NEF is
critical for the 5GS (including the UEs) to support these services. Therefore,
it would be necessary for the operators to monitor the performance of the
service specific parameter provisioning.
# A.87 Monitoring of background data transfer policy negotiation and
application
AF may need to negotiate the policies for future background data transfer with
5GS via NEF, before the UE\'s PDU Session establishment. Per the request from
AF, the NEF negotiates with H-PCF about the transfer policies for the future
background data transfer. The transfer policies may contain a desired time
window for the background data transfer, a reference to a charging rate for
the time window, network area information, and optionally a maximum aggregated
bitrate, as described in clause 6.1.2.4 of TS 23.503 [46].
The AF may apply the negotiated policies for a future PDU Session at some
point.
The policies for the background data transfer have strong relevance to users\'
experience, therefore the measurements are needed to monitor the performance
of policy negotiation and application for background data transfer.
# A.88 Monitoring of data management for UDR
UDR provides data management services for the subscriber and application
related data, including:
\- Subscription Data,
\- Policy Data,
\- Structured Data for exposure,
\- Application data: Packet Flow Descriptions (PFDs) for application detection
and AF request information for multiple UEs;
\- NF Group ID corresponding to subscriber identifier (e.g. IMPI, IMPU, SUPI).
The data management services provided by UDR allow to its consumer (e.g., UDM,
PCF and NEF) to read, create, update, delete a particular set of data and
subscribe/unsubscribe to notification of relevant data changes.
Users\' service may not be fulfilled due to a poorly performing (e.g.
overloaded) data management service, therefore it is indispensable that the
performance of data management services can be monitored.
# A.89 Monitoring of background data transfer policy control
For background data transfer, AF may need to negotiate the policies for with
5GS via NEF, and apply the negotiated policies for a future PDU Session.
PCF provides the services for NEF to control the background data transfer
polices, including creation and update of the background data transfer
policies.
The fulfilment of background data transfer related services for the users rely
on background data transfer policy. Therefore it is necessary to monitor the
performance of background data transfer policy control.
# A.90 Monitoring of AF session with QoS
To support a specific QoS requirements for an application, the AF may provide
the required QoS information when setting up the connection with the UE. NEF
offers the \"AF session with QoS\" service allowing the AF to send the QoS
information for the session, and then interacts with 5GC NFs to apply the QoS
requirements to the session.
If the 5GC fails to meet required QoS for an application for the UE, the
user's experience is directly impacted. Therefore, the performance of \"AF
session with QoS\" needs to be monitored.
# A.91 Monitoring of UCMF provisioning
The UCMF is used for storage of dictionary entries corresponding to either
PLMN-assigned or Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability IDs.
Provisioning of Manufacturer-assigned UE Radio Capability ID entries in the
UCMF is performed from an AF that interacts with the UCMF either directly or
via the NEF.
Knowing the UE radio capabilities is critical for the 5G system to provide the
appropriate control for the UE, missing the UE radio capabilities may cause
discretional control for the UEs thus result in failures or performance
degradation. Therefore, the performance measurements are needed to assess the
performance of UCMF provisioning.
# A.92 Monitoring of Time-domain average Maximum Scheduled Layer Number for
MIMO scenario
The Time-domain average maximum scheduled layer number for MIMO scenario
measurement could provide operators the scheduled layer number, the actural
spatial capability of a cell under MIMO scenario and can help operators to
calculate the radio resource untilization rate.
# A.93 Monitoring of Average value of scheduled MIMO layers per PRB
> The average value of scheduled MIMO layers per PRB should be monitored, as
> it reflects the capacity improvement brought by MIMO in the 5G business
> network, quantitatively. The operators can use this information to compare
> cell capacity among different areas and support capacity enhancement
> decision-making. Besides, the information can be used to optimize the MIMO
> equipment performance and other OAM works.
# A.94 Monitoring of policy authorization
To ensure the 5GS has proper AM and SM polices supporting an external
application, the AF may need to query, create, or change the AM and SM
policies for a UE in the 5GS.
The PCF may authorize the AF to, directly or indirectly via NEF, query, create
or change the AM and SM policies.
The performance of AM and SM policy management authorization to AF may
directly impact the user's experience when using the subject applications,
therefore the policy authorization needs to be monitored.
# A.95 Monitoring of event exposure
An NF (e.g., NEF or NWDAF) may need to subscribe and get notified about PCF
events for a group of UE(s) or any UE accessing a combination of (DNN,
S-NSSAI).
The events can be subscribed by a NF consumer from PCF are described in clause
6.1.3.18 of TS 23.503 [46].
The NF consumer may use the events exposed by PCF for controlling the UE,
hence the performance of event exposure needs to be monitored.
# A.96 Monitoring of PRB Usage for MIMO in NG-RAN
The PRB Usage for MIMO with dynamic factor measurement could provide operators
the load information of radio network in MIMO scenario taking spatial resource
into consideration. In the early stage of network development, the
measurements with a dynamic spatial factor can reflect the actual frequency
and space resource utilization of a cell after MU-MIMO is activated. In the
late stage of network development, the measurements can help operators be
aware of whether a cell has experienced high load.
The SDM PDSCH/PUSCH PRB Usage considers all subscribers' MIMO layers in a
cell. Correspondingly, it is based on the average value of all scheduled MIMO
layers. When subscribers in a cell spread over (e.g. distribute randomly),
operators can use SDM PDSCH/PUSCH PRB Usage to evaluate the usage of cell
capacity in this scenario.
# A.97 Monitoring of subscriber data management at UDM
The subscribe data are managed in UDM, and provided to other consumer NFs
(e.g., AMF, SMF, SMSF, NEF, and 5G DDNMF, etc) in 5GS to provide the network
services to the users. The subscriber data management in UDM allows some
consumer NFs to get the subscriber data, and some consumer NFs to subscribe to
the notifications of the updates of the subscriber data. It is important to
monitor the performance of the subscriber data management.
# A.98 Monitoring of parameter provisioning at UDM
The UDM allows provision, by the consumer NF (e.g., NEF), of information which
can be used for the UE in 5GS, such as expected UE behaviour (regarding UE
movement or communication characteristics) and service specific parameters, or
the 5G VN (Virtual Network) group information to 5G network functions, see TS
23.501 [4].
The failed parameter provisioning would impact the UE behaviour or service
fulfilment; therefore, it is needed to monitor the performance of parameter
provisioning.
# A.99 Use case of measurements for ECS.
ECS related measurements are used to measure the performance of an ECS on each
of the supported functionality.
The EES Registration procedure allows an EES to provide its information to an
ECS to be used during service provisioning. It is useful to analyse the EES
registration success rate in order to assess ECS performance. If the failure
rate increases beyond a defined threshold, corrective actions can be taken by
the OAM systems. Hence, it is necessary to collect measurement related with
EES Registration procedures.
# A.100 Use case of measurements for EES.
EES related measurements are used to measure the performance of an EES on each
of the supported functionality.
Discovery procedures enable entities in an edge deployment to obtain
information about EAS and their available services, based on specified
criteria of interest. It is useful to analyse the EAS discovery success rate
in order to assess EES performance. The discovery procedure may fail due to
the unavailability of the relavant EAS. If the failure rate increases beyond a
defined threshold, corrective actions (e.g instantiating the required EAS) can
be taken by the OAM systems. Hence, it is necessary to collect measurement
realted with EEC Registration procedures.
An EEC performs registration with an EES in order to provide information that
can be used by the EES in Edge Computing services. It is useful to analyse the
EEC registration success rate in order to assess EES performance. If the
failure rate increases beyond a defined threshold, corrective actions can be
taken by the OAM systems. Hence, it is necessary to collect measurement
related with EEC Registration procedures.
The EAS Registration procedure allows an EAS to provide its information to an
EES in order to enable its discovery. It is useful to analyse the EAS
registration success rate in order to assess EES performance. If the failure
rate increases beyond a defined threshold, corrective actions can be taken by
the OAM systems. Hence, it is necessary to collect measurement related with
EAS Registration procedures.
# A.101 Monitoring of location management
The UE location is required for various purposes, e.g., location-based
applications, lawful interception, emergency calls, as well as the positioning
services, etc.
The LMF manages the overall co-ordination and scheduling of resources required
for the location of a UE for 5G. It also calculates or verifies a final
location and any velocity estimate and may estimate the achieved accuracy. The
LMF determine the result of the positioning in geographical co-ordinates.
The LMF provides location management related NF services (such as location
determination, location notification, and location context transfer) in order
for the consumer to get the location of the UEs. Therefore, the performance of
location management related NF services need to be monitored in order to
evaluate whether it can fulfil the consumer's requirements, and to figure out
the causes for the failures to derive the remedy solutions.
# A.102 Monitoring of DRBs undergoing GTP User Plane Path failures
The DRB setup procedure in NG-RAN is to assign resources in gNB and on the air
interface (Uu) for one or several DRBs that will handle the QoS flows
requested to setup by the core network. The gNB may map several QoS flows to
the same DRB so there is no one-to-one mapping between the flows and DRBs.
At DRB setup, the gNB will handle all QoS flows mapped to one DRB the same
(mapped 5QI). A QoS flow that is at a later stage mapped to an already setup
existing DRB will not increment the DRB setup counters.
The DRB setup is one of the most key procedures to allocate resources in the
NG-RAN to the UE per the QoS requirements. Whether or not the DRB is
successfully setup has direct impact to the user experience. A failed DRB
setup may directly cause service failure or degradation for an end user. So,
the performance related to the DRB setup for the gNB needs to be monitored per
supported mapped 5QI and per S-NSSAI.
During transient path failures (e.g. path failures not exceeding few minutes
at most), maintaining the PDU session contexts associated with the peer\'s IP
address enables the delivery of end user services (when the path is re-
established again) and this also avoids unnecessary signalling in the network
for restoring those PDU sessions.\ It is not intended to maintain PDU session
contexts during long path failures (e.g. exceeding few minutes at most) as
this would imply undesirable effects like undue charging.
The total number of active transient path failures irrespective of whether
this path restores into PDU session or not is measured with this use case.
# A.103 Use case of measurements for ECS.
ECS related measurements are used to measure the performance of an ECS on each
of the supported functionality.
Service provisioning procedures enable EEC to discover the available edge
service. It is useful to analyse the service provisioning success rate in
order to assess ECS performance. The provisionig procedure may fail due to the
unavailability of the relavant EES. If the failure rate increases beyond a
defined threshold, corrective actions (e.g instantiating the required EES) can
be taken by the OAM systems. Hence, it is necessary to collect measurement
related with service provisioning procedures.
