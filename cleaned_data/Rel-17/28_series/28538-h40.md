# 4 Concepts and overview
## 4.1 Concept of edge computing management
The edge computing services are provided by edge computing service providers
(ECSP), application service providers (ASP), and PLMN operators (see annex B
in TS 23.558 [1]), where ASP is responsible for the creation of edge
application servers (EAS) and application clients (AC), ECSP is responsible
for the deployment of edge data networks (EDN) that contain EAS and EES, and
PLMN operator is responsible for the deployment of 5G network functions, such
as 5GC and 5G NR.
Figure 4.1-1 describes the edge computing management framework that contains
PLMN management system and ECSP management system. ECSP management system, as
the producer, provides management services enabling ASP and ECSP consumers to
orchestrate and manage EDN NFs (e.g., EAS, EES, and ECS). PLMN management
system, as the producer, provides management services enabling ECSP management
system to interconnect EDN NFs with 5GC NFs (e.g., PCF, UPF, NEF). Both ECSP
management system and PLMN management system communicate with ETSI NFV MANO to
perform lifecycle management functions.
Figure 4.1-1: Edge computing management framework
# 5 Edge Computing Management (ECM) capabilities
## 5.1 Lifecycle management
### 5.1.1 Description
The lifecycle management of the edge components is to be enabled by the 3GPP
Management System. The lifecycle management includes instantiation,
termination, modification and query of the edge components.
### 5.1.2 EAS deployment
The goal of this use case is to enable ASP to deploy the EAS in the EDN, by
requesting the provisioning MnS producer with the deployment requirements
(e.g. the topological or geographical service areas, software image
information, QoS, affinity/anti-affinity with other EAS, etc.) to deploy the
EAS. The provisioning MnS producer returns a response indicating the operation
is in progress to prevent the consumer from waiting, as the deployment in the
edge cloud may take a while. Since, there can be multiple Edge Data Network
(EDN) present/serving a particular edge location. This makes it critical for
application service provider to have their EAS deployed at appropriate EDN(s)
to provide high performance services for the UE. Therefore, provisioning MnS
producer analyses the deployment requirements to determine where (i.e. on
which EDN) and how many EAS VNF instance(s) should be instantiated, and
requests the NFVO in ETSI NFV MANO to instantiate the EAS VNF instance(s). The
provisioning MnS producer sends a notification to ASP indicating the result of
instantiation (e.g. success, failure) when a notification is received from
NFVO indicating the result of instantiation operation.
### 5.1.3 EAS termination
The goal of this use case is to enable ASP to terminate the EAS in the EDN, by
requesting the provisioning MnS producer to terminate the EAS VNF instance.
The provisioning MnS producer requests the NFVO in ETSI NFV MANO to terminate
the EAS VNF instances. The provisioning MnS producer sends a notification to
ASP indicating the termination is in progress when a notification is received
from NFVO indicating the start of termination operation. The provisioning MnS
producer sends another notification to ASP indicating the result of
termination (e.g. success, failure) when a notification is received from NFVO
indicating the result of termination operation.
### 5.1.4 Query EAS information
The goal of this use case is to enable ASP to query the EAS information in the
EDN, by requesting the provisioning MnS producer to query the EAS instance.
Upon receiving the query request, the provisioning MnS producer sends the EAS
instance information to ASP.
### 5.1.5 EAS modification
The goal of this use case is to enable ASP to modify the EAS in the EDN, by
requesting the provisioning MnS producer to modify the EAS instance. If the
modification requires the change (e.g. scale) for the virtualized resource of
the EAS VNF instance, the provisioning MnS producer requests the NFVO in ETSI
NFV MANO for the appropriate operation of the EAS VNF instances. The
provisioning MnS producer sends a notification to ASP indicating the
attribute(s) change of the EAS instance.
### 5.1.6 EES Deployment
The provisioning MnS producer is requested to instantiate the EES, as 3GPP
network functions, aiming to server the particular location. The instantiated
EES may serve one or multiple EAS.
A consumer request for EES(s) instantiation providing EES deployment
requirements. The provisioning MnS producer determines the EDN where the
EES(s) will be instantiated, instantiate the EES VNF and establish the
connection with 5GC network functions. The provisioning MnS producer will
accept the request and notify the consumer about the instantiation in-
progress. Thereafter, the notification will be sent to indicate the successful
EES instantiation.
### 5.1.7 EES Termination
The goal is to enable the termination of one or more EES(s) on the EDN. A
consumer consumes the provisioning MnS to terminate the EES with the EES
identifier. The provisioning MnS producer terminates the EES VNF based on the
EES identifier, and disconnects the EES from the 5GC network functions. The
provisioning MnS producer will accept the request and notify the consumer
about the termination in-progress. Thereafter, the notification will be sent
to indicate that the EES has been terminated successfully.
### 5.1.8 Query EES information
The goal of this use case is to enable a consumer to query the EES information
in the EDN, by requesting the provisioning MnS producer to query the EES
instance. Upon receiving the query request, the provisioning MnS producer
sends the EES instance information to the consumer.
### 5.1.9 EES Modification
The goal of this use case is to enable a consumer to modify the EES in the
EDN, by requesting the provisioning MnS producer to modify the EES instance.
If the modification requires the change (e.g. scale) for the virtualized
resource of the EES VNF instance, the provisioning MnS producer requests the
NFVO in ETSI NFV MANO for the appropriate operation of the EES VNF instances.
The provisioning MnS producer sends a notification to the consumer indicating
the attribute(s) change of the EES instance.
### 5.1.10 ECS Deployment
_The goal is to_ enable the instantiation of one or more ECS. To support
deployed EDN, operator will deploy ECS serving one or multiple EES. A consumer
request for ECS(s) instantiation providing ECS deployment requirements. The
provisioning MnS producer instantiate the ECS VNF and establish the required
connection with 5GC network functions. The notifications will be sent to
indicate that the ECS has been instantiated successfully.
### 5.1.11 ECS Termination
_The goal is to_ enable the termination of one or more ECS. A consumer
consumes the provisioning service to terminate the ECS with the ECS
identifier. The provisioning MnS producer terminates the ECS VNF based on the
ECS identifier, and disconnects the ECS from the 5GC network functions. The
notification will be sent to indicate that the ECS has been terminated
successfully.
### 5.1.12 Query ECS information
The goal of this use case is to enable a consumer to query the ECS instance
information, by requesting the provisioning MnS producer to query the ECS
instance. Upon receiving the query request, the provisioning MnS producer
sends the ECS instance information to the consumer.
### 5.1.13 ECS Modification
The goal of this use case is to enable a consumer to modify the ECS instance,
by requesting the provisioning MnS producer to modify the ECS instance. If the
modification requires the change (e.g. scale) for the virtualized resource of
the ECS VNF instance, the provisioning MnS producer requests the NFVO in ETSI
NFV MANO for the appropriate operation of the ECS VNF instances. The
provisioning MnS producer sends a notification to the consumer indicating the
attribute(s) change of the ECS instance.

## 5.2 Performance assurance
### 5.2.1 Description
The clause contains use cases associated with performance assurance.
### 5.2.2 EAS performance assurance
_The goal of this use case is to provide a mechanism for EAS to publish KPIs
or measurements, as per requirements shown in Table 5.2.2-1 (see clause
5.2.10.2_ in TS 23.558 [2]).
Table 5.2.2-1: Edge Application Server Service KPIs
* * *
Information element Status Description Maximum Request rate O Maximum request
rate from the Application Client supported by the server. Maximum Response

* * *
A consumer, such as ASP, would consume performance assurance MnS to request
the ECSP management system to collect EAS KPIs and measurements. The
performance assurance MnS producer at ECSP management system will report the
measurements to the consumer.
### 5.2.3 5GC NF measurements to evaluate EAS performance
_The goal is to_ enable ECSP management system to collect the measurements of
5GC NFs (e.g. UPF, PCF, ...) that are needed to evaluate the EAS performance.
For example, the ECSP management system can correlate the 5GC NF and EAS
measurements to determine the root cause of poor EAS performance. ECSP
management system, as the consumer would consume performance assurance MnS to
request the PLMN management system to collect 5GC NF measurements that are
related to EAS performance. The performance assurance MnS producer at PLMN
management system will report the measurements to the consumer.
Since an PLMN operator may not want to expose certain measurements (e.g.
measurements for 5GC NF(s) not relevant to EAS) to 3^rd^ party operators, like
ECSP, the PLMN management system should be able to select specific
measurements to be reported to the consumer.
### 5.2.4 ECS performance assurance
_The goal of this use case is to provide a mechanism for ECS performance
assurance. ECS performance can be based on various functionalities defined for
ECS in (see clause 6.3.4 of [2])._ The measurement/KPI should be defined for
each functionality, that can be collected as and when required.
A consumer, such as ECSP Management system, would consume performance
assurance MnS to request the PLMN management system to collect ECS KPIs and
measurements. The performance assurance MnS producer at PLMN management system
will report the measurements to the consumer.
### 5.2.5 EES performance assurance
_The goal of this use case is to provide a mechanism for EES performance
assurance. EES performance can be based on various functionalities defined for
EES in (see clause 6.3.4 of [2])._ The measurement/KPI should be defined for
each functionality, that can be collected as and when required.
A consumer, such as ECSP Management system, would consume performance
assurance MnS to request the PLMN management system to collect EES KPIs and

## 5.3 Fault supervision
### 5.3.1 Description
The clause contains use cases associated with fault supervision.
### 5.3.2 EDN NF performance impacted by 5GC NF alarms
_The goal is to_ enable ECSP management system to receive 5GC NFs (e.g. UPF,
PCF, NEF, SCEF, ...) alarms that may impact the EDN NFs (e.g. EAS, EES)
performance from PLMN management system. ECSP management system can correlate
the 5GC NF alarms to determine the root causes for poor EDN NF performance.
ECSP management system subscribes to receive 5GC NF alarms from PLMN
management system. PLMN management system sends the NF alarm notification to
ECSP management system when it detects 5GC NF alarms.
### 5.3.3 5GC NF issues resulted from EDN NF alarms
_The goal is to_ enable PLMN management system to receive EDN NFs (e.g. EAS,
EES, ECS) alarms that may generate issues in 5GC NFs (e.g. UPF, PCF, NEF,
SCEF, ...) that are supporting EDN from ECSP management system. PLMN
management system can correlate the EDN NF alarms to determine the root causes
for 5GC NF issues. PLMN management system subscribes to receive EDN NF alarms
from ECSP management system. ECSP management system sends the NF alarm
notification to PLMN management system when it detects EDN NF alarms.

## 5.4 5GC NF Provisioning
### 5.4.1 Description
The clause contains use cases associated with provisioning.
### 5.4.2 EDN NF 5GC connection provisioning
_The goal is to_ enable ECSP management system to request PLMN management
system to query the connection information of EDN NFs (i.e., EAS, EES, ECS) to
5GC NFs, as specified in c _lauses 6.3.2, 6.3.4, 6.4.6 in TS 23.558 [2],_
where EES, ECS, and EAS are interacting with 3GPP Core Network for accessing
the capabilities of network functions either directly (e.g. via PCF) or
indirectly (e.g. via SCEF/NEF/SCEF+NEF).
Figure 5.x.2-1 shows an example of edge computing networks. EDN #1 is trusted
by PLMN operators; therefore, EAS #1 and EES #1 are acting as the trusted AF,
and are authorized to interfaces to PCF directly in via the N5 reference point
(see clause 4.2.3 in TS 23.501 [11]), or via Edge-7 and Edge-2 interfaces (see
clause 6.2 in TS 23.558). EDN #2 is not trusted by PLMN operators; therefore,
EAS #2 and EES #2 are acting as the untrusted AF, and are not authorized to
interfaces to PCF directly (See clause 5.6.7.1 TS 23.501 [11]), and need to
interface to NEF / SCEF via the N33 reference point (see Figure 4.2.3-5 in TS
23.501), or via Edge-7 and Edge-2 interfaces. ECS should be able to connect to
NEF / SCEF via the edge-8 interface (see clause 6.3.4 in TS 23.558 [2]).
Figure 5.4.2-1: Edge computing networks
ECSP management system requests PLMN management system to identify the PCF,
NEF, or SCEF to which the EDN NFs need to interface. The request should
include the EDN identifier and the service area requirements (i.e., EDN
service area, EES service area, and EAS service area (see clause 7.3.3 in TS
23.558 [2])). PLMN management system finds and returns the connection
information (i.e., the IP addresses and DN of PCF, NEF, SCEF) to ECSP
management system, based on the requirements. ECSP management system then
connects EAS, ECS, and EES to 5GC NFs via the connection information given by
PLMN management system, according to Figure 5.4.2-1.
### 5.4.3 Configuration needed for EAS registration
_The goal is to_ enable a consumer to configure EASID and EES address for the
EAS that are required as the pre-conditions of EAS registration procedure (see
clause 8.4.3.2.1 in TS 23.558 [2]). A consumer (e.g. ASP, ECSP) requests ECSP
management system to configure the EASID and EES address attributes in
EASFunction IOC. ECSP management system configures the EASID and EES address
attributes in EASFunction MOI, and returns the attribute change notification
to the consumer.
### 5.4.4 EAS to connect with UPF
_The goal is to_ enable ECSP management system to connect a newly deployed EAS
to a UPF. Figure 5.4.4-1 shows that EASs are deployed in the local part of the
Data Network (DN) that are connected to UPF to carry the user traffic via the
N6 interface (see clause 6.3.3 in TS 23.501 [11]). ECSP management system
requests PLMN management system to connect a newly deployed EAS to a UPF with
_EAS IP address,_ EAS service area requirements (see clause 7.3.3.6 in TS
23.558 [2])), and list of DNAI and N6 traffic routing requirements ((see Table
8.2.4.1 in TS 23.558 [2])). PLMN management system finds a UPF among the
UPF(s) being deployed that meets the service area requirements (e.g. UPF #2 is
found to connect to EAS #2). In the case that no UPF can be found (e.g. EAS
#3), PLMN management system will deploy a new UPF (e.g. UPF #3) and then
configure the SMF to add the UPF to the list of available UPF(s) (see clause
6.3.3.2 in TS 23.501 [11]). PLMN management system connects the UPF to the
EAS, and return the UPF information (e.g. IP addresses and DN of the UPF) to
the ECSP management system.

consumers have subscribed to the producer of provisioning MnS to receive
notifications.
Figure 7.1.2.1-1: EAS deployment
1\. ASP consumes the provisioning MnS with _createMOI_ operation (see clause
11.1.1.1. in TS 28.532 [w]) for EASRequirements IOC to request ECSP
provisioning MnS producer to start the EAS VNF instantiation, where the
EASRequirements IOC contains the deployment requirements, including (but not
limited to) the following attributes:
\- the service areas (i.e., geographical, or topological) where the UEs can
access the edge computing service (see clause 7.3.3 in TS 28.558 [2]).
\- Software image information and virtual resource information (e.g. software
image location, minimum RAM, disk requirements) (see clause 7.1.6.5 and 7.1.9
in ETSI NFV IFA-011 [7]).
\- QoS requirements (e.g. bandwidth, end-to-end latency).
\- service continuity requirements (e.g. whether service continuity is
required).
\- Affinity/Anti-affinity: The affinity and ant-affinity requirements for the
EAS with other existing EAS on the target EDN.
2\. ECSP provisioning MnS producer sends a response to the ASP indicating that
the instantiation operation is in progress.
3\. ECSP provisioning MnS producer analyses the deployment requirements to
determine which EDN and how many EAS instance(s) should be instantiated to
satisfy the deployment requirements, and downloads the EAS VNF software image
from the software image location. The EDN can be selected either by
considering the individual requirement or by grouping the multiple
requirements as single selection criteria.
4\. ECSP provisioning MnS producer invokes the _InstantiateNsRequest_ or
UpdateNsRequest operation (see clause 7.3.3 and 7.3.5 in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013
[6]) to request NFVO via the Os-Ma-nfvo interface to instantiate a NS instance
including the EAS VNF instance.
Editor\'s note: which entity is responsible for creating VNFD based on the
deployment requirement (e.g., softwareImageInfo and virtualResource) is FFS.
5\. NFVO sends **a** notification to ECSP provisioning MnS producer indicating
the result of instantiation procedure (see clause 7.3.3.4 and 7.3.5.4 of ETSI
GS NFV-IFA 013 [6]).
6\. If the VNF instantiation has been successful, ECSP provisioning MnS
producer creates the MOI for EASFunction IOC.
7\. If all VNF instance(s) have been successfully instantiated, then:
7.1. ECSP provisioning MnS producer creates the MOI for EASRequirements IOC.
7.2. ECSP provisioning MnS producer notifies ASP about the successful
instantiation of EAS with the creation of MOIs for the EASRequirement IOC and
EASFunction(s) IOC.

in TS 28.532 [5]) operation for EASFunction MOI to request ECSP provisioning
MnS producer to start the EAS VNF termination.
2\. ECSP provisioning MnS producer sends a response to the ASP indicating that
the termination operation is in progress.
3\. ECSP provisioning MnS producer invokes the _TerminateNsRequest_ or
UpdateNsRequest operation (see clauses 7.3.7 and 7.3.5 in ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013
[6]) to request NFVO via the Os-Ma-nfvo interface to terminate EAS VNF
instance.
4\. NFVO sends **the NS Lifecycle Change** notification to ECSP provisioning
MnS producer indicating the result of termination procedure (see clause 7.3.12
of ETSI GS NFV-IFA 013 [6]).
5\. If the VNF termination has been successful then:
> 5.1. ECSP provisioning MnS producer deletes the MOI for EASFunction IOC ,if
> all the related EASFunction MOIs have been deleted, the EASRequirement IOC
> shall also be deleted.
>
> 5.2. ECSP provisioning MnS producer notifies ASP about the successful
> termination of the EAS.
>
