# 5 Discovery of Management Services
## 5.1 Overview
To enable communication between MnS consumers and MnS producers, MnS consumers
need a mechanism to discover MnS producers that are available in the 3GPP
management system, and their management capabilities.
To this end, MnS producers need to register themselves with their management
capabilities in the 3GPP management system. The data describing a MnS producer
and their capabilities is called MnS information or MnS profile. The complete
profile or parts thereof is registered in the 3GPP management system. In case
registered MnS information changes, the 3GPP management system needs to be
updated as well and MnS consumers of the modified MnS producer should be
informed.
MnS consumers wishing to discover MnS producers might have different
questions. For example, a consumer may wish to know which MnS producers manage
a certain geographical area or civic location. Or, after receiving an alarm
notification specifying that a specific NF is alarmed, they may wish to know
the MnS producers where they can request management data from that NF or to
retrieve the configuration of that NF.

# 6 Managing management data
## 6.1 Producing and reporting management data
### 6.1.1 Description
Management data is referring to data produced by radio access network
functions, core network functions or management functions and used for
management purposes. Management data specified by 3GPP for 5G management is
classified into 5G performance measurements as defined by TS 28.552 [4], 5G
end to end key performance indicators as defined by TS 28.554 [5] and
Trace/MDT data as defined by TS 32.422 [6]. The combined performance
measurements and key performance indicators are also called performance
metrics.
Management data is produced on request. Therefore, the 3GPP management system
needs to enable a data consumer to request management data to be produced. The
data requester needs to specify the type of data to be produced as well as the
radio access network functions, core network functions and management
functions where the data shall be produced. The target managed object
instances can be identified in multiple ways:
\- The requester can specify the target managed object instances based on the
managed object tree (as defined in the 3GPP Network Resource Models)
representing the network and management functions. The simplest approach is to
directly identify the managed object instances where data shall be produced.
More sophisticated approaches allow to specify one or more subtrees where data
shall be produced and may allow also to specify managed object classes to
select only object instances of specific classes.
\- The requester can specify one or multiple of the following selection
criteria. The system needs to translate this information into the target
managed object instances. The selection criteria need to be deterministic in
such a way that the target node(s) can be selected unambiguously.
\- Area of interest: In a big network, it makes sense to specify a limited
area for which data shall be produced. The area of interest can be expressed
for example with a geographical area, one or several cells or one or several
tracking areas. The target managed object instances represent network
functions serving that area of interest. Geographical areas can be expressed
for example with multiple longitude-latitude pairs that define a convex
polygon. In the radio domain the geographical area needs to be mapped to the
coverage area of cells supported by RAN NE(s). The managed object instances
(e.g. NRCellCU, GNBDUFunction) providing service to these cells can be
identified as target managed object instances. Of course the coverage area of
the target cell(s) will usually not exactly map to the described shape of the
geographical area because, on the one side, the coverage area of cell has no
sharp borders due to fast fading effects, on the other side, the coverage area
of cells may vary slightly e.g. due to adaptation of the antenna downtilt
angle or beamforming configurations. For the mapping between the geographical
area and the corresponding managed object instances the cell coverage status
at the time of the request shall be used. Later changes affecting the cell
coverage shall not be reflected for the mapping.
\- Domain e.g RAN, CN: A consumer might only be interested in analysing and
understanding the performance of a particular domain like RAN or Core e.g in
case of recurrent issues, a consumer may want to have understanding of a
particular domain only for further actions. In such a scenario, it should be
possible to indicate the domain from where consumer wants measurements for its
usage.
\- Traffic type e.g user plane or control plane: 5G brings clear separation
(CUPS) of user plane and control plane in a network, a consumer may leverage
it to identify target managed object instances to have measurements from. For
example, the measurement report may be expected from user plane nodes only.
\- Slice type e.g eMBB, URLLC: Consumer may mention a particular slice type
(eMBB, URLLC, mIoT, V2X, HMTC) as the selection criteria. It may help in
narrowing down the target managed object instances, which are part of provided
slice type(s).
This MnS to request management data in a simple way shall not be exposed at
any network function.
The management data can be requested according to a certain time scheduler.
The consumer can e.g. specify a start and stop time or can request for data at
specific days of a week or specific hours of a day..
After production the data needs to be reported to the data consumers.
Reporting can be based on multiple reporting methods such as file or
streaming. Data reporting needs to be requested by the data consumer. The
requestor needs to specify the control parameters for reporting such as the
reporting method and the address the data shall be delivered to.
Depending on access rights and security settings, data consumers may be
subject to restrictions regarding the data they can access.
Data is always produced in some context. The data describing this context is
called context data. Context data contains information on all interrelated
conditions in which the management data is produced. This includes for example
the configuration of the measured network functions, information on the
network entity where the network function is running such as vendor name or
software version, but also alarms associated to the network function or load
conditions.
Data consumers processing managemen data in an effort to accomplish some task
typically benefit when taking context data into account. For that reason data
consumers should be able to obtain the context data for the management data
they obtain. However, access to certain management data does not automaticlly
imply access to all context data. Access to management data and access to
context data may be subject to different data security and data protection
considerations.

REQ-MDMPR-5: The 3GPP management system shall enable an authorized data
consumer to obtain context data for management data. Access to management data
does not imply access to context data. Different data privacy considerations
may apply.
NOTE: The term \"management data specified by 3GPP\" relates to
\- 5G performance measurements as defined by TS 28.552 [4]
\- 5G end to end key performance indicators as defined by TS 28.554 [5], and
\- Trace/MDT data as defined by TS 32.422 [6].
## 6.2 Coordinating management data production
### 6.2.1 Description
Many consumers can request network or management functions to produce
management data. In this context it is beneficial to coordinate data requests
at the management level to optimize management data production.
### 6.2.2 Use cases
This clause describes the benefits of the subject capability.
Editor\'s note: This clause will be extended with the benefits of the subject
capability.
### 6.2.3 Requirements
REQ-MDMC-CON-1: The 3GPP management system shall coordinate requests from
several data consumers to avoid producing multiple times the same data at a
certain point of time.
Editor\'s note: It is tbc what exactly is \"same data\".
## 6.3 Storing management data
### 6.3.1 Description
Storing management data enables reusage of management data for multiple
management purposes.
For example, AI/ML models need input data collected over a certain period of
time for training purposes. A specific set of collected data may serve
different purposes and can therefore be input to multiple AI/ML services. For
example, management data collected in a geographical area may be used also for
another geographical area when the scenarios in the areas are statistically
similar.
Another use case for storing produced data is related to the fact that
multiple sets of training data from similar scenarios are typically required.
For example, one set of data produced for the rush hour in a subway station on
a single weekday is typically not enough for profiling. Many sets produced on
many workdays are required.
Stored data is useful when management functions can discover which data has
been produced and stored in the past to check if the currently needed data is
already available.
### 6.3.2 Use cases
This clause describes the benefits of the subject capability.
Editor\'s note: This clause will be extended with the benefits of the subject

REQ-MDMS-CON-2: The 3GPP management system shall enable an authorized data
consumer to discover stored management data.
REQ-MDMS-CON-3: The 3GPP management system shall enable an authorized data
consumer to retrieve stored management data.
## 6.4 Managing external management data
### 6.4.1 Description
Management data which is specified by 3GPP (clause 6.1.1) can be enriched by
additional data not specified by 3GPP. This so-called external management data
can be produced by data sources of different nature (e.g. sensors) with
different formats.
External management data can be used for example as additional input for
network optimization and prediction.
The management system should be able to manage this kind of data. That means
data consumers should be able to request external management data to be
produced and reported. The management system should provide support for
storing it.
The definition of external data sources and the data formats they use is out
of scope of this specification.
The target is to define generic management mechanisms that can cope with any
kind of external data sources and data formats.
### 6.4.2 Use cases
This clause describes the benefits of the subject capability.
Editor\'s note: This clause will be extended with the benefits of the subject
capability.

consumer to retrieve stored external management data.
NOTE: The term \"external management data\" relates to data not specified by
3GPP.
## 6.5 Discovery of management data
### 6.5.1 Description
Discovery of management data mechanism allows MnS consumers to discover what
management data can be produced by the 3GPP management system without direct
involvement of those MnS services producing the data, which can be time and
resource consuming process.
For this mechanism to work MnS producers as entities producing data, need to
register what data they can produce by adding a corresponding record in the
3GPP management system.
NOTE: The term \"management data produced by 3GPP management system\" relates
to
\- 5G performance measurements as defined by TS 28.552 [4]
\- 5G end to end key performance indicators as defined by TS 28.554 [5], and
\- Trace/MDT data as defined by TS 32.422 [6].
### 6.5.2 Use cases
This clause describes the benefits of the subject capability.
Editor\'s note: This clause will be extended with the benefits of the subject
capability.
### 6.5.3 Requirements
REQ-DMSDIS-CON-1: The 3GPP management system shall enable an authorized data
consumer to discover what management data can be produced by 3GPP management
system.
