# Introduction
The present document is part of a TS-family covering the 3^rd^ Generation
Partnership Project Technical Specification Group Services and System Aspects,
Telecommunication Management; as identified below:
28.674: Telecommunication management; Home eNode B Subsystem (HeNS) Network
Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP): Requirements.
**28.675.: Telecommunication management; Home eNode B Subsystem (HeNS) Network
Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP): Information Service
(IS).**
28.676: Telecommunication management; Home enhanced Node B Subsystem (HeNS)
Network Resource Model (NRM) Integration Reference Point (IRP); Solution Set
(SS) definitions.
.
# 1 Scope
The present document specifies the Home enhanced Node B (HeNB) Subsystem
(HeNS) Network Resource Model (NRM) IRP that can be communicated between an
IRPAgent and an IRPManager for telecommunication network management purposes,
including management of converged networks.
This document specifies the semantics and behaviour of information object
class attributes and relations visible across the reference point in a
protocol and technology neutral way. It does not define their syntax and
encoding.
In order to access the information defined by this NRM, an IRP IS is needed,
such as the Basic CM IRP IS (3GPP TS 32.602 [6]) or the Bulk CM IRP IS (3GPP
TS 32.612 [7]). However, which IS that is applicable is outside the scope of
the present document.
# 2 References
The following documents contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of the present document.
\- References are either specific (identified by date of publication, edition
number, version number, etc.) or nonâ€‘specific.
\- For a specific reference, subsequent revisions do not apply.
\- For a non-specific reference, the latest version applies. In the case of a
reference to a 3GPP document (including a GSM document), a non-specific
reference implicitly refers to the latest version of that document _in the
same Release as the present document_.

### 4.2.1 Relationships
This clause depicts the set of IOCs that encapsulate information relevant for
this service. This clause provides the overview of all information object
classes in UML. Subsequent clauses provide more detailed specification of
various aspects of these information object classes.
{width="6.360416666666667in" height="2.9256944444444444in"}
NOTE 1: The listed cardinality numbers, in particular the use of cardinality
number zero, do not represent transient states. The transient state is
considered an inherent property of all IOC instances and therefore there is no
need to represent them by individual IOC cardinality numbers.

NOTE 1: The listed cardinality numbers, in particular the use of cardinality
number zero, do not represent transient states. The transient state is
considered an inherent property of all IOC instances and therefore there is no
need to represent them by individual IOC cardinality numbers.
NOTE 2: Each instance of the VsDataContainer shall only be contained under one
IOC. The VsDataContainer can be contained under IOCs defined in other NRMs.
Figure 4.2.1-3: VsDataContainer Containment/Naming
The VsDataContainer is only used for the Bulk CM IRP.
Each IOC is identified with a Distinguished Name (DN) according to 3GPP TS
32.300 [11] that expresses its containment
### 4.2.2 Inheritance
This clause depicts the inheritance relationships that exist between IOCs.
